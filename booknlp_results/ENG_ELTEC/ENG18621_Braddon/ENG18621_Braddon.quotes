3236	3246	3248	3249	Mrs. Dawson	154	" Do you know , my dear Miss Graham , "
3251	3264	3248	3249	Mrs. Dawson	154	" I think you ought to consider yourself a remarkably lucky girl ? "
3325	3336	3337	3337	she	578	" What do you mean , my dear Mrs. Dawson ? "
3378	3405	3406	3407	Lucy Graham	152	" Why , I mean , my dear , that it only rests with yourself to become Lady Audley , and the mistress of Audley Court . "
3443	3452	3454	3455	the surgeon	508	" My dear , do n't agitate yourself , "
3461	3569	3454	3455	the surgeon	508	" you know that nobody asks you to marry Sir Michael unless you wish . Of course it would be a magnificent match ; he has a splendid income , and is one of the most generous of men . Your position would be very high , and you would be enabled to do a great deal of good ; but , as I said before , you must be entirely guided by your own feelings . Only one thing I must say , and that is that if Sir Michael 's attentions are not agreeable to you , it is really scarcely honorable to encourage him . "
3570	3577	3579	3579	Lucy	152	" His attentions — encourage him ! "
3588	3620	3579	3579	Lucy	152	" Pray , pray do n't talk to me , Mrs. Dawson . I had no idea of this . It is the last thing that would have occurred to me . "
3741	3755	3756	3756	she	152	" I think some people are born to be unlucky , Mrs. Dawson , "
3765	3783	3784	3784	She	152	" it would be a great deal too much good fortune for me to become Lady Audley . "
3807	3814	3815	3815	she	575	" You unlucky , my dear ! "
3818	3871	3815	3815	she	575	" I think you are the last person who ought to talk like that — you , such a bright , happy creature , that it does every one good to see you . I 'm sure I do n't know what we shall do if Sir Michael robs us of you . "
4092	4104	4105	4105	he	146	" I scarcely think there is a greater sin , Lucy , "
4110	4193	4194	4194	he	146	" than that of a woman who marries a man she does not love . You are so precious to me , my beloved , that deeply as my heart is set on this , and bitter as the mere thought of disappointment is to me , I would not have you commit such a sin for any happiness of mine . If my happiness could be achieved by such an act , which it could not — which it never could , "
4197	4214	4194	4194	he	146	earnestly—"nothing but misery can result from a marriage dictated by any motive but truth and love . "
4302	4309	4328	4328	she	152	" Lucy , you heard me ? "
4310	4313	4314	4314	she	152	" Yes , "
4335	4340	4314	4314	she	152	" And your answer ? "
4404	4413	4414	4414	he	465	" No , Lucy ; no , no ! "
4419	4426	4414	4414	he	465	" not here , not here ! "
4427	4434	4435	4435	she	152	" Yes , here , here , "
4459	4649	4435	4435	she	152	" here and nowhere else . How good you are — how noble and how generous ! Love you ! Why , there are women a hundred times my superiors in beauty and in goodness who might love you dearly ; but you ask too much of me ! Remember what my life has been ; only remember that ! From my very babyhood I have never seen anything but poverty . My father was a gentleman : clever , accomplished , handsome — but poor — and what a pitiful wretch poverty made of him ! My mother — But do not let me speak of her . Poverty — poverty , trials , vexations , humiliations , deprivations . You can not tell ; you , who are among those for whom life is so smooth and easy , you can never guess what is endured by such as we . Do not ask too much of me , then . I can not be disinterested ; I can not be blind to the advantages of such an alliance . I can not , I can not ! "
4735	4744	4745	4745	she	602	" Do n't ask too much of me , "
4749	4758	4745	4745	she	602	" I have been selfish from my babyhood . "
4759	4772	4745	4745	she	602	" Lucy — Lucy , speak plainly . Do you dislike me ? "
4773	4781	4745	4745	she	602	" Dislike you ? No — no ! "
4782	4793	4794	4794	She	602	" But is there any one else whom you love ? "
4801	4812	4813	4813	she	602	" I do not love any one in the world , "
4852	4915	4835	4835	He	465	" Well , Lucy , I will not ask too much of you . I dare say I am a romantic old fool ; but if you do not dislike me , and if you do not love any one else , I see no reason why we should not make a very happy couple . Is it a bargain , Lucy ? "
4916	4919	4920	4921	The baronet	465	" Yes . "
5115	5128	5129	5129	she	152	" No more dependence , no more drudgery , no more humiliations , "
5132	5156	5129	5129	she	152	" every trace of the old life melted away — every clew to identity buried and forgotten — except these , except these . "
5260	5266	5267	5267	he	465	" How wearisome they are , "
5270	5308	5267	5267	he	465	" blue and green , and opal ; opal , and blue , and green ; all very well in their way , of course , but three months of them are rather too much , especially — "
5340	5351	5352	5352	he	465	" Poor little girl , how pleased she 'll be ! "
5366	5391	5352	5352	he	465	" how pleased and how surprised ? Poor little girl . After three years and a half , too ; she will be surprised . "
5826	5834	5814	5814	his	157	" Ah , yes , by Jove ! "
5836	5843	5814	5814	his	157	" To be sure , ah ! "
6173	6186	6187	6187	he	157	" I will go ashore in the first boat that hails us , "
6190	6216	6187	6187	he	157	" I will go ashore in a cockle - shell . By Jove , if it comes to that , I will swim to land . "
6378	6388	6389	6389	he	157	" Does my cigar annoy you , Miss Morley ? "
6399	6426	6389	6389	he	157	" Not at all ; pray do not leave off smoking . I only came up to look at the sunset . What a lovely evening ! "
6427	6436	6437	6437	he	157	" Yes , yes , I dare say , "
6442	6463	6437	6437	he	157	" yet so long , so long ! Ten more interminable days and ten more weary nights before we land . "
6464	6467	6469	6470	Miss Morley	162	" Yes , "
6474	6482	6469	6470	Miss Morley	162	" Do you wish the time shorter ? "
6483	6487	6489	6489	George	157	" Do I ? "
6491	6500	6489	6489	George	157	" Indeed I do . Do n't you ? "
6501	6504	6437	6437	he	157	" Scarcely . "
6505	6528	6469	6470	Miss Morley	162	" But is there no one you love in England ? Is there no one you love looking out for your arrival ? "
6529	6534	6535	6535	she	162	" I hope so , "
6619	6622	6624	6624	George	157	" See ! "
6641	6648	6649	6649	She	162	" there 's the new moon ! "
6666	6677	6657	6657	her	162	" This is the first time we have seen it . "
6678	6683	6685	6685	George	157	" We must wish ! "
6687	6694	6657	6657	her	162	" I know what I wish . "
6695	6698	6657	6657	her	162	" What ? "
6699	6707	6657	6657	her	162	" That we may get home quickly . "
6708	6723	6725	6726	the governess	578	" My wish is that we may find no disappointment when we get there , "
6730	6733	6725	6726	the governess	578	" Disappointment ! "
6753	6758	6759	6759	she	162	" I mean this , "
6775	6991	6992	6992	she	680	" I mean that as the end of the voyage draws near , hope sinks in my heart ; and a sick fear comes over me that at the last all may not be well . The person I go to meet may be changed in his feelings toward me ; or he may retain all the old feeling until the moment of seeing me , and then lose it in a breath at sight of my poor wan face , for I was called a pretty girl , Mr. Talboys , when I sailed for Sydney , fifteen years ago ; or he may be so changed by the world as to have grown selfish and mercenary , and he may welcome me for the sake of my fifteen years ' savings . Again , he may be dead . He may have been well , perhaps , up to within a week of our landing , and in that last week may have taken a fever , and died an hour before our vessel anchors in the Mersey . I think of all these things , Mr. Talboys , and act the scenes over in my mind , and feel the anguish of them twenty times a day . Twenty times a day , "
6995	7006	6992	6992	she	680	" why I do it a thousand times a day . "
7046	7050	7051	7051	she	680	" I wonder , "
7061	7160	7051	7051	she	680	" I wonder , looking back , to think how hopeful I was when the vessel sailed ; I never thought then of disappointment , but I pictured the joy of meeting , imagining the very words that would be said , the very tones , the very looks ; but for this last month of the voyage , day by day , and hour by hour my heart sinks and my hopeful fancies fade away , and I dread the end as much as if I knew that I was going to England to attend a funeral . "
7199	7204	7205	7205	he	667	" What a fool ! "
7219	7329	7205	7205	he	667	" what a fool I am to be frightened at this ? Why do you come and say these things to me ? Why do you come and terrify me out of my senses , when I am going straight home to the woman I love ; to a girl whose heart is as true as the light of Heaven ; and in whom I no more expect to find any change than I do to see another sun rise in to - morrow 's sky ? Why do you come and try to put such fancies in my head when I am going home to my darling wife ? "
7330	7334	7335	7335	she	684	" Your wife , "
7338	7482	7335	7335	she	684	" that is different . There is no reason that my terrors should terrify you . I am going to England to rejoin a man to whom I was engaged to be married fifteen years ago . He was too poor to marry then , and when I was offered a situation as governess in a rich Australian family , I persuaded him to let me accept it , so that I might leave him free and unfettered to win his way in the world , while I saved a little money to help us when we began life together . I never meant to stay away so long , but things have gone badly with him in England . That is my story , and you can understand my fears . They need not influence you . Mine is an exceptional case . "
7483	7488	7490	7490	George	157	" So is mine , "
7494	7590	7490	7490	George	157	" I tell you that mine is an exceptional case : although I swear to you that until this moment , I have never known a fear as to the result of my voyage home . But you are right ; your terrors have nothing to do with me . You have been away fifteen years ; all kinds of things may happen in fifteen years . Now it is only three years and a half this very month since I left England . What can have happened in such a short time as that ? "
7638	7660	7661	7661	he	157	" My pretty little wife ! My gentle , innocent , loving little wife ! Do you know , Miss Morley , "
7672	7707	7661	7661	he	157	" that I left my little girl asleep , with her baby in her arms , and with nothing but a few blotted lines to tell her why her faithful husband had deserted her ? "
7708	7712	7714	7715	the governess	578	" Deserted her ! "
7717	8000	7714	7715	the governess	578	" Yes . I was an ensign in a cavalry regiment when I first met my little darling . We were quartered at a stupid seaport town , where my pet lived with her shabby old father , a half - pay naval officer ; a regular old humbug , as poor as Job , and with an eye for nothing but the main chance . I saw through all his shallow tricks to catch one of us for his pretty daughter . I saw all the pitiable , contemptible , palpable traps he set for us big dragoons to walk into . I saw through his shabby - genteel dinners and public - house port ; his fine talk of the grandeur of his family ; his sham pride and independence , and the sham tears of his bleared old eyes when he talked of his only child . He was a drunken old hypocrite , and he was ready to sell my poor , little girl to the highest bidder . Luckily for me , I happened just then to be the highest bidder ; for my father , is a rich man , Miss Morley , and as it was love at first sight on both sides , my darling and I made a match of it . No sooner , however , did my father hear that I had married a penniless little girl , the daughter of a tipsy old half - pay lieutenant , than he wrote me a furious letter , telling me he would never again hold any communication with me , and that my yearly allowance would stop from my wedding - day . "
8669	9230	8655	8655	he	720	" I listened to these men for upward of an hour , following them up and down the pier , with my pipe in my mouth , and hearing all their talk . After this I fell into conversation with them myself , and ascertained that there was a vessel going to leave Liverpool in three days , by which vessel one of the men was going out . This man gave me all the information I required , and told me , moreover , that a stalwart young fellow , such as I was , could hardly fail to do well in the diggings . The thought flashed upon me so suddenly , that I grew hot and red in the face , and trembled in every limb with excitement . This was better than the water , at any rate . Suppose I stole away from my darling , leaving her safe under her father 's roof , and went and made a fortune in the new world , and came back in a twelvemonth to throw it into her lap ; for I was so sanguine in those days that I counted on making my fortune in a year or so . I thanked the man for his information , and late at night strolled homeward . It was bitter winter weather , but I had been too full of passion to feel cold , and I walked through the quiet streets , with the snow drifting in my face , and a desperate hopefulness in my heart . The old man was sitting drinking brandy - and - water in the little dining - room ; and my wife was up - stairs , sleeping peacefully , with the baby on her breast . I sat down and wrote a few brief lines , which told her that I never had loved her better than now , when I seemed to desert her ; that I was going to try my fortune in the new world , and that if I succeeded I should come back to bring her plenty and happiness ; but that if I failed I should never look upon her face again . I divided the remainder of our money — something over forty pounds — into two equal portions , leaving one for her , and putting the other in my pocket . I knelt down and prayed for my wife and child , with my head upon the white counterpane that covered them . I was n't much of a praying man at ordinary times , but God knows that was a heartfelt prayer . I kissed her once , and the baby once , and then crept out of the room . The dining - room door was open , and the old man was nodding over his paper . He looked up as he heard my step in the passage , and asked me where I was going . ' To have a smoke in the street , ' I answered ; and as this was a common habit of mine he believed me . Three nights after I was out at sea , bound for Melbourne — a steerage passenger , with a digger 's tools for my baggage , and about seven shillings in my pocket . "
9231	9236	9238	9239	Miss Morley	162	" And you succeeded ? "
9241	9479	9238	9239	Miss Morley	162	" Not till I had long despaired of success ; not until poverty and I had become such old companions and bed - fellows , that looking back at my past life , I wondered whether that dashing , reckless , extravagant , luxurious , champagne - drinking dragoon could have really been the same man who sat on the damp ground gnawing a moldy crust in the wilds of the new world . I clung to the memory of my darling , and the trust that I had in her love and truth was the one keystone that kept the fabric of my past life together — the one star that lit the thick black darkness of the future . I was hail - fellow - well - met with bad men ; I was in the center of riot , drunkenness , and debauchery ; but the purifying influence of my love kept me safe from all . Thin and gaunt , the half - starved shadow of what I once had been , I saw myself one day in a broken bit of looking - glass , and was frightened by my own face . But I toiled on through all ; through disappointment and despair , rheumatism , fever , starvation ; at the very gates of death , I toiled on steadily to the end ; and in the end I conquered . "
9521	9527	9528	9528	she	640	" How brave you were ! "
9531	9534	9535	9535	he	727	" Brave ! "
9545	9764	9535	9535	he	727	" was n't I working for my darling ? Through all the dreary time of that probation , her pretty white hand seemed beckoning me onward to a happy future ! Why , I have seen her under my wretched canvas tent sitting by my side , with her boy in her arms , as plainly as I had ever seen her in the one happy year of our wedded life . At last , one dreary foggy morning , just three months ago , with a drizzling rain wetting me to the skin , up to my neck in clay and mire , half - starved , enfeebled by fever , stiff with rheumatism , a monster nugget turned up under my spade , and I was in one minute the richest man in Australia . I fell down on the wet clay , with my lump of gold in the bosom of my shirt , and , for the first time in my life , cried like a child . I traveled post - haste to Sydney , realized my price , which was worth upward of £ 20,000 , and a fortnight afterward took my passage for England in this vessel ; and in ten days — in ten days I shall see my darling . "
9765	9779	9535	9535	he	727	" But in all that time did you never write to your wife ? "
9780	9884	9885	9885	He	729	" Never , till the night before I left Sydney . I could not write when everything looked so black . I could not write and tell her that I was fighting hard with despair and death . I waited for better fortune , and when that came I wrote telling her that I should be in England almost as soon as my letter , and giving her an address at a coffee - house in London where she could write to me , telling me where to find her , though she is hardly likely to have left her father 's house . "
9945	9973	9939	9940	the governess	578	" Miss Morley , if , when I get to England , I hear that anything has happened to my wife , I shall fall down dead . "
9974	10037	9939	9940	the governess	578	" My dear Mr. Talboys , why do you think of these things ? God is very good to us ; He will not afflict us beyond our power of endurance . I see all things , perhaps , in a melancholy light ; for the long monotony of my life has given me too much time to think over my troubles . "
10038	10116	9939	9940	the governess	578	" And my life has been all action , privation , toil , alternate hope and despair ; I have had no time to think upon the chances of anything happening to my darling . What a blind , reckless fool I have been ! Three years and a half and not one line — one word from her , or from any mortal creature who knows her . Heaven above ! what may not have happened ? "
10145	10154	10155	10155	he	732	" I swear to you , Miss Morley , "
10158	10211	10155	10155	he	732	" that till you spoke to me to - night , I never felt one shadow of fear , and now I have that sick , sinking dread at my heart which you talked of an hour ago . Let me alone , please , to get over it my own way . "
10281	10287	10288	10288	he	157	" I have been praying , "
10289	10294	10295	10295	He	157	said—"praying for my darling . "
11022	11027	11029	11030	the man	634	" Why , Phoebe , "
11050	11109	11039	11039	he	634	" you came upon me so still and sudden , that I thought you was an evil spirit . I 've come across through the fields , and come in here at the gate agen the moat , and I was taking a rest before I came up to the house to ask if you was come back . "
11110	11123	11124	11124	Phoebe	166	" I can see the well from my bedroom window , Luke , "
11138	11171	11172	11173	The man	634	" I saw you sitting here , and came down to have a chat ; it 's better talking out here than in the house , where there 's always somebody listening . "
11309	11319	11320	11320	she	753	" Are you glad to see me , Luke ? "
11323	11332	11333	11333	he	634	" Of course I 'm glad , lass , "
11371	11383	11385	11386	the girl	753	" You do n't seem much as if you were glad , "
11388	11409	11385	11386	the girl	753	" you might look at me , Luke , and tell me if you think my journey has improved me . "
11410	11424	11425	11425	he	634	" It ai n't put any color into your cheeks , my girl , "
11438	11453	11425	11425	he	634	" you 're every bit as white as you was when you went away . "
11454	11520	11385	11386	the girl	753	" But they say traveling makes people genteel , Luke . I 've been on the Continent with my lady , through all manner of curious places ; and you know , when I was a child , Squire Horton 's daughters taught me to speak a little French , and I found it so nice to be able to talk to the people abroad . "
11521	11524	11526	11527	Luke Marks	167	" Genteel ! "
11534	11603	11526	11527	Luke Marks	167	" who wants you to be genteel , I wonder ? Not me , for one ; when you 're my wife you wo n't have overmuch time for gentility , my girl . French , too ! Dang me , Phoebe , I suppose when we 've saved money enough between us to buy a bit of a farm , you 'll be parleyvooing to the cows ? "
11676	11730	11663	11663	she	784	" What a fine thing it is for Miss Graham that was , to travel with her maid and her courier , and her chariot and four , and a husband that thinks there is n't one spot upon all the earth that 's good enough for her to set her foot upon ! "
11731	11748	11750	11750	Luke	167	" Ay , it is a fine thing , Phoebe , to have lots of money , "
11752	11776	11750	11750	Luke	167	" and I hope you 'll be warned by that , my lass , to save up your wages agin we get married . "
11777	11793	11795	11796	the girl	753	" Why , what was she in Mr. Dawson 's house only three months ago ? "
11809	11924	11800	11800	she	753	" What was she but a servant like me ? Taking wages and working for them as hard , or harder , than I did . You should have seen her shabby clothes , Luke — worn and patched , and darned and turned and twisted , yet always looking nice upon her , somehow . She gives me more as lady's - maid here than ever she got from Mr. Dawson then . Why , I 've seen her come out of the parlor with a few sovereigns and a little silver in her hand , that master had just given her for her quarter 's salary ; and now look at her ! "
11925	11931	11933	11933	Luke	167	" Never you mind her , "
11935	11991	11933	11933	Luke	167	" take care of yourself , Phoebe ; that 's all you 've got to do . What should you say to a public - house for you and me , by - and - by , my girl ? There 's a deal of money to be made out of a public - house . "
12034	12046	12047	12047	she	753	" You should see the inside of the house , Luke , "
12050	12110	12047	12047	she	753	" it 's a tumbledown looking place enough outside ; but you should see my lady 's rooms — all pictures and gilding , and great looking - glasses that stretch from the ceiling to the floor . Painted ceilings , too , that cost hundreds of pounds , the housekeeper told her , and all done for her . "
12111	12118	12120	12120	Luke	167	" She 's a lucky one , "
12126	12246	12120	12120	Luke	167	" You should have seen her while we were abroad , with a crowd of gentlemen hanging about her ; Sir Michael not jealous of them , only proud to see her so much admired . You should have heard her laugh and talk with them ; throwing all their compliments and fine speeches back at them , as it were , as if they had been pelting her with roses . She set everybody mad about her , wherever she went . Her singing , her playing , her painting , her dancing , her beautiful smile , and sunshiny ringlets ! She was always the talk of a place , as long as we stayed in it . "
12247	12256	12047	12047	she	753	" Is she at home to - night ? "
12257	12294	12047	12047	she	753	" No ; she has gone out with Sir Michael to a dinner party at the Beeches . They 've seven or eight miles to drive , and they wo n't be back till after eleven . "
12295	12326	12120	12120	Luke	167	" Then I 'll tell you what , Phoebe , if the inside of the house is so mighty fine , I should like to have a look at it . "
12327	12359	12047	12047	she	753	" You shall , then . Mrs. Barton , the housekeeper , knows you by sight , and she ca n't object to my showing you some of the best rooms . "
12515	12525	12526	12526	he	167	" It 's a mortal dull place , Phoebe , "
12546	12562	12526	12526	he	167	" I 've heard tell of a murder that was done here in old times . "
12563	12578	12580	12581	the girl	753	" There are murders enough in these times , as to that , Luke , "
12679	12687	12688	12688	he	667	" It 's a rare fine place , "
12691	12701	12688	12688	he	667	" and must have cost a heap of money . "
12702	12711	12713	12713	Phoebe	166	" Look at the pictures on the walls , "
12736	12763	12764	12764	She	753	" I 've heard that those alone are worth a fortune . This is the entrance to my lady 's apartments , Miss Graham that was . "
12827	12861	12862	12863	Her cousin	790	" I 've got all these things to put away before my lady comes home , Luke ; you might sit down here while I do it , I sha n't be long . "
12901	12913	12915	12916	the girl	753	" I wish I could show you the jewels , Luke , "
12918	12943	12915	12916	the girl	753	" but I ca n't , for she always keeps the keys herself ; that 's the case on the dressing - table there . "
12944	12949	12951	12951	Luke	167	" What , that ? "
12965	12982	12951	12951	Luke	167	" Why , that 's big enough to hold every bit of clothes I 've got ! "
12983	13002	13004	13004	Phoebe	166	" And it 's as full as it can be of diamonds , rubies , pearls and emeralds , "
13057	13061	13062	13062	she	166	" I declare ! "
13065	13094	13062	13062	she	166	" my lady has left her keys in her pocket for once in a way ; I can show you the jewelry , if you like , Luke . "
13095	13111	13112	13112	he	828	" Well , I may as well have a look at it , my girl , "
13193	13225	13230	13230	Luke	167	" Why , one of those diamond things would set us up in life , Phoebe , he said , turning a bracelet over and over in his big red hands . "
13237	13248	13230	13230	Luke	167	" cried the girl , with a look of terror ; "
13257	13279	13251	13251	you	828	" He laid the bracelet in its place with a reluctant sigh , and then continued his examination of the casket . "
13284	13326	13251	13251	you	828	" he asked presently , pointing to a brass knob in the frame - work of the box . He pushed it as he spoke , and a secret drawer , lined with purple velvet , flew out of the casket . "
13331	13359	13251	13251	you	828	" cried Luke , pleased at his discovery . Phoebe Marks threw down the dress she had been folding , and went over to the toilette table . "
13368	13372	13362	13362	I	0	" she said ; "
13381	13439	13373	13373	I	0	" There was not much in it ; neither gold nor gems ; only a baby 's little worsted shoe rolled up in a piece of paper , and a tiny lock of pale and silky yellow hair , evidently taken from a baby 's head . Phoebe 's eyes dilated as she examined the little packet . "
13452	13456	13444	13445	my lady	468	" she muttered . "
13468	13485	13486	13486	You	831	" said Luke , carelessly . The girl 's thin lip curved into a curious smile . "
13496	13508	13486	13486	You	831	" she said , putting the little parcel into her pocket . "
13527	13533	13513	13513	you	166	" cried the young man . "
13550	13554	13555	13555	you	831	" she answered ; "
13564	14477	13562	13562	Luke	167	" Robert Audley was supposed to be a barrister . As a barrister was his name inscribed in the law - list ; as a barrister he had chambers in Figtree Court , Temple ; as a barrister he had eaten the allotted number of dinners , which form the sublime ordeal through which the forensic aspirant wades on to fame and fortune . If these things can make a man a barrister , Robert Audley decidedly was one . But he had never either had a brief , or tried to get a brief , or even wished to have a brief in all those five years , during which his name had been painted upon one of the doors in Figtree Court . He was a handsome , lazy , care - for - nothing fellow , of about seven - and - twenty ; the only son of a younger brother of Sir Michael Audley . His father had left him £ 400 a year , which his friends had advised him to increase by being called to the bar ; and as he found it , after due consideration , more trouble to oppose the wishes of these friends than to eat so many dinners , and to take a set of chambers in the Temple , he adopted the latter course , and unblushingly called himself a barrister . Sometimes , when the weather was very hot , and he had exhausted himself with the exertion of smoking his German pipe , and reading French novels , he would stroll into the Temple Gardens , and lying in some shady spot , pale and cool , with his shirt collar turned down and a blue silk handkerchief tied loosely about his neck , would tell grave benchers that he had knocked himself up with over work . The sly old benchers laughed at the pleasant fiction ; but they all agreed that Robert Audley was a good fellow ; a generous - hearted fellow ; rather a curious fellow , too , with a fund of sly wit and quiet humor , under his listless , dawdling , indifferent , irresolute manner . A man who would never get on in the world ; but who would not hurt a worm . Indeed , his chambers were converted into a perfect dog - kennel , by his habit of bringing home stray and benighted curs , who were attracted by his looks in the street , and followed him with abject fondness . Robert always spent the hunting season at Audley Court ; not that he was distinguished as a Nimrod , for he would quietly trot to covert upon a mild - tempered , stout - limbed bay hack , and keep at a very respectful distance from the hard riders ; his horse knowing quite as well as he did , that nothing was further from his thoughts than any desire to be in at the death . The young man was a great favorite with his uncle , and by no means despised by his pretty , gipsy - faced , light - hearted , hoydenish cousin , Miss Alicia Audley . It might have seemed to other men , that the partiality of a young lady who was sole heiress to a very fine estate , was rather well worth cultivating , but it did not so occur to Robert Audley . Alicia was a very nice girl , he said , a jolly girl , with no nonsense about her — a girl of a thousand ; but this was the highest point to which enthusiasm could carry him . The idea of turning his cousin 's girlish liking for him to some good account never entered his idle brain . I doubt if he even had any correct notion of the amount of his uncle 's fortune , and I am certain that he never for one moment calculated upon the chances of any part of that fortune ultimately coming to himself . So that when , one fine spring morning , about three months before the time of which I am writing , the postman brought him the wedding cards of Sir Michael and Lady Audley , together with a very indignant letter from his cousin , setting forth how her father had just married a wax - dollish young person , no older than Alicia herself , with flaxen ringlets , and a perpetual giggle ; for I am sorry to say that Miss Audley 's animus caused her thus to describe that pretty musical laugh which had been so much admired in the late Miss Lucy Graham — when , I say , these documents reached Robert Audley — they elicited neither vexation nor astonishment in the lymphatic nature of that gentleman . He read Alicia 's angry crossed and recrossed letter without so much as removing the amber mouth - piece of his German pipe from his mustached lips . When he had finished the perusal of the epistle , which he read with his dark eyebrows elevated to the center of his forehead ( his only manner of expressing surprise , by the way ) he deliberately threw that and the wedding cards into the waste - paper basket , and putting down his pipe , prepared himself for the exertion of thinking out the subject . "
14487	14739	14478	14478	I	0	" he muttered , after about half an hour 's revery . Alicia and my lady , the stepmother , will go at it hammer and tongs . I hope they wo n't quarrel in the hunting season , or say unpleasant things to each other at the dinner - table ; rows always upset a man 's digestion . At about twelve o'clock on the morning following that night upon which the events recorded in my last chapter had taken place , the baronet 's nephew strolled out of the Temple , Blackfriarsward , on his way to the city . He had in an evil hour obliged some necessitous friend by putting the ancient name of Audley across a bill of accommodation , which bill not having been provided for by the drawer , Robert was called upon to pay . For this purpose he sauntered up Ludgate Hill , with his blue necktie fluttering in the hot August air , and thence to a refreshingly cool banking - house in a shady court out of St. Paul 's churchyard , where he made arrangements for selling out a couple of hundred pounds ' worth of consols . He had transacted this business , and was loitering at the corner of the court , waiting for a chance hansom to convey him back to the Temple , when he was almost knocked down by a man of about his own age , who dashed headlong into the narrow opening . "
14754	14765	14766	14766	you	835	" Robert remonstrated , mildly , to the impetuous passenger ; "
14782	14801	14802	14802	Bob	174	" The stranger stopped suddenly , looked very hard at the speaker , and then gasped for breath . "
14804	14818	14802	14802	Bob	174	" he cried , in a tone expressive of the most intense astonishment ; "
14840	14841	14842	14842	I	0	" "
14853	14867	14845	14845	you	174	" said Mr. Audley , calmly scrutinizing the animated face of the other , "
14881	14882	14869	14869	I	0	" "
14885	14892	14869	14869	I	0	" exclaimed the stranger , reproachfully . "
14906	14907	14900	14900	you	174	" "
14913	14953	14957	14957	George	157	" said Robert , with an emphasis by no means usual to him ; and then hooking his arm into that of his friend , he led him into the shady court , saying , with his old indifference , "
14964	15037	14957	14957	George	157	" George Talboys did tell him all about it . He told that very story which he had related ten days before to the pale governess on board the Argus ; and then , hot and breathless , he said that he had twenty thousand pounds or so in his pocket , and that he wanted to bank it at Messrs. — — , who had been his bankers many years before . "
15054	15058	15059	15059	I	0	" said Robert . "
15076	15244	15245	15245	I	0	" They did contrive to settle it in about a quarter of an hour ; and then Robert Audley was for starting off immediately for the Crown and Scepter , at Greenwich , or the Castle , at Richmond , where they could have a bit of dinner , and talk over those good old times when they were together at Eton . But George told his friend that before he went anywhere , before he shaved or broke his fast , or in any way refreshed himself after a night journey from Liverpool by express train , he must call at a certain coffee - house in Bridge street , Westminster , where he expected to find a letter from his wife . As they dashed through Ludgate Hill , Fleet street , and the Strand , in a fast hansom , George Talboys poured into his friend 's ear all those wild hopes and dreams which had usurped such a dominion over his sanguine nature . "
15259	15263	15257	15257	Bob	174	" he said , "
15330	15496	15497	15497	Talboys	157	" added the young man , whose classic lore was not very great . The waiters at the Westminster coffee - house stared at the hollow - eyed , unshaven stranger , with his clothes of colonial cut , and his boisterous , excited manner ; but he had been an old frequenter of the place in his military days , and when they heard who he was they flew to do his bidding . He did not want much — only a bottle of soda - water , and to know if there was a letter at the bar directed to George Talboys . The waiter brought the soda - water before the young men had seated themselves in a shady box near the disused fire - place . No ; there was no letter for that name . The waiter said it with consummate indifference , while he mechanically dusted the little mahogany table . George 's face blanched to a deadly whiteness . "
15499	15503	15497	15497	Talboys	157	" he said ; "
15537	15775	15523	15523	Y	855	" The waiter shrugged his shoulders as he left the room , and returned in three minutes to say that there was no name at all resembling Talboys in the letter rack . There was Brown , and Sanderson , and Pinchbeck ; only three letters altogether . The young man drank his soda - water in silence , and then , leaning his elbows on the table , covered his face with his hands . There was something in his manner which told Robert Audley that his disappointment , trifling as it may appear , was in reality a very bitter one . He seated himself opposite to his friend , but did not attempt to address him . By - and - by George looked up , and mechanically taking a greasy Times newspaper of the day before from a heap of journals on the table , stared vacantly at the first page . I can not tell how long he sat blankly staring at one paragraph among the list of deaths , before his dazed brain took in its full meaning ; but after considerable pause he pushed the newspaper over to Robert Audley , and with a face that had changed from its dark bronze to a sickly , chalky grayish white , and with an awful calmness in his manner , he pointed with his finger to a line which ran thus : "
15795	15804	15789	15790	Helen Talboys	179	" Yes , there it was in black and white—"Helen
15810	16174	15789	15790	Helen Talboys	179	" When George told the governess on board the Argus that if he heard any evil tidings of his wife he should drop down dead , he spoke in perfect good faith ; and yet , here were the worst tidings that could come to him , and he sat rigid , white and helpless , staring stupidly at the shocked face of his friend . The suddenness of the blow had stunned him . In this strange and bewildered state of mind he began to wonder what had happened , and why it was that one line in the Times newspaper could have so horrible an effect upon him . Then by degrees even this vague consciousness of his misfortune faded slowly out of his mind , succeeded by a painful consciousness of external things . The hot August sunshine , the dusty window - panes and shabby - painted blinds , a file of fly - blown play - bills fastened to the wall , the black and empty fire - places , a bald - headed old man nodding over the Morning Advertizer , the slip - shod waiter folding a tumbled table - cloth , and Robert Audley 's handsome face looking at him full of compassionate alarm — he knew that all these things took gigantic proportions , and then , one by one , melted into dark blots and swam before his eyes , He knew that there was a great noise , as of half a dozen furious steam - engines tearing and grinding in his ears , and he knew nothing more — except that somebody or something fell heavily to the ground . He opened his eyes upon the dusky evening in a cool and shaded room , the silence only broken by the rumbling of wheels at a distance . He looked about him wonderingly , but half indifferently . His old friend , Robert Audley , was seated by his side smoking . George was lying on a low iron bedstead opposite to an open window , in which there was a stand of flowers and two or three birds in cages . "
16187	16194	16183	16183	you	856	" his friend asked , quietly . "
16197	16223	16183	16183	you	856	" He lay for some time looking at the flowers and the birds ; one canary was singing a shrill hymn to the setting sun . "
16241	16242	16233	16233	I	0	" "
16252	16288	16245	16245	I	0	" Robert Audley knocked the ashes out of his pipe , laid the precious meerschaum tenderly upon the mantelpiece , and going into the next room , returned presently with a cup of strong tea . "
16294	16313	16292	16292	George	157	" he said , as he placed the cup on a little table close to George 's pillow ; "
16321	16345	16346	16346	Bob	174	" The young man did not answer , but looked slowly round the room , and then at his friend 's grave face . "
16348	16352	16346	16346	Bob	174	" he said , "
16357	16358	16346	16346	Bob	174	" "
16392	16416	16422	16422	Bob	174	" George passed his hand once or twice across his forehead , and then , in a hesitating manner , said , quietly : "
16428	16429	16422	16422	Bob	174	" "
16442	16443	16475	16475	Helen	179	" "
16448	16468	16475	16475	Helen	179	" cried George , impatiently , raising himself upon the bed , and staring about him with hollow eyes . "
16494	16495	16496	16496	George	157	" "
16498	16514	16496	16496	George	157	" said Robert Audley , laying his hand gently upon the young man 's arm , "
16543	16544	16540	16541	Helen Talboys	179	" "
16549	16553	16540	16541	Helen Talboys	179	" he cried ; "
16568	16569	16561	16561	Talboys	179	" "
16578	16579	16576	16576	Talbot	180	" "
16591	16612	16615	16615	you	157	" He shook off Robert 's restraining hand , and rising from the bed , walked straight to the door . "
16618	16623	16615	16615	you	157	" exclaimed his friend . "
16632	16633	16615	16615	you	157	" "
16660	16825	16646	16646	I	0	" Robert led him back to the bed , and gently forced him to lie down again . He then gave him an opiate , which had been left for him by the medical man whom they had called in at the coffee - house in Bridge street , when George fainted . So George Talboys fell into a heavy slumber , and dreamed that he went to Ventnor , to find his wife alive and happy , but wrinkled , old , and gray , and to find his son grown into a young man . Early the next morning he was seated opposite to Robert Audley in the first - class carriage of an express , whirling through the pretty open country toward Portsmouth . They landed at Ventnor under the burning heat of the midday sun . As the two young men came from the steamer , the people on the pier stared at George 's white face and untrimmed beard . "
16834	16839	16832	16832	George	157	" Robert Audley asked . "
16853	16910	16840	16840	We	874	" The young man looked at him with a pitiful , bewildered expression . The big dragoon was as helpless as a baby ; and Robert Audley , the most vacillating and unenergetic of men , found himself called upon to act for another . He rose superior to himself , and equal to the occasion . "
16928	16932	16926	16926	George	181	" he said . "
16940	16944	16945	16945	he	481	" George muttered ; "
16956	17208	16945	16945	he	481	" They said nothing more ; but Robert walked straight to a hotel where he inquired for a Mr. Maldon . Yes , they told him , there was a gentleman of that name stopping at Ventnor , a Captain Maldon ; his daughter was lately dead . The waiter would go and inquire for the address . The hotel was a busy place at this season ; people hurrying in and out , and a great bustle of grooms and waiters about the halls . George Talboys leaned against the doorpost , with much the same look in his face , as that which had frightened his friend in the Westminister coffee - house . The worst was confirmed now . His wife , Captain Maldon 's daughter was dead . The waiter returned in about five minutes to say that Captain Maldon was lodging at Lansdowne Cottage , No . 4 . They easily found the house , a shabby , low - windowed cottage , looking toward the water . Was Captain Maldon at home ? No , the landlady said ; he had gone out on the beach with his little grandson . Would the gentleman walk in and sit down a bit ? George mechanically followed his friend into the little front parlor — dusty , shabbily furnished , and disorderly , with a child 's broken toys scattered on the floor , and the scent of stale tobacco hanging about the muslin window - curtains . "
17211	17375	16945	16945	he	481	" said George , pointing to a picture over the mantelpiece . It was his own portrait , painted in the old dragooning days . A pretty good likeness , representing him in uniform , with his charger in the background . Perhaps the most animated of men would have been scarcely so wise a comforter as Robert Audley . He did not utter a word to the stricken widower , but quietly seated himself with his back to George , looking out of the open window . For some time the young man wandered restlessly about the room , looking at and sometimes touching the nick - nacks lying here and there . Her workbox , with an unfinished piece of work ; her album full of extracts from Byron and Moore , written in his own scrawling hand ; some books which he had given her , and a bunch of withered flowers in a vase they had bought in Italy . "
17387	17391	17376	17376	Her	879	" he muttered ; "
17401	17417	17395	17395	they	880	" By - and - by he said , after about an hour 's silence : "
17437	17550	17553	17553	he	883	" He broke down , and buried his face in his hands . Robert summoned the landlady . She was a good - natured garrulous creature , accustomed to sickness and death , for many of her lodgers came to her to die . She told all the particulars of Mrs. Talboys ' last hours ; how she had come to Ventnor only ten days before her death , in the last stage of decline ; and how , day by day , she had gradually , but surely , sunk under the fatal malady . Was the gentleman any relative ? she asked of Robert Audley , as George sobbed aloud . "
17560	17561	17553	17553	he	883	" "
17564	17569	17570	17570	him	883	" the woman cried ; "
17608	17609	17604	17604	his	183	" "
17616	17634	17610	17610	I	0	" George cried out ; and then he told the history of his three years ' struggle . "
17641	17645	17647	17647	she	673	" he asked ; "
17658	17659	17647	17647	she	673	" "
17743	17744	17745	17745	Her	673	" "
17755	17759	17745	17745	Her	673	" said George . "
17778	17868	17763	17763	she	673	" The woman took him into the little bedroom in which his wife had died . He knelt down by the bed and kissed the pillow tenderly , the landlady crying as he did so . While he was kneeling , praying , perhaps , with his face buried in this humble , snow - white pillow , the woman took something from a drawer . She gave it to him when he rose from his knees ; it was a long tress of hair wrapped in silver paper . "
17880	17884	17869	17869	I	0	" she said , "
17888	17898	17869	17869	I	0	" He pressed the soft lock to his lips . "
17901	17905	17869	17869	I	0	" he murmured ; "
17944	17945	17964	17964	they	896	" "
17951	17956	17964	17964	they	896	" said the landlady . "
17984	18281	17972	17974	my little boy	897	" So George Talboys and his faithful friend walked to the quiet spot , where , beneath a mound of earth , to which the patches of fresh turf hardly adhered , lay that wife of whose welcoming smile George had dreamed so often in the far antipodes . Robert left the young man by the side of this newly - made grave , and returning in about a quarter of an hour , found that he had not once stirred . He looked up presently , and said that if there was a stone - mason 's anywhere near he should like to give an order . They very easily found the stonemason , and sitting down amidst the fragmentary litter of the man 's yard , George Talboys wrote in pencil this brief inscription for the headstone of his dead wife 's grave : Sacred to the Memory of HELEN , THE BELOVED WIFE OF GEORGE TALBOYS , Who departed this life August 24th , 18 — , aged 22 , Deeply regretted by her sorrowing Husband . When they returned to Lansdowne Cottage they found the old man had not yet come in , so they walked down to the beach to look for him . After a brief search they found him , sitting upon a heap of pebbles , reading a newspaper and eating filberts . The little boy was at some distance from his grandfather , digging in the sand with a wooden spade . The crape round the old man 's shabby hat , and the child 's poor little black frock , went to George 's heart . Go where he would he met fresh confirmation of this great grief of his life . His wife was dead . "
18285	18382	18282	18283	Mr. Maldon	182	" he said , as he approached his father - in - law . The old man looked up , and , dropping his newspaper , rose from the pebbles with a ceremonious bow . His faded light hair was tinged with gray ; he had a pinched hook nose ; watery blue eyes , and an irresolute - looking mouth ; he wore his shabby dress with an affectation of foppish gentility ; an eye - glass dangled over his closely buttoned - up waistcoat , and he carried a cane in his ungloved hand . "
18386	18390	18393	18393	you	182	" cried George , "
18397	18422	18393	18393	you	182	" Mr. Maldon started and colored violently , with something of a frightened look , as he recognized his son - in - law . "
18427	18431	18393	18393	you	182	" he said , "
18466	18474	18461	18461	you	0	" he said , appealing to Robert . "
18478	18483	18488	18488	you	182	" exclaimed George Talboys , "
18525	18526	18520	18520	you	182	" "
18531	18542	18520	18520	you	182	" muttered the old man , wiping his bloodshot eyes ; "
18565	18566	18556	18556	you	182	" "
18571	18583	18568	18568	I	0	" cried George , in an outburst of grief and passion , "
18634	18664	18665	18665	I	0	" He began to walk up and down the beach , his father - in - law looking helplessly at him , rubbing his feeble eyes with a handkerchief . "
18682	18695	18696	18696	He	907	" thought Robert , as he watched the half - pay lieutenant . "
18712	18746	18696	18696	He	907	" While the agitated young man walked up and down in a fever of regret and despair , the child ran to his grandfather , and clung about the tails of his coat . "
18755	18759	18750	18750	grandpa	910	" he said . "
18764	18796	18760	18760	I	0	" George Talboys turned at the sound of the babyish voice , and looked long and earnestly at the boy . He had his father 's brown eyes and dark hair . "
18803	18814	18760	18760	I	0	" said George , taking the child in his arms , "
18833	18841	18842	18842	I	0	" The little fellow pushed him away . "
18848	18852	18842	18842	I	0	" he said . "
18862	18863	18857	18858	Mrs. Monks	186	" "
18874	18880	18869	18869	his	187	" said the old man . "
18886	19017	18881	18881	He	187	" They walked slowly back to the cottage , and once more George Talboys told the history of that desertion which had seemed so cruel . He told , too , of the twenty thousand pounds banked by him the day before . He had not the heart to ask any questions about the past , and his father - in - law only told him that a few months after his departure they had gone from the place where George left them to live at Southampton , where Helen got a few pupils for the piano , and where they managed pretty well till her health failed , and she fell into the decline of which she died . Like most sad stories it was a very brief one . "
19028	19036	19018	19019	The boy	5049	" said George , after a pause . "
19041	19054	19018	19019	The boy	5049	" answered the old man , smoothing the child 's curling hair ; "
19065	19066	19057	19057	Georgey	187	" "
19146	19147	19126	19126	I	0	" "
19159	19164	19155	19155	yourself	918	" asked Robert Audley . "
19210	19224	19208	19208	Bob	174	" The old man 's weak eyes sparkled as George declared this determination . "
19235	19239	19229	19229	I	0	" he said , "
19258	19271	19272	19272	You	926	" He hesitated and broke down as Robert looked earnestly at him . "
19295	19301	19289	19289	I	0	" he said , gravely . "
19334	19335	19336	19336	I	0	" "
19355	19359	19336	19336	I	0	" said Robert . "
19368	19372	19361	19361	I	0	" cried George ; "
19449	19450	19452	19452	he	927	" "
19473	19478	19479	19479	he	927	" Were they poor ? "
19482	19493	19479	19479	he	927	" were they pinched for money while she was ill ? "
19494	19499	19500	19501	the woman	5008	" Oh , no ! "
19504	19528	19500	19501	the woman	5008	" though the captain dresses shabby , he has always plenty of sovereigns in his purse . The poor lady wanted for nothing . "
19629	19649	19650	19650	he	694	" You did not introduce me to your friend , by - the - bye , my dear boy , "
19703	19707	19709	19709	George	157	" To think , "
19711	19750	19709	19709	George	157	" that two nights ago , at this time , I was steaming into Liverpool , full of the hope of clasping her to my heart , and to - night I am going away from her grave ! "
19775	19782	19784	19784	Robert	173	" It 's a great responsibility , "
19786	19808	19784	19784	Robert	173	" I , guardian to anybody or anything ! I , who never in my life could take care of myself ! "
19809	19819	19821	19821	George	157	" I trust in your noble heart , Bob , "
19823	19871	19821	19821	George	157	" I know you will take care of my poor orphan boy , and see that he is well used by his grandfather . I shall only draw enough from Georgey 's fortune to take me back to Sydney , and then begin my old work again . "
20282	20461	20270	20270	Alicia	149	" MY DEAR ROBERT — How cruel of you to run away to that horrid St. Petersburg before the hunting season ! I have heard that people lose their noses in that disagreeable climate , and as yours is rather a long one , I should advise you to return before the very severe weather sets in . What sort of person is this Mr. Talboys ? If he is very agreeable you may bring him to the Court as soon as you return from your travels . Lady Audley tells me to request you to secure her a set of sables . You are not to consider the price , but to be sure that they are the handsomest that can be obtained . Papa is perfectly absurd about his new wife , and she and I can not get on together at all ; not that she is disagreeable to me , for , as far as that goes , she makes herself agreeable to every one ; but she is so irretrievably childish and silly . "
20471	20476	20469	20469	Robert	173	" Your affectionate cousin , "
20480	20677	20477	20478	ALICIA AUDLEY	149	" The first year of George Talboys ' widowhood passed away , the deep band of crepe about his hat grew brown and dusty , and as the last burning day of another August faded out , he sat smoking cigars in the quiet chambers of Figtree Court , much as he had done the year before , when the horror of his grief was new to him , and every object in life , however trifling or however important , seemed saturated with his one great sorrow . But the big ex - dragoon had survived his affliction by a twelvemonth , and hard as it may be to have to tell it , he did not look much the worse for it . Heaven knows what wasted agonies of remorse and self - reproach may not have racked George 's honest heart , as he lay awake at nights thinking of the wife he had abandoned in the pursuit of a fortune , which she never lived to share . Once , while they were abroad , Robert Audley ventured to congratulate him upon his recovered spirits . He burst into a bitter laugh . "
20684	20688	20679	20679	you	974	" he said , "
20799	20895	20791	20791	I	0	" The travelers returned from St. Petersburg in the spring , and George again took up his quarters at his old friend 's chambers , only leaving them now and then to run down to Southampton and take a look at his little boy . He always went loaded with toys and sweetmeats to give to the child ; but , for all this , Georgey would not become very familiar with his papa , and the young man 's heart sickened as he began to fancy that even his child was lost to him . "
20901	20905	20898	20898	I	0	" he thought . "
20990	21131	21132	21132	I	0	" So the anniversary of that 30th of August , upon which George had seen the advertisement of his wife 's death in the Times newspaper , came round for the first time , and the young man put off his black clothes and the shabby crape from his hat , and laid his mournful garments in a trunk in which he kept a packet of his wife 's letters , her portrait , and that lock of hair which had been cut from her head after death . Robert Audley had never seen either the letters , the portrait , or the long tress of silky hair ; nor , indeed , had George ever mentioned the name of his dead wife after that one day at Ventnor , on which he learned the full particulars of her decease . "
21145	21158	21143	21143	George	157	" the young barrister said , upon this very 30th of August . "
21196	21197	21202	21202	Bob	174	" "
21219	21220	21215	21215	I	0	" "
21248	21249	21238	21238	George	157	" "
21258	21259	21251	21251	I	0	" "
21269	21277	21262	21262	you	157	" cried Robert , with charming naivete . "
21396	21397	21394	21394	George	157	" "
21406	21499	21394	21394	George	157	" The quiet form his grief had taken after its first brief violence , left him as submissive as a child to the will of his friend ; ready to go anywhere or do anything ; never enjoying himself , or originating any enjoyment , but joining in the pleasures of others with a hopeless , uncomplaining , unobtrusive resignation peculiar to his simple nature . But the return of post brought a letter from Alicia Audley , to say that the two young men could not be received at the Court . "
21508	21520	21394	21394	George	157	" wrote the young lady , in an indignant running hand , "
21611	21612	21613	21614	My lady	468	" "
21630	21649	21650	21650	I	0	" said Robert , as he twisted the letter into a pipe - light for his big meerschaum . "
21725	21765	21768	21768	Alicia	149	" He held the twisted letter to the feeble spark of fire glimmering in the grate , as he spoke , and then changing his mind , deliberately unfolded it , and smoothed the crumpled paper with his hand . "
21770	21776	21768	21768	Alicia	149	" he said , thoughtfully ; "
21792	22664	21788	21788	I'll	0	" upon which Mr. Robert Audley put the note back into its envelope , and afterward thrust it into a pigeon - hole in his office desk , marked important . Heaven knows what wonderful documents there were in this particular pigeon - hole , but I do not think it likely to have contained anything of great judicial value . If any one could at that moment have told the young barrister that so simple a thing as his cousin 's brief letter would one day come to be a link in that terrible chain of evidence afterward to be slowly forged in the only criminal case in which he was ever to be concerned , perhaps Mr. Robert Audley would have lifted his eyebrows a little higher than usual . So the two young men left London the next day , with one portmanteau and a rod and tackle between them , and reached the straggling , old - fashioned , fast - decaying village of Audley , in time to order a good dinner at the Sun Inn . Audley Court was about three - quarters of a mile from the village , lying , as I have said , deep down in the hollow , shut in by luxuriant timber . You could only reach it by a cross - road bordered by trees , and as trimly kept as the avenues in a gentleman 's park . It was a lonely place enough , even in all its rustic beauty , for so bright a creature as the late Miss Lucy Graham , but the generous baronet had transformed the interior of the gray old mansion into a little palace for his young wife , and Lady Audley seemed as happy as a child surrounded by new and costly toys . In her better fortunes , as in her old days of dependence , wherever she went she seemed to take sunshine and gladness with her . In spite of Miss Alicia 's undisguised contempt for her step - mother 's childishness and frivolity , Lucy was better loved and more admired than the baronet 's daughter . That very childishness had a charm which few could resist . The innocence and candor of an infant beamed in Lady Audley 's fair face , and shone out of her large and liquid blue eyes . The rosy lips , the delicate nose , the profusion of fair ringlets , all contributed to preserve to her beauty the character of extreme youth and freshness . She owned to twenty years of age , but it was hard to believe her more than seventeen . Her fragile figure , which she loved to dress in heavy velvets , and stiff , rustling silks , till she looked like a child tricked out for a masquerade , was as girlish as if she had just left the nursery . All her amusements were childish . She hated reading , or study of any kind , and loved society . Rather than be alone , she would admit Phoebe Marks into her confidence , and loll on one of the sofas in her luxurious dressing - room , discussing a new costume for some coming dinner - party ; or sit chattering to the girl with her jewel - box beside her , upon the satin cushions , and Sir Michael 's presents spread out in her lap , while she counted and admired her treasures . She had appeared at several public balls at Chelmsford and Colchester , and was immediately established as the belle of the county . Pleased with her high position and her handsome house ; with every caprice gratified , every whim indulged ; admired and caressed wherever she went ; fond of her generous husband ; rich in a noble allowance of pin - money ; with no poor relations to worry her with claims upon her purse or patronage ; it would have been hard to find in the County of Essex a more fortunate creature than Lucy , Lady Audley . The two young men loitered over the dinner - table in the private sitting - room at the Sun Inn . The windows were thrown wide open , and the fresh country air blew in upon them as they dined . The weather was lovely ; the foliage of the woods touched here and there with faint gleams of the earliest tints of autumn ; the yellow corn still standing in some of the fields , in others just falling under the shining sickle ; while in the narrow lanes you met great wagons drawn by broad - chested cart - horses , carrying home the rich golden store . To any one who has been , during the hot summer months , pent up in London , there is in the first taste of rustic life a kind of sensuous rapture scarcely to be described . George Talboys felt this , and in this he experienced the nearest approach to enjoyment that he had ever known since his wife 's death . The clock struck five as they finished dinner . "
22672	22677	22670	22670	George	157	" said Robert Audley ; "
22704	22728	22729	22729	I	0	" The landlord , who had come into the room with a bottle of wine , looked up as the young man spoke . "
22737	22741	22729	22729	I	0	" he said , "
22806	23162	23167	23168	my uncle	991	" Under these circumstances of course it was no use going to the Court , so the two young men strolled through the village and looked at the old church , and then went and reconnoitered the streams in which they were to fish the next day , and by such means beguiled the time until after seven o'clock . At about a quarter past that hour they returned to the inn , and seating themselves in the open window , lit their cigars and looked out at the peaceful prospect . We hear every day of murders committed in the country . Brutal and treacherous murders ; slow , protracted agonies from poisons administered by some kindred hand ; sudden and violent deaths by cruel blows , inflicted with a stake cut from some spreading oak , whose every shadow promised — peace . In the county of which I write , I have been shown a meadow in which , on a quiet summer Sunday evening , a young farmer murdered the girl who had loved and trusted him ; and yet , even now , with the stain of that foul deed upon it , the aspect of the spot is — peace . No species of crime has ever been committed in the worst rookeries about Seven Dials that has not been also done in the face of that rustic calm which still , in spite of all , we look on with a tender , half - mournful yearning , and associate with — peace . It was dusk when gigs and chaises , dog - carts and clumsy farmers ' phaetons , began to rattle through the village street , and under the windows of the Sun Inn ; deeper dusk still when an open carriage and four drew suddenly up beneath the rocking sign - post . It was Sir Michael Audley 's barouche which came to so sudden a stop before the little inn . The harness of one of the leaders had become out of order , and the foremost postillion dismounted to set it right . "
23170	23180	23181	23181	I	0	" cried Robert Audley , as the carriage stopped . "
23190	23273	23181	23181	I	0	" George lit another cigar , and , sheltered by the window - curtains , looked out at the little party . Alicia sat with her back to the horses , and he could perceive , even in the dusk , that she was a handsome brunette ; but Lady Audley was seated on the side of the carriage furthest from the inn , and he could see nothing of the fair - haired paragon of whom he had heard so much . "
23278	23291	23276	23276	Robert	173	" exclaimed Sir Michael , as his nephew emerged from the inn , "
23297	23298	23299	23299	I	0	" "
23315	23335	23299	23299	I	0	" said the young man , as the baronet shook him by the hand in his own hearty fashion . "
23377	23378	23379	23379	George	157	" "
23384	23385	23381	23381	George	157	" "
23389	23390	23386	23387	George Talboys	157	" "
23397	23401	23402	23402	I	0	" cried Alicia . "
23418	23419	23413	23416	this handsome young widower	1026	" "
23425	23430	23423	23423	Alicia	149	" said her cousin , "
23449	23551	23423	23423	Alicia	149	" Now , so complete was the dominion which Lady Audley had , in her own childish , unthinking way , obtained over her devoted husband , that it was very rarely that the baronet 's eyes were long removed from his wife 's pretty face . When Robert , therefore , was about to re - enter the inn , it needed but the faintest elevation of Lucy 's eyebrows , with a charming expression of weariness and terror , to make her husband aware that she did not want to be bored by an introduction to Mr. George Talboys . "
23560	23564	23558	23558	Bob	174	" he said . "
23614	23641	23642	23642	You	174	" My lady was so terribly fatigued that she could only smile sweetly , and hold out a tiny gloved hand to her nephew by marriage . "
23659	23695	23642	23642	You	174	" she said , in a low and tired voice . She had been the chief attraction of the race - course , and was wearied out by the exertion of fascinating half the county . "
23712	23731	23700	23700	she	150	" whispered Alicia , as she leaned over the carriage - door to bid Robert good - night ; "
23757	23766	23746	23746	I	0	" added the young lady , rather snappishly . "
23775	23783	23767	23767	She	150	" murmured Robert , with placid admiration . "
23822	23869	23819	23820	wax dolls	1035	" Poor Alicia had had many skirmishes with her cousin upon that particular temperament of his , which , while it enabled him to go through life with perfect content and tacit enjoyment , entirely precluded his feeling one spark of enthusiasm upon any subject whatever . "
23878	23885	23819	23820	wax dolls	1035	" thought the young lady sometimes , "
23932	23946	23947	23947	She	1038	" But , for once in his life , Robert was almost enthusiastic . "
23962	23979	23960	23960	George	157	" he cried , when the carriage had driven off and he returned to his friend . "
24042	24436	24437	24437	I	0	" The widower only sighed and puffed his cigar fiercely out of the open window . Perhaps he was thinking of that far - away time — little better than five years ago , in fact ; but such an age gone by to him — when he first met the woman for whom he had worn crape round his hat three days before . They returned , all those old unforgotten feelings ; they came back , with the scene of their birth - place . Again he lounged with his brother officers upon the shabby pier at the shabby watering - place , listening to a dreary band with a cornet that was a note and a half flat . Again he heard the old operatic airs , and again she came tripping toward him , leaning on her old father 's arm , and pretending ( with such a charming , delicious , serio - comic pretense ) to be listening to the music , and quite unaware of the admiration of half a dozen open - mouthed cavalry officers . Again the old fancy came back that she was something too beautiful for earth , or earthly uses , and that to approach her was to walk in a higher atmosphere and to breathe a purer air . And since this she had been his wife , and the mother of his child . She lay in the little churchyard at Ventnor , and only a year ago he had given the order for her tombstone . A few slow , silent tears dropped upon his waistcoat as he thought of these things in the quiet and darkening room . Lady Audley was so exhausted when she reached home , that she excused herself from the dinner - table , and retired at once to her dressing - room , attended by her maid , Phoebe Marks . She was a little capricious in her conduct to this maid — sometimes very confidential , sometimes rather reserved ; but she was a liberal mistress , and the girl had every reason to be satisfied with her situation . This evening , in spite of her fatigue , she was in extremely high spirits , and gave an animated account of the races , and the company present at them . "
24447	24457	24445	24445	Phoebe	166	" she said , by - and - by . "
24476	24525	24526	24526	You	166	" There were lighted candles on each side of the glass before which Lady Audley was standing unfastening her dress . She looked full at her maid as she spoke , her blue eyes clear and bright , and the rosy childish lips puckered into an arch smile . "
24535	24540	24526	24526	You	166	" answered the girl , "
24549	24550	24542	24542	you	166	" "
24557	24593	24555	24555	Phoebe	166	" she said , flinging herself into a chair , and throwing back her curls at the maid , who stood , brush in hand , ready to arrange the luxuriant hair for the night . "
24613	24614	24603	24604	some people	4635	" "
24627	24633	24618	24618	them	4635	" said the girl , quietly "
24660	24661	24654	24658	a poor , plain creature	1046	" "
24668	24676	24654	24658	a poor , plain creature	1046	" said the little lady , superbly ; "
24793	24881	24791	24791	Phoebe	166	" She prattled on in this way for a long time , talking of a hundred different subjects , and ridiculing the people she had met at the races , for her maid 's amusement . Her step - daughter came into the dressing - room to bid her good - night , and found the maid and mistress laughing aloud over one of the day 's adventures . Alicia , who was never familiar with her servants , withdrew in disgust at my lady 's frivolity . "
24890	24906	24888	24888	Phoebe	166	" Lady Audley said , every time the girl was about to complete her task , "
24915	24933	24934	24935	Phoebe Marks	166	" At last , just as she had dismissed her maid , she suddenly called her back . "
24937	24941	24934	24935	Phoebe Marks	166	" she said , "
24951	24952	24944	24944	you	166	" "
24958	24959	24944	24944	you	166	" "

25033	25034	25030	25031	my lady	468	" "
25054	25086	25030	25031	my lady	468	" The girl obeyed . Lady Audley smoothed her maid 's neutral - tinted hair with her plump , white , and bejeweled hand as she reflected for a few moments . "
25103	25158	25094	25094	I	0	" It was so simple that it was told in five minutes , and then Lady Audley retired into her bed - room , and curled herself up cozily under the eider - down quilt . She was a chilly creature , and loved to bury herself in soft wrappings of satin and fur . "
25164	25175	25162	25162	Phoebe	166	" she said , as the girl arranged the curtains . "
25229	25270	25220	25221	Madam Frederick	191	" It was late the next morning when Lady Audley went down to breakfast — past ten o'clock . While she was sipping her coffee a servant brought her a sealed packet , and a book for her to sign . "
25275	25290	25220	25221	Madam Frederick	191	" she cried ; for the convenient word telegram had not yet been invented . "
25297	25344	25220	25221	Madam Frederick	191	" She looked up at her husband with wide - open , terrified eyes , and seemed half afraid to break the seal . The envelope was addressed to Miss Lucy Graham , at Mr. Dawson 's , and had been sent on from the village . "
25351	25355	25220	25221	Madam Frederick	191	" he said , "
25370	25409	25410	25411	Poor soul	1056	" It came from a Mrs. Vincent , the schoolmistress with whom she had lived before entering Mr. Dawson 's family . The lady was dangerously ill , and implored her old pupil to go and see her . "
25422	25431	25413	25413	she	1056	" said Lucy , with a mournful smile . "
25453	25454	25443	25445	Dear Sir Michael	146	" "
25505	25506	25507	25507	You	0	" "
25513	25514	25507	25507	You	0	" "
25531	25532	25522	25522	you	0	" "
25542	25548	25533	25533	I	0	" she said , thoughtfully . "
25556	25557	25561	25561	she	5065	" "
25579	25909	25574	25574	she	5065	" There was only time for Lady Audley to hurry on her bonnet and shawl before she heard the carriage drive round to the door , and Sir Michael calling to her at the foot of the staircase . Her suite of rooms , as I have said , opened one out of another , and terminated in an octagon antechamber hung with oil - paintings . Even in her haste she paused deliberately at the door of this room , double - locked it , and dropped the key into her pocket . This door once locked cut off all access to my lady 's apartments . So the dinner at Audley Court was postponed , and Miss Alicia had to wait still longer for an introduction to the handsome young widower , Mr. George Talboys . I am afraid , if the real truth is to be told , there was , perhaps , something of affectation in the anxiety this young lady expressed to make George 's acquaintance ; but if poor Alicia for a moment calculated upon arousing any latent spark of jealousy lurking in her cousin 's breast by this exhibition of interest , she was not so well acquainted with Robert Audley 's disposition as she might have been . Indolent , handsome , and indifferent , the young barrister took life as altogether too absurd a mistake for any one event in its foolish course to be for a moment considered seriously by a sensible man . His pretty , gipsy - faced cousin might have been over head and ears in love with him ; and she might have told him so , in some charming , roundabout , womanly fashion , a hundred times a day for all the three hundred and sixty - five days in the year ; but unless she had waited for some privileged 29th of February , and walked straight up to him , saying , "
25918	26290	25910	25910	Robert	173	" I very much doubt if he would ever have discovered the state of her feelings . Again , had he been in love with her himself , I fancy that the tender passion would , with him , have been so vague and feeble a sentiment that he might have gone down to his grave with a dim sense of some uneasy sensation which might be love or indigestion , and with , beyond this , no knowledge whatever of his state . So it was not the least use , my poor Alicia , to ride about the lanes around Audley during those three days which the two young men spent in Essex ; it was wasted trouble to wear that pretty cavalier hat and plume , and to be always , by the most singular of chances , meeting Robert and his friend . The black curls ( nothing like Lady Audley 's feathery ringlets , but heavy clustering locks , that clung about your slender brown throat ) , the red and pouting lips , the nose inclined to be retrousse , the dark complexion , with its bright crimson flush , always ready to glance up like a signal light in a dusky sky , when you came suddenly upon your apathetic cousin — all this coquettish espiegle , brunette beauty was thrown away upon the dull eyes of Robert Audley , and you might as well have taken your rest in the cool drawing - room at the Court , instead of working your pretty mare to death under the hot September sun . Now fishing , except to the devoted disciple of Izaak Walton , is not the most lively of occupations ; therefore , it is scarcely , perhaps , to be wondered that on the day after Lady Audley 's departure , the two young men ( one of whom was disabled by that heart wound which he bore so quietly , from really taking pleasure in anything , and the other of whom looked upon almost all pleasure as a negative kind of trouble ) began to grow weary of the shade of the willows overhanging the winding streams about Audley . "
26301	26307	26309	26309	I	0	" said Robert , reflectively : "
26333	26384	26385	26385	I	0	" he added , puffing resignedly at an execrable cigar procured from the landlord of the Sun Inn . George Talboys , who had only consented to the Essex expedition in passive submission to his friend , was by no means inclined to object to their immediate return to London . "
26395	26399	26393	26393	Bob	174	" he said , "
26424	26432	26433	26435	the little one	1063	" He always spoke of his son as "
26437	26491	26433	26435	the little one	1063	" always spoke of him mournfully rather than hopefully . He accounted for this by saying that he had a fancy that the child would never learn to love him ; and worse even than this fancy , a dim presentiment that he would not live to see his little Georgey reach manhood . "
26501	26507	26499	26499	Bob	174	" he would say sometimes , "
26640	26663	26664	26665	George Talboys	157	" Robert Audley stared at his friend in silent amazement ; and , after a pause of profound deliberation , said solemnly , "
26726	26732	26733	26733	I	0	" he added , suddenly , "
26753	26810	26811	26811	You	157	" They met Alicia Audley on her mare about half an hour after they had come to the determination of leaving Essex early the next morning . The young lady was very much surprised and disappointed at hearing her cousin 's determination , and for that very reason pretended to take the matter with supreme indifference . "
26821	26827	26819	26819	Robert	173	" she said , carelessly ; "
26859	26860	26861	26861	I	0	" "
26866	26874	26861	26861	I	0	" murmured Robert , interrupting his cousin . "
26898	26899	26896	26896	Alicia	149	" "
26910	26911	26901	26901	you	157	" "
26923	26924	26896	26896	Alicia	149	" "
26951	26952	26945	26949	the prettiest woman in Essex	1080	" "
26955	26959	26945	26949	the prettiest woman in Essex	1080	" stammered George . "
26982	26986	26979	26980	George Talboys	157	" said Robert . "
27027	27028	27029	27029	I	0	" "
27046	27050	27051	27051	She	1084	" said Alicia . "
27082	27118	27119	27119	She	1084	" Miss Audley took a letter from the pocket of her riding - jacket as she spoke — a pretty , fairy - like note , written on shining paper of a peculiar creamy hue . "
27146	27147	27143	27143	Alicia	149	" "
27155	27166	27143	27143	Alicia	149	" said Robert , as his cousin folded the note . "
27183	27222	27181	27181	Robert	173	" She put the letter into his hand , and he contemplated it lazily for a few minutes , while Alicia patted the graceful neck of her chestnut mare , which was anxious to be off once more . "
27237	27238	27235	27235	Bob	174	" "
27372	27410	27367	27367	George	157	" But absent - minded and gloomy George Talboys had strolled away along the margin of the ditch , and stood striking the bulrushes with his cane , half a dozen paces away from Robert and Alicia . "
27413	27436	27367	27367	George	157	" said the young lady , impatiently ; for she by no means relished this long disquisition upon my lady 's note . "
27487	27535	27478	27479	Mr. Talboys	157	" The chestnut mare cantered briskly through the lane , and Miss Audley was out of sight before those two big , bright tears that stood in her eyes for one moment , before her pride sent them , back again , rose from her angry heart . "
27545	27551	27472	27472	Robert	173	" she cried , passionately , "
27575	27677	27569	27569	he	1002	" By the merest of accidents , however , Robert and his friend did not go by the 10.50 express on the following morning , for the young barrister awoke with such a splitting headache , that he asked George to send him a cup of the strongest green tea that had ever been made at the Sun , and to be furthermore so good as to defer their journey until the next day . Of course George assented , and Robert Audley spent the forenoon in a darkened room with a five - days'-old Chelmsford paper to entertain himself withal . "
27687	27693	27685	27685	George	157	" he said , repeatedly . "
27718	27818	27830	27830	George	157	" Fortunately for the peace of Audley , it happened to be market - day at Chelmsford ; and the worthy landlord had ridden off in his chaise - cart to purchase supplies for his house — among other things , perhaps , a fresh stock of those very cigars which had been so fatal in their effect upon Robert . The young men spent a dull , dawdling , stupid , unprofitable day ; and toward dusk Mr. Audley proposed that they should stroll down to the Court , and ask Alicia to take them over the house . "
27866	28079	27854	27854	I	0	" The sun was low in the skies as they took a short cut through the meadows , and crossed a stile into the avenue leading to the archway — a lurid , heavy - looking , ominous sunset , and a deathly stillness in the air , which frightened the birds that had a mind to sing , and left the field open to a few captious frogs croaking in the ditches . Still as the atmosphere was , the leaves rustled with that sinister , shivering motion which proceeds from no outer cause , but is rather an instinctive shudder of the frail branches , prescient of a coming storm . That stupid clock , which knew no middle course , and always skipped from one hour to the other , pointed to seven as the young men passed under the archway ; but , for all that , it was nearer eight . They found Alicia in the lime - walk , wandering listlessly up and down under the black shadow of the trees , from which every now and then a withered leaf flapped slowly to the ground . Strange to say , George Talboys , who very seldom observed anything , took particular notice of this place . "
28090	28094	27854	27854	I	0	" he said . "
28116	28164	28106	28106	I	0	" They walked on to the ruined well ; and Alicia told them some old legend connected with the spot — some gloomy story , such as those always attached to an old house , as if the past were one dark page of sorrow and crime . "
28178	28182	28176	28176	Alicia	149	" said Robert . "
28189	28193	28176	28176	Alicia	149	" she answered . "
28196	28265	28176	28176	Alicia	149	" She led the way through an open French window , modernized a few years before , into the library , and thence to the hall . In the hall they passed my lady 's pale - faced maid , who looked furtively under her white eyelashes at the two young men . They were going up - stairs , when Alicia turned and spoke to the girl . "
28296	28297	28300	28300	miss	1107	" "
28324	28325	28315	28316	my lady	468	" "
28332	28336	28343	28343	she	468	" cried Alicia . "
28362	28363	28364	28364	I	0	" "
28367	28373	28364	28364	I	0	" said Alicia , impatiently , "
28449	28450	28451	28451	Her	468	" "
28454	28459	28451	28451	Her	468	" exclaimed Robert Audley . "
28492	28493	28490	28490	Alicia	149	" "
28497	28498	28490	28490	Alicia	149	" "
28524	28565	28576	28576	he	1119	" His cousin shook her head , and conducted them into a corridor where there were some family portraits . She showed them a tapestried chamber , the large figures upon the faded canvas looking threatening in the dusky light . "
28585	28607	28580	28580	George	157	" said Mr. Audley , pointing to a fierce warrior , whose uplifted arm appeared above George Talboys ' dark hair . "
28616	28624	28614	28614	Alicia	149	" added the young man , nervously ; "
28710	28801	28695	28697	The old lady	1123	" There were lighted candles in the drawing - room . No new - fangled lamps had ever made their appearance at Audley Court . Sir Michael 's rooms were lighted by honest , thick , yellow - looking wax candles , in massive silver candlesticks , and in sconces against the walls . There was very little to see in the drawing - room ; and George Talboys soon grew tired of staring at the handsome modern furniture , and at a few pictures of some of the Academicians . "
28828	28832	28826	28826	Alicia	149	" asked Robert . "
28837	28850	28826	28826	Alicia	149	" cried Miss Audley , with a vehemence that startled her cousin ; "
28872	28873	28866	28866	me	0	" "
28877	28878	28866	28866	me	0	" "
28965	28966	28917	28917	herself	468	" "
28976	28981	28974	28974	George	157	" asked Mr. Audley . "
28989	29051	28974	28974	George	157	" Alicia led them into the room which had once been her nursery . It was now disused , except on very rare occasions when the house was full of company . Robert Audley lifted a corner of the carpet , according to his cousin 's directions , and disclosed a rudely - cut trap - door in the oak flooring . "
29057	29061	29055	29055	me	0	" said Alicia . "
29167	29168	29163	29163	You	1134	" "
29171	29172	29163	29163	You	1134	" "
29219	29648	29216	29216	you	1134	" Robert obeyed her implicitly , and George submissively following his friend , found himself , in five minutes , standing amidst the elegant disorder of Lady Audley 's dressing - room . She had left the house in a hurry on her unlooked - for journey to London , and the whole of her glittering toilette apparatus lay about on the marble dressing - table . The atmosphere of the room was almost oppressive for the rich odors of perfumes in bottles whose gold stoppers had not been replaced . A bunch of hot - house flowers was withering upon a tiny writing - table . Two or three handsome dresses lay in a heap upon the ground , and the open doors of a wardrobe revealed the treasures within . Jewelry , ivory - backed hair - brushes , and exquisite china were scattered here and there about the apartment . George Talboys saw his bearded face and tall , gaunt figure reflected in the glass , and wondered to see how out of place he seemed among all these womanly luxuries . They went from the dressing - room to the boudoir , and through the boudoir into the ante - chamber , in which there were , as Alicia had said , about twenty valuable paintings , besides my lady 's portrait . My lady 's portrait stood on an easel , covered with a green baize in the center of the octagonal chamber . It had been a fancy of the artist to paint her standing in this very room , and to make his background a faithful reproduction of the pictured walls . I am afraid the young man belonged to the pre - Raphaelite brotherhood , for he had spent a most unconscionable time upon the accessories of this picture — upon my lady 's crispy ringlets and the heavy folds of her crimson velvet dress . The two young men looked at the paintings on the walls first , leaving this unfinished portrait for a bonne bouche . By this time it was dark , the candle carried by Robert only making one nucleus of light as he moved about holding it before the pictures one by one . The broad , bare window looked out upon the pale sky , tinged with the last cold flicker of the twilight . The ivy rustled against the glass with the same ominous shiver as that which agitated every leaf in the garden , prophetic of the storm that was to come . "
29658	29667	29668	29669	Nicholas Poussin	194	" said Robert , standing beside a Wouvermans . "
29682	29698	29699	29700	George Talboys	157	" He paused with his hand on the baize , and solemnly addressed his friend . "
29702	29706	29699	29700	George Talboys	157	" he said , "
29787	29878	29884	29884	your	157	" George fell back immediately . He took no more interest in any lady 's picture than in all the other wearinesses of this troublesome world . He fell back , and leaning his forehead against the window - panes , looked out at the night . When he turned round he saw that Robert had arranged the easel very conveniently , and that he had seated himself on a chair before it for the purpose of contemplating the painting at his leisure . He rose as George turned round . "
29889	29893	29884	29884	your	157	" he said . "
29900	30307	29884	29884	your	157	" He took George 's place at the window , and George seated himself in the chair before the easel . Yes , the painter must have been a pre - Raphaelite . No one but a pre - Raphaelite would have painted , hair by hair , those feathery masses of ringlets , with every glimmer of gold , and every shadow of pale brown . No one but a pre - Raphaelite would have so exaggerated every attribute of that delicate face as to give a lurid brightness to the blonde complexion , and a strange , sinister light to the deep blue eyes . No one but a pre - Raphaelite could have given to that pretty pouting mouth the hard and almost wicked look it had in the portrait . It was so like , and yet so unlike . It was as if you had burned strange - colored fires before my lady 's face , and by their influence brought out new lines and new expressions never seen in it before . The perfection of feature , the brilliancy of coloring , were there ; but I suppose the painter had copied quaint mediaeval monstrosities until his brain had grown bewildered , for my lady , in his portrait of her , had something of the aspect of a beautiful fiend . Her crimson dress , exaggerated like all the rest in this strange picture , hung about her in folds that looked like flames , her fair head peeping out of the lurid mass of color as if out of a raging furnace . Indeed the crimson dress , the sunshine on the face , the red gold gleaming in the yellow hair , the ripe scarlet of the pouting lips , the glowing colors of each accessory of the minutely painted background , all combined to render the first effect of the painting by no means an agreeable one . But strange as the picture was , it could not have made any great impression on George Talboys , for he sat before it for about a quarter of an hour without uttering a word — only staring blankly at the painted canvas , with the candlestick grasped in his strong right hand , and his left arm hanging loosely by his side . He sat so long in this attitude , that Robert turned round at last . "
30320	30321	30322	30322	I	0	" "
30326	30327	30322	30322	I	0	" "
30366	30410	30345	30346	George Talboys	157	" Robert Audley took the candle from his friend 's hand , and crept back through the secret passage , followed by George — very quiet , but scarcely more quiet than usual . They found Alicia in the nursery waiting for them . "
30413	30419	30420	30420	We	1143	" she said , interrogatively . "
30440	30441	30426	30426	I	0	" "
30445	30449	30426	30426	I	0	" said Alicia ; "
30527	30528	30529	30529	Alicia	149	" "
30531	30538	30529	30529	Alicia	149	" said Robert Audley , imploringly , "
30544	30545	30548	30548	Robert	173	" "
30550	30551	30548	30548	Robert	173	" "
30598	30724	30741	30742	the gardener	1148	" He repeated this several times with an air of terror that was perfectly sincere ; and then , having borrowed an umbrella in case of being overtaken by the coming storm , left the Court , leading passive George Talboys away with him . The one hand of the stupid clock had skipped to nine by the time they reached the archway ; but before they could pass under its shadow they had to step aside to allow a carriage to dash past them . It was a fly from the village , but Lady Audley 's fair face peeped out at the window . Dark as it was , she could see the two figures of the young men black against the dusk . "
30729	30738	30741	30742	the gardener	1148	" she asked , putting out her head . "
30744	30745	30741	30742	the gardener	1148	" "
30752	30758	30741	30742	the gardener	1148	" said Robert , laughing ; "
30766	30796	30761	30764	your most dutiful nephew	1150	" He and George stopped by the archway while the fly drew up at the door , and the surprised servants came out to welcome their master and mistress . "
30808	30818	30797	30797	I	0	" said the baronet looking up at the sky ; "
30827	30985	30986	30986	George	157	" Sir Michael was mistaken in his prophecy upon the weather . The storm did not hold off until next day , but burst with terrible fury over the village of Audley about half an hour before midnight . Robert Audley took the thunder and lightning with the same composure with which he accepted all the other ills of life . He lay on a sofa in the sitting - room , ostensibly reading the five - days - old Chelmsford paper , and regaling himself occasionally with a few sips from a large tumbler of cold punch . But the storm had quite a different effect upon George Talboys . His friend was startled when he looked at the young man 's white face as he sat opposite the open window listening to the thunder , and staring at the black sky , rent every now and then by forked streaks of steel - blue lightning . "
30988	30999	30986	30986	George	157	" said Robert , after watching him for some time , "
31007	31008	31001	31001	you	157	" "
31011	31017	31001	31001	you	157	" he answered , curtly . "
31057	31058	31051	31051	you	157	" "
31065	31066	31051	31051	you	157	" "

31174	31337	31168	31168	I	0	" cried George , furiously ; having said which , Mr. Talboys strode out of the room , banging the door after him with a violence that shook the house . Those inky clouds , which had shut in the sultry earth as if with a roof of hot iron , poured out their blackness in a sudden deluge as George left the room ; but if the young man was afraid of the lightning , he certainly was not afraid of the rain ; for he walked straight down - stairs to the inn door , and went out into the wet high road . He walked up and down , up and down , in the soaking shower for about twenty minutes , and then , re - entering the inn , strode up to his bedroom . Robert Audley met him on the landing , with his hair beaten about his white face , and his garments dripping wet . "
31346	31347	31339	31339	you	1155	" "
31350	31351	31339	31339	you	1155	" "

31417	31418	31419	31419	You	1155	" "
31432	31486	31430	31430	George	157	" Robert Audley stood in his friend 's way as he spoke , anxious to prevent his going to bed in the state he was in ; but George pushed him fiercely aside , and , striding past him , said , in the same hoarse voice Robert had noticed at the Court : "
31503	31545	31546	31546	He	157	" Robert followed George to his bedroom , but the young man banged the door in his face , so there was nothing for it but to leave Mr. Talboys to himself , to recover his temper as best he might . "
31558	31796	31546	31546	He	157	" thought Robert , as he calmly retired to rest , serenely indifferent to the thunder , which seemed to shake him in his bed , and the lightning playing fitfully round the razors in his open dressing - case . The storm rolled away from the quiet village of Audley , and when Robert awoke the next morning it was to see bright sunshine , and a peep of cloudless sky between the white curtains of his bedroom window . It was one of those serene and lovely mornings that sometimes succeed a storm . The birds sung loud and cheerily , the yellow corn uplifted itself in the broad fields , and waved proudly after its sharp tussle with the tempest , which had done its best to beat down the heavy ears with cruel wind and driving rain half the night through . The vine - leaves clustering round Robert 's window fluttered with a joyous rustling , shaking the rain - drops in diamond showers from every spray and tendril . Robert Audley found his friend waiting for him at the breakfast - table . George was very pale , but perfectly tranquil — if anything , indeed , more cheerful than usual . He shook Robert by the hand with something of that hearty manner for which he had been distinguished before the one affliction of his life overtook and shipwrecked him . "
31802	31808	31800	31800	Bob	174	" he said , frankly , "
31843	31844	31845	31847	Poor old boy	1157	" "
31871	31875	31865	31866	my uncle	991	" asked Robert . "
31928	32365	32366	32368	My pretty one	852	" Robert Audley would have assented to a far more disagreeable proposition than this , rather than have taken the trouble to oppose his friend , so the matter was immediately agreed upon ; and after they had finished their breakfast , and ordered a four o'clock dinner , George Talboys took the fishing - rod across his broad shoulders , and strode out of the house with his friend and companion . But if the equable temperament of Mr. Robert Audley had been undisturbed by the crackling peals of thunder that shook the very foundations of the Sun Inn , it had not been so with the more delicate sensibilties of his uncle 's young wife . Lady Audley confessed herself terribly frightened of the lightning . She had her bedstead wheeled into a corner of the room , and with the heavy curtains drawn tightly round her , she lay with her face buried in the pillow , shuddering convulsively at every sound of the tempest without . Sir Michael , whose stout heart had never known a fear , almost trembled for this fragile creature , whom it was his happy privilege to protect and defend . My lady would not consent to undress till nearly three o'clock in the morning , when the last lingering peal of thunder had died away among the distant hills . Until that hour she lay in the handsome silk dress in which she had traveled , huddled together among the bedclothes , only looking up now and then with a scared face to ask if the storm was over . Toward four o'clock her husband , who spent the night in watching by her bedside , saw her drop off into a deep sleep , from which she did not awake for nearly five hours . But she came into the breakfast - room , at half - past nine o'clock , singing a little Scotch melody , her cheeks tinged with as delicate a pink as the pale hue of her muslin morning dress . Like the birds and the flowers , she seemed to recover her beauty and joyousness in the morning sunshine . She tripped lightly out onto the lawn , gathering a last lingering rosebud here and there , and a sprig or two of geranium , and returning through the dewy grass , warbling long cadences for very happiness of heart , and looking as fresh and radiant as the flowers in her hands . The baronet caught her in his strong arms as she came in through the open window . "
32370	32374	32366	32368	My pretty one	852	" he said , "
32492	32549	32487	32487	you	852	" She stood on tiptoe to kiss him , and then was only tall enough to reach his white beard . She told him , laughing , that she had always been a silly , frightened creature — frightened of dogs , frightened of cattle , frightened of a thunderstorm , frightened of a rough sea . "
32564	32616	32559	32562	noble , handsome husband	1168	" she said . She had found the carpet in her dressing - room disarranged , and had inquired into the mystery of the secret passage . She chid Miss Alicia in a playful , laughing way , for her boldness in introducing two great men into my lady 's rooms . "
32630	32638	32628	32628	Alicia	149	" she said , with mock indignation . "
32660	32661	32662	32662	She	1171	" "
32687	32703	32704	32705	Sir Michael	146	" I shall go up to the Sun , and ask those boys to dinner , "
33401	33410	33394	33394	his	157	" Send that horrid animal away , Alicia , "
33417	33486	33411	33412	Lady Audley	150	" The brute knows that I am frightened of him , and takes advantage of my terror . And yet they call the creatures generous and noble - hearted ! Bah , Caesar ! I hate you , and you hate me ; and if you met me in the dark in some narrow passage you would fly at my throat and strangle me , would n't you ? "
33512	33538	33499	33499	her	468	" Do you know , Lady Audley , that Mr. Talboys , the young widower , has been here asking for Sir Michael and you ? "
33546	33555	33556	33556	she	197	" I thought they were coming to dinner , "
33559	33569	33556	33556	she	197	" Surely we shall have enough of them then . "
33645	33651	33652	33652	she	197	" Take that litter away , "
33678	33688	33690	33691	my lady	468	" What have you been doing all this morning ? "
33693	33702	33690	33691	my lady	468	" Not wasting your time , I hope ? "
33703	33744	33745	33746	The girl	753	" No , my lady , I have been altering the blue dress . It is rather dark on this side of the house , so I took it up to my own room , and worked at the window . "
33788	33792	33798	33798	herself	468	" Phoebe Marks , "
33815	33846	33798	33798	herself	468	" you are a good , industrious girl , and while I live and am prosperous , you shall never want a firm friend or a twenty - pound note . "
34047	34061	34062	34062	he	5094	" Why , the selfish beggar must have gone home to his dinner ! "
34067	34090	34062	34062	he	5094	" and yet that is n't much like him , for he seldom remembers even his meals unless I jog his memory . "
34179	34184	34185	34185	he	173	" This is lively ! "
34188	34200	34185	34185	he	173	" A cold dinner , and nobody to eat it with ! "
34215	34247	34207	34207	himself	1227	" As fine a pair of ducks , Mr. Audley , as ever you clapped eyes on , but burnt up to a cinder , along of being kep ' hot . "
34248	34254	34255	34255	Robert	173	" Never mind the ducks , "
34259	34265	34255	34255	Robert	173	" where 's Mr. Talboys ? "
34266	34283	34207	34207	himself	1227	" He ai n't been in , sir , since you went out together this morning . "
34284	34287	34289	34289	Robert	173	" What ! "
34291	34307	34308	34308	He	173	" Why , in heaven 's name , what has the man done with himself ? "
34454	34473	34475	34477	Mr. Robert Audley	173	" Of all the extraordinary things that ever happened to me in the whole course of my life , "
34479	34486	34487	34491	The landlord still in attendance	1238	" this is the most miraculous ! "
34520	34529	34531	34531	Robert	173	" I shall go and look for him , "
34601	34645	34594	34595	the landlord	5144	" I forgot to tell you , Mr. Audley , as how your uncle called here five minutes after you was gone , and left a message , asking of you and the other gentleman to go down to dinner at the Court . "
34646	34653	34655	34655	Robert	173	" Then I should n't wonder , "
34657	34690	34655	34655	Robert	173	" if George Talboys has gone down to the Court to call upon my uncle . It is n't like him , but it 's just possible that he has done it . "
34746	34751	34733	34734	Mr. Talboys	157	" And not since ? "
34752	34758	34760	34761	the man	634	" No , not since . "
34807	34818	34820	34820	Robert	173	" Why , what can have become of the man ? "
34831	34847	34820	34820	Robert	173	" From two till six — four good hours — and no signs of him ! "
34921	34933	34934	34934	he	173	" I have n't walked fast since I was at Eton , "
34954	34975	34934	34934	he	173	" and the worst of it is , that I have n't the most remote idea where I am going . "
35014	35019	35020	35020	he	173	" I have it , "
35030	35035	35020	35020	he	173	" the railway station ! "
35095	35098	35066	35067	the clerk	1263	" Private . "
35162	35178	35180	35180	Robert	173	" Do you remember the gentleman that came down to Audley with me , Smithers ? "
35182	35226	35180	35180	Robert	173	" Well , to tell you the real truth , Mr. Audley , I ca n't say that I do . You came by the four o'clock , if you remember , and there 's always a good many passengers by that train . "
35227	35236	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" You do n't remember him , then ? "
35237	35245	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" Not to my knowledge , sir . "
35246	35297	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" That 's provoking ! I want to know , Smithers , whether he has taken a ticket for London since two o'clock to - day . He 's a tall , broad - chested young fellow , with a big brown beard . You could n't well mistake him . "
35298	35313	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" There was four or five gentlemen as took tickets for the 3.30 up , "
35349	35368	35328	35329	his wife	554	" Four or five gentlemen ! But did either of them answer to the description of my friend ? "
35369	35383	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" Well , I think one of them had a beard , sir . "
35384	35391	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" A dark - brown beard ? "
35392	35407	35328	35329	his wife	554	" Well , I do n't know , but it was brownish - like . "
35408	35415	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" Was he dressed in gray ? "
35416	35455	35315	35316	the clerk	1263	" I believe it was gray ; a great many gents wear gray . He asked for the ticket sharp and short - like , and when he 'd got it walked straight out onto the platform whistling . "
35456	35461	35463	35463	Robert	173	" That 's George , "
35465	35486	35487	35487	he	173	" Thank you , Smithers ; I need n't trouble you any more . It 's as clear as daylight , "
35496	35607	35487	35487	he	173	" he 's got one of his gloomy fits on him , and he 's gone back to London without saying a word about it . I 'll leave Audley myself to - morrow morning ; and for to - night — why , I may as well go down to the Court and make the acquaintance of my uncle 's young wife . They do n't dine till seven ; if I get back across the fields I shall be in time . Bob — otherwise Robert Audley — this sort of thing will never do ; you are falling over head and ears in love with your aunt . "
35685	35694	35695	35695	she	468	" Thank you so much for the sables , "
35716	35736	35695	35695	she	468	" thank you for those beautiful sables . How good it was of you to get them for me . "
35774	35783	35784	35784	he	173	" Would you believe it , Sir Michael ? "
35787	35804	35784	35784	he	173	" That foolish chum of mine has gone back to London leaving me in the lurch . "
35805	35813	35819	35819	her	468	" Mr. George Talboys returned to town ? "
35822	35828	35830	35830	Alicia	149	" What a dreadful catastrophe ! "
35834	35862	35830	35830	Alicia	149	" since Pythias , in the person of Mr. Robert Audley , can not exist for half an hour without Damon , commonly known as George Talboys . "
35863	35871	35872	35872	Robert	173	" He 's a very good fellow , "
35877	35892	35872	35872	Robert	173	" and to tell the honest truth , I 'm rather uneasy about him . "
35893	35898	35899	35900	My lady	468	" Uneasy about him ! "
35914	35924	35926	35928	the young barrister	5094	" I 'll tell you why , Lady Audley , "
35930	35997	35926	35928	the young barrister	5094	" George had a bitter blow a year ago in the death of his wife . He has never got over that trouble . He takes life pretty quietly — almost as quietly as I do — but he often talks very strangely , and I sometimes think that one day this grief will get the better of him , and he will do something rash . "
36058	36062	36063	36063	she	150	" Dear me ! "
36066	36137	36063	36063	she	150	" this is very strange . I did not think men were capable of these deep and lasting affections . I thought that one pretty face was as good as another pretty face to them ; and that when number one with blue eyes and fair hair died , they had only to look out for number two , with dark eyes and black hair , by way of variety . "
36138	36160	36223	36223	she	468	" George Talboys is not one of those men . I firmly believe that his wife 's death broke his heart . "
36161	36165	36167	36168	Lady Audley	150	" How sad ! "
36170	36189	36167	36168	Lady Audley	150	" It seems almost cruel of Mrs. Talboys to die , and grieve her poor husband so much . "
36190	36199	36201	36201	Robert	173	" Alicia was right , she is childish , "
36244	36257	36258	36258	she	468	" I could carve a leg of mutton at Mr. Dawson 's , "
36263	36281	36258	36258	she	468	" but a leg of mutton is so easy , and then I used to stand up . "
36303	36322	36323	36323	he	146	" I am so glad to see my poor little woman in her usual good spirits once more , "
36326	36343	36323	36323	he	146	" She was very down - hearted yesterday at a disappointment she met with in London . "
36344	36348	36362	36363	my lady	468	" A disappointment ! "
36349	36360	36362	36363	my lady	468	" Yes , Mr. Audley , a very cruel one , "
36365	36569	36362	36363	my lady	468	" I received the other morning a telegraphic message from my dear old friend and school - mistress , telling me that she was dying , and that if I wanted to see her again , I must hasten to her immediately . The telegraphic dispatch contained no address , and of course , from that very circumstance , I imagined that she must be living in the house in which I left her three years ago . Sir Michael and I hurried up to town immediately , and drove straight to the old address . The house was occupied by strange people , who could give me no tidings of my friend . It is in a retired place , where there are very few tradespeople about . Sir Michael made inquiries at the few shops there are , but , after taking an immense deal of trouble , could discover nothing whatever likely to lead to the information we wanted . I have no friends in London , and had therefore no one to assist me except my dear , generous husband , who did all in his power , but in vain , to find my friend 's new residence . "
36570	36585	36587	36587	Robert	173	" It was very foolish not to send the address in the telegraphic message , "
36589	36606	36617	36617	her	468	" When people are dying it is not so easy to think of all these things , "
36704	36717	36718	36718	he	173	" I wish I 'd never felt any friendliness for the fellow , "
36721	36765	36718	36718	he	173	" I feel like a man who has an only son whose life has gone wrong with him . I wish to Heaven I could give him back his wife , and send him down to Ventnor to finish his days in peace . "
36894	36898	36899	36899	he	173	" George Talboys , "
36910	36915	36916	36916	she	150	" Upon my word , "
36919	36947	36916	36916	she	150	" you make me quite uncomfortable by the way in which you talk of Mr. Talboys . One would think that something extraordinary had happened to him . "
36948	36962	36916	36916	she	150	" God forbid ! But I can not help feeling uneasy about him . "
37226	37236	37237	37237	he	173	" You have hurt your arm , Lady Audley ! "
37246	37251	37252	37252	she	468	" It is nothing , "
37255	37269	37252	37252	she	468	" I am unfortunate in having a skin which the slightest touch bruises . "
37297	37304	37305	37305	he	146	" What is it , Lucy ? "
37308	37315	37305	37305	he	146	" and how did it happen ? "
37316	37330	37332	37333	Lady Audley	150	" How foolish you all are to trouble yourselves about anything so absurd ! "
37337	37374	37332	37333	Lady Audley	150	" I am rather absent in mind , and amused myself a few days ago by tying a piece of ribbon around my arm so tightly , that it left a bruise when I removed it . "
37375	37378	37380	37380	Robert	173	" Hum ! "
37382	37415	37380	37380	Robert	173	" My lady tells little childish white lies ; the bruise is of a more recent date than a few days ago ; the skin has only just begun to change color . "
37427	37434	37435	37435	he	146	" Hold the candle , Robert , "
37438	37449	37435	37435	he	146	" and let us look at this poor little arm . "
37565	37576	37578	37578	Robert	173	" I am sure my lady must tell white lies , "
37580	37592	37578	37578	Robert	173	" for I ca n't believe the story of the ribbon . "
37629	37643	37644	37644	he	173	" If I do n't find him there I shall go to Southampton , "
37647	37657	37644	37644	he	173	" and if I do n't find him there — "
37658	37662	37664	37665	my lady	468	" What then ? "
37667	37677	37678	37679	Robert Audley	173	" I shall think that something strange has happened . "
37730	37734	37735	37735	he	173	" To think , "
37740	37795	37735	37735	he	173	" that it is possible to care so much for a fellow ! But come what may , I 'll go up to town after him the first thing to - morrow morning ; and , sooner than be balked in finding him , I 'll go to the very end of the world . "
38087	38104	38105	38105	he	173	" He may have slept here last night , and started for Southampton early this morning , "
38108	38125	38105	38105	he	173	" Mrs. Maloney has been here , very likely , to make everything tidy after him . "
38195	38206	38207	38207	she	1320	" Had anything happened to the poor , dear gentleman ? "
38663	38676	38677	38677	he	173	" I need scarcely ask the question that I come to ask , "
38680	38697	38677	38677	he	173	" I was in hopes I should have found your son - in - law here . "
38698	38710	38677	38677	he	173	" What ! you knew that he was coming to Southampton ? "
38711	38718	38720	38720	Robert	173	" Knew that he was coming ? "
38725	38732	38720	38720	Robert	173	" He is here , then ? "
38733	38748	38677	38677	he	173	" No , he is not here now ; but he has been here . "
38749	38752	38677	38677	he	173	" When ? "
38753	38764	38677	38677	he	173	" Late last night ; he came by the mail . "
38765	38771	38677	38677	he	173	" And left again immediately ? "
38772	38781	38677	38677	he	173	" He stayed little better than an hour . "
38782	38786	38788	38788	Robert	173	" Good Heaven ! "
38790	38809	38788	38788	Robert	173	" what useless anxiety that man has given me ! What can be the meaning of all this ? "
38810	38820	38677	38677	he	173	" You knew nothing of his intention , then ? "
38821	38826	38677	38677	he	173	" Of what intention ? "
38827	38838	38788	38788	Robert	173	" I mean of his determination to go to Australia . "
38839	38861	38677	38677	he	173	" I know that it was always in his mind more or less , but not more just now than usual . "
38862	38952	38677	38677	he	173	" He sails to - night from Liverpool . He came here at one o'clock this morning to have a look at the boy , he said , before he left England , perhaps never to return . He told me he was sick of the world , and that the rough life out there was the only thing to suit him . He stayed an hour , kissed the boy without awaking him , and left Southampton by the mail that starts at a quarter - past two . "
38953	38963	38965	38965	Robert	173	" What can be the meaning of all this ? "
38967	39014	38965	38965	Robert	173	" What could be his motive for leaving England in this manner , without a word to me , his most intimate friend — without even a change of clothes ; for he has left everything at my chambers ? It is the most extraordinary proceeding ! "
39022	39030	39031	39031	he	694	" Do you know , Mr. Audley , "
39039	39055	39031	39031	he	694	" I sometimes fancy that Helen 's death had a strange effect upon poor George . "
39056	39059	39061	39061	Robert	173	" Pshaw ! "
39065	39084	39061	39061	Robert	173	" he felt the blow most cruelly , but his brain was as sound as yours or mine . "
39085	39095	39105	39105	He	1332	" Perhaps he will write to you from Liverpool , "
39123	39127	39129	39129	Robert	173	" He ought , "
39133	39163	39129	39129	Robert	173	" for we 've been good friends from the days when we were together at Eton . It is n't kind of George Talboys to treat me like this . "
39184	39191	39192	39192	he	173	" It is n't like him , "
39195	39203	39192	39192	he	173	" it is n't like George Talboys . "
39211	39217	39218	39218	he	173	" That 's my name , "
39221	39234	39218	39218	he	173	" and my papa 's name — the big gentleman 's name . "
39235	39258	39192	39192	he	173	" Yes , little Georgey , and your papa came last night and kissed you in your sleep . Do you remember ? "
39259	39262	39264	39265	the boy	5049	" No , "
39273	39291	39264	39265	the boy	5049	" You must have been very fast asleep , little Georgey , not to see poor papa . "
39313	39320	39309	39309	he	173	" Where 's the pretty lady ? "
39321	39326	39309	39309	he	173	" What pretty lady ? "
39327	39340	39309	39309	he	173	" The pretty lady that used to come a long while ago . "
39341	39348	39350	39352	the old man	694	" He means his poor mamma , "
39354	39357	39359	39360	the boy	5049	" No , "
39363	39378	39359	39360	the boy	5049	" not mamma . Mamma was always crying . I did n't like mamma — "
39379	39385	39309	39309	he	173	" Hush , little Georgey ! "
39386	39426	39309	39309	he	173	" But I did n't , and she did n't like me . She was always crying . I mean the pretty lady ; the lady that was dressed so fine , and that gave me my gold watch . "
39427	39456	39359	39360	the boy	5049	" He means the wife of my old captain — an excellent creature , who took a great fancy to Georgey , and gave him some handsome presents . "
39457	39473	39475	39475	Georgey	203	" Where 's my gold watch ? Let me show the gentleman my gold watch , "
39477	39487	39475	39475	Georgey	203	" It 's gone to be cleaned , Georgey , "
39492	39501	39503	39504	the boy	5049	" It 's always going to be cleaned , "
39506	39520	39522	39524	the old man	694	" The watch is perfectly safe , I assure you , Mr. Audley , "
39553	39563	39550	39551	Captain Mortimer	206	" Watch , set with diamonds , £ 11 . "
39564	39578	39580	39582	the old man	694	" I 'm often hard pressed for a few shillings , Mr. Audley , "
39584	39620	39621	39621	He	694	" My son - in - law has been very liberal to me ; but there are others , there are others , Mr. Audley — and — and — I've not been treated well . "
39638	39671	39628	39628	he	694	" Come , Georgey , it 's time the brave little man was in bed . Come along with grandpa . Excuse me for a quarter of an hour , Mr. Audley . "
39701	39739	39684	39686	the old man	694	" This is a poor place for me to pass my declining years in , Mr. Audley . I 've made many sacrifices , and I make them still , but I 've not been treated well . "
39799	39813	39814	39814	he	173	" And to think that I should care so much for the fellow ! "
39827	39840	39841	39841	he	173	" The place smells of stale tobacco like a tap - room , "
39845	39858	39841	39841	he	173	" there can be no harm in my smoking a cigar here . "
40021	40053	39971	39971	He	173	" — alboys came to — — last night , and left by the mail for London , on his way to Liverpool , whence he was to sail for Sydney . "
40104	40108	40109	40109	he	173	" My God ! "
40112	40134	40109	40109	he	173	" what is the meaning of this ? I shall go to Liverpool to - night , and make inquiries there ! "
40357	40369	40370	40370	he	5094	" I shall wait for to - morrow morning 's post , "
40373	40394	40370	40370	he	5094	" and if that brings no letter from George , I shall start for Liverpool without a moment 's delay . "
40899	40911	40912	40912	he	5094	" It 's that stupid Mrs. Maloney , I dare say , "
40915	40950	40912	40912	he	5094	" She may knock again for all I care . Why ca n't she use her duplicate key , instead of dragging a man out of bed when he 's half dead with fatigue . "
40982	40995	40997	40997	Robert	173	" She had her key with her all the time , then , "
40999	41010	40997	40997	Robert	173	" I 'm very glad I did n't get up . "
41048	41056	41057	41057	he	5094	" Is that you , Mrs. Maloney ? "
41060	41065	41057	41057	he	5094	" Yes , sir , "
41066	41095	41030	41031	the laundress	1316	" Then why , in goodness ' name , did you make that row at the door , when you had a key with you all the time ? "
41096	41105	41030	41031	the laundress	1316	" A row at the door , sir ? "
41106	41113	41057	41057	he	5094	" Yes ; that infernal knocking . "
41114	41131	41030	41031	the laundress	1316	" Sure I never knocked , Mister Audley , but walked straight in with my kay — "
41132	41171	41030	41031	the laundress	1316	" Then who did knock ? There 's been some one kicking up a row at that door for a quarter of an hour , I should think ; you must have met him going down - stairs . "
41172	41204	41057	41057	he	5094	" But I 'm rather late this morning , sir , for I 've been in Mr. Martin 's rooms first , and I 've come straight from the floor above . "
41205	41222	41030	41031	the laundress	1316	" Then you did n't see any one at the door , or on the stairs ? "
41223	41231	41030	41031	the laundress	1316	" Not a mortal soul , sir . "
41232	41239	41241	41241	Robert	173	" Was ever anything so provoking ? "
41243	41286	41241	41241	Robert	173	" To think that I should have let this person go away without ascertaining who he was , or what he wanted ! How do I know that it was not some one with a message or a letter from George Talboys ? "
41287	41300	41302	41303	Mrs. Maloney	202	" Sure if it was , sir , he 'll come again , "
41307	41324	41326	41326	Robert	173	" Yes , of course , if it was anything of consequence he 'll come again , "
42106	42117	42118	42118	he	1459	" Oh , by - the - by , sir , "
42121	42139	42118	42118	he	1459	" I remember one thing about this Mr. Thomas Brown — his arm was in a sling . "
42246	42254	42255	42255	he	173	" George Talboys never sailed for Australia , "
42264	42292	42293	42293	He	173	" If he is alive , he is still in England ; and if he is dead , his body is hidden in some corner of England . "
42396	42425	42426	42426	He	173	" I shall draw up a record of all that has occurred between our going down to Essex and to - night , beginning at the very beginning . "
42448	42472	42426	42426	He	173	" Journal of Facts connected with the Disappearance of George Talboys , inclusive of Facts which have no apparent Relation to that Circumstance . "
42520	42525	42526	42526	he	173	" Upon my word , "
42529	42554	42526	42526	he	173	" I begin to think that I ought to have pursued my profession , instead of dawdling my life away as I have done . "
42576	42593	42555	42555	He	173	" 1 . I write to Alicia , proposing to take George down to the Court . "
42594	42612	42526	42526	he	173	" 2 . Alicia writes , objecting to the visit , on the part of Lady Audley . "
42613	42649	42526	42526	he	173	" 3 . We go to Essex in spite of that objection . I see my lady . My lady refuses to be introduced to George on that particular evening on the score of fatigue . "
42650	42666	42555	42555	He	173	" 4 . Sir Michael invites George and me to dinner for the following evening . "
42667	42685	42526	42526	he	173	" 5 . My lady receives a telegraphic dispatch the next morning which summons her to London . "
42686	42732	42526	42526	he	173	" 6 . Alicia shows me a letter from my lady , in which she requests to be told when I and my friend , Mr. Talboys , mean to leave Essex . To this letter is subjoined a postscript , reiterating the above request . "
42733	42756	42555	42555	He	173	" 7 . We call at the Court , and ask to see the house . My lady 's apartments are locked . "
42757	42793	42526	42526	he	173	" 8 . We get at the aforesaid apartments by means of a secret passage , the existence of which is unknown to my lady . In one of the rooms we find her portrait . "
42794	42816	42526	42526	he	173	" 9 . George is frightened at the storm . His conduct is exceedingly strange for the rest of the evening . "
42817	42842	42526	42526	he	173	" 10 . George quite himself again the following morning . I propose leaving Audley Court immediately ; he prefers remaining till the evening . "
42843	42860	42555	42555	He	173	" 11 . We go out fishing . George leaves me to go to the Court . "
42861	42902	42526	42526	he	173	" 12 . The last positive information I can obtain of him in Essex is at the Court , where the servant says he thinks Mr. Talboys told him he would go and look for my lady in the grounds . "
42903	42922	42526	42526	he	173	" 13 . I receive information about him at the station which may or may not be correct . "
42923	42958	42526	42526	he	173	" 14 . I hear of him positively once more at Southampton , where , according to his father - in - law , he had been for an hour on the previous night . "
42959	42966	42526	42526	he	173	" 15 . The telegraphic message . "
43107	43119	43120	43120	he	173	" It 's as dark as midnight from first to last , "
43123	43170	43120	43120	he	173	" and the clew to the mystery must be found either at Southampton or in Essex . Be it how it may , my mind is made up . I shall first go to Audley Court , and look for George Talboys in a narrow radius . "
43171	43212	43120	43120	he	173	" Mr. George Talboys.—Any person who has met this gentleman since the 7th inst . , or who possesses any information respecting him subsequent to that date , will be liberally rewarded on communicating with A.Z. , 14 Chancery Lane . "
43249	43262	43264	43265	the baronet	465	" Robert 's friend has not yet been heard of , then , "
43277	43282	43264	43265	the baronet	465	" As for that , "
43287	43337	43264	43265	the baronet	465	" I can not help wondering that any one can be silly enough to advertise for him . The young man was evidently of a restless , roving disposition — a sort of Bamfyld Moore Carew of modern life , whom no attraction could ever keep in one spot . "
43411	43423	43425	43425	Alicia	149	" She is a vain , frivolous , heartless little coquette , "
43447	43499	43433	43433	Caesar	196	" she is a practiced and consummate flirt , Caesar ; and not contented with setting her yellow ringlets and her silly giggle at half the men in Essex , she must needs make that stupid cousin of mine dance attendance upon her . I have n't common patience with her . "
43531	43545	43546	43547	the baronet	465	" The poor little woman is very sensitive , you know , Alicia , "
43552	43561	43546	43547	the baronet	465	" and she feels your conduct most acutely . "
43562	43573	43575	43575	Alicia	149	" I do n't believe it a bit , papa , "
43579	43648	43649	43649	she	149	" You think her sensitive because she has soft little white hands , and big blue eyes with long lashes , and all manner of affected , fantastical ways , which you stupid men call fascinating . Sensitive ! Why , I 've seen her do cruel things with those slender white fingers , and laugh at the pain she inflicted . I 'm very sorry , papa , "
43663	43781	43649	43649	she	149	" though she has come between us , and robbed poor Alicia of the love of that dear , generous heart , I wish I could like her for your sake ; but I ca n't , I ca n't , and no more can Caesar . She came up to him once with her red lips apart , and her little white teeth glistening between them , and stroked his great head with her soft hand ; but if I had not had hold of his collar , he would have flown at her throat and strangled her . She may bewitch every man in Essex , but she 'd never make friends with my dog . "
43782	43789	43791	43792	Sir Michael	146	" Your dog shall be shot , "
43795	43804	43791	43792	Sir Michael	146	" if his vicious temper ever endangers Lucy . "
43946	44006	43939	43939	she	468	" It seems very hard that you can not love me , Alicia , for I have never been used to make enemies ; but since it seems that it must be so , I can not help it . If we can not be friends , let us be neutral . You wo n't try to injure me ? "
44007	44011	44013	44013	Alicia	149	" Injure you ! "
44015	44022	43939	43939	she	468	" how should I injure you ? "
44023	44037	43939	43939	she	468	" You 'll not try to deprive me of your father 's affection ? "
44038	44111	43939	43939	she	468	" I may not be as amiable as you are , my lady , and I may not have the same sweet smiles and pretty words for every stranger I meet , but I am not capable of a contemptible meanness ; and even if I were , I think you are so secure of my father 's love , that nothing but your own act will ever deprive you of it . "
44112	44122	44124	44125	my lady	468	" What a severe creature you are , Alicia ! "
44132	44192	44193	44193	Alicia	149	" I suppose you mean to infer by all that , that I 'm deceitful . Why , I ca n't help smiling at people , and speaking prettily to them . I know I 'm no better than the rest of the world ; but I ca n't help it if I 'm pleasantér . It 's constitutional . "
44592	44600	44606	44606	she	468	" How I hate this desolate month ! "
44618	44700	44701	44701	She	468	" Every thing dropping to ruin and decay , and the cold flicker of the sun lighting up the ugliness of the earth , as the glare of gas - lamps lights the wrinkles of an old woman . Shall I ever grow old , Phoebe ? Will my hair ever drop off as the leaves are falling from those trees , and leave me wan and bare like them ? What is to become of me when I grow old ? "
44743	44750	44751	44751	she	468	" Do you remember , Phoebe , "
44760	45037	44751	44751	she	468	" do you remember that French story we read — the story of a beautiful woman who had committed some crime — I forget what — in the zenith of her power and loveliness , when all Paris drank to her every night , and when the people ran away from the carriage of the king to flock about hers , and get a peep at her face ? Do you remember how she kept the secret of what she had done for nearly half a century , spending her old age in her family chateau , beloved and honored by all the province as an uncanonized saint and benefactress to the poor ; and how , when her hair was white , and her eyes almost blind with age , the secret was revealed through one of those strange accidents by which such secrets always are revealed in romances , and she was tried , found guilty , and condemned to be burned alive ? The king who had worn her colors was dead and gone ; the court of which she had been a star had passed away ; powerful functionaries and great magistrates , who might perhaps have helped her , were moldering in the graves ; brave young cavaliers , who would have died for her , had fallen upon distant battle - fields ; she had lived to see the age to which she had belonged fade like a dream ; and she went to the stake , followed by only a few ignorant country people , who forgot all her bounties , and hooted at her for a wicked sorceress . "
45038	45051	45053	45054	Phoebe Marks	166	" I do n't care for such dismal stories , my lady , "
45059	45077	45053	45054	Phoebe Marks	166	" One has no need to read books to give one the horrors in this dull place . "
45091	45100	45101	45101	she	150	" It is a dull place , Phoebe , "
45104	45179	45101	45101	she	150	" though it does n't do to say so to my dear old husband . Though I am the wife of one of the most influential men in the county , I do n't know that I was n't nearly as well off at Mr. Dawson 's ; and yet it 's something to wear sables that cost sixty guineas , and have a thousand pounds spent on the decoration of one 's apartments . "
45453	45471	45473	45474	my lady	468	" You surely are not in love with the awkward , ugly creature are you , Phoebe ? "
45534	45746	45517	45517	she	753	" I do n't think I can love him . We have been together from children , and I promised , when I was little better than fifteen , that I 'd be his wife . I dare n't break that promise now . There have been times when I 've made up the very sentence I meant to say to him , telling him that I could n't keep my faith with him ; but the words have died upon my lips , and I 've sat looking at him , with a choking sensation , in my throat that would n't let me speak . I dare n't refuse to marry him . I 've often watched and watched him , as he has sat slicing away at a hedge - stake with his great clasp - knife , till I have thought that it is just such men as he who have decoyed their sweethearts into lonely places , and murdered them for being false to their word . When he was a boy he was always violent and revengeful . I saw him once take up that very knife in a quarrel with his mother . I tell you , my lady , I must marry him . "
45747	45760	45762	45762	Lucy	197	" You silly girl , you shall do nothing of the kind ! "
45764	45884	45885	45886	Phoebe Marks	166	" You think he 'll murder you , do you ? Do you think , then , if murder is in him , you would be any safer as his wife ? If you thwarted him , or made him jealous ; if he wanted to marry another woman , or to get hold of some poor , pitiful bit of money of yours , could n't he murder you then ? I tell you you sha'n't marry him , Phoebe . In the first place I hate the man ; and , in the next place I ca n't afford to part with you . We 'll give him a few pounds and send him about his business . "
45900	45910	45911	45911	she	166	" My lady — my good , kind mistress ! "
45916	45972	45911	45911	she	166	" do n't try to thwart me in this — don't ask me to thwart him . I tell you I must marry him . You do n't know what he is . It will be my ruin , and the ruin of others , if I break my word . I must marry him ! "
45973	45981	45983	45984	her mistress	1497	" Very well , then , Phoebe , "
45986	46005	45983	45984	her mistress	1497	" I ca n't oppose you . There must be some secret at the bottom of all this . "
46006	46013	46015	46016	the girl	753	" There is , my lady , "
46026	46063	46015	46016	the girl	753	" I shall be very sorry to lose you ; but I have promised to stand your friend in all things . What does your cousin mean to do for a living when you are married ? "
46064	46074	45983	45984	her mistress	1497	" He would like to take a public house . "
46075	46150	46015	46016	the girl	753	" Then he shall take a public house , and the sooner he drinks himself to death the better . Sir Michael dines at a bachelor 's party at Major Margrave 's this evening , and my step - daughter is away with her friends at the Grange . You can bring your cousin into the drawing - room after dinner , and I 'll tell him what I mean to do for him . "
46151	46160	46161	46161	Phoebe	166	" You are very good , my lady , "
46331	46342	46343	46343	she	166	" Tell my lady how thankful you are , Luke , "
46346	46357	46343	46343	she	166	" But I 'm not so over and above thankful , "
46364	46385	46343	46343	she	166	" Fifty pound ai n't much to start a public . You 'll make it a hundred , my lady ? "
46386	46395	46400	46400	her	150	" I shall do nothing of the kind , "
46408	46419	46400	46400	her	150	" and I wonder at your impertinence in asking it . "
46420	46430	46432	46432	Luke	167	" Oh , yes , you will , though , "
46443	46454	46432	46432	Luke	167	" You 'll make it a hundred , my lady . "
46503	46513	46485	46485	she	150	" Phoebe Marks , you have told this man ! "
46526	46535	46536	46536	she	150	" Oh , forgive me , forgive me ! "
46539	46555	46536	46536	she	150	" He forced it from me , or I would never , never have told ! "
46768	46773	46774	46805	A very dim and shadowy lady , vague of outline , and faint of coloring , with eyes , hair , complexion and dress all melting into such pale and uncertain shades	1570	" quite the lady . "
47496	47505	47506	47506	he	1567	" What are you blubbering for , lass ? "
47511	47538	47506	47506	he	1567	" If you did n't want to marry me you should have told me so . I ai n't going to murder you , am I ? "
47560	47570	47572	47572	Luke	167	" You 're cold in all this here finery , "
47587	47615	47616	47616	He	1567	" Why ca n't women dress according to their station ? You wo n't have no silk gownds out of my pocket , I can tell you . "
48473	48485	48487	48489	the young lady	5100	" You were always a poor , spiritless fellow , Bob , "
48530	48563	48494	48494	she	5100	" but this year I do n't know what has come to you . You are good for nothing but to hold a skein of silk or read Tennyson to Lady Audley . "
48564	48578	48580	48582	the young man	667	" My dear , hasty , impetuous Alicia , do n't be violent , "
48585	48650	48580	48582	the young man	667	" A conclusion is n't a five - barred gate ; and you need n't give your judgment its head , as you give your mare Atalanta hers , when you 're flying across country at the heels of an unfortunate fox . Lady Audley interests me , and my uncle 's county friends do not . Is that a sufficient answer , Alicia ? "
48661	48679	48680	48680	she	149	" It 's as good an answer as I shall ever get from , you , Bob , "
48685	48737	48680	48680	she	149	" but pray amuse yourself in your own way ; loll in an easy - chair all day , with those two absurd dogs asleep on your knees ; spoil my lady 's window - curtains with your cigars and annoy everybody in the house with your stupid , inanimate countenance . "
48822	48825	48826	48826	she	5100	" Yes , "
48829	48904	48826	48826	she	5100	" your stupid , inanimate countenance . Do you know , Robert Audley , that with all your mock amiability , you are brimful of conceit and superciliousness . You look down upon our amusements ; you lift up your eyebrows , and shrug your shoulders , and throw yourself back in your chair , and wash your hands of us and our pleasures . You are a selfish , cold - hearted Sybarite — "
48905	48914	48826	48826	she	5100	" Alicia ! Good — gracious — me ! "
48933	49153	48925	48925	he	1688	" Yes , selfish , Robert Audley ! You take home half - starved dogs , because you like half - starved dogs . You stoop down , and pat the head of every good - for - nothing cur in the village street , because you like good - for - nothing curs . You notice little children , and give them halfpence , because it amuses you to do so . But you lift your eyebrows a quarter of a yard when poor Sir Harry Towers tells a stupid story , and stare the poor fellow out of countenance with your lazy insolence . As to your amiability , you would let a man hit you , and say ' Thank you ' for the blow , rather than take the trouble to hit him again ; but you would n't go half a mile out of your way to serve your dearest friend . Sir Harry is worth twenty of you , though he did write to ask if my m - a - i - r Atalanta had recovered from the sprain . He ca n't spell , or lift his eyebrows to the roots of his hair ; but he would go through fire and water for the girl he loves ; while you — "
49210	49220	49195	49195	Robert	173	" Alicia , my darling , what is it ? "
49221	49239	49241	49242	his cousin	786	" It's — it's — it 's the feather of my hat that got into my eyes , "
49327	49331	49333	49333	Robert	173	" Good Heaven ! "
49350	49541	49333	49333	Robert	173	" What does all this mean ? How charmingly she sits her horse ! What a pretty figure , too , and a fine , candid , brown , rosy face : but to fly at a fellow like that , without the least provocation ! That 's the consequence of letting a girl follow the hounds . She learns to look at everything in life as she does at six feet of timber or a sunk fence ; she goes through the world as she goes across country — straight ahead , and over everything . Such a nice girl as she might have been , too , if she 'd been brought up in Figtree Court ! If ever I marry , and have daughters ( which remote contingency may Heaven forefend ! ) they shall be educated in Paper Buildings , take their sole exercise in the Temple Gardens , and they shall never go beyond the gates till they are marriageable , when I will walk them straight across Fleet street to St. Dunstan 's church , and deliver them into the hands of their husbands . "
49638	49652	49627	49627	Robert	173	" You are sure my cigar does not annoy you , Lady Audley ? "
49653	49686	49704	49705	My lady	468	" Oh , no indeed ; I am quite used to the smell of tobacco . Mr. Dawson , the surgeon , smoked all the evening when I lived in his house . "
49687	49698	49699	49699	Robert	173	" Dawson is a good fellow , is n't he ? "
49714	49721	49722	49722	she	468	" The dearest of good creatures , "
49725	49865	49722	49722	she	468	" He paid me five - and - twenty pounds a year — only fancy , five - and - twenty pounds ! That made six pounds five a quarter . How well I remember receiving the money — six dingy old sovereigns , and a little heap of untidy , dirty silver , that came straight from the till in the surgery ! And then how glad I was to get it ! While now — I ca n't help laughing while I think of it — these colors I am using cost a guinea each at Winsor & Newton's — the carmine and ultramarine thirty shillings . I gave Mrs. Dawson one of my silk dresses the other day , and the poor thing kissed me , and the surgeon carried the bundle home under his cloak . "
49951	49957	49958	49958	he	173	" It is a change , "
49979	50000	49958	49958	he	173	" it is a change ! Some women would do a great deal to accomplish such a change as that . "
50106	50125	50126	50126	he	173	" My friend at the corner of Chancery Lane has not given me such good Manillas as usual , "
50129	50164	50126	50126	he	173	" If ever you smoke , my dear aunt ( and I am told that many women take a quiet weed under the rose ) , be very careful how you choose your cigars . "
50185	50205	50174	50174	her	468	" What an eccentric creature you are , Mr. Audley I Do you know that you sometimes puzzle me — "
50206	50217	50218	50219	My lady	468	" Not more than you puzzle me , dear aunt . "
50386	50393	50394	50394	she	150	" That Mr. George — George — "
50399	50402	50404	50404	Robert	173	" Talboys , "
50406	50446	50404	50404	Robert	173	" Yes , to be sure — Mr. George Talboys . Rather a singular name , by - the - by , and certainly , by all accounts , a very singular person . Have you seen him lately ? "
50447	50479	50486	50487	my lady	468	" I have not seen him since the 7th of September last — the day upon which he left me asleep in the meadows on the other side of the village . "
50480	50484	50486	50487	my lady	468	" Dear me ! "
50489	50510	50511	50511	Robert	173	" what a very strange young man this Mr. George Talboys must be ! Pray tell me all about it . "
50580	50590	50592	50593	my lady	468	" And what do you infer from all this ? "
50599	50609	50610	50610	he	667	" It is so great a mystery to me , "
50613	50646	50610	50610	he	667	" that I scarcely dare to draw any conclusion whatever ; but in the obscurity I think I can grope my way to two suppositions , which to me seem almost certainties . "
50647	50652	50592	50593	my lady	468	" And they are — "
50653	50675	50592	50593	my lady	468	" First , that George Talboys never went beyond Southampton . Second , that he never went to Southampton at all . "
50676	50693	50592	50593	my lady	468	" But you traced him there . His father - in - law had seen him . "
50694	50709	50592	50593	my lady	468	" I have reason to doubt his father - in - law 's integrity . "
50710	50715	50717	50718	my lady	468	" Good gracious me ! "
50722	50731	50717	50718	my lady	468	" What do you mean by all this ? "
50732	50736	50738	50740	the young man	667	" Lady Audley , "
50744	50840	50738	50740	the young man	667	" I have never practiced as a barrister . I have enrolled myself in the ranks of a profession , the members of which hold solemn responsibilities and have sacred duties to perform ; and I have shrunk from those responsibilities and duties , as I have from all the fatigues of this troublesome life . But we are sometimes forced into the very position we have most avoided , and I have found myself lately compelled to think of these things . Lady Audley , did you ever study the theory of circumstantial evidence ? "
50841	50855	50857	50858	my lady	468	" How can you ask a poor little woman about such horrid things ? "
50860	50864	50866	50868	the young man	667	" Circumstantial evidence , "
50878	51062	50875	50876	Lady Audley	150	interruption—"that wonderful fabric which is built out of straws collected at every point of the compass , and which is yet strong enough to hang a man . Upon what infinitesimal trifles may sometimes hang the whole secret of some wicked mystery , inexplicable heretofore to the wisest upon the earth ! A scrap of paper , a shred of some torn garment , the button off a coat , a word dropped incautiously from the overcautious lips of guilt , the fragment of a letter , the shutting or opening of a door , a shadow on a window - blind , the accuracy of a moment tested by one of Benson 's watches — a thousand circumstances so slight as to be forgotten by the criminal , but links of iron in the wonderful chain forged by the science of the detective officer ; and lo ! the gallows is built up ; the solemn bell tolls through the dismal gray of the early morning , the drop creaks under the guilty feet , and the penalty of crime is paid . "
51141	51150	51152	51153	Robert Audley	173	" The radius grows narrower day by day , "
51155	51162	51152	51153	Robert Audley	173	" George Talboys never reached Southampton . "
51619	51673	51610	51611	Sir Michael	146	" Stay , my dear boy ; stay , my dear Bob , as long as ever you like . I have no son , and you stand to me in the place of one . Make yourself agreeable to Lucy , and make the Court your home as long as you live . "
51692	51698	51719	51719	he	667	" a jolly old prince . "
51723	51729	51719	51719	he	667	" a jolly old prince ; "
51921	51933	51934	51934	he	214	" What a fool I am to feel it like this ! "
51945	52056	51934	51934	he	214	" I always knew it would be so ; I always knew that she was a hundred times too good for me . God bless her ! How nobly and tenderly she spoke ; how beautiful she looked with the crimson blushes under her brown skin , and the tears in her big , gray eyes — almost as handsome as the day she took the sunk fence , and let me put the brush in her hat as we rode home ! God bless her ! I can get over anything as long as she does n't care for that sneaking lawyer . But I could n't stand that . "
52137	52140	52141	52141	he	173	" Yes , "
52144	52171	52172	52172	He	173	" Norwich is in Norfolk , and that fool , young Vincent , said it was in Herefordshire . Ha , Alicia , is that you ? "
52188	52191	52193	52194	his cousin	786	" Yes , "
52202	52210	52211	52213	The young lady	5100	" Alicia , you have been crying . "
52220	52254	52211	52213	The young lady	5100	" You have been crying , Alicia . Sir Harry Towers , of Towers Park , in the county of Herts , has been making you an offer of his hand , eh ? "
52255	52267	52193	52193	his	173	" Have you been listening at the door , Mr. Audley ? "
52268	52326	52211	52213	The young lady	5100	" I have not , Miss Audley . On principle , I object to listen , and in practice I believe it to be a very troublesome proceeding ; but I am a barrister , Miss Alicia , and able to draw a conclusion by induction . Do you know what inductive evidence is , Miss Audley ? "
52327	52330	52332	52332	Alicia	149	" No , "
52350	52479	52211	52213	The young lady	5100	" I thought not . I dare say Sir Harry would ask if it was a new kind of horse - ball . I knew by induction that the baronet was going to make you an offer ; first , because he came downstairs with his hair parted on the wrong side , and his face as pale as a tablecloth ; secondly , because he could n't eat any breakfast , and let his coffee go the wrong way ; and , thirdly , because he asked for an interview with you before he left the Court . Well , how 's it to be , Alicia ? Do we marry the baronet , and is poor Cousin Bob to be the best man at the wedding ? "
52480	52492	52494	52494	Alicia	149	" Sir Harry Towers is a noble - hearted young man , "
52503	52561	52494	52494	Alicia	149	" But do we accept him — yes or no ? Are we to be Lady Towers , with a superb estate in Hertfordshire , summer quarters for our hunters , and a drag with outriders to drive us across to papa 's place in Essex ? Is it to be so , Alicia , or not ? "
52562	52573	52575	52575	Alicia	149	" What is that to you , Mr. Robert Audley ? "
52579	52670	52575	52575	Alicia	149	" What do you care what becomes of me , or whom I marry ? If I married a chimney - sweep you 'd only lift up your eyebrows and say , ' Bless my soul , she was always eccentric . ' I have refused Sir Harry Towers ; but when I think of his generous and unselfish affection , and compare it with the heartless , lazy , selfish , supercilious indifference of other men , I 've a good mind to run after him and tell him — "
52671	52683	52704	52704	his	173	" That you 'll retract , and be my Lady Towers ? "
52684	52687	52575	52575	Alicia	149	" Yes . "
52688	52698	52700	52701	Robert Audley	173	" Then do n't , Alicia , do n't , "
52718	52765	52700	52701	Robert Audley	173	" Come into the drawing - room with me , Alicia , my poor little cousin ; my charming , impetuous , alarming little cousin . Sit down here in this mullioned window , and let us talk seriously and leave off quarreling if we can . "
52818	52824	52826	52826	Robert	173	" My poor little Alicia , "
52840	52997	52826	52826	Robert	173	" do you suppose that because people do n't wear vinegar tops , or part their hair on the wrong side , or conduct themselves altogether after the manner of well - meaning maniacs , by way of proving the vehemence of their passion — do you suppose because of this , Alicia Audley , that they may not be just as sensible of the merits of a dear little warm - hearted and affectionate girl as ever their neighbors can be ? Life is such a very troublesome matter , when all is said and done , that it 's as well even to take its blessings quietly . I do n't make a great howling because I can get good cigars one door from the corner of Chancery Lane , and have a dear , good girl for my cousin ; but I am not the less grateful to Providence that it is so . "
53042	53055	53057	53058	Miss Audley	149	" Is this all you have to say to me , Robert ? "
53062	53071	53073	53074	her cousin	790	" Well , yes , I think so , "
53080	53159	53073	53074	her cousin	790	" I fancy that what I wanted to say was this — don't marry the fox - hunting baronet if you like anybody else better ; for if you 'll only be patient and take life easily , and try and reform yourself of banging doors , bouncing in and out rooms , talking of the stables , and riding across country , I 've no doubt the person you prefer will make you a very excellent husband . "
53160	53166	53168	53169	Miss Audley	149	" Thank you , cousin , "
53187	53213	53214	53214	Robert	173	" but as you may not know the person I prefer , I think you had better not take upon yourself to answer for him . "
53225	53232	53233	53233	he	173	" No , to be sure , "
53240	53256	53233	53233	he	173	" Of course , if I do n't know him — I thought I did . "
53257	53261	53263	53263	Alicia	149	" Did you ? "
53287	53297	53298	53298	Robert	173	" I only said I thought I knew him , "
53320	53334	53316	53316	he	173	" Such a nice girl , too , if she did n't bounce . "
53502	53522	53524	53526	the young baronet	1804	" What 's the good of being rich if one has no one to help spend one 's money ? "
53528	53574	53524	53526	the young baronet	1804	" One only grows a selfish beggar , and takes to drinking too much port . It 's a hard thing that a girl can refuse a true heart and such stables as we 've got at the park . It unsettles a man somehow . "
53730	53737	53726	53726	he	214	" Haw , to be sure ! "
53739	53745	53726	53726	he	214	" By Jove — hum ! "
53809	53812	53813	53813	he	214	" Yes , "
53822	53927	53928	53929	the baronet	465	" I know I 'm a good match , and I know what makes the gals so civil . They 're very pretty , and they 're very friendly to a fellow ; but I do n't care about 'em . They 're all alike — they can only drop their eyes and say , ' Lor ' , Sir Harry , why do you call that curly black dog a retriever ? ' or ' Oh Sir Harry , and did the poor mare really sprain her pastern shoulder - blade ? ' I have n't got much brains myself , I know , "
53934	53971	53928	53929	the baronet	465	" and I do n't want a strong - minded woman , who writes books and wears green spectacles ; but , hang it ! I like a gal who knows what she 's talking about . "
53976	53979	53974	53974	Alicia	149	" No , "
54050	54058	54059	54059	he	146	" I 'm very sorry , Towers , "
54062	54096	54059	54059	he	146	" You 're as good a fellow as ever breathed , and would have made my girl an excellent husband ; but you know there 's a cousin , and I think that — "
54097	54106	54108	54111	the fox - hunter	1818	" Do n't say that , Sir Michael , "
54115	54214	54108	54111	the fox - hunter	1818	" I can get over anything but that . A fellow whose hand upon the curb weighs half a ton ( why , he pulled the Cavalier 's mouth to pieces , sir , the day you let him ride the horse ) ; a fellow who turns his collars down , and eats bread and marmalade ! No , no , Sir Michael ; it 's a queer world , but I ca n't think that of Miss Audley . There must be some one in the background , sir ; it ca n't be the cousin . "
54227	54235	54236	54236	he	146	" I do n't know about that , "
54239	54276	54236	54236	he	146	" Bob 's a good lad , and the girl might do worse ; but he hangs back as if he did n't care for her . There 's some mystery — there 's some mystery ! "
54390	54408	54409	54409	she	1824	" So the last of our visitors is gone , dear , and we 're all alone , "
54412	54418	54409	54409	she	1824	" Is n't that nice ? "
54419	54424	54425	54425	he	1820	" Yes , darling , "
54434	54452	54481	54481	he	465	" Except Mr. Robert Audley . How long is that nephew of yours going to stay here ? "
54453	54468	54470	54471	the baronet	465	" As long as he likes , my pet ; he 's always welcome , "
54486	54522	54481	54481	he	465	" But not unless his visit is agreeable to you , darling ; not if his lazy habits , or his smoking , or his dogs , or anything about him is displeasing to you . "
54537	54543	54544	54544	she	150	" It is n't that , "
54549	54586	54544	54544	she	150	" Mr. Audley is a very agreeable young man , and a very honorable young man ; but you know , Sir Michael , I 'm rather a young aunt for such a nephew , and — "
54587	54593	54595	54596	the baronet	465	" And what , Lucy ? "
54600	54639	54595	54596	the baronet	465	" Poor Alicia is rather jealous of any attention Mr. Audley pays me , and — and — I think it would be better for her happiness if your nephew were to bring his visit to a close . "
54640	54650	54652	54653	Sir Michael	146	" He shall go to - night , Lucy , "
54655	54717	54652	54653	Sir Michael	146	" I am a blind , neglectful fool not to have thought of this before . My lovely little darling , it was scarcely just to Bob to expose the poor lad to your fascinations . I know him to be as good and true - hearted a fellow as ever breathed , but — but — he shall go tonight . "
54718	54735	54595	54596	the baronet	465	" But you wo n't be too abrupt , dear ? You wo n't be rude ? "
54736	54771	54652	54653	Sir Michael	146	" Rude ! No , Lucy . I left him smoking in the lime - walk . I 'll go and tell him that he must get out of the house in an hour . "
54856	54865	54866	54866	he	146	" I have been attentive to my lady , "
54869	54874	54866	54866	he	146	" She interests me ; "
54906	54952	54893	54893	he	146	" God forbid , my dear uncle , that I should ever bring trouble upon such a noble heart as yours ! God forbid that the slightest shadow of dishonor should ever fall upon your honored head — least of all through agency of mine . "
55442	55448	55409	55429	a little village lad who was in the habit of running errands for her , and taking him into the kitchen	1859	" You know Audley Court ? "
55449	55454	55406	55407	Phoebe Marks	166	" Yes , mum . "
55455	55488	55409	55429	a little village lad who was in the habit of running errands for her , and taking him into the kitchen	1859	" If you 'll run there with this letter to - night , and see that it 's put safely in Lady Audley 's hands , I 'll give you a shilling . "
55489	55494	55409	55429	a little village lad who was in the habit of running errands for her , and taking him into the kitchen	1859	" Yes , mum . "
55495	55539	55406	55407	Phoebe Marks	166	" You understand ? Ask to see my lady ; you can say you 've a message — not a note , mind — but a message from Phoebe Marks ; and when you see her , give this into her own hand . "
55540	55545	55409	55429	a little village lad who was in the habit of running errands for her , and taking him into the kitchen	1859	" Yes , mum . "
55546	55552	55409	55429	a little village lad who was in the habit of running errands for her , and taking him into the kitchen	1859	" You wo n't forget ? "
55553	55558	55406	55407	Phoebe Marks	166	" No , mum . "
55559	55566	55567	55568	The boy	5049	" Then be off with you . "
55620	55632	55633	55633	she	166	" If there 's any bad meaning in his coming here , "
55636	55650	55633	55633	she	166	" my lady will know of it in time , at any rate . "
55787	55790	55791	55791	he	173	" That , "
55794	55804	55791	55791	he	173	" is a woman who could keep a secret . "
55842	55855	55857	55857	Robert	173	" Will you pour out my tea for me , Mrs. Marks ? "
55887	55898	55900	55900	Phoebe	166	" You have come straight from the Court , sir ? "
55911	55924	55903	55903	she	166	" Yes ; I only left my uncle 's an hour ago . "
55925	55937	55903	55903	she	166	" And my lady , sir , was she quite well ? "
55938	55944	55903	55903	she	166	" Yes , quite well . "
55945	55957	55903	55903	she	166	" As gay and light - hearted as ever , sir ? "
55958	55968	55903	55903	she	166	" As gay and light - hearted as ever . "
55997	56013	56014	56014	he	173	" You knew Lady Audley when she was Miss Lucy Graham , did you not ? "
56017	56035	56014	56014	he	173	" Yes , sir . I lived at Mrs. Dawson 's when my lady was governess there . "
56036	56048	55993	55993	he	173	" Indeed ! Was she long in the surgeon 's family ? "
56049	56058	56114	56115	Mrs. Marks	221	" A year and a half , sir . "
56059	56066	56014	56014	he	173	" And she came from London ? "
56067	56072	55993	55993	he	173	" Yes , sir . "
56073	56083	56114	56115	Mrs. Marks	221	" And she was an orphan , I believe ? "
56084	56089	56014	56014	he	173	" Yes , sir . "
56090	56099	55993	55993	he	173	" Always as cheerful as she is now ? "
56100	56105	56114	56115	Mrs. Marks	221	" Always , sir . "
56136	56148	56149	56149	he	173	" This woman would be good in a witness - box , "
56152	56168	56149	56149	he	173	" it would take a clever lawyer to bother her in a cross - examination . "
56226	56249	56251	56251	Robert	173	" There 's a triangular draught from those two windows and the door that scarcely adds to the comfort of this apartment , "
56253	56273	56251	56251	Robert	173	" and there certainly are pleasantér sensations than that of standing up to one 's knees in cold water . "
56337	56340	56341	56341	he	173	" No , "
56346	56370	56341	56341	he	173	" that is a woman who can keep a secret . A counsel for the prosecution could get very little out of her . "
56469	56476	56478	56478	Robert	173	" The man is a fool , "
56487	56501	56502	56502	He	173	" I 'll go and talk to him by - and - by . "
56713	56730	56732	56732	Robert	173	" I have come in for a few minutes ' chat before I go to bed , "
56743	56765	56766	56766	he	173	" Would you object to a cigar , Mrs. Marks ? I mean , of course , to my smoking one , "
56771	56778	56766	56766	he	173	" Not at all , sir . "
56779	56798	56800	56801	Mr. Marks	167	" It would be a good ' un her objectin ' to a bit o ' ' bacca , "
56803	56813	56800	56801	Mr. Marks	167	" when me and the customers smokes all day . "
56846	56861	56862	56862	he	173	" I want you to tell me all about Mount Stanning , Mr. Marks , "
56867	56875	56877	56877	Luke	167	" Then that 's pretty soon told , "
56886	56961	56962	56962	he	173	" Of all the dull holes as ever a man set foot in , this is about the dullest . Not that the business do n't pay pretty tidy ; I do n't complain of that ; but I should ha ' liked a public at Chelmsford , or Brentwood , or Romford , or some place where there 's a bit of life in the streets ; and I might have had it , "
56967	56977	56962	56962	he	173	" if folks had n't been so precious stingy . "
57000	57011	57012	57012	she	166	" We forgot the brew - house door , Luke , "
57015	57029	57012	57012	she	166	" Will you come with me and help me put up the bar ? "
57030	57043	57045	57046	Mr. Marks	167	" The brew - house door can bide for to - night , "
57048	57067	57068	57068	He	173	" I ai n't agoin ' to move now . I 've seated myself for a comfortable smoke . "
57091	57106	57108	57109	his wife	554	" I do n't feel easy about that brew - house door , Luke , "
57111	57131	57108	57109	his wife	554	" there are always tramps about , and they can get in easily when the bar is n't up . "
57132	57147	57149	57150	Mr. Marks	167	" Go and put the bar up yourself , then , ca n't you ? "
57152	57162	57149	57150	Mr. Marks	167	" It 's too heavy for me to lift . "
57163	57258	57108	57109	his wife	554	" Then let it bide , if you 're too fine a lady to see to it yourself . You 're very anxious all of a sudden about this here brew - house door . I suppose you do n't want me to open my mouth to this here gent , that 's about it . Oh , you need n't frown at me to stop my speaking ! You 're always putting in your tongue and clipping off my words before I 've half said 'em ; but I wo n't stand it . "
57259	57270	57271	57272	Phoebe Marks	166	" Do you hear ? I wo n't stand it ! "
57310	57323	57325	57325	Robert	173	" Then you do n't particularly care to live at Mount Stanning ? "
57337	57344	57346	57346	Luke	167	" No , I do n't , "
57348	57423	57346	57346	Luke	167	" and I do n't care who knows it ; and , as I said before , if folks had n't been so precious stingy , I might have had a public in a thrivin ' market town , instead of this tumble - down old place , where a man has his hair blowed off his head on a windy day . What 's fifty pound , or what 's a hundred pound — "
57424	57429	57494	57494	his	173	" Luke ! Luke ! "
57430	57450	57452	57453	Mr. Marks	167	" No , you 're not goin' to stop my mouth with all your ' Luke , Lukes ! ' "
57460	57471	57452	57453	Mr. Marks	167	" I say again , what 's a hundred pound ? "
57472	57475	57477	57478	Robert Audley	173	" No , "
57502	57535	57494	57494	his	173	" What , indeed , is a hundred pounds to a man possessed of the power which you hold , or rather which your wife holds , over the person in question . "
57577	57583	57585	57585	Robert	173	" A quarter to twelve , "
57592	57635	57585	57585	Robert	173	" Late hours for such a quiet village as Mount Stanning . Good - night , my worthy host . Good - night , Mrs. Marks . You need n't send me my shaving water till nine o'clock to - morrow morning . "
57800	57803	57804	57804	he	173	" Lively , "
57807	57819	57804	57804	he	173	" for a man used to the fascinations of Temple Bar . "
57851	57873	57874	57874	he	173	" I wonder what unhappy wretch has too restless a spirit to stop at home on such a morning as this , "
57908	57919	57921	57921	Robert	173	" Lady Audley ! Pray beg her to come in , "
57942	57958	57938	57938	he	173	teeth—"A false move , my lady , and one I never looked for from you . "
58110	58118	58119	58119	she	197	" What a morning , Mr. Audley ! "
58122	58127	58119	58119	she	197	" what a morning ! "
58128	58142	58084	58084	his	173	" Yes , indeed ! Why did you come out in such weather ? "
58143	58153	58163	58163	my	0	" Because I wished to see you — particularly . "
58154	58157	58119	58119	she	197	" Indeed ! "
58158	58161	58178	58178	her	197	" Yes , "
58188	58225	58119	58119	she	197	restlessness—"yes , Mr. Audley , I felt that you had not been well treated ; that — that you had , in short , reason to complain ; and that an apology was due to you . "
58226	58238	58119	58119	she	197	" I do not wish for any apology , Lady Audley . "
58239	58247	58249	58250	my lady	468	" But you are entitled to one , "
58254	58344	58249	58250	my lady	468	" Why , my dear Robert , should we be so ceremonious toward each other ? You were very comfortable at Audley ; we were very glad to have you there ; but , my dear , silly husband must needs take it into his foolish head that it is dangerous for his poor little wife 's peace of mind to have a nephew of eight or nine and twenty smoking his cigars in her boudoir , and , behold ! our pleasant little family circle is broken up . "
58372	58376	58377	58377	he	173	" Lady Audley , "
58380	58425	58377	58377	he	173	" Heaven forbid that either you or I should ever bring grief or dishonor upon my uncle 's generous heart ! Better , perhaps , that I should be out of the house — better , perhaps , that I had never entered it ! "
58476	58488	58489	58489	he	173	" Oh , pray do not be alarmed , Lady Audley , "
58494	58581	58489	58489	he	173	" You have no sentimental nonsense , no silly infatuation , borrowed from Balzac or Dumas fils , to fear from me . The benchers of the Inner Temple will tell you that Robert Audley is troubled with none of the epidemics whose outward signs are turn - down collars and Byronic neckties . I say that I wish I had never entered my uncle 's house during the last year ; but I say it with a far more solemn meaning than any sentimental one . "
58588	58600	58601	58601	she	468	" If you insist on talking in enigmas , Mr. Audley , "
58604	58619	58601	58601	she	468	" you must forgive a poor little woman if she declines to answer them . "
58628	58633	58635	58636	my lady	468	" But tell me , "
58645	58659	58635	58636	my lady	468	" what could have induced you to come up to this dismal place ? "
58660	58663	58635	58636	my lady	468	" Curiosity . "
58664	58667	58635	58636	my lady	468	" Curiosity ? "
58668	58712	58635	58636	my lady	468	" Yes ; I felt an interest in that bull - necked man , with the dark - red hair and wicked gray eyes . A dangerous man , my lady — a man in whose power I should not like to be . "
58749	58760	58761	58761	she	150	" What have I done to you , Robert Audley , "
58764	58777	58761	58761	she	150	passionately—"what have I done to you that you should hate me so ? "
58784	58817	58778	58778	He	1924	" I had a friend , Lady Audley , whom I loved very dearly , and since I have lost him I fear that my feelings toward other people are strangely embittered . "
58818	58829	58761	58761	she	150	" You mean the Mr. Talboys who went to Australia ? "
58830	58854	58761	58761	she	150	" Yes , I mean the Mr. Talboys who I was told set out for Liverpool with the idea of going to Australia . "
58855	58868	58778	58778	He	1924	" And you do not believe in his having sailed for Australia ? "
58869	58874	58761	58761	she	150	" I do not . "
58875	58880	58761	58761	she	150	" But why not ? "
58881	58896	58778	58778	He	1924	" Forgive me , Lady Audley , if I decline to answer that question . "
58897	58902	58903	58903	she	1925	" As you please , "
58908	58916	58918	58918	Robert	173	" A week after my friend disappeared , "
58920	59030	58918	58918	Robert	173	" I posted an advertisement to the Sydney and Melbourne papers , calling upon him if he was in either city when the advertisement appeared , to write and tell me of his whereabouts , and also calling on any one who had met him , either in the colonies or on the voyage out , to give me any information respecting him . George Talboys left Essex , or disappeared from Essex , on the 6th of September last . I ought to receive some answer to this advertisement by the end of this month . To - day is the 27th ; the time draws very near . "
59031	59039	59041	59042	Lady Audley	150	" And if you receive no answer ? "
59044	59070	59041	59042	Lady Audley	150	" If I receive no answer I shall think that my fears have been not unfounded , and I shall do my best to act . "
59071	59079	58778	58778	He	1924	" What do you mean by that ? "
59080	59287	59292	59292	Robert	173	" Ah , Lady Audley , you remind me how very powerless I am in this matter . My friend might have been made away with in this very inn , and I might stay here for a twelvemonth , and go away at the last as ignorant of his fate as if I had never crossed the threshold . What do we know of the mysteries that may hang about the houses we enter ? If I were to go to - morrow into that commonplace , plebeian , eight - roomed house in which Maria Manning and her husband murdered their guest , I should have no awful prescience of that bygone horror . Foul deeds have been done under the most hospitable roofs ; terrible crimes have been committed amid the fairest scenes , and have left no trace upon the spot where they were done . I do not believe in mandrake , or in bloodstains that no time can efface . I believe rather that we may walk unconsciously in an atmosphere of crime , and breathe none the less freely . I believe that we may look into the smiling face of a murderer , and admire its tranquil beauty . "
59296	59310	59311	59311	she	468	" You seem to have quite a taste for discussing these horrible subjects , "
59317	59328	59311	59311	she	468	" you ought to have been a detective police officer . "
59329	59341	59292	59292	Robert	173	" I sometimes think I should have been a good one . "
59342	59345	59292	59292	Robert	173	" Why ? "
59346	59352	59311	59311	she	468	" Because I am patient . "
59353	59382	59292	59292	Robert	173	" But to return to Mr. George Talboys , whom we lost sight of in your eloquent discussion . What if you receive no answer to your advertisements ? "
59383	59397	59292	59292	Robert	173	" I shall then consider myself justified in concluding my friend is dead . "
59398	59405	59311	59311	she	468	" Yes , and then — ? "
59406	59418	59292	59292	Robert	173	" I shall examine the effects he left at my chambers . "
59419	59441	59443	59444	Lady Audley	150	" Indeed ! and what are they ? Coats , waistcoats , varnished boots , and meerschaum pipes , I suppose , "
59448	59469	59443	59444	Lady Audley	150	" No ; letters — letters from his friends , his old schoolfellows , his father , his brother officers . "
59470	59473	59292	59292	Robert	173	" Yes ? "
59474	59483	59484	59484	My	0	" Letters , too , from his wife . "
59499	59515	59516	59516	she	468	" Have you ever seen any of the letters written by the late Mrs. Talboys ? "
59520	59569	59516	59516	she	468	" Never . Poor soul ! her letters are not likely to throw much light upon my friend 's fate . I dare say she wrote the usual womanly scrawl . There are very few who write so charming and uncommon a hand as yours , Lady Audley . "
59570	59581	59484	59485	My lady	468	" Ah , you know my hand , of course . "
59582	59592	59593	59593	My	0	" Yes , I know it very well indeed . "
59623	59635	59636	59636	she	468	" You have refused to accept my apology , Mr. Audley , "
59639	59655	59636	59636	she	468	" but I trust you are not the less assured of my feelings toward you . "
59656	59663	59593	59593	My	0	" Perfectly assured , Lady Audley . "
59664	59698	59728	59728	her	468	" Then good - by , and let me recommend you not to stay long in this miserable draughty place , if you do not wish to take rheumatism back to Figtree Court . "
59699	59715	59636	59636	she	468	" I shall return to town to - morrow morning to see after my letters . "
59716	59724	59725	59725	She	468	" Then once more good - by . "
59851	59862	59863	59863	he	173	" Have you taken Lady Audley back to the Court ? "
59882	59906	59863	59863	he	173	" No , sir ; I 've just come from the Brentwood station . My lady started for London by the 12.40 train . "
59907	59911	59863	59863	he	173	" For town ? "
59912	59917	59863	59863	he	173	" Yes , sir . "
59918	59925	59927	59927	Robert	173	" My lady gone to London ! "
59939	59966	59927	59927	Robert	173	" Then I 'll follow her by the next train ; and if I 'm not very much mistaken , I know where to find her . "
60205	60305	60193	60194	the barrister	955	" Perhaps , when that gentleman who is making such a noise about a pointer with liver - colored spots , has discovered the particular pointer and spots that he wants — which happy combination of events scarcely seems likely to arrive — they'll give me my luggage and let me go . The designing wretches knew at a glance that I was born to be imposed upon ; and that if they were to trample the life out of me upon this very platform , I should never have the spirit to bring an action against the company . "
60441	60447	60448	60448	she	1954	" I beg your pardon , "
60477	60485	60474	60474	she	1954	" Robert , you in London already ? "
60486	60507	60474	60474	she	1954	" Yes , Lady Audley ; you were quite right ; the Castle Inn is a dismal place , and — "
60508	60536	60474	60474	she	1954	" You got tired of it — I knew you would . Please open the carriage door for me : the train will start in two minutes . "
60554	60560	60561	60561	he	173	" What does it mean ? "
60564	60615	60616	60616	He	173	" She is altogether a different being to the wretched , helpless creature who dropped her mask for a moment , and looked at me with her own pitiful face , in the little room at Mount Stanning , four hours ago . What has happened to cause the change ? "
60660	60673	60674	60674	she	1960	" Thank you very much ; how good you are to me , "
60682	60756	60674	60674	she	1960	" You will think me very foolish to travel upon such a day , without my dear darling 's knowledge too ; but I went up to town to settle a very terrific milliner 's bill , which I did not wish my best of husbands to see ; for , indulgent as he is , he might think me extravagant ; and I can not bear to suffer even in his thoughts . "
60757	60768	60769	60769	Robert	173	" Heaven forbid that you ever should , Lady Audley , "
60793	60800	60801	60801	she	1960	" Heaven forbid it , indeed , "
60804	60813	60801	60801	she	1960	" I do n't think I ever shall . "
60840	60852	60853	60853	he	173	" Whatever object brought her to London has been successfully accomplished , "
60856	60914	60853	60853	he	173	" Has she baffled me by some piece of womanly jugglery ? Am I never to get any nearer to the truth , but am I to be tormented all my life by vague doubts , and wretched suspicions , which may grow upon me till I become a monomaniac ? Why did she come to London ? "
61230	61234	61224	61224	her	1974	" the master , "
61240	61278	61224	61224	her	1974	" I only sent for you to ask if anybody has been here ; that is to say , if anybody has applied to you for the key of my rooms to - day — any lady ? "
61279	61305	61224	61224	her	1974	" Lady ? No , indeed , yer honor ; there 's been no lady for the kay ; barrin ' it 's the blacksmith . "
61306	61310	61401	61401	she	202	" The blacksmith ! "
61311	61325	61224	61224	her	1974	" Yes ; the blacksmith your honor ordered to come to - day . "
61326	61332	61334	61334	Robert	173	" I order a blacksmith ! "
61336	61348	61349	61349	he	173	" I left a bottle of French brandy in the cupboard , "
61352	61362	61349	61349	he	173	" and Mrs. M. has been evidently enjoying herself . "
61363	61378	61380	61381	Mrs. Maloney	202	" Sure , and the blacksmith your honor tould to see to the locks , "
61383	61400	61401	61401	she	202	" It 's him that lives down in one of the little streets by the bridge , "
61423	61436	61437	61437	he	173	" If you 'll sit down and compose yourself , Mrs. M. , "
61453	61474	61440	61440	he	173	labor—"perhaps we shall be able by and by to understand each other . You say a blacksmith has been here ? "
61475	61483	61440	61440	he	173	" Sure and I did , sir . "
61484	61489	61440	61440	he	173	" To - day ? "
61490	61496	61440	61440	he	173	" Quite correct , sir . "
61612	61627	61628	61629	Mr. Audley	173	" But you were with him while he examined the locks , I suppose ? "
61632	61678	61628	61629	Mr. Audley	173	" Sure I was , sir , in and out , as you may say , all the time , for I 've been cleaning the stairs this afternoon , and I took the opportunity to begin my scouring while the man was at work . "
61679	61727	61766	61766	she	202	" Oh , you were in and out all the time . If you could conveniently give me a plain answer , Mrs. M. , I should be glad to know what was the longest time that you were out while the locksmith was in my chambers ? "
61786	61793	61796	61796	she	202	" thim stairs , your honor ; "
61830	61837	61838	61838	he	173	" Never mind , Mrs. M. , "
61841	61867	61838	61838	he	173	" the locksmith had plenty of time to do anything he wanted to do , I dare say , without your being any the wiser . "
61880	61905	61868	61869	Mrs. Maloney	202	" Sure , there was n't anything for him to stale , your honor , barrin ' the birds and the geran'ums , and — "
61906	61937	61838	61838	he	173	" No , no , I understand . There , that 'll do , Mrs. M. Tell me where the man lives , and I 'll go and see him . "
61938	61951	61868	61869	Mrs. Maloney	202	" But you 'll have a bit of dinner first , sir ? "
61952	61966	61967	61967	He	542	" I 'll go and see the locksmith before I have my dinner . "
61984	61993	61967	61967	He	542	" The man 's address , Mrs. M ? "
62093	62096	62091	62091	Robert	173	" Hulloa ! "
62321	62326	62327	62327	he	173	" And with that , "
62330	62341	62327	62327	he	173	" she walked off , as graceful as you please . "
62399	62409	62410	62410	Robert	173	" You called at my chambers to - day , "
62415	62425	62410	62410	Robert	173	" Do n't let me disturb you , ladies . "
62433	62448	62449	62450	The man	634	" You called at my chambers to - day , Mr. White , and — "
62454	62472	62473	62473	he	634	" I hope , sir , you will be so good as to look over the mistake , "
62476	62586	62449	62450	The man	634	" I 'm sure , sir , I 'm very sorry it should have occurred . I was sent for to another gentleman 's chambers , Mr. Aulwin , in Garden Court ; and the name slipped my memory ; and havin' done odd jobs before for you , I thought it must be you as wanted me to - day ; and I called at Mrs. Maloney 's for the key accordin ' ; but directly I see the locks in your chambers , I says to myself , the gentleman 's locks ai n't out of order ; the gentleman do n't want all his locks repaired . "
62587	62595	62410	62410	Robert	173	" But you stayed half an hour . "
62596	62672	62770	62770	he	173	" Yes , sir ; for there was one lock out of order — the door nighest the staircase — and I took it off and cleaned it and put it on again . I wo n't charge you nothin' for the job , and I hope as you 'll be as good as to look over the mistake as has occurred , which I 've been in business thirteen years come July , and — "
62673	62685	62687	62687	Robert	173	" Nothing of this kind ever happened before , I suppose , "
62691	62758	62687	62687	Robert	173	" No , it 's altogether a singular kind of business , not likely to come about every day . You 've been enjoying yourself this evening I see , Mr. White . You 've done a good stroke of work to - day , I 'll wager — made a lucky hit , and you 're what you call ' standing treat , ' eh ? "
62811	62815	62806	62806	Hamlet	231	" is common ; "
62846	62849	62836	62836	he	229	" missus , "
62911	62917	62918	62918	he	173	" Pray do n't apologize , "
62921	62942	62918	62918	he	173	" I like to see people enjoy themselves . Good - night , Mr. White good - night , ladies . "
62948	62952	62954	62955	the missus	6011	" the missus , "
62977	62981	62982	62982	he	173	" And so , "
62994	63096	63097	63097	He	173	" ' with that she walked off as graceful as you please . 'Who was it that walked off ; and what was the story which the locksmith was telling when I interrupted him at that sentence ? Oh , George Talboys , George Talboys , am I ever to come any nearer to the secret of your fate ? Am I coming nearer to it now , slowly but surely ? Is the radius to grow narrower day by day until it draws a dark circle around the home of those I love ? How is it all to end ? "
63197	63223	63224	63224	he	173	" Her cutlets a la Maintenon made mutton seem more than mutton ; a sublimated meat that could scarcely have grown upon any mundane sheep , "
63228	63250	63224	63224	he	173	" and Mrs. Maloney 's chops are apt to be tough ; but such is life — what does it matter ? "
63263	63280	63281	63281	he	173	" I have never eaten a good dinner at this table since I lost George Talboys , "
63284	63366	63281	63281	he	173	" The place seems as gloomy as if the poor fellow had died in the next room , and had never been taken away to be buried . How long ago that September afternoon appears as I look back at it — that September afternoon upon which I parted with him alive and well ; and lost him as suddenly and unaccountably as if a trap - door had opened in the solid earth and let him through to the antipodes ! "
63448	63454	63455	63455	he	173	" Heaven help us all , "
63459	63477	63455	63455	he	173	" is this paper with which no attorney has had any hand to be my first brief ? "
63573	63591	63593	63593	Robert	173	" There 'd be no need for any one to break open such a lock as this , "
63954	63961	63962	63962	he	173	" I will keep these out , "
63965	63978	63962	63962	he	173	" there may be something to help me in one of them . "
64197	64201	64214	64215	Mrs. Maloney	202	" Cousine Bette . "
64288	64297	64298	64298	he	173	" Why do I go on with this , "
64301	64552	64298	64298	he	173	" when I know that it is leading me , step by step , day by day , hour by hour , nearer to that conclusion which , of all others , I should avoid ? Am I tied to a wheel , and must I go with its every revolution , let it take me where it will ? Or can I sit down here to - night and say I have done my duty to my missing friend , I have searched for him patiently , but I have searched in vain ? Should I be justified in doing this ? Should I be justified in letting the chain which I have slowly put together , link by link , drop at this point , or must I go on adding fresh links to that fatal chain until the last rivet drops into its place and the circle is complete ? I think , and I believe , that I shall never see my friend 's face again ; and that no exertion of mine can ever be of any benefit to him . In plainer , crueler words I believe him to be dead . Am I bound to discover how and where he died ? or being , as I think , on the road to that discovery , shall I do a wrong to the memory of George Talboys by turning back or stopping still ? What am I to do?—what am I to do ? "
64716	64723	64724	64724	he	2047	" Justice to the dead first , "
64727	64734	64724	64724	he	2047	" mercy to the living afterward . "
65478	65486	65488	65490	the young man	667	" I thought it would be so , "
65500	65539	65488	65490	the young man	667	" God knows I was prepared for the worst , and the worst has come . I can understand all now . My next visit must be to Southampton . I must place the boy in better hands . "
65919	65930	65931	65931	he	173	" I will run into Dorsetshire after I leave Southampton , "
65934	66047	65931	65931	he	173	" and see this man . If he is content to let his son 's fate rest a dark and cruel mystery to all who knew him — if he is content to go down to his grave uncertain to the last of this poor fellow 's end — why should I try to unravel the tangled skein , to fit the pieces of the terrible puzzle , and gather together the stray fragments which , when collected , may make such a hideous whole ? I will go to him and lay my darkest doubts freely before him . It will be for him to say what I am to do . "
66195	66211	66212	66212	he	5094	" Who would have thought that I could have grown so fond of the fellow , "
66215	66309	66212	66212	he	5094	" or feel so lonely without him ? I 've a comfortable little fortune in the three per cents . ; I 'm heir presumptive to my uncle 's title ; and I know of a certain dear little girl who , as I think , would do her best to make me happy ; but I declare that I would freely give up all , and stand penniless in the world to - morrow , if this mystery could be satisfactorily cleared away , and George Talboys could stand by my side . "
66692	66706	66707	66707	he	173	" The poor child shall not sleep another night in this wretched hovel , "
66722	66743	66707	66707	he	173	" He is the legacy of my best friend , and it shall be my business to secure his safety . "
67196	67206	67207	67207	she	5008	" Mr. Maldon is not at home , sir , "
67214	67232	67207	67207	she	5008	" but if it 's for the water - rate , he requested me to say that — "
67261	67266	67267	67267	he	157	" I know you , "
67270	67314	67267	67267	he	157	" you came to Ventnor with the big gentleman , and you came here once , and you gave me some money , and I gave it to gran'pa to take care of , and gran'pa kept it , and he always does . "
67335	67341	67342	67342	he	173	" Stand there , Georgey , "
67345	67356	67342	67342	he	173	" I want to have a good look at you . "
67379	67402	67403	67403	he	173	" You are growing more like your father every day , Georgey ; and you 're growing quite a man , too , "
67406	67415	67403	67403	he	173	" would you like to go to school ? "
67416	67430	67431	67432	the boy	5049	" Oh , yes , please , I should like it very much , "
67437	67594	67431	67432	the boy	5049	" I went to school at Miss Pevins ' once — day - school , you know — round the corner in the next street ; but I caught the measles , and gran'pa would n't let me go any more , for fear I should catch the measles again ; and gran'pa wo n't let me play with the little boys in the street , because they 're rude boys ; he said blackguard boys ; but he said I must n't say blackguard boys , because it 's naughty . He says damn and devil , but he says he may because he 's old . I shall say damn and devil when I 'm old ; and I should like to go to school , please , and I can go to - day , if you like ; Mrs. Plowson will get my frocks ready , wo n't you , Mrs. Plowson ? "
67595	67607	67608	67609	the woman	5008	" Certainly , Master Georgey , if your grandpapa wishes it , "
67620	67631	67635	67635	he	173	" What on earth is the matter with this woman , "
67666	67728	67729	67730	Mrs. Plowson	241	" Does she still take me for a tax - collector with inimical intentions toward these wretched goods and chattels ; or can the cause of her fidgety manner lie deeper still . That 's scarcely likely , though ; for whatever secrets Lieutenant Maldon may have , it 's not very probable that this woman has any knowledge of them . "
67759	67770	67771	67771	he	173	" What are you going to do with the child ? "
67774	67796	67798	67799	the woman	5008	" I was only going to take him away to wash his pretty face , sir , and smooth his hair , "
67817	67851	67852	67852	She	5008	" You do n't see him to any advantage , sir , while his precious face is dirty . I wo n't be five minutes making him as neat as a new pin . "
67882	67895	67896	67896	he	173	" I 'd rather see him as he is , thank you , "
67899	67923	67896	67896	he	173	" My time in Southampton is n't very long , and I want to hear all that the little man can tell me . "
67942	67949	67950	67950	he	173	" I like you very much , "
67953	67982	67950	67950	he	173	" I was frightened of you when you came before , because I was shy . I am not shy now — I am nearly six years old . "
68027	68042	68044	68044	Robert	173	" You 're rather fidgety about some one , ma'am , I 'm afraid , "
68064	68074	68075	68075	she	2162	" I was looking for Mr. Maldon , sir , "
68078	68091	68075	68075	she	2162	" he 'll be so disappointed if he does n't see you . "
68092	68101	68075	68075	she	2162	" You know who I am , then ? "
68102	68109	68110	68111	The boy	5049	" No , sir , but — "
68129	68140	68141	68141	he	173	" This is the watch the pretty lady gave me , "
68144	68234	68141	68141	he	173	" I 've got it now — but I have n't had it long , because the jeweler who cleans it is an idle man , gran'pa says , and always keeps it such a long time ; and gran'pa says it will have to be cleaned again , because of the taxes . He always takes it to be cleaned when there 's taxes — but he says if he were to lose it the pretty lady would give me another . Do you know the pretty lady ? "
68235	68246	68247	68248	Mrs. Plowson	241	" No , Georgey , but tell me about her . "
68297	68307	68308	68308	he	173	" The boy will do very well , ma'am , "
68311	68346	68308	68308	he	173	" if you 'll be good enough to let him alone for five minutes . Now , Georgey , suppose you sit on my knee , and tell me all about the pretty lady . "
68375	68386	68387	68387	he	173	" I 'll tell you all about the pretty lady , "
68390	68448	68450	68451	the boy	5049	" because I like you very much . Gran'pa told me not to tell anybody , but I 'll tell you , you know , because I like you , and because you 're going to take me to school . The pretty lady came here one night — long ago — oh , so long ago , "
68471	68545	68546	68546	Georgey	187	" She came when I was not nearly so big as I am now — and she came at night — after I 'd gone to bed , and she came up into my room , and sat upon the bed , and cried — and she left the watch under my pillow , and she — Why do you make faces at me , Mrs. Plowson ? I may tell this gentleman , "
68580	68600	68602	68603	Robert Audley	173	" Suppose you wait till I say so , ma'am , before you stop the little fellow 's mouth , "
68607	68642	68643	68643	He	173	" A suspicious person might think from your manner that Mr. Maldon and you had some conspiracy between you , and that you were afraid of what the boy 's talk may let slip . "
68710	68719	68720	68720	he	173	" Do n't be cross to Mrs. Plowson , "
68723	68757	68720	68720	he	173	" Mrs. Plowson is very kind to me . Mrs. Plowson is Matilda 's mother . You do n't know Matilda . Poor Matilda was always crying ; she was ill , she — "
68846	68860	68861	68861	he	694	" You 're a prett ' creature to call yoursel ' sensible woman ? "
68864	68931	68932	68934	the old man	694	" Why do n't you take th ' chile ' way , er wash 's face ? D'yer want to ruin me ? D'yer want to ' stroy me ? Take th ' chile ' way ! Mr. Audley , sir , I 'm ver ' glad to see yer ; ver ' ' appy to ' ceive yer in m ' humbl ' ' bode , "
68958	68966	68968	68968	Robert	173	" Whatever this man 's secrets are , "
68982	69042	68971	68972	Mrs. Plowson	241	" that woman has no unimportant share of them . Whatever the mystery may be , it grows darker and thicker at every step ; but I try in vain to draw back or to stop short upon the road , for a stronger hand than my own is pointing the way to my lost friend 's unknown grave . "
69043	69058	69059	69059	Robert	173	" I am going to take your grandson away with me , Mr. Maldon , "
69152	69157	69158	69158	he	242	" Yes , yes , "
69163	69179	69158	69158	he	242	" take the boy away from his poor old grandfather ; I always thought so . "
69180	69191	69158	69158	he	242	" You always thought that I should take him away ? "
69203	69213	69158	69158	he	242	" Why did you think so , Mr. Maldon ? "
69236	69243	69231	69232	the lieutenant	2137	" Thought so—'cause I thought so . "
69263	69277	69252	69252	he	242	" Because I thought you or his father would fetch ' m away . "
69278	69301	69252	69252	he	242	" When I was last in this house , Mr. Maldon , you told me that George Talboys had sailed for Australia . "
69302	69313	69314	69316	the old man	694	" Yes , yes — I know , I know , "
69331	69367	69368	69368	He	694	hands—"I know ; but he might have come back — mightn't he ? He was restless , and — and — queer in his mind , perhaps , sometimes . He might have come back . "
69484	69488	69489	69489	he	694	" Mr. Maldon , "
69503	69552	69489	69489	he	694	" George Talboys never sailed for Australia — that I know . More than this , he never came to Southampton ; and the lie you told me on the 8th of last September was dictated to you by the telegraphic message which you received on that day . "
69602	69664	69583	69583	he	694	" The lie was dictated to you , and you repeated your lesson . But you no more saw George Talboys here on the 7th of September than I see him in this room now . You thought you had burnt the telegraphic message , but you had only burnt a part of it — the remainder is in my possession . "
69672	69678	69679	69679	he	242	" What have I done ? "
69684	69695	69679	69679	he	242	" Oh , my God ! what have I done ? "
69696	69707	69583	69583	he	694	" At two o'clock on the 7th of September last , "
69715	69729	69583	69583	he	694	" George Talboys was seen alive and well at a house in Essex . "
69781	69789	69791	69792	Robert Audley	173	" At two o'clock on that day , "
69794	69880	69791	69792	Robert Audley	173	" my poor friend was seen alive and well at — — , at the house of which I speak . From that hour to this I have never been able to hear that he has been seen by any living creature . I have taken such steps as must have resulted in procuring the information of his whereabouts , were he alive . I have done this patiently and carefully — at first , even hopefully . Now I know that he is dead . "
69926	69935	69937	69938	the lieutenant	2137	" No , no , no , no , "
69949	70014	69937	69938	the lieutenant	2137	" no , no ! For God 's sake , do n't say that ! Do n't think it — don't let me think it — don't let me dream of it ! Not dead — anything but dead ! Hidden away , perhaps — bribed to keep out of the way , perhaps ; but not dead — not dead — not dead ! "
70064	70068	70070	70070	Robert	173	" I believe , "
70080	70099	70070	70070	Robert	173	" that my friend left Essex ; and I believe he died on the 7th of September last . "
70130	70143	70144	70144	he	2200	" Oh ! no , no — for God 's , no ! "
70148	70168	70144	70144	he	2200	" No ! you do n't know what you say — you do n't know what your words mean ! "
70169	70195	70227	70227	he	694	" I know their weight and value only too well — as well as I see you do , Mr. Maldon . God help us ! "
70196	70209	70211	70213	the old man	694	" Oh , what am I doing ? what am I doing ? "
70282	70328	70277	70277	he	694	" You have no right to come here and terrify a man who has been drinking , and who is not quite himself . You have no right to do it , Mr. Audley . Even the — the officer , sir , who — who—. "
70353	70370	70371	70371	He	694	" The officer , I repeat , sir , who arrests a — thief , or a—. "
70394	70401	70402	70402	His	694	" A thief or a murderer — "
70430	70534	70427	70427	he	694	" Gives him warning , sir , fair warning , that he may say nothing which shall commit himself — or — or — other people . The — the — law , sir , has that amount of mercy for a — a — suspected criminal . But you , sir,—you come to my house , and you come at a time when — when — contrary to my usual habits — which , as people will tell you , are sober — you take the opportunity to — terrify me — and it is not right , sir — it is — "
70656	70663	70664	70664	he	173	" If I had known this , "
70667	70687	70664	70664	he	173	" I might have spared him . It would have been better , perhaps , to have spared him . "
70827	70836	70837	70837	he	173	" Why do I go on with this ? "
70840	70883	70837	70837	he	173	" how pitiless I am , and how relentlessly I am carried on . It is not myself ; it is the hand which is beckoning me further and further upon the dark road , whose end I dare not dream of . "
70920	70924	70925	70926	Robert Audley	173	" Mr. Maldon , "
70933	70981	70982	70982	he	173	" I do not ask you to forgive me for what I have brought upon you , for the feeling is strong within me that it must have come to you sooner or later — if not through me , through some one else . There are — "
71020	71368	71369	71371	The old man	694	" There are some things which , as people say , can not be hidden . I think there is truth in that common saying which had its origin in that old worldly wisdom which people gathered from experience and not from books . If — if I were content to let my friend rest in his hidden grave , it is but likely that some stranger who had never heard the name of George Talboys , might fall by the remotest accident upon the secret of his death . To - morrow , perhaps ; or ten years hence , or in another generation , when the — the hand that wronged him is as cold as his own . If I could let the matter rest ; if — if I could leave England forever , and purposely fly from the possibility of ever coming across another clew to the secret , I would do it — I would gladly , thankfully do it — but I can not ! A hand which is stronger than my own beckons me on . I wish to take no base advantage of you , less than of all other people ; but I must go on ; I must go on . If there is any warning you would give to any one , give it . If the secret toward which I am traveling day by day , hour by hour , involves any one in whom you have an interest , let that person fly before I come to the end . Let them leave this country ; let them leave all who know them — all whose peace their wickedness has endangered ; let them go away — they shall not be pursued . But if they slight your warning — if they try to hold their present position in defiance of what it will be in your power to tell them — let them beware of me , for , when the hour comes , I swear that I will not spare them . "
71390	71402	71403	71403	he	694	" I declare to you that I do not understand you , "
71406	71429	71403	71403	he	694	" I solemnly declare to you that I can not understand ; and I do not believe that George Talboys is dead . "
71430	71447	71449	71449	Robert	173	" I would give ten years of my own life if I could see him alive , "
71453	71471	71449	71449	Robert	173	" I am sorry for you , Mr. Maldon — I am sorry for all of us . "
71472	71487	71489	71490	the lieutenant	2137	" I do not believe that my son - in - law is dead , "
71492	71504	71505	71505	He	2137	" I do not believe that the poor lad is dead . "
71572	71577	71579	71580	Mrs. Plowson	241	" Dear heart alive ! "
71582	71606	71579	71580	Mrs. Plowson	241	" what has the poor old gentleman been taking on about ? We could hear him in the passage , sobbin ' awful . "
71627	71634	71635	71635	he	2137	" Do n't cry , gran'pa , "
71638	71712	71714	71715	the boy	5049	" do n't cry . You shall have my watch to be cleaned , and the kind jeweler shall lend you the money to pay the taxman while he cleans the watch — I do n't mind , gran'pa . Let 's go to the jeweler , the jeweler in High street , you know , with golden balls painted upon his door , to show that he comes from Lombar — Lombardshire , "
71724	71729	71714	71715	the boy	5049	" Come , gran'pa . "
71763	71770	71771	71771	he	5052	" There are wolves at Southampton , "
71783	71811	71771	71771	he	5052	" My gran'pa says when he takes my watch that he does it to keep the wolf from the door . Are there wolves where you live ? "
71836	71850	71851	71851	he	5052	" Your grandpapa does not want the watch to - day , Georgey , "
71856	71864	71866	71866	Georgey	187	" Why is he sorry , then ? "
71870	71886	71851	71851	he	5052	" when he wants the watch he is always sorry , and beats his poor forehead so"—the
71894	72003	71892	71892	his	5035	fists—"and says that she — the pretty lady , I think he means — uses him very hard , and that he ca n't keep the wolf from the door ; and then I say , ' Gran'pa , have the watch ; ' and then he takes me in his arms , and says , ' Oh , my blessed angel ! how can I rob my blessed angel ? ' and then he cries , but not like to - day — not loud , you know ; only tears running down his poor cheeks , not so that you could hear him in the passage . "
72074	72080	72081	72081	she	241	" Poor dear old gentleman , "
72088	72097	72081	72081	she	241	" What has happened to upset him so ? "
72098	72108	72110	72111	Mr. Audley	173	" His son - in - law is dead , "
72123	72147	72117	72118	Mrs. Plowson	241	" He died , within a year and a half after the death of Helen Talboys , who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard . "
72192	72198	72199	72199	she	241	" Poor Mr. Talboys dead ! "
72202	72211	72199	72199	she	241	" that is bad news indeed , sir . "
72227	72232	72233	72233	he	246	" Who 's dead ? "
72236	72247	72233	72233	he	246	" George Talboys is my name . Who 's dead ? "
72248	72258	72218	72219	his guardian	2155	" Another person whose name is Talboys , Georgey . "
72259	72272	72273	72274	The boy	5049	" Poor person ! Will he go to the pit - hole ? "
72309	72323	72324	72324	Georgey	187	" I should like to see him put in the pit - hole , "
72388	72404	72406	72407	Robert Audley	173	" You have no objection to my taking Georgey away with me , Mr. Maldon ? "
72451	72460	72422	72422	He	173	" You do not object , Mr. Maldon ? "
72461	72633	72422	72422	He	173	" No , sir — no , sir ; you are his guardian , and you have a right to take him where you please . He has been a very great comfort to me in my lonely old age , but I have been prepared to lose him . I — I may not have always done my duty to him , sir , in — in the way of schooling , and — and boots . The number of boots which boys of his age wear out , sir , is not easily realized by the mind of a young man like yourself ; he has been kept away from school , perhaps , sometimes , and occasionally worn shabby boots when our funds have got low ; but he has not been unkindly treated . No , sir ; if you were to question him for a week , I do n't think you 'd hear that his poor old grandfather ever said a harsh word to him . "
72662	72666	72668	72669	Robert Audley	173	" Mr. Maldon , "
72684	72777	72778	72778	he	2236	" when I looked at my position last night , I did not believe that I could ever come to think it more painful than I thought it then . I can only say — God have mercy upon us all . I feel it my duty to take the child away , but I shall take him straight from your house to the best school in Southampton ; and I give you my honor that I will extort nothing from his innocent simplicity which can in any manner — I mean , "
72785	72832	72778	72778	he	2236	" I mean this . I will not seek to come one step nearer the secret through him . I — I am not a detective officer , and I do not think the most accomplished detective would like to get his information from a child . "
72863	72872	72873	72873	he	2236	" Take the boy away , Mrs. Plowson , "
72880	72897	72873	72873	he	2236	" take him away and put his things on . He is going with Mr. Audley . "
72898	72920	72921	72922	Mrs. Plowson	241	" Which I do say that it 's not kind of the gentleman to take his poor grandpa 's pet away , "
72931	72937	72938	72940	the old man	694	" Hush , Mrs. Plowson , "
72945	72969	72938	72940	the old man	694	" Mr. Audley is the best judge . I — I have n't many years to live ; I sha'n't trouble anybody long . "
72993	73005	73006	73006	he	694	" God knows , I never injured your friend , sir , "
73023	73104	73106	73108	the old man	694	" nor even wished him any ill . He was a good son - in - law to me — better than many a son . I never did him any wilful wrong , sir . I — I spent his money , perhaps , but I am sorry for it — I am very sorry for it now . But I do n't believe he is dead — no , sir ; no , I do n't believe it ! "
73126	73145	73106	73108	the old man	694	" I — I do n't believe it , sir ! How — how should he be dead ? "
73235	73245	73246	73246	he	694	" Do n't be sorry for me , gran'pa , "
73249	73278	73279	73279	he	694	" I am going to school to learn to be a clever man , and I shall come home to see you and Mrs. Plowson , sha'n't I ? "
73286	73298	73279	73279	he	694	" Yes , my dear , by - and - by . "
73299	73310	73312	73313	Mr. Maldon	182	" Take him away , sir — take him away , "
73315	73322	73312	73313	Mr. Maldon	182	" you are breaking my heart . "
73792	73811	73812	73812	he	248	" I 've a vague recollection of getting a good deal of bread and milk and boiled mutton , "
73815	73840	73812	73812	he	248	" and I 've another vague recollection of not liking them . I wonder if this boy likes bread and milk and boiled mutton . "
73863	73873	73874	73874	he	248	" I dare say you 're hungry , Georgey ? "
73905	73913	73885	73886	the waiter	4929	" Perhaps you 'd like some lunch ? "
73929	73932	73933	73933	he	5049	" Lunch ! "
73936	73950	73933	73933	he	5049	" Why , it 's afternoon , and I 've had my dinner . "
73977	73988	73989	73989	he	248	" You shall have some bread and milk , Georgey , "
73994	74007	73989	73989	he	248	" Waiter , bread and milk , and a pint of hock . "
74015	74023	74024	74024	he	248	" I never have bread and milk , "
74027	74092	74093	74093	he	248	" I do n't like it . I like what gran'pa calls something savory . I should like a veal cutlet . Gran'pa told me he dined here once , and the veal cutlets were lovely , gran'pa said . Please may I have a veal cutlet , with egg and bread - crumb , you know , and lemon - juice you know ? "
74099	74141	74143	74144	Master Georgey	187	" Gran'pa knows the cook here . The cook 's such a nice gentleman , and once gave me a shilling , when gran'pa brought me here . The cook wears better clothes than gran'pa — better than yours , even , "
74188	74203	74204	74204	he	187	" I 'll tell you what I 'll do with you , little Georgey , "
74209	74215	74216	74217	The waiter	4929	pause—"I'll give you a dinner ! "
74221	74228	74229	74229	he	187	" Upon my word , sir , "
74234	74247	74229	74229	he	187	" I think the little gentleman will know how to eat it . "
74248	74258	74216	74217	The waiter	4929	" I 'll give you a dinner , Georgey , "
74260	74289	74229	74229	he	187	Robert—"some stewed eels , a little Julienne , a dish of cutlets , a bird , and a pudding . What do you say to that , Georgey ? "
74290	74309	74311	74312	the waiter	4929	" I do n't think the young gentleman will object to it when he sees it , sir , "
74314	74339	74311	74312	the waiter	4929	" Eels , Julienne , cutlets , bird , pudding — I'll go and tell the cook , sir . What time , sir ? "
74340	74421	74422	74423	Robert Audley	173	" Well , we 'll say six , and Master Georgey will get to his new school by bedtime . You can contrive to amuse the child for this afternoon , I dare say . I have some business to settle , and sha'n't be able to take him out . I shall sleep here to - night . Good - by , Georgey ; take care of yourself and try and get your appetite in order against six o'clock . "
74510	74520	74521	74521	he	173	" I shall start early to - morrow morning , "
74524	74564	74521	74521	he	173	" and see George 's father before nightfall . I will tell him all — all but the interest which I take in — in the suspected person , and he shall decide what is next to be done . "
74661	74673	74674	74674	he	173	" I 'm glad I 'm going to have new clothes , "
74685	74708	74674	74674	he	173	" for Mrs. Plowson has mended the old ones ever so many times . She can have them now , for Billy . "
74709	74714	74715	74715	Robert	173	" Who 's Billy ? "
74725	74750	74715	74715	Robert	173	" Billy is poor Matilda 's little boy . He 's a common boy , you know . Matilda was common , but she — "
75558	75575	75576	75577	Mr. Talboys	239	" My son did me an unpardonable wrong by marrying the daughter of a drunken pauper , "
75594	75680	75576	75577	Mr. Talboys	239	" and from that hour I had no longer a son . I wish him no ill . He is simply dead to me . I am sorry for him , as I am sorry for his mother who died nineteen years ago . If you talk to me of him as you would talk of the dead , I shall be ready to hear you . If you speak of him as you would speak of the living , I must decline to listen . "
75757	75787	75788	75790	the young man	667	" If I write to him , he will fold my letter with the envelope inside , and indorse it with my name and the date of its arrival , "
75794	75860	75788	75790	the young man	667	" and call everybody in the house to witness that it had not moved him to one softening recollection or one pitiful thought . He will stick to his resolution to his dying day . I dare say , if the truth was known , he is glad that his only son has offended him and given him the opportunity of parading his Roman virtues . "
75882	75887	75888	75888	he	157	" No my darling , "
75894	75975	75888	75888	he	157	" It 's very hard , perhaps , to be poor , but we will bear it . We wo n't go with pitiful faces to the stern father , and ask him to give us food and shelter , only to be refused in long , Johnsonian sentences , and made a classical example for the benefit of the neighborhood . No , my pretty one ; it is easy to starve , but it is difficult to stoop . "
76075	76083	76084	76084	she	554	" I thought dragoons were always rich , "
76091	76153	76084	76084	she	554	" Girls always want to marry dragoons ; and tradespeople always want to serve dragoons ; and hotel - keepers to entertain dragoons ; and theatrical managers to be patronized by dragoons . Who could have ever expected that a dragoon would drink sixpenny ale , smoke horrid bird's - eye tobacco , and let his wife wear a shabby bonnet ? "
76769	76779	76780	76780	Robert	173	" If the man is anything like his house , "
76783	76795	76780	76780	Robert	173	" I do n't wonder that poor George and he parted . "
77077	77087	77088	77088	he	2381	" If you will step this way , sir , "
77091	77120	77088	77088	he	2381	" Mr. Talboys will see you , although he is at breakfast . He begged me to state that everybody in Dorsetshire was acquainted with his breakfast hour . "
77160	77168	77169	77169	he	2381	" I do n't belong to Dorsetshire , "
77172	77200	77169	77169	he	2381	" Mr. Talboys might have known that , if he 'd done me the honor to exercise his powers of ratiocination . Drive on , my friend . "
77562	77566	77567	77567	he	173	" His sister ! "
77595	77623	77624	77625	The lady	673	" His sister , no doubt . He was fond of her , I know . Surely , she is not utterly indifferent as to his fate ? "
77674	77680	77686	77687	Mr. Talboys	239	" Sit down , Clara , "
77751	77757	77758	77758	he	4886	" Sit down , Clara , "
77761	77770	77758	77758	he	4886	" and keep your cotton in your workbox . "
77833	77844	77845	77845	he	4886	" Perhaps , Mr. — — , Mr. Robert Audley ! "
77861	77891	77892	77892	He	4886	" perhaps when you have finished looking for reels of cotton , you will be good enough to tell me to what I owe the honor of this visit ? "
77970	77977	77979	77980	Mr. Talboys	239	" You may remain , Wilson , "
77990	77998	77979	77980	Mr. Talboys	239	" Mr. Audley would perhaps like coffee . "
78048	78058	78060	78064	the master of the house	2374	" Mr. Audley will not take coffee , Wilson , "
78066	78071	78060	78064	the master of the house	2374	" You may go . "
78251	78263	78264	78264	he	239	" I wrote to you some time since , Mr. Talboys , "
78347	78356	78357	78357	he	173	" I received your communication , Mr. Audley , "
78360	78373	78357	78357	he	173	" It is among other business letters : it was duly answered . "
78374	78381	78397	78397	Robert	173	" That letter concerned your son . "
78428	78446	78448	78449	Mr. Audley	173	" She 's as heartless as her father , I expect , though she is like George , "
78451	78468	78470	78471	Harcourt Talboys	239	" If your letter concerned the person who was once my son , perhaps , sir , "
78473	78488	78470	78471	Harcourt Talboys	239	" I must ask you to remember that I have no longer a son . "
78489	78503	78505	78505	Robert	173	" You have no reason to remind me of that , Mr. Talboys , "
78509	78542	78505	78505	Robert	173	" I remember it only too well . I have fatal reason to believe that you have no longer a son . I have bitter cause to think that he is dead . "
78577	78580	78581	78581	he	173	" No , "
78584	78593	78581	78581	he	173	" no , I assure you , no . "
78594	78607	78608	78615	The girl who had been addressed as Clara	2424	" I believe that George Talboys died in the month of September . "
78674	78683	78685	78686	Mr. Talboys	239	" No , no , I assure you , "
78688	78696	78685	78686	Mr. Talboys	239	" you labor under a sad mistake . "
78697	78710	78712	78712	Robert	173	" You believe that I am mistaken in thinking your son dead ? "
78714	78718	78720	78721	Mr. Talboys	239	" Most certainly , "
78734	78888	78720	78721	Mr. Talboys	239	" Most certainly , my dear sir . The disappearance was a very clever trick , no doubt , but it was not sufficiently clever to deceive me . You must permit me to understand this matter a little better than you , Mr. Audley , and you must also permit me to assure you of three things . In the first place , your friend is not dead . In the second place , he is keeping out of the way for the purpose of alarming me , of trifling with my feelings as a — as a man who was once his father , and of ultimately obtaining my forgiveness . In the third place , he will not obtain that forgiveness , however long he may please to keep out of the way ; and he would therefore act wisely by returning to his ordinary residence and avocations without delay . "
78889	78909	78685	78686	Mr. Talboys	239	" Then you imagine him to purposely hide himself from all who know him , for the purpose of — "
78910	78918	78920	78921	Mr. Talboys	239	" For the purpose of influencing me , "
78957	79053	79055	79056	Mr. Talboys	239	" For the purpose of influencing me . He knew the inflexibility of my character ; to a certain degree he was acquainted with me , and knew that all attempts at softening my decision , or moving me from the fixed purpose of my life , would fail . He therefore tried extraordinary means ; he has kept out of the way in order to alarm me , and when after due time he discovers that he has not alarmed me , he will return to his old haunts . When he does so , "
79062	79141	79055	79056	Mr. Talboys	239	" I will forgive him . Yes , sir , I will forgive him . I shall say to him : You have attempted to deceive me , and I have shown you that I am not to be deceived ; you have tried to frighten me , and I have convinced you that I am not to be frightened ; you did not believe in my generosity , I will show you that I can be generous . "
79173	79191	79192	79192	he	173	" Heaven grant that you may have an opportunity of saying this to your son , sir , "
79196	79254	79255	79255	he	173	" I am very glad to find that you are willing to forgive him , but I fear that you will never see him again upon this earth . I have a great deal to say to you upon this — this sad subject , Mr. Talboys ; but I would rather say it to you alone , "
79266	79279	79281	79282	Harcourt Talboys	239	" My daughter knows my ideas upon this subject , Mr. Audley , "
79284	79308	79309	79309	he	173	" there is no reason why she should not hear all you have to say . Miss Clara Talboys , Mr. Robert Audley , "
79330	79336	79337	79337	he	173	" Let her hear it , "
79340	79367	79321	79321	her	5100	" If she has so little feeling as to show no emotion upon such a subject , let her hear the worst I have to tell . "
79400	79411	79412	79412	he	173	" I shall require all your attention , Mr. Talboys , "
79415	79502	79412	79412	he	173	" for that which I have to disclose to you is of a very painful nature . Your son was my very dear friend — dear to me for many reasons . Perhaps most of all dear , because I had known him and been with him through the great trouble of his life ; and because he stood comparatively alone in the world — cast off by you who should have been his best friend , bereft of the only woman he had ever loved . "
79503	79511	79512	79513	Mr. Talboys	239	" The daughter of a drunken pauper , "
79518	79533	79535	79536	Robert Audley	173	" Had he died in his bed , as I sometimes thought he would , "
79538	79632	79535	79536	Robert Audley	173	" of a broken heart , I should have mourned for him very sincerely , even though I had closed his eyes with my own hands , and had seen him laid in his quiet resting - place . I should have grieved for my old schoolfellow , and for the companion who had been dear to me . But this grief would have been a very small one compared to that which I feel now , believing , as I do only too firmly , that my poor friend has been murdered . "
79633	79636	79637	79638	The father	2066	" Murdered ! "
79678	79686	79688	79689	Harcourt Talboys	239	" Mr. Audley , you are mad ! "
79691	79736	79688	79689	Harcourt Talboys	239	" you are mad , or else you are commissioned by your friend to play upon my feelings . I protest against this proceeding as a conspiracy , and I — I revoke my intended forgiveness of the person who was once my son ! "
79761	79775	79777	79777	Robert	173	" It is far from my wish to alarm you unnecessarily , sir , "
79779	79884	79777	79777	Robert	173	" Heaven grant that you may be right and I wrong . I pray for it , but I can not think it — I can not even hope it . I come to you for advice . I will state to you plainly and dispassionately the circumstances which have aroused my suspicions . If you say those suspicions are foolish and unfounded I am ready to submit to your better judgment . I will leave England ; and I abandon my search for the evidence wanting to — to confirm my fears . If you say go on , I will go on . "
80097	80102	80103	80103	he	173	" Now , sir , "
80113	80140	80103	80103	he	173	" I await your decision . You have heard my reasons for coming to this terrible conclusion . In what manner do these reasons influence you ? "
80141	80155	80157	80159	Mr. Harcourt Talboys	239	" They do n't in any way turn me from my previous opinion , "
80170	80206	80157	80159	Mr. Harcourt Talboys	239	" I still think , as I thought before , that my son is alive , and that his disappearance is a conspiracy against myself . I decline to become the victim of that conspiracy . "
80207	80215	80217	80217	Robert	173	" And you tell me to stop ? "
80221	80265	80217	80217	Robert	173	" I tell you only this : If you go on , you go on for your own satisfaction , not for mine . I see nothing in what you have told me to alarm me for the safety of — your friend . "
80266	80273	80275	80275	Robert	173	" So be it , then ! "
80279	80305	80275	80275	Robert	173	" from this moment I wash my hands of this business . From this moment the purpose of my life shall be to forget it . "
80347	80354	80355	80355	he	173	" Good morning , Mr. Talboys , "
80360	80400	80401	80401	He	173	" God grant that you are right . God grant that I am wrong . But I fear a day will come when you will have reason to regret your apathy respecting the untimely fate of your only son . "
80490	80497	80503	80503	he	173	" She is like her father , "
80514	80538	80503	80503	he	173	" Poor George , you had need of one friend in this world , for you have had very few to love you . "
80955	80959	80961	80962	Robert Audley	173	" Thank God ! "
80964	81025	80961	80962	Robert Audley	173	" thank God ! it is over . My poor friend must rest in his unknown grave ; and I shall not be the means of bringing disgrace upon those I love . It will come , perhaps , sooner or later , but it will not come through me . The crisis is past , and I am free . "
81197	81206	81207	81207	he	173	" Is it me the flying female wants ? "
81213	81221	81222	81222	he	173	" You 'd better stop , perhaps , "
81229	81292	81222	81222	he	173	" It is an age of eccentricity , an abnormal era of the world 's history . She may want me . Very likely I left my pocket - handkerchief behind me , and Mr. Talboys has sent this person with it . Perhaps I 'd better get out and go and meet her . It 's civil to send my handkerchief . "
81340	81344	81345	81345	he	173	" Good Heaven ! "
81348	81354	81345	81345	he	173	" it 's Miss Talboys . "
81509	81513	81514	81514	he	173	" Miss Talboys , "
81517	81524	81514	81514	he	173	" what can I — why — "
81548	81557	81558	81558	she	256	" Oh , let me speak to you , "
81559	81599	81539	81539	she	256	cried—"let me speak to you , or I shall go mad . I heard it all . I believe what you believe , and I shall go mad unless I can do something — something toward avenging his death . "
81629	81637	81638	81638	he	173	" Take my arm , Miss Talboys , "
81641	81675	81638	81638	he	173	" Pray calm yourself . Let us walk a little way back toward the house , and talk quietly . I would not have spoken as I did before you had I known — "
81676	81686	81687	81687	she	256	" Had you known that I loved my brother ? "
81692	81905	81906	81906	she	2480	" How should you know that I loved him ? How should any one think that I loved him , when I have never had power to give him a welcome beneath that roof , or a kindly word from his father ? How should I dare to betray my love for him in that house when I knew that even a sister 's affection would be turned to his disadvantage ? You do not know my father , Mr. Audley . I do . I knew that to intercede for George would have been to ruin his cause . I knew that to leave matters in my father 's hands , and to trust to time , was my only chance of ever seeing that dear brother again . And I waited — waited patiently , always hoping for the best ; for I knew that my father loved his only son . I see your contemptuous smile , Mr. Audley , and I dare say it is difficult for a stranger to believe that underneath his affected stoicism my father conceals some degree of affection for his children — no very warm attachment perhaps , for he has always ruled his life by the strict law of duty . Stop , "
81928	82004	81906	81906	she	2480	" I ran out of the house by the back way . Papa must not see me talking to you , Mr. Audley , and he must not see the fly standing at the gate . Will you go into the high - road and tell the man to drive on a little way ? I will come out of the plantation by a little gate further on , and meet you in the road . "
82005	82015	82017	82017	Robert	173	" But you will catch cold , Miss Talboys , "
82032	82038	82025	82025	he	173	" You are shivering now . "
82039	82044	82045	82045	she	2480	" Not with cold , "
82048	82098	82045	82045	she	2480	" I am thinking of my brother George . If you have any pity for the only sister of your lost friend , do what I ask you , Mr. Audley . I must speak to you — I must speak to you — calmly , if I can . "
82202	82212	82213	82213	she	256	" Will you walk with me inside the plantation ? "
82216	82227	82213	82213	she	256	" We might be observed on the high - road . "
82260	82270	82271	82271	he	173	" Pray , pray calm yourself , Miss Talboys , "
82274	82291	82271	82271	he	173	" I may have been deceived in the opinion which I have formed ; I may — "
82292	82299	82300	82300	she	256	" No , no , no , "
82303	82339	82300	82300	she	256	" you are not deceived . My brother has been murdered . Tell me the name of that woman — the woman whom you suspect of being concerned in his disappearance — in his murder . "
82340	82348	82271	82271	he	173	" That I can not do until — "
82349	82353	82271	82271	he	173	" Until when ? "
82354	82363	82271	82271	he	173	" Until I know that she is guilty . "
82364	82445	82271	82271	he	173	" You told my father that you would abandon all idea of discovering the truth — that you would rest satisfied to leave my brother 's fate a horrible mystery never to be solved upon this earth ; but you will not do so , Mr. Audley — you will not be false to the memory of your friend . You will see vengeance done upon those who have destroyed him . You will do this , will you not ? "
82474	82493	82465	82465	he	173	" A hand that is stronger than my own is beckoning me onward , upon the dark road . "
82550	82569	82570	82570	he	173	" If you knew what misery to me may be involved in discovering the truth , Miss Talboys , "
82573	82586	82570	82570	he	173	" you would scarcely ask me to pursue this business any farther ? "
82587	82594	82595	82595	she	2487	" But I do ask you , "
82600	82625	82570	82570	he	173	passion—"I do ask you . I ask you to avenge my brother 's untimely death . Will you do so ? Yes or no ? "
82626	82633	82570	82570	he	173	" What if I answer no ? "
82634	82642	82643	82643	she	2487	" Then I will do it myself , "
82655	82787	82643	82643	she	2487	" I myself will follow up the clew to this mystery ; I will find this woman — though you refuse to tell me in what part of England my brother disappeared . I will travel from one end of the world to the other to find the secret of his fate , if you refuse to find it for me . I am of age ; my own mistress ; rich , for I have money left me by one of my aunts ; I shall be able to employ those who will help me in my search , and I will make it to their interest to serve me well . Choose between the two alternatives , Mr. Audley . Shall you or I find my brother 's murderer ? "
82861	82872	82873	82873	she	2490	" I have grown up in an atmosphere of suppression , "
82878	82995	82996	82996	she	2493	" I have stifled and dwarfed the natural feelings of my heart , until they have become unnatural in their intensity ; I have been allowed neither friends nor lovers . My mother died when I was very young . My father has always been to me what you saw him to - day . I have had no one but my brother . All the love that my heart can hold has been centered upon him . Do you wonder , then , that when I hear that his young life has been ended by the hand of treachery , that I wish to see vengeance done upon the traitor ? Oh , my God , "
83013	83035	82996	82996	she	2493	" lead me to the murderer of my brother , and let mine be the hand to avenge his untimely death . "
83138	83142	83144	83144	Robert	173	" Miss Talboys , "
83150	83201	83144	83144	Robert	173	" your brother shall not be unavenged . He shall not be forgotten . I do not think that any professional aid which you could procure would lead you as surely to the secret of this mystery as I can lead you , if you are patient and trust me . "
83202	83208	83209	83209	she	2493	" I will trust you , "
83212	83222	83209	83209	she	2493	" for I see that you will help me . "
83223	83235	83236	83236	he	173	" I believe that it is my destiny to do so , "
83323	83336	83337	83337	he	173	" Have you any letters of your brother 's , Miss Talboys ? "
83340	83364	83337	83337	he	173	" Two . One written soon after his marriage , the other written at Liverpool , the night before he sailed for Australia . "
83365	83373	83300	83300	he	173	" Will you let me see them ? "
83374	83450	83497	83497	she	256	" Yes , I will send them to you if you will give me your address . You will write to me from time to time , will you not , to tell me whether you are approaching the truth . I shall be obliged to act secretly here , but I am going to leave home in two or three months , and I shall be perfectly free then to act as I please . "
83451	83460	83461	83461	Robert	173	" You are not going to leave England ? "
83464	83485	83461	83461	Robert	173	" Oh no ! I am only going to pay a long - promised visit to some friends in Essex . "
83516	83524	83525	83525	she	256	" My brother George disappeared in Essex , "
83534	83544	83545	83545	he	173	" I am sorry you have discovered so much , "
83548	83566	83545	83545	he	173	" My position becomes every day more complicated , every day more painful . Good - bye . "
83607	83618	83619	83619	he	173	" Pray lose no time in returning to the house , "
83623	83635	83619	83619	he	173	" I fear you will suffer from this morning 's work . "
83636	83639	83640	83640	she	256	" Suffer ! "
83645	83692	83693	83693	she	256	" You talk to me of suffering , when the only creature in this world who ever loved me has been taken from it in the bloom of youth . What can there be for me henceforth but suffering ? What is the cold to me ? "
83710	83755	83693	83693	she	256	" I would walk from here to London barefoot through the snow , and never stop by the way , if I could bring him back to life . What would I not do to bring him back ? What would I not do ? "
83863	83870	83871	83871	he	173	" Pray , pray be calm , "
83874	83892	83871	83871	he	173	" hope even against hope . We may both be deceived ; your brother may still live . "
83893	83901	83902	83902	she	256	" Oh ! if it were so , "
83907	83914	83902	83902	she	256	" if it could be so . "
83915	83927	83871	83871	he	173	" Let us try and hope that it may be so . "
83928	83931	83932	83932	she	256	" No , "
83942	83963	83932	83932	she	256	" let us hope for nothing but revenge . Good - by , Mr. Audley . Stop ; your address . "
83980	83989	83990	83990	she	256	" I will send you George 's letters , "
83993	84003	83990	83990	she	256	" they may help you . Good - by . "
84050	84062	84063	84063	he	173	" Heaven help those who stand between me and the secret , "
84066	84079	84063	84063	he	173	" for they will be sacrificed to the memory of George Talboys . "
84208	84216	84218	84219	the barrister	955	" What a pleasant thing life is , "
84221	84488	84490	84490	Robert	173	" What an unspeakable boon — what an overpowering blessing ! Let any man make a calculation of his existence , subtracting the hours in which he has been thoroughly happy — really and entirely at his ease , without one arriere pensée to mar his enjoyment — without the most infinitesimal cloud to overshadow the brightness of his horizon . Let him do this , and surely he will laugh in utter bitterness of soul when he sets down the sum of his felicity , and discovers the pitiful smallness of the amount . He will have enjoyed himself for a week or ten days in thirty years , perhaps . In thirty years of dull December , and blustering March , and showery April , and dark November weather , there may have been seven or eight glorious August days , through which the sun has blazed in cloudless radiance , and the summer breezes have breathed perpetual balm . How fondly we recollect these solitary days of pleasure , and hope for their recurrence , and try to plan the circumstances that made them bright ; and arrange , and predestinate , and diplomatize with fate for a renewal of the remembered joy . As if any joy could ever be built up out of such and such constituent parts ! As if happiness were not essentially accidental — a bright and wandering bird , utterly irregular in its migrations ; with us one summer 's day , and forever gone from us on the next ! Look at marriages , for instance , "
84528	84861	84218	84219	the barrister	955	" Look at marriage ! Who is to say which shall be the one judicious selection out of nine hundred and ninety - nine mistakes ! Who shall decide from the first aspect of the slimy creature , which is to be the one eel out of the colossal bag of snakes ? That girl on the curbstone yonder , waiting to cross the street when my chariot shall have passed , may be the one woman out of every female creature in this vast universe who could make me a happy man . Yet I pass her by — bespatter her with the mud from my wheels , in my helpless ignorance , in my blind submission to the awful hand of fatality . If that girl , Clara Talboys , had been five minutes later , I should have left Dorsetshire thinking her cold , hard , and unwomanly , and should have gone to my grave with that mistake part and parcel of my mind . I took her for a stately and heartless automaton ; I know her now to be a noble and beautiful woman . What an incalculable difference this may make in my life . When I left that house , I went out into the winter day with the determination of abandoning all further thought of the secret of George 's death . I see her , and she forces me onward upon the loathsome path — the crooked by - way of watchfulness and suspicion . How can I say to this sister of my dead friend , ' I believe that your brother has been murdered ! I believe that I know by whom , but I will take no step to set my doubts at rest , or to confirm my fears ' ? I can not say this . This woman knows half my secret ; she will soon possess herself of the rest , and then — and then — "
85322	85325	85371	85373	the friendly waiter	2538	" broiled sole "
85327	85331	85371	85373	the friendly waiter	2538	" boiled mack'-rill . "
85497	85517	85518	85518	he	2541	" I accept the dominion of that pale girl , with the statuesque features and the calm brown eyes , "
85521	85643	85518	85518	he	2541	" I recognize the power of a mind superior to my own , and I yield to it , and bow down to it . I 've been acting for myself , and thinking for myself , for the last few months , and I 'm tired of the unnatural business . I 've been false to the leading principle of my life , and I 've suffered for the folly . I found two gray hairs in my head the week before last , and an impertinent crow has planted a delicate impression of his foot under my right eye . Yes , I 'm getting old upon the right side ; and why — why should it be so ? "
85669	85680	85681	85681	he	2541	" What the devil am I doing in this galere ? "
85684	86261	85681	85681	he	2541	" But I am in it , and I ca n't get out of it ; so I better submit myself to the brown - eyed girl , and do what she tells me patiently and faithfully . What a wonderful solution to life 's enigma there is in petticoat government ! Man might lie in the sunshine , and eat lotuses , and fancy it ' always afternoon , ' if his wife would let him ! But she wo n't , bless her impulsive heart and active mind ! She knows better than that . Who ever heard of a woman taking life as it ought to be taken ? Instead of supporting it as an unavoidable nuisance , only redeemable by its brevity , she goes through it as if it were a pageant or a procession . She dresses for it , and simpers and grins , and gesticulates for it . She pushes her neighbors , and struggles for a good place in the dismal march ; she elbows , and writhes , and tramples , and prances to the one end of making the most of the misery . She gets up early and sits up late , and is loud , and restless , and noisy , and unpitying . She drags her husband on to the woolsack , or pushes him into Parliament . She drives him full butt at the dear , lazy machinery of government , and knocks and buffets him about the wheels , and cranks , and screws , and pulleys ; until somebody , for quiet 's sake , makes him something that she wanted him to be made . That 's why incompetent men sometimes sit in high places , and interpose their poor , muddled intellects between the things to be done and the people that can do them , making universal confusion in the helpless innocence of well - placed incapacity . The square men in the round holes are pushed into them by their wives . The Eastern potentate who declared that women were at the bottom of all mischief , should have gone a little further and seen why it is so . It is because women are never lazy . They do n't know what it is to be quiet . They are Semiramides , and Cleopatras , and Joans of Arc , Queen Elizabeths , and Catharines the Second , and they riot in battle , and murder , and clamor and desperation . If they ca n't agitate the universe and play at ball with hemispheres , they 'll make mountains of warfare and vexation out of domestic molehills , and social storms in household teacups . Forbid them to hold forth upon the freedom of nations and the wrongs of mankind , and they 'll quarrel with Mrs. Jones about the shape of a mantle or the character of a small maid - servant . To call them the weaker sex is to utter a hideous mockery . They are the stronger sex , the noisier , the more persevering , the most self - assertive sex . They want freedom of opinion , variety of occupation , do they ? Let them have it . Let them be lawyers , doctors , preachers , teachers , soldiers , legislators — anything they like — but let them be quiet — if they can . "
86286	86291	86292	86292	he	173	" I hate women , "
86297	86439	86441	86442	Mr. Audley	173	" They 're bold , brazen , abominable creatures , invented for the annoyance and destruction of their superiors . Look at this business of poor George 's ! It 's all woman 's work from one end to the other . He marries a woman , and his father casts him off penniless and professionless . He hears of the woman 's death and he breaks his heart — his good honest , manly heart , worth a million of the treacherous lumps of self - interest and mercenary calculation which beats in women 's breasts . He goes to a woman 's house and he is never seen alive again . And now I find myself driven into a corner by another woman , of whose existence I had never thought until this day . And — and then , "
86447	86512	86441	86442	Mr. Audley	173	" there 's Alicia , too ; she 's another nuisance . She 'd like me to marry her I know ; and she 'll make me do it , I dare say , before she 's done with me . But I 'd much rather not ; though she is a dear , bouncing , generous thing , bless her poor little heart . "
86701	86767	86768	86768	He	173	" It 's comfortable , but it seems so deuced lonely to - night . If poor George were sitting opposite to me , or — or even George 's sister — she 's very like him — existence might be a little more endurable . But when a fellow 's lived by himself for eight or ten years he begins to be bad company . "
86780	86791	86792	86792	he	173	" The idea of my thinking of George 's sister , "
86795	86803	86792	86792	he	173	" what a preposterous idiot I am ! "
86921	86926	86927	86927	he	173	" From Clara Talboys , "
86947	86985	86986	86986	He	173	" Yes , from Clara Talboys , most decidedly ; I recognized a feminine resemblance to poor George 's hand ; neater than his , and more decided than his , but very like , very like . "
87004	87013	87014	87014	he	173	" I wonder what she says to me ? "
87017	87075	87014	87014	he	173	" It 's a long letter , I dare say ; she 's the kind of woman who would write a long letter — a letter that will urge me on , drive me forward , wrench me out of myself , I 've no doubt . But that ca n't be helped — so here goes ! "
87105	87118	87076	87076	He	173	" I send the letters ; please preserve and return them — C.T. "
87233	87252	87254	87256	the young barrister	5094	" If George could have known for what a purpose this description would serve when he wrote it , "
87258	87280	87254	87256	the young barrister	5094	" surely his hand would have fallen paralyzed by horror , and powerless to shape one syllable of these tender words . "
87485	87498	87466	87466	They	2570	" lovely woman , with all her faults , God bless her , "
87606	87617	87618	87618	he	173	" If she would only take warning and run away , "
87624	87646	87618	87618	he	173	" Heaven knows , I have given her a fair chance . Why does n't she take it and run away ? "
87862	87868	87869	87869	Alicia	190	" Papa is very ill , "
87872	87947	87869	87869	Alicia	190	" not dangerously ill , thank God ; but confined to his room by an attack of low fever which has succeeded a violent cold . Come and see him , Robert , if you have any regard for your nearest relations . He has spoken about you several times ; and I know he will be glad to have you with him . Come at once , but say nothing about this letter . "
87955	87989	87953	87953	ALICIA	190	" A sick and deadly terror chilled Robert Audley 's heart , as he read this letter — a vague yet hideous fear , which he dared not shape into any definite form . "
87995	88006	88007	88007	I	0	" he thought , in the first agony of this new horror—"have
88064	88497	88061	88061	I	0	" One course lay clear before him ; and the first step of that course was a rapid journey to Audley Court . He packed his portmanteau , jumped into a cab , and reached the railway station within an hour of his receipt of Alicia 's letter , which had come by the afternoon post . The dim village lights flickered faintly through the growing dusk when Robert reached Audley . He left his portmanteau with the station - master , and walked at a leisurely pace through the quiet lanes that led away to the still loneliness of the Court . The over - arching trees stretched their leafless branches above his head , bare and weird in the dusky light . A low moaning wind swept across the flat meadow land , and tossed those rugged branches hither and thither against the dark gray sky . They looked like the ghostly arms of shrunken and withered giants , beckoning Robert to his uncle 's house . They looked like threatening phantoms in the chill winter twilight , gesticulating to him to hasten upon his journey . The long avenue so bright and pleasant when the perfumed limes scattered their light bloom upon the pathway , and the dog - rose leaves floated on the summer air , was terribly bleak and desolate in the cheerless interregnum that divides the homely joys of Christmas from the pale blush of coming spring — a dead pause in the year , in which Nature seems to lie in a tranced sleep , awaiting the wondrous signal for the budding of the flower . A mournful presentiment crept into Robert Audley 's heart as he drew nearer to his uncle 's house . Every changing outline in the landscape was familiar to him ; every bend of the trees ; every caprice of the untrammeled branches ; every undulation in the bare hawthorn hedge , broken by dwarf horse - chestnuts , stunted willows , blackberry and hazel bushes . Sir Michael had been a second father to the young man , a generous and noble friend , a grave and earnest adviser ; and perhaps the strongest sentiment of Robert 's heart was his love for the gray - bearded baronet . But the grateful affection was so much a part of himself , that it seldom found an outlet in words , and a stranger would never have fathomed the depth of feeling which lay , a deep and powerful current , beneath the stagnant surface of the barrister 's character . "
88511	88537	88061	88061	I	0	" he thought , and he drew nearer to the ivied archway , and the still water - pools , coldly gray in the twilight . "
88560	89030	88061	88061	I	0	" That wonderful faculty of association , so interwoven with the inmost fibers of even the hardest nature , filled the young man 's breast with a prophetic pain as he remembered that , however long or late , the day must come on which the oaken shutters would be closed for awhile , and the sunshine shut out of the house he loved . It was painful to him even to remember this ; as it must always be painful to think of the narrow lease the greatest upon this earth can ever hold of its grandeurs . Is it so wonderful that some wayfarers drop asleep under the hedges , scarcely caring to toil onward on a journey that leads to no abiding habitation ? Is it wonderful that there have been quietists in the world ever since Christ 's religion was first preached upon earth . Is it strange that there is a patient endurance and tranquil resignation , calm expectation of that which is to come on the further shore of the dark flowing river ? Is it not rather to be wondered that anybody should ever care to be great for greatness ' sake ; for any other reason than pure conscientiousness ; the simple fidelity of the servant who fears to lay his talents by in a napkin , knowing that indifference is near akin to dishonesty ? If Robert Audley had lived in the time of Thomas à Kempis , he would very likely have built himself a narrow hermitage amid some forest loneliness , and spent his life in tranquil imitation of the reputed author of The Imitation . As it was , Figtree Court was a pleasant hermitage in its way , and for breviaries and Books of Hours , I am ashamed to say the young barrister substituted Paul de Kock and Dumas , fils . But his sins were of so simply negative an order , that it would have been very easy for him to have abandoned them for negative virtues . Only one solitary light was visible in the long irregular range of windows facing the archway , as Robert passed under the gloomy shade of the rustling ivy , restless in the chill moaning of the wind . He recognized that lighted window as the large oriel in his uncle 's room . When last he had looked at the old house it had been gay with visitors , every window glittering like a low star in the dusk ; now , dark and silent , it faced the winter 's night like some dismal baronial habitation , deep in a woodland solitude . The man who opened the door to the unlooked - for visitor , brightened as he recognized his master 's nephew . "
89048	89085	89040	89040	sir	900	" he said , as he ushered Robert Audley into the fire - lit library , which seemed desolate by reason of the baronet 's easy - chair standing empty on the broad hearth - rug . "
89103	89108	89087	89087	I	0	" the servant asked . "
89137	89138	89124	89124	I	0	" "
89150	89156	89124	89124	I	0	" Robert answered , hurriedly ; "
89182	89188	89179	89179	I	0	" he added , anxiously . "
89213	89700	89701	89702	Mr. Audley	173	" He conducted Robert up the short flight of shallow oaken stairs to the octagon chamber in which George Talboys had sat long five months before , staring absently at my lady 's portrait . The picture was finished now , and hung in the post of honor opposite the window , amidst Claudes , Poussins and Wouvermans , whose less brilliant hues were killed by the vivid coloring of the modern artist . The bright face looked out of that tangled glitter of golden hair , in which the Pre - Raphaelites delight , with a mocking smile , as Robert paused for a moment to glance at the well - remembered picture . Two or three moments afterward he had passed through my lady 's boudoir and dressing - room and stood upon the threshold of Sir Michael 's room . The baronet lay in a quiet sleep , his arm laying outside the bed , and his strong hand clasped in his young wife 's delicate fingers . Alicia sat in a low chair beside the broad open hearth , on which the huge logs burned fiercely in the frosty atmosphere . The interior of this luxurious bedchamber might have made a striking picture for an artist 's pencil . The massive furniture , dark and somber , yet broken up and relieved here and there by scraps of gilding , and masses of glowing color ; the elegance of every detail , in which wealth was subservient to purity of taste ; and last , but greatest in importance , the graceful figures of the two women , and the noble form of the old man would have formed a worthy study for any painter . Lucy Audley , with her disordered hair in a pale haze of yellow gold about her thoughtful face , the flowing lines of her soft muslin dressing - gown falling in straight folds to her feet , and clasped at the waist by a narrow circlet of agate links might have served as a model for a mediaeval saint , in one of the tiny chapels hidden away in the nooks and corners of a gray old cathedral , unchanged by Reformation or Cromwell ; and what saintly martyr of the Middle Ages could have borne a holier aspect than the man whose gray beard lay upon the dark silken coverlet of the stately bed ? Robert paused upon the threshold , fearful of awaking his uncle . The two ladies had heard his step , cautious though he had been , and lifted their heads to look at him . My lady 's face , quietly watching the sick man , had worn an anxious earnestness which made it only more beautiful ; but the same face recognizing Robert Audley , faded from its delicate brightness , and looked scared and wan in the lamplight . "
89704	89715	89701	89702	Mr. Audley	173	" she cried , in a faint , tremulous voice . "
89718	89727	89728	89728	you	173	" whispered Alicia , with a warning gesture ; "
89742	89827	89740	89740	Robert	173	" she added , in the same whispered tones , beckoning to her cousin to take an empty chair near the bed . The young man seated himself in the indicated seat at the bottom of the bed , and opposite to my lady , who sat close beside the pillows . He looked long and earnestly at the face of the sleeper ; still longer , still more earnestly at the face of Lady Audley , which was slowly recovering its natural hues . "
89838	89860	89836	89836	he	173	" Robert asked , in the same key as that in which Alicia had spoken . My lady answered the question . "
89869	89883	89836	89836	he	173	" she said , without taking her eyes from her husband 's face ; "
89896	89907	89908	89908	She	2603	" Robert never relaxed his scrutiny of that pale face . "
89914	89918	89908	89908	She	2603	" he thought ; "
89950	90000	89939	89939	She	2603	" He paused for a few minutes before he spoke again . The regular breathing of the sleeper the ticking of a gold hunting - watch at the head of the bed , and the crackling of the burning logs , were the only sounds that broke the stillness . "
90013	90034	90005	90005	you	2603	" Robert said , after a pause , fixing my lady 's eyes as they wandered furtively to his face . "
90068	90111	90112	90112	I	0	" The whisper in which he uttered these words was too low to reach the other side of the room , where Alicia sat . Lucy Audley 's eyes met those of the speaker with some gleam of triumph in their light . "
90116	90120	90112	90112	I	0	" she said . "
90130	90282	90112	90112	I	0	" She pointed to the sleeper as she spoke , still looking at Robert Audley . She defied him with her blue eyes , their brightness intensified by the triumph in their glance . She defied him with her quiet smile — a smile of fatal beauty , full of lurking significance and mysterious meaning — the smile which the artist had exaggerated in his portrait of Sir Michael 's wife . Robert turned away from the lovely face , and shaded his eyes with his hand ; putting a barrier between my lady and himself ; a screen which baffled her penetration and provoked her curiosity . Was he still watching her or was he thinking ? and of what was he thinking ? Robert had been seated at the bedside for upward of an hour before his uncle awoke . The baronet was delighted at his nephew 's coming . "
90296	90300	90294	90294	Bob	174	" he said . "
90359	90375	90354	90354	you	2605	" Robert grasped his uncle 's hand , but he looked down as he answered : "
90383	90389	90379	90379	you	2605	" he said , quietly ; "
90417	90430	90408	90408	She	468	" Lucy Audley made a little grimace with her pretty little lips . "
90437	90441	90442	90442	you	0	" she exclaimed ; "
90477	90564	90565	90565	I	0	" She hesitated for a moment , and escaped any conclusion to her sentence by the timely intervention of Mr. Dawson , her late employer , who entered the room upon his evening visit while she was speaking . He felt the patient 's pulse ; asked two or three questions ; pronounced the baronet to be steadily improving ; exchanged a few commonplace remarks with Alicia and Lady Audley , and prepared to leave the room . Robert rose and accompanied him to the door . "
90573	90593	90565	90565	I	0	" he said , taking a candle from one of the tables , and lighting it at the lamp . "
90607	90612	90605	90605	yourself	2613	" expostulated the surgeon ; "
90621	90652	90605	90605	yourself	2613	" Robert insisted , and the two men left the room together . As they entered the octagon ante - chamber the barrister paused and shut the door behind him . "
90665	90678	90654	90654	you	2613	" he said , pointing to that which opened upon the staircase . "
90692	90693	90679	90679	I	0	" "
90698	90709	90679	90679	I	0	" replied the surgeon , complying with Robert 's request ; "
90758	90759	90748	90748	I	0	" "
90773	90779	90764	90764	you	2613	" answered Robert , gravely . "
90804	90805	90791	90791	I	0	" "
90808	90809	90791	90791	I	0	" "
90831	90846	90828	90829	Lady Audley	150	" Mr. Dawson looked up with an expression of surprise upon his quiet face . "
90853	90857	90848	90848	me	0	" he answered ; "
90900	90915	90916	90916	You	173	" He looked severely at the young man , as much as to say : "
90959	90960	90961	90961	I	0	" "
90972	90976	90967	90968	Miss Graham	152	" he said , "
91009	91010	91011	91011	You	900	" "
91028	91032	91011	91011	You	900	" answered Robert . "
91053	91054	91048	91048	you	900	" "
91057	91064	91067	91067	you	900	" echoed Mr. Dawson , indignantly . "

91153	91158	91146	91146	you	0	" asked the surgeon . "
91164	91169	91146	91146	you	0	" answered Robert Audley . "

91441	91447	91438	91439	Mr. Dawson	151	" answered Robert , decisively ; "
91554	91563	91564	91564	I	0	" Mr. Dawson was silent for some minutes . "
91580	91584	91577	91578	Mr. Audley	173	" he said . "
91679	91680	91681	91681	I	0	" "

91791	91792	91777	91778	Miss Graham	152	" "
91800	91801	91794	91794	you	151	" "

91987	91996	91999	91999	she	192	" asked Robert , taking out his pocketbook . "
92012	92013	92041	92042	Crescent Villas	88	" "
92020	92040	92041	92042	Crescent Villas	88	" muttered Mr. Audley , a recollection of last September flashing suddenly back upon him as the surgeon spoke . "
92100	92101	92071	92071	She	192	" "
92113	92114	92107	92108	Lady Audley	150	" "
92188	92712	92713	92713	You	2680	" Robert shook hands with the surgeon and returned to his uncle 's room . He had been away about a quarter of an hour . Sir Michael had fallen asleep once more , and my lady 's loving hands had lowered the heavy curtains and shaded the lamp by the bedside . Alicia and her father 's wife were taking tea in Lady Audley 's boudoir , the room next to the antechamber in which Robert and Mr. Dawson had been seated . Lucy Audley looked up from her occupation among the fragile china cups and watched Robert rather anxiously as he walked softly to his uncle 's room and back again to the boudoir . She looked very pretty and innocent , seated behind the graceful group of delicate opal china and glittering silver . Surely a pretty woman never looks prettier than when making tea . The most feminine and most domestic of all occupations imparts a magic harmony to her every movement , a witchery to her every glance . The floating mists from the boiling liquid in which she infuses the soothing herbs ; whose secrets are known to her alone , envelope her in a cloud of scented vapor , through which she seems a social fairy , weaving potent spells with Gunpowder and Bohea . At the tea - table she reigns omnipotent , unapproachable . What do men know of the mysterious beverage ? Read how poor Hazlitt made his tea , and shudder at the dreadful barbarism . How clumsily the wretched creatures attempt to assist the witch president of the tea - tray ; how hopelessly they hold the kettle , how continually they imperil the frail cups and saucers , or the taper hands of the priestess . To do away with the tea - table is to rob woman of her legitimate empire . To send a couple of hulking men about among your visitors , distributing a mixture made in the housekeeper 's room , is to reduce the most social and friendly of ceremonies to a formal giving out of rations . Better the pretty influence of the tea cups and saucers gracefully wielded in a woman 's hand than all the inappropriate power snatched at the point of the pen from the unwilling sterner sex . Imagine all the women of England elevated to the high level of masculine intellectuality , superior to crinoline ; above pearl powder and Mrs. Rachael Levison ; above taking the pains to be pretty ; above tea - tables and that cruelly scandalous and rather satirical gossip which even strong men delight in ; and what a drear , utilitarian , ugly life the sterner sex must lead . My lady was by no means strong - minded . The starry diamonds upon her white fingers flashed hither and thither among the tea - things , and she bent her pretty head over the marvelous Indian tea - caddy of sandal - wood and silver , with as much earnestness as if life held no higher purpose than the infusion of Bohea . "
92726	92750	92723	92724	Mr. Audley	173	" she asked , pausing with the teapot in her hand to look up at Robert , who was standing near the door . "
92755	92756	92723	92724	Mr. Audley	173	" "
92787	92788	92766	92766	I	0	" "
92818	92893	92806	92806	I	0	" He seated himself at the little table and looked across it at his Cousin Alicia , who sat with a book in her lap , and had the air of being very much absorbed by its pages . The bright brunette complexion had lost its glowing crimson , and the animation of the young lady 's manner was suppressed — on account of her father 's illness , no doubt , Robert thought . "
92899	92913	92894	92894	Alicia	149	" the barrister said , after a very leisurely contemplation of his cousin , "
92920	92939	92894	92894	Alicia	149	" Miss Audley shrugged her shoulders , but did not condescend to lift her eyes from her book . "
92943	92949	92894	92894	Alicia	149	" she answered , contemptuously . "
92981	92982	92986	92986	she	149	" "
92989	93008	93009	93010	Robert Audley	173	" thought the barrister . He always knew his cousin was angry with him when she addressed him as "
93012	93013	93009	93010	Robert Audley	173	" "
93031	93037	93029	93029	Alicia	149	" he said , reproachfully . "
93053	93063	93050	93050	I	0	" Miss Audley looked up with a bright smile . "
93069	93080	93064	93066	Sir Harry Towers	214	" Miss Audley returned to her book with a frown . "
93089	93107	93083	93083	you	0	" Robert asked , after a pause , during which he had sat thoughtfully stirring his tea . "
93112	93113	93083	93083	you	0	" "
93117	93118	93083	93083	you	0	" "
93121	93122	93083	93083	you	0	" "
93128	93129	93130	93135	The author of Follies and Faults	2691	" "
93137	93152	93130	93135	The author of Follies and Faults	2691	" answered Alicia , still pursuing her study of the romance upon her lap . "
93157	93169	93130	93135	The author of Follies and Faults	2691	" Miss Audley pursed up her mouth and shrugged her shoulders . "
93173	93177	93130	93135	The author of Follies and Faults	2691	" she said . "
93199	93208	93211	93211	he	2692	" observed Mr. Audley , with some gravity , "
93231	93232	93211	93211	he	2692	" "
93238	93277	93211	93211	he	2692	" exclaimed my lady , looking up suddenly . Though the look of joy upon Lady Audley 's face was as brief as a flash of lightning on a summer sky , it was not unperceived by Robert . "
93280	93284	93211	93211	he	2692	" he said ; "
93325	93326	93314	93315	Lady Audley	150	" "
93339	93346	93328	93328	you	0	" asked my lady , anxiously . "
93355	93356	93347	93347	You	0	" "
93359	93363	93347	93347	You	0	" answered Robert . "
93378	93411	93367	93367	I	0	" My lady sat silent for a few moments , looking at the empty teacups with a prettily thoughtful face — a face grave with the innocent seriousness of a musing child . "
93427	93436	93437	93437	I	0	" she said , after this brief pause . "
93458	93459	93449	93449	you	0	" "
93467	93478	93449	93449	you	0	" My lady looked down at the teacups once more . "
93498	93506	93492	93492	he	991	" she asked , after another pause . "
93515	93516	93492	93492	he	991	" "
93529	93530	93518	93519	Mr. Dawson	151	" "
93535	93542	93518	93519	Mr. Dawson	151	" cried Lady Audley , eagerly . "
93559	93617	93556	93557	my lady	468	" answered Robert , gravely . My lady bit her lip , and relapsed into silence . Alicia threw down her book , and watched her cousin 's preoccupied face . He talked to her now and then for a few minutes , but it was evidently an effort to him to arouse himself from his revery . "
93632	93657	93627	93630	a very agreeable companion	2696	" exclaimed Alicia at length , her rather limited stock of patience quite exhausted by two or three of these abortive attempts at conversation . "
93745	93800	93731	93732	Mr. Audley	173	" He was thinking of Clara Talboys ' uplifted face , sublime in its unutterable grief ; of her impassioned words still ringing in his ears as clearly as when they were first spoken . Again he saw her looking at him with her bright brown eyes . Again he heard that solemn question : "
93811	94016	94017	94018	Mrs. Vincent	192	" And he was in Essex ; in the little village from which he firmly believed George Talboys had never departed . He was on the spot at which all record of his friend 's life ended as suddenly as a story ends when the reader shuts the book . And could he withdraw now from the investigation in which he found himself involved ? Could he stop now ? For any consideration ? No ; a thousand times no ! Not with the image of that grief - stricken face imprinted on his mind . Not with the accents of that earnest appeal ringing on his ear . Robert left Audley the next morning by an early train , and reached Shoreditch a little after nine o'clock . He did not return to his chambers , but called a cab and drove straight to Crescent Villas , West Brompton . He knew that he should fail in finding the lady he went to seek at this address , as his uncle had failed a few months before , but he thought it possible to obtain some clew to the schoolmistress ' new residence , in spite of Sir Michael 's ill - success . "
94031	94035	94017	94018	Mrs. Vincent	192	" Robert thought . "
94055	94265	94017	94018	Mrs. Vincent	192	" He found Crescent Villas after some difficulty . The houses were large , but they lay half imbedded among the chaos of brick and rising mortar around them . New terraces , new streets , new squares led away into hopeless masses of stone and plaster on every side . The roads were sticky with damp clay , which clogged the wheels of the cab and buried the fetlocks of the horse . The desolations — that awful aspect of incompleteness and discomfort which pervades a new and unfinished neighborhood — had set its dismal seal upon the surrounding streets which had arisen about and intrenched Crescent Villas ; and Robert wasted forty minutes by his watch , and an hour and a quarter by the cabman 's reckoning , in driving up and down uninhabited streets and terraces , trying to find the Villas ; whose chimney - tops were frowning down upon him black and venerable , amid groves of virgin plaster , undimmed by time or smoke . But having at last succeeded in reaching his destination , Mr. Audley alighted from the cab , directed the driver to wait for him at a certain corner , and set out upon his voyage of discovery . "
94282	94286	94017	94018	Mrs. Vincent	192	" he thought ; "
94337	94404	94445	94445	she	2703	" He inquired for Mrs. Vincent at the number which Mr. Dawson had given him . The maid who opened the door had never heard that lady 's name ; but after going to inquire of her mistress , she returned to tell Robert that Mrs. Vincent had lived there , but that she had left two months before the present occupants had entered the house , "
94413	94419	94406	94406	missus	2703	" the girl added emphatically . "
94432	94438	94421	94421	you	2705	" Robert asked , despondingly . "
94471	94638	94639	94639	She	2711	" Mr. Audley felt himself at a standstill once more . If Mrs. Vincent had left the place in debt , she had no doubt scrupulously concealed her whereabouts . There was little hope , then , of learning her address from the tradespeople ; and yet , on the other hand , it was just possible that some of her sharpest creditors might have made it their business to discover the defaulter 's retreat . He looked about him for the nearest shops , and found a baker 's , a stationer 's , and a fruiterer 's a few paces from the Crescent . Three empty - looking , pretentious shops , with plate - glass windows , and a hopeless air of gentility . He stopped at the baker 's , who called himself a pastrycook and confectioner , and exhibited some specimens of petrified sponge - cake in glass bottles , and some highly - glazed tarts , covered with green gauze . "
94645	94658	94660	94660	she	2711	" Robert thought , as he deliberated before the baker 's shop ; "
94678	94739	94675	94676	the baker	2115	" The baker was standing behind his counter , disputing the items of a bill with a shabby - genteel young woman . He did not trouble himself to attend to Robert Audley until he had settled the dispute , but he looked up as he was receipting the bill , and asked the barrister what he pleased to want . "
94766	94773	94747	94749	a Mrs. Vincent	192	" Mr. Audley inquired , mildly . "
94780	94800	94776	94776	I	0	" answered the baker , growing very red in the face , and speaking in an unnecessarily loud voice ; "
94854	94934	94835	94835	anybody	706	" Robert Audley shrugged his shoulders and wished the man good - morning . He felt that his discovery of the lady 's whereabouts would involve more trouble than he had expected . He might have looked for Mrs. Vincent 's name in the Post - Office directory , but he thought it scarcely likely that a lady who was on such uncomfortable terms with her creditors , would afford them so easy a means of ascertaining her residence . "
94949	94955	94936	94937	the baker	2115	" he thought , despairingly . "
95010	95096	95115	95115	ma'am	6062	" Mr. Audley abandoned himself to these gloomy reflections as he walked slowly back toward the corner at which he had left the cab . About half - way between the baker 's shop and this corner he was arrested by hearing a woman 's step close at his side , and a woman 's voice asking him to stop . He turned and found himself face to face with the shabbily - dressed woman whom he had left settling her account with the baker . "
95101	95107	95115	95115	ma'am	6062	" he asked , vaguely . "
95126	95127	95130	95130	sir	900	" "
95132	95153	95130	95130	sir	900	" the woman answered , with a semi - genteel manner which corresponded with the shabby gentility of her dress . "
95190	95191	95192	95192	You	900	" "
95216	95229	95207	95207	you	900	" The woman hesitated a little , looking rather suspiciously at Robert . "
95246	95262	95242	95242	you	900	" she asked , after considering Mr. Audley 's personal appearance for a few moments . "
95268	95280	95242	95242	you	900	" asked the young barrister , staring aghast at his questioner . "
95291	95306	95286	95286	your	900	" exclaimed the little woman , seeing that she had made some awful mistake . "
95345	95357	95358	95358	My	0	" Robert Audley laid his hand upon the speaker 's arm . "
95362	95366	95358	95358	My	0	" he said , "
95504	95532	95495	95495	you	2731	" He took out his card - case and handed a card to the woman , who examined the slip of pasteboard anxiously before she spoke again . "
95546	95555	95536	95536	you	2731	" she said , after a brief pause , "
95670	95671	95661	95661	You	900	" "
95678	95679	95661	95661	You	900	" "
95685	95721	95683	95683	sir	900	" said the dressmaker , dropping her voice as if she thought the pavement beneath her feet , or the iron railings before the houses by her side , might have ears to hear her , "
95740	95741	95730	95730	I	0	" "
95745	95756	95743	95743	you	900	" said Robert , writing the address in his pocketbook . "
95782	95801	95772	95773	Mrs. Vincent	192	" He lifted his hat , bowed to the little dressmaker , and turned back to the cab . "
95812	95816	95805	95806	the baker	2115	" he thought . "
95832	96195	95802	95802	I	0	" The drive from Brompton to the Peckham Road was a very long one , and between Crescent Villas and Acacia Cottage , Robert Audley had ample leisure for reflection . He thought of his uncle lying weak and ill in the oak - room at Audley Court . He thought of the beautiful blue eyes watching Sir Michael 's slumbers ; the soft , white hands tending on his waking moments ; the low musical voice soothing his loneliness , cheering and consoling his declining years . What a pleasant picture it might have been , had he been able to look upon it ignorantly , seeing no more than others saw , looking no further than a stranger could look . But with the black cloud which he saw brooding over it , what an arch mockery , what a diabolical delusion it seemed . Peckham Grove — pleasant enough in the summer - time — has rather a dismal aspect upon a dull February day , when the trees are bare and leafless , and the little gardens desolate . Acacia Cottage bore small token of the fitness of its nomenclature , and faced the road with its stuccoed walls sheltered only by a couple of attenuated poplars . But it announced that it was Acacia Cottage by means of a small brass plate upon one of the gate - posts , which was sufficient indication for the sharp - sighted cabman , who dropped Mr. Audley upon the pavement before the little gate . Acacia Cottage was much lower in the social scale than Crescent Villas , and the small maid - servant who came to the low wooden gate and parleyed with Mr. Audley , was evidently well used to the encounter of relentless creditors across the same feeble barricade . She murmured the familiar domestic fiction of the uncertainty regarding her mistress 's whereabouts ; and told Robert that if he would please to state his name and business , she would go and see if Mrs. Vincent was at home . Mr. Audley produced a card , and wrote in pencil under his own name : "
96204	96735	96199	96202	the late Miss Graham	152	" He directed the small servant to carry his card to her mistress , and quietly awaited the result . The servant returned in about five minutes with the key of the gate . Her mistress was at home , she told Robert as she admitted him , and would be happy to see the gentleman . The square parlor into which Robert was ushered bore in every scrap of ornament , in every article of furniture , the unmistakable stamp of that species of poverty which is most comfortless because it is never stationary . The mechanic who furnishes his tiny sitting - room with half - a - dozen cane chairs , a Pembroke table , a Dutch clock , a tiny looking - glass , a crockery shepherd and shepherdess , and a set of gaudily - japanned iron tea - trays , makes the most of his limited possessions , and generally contrives to get some degree of comfort out of them ; but the lady who loses the handsome furniture of the house she is compelled to abandon and encamps in some smaller habitation with the shabby remainder — bought in by some merciful friend at the sale of her effects — carries with her an aspect of genteel desolation and tawdry misery not easily to be paralleled in wretchedness by any other phase which poverty can assume . The room which Robert Audley surveyed was furnished with the shabbier scraps snatched from the ruin which had overtaken the imprudent schoolmistress in Crescent Villas . A cottage piano , a chiffonier , six sizes too large for the room , and dismally gorgeous in gilded moldings that were chipped and broken ; a slim - legged card - table , placed in the post of honor , formed the principal pieces of furniture . A threadbare patch of Brussels carpet covered the center of the room , and formed an oasis of roses and lilies upon a desert of shabby green drugget . Knitted curtains shaded the windows , in which hung wire baskets of horrible - looking plants of the cactus species , that grew downward , like some demented class of vegetation , whose prickly and spider - like members had a fancy for standing on their heads . The green - baize covered card - table was adorned with gaudily - bound annuals or books of beauty , placed at right angles ; but Robert Audley did not avail himself of these literary distractions . He seated himself upon one of the rickety chairs , and waited patiently for the advent of the schoolmistress . He could hear the hum of half - a - dozen voices in a room near him , and the jingling harmonies of a set of variations in Deh Conte , upon a piano , whose every wire was evidently in the last stage of attenuation . He had waited for about a quarter of an hour , when the door was opened , and a lady , very much dressed , and with the setting sunlight of faded beauty upon her face , entered the room . "
96742	96765	96736	96737	Mr. Audley	173	" she said , motioning to Robert to reseat himself , and placing herself in an easy - chair opposite to him . "
96783	96784	96780	96780	my	0	" "
96796	96802	96787	96787	I	0	" Robert answered , politely ; "
96834	96835	96824	96832	the lady whose name I wrote upon my card	2746	" "
96838	96839	96824	96832	the lady whose name I wrote upon my card	2746	" "
96859	96860	96845	96845	you	173	" "
96916	96917	96905	96905	I	0	" "
96925	96931	96919	96919	you	173	" Robert asked , eagerly . "
96936	96957	96919	96919	you	173	" Mr. Audley was silent for a few moments , the shadow of gloomy thoughts gathering darkly on his face . "
96990	97000	96962	96962	you	173	" Mrs. Vincent smiled at her visitor 's question . "
97011	97015	97001	97001	I	0	" she said ; "
97026	97049	97001	97001	I	0	" Robert Audley paused before he asked any further questions , and scrawled a few penciled words in his note - book . "
97065	97069	97063	97063	madam	2752	" he said . "
97088	97089	97071	97071	you	0	" "
97093	97098	97071	97071	you	0	" replied Mrs. Vincent . "
97123	97124	97127	97127	you	0	" "
97141	97190	97127	97127	you	0	" Mrs. Vincent smiled and shook her head . She had a pretty smile — the frank smile of a woman who had been admired , and who has too long felt the certainty of being able to please , to be utterly subjugated by any worldly misfortune . "
97204	97208	97201	97202	Mr. Audley	173	" she said . "
97317	97364	97310	97310	Tonks	282	" Robert Audley wondered who or what Tonks could be ; a diary , perhaps , or a memorandum - book — some obscure rival of Letsome . Mrs. Vincent rung the bell , which was answered by the maid - servant who had admitted Robert . "
97373	97377	97366	97367	Miss Tonks	282	" she said . "
97385	97473	97474	97474	Tonks	282	" In less than five minutes Miss Tonks made her appearance . She was wintry and rather frost - bitten in aspect , and seemed to bring cold air in the scanty folds of her somber merino dress . She was no age in particular , and looked as if she had never been younger , and would never grow older , but would remain forever working backward and forward in her narrow groove , like some self - feeding machine for the instruction of young ladies . "
97479	97487	97474	97474	Tonks	282	" said Mrs. Vincent , without ceremony , "
97514	97515	97499	97499	you	282	" "
97523	97528	97516	97516	She	282	" answered Miss Tonks ; "
97559	97560	97551	97551	I	0	" "
97573	97642	97566	97566	you	282	" exclaimed Mrs. Vincent , with her sweetest smile . It was , perhaps , because of the invaluable nature of Miss Tonks ' services that she had received no remuneration whatever from her employer for the last three or four years . Mrs. Vincent might have hesitated to pay from very contempt for the pitiful nature of the stipend as compared with the merits of the teacher . "
97658	97663	97664	97664	Tonks	282	" asked the schoolmistress . "
97674	97675	97664	97664	Tonks	282	" "
97691	97695	97677	97677	you	282	" Robert inquired . "
97700	97705	97677	97677	you	282	" answered Mrs. Vincent . "
97750	97751	97741	97742	Miss Graham	152	" "
97756	97768	97741	97742	Miss Graham	152	" replied Miss Tonks , shaking her grim little head significantly . "
97802	97809	97782	97782	She	152	" Miss Tonks added , spitefully . "
97816	97823	97826	97826	she	152	" Robert asked , rather eagerly . "
97829	97838	97826	97826	she	152	" replied Miss Tonks , with frosty decision ; "
97873	97874	97875	97875	You	282	" "
97886	97894	97875	97875	You	282	" asked Robert , addressing Mrs. Vincent . "
97897	97907	97908	97908	I	0	" the lady answered , with some little embarrassment ; "
98048	98049	98034	98034	you	2773	" "
98064	98085	98055	98055	they	572	" Miss Tonks answered , with icy sententiousness , and with no very perceptible relevance to the point in discussion . "
98097	98104	98093	98093	you	282	" Mrs. Vincent answered , reproachfully . "
98123	98124	98119	98119	I	0	" "
98129	98139	98140	98140	you	282	" replied Miss Tonks , with a chilling accent , "
98172	98173	98147	98147	She	152	" "
98188	98227	98175	98175	you	282	" Robert asked , looking from the schoolmistress to her teacher . He saw very clearly that Miss Tonks bore an envious grudge against Lucy Graham — a grudge which even the lapse of time had not healed . "
98244	98248	98239	98239	she	557	" he thought . "
98257	98336	98249	98249	She	557	" But Miss Tonks appeared to know nothing whatever ; except that Miss Graham had sometimes declared herself an ill - used creature , deceived by the baseness of mankind , and the victim of unmerited sufferings , in the way of poverty and deprivation . Beyond this , Miss Tonks could tell nothing ; and although she made the most of what she did know , Robert soon sounded the depth of her small stock of information . "
98346	98352	98337	98337	I	0	" he said at last . "
98385	98386	98413	98413	She	152	" "
98392	98397	98413	98413	She	152	" Mrs. Vincent replied . "
98400	98407	98408	98408	She	152	" cried Miss Tonks , sharply . "
98444	98451	98437	98437	you	0	" she asked , addressing Robert . "
98463	98467	98453	98453	you	0	" he answered , "
98477	98478	98479	98479	I	0	" "
98485	98490	98479	98479	I	0	" said Miss Tonks . "
98497	98515	98479	98479	I	0	" She ran out of the room before Mr. Audley had time to utter any polite remonstrance . "
98525	98535	98479	98479	I	0	" he thought , while the teacher was absent . "
98616	98727	98606	98607	Miss Tonks	282	" Miss Tonks re - entered while the young barrister was meditating upon the infamy of her sex . She carried a dilapidated paper - covered bonnet - box , which she submitted to Robert 's inspection . Mr. Audley knelt down to examine the scraps of railway labels and addresses which were pasted here and there upon the box . It had been battered upon a great many different lines of railway , and had evidently traveled considerably . Many of the labels had been torn off , but fragments of some of them remained , and upon one yellow scrap of paper Robert read the letters , TURI . "
98735	98739	98606	98607	Miss Tonks	282	" he thought . "
98759	98806	98749	98749	Turin	285	" The only direction which had not been either defaced or torn away was the last , which bore the name of Miss Graham , passenger to London . Looking very closely at this label , Mr. Audley discovered that it had been pasted over another . "
98826	98830	98808	98808	you	282	" he said . "
98852	98872	98843	98843	I	0	" Miss Tonks ran out of the room and returned immediately with a basin of water and a sponge . "
98880	98884	98843	98843	I	0	" she asked . "
98890	98896	98888	98888	you	282	" Robert answered , coldly . "
98905	99001	98903	98903	myself	0	" He damped the upper label several times before he could loosen the edges of the paper ; but after two or three careful attempts the moistened surface peeled off , without injury to the underneath address . Miss Tonks could not contrive to read this address across Robert 's shoulder , though she exhibited considerable dexterity in her endeavors to accomplish that object . Mr. Audley repeated his operations upon the lower label , which he removed from the box , and placed very carefully between two blank leaves of his pocket - book . "
99012	99022	99010	99010	ladies	5997	" he said , when he had done this . "
99047	99110	99040	99040	I	0	" Mrs. Vincent smiled and bowed , murmuring some complacent conventionality about the delight she had felt in Mr. Audley 's visit . Miss Tonks , more observant , stared at the white change , which had come over the young man 's face since he had removed the upper label from the box . Robert walked slowly away from Acacia Cottage . "
99127	99131	99040	99040	I	0	" he thought , "
99150	99184	99185	99185	I	0	" Robert Audley walked slowly through the leafless grove , under the bare and shadowless trees in the gray February atmosphere , thinking as he went of the discovery he had just made . "
99194	99198	99185	99185	I	0	" he pondered , "
99333	99378	99379	99379	My	0	" He walked on for a few paces revolving this question in his mind , with a darker shadow than the shadows of the gathering winter twilight on his face , and a heavy oppression of mingled sorrow and dread weighing down his heart . "
99385	99387	99379	99379	My	0	" he thought—"not
99454	99501	100228	100228	you	2810	" Mr. Audley hailed a passing hansom , and drove back to his chambers . He reached Figtree Court in time to write a few lines to Miss Talboys , and to post his letter at St. Martin's - le - Grand off before six o'clock . "
99509	100176	100228	100228	you	2810	" he thought , as he drove to the General Post Office with this brief epistle . He had written to Clara Talboys to inquire the name of the little seaport town in which George had met Captain Maldon and his daughter ; for in spite of the intimacy between the two young men , Robert Audley knew very few particulars of his friend 's brief married life . From the hour in which George Talboys had read the announcement of his wife 's death in the columns of the Times , he had avoided all mention of the tender history which had been so cruelly broken , the familiar record which had been so darkly blotted out . There was so much that was painful in that brief story ! There was such bitter self - reproach involved in the recollection of that desertion which must have seemed so cruel to her who waited and watched at home ! Robert Audley comprehended this , and he did not wonder at his friend 's silence . The sorrowful story had been tacitly avoided by both , and Robert was as ignorant of the unhappy history of this one year in his schoolfellow 's life as if they had never lived together in friendly companionship in those snug Temple chambers . The letter , written to Miss Talboys by her brother George , within a month of his marriage , was dated Harrowgate . It was at Harrowgate , therefore , Robert concluded , the young couple spent their honeymoon . Robert Audley had requested Clara Talboys to telegraph an answer to his question , in order to avoid the loss of a day in the accomplishment of the investigation he had promised to perform . The telegraphic answer reached Figtree Court before twelve o'clock the next day . The name of the seaport town was Wildernsea , Yorkshire . Within an hour of the receipt of this message , Mr. Audley arrived at the King's - cross station , and took his ticket for Wildernsea by an express train that started at a quarter before two . The shrieking engine bore him on the dreary northward journey , whirling him over desert wastes of flat meadow - land and bare cornfields , faintly tinted with fresh sprouting green . This northern road was strange and unfamiliar to the young barrister , and the wide expanse of the wintry landscape chilled him by its aspect of bare loneliness . The knowledge of the purpose of his journey blighted every object upon which his absent glances fixed themselves for a moment , only to wander wearily away ; only to turn inward upon that far darker picture always presenting itself to his anxious mind . It was dark when the train reached the Hull terminus , but Mr. Audley 's journey was not ended . Amidst a crowd of porters and scattered heaps of that incongruous and heterogeneous luggage with which travelers incumber themselves , he was led , bewildered and half asleep , to another train which was to convey him along the branch line that swept past Wildernsea , and skirted the border of the German Ocean . Half an hour after leaving Hull , Robert felt the briny freshness of the sea upon the breeze that blew in at the open window of the carriage , and an hour afterward the train stopped at a melancholy station , built amid a sandy desert , and inhabited by two or three gloomy officials , one of whom rung a terrific peal upon a harshly clanging bell as the train approached . Mr. Audley was the only passenger who alighted at the dismal station . The train swept on to the gayer scenes before the barrister had time to collect his senses , or to pick up the portmanteau which had been discovered with some difficulty amid a black cavern of baggage only illuminated by one lantern . "
100198	100226	100228	100228	you	2810	" he thought , as he stared hopelessly about him in the darkness . He called to one of the officials , and pointed to his portmanteau . "
100238	100240	100228	100228	you	2810	" he asked—"that
100254	100264	100228	100228	you	2810	" The man laughed as he shouldered the portmanteau . "
100282	100286	100278	100278	you	2810	" he said . "
100306	100377	100304	100304	sir	900	" The porter opened a wooden door in the station wall , and Robert Audley found himself upon a wide bowling - green of smooth grass , which surrounded a huge , square building , that loomed darkly on him through the winter 's night , its black solidity only relieved by two lighted windows , far apart from each other , and glimmering redly like beacons on the darkness . "
100386	100391	100384	100384	sir	900	" said the porter . "
100408	100626	100384	100384	sir	900	" In the face of the bare grass - plat , the tenantless wooden alcoves , and the dark windows of the hotel , it was indeed rather difficult to imagine that the place was ever gay with merry people taking pleasure in the bright summer weather ; but Robert Audley declared himself willing to believe anything the porter pleased to tell him , and followed his guide meekly to a little door at the side of the big hotel , which led into a comfortable bar , where the humbler classes of summer visitors were accommodated with such refreshments as they pleased to pay for , without running the gantlet of the prim , white - waistcoated waiters on guard at the principal entrance . But there were very few attendants retained at the hotel in the bleak February season , and it was the landlord himself who ushered Robert into a dreary wilderness of polished mahogany tables and horsehair cushioned chairs , which he called the coffee - room . Mr. Audley seated himself close to the wide steel fender , and stretched his cramped legs upon the hearth - rug , while the landlord drove the poker into the vast pile of coal , and sent a ruddy blaze roaring upward through the chimney . "
100637	100642	100635	100635	sir	900	" the man began . "
100648	100654	100646	100646	you	2818	" said Robert , indifferently ; "
100683	100684	100687	100687	sir	900	" "
100689	100690	100687	100687	sir	900	" "

100723	100732	100721	100721	sir	900	" the landlord answered , good - naturedly . "
100777	100801	100802	100802	I	0	" added the landlord , unconsciously quoting a small hand - book of the watering - place which he sold in the bar , "
100809	100810	100802	100802	I	0	" "
100825	100839	100840	100840	I	0	" interrupted Robert , with a feeble protest against the landlord 's volubility . "
100856	100892	100849	100854	some people who once lived here	2828	" The landlord bowed and smiled , with an air which implied his readiness to recite the biographies of all the inhabitants of the little seaport , if required by Mr. Audley to do so . "
100901	100913	100897	100897	you	0	" Robert asked , taking his memorandum book from his pocket . "
100929	100930	100935	100935	sir	900	" "
100937	100958	100935	100935	sir	900	" replied the landlord , with a pompous enjoyment of the air of solemnity and importance which pervaded this business . "
100974	100975	100979	100979	you	0	" "
100981	100991	100979	100979	you	0	" Robert murmured , interrupting the flow of words . "

101234	101235	101236	101237	Mrs. Talboys	181	" "
101239	101243	101236	101237	Mrs. Talboys	181	" suggested Robert . "
101295	101296	101285	101285	she	181	" "
101317	101321	101298	101298	you	900	" Robert asked . "
101328	101340	101326	101326	sir	900	" answered the landlord , after a few moments ' deliberation . "
101416	101423	101424	101425	Mrs. Barkamb	287	" added the landlord , briskly . "
101427	101428	101424	101425	Mrs. Barkamb	287	" "
101483	101484	101472	101472	she	287	" "
101516	101517	101520	101520	sir	900	" "
101534	102252	101528	101532	one of my own daughters	2872	" Robert Audley wrote Mrs. Barkamb 's address in his pocket - book , ate his solitary dinner , drank a couple of glasses of sherry , smoked a cigar , and then retired to the apartment in which a fire had been lighted for his comfort . He soon fell asleep , worn out with the fatigue of hurrying from place to place during the last two days ; but his slumber was not a heavy one , and he heard the disconsolate moaning of the wind upon the sandy wastes , and the long waves rolling in monotonously upon the flat shore . Mingling with these dismal sounds , the melancholy thoughts engendered by his joyless journey repeated themselves in never - varying succession in the chaos of his slumbering brain , and made themselves into visions of things that never had been and never could be upon this earth , but which had some vague relation to real events remembered by the sleeper . In those troublesome dreams he saw Audley Court , rooted up from amidst the green pastures and the shady hedgerows of Essex , standing bare and unprotected upon that desolate northern shore , threatened by the rapid rising of a boisterous sea , whose waves seemed gathering upward to descend and crush the house he loved . As the hurrying waves rolled nearer and nearer to the stately mansion , the sleeper saw a pale , starry face looking out of the silvery foam , and knew that it was my lady , transformed into a mermaid , beckoning his uncle to destruction . Beyond that rising sea great masses of cloud , blacker than the blackest ink , more dense than the darkest night , lowered upon the dreamer 's eye ; but as he looked at the dismal horizon the storm - clouds slowly parted , and from a narrow rent in the darkness a ray of light streamed out upon the hideous waves , which slowly , very slowly , receded , leaving the old mansion safe and firmly rooted on the shore . Robert awoke with the memory of this dream in his mind , and a sensation of physical relief , as if some heavy weight , which had oppressed him all the night , had been lifted from his breast . He fell asleep again , and did not awake until the broad winter sunlight shone upon the window - blind , and the shrill voice of the chambermaid at his door announced that it was half - past eight o'clock . At a quarter - before ten he had left Victoria Hotel , and was making his way along the lonely platform in front of a row of shadowless houses that faced the sea . This row of hard , uncompromising , square - built habitations stretched away to the little harbor , in which two or three merchant vessels and a couple of colliers were anchored . Beyond the harbor there loomed , gray and cold upon the wintry horizon , a dismal barrack , parted from the Wildernsea houses by a narrow creek , spanned by an iron drawbridge . The scarlet coat of the sentinel who walked backward and forward between two cannons , placed at remote angles before the barrack wall , was the only scrap of color that relieved the neutral - tinted picture of the gray stone houses and the leaden sea . On one side of the harbor a long stone pier stretched out far away into the cruel loneliness of the sea , as if built for the especial accommodation of some modern Timon , too misanthropical to be satisfied even with the solitude of Wildernsea , and anxious to get still further away from his fellow - creatures . It was on that pier George Talboys had first met his wife , under the blazing glory of a midsummer sky , and to the music of a braying band . It was there that the young cornet had first yielded to that sweet delusion , that fatal infatuation which had exercised so dark an influence upon his after - life . Robert looked savagely at this solitary watering - place — the shabby seaport . "
102261	102265	101528	101532	one of my own daughters	2872	" he thought , "
102474	102607	102608	102608	I	0	" Ruminating in this wise , Robert Audley reached the house to which he had been directed as the residence of Mrs. Barkamb . He was admitted immediately by a prim , elderly servant , who ushered him into a sitting - room as prim and elderly - looking as herself . Mrs. Barkamb , a comfortable matron of about sixty years of age , was sitting in an arm - chair before a bright handful of fire in the shining grate . An elderly terrier , whose black - and - tan coat was thickly sprinkled with gray , reposed in Mrs. Barkamb 's lap . Every object in the quiet sitting - room had an elderly aspect of simple comfort and precision , which is the evidence of outward repose . "
102615	102619	102608	102608	I	0	" Robert thought , "
102658	102705	102706	102706	You	2891	" He seated himself in the arm - chair opposite Mrs. Barkamb , at that lady 's invitation , and placed his hat upon the ground . The elderly terrier descended from his mistress ' lap to bark at and otherwise take objection to this hat . "
102729	102769	102770	102770	I	0	" suggested Mrs. Barkamb , whose mind ran in one narrow groove , and whose life during the last twenty years had been an unvarying round of house - letting . Robert Audley explained the purpose of his visit . "
102778	102785	102770	102770	I	0	" he said , in conclusion , "
102822	102830	102810	102810	you	2891	" Mrs. Barkamb deliberated for some moments . "
102843	102847	102831	102831	I	0	" she said , "
102877	102888	102874	102875	Mrs. Talboys	181	" Mrs. Barkamb paused for a few moments before resuming . "
102899	102903	102893	102894	Mrs. Talboys	181	" she asked . "
102912	102913	102904	102904	I	0	" "
103011	103012	102998	103009	her little boy , who was out at nurse in the neighborhood	2903	" "
103025	103026	103014	103014	you	0	" "
103032	103037	103014	103014	you	0	" answered Mrs. Barkamb ; "
103096	103241	103242	103242	I	0	" Mr. Audley said that it was only probable the letter was dated . Mrs. Barkamb retired to a table in the window on which stood an old - fashioned mahogany desk , lined with green baize , and suffering from a plethora of documents , which oozed out of it in every direction . Letters , receipts , bills , inventories and tax - papers were mingled in hopeless confusion ; and among these Mrs. Barkamb set to work to search for Captain Maldon 's letter . Mr. Audley waited very patiently , watching the gray clouds sailing across the gray sky , the gray vessels gliding past upon the gray sea . After about ten minutes ' search , and a great deal of rustling , crackling , folding and unfolding of the papers , Mrs. Barkamb uttered an exclamation of triumph . "
103248	103252	103242	103242	I	0	" she said ; "
103264	103285	103261	103262	Mrs. Talboys	181	" Robert Audley 's pale face flushed a vivid crimson as he stretched out his hand to receive the papers . "
103310	103332	103333	103333	My	0	" he thought . The letter from the old lieutenant was not long , but almost every other word was underscored . "
103337	103373	103333	103333	My	0	" the writer began — Mr. Maldon had tried the lady 's generosity pretty severely during his residence in her house , rarely paying his rent until threatened with the intruding presence of the broker 's man—"I
103442	103449	103432	103432	Helen	238	" Yours in distraction and despair , "
103453	103462	103432	103432	Helen	238	" NORTH COTTAGES , August 16th , 1854 . "
103478	103565	103466	103467	Mrs. Talboys	181	" I am weary of my life here , and wish , if I can , to find a new one . I go out into the world , dissevered from every link which binds me to the hateful past , to seek another home and another fortune . Forgive me if I have been fretful , capricious , changeable . You should forgive me , for you know why I have been so . You know the secret which is the key to my life . "
103569	103609	103466	103467	Mrs. Talboys	181	" These lines were written in a hand that Robert Audley knew only too well . He sat for a long time pondering silently over the letter written by Helen Talboys . What was the meaning of those two last sentences—"You
103635	103787	103623	103623	You	2914	" He wearied his brain in endeavoring to find a clew to the signification of these two sentences . He could remember nothing , nor could he imagine anything that would throw a light upon their meaning . The date of Helen 's departure , according to Mr. Maldon 's letter , was the 16th of August , 1854 . Miss Tonks had declared that Lucy Graham entered the school at Crescent Villas upon the 17th or 18th of August in the same year . Between the departure of Helen Talboys from the Yorkshire watering - place and the arrival of Lucy Graham at the Brompton school , not more than eight - and - forty hours could have elapsed . This made a very small link in the chain of circumstantial evidence , perhaps ; but it was a link , nevertheless , and it fitted neatly into its place . "
103801	103805	103789	103790	Mr. Maldon	182	" Robert asked . "
103816	103821	103810	103810	he	182	" Mrs. Barkamb answered ; "
103913	104020	103896	103898	the old gentleman	2916	" Mrs. Barkamb had nothing more to tell , and Robert had no further questions to ask . He requested permission to retain the two letters written by the lieutenant and his daughter , and left the house with them in his pocket - book . He walked straight back to the hotel , where he called for a time - table . An express for London left Wildernsea at a quarter past one . Robert sent his portmanteau to the station , paid his bill , and walked up and down the stone terrace fronting the sea , waiting for the starting of the train . "
104037	104041	104042	104042	my	0	" he thought ; "
104060	104083	104051	104058	the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard	2925	" Upon his return from Wildernsea , Robert Audley found a letter from his Cousin Alicia , awaiting him at his chambers . "
104089	104095	104084	104084	Papa	188	" the young lady wrote , "
104156	104157	104151	104153	Your affectionate cousin	5077	" "
104168	104184	104185	104185	She	468	" thought Robert Audley , as he sat brooding and smoking by his lonely fireside . "
104276	104313	104272	104272	she	468	" He repeated this question again and again as he filled and emptied his meerschaum , surrounding himself with the blue vapor from his pipe until he looked like some modern magician seated in his laboratory . "
104421	104541	104404	104404	I	0	" His thoughts wandered away to that gloomy prospect in which he saw no gleam of brightness to relieve the dull , black obscurity that encompassed the future , shutting in his pathway on every side , and spreading a dense curtain around and about him , which Hope was powerless to penetrate . He was forever haunted by the vision of his uncle 's anguish , forever tortured by the thought of that ruin and desolation which , being brought about by his instrumentality , would seem in a manner his handiwork . But amid all , and through all , Clara Talboys , with an imperious gesture , beckoned him onward to her brother 's unknown grave . "
104549	104553	104543	104543	I	0	" he thought , "
104708	104853	104858	104858	her	2952	" He started early the next morning for Essex , and reached Audley before eleven o'clock . Early as it was , my lady was out . She had driven to Chelmsford upon a shopping expedition with her step - daughter . She had several calls to make in the neighborhood of the town , and was not likely to return until dinner - time . Sir Michael 's health was very much improved , and he would come down stairs in the afternoon . Would Mr. Audley go to his uncle 's room ? No ; Robert had no wish to meet that generous kinsman . What could he say to him ? How could he smooth the way to the trouble that was to come?—how soften the cruel blow of the great grief that was preparing for that noble and trusting heart ? "
104866	104870	104855	104855	I	0	" Robert thought , "
104892	104956	104957	104957	I	0	" He told his uncle 's servant that he would stroll into the village , and return before dinner . He walked slowly away from the Court , wandering across the meadows between his uncle 's house and the village , purposeless and indifferent , with the great trouble and perplexity of his life stamped upon his face and reflected in his manner . "
104964	104968	104957	104957	I	0	" he thought , "
104991	105060	104957	104957	I	0	" He was in those very meadows through which he had hurried from Audley Court to the station upon the September day in which George Talboys had disappeared . He looked at the pathway by which he had gone upon that day , and remembered his unaccustomed hurry , and the vague feeling of terror which had taken possession of him immediately upon losing sight of his friend . "
105070	105074	105096	105097	a monomania	2957	" he thought . "
105220	105230	105231	105231	I	0	" he smiled bitterly , and shook his head . "
105248	105252	105231	105231	I	0	" he thought . "
105268	105527	105231	105231	I	0	" He avoided the village , still keeping to the meadows . The church lay a little way back from the straggling High street , and a rough wooden gate opened from the churchyard into a broad meadow , that was bordered by a running stream , and sloped down into a grassy valley dotted by groups of cattle . Robert slowly ascended the narrow hillside pathway leading up to the gate in the churchyard . The quiet dullness of the lonely landscape harmonized with his own gloom . The solitary figure of an old man hobbling toward a stile at the further end of the wide meadow was the only human creature visible upon the area over which the young barrister looked . The smoke slowly ascending from the scattered houses in the long High street was the only evidence of human life . The slow progress of the hands of the old clock in the church steeple was the only token by which a traveler could perceive that a sluggish course of rustic life had not come to a full stop in the village of Audley . Yes , there was one other sign . As Robert opened the gate of the churchyard , and strolled listessly into the little inclosure , he became aware of the solemn music of an organ , audible through a half - open window in the steeple . He stopped and listened to the slow harmonies of a dreamy melody that sounded like an extempore composition of an accomplished player . "
105541	105545	105231	105231	I	0	" thought Robert . "
105581	105875	105568	105568	I	0	" He lingered at the gate , not caring to break the lazy spell woven about him by the monotonous melancholy of the organist 's performance . The tones of the instrument , now swelling to their fullest power , now sinking to a low , whispering softness , floated toward him upon the misty winter atmosphere , and had a soothing influence , that seemed to comfort him in his trouble . He closed the gate softly , and crossed the little patch of gravel before the door of the church . The door had been left ajar — by the organist , perhaps . Robert Audley pushed it open , and walked into the square porch , from which a flight of narrow stone steps wound upward to the organ - loft and the belfry . Mr. Audley took off his hat , and opened the door between the porch and the body of the church . He stepped softly into the holy edifice , which had a damp , moldy smell upon week - days . He walked down the narrow aisle to the altar - rails , and from that point of observation took a survey of the church . The little gallery was exactly opposite to him , but the scanty green curtains before the organ were closely drawn , and he could not get a glimpse of the player . The music still rolled on . The organist had wandered into a melody of Mendelssohn 's , a strain whose dreamy sadness went straight to Robert 's heart . He loitered in the nooks and corners of the church , examining the dilapidated memorials of the well - nigh forgotten dead , and listening to the music . "
105928	105945	105946	105946	I	0	" thought Robert Audley , as he read the faded inscriptions upon tablets of discolored marble ; "
105987	105994	105957	105957	his	6106	" He looked at his watch . "
106000	106004	105957	105957	his	6106	" he muttered . "
106093	106110	106088	106088	I	0	" The music of the organ ceased , and Robert heard the closing of the instrument . "
106121	106125	106117	106119	this new organist	2974	" he thought , "
106151	106461	106117	106119	this new organist	2974	" He lingered in the porch , waiting for the organist to descend the awkward little stair - case . In the weary trouble of his mind , and with the prospect of getting through the five hours in the best way he could , Mr. Audley was glad to cultivate any diversion of thought , however idle . He therefore freely indulged his curiosity about the new organist . The first person who appeared upon the steep stone steps was a boy in corduroy trousers and a dark linen smock - frock , who shambled down the stairs with a good deal of unnecessary clatter of his hobnailed shoes , and who was red in the face from the exertion of blowing the bellows of the old organ . Close behind this boy came a young lady , very plainly dressed in a black silk gown and a large gray shawl , who started and turned pale at sight of Mr. Audley . This young lady was Clara Talboys . Of all people in the world she was the last whom Robert either expected or wished to see . She had told him that she was going to pay a visit to some friends who lived in Essex ; but the county is a wide one , and the village of Audley one of the most obscure and least frequented spots in the whole of its extent . That the sister of his lost friend should be here — here where she could watch his every action , and from those actions deduce the secret workings of his mind , tracing his doubts home to their object , made a complication of his difficulties that he could never have anticipated . It brought him back to that consciousness of his own helplessness , in which he had exclaimed : "
106488	106497	106498	106498	You	2977	" Clara Talboys was the first to speak . "
106509	106513	106506	106507	Mr. Audley	173	" she said . "
106518	106519	106520	106520	I	0	" "
106640	106641	106642	106642	I	0	" "
106646	106664	106642	106642	I	0	" Robert answered , wondering at the lady 's calmness , in contradistinction to his own embarrassment . "
106733	106734	106737	106737	they	2997	" "
106751	106752	106737	106737	they	2997	" "
106765	106766	106754	106754	you	0	" "
106769	106814	106754	106754	you	0	" Robert stood with his hat in his hand , looking absently out at the tombstones and the low wall of the church yard . Clara Talboys watched his pale face , haggard under the deepening shadow that had rested upon it so long . "
106828	106854	106825	106826	Mr. Audley	173	" she said , in a low voice , that had the same melodious sadness as the notes of the old organ under her touch . "
106877	106887	106891	106891	she	2998	" He was thinking as he spoke to her : "
106900	106975	106897	106897	she	2998	" He had told the story of George 's disappearance and of his own suspicions , suppressing only the names of those concerned in the mystery ; but what if this girl should fathom this slender disguise , and discover for herself that which he had chosen to withhold . Her grave eyes were fixed upon his face , and he knew that she was trying to read the innermost secrets of his mind . "
106983	106987	106980	106980	her	2998	" he thought . "
107064	107118	107119	107119	You	0	" Mr. Audley was clearing his throat preparatory to bidding his beautiful companion good - morning , and making his escape from the thraldom of her presence into the lonely meadow outside the churchyard , when Clara Talboys arrested him by speaking upon that very subject which he was most anxious to avoid . "
107129	107133	107119	107119	You	0	" she said , "
107171	107188	107166	107166	you	173	" Robert Audley was silent for some moments . How could he answer this direct question ? "
107210	107218	107204	107208	the person whom I suspect	3004	" he said , after a pause , "
107244	107245	107229	107229	I	0	" "
107260	107261	107247	107247	you	173	" "
107269	107270	107271	107271	I	0	" "
107283	107284	107277	107277	you	173	" "
107290	107291	107285	107285	I	0	" "
107305	107306	107298	107298	you	173	" "
107310	107314	107315	107315	You	173	" answered Robert . "
107470	107521	107522	107522	You	3016	" He spoke in a low voice , and with a solemn emphasis that betrayed the intensity of his feeling . Miss Talboys stretched out her ungloved hand , and laid it in his own . The cold touch of that slender hand sent a shivering thrill through his frame . "
107538	107544	107535	107536	Mr. Audley	173	" she said , quietly . "
107557	107593	107548	107548	you	3016	" The rector 's wife and her two companions entered the churchyard as Clara Talboys said this . Robert Audley pressed the hand that rested in his own , and raised it to his lips . "
107609	107613	107594	107594	I	0	" he said ; "
107671	107696	107699	107702	that handsome young man	3022	" He put on his hat , and hurried through the gateway leading into the field as Mrs. Martyn came up to the porch . "
107715	107721	107722	107722	He	3022	" she asked , laughing . "
107736	107737	107725	107726	Mr. Audley	173	" "
107752	107753	107745	107747	Sir Michael Audley	146	" "
107758	107759	107754	107756	Sir Michael Audley	146	" "
107800	107801	107802	107802	His	465	" "
107806	107817	107802	107802	His	465	" replied Clara Talboys , looking earnestly at her friend . "
107827	107828	107802	107802	His	465	" "
107895	107952	107875	107875	Clara	256	" Clara Talboys took her seat in the little basket - carriage which was waiting at the principal gate of the churchyard , in the care of the boy who had blown the organ - bellows . Mrs. Martyn shook the reins , and the sturdy chestnut cob trotted off in the direction of Mount Stanning . "
107965	107975	107963	107963	Fanny	294	" Miss Talboys said , after a long pause . "
107991	107992	107995	107995	she	150	" "
108001	108002	107995	107995	she	150	" "
108009	108010	108004	108004	she	150	" "
108048	108091	108092	108092	My	0	" Clara Talboys was silent . She did not ask any further questions about my lady . She was thinking of a passage in that letter which George had written to her during his honeymoon — a passage in which he said : "
108159	108260	108135	108135	her	150	" Robert Audley was loitering upon the broad grass - plat in front of the Court as the carriage containing my lady and Alicia drove under the archway , and drew up at the low turret - door . Mr. Audley presented himself in time to hand the ladies out of the vehicle . My lady looked very pretty in a delicate blue bonnet and the sables which her nephew had bought for her at St. Petersburg . She seemed very well pleased to see Robert , and smiled most bewitchingly as she gave him her exquisitely gloved little hand . "
108271	108277	108262	108262	you	3041	" she said , laughing . "
108305	108324	108303	108303	Alicia	149	" Miss Audley gave her head a scornful toss that shook the heavy curls under her cavalier hat . "
108339	108343	108325	108325	I	0	" she said . "
108376	108392	108367	108367	I	0	" Mr. Audley looked at his cousin with an expression of serio - comic perplexity . "
108399	108403	108393	108393	She	3046	" he thought , "
108430	108464	108419	108419	she	3046	" He pulled his mustaches reflectively as he considered this question . His mind wandered away for a few moments from the great trouble of his life to dwell upon this minor perplexity . "
108471	108475	108467	108469	a dear girl	3049	" he thought ; "
108490	108539	108465	108465	She	3046	" He lost himself in a quagmire of doubt and difficulty . There was some hitch in his mind which he could not understand ; some change in himself , beyond the change made in him by his anxiety about George Talboys , which mystified and bewildered him . "
108557	108649	108650	108650	I	0	" asked my lady , as she lingered with her step - daughter upon the threshold of the turret - door , waiting until Robert should be pleased to stand aside and allow them to pass . The young man started as she asked this question and looked up at her suddenly . Something in the aspect of her bright young beauty , something in the childish innocence of her expression , seemed to smite him to the heart , and his face grew ghastly pale as he looked at her . "
108657	108661	108650	108650	I	0	" he said ; "
108681	108719	108720	108720	I	0	" The white change in my lady 's face was the only sign of her having heard these words . She smiled , a faint , sickly smile , and tried to pass her husband 's nephew . "
108726	108730	108720	108720	I	0	" she said . "
108749	108750	108740	108741	Mr. Audley	173	" "
108765	108774	108775	108775	I	0	" Robert answered , in a low voice . "
108787	108788	108775	108775	I	0	" "
108792	108849	108775	108775	I	0	" asked my lady . She had recovered herself from any shock which she might have sustained a few moments before , and it was in her usual manner that she asked this question . Her face expressed the mingled bewilderment and curiosity of a puzzled child , rather than the serious surprise of a woman . "
108863	108867	108868	108868	I	0	" she repeated . "
108877	108901	108868	108868	I	0	" Robert said , glancing at his cousin , who stood a little way behind my lady , watching this confidential little dialogue . "
108917	108921	108926	108926	her	1084	" thought Alicia , "
108951	108971	108972	108974	The absurd creature	3058	" Miss Audley walked away to the grass - plat , turning her back upon Robert and my lady . "
108986	108990	108972	108974	The absurd creature	3058	" she thought . "
109069	109139	109141	109141	you	3061	" Poor Alicia crossed the grass - plat and disappeared upon the opposite side of the quadrangle , where there was a Gothic gate that communicated with the stables . I am sorry to say that Sir Michael Audley 's daughter went to seek consolation from her dog Caesar and her chestnut mare Atalanta , whose loose box the young lady was in the habit of visiting every day . "
109152	109163	109141	109141	you	3061	" said Robert , as his cousin left the garden . "
109195	109196	109189	109189	you	3061	" "
109201	109236	109198	109198	you	0	" answered my lady . Mr. Audley could see that she was trembling , and that she glanced from side to side as if looking for some outlet by which she might escape him . "
109244	109248	109241	109242	Lady Audley	150	" he said . "
109313	109360	109361	109361	I	0	" There was a painful piteousness in her tone . Heaven knows how painful to Robert 's heart . Heaven knows what horrible images arose in his mind as he looked down at that fair young face and thought of the task that lay before him . "
109370	109374	109361	109361	I	0	" he said . "
109447	109549	109437	109437	I	0	" There was a cold determination in his tone which silenced my lady 's objections . She followed him submissively to the little iron gate which communicated with the long garden behind the house — the garden in which a little rustic wooden bridge led across the quiet fish - pond into the lime - walk . The early winter twilight was closing in , and the intricate tracery of the leafless branches that overarched the lonely pathway looked black against the cold gray of the evening sky . The lime - walk seemed like some cloister in this uncertain light . "
109568	109575	109552	109552	you	0	" cried my lady , peevishly . "
109585	109586	109587	109587	You	0	" "
109594	109595	109587	109587	You	0	" "
109640	109641	109634	109634	he	151	" "
109654	109660	109646	109646	Macbeth	295	" asked Robert , gravely . "
109689	109690	109679	109679	he	151	" "
109699	109704	109705	109705	I	0	" exclaimed Lady Audley . "
109712	109716	109705	109705	I	0	" answered Robert . "
109818	109819	109821	109821	you	0	" "
109824	109833	109821	109821	you	0	" she answered , with a little laugh . "
109842	109843	109821	109821	you	0	" "
109846	109847	109821	109821	you	0	" "
109858	109902	109905	109905	you	0	" Robert Audley heard my lady 's quickened breathing , he fancied he could almost hear the loud beating of her heart as she walked by his side , shivering now and then , and with her sable cloak wrapped tightly around her . "
109908	109920	109905	109905	you	0	" she cried suddenly , after a pause of some moments . "
109985	109986	109973	109974	George Talboys	181	" "
110001	110002	109998	109998	he	3075	" "
110006	110011	109998	109998	he	3075	" answered Lady Audley . "
110020	110021	109998	109998	he	3075	" "
110042	110046	110034	110034	I	0	" asked Robert . "
110049	110054	110034	110034	I	0	" cried Lady Audley ; "
110127	110128	110110	110110	you	0	" "
110147	110153	110144	110145	Lady Audley	150	" answered Robert , resolutely . "
110179	110180	110170	110170	you	0	" "
110198	110205	110193	110193	you	0	" replied my lady , carelessly . "
110214	110215	110193	110193	you	0	" "
110227	110233	110193	110193	you	0	" Robert began , gravely , "
110249	110250	110246	110247	his wife	554	" "
110256	110263	110246	110247	his wife	554	" said my lady , quickly . "
110267	110274	110246	110247	his wife	554	" she added , more deliberately , "
110294	110303	110285	110285	you	0	" Robert Audley did not notice this observation . "
110319	110323	110316	110317	his wife	554	" he repeated . "
110474	110475	110531	110531	she	673	" "
110478	110483	110531	110531	she	673	" said my lady ; "
110506	110507	110500	110501	Mrs. Talboys	181	" "
110517	110523	110510	110510	herself	673	" Robert answered , quietly . "
110527	110528	110510	110510	herself	673	" "
110567	110574	110547	110547	she	673	" Lady Audley shrugged her shoulders . "
110584	110588	110547	110547	she	673	" she said ; "
110603	110604	110595	110595	you	173	" "
110621	110634	110636	110636	I	0	" continued Robert , without replying to my lady 's last observation , "
110777	110778	110773	110773	you	0	" "
110783	110788	110773	110773	you	0	" said my lady . "

111087	111092	111093	111093	You	0	" asked my lady . "

111133	111137	111130	111131	Lady Audley	150	" said Robert , "

111348	111355	111312	111312	she	3127	" asked my lady , eagerly . "
111383	111401	111402	111402	She	3132	" My lady shrugged her graceful shoulders , and flashed bright defiance out of her blue eyes . "
111421	111425	111402	111402	She	3132	" she said . "
111655	111677	111685	111685	you	173	" cried my lady , her voice rising to that shrill and piercing tone peculiar to her when affected by any intense agitation—"by

111724	111726	111721	111722	Lady Audley	150	" answered Robert—"by

112085	112089	112065	112065	I	0	" she said ; "
112125	112126	112129	112130	Lady Audley	150	" "
112132	112164	112129	112130	Lady Audley	150	" answered Robert , with a cold sternness that was so strange to him as to transform him into another creature — a pitiless embodiment of justice , a cruel instrument of retribution—"no
112169	112173	112166	112167	Lady Audley	150	" he repeated , "
112223	112224	112211	112211	I	0	" "
112230	112237	112227	112227	you	0	" asked my lady , suddenly . "
112250	112254	112238	112238	You	150	" pursued Robert , "
112492	112493	112494	112494	You	3166	" "
112501	112506	112498	112499	Mr. Audley	173	" cried my lady . "
112551	112552	112524	112525	Helen Talboys	179	" "
112559	112564	112524	112525	Helen Talboys	179	" replied Robert Audley ; "
112573	112574	112524	112525	Helen Talboys	179	" "
112578	112579	112524	112525	Helen Talboys	179	" "
112622	112668	112618	112620	Mrs. George Talboys	181	" My lady was silent . Robert Audley could not see her face in the dusk , but he could see that her two small hands were clasped convulsively over her heart , and he knew that the shot had gone home to its mark . "
112678	112682	112683	112683	She	179	" he thought . "
112760	113047	112753	112753	I	0	" He walked by my lady 's side , silently , for some minutes . They had been pacing up and down the dim avenue , and they were now drawing near the leafless shrubbery at one end of the lime - walk — the shrubbery in which the ruined well sheltered its unheeded decay among the tangled masses of briery underwood . A winding pathway , neglected and half - choked with weeds , led toward this well . Robert left the lime - walk , and struck into this pathway . There was more light in the shrubbery than in the avenue , and Mr. Audley wished to see my lady 's face . He did not speak until they reached the patch of rank grass beside the well . The massive brickwork had fallen away here and there , and loose fragments of masonry lay buried amidst weeds and briars . The heavy posts which had supported the wooden roller still remained , but the iron spindle had been dragged from its socket and lay a few paces from the well , rusty , discolored , and forgotten . Robert Audley leaned against one of the moss - grown posts and looked down at my lady 's face , very pale in the chill winter twilight . The moon had newly risen , a feebly luminous crescent in the gray heavens , and a faint , ghostly light mingled with the misty shadows of the declining day . My lady 's face seemed like that face which Robert Audley had seen in his dreams looking out of the white foam - flakes on the green sea waves and luring his uncle to destruction . "
113059	113063	113056	113057	Lady Audley	150	" he resumed . "
113197	113198	113188	113195	someone who could identify you with the past	3179	" "
113201	113206	113188	113195	someone who could identify you with the past	3179	" cried my lady , "
113359	113379	113380	113380	She	179	" Robert Audley started and recoiled a few paces among the weeds and brushwood as my lady said this . "
113399	113403	113404	113404	She	179	" he thought . "
113424	113491	113410	113410	her	179	" I do not say that Robert Audley was a coward , but I will admit that a shiver of horror , something akin to fear , chilled him to the heart as he remembered the horrible things that have been done by women since that day upon which Eve was created to be Adam 's companion and help - meet in the garden of Eden . "
113699	113707	113708	113708	he	173	" I have shown her my cards , "
113711	113745	113708	113708	he	173	" but she has kept hers hidden from me . The mask that she wears is not to be plucked away . My uncle would rather think me mad than believe her guilty . "
113775	113790	113791	113791	he	173	" What a coward I am to think of myself or my own danger , "
113794	113826	113791	113791	he	173	" The more I see of this woman the more reason I have to dread her influence upon others ; the more reason to wish her far away from this house . "
113861	113880	113881	113881	he	173	" It was somewhere in this garden that she met George Talboys upon the day of his disappearance , "
113884	113912	113881	113881	he	173	" I wonder where it was they met ; I wonder where it was that he looked into her cruel face and taxed her with her falsehood ? "
113954	113970	113972	113973	Robert Audley	173	" It is to be a duel to the death , then , my lady , "
113977	114024	113972	113973	Robert Audley	173	" You refuse to accept my warning . You refuse to run away and repent of your wickedness in some foreign place , far from the generous gentleman you have deceived and fooled by your false witcheries . You choose to remain here and defy me . "
114025	114029	114031	114032	Lady Audley	150	" I do , "
114045	114070	114035	114035	her	150	" It is no fault of mine if my husband 's nephew goes mad , and chooses me for the victim of his monomania . "
114071	114081	114083	114083	Robert	173	" So be it , then , my lady , "
114085	114207	114083	114083	Robert	173	" My friend George Talboys was last seen entering these gardens by the little iron gate by which we came in to - night . He was last heard inquiring for you . He was seen to enter these gardens , but he was never seen to leave them . I believe that he met his death within the boundary of these grounds ; and that his body lies hidden below some quiet water , or in some forgotten corner of this place . I will have such a search made as shall level that house to the earth and root up every tree in these gardens , rather than I will fail in finding the grave of my murdered friend . "
114275	114284	114285	114285	she	197	" You shall never live to do this , "
114288	114366	114285	114285	she	197	" I will kill you first . Why have you tormented me so ? Why could you not let me alone ? What harm had I ever done you that you should make yourself my persecutor , and dog my steps , and watch my looks , and play the spy upon me ? Do you want to drive me mad ? Do you know what it is to wrestle with a mad - woman ? No , "
114375	114385	114386	114386	She	468	" you do not , or you would never — "
114428	114435	114436	114436	she	468	" Go away , Mr. Audley , "
114439	114452	114436	114436	she	468	" You are mad , I tell you , you are mad . "
114453	114461	114463	114463	Robert	173	" I am going , my lady , "
114467	114509	114510	114510	He	173	" I would have condoned your crimes out of pity to your wretcheness . You have refused to accept my mercy . I wished to have pity upon the living . I shall henceforth only remember my duty to the dead . "
114591	114602	114603	114603	she	190	" I have been looking for you everywhere , Robert , "
114606	114623	114603	114603	she	190	" Papa has come down to the library , and will be glad to see you . "
114639	114643	114644	114644	he	667	" Good Heaven ! "
114647	114698	114644	114644	he	667	" can these two women be of the same clay ? Can this frank , generous - hearted girl , who can not conceal any impulse of her innocent nature , be of the same flesh and blood as that wretched creature whose shadow falls upon the path beside me ! "
114726	114742	114744	114745	my lady	468	" I do n't know what has come to your cousin , my dear Alicia , "
114747	114764	114744	114745	my lady	468	" He is so absent - minded and eccentric as to be quite beyond my comprehension . "
114765	114768	114770	114771	Miss Audley	149	" Indeed , "
114773	114801	114770	114771	Miss Audley	149	" and yet I should imagine , from the length of your tête - a - tête , that you had made some effort to understand him . "
114802	114807	114809	114809	Robert	173	" Oh , yes , "
114813	114874	114809	114809	Robert	173	" my lady and I understand each other very well ; but as it is growing late I will wish you good - evening , ladies . I shall sleep to - night at Mount Stanning , as I have some business to attend to up there , and I will come down and see my uncle to - morrow . "
114875	114880	114882	114882	Alicia	149	" What , Robert , "
114884	114895	114882	114882	Alicia	149	" you surely wo n't go away without seeing papa ? "
114896	114902	114904	114906	the young man	667	" Yes , my dear , "
114908	114950	114951	114951	He	667	" I am a little disturbed by some disagreeable business in which I am very much concerned , and I would rather not see my uncle . Good - night , Alicia . I will come or write to - morrow . "
114998	115012	115014	115015	Miss Audley	149	" What in goodness ' name is the matter with my Cousin Robert ? "
115024	115081	115014	115015	Miss Audley	149	" What does he mean by these absurd goings - on ? Some disagreeable business that disturbs him , indeed ! I suppose the unhappy creature has had a brief forced upon him by some evil - starred attorney , and is sinking into a state of imbecility from a dim consciousness of his own incompetence . "
115082	115094	115096	115097	my lady	468	" Have you ever studied your cousin 's character , Alicia ? "
115106	115123	115125	115125	Alicia	149	" Studied his character ! No , Lady Audley . Why should I study his character ? "
115127	115160	115125	115125	Alicia	149	" There is very little study required to convince anybody that he is a lazy , selfish Sybarite , who cares for nothing in the world except his own ease and comfort . "
115161	115170	115228	115229	my lady	468	" But have you never thought him eccentric ? "
115171	115174	115176	115176	Alicia	149	" Eccentric ! "
115189	115212	115176	115176	Alicia	149	" Well , yes — I believe that is the excuse generally made for such people . I suppose Bob is eccentric . "
115213	115226	115228	115229	my lady	468	" I have never heard you speak of his father and mother , "
115233	115239	115228	115229	my lady	468	" Do you remember them ? "
115240	115286	115176	115176	Alicia	149	" I never saw his mother . She was a Miss Dalrymple , a very dashing girl , who ran away with my uncle , and lost a very handsome fortune in consequence . She died at Nice when poor Bob was five years old . "
115287	115297	115176	115176	Alicia	149	" Did you ever hear anything particular about her ? "
115298	115307	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" How do you mean ' particular ? ' "
115311	115328	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" Did you ever hear that she was eccentric — what people call ' odd ? ' "
115329	115334	115336	115336	Alicia	149	" Oh , no , "
115340	115385	115336	115336	Alicia	149	" My aunt was a very reasonable woman , I believe , though she did marry for love . But you must remember that she died before I was born , and I have not , therefore , felt very much curiosity about her . "
115386	115396	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" But you recollect your uncle , I suppose . "
115397	115402	115404	115404	Alicia	149	" My Uncle Robert ? "
115406	115419	115404	115404	Alicia	149	" Oh , yes , I remember him very well , indeed . "
115420	115439	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" Was he eccentric — I mean to say , peculiar in his habits , like your cousin ? "
115440	115492	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" Yes , I believe Robert inherits all his absurdities from his father . My uncle expressed the same indifference for his fellow - creatures as my cousin , but as he was a good husband , an affectionate father , and a kind master , nobody ever challenged his opinions . "
115493	115499	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" But he was eccentric ? "
115500	115513	115309	115309	Alicia	149	" Yes ; I suppose he was generally thought a little eccentric . "
115514	115517	115519	115520	my lady	468	" Ah , "
115524	115596	115519	115520	my lady	468	" I thought as much . Do you know , Alicia , that madness is more often transmitted from father to daughter , and from mother to daughter than from mother to son ? Your cousin , Robert Audley , is a very handsome young man , and I believe , a very good - hearted young man , but he must be watched , Alicia , for he is mad ! "
115597	115600	115602	115603	Miss Audley	149	" Mad ! "
115607	115626	115628	115630	the young lady	5100	" you are dreaming , my lady , or — or — you are trying to frighten me , "
115636	115649	115651	115652	my lady	468	" I only wish to put you on your guard , Alicia , "
115654	115706	115651	115652	my lady	468	" Mr. Audley may be as you say , merely eccentric ; but he has talked to me this evening in a manner that has filled me with absolute terror , and I believe that he is going mad . I shall speak very seriously to Sir Michael this very night . "
115707	115712	115714	115714	Alicia	149	" Speak to papa , "
115716	115729	115714	115714	Alicia	149	" you surely wo n't distress papa by suggesting such a possibility ! "
115730	115744	115651	115652	my lady	468	" I shall only put him on his guard , my dear Alicia . "
115745	115753	115755	115756	Miss Audley	149	" But he 'll never believe you , "
115758	115767	115755	115756	Miss Audley	149	" he will laugh at such an idea . "
115768	115782	115784	115785	my lady	468	" No , Alicia ; he will believe anything that I tell him , "
116036	116042	116043	116043	he	146	" Why , my darling ! "
116061	116088	116043	116043	he	146	" I have been thinking of you and waiting for you for an hour . Where have you been , and what have you been doing ? "
116111	116118	116119	116119	she	468	" I have been to Chelmsford , "
116122	116127	116128	116128	She	468	" shopping ; and — "
116147	116154	116128	116128	She	468	" And what , my dear ? "
116157	116188	116128	116128	She	468	baronet—"what have you been doing since you came from Chelmsford ? I heard a carriage stop at the door an hour ago . It was yours , was it not ? "
116189	116199	116201	116202	my lady	468	" Yes , I came home an hour ago , "
116211	116223	116201	116202	my lady	468	" And what have you been doing since you came home ? "
116288	116302	116303	116303	he	146	" What have you been doing since you came home , my dear ? "
116306	116317	116303	116303	he	146	" What has kept you so long away from me ? "
116318	116331	116332	116332	She	5117	" I have been — talking — to — Mr. Robert Audley . "
116355	116358	116360	116361	the baronet	465	" Robert ! "
116363	116368	116360	116361	the baronet	465	" is Robert here ? "
116369	116378	116303	116303	he	146	" He was here a little while ago . "
116379	116388	116332	116332	She	5117	" And is here still , I suppose ? "
116389	116397	116360	116361	the baronet	465	" No , he has gone away . "
116398	116402	116404	116405	Sir Michael	146	" Gone away ! "
116407	116416	116404	116405	Sir Michael	146	" What do you mean , my darling ? "
116417	116479	116360	116361	the baronet	465	" I mean that your nephew came to the Court this afternoon . Alicia and I found him idling about the gardens . He stayed here till about a quarter of an hour ago talking to me , and then he hurried off without a word of explanation ; except , indeed , some ridiculous excuse about business at Mount Stanning . "
116480	116519	116404	116405	Sir Michael	146	" Business at Mount Stanning ! Why , what business can he possibly have in that out - of - the - way place ? He has gone to sleep at Mount Stanning , then , I suppose ? "
116531	116532	116524	116524	he	3249	" "
116537	116542	116524	116524	he	3249	" exclaimed the baronet , "
116551	116601	116543	116543	I	0	" My lady 's face was so much in shadow , that Sir Michael Audley was unaware of the bright change that came over its sickly pallor as he made this very commonplace observation . A triumphant smile illuminated Lucy Audley 's countenance , a smile that plainly said , "
116639	117162	117163	117163	I	0	" But Sir Michael Audley in declaring that his nephew 's wits were disordered , merely uttered that commonplace ejaculation which is well - known to have very little meaning . The baronet had , it is true , no very great estimate of Robert 's faculty for the business of this everyday life . He was in the habit of looking upon his nephew as a good - natured nonentity — a man whose heart had been amply stocked by liberal Nature with all the best things the generous goddess had to bestow , but whose brain had been somewhat overlooked in the distribution of intellectual gifts . Sir Michael Audley made that mistake which is very commonly made by easy - going , well - to - do - observers , who have no occasion to look below the surface . He mistook laziness for incapacity . He thought because his nephew was idle , he must necessarily be stupid . He concluded that if Robert did not distinguish himself , it was because he could not . He forgot the mute inglorious Miltons , who die voiceless and inarticulate for want of that dogged perseverance , that blind courage , which the poet must possess before he can find a publisher ; he forgot the Cromwells , who see the noble vessels of the state floundering upon a sea of confusion , and going down in a tempest of noisy bewilderment , and who yet are powerless to get at the helm ; forbidden even to send out a life - boat to the sinking ship . Surely it is a mistake to judge of what a man can do by that which he has done . The world 's Valhalla is a close borough , and perhaps the greatest men may be those who perish silently far away from the sacred portal . Perhaps the purest and brightest spirits are those who shrink from the turmoil of the race - course — the tumult and confusion of the struggle . The game of life is something like the game of écarte , and it may be that the very best cards are sometimes left in the pack . My lady threw off her bonnet , and seated herself upon a velvet - covered footstool at Sir Michael 's feet . There was nothing studied or affected in this girlish action . It was so natural to Lucy Audley to be childish , that no one would have wished to see her otherwise . It would have seemed as foolish to expect dignified reserve or womanly gravity from this amber - haired siren , as to wish for rich basses amid the clear treble of a sky - lark 's song . She sat with her pale face turned away from the firelight , and with her hands locked together upon the arm of her husband 's easy - chair . They were very restless , these slender white hands . My lady twisted the jeweled fingers in and out of each other as she talked to her husband . "
117175	117177	117163	117163	I	0	" said she—"I
117200	117201	117189	117190	Mr. Audley	173	" "
117209	117214	117189	117190	Mr. Audley	173	" asked the baronet . "
117224	117293	117217	117217	Robert	173	" My lady did not answer this question . Her fair head dropped upon her husband 's knee , her rippling , yellow curls fell over her face . Sir Michael lifted that beautiful head with his strong hands , and raised my lady 's face . The firelight shining on that pale face lit up the large , soft blue eyes and showed them drowned in tears . "
117298	117303	117296	117296	Lucy	197	" cried the baronet , "
117327	117808	117809	117809	My	0	" Lady Audley tried to speak , but the words died inarticulately upon her trembling lips . A choking sensation in her throat seemed to strangle those false and plausible words , her only armor against her enemies . She could not speak . The agony she had endured silently in the dismal lime - walk had grown too strong for her , and she broke into a tempest of hysterical sobbing . It was no simulated grief that shook her slender frame and tore at her like some ravenous beast that would have rent her piecemeal with its horrible strength . It was a storm of real anguish and terror , of remorse and misery . It was the one wild outcry , in which the woman 's feebler nature got the better of the siren 's art . It was not thus that she had meant to fight her terrible duel with Robert Audley . Those were not the weapons which she had intended to use ; but perhaps no artifice which she could have devised would have served her so well as this one outburst of natural grief . It shook her husband to the very soul . It bewildered and terrified him . It reduced the strong intellect of the man to helpless confusion and perplexity . It struck at the one weak point in a good man 's nature . It appealed straight to Sir Michael Audley 's affection for his wife . Ah , Heaven help a strong man 's tender weakness for the woman he loves ! Heaven pity him when the guilty creature has deceived him and comes with her tears and lamentations to throw herself at his feet in self - abandonment and remorse ; torturing him with the sight of her agony ; rending his heart with her sobs , lacerating his breast with her groans — multiplying her sufferings into a great anguish for him to bear ! multiplying them by twenty - fold ; multiplying them in a ratio of a brave man 's capacity for endurance . Heaven forgive him , if maddened by that cruel agony , the balance wavers for a moment , and he is ready to forgive anything ; ready to take this wretched one to the shelter of his breast , and to pardon that which the stern voice of manly honor urges must not be pardoned . Pity him , pity him ! The wife 's worst remorse when she stands without the threshold of the home she may never enter more is not equal to the agony of the husband who closes the portal on that familiar and entreating face . The anguish of the mother who may never look again upon her children is less than the torment of the father who has to say to those little ones , "
117817	117847	117848	117848	Lucy	197	" Sir Michael Audley rose from his chair , trembling with indignation , and ready to do immediate battle with the person who had caused his wife 's grief . "
117850	117854	117855	117855	Lucy	197	" he said , "
117899	117927	117870	117870	I	0	" He seated himself and bent over the drooping figure at his feet , calming his own agitation in his desire to soothe his wife 's distress . "
117937	118000	117870	117870	I	0	" he whispered , tenderly . The sharp paroxysm had passed away , and my lady looked up . A glittering light shone through the tears in her eyes , and the lines about her pretty rosy mouth , those hard and cruel lines which Robert Audley had observed in the pre - Raphaelite portrait , were plainly visible in the firelight .

118224	118247	118188	118188	Lucy	197	" she said , slowly , hesitating now and then between her words , as if she almost shrunk from uttering them , "

118701	118764	118664	118665	some physicians	3281	" Lady Audley 's eyes were still fixed upon the burning coals in the wide grate . She spoke as if she had been discussing a subject that she had often heard discussed before . She spoke as if her mind had almost wandered away from the thought of her husband 's nephew to the wider question of madness in the abstract . "
118772	118777	118778	118778	People	572	" resumed my lady . "
118911	118955	118904	118904	They	572	" Lady Audley 's voice rose as she argued this dreadful question , The hysterical excitement from which she had only just recovered had left its effects upon her , but she controlled herself , and her tone grew calmer as she resumed : "
118961	118967	118956	118957	Robert Audley	173	" she said , decisively . "
119250	119303	119228	119228	he	173	" My lady paused . The words died away upon her lips . She had exhausted herself by the strange energy with which she had spoken . She had been transformed from a frivolous , childish beauty into a woman , strong to argue her own cause and plead her own defense . "

119460	119465	119422	119422	he	173	" answered the baronet . "
119550	119557	119539	119539	he	173	" My lady shrugged her shoulders . "

119669	119685	119690	119690	Lucy	197	" Sir Michael Audley sank back in his capacious chair with a sigh of resignation . "

120324	120377	120380	120380	you	5809	" My lady rose from the low ottoman on which she had been seated . The fire had burned down , and there was only a faint glow of red light in the room . Lucy Audley bent over her husband 's chair , and put her lips to his broad forehead . "
120389	120394	120380	120380	you	5809	" she whispered softly . "
120411	120412	120407	120407	you	5809	" "
120418	120423	120407	120407	you	5809	" repeated the baronet . "

120437	120442	120432	120432	you	5809	" pursued my lady , "

120486	120491	120474	120474	They	3339	" answered Sir Michael ; "
120505	120528	120529	120529	My	0	" Lady Audley laughed aloud , with a gay , triumphant , silvery peal of laughter that vibrated through the quiet room . "
120534	120538	120529	120529	My	0	" she said , "
120624	120625	120628	120628	dear	5809	" "
120630	120692	120628	120628	dear	5809	" My lady tripped out of the room to give her orders about the message that was to be carried to the house at which she was to have dined . She paused for a moment as she closed the library door — she paused , and laid her hand upon her breast to check the rapid throbbing of her heart . "
120704	120708	120693	120693	I	0	" she thought ; "
120727	121457	120717	120717	you	5809	" The division between Lady Audley and her step - daughter had not become any narrower in the two months which had elapsed since the pleasant Christmas holiday time had been kept at Audley Court . There was no open warfare between the two women ; there was only an armed neutrality , broken every now and then by brief feminine skirmishes and transient wordy tempests . I am sorry to say that Alicia would very much have preferred a hearty pitched battle to this silent and undemonstrative disunion ; but it was not very easy to quarrel with my lady . She had soft answers for the turning away of wrath . She could smile bewitchingly at her step - daughter 's open petulance , and laugh merrily at the young lady 's ill - temper . Perhaps had she been less amiable , had she been more like Alicia in disposition , the two ladies might have expended their enmity in one tremendous quarrel , and might ever afterward have been affectionate and friendly . But Lucy Audley would not make war . She carried forward the sum of her dislike , and put it out at a steady rate of interest , until the breach between her step - daughter and herself , widening a little every day , became a great gulf , utterly impassable by olive - branch - bearing doves from either side of the abyss . There can be no reconciliation where there is no open warfare . There must be a battle , a brave , boisterous battle , with pennants waving and cannon roaring , before there can be peaceful treaties and enthusiastic shaking of hands . Perhaps the union between France and England owes its greatest force to the recollection of Cressy and Waterloo , Navarino and Trafalgar . We have hated each other and licked each other and had it out , as the common phrase goes ; and we can afford now to fall into each others ' arms and vow eternal friendship and everlasting brotherhood . Let us hope that when Northern Yankeedom has decimated and been decimated , blustering Jonathan may fling himself upon his Southern brother 's breast , forgiving and forgiven . Alicia Audley and her father 's pretty wife had plenty of room for the comfortable indulgence of their dislike in the spacious old mansion . My lady had her own apartments , as we know — luxurious chambers , in which all conceivable elegancies had been gathered for the comfort of their occupant . Alicia had her own rooms in another part of the large house . She had her favorite mare , her Newfoundland dog , and her drawing materials , and she made herself tolerably happy . She was not very happy , this frank , generous - hearted girl , for it was scarcely possible that she could be altogether at ease in the constrained atmosphere of the Court . Her father was changed ; that dear father over whom she had once reigned supreme with the boundless authority of a spoiled child , had accepted another ruler and submitted to a new dynasty . Little by little my lady 's petty power made itself felt in that narrow household ; and Alicia saw her father gradually lured across the gulf that divided Lady Audley from her step - daughter , until he stood at last quite upon the other side of the abyss , and looked coldly upon his only child across that widening chasm . Alicia felt that he was lost to her . My lady 's beaming smiles , my lady 's winning words , my lady 's radiant glances and bewitching graces had done their work of enchantment , and Sir Michael had grown to look upon his daughter as a somewhat wilful and capricious young person who had behaved with determined unkindness to the wife he loved . Poor Alicia saw all this , and bore her burden as well as she could . It seemed very hard to be a handsome , gray - eyed heiress , with dogs and horses and servants at her command , and yet to be so much alone in the world as to know of not one friendly ear into which she might pour her sorrows . "
121474	121479	121464	121464	I	0	" thought Miss Audley ; "
121500	121687	121688	121688	I	0	" Sir Michael Audley obeyed his pretty nurse , and went to bed a little after nine o'clock upon this bleak March evening . Perhaps the baronet 's bedroom was about the pleasantést retreat that an invalid could have chosen in such cold and cheerless weather . The dark - green velvet curtains were drawn before the windows and about the ponderous bed . The wood fire burned redly upon the broad hearth . The reading lamp was lighted upon a delicious little table close to Sir Michael 's pillow , and a heap of magazines and newspapers had been arranged by my lady 's own fair hands for the pleasure of the invalid . Lady Audley sat by the bedside for about ten minutes , talking to her husband , talking very seriously , about this strange and awful question — Robert Audley 's lunacy ; but at the end of that time she rose and bade her husband good - night . She lowered the green silk shade before the reading lamp , adjusting it carefully for the repose of the baronet 's eyes . "
121695	121699	121688	121688	I	0	" she said . "
121746	122659	121739	121739	your	3347	" Lady Audley went through her dressing - room into the boudoir , where she had sat with her husband since dinner . Every evidence of womanly refinement was visible in the elegant chamber . My lady 's piano was open , covered with scattered sheets of music and exquisitely - bound collections of scenas and fantasias which no master need have disdained to study . My lady 's easel stood near the window , bearing witness to my lady 's artistic talent , in the shape of a water - colored sketch of the Court and gardens . My lady 's fairy - like embroideries of lace and muslin , rainbow - hued silks , and delicately - tinted wools littered the luxurious apartment ; while the looking - glasses , cunningly placed at angles and opposite corners by an artistic upholsterer , multiplied my lady 's image , and in that image reflected the most beautiful object in the enchanted chamber . Amid all this lamplight , gilding , color , wealth , and beauty , Lucy Audley sat down on a low seat by the fire to think . If Mr. Holman Hunt could have peeped into the pretty boudoir , I think the picture would have been photographed upon his brain to be reproduced by - and - by upon a bishop 's half - length for the glorification of the pre - Raphaelite brotherhood . My lady in that half - recumbent attitude , with her elbow resting on one knee , and her perfect chin supported by her hand , the rich folds of drapery falling away in long undulating lines from the exquisite outline of her figure , and the luminous , rose - colored firelight enveloping her in a soft haze , only broken by the golden glitter of her yellow hair — beautiful in herself , but made bewilderingly beautiful by the gorgeous surroundings which adorn the shrine of her loveliness . Drinking - cups of gold and ivory , chiseled by Benvenuto Cellini ; cabinets of buhl and porcelain , bearing the cipher of Austrian Marie - Antoinette , amid devices of rosebuds and true - lovers ' knots , birds and butterflies , cupidons and shepherdesses , goddesses , courtiers , cottagers , and milkmaids ; statuettes of Parian marble and biscuit china ; gilded baskets of hothouse flowers ; fantastical caskets of Indian filigree - work ; fragile tea - cups of turquoise china , adorned by medallion miniatures of Louis the Great and Louis the Well - beloved , Louise de la Valliere , Athenais de Montespan , and Marie Jeanne Gomard de Vaubernier : cabinet pictures and gilded mirrors , shimmering satin and diaphanous lace ; all that gold can buy or art devise had been gathered together for the beautification of this quiet chamber in which my lady sat listening to the mourning of the shrill March wind , and the flapping of the ivy leaves against the casements , and looking into the red chasms in the burning coals . I should be preaching a very stale sermon , and harping upon a very familiar moral , if I were to seize this opportunity of declaiming against art and beauty , because my lady was more wretched in this elegant apartment than many a half - starved seamstress in her dreary garret . She was wretched by reason of a wound which lay too deep for the possibility of any solace from such plasters as wealth and luxury ; but her wretchedness was of an abnormal nature , and I can see no occasion for seizing upon the fact of her misery as an argument in favor of poverty and discomfort as opposed to opulence . The Benvenuto Cellini carvings and the Sevres porcelain could not give her happiness , because she had passed out of their region . She was no longer innocent ; and the pleasure we take in art and loveliness being an innocent pleasure , had passed beyond her reach . Six or seven years before , she would have been happy in the possession of this little Aladdin 's palace ; but she had wandered out of the circle of careless , pleasure seeking creatures , she had strayed far away into a desolate labyrinth of guilt and treachery , terror and crime , and all the treasures that had been collected for her could have given her no pleasure but one , the pleasure of flinging them into a heap beneath her feet and trampling upon them and destroying them in her cruel despair . There were some things that would have inspired her with an awful joy , a horrible rejoicing . If Robert Audley , her pitiless enemy , her unrelenting pursuer , had lain dead in the adjoining chamber , she would have exulted over his bier . What pleasures could have remained for Lucretia Borgia and Catharine de Medici , when the dreadful boundary line between innocence and guilt was passed , and the lost creatures stood upon the lonely outer side ? Only horrible , vengeful joys , and treacherous delights were left for these miserable women . With what disdainful bitterness they must have watched the frivolous vanities , the petty deceptions , the paltry sins of ordinary offenders . Perhaps they took a horrible pride in the enormity of their wickedness ; in this "
122664	122977	121739	121739	your	3347	" which made them greatest among sinful creatures . My lady , brooding by the fire in her lonely chamber , with her large , clear blue eyes fixed upon the yawning gulfs of lurid crimson in the burning coals , may have thought of many things very far away from the terribly silent struggle in which she was engaged . She may have thought of long - ago years of childish innocence , childish follies and selfishness , of frivolous , feminine sins that had weighed very lightly upon her conscience . Perhaps in that retrospective revery she recalled that early time in which she had first looked in the glass and discovered that she was beautiful ; that fatal early time in which she had first begun to look upon her loveliness as a right divine , a boundless possession which was to be a set - off against all girlish shortcomings , a counterbalance of every youthful sin . Did she remember the day in which that fairy dower of beauty had first taught her to be selfish and cruel , indifferent to the joys and sorrows of others , cold - hearted and capricious , greedy of admiration , exacting and tyrannical with that petty woman 's tyranny which is the worst of despotism ? Did she trace every sin of her life back to its true source ? and did she discover that poisoned fountain in her own exaggerated estimate of the value of a pretty face ? Surely , if her thoughts wandered so far along the backward current of her life , she must have repented in bitterness and despair of that first day in which the master - passions of her life had become her rulers , and the three demons of Vanity , Selfishness , and Ambition , had joined hands and said , "
122995	123152	123153	123153	I	0	" How small those first youthful errors seemed as my lady looked back upon them in that long revery by the lonely hearth ! What small vanities , what petty cruelties ! A triumph over a schoolfellow ; a flirtation with the lover of a friend ; an assertion of the right divine invested in blue eyes and shimmering golden - tinted hair . But how terribly that narrow pathway had widened out into the broad highroad of sin , and how swift the footsteps had become upon the now familiar way ! My lady twisted her fingers in her loose amber curls , and made as if she would have torn them from her head . But even in that moment of mute despair the unyielding dominion of beauty asserted itself , and she released the poor tangled glitter of ringlets , leaving them to make a halo round her head in the dim firelight . "
123162	123174	123153	123153	I	0	" she thought , as she stared gloomingly at the fire , "
123201	123205	123198	123198	I	0	" she mused . "
123278	123318	123319	123319	You	0	" Her thoughts wandered away into a weary maze of confusion . Suddenly she drew herself up with a proud , defiant gesture , and her eyes glittered with a light that was not entirely reflected from the fire . "
123327	123331	123332	123332	you	0	" she said , "
123366	123397	123359	123359	I	0	" She put her hand to her head , as if thinking of something which confused and bewildered her , and which she found it difficult to contemplate with calmness . "
123403	123407	123399	123399	I	0	" she muttered . "
123465	123504	123436	123436	he	173	" She pronounced the last words in an awful whisper ; and with her head bent forward , her eyes dilated , and her lips still parted as they had been parted in her utterance of that final word "
123507	123516	123436	123436	he	173	" she sat blankly staring at the fire . "
123524	123530	123517	123517	I	0	" she muttered , presently ; "
123562	123709	123560	123560	I	0	" The current of her thoughts was interrupted by a cautious knocking at her door . She rose suddenly , startled by any sound in the stillness of her room . She rose , and threw herself into a low chair near the fire . She flung her beautiful head back upon the soft cushions , and took a book from the table near her . Insignificant as this action was , it spoke very plainly . It spoke very plainly of ever - recurring fears — of fatal necessities for concealment — of a mind that in its silent agonies was ever alive to the importance of outward effect . It told more plainly than anything else could have told how complete an actress my lady had been made by the awful necessity of her life . The modest rap at the door was repeated . "
123713	123803	123560	123560	I	0	" cried Lady Audley , in her liveliest tone . The door was opened with that respectful noiselessness peculiar to a well - bred servant , and a young woman , plainly dressed , and carrying some of the cold March winds in the folds of her garments , crossed the threshold of the apartment and lingered near the door , waiting permission to approach the inner regions of my lady 's retreat . It was Phoebe Marks , the pale - faced wife of the Mount Stanning innkeeper . "
123816	123820	123804	123804	I	0	" she said ; "
123836	123837	123842	123842	Phoebe	166	" "
123867	123919	123842	123842	Phoebe	166	" Lady Audley pointed to the low ottoman upon which she had herself been seated a few minutes before . The lady 's maid had often sat upon it listening to her mistress ' prattle in the old days , when she had been my lady 's chief companion and confidante . "
123926	123931	123842	123842	Phoebe	166	" Lady Audley repeated ; "
123960	124247	123951	123951	I	0	" My lady shivered and looked round at the bright collection of bric - a - brac , as if the Sevres and bronze , the buhl and ormolu , had been the moldering adornments of some ruined castle . The dreary wretchedness of her thoughts had communicated itself to every object about her , and all outer things took their color from that weary inner life which held its slow course of secret anguish in her breast . She had spoken the entire truth in saying that she was glad of her lady 's maid 's visit . Her frivolous nature clung to this weak shelter in the hour of her fear and suffering . There were sympathies between her and this girl , who was like herself , inwardly as well as outwardly — like herself , selfish , and cold , and cruel , eager for her own advancement , and greedy of opulence and elegance ; angry with the lot that had been cast her , and weary of dull dependence . My lady hated Alicia for her frank , passionate , generous , daring nature ; she hated her step - daughter , and clung to this pale - faced , pale - haired girl , whom she thought neither better nor worse than herself . Phoebe Marks obeyed her late mistress ' commands , and took off her bonnet before seating herself on the ottoman at Lady Audley 's feet . Her smooth bands of light hair were unruffled by the March winds ; her trimly - made drab dress and linen collar were as neatly arranged as they could have been had she only that moment completed her toilet . "
124259	124263	124248	124249	Sir Michael	146	" she said . "
124281	124319	124275	124275	You	166	" added Lady Audley , with a motion of her head toward the door of communication between the rooms , which had been left open . Mrs. Marks obeyed submissively , and then returned to her seat . "
124329	124336	124327	124327	Phoebe	166	" my lady said , fretfully ; "
124340	124341	124327	124327	Phoebe	166	" "
124347	124417	124327	124327	Phoebe	166	" asked Mrs. Marks , in a half whisper . My lady did not notice that question . She resumed in the same complaining tone . She was glad to be able to complain even to this lady 's maid . She had brooded over her fears , and had suffered in secret so long , that it was an inexpressible relief to her to bemoan her fate aloud . "
124428	124432	124425	124426	Phoebe Marks	166	" she said . "
124467	124551	124552	124552	I	0	" She paused , staring at the fire again , as she had done in her loneliness . Lost again in the dark intricacies of thoughts which wandered hither and thither in a dreadful chaos of terrified bewilderments , she could not come to any fixed conclusion . Phoebe Marks watched my lady 's face , looking upward at her late mistress with pale , anxious eyes , that only relaxed their watchfulness when Lady Audley 's glance met that of her companion . "
124563	124574	124554	124554	I	0	" said the innkeeper 's wife , after a pause ; "
124589	124590	124577	124577	I	0	" "
124596	124603	124577	124577	I	0	" answered my lady , bitterly ; "
124620	124621	124611	124611	You	0	" "
124635	124636	124625	124626	a gentleman	4644	" "
124639	124640	124625	124626	a gentleman	4644	" "
124658	124659	124654	124654	I	0	" "
124664	124671	124654	124654	I	0	" answered my lady , impatiently . "
124690	124773	124676	124678	The same gentleman	3372	" Lady Audley started up from her chair — started up as if she would have done something desperate in her despairing fury ; but she sank back again with a weary , querulous sigh . What warfare could such a feeble creature wage against her fate ? What could she do but wind like a hunted hare till she found her way back to the starting - point of the cruel chase , to be there trampled down by her pursuers ? "
124779	124783	124676	124678	The same gentleman	3372	" she cried . "
124805	124820	124822	124822	you	0	" she exclaimed , suddenly turning upon Phoebe Marks in a transport of anger , "
124836	124844	124822	124822	you	0	" Mrs. Marks clasped her hands piteously . "
124859	124863	124845	124845	I	0	" she said ; "
124886	124887	124881	124881	I	0	" "
124893	124894	124895	124895	Luke	167	" "
124917	124918	124900	124900	You	468	" "
124925	124949	124921	124921	he	167	" The innkeeper 's wife dropped her eyelids under Lady Audley 's angry glances , and hesitated confusedly before she answered this question . "
124955	124959	124921	124921	he	167	" she stammered , "
125022	125023	125017	125017	he	167	" "
125028	125035	125017	125017	he	167	" cried Lady Audley , impatiently . "
125049	125050	125040	125040	I	0	" "
125059	125066	125067	125067	Luke	167	" answered Phoebe , half reluctantly , "
125180	125181	125165	125165	You	468	" "
125189	125199	125184	125184	I	0	" answered Lady Audley , with a bitter laugh , "
125211	125212	125215	125215	you	468	" "
125321	125322	125329	125329	I	0	" "
125332	125337	125329	125329	I	0	" cried Lucy Audley . "
125346	125347	125338	125338	I	0	" "
125362	125367	125355	125355	I	0	" sobbed Phoebe Marks , "
125374	125375	125369	125369	he	167	" "
125378	125385	125386	125386	he	167	" answered my lady , bitterly , "
125586	125587	125581	125581	I	0	" "
125596	125602	125593	125594	my lady	468	" cried Phoebe , piteously , "
125628	125629	125620	125620	I	0	" "
125634	125639	125630	125630	I	0	" exclaimed Lady Audley , "
125654	125668	125651	125651	me	0	" she cried , silencing Phoebe 's consolatory murmurs with an imperious gesture . "
125687	125720	125721	125722	Robert Audley	173	" She put her hands to her forehead , clasping her slender fingers across her brow , as if she would have controlled the action of her brain by their convulsive pressure . "
125728	125743	125721	125722	Robert Audley	173	" she said , slowly , speaking to herself rather than to her companion . "
125811	125812	125815	125815	you	468	" "
125820	125826	125815	125815	you	468	" said Phoebe , earnestly , "
125852	125853	125829	125829	you	468	" "
125856	125876	125829	125829	you	468	" asked Lady Audley , letting her hands fall on her lap , and looking inquiringly at Mrs. Marks . "
125886	125887	125878	125878	I	0	" "
125897	125898	125891	125891	you	0	" "
125910	125914	125891	125891	you	0	" answered Phoebe . "
126037	126038	126025	126025	We	3417	" "
126042	126047	126050	126050	you	468	" repeated Lady Audley . "
126053	126054	126050	126050	you	468	" "
126072	126073	126079	126079	his	167	" "
126088	126127	126128	126128	You	468	" asked my lady , rather listlessly . She was too selfish , and too deeply absorbed in her own troubles to take much interest in any danger which had befallen her some - time lady's - maid . "
126356	126477	126346	126346	I	0	" My lady had not wondered , she had not thought about the business at all . She had scarcely listened to these commonplace details ; why should she care for this low - born waiting - woman 's perils and troubles ? Had she not her own terrors , her own soul - absorbing perplexities to usurp every thought of which her brain was capable ? She did not make any remark upon that which poor Phoebe just told her ; she scarcely comprehended what had been said , until some moments after the girl had finished speaking , when the words assumed their full meaning , as some words do after they have been heard without being heeded . "
126483	126492	126346	126346	I	0	" said the young lady , at last . "
126521	126635	126636	126636	I	0	" A vivid picture had flashed upon her as she spoke . The picture of that frail wooden tenement , the Castle Inn , reduced to a roofless chaos of lath and plaster , vomiting flames from its black mouth , and spitting blazing sparks upward toward the cold night sky . She gave a weary sigh as she dismissed this image from her restless brain . She would be no better off even if this enemy should be for ever silenced . She had another and far more dangerous foe — a foe who was not to be bribed or bought off , though she had been as rich as an empress . "
126648	126657	126658	126658	I	0	" my lady said , after a pause . "
126688	126703	126674	126674	you	3432	" Lady Audley rose and took the lighted lamp from her writing - table . "
126713	126717	126674	126674	you	3432	" she said ; "
126725	126726	126729	126730	my lady	468	" "
126732	126738	126729	126730	my lady	468	" exclaimed Phoebe , suddenly , "
126758	126759	126753	126753	I	0	" "
126764	126765	126753	126753	I	0	" "
126786	126787	126799	126799	He	173	" "
126791	126792	126799	126799	He	173	" "
126820	126861	126812	126812	he	173	" Lady Audley set the lamp down upon the table nearest to her , and held out her hand to receive the letter . Phoebe Marks could scarcely fail to observe that the little jeweled hand shook like a leaf . "
126870	126874	126812	126812	he	173	" she cried ; "
126885	126939	126880	126880	he	173	" Lady Audley almost snatched the letter from Phoebe 's hand in her wild impatience . She tore open the envelope and flung it from her ; she could scarcely unfold the sheet of note - paper in her eager excitement . The letter was very brief . It contained only these words : "
127039	127043	127005	127006	Mrs. Barkamb	287	" ROBERT AUDLEY . "
127049	127057	127005	127006	Mrs. Barkamb	287	" The Castle Inn , Mount Stanning . "
127077	127091	127092	127092	she	468	" If he stood before me now , and I could kill him , "
127101	127112	127092	127092	she	468	" I would do it — I would do it ! "
127347	127360	127361	127361	she	150	" If they make him believe , how wretched he will be , "
127627	127633	127634	127634	she	150	" He will do it , "
127640	127659	127634	127634	she	150	teeth—"he will do it , unless I get him into a lunatic - asylum first ; or unless — "
127701	127720	127634	127634	she	150	" He will do it , unless some strange calamity befalls him , and silences him for ever . "
128256	128260	128261	128261	she	150	" My lady , "
128264	128274	128261	128261	she	150	" you are not going out to - night ? "
128275	128283	128284	128285	Lady Audley	150	" Yes , I am , Phoebe , "
128291	128313	128284	128285	Lady Audley	150	" I am going to Mount Stanning with you to see this bailiff , and to pay and dismiss him myself . "
128314	128337	128338	128339	Lady Audley	150	" But , my lady , you forget what the time is ; you ca n't go out at such an hour . "
128361	128377	128378	128378	she	150	" The stables are always locked , and the men in bed by ten o'clock , "
128381	128417	128378	128378	she	150	" when we are at home . It will make a terrible hubbub to get a carriage ready ; but yet I dare say one of the servants could manage the matter quietly for me . "
128418	128431	128433	128434	Phoebe Marks	166	" But why should you go to - night , my lady ? "
128436	128471	128433	128434	Phoebe Marks	166	" To - morrow will do quite as well . A week hence will do as well . Our landlord would take the man away if he had your promise to settle the debt . "
128522	128532	128533	128533	she	150	" Now , Phoebe Marks , listen to me , "
128564	128571	128572	128572	she	150	" Listen to me , Phoebe , "
128575	128701	128572	128572	she	150	" I am going to the Castle Inn to - night ; whether it is early or late is of very little consequence to me ; I have set my mind upon going , and I shall go . You have asked me why , and I have told you . I am going in order that I may pay this debt myself ; and that I may see for myself that the money I give is applied to the purpose for which I give it . There is nothing out of the common course of life in my doing this . I am going to do what other women in my position very often do . I am going to assist a favorite servant . "
128702	128715	128717	128717	Phoebe	166	" But it 's getting on for twelve o'clock , my lady , "
128727	128742	128743	128743	she	150	" If my going to your house to pay this man should be known , "
128755	128802	128743	128743	she	150	" I am ready to answer for my conduct ; but I would rather that the business should be kept quiet . I think that I can leave this house without being seen by any living creature , if you will do as I tell you . "
128803	128814	128816	128816	Phoebe	166	" I will do anything you wish , my lady , "
128820	128919	128816	128816	Phoebe	166	" Then you will wish me good - night presently , when my maid comes into the room , and you will suffer her to show you out of the house . You will cross the courtyard and wait for me in the avenue upon the other side of the archway . It may be half an hour before I am able to join you , for I must not leave my room till the servants have all gone to bed , but you may wait for me patiently , for come what may I will join you . "
129043	129056	129058	129059	my lady	468	" I did not know that it was so late , Martin , "
129077	129112	129058	129059	my lady	468	" I have been talking with Mrs. Marks and have let the time slip by me . I sha'n't want anything to - night , so you may go to bed when you please . "
129113	129120	129122	129123	the girl	753	" Thank you , my lady , "
129155	129171	129173	129174	the maid	5227	" I 'd better show Mrs. Marks out , my lady , had n't I ? "
129176	129183	129173	129174	the maid	5227	" before I go to bed ? "
129184	129213	129225	129225	she	150	" Oh , yes , to be sure ; you can let Phoebe out . All the other servants have gone to bed , then , I suppose ? "
129214	129220	129225	129225	she	150	" Yes , my lady . "
129231	129242	129243	129243	she	150	" We have been terrible dissipated up here , Phoebe , "
129246	129263	129225	129225	she	150	" Good - night . You may tell your husband that his rent shall be paid . "
129264	129278	129280	129280	Phoebe	166	" Thank you very much , my lady , and good - night , "
129323	129333	129334	129334	she	150	" Martin sleeps at the top of the house , "
129337	129356	129334	129334	she	150	" half a mile away from this room . In ten minutes I may safely make my escape . "
129554	129561	129562	129562	she	150	" I will wait ten minutes , "
129565	129579	129562	129562	she	150	" not a moment beyond , before I enter on my new peril . "
130123	130135	130136	130136	she	468	" How glad she will be if any disgrace befalls me , "
130139	130153	130136	130136	she	468	" how she will rejoice if I am driven out of this house ! "
130231	130235	130236	130237	my lady	468	" No matter , "
130240	130273	130274	130274	She	150	" I could not have left it burning . I shall know how to find my way through the house when I come back . I have left all the doors ajar . "
130406	130416	130417	130417	she	150	" I feel as if I were running away , "
130420	130589	130417	130417	she	150	" I feel as if I were running away secretly in the dead of the night , to lose myself and be forgotten . Perhaps it would be wiser in me to run away , to take this man 's warning , and escape out of his power forever . If I were to run away and disappear as — as George Talboys disappeared . But where could I go ? what would become of me ? I have no money ; my jewels are not worth a couple of hundred pounds , now that I have got rid of the best part of them . What could I do ? I must go back to the old life , the old , hard , cruel , wretched life — the life of poverty , and humiliation , and vexation , and discontent . I should have to go back and wear myself out in that long struggle , and die — as my mother died , perhaps ! "
130671	130678	130679	130679	she	468	" No ! Mr. Robert Audley , "
130691	130727	130679	130679	she	468	" I will not go back — I will not go back . If the struggle between us is to be a duel to the death , you shall not find me drop my weapon . "
130812	130817	130818	130818	she	468	" Now , Phoebe , "
130821	130836	130818	130818	she	468	" it is three miles from here to Mount Stanning , is n't it ? "
130837	130843	130859	130860	Lady Audley	150	" Yes , my lady . "
130844	130858	130859	130860	Lady Audley	150	" Then we can walk the distance in an hour and a half . "
130934	130949	130950	130950	she	150	" Your beautiful husband will sit up for you , I suppose , Phoebe ? "
130976	131003	130950	130950	she	150	" Oh , yes , my lady ; he 's sure to sit up . He 'll be drinking with the man , I dare say . "
131004	131011	130950	130950	she	150	" The man ! What man ? "
131012	131023	130950	130950	she	150	" The man that 's in possession , my lady . "
131024	131031	131033	131034	Lady Audley	150	" Ah , to be sure , "
131207	131217	131219	131220	my lady	468	" He has not gone to bed , Phoebe , "
131224	131246	131219	131220	my lady	468	" But there is no other light burning at the inn . I suppose Mr. Audley is in bed and asleep . "
131247	131257	131219	131220	my lady	468	" Yes , my lady , I suppose so . "
131258	131273	131219	131220	my lady	468	" You are sure he was going to stay at the Castle to night ? "
131274	131296	131219	131220	my lady	468	" Oh , yes , my lady . I helped the girl to get his room ready before I came away . "
131552	131564	131566	131566	Phoebe	166	" I 'll tell him you 're here , my lady , "
131572	131610	131566	131566	Phoebe	166	" I know he 'll be tipsy . You — you wo n't be offended , my lady , if he should say anything rude ? You know it was n't my wish that you should come . "
131611	131616	131618	131619	Lady Audley	150	" Yes , yes , "
131623	131643	131618	131619	Lady Audley	150	" I know that . What should I care for his rudeness ! Let him say what he likes . "
131752	131765	131766	131766	he	167	" So you 've condescended to come home at last , ma'am , "
131769	131779	131766	131766	he	167	" I thought you was never coming no more . "
131879	131893	131894	131894	Phoebe	166	" I — I've been longer than I intended to be , Luke , "
131903	131929	131898	131898	her	166	" but I 've seen my lady , and she 's been very kind , and — and she 'll settle this business for us . "
131930	131940	131942	131943	Mr. Marks	167	" She 's been very kind , has she ? "
131950	131981	131942	131943	Mr. Marks	167	" thank her for nothing . I know the vally of her kindness . She 'd be oncommon kind , I dessay , if she warn't obligated to be it . "
132072	132086	132087	132087	Phoebe	166	" My lady has promised to settle the business for us , Luke , "
132138	132145	132146	132146	she	166	" My lady will settle it , "
132149	132164	132165	132165	she	166	" and she 's come down here to see about it to - night , "
132187	132197	132198	132198	he	469	" My Lady Audley come here to - night ! "
132201	132206	132198	132198	he	469	" Yes , Luke . "
132220	132226	132227	132227	she	468	" Yes , Luke Marks , "
132230	132247	132227	132227	she	468	" I have come to pay this man , and to send him about his business . "
132305	132315	132316	132316	he	167	" You might have given the money to Phoebe , "
132319	132349	132316	132316	he	167	" as well as have brought it yourself . We do n't want no fine ladies up here , pryin ' and pokin ' their precious noses into everythink . "
132350	132355	132357	132357	Phoebe	166	" Luke , Luke ! "
132359	132368	132357	132357	Phoebe	166	" when my lady has been so kind ! "
132369	132376	132378	132379	Mr. Marks	167	" Oh , damn her kindness ! "
132381	132433	132378	132379	Mr. Marks	167	" it ai n't her kindness as we want , gal , it 's her money . She wo n't get no snivelin ' gratitood from me . Whatever she does for us she does because she is obliged ; and if she was n't obliged she would n't do it — "
132528	132531	132532	132532	she	468	" Stop , "
132535	132559	132532	132532	she	468	" I did n't come up here in the dead of night to listen to your insolence . How much is this debt ? "
132560	132564	132581	132581	she	150	" Nine pound . "
132598	132610	132611	132611	she	150	" Let that man give me a receipt for the money , "
132614	132619	132611	132611	she	150	" before I go . "
132712	132723	132724	132724	she	166	" You must n't go home alone , my lady , "
132727	132736	132724	132724	she	166	" You 'll let me go with you ? "
132737	132749	132750	132752	The two women	1218	" Yes , yes ; you shall go home with me . "
132866	132877	132878	132878	she	150	" I think I am going to faint , Phoebe , "
132881	132890	132878	132878	she	150	" where can I get some cold water ? "
132891	132916	132855	132855	She	150	" The pump is in the wash - house , my lady ; I 'll run and get you a glass of cold water . "
132917	132924	132926	132927	my lady	468	" No , no , no , "
132944	132978	132926	132927	my lady	468	" I 'll get it myself . I must dip my head in a basin of water if I want to save myself from fainting . In which room does Mr. Audley sleep ? "
133000	133023	133024	133024	she	166	" It was number three that I got ready , my lady — the front room — the room next to ours , "
133033	133039	133041	133042	my lady	468	" Give me a candle , "
133044	133080	133081	133081	She	468	" I 'll go into your room , and get some water for my head ; stay where you are , and see that that brute of a husband of yours does not follow me ! "
133795	133802	133803	133803	she	166	" The light , my lady , "
133806	133815	133803	133803	she	166	" you have left it up - stairs ! "
133816	133829	133830	133831	Lady Audley	150	" The wind blew it out as I was leaving your room , "
133836	133842	133830	133831	Lady Audley	150	" I left it there . "
133843	133851	133803	133803	she	166	" In my room , my lady ? "
133852	133855	133803	133803	she	166	" Yes . "
133856	133863	133830	133831	Lady Audley	150	" And it was quite out ? "
133864	133888	133889	133889	She	166	" Yes , I tell you ; why do you worry me about your candle ? It is past two o'clock . Come . "
134324	134331	134333	134333	Phoebe	166	" My lady , my lady ! "
134341	134346	134333	134333	Phoebe	166	" do you see ? "
134347	134355	134357	134358	Lady Audley	150	" Yes , child , I see , "
134370	134376	134357	134358	Lady Audley	150	" What 's the matter ? "
134377	134389	134333	134333	Phoebe	166	" It 's a fire — a fire , my lady ! "
134390	134419	134333	134333	Phoebe	166	" Yes , I am afraid it is a fire . At Brentwood , most likely . Let me go , Phoebe ; it 's nothing to us . "
134420	134443	134444	134445	Lady Audley	150	" Yes , yes , my lady ; it 's nearer than Brentwood — much nearer ; it 's at Mount Stanning . "
134483	134493	134495	134496	Phoebe Marks	166	" It 's at Mount Stanning , my lady ! "
134498	134567	134569	134570	the girl	753	" It 's the Castle that 's on fire — I know it is , I know it is ! I thought of fire to - night , and I was fidgety and uneasy , for I knew this would happen some day . I would n't mind if it was only the wretched place , but there 'll be life lost , there 'll be life lost ! "
134574	134596	134569	134570	the girl	753	" There 's Luke , too tipsy to help himself , unless others help him ; there 's Mr. Audley asleep — "
134627	134633	134634	134634	she	166	" Oh , my God ! "
134637	134668	134634	134634	she	166	" Say it 's not true , my lady , say it 's not true ! It 's too horrible , it 's too horrible , it 's too horrible ! "
134669	134675	134722	134724	the kneeling woman	3665	" What 's too horrible ? "
134676	134694	134634	134634	she	166	" The thought that 's in my mind ; the terrible thought that 's in my mind . "
134695	134703	134705	134706	my lady	468	" What do you mean , girl ? "
134710	134721	134722	134724	the kneeling woman	3665	" Oh , God forgive me if I 'm wrong ! "
134730	134855	134722	134724	the kneeling woman	3665	" and God grant I may be . Why did you go up to the Castle , my lady ? Why were you so set on going against all I could say — you who are so bitter against Mr. Audley and against Luke , and who knew they were both under that roof ? Oh , tell me that I do you a cruel wrong , my lady ; tell me so — tell me ! for as there is a Heaven above me I think that you went to that place to - night on purpose to set fire to it . Tell me that I 'm wrong , my lady ; tell me that I 'm doing you a wicked wrong . "
134856	134871	134873	134874	Lady Audley	150	" I will tell you nothing , except that you are a mad woman , "
134883	135047	134873	134874	Lady Audley	150	" Get up ; fool , idiot , coward ! Is your husband such a precious bargain that you should be groveling there , lamenting and groaning for him ? What is Robert Audley to you , that you behave like a maniac , because you think he is in danger ? How do you know the fire is at Mount Stanning ? You see a red patch in the sky , and you cry out directly that your own paltry hovel is in flames , as if there were no place in the world that could burn except that . The fire may be at Brentwood , or further away — at Romford , or still further away , on the eastern side of London , perhaps . Get up , mad woman , and go back and look after your goods and chattels , and your husband and your lodger . Get up and go : I do n't want you . "
135048	135060	135062	135062	Phoebe	166	" Oh ! my lady , my lady , forgive me , "
135064	135108	135062	135062	Phoebe	166	" there 's nothing you can say to me that 's hard enough for having done you such a wrong , even in my thoughts . I do n't mind your cruel words — I do n't mind anything if I 'm wrong . "
135109	135117	135119	135120	Lady Audley	150	" Go back and see for yourself , "
135124	135136	135137	135137	She	150	" I tell you again , I do n't want you . "
135408	135415	135416	135416	she	149	" No riding to - day , "
135419	135443	135416	135416	she	149	" and no chance of any callers to enliven us , unless that ridiculous Bob comes crawling through the wet from Mount Stanning . "
135617	135631	135632	135634	the young lady	5100	" Yes , he will come down here in the wet , perhaps , "
135637	135752	135632	135634	the young lady	5100	" with his hat sleek and shining as if it had been brushed with a pat of fresh butter , and with white vapors steaming out of his clothes , and making him look like an awkward genie just let out of his bottle . He will come down here and print impressions of his muddy boots all over the carpet , and he 'll sit on your Gobelin tapestry , my lady , in his wet overcoat ; and he 'll abuse you if you remonstrate , and will ask why people have chairs that are not to be sat upon , and why you do n't live in Figtree Court , and — "
135826	135843	135844	135845	Sir Michael	146	" What do you think Major Melville told me when he called here yesterday , Alicia ? "
135850	135858	135860	135860	Alicia	149	" I have n't the remotest idea , "
135865	136010	135860	135860	Alicia	149	" Perhaps he told you that we should have another war before long , by Ged , sir ; or perhaps he told you that we should have a new ministry , by Ged , sir , for that those fellows are getting themselves into a mess , sir ; or that those other fellows were reforming this , and cutting down that , and altering the other in the army , until , by Ged , sir , we shall have no army at all , by - and - by — nothing but a pack of boys , sir , crammed up to the eyes with a lot of senseless schoolmasters ' rubbish , and dressed in shell - jackets and calico helmets . Yes , sir , they 're fighting in Oudh in calico helmets at this very day , sir . "
136011	136020	136022	136023	the baronet	465	" You 're an impertinent minx , miss , "
136025	136077	136022	136023	the baronet	465	" Major Melville told me nothing of the kind ; but he told me that a very devoted admirer of you , a certain Sir Harry Towers , has forsaken his place in Hertfordshire , and his hunting stable , and has gone on the continent for a twelvemonths ' tour . "
136097	136108	136109	136109	she	149	" He has gone on the continent , has he ? "
136113	136166	136109	136109	she	149	" He told me that he meant to do so — if — if he did n't have everything his own way . Poor fellow ! he 's a dear , good - hearted , stupid creature , and twenty times better than that peripatetic , patent refrigerator , Mr. Robert Audley . "
136167	136182	136183	136184	Sir Michael	146	" I wish , Alicia , you were not so fond of ridiculing Bob , "
136189	136260	136183	136184	Sir Michael	146	" Bob is a good fellow , and I 'm as fond of him as if he 'd been my own son ; and — and — I've been very uncomfortable about him lately . He has changed very much within the last few days , and he has taken all sorts of absurd ideas into his head , and my lady has alarmed me about him . She thinks — "
136274	136289	136290	136290	she	150	" It is better not to say too much about it as yet awhile , "
136293	136300	136290	136290	she	150	" Alicia knows what I think . "
136301	136304	136306	136307	Miss Audley	149	" Yes , "
136309	136406	136306	136307	Miss Audley	149	" my lady thinks that Bob is going mad , but I know better than that . He 's not at all the sort of person to go mad . How should such a sluggish ditch - pond of an intellect as his ever work itself into a tempest ? He may move about for the rest of his life , perhaps , in a tranquil state of semi - idiotcy , imperfectly comprehending who he is , and where he 's going , and what he 's doing — but he 'll never go mad . "
137857	137866	137867	137867	he	667	" If the poor little girl loves me , "
137870	137963	137867	137867	he	667	" and if she thinks that I love her , and has been led to think so by any word or act of mine , I 'm in duty bound to let her think so to the end of time , and to fulfill any tacit promise which I may have unconsciously made . I thought once — I meant once to — to make her an offer by - and - by when this horrible mystery about George Talboys should have been cleared up and everything peacefully settled — but now — "
138055	138060	138061	138061	he	667	" Poor little girl ! "
138070	138268	138061	138061	he	667	" How good it is of her to love me , and how grateful ought I to be for her tenderness . How many fellows would think such a generous , loving heart the highest boon that earth could give them . There 's Sir Harry Towers stricken with despair at his rejection . He would give me half his estate , all his estate , twice his estate , if he had it , to be in the shoes which I am anxious to shake off my ungrateful feet . Why do n't I love her ? Why is it that although I know her to be pretty , and pure , and good , and truthful , I do n't love her ? Her image never haunts me , except reproachfully . I never see her in my dreams . I never wake up suddenly in the dead of the night with her eyes shining upon me and her warm breath upon my cheek , or with the fingers of her soft hand clinging to mine . No , I 'm not in love with her , I ca n't fall in love with her . "
138532	138537	138538	138538	She	468	" opium — poison . "
138577	138582	138583	138583	she	468	" If I could ! "
138586	138601	138583	138583	she	468	" if I could only do it ! And yet why should I now ? "
138704	138711	138712	138712	she	468	" How slow the time is , "
138717	138745	138712	138712	she	468	" how slow , how slow ! Shall I grow old like this , I wonder , with every minute of my life seeming like an hour ? "
138940	138948	138949	138949	she	150	" My head aches terribly , Martin , "
138952	138973	138949	138949	she	150	" I shall go and lie down till dinner - time . You may come at five to dress me . "
139598	139610	139611	139612	my lady	468	" Perhaps I shall be always dreaming these sort of dreams , "
139615	139624	139611	139612	my lady	468	" until the terror of them kills me ! "
139842	139854	139855	139856	Lady Audley	150	" Will you take a walk with me in the quadrangle ? "
139881	139891	139892	139892	Alicia	149	" Yes , if you please , my lady , "
139898	139922	139892	139892	Alicia	149	" I have been yawning over a stupid novel all the morning , and shall be very glad of a little fresh air . "
140555	140564	140566	140566	Alicia	149	" What a long day it has been ! "
140580	140608	140609	140611	the young lady	5100	" nothing but drizzle and mist and wind ! And now that it 's too late for anybody to go out , it must needs be fine , "
140660	140671	140672	140672	she	150	" They have been afraid to come and tell him , "
140675	140719	140672	140672	she	150	" they have been afraid to break the news to Sir Michael . Who will come to tell it , at last , I wonder ? The rector of Mount Stanning , perhaps , or the doctor ; some important person at least . "
140942	140958	140959	140959	she	150	" Perhaps Robert might care for me , if I had inflammation of the lungs , "
140962	140984	140959	140959	she	150	" He could n't insult me by calling me a bouncer then . Bouncers do n't have inflammation of the lungs . "
141132	141137	141138	141138	she	150	" Good gracious me ! "
141141	141150	141138	141138	she	150	suddenly—"six o'clock , and I 'm not dressed . "
141168	141177	141178	141178	she	150	" I must go in , my lady , "
141181	141187	141178	141178	she	150	" Wo n't you come ? "
141188	141191	141193	141194	Lady Audley	150	" Presently , "
141196	141204	141205	141205	Alicia	149	" I 'm dressed , you see . "
141651	141655	141656	141657	The speaker	4906	" My lady ! "
141679	141687	141688	141688	he	173	" What is the matter with you ? "
141698	141709	141688	141688	he	173	" Get up , and let me take you indoors . "
141770	141784	141760	141760	she	3871	" Is there any room in which I can talk to you alone ? "
141943	141947	141948	141948	he	667	" Lady Audley , "
141967	142009	141948	141948	he	667	" I spoke to you last - night very plainly , but you refused to listen to me . To - night I must speak to you still more plainly , and you must no longer refuse to listen to me . "
142043	142057	142180	142180	He	3896	" There was a fire last night at Mount Stanning , Lady Audley , "
142063	142092	142180	142180	He	3896	" the Castle Inn , the house in which I slept , was burned to the ground . Do you know how I escaped perishing in that destruction ? "
142093	142096	142180	142180	He	3896	" No . "
142097	142179	142180	142180	He	3896	" I escaped by a most providential circumstance which seems a very simple one . I did not sleep in the room which had been prepared for me . The place seemed wretchedly damp and chilly , the chimney smoked abominably when an attempt was made at lighting a fire , and I persuaded the servant to make me up a bed on the sofa in the small ground - floor sitting - room which I had occupied during the evening . "
142209	142230	142201	142201	her	468	" Shall I tell you by whose agency the destruction of the Castle Inn was brought about , my lady ? "
142236	142242	142201	142201	her	468	" Shall I tell you ? "
142249	142254	142256	142256	Robert	173	" My Lady Audley , "
142260	142430	142256	142256	Robert	173	" you are the incendiary . It was you whose murderous hand kindled those flames . It was you who thought by that thrice - horrible deed to rid yourself of me , your enemy and denouncer . What was it to you that other lives might be sacrificed ? If by a second massacre of Saint Bartholomew you could have ridded yourself of me you would have sacrificed an army of victims . The day is past for tenderness and mercy . For you I can no longer know pity or compunction . So far as by sparing your shame I can spare others who must suffer by your shame , I will be merciful , but no further . If there were any secret tribunal before which you might be made to answer for your crimes , I would have little scruple in being your accuser , but I would spare that generous and high - born gentleman upon whose noble name your infamy would be reflected . "
142458	142902	142449	142449	he	3899	" No life was lost in the fire of last night . I slept lightly , my lady , for my mind was troubled , as it has been for a long time , by the misery which I knew was lowering upon this house . It was I who discovered the breaking out of the fire in time to give the alarm and to save the servant girl and the poor drunken wretch , who was very much burnt in spite of efforts , and who now lies in a precarious state at his mother 's cottage . It was from him and from his wife that I learned who had visited the Castle Inn in the dead of the night . The woman was almost distracted when she saw me , and from her I discovered the particulars of last night . Heaven knows what other secrets of yours she may hold , my lady , or how easily they might be extorted from her if I wanted her aid , which I do not . My path lies very straight before me . I have sworn to bring the murderer of George Talboys to justice , and I will keep my oath . I say that it was by your agency my friend met with his death . If I have wondered sometimes , as it was only natural I should , whether I was not the victim of some horrible hallucination , whether such an alternative was not more probable than that a young and lovely woman should be capable of so foul and treacherous a murder , all wonder is past . After last night 's deed of horror , there is no crime you could commit , however vast and unnatural , which could make me wonder . Henceforth you must seem to me no longer a woman , a guilty woman with a heart which in its worst wickedness has yet some latent power to suffer and feel ; I look upon you henceforth as the demoniac incarnation of some evil principle . But you shall no longer pollute this place by your presence . Unless you will confess what you are and who you are in the presence of the man you have deceived so long , and accept from him and from me such mercy as we may be inclined to extend to you , I will gather together the witnesses who shall swear to your identity , and at peril of any shame to myself and those I love , I will bring upon you the just and awful punishment of your crime . "
142928	142933	142934	142934	she	5008	" Bring Sir Michael ! "
142937	143020	142934	142934	she	5008	" bring him here , and I will confess anything — everything . What do I care ? God knows I have struggled hard enough against you , and fought the battle patiently enough ; but you have conquered , Mr. Robert Audley . It is a great triumph , is it not — a wonderful victory ? You have used your cool , calculating , frigid , luminous intellect to a noble purpose . You have conquered — a MAD WOMAN ! "
143021	143026	143028	143029	Mr. Audley	173	" A mad woman ! "
143031	143167	143028	143029	Mr. Audley	173	" Yes , a mad woman . When you say that I killed George Talboys , you say the truth . When you say that I murdered him treacherously and foully , you lie . I killed him because I AM MAD ! because my intellect is a little way upon the wrong side of that narrow boundary - line between sanity and insanity ; because , when George Talboys goaded me , as you have goaded me , and reproached me , and threatened me , my mind , never properly balanced , utterly lost its balance , and I was mad ! Bring Sir Michael ; and bring him quickly . If he is to be told one thing let him be told everything ; let him hear the secret of my life ! "
143268	143274	143275	143275	He	173	words—"the secret of my life . "
143305	143327	143328	143328	He	173	sentences—"You should forgive me , for you know why I have been so . You know the secret of my life . "
143377	143474	143476	143478	the young man	667	" Lady Audley has a confession to make to you , sir — a confession which I know will be a most cruel surprise , a most bitter grief . But it is necessary for your present honor , and for your future peace , that you should hear it . She has deceived you , I regret to say , most basely ; but it is only right that you should hear from her own lips any excuses which she may have to offer for her wickedness . May God soften this blow for you ! "
143484	143489	143476	143478	the young man	667	" I can not ! "
143533	143536	143537	143537	he	146	" Lucy ! "
143568	143592	143602	143602	he	146	listener—"Lucy , tell me that this man is a madman ! tell me so , my love , or I shall kill him ! "
143669	143677	143679	143680	my lady	468	" He has told you the truth , "
143682	143799	143679	143680	my lady	468	" and he is not mad ! I have sent him for you that I may confess everything to you . I should be sorry for you if I could , for you have been very , very good to me , much better to me than I ever deserved ; but I ca n't , I can't — I can feel nothing but my own misery . I told you long ago that I was selfish ; I am selfish still — more selfish than ever in my misery . Happy , prosperous people may feel for others . I laugh at other people 's sufferings ; they seem so small compared to my own . "
143880	143935	143937	143938	my lady	468	" I must tell you the story of my life , in order to tell you why I have become the miserable wretch who has no better hope than to be allowed to run away and hide in some desolate corner of the earth . I must tell you the story of my life , "
143940	144169	143937	143938	my lady	468	" but you need not fear that I shall dwell long upon it . It has not been so pleasant to me that I should wish to remember it . When I was a very little child I remember asking a question which it was natural enough that I should ask , God help me ! I asked where my mother was . I had a faint remembrance of a face , like what my own is now , looking at me when I was very little better than a baby ; but I had missed the face suddenly , and had never seen it since . They told me that mother was away . I was not happy , for the woman who had charge of me was a disagreeable woman and the place in which we lived was a lonely place , a village upon the Hampshire coast , about seven miles from Portsmouth . My father , who was in the navy , only came now and then to see me ; and I was left almost entirely to the charge of this woman , who was irregularly paid , and who vented her rage upon me when my father was behindhand in remitting her money . So you see that at a very early age I found out what it was to be poor . "
144296	144426	144427	144427	I	0	" At last the secret came out . I worried my foster - mother with the old question one day when the remittances had fallen very much in arrear , and her temper had been unusually tried . She flew into a passion , and told me that my mother was a mad woman , and that she was in a madhouse forty miles away . She had scarcely said this when she repented , and told me that it was not the truth , and that I was not to believe it , or to say that she had told me such a thing . I discovered afterward that my father had made her promise most solemnly never to tell me the secret of my mother 's fate . "
144575	144653	144654	144654	My	0	" When I was ten years old my father came to pay up the arrears due to my protectress , and to take me to school . He had left me in Hampshire longer than he had intended , from his inability to pay this money ; so there again I felt the bitterness of poverty , and ran the risk of growing up an ignorant creature among coarse rustic children , because my father was poor . "
144797	144930	144764	144764	She	468	" My father came at last , and I told him what I had discovered . He was very much affected when I spoke of my mother . He was not what the world generally calls a good man , but I learned afterward that he had loved his wife very dearly , and that he would have willingly sacrificed his life to her , and constituted himself her guardian , had he not been compelled to earn the daily bread of the mad woman and her child by the exercise of his profession . So here again I beheld what a bitter thing it is to be poor . My mother , who might have been tended by a devoted husband , was given over to the care of hired nurses . "
145030	145119	145120	145120	I	0	" But she did n't know us . She would have spoken in the same manner to any stranger who had entered the gates of the garden about her prison - house . Her madness was an hereditary disease transmitted to her from her mother , who had died mad . She , my mother , had been , or had appeared sane up to the hour of my birth , but from that hour her intellect had decayed , and she had become what I saw her . "
145148	145221	145222	145222	I	0	" I went away with this knowledge in my mind , and with something more — a secret to keep . I was a child of ten years only , but I felt all the weight of that burden . I was to keep the secret of my mother 's madness ; for it was a secret that might affect me injuriously in after - life . I was to remember this . "
145372	145433	145349	145349	I	0	" I left school before I was seventeen years of age , with this thought in my mind , and I went to live at the other extremity of England with my father , who had retired upon his half - pay , and had established himself at Wildernsea , with the idea that the place was cheap and select . "
145544	145638	145639	145641	The wandering prince	3956	" She paused for a moment , and shuddered convulsively . It was impossible to see any of the changes in her countenance , for her face was obstinately bent toward the floor . Throughout her long confession she never lifted it ; throughout her long confession her voice was never broken by a tear . What she had to tell she told in a cold , hard tone , very much the tone in which some criminal , dogged and sullen to the last , might have confessed to a jail chaplain . "
145644	145648	145639	145641	The wandering prince	3956	" she repeated ; "
145655	145718	145649	145649	he	3956	" For the first time since his wife 's confession had begun , Sir Michael Audley started . He began to understand it all now . A crowd of unheeded words and forgotten circumstances that had seemed too insignificant for remark or recollection , flashed back upon him as vividly as if they had been the leading incidents of his past life . "
145809	146057	145795	145795	you	3962	" The dream was broken . Sir Michael Audley remembered that summer 's evening , nearly two years ago , when he had first declared his love for Mr. Dawson 's governess ; he remembered the sick , half - shuddering sensation of regret and disappointment that had come over him then , and he felt as if it had in some manner dimly foreshadowed the agony of to - night . But I do not believe that even in his misery he felt that entire and unmitigated surprise , that utter revulsion of feeling that is felt when a good woman wanders away from herself and becomes the lost creature whom her husband is bound in honor to abjure . I do not believe that Sir Michael Audley had ever really believed in his wife . He had loved her and admired her ; he had been bewitched by her beauty and bewildered by her charms ; but that sense of something wanting , that vague feeling of loss and disappointment which had come upon him on the summer 's night of his betrothal had been with him more or less distinctly ever since . I can not believe that an honest man , however pure and single may be his mind , however simply trustful his nature , is ever really deceived by falsehood . There is beneath the voluntary confidence an involuntary distrust , not to be conquered by any effort of the will . "
146062	146067	145795	145795	you	3962	" my lady continued , "
146346	146603	146320	146320	he	157	" I looked upon this as a desertion , and I resented it bitterly — resented it by hating the man who had left me with no protector but a weak , tipsy father , and with a child to support . I had to work hard for my living , and in every hour of labor — and what labor is more wearisome than the dull slavery of a governess?—I recognized a separate wrong done me by George Talboys . His father was rich , his sister was living in luxury and respectability , and I , his wife , and the mother of his son , was a slave allied to beggary and obscurity . People pitied me , and I hated them for their pity . I did not love the child , for he had been left a burden upon my hands . The hereditary taint that was in my blood had never until this time showed itself by any one sign or token ; but at this time I became subject to fits of violence and despair . At this time I think my mind first lost its balance , and for the first time I crossed that invisible line which separates reason from madness . I have seen my father 's eyes fixed upon me in horror and alarm . I have known him soothe me as only mad people and children are soothed , and I have chafed against his petty devices , I have resented even his indulgence . "
146664	146761	146781	146781	I	0	" I had seen an advertisement in the Times while I was at Wildernsea , and I presented myself to Mrs. Vincent , the advertiser , under a feigned name . She accepted me , waiving all questions as to my antecedents . You know the rest . I came here , and you made me an offer , the acceptance of which would lift me at once into the sphere to which my ambition had pointed ever since I was a school - girl , and heard for the first time that I was pretty . "
146820	146964	146965	146965	I	0	" I said ' I have a right to think that he is dead , or that he wishes me to believe him dead , and his shadow shall not stand between me and prosperity . ' I said this , and I became your wife , Sir Michael , with every resolution to be as good a wife as it was in my nature to be . The common temptations that assail and shipwreck some women had no terror for me . I would have been your true and pure wife to the end of time , though I had been surrounded by a legion of tempters . The mad folly that the world calls love had never had any part in my madness , and here at least extremes met , and the vice of heartlessness became the virtue of constancy . "
147139	147200	147201	147201	Fate	337	" I believe that at this time my mind regained its just balance . I had watched myself very closely since leaving Wildernsea ; I had held a check upon myself . I had often wondered while sitting in the surgeon 's quiet family circle whether any suspicion of that invisible , hereditary taint had ever occurred to Mr. Dawson . "
147270	147326	147328	147328	he	3988	" I said just now that I knew the energy of George 's character . I knew that the man who had gone to the antipodes and won a fortune for his wife would leave no stone unturned in his efforts to find her . It was hopeless to think of hiding myself from him . "
147349	147378	147379	147379	I	0	" My brain was dazed as I thought of my peril . Again the balance trembled , again the invisible boundary was passed , again I was mad . "
147445	147511	147512	147512	He	4643	" I confided to my father the whole secret of my peril . He was not very much shocked at what I had done , for poverty had perhaps blunted his sense of honor and principle . He was not very much shocked , but he was frightened , and he promised to do all in his power to assist me in my horrible emergency . "
147577	147619	147531	147532	my father	4643	" We decided at once upon the first step . This was that on the date of the probable arrival of the Argus , or a few days later , an advertisement of my death should be inserted in the Times . "
147696	147749	147750	147750	My	0	" I knew enough of his sanguine temperament , his courage and determination , his readiness to hope against hope , to know that unless he saw the grave in which I was buried , and the register of my death , he would never believe that I was lost to him . "
147780	147827	147828	147828	I	0	" I was hopeless of any issue out of my difficulties . I began to think that I must trust to the chapter of accidents , and hope that among other obscure corners of the earth , Audley Court might be undreamt of by my husband . "
147907	147938	147939	147939	She	673	" I was anxious to know how the boy was treated , and I detained this woman in conversation with me while my father dozed over the tea - table . "
148069	148280	148281	148281	I	0	" I let the woman run on for a long time in this manner , telling me the girl 's ailments , and the girl 's age , and the girl 's doctor 's stuff , and piety , and sufferings , and a great deal more . But I neither listened to her nor heeded her . I heard her , but only in a far - away manner , as I heard the traffic in the street , or the ripple of the stream at the bottom of it . What were this woman 's troubles to me ? I had miseries of my own , and worse miseries than her coarse nature could ever have to endure . These sort of people always had sick husbands or sick children , and expected to be helped in their illness by the rich . It was nothing out of the common . I was thinking this , and I was just going to dismiss the woman with a sovereign for her sick daughter , when an idea flashed upon me with such painful suddenness that it sent the blood surging up to my brain , and set my heart beating , as it only beats when I am mad . "
148403	148424	148389	148389	He	7600	" It was in three weeks that the ship that carried George Talboys was expected to anchor in the Mersey . "
148618	148658	148659	148661	Sir Michael Audley	146	" The advertisement was inserted in the Times , and upon the second day after its insertion George Talboys visited Ventnor , and ordered the tombstone which at this hour records the death of his wife , Helen Talboys . "
148688	148696	148697	148697	he	146	" I can not hear any more , "
148705	148829	148697	148697	he	146	" if there is anything more to be told I can not hear it . Robert , it is you who have brought about this discovery , as I understand . I want to know nothing more . Will you take upon yourself the duty of providing for the safety and comfort of this lady whom I have thought my wife ? I need not ask you to remember in all you do , that I have loved her very dearly and truly . I can not say farewell to her . I will not say it until I can think of her without bitterness — until I can pity her , as I now pray that God may pity her this night . "
149329	149332	149334	149335	Robert Audley	173	" No , "
149337	149426	149334	149335	Robert Audley	173	" I will not intrude upon the anguish of this wounded heart . There is humiliation mingled with this bitter grief . It is better he should fight the battle alone . I have done what I believe to have been my solemn duty , yet I should scarcely wonder if I had rendered myself forever hateful to him . It is better he should fight the battle alone . I can do nothing to make the strife less terrible . Better that it should be fought alone . "
149515	149522	149524	149525	Miss Audley	149	" Is papa coming to dinner ? "
149527	149568	149570	149572	the young lady	5100	" I 'm so hungry ; and poor Tomlins has sent up three times to say the fish will be spoiled . It must be reduced to a species of isinglass soup , by this time , I should think , "
149613	149624	149625	149625	she	5100	" Oh , it 's you , Mr. Robert Audley . "
149630	149660	149625	149625	she	5100	" You dine with us of course . Pray go and find papa . It must be nearly eight o'clock , and we are supposed to dine at six . "
149704	149717	149718	149720	the young man	667	" Your papa has just endured a very great grief , Alicia , "
149754	149758	149759	149759	she	149	" A grief ? "
149762	149774	149759	149759	she	149	" papa grieved ! Oh ! Robert , what has happened ? "
149775	149785	149786	149786	Robert	173	" I can tell you nothing yet , Alicia , "
149824	149832	149833	149833	he	173	" Alicia , can I trust you ? "
149838	149845	149833	149833	he	173	" Trust me to do what ? "
149846	149864	149821	149821	he	173	" To be a comfort and a friend to your poor father under a very heavy affliction . "
149865	149868	149870	149870	Alicia	149	" Yes ! "
149874	149920	149870	149870	Alicia	149	" How can you ask me such a question ? Do you think there is anything I would not do to lighten any sorrow of my father 's ? Do you think there is anything I would not suffer if my suffering could lighten his ? "
149936	149968	149969	149969	she	149	" Oh , Robert ! Robert ! could you think so badly of me as to think I would not try to be a comfort to my father in his grief ? "
149974	149982	149984	149986	the young man	667	" No , no , my dear , "
149990	150009	149984	149986	the young man	667	" I never doubted your affection , I only doubted your discretion . May I rely upon that ? "
150010	150016	150018	150018	Alicia	149	" You may , Robert , "
150022	150097	150018	150018	Alicia	149	" Very well , then , my dear girl , I will trust you . Your father is going to leave the Court , for a time at least . The grief which he has just endured — a sudden and unlooked - for sorrow , remember — has no doubt made this place hateful to him . He is going away ; but he must not go alone , must he , Alicia ? "
150098	150111	149984	149986	the young man	667	" Alone ? no ! no ! But I suppose my lady — "
150112	150121	150123	150123	Robert	173	" Lady Audley will not go with him , "
150127	150137	150123	150123	Robert	173	" he is about to separate himself from her . "
150138	150143	149984	149986	the young man	667	" For a time ? "
150144	150149	149984	149986	the young man	667	" No , forever . "
150150	150157	150159	150159	Alicia	149	" Separate himself from her forever ! "
150161	150166	150159	150159	Alicia	149	" Then this grief — "
150167	150185	150186	150186	Alicia	149	" Is connected with Lady Audley . Lady Audley is the cause of your father 's sorrow . "
150281	150298	150299	150299	he	173	" You will offer to accompany your father wherever he may choose to go , Alicia , "
150302	150398	150299	150299	he	173	" You are his natural comforter at such a time as this , but you will best befriend him in this hour of trial by avoiding all intrusion upon his grief . Your very ignorance of the particulars of that grief will be a security for your discretion . Say nothing to your father that you might not have said to him two years ago , before he married a second wife . Try and be to him what you were before the woman in yonder room came between you and your father 's love . "
150399	150403	150405	150405	Alicia	149	" I will , "
150407	150411	150405	150405	Alicia	149	" I will . "
150412	150506	150299	150299	he	173	" You will naturally avoid all mention of Lady Audley 's name . If your father is often silent , be patient ; if it sometimes seems to you that the shadow of this great sorrow will never pass away from his life , be patient still ; and remember that there can be no better hope of a cure of his grief than the hope that his daughter 's devotion may lead him to remember there is one woman upon this earth who will love him truly and purely until the last . "
150507	150521	150405	150405	Alicia	149	" Yes — yes , Robert , dear cousin , I will remember . "
150548	150553	150554	150554	he	173	" My dear Alicia , "
150557	150651	150554	150554	he	173	" do this and you will make me happy . I have been in some measure the means of bringing this sorrow upon your father . Let me hope that it is not an enduring one . Try and restore my uncle to happiness , Alicia , and I will love you more dearly than brother ever loved a noble - hearted sister ; and a brotherly affection may be worth having , perhaps , after all , my dear , though it is very different to poor Sir Harry 's enthusiastic worship . "
150701	150710	150711	150711	she	149	" You are a good fellow , Bob , "
150714	150730	150711	150711	she	149	" and I 've been very foolish and wicked to feel angry with you because — "
150737	150744	150731	150733	The young lady	5100	" Because what , my dear ? "
150749	150758	150759	150759	Alicia	149	" Because I 'm silly , Cousin Robert , "
150764	150846	150759	150759	Alicia	149	" never mind that , Bob , I 'll do all you wish , and it shall not be my fault if my dearest father does n't forget his troubles before long . I 'd go to the end of the world with him , poor darling , if I thought there was any comfort to be found for him in the journey . I 'll go and get ready directly . Do you think papa will go to - night ? "
150847	150869	150759	150759	Alicia	149	" Yes , my dear ; I do n't think Sir Michael will rest another night under this roof yet awhile . "
150870	150880	150882	150882	Alicia	149	" The mail goes at twenty minutes past nine , "
150884	150912	150882	150882	Alicia	149	" we must leave the house in an hour if we are to travel by it . I shall see you again before we go , Robert ? "
150913	150918	150759	150759	Alicia	149	" Yes , dear . "
151195	151207	151208	151208	he	146	" Have you anything more to say to me , Robert ? "
151213	151237	151208	151208	he	146	" I only came to ascertain if I could assist in any of your arrangements . You go to London by the mail ? "
151238	151241	151187	151188	Sir Michael	146	" Yes . "
151242	151253	151208	151208	he	146	" Have you any idea of where you will stay . "
151254	151277	151208	151208	he	146	" Yes , I shall stop at the Clarendon ; I am known there . Is that all you have to say ? "
151278	151288	151187	151188	Sir Michael	146	" Yes ; except that Alicia will accompany you ? "
151289	151292	151208	151208	he	146	" Alicia ! "
151293	151320	151208	151208	he	146	" She could not very well stay here , you know , just now . It would be best for her to leave the Court until — "
151321	151329	151331	151332	the baronet	465	" Yes , yes , I understand , "
151334	151351	151331	151332	the baronet	465	" but is there nowhere else that she could go — must she be with me ? "
151352	151370	151208	151208	he	146	" She could go nowhere else so immediately , and she would not be happy anywhere else . "
151371	151378	151380	151381	Sir Michael	146	" Let her come , then , "
151383	151388	151389	151389	He	146	" let her come . "
151452	151475	151485	151486	the baronet	465	" Very well , my dear uncle , then all is arranged ; Alicia will be ready to start at nine o'clock . "
151476	151483	151485	151486	the baronet	465	" Very good , very good , "
151488	151503	151504	151504	He	146	" let her come if she pleases , poor child , let her come . "
151548	151560	151562	151562	Robert	173	" I shall see you again before you go , sir , "
151564	151572	151562	151562	Robert	173	" I will leave you till then . "
151573	151576	151578	151579	Sir Michael	146	" Stay ! "
151583	151589	151578	151579	Sir Michael	146	" have you told Alicia ? "
151590	151610	151562	151562	Robert	173	" I have told her nothing , except that you are about to leave the Court for some time . "
151611	151625	151626	151627	the baronet	465	" You are very good , my boy , you are very good , "
151656	151668	151669	151669	he	465	" Oh , sir ! how can I ever forgive myself ? "
151672	151689	151669	151669	he	465	" how can I ever cease to hate myself for having brought this grief upon you ? "
151690	151726	151727	151728	Sir Michael	146	" No , no , Robert , you did right ; I wish that God had been so merciful to me as to take my miserable life before this night ; but you did right . "
151866	151873	151874	151874	he	173	" Lady Audley is very ill , "
151877	151921	151874	151874	he	173	" take her to her room and see that she does not leave it to - night . You will be good enough to remain near her , but do not either talk to her or suffer her to excite herself by talking . "
151978	151983	151984	151984	she	468	" Take me away , "
151987	152004	151984	151984	she	468	" and let me sleep ! Let me sleep , for my brain is on fire ! "
152022	152028	152029	152029	she	468	" Is Sir Michael gone ? "
152032	152041	152015	152015	she	468	" He will leave in half an hour . "
152042	152055	152015	152015	she	468	" There were no lives lost in the fire at Mount Stanning ? "
152056	152059	152015	152015	she	468	" None . "
152060	152067	152015	152015	she	468	" I am glad of that . "
152068	152099	152015	152015	she	468	" The landlord of the house , Marks , was very terribly burned , and lies in a precarious state at his mother 's cottage ; but he may recover . "
152100	152122	152015	152015	she	468	" I am glad of that — I am glad no life was lost . Good - night , Mr. Audley . "
152123	152147	152015	152015	she	468	" I shall ask to see you for half an hour 's conversation in the course of to - morrow , my lady . "
152148	152156	152015	152015	she	468	" Whenever you please . Good night . "
152157	152161	152162	152162	She	468	" Good night . "
152331	152338	152340	152341	Miss Audley	149	" Good - by , Robert , "
152351	152371	152340	152341	Miss Audley	149	" good - by , and God bless you ! You may trust me to take care of papa . "
152372	152386	152340	152341	Miss Audley	149	" I am sure I may . God bless you , my dear . "
152509	152519	152520	152520	he	465	" I leave all in your hands , Robert , "
152538	152584	152585	152585	His	465	" I may not have heard the end , but I have heard enough . Heaven knows I have no need to hear more . I leave all to you , but you will not be cruel — you will remember how much I loved — "
152596	152606	152607	152609	the young man	667	" I will remember you in everything , sir , "
152612	152621	152607	152609	the young man	667	" I will do everything for the best . "
152697	152701	152702	152702	he	173	" Good Heaven ! "
152705	152915	152702	152702	he	173	" surely this must be God 's judgment upon the purposeless , vacillating life I led up to the seventh day of last September . Surely this awful responsibility has been forced upon me in order that I may humble myself to an offended Providence , and confess that a man can not choose his own life . He can not say , ' I will take existence lightly , and keep out of the way of the wretched , mistaken , energetic creatures , who fight so heartily in the great battle . ' He can not say , ' I will stop in the tents while the strife is fought , and laugh at the fools who are trampled down in the useless struggle . ' He can not do this . He can only do , humbly and fearfully , that which the Maker who created him has appointed for him to do . If he has a battle to fight , let him fight it faithfully ; but woe betide him if he skulks when his name is called in the mighty muster - roll , woe betide him if he hides in the tents when the tocsin summons him to the scene of war ! "
152990	153001	153002	153002	he	173	" Can I send a message from here to London ? "
153005	153019	153002	153002	he	173	" It can be sent from Brentwood , sir — not from here . "
153028	153050	153020	153021	Mr. Audley	173	" One of the men can ride over to Brentwood , sir , if you wish any message to be sent . "
153051	153069	153002	153002	he	173	" I do wish to send a message ; will you manage it for me , Richards ? "
153070	153075	153002	153002	he	173	" Certainly , sir . "
153076	153089	153020	153021	Mr. Audley	173	" You can wait , then , while I write the message . "
153090	153095	153096	153097	The man	634	" Yes , sir . "
153147	153169	153170	153171	DEAR WILMINGTON	342	" From Robert Audley , of Audley Court , Essex , to Francis Wilmington , of Paper - buildings , Temple . "
153204	153226	153227	153227	You	4147	" Mr. Audley sealed this document in a stout envelope , and handed it to the man , with a sovereign . "
153241	153245	153239	153239	Richards	340	" he said , "
153271	153807	153259	153259	He	634	" Mr. Richards , who had known Robert Audley in jackets and turn - down collars , departed to execute his commission . Heaven forbid that we should follow him into the comfortable servants ' hall at the Court , where the household sat round the blazing fire , discussing in utter bewilderment the events of the day . Nothing could be wider from the truth than the speculations of these worthy people . What clew had they to the mystery of that firelit room in which a guilty woman had knelt at their master 's feet to tell the story of her sinful life ? They only knew that which Sir Michael 's valet had told them of this sudden journey . How his master was as pale as a sheet , and spoke in a strange voice that did n't sound like his own , somehow , and how you might have knocked him — Mr. Parsons , the valet — down with a feather , if you had been minded to prostrate him by the aid of so feeble a weapon . The wiseheads of the servants ' hall decided that Sir Michael had received sudden intelligence through Mr. Robert — they were wise enough to connect the young man with the catastrophe — either of the death of some near and dear relation — the elder servants decimated the Audley family in their endeavors to find a likely relation — or of some alarming fall in the funds , or of the failure of some speculation or bank in which the greater part of the baronet 's money was invested . The general leaning was toward the failure of a bank , and every member of the assembly seemed to take a dismal and raven - like delight in the fancy , though such a supposition involved their own ruin in the general destruction of that liberal household . Robert sat by the dreary hearth , which seemed dreary even now when the blaze of a great wood - fire roared in the wide chimney , and listened to the low wail of the March wind moaning round the house and lifting the shivering ivy from the walls it sheltered . He was tired and worn out , for remember that he had been awakened from his sleep at two o'clock that morning by the hot breath of blazing timber and the sharp crackling of burning woodwork . But for his presence of mind and cool decision , Mr. Luke Marks would have died a dreadful death . He still bore the traces of the night 's peril , for the dark hair had been singed upon one side of his forehead , and his left hand was red and inflamed , from the effect of the scorching atmosphere out of which he had dragged the landlord of the Castle Inn . He was thoroughly exhausted with fatigue and excitement , and he fell into a heavy sleep in his easy - chair before the bright fire , from which he was only awakened by the entrance of Mr. Richards with the return message . This return message was very brief . "
153827	153840	153841	153841	I	0	" This with names and addresses , was all that it contained . "
153856	153867	153854	153854	Richards	340	" said Mr. Audley , as he folded the telegram . "
153893	153898	153883	153883	He	634	" Mr. Richards bowed . "
153919	153923	153911	153911	you	0	" he murmured . "
153935	153961	153928	153928	you	0	" Mr. Audley might wish the man to go as early as he could , so it was decided that he should go at six . "
153972	153976	153979	153979	sir	900	" said Robert . "
153985	153986	153979	153979	sir	900	" "
154020	154774	154775	154775	I	0	" This second message was only a very earnest request to Doctor Mosgrave to pay an immediate visit to Audley Court on a matter of serious moment . Having written this message , Mr. Audley felt that he had done all that he could do . He drank his brandy and water . He had actual need of the diluted alcohol , for he had been chilled to the bone by his adventures during the fire . He slowly sipped the pale golden liquid and thought of Clara Talboys , of that earnest girl whose brother 's memory was now avenged , whose brother 's destroyer was humiliated in the dust . Had she heard of the fire at the Castle Inn ? How could she have done otherwise than hear of it in such a place as Mount Stanning ? But had she heard that he had been in danger , and that he had distinguished himself by the rescue of a drunken boor ? I fear that , even sitting by that desolate hearth , and beneath the roof whose noble was an exile from his own house , Robert Audley was weak enough to think of these things — weak enough to let his fancy wander away to the dismal fir - trees under the cold March sky , and the dark - brown eyes that were so like the eyes of his lost friend . My lady slept . Through that long winter night she slept soundly . Criminals have often so slept their last sleep upon earth ; and have been found in the gray morning slumbering peacefully , by the jailer who came to wake them . The game had been played and lost . I do not think that my lady had thrown away a card , or missed the making of a trick which she might by any possibility have made ; but her opponent 's hand had been too powerful for her , and he had won . She looked upon herself as a species of state prisoner , who would have to be taken good care of . A second Iron Mask , who must be provided for in some comfortable place of confinement . She abandoned herself to a dull indifference . She had lived a hundred lives within the space of the last few days of her existence , and she had worn out her capacity for suffering — for a time at least . She ate her breakfast , and took her morning bath , and emerged , with perfumed hair and in the most exquisitely careless of morning toilets , from her luxurious dressing - room . She looked at herself in the cheval - glass before she left the room . A long night 's rest had brought back the delicate rose - tints of her complexion , and the natural luster of her blue eyes . That unnatural light which had burned so fearfully the day before had gone , and my lady smiled triumphantly as she contemplated the reflection of her beauty . The days were gone in which her enemies could have branded her with white - hot irons , and burned away the loveliness which had done such mischief . Whatever they did to her they must leave her her beauty , she thought . At the worst , they were powerless to rob her of that . The March day was bright and sunny , with a cheerless sunshine certainly . My lady wrapped herself in an Indian shawl ; a shawl that had cost Sir Michael a hundred guineas . I think she had an idea that it would be well to wear this costly garment ; so that if hustled suddenly away , she might carry at least one of her possessions with her . Remember how much she had periled for a fine house and gorgeous furniture , for carriages and horses , jewels and laces ; and do not wonder if she clings with a desperate tenacity to gauds and gew - gaws , in the hour of her despair . If she had been Judas , she would have held to her thirty pieces of silver to the last moment of her shameful life . Mr. Robert Audley breakfasted in the library . He sat long over his solitary cup of tea , smoking his meerschaum pipe , and meditating darkly upon the task that lay before him . "
154786	154790	154782	154784	this Dr. Mosgrave	345	" he though ; "
154813	155040	155041	155041	He	4163	" The first fast train from London arrived at Audley at half - past ten o'clock , and at five minutes before eleven , Richards , the grave servant , announced Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave . The physician from Saville Row was a tall man of about fifty years of age . He was thin and sallow , with lantern jaws , and eyes of a pale , feeble gray , that seemed as if they had once been blue , and had faded by the progress of time to their present neutral shade . However powerful the science of medicine as wielded by Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave , it had not been strong enough to put flesh upon his bones , or brightness into his face . He had a strangely expressionless , and yet strangely attentive countenance . He had the face of a man who had spent the greater part of his life in listening to other people , and who had parted with his own individuality and his own passions at the very outset of his career . He bowed to Robert Audley , took the opposite seat indicated by him , and addressed his attentive face to the young barrister . Robert saw that the physician 's glance for a moment lost its quiet look of attention , and became earnest and searching . "
155050	155055	155047	155048	the patient	6552	" thought Mr. Audley , "
155068	155080	155041	155041	He	4163	" Dr. Mosgrave spoke as if in answer to this thought . "
155097	155103	155091	155091	you	0	" he said , interrogatively . "
155108	155143	155091	155091	you	0	" Dr. Mosgrave looked at his watch , a fifty - guinea Benson - made chronometer , which he carried loose in his waistcoat pocket as carelessly as if it had been a potato . "
155155	155159	155160	155160	your	0	" he said ; "
155189	155219	155160	155160	your	0	" Robert Audley had sat looking gloomily at the fire , wondering how he should begin the conversation , and had needed this reminder of the physician 's presence . "
155228	155238	155225	155226	Dr. Mosgrave	345	" he said , rousing himself by an effort , "
155314	155338	155346	155347	the physician	3070	" The business - like attention in Dr. Mosgrave 's face grew into a look of interest as he listened to Robert Audley . "
155365	155371	155350	155350	I	0	" Robert asked , gravely . "
155376	155377	155350	155350	I	0	" "
155389	155390	155350	155350	I	0	" "
155394	155424	155425	155425	I	0	" Robert Audley looked at the fire again . How much should he tell , or how little , of the dark history of his uncle 's second wife ? "
155449	155450	155436	155436	you	345	" "
155465	155466	155472	155472	I	0	" "
155491	155534	155559	155559	you	345	" Dr. Mosgrave bowed . He looked like a man who could have carried , safely locked in his passionless breast , the secrets of a nation , and who would have suffered no inconvenience from the weight of such a burden . "
155550	155558	155559	155559	you	345	" said Robert , after a pause ; "
155599	155614	155615	155615	I	0	" Dr. Mosgrave bowed again . A little sternly , perhaps , this time . "
155623	155792	155620	155621	Mr. Audley	173	" he said coldly . Robert Audley drew his chair nearer to that of the physician , and in a low voice began the story which my lady had told upon her knees in that same chamber upon the previous night . Dr. Mosgrave 's listening face , turned always toward the speaker , betrayed no surprise at that strange revelation . He smiled once , a grave , quiet smile , when Mr. Audley came to that part of the story which told of the conspiracy at Ventnor ; but he was not surprised . Robert Audley ended his story at the point at which Sir Michael Audley had interrupted my lady 's confession . He told nothing of the disappearance of George Talboys , nor of the horrible suspicions that had grown out of that disappearance . He told nothing of the fire at the Castle Inn . Dr. Mosgrave shook his head , gravely , when Mr. Audley came to the end of his story . "
155801	155805	155793	155793	You	4170	" he said . "
155821	155828	155808	155808	I	0	" Robert answered , rather evasively . "
155850	155881	155829	155829	You	4170	" said the physician . Robert Audley stared , wondering at the mad doctor . By what process had he so rapidly arrived at the young man 's secret desire ? "
155906	155907	155895	155895	I	0	" "
155924	156014	155921	155922	Mr. Audley	173	" said Dr. Mosgrave . Robert shuddered as he bowed an assent to this remark . It was something worse than a Chancery suit that he dreaded with a horrible fear . It was a trial for murder that had so long haunted his dreams . How often he had awoke , in an agony of shame , from a vision of a crowded court - house , and his uncle 's wife in a criminal dock , hemmed in on every side by a sea of eager faces . "
156028	156035	156036	156036	I	0	" the physician said , quietly ; "
156056	156057	156052	156052	she	673	" "
156061	156062	156052	156052	she	673	" "
156175	156176	156212	156212	mother	7130	" "
156184	156185	156212	156212	mother	7130	" "
156296	156307	156308	156308	Her	2399	" Robert started at this sudden mention of his friend . "
156314	156318	156308	156308	Her	2399	" he answered , "
156341	156365	156331	156331	I	0	" Dr. Mosgrave saw the startled movement , and heard the embarrassment in Robert Audley 's voice as he spoke of George Talboys . "
156374	156384	156331	156331	I	0	" he said , with a strange emphasis on the word—"you
156391	156410	156411	156412	Mr. Audley	173	" He paused for a few moments and looked at the fire , as Robert had looked before . "
156414	156420	156411	156412	Mr. Audley	173	" he said , presently , "
156438	156458	156431	156431	You	173	" Robert , looking up suddenly , plainly expressed in his face the surprise he felt at these words . "
156474	156479	156503	156504	Mr. Audley	173	" said Dr. Mosgrave , "
156527	156552	156553	156553	I	0	" He asked this question in a decisive tone , as if he knew it to be the key - stone of an arch . "
156568	156569	156553	156553	I	0	" "
156572	156577	156553	156553	I	0	" answered the physician , "
156599	156605	156596	156596	you	173	" Robert Audley was silent . "
156624	156629	156619	156619	me	0	" said the physician . "
156649	156689	156639	156639	I	0	" Robert paused for some time before he replied to this speech ; but , by and by , he lifted his head , which had been bent in an attitude of earnest thought , and addressed the physician . "
156698	156702	156693	156693	you	173	" he said . "
156746	156855	156856	156856	I	0	" He told the story of George 's disappearance , and of his own doubts and fears , Heaven knows how reluctantly . Dr. Mosgrave listened as quietly as he had listened before . Robert concluded with an earnest appeal to the physician 's best feelings . He implored him to spare the generous old man whose fatal confidence in a wicked woman had brought much misery upon his declining years . It was impossible to draw any conclusion , either favorable or otherwise , from Dr. Mosgrave 's attentive face . He rose , when Robert had finished speaking , and looked at his watch once more . "
156864	156868	156869	156869	I	0	" he said . "
156888	156889	156890	156890	She	673	" "
156900	156901	156894	156894	you	173	" "
156910	156964	156907	156907	you	173	" Robert rung for my lady 's maid , and under convoy of that smart young damsel the physician found his way to the octagon antechamber , and the fairy boudoir with which it communicated . Ten minutes afterward , he returned to the library , in which Robert sat waiting for him . "
156972	156978	156965	156965	I	0	" he said , quietly , "
157087	157104	157105	157105	I	0	" Dr. Mosgrave walked up and down the room once or twice before he spoke again . "
157121	157127	157118	157119	Mr. Audley	173	" he said , presently , "
157208	157217	157218	157218	I	0	" Robert Audley interrupted Dr. Mosgrave , hastily . "
157226	157230	157218	157218	I	0	" he said , "
157245	157246	157218	157218	I	0	" "
157252	157259	157218	157218	I	0	" answered the physician , coolly , "
157350	157363	157364	157364	I	0	" Robert Audley grasped the physician 's hands in both his own . "
157377	157384	157385	157385	I	0	" he said , with emotion ; "
157401	157402	157403	157403	I	0	" "
157418	157507	157411	157411	I	0	" said Dr. Mosgrave , smiling at the young man 's energy . He seated himself at a writing - table in the window , dipped his pen in the ink , and wrote rapidly for about seven minutes . He had filled three sides of a sheet of note - paper , when he threw down his pen and folded his letter . He put this letter into an envelope , and delivered it , unsealed , to Robert Audley . The address which it bore was : "
157511	157514	157508	157509	Monsieur Val	348	" Villebrumeuse , "
157517	157556	157579	157580	Monsieur Val	348	" Mr. Audley looked rather doubtfully from this address to the doctor , who was putting on his gloves as deliberately as if his life had never known a more solemn purpose than the proper adjustment of them . "
157560	157573	157579	157580	Monsieur Val	348	" he said , in answer to Robert Audley 's inquiring look , "
157643	157678	157610	157610	he	348	" Robert Audley would have spoken , he would have once more expressed his gratitude for the help which had been given to him , but Dr. Mosgrave checked him with an authoritative gesture . "
157690	157694	157610	157610	he	348	" he said , "
157852	157853	157846	157846	she	4220	" "
157861	157862	157863	157863	She	4220	" "
157914	157920	157911	157912	Mr. Audley	173	" the physician added hurriedly , "
157942	158541	157886	157886	she	4220	" Robert Audley sat alone in the library with the physician 's letter upon the table before him , thinking of the work which was still to be done . The young barrister had constituted himself the denouncer of this wretched woman . He had been her judge ; and he was now her jailer . Not until he had delivered the letter which lay before him to its proper address , not until he had given up his charge into the safe - keeping of the foreign mad - house doctor , not until then would the dreadful burden be removed from him and his duty done . He wrote a few lines to my lady , telling her that he was going to carry her away from Audley Court to a place from which she was not likely to return , and requesting her to lose no time in preparing for the journey . He wished to start that evening , if possible , he told her . Miss Susan Martin , the lady 's maid , thought it a very hard thing to have to pack her mistress ' trunks in such a hurry , but my lady assisted in the task . She toiled resolutely in directing and assisting her servant , who scented bankruptcy and ruin in all this packing up and hurrying away , and was therefore rather languid and indifferent in the discharge of her duties ; and at six o'clock in the evening she sent her attendant to tell Mr. Audley that she was ready to depart as soon as he pleased . Robert had consulted a volume of Bradshaw , and had discovered that Villebrumeuse lay out of the track of all railway traffic , and was only approachable by diligence from Brussels . The mail for Dover left London Bridge at nine o'clock , and could be easily caught by Robert and his charge , as the seven o'clock up - train from Audley reached Shoreditch at a quarter past eight . Traveling by the Dover and Calais route , they would reach Villebrumeuse by the following afternoon or evening . It was late in the afternoon of the next day when the diligence bumped and rattled over the uneven paving of the principal street in Villebrumeuse . Robert Audley and my lady had had the coupé of the diligence to themselves for the whole of the journey , for there were not many travelers between Brussels and Villebrumeuse , and the public conveyance was supported by the force of tradition rather than any great profit attaching to it as a speculation . My lady had not spoken during the journey , except to decline some refreshments which Robert had offered her at a halting place upon the road . Her heart sunk when they left Brussels behind , for she had hoped that city might have been the end of her journey , and she had turned with a feeling of sickness and despair from the dull Belgian landscape . She looked up at last as the vehicle jolted into a great stony quadrangle , which had been the approach to a monastery once , but which was now the court yard of a dismal hotel , in whose cellars legions of rats skirmished and squeaked even while the broad sunshine was bright in the chambers above . Lady Audley shuddered as she alighted from the diligence , and found herself in that dreary court yard . Robert was surrounded by chattering porters , who clamored for his "
158544	158809	158812	158812	you	4224	" and disputed among themselves as to the hotel at which he was to rest . One of these men ran away to fetch a hackney - coach at Mr. Audley 's behest , and reappeared presently , urging on a pair of horses — which were so small as to suggest the idea that they had been made out of one ordinary - sized animal — with wild shrieks and whoops that had a demoniac sound in the darkness . Mr. Audley left my lady in a dreary coffee - room in the care of a drowsy attendant while he drove away to some distant part of the quiet city . There was official business to be gone through before Sir Michael 's wife could be quietly put away in the place suggested by Dr. Mosgrave . Robert had to see all manner of important personages ; and to take numerous oaths ; and to exhibit the English physician 's letter ; and to go through much ceremony of signing and countersigning before he could take his lost friend 's cruel wife to the home which was to be her last upon earth . Upward of two hours elapsed before all this was arranged , and the young man was free to return to the hotel , where he found his charge staring absently at a pair of wax - candles , with a cup of untasted coffee standing cold and stagnant before her . Robert handed my lady into the hired vehicle , and took his seat opposite to her once more . "
158818	158825	158812	158812	you	4224	" she asked , at last . "
158857	158858	158853	158853	you	4224	" "
158877	159301	158874	158875	Mrs. Talboys	181	" Robert answered , gravely . They had left the paved streets behind them , and had emerged out of a great gaunt square , in which there appeared to be about half a dozen cathedrals , into a small boulevard , a broad lamp - lit road , on which the shadows of the leafless branches went and came tremblingly , like the shadows of a paralytic skeleton . There were houses here and there upon this boulevard ; stately houses , entre cour et jardin , and with plaster vases of geraniums on the stone pillars of the ponderous gateways . The rumbling hackney - carriage drove upward of three - quarters of a mile along this smooth roadway before it drew up against a gateway , older and more ponderous than any of those they had passed . My lady gave a little scream as she looked out of the coach - window . The gaunt gateway was lighted by an enormous lamp ; a great structure of iron and glass , in which one poor little shivering flame struggled with the March wind . The coachman rang the bell , and a little wooden door at the side of the gate was opened by a gray - haired man , who looked out at the carriage , and then retired . He reappeared three minutes afterward behind the folding iron gates , which he unlocked and threw back to their full extent , revealing a dreary desert of stone - paved courtyard . The coachman led his wretched horses into the courtyard , and piloted the vehicle to the principal doorway of the house , a great mansion of gray stone , with several long ranges of windows , many of which were dimly lighted , and looked out like the pale eyes of weary watchers upon the darkness of the night . My lady , watchful and quiet as the cold stars in the wintry sky , looked up at these casements with an earnest and scrutinizing gaze . One of the windows was shrouded by a scanty curtain of faded red ; and upon this curtain there went and came a dark shadow , the shadow of a woman with a fantastic head dress , the shadow of a restless creature , who paced perpetually backward and forward before the window . Sir Michael Audley 's wicked wife laid her hand suddenly upon Robert 's arm , and pointed with the other hand to this curtained window . "
159310	159314	159302	159302	I	0	" she said . "
159322	159462	159463	159463	Madam	2752	" Mr. Audley did not answer her . He had been standing at the door of the coach when she addressed him , and he quietly assisted her to alight , and led her up a couple of shallow stone steps , and into the entrance - hall of the mansion . He handed Dr. Mosgrave 's letter to a neatly - dressed , cheerful - looking , middle - aged woman , who came tripping out of a little chamber which opened out of the hall , and was very much like the bureau of an hotel . This person smilingly welcome Robert and his charge : and after dispatching a servant with the letter , invited them into her pleasant little apartment , which was gayly furnished with bright amber curtains and heated by a tiny stove . "
159470	159495	159496	159496	Madam	2752	" the Frenchwoman said , interrogatively , with a look of intense sympathy , as she placed an arm - chair for my lady . "
159497	159522	159496	159496	Madam	2752	" shrugged her shoulders wearily , and looked round the little chamber with a sharp glance of scrutiny that betokened no very great favor . "
159531	159536	159528	159529	Robert Audley	173	" she cried fiercely . "
159570	159571	159561	159561	I	0	" "
159582	159590	159591	159591	I	0	" the young man answered , gravely . "
159603	159617	159591	159591	I	0	" My lady paused for a few moments , looking reflectively at Robert . "
159623	159627	159591	159591	I	0	" she repeated . "
159662	159682	159660	159660	madam	2752	" she said in French , turning upon the woman , and tapping the polished floor with her foot . "
159690	159701	159688	159688	madam	2752	" the woman answered with a shrill scream of protest . "
159718	159860	159712	159712	one	5487	" She was interrupted by the entrance of the principal of this agreeable establishment , who came beaming into the room with a radiant smile illuminating his countenance , and with Dr. Mosgrave 's letter open in his hand . It was impossible to say how enchanted he was to make the acquaintance of M'sieu . There was nothing upon earth which he was not ready to do for M'sieu in his own person , and nothing under heaven which he would not strive to accomplish for him , as the friend of his acquaintance , so very much distinguished , the English doctor . Dr. Mosgrave 's letter had given him a brief synopsis of the case , he informed Robert , in an undertone , and he was quite prepared to undertake the care of the charming and very interesting "
159865	160531	159712	159712	one	5487	" He rubbed his hands politely , and looked at Robert . Mr. Audley remembered , for the first time , that he had been recommended to introduce his wretched charge under a feigned name . He affected not to hear the proprietor 's question . It might seem a very easy matter to have hit upon a heap of names , any one of which would have answered his purpose ; but Mr. Audley appeared suddenly to have forgotten that he had ever heard any mortal appellation except that of himself and of his lost friend . Perhaps the proprietor perceived and understood his embarrassment . He at any rate relieved it by turning to the woman who had received them , and muttering something about No . 14 , Bis . The woman took a key from a long range of others , that hung over the mantel - piece , and a wax candle from a bracket in a corner of the room , and having lighted the candle , led the way across the stone - paved hall , and up a broad , slippery staircase of polished wood . The English physician had informed his Belgian colleague that money would be of minor consequence in any arrangements made for the comfort of the English lady who was to be committed to his care . Acting upon this hint , Monsieur Val opened the outer door of a stately suite of apartments , which included a lobby , paved with alternate diamonds of black and white marble , but of a dismal and cellar - like darkness ; a saloon furnished with gloomy velvet draperies , and with a certain funereal splendor which is not peculiarly conducive to the elevation of the spirits ; and a bed - chamber , containing a bed so wondrously made , as to appear to have no opening whatever in its coverings , unless the counterpane had been split asunder with a pen - knife . My lady stared dismally round at the range of rooms , which looked dreary enough in the wan light of a single wax - candle . This solitary flame , pale and ghost - like in itself , was multiplied by paler phantoms of its ghostliness , which glimmered everywhere about the rooms ; in the shadowy depths of the polished floors and wainscot , or the window - panes , in the looking - glasses , or in those great expanses of glimmering something which adorned the rooms , and which my lady mistook for costly mirrors , but which were in reality wretched mockeries of burnished tin . Amid all the faded splendor of shabby velvet , and tarnished gilding , and polished wood , the woman dropped into an arm - chair , and covered her face with her hands . The whiteness of them , and the starry light of diamonds trembling about them , glittered in the dimly - lighted chamber . She sat silent , motionless , despairing , sullen , and angry , while Robert and the French doctor retired to an outer chamber , and talked together in undertones . Mr. Audley had very little to say that had not been already said for him , with a far better grace than he himself could have expressed it , by the English physician . He had , after great trouble of mind , hit upon the name of Taylor , as a safe and simple substitute for that other name , to which alone my lady had a right . He told the Frenchman that this Mrs. Taylor was distantly related to him — that she had inherited the seeds of madness from her mother , as indeed Dr. Mosgrave had informed Monsieur Val ; and that she had shown some fearful tokens of the lurking taint that was latent in her mind ; but that she was not to be called "
160534	160761	160762	160762	Your	4246	" He begged that she might be treated with all tenderness and compassion ; that she might receive all reasonable indulgences ; but he impressed upon Monsieur Val , that under no circumstances was she to be permitted to leave the house and grounds without the protection of some reliable person , who should be answerable for her safe - keeping . He had only one other point to urge , and that was , that Monsieur Val , who , as he had understood , was himself a Protestant — the doctor bowed — would make arrangements with some kind and benevolent Protestant clergyman , through whom spiritual advice and consolation might be secured for the invalid lady ; who had especial need , Robert added , gravely , of such advantages . This — with all necessary arrangements as to pecuniary matters , which were to be settled from time to time between Mr. Audley and the doctor , unassisted by any agents whatever — was the extent of the conversation between the two men , and occupied about a quarter of an hour . My lady sat in the same attitude when they re - entered the bedchamber in which they had left her , with her ringed hands still clasped over her face . Robert bent over to whisper in her ear . "
160769	160773	160765	160766	Madam Taylor	354	" he said . "
160789	160812	160813	160813	Madam	2752	" She only shook her head in answer to him , and did not even remove her hands from over her face . "
160824	160829	160816	160817	an attendant	4249	" said Monsieur Val . "
160848	160857	160838	160838	her	2752	" monsieur adds , with a quaint shrug . "
160935	160986	160914	160915	my subordinate	4254	" Monsieur is saying a great deal more to the same effect , rubbing his hands and beaming radiantly upon Robert and his charge , when madam rises suddenly , erect and furious , and dropping her jeweled fingers from before her face , tells him to hold his tongue . "
160999	161008	160914	160915	my subordinate	4254	" she cried , between her set teeth . "
161012	161095	160914	160915	my subordinate	4254	" She points to the door with a sharp , imperious gesture ; so rapid that the silken drapery about her arm makes a swooping sound as she lifts her hand . The sibilant French syllables hiss through her teeth as she utters them , and seem better fitted to her mood and to herself than the familiar English she has spoken hitherto . The French doctor shrugs his shoulders as he goes out into the lobby , and mutters something about a "
161099	161105	161106	161107	the Mars	355	" and a gesture worthy of "
161109	161151	161106	161107	the Mars	355	" My lady walked with a rapid footstep to the door between the bed - chamber and the saloon ; closed it , and with the handle of the door still in her hand , turned and looked at Robert Audley . "
161163	161167	161168	161168	you	4266	" she cried ; "
161186	161187	161168	161168	you	4266	" "
161203	161209	161193	161193	I	0	" Robert answered , quietly . "
161405	161406	161397	161397	I	0	" "
161411	161434	161435	161435	I	0	" cried my lady , pushing her hair fiercely from her white forehead , and fixing her dilated eyes upon Robert Audley , "
161516	161575	161576	161576	I	0	" She plucked at the feathery golden curls as if she would have torn them from her head . It had served her so little after all , that gloriously glittering hair , that beautiful nimbus of yellow light that had contrasted so exquisitely with the melting azure of her eyes . She hated herself and her beauty . "
161589	161593	161576	161576	I	0	" she cried ; "
161644	161679	161642	161642	you	4281	" She was silent for a little while , but she held her place by the door , as if determined to detain Robert as long as it was her pleasure to do so . "
161689	161695	161681	161681	you	4281	" she said , presently . "
161730	161760	161761	161761	He	4285	" Robert started as she mentioned the name of his lost friend ; his face turned pale in the dusky light , and his breathing grew quicker and louder . "
161773	161778	161761	161761	He	4285	" continued my lady . "
161842	161862	161822	161823	George Talboys	181	" Robert Audley flung his hands and clasped them above his head , with one loud cry of horror . "
161868	161877	161822	161823	George Talboys	181	" he said , after a dreadful pause ; "
161907	161908	161909	161909	He	4288	" "
161919	161945	161909	161909	He	4288	" resumed my lady , in the same hard , dogged tone as that in which she had confessed the wicked story of her life . "
162398	162423	162390	162396	a person I should have to fear	4303	" She paused , as if she had expected Robert to speak ; but he stood silent and motionless , waiting for the end . "
162433	162439	162440	162440	He	4288	" she said , petulantly . "
162611	162671	162604	162604	me!—by	4308	" Robert Audley uttered a word of horror when the story was finished . He moved a little nearer toward the door against which Helen Talboys stood . Had there been any other means of exit from the room , he would gladly have availed himself of it . He shrank from even a momentary contact with this creature . "
162681	162690	162691	162691	You	4309	" he said , in an icy voice . "
162704	162709	162693	162693	I	0	" said Helen Talboys ; "
162793	162990	162993	162993	I	0	" She moved away from the door , and Robert passed her without a word , without a look . Half an hour afterward he was in one of the principal hotels at Villebrumeuse , sitting at a neatly - ordered supper - table , with no power to eat ; with no power to distract his mind , even for a moment , from the image of that lost friend who had been treacherously murdered in the thicket at Audley Court . No feverish sleeper traveling in a strange dream ever looked out more wonderingly upon a world that seemed unreal than Robert Audley , as he stared absently at the flat swamps and dismal poplars between Villebrumeuse and Brussels . Could it be that he was returning to his uncle 's house without the woman who had reigned in it for nearly two years as queen and mistress ? He felt as if he had carried off my lady , and had made away with her secretly and darkly , and must now render up an account to Sir Michael of the fate of that woman , whom the baronet had so dearly loved . "
162997	163001	162993	162993	I	0	" he thought . "
163061	163294	163054	163054	I	0	" Brooding thus , Mr. Robert Audley absently watched the cheerless landscape from the seat in the shabby coupé of the diligence , and thought how great a leaf had been torn out of his life , now that the dark story of George Talboys was finished . What had he to do next ? A crowd of horrible thoughts rushed into his mind as he remembered the story that he had heard from the white lips of Helen Talboys . His friend — his murdered friend — lay hidden among the moldering ruins of the old well at Audley Court . He had lain there for six long months , unburied , unknown ; hidden in the darkness of the old convent well . What was to be done ? To institute a search for the remains of the murdered man was to inevitably bring about a coroner 's inquest . Should such an inquest be held , it was next to impossible that the history of my lady 's crime could fail to be brought to light . To prove that George Talboys met with his death at Audley Court , was to prove almost as surely that my lady had been the instrument of that mysterious death ; for the young man had been known to follow her into the lime - walk upon the day of his disappearance . "
163298	163314	163054	163054	I	0	" Robert exclaimed , as the full horror of his position became evident to him ; "
163339	163538	163539	163539	I	0	" He felt that there was no way out of this difficulty . Sometimes he thought that it little mattered to his dead friend whether he lay entombed beneath a marble monument , whose workmanship should be the wonder of the universe , or in that obscure hiding - place in the thicket at Audley Court . At another time he would be seized with a sudden horror at the wrong that had been done to the murdered man , and would fain have traveled even more rapidly than the express between Brussels and Paris could carry him in his eagerness to reach the end of his journey , that he might set right this cruel wrong . He was in London at dusk on the second day after that on which he had left Audley Court , and he drove straight to the Clarendon , to inquire after his uncle . He had no intention of seeing Sir Michael , as he had not yet determined how much or how little he should tell him , but he was very anxious to ascertain how the old man had sustained the cruel shock he had so lately endured . "
163544	163548	163549	163549	she	149	" he thought , "
163579	163899	163568	163568	I	0	" But Mr. Audley was not destined to see his cousin that evening , for the servants at the Clarendon told him that Sir Michael and his daughter had left by the morning mail for Paris , on their way to Vienna . Robert was very well pleased to receive this intelligence ; it afforded him a welcome respite , for it would be decidedly better to tell the baronet nothing of his guilty wife until he returned to England , with health unimpaired and spirits re - established , it was to be hoped . Mr. Audley drove to the Temple . The chambers which had seemed dreary to him ever since the disappearance of George Talboys , were doubly so to - night . For that which had been only a dark suspicion had now become a horrible certainty . There was no longer room for the palest ray , the most transitory glimmer of hope . His worst terrors had been too well founded . George Talboys had been cruelly and treacherously murdered by the wife he had loved and mourned . There were three letters waiting for Mr. Audley at his chambers . One was from Sir Michael , and another from Alicia . The third was addressed in a hand the young barrister knew only too well , though he had seen it but once before . His face flushed redly at the sight of the superscription , and he took the letter in his hand , carefully and tenderly , as if it had been a living thing , and sentient to his touch . He turned it over and over in his hands , looking at the crest upon the envelope , at the post - mark , at the color of the paper , and then put it into the bosom of his waistcoat with a strange smile upon his face . "
163909	163913	163568	163568	I	0	" he thought . "
163972	164270	163958	163960	my relentless Nemesis	4323	" He opened the first two letters . He was foolish enough to keep the last for a delicious morsel — a fairy - like dessert after the commonplace substantialities of a dinner . Alicia 's letter told him that Sir Michael had borne his agony with such a persevering tranquility that she had become at last far more alarmed by his patient calmness than by any stormy manifestation of despair . In this difficulty she had secretly called upon the physician who attended the Audley household in any cases of serious illness , and had requested this gentleman to pay Sir Michael an apparently accidental visit . He had done so , and after stopping half an hour with the baronet , had told Alicia that there was no present danger of any serious consequence from this great grief , but that it was necessary that every effort should be made to arouse Sir Michael , and to force him , however unwillingly , into action . Alicia had immediately acted upon this advice , had resumed her old empire as a spoiled child , and reminded her father of a promise he had made of taking her through Germany . With considerable difficulty she had induced him to consent to fulfilling this old promise , and having once gained her point , she had contrived that they should leave England as soon as it was possible to do so , and she told Robert , in conclusion , that she would not bring her father back to his old house until she had taught him to forget the sorrows associated with it . The baronet 's letter was very brief . It contained half a dozen blank checks on Sir Michael Audley 's London bankers . "
164280	164284	163958	163960	my relentless Nemesis	4323	" he wrote , "
164428	164568	164412	164412	you	4325	" Robert Audley breathed a long sigh of relief as he folded this letter . It released him from a duty which it would have been most painful for him to perform , and it forever decided his course of action with regard to the murdered man . George Talboys must lie at peace in his unknown grave , and Sir Michael Audley must never learn that the woman he had loved bore the red brand of murder on her soul . Robert had only the third letter to open — the letter which he had placed in his bosom while he read the others ; he tore open the envelope , handling it carefully and tenderly as he had done before . The letter was as brief as Sir Michael 's . It contained only these few lines : "
164655	164660	164661	164662	CLARA TALBOYS	256	" Yours very sincerely , "
164664	164672	164661	164662	CLARA TALBOYS	256	" Mount Stanning Rectory , March 6 . "
164738	164748	164750	164751	the barrister	955	" What can that man Marks want with me , "
164753	164822	164750	164751	the barrister	955	" He is afraid to die until he has made confession , perhaps . He wishes to tell me that which I know already — the story of my lady 's crime . I knew that he was in the secret . I was sure of it even upon the night on which I first saw him . He knew the secret , and he traded on it . "
164952	164963	164964	164964	he	173	" Better that she should hope vainly to the last , "
164967	165023	164964	164964	he	173	" better that she should go through life seeking the clew to her lost brother 's fate , than that I should give that clew into her hands , and say , ' Our worst fears are realized . The brother you loved has been foully murdered in the early promise of his youth . ' "
165445	165455	165456	165456	Robert	173	" I must give my lost friend decent burial , "
165487	165553	165456	165456	Robert	173	" I must do it ; or I shall die of some panic like this which has seized upon me to - night . I must do it ; at any peril ; at any cost . Even at the price of that revelation which will bring the mad woman back from her safe hiding - place , and place her in a criminal dock . "
165618	165637	165596	165597	Clara Talboys	256	" It was Dawson who recommended that the poor creature should be taken to his mother 's cottage , "
165647	165676	165638	165638	Robert	173	" and , I dare say . Dawson has attended him ever since the fire . He 'll be able to tell me the way to the cottage . "
165777	165788	165789	165789	Robert	173	" I am sorry to disturb you , Mr. Dawson , "
165803	165840	165789	165789	Robert	173	" but I have come down to see Marks , who , I hear , is in a very bad way , and I want you to tell me the way to his mother 's cottage . "
165841	165852	165854	165855	the surgeon	508	" I 'll show you the way , Mr. Audley , "
165857	165865	165854	165855	the surgeon	508	" I am going there this minute . "
165866	165875	165789	165789	Robert	173	" The man is very bad , then ? "
165876	165906	165789	165789	Robert	173	" So bad that he can be no worse . The change that can happen is that change which will take him beyond the reach of any earthly suffering . "
165907	165910	165912	165912	Robert	173	" Strange ! "
165914	165924	165912	165912	Robert	173	" He did not appear to be much burned . "
165925	166000	165789	165789	Robert	173	" He was not much burnt . Had he been , I should never have recommended his being removed from Mount Stanning . It is the shock that has done the business . He has been in a raging fever for the last two days ; but to - night he is much calmer , and I 'm afraid , before to - morrow night , we shall have seen the last of him . "
166001	166013	166015	166016	Mr. Audley	173	" He has asked to see me , I am told , "
166018	166021	166023	166024	the surgeon	508	" Yes , "
166028	166076	166023	166024	the surgeon	508	" A sick man 's fancy , no doubt . You dragged him out of the house , and did your best to save his life . I dare say , rough and boorish as the poor fellow is , he thinks a good deal of that . "
166287	166296	166298	166299	Mr. Dawson	151	" Shall I tell him you are here ? "
166301	166353	166298	166299	Mr. Dawson	151	" Yes , yes , if you please . But be cautious how you tell him , if you think the news likely to agitate him . I am in no hurry . I can wait . You can call me when you think I can safely come up - stairs . "
166694	166712	166713	166713	she	4400	" Let me speak to you for a moment , sir , before you talk to Luke , "
166721	166730	166713	166713	she	4400	" Pray let me speak to you first . "
166731	166743	166745	166746	the invalid	7311	" What 's the gal a - sayin ' , there ? "
166793	166801	166802	166802	he	6531	" What 's she up to there ? "
166805	166867	166802	166802	he	6531	" I wo n't have no plottin ' and no hatchin ' agen me . I want to speak to Mr. Audley my own self ; and whatever I done I 'm goin' to answer for . If I done any mischief , I 'm a - goin' to try and undo it . What 's she a - sayin ' ? "
166868	166880	166882	166884	the old woman	524	" She ai n't a - sayin ' nothin' , lovey , "
166917	166936	166882	166884	the old woman	524	" She 's only a - tellin ' the gentleman how bad you 've been , my pretty . "
166937	166959	166961	166962	Mr. Mark	358	" What I 'm a - goin' to tell I 'm only a - goin' to tell to him , remember , "
166964	166989	166961	166962	Mr. Mark	358	" and ketch me a - tellin ' of it to him if it warn't for what he done for me the other night . "
166990	166998	167000	167002	the old woman	524	" To be sure not , lovey , "
167068	167082	167083	167083	Phoebe	166	" Oh , sir , I wanted to speak to you so badly , "
167088	167109	167083	167083	Phoebe	166	" you know what I told you when I found you safe and well upon the night of the fire ? "
167110	167115	167414	167414	Luke	167	" Yes , yes . "
167116	167129	167414	167414	Luke	167	" I told you what I suspected ; what I think still . "
167130	167136	167083	167083	Phoebe	166	" Yes , I remember . "
167137	167299	167414	167414	Luke	167	" But I never breathed a word of it to anybody but you , sir , and I think that Luke has forgotten all about that night ; I think that what went before the fire has gone clean out of his head altogether . He was tipsy , you know , when my la — when she came to the Castle ; and I think he was so dazed and scared like by the fire that it all went out of his memory . He does n't suspect what I suspect , at any rate , or he 'd have spoken of it to anybody or everybody ; but he 's dreadful spiteful against my lady , for he says if she 'd have let him have a place at Brentwood or Chelmsford , this would n't have happened . So what I wanted to beg of you , sir , is not to let a word drop before Luke . "
167300	167313	167414	167414	Luke	167	" Yes , yes , I understand ; I will be careful . "
167314	167327	167414	167414	Luke	167	" My lady has left the Court , I hear , sir ? "
167328	167331	167414	167414	Luke	167	" Yes . "
167332	167340	167414	167414	Luke	167	" Never to come back , sir ? "
167341	167347	167414	167414	Luke	167	" Never to come back . "
167348	167369	167414	167414	Luke	167	" But she has not gone where she 'll be cruelly treated ; where she 'll be ill - used ? "
167370	167380	167414	167414	Luke	167	" No : she will be very kindly treated . "
167381	167413	167414	167414	Luke	167	" I 'm glad of that , sir ; I beg your pardon for troubling you with the question , sir , but my lady was a kind mistress to me . "
167438	167446	167449	167449	Phoebe	166	" that gal would have done jawing ; "
167468	167474	167476	167477	Mr. Marks	167	" I do n't want you "
167488	167571	167572	167574	The sick man	6531	chamber—"I do n't want you ; you 've no call to hear what I 've got to say — I only want Mr. Audley , and I wants to speak to him all alone , with none o ' your sneakin ' listenin ' at doors , d'ye hear ? so you may go down - stairs and keep there till you 're wanted ; and you may take mother — no , mother may stay , I shall want her presently . "
167591	167602	167603	167603	she	554	" I 've no wish to hear anything , Luke , "
167606	167626	167603	167603	she	554	" but I hope you wo n't say anything against those that have been good and generous to you . "
167627	167635	167637	167638	Mr. Marks	167	" I shall say what I like , "
167642	167674	167637	167638	Mr. Marks	167	" and I 'm not a - goin' to be ordered by you . You ai n't the parson , as I 've ever heerd of ; nor the lawyer neither . "
167788	167802	167803	167803	he	1606	" You made game of me in a general way , Mr. Audley , "
167808	168035	167803	167803	he	1606	" and you 've drawed me out , and you 've tumbled and tossed me about like in a gentlemanly way , till I was nothink or anythink in your hands ; and you 've looked me through and through , and turned me inside out till you thought you knowed as much as I knowed . I 'd no particular call to be grateful to you , not before the fire at the Castle t'other night . But I am grateful to you for that . I 'm not grateful to folks in a general way , p'r'aps , because the things as gentlefolks have give have a'most allus been the very things I did n't want . They 've give me soup , and tracks , and flannel , and coals ; but , Lord , they 've made such a precious noise about it that I 'd have been to send 'em all back to 'em . But when a gentleman goes and puts his own life in danger to save a drunken brute like me , the drunkenest brute as ever was feels grateful like to that gentleman , and wishes to say before he dies — which he sees in the doctor 's face as he ai n't got long to live—'Thank ye , sir , I 'm obliged to you . "
168089	168098	168099	168099	he	667	" I need no thanks , Luke Marks , "
168102	168114	168099	168099	he	667	" I was very glad to be of service to you . "
168136	168155	168156	168156	he	667	" You was oncommon fond of that gent as disappeared at the Court , warn't you , sir ? "
168171	168188	168190	168190	Luke	167	" You was oncommon fond of that Mr. Talboys , I 've heard say , sir , "
168192	168197	168199	168199	Robert	173	" Yes , yes , "
168204	168212	168199	168199	Robert	173	" he was my very dear friend . "
168213	168295	168190	168190	Luke	167	" I 've heard the servants at the Court say how you took on when you could n't find him . I 've heered the landlord of the Sun Inn say how cut up you was when you first missed him . ' If the two gents had been brothers , ' the landlord said , ' our gent , ' meanin ' you , sir , ' could n't have been more cut up when he missed the other . ' "
168296	168307	168309	168309	Robert	173	" Yes , yes , I know , I know , "
168311	168333	168309	168309	Robert	173	" pray do not speak any more of this subject . I can not tell you how much it distresses me . "
168383	168390	168391	168391	he	173	" Listen to me , Marks , "
168396	168533	168391	168391	he	173	" believe me that I appreciate your grateful words , and that I am very glad to have been of service to you . But before you say anything more , let me make one most solemn request . If you have sent for me that you may tell me anything of the fate of my lost friend , I entreat you to spare yourself and to spare me that horrible story . You can tell me nothing which I do not already know . The worst you can tell me of the woman who was once in your power , has already been revealed to me by her own lips . Pray , then , be silent upon this subject ; I say again , you can tell me nothing which I do not know . "
168568	168580	168581	168581	he	167	" I ca n't tell you nothin' you do n't know ? "
168584	168587	168581	168581	he	167	" Nothing . "
168588	168600	168602	168603	the invalid	7311	" Then it ai n't no good for me to try , "
168607	168613	168614	168614	he	7311	" Did she tell you ? "
168621	168635	168614	168614	he	7311	" I must beg , Marks , that you will drop the subject , "
168642	168696	168614	168614	he	7311	" I have already told you that I do not wish to hear it spoken of . Whatever discoveries you made , you made your market out of them . Whatever guilty secrets you got possession of , you were paid for keeping silence . You had better keep silence to the end . "
168697	168701	168703	168704	Luke Marks	167	" Had I ? "
168711	168724	168703	168704	Luke Marks	167	" Had I really now better hold my tongue to the last ? "
168725	168763	168614	168614	he	7311	" I think so , most decidedly . You traded on your secret , and you were paid to keep it . It would be more honest to hold to your bargain , and keep it still . "
168764	168769	168771	168772	Mr. Marks	167	" Would it now ? "
168778	168793	168771	168772	Mr. Marks	167	" but suppose my lady had one secret and I another . How then ? "
168794	168800	168614	168614	he	7311	" What do you mean ? "
168801	168887	168614	168614	he	7311	" Suppose I could have told something all along ; and would have told it , perhaps , if I 'd been a little better treated ; if what was give to me had been give a little more liberal like , and not flung at me as if I was a dog , and was only give it to be kep ' from bitin ' . Suppose I could have told somethin' , and would have told it but for that ? How then ? "
168909	168915	168916	168916	Robert	173	" His mind is wandering , "
168919	168946	168916	168916	Robert	173	" I had need be patient with him , poor fellow . It would be strange if I could not be patient with a dying man . "
169407	169424	169425	169425	he	173	" Who would have been sorry for me ? No one but my poor little Alicia , "
169428	169470	169425	169425	he	173	" and hers would have only been an April sorrow . Would Clara Talboys have been sorry ? No ! She would have only regretted me as a lost link in the mystery of her brother 's death . She would only-- "
169528	169537	169538	169538	she	524	" What is it , Luke , deary ? "
169542	169582	169538	169538	she	524	" It ai n't time for the doctor 's stuff yet . Mr. Dawson said as you were n't to have it till two hours after he went away , and he ai n't been gone an hour yet . "
169583	169595	169597	169598	Mr. Marks	167	" Who said it was the doctor 's stuff I wanted ? "
169602	169621	169622	169622	Robert	173	" I want to ask you something , mother . Do you remember the seventh of last September ? "
169667	169672	169673	169673	she	524	" Lord , Luke , "
169676	169729	169673	169673	she	524	" how can'ee ask me such questions ? My memory 's been a failin ' me this eight or nine year ; and I never was one to remember the days of the month , or aught o ' that sort . How should a poor workin ' woman remember such things . "
169737	169752	169753	169753	he	173	" You 're a good un to do what 's asked you , mother , "
169758	169809	169753	169753	he	173	" Did n't I tell you to rememer that day ? Did n't I tell you as the time might come when you 'd be called upon to bear witness about it , and put upon your Bible oath about it ? Did n't I tell you that , mother ? "
169818	169833	169834	169834	she	524	" If you say so , I make no doubt you did , Luke , "
169842	169867	169868	169868	she	524	" but I ca n't call it to mind , lovey . My memory 's been failin ' me this nine yaer , sir , "
169876	169885	169873	169874	Robert Audley	173	" and I 'm but a poor crittur . "
169898	169901	169902	169902	he	173	" Marks , "
169905	169936	169902	169902	he	173	" I tell you again , you have no cause to worry yourself about this matter . I ask you no questions , I have no wish to hear anything . "
169937	169947	169949	169949	Luke	167	" But , suppose I want to tell something , "
169955	170009	169949	169949	Luke	167	" suppose I feel I ca n't die with a secret on my mind , and have asked to see you on purpose that I might tell you ; suppose that , and you 'll suppose nothing but the truth . I 'd have been burnt alive before I 'd have told her . "
170027	170116	170023	170023	he	167	" I 'd have been burnt alive first . I made her pay for her pretty insolent ways ; I made her pay for her airs and graces ; I 'd never have told her — never , never ! I had my power over her , and I kept it ; I had my secret and was paid for it ; and there was n't a petty slight as she ever put upon me or mine that I did n't pay her out for twenty times over ! "
170117	170129	170131	170131	Robert	173	" Marks , Marks , for Heaven 's sake be calm , "
170135	170151	170131	170131	Robert	173	" What are you talking of ? What is it that you could have told ? "
170152	170162	170164	170164	Luke	167	" I 'm a - goin to tell you , "
170170	170178	170164	170164	Luke	167	" Give us a drink , mother . "
170228	170234	170235	170235	he	4404	" Stop where you are , "
170266	170276	170278	170278	Luke	167	" I 'll ask you another question , mother , "
170280	170327	170278	170278	Luke	167	" and I think it 'll be strange if you ca n't answer it . Do you remember when I was at work upon Atkinson 's farm ; before I was married you know , and when I was livin ' down here along of you ? "
170328	170333	170334	170335	Mrs. Marks	221	" Yes , yes , "

170576	170786	170573	170574	Mr. Marks	167	" who 's a talkin ' of Phoebe ? What 's Phoebe , that anybody should go to put theirselves out about her ? Do you remember my bringin ' home a gentleman after ten o'clock , one September night ; a gentleman as was wet through to the skin , and was covered with mud and slush , and green slime and black muck , from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot , and had his arm broke , and his shoulder swelled up awful ; and was such a objeck that nobody would ha ' knowed him ; a gentleman as had to have his clothes cut off him in some places , and as sat by the kitchen fire , starin ' at the coals as if he had gone mad or stupid - like , and did n't know where he was , or who he was ; and as had to be cared for like a baby , and dressed , and dried , and washed , and fed with spoonfuls of brandy , that had to be forced between his locked teeth , before any life could be got into him ? Do you remember that , mother ? "
170838	170842	170843	170843	he	173	" My God ! "
170846	170860	170843	170843	he	173	" I think Thee for Thy wondrous mercies . George Talboys is alive ! "

171162	171169	171171	171172	Mr. Marks	167	" Suppose you read 'em first , "
171174	171183	171171	171172	Mr. Marks	167	" and ask me questions about them afterwards . "
171212	171366	171130	171130	Robert	173	" MY DEAR FRIEND — I write to you in such utter confusion of mind as perhaps no man ever before suffered . I can not tell you what has happened to me , I can only tell you that something has happened which will drive me from England a broken - hearted man , to seek some corner of the earth in which I may live and die unknown and forgotten . I can only ask you to forget me . If your friendship could have done me any good , I would have appealed to it . If your counsel could have been any help to me , I would have confided in you . But neither friendship nor counsel can help me ; and all I can say to you is this , God bless you for the past , and teach you to forget me in the future . G.T. "

You shall never hear of me again ; to you and to the world I shall henceforth be that which you wished me to be to - day . You need fear no molestation from me . I leave England never to return . "
171462	171521	171373	171374	another person	2618	" Robert Audley sat staring at these lines in hopeless bewilderment . They were not in his friend 's familiar hand , and yet they purported to be written by him and were signed with his initials . He looked scrutinizingly at the face of Luke Marks , thinking that perhaps some trick was being played upon him . "
171530	171534	171527	171528	George Talboys	157	" he said . "

Audley church clock struck nine as I was crossin ' the meadows between Atkinson 's and the Court , and it must have been about a quarter past nine when I got into the kitchen garden . "

172282	172330	172350	172350	he	0	" I told him that was easy enough , but I began to think my first thoughts of him might have been right enough , after all , and that he could n't have been up to no good to want to sneak away so precious quiet . "
172364	172399	172400	172400	I	0	" He 'd got up into a sittin ' attitude by this time , and I could see that his right arm hung close by his side , and that he was in pain . "
172476	172500	172440	172440	he	0	" I told him I could take him to mother 's cottage , and that he could dry his clothes there and welcome . "
172513	172577	172510	172510	he	0	" ' Well , she could keep one well enough if she could remember it , ' I told him ; ' but you might tell her all the secrets of the Freemasons , and Foresters , and Buffalers and Oddfellers as ever was , to - night : and she 'd have forgotten all about 'em to - morrow mornin ' .

172630	172653	172654	172654	He	0	" ' You have n't been and fell into the fish - pond , have you , sir ? ' I asked . "
172702	172737	172684	172684	he	0	" ' Take me to your mother 's cottage , ' he said , ' and get me some dry clothes if you can ; I 'll pay you well for your trouble . ' "
172909	173126	173127	173127	I	0	" I put the strange chap in a chair agen the fire , and then for the first time I had a good look at him . I never see anybody in such a state before . He was all over green damp and muck , and his hands was scratched and cut to pieces . I got his clothes off him how I could , for he was like a child in my hands , and sat starin ' at the fire as helpless as any baby ; only givin ' a long heavy sigh now and then , as if his heart was a - goin' to bust . At last he dropped into a kind of a doze , a stupid sort of sleep , and began to nod over the fire , so I ran and got a blanket and wrapped him in it , and got him to lie down on the press bedstead in the room under this . I sent mother to bed , and I sat by the fire and watched him , and kep ' the fire up till it was just upon daybreak , when he ' woke up all of a sudden with a start , and said he must go , directly this minute . "
173346	173365	173366	173366	I	0	" ' What 's the nearest town to this upon the London road ? ' he asked me . "
173376	173425	173426	173426	I	0	" ' Very well , then , ' he says , ' if you 'll go with me to Brentwood , and take me to some surgeon as'll set my arm , I 'll give you a five pound note for that and all your other trouble . ' "
173484	173516	173472	173472	I	0	" He shook his head . No , no , no , he said , he did n't want anybody to know anything about him ; he 'd rather walk it . "
173698	173777	173678	173679	the surgeon	508	" Robert Audley started . A circumstance connected with his visit to Liverpool dashed suddenly back upon his memory . He remembered the clerk who had called him back to say there was a passenger who took his berth on board the Victoria Regia within an hour or so of the vessel 's sailing ; a young man with his arm in a sling , who had called himself by some common name , which Robert had forgotten . "
173784	173788	173789	173789	he	4502	" continued Luke , "
173926	174138	173895	173896	the other	4907	" With that the surgeon goes to fetch the envelopes , and the young chap takes a pocket - book out of his coat pocket with his left hand ; the cover was wet and dirty , but the inside was clean enough , and he tears out a couple of leaves and begins to write upon 'em as you see ; and he writes dreadful awk'ard with his left hand , and he writes slow , but he contrives to finish what you see , and then he puts the two bits o ' writin ' into the envelopes as the surgeon brings him , and he seals 'em up , and he puts a pencil cross upon one of 'em , and nothing on the other : and then he pays the surgeon for his trouble , and the surgeon says , ai n't there nothin' more he can do for him , and ca n't he persuade him to stay in Brentwood till his arm 's better ; but he says no , no , it ai n't possible ; and then he says to me , ' Come along o ' me to the railway station , and I 'll give you what I 've promised .

174415	174421	174428	174430	the young chap	4516	" Luke added , parenthetically . "

So I did n't go to work that day , though I ought to ha ' done , and I lounged and idled about until it was nigh upon dusk , and then I goes down to the meadows behind the Court , and there I finds Phoebe sure enough , waitin ' agen the wooden door in the wall , on the lookout for me . "
174910	174944	174950	174950	I	0	" Well , ' she says , ' I ai n't quite myself this evenin ' , for I had a upset yesterday , and I ai n't got over it yet . ' "
174966	174990	174962	174962	I	0	" She did n't answer me directly , but she smiled the queerest smile as ever I see , and presently she says : "
175075	175120	175063	175063	she	468	" I could n't make out this , for it was only a few days before as she 'd told me her missus was selfish and extravagant , and we might wait a long time before we could get what we wanted from her . "
175177	175246	175167	175167	I	0	" I 'll tell you what it is , my gal , you 're a - keepin ' somethink from me ; somethink you 've been told , or somethink you 've found out ; and if you think you 're a - goin' to try that game on with me , you 'll find you 're very much mistaken ; and so I give you warnin ' . "
175247	175274	175288	175288	I	0	" But she laughed it off like , and says , ' Lor ' Luke , what could have put such fancies into your head ? ' "
175329	175374	175319	175326	a tall young gentleman with a brown beard	4556	" Instead of answering of me like a Christian , my Cousin Phoebe bursts out a - cryin ' , and wrings her hands , and goes on awful , until I 'm dashed if I can make out what she 's up to . "
175473	175474	175471	175471	they	4563	" "
175477	175481	175471	175471	they	4563	" cried Robert , "
175487	175488	175471	175471	they	4563	" "
175559	175593	175595	175595	you	4568	" ' And she is in my power , Luke , ' says Phoebe ; ' and she 'll do anythin ' in the world for us if we keep her secret . ' "
175670	175723	175725	175725	she	166	" So I kep ' the letter and kep ' my secret , and my lady kep ' hern . But I thought if she acted liberal by me , and gave me the money I wanted , free like , I 'd tell her everythink , and make her mind easy . "
175866	176042	176043	176043	Your	4576	" Luke Marks had finished his story , and lay quietly enough , exhausted by having talked so long . He watched Robert Audley 's face , fully expecting some reproof , some grave lecture ; for he had a vague consciousness that he had done wrong . But Robert did not lecture him ; he had no fancy for an office which he did not think himself fitted to perform . Robert Audley sat until long after daybreak with the sick man , who fell into a heavy slumber a short time after he had finished his story . The old woman had dozed comfortably throughout her son 's confession . Phoebe was asleep upon the press bedstead in the room below ; so the young barrister was the only watcher . He could not sleep ; he could only think of the story he had heard . He could only thank God for his friend 's preservation , and pray that he might be able to go to Clara Talboys , and say , "
176053	176150	176151	176151	He	6374	" Phoebe came up - stairs at eight o'clock , ready to take her place at the sick - bed , and Robert Audley went away , to get a bed at the Sun Inn . It was nearly dusk when he awoke out of a long dreamless slumber , and dressed himself before dining in the little sitting - room , in which he and George had sat together a few months before . The landlord waited upon him at dinner , and told him that Luke Marks had died at five o'clock that afternoon . "
176158	176163	176151	176151	He	6374	" the man said , "
176168	176231	176151	176151	He	6374	" Robert Audley wrote a long letter that evening , addressed to Madame Taylor , care of Monsieur Val , Villebrumeuse ; a long letter in which he told the wretched woman who had borne so many names , and was to bear a false one for the rest of her life , the story that the dying man had told him . "
176255	176259	176151	176151	He	6374	" he thought , "
176275	176780	176151	176151	He	6374	" Clara Talboys returned to Dorsetshire , to tell her father that his only son had sailed for Australia upon the 9th of September , and that it was most probable he yet lived , and would return to claim the forgiveness of the father he had never very particularly injured ; except in the matter of having made that terrible matrimonial mistake which had exercised so fatal an influence upon his youth . Mr. Harcourt - Talboys was fairly nonplused . Junius Brutus had never been placed in such a position as this , and seeing no way of getting out of this dilemma by acting after his favorite model , Mr. Talboys was fain to be natural for once in his life , and to confess that he had suffered much uneasiness and pain of mind about his only son since his conversation with Robert Audley , and that he would be heartily glad to take his poor boy to his arms , whenever he should return to England . But when was he likely to return ? and how was he to be communicated with ? That was the question . Robert Audley remembered the advertisements which he had caused to be inserted in the Melbourne and Sydney papers . If George had re - entered either city alive , how was it that no notice had ever been taken of that advertisement ? Was it likely that his friend would be indifferent to his uneasiness ? But then , again , it was just possible that George Talboys had not happened to see this advertisement ; and , as he had traveled under a feigned name , neither his fellow passengers nor the captain of the vessel would have been able to identify him with the person advertised for . What was to be done ? Must they wait patiently till George grew weary of his exile , and returned to his friends who loved him ? or were there any means to be taken by which his return might be hastened ? Robert Audley was at fault ! Perhaps , in the unspeakable relief of mind which he had experienced upon the discovery of his friend 's escape , he was unable to look beyond the one fact of that providential preservation . In this state of mind he went down to Dorsetshire to pay a visit to Mr. Talboys , who had given way to a perfect torrent of generous impulses , and had gone so far as to invite his son 's friend to share the prim hospitality of the square , red brick mansion . Mr. Talboys had only two sentiments upon the subject of George 's story ; one was a natural relief and happiness in the thought that his son had been saved , the other was an earnest wish that my lady had been his wife , and that he might thus have had the pleasure of making a signal example of her . "
176793	176797	176788	176788	you	4581	" he said , "
176849	177427	177429	177429	you	4585	" It was in the middle of April when Robert Audley found himself once more under those black fir - trees beneath which his wandering thoughts had so often stayed since his first meeting with Clara Talboys . There were primroses and early violets in the hedges now , and the streams , which , upon his first visit , had been hard and frost - bound as the heart of Harcourt Talboys , had thawed , like that gentleman , and ran merrily under the blackthorn bushes in the capricious April sunshine . Robert had a prim bedroom , and an uncompromising dressing - room allotted him in the square house , and he woke every morning upon a metallic spring mattress , which always gave him the idea of sleeping upon some musical instrument , to see the sun glaring in upon him through the square , white blinds and lighting up the two lackered urns which adorned the foot of the blue iron bedstead , until they blazed like two tiny brazen lamps of the Roman period . He emulated Mr. Harcourt Talboys in the matter of shower - baths and cold water , and emerged prim and blue as that gentleman himself , as the clock in the hall struck seven , to join the master of the house in his ante - breakfast constitutional under the fir - trees in the stiff plantation . But there was generally a third person who assisted in the constitutional promenades , and that third person was Clara Talboys , who used to walk by her father 's side , more beautiful than the morning — for that was sometimes dull and cloudy , while she was always fresh and bright — in a broad - leaved straw - hat and flapping blue ribbons , one quarter of an inch of which Mr. Audley would have esteemed a prouder decoration than ever adorned a favored creature 's button - hole . At first they were very ceremonious toward each other , and were only familiar and friendly upon the one subject of George 's adventures ; but little by little a pleasant intimacy arose between them , and before the first three weeks of Robert 's visit had elapsed , Miss Talboys made him happy , by taking him seriously in hand and lecturing him on the purposeless life he had led so long , and the little use he had made of the talents and opportunities that had been given to him . How pleasant it was to be lectured by the woman he loved ! How pleasant it was to humiliate himself and depreciate himself before her ! How delightful it was to get such splendid opportunities of hinting that if his life had been sanctified by an object he might indeed have striven to be something better than an idle flaneur upon the smooth pathways that have no particular goal ; that , blessed by the ties which would have given a solemn purpose to every hour of his existence , he might indeed have fought the battle earnestly and unflinchingly . He generally wound up with a gloomy insinuation to the effect that it was only likely he would drop quietly over the edge of the Temple Gardens some afternoon when the river was bright and placid in the low sunlight , and the little children had gone home to their tea . "
177454	177458	177429	177429	you	4585	" he asked . "
177505	177695	177696	177696	I	0	" I am sorry to say that while this hypocritical young barrister was holding forth in this despondent way , he had mentally sold up his bachelor possessions , including all Michel Levy 's publications , and half a dozen solid silver - mounted meerschaums ; pensioned off Mrs. Maloney , and laid out two or three thousand pounds in the purchase of a few acres of verdant shrubbery and sloping lawn , embosomed amid which there should be a fairy cottage ornée , whose rustic casements should glimmer out of bowers of myrtle and clematis to see themselves reflected in the purple bosom of the lake . Of course , Clara Talboys was far from discovering the drift of these melancholy lamentations . She recommended Mr. Audley to read hard and think seriously of his profession , and begin life in real earnest . It was a hard , dry sort of existence , perhaps , which she recommended ; a life of serious work and application , in which he should strive to be useful to his fellow - creatures , and win a reputation for himself . "
177702	177706	177696	177696	I	0	" he thought , "
177770	177918	177749	177749	she	4587	" Being naturally of a vacillating and dilatory disposition , there is no saying how long Mr. Audley might have kept his secret , fearful to speak and break the charm of that uncertainty which , though not always hopeful , was very seldom quite despairing , had not he been hurried by the impulse of an unguarded moment into a full confession of the truth . He had stayed five weeks at Grange Heath , and felt that he could not , in common decency , stay any longer ; so he had packed his portmanteau one pleasant May morning , and had announced his departure . Mr. Talboys was not the sort of man to utter any passionate lamentations at the prospect of losing his guest , but he expressed himself with a cool cordiality which served with him as the strongest demonstration of friendship . "
177930	177934	177927	177928	Mr. Audley	173	" he said , "
177984	178026	178027	178027	I	0	" Robert bowed . How thankful he was to the good fortune which had never suffered him to oversleep the signal of the clanging bell , or led him away beyond the ken of clocks at Mr. Talboys ' luncheon hour . "
178039	178044	178045	178045	you	173	" Mr. Talboys resumed , "
178095	178497	178498	178498	I	0	" Robert responded most heartily to these friendly overtures . He declared that there was no earthly occupation that was more agreeable to him than partridge - shooting , and that he should be only too delighted to avail himself of the privilege so kindly offered to him . He could not help glancing toward Clara as he said this . The perfect lids drooped a little over the brown eyes , and the faintest shadow of a blush illuminated the beautiful face . But this was the young barrister 's last day in Elysium , and there must be a dreary interval of days and nights and weeks and months before the first of September would give him an excuse for returning to Dorsetshire ; a dreary interval which fresh colored young squires or fat widowers of eight - and - forty , might use to his disadvantage . It was no wonder , therefore , that he contemplated this dismal prospect with moody despair , and was bad company for Miss Talboys that morning . But in the evening after dinner , when the sun was low in the west , and Harcourt Talboys closeted in his library upon some judicial business with his lawyer and a tenant farmer , Mr. Audley grew a little more agreeable . He stood by Clara 's side in one of the long windows of the drawing - room , watching the shadows deepening in the sky and the rosy light growing every moment rosier as the sun died out . He could not help enjoying that quiet tête - a - tête , though the shadow of the next morning 's express which was to carry him away to London loomed darkly across the pathway of his joy . He could not help being happy in her presence ; forgetful of the past , reckless of the future . They talked of the one subject which was always a bond of union between them . They talked of her lost brother George . She spoke of him in a very melancholy tone this evening . How could she be otherwise than sad , remembering that if he lived — and she was not even sure of that — he was a lonely wanderer far away from all who loved him , and carrying the memory of a blighted life wherever he went . "
178515	178519	178521	178521	he	188	" she said , "
178588	178641	178643	178643	I	0	" she added , in a lower voice . She turned her face away from Robert , and looked out at the darkening sky . He laid his hand upon her arm . It trembled in spite of him , and his voice trembled , too , as he spoke to her . "
178651	178655	178656	178656	You	0	" he said . "
178658	178673	178674	178674	You	0	" She turned her head , and looked at him earnestly through her tears . "

178816	178832	178833	178833	You	0	" Her head was bent , and it was some moments before she answered him . "

178918	178961	178912	178912	I	0	" cried Mr. Audley , dropping on his knees — rather awkwardly , it must be confessed — and covering a soft little hand , that he had found half hidden among the folds of a silken dress , with passionate kisses . "

179025	179058	179059	179059	Clara	256	" The little hand was drawn away from his , but not with a sudden or angry gesture , and it rested for one moment lightly and tremulously upon his dark hair . "
179063	179074	179059	179059	Clara	256	" he murmured , in a low , pleading voice , "
179086	179129	179076	179076	I	0	" There was no answer . I do n't know how it is , but there is scarcely anything more delicious than silence in such cases . Every moment of hesitation is a tacit avowal ; every pause is a tender confession . "
179162	179389	179396	179396	yer	4610	" Mr. Harcourt Talboys , coming into the lamplit room a quarter of an hour afterward , found Robert Audley alone , and had to listen to a revelation which very much surprised him . Like all self - sufficient people , he was tolerably blind to everything that happened under his nose , and he had fully believed that his own society , and the Spartan regularity of his household , had been the attractions which had made Dorsetshire delightful to his guest . He was rather disappointed , therefore ; but he bore his disappointment pretty well , and expressed a placid and rather stoical satisfaction at the turn which affairs had taken . So Robert Audley went back to London , to surrender his chambers in Figtree Court , and to make all due inquiries about such ships as sailed from Liverpool for Sydney in the month of June . He had lingered until after luncheon at Grange Heath , and it was in the dusky twilight that he entered the shady Temple courts and found his way to his chambers . He found Mrs. Maloney scrubbing the stairs , as was her wo nt upon a Saturday evening , and he had to make his way upward amidst an atmosphere of soapy steam , that made the balusters greasy under his touch . "
179399	179423	179396	179396	yer	4610	" the laundress said , as she rose from her knees and flattened herself against the wall to enable Robert to pass her , "
179469	179664	179455	179455	you	4610	" He opened the door of his sitting - room , and walked in . The canaries were singing their farewell to the setting sun , and the faint , yellow light was flickering upon the geranium leaves . The visitor , whoever he was , sat with his back to the window and his head bent upon his breast . But he started up as Robert Audley entered the room , and the young man uttered a great cry of delight and surprise , and opened his arms to his lost friend , George Talboys . We know how much Robert had to tell . He touched lightly and tenderly upon that subject which he knew was cruelly painful to his friends ; he said very little of the wretched woman who was wearing out the remnant of her wicked life in the quiet suburb of the forgotten Belgian city . George Talboys spoke very briefly of that sunny seventh of September , upon which he had left his friend sleeping by the trout stream while he went to accuse his false wife of that conspiracy which had well nigh broken his heart .

He had gone on board the Victoria Regia , but had afterward changed his berth for one in another vessel belonging to the same owners , and had gone to New York , where he had stayed as long as he could endure the loneliness of an existence which separated him from every friend he had ever known .

180172	181030	181031	181032	the righteous	4624	" Two years have passed since the May twilight in which Robert found his old friend ; and Mr. Audley 's dream of a fairy cottage has been realized between Teddington Locks and Hampton Bridge , where , amid a little forest of foliage , there is a fantastical dwelling place of rustic woodwork , whose latticed windows look out upon the river . Here , among the lilies and the rushes on the sloping bank , a brave boy of eight years old plays with a toddling baby , who peers wonderingly from his nurse 's arms at that other baby in the purple depth of the quiet water . Mr. Audley is a rising man upon the home circuit by this time , and has distinguished himself in the great breach of promise case of Hobbs v. Nobbs , and has convulsed the court by his deliciously comic rendering of the faithless Nobb 's amatory correspondence . The handsome dark - eyed boy is Master George Talboys , who declines musa at Eton , and fishes for tadpoles in the clear water under the spreading umbrage beyond the ivied walls of the academy . But he comes very often to the fairy cottage to see his father , who lives there with his sister and his sister 's husband ; and he is very happy with his Uncle Robert , his Aunt Clara , and the pretty baby who has just begun to toddle on the smooth lawn that slopes down to the water 's brink , upon which there is a little Swiss boat - house and landing - stage where Robert and George moor their slender wherries . Other people come to the cottage near Teddington . A bright , merry - hearted girl , and a gray - bearded gentleman , who has survived the trouble of his life , and battled with it as a Christian should . It is more than a year since a black - edged letter , written upon foreign paper , came to Robert Audley , to announce the death of a certain Madame Taylor , who had expired peacefully at Villebrumeuse , dying after a long illness , which Monsieur Val describes as a maladie de langueur . Another visitor comes to the cottage in this bright summer of 1861 — a frank , generous hearted young man , who tosses the baby and plays with Georgey , and is especially great in the management of the boats , which are never idle when Sir Harry Towers is at Teddington . There is a pretty rustic smoking - room over the Swiss boat - house , in which the gentlemen sit and smoke in the summer evenings , and whence they are summoned by Clara and Alicia to drink tea , and eat strawberries and cream upon the lawn . Audley Court is shut up , and a grim old housekeeper reigns paramount in the mansion which my lady 's ringing laughter once made musical . A curtain hangs before the pre - Raphaelite portrait ; and the blue mold which artists dread gathers upon the Wouvermans and Poussins , the Cuyps and Tintorettis . The house is often shown to inquisitive visitors , though the baronet is not informed of that fact , and people admire my lady 's rooms , and ask many questions about the pretty , fair - haired woman who died abroad . Sir Michael has no fancy to return to the familiar dwelling - place in which he once dreamed a brief dream of impossible happiness . He remains in London until Alicia shall be Lady Towers , when he is to remove to a house he has lately bought in Hertfordshire , on the borders of his son - in - law 's estate . George Talboys is very happy with his sister and his old friend . He is a young man yet , remember , and it is not quite impossible that he may , by - and - by , find some one who will console him for the past . That dark story of the past fades little by little every day , and there may come a time in which the shadow my lady 's wickedness has cast upon the young man 's life will utterly vanish away . The meerschaum and the French novels have been presented to a young Templar with whom Robert Audley had been friendly in his bachelor days ; and Mrs. Maloney has a little pension , paid her quarterly , for her care of the canaries and geraniums . I hope no one will take objection to my story because the end of it leaves the good people all happy and at peace . If my experience of life has not been very long , it has at least been manifold ; and I can safely subscribe to that which a mighty king and a great philosopher declared , when he said , that neither the experience of his youth nor of his age had ever shown him "
