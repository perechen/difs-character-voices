63	66	68	68	Gudrun	160	“ Ursula , ”
70	80	68	68	Gudrun	160	“ do n’t you really want to get married ? ”
99	105	106	106	she	160	“ I do n’t know , ”
109	116	106	106	she	160	“ It depends how you mean . ”
131	134	135	135	she	160	“ Well , ”
140	158	159	159	she	160	“ it usually means one thing ! But do n’t you think anyhow , you ’d be — ”
161	171	159	159	she	160	slightly—“in a better position than you are in now . ”
180	184	185	185	she	160	“ I might , ”
188	195	185	185	she	160	“ But I ’m not sure . ”
210	224	225	225	she	160	“ You do n’t think one needs the experience of having been married ? ”
228	238	240	240	Ursula	255	“ Do you think it need be an experience ? ”
242	253	255	255	Gudrun	160	“ Bound to be , in some way or other , ”
259	273	255	255	Gudrun	160	“ Possibly undesirable , but bound to be an experience of some sort . ”
274	278	280	280	Ursula	255	“ Not really , ”
282	292	280	280	Ursula	255	“ More likely to be the end of experience . ”
303	307	308	308	she	160	“ Of course , ”
311	318	308	308	she	160	“ there ’s that to consider . ”
350	359	361	361	Gudrun	160	“ You would n’t consider a good offer ? ”
363	371	373	373	Ursula	255	“ I think I ’ve rejected several , ”
375	378	379	379	Gudrun	160	“ Really ! ”
381	391	379	379	Gudrun	160	dark—“But anything really worth while ? Have you really ? ”
392	409	411	411	Ursula	255	“ A thousand a year , and an awfully nice man . I liked him awfully , ”
413	423	411	411	Ursula	255	“ Really ! But were n’t you fearfully tempted ? ”
424	434	436	436	Ursula	255	“ In the abstract but not in the concrete , ”
438	473	436	436	Ursula	255	“ When it comes to the point , one is n’t even tempted — oh , if I were tempted , I ’d marry like a shot . I ’m only tempted not to . ”
485	493	495	495	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t it an amazing thing , ”
497	507	495	495	Gudrun	160	“ how strong the temptation is , not to ! ”
660	667	668	668	She	160	“ She is a smart woman . ”
700	712	713	713	Gudrun	160	“ I was hoping now for a man to come along , ”
741	752	753	753	she	160	“ So you have come home , expecting him here ? ”
756	761	763	763	Gudrun	160	“ Oh my dear , ”
767	799	800	800	she	160	“ I would n’t go out of my way to look for him . But if there did happen to come along a highly attractive individual of sufficient means — well — ”
818	827	828	828	she	160	“ Do n’t you find yourself getting bored ? ”
834	855	806	806	she	160	“ Do n’t you find , that things fail to materialize ? Nothing materializes ! Everything withers in the bud . ”
856	863	865	865	Ursula	255	“ What withers in the bud ? ”
867	878	865	865	Ursula	255	“ Oh , everything — oneself — things in general . ”
892	898	900	900	Ursula	255	“ It does frighten one , ”
909	921	900	900	Ursula	255	“ But do you hope to get anywhere by just marrying ? ”
922	932	934	934	Gudrun	160	“ It seems to be the inevitable next step , ”
966	970	971	971	she	160	“ I know , ”
974	1018	971	971	she	160	“ it seems like that when one thinks in the abstract . But really imagine it : imagine any man one knows , imagine him coming home to one every evening , and saying ‘ Hello , ’ and giving one a kiss — ”
1025	1028	1030	1030	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
1037	1049	1030	1030	Gudrun	160	“ It ’s just impossible . The man makes it impossible . ”
1050	1057	1059	1059	Ursula	255	“ Of course there ’s children — ”
1067	1076	1077	1077	she	160	“ Do you really want children , Ursula ? ”
1092	1101	1102	1102	she	160	“ One feels it is still beyond one , ”
1105	1112	1114	1114	Gudrun	160	“ Do you feel like that ? ”
1116	1129	1114	1114	Gudrun	160	“ I get no feeling whatever from the thought of bearing children . ”
1146	1153	1154	1154	she	160	“ Perhaps it is n’t genuine , ”
1157	1174	1154	1154	she	160	“ Perhaps one does n’t really want them , in one ’s soul — only superficially . ”
1192	1202	1204	1204	Ursula	255	“ When one thinks of other people ’s children — ”
1216	1219	1220	1220	she	160	“ Exactly , ”
1428	1437	1438	1438	she	160	“ Why did you come home , Prune ? ”
1467	1476	1477	1477	she	160	“ Why did I come back , Ursula ? ”
1480	1489	1477	1477	she	160	“ I have asked myself a thousand times . ”
1490	1497	1448	1448	She	160	“ And do n’t you know ? ”
1498	1519	1521	1521	she	160	“ Yes , I think I do . I think my coming back home was just reculer pour mieux sauter . ”
1534	1538	1540	1540	Ursula	255	“ I know ! ”
1556	1564	1540	1540	Ursula	255	“ But where can one jump to ? ”
1565	1573	1575	1575	Gudrun	160	“ Oh , it does n’t matter , ”
1580	1595	1575	1575	Gudrun	160	“ If one jumps over the edge , one is bound to land somewhere . ”
1596	1604	1606	1606	Ursula	255	“ But is n’t it very risky ? ”
1618	1621	1622	1622	she	160	“ Ah ! ”
1626	1634	1622	1622	she	160	“ What is it all but words ! ”
1649	1665	1666	1666	she	160	“ And how do you find home , now you have come back to it ? ”
1691	1700	1688	1688	she	160	“ I find myself completely out of it . ”
1701	1705	1688	1688	she	160	“ And father ? ”
1721	1733	1734	1734	she	160	“ I have n’t thought about him : I ’ve refrained , ”
1738	1741	1743	1743	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
1803	1814	1815	1815	she	160	“ Shall we go out and look at that wedding ? ”
1828	1831	1833	1833	Ursula	255	“ Yes ! ”
2144	2154	2156	2156	Gudrun	160	“ It is like a country in an underworld , ”
2158	2233	2156	2156	Gudrun	160	“ The colliers bring it above - ground with them , shovel it up . Ursula , it ’s marvellous , it ’s really marvellous — it ’s really wonderful , another world . The people are all ghouls , and everything is ghostly . Everything is a ghoulish replica of the real world , a replica , a ghoul , all soiled , everything sordid . It ’s like being mad , Ursula . ”
2588	2615	2574	2574	her	160	“ I want to go back , I want to go away , I want not to know it , not to know that this exists . ”
2628	2637	2638	2638	she	160	“ You hate this , do n’t you ? ”
2641	2646	2648	2648	Gudrun	160	“ It bewilders me , ”
2650	2657	2659	2659	Ursula	255	“ You wo n’t stay long , ”
2850	2856	2858	2858	Gudrun	160	“ Let us go back , ”
2863	2870	2858	2858	Gudrun	160	“ There are all those people . ”
2879	2884	2886	2886	Ursula	255	“ Never mind them , ”
2888	2904	2886	2886	Ursula	255	“ they ’re all right . They all know me , they do n’t matter . ”
2905	2913	2915	2915	Gudrun	160	“ But must we go through them ? ”
2917	2926	2928	2928	Ursula	255	“ They ’re quite all right , really , ”
3026	3032	3020	3021	a policeman	539	“ What price the stockings ! ”
3098	3107	3108	3108	she	540	“ I wo n’t go into the church , ”
3308	3316	3318	3318	Gudrun	160	“ Are we going to stay here ? ”
3320	3328	3330	3330	Ursula	255	“ I was only resting a minute , ”
3338	3358	3330	3330	Ursula	255	“ We will stand in the corner by the fives - court , we shall see everything from there . ”
3884	3891	3892	3892	she	160	“ His totem is the wolf , ”
3897	3907	3892	3892	she	160	“ His mother is an old , unbroken wolf . ”
3954	3958	3959	3959	she	160	“ Good God ! ”
3964	3969	3959	3959	she	160	“ what is this ? ”
3982	3991	3977	3977	she	160	“ I shall know more of that man . ”
4056	4083	4084	4084	she	160	“ Am I really singled out for him in some way , is there really some pale gold , arctic light that envelopes only us two ? ”
5809	5816	5823	5825	the expectant people	649	“ How do I get out ? ”
5903	5909	5910	5910	she	636	“ That ’s done it ! ”
6171	6176	6177	6177	she	665	“ Tibs ! Tibs ! ”
6213	6216	6217	6217	she	665	“ Tibs ! ”
6275	6282	6284	6284	her	665	“ Ah - h - h ! ”
6359	6365	6367	6370	the vulgar women below	679	“ Ay , after her ! ”
6541	6549	6551	6551	Birkin	169	“ We ’ll bring up the rear , ”
6560	6563	6565	6566	the father	646	“ Ay ! ”
6777	6786	6787	6787	he	171	“ I ’m sorry we are so late , ”
6791	6820	6787	6787	he	171	“ We could n’t find a button - hook , so it took us a long time to button our boots . But you were to the moment . ”
6821	6828	6830	6831	Mr Crich	171	“ We are usually to time , ”
6833	6840	6842	6842	Birkin	169	“ And I ’m always late , ”
6844	6861	6842	6842	Birkin	169	“ But today I was really punctual , only accidentally not so . I ’m sorry . ”
6999	7008	7009	7009	she	694	“ What do you think of Rupert Birkin ? ”
7027	7036	7038	7038	Gudrun	160	“ What do I think of Rupert Birkin ? ”
7040	7087	7038	7038	Gudrun	160	“ I think he ’s attractive — decidedly attractive . What I ca n’t stand about him is his way with other people — his way of treating any little fool as if she were his greatest consideration . One feels so awfully sold , oneself . ”
7088	7095	7097	7097	Ursula	255	“ Why does he do it ? ”
7099	7115	7117	7117	Gudrun	160	“ Because he has no real critical faculty — of people , at all events , ”
7119	7143	7117	7117	Gudrun	160	“ I tell you , he treats any little fool as he treats me or you — and it ’s such an insult . ”
7144	7150	7152	7152	Ursula	255	“ Oh , it is , ”
7154	7159	7152	7152	Ursula	255	“ One must discriminate . ”
7160	7165	7167	7167	Gudrun	160	“ One must discriminate , ”
7169	7192	7167	7167	Gudrun	160	“ But he ’s a wonderful chap , in other respects — a marvellous personality . But you ca n’t trust him . ”
7193	7196	7198	7198	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
8063	8071	8057	8059	one Crich woman	731	“ Helen , come here a minute , ”
8072	8081	8057	8059	one Crich woman	731	“ Marjory , I want you — here . ”
8082	8090	8057	8059	one Crich woman	731	“ Oh , I say , Mrs Witham—. ”
8244	8251	8253	8253	Gerald	255	“ What is it , mother ? ”
8255	8260	8261	8261	she	165	“ Nothing , nothing ! ”
8284	8293	8294	8294	she	165	“ How do you do , Mr Birkin , ”
8320	8325	8327	8327	Birkin	169	“ Oh Mrs Crich , ”
8336	8345	8330	8330	his	740	“ I could n’t come to you before . ”
8346	8356	8357	8357	she	165	“ I do n’t know half the people here , ”
8375	8383	8385	8385	Birkin	169	“ And you do n’t like strangers ? ”
8387	8421	8385	8385	Birkin	169	“ I myself can never see why one should take account of people , just because they happen to be in the room with one : why should I know they are there ? ”
8422	8429	8435	8435	her	165	“ Why indeed , why indeed ! ”
8441	8508	8435	8435	her	165	“ Except that they are there . I do n’t know people whom I find in the house . The children introduce them to me—‘Mother , this is Mr So - and - so . ’ I am no further . What has Mr So - and - so to do with his own name?—and what have I to do with either him or his name ? ”
8704	8711	8712	8712	he	743	“ People do n’t really matter , ”
8738	8746	8747	8747	she	565	“ How do you mean , matter ? ”
8751	8760	8761	8761	he	743	“ Not many people are anything at all , ”
8773	8803	8804	8804	She	565	“ They jingle and giggle . It would be much better if they were just wiped out . Essentially , they do n’t exist , they are n’t there . ”
8812	8820	8821	8821	she	565	“ But we did n’t imagine them , ”
8825	8840	8821	8821	she	565	“ There ’s nothing to imagine , that ’s why they do n’t exist . ”
8841	8844	8845	8845	she	565	“ Well , ”
8848	8926	8845	8845	she	565	“ I would hardly go as far as that . There they are , whether they exist or no . It does n’t rest with me to decide on their existence . I only know that I ca n’t be expected to take count of them all . You ca n’t expect me to know them , just because they happen to be there . As far as I go they might as well not be there . ”
8927	8930	8931	8931	he	743	“ Exactly , ”
8934	8939	8940	8940	she	565	“ Might n’t they ? ”
8944	8949	8950	8950	he	743	“ Just as well , ”
8960	8973	8974	8974	she	565	“ Except that they are there , and that ’s a nuisance , ”
8977	8987	8988	8988	she	565	“ There are my sons - in - law , ”
8998	9088	8988	8988	she	565	“ Now Laura ’s got married , there ’s another . And I really do n’t know John from James yet . They come up to me and call me mother . I know what they will say—‘how are you , mother ? ’ I ought to say , ‘ I am not your mother , in any sense . ’ But what is the use ? There they are . I have had children of my own . I suppose I know them from another woman ’s children . ”
9089	9095	9096	9096	he	753	“ One would suppose so , ”
9152	9159	9160	9160	she	754	“ Are my children all there ? ”
9173	9182	9183	9183	he	753	“ I scarcely know them , except Gerald , ”
9186	9189	9190	9190	she	754	“ Gerald ! ”
9193	9218	9190	9190	she	754	“ He ’s the most wanting of them all . You ’d never think it , to look at him now , would you ? ”
9219	9222	9224	9224	Birkin	169	“ No , ”
9243	9246	9247	9247	she	754	“ Ay , ”
9287	9297	9298	9298	she	754	“ I should like him to have a friend , ”
9301	9309	9298	9298	she	754	“ He has never had a friend . ”
9331	9339	9340	9340	he	566	“ Am I my brother ’s keeper ? ”
9578	9616	9617	9617	She	768	“ Wo n’t you come and take your hat off , mother dear ? We shall be sitting down to eat in a minute , and it ’s a formal occasion , darling , is n’t it ? ”
9876	9890	9859	9859	her	790	“ Gerald , you forget father , when you make that unearthly noise . ”
9891	9895	9896	9896	he	255	“ Do I ? ”
9906	9918	9969	9976	the girl with the hair down her back	793	“ Father is lying down , he is not quite well . ”
9919	9926	9930	9932	the married daughters	792	“ How is he , really ? ”
9954	9965	9967	9967	Winifred	186	“ He has no pain , but he feels tired , ”
10041	10048	10031	10031	she	565	“ Who is that young man ? ”
10049	10055	10031	10031	she	565	“ I do n’t know , ”
10060	10067	10068	10068	she	565	“ Have I seen him before ? ”
10071	10082	10083	10083	he	798	“ I do n’t think so . I have n’t , ”
10183	10186	10188	10188	Diana	188	“ Mother , ”
10199	10209	10188	10188	Diana	188	“ I may have wine , may n’t I ? ”
10210	10218	10225	10225	she	565	“ Yes , you may have wine , ”
10244	10251	10252	10252	she	188	“ Gerald should n’t forbid me , ”
10262	10268	10270	10271	her brother	807	“ All right , Di , ”
10367	10370	10371	10371	she	168	“ No , ”
10374	10399	10371	10371	she	168	“ I think that the appeal to patriotism is a mistake . It is like one house of business rivalling another house of business . ”
10400	10411	10413	10413	Gerald	255	“ Well you can hardly say that , can you ? ”
10423	10452	10413	10413	Gerald	255	“ You could n’t call a race a business concern , could you?—and nationality roughly corresponds to race , I think . I think it is meant to . ”
10472	10481	10482	10482	she	168	“ Do you think race corresponds with nationality ? ”
10506	10526	10527	10527	he	255	“ I think Gerald is right — race is the essential element in nationality , in Europe at least , ”
10552	10595	10544	10544	she	168	“ Yes , but even so , is the patriotic appeal an appeal to the racial instinct ? Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct , the commercial instinct ? And is n’t this what we mean by nationality ? ”
10596	10599	10601	10601	Birkin	169	“ Probably , ”
10628	10637	10638	10638	he	255	“ A race may have its commercial aspect , ”
10641	10683	10638	10638	he	255	“ In fact it must . It is like a family . You must make provision . And to make provision you have got to strive against other families , other nations . I do n’t see why you should n’t . ”
10698	10724	10695	10695	she	168	“ Yes , I think it is always wrong to provoke a spirit of rivalry . It makes bad blood . And bad blood accumulates . ”
10725	10739	10741	10741	Gerald	255	“ But you ca n’t do away with the spirit of emulation altogether ? ”
10743	10756	10741	10741	Gerald	255	“ It is one of the necessary incentives to production and improvement . ”
10757	10760	10762	10762	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
10767	10777	10762	10762	Hermione	168	“ I think you can do away with it . ”
10778	10783	10785	10785	Birkin	169	“ I must say , ”
10787	10795	10785	10785	Birkin	169	“ I detest the spirit of emulation . ”
10827	10835	10836	10836	she	168	“ You do hate it , yes , ”
10843	10847	10848	10848	he	255	“ Detest it , ”
10851	10854	10855	10855	she	168	“ Yes , ”
10862	10865	10866	10866	Gerald	255	“ But , ”
10869	10900	10866	10866	Gerald	255	“ you do n’t allow one man to take away his neighbour ’s living , so why should you allow one nation to take away the living from another nation ? ”
10921	10943	10910	10910	she	168	“ It is not always a question of possessions , is it ? It is not all a question of goods ? ”
10954	10961	10962	10962	he	255	“ Yes , more or less , ”
10965	11007	10962	10962	he	255	“ If I go and take a man ’s hat from off his head , that hat becomes a symbol of that man ’s liberty . When he fights me for his hat , he is fighting me for his liberty . ”
11012	11015	11016	11016	she	168	“ Yes , ”
11021	11057	11016	11016	she	168	“ But that way of arguing by imaginary instances is not supposed to be genuine , is it ? A man does not come and take my hat from off my head , does he ? ”
11058	11066	11068	11068	Gerald	255	“ Only because the law prevents him , ”
11070	11074	11076	11076	Birkin	169	“ Not only , ”
11078	11093	11076	11076	Birkin	169	“ Ninety - nine men out of a hundred do n’t want my hat . ”
11094	11102	11104	11104	Gerald	255	“ That ’s a matter of opinion , ”
11106	11111	11113	11114	the bridegroom	573	“ Or the hat , ”
11116	11130	11132	11132	Birkin	169	“ And if he does want my hat , such as it is , ”
11134	11201	11132	11132	Birkin	169	“ why , surely it is open to me to decide , which is a greater loss to me , my hat , or my liberty as a free and indifferent man . If I am compelled to offer fight , I lose the latter . It is a question which is worth more to me , my pleasant liberty of conduct , or my hat . ”
11202	11205	11207	11207	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
11213	11216	11210	11210	Birkin	169	“ Yes . ”
11217	11232	11233	11234	the bride	636	“ But would you let somebody come and snatch your hat off your head ? ”
11257	11260	11261	11261	she	168	“ No , ”
11277	11292	11261	11261	she	168	“ No , I should n’t let anybody take my hat off my head . ”
11293	11300	11302	11302	Gerald	255	“ How would you prevent it ? ”
11304	11310	11312	11312	Hermione	168	“ I do n’t know , ”
11315	11322	11312	11312	Hermione	168	“ Probably I should kill him . ”
11341	11345	11347	11347	Gerald	255	“ Of course , ”
11349	11375	11347	11347	Gerald	255	“ I can see Rupert ’s point . It is a question to him whether his hat or his peace of mind is more important . ”
11376	11381	11383	11383	Birkin	169	“ Peace of body , ”
11385	11393	11395	11395	Gerald	255	“ Well , as you like there , ”
11397	11410	11395	11395	Gerald	255	“ But how are you going to decide this for a nation ? ”
11411	11416	11418	11418	Birkin	169	“ Heaven preserve me , ”
11420	11429	11430	11430	Gerald	255	“ Yes , but suppose you have to ? ”
11433	11459	11430	11430	Gerald	255	“ Then it is the same . If the national crown - piece is an old hat , then the thieving gent may have it . ”
11460	11473	11475	11475	Gerald	255	“ But can the national or racial hat be an old hat ? ”
11477	11487	11489	11489	Birkin	169	“ Pretty well bound to be , I believe , ”
11491	11498	11500	11500	Gerald	255	“ I ’m not so sure , ”
11502	11510	11512	11512	Hermione	168	“ I do n’t agree , Rupert , ”
11514	11518	11520	11520	Birkin	169	“ All right , ”
11522	11532	11534	11534	Gerald	255	“ I ’m all for the old national hat , ”
11536	11545	11547	11547	Diana	188	“ And a fool you look in it , ”
11559	11574	11547	11547	Diana	188	“ Oh , we ’re quite out of our depths with these old hats , ”
11579	11613	11576	11577	Laura Crich	180	“ Dry up now , Gerald . We ’re going to drink toasts . Let us drink toasts . Toasts — glasses , glasses — now then , toasts ! Speech ! Speech ! ”
11677	11689	11690	11690	he	255	“ Did I do it by accident , or on purpose ? ”
11709	11714	11715	11715	He	255	“ accidentally on purpose . ”
11897	11904	11906	11906	Marshall	190	“ Pretty cattle , very pretty , ”
11917	11927	11906	11906	Marshall	190	“ They give the best milk you can have . ”
11928	11931	11933	11933	Birkin	169	“ Yes , ”
11935	11947	11949	11949	Marshall	190	“ Eh , my little beauty , eh , my beauty ! ”
11972	11980	11981	11981	he	832	“ Who won the race , Lupton ? ”
12005	12009	12010	12010	he	573	“ The race ? ”
12038	12059	12023	12023	He	573	“ We got there together . At least she touched first , but I had my hand on her shoulder . ”
12060	12065	12067	12067	Gerald	255	“ What ’s this ? ”
12082	12085	12087	12087	Gerald	255	“ H’m ! ”
12092	12099	12087	12087	Gerald	255	“ What made you late then ? ”
12100	12111	12113	12113	Birkin	169	“ Lupton would talk about the immortality of the soul , ”
12115	12127	12113	12113	Birkin	169	“ and then he had n’t got a button - hook . ”
12128	12132	12134	12134	Marshall	190	“ Oh God ! ”
12136	12158	12134	12134	Marshall	190	“ The immortality of the soul on your wedding day ! Had n’t you got anything better to occupy your mind ? ”
12159	12166	12168	12169	the bridegroom	573	“ What ’s wrong with it ? ”
12181	12201	12203	12208	the brother - in - law	840	“ Sounds as if you were going to be executed instead of married . The immortality of the soul ! ”
12221	12228	12230	12230	Gerald	255	“ And what did you decide ? ”
12246	12258	12260	12260	Marshall	190	“ You do n’t want a soul today , my boy , ”
12262	12270	12260	12260	Marshall	190	“ It ’d be in your road . ”
12271	12283	12285	12285	Gerald	255	“ Christ ! Marshall , go and talk to somebody else , ”
12291	12299	12301	12301	Marshall	190	“ By God , I ’m willing , ”
12307	12316	12317	12317	He	841	“ Too much bloody soul and talk altogether — ”
12352	12360	12362	12362	Gerald	255	“ There ’s one thing , Lupton , ”
12370	12386	12362	12362	Gerald	255	“ Laura wo n’t have brought such a fool into the family as Lottie did . ”
12387	12393	12395	12395	Birkin	169	“ Comfort yourself with that , ”
12397	12405	12407	12408	the bridegroom	573	“ I take no notice of them , ”
12410	12421	12422	12422	Gerald	255	“ What about this race then — who began it ? ”
12425	12474	12422	12422	Gerald	255	“ We were late . Laura was at the top of the churchyard steps when our cab came up . She saw Lupton bolting towards her . And she fled . But why do you look so cross ? Does it hurt your sense of the family dignity ? ”
12475	12481	12483	12483	Gerald	255	“ It does , rather , ”
12485	12512	12483	12483	Gerald	255	“ If you ’re doing a thing , do it properly , and if you ’re not going to do it properly , leave it alone . ”
12513	12518	12520	12520	Birkin	169	“ Very nice aphorism , ”
12522	12528	12530	12530	Gerald	255	“ Do n’t you agree ? ”
12532	12535	12537	12537	Birkin	169	“ Quite , ”
12539	12551	12537	12537	Birkin	169	“ Only it bores me rather , when you become aphoristic . ”
12552	12567	12569	12569	Gerald	255	“ Damn you , Rupert , you want all the aphorisms your own way , ”
12571	12591	12569	12569	Gerald	255	“ No . I want them out of the way , and you ’re always shoving them in it . ”
12612	12629	12630	12630	he	255	“ You do n’t believe in having any standard of behaviour at all , do you ? ”
12636	12668	12630	12630	he	255	“ Standard — no . I hate standards . But they ’re necessary for the common ruck . Anybody who is anything can just be himself and do as he likes . ”
12669	12679	12681	12681	Gerald	255	“ But what do you mean by being himself ? ”
12683	12692	12681	12681	Gerald	255	“ Is that an aphorism or a cliché ? ”
12693	12766	12600	12600	he	255	“ I mean just doing what you want to do . I think it was perfect good form in Laura to bolt from Lupton to the church door . It was almost a masterpiece in good form . It ’s the hardest thing in the world to act spontaneously on one ’s impulses — and it ’s the only really gentlemanly thing to do — provided you ’re fit to do it . ”
12767	12781	12783	12783	Gerald	255	“ You do n’t expect me to take you seriously , do you ? ”
12785	12804	12783	12783	Gerald	255	“ Yes , Gerald , you ’re one of the very few people I do expect that of . ”
12805	12834	12600	12600	he	255	“ Then I ’m afraid I ca n’t come up to your expectations here , at any rate . You think people should just do as they like . ”
12835	12873	12880	12880	Gerald	255	“ I think they always do . But I should like them to like the purely individual thing in themselves , which makes them act in singleness . And they only like to do the collective thing . ”
12874	12878	12880	12880	Gerald	255	“ And I , ”
12883	12918	12880	12880	Gerald	255	“ should n’t like to be in a world of people who acted individually and spontaneously , as you call it . We should have everybody cutting everybody else ’s throat in five minutes . ”
12919	12932	12934	12934	Birkin	169	“ That means you would like to be cutting everybody ’s throat , ”
12936	12942	12944	12944	Gerald	255	“ How does that follow ? ”
12947	12951	12953	12953	Birkin	169	“ No man , ”
12955	13029	12953	12953	Birkin	169	“ cuts another man ’s throat unless he wants to cut it , and unless the other man wants it cutting . This is a complete truth . It takes two people to make a murder : a murderer and a murderee . And a murderee is a man who is murderable . And a man who is murderable is a man who in a profound if hidden lust desires to be murdered . ”
13030	13037	13039	13039	Gerald	255	“ Sometimes you talk pure nonsense , ”
13043	13075	13039	13039	Gerald	255	“ As a matter of fact , none of us wants our throat cut , and most other people would like to cut it for us — some time or other — ”
13076	13087	13089	13089	Birkin	169	“ It ’s a nasty view of things , Gerald , ”
13091	13105	13089	13089	Birkin	169	“ and no wonder you are afraid of yourself and your own unhappiness . ”
13106	13114	13116	13116	Gerald	255	“ How am I afraid of myself ? ”
13118	13128	13116	13116	Gerald	255	“ and I do n’t think I am unhappy . ”
13129	13156	13157	13157	Birkin	169	“ You seem to have a lurking desire to have your gizzard slit , and imagine every man has his knife up his sleeve for you , ”
13160	13168	13170	13170	Gerald	255	“ How do you make that out ? ”
13172	13176	13178	13178	Birkin	169	“ From you , ”
13697	13703	13705	13705	Birkin	169	“ Did I startle you ? ”
13712	13722	13705	13705	Birkin	169	“ I thought you had heard me come in . ”
13723	13726	13727	13727	she	855	“ No , ”
13750	13756	13757	13757	he	4648	“ It is so dark , ”
13760	13767	13757	13757	he	4648	“ Shall we have the light ? ”
13871	13877	13878	13878	he	4648	“ You are doing catkins ? ”
13897	13914	13915	13915	He	4648	“ Are they as far out as this ? I had n’t noticed them this year . ”
13927	13933	13934	13934	he	4648	“ The red ones too ! ”
14039	14049	14050	14050	he	4648	“ Give them some crayons , wo n’t you ? ”
14053	14104	14050	14050	he	4648	“ so that they can make the gynaecious flowers red , and the androgynous yellow . I ’d chalk them in plain , chalk in nothing else , merely the red and the yellow . Outline scarcely matters in this case . There is just the one fact to emphasise . ”
14105	14112	14114	14114	Ursula	255	“ I have n’t any crayons , ”
14116	14133	14050	14050	he	4648	“ There will be some somewhere — red and yellow , that ’s all you want . ”
14143	14151	14152	14152	she	855	“ It will make the books untidy , ”
14160	14164	14165	14165	he	4648	“ Not very , ”
14168	14248	14165	14165	he	4648	“ You must mark in these things obviously . It ’s the fact you want to emphasise , not the subjective impression to record . What ’s the fact?—red little spiky stigmas of the female flower , dangling yellow male catkin , yellow pollen flying from one to the other . Make a pictorial record of the fact , as a child does when drawing a face — two eyes , one nose , mouth with teeth — so — ”
14285	14291	14292	14292	she	855	“ I saw your car , ”
14297	14318	14292	14292	she	855	“ Do you mind my coming to find you ? I wanted to see you when you were on duty . ”
14365	14374	14392	14392	she	168	“ How do you do , Miss Brangwen , ”
14397	14405	14392	14392	she	168	“ Do you mind my coming in ? ”
14425	14429	14431	14431	Ursula	255	“ Oh no , ”
14433	14438	14431	14431	Ursula	255	“ Are you sure ? ”
14457	14466	14468	14468	Ursula	255	“ Oh no , I like it awfully , ”
14519	14525	14526	14526	she	168	“ What are you doing ? ”
14536	14539	14540	14540	he	867	“ Catkins , ”
14543	14546	14547	14547	she	168	“ Really ! ”
14550	14559	14547	14547	she	168	“ And what do you learn about them ? ”
14708	14729	14730	14730	he	867	“ Do you know the little red ovary flowers , that produce the nuts ? Have you ever noticed them ? ”
14751	14754	14755	14755	she	168	“ No , ”
14758	14763	14755	14755	she	168	“ What are they ? ”
14764	14788	14735	14735	he	867	“ Those are the little seed - producing flowers , and the long catkins , they only produce pollen , to fertilise them . ”
14789	14796	14798	14798	Hermione	168	“ Do they , do they ! ”
14803	14823	14798	14798	Hermione	168	“ From those little red bits , the nuts come ; if they receive pollen from the long danglers . ”
14824	14833	14837	14837	herself	168	“ Little red flames , little red flames , ”
14862	14875	14876	14876	she	168	“ Are n’t they beautiful ? I think they ’re so beautiful , ”
14897	14905	14906	14906	he	867	“ Had you never noticed them before ? ”
14909	14915	14916	14916	she	168	“ No , never before , ”
14919	14928	14929	14929	he	867	“ And now you will always see them , ”
14932	14940	14941	14941	she	168	“ Now I shall always see them , ”
14944	14964	14941	14941	she	168	“ Thank you so much for showing me . I think they ’re so beautiful — little red flames — ”
15097	15104	15105	15105	she	168	“ Your sister has come home ? ”
15108	15111	15113	15113	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
15115	15125	15105	15105	she	168	“ And does she like being back in Beldover ? ”
15126	15129	15131	15131	Ursula	255	“ No , ”
15133	15186	15131	15131	Ursula	255	“ No , I wonder she can bear it . It takes all my strength , to bear the ugliness of this district , when I stay here . Wo n’t you come and see me ? Wo n’t you come with your sister to stay at Breadalby for a few days?—do — ”
15187	15193	15195	15195	Ursula	255	“ Thank you very much , ”
15197	15205	15207	15207	Hermione	168	“ Then I will write to you , ”
15209	15259	15207	15207	Hermione	168	“ You think your sister will come ? I should be so glad . I think she is wonderful . I think some of her work is really wonderful . I have two water - wagtails , carved in wood , and painted — perhaps you have seen it ? ”
15260	15263	15265	15265	Ursula	255	“ No , ”
15267	15281	15265	15265	Ursula	255	“ I think it is perfectly wonderful — like a flash of instinct . ”
15282	15289	15291	15291	Ursula	255	“ Her little carvings are strange , ”
15293	15302	15291	15291	Ursula	255	“ Perfectly beautiful — full of primitive passion — ”
15303	15362	15363	15363	Hermione	168	“ Is n’t it queer that she always likes little things?—she must always work small things , that one can put between one ’s hands , birds and tiny animals . She likes to look through the wrong end of the opera glasses , and see the world that way — why is it , do you think ? ”
15381	15384	15386	15386	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
15390	15406	15386	15386	Hermione	168	“ It is curious . The little things seem to be more subtle to her — ”
15407	15430	15432	15432	Hermione	168	“ But they are n’t , are they ? A mouse is n’t any more subtle than a lion , is it ? ”
15464	15470	15471	15471	she	870	“ I do n’t know , ”
15474	15479	15480	15480	she	870	“ Rupert , Rupert , ”
15494	15504	15505	15505	she	870	“ Are little things more subtle than big things ? ”
15530	15533	15534	15534	he	871	“ Dunno , ”
15537	15542	15544	15544	Ursula	255	“ I hate subtleties , ”
15552	15556	15557	15557	she	870	“ Do you ? ”
15560	15571	15573	15573	Ursula	255	“ I always think they are a sign of weakness , ”
15612	15620	15621	15621	she	870	“ Do you really think , Rupert , ”
15631	15655	15621	15621	she	870	“ do you really think it is worth while ? Do you really think the children are better for being roused to consciousness ? ”
15697	15705	15706	15706	he	872	“ They are not roused to consciousness , ”
15709	15719	15684	15684	her	873	“ Consciousness comes to them , willy - nilly . ”
15720	15771	15680	15681	the woman	873	“ But do you think they are better for having it quickened , stimulated ? Is n’t it better that they should remain unconscious of the hazel , is n’t it better that they should see as a whole , without all this pulling to pieces , all this knowledge ? ”
15772	15799	15800	15800	he	872	“ Would you rather , for yourself , know or not know , that the little red flowers are there , putting out for the pollen ? ”
15829	15835	15836	15836	she	168	“ I do n’t know , ”
15842	15848	15836	15836	she	168	“ I do n’t know . ”
15849	15863	15864	15864	he	872	“ But knowing is everything to you , it is all your life , ”
15874	15878	15879	15879	she	168	“ Is it ? ”
15882	15904	15905	15905	he	872	“ To know , that is your all , that is your life — you have only this , this knowledge , ”
15908	15925	15905	15905	he	872	“ There is only one tree , there is only one fruit , in your mouth . ”
15933	15937	15938	15938	she	168	“ Is there ? ”
15958	15964	15938	15938	she	168	“ What fruit , Rupert ? ”
15965	15970	15971	15971	he	872	“ The eternal apple , ”
15981	15984	15985	15985	she	168	“ Yes , ”
16026	16098	16007	16007	herself	168	“ But leaving me apart , Rupert ; do you think the children are better , richer , happier , for all this knowledge ; do you really think they are ? Or is it better to leave them untouched , spontaneous . Had n’t they better be animals , simple animals , crude , violent , anything , rather than this self - consciousness , this incapacity to be spontaneous . ”
16116	16150	16113	16113	she	168	“ Had n’t they better be anything than grow up crippled , crippled in their souls , crippled in their feelings — so thrown back — so turned back on themselves — incapable — ”
16159	16176	16111	16111	her	168	trance—“of any spontaneous action , always deliberate , always burdened with choice , never carried away . ”
16197	16243	16193	16193	she	168	rhapsody—“never carried away , out of themselves , always conscious , always self - conscious , always aware of themselves . Is n’t anything better than this ? Better be animals , mere animals with no mind at all , than this , this nothingness — ”
16244	16261	16262	16262	he	875	“ But do you think it is knowledge that makes us unliving and self - conscious ? ”
16276	16279	16280	16280	she	168	“ Yes , ”
16315	16321	16322	16322	she	168	“ It is the mind , ”
16325	16331	16322	16322	she	168	“ and that is death . ”
16340	16346	16347	16347	she	168	“ Is n’t the mind — ”
16358	16396	16347	16347	she	168	“ is n’t it our death ? Does n’t it destroy all our spontaneity , all our instincts ? Are not the young people growing up today , really dead before they have a chance to live ? ”
16397	16410	16411	16411	he	875	“ Not because they have too much mind , but too little , ”
16415	16420	16421	16421	she	168	“ Are you sure ? ”
16424	16444	16421	16421	she	168	“ It seems to me the reverse . They are over - conscious , burdened to death with consciousness . ”
16445	16456	16457	16457	he	875	“ Imprisoned within a limited , false set of concepts , ”
16477	16491	16492	16492	she	168	“ When we have knowledge , do n’t we lose everything but knowledge ? ”
16496	16562	16492	16492	she	168	“ If I know about the flower , do n’t I lose the flower and have only the knowledge ? Are n’t we exchanging the substance for the shadow , are n’t we forfeiting life for this dead quality of knowledge ? And what does it mean to me , after all ? What does all this knowing mean to me ? It means nothing . ”
16563	16570	16571	16571	he	875	“ You are merely making words , ”
16574	16717	16571	16571	he	875	“ knowledge means everything to you . Even your animalism , you want it in your head . You do n’t want to be an animal , you want to observe your own animal functions , to get a mental thrill out of them . It is all purely secondary — and more decadent than the most hide - bound intellectualism . What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism , this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts ? Passion and the instincts — you want them hard enough , but through your head , in your consciousness . It all takes place in your head , under that skull of yours . Only you wo n’t be conscious of what actually is : you want the lie that will match the rest of your furniture . ”
16747	16757	16758	16758	he	878	“ It ’s all that Lady of Shalott business , ”
16778	16854	16855	16855	He	878	“ You ’ve got that mirror , your own fixed will , your immortal understanding , your own tight conscious world , and there is nothing beyond it . There , in the mirror , you must have everything . But now you have come to all your conclusions , you want to go back and be like a savage , without knowledge . You want a life of pure sensation and ‘ passion . ’ ”
16883	16891	16892	16892	he	878	“ But your passion is a lie , ”
16897	16981	16892	16892	he	878	“ It is n’t passion at all , it is your will . It ’s your bullying will . You want to clutch things and have them in your power . You want to have things in your power . And why ? Because you have n’t got any real body , any dark sensual body of life . You have no sensuality . You have only your will and your conceit of consciousness , and your lust for power , to know . ”
17046	17049	17050	17050	he	878	“ Spontaneous ! ”
17053	17198	17050	17050	he	878	“ You and spontaneity ! You , the most deliberate thing that ever walked or crawled ! You ’d be verily deliberately spontaneous — that ’s you . Because you want to have everything in your own volition , your deliberate voluntary consciousness . You want it all in that loathsome little skull of yours , that ought to be cracked like a nut . For you ’ll be the same till it is cracked , like an insect in its skin . If one cracked your skull perhaps one might get a spontaneous , passionate woman out of you , with real sensuality . As it is , what you want is pornography — looking at yourself in mirrors , watching your naked animal actions in mirrors , so that you can have it all in your consciousness , make it all mental . ”
17244	17252	17253	17253	she	880	“ But do you really want sensuality ? ”
17270	17273	17274	17274	he	881	“ Yes , ”
17277	17327	17274	17274	he	881	“ that and nothing else , at this point . It is a fulfilment — the great dark knowledge you ca n’t have in your head — the dark involuntary being . It is death to one ’s self — but it is the coming into being of another . ”
17328	17342	17343	17343	she	880	“ But how ? How can you have knowledge not in your head ? ”
17353	17358	17359	17359	he	881	“ In the blood , ”
17362	17397	17359	17359	he	881	“ when the mind and the known world is drowned in darkness everything must go — there must be the deluge . Then you find yourself a palpable body of darkness , a demon — ”
17398	17408	17409	17409	she	880	“ But why should I be a demon — ? ”
17412	17422	17423	17423	he	881	“ ‘ Woman wailing for her demon lover ’ — ”
17424	17431	17455	17455	she	880	quoted—“why , I do n’t know . ”
17442	17454	17455	17455	she	880	“ He is such a dreadful satanist , is n’t he ? ”
17511	17514	17515	17515	he	881	“ No , ”
17518	17531	17515	17515	he	881	“ You are the real devil who wo n’t let life exist . ”
17547	17558	17559	17559	she	168	“ You know all about it , do n’t you ? ”
17570	17573	17574	17574	he	881	“ Enough , ”
17615	17625	17626	17626	she	168	“ You are sure you will come to Breadalby ? ”
17631	17641	17643	17643	Ursula	255	“ Yes , I should like to very much , ”
17669	17675	17676	17676	she	168	“ I ’m so glad , ”
17683	17733	17676	17676	she	168	“ Some time in about a fortnight . Yes ? I will write to you here , at the school , shall I ? Yes . And you ’ll be sure to come ? Yes . I shall be so glad . Good - bye ! Good - bye ! ”
17832	17842	17843	17843	he	4658	“ There ’s the whole difference in the world , ”
17846	17944	17843	17843	he	4658	“ between the actual sensual being , and the vicious mental - deliberate profligacy our lot goes in for . In our night - time , there ’s always the electricity switched on , we watch ourselves , we get it all in the head , really . You ’ve got to lapse out before you can know what sensual reality is , lapse into unknowingness , and give up your volition . You ’ve got to do it . You ’ve got to learn not - to - be , before you can come into being . “
18011	18147	17992	17992	We	888	” There was silence in the room . Both women were hostile and resentful . He sounded as if he were addressing a meeting . Hermione merely paid no attention , stood with her shoulders tight in a shrug of dislike . Ursula was watching him as if furtively , not really aware of what she was seeing . There was a great physical attractiveness in him — a curious hidden richness , that came through his thinness and his pallor like another voice , conveying another knowledge of him . It was in the curves of his brows and his chin , rich , fine , exquisite curves , the powerful beauty of life itself . She could not say what it was . But there was a sense of richness and of liberty . “
18163	18209	18161	18161	we	888	” she asked , turning to him with a certain golden laughter flickering under her greenish eyes , like a challenge . And immediately the queer , careless , terribly attractive smile came over his eyes and brows , though his mouth did not relax . “
18212	18216	18161	18161	we	888	” he said , “
18228	18229	18221	18221	We	888	” “
18239	18243	18221	18221	We	888	” she cried . “
18249	18255	18221	18221	We	888	” She was frankly puzzled . “
18272	18276	18258	18258	you	889	” she asked . “
18325	18326	18322	18322	they	579	” “
18336	18348	18334	18334	you	889	” said Hermione , turning to Ursula with a gracious kindliness . “
18355	18833	18349	18349	You	889	” Birkin stopped short . A spasm of anger and chagrin went over Ursula . His face set . And he bade good - bye , as if he had ceased to notice her . They were gone . Ursula stood looking at the door for some moments . Then she put out the lights . And having done so , she sat down again in her chair , absorbed and lost . And then she began to cry , bitterly , bitterly weeping : but whether for misery or joy , she never knew . The week passed away . On the Saturday it rained , a soft drizzling rain that held off at times . In one of the intervals Gudrun and Ursula set out for a walk , going towards Willey Water . The atmosphere was grey and translucent , the birds sang sharply on the young twigs , the earth would be quickening and hastening in growth . The two girls walked swiftly , gladly , because of the soft , subtle rush of morning that filled the wet haze . By the road the black - thorn was in blossom , white and wet , its tiny amber grains burning faintly in the white smoke of blossom . Purple twigs were darkly luminous in the grey air , high hedges glowed like living shadows , hovering nearer , coming into creation . The morning was full of a new creation . When the sisters came to Willey Water , the lake lay all grey and visionary , stretching into the moist , translucent vista of trees and meadow . Fine electric activity in sound came from the dumbles below the road , the birds piping one against the other , and water mysteriously plashing , issuing from the lake . The two girls drifted swiftly along . In front of them , at the corner of the lake , near the road , was a mossy boat - house under a walnut tree , and a little landing - stage where a boat was moored , wavering like a shadow on the still grey water , below the green , decayed poles . All was shadowy with coming summer . Suddenly , from the boat - house , a white figure ran out , frightening in its swift sharp transit , across the old landing - stage . It launched in a white arc through the air , there was a bursting of the water , and among the smooth ripples a swimmer was making out to space , in a centre of faintly heaving motion . The whole otherworld , wet and remote , he had to himself . He could move into the pure translucency of the grey , uncreated water . Gudrun stood by the stone wall , watching . “
18839	18849	18835	18835	I	0	” she said , in low , desirous tones . “
18852	18856	18835	18835	I	0	” shivered Ursula . “
18860	18861	18835	18835	I	0	” “
18877	18916	18349	18349	You	889	” The sisters stood watching the swimmer move further into the grey , moist , full space of the water , pulsing with his own small , invading motion , and arched over with mist and dim woods . “
18925	18933	18919	18919	you	0	” asked Gudrun , looking at Ursula . “
18937	18941	18934	18934	I	0	” said Ursula . “
18953	18954	18349	18349	You	889	” “
18957	19029	18349	18349	You	889	” said Gudrun , reluctantly . She stood watching the motion on the bosom of the water , as if fascinated . He , having swum a certain distance , turned round and was swimming on his back , looking along the water at the two girls by the wall . In the faint wash of motion , they could see his ruddy face , and could feel him watching them . “
19035	19039	19040	19040	I	0	” said Ursula . “
19043	19162	19163	19163	He	893	” replied Gudrun . And she stood motionless gazing over the water at the face which washed up and down on the flood , as he swam steadily . From his separate element he saw them and he exulted to himself because of his own advantage , his possession of a world to himself . He was immune and perfect . He loved his own vigorous , thrusting motion , and the violent impulse of the very cold water against his limbs , buoying him up . He could see the girls watching him a way off , outside , and that pleased him . He lifted his arm from the water , in a sign to them . “
19167	19171	19163	19163	He	893	” said Ursula . “
19174	19196	19163	19163	He	893	” replied Gudrun . They watched him . He waved again , with a strange movement of recognition across the difference . “
19201	19331	19163	19163	He	893	” laughed Ursula . Gudrun said nothing , only stood still looking over the water . Gerald suddenly turned , and was swimming away swiftly , with a side stroke . He was alone now , alone and immune in the middle of the waters , which he had all to himself . He exulted in his isolation in the new element , unquestioned and unconditioned . He was happy , thrusting with his legs and all his body , without bond or connection anywhere , just himself in the watery world . Gudrun envied him almost painfully . Even this momentary possession of pure isolation and fluidity seemed to her so terribly desirable that she felt herself as if damned , out there on the high - road . “
19342	19346	19332	19332	God	167	” she cried . “
19349	19355	19332	19332	God	167	” exclaimed Ursula in surprise . “
19365	19374	19332	19332	God	167	” cried Gudrun , strangely flushed and brilliant . “
19405	19425	19391	19391	You	4648	” Ursula wondered what was in Gudrun ’s mind , to occasion this outburst . She could not understand . “
19433	19437	19428	19428	you	4648	” she asked . “
19440	19448	19428	19428	you	4648	” cried Gudrun , in swift refutation . “
19502	19573	19637	19637	you	900	” She was so hot , so flushed , so furious , that Ursula was puzzled . The two sisters went on , up the road . They were passing between the trees just below Shortlands . They looked up at the long , low house , dim and glamorous in the wet morning , its cedar trees slanting before the windows . Gudrun seemed to be studying it closely . “
19584	19588	19582	19582	Ursula	255	” asked Gudrun . “
19591	19595	19582	19582	Ursula	255	” said Ursula . “
19601	19602	19582	19582	Ursula	255	” “
19614	19615	19582	19582	Ursula	255	” “
19619	19620	19582	19582	Ursula	255	” “
19640	19644	19637	19637	you	900	” Ursula laughed . “
19651	19655	19647	19647	you	900	” repeated Gudrun . “
19694	19701	19671	19671	Gerald	255	” Gudrun shrugged her shoulders swiftly . “
19705	19709	19671	19671	Gerald	255	” she said , “
19715	19716	19671	19671	Gerald	255	” “
19719	19723	19671	19671	Gerald	255	” laughed Ursula . “
19788	19789	19781	19781	He	255	” “
19797	19801	19792	19792	he	255	” said Gudrun . “
19834	19835	19837	19837	I	0	” “
19840	19844	19837	19837	I	0	” said Ursula . “
19853	19854	19837	19837	I	0	” “
19857	19861	19837	19837	I	0	” said Gudrun . “
19869	19873	19864	19864	he	255	” said Ursula . “
19878	19888	19864	19864	he	255	” cried Gudrun , frowning as if in disapprobation . “
19942	19943	19911	19911	He	255	” “
19947	19951	19911	19911	He	255	” cried Gudrun . “
19958	19959	19911	19911	He	255	” “
19968	19972	19973	19973	I	0	” said Ursula . “
19986	19987	19989	19989	he	255	” “
20001	20002	19989	19989	he	255	” “
20052	20053	19989	19989	he	255	” “
20056	20060	19989	19989	he	255	” cried Gudrun . “
20165	20166	20196	20196	you	0	” “
20176	20180	20196	20196	you	0	” said Ursula . “
20199	20200	20196	20196	you	0	” “
20203	20213	20214	20214	I	0	” said Gudrun , coldly , stiffening a little . “
20263	20264	20228	20229	one boy	919	” “
20267	20271	20228	20229	one boy	919	” said Ursula . “
20308	20320	20344	20344	one	4646	” Gudrun was silent for some moments , in sharp disagreement . “
20324	20329	20344	20344	one	4646	” she said coldly . “
20362	20370	20358	20358	boys	928	” Her voice was cold and angry . “
20373	20393	20358	20358	boys	928	” persisted Ursula . At that moment they heard a woman ’s voice a few yards off say loudly : “
20399	20445	20358	20358	boys	928	” They went forward and saw Laura Crich and Hermione Roddice in the field on the other side of the hedge , and Laura Crich struggling with the gate , to get out . Ursula at once hurried up and helped to lift the gate . “
20450	20466	20358	20358	boys	928	” said Laura , looking up flushed and amazon - like , yet rather confused . “
20475	20476	20358	20358	boys	928	” “
20479	20483	20358	20358	boys	928	” said Ursula . “
20490	20491	20358	20358	boys	928	” “
20494	20498	20358	20358	boys	928	” cried Laura . “
20504	20523	20501	20501	you	929	” sang Hermione , from out of the field , the moment she could make her voice heard . “
20587	20670	20671	20671	I	0	” Gudrun and Ursula stood and watched her slowly waving her head up and down , and waving her hand slowly in dismissal , smiling a strange affected smile , making a tall queer , frightening figure , with her heavy fair hair slipping to her eyes . Then they moved off , as if they had been dismissed like inferiors . The four women parted . As soon as they had gone far enough , Ursula said , her cheeks burning , “
20678	20679	20674	20674	she	931	” “
20685	20689	20682	20683	Hermione Roddice	168	” asked Gudrun . “
20692	20693	20696	20696	she	931	” “
20702	20703	20696	20696	she	931	” “
20717	20723	20724	20724	Her	931	” asked Gudrun rather coldly . “
20772	20773	20774	20774	I	0	” “
20790	20798	20782	20782	you	255	” said Gudrun , in some exasperation . “
20817	20818	20806	20815	these free women who have emancipated themselves from the aristocracy	937	” “
20828	20832	20806	20815	these free women who have emancipated themselves from the aristocracy	937	” cried Ursula . “
20866	20867	20853	20853	I	0	” “
20875	20879	20869	20869	you	255	” asked Ursula . “
20891	20892	20888	20888	she	931	” “
20908	20918	20896	20896	she	931	” Gudrun lifted her shoulders in a low shrug . “
20937	20941	20922	20922	she	931	” said Gudrun . “
20981	20989	20976	20976	herself	168	” Ursula pondered this for a time . “
20994	20998	20990	20990	I	0	” she replied . “
21025	21026	21013	21013	she	168	” “
21029	21033	21013	21013	she	168	” said Gudrun . “
21073	21074	21058	21058	I	0	” “
21077	21081	21058	21058	I	0	” said Ursula . “
21104	21138	21096	21096	her	168	” The two sisters were like a pair of scissors , snipping off everything that came athwart them ; or like a knife and a whetstone , the one sharpened against the other . “
21142	21147	21096	21096	her	168	” cried Ursula suddenly , “
21219	21220	21181	21181	my	0	” “
21223	21227	21181	21181	my	0	” said Gudrun . “
21237	21241	21181	21181	my	0	” said Ursula . “
21246	21250	21181	21181	my	0	” said Gudrun . “
21302	21303	21300	21300	her	168	” “
21307	21311	21314	21314	Ursula	255	” cried Ursula . “
21349	21350	21300	21300	her	168	” “
21362	21366	21300	21300	her	168	” laughed Ursula . “
21370	21374	21376	21376	Ursula	255	” retorted Gudrun . “
21405	21417	21400	21400	Corneille	200	” Gudrun was becoming flushed and excited over her own cleverness . “
21420	21424	21400	21400	Corneille	200	” said Ursula . “
21437	21438	21425	21425	One	4646	” “
21441	21445	21425	21425	One	4646	” cried Gudrun , “
21451	21452	21425	21425	One	4646	” “
21463	21471	21453	21453	They	954	” cried Ursula , with mocking laughter . “
21523	21538	21509	21509	I	0	” Gudrun looked up at Ursula with a queer , uncertain envy and dislike . “
21556	21936	21550	21550	them	954	” she said . The sisters went home again , to read and talk and work , and wait for Monday , for school . Ursula often wondered what else she waited for , besides the beginning and end of the school week , and the beginning and end of the holidays . This was a whole life ! Sometimes she had periods of tight horror , when it seemed to her that her life would pass away , and be gone , without having been more than this . But she never really accepted it . Her spirit was active , her life like a shoot that is growing steadily , but which has not yet come above ground . One day at this time Birkin was called to London . He was not very fixed in his abode . He had rooms in Nottingham , because his work lay chiefly in that town . But often he was in London , or in Oxford . He moved about a great deal , his life seemed uncertain , without any definite rhythm , any organic meaning . On the platform of the railway station he saw Gerald Crich , reading a newspaper , and evidently waiting for the train . Birkin stood some distance off , among the people . It was against his instinct to approach anybody . From time to time , in a manner characteristic of him , Gerald lifted his head and looked round . Even though he was reading the newspaper closely , he must keep a watchful eye on his external surroundings . There seemed to be a dual consciousness running in him . He was thinking vigorously of something he read in the newspaper , and at the same time his eye ran over the surfaces of the life round him , and he missed nothing . Birkin , who was watching him , was irritated by his duality . He noticed too , that Gerald seemed always to be at bay against everybody , in spite of his queer , genial , social manner when roused . Now Birkin started violently at seeing this genial look flash on to Gerald ’s face , at seeing Gerald approaching with hand outstretched . “
21946	21947	21943	21943	you	169	” “
21957	21958	21952	21952	you	169	” “
21961	21973	21952	21952	you	169	” Gerald ’s eyes went over Birkin ’s face in curiosity . “
21982	21986	21974	21974	We	957	” he said . “
21994	21998	21999	21999	I	0	” asked Birkin . “
22006	22010	21999	21999	I	0	” replied Gerald . “
22029	22045	21974	21974	We	957	” The two men looked at the station clock , having nothing further to say . “
22054	22064	22048	22048	you	169	” Birkin asked . Gerald looked at him quickly . “
22078	22082	22071	22071	they	960	” he said . “
22088	22096	22085	22086	two leaders	961	” he held out his Daily Telegraph , “
22105	22110	22085	22086	two leaders	961	” he scanned the columns down—“and
22178	22179	22180	22180	I	0	” “
22194	22198	22180	22180	I	0	” said Birkin . “
22212	22216	22203	22204	the man	4658	” said Gerald . “
22222	22279	22203	22204	the man	4658	” said Birkin , holding out his hand for the paper . The train came , and they went on board , sitting on either side a little table , by the window , in the restaurant car . Birkin glanced over his paper , then looked up at Gerald , who was waiting for him . “
22287	22291	22282	22283	the man	4658	” he said , “
22299	22300	22295	22295	he	4658	” “
22319	22328	22310	22310	you	0	” asked Gerald . Birkin shrugged his shoulders . “
22412	22418	22419	22419	You	0	” Gerald watched him closely . “
22435	22439	22419	22419	You	0	” he asked . “
22474	22495	22499	22499	you	0	” There was a queer little smile in Gerald ’s eyes , a look of amusement , calm and curious . “
22516	22539	22499	22499	you	0	” he asked . Birkin had a slight , tense frown between the brows . He too was impatient of the conversation . “
22547	22551	22540	22540	I	0	” he replied . “
22593	22618	22540	22540	I	0	” The little smile began to die out of Gerald ’s eyes , and he said , looking with a cool stare at Birkin : “
22628	22629	22620	22620	you	0	” “
22633	22639	22620	22620	you	0	” The smile appeared again . “
22644	22645	22620	22620	you	0	” “
22649	22653	22654	22654	We	967	” said Birkin . “
22763	22778	22780	22780	you	980	” Gerald took a little time to re - adjust himself after this tirade . “
22791	22795	22780	22780	you	980	” he asked . “
22834	22849	22852	22852	you	980	” Again Gerald pondered . He was not going to take offence at Birkin . “
22885	22886	22852	22852	you	980	” “
22889	22893	22852	22852	you	980	” cried Birkin . “
23025	23026	23027	23027	I	0	” “
23032	23036	23027	23027	I	0	” laughed Gerald . “
23042	23046	23027	23027	I	0	” said Birkin , “
23099	23100	23101	23101	You	0	” “
23110	23119	23101	23101	You	0	” said Gerald . Which statement Birkin ignored . “
23143	23147	23101	23101	You	0	” said Gerald . “
23151	23155	23101	23101	You	0	” said Birkin . “
23162	23169	23158	23158	you	0	” Gerald ’s face went baffled . “
23176	23180	23181	23181	I	0	” he repeated . “
23213	23214	23209	23209	I	0	” “
23308	23330	23331	23331	We	991	” Gerald sat laughing at the words and the mocking humour of the other man . But he was cogitating too . “
23338	23342	23331	23331	We	991	” he replied . “
23360	23361	23343	23346	A good many people	997	” “
23374	23382	23368	23368	I	0	” said Birkin , mocking at Gerald . “
23387	23422	23423	23423	Gerald	255	” said Gerald . Birkin watched him narrowly . He saw the perfect good - humoured callousness , even strange , glistening malice , in Gerald , glistening through the plausible ethics of productivity . “
23425	23429	23423	23423	Gerald	255	” he said , “
23435	23436	23430	23430	I	0	” “
23442	23446	23437	23437	I	0	” said Gerald . “
23451	23459	23449	23449	you	255	” Birkin mused inscrutably for some minutes . “
23473	23479	23466	23466	you	255	” he said at last . “
23503	23524	23500	23500	you	255	” Gerald was rather taken aback , even a little disconcerted . He did not quite know what to say . “
23535	23539	23525	23525	I	0	” he said . “
23557	23558	23541	23541	I	0	” “
23564	23583	23541	23541	I	0	” said Birkin . Gerald watched him with curious eyes . He could not quite make him out . “
23592	23670	23673	23673	you	255	” he repeated . There was a silence between the two men for some time , as the train ran on . In Birkin ’s face was a little irritable tension , a sharp knitting of the brows , keen and difficult . Gerald watched him warily , carefully , rather calculatingly , for he could not decide what he was after . Suddenly Birkin ’s eyes looked straight and overpowering into those of the other man . “
23686	23715	23673	23673	you	255	” he asked . Again Gerald was taken aback . He could not think what his friend was getting at . Was he poking fun , or not ? “
23728	23737	23720	23720	I	0	” he replied , with faintly ironic humour . “
23755	23765	23739	23739	you	255	” Birkin asked , with direct , attentive seriousness . “
23771	23775	23739	23739	you	255	” said Gerald . “
23778	23786	23787	23787	I	0	” There was a really puzzled pause . “
23792	23796	23787	23787	I	0	” said Gerald . “
23805	23806	23787	23787	I	0	” “
23816	23817	23787	23787	I	0	” “
23835	23845	23846	23846	I	0	” Birkin knitted his brows like sharply moulded steel . “
23849	23853	23846	23846	I	0	” he said , “
23884	23885	23874	23874	I	0	” “
23893	23897	23874	23874	I	0	” asked Gerald . “
23902	23906	23874	23874	I	0	” replied Birkin . “
23910	23914	23874	23874	I	0	” said Gerald . “
23921	23925	23874	23874	I	0	” said Birkin . “
23929	23933	23927	23927	I	0	” said Gerald . “
23940	23963	23964	23964	I	0	” said Birkin . Gerald looked with a long , twinkling , almost sardonic look into the eyes of the other man . “
23969	23973	23974	23974	I	0	” he said . “
23982	23986	23987	23987	You	0	” said Birkin . “
23990	23991	23987	23987	You	0	” “
24001	24002	23994	23994	I	0	” “
24008	24019	24061	24062	one woman	1001	” repeated Gerald . And he waited for a moment . “
24024	24058	24061	24062	one woman	1001	” he added . The evening light , flooding yellow along the fields , lit up Birkin ’s face with a tense , abstract steadfastness . Gerald still could not make it out . “
24064	24082	24061	24062	one woman	1001	” said Birkin . But to Gerald it sounded as if he were insistent rather than confident . “
24102	24106	24061	24062	one woman	1001	” said Gerald . “
24123	24143	24144	24144	I	0	” asked Birkin . Gerald ’s eyes narrowed with a queer dangerous smile as he watched the other man . “
24152	24156	24157	24157	You	0	” he said . “
24170	24171	24172	24172	I	0	” “
24212	24222	24223	24223	I	0	” Birkin pondered as if he would crack something . “
24226	24230	24223	24223	I	0	” he said , “
24274	24275	24277	24277	you	0	” “
24290	24294	24277	24277	you	0	” said Gerald . “
24305	24306	24277	24277	you	0	” “
24315	24356	24357	24357	You	0	” said Gerald . And he turned to look out of the window at the flying , golden landscape . Birkin could not help seeing how beautiful and soldierly his face was , with a certain courage to be indifferent . “
24365	24369	24357	24357	You	0	” said Birkin . “
24395	24399	24392	24392	I	0	” said Gerald . “
24416	24423	24424	24424	You	0	” Birkin watched him almost angrily . “
24430	24434	24424	24424	You	0	” he said . “
24442	24496	24439	24439	I	0	” said Gerald . And he looked again at Birkin almost sardonically , with his blue , manly , sharp - lighted eyes . Birkin ’s eyes were at the moment full of anger . But swiftly they became troubled , doubtful , then full of a warm , rich affectionateness and laughter . “
24505	24513	24503	24503	Gerald	255	” he said , wrinkling his brows . “
24520	24731	24514	24514	I	0	” said Gerald , uncovering his mouth in a manly , quick , soldierly laugh . Gerald was held unconsciously by the other man . He wanted to be near him , he wanted to be within his sphere of influence . There was something very congenial to him in Birkin . But yet , beyond this , he did not take much notice . He felt that he , himself , Gerald , had harder and more durable truths than any the other man knew . He felt himself older , more knowing . It was the quick - changing warmth and venality and brilliant warm utterance he loved in his friend . It was the rich play of words and quick interchange of feelings he enjoyed . The real content of the words he never really considered : he himself knew better . Birkin knew this . He knew that Gerald wanted to be fond of him without taking him seriously . And this made him go hard and cold . As the train ran on , he sat looking at the land , and Gerald fell away , became as nothing to him . Birkin looked at the land , at the evening , and was thinking : “
24898	24905	24908	24908	you	0	” Gerald interrupted him by asking , “
24913	24918	24908	24908	you	0	” Birkin looked up . “
24942	24943	24925	24925	I	0	” “
24956	24960	24925	24925	I	0	” said Gerald . “
24985	24986	24990	24990	people	579	” “
24992	24993	24990	24990	people	579	” “
25055	25056	25061	25061	musicians	1031	” “
25063	25064	25065	25065	Painters	1032	” “
25120	25121	25117	25117	they	1027	” “
25125	25136	25117	25117	they	1027	” said Gerald . Birkin could see his curiosity roused . “
25157	25230	25231	25231	We	1041	” He looked at Gerald , and saw how his blue eyes were lit up with a little flame of curious desire . He saw too how good - looking he was . Gerald was attractive , his blood seemed fluid and electric . His blue eyes burned with a keen , yet cold light , there was a certain beauty , a beautiful passivity in all his body , his moulding . “
25249	25253	25239	25239	I	0	” said Gerald . “
25256	25260	25239	25239	I	0	” said Birkin , “
25296	25297	25287	25287	you	1045	” “
25305	25309	25300	25300	I	0	” laughed Gerald . “
25316	25317	25312	25312	you	0	” “
25339	25340	25300	25300	I	0	” “
25345	25349	25300	25300	I	0	” asked Gerald . “
25353	25354	25300	25300	I	0	” “
25366	25367	25361	25361	I	0	” “
25377	25461	25464	25464	you	0	” The evening was falling . They had passed Bedford . Birkin watched the country , and was filled with a sort of hopelessness . He always felt this , on approaching London . His dislike of mankind , of the mass of mankind , amounted almost to an illness . he was murmuring to himself , like a man condemned to death . Gerald , who was very subtly alert , wary in all his senses , leaned forward and asked smilingly : “
25467	25504	25464	25464	you	0	” Birkin glanced at him , laughed , and repeated : Gerald also looked now at the country . And Birkin , who , for some reason was now tired and dispirited , said to him : “
25536	25537	25464	25464	you	0	” “
25540	25544	25464	25464	you	0	” said Gerald . “
25555	25565	25464	25464	you	0	” Birkin lifted his shoulders in a slow shrug . “
25571	25575	25576	25576	It	1051	” he said . “
25598	25610	25612	25612	they	579	” There was a roused glad smile in Gerald ’s eyes . “
25614	25695	25612	25612	they	579	” he said . And he watched the other man critically . In a few minutes the train was running through the disgrace of outspread London . Everybody in the carriage was on the alert , waiting to escape . At last they were under the huge arch of the station , in the tremendous shadow of the town . Birkin shut himself together — he was in now . The two men went together in a taxi - cab . “
25706	25729	25701	25704	one of the damned	1053	” asked Birkin , as they sat in a little , swiftly - running enclosure , and watched the hideous great street . “
25732	25736	25701	25704	one of the damned	1053	” laughed Gerald . “
25742	26106	25701	25704	one of the damned	1053	” said Birkin . They met again in the café several hours later . Gerald went through the push doors into the large , lofty room where the faces and heads of the drinkers showed dimly through the haze of smoke , reflected more dimly , and repeated ad infinitum in the great mirrors on the walls , so that one seemed to enter a vague , dim world of shadowy drinkers humming within an atmosphere of blue tobacco smoke . There was , however , the red plush of the seats to give substance within the bubble of pleasure . Gerald moved in his slow , observant , glistening - attentive motion down between the tables and the people whose shadowy faces looked up as he passed . He seemed to be entering in some strange element , passing into an illuminated new region , among a host of licentious souls . He was pleased , and entertained . He looked over all the dim , evanescent , strangely illuminated faces that bent across the tables . Then he saw Birkin rise and signal to him . At Birkin ’s table was a girl with dark , soft , fluffy hair cut short in the artist fashion , hanging level and full almost like the Egyptian princess ’s . She was small and delicately made , with warm colouring and large , dark hostile eyes . There was a delicacy , almost a beauty in all her form , and at the same time a certain attractive grossness of spirit , that made a little spark leap instantly alight in Gerald ’s eyes . Birkin , who looked muted , unreal , his presence left out , introduced her as Miss Darrington . She gave her hand with a sudden , unwilling movement , looking all the while at Gerald with a dark , exposed stare . A glow came over him as he sat down . The waiter appeared . Gerald glanced at the glasses of the other two . Birkin was drinking something green , Miss Darrington had a small liqueur glass that was empty save for a tiny drop . “
26115	26116	26109	26109	you	1054	” “
26119	26137	26109	26109	you	1054	” she said , sipping her last drop and putting down the glass . The waiter disappeared . “
26140	26146	26147	26147	He	1055	” she said to Birkin . “
26165	26199	26155	26155	He	1055	” She spoke her r ’s like w ’s , lisping with a slightly babyish pronunciation which was at once affected and true to her character . Her voice was dull and toneless . “
26205	26209	26202	26202	he	1055	” asked Birkin . “
26221	26226	26210	26210	He	1055	” said the girl . “
26232	26238	26227	26227	Warens	206	” There was a pause . “
26243	26253	26202	26202	he	1055	” said Birkin , in a dispassionate protective manner , “
26261	26272	26256	26256	you	0	” The girl paused sullenly . She hated the question . “
26281	26285	26273	26273	I	0	” she replied . “
26294	26295	26286	26286	I	0	” “
26302	26306	26298	26298	you	0	” asked Birkin . “
26327	26328	26318	26318	he	1055	” “
26335	26336	26342	26342	he	1055	” “
26357	26358	26350	26350	I	0	” “
26361	26362	26350	26350	I	0	” “
26370	26371	26366	26366	he	1055	” “
26376	26377	26366	26366	he	1055	” “
26386	26392	26381	26381	he	1055	” There was a pause . “
26403	26407	26396	26396	you	0	” he asked . “
26410	26414	26419	26419	him	1055	” she said . “
26421	26422	26423	26423	You	0	” “
26430	26456	26423	26423	You	0	” But she turned aside her face sullenly , and did not answer the question . Another young man came hurrying up to the table . “
26469	26474	26465	26465	you	0	” he said eagerly . “
26477	26478	26465	26465	you	0	” “
26483	26484	26480	26480	Halliday	204	” “
26496	26497	26490	26490	I	0	” “
26524	26525	26514	26514	you	0	” “
26536	26549	26533	26533	you	0	” she replied , coolly and yet appealingly , like a child . “
26560	26566	26533	26533	you	0	” said the young man . “
26572	26634	26533	26533	you	0	” And giving a sharp look at Birkin and at Gerald , the young man moved off , with a swing of his coat skirts . All this time Gerald had been completely ignored . And yet he felt that the girl was physically aware of his proximity . He waited , listened , and tried to piece together the conversation . “
26642	26650	26533	26533	you	0	” the girl asked , of Birkin . “
26655	26659	26661	26661	you	0	” replied Birkin . “
26663	26664	26661	26661	you	0	” “
26679	26729	26676	26676	Bertha	213	” There was a silence . Suddenly the girl turned to Gerald , and said , in a rather formal , polite voice , with the distant manner of a woman who accepts her position as a social inferior , yet assumes intimate camaraderie with the male she addresses : “
26736	26737	26731	26731	you	0	” “
26743	26747	26731	26731	you	0	” he laughed . “
26766	26767	26758	26758	I	0	” “
26776	26789	26771	26772	an artist	1059	” she said , in a tone that placed him an outsider . “
26792	26796	26771	26772	an artist	1059	” he replied . “
26812	26823	26797	26797	He	0	” said Birkin , giving Gerald his credentials for Bohemia . “
26829	26841	26826	26827	a soldier	1060	” asked the girl , with a cold yet lively curiosity . “
26849	26853	26844	26844	I	0	” said Gerald , “
26858	26859	26860	26860	He	0	” “
26867	26871	26860	26860	He	0	” said Birkin . “
26876	26881	26873	26873	you	0	” said the girl . “
26889	26893	26896	26896	he	0	” said Birkin , “
26904	26968	26896	26896	he	0	” The girl looked at Gerald with steady , calm curiosity . He laughed , hearing himself described . He felt proud too , full of male strength . His blue , keen eyes were lit up with laughter , his ruddy face , with its sharp fair hair , was full of satisfaction , and glowing with life . He piqued her . “
26975	26980	26972	26972	you	0	” she asked him . “
26986	26990	26972	26972	you	0	” he replied . “
26998	27336	27339	27339	Julius	209	” Still she stared into his face with that slow , full gaze which was so curious and so exciting to him . He was acutely and delightfully conscious of himself , of his own attractiveness . He felt full of strength , able to give off a sort of electric power . And he was aware of her dark , hot - looking eyes upon him . She had beautiful eyes , dark , fully - opened , hot , naked in their looking at him . And on them there seemed to float a film of disintegration , a sort of misery and sullenness , like oil on water . She wore no hat in the heated café , her loose , simple jumper was strung on a string round her neck . But it was made of rich peach - coloured crêpe - de - chine , that hung heavily and softly from her young throat and her slender wrists . Her appearance was simple and complete , really beautiful , because of her regularity and form , her soft dark hair falling full and level on either side of her head , her straight , small , softened features , Egyptian in the slight fulness of their curves , her slender neck and the simple , rich - coloured smock hanging on her slender shoulders . She was very still , almost null , in her manner , apart and watchful . She appealed to Gerald strongly . He felt an awful , enjoyable power over her , an instinctive cherishing very near to cruelty . For she was a victim . He felt that she was in his power , and he was generous . The electricity was turgid and voluptuously rich , in his limbs . He would be able to destroy her utterly in the strength of his discharge . But she was waiting in her separation , given . They talked banalities for some time . Suddenly Birkin said : “
27341	27490	27339	27339	Julius	209	” and he half rose to his feet , motioning to the newcomer . The girl , with a curious , almost evil motion , looked round over her shoulder without moving her body . Gerald watched her dark , soft hair swing over her ears . He felt her watching intensely the man who was approaching , so he looked too . He saw a pale , full - built young man with rather long , solid fair hair hanging from under his black hat , moving cumbrously down the room , his face lit up with a smile at once naive and warm , and vapid . He approached towards Birkin , with a haste of welcome . It was not till he was quite close that he perceived the girl . He recoiled , went pale , and said , in a high squealing voice : “
27499	27556	27495	27495	you	211	” The café looked up like animals when they hear a cry . Halliday hung motionless , an almost imbecile smile flickering palely on his face . The girl only stared at him with a black look in which flared an unfathomable hell of knowledge , and a certain impotence . She was limited by him . “
27563	27575	27576	27576	I	0	” repeated Halliday , in the same high , hysterical voice . “
27584	27620	27576	27576	I	0	” The girl did not answer , only stared in the same viscous , heavy fashion , straight at him , as he stood recoiled , as if for safety , against the next table . “
27635	27641	27623	27623	you	211	” said Birkin to him . “
27669	27670	27663	27663	you	211	” “
27676	27686	27663	27663	you	211	” she said in a heavy voice of resentment . “
27696	27709	27710	27710	She	211	” cried Halliday , his voice rising to a kind of squeal . “
27716	27720	27710	27710	She	211	” said Birkin . “
27733	27734	27710	27710	She	211	” “
27745	27749	27737	27737	I	0	” cried Halliday . “
27762	27803	27737	27737	I	0	” she said to him , very curtly , and yet with a sort of protectiveness towards him , in her voice . Halliday came and sat at the table , putting his hand on his heart , and crying : “
27831	27832	27827	27827	you	211	” “
27839	27843	27844	27844	You	0	” she repeated . “
27850	27878	27844	27844	You	0	” he cried in a high voice . She turned completely away from him , to Gerald Crich , whose eyes were shining with a subtle amusement . “
27889	27900	27880	27880	you	211	” she asked in her calm , dull childish voice . “
27936	27937	27939	27939	you	211	” “
27948	27949	27944	27944	they	1065	” “
27987	27988	27944	27944	they	1065	” “
27993	27997	27944	27944	they	1065	” interrupted Birkin . “
28003	28007	27944	27944	they	1065	” she said . “
28029	28030	28032	28032	you	211	” “
28034	28038	28032	28032	you	211	” he laughed . “
28063	28064	28047	28047	They	1067	” “
28081	28082	28047	28047	They	1067	” “
28096	28097	28103	28103	you	211	” “
28107	28108	28103	28103	you	211	” “
28150	28426	28140	28140	I	0	” She looked at him steadily with her dark eyes , that rested on him and roused him so deeply , that it left his upper self quite calm . It was rather delicious , to feel her drawing his self - revelations from him , as from the very innermost dark marrow of his body . She wanted to know . And her dark eyes seemed to be looking through into his naked organism . He felt , she was compelled to him , she was fated to come into contact with him , must have the seeing him and knowing him . And this roused a curious exultance . Also he felt , she must relinquish herself into his hands , and be subject to him . She was so profane , slave - like , watching him , absorbed by him . It was not that she was interested in what he said ; she was absorbed by his self - revelation , by him , she wanted the secret of him , the experience of his male being . Gerald ’s face was lit up with an uncanny smile , full of light and rousedness , yet unconscious . He sat with his arms on the table , his sunbrowned , rather sinister hands , that were animal and yet very shapely and attractive , pushed forward towards her . And they fascinated her . And she knew , she watched her own fascination . Other men had come to the table , to talk with Birkin and Halliday . Gerald said in a low voice , apart , to Pussum : “
28434	28435	28429	28429	you	1071	” “
28440	28509	28429	28429	you	1071	” replied Pussum , in a very low , yet fully resonant voice . Her face closed hard . Continually she glanced at Halliday , and then a black flare came over her eyes . The heavy , fair young man ignored her completely ; he was really afraid of her . For some moments she would be unaware of Gerald . He had not conquered her yet . “
28519	28542	28543	28543	He	1073	” he asked , his voice still muted . She would not answer for some seconds . Then she said , unwillingly : “
28600	28601	28585	28585	he	1073	” “
28609	28613	28605	28605	his	1073	” said Gerald . “
28627	28631	28621	28621	he	1073	” she said . “
28667	28713	28663	28665	a perfect baby	1078	” Gerald looked at Halliday for some moments , watching the soft , rather degenerate face of the young man . Its very softness was an attraction ; it was a soft , warm , corrupt nature , into which one might plunge with gratification . “
28725	28729	28715	28715	he	1073	” Gerald asked . “
28748	28752	28732	28732	he	1073	” she replied . “
28859	28869	28820	28820	he	1073	” A queer look came over Gerald ’s face . “
28878	28946	28820	28820	he	1073	” he asked incredulous . It seemed , to look at her , impossible , she was so young and so far in spirit from any childbearing . She looked full into his face , and her dark , inchoate eyes had now a furtive look , and a look of a knowledge of evil , dark and indomitable . A flame ran secretly to his heart . “
28949	28953	28820	28820	he	1073	” she said . “
28959	28960	28820	28820	he	1073	” “
28967	28971	28820	28820	he	1073	” he asked . “
28976	28981	28972	28972	I	0	” she replied emphatically . “
28984	28988	28972	28972	I	0	” he said , “
28995	28996	28972	28972	I	0	” “
29000	29043	28972	28972	I	0	” she said . All the time she kept her dark , inchoate eyes full upon him . He remained silent , thinking . Then , switching off and becoming cold , he asked , in a voice full of considerate kindness : “
29059	29060	29055	29055	you	0	” “
29063	29067	29055	29055	you	0	” she said , “
29074	29075	29055	29055	you	0	” “
29079	29083	29055	29055	you	0	” he said . “
29089	29116	29084	29084	We	1083	” And he beckoned to the waiter . Halliday took no notice , until the little plate was set before her . Then suddenly he cried : “
29130	29131	29119	29119	you	211	” “
29141	29145	29084	29084	We	1083	” she asked . “
29150	29154	29084	29084	We	1083	” he cried . “
29167	29168	29156	29156	you	211	” “
29175	29208	29169	29169	I	0	” she replied , and she sprinkled the last drops of her liqueur over his face . He gave an odd squeal . She sat looking at him , as if indifferent . “
29217	29279	29213	29213	you	211	” he cried in panic . He gave Gerald the impression that he was terrified of her , and that he loved his terror . He seemed to relish his own horror and hatred of her , turn it over and extract every flavour from it , in real panic . Gerald thought him a strange fool , and yet piquant . “
29283	29297	29298	29298	you	211	” said another man , in a very small , quick Eton voice , “
29305	29306	29298	29298	you	211	” “
29313	29317	29307	29307	I	0	” she answered . “
29323	29345	29320	29320	you	211	” the young man asked . He was dark , and smooth - skinned , and full of a stealthy vigour . “
29354	29358	29352	29352	Maxim	215	” she replied . “
29365	29387	29359	29359	You	211	” came the whispering , gentlemanly voice of the other . Gerald suddenly realised that this was a hint to him . “
29393	29399	29352	29352	Maxim	215	” he asked , laughing . “
29405	29605	29352	29352	Maxim	215	” she lisped childishly . Gerald watched her eating the oysters . She was delicate and finicking in her eating , her fingers were fine and seemed very sensitive in the tips , so she put her food apart with fine , small motions , she ate carefully , delicately . It pleased him very much to see her , and it irritated Birkin . They were all drinking champagne . Maxim , the prim young Russian with the smooth , warm - coloured face and black , oiled hair was the only one who seemed to be perfectly calm and sober . Birkin was white and abstract , unnatural , Gerald was smiling with a constant bright , amused , cold light in his eyes , leaning a little protectively towards the Pussum , who was very handsome , and soft , unfolded like some red lotus in dreadful flowering nakedness , vainglorious now , flushed with wine and with the excitement of men . Halliday looked foolish . One glass of wine was enough to make him drunk and giggling . Yet there was always a pleasant , warm naïveté about him , that made him attractive . “
29617	29687	29606	29606	I	0	” said the Pussum , looking up suddenly and staring with her black eyes , on which there seemed an unseeing film of flame , fully upon Gerald . He laughed dangerously , from the blood . Her childish speech caressed his nerves , and her burning , filmed eyes , turned now full upon him , oblivious of all her antecedents , gave him a sort of licence . “
29692	29696	29688	29688	I	0	” she protested . “
29712	29728	29730	29730	you	0	” she shuddered convulsively , as if the very thought were too much to bear . “
29733	29748	29730	29730	you	0	” said Gerald , with the punctiliousness of a man who has been drinking , “
29780	29781	29783	29783	they	1087	” “
29786	29791	29783	29783	they	1087	” cried the girl . “
29796	29800	29801	29801	I	0	” exclaimed Halliday . “
29806	29815	29801	29801	I	0	” replied Gerald , looking round the table . “
29843	29858	29830	29830	you	0	” The girl was looking full upon him all the time with inchoate eyes . “
29871	29875	29867	29867	they	1087	” she cried . “
29909	29910	29904	29904	I’m	0	” “
29915	29921	29904	29904	I’m	0	” whispered the young Russian . “
29930	29934	29928	29928	Maxim	215	” she asseverated . “
29943	29959	29928	29928	Maxim	215	” said Gerald , smiling and knowing . In some strange way he understood her . “
29968	29980	29965	29965	Gerald	255	” Birkin stated . There was a little pause of uneasiness . “
29991	30006	29983	29983	you	0	” asked the young Russian , in his quick , hushed , elegant manner . “
30010	30014	30015	30015	I	0	” she said . “
30035	30036	30028	30028	I	0	” “
30042	30083	30028	30028	I	0	” exclaimed a young man with a thick , pale , jeering face , who had just come to the table and was drinking whisky . The Pussum turned on him a sulky look of dislike , low and ugly . “
30092	30104	30086	30086	you	0	” the other persisted , a sneer all over his face . “
30111	30115	30107	30107	I	0	” she retorted . “
30131	30137	30126	30127	a dentist	1088	” jeered the young man . “
30145	30151	30138	30138	I	0	” she replied rather superbly . “
30161	30188	30159	30159	you	0	” he said . For reply , she suddenly jabbed a knife across his thick , pale hand . He started up with a vulgar curse . “
30195	30202	30159	30159	you	0	” said the Pussum in contempt . “
30206	30225	30204	30204	you	0	” said the young man , standing by the table and looking down at her with acrid malevolence . “
30229	30274	30204	30204	you	0	” said Gerald , in quick , instinctive command . The young man stood looking down at her with sardonic contempt , a cowed , self - conscious look on his thick , pale face . The blood began to flow from his hand . “
30284	30295	30296	30296	D’you	0	” squealed Halliday , turning green and averting his face . “
30300	30311	30296	30296	D’you	0	” asked the sardonic young man , in some concern . “
30358	30359	30355	30355	she	1090	” “
30362	30366	30355	30355	she	1090	” squealed Halliday . “
30375	30430	30373	30373	Maxim	215	” said the Pussum warningly . The suave young Russian rose and took Halliday by the arm , leading him away . Birkin , white and diminished , looked on as if he were displeased . The wounded , sardonic young man moved away , ignoring his bleeding hand in the most conspicuous fashion . “
30439	30446	30447	30447	He	209	” said the Pussum to Gerald . “
30456	30457	30460	30460	he	209	” “
30462	30466	30460	30460	he	209	” asked Gerald . “
30480	30481	30474	30474	I	0	” “
30496	30497	30498	30498	Julius	209	” “
30509	30513	30514	30514	He	209	” she cried . “
30529	30530	30523	30523	he	209	” “
30533	30537	30538	30538	They	1095	” said Gerald . “
30545	30549	30538	30538	They	1095	” she said . “
30593	30594	30586	30586	Julius	209	” “
30604	30647	30595	30595	They	1095	” said Gerald good - humouredly . The Pussum looked at him with a slow , slow smile . She was very handsome , flushed , and confident in dreadful knowledge . Two little points of light glinted on Gerald ’s eyes . “
30662	30667	30650	30650	they	1095	” he asked her . “
30672	30685	30650	30650	they	1095	” she said . The smile grew more intense on his face . “
30698	30699	30686	30686	You	0	” “
30705	30720	30703	30703	Gerald	255	” said Birkin , in some disgust . They both looked uneasily at Birkin . “
30728	30756	30721	30721	You	0	” she said to him , with a slight insolence , being safe with the other man . Halliday was coming back , looking forlorn and sick . “
30759	30763	30757	30757	Pussum	211	” he said , “
30775	30785	30766	30766	you	211	” He sank in his chair with a groan . “
30792	30798	30786	30786	You	0	” she said to him . “
30804	30808	30799	30799	I	0	” he said . “
30826	30832	30819	30819	you	211	” he said to Gerald . “
30851	30859	30848	30848	I	0	” He looked round for a waiter . “
30865	30871	30848	30848	I	0	” Then he groaned again . “
30890	30891	30882	30882	you	211	” “
30900	30907	30895	30895	you	0	” she said with sullen calm . “
30980	30981	30982	30982	You	0	” “
30989	30997	30984	30984	you	0	” she said to him , coldly . “
31031	31032	31033	31033	He	1110	” “
31044	31488	31033	31033	He	1110	” came the rapid , hushed voice of the young Russian . They all moved off to the door . The girl kept near to Gerald , and seemed to be at one in her motion with him . He was aware of this , and filled with demon - satisfaction that his motion held good for two . He held her in the hollow of his will , and she was soft , secret , invisible in her stirring there . They crowded five of them into the taxi - cab . Halliday lurched in first , and dropped into his seat against the other window . Then the Pussum took her place , and Gerald sat next to her . They heard the young Russian giving orders to the driver , then they were all seated in the dark , crowded close together , Halliday groaning and leaning out of the window . They felt the swift , muffled motion of the car . The Pussum sat near to Gerald , and she seemed to become soft , subtly to infuse herself into his bones , as if she were passing into him in a black , electric flow . Her being suffused into his veins like a magnetic darkness , and concentrated at the base of his spine like a fearful source of power . Meanwhile her voice sounded out reedy and nonchalant , as she talked indifferently with Birkin and with Maxim . Between her and Gerald was this silence and this black , electric comprehension in the darkness . Then she found his hand , and grasped it in her own firm , small clasp . It was so utterly dark , and yet such a naked statement , that rapid vibrations ran through his blood and over his brain , he was no longer responsible . Still her voice rang on like a bell , tinged with a tone of mockery . And as she swung her head , her fine mane of hair just swept his face , and all his nerves were on fire , as with a subtle friction of electricity . But the great centre of his force held steady , a magnificent pride to him , at the base of his spine . They arrived at a large block of buildings , went up in a lift , and presently a door was being opened for them by a Hindu . Gerald looked in surprise , wondering if he were a gentleman , one of the Hindus down from Oxford , perhaps . But no , he was the man - servant . “
31494	31498	31492	31492	Hasan	219	” said Halliday . “
31506	31542	31492	31492	Hasan	219	” said Birkin . To both of which questions the man grinned , and murmured . He made Gerald uncertain , because , being tall and slender and reticent , he looked like a gentleman . “
31548	31554	31555	31555	He	1112	” he asked of Halliday . “
31560	31561	31557	31558	a swell	1113	” “
31640	31641	31642	31642	He	1112	” “
31647	31665	31642	31642	He	1112	” said the young Russian swiftly and silently . Directly , the man appeared in the doorway . “
31670	31682	31642	31642	He	1112	” said Halliday . The Hindu grinned , and murmured shyly : “
31689	31738	31687	31687	master	1120	” Gerald watched curiously . The fellow in the doorway was goodlooking and clean - limbed , his bearing was calm , he looked elegant , aristocratic . Yet he was half a savage , grinning foolishly . Halliday went out into the corridor to speak with him . “
31741	31747	31687	31687	master	1120	” they heard his voice . “
31776	31802	31803	31803	He	1122	” There was the confused sound of the Hindu ’s talking , then Halliday appeared in the room , smiling also foolishly , and saying : “
31834	31855	31856	31856	You	1121	” He took the money from Gerald and went out into the passage again , where they heard him saying , “
31884	32044	31813	31813	anybody	744	” Gerald looked round the room . It was an ordinary London sitting - room in a flat , evidently taken furnished , rather common and ugly . But there were several negro statues , wood - carvings from West Africa , strange and disturbing , the carved negroes looked almost like the fœtus of a human being . One was a woman sitting naked in a strange posture , and looking tortured , her abdomen stuck out . The young Russian explained that she was sitting in child - birth , clutching the ends of the band that hung from her neck , one in each hand , so that she could bear down , and help labour . The strange , transfixed , rudimentary face of the woman again reminded Gerald of a fœtus , it was also rather wonderful , conveying the suggestion of the extreme of physical sensation , beyond the limits of mental consciousness . “
32051	32057	32058	32058	I	0	” he asked , disapproving . “
32063	32069	32058	32058	I	0	” murmured the other rapidly . “
32084	32269	32270	32270	Pussum	211	” Gerald turned away . There were one or two new pictures in the room , in the Futurist manner ; there was a large piano . And these , with some ordinary London lodging - house furniture of the better sort , completed the whole . The Pussum had taken off her hat and coat , and was seated on the sofa . She was evidently quite at home in the house , but uncertain , suspended . She did not quite know her position . Her alliance for the time being was with Gerald , and she did not know how far this was admitted by any of the men . She was considering how she should carry off the situation . She was determined to have her experience . Now , at this eleventh hour , she was not to be baulked . Her face was flushed as with battle , her eye was brooding but inevitable . The man came in with tea and a bottle of Kümmel . He set the tray on a little table before the couch . “
32272	32276	32270	32270	Pussum	211	” said Halliday , “
32282	32288	32270	32270	Pussum	211	” She did not move . “
32295	32306	32291	32291	you	211	” Halliday repeated , in a state of nervous apprehension . “
32318	32322	32307	32307	I	0	” she said . “
32338	32339	32327	32328	the others	809	” “
32381	32513	32373	32373	I	0	” She did not reply , but silently , reservedly reached for the tea - pot . They all sat round and drank tea . Gerald could feel the electric connection between him and her so strongly , as she sat there quiet and withheld , that another set of conditions altogether had come to pass . Her silence and her immutability perplexed him . How was he going to come to her ? And yet he felt it quite inevitable . He trusted completely to the current that held them . His perplexity was only superficial , new conditions reigned , the old were surpassed ; here one did as one was possessed to do , no matter what it was . Birkin rose . It was nearly one o’clock . “
32520	32524	32525	32525	Gerald	255	” he said . “
32545	32546	32539	32539	you	255	” “
32549	32574	32575	32575	I	0	” said Gerald , and Birkin went out . When he was well gone , Halliday said in a stimulated voice , to Gerald : “
32587	32588	32575	32575	I	0	” “
32596	32600	32589	32589	You	255	” said Gerald . “
32647	32648	32640	32640	I	0	” “
32656	32668	32670	32670	Rupert	169	” said the Pussum , in a cold , hostile voice , “
32674	32675	32670	32670	Rupert	169	” “
32684	32697	32676	32676	I	0	” said Halliday , in his odd , high way of speaking . “
32704	32721	32722	32722	Julius	209	” He was smiling rather foolishly , and he spoke eagerly , with an insinuating determination . “
32730	32749	32724	32724	I	0	” said the Russian in his discreet , precise voice . Halliday and he were friends since Eton . “
32755	32881	32724	32724	I	0	” said Gerald , rising and pressing back his arms , stretching himself . Then he went again to look at one of the pictures . Every one of his limbs was turgid with electric force , and his back was tense like a tiger ’s , with slumbering fire . He was very proud . The Pussum rose . She gave a black look at Halliday , black and deadly , which brought the rather foolishly pleased smile to that young man ’s face . Then she went out of the room , with a cold good - night to them all generally . There was a brief interval , they heard a door close , then Maxim said , in his refined voice : “
32887	32903	32724	32724	I	0	” He looked significantly at Gerald , and said again , with a silent nod : “
32913	32960	32961	32961	I	0	” Gerald looked at the smooth , ruddy , comely face , and at the strange , significant eyes , and it seemed as if the voice of the young Russian , so small and perfect , sounded in the blood rather than in the air . “
32967	32971	32961	32961	I	0	” said Gerald . “
32981	33015	32976	32976	You	0	” said the Russian . Halliday continued to smile , and to say nothing . Suddenly the Pussum appeared again in the door , her small , childish face looking sullen and vindictive . “
33025	33034	33018	33018	you	0	” came her cold , rather resonant voice . “
33052	33260	33047	33047	you	0	” She turned and was gone again . She had been wearing a loose dressing - gown of purple silk , tied round her waist . She looked so small and childish and vulnerable , almost pitiful . And yet the black looks of her eyes made Gerald feel drowned in some potent darkness that almost frightened him . The men lit another cigarette and talked casually . In the morning Gerald woke late . He had slept heavily . Pussum was still asleep , sleeping childishly and pathetically . There was something small and curled up and defenceless about her , that roused an unsatisfied flame of passion in the young man ’s blood , a devouring avid pity . He looked at her again . But it would be too cruel to wake her . He subdued himself , and went away . Hearing voices coming from the sitting - room , Halliday talking to Libidnikov , he went to the door and glanced in . He had on a silk wrap of a beautiful bluish colour , with an amethyst hem . To his surprise he saw the two young men by the fire , stark naked . Halliday looked up , rather pleased . “
33265	33269	33047	33047	you	0	” he said . “
33277	33321	33273	33273	you	1140	” And stark naked he went out into the hall , striding a strange , white figure between the unliving furniture . He came back with the towels , and took his former position , crouching seated before the fire on the fender . “
33334	33338	33273	33273	you	1140	” he said . “
33344	33348	33273	33273	you	1140	” said Gerald . “
33368	33372	33273	33273	you	1140	” said Halliday . “
33375	33379	33273	33273	you	1140	” said Gerald , “
33392	33393	33273	33273	you	1140	” “
33399	33533	33273	33273	you	1140	” murmured Maxim . Gerald looked at him , and with a slight revulsion saw the human animal , golden skinned and bare , somehow humiliating . Halliday was different . He had a rather heavy , slack , broken beauty , white and firm . He was like a Christ in a Pietà . The animal was not there at all , only the heavy , broken beauty . And Gerald realised how Halliday ’s eyes were beautiful too , so blue and warm and confused , broken also in their expression . The fireglow fell on his heavy , rather bowed shoulders , he sat slackly crouched on the fender , his face was uplifted , weak , perhaps slightly disintegrate , and yet with a moving beauty of its own . “
33537	33541	33273	33273	you	1140	” said Maxim , “
33555	33556	33549	33550	the people	4677	” “
33560	33564	33549	33550	the people	4677	” exclaimed Halliday . “
33567	33568	33549	33550	the people	4677	” “
33574	33578	33549	33550	the people	4677	” said Gerald . “
33626	33627	33619	33619	I	0	” “
33631	33635	33636	33636	I	0	” said Gerald . “
33647	33648	33636	33636	I	0	” “
33676	33677	33659	33659	I	0	” “
33681	33685	33659	33659	I	0	” asked Gerald . “
33690	33691	33659	33659	I	0	” “
33767	33768	33759	33759	I	0	” “
33779	33908	33759	33759	I	0	” said the Russian . Gerald glanced at him , and saw him , his suave , golden coloured body with the black hair growing fine and freely , like tendrils , and his limbs like smooth plant - stems . He was so healthy and well - made , why did he make one ashamed , why did one feel repelled ? Why should Gerald even dislike it , why did it seem to him to detract from his own dignity . Was that all a human being amounted to ? So uninspired ! thought Gerald . Birkin suddenly appeared in the doorway , in white pyjamas and wet hair , and a towel over his arm . He was aloof and white , and somehow evanescent . “
33922	33937	33938	33938	I	0	” he said generally , and was going away again , when Gerald called : “
33943	33944	33938	33938	I	0	” “
33947	33961	33938	33938	I	0	” The single white figure appeared again , a presence in the room . “
33976	34026	33971	33971	I	0	” Gerald asked . Birkin , white and strangely ghostly , went over to the carved figure of the negro woman in labour . Her nude , protuberant body crouched in a strange , clutching posture , her hands gripping the ends of the band , above her breast . “
34031	34035	33971	33971	I	0	” said Birkin . “
34044	34188	33971	33971	I	0	” said the Russian . They all drew near to look . Gerald looked at the group of men , the Russian golden and like a water - plant , Halliday tall and heavily , brokenly beautiful , Birkin very white and indefinite , not to be assigned , as he looked closely at the carven woman . Strangely elated , Gerald also lifted his eyes to the face of the wooden figure . And his heart contracted . He saw vividly with his spirit the grey , forward - stretching face of the negro woman , African and tense , abstracted in utter physical stress . It was a terrible face , void , peaked , abstracted almost into meaninglessness by the weight of sensation beneath . He saw the Pussum in it . As in a dream , he knew her . “
34194	34202	33971	33971	I	0	” Gerald asked , shocked , resentful . “
34209	34213	33971	33971	I	0	” said Birkin . “
34229	34230	33971	33971	I	0	” “
34240	34244	34232	34232	you	1149	” said Gerald . “
34278	34279	33971	33971	I	0	” “
34283	34297	33971	33971	I	0	” Gerald asked , in opposition . He hated the sheer African thing . “
34330	34348	34349	34349	You	1148	” But Gerald resented it . He wanted to keep certain illusions , certain ideas like clothing . “
34357	34361	34355	34355	Rupert	169	” he said , “
34366	34367	34349	34349	You	1148	” “
34378	34509	34370	34370	I	0	” Birkin replied , moving away . When Gerald went back to his room from the bath , he also carried his clothes . He was so conventional at home , that when he was really away , and on the loose , as now , he enjoyed nothing so much as full outrageousness . So he strode with his blue silk wrap over his arm and felt defiant . The Pussum lay in her bed , motionless , her round , dark eyes like black , unhappy pools . He could only see the black , bottomless pools of her eyes . Perhaps she suffered . The sensation of her inchoate suffering roused the old sharp flame in him , a mordant pity , a passion almost of cruelty . “
34515	34521	34510	34510	You	1150	” he said to her . “
34527	35810	34370	34370	I	0	” came her muted voice . She seemed to flow back , almost like liquid , from his approach , to sink helplessly away from him . Her inchoate look of a violated slave , whose fulfilment lies in her further and further violation , made his nerves quiver with acutely desirable sensation . After all , his was the only will , she was the passive substance of his will . He tingled with the subtle , biting sensation . And then he knew , he must go away from her , there must be pure separation between them . It was a quiet and ordinary breakfast , the four men all looking very clean and bathed . Gerald and the Russian were both correct and comme il faut in appearance and manner , Birkin was gaunt and sick , and looked a failure in his attempt to be a properly dressed man , like Gerald and Maxim . Halliday wore tweeds and a green flannel shirt , and a rag of a tie , which was just right for him . The Hindu brought in a great deal of soft toast , and looked exactly the same as he had looked the night before , statically the same . At the end of the breakfast the Pussum appeared , in a purple silk wrap with a shimmering sash . She had recovered herself somewhat , but was mute and lifeless still . It was a torment to her when anybody spoke to her . Her face was like a small , fine mask , sinister too , masked with unwilling suffering . It was almost midday . Gerald rose and went away to his business , glad to get out . But he had not finished . He was coming back again at evening , they were all dining together , and he had booked seats for the party , excepting Birkin , at a music - hall . At night they came back to the flat very late again , again flushed with drink . Again the man - servant — who invariably disappeared between the hours of ten and twelve at night — came in silently and inscrutably with tea , bending in a slow , strange , leopard - like fashion to put the tray softly on the table . His face was immutable , aristocratic - looking , tinged slightly with grey under the skin ; he was young and good - looking . But Birkin felt a slight sickness , looking at him , and feeling the slight greyness as an ash or a corruption , in the aristocratic inscrutability of expression a nauseating , bestial stupidity . Again they talked cordially and rousedly together . But already a certain friability was coming over the party , Birkin was mad with irritation , Halliday was turning in an insane hatred against Gerald , the Pussum was becoming hard and cold , like a flint knife , and Halliday was laying himself out to her . And her intention , ultimately , was to capture Halliday , to have complete power over him . In the morning they all stalked and lounged about again . But Gerald could feel a strange hostility to himself , in the air . It roused his obstinacy , and he stood up against it . He hung on for two more days . The result was a nasty and insane scene with Halliday on the fourth evening . Halliday turned with absurd animosity upon Gerald , in the café . There was a row . Gerald was on the point of knocking - in Halliday ’s face ; when he was filled with sudden disgust and indifference , and he went away , leaving Halliday in a foolish state of gloating triumph , the Pussum hard and established , and Maxim standing clear . Birkin was absent , he had gone out of town again . Gerald was piqued because he had left without giving the Pussum money . It was true , she did not care whether he gave her money or not , and he knew it . But she would have been glad of ten pounds , and he would have been very glad to give them to her . Now he felt in a false position . He went away chewing his lips to get at the ends of his short clipped moustache . He knew the Pussum was merely glad to be rid of him . She had got her Halliday whom she wanted . She wanted him completely in her power . Then she would marry him . She wanted to marry him . She had set her will on marrying Halliday . She never wanted to hear of Gerald again ; unless , perhaps , she were in difficulty ; because after all , Gerald was what she called a man , and these others , Halliday , Libidnikov , Birkin , the whole Bohemian set , they were only half men . But it was half men she could deal with . She felt sure of herself with them . The real men , like Gerald , put her in her place too much . Still , she respected Gerald , she really respected him . She had managed to get his address , so that she could appeal to him in time of distress . She knew he wanted to give her money . She would perhaps write to him on that inevitable rainy day . Breadalby was a Georgian house with Corinthian pillars , standing among the softer , greener hills of Derbyshire , not far from Cromford . In front , it looked over a lawn , over a few trees , down to a string of fish - ponds in the hollow of the silent park . At the back were trees , among which were to be found the stables , and the big kitchen garden , behind which was a wood . It was a very quiet place , some miles from the high - road , back from the Derwent Valley , outside the show scenery . Silent and forsaken , the golden stucco showed between the trees , the house - front looked down the park , unchanged and unchanging . Of late , however , Hermione had lived a good deal at the house . She had turned away from London , away from Oxford , towards the silence of the country . Her father was mostly absent , abroad , she was either alone in the house , with her visitors , of whom there were always several , or she had with her her brother , a bachelor , and a Liberal member of Parliament . He always came down when the House was not sitting , seemed always to be present in Breadalby , although he was most conscientious in his attendance to duty . The summer was just coming in when Ursula and Gudrun went to stay the second time with Hermione . Coming along in the car , after they had entered the park , they looked across the dip , where the fish - ponds lay in silence , at the pillared front of the house , sunny and small like an English drawing of the old school , on the brow of the green hill , against the trees . There were small figures on the green lawn , women in lavender and yellow moving to the shade of the enormous , beautifully balanced cedar tree . “
35816	35820	34370	34370	I	0	” said Gudrun . “
35830	35856	34370	34370	I	0	” She spoke with some resentment in her voice , as if she were captivated unwillingly , as if she must admire against her will . “
35862	35866	35858	35858	you	1151	” asked Ursula . “
35885	35943	35878	35878	I	0	” The motor - car ran down the hill and up again in one breath , and they were curving to the side door . A parlour - maid appeared , and then Hermione , coming forward with her pale face lifted , and her hands outstretched , advancing straight to the newcomers , her voice singing : “
35955	35958	35948	35948	I’m	0	” she kissed Gudrun—“so
35964	35976	35962	35962	you	1151	” she kissed Ursula and remained with her arm round her . “
35982	35983	35978	35978	you	1151	” “
35989	35993	35978	35978	you	1151	” said Ursula . “
36000	36001	35998	35998	Gudrun	160	” “
36008	36012	35998	35998	Gudrun	160	” said Gudrun . “
36015	36058	35998	35998	Gudrun	160	” drawled Hermione . And she stood and looked at them . The two girls were embarrassed because she would not move into the house , but must have her little scene of welcome there on the path . The servants waited . “
36062	36229	35998	35998	Gudrun	160	” said Hermione at last , having fully taken in the pair of them . Gudrun was the more beautiful and attractive , she had decided again , Ursula was more physical , more womanly . She admired Gudrun ’s dress more . It was of green poplin , with a loose coat above it , of broad , dark - green and dark - brown stripes . The hat was of a pale , greenish straw , the colour of new hay , and it had a plaited ribbon of black and orange , the stockings were dark green , the shoes black . It was a good get - up , at once fashionable and individual . Ursula , in dark blue , was more ordinary , though she also looked well . Hermione herself wore a dress of prune - coloured silk , with coral beads and coral coloured stockings . But her dress was both shabby and soiled , even rather dirty . “
36254	36803	36806	36806	Salsie	229	” Ursula was glad when she could be left alone in her room . Hermione lingered so long , made such a stress on one . She stood so near to one , pressing herself near upon one , in a way that was most embarrassing and oppressive . She seemed to hinder one ’s workings . Lunch was served on the lawn , under the great tree , whose thick , blackish boughs came down close to the grass . There were present a young Italian woman , slight and fashionable , a young , athletic - looking Miss Bradley , a learned , dry Baronet of fifty , who was always making witticisms and laughing at them heartily in a harsh , horse - laugh , there was Rupert Birkin , and then a woman secretary , a Fräulein März , young and slim and pretty . The food was very good , that was one thing . Gudrun , critical of everything , gave it her full approval . Ursula loved the situation , the white table by the cedar tree , the scent of new sunshine , the little vision of the leafy park , with far - off deer feeding peacefully . There seemed a magic circle drawn about the place , shutting out the present , enclosing the delightful , precious past , trees and deer and silence , like a dream . But in spirit she was unhappy . The talk went on like a rattle of small artillery , always slightly sententious , with a sententiousness that was only emphasised by the continual crackling of a witticism , the continual spatter of verbal jest , designed to give a tone of flippancy to a stream of conversation that was all critical and general , a canal of conversation rather than a stream . The attitude was mental and very wearying . Only the elderly sociologist , whose mental fibre was so tough as to be insentient , seemed to be thoroughly happy . Birkin was down in the mouth . Hermione appeared , with amazing persistence , to wish to ridicule him and make him look ignominious in the eyes of everybody . And it was surprising how she seemed to succeed , how helpless he seemed against her . He looked completely insignificant . Ursula and Gudrun , both very unused , were mostly silent , listening to the slow , rhapsodic sing - song of Hermione , or the verbal sallies of Sir Joshua , or the prattle of Fräulein , or the responses of the other two women . Luncheon was over , coffee was brought out on the grass , the party left the table and sat about in lounge chairs , in the shade or in the sunshine as they wished . Fräulein departed into the house , Hermione took up her embroidery , the little Contessa took a book , Miss Bradley was weaving a basket out of fine grass , and there they all were on the lawn in the early summer afternoon , working leisurely and spattering with half - intellectual , deliberate talk . Suddenly there was the sound of the brakes and the shutting off of a motor - car . “
36808	36846	36806	36806	Salsie	229	” sang Hermione , in her slow , amusing sing - song . And laying down her work , she rose slowly , and slowly passed over the lawn , round the bushes , out of sight . “
36851	36855	36856	36857	Mr Roddice	230	” asked Gudrun . “
36873	36878	36871	36871	he	230	” said Sir Joshua . “
36888	37124	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” said the little Contessa , lifting her head for a moment from her book , and speaking as if to give information , in her slightly deepened , guttural English . They all waited . And then round the bushes came the tall form of Alexander Roddice , striding romantically like a Meredith hero who remembers Disraeli . He was cordial with everybody , he was at once a host , with an easy , offhand hospitality that he had learned for Hermione ’s friends . He had just come down from London , from the House . At once the atmosphere of the House of Commons made itself felt over the lawn : the Home Secretary had said such and such a thing , and he , Roddice , on the other hand , thought such and such a thing , and had said so - and - so to the PM . Now Hermione came round the bushes with Gerald Crich . He had come along with Alexander . Gerald was presented to everybody , was kept by Hermione for a few moments in full view , then he was led away , still by Hermione . He was evidently her guest of the moment . There had been a split in the Cabinet ; the minister for Education had resigned owing to adverse criticism . This started a conversation on education . “
37128	37139	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” said Hermione , lifting her face like a rhapsodist , “
37161	37179	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” She seemed to rumble and ruminate with subterranean thoughts for a minute , then she proceeded : “
37193	37212	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” Gerald , on the brink of discussion , sniffed the air with delight and prepared for action . “
37216	37220	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” he said . “
37248	37249	37238	37246	a well - trained , vigorous , energetic mind	1157	” “
37262	37279	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” cried Miss Bradley , in hearty accord . Gudrun looked at her in silent loathing . “
37282	37286	36879	36879	Salsie	229	” rumbled Hermione , “
37328	37329	37322	37322	I	0	” “
37338	37349	37336	37336	Hermione	168	” asked Alexander . Hermione lifted her face and rumbled — “
37389	37399	37379	37379	One	4646	” Birkin looked at her in a white fury . “
37409	37414	37415	37415	You	168	” he said sarcastically . “
37423	37429	37379	37379	One	4646	” Hermione recoiled in offence . “
37440	37444	37433	37433	one	4646	” said Gerald . “
37459	37460	37433	37433	one	4646	” “
37468	37483	37433	37433	one	4646	” murmured the Italian , lifting her face for a moment from her book . “
37489	37514	37433	37433	one	4646	” said Gerald , while Ursula began to laugh . Hermione waited for the dust to settle , and then she said , untouched : “
37539	37540	37433	37433	one	4646	” “
37549	37553	37433	37433	one	4646	” said Mattheson . “
37558	37606	37433	37433	one	4646	” said Birkin , looking at the dry , stiff little body of the Baronet . Immediately Gudrun saw the famous sociologist as a flat bottle , containing tabloids of compressed liberty . That pleased her . Sir Joshua was labelled and placed forever in her mind . “
37614	37623	37612	37612	Rupert	169	” sang Hermione , in a calm snub . “
37632	37636	37612	37612	Rupert	169	” he replied , “
37659	37660	37433	37433	one	4646	” “
37670	37677	37662	37662	one	4646	” asked the Baronet , pointedly . “
37696	37697	37662	37662	one	4646	” “
37700	37704	37662	37662	one	4646	” said Birkin . “
37715	37723	37726	37727	the man	4658	” suddenly piped the little Italian woman . “
37740	37762	37726	37727	the man	4658	” There was a general laugh in the company . Miss Bradley went and looked over the shoulder of the Contessa . “
37765	37770	37771	37771	Bazarov	236	” said the Contessa . “
37785	37816	37771	37771	Bazarov	236	” she read . Again there was a loud laugh , the most startling of which was the Baronet ’s , which rattled out like a clatter of falling stones . “
37822	37828	37829	37829	Fathers	1168	” asked Alexander , promptly . “
37836	37857	37834	37834	Turgenev	237	” said the little foreigner , pronouncing every syllable distinctly . She looked at the cover , to verify herself . “
37863	37867	37834	37834	Turgenev	237	” said Birkin . “
37876	37886	37887	37887	Bazarov	236	” said Alexander , with a fine declamatory voice . “
37899	37907	37908	37908	I	0	” He looked brightly round the company . “
37917	37965	37887	37887	Bazarov	236	” said Ursula . They all began to guess . And then , to the amazement of everybody , the maid came hurrying with a large tea - tray . The afternoon had passed so swiftly . After tea , they were all gathered for a walk . “
37975	38005	37967	37967	you	1170	” said Hermione to each of them , one by one . And they all said yes , feeling somehow like prisoners marshalled for exercise . Birkin only refused . “
38015	38016	38007	38007	you	1170	” “
38021	38022	38019	38019	Hermione	168	” “
38028	38029	38025	38025	you	1170	” “
38033	38041	38025	38025	you	1170	” There was a second ’s hesitation . “
38046	38081	38025	38025	you	1170	” sang Hermione ’s question . It made her blood run sharp , to be thwarted in even so trifling a matter . She intended them all to walk with her in the park . “
38093	38117	38083	38083	I	0	” he said . Her voice rumbled in her throat for a moment . Then she said , with a curious stray calm : “
38132	38179	38128	38128	he	1172	” And she looked really gay , while she insulted him . But it merely made him stiff . She trailed off to the rest of the company , only turning to wave her handkerchief to him , and to chuckle with laughter , singing out : “
38191	38192	38188	38189	little boy	1173	” “
38200	38226	38188	38189	little boy	1173	” he said to himself . They all went through the park . Hermione wanted to show them the wild daffodils on a little slope . “
38233	38419	38420	38420	Rupert	169	” sang her leisurely voice at intervals . And they had all to come this way . The daffodils were pretty , but who could see them ? Ursula was stiff all over with resentment by this time , resentment of the whole atmosphere . Gudrun , mocking and objective , watched and registered everything . They looked at the shy deer , and Hermione talked to the stag , as if he too were a boy she wanted to wheedle and fondle . He was male , so she must exert some kind of power over him . They trailed home by the fish - ponds , and Hermione told them about the quarrel of two male swans , who had striven for the love of the one lady . She chuckled and laughed as she told how the ousted lover had sat with his head buried under his wing , on the gravel . When they arrived back at the house , Hermione stood on the lawn and sang out , in a strange , small , high voice that carried very far : “
38424	38438	38422	38422	Rupert	169	” The first syllable was high and slow , the second dropped down . “
38445	38456	38439	38443	Roo - o - opert	1174	” But there was no answer . A maid appeared . “
38464	38487	38462	38462	Alice	238	” asked the mild straying voice of Hermione . But under the straying voice , what a persistent , almost insane will ! “
38498	38499	38501	38501	he	1175	” “
38503	38524	38501	38501	he	1175	” Hermione went slowly up the stairs , along the corridor , singing out in her high , small call : “
38536	38549	38531	38534	Ru - oo pert	239	” She came to his door , and tapped , still crying : “
38554	38555	38531	38534	Ru - oo pert	239	” “
38558	38565	38568	38568	you	0	” sounded his voice at last . “
38571	38590	38568	38568	you	0	” The question was mild and curious . There was no answer . Then he opened the door . “
38596	38600	38591	38591	We	1178	” said Hermione . “
38607	38608	38591	38591	We	1178	” “
38611	38615	38591	38591	We	1178	” he said , “
38621	38639	38641	38641	you	1175	” She looked at him with her long , slow , impassive look , along her cheeks . “
38643	38703	38706	38706	you	1175	” she echoed . And she remained looking at him . She was stimulated above all things by this conflict with him , when he was like a sulky boy , helpless , and she had him safe at Breadalby . But underneath she knew the split was coming , and her hatred of him was subconscious and intense . “
38709	38760	38706	38706	you	1175	” she reiterated , in her mild , indifferent tone . He did not answer , and she made her way , almost unconsciously into his room . He had taken a Chinese drawing of geese from the boudoir , and was copying it , with much skill and vividness . “
38767	38783	38761	38761	You	1175	” she said , standing near the table , and looking down at his work . “
38802	38803	38800	38800	you	1175	” “
38810	38814	38800	38800	you	1175	” he said . “
38842	38843	38835	38837	The Chinese Ambassador	1179	” “
38847	38851	38835	38837	The Chinese Ambassador	1179	” he said . “
38859	38869	38855	38855	you	1175	” she asked , casual and sing - song . “
38876	38877	38878	38878	I	0	” “
38884	38888	38878	38878	I	0	” he replied . “
38905	38906	38889	38889	One	4646	” “
38913	38977	38910	38910	you	1175	” She was at once roused , she laid as it were violent hands on him , to extract his secrets from him . She must know . It was a dreadful tyranny , an obsession in her , to know all he knew . For some time he was silent , hating to answer her . Then , compelled , he began : “
39043	39148	39862	39862	somebody	4745	” Hermione looked at him along her narrow , pallid cheeks . Her eyes were strange and drugged , heavy under their heavy , drooping lids . Her thin bosom shrugged convulsively . He stared back at her , devilish and unchanging . With another strange , sick convulsion , she turned away , as if she were sick , could feel dissolution setting - in in her body . For with her mind she was unable to attend to his words , he caught her , as it were , beneath all her defences , and destroyed her with some insidious occult potency . “
39151	39166	39862	39862	somebody	4745	” she said , as if she did not know what she were saying . “
39169	39611	39862	39862	somebody	4745	” and she swallowed , and tried to regain her mind . But she could not , she was witless , decentralised . Use all her will as she might , she could not recover . She suffered the ghastliness of dissolution , broken and gone in a horrible corruption . And he stood and looked at her unmoved . She strayed out , pallid and preyed - upon like a ghost , like one attacked by the tomb - influences which dog us . And she was gone like a corpse , that has no presence , no connection . He remained hard and vindictive . Hermione came down to dinner strange and sepulchral , her eyes heavy and full of sepulchral darkness , strength . She had put on a dress of stiff old greenish brocade , that fitted tight and made her look tall and rather terrible , ghastly . In the gay light of the drawing - room she was uncanny and oppressive . But seated in the half - light of the dining - room , sitting stiffly before the shaded candles on the table , she seemed a power , a presence . She listened and attended with a drugged attention . The party was gay and extravagant in appearance , everybody had put on evening dress except Birkin and Joshua Mattheson . The little Italian Contessa wore a dress of tissue , of orange and gold and black velvet in soft wide stripes , Gudrun was emerald green with strange net - work , Ursula was in yellow with dull silver veiling , Miss Bradley was of grey , crimson and jet , Fräulein März wore pale blue . It gave Hermione a sudden convulsive sensation of pleasure , to see these rich colours under the candle - light . She was aware of the talk going on , ceaselessly , Joshua ’s voice dominating ; of the ceaseless pitter - patter of women ’s light laughter and responses ; of the brilliant colours and the white table and the shadow above and below ; and she seemed in a swoon of gratification , convulsed with pleasure and yet sick , like a revenant . She took very little part in the conversation , yet she heard it all , it was all hers . They all went together into the drawing - room , as if they were one family , easily , without any attention to ceremony . Fräulein handed the coffee , everybody smoked cigarettes , or else long warden pipes of white clay , of which a sheaf was provided . “
39618	39842	39613	39613	you	1182	” asked Fräulein prettily . There was a circle of people , Sir Joshua with his eighteenth - century appearance , Gerald the amused , handsome young Englishman , Alexander tall and the handsome politician , democratic and lucid , Hermione strange like a long Cassandra , and the women lurid with colour , all dutifully smoking their long white pipes , and sitting in a half - moon in the comfortable , soft - lighted drawing - room , round the logs that flickered on the marble hearth . The talk was very often political or sociological , and interesting , curiously anarchistic . There was an accumulation of powerful force in the room , powerful and destructive . Everything seemed to be thrown into the melting pot , and it seemed to Ursula they were all witches , helping the pot to bubble . There was an elation and a satisfaction in it all , but it was cruelly exhausting for the newcomers , this ruthless mental pressure , this powerful , consuming , destructive mentality that emanated from Joshua and Hermione and Birkin and dominated the rest . But a sickness , a fearful nausea gathered possession of Hermione . There was a lull in the talk , as it was arrested by her unconscious but all - powerful will . “
39851	39859	39847	39847	you	229	” said Hermione , breaking off completely . “
39895	39976	39893	39893	Ursula	255	” Hermione rose and slowly pulled the gold - embroidered band that hung by the mantel , clinging to it for a moment , then releasing it suddenly . Like a priestess she looked , unconscious , sunk in a heavy half - trance . A servant came , and soon reappeared with armfuls of silk robes and shawls and scarves , mostly oriental , things that Hermione , with her love for beautiful extravagant dress , had collected gradually . “
39984	39988	39977	39979	The three women	1184	” she said . “
39994	40001	40002	40004	Vergini Delle Rocchette	240	” asked Alexander , rising briskly . “
40006	40013	40002	40004	Vergini Delle Rocchette	240	” said the Contessa at once . “
40019	40023	40014	40014	They	1184	” said Ursula . “
40030	40329	40024	40028	The three witches from Macbeth	1185	” suggested Fräulein usefully . It was finally decided to do Naomi and Ruth and Orpah . Ursula was Naomi , Gudrun was Ruth , the Contessa was Orpah . The idea was to make a little ballet , in the style of the Russian Ballet of Pavlova and Nijinsky . The Contessa was ready first , Alexander went to the piano , a space was cleared . Orpah , in beautiful oriental clothes , began slowly to dance the death of her husband . Then Ruth came , and they wept together , and lamented , then Naomi came to comfort them . It was all done in dumb show , the women danced their emotion in gesture and motion . The little drama went on for a quarter of an hour . Ursula was beautiful as Naomi . All her men were dead , it remained to her only to stand alone in indomitable assertion , demanding nothing . Ruth , woman - loving , loved her . Orpah , a vivid , sensational , subtle widow , would go back to the former life , a repetition . The interplay between the women was real and rather frightening . It was strange to see how Gudrun clung with heavy , desperate passion to Ursula , yet smiled with subtle malevolence against her , how Ursula accepted silently , unable to provide any more either for herself or for the other , but dangerous and indomitable , refuting her grief . Hermione loved to watch . She could see the Contessa ’s rapid , stoat - like sensationalism , Gudrun ’s ultimate but treacherous cleaving to the woman in her sister , Ursula ’s dangerous helplessness , as if she were helplessly weighted , and unreleased . “
40335	40603	40024	40028	The three witches from Macbeth	1185	” everybody cried with one accord . But Hermione writhed in her soul , knowing what she could not know . She cried out for more dancing , and it was her will that set the Contessa and Birkin moving mockingly in Malbrouk . Gerald was excited by the desperate cleaving of Gudrun to Naomi . The essence of that female , subterranean recklessness and mockery penetrated his blood . He could not forget Gudrun ’s lifted , offered , cleaving , reckless , yet withal mocking weight . And Birkin , watching like a hermit crab from its hole , had seen the brilliant frustration and helplessness of Ursula . She was rich , full of dangerous power . She was like a strange unconscious bud of powerful womanhood . He was unconsciously drawn to her . She was his future . Alexander played some Hungarian music , and they all danced , seized by the spirit . Gerald was marvellously exhilarated at finding himself in motion , moving towards Gudrun , dancing with feet that could not yet escape from the waltz and the two - step , but feeling his force stir along his limbs and his body , out of captivity . He did not know yet how to dance their convulsive , rag - time sort of dancing , but he knew how to begin . Birkin , when he could get free from the weight of the people present , whom he disliked , danced rapidly and with a real gaiety . And how Hermione hated him for this irresponsible gaiety . “
40608	40627	40605	40605	I	0	” cried the Contessa excitedly , watching his purely gay motion , which he had all to himself . “
40636	40659	40631	40631	he	1186	” Hermione looked at her slowly , and shuddered , knowing that only a foreigner could have seen and have said this . “
40665	40673	40663	40663	Palestra	246	” she asked , sing - song . “
40676	40684	40685	40685	He	1186	” said the Contessa , in Italian . “
40701	40702	40693	40694	a chameleon	1189	” “
40718	41002	40709	40709	he	1186	” said itself over in Hermione ’s consciousness . And her soul writhed in the black subjugation to him , because of his power to escape , to exist , other than she did , because he was not consistent , not a man , less than a man . She hated him in a despair that shattered her and broke her down , so that she suffered sheer dissolution like a corpse , and was unconscious of everything save the horrible sickness of dissolution that was taking place within her , body and soul . The house being full , Gerald was given the smaller room , really the dressing - room , communicating with Birkin ’s bedroom . When they all took their candles and mounted the stairs , where the lamps were burning subduedly , Hermione captured Ursula and brought her into her own bedroom , to talk to her . A sort of constraint came over Ursula in the big , strange bedroom . Hermione seemed to be bearing down on her , awful and inchoate , making some appeal . They were looking at some Indian silk shirts , gorgeous and sensual in themselves , their shape , their almost corrupt gorgeousness . And Hermione came near , and her bosom writhed , and Ursula was for a moment blank with panic . And for a moment Hermione ’s haggard eyes saw the fear on the face of the other , there was again a sort of crash , a crashing down . And Ursula picked up a shirt of rich red and blue silk , made for a young princess of fourteen , and was crying mechanically : “
41019	41091	40709	40709	he	1186	” Then Hermione ’s maid entered silently and Ursula , overcome with dread , escaped , carried away by powerful impulse . Birkin went straight to bed . He was feeling happy , and sleepy . Since he had danced he was happy . But Gerald would talk to him . Gerald , in evening dress , sat on Birkin ’s bed when the other lay down , and must talk . “
41098	41102	41094	41096	those two Brangwens	1193	” Gerald asked . “
41108	41109	41103	41103	They	1193	” “
41118	41119	41115	41115	they	1193	” “
41126	41132	41133	41133	They	1193	” There was a pause . “
41136	41142	41148	41148	them	1193	” exclaimed Gerald at length . “
41151	41152	41148	41148	them	1193	” “
41157	41161	41155	41155	you	0	” said Birkin . “
41176	41177	41178	41178	She	168	” “
41207	41208	41197	41197	she	168	” “
41225	41226	41209	41209	She	168	” “
41238	41239	41233	41236	Ursula a class mistress	1203	” “

41267	41281	41243	41244	the father	646	” Gerald was always uneasy under the slightly jeering tone of the other . “
41299	41329	41330	41330	I	0	” Birkin laughed . Gerald looked at his face , as it lay there laughing and bitter and indifferent on the pillow , and he could not go away . “
41362	41366	41352	41352	she	160	” said Birkin . “
41372	41373	41369	41369	she	160	” “
41422	41430	41433	41433	you	0	” Gerald pondered for a few moments . “
41439	41443	41433	41433	you	0	” he asked . “
41450	41454	41446	41446	her	160	” he replied , “
41506	41507	41498	41498	her	160	” “
41518	41522	41509	41509	she	160	” asked Gerald . “

41666	41670	41671	41671	She	160	” mused Gerald . “
41762	41763	41756	41756	I	0	” “
41793	41798	41774	41774	I	0	” Birkin was silent . “
41802	41806	41807	41807	Julius	209	” he said , “
41909	41910	41899	41900	the Pussum	4973	” “
41920	41924	41914	41914	I	0	” said Gerald . “

42024	42032	42019	42019	I	0	” said Gerald , after a pause , “
42051	42052	42043	42043	She	1217	” “
42060	42064	42056	42056	you	0	” exclaimed Birkin . “
42087	42088	42072	42072	I	0	” “
42101	42105	42089	42089	I	0	” said Gerald . “
42146	42147	42148	42148	I	0	” “
42151	42162	42148	42148	I	0	” said Birkin . Then he added , rather fretfully , “
42177	42210	42168	42168	Gerald	255	” Gerald looked at his watch , and at length rose off the bed , and went to his room . But he returned in a few minutes , in his shirt . “
42214	42225	42168	42168	Gerald	255	” he said , seating himself on the bed again . “
42242	42243	42233	42233	I	0	” “
42246	42250	42233	42233	I	0	” said Birkin . “
42266	42267	42251	42251	She	1217	” “
42271	42275	42251	42251	She	1217	” said Gerald , “
42288	42289	42276	42276	I	0	” “
42295	42296	42290	42290	She	1217	” “
42319	42320	42322	42322	you	0	” “
42324	42385	42322	42322	you	0	” said Birkin . He was looking at the white legs of Gerald , as the latter sat on the side of the bed in his shirt . They were white - skinned , full , muscular legs , handsome and decided . Yet they moved Birkin with a sort of pathos , tenderness , as if they were childish . “
42395	42403	42388	42388	I	0	” said Gerald , repeating himself vaguely . “
42413	42417	42418	42418	You	0	” said Birkin . “
42426	42445	42418	42418	You	0	” said Gerald , a little puzzled , looking down at the face of the other man affectionately . “
42450	42454	42456	42456	she	1227	” said Birkin . “
42464	42465	42456	42456	she	1227	” “
42476	42496	42473	42473	Cæsarina	248	” said Birkin , turning aside . It seemed to him Gerald was talking for the sake of talking . “
42511	42515	42516	42516	I	0	” he said . “
42527	42555	42518	42518	you	0	” said Gerald , looking down all the time at the face of the other man , waiting for something . But Birkin turned his face aside . “
42564	42600	42601	42601	I	0	” said Gerald , and he laid his hand affectionately on the other man ’s shoulder , and went away . In the morning when Gerald awoke and heard Birkin move , he called out : “
42613	42614	42604	42604	I	0	” “
42618	42622	42604	42604	I	0	” said Birkin , “
42654	42655	42648	42648	you	0	” “
42664	42665	42658	42658	you	0	” “
42669	42676	42667	42667	you	0	” Gerald meditated for some moments . “
42699	42700	42697	42697	them	249	” “
42731	42735	42697	42697	them	249	” said Birkin . “
42746	42750	42697	42697	them	249	” said Gerald . “
42763	42764	42755	42755	I	0	” “
42779	42957	42958	42958	I	0	” The morning was again sunny . The maid had been in and brought the water , and had drawn the curtains . Birkin , sitting up in bed , looked lazily and pleasantly out on the park , that was so green and deserted , romantic , belonging to the past . He was thinking how lovely , how sure , how formed , how final all the things of the past were — the lovely accomplished past — this house , so still and golden , the park slumbering its centuries of peace . And then , what a snare and a delusion , this beauty of static things — what a horrible , dead prison Breadalby really was , what an intolerable confinement , the peace ! Yet it was better than the sordid scrambling conflict of the present . If only one might create the future after one ’s own heart — for a little pure truth , a little unflinching application of simple truth to life , the heart cried out ceaselessly . “
42975	42985	43000	43000	You	0	” came Gerald ’s voice from the lower room . “
42998	42999	43000	43000	You	0	” “
43017	43021	43015	43015	myself	0	” said Birkin . “
43032	43038	43040	43040	you	0	” came Gerald ’s voice . “
43050	43062	43048	43048	myself	0	” In the silence Birkin could feel Gerald musing this fact . “
43070	43078	43079	43079	You	0	” came the good - humoured answer . “
43082	43086	43089	43089	you	0	” said Birkin , “
43125	43126	43118	43118	you	0	” “
43135	43148	43130	43130	me	0	” said Gerald , in a queer , quiet , real voice . “
43151	43158	43130	43130	me	0	” said Birkin , rather surprised . “
43169	43181	43162	43162	I	0	” said Gerald . There was a silence for some time . “
43204	43208	43200	43200	You	0	” Birkin replied . “
43214	43218	43211	43212	the Pussum	211	” asked Gerald . “
43221	43234	43211	43212	the Pussum	211	” said Birkin . And he rose and went to the window . “
43240	43244	43237	43237	your	0	” said Gerald . “
43262	43263	43257	43257	you	0	” “
43267	43271	43257	43257	you	0	” said Birkin . “
43279	43280	43274	43274	I	0	” “
43284	43285	43274	43274	I	0	” “
43288	43293	43274	43274	I	0	” Birkin answered obstinately . “
43297	43301	43308	43309	my boy	4753	” added Gerald . “
43311	43360	43361	43362	Salvator femininus	1236	” There was a silence between them , and a strange tension of hostility . They always kept a gap , a distance between them , they wanted always to be free each of the other . Yet there was a curious heart - straining towards each other . “
43364	43370	43361	43362	Salvator femininus	1236	” said Gerald , satirically . “
43374	43378	43361	43362	Salvator femininus	1236	” said Birkin . “
43384	43388	43361	43362	Salvator femininus	1236	” said Gerald , “
43400	43401	43402	43403	A woman	897	” “
43405	43409	43402	43403	A woman	897	” said Birkin . “
43412	43527	43402	43403	A woman	897	” said Gerald . Birkin and Gerald were the last to come down to breakfast . Hermione liked everybody to be early . She suffered when she felt her day was diminished , she felt she had missed her life . She seemed to grip the hours by the throat , to force her life from them . She was rather pale and ghastly , as if left behind , in the morning . Yet she had her power , her will was strangely pervasive . With the entrance of the two young men a sudden tension was felt . She lifted her face , and said , in her amused sing - song : “
43541	43566	43536	43536	I	0	” And she turned away , ignoring them . Birkin , who knew her well , saw that she intended to discount his existence . “
43577	43588	43568	43568	you	1238	” said Alexander , in a voice slightly suggesting disapprobation . “
43618	44058	43616	43616	you	1238	” Even Alexander was rather authoritative where Hermione was cool . He took his tone from her , inevitably . Birkin sat down and looked at the table . He was so used to this house , to this room , to this atmosphere , through years of intimacy , and now he felt in complete opposition to it all , it had nothing to do with him . How well he knew Hermione , as she sat there , erect and silent and somewhat bemused , and yet so potent , so powerful ! He knew her statically , so finally , that it was almost like a madness . It was difficult to believe one was not mad , that one was not a figure in the hall of kings in some Egyptian tomb , where the dead all sat immemorial and tremendous . How utterly he knew Joshua Mattheson , who was talking in his harsh , yet rather mincing voice , endlessly , endlessly , always with a strong mentality working , always interesting , and yet always known , everything he said known beforehand , however novel it was , and clever . Alexander the up - to - date host , so bloodlessly free - and - easy , Fräulein so prettily chiming in just as she should , the little Italian Countess taking notice of everybody , only playing her little game , objective and cold , like a weasel watching everything , and extracting her own amusement , never giving herself in the slightest ; then Miss Bradley , heavy and rather subservient , treated with cool , almost amused contempt by Hermione , and therefore slighted by everybody — how known it all was , like a game with the figures set out , the same figures , the Queen of chess , the knights , the pawns , the same now as they were hundreds of years ago , the same figures moving round in one of the innumerable permutations that make up the game . But the game is known , its going on is like a madness , it is so exhausted . There was Gerald , an amused look on his face ; the game pleased him . There was Gudrun , watching with steady , large , hostile eyes ; the game fascinated her , and she loathed it . There was Ursula , with a slightly startled look on her face , as if she were hurt , and the pain were just outside her consciousness . Suddenly Birkin got up and went out . “
44063	44174	43616	43616	you	1238	” he said to himself involuntarily . Hermione knew his motion , though not in her consciousness . She lifted her heavy eyes and saw him lapse suddenly away , on a sudden , unknown tide , and the waves broke over her . Only her indomitable will remained static and mechanical , she sat at the table making her musing , stray remarks . But the darkness had covered her , she was like a ship that has gone down . It was finished for her too , she was wrecked in the darkness . Yet the unfailing mechanism of her will worked on , she had that activity . “
44181	44191	43616	43616	you	1238	” she said , suddenly looking at them all . “
44194	44198	43616	43616	you	1238	” said Joshua . “
44205	44206	43616	43616	you	1238	” “
44213	44217	43616	43616	you	1238	” said Fräulein . “
44224	44230	44231	44231	We	1239	” said the Italian woman . “
44237	44241	44231	44231	We	1239	” said Gerald . “
44245	44249	44250	44250	I	0	” said Alexander . “
44264	44265	44260	44260	They	1241	” “
44271	44281	44250	44250	I	0	” asked the Italian Countess , with sudden interest . “
44284	44288	44250	44250	I	0	” said Alexander . “
44303	44304	44294	44294	I	0	” “
44310	44315	44294	44294	I	0	” said Fräulein daintily . “
44321	44419	44294	44294	I	0	” cried Miss Bradley . They all trailed out on to the lawn . It was a sunny , soft morning in early summer , when life ran in the world subtly , like a reminiscence . The church bells were ringing a little way off , not a cloud was in the sky , the swans were like lilies on the water below , the peacocks walked with long , prancing steps across the shadow and into the sunshine of the grass . One wanted to swoon into the by - gone perfection of it all . “
44424	44446	44294	44294	I	0	” called Alexander , waving his gloves cheerily , and he disappeared behind the bushes , on his way to church . “
44449	44453	44294	44294	I	0	” said Hermione , “
44459	44460	44461	44461	I	0	” “
44465	44469	44461	44461	I	0	” said Ursula . “
44476	44485	44470	44470	You	0	” said Hermione , looking at her slowly . “
44494	44498	44488	44488	I	0	” said Ursula . “
44502	44506	44500	44500	I	0	” said Gudrun . “
44512	44516	44517	44517	I	0	” asked Gerald . “
44522	44533	44517	44517	I	0	” laughed Hermione , with an odd , amused intonation . “
44543	44544	44517	44517	I	0	” “
44549	44553	44517	44517	I	0	” said Gerald . “
44558	44969	44517	44517	I	0	” sang Hermione . The first to run across the lawn was the little Italian , small and like a cat , her white legs twinkling as she went , ducking slightly her head , that was tied in a gold silk kerchief . She tripped through the gate and down the grass , and stood , like a tiny figure of ivory and bronze , at the water ’s edge , having dropped off her towelling , watching the swans , which came up in surprise . Then out ran Miss Bradley , like a large , soft plum in her dark - blue suit . Then Gerald came , a scarlet silk kerchief round his loins , his towels over his arms . He seemed to flaunt himself a little in the sun , lingering and laughing , strolling easily , looking white but natural in his nakedness . Then came Sir Joshua , in an overcoat , and lastly Hermione , striding with stiff grace from out of a great mantle of purple silk , her head tied up in purple and gold . Handsome was her stiff , long body , her straight - stepping white legs , there was a static magnificence about her as she let the cloak float loosely away from her striding . She crossed the lawn like some strange memory , and passed slowly and statelily towards the water . There were three ponds , in terraces descending the valley , large and smooth and beautiful , lying in the sun . The water ran over a little stone wall , over small rocks , splashing down from one pond to the level below . The swans had gone out on to the opposite bank , the reeds smelled sweet , a faint breeze touched the skin . Gerald had dived in , after Sir Joshua , and had swum to the end of the pond . There he climbed out and sat on the wall . There was a dive , and the little Countess was swimming like a rat , to join him . They both sat in the sun , laughing and crossing their arms on their breasts . Sir Joshua swam up to them , and stood near them , up to his arm - pits in the water . Then Hermione and Miss Bradley swam over , and they sat in a row on the embankment . “
44981	44985	44517	44517	I	0	” said Gudrun . “
45026	45288	45011	45011	Ursula	255	” Gudrun looked in dismay on Sir Joshua , who stood up to the breast in the water , his long , greyish hair washed down into his eyes , his neck set into thick , crude shoulders . He was talking to Miss Bradley , who , seated on the bank above , plump and big and wet , looked as if she might roll and slither in the water almost like one of the slithering sealions in the Zoo . Ursula watched in silence . Gerald was laughing happily , between Hermione and the Italian . He reminded her of Dionysos , because his hair was really yellow , his figure so full and laughing . Hermione , in her large , stiff , sinister grace , leaned near him , frightening , as if she were not responsible for what she might do . He knew a certain danger in her , a convulsive madness . But he only laughed the more , turning often to the little Countess , who was flashing up her face at him . They all dropped into the water , and were swimming together like a shoal of seals . Hermione was powerful and unconscious in the water , large and slow and powerful . Palestra was quick and silent as a water rat , Gerald wavered and flickered , a white natural shadow . Then , one after the other , they waded out , and went up to the house . But Gerald lingered a moment to speak to Gudrun . “
45296	45329	45289	45289	You	1247	” he said . She looked at him with a long , slow inscrutable look , as he stood before her negligently , the water standing in beads all over his skin . “
45336	45349	45330	45330	I	0	” she replied . He paused , expecting some sort of explanation . “
45354	45355	45351	45351	you	1247	” “
45361	45394	45358	45358	I	0	” Still he would not ask her why she would not go in then . He could feel something ironic in her . He walked away , piqued for the first time . “
45401	45432	45398	45398	you	1247	” he asked her again , later , when he was once more the properly - dressed young Englishman . She hesitated a moment before answering , opposing his persistence . “
45441	45714	45434	45434	I	0	” she replied . He laughed , her phrase seemed to re - echo in his consciousness . The flavour of her slang was piquant to him . Whether he would or not , she signified the real world to him . He wanted to come up to her standards , fulfil her expectations . He knew that her criterion was the only one that mattered . The others were all outsiders , instinctively , whatever they might be socially . And Gerald could not help it , he was bound to strive to come up to her criterion , fulfil her idea of a man and a human - being . After lunch , when all the others had withdrawn , Hermione and Gerald and Birkin lingered , finishing their talk . There had been some discussion , on the whole quite intellectual and artificial , about a new state , a new world of man . Supposing this old social state were broken and destroyed , then , out of the chaos , what then ? The great social idea , said Sir Joshua , was the social equality of man . No , said Gerald , the idea was , that every man was fit for his own little bit of a task — let him do that , and then please himself . The unifying principle was the work in hand . Only work , the business of production , held men together . It was mechanical , but then society was a mechanism . Apart from work they were isolated , free to do as they liked . “
45717	45721	45434	45434	I	0	” cried Gudrun . “
45780	45781	45769	45773	Miss Art - Teacher Brangwen	195	” “
45795	45799	45789	45793	Miss Art - Teacher Brangwen	195	” said Gerald . “
45819	45820	45816	45817	par exemple	1253	” “
45826	45831	45816	45817	par exemple	1253	” cried the Italian . “
45841	45842	45838	45838	women	453	” “
45849	45855	45838	45838	women	453	” said Birkin , sarcastically . “
45858	45862	45838	45838	women	453	” said Gerald . “
45882	45883	45838	45838	women	453	” “
45892	45896	45838	45838	women	453	” said Birkin . “
45909	45915	45897	45897	You	1257	” asked Ursula of Gerald . “
45920	45924	45916	45916	She	897	” said Gerald . “
45961	45962	45958	45958	she	897	” “
45976	45980	45958	45958	she	897	” asked Ursula . “
45984	45988	45958	45958	she	897	” replied Gerald . “
46001	46002	45989	45989	They	1262	” “
46017	46029	46005	46005	you	1257	” said Birkin . Gerald knitted his brows in momentary irritation . “
46034	46038	46031	46031	I	0	” he said . “
46041	46047	46031	46031	I	0	” said Hermione at last , “
46100	46134	46145	46145	Hermione	168	” This speech was received in silence , and almost immediately the party rose from the table . But when the others had gone , Birkin turned round in bitter declamation , saying : “
46303	46481	46482	46482	Hermione	168	“ But I , myself , who am myself , what have I to do with equality with any other man or woman ? In the spirit , I am as separate as one star is from another , as different in quality and quantity . Establish a state on that . One man is n’t any better than another , not because they are equal , but because they are intrinsically other , that there is no term of comparison . The minute you begin to compare , one man is seen to be far better than another , all the inequality you can imagine is there by nature . I want every man to have his share in the world ’s goods , so that I am rid of his importunity , so that I can tell him : ‘ Now you ’ve got what you want — you’ve got your fair share of the world ’s gear . Now , you one - mouthed fool , mind yourself and do n’t obstruct me . ’ ”
46553	46561	46563	46563	Gerald	255	“ It sounds like megalomania , Rupert , ”
46579	46585	46586	46586	he	1271	“ Yes , let it , ”
47461	47469	47470	47470	he	1271	“ No you do n’t , Hermione , ”
47477	47484	47470	47470	he	1271	“ I do n’t let you . ”
47503	47511	47512	47512	he	1271	“ Stand away and let me go , ”
47547	47553	47554	47554	he	1271	“ It is not good , ”
47564	47576	47554	47554	he	1271	“ It is n’t I who will die . You hear ? ”
49499	49503	49505	49505	Ursula	255	“ The fool ! ”
49508	49521	49505	49505	Ursula	255	“ Why does n’t he ride away till it ’s gone by ? ”
49808	49830	49832	49832	Ursula	255	“ No — ! No — ! Let her go ! Let her go , you fool , you fool — ! ”
50066	50076	50078	50078	Ursula	255	“ And she ’s bleeding ! She ’s bleeding ! ”
50461	50469	50434	50434	Gudrun	160	“ I should think you ’re proud . ”
50572	50591	50562	50562	he	1380	“ A masterful young jockey , that ; ’ll have his own road , if ever anybody would . ”
50592	50595	50597	50597	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
50606	50659	50600	50600	her	160	“ Why could n’t he take the horse away , till the trucks had gone by ? He ’s a fool , and a bully . Does he think it ’s manly , to torture a horse ? It ’s a living thing , why should he bully it and torture it ? ”
50677	50739	50671	50671	his	1380	“ Yes , it ’s as nice a little mare as you could set eyes on — beautiful little thing , beautiful . Now you could n’t see his father treat any animal like that — not you . They ’re as different as they welly can be , Gerald Crich and his father — two different men , different made . ”
50746	50754	50756	50756	Ursula	255	“ But why does he do it ? ”
50758	50785	50756	50756	Ursula	255	“ why does he ? Does he think he ’s grand , when he ’s bullied a sensitive creature , ten times as sensitive as himself ? ”
50814	50829	50830	50830	he	4658	“ I expect he ’s got to train the mare to stand to anything , ”
50833	50868	50830	50830	he	4658	“ A pure - bred Harab — not the sort of breed as is used to round here — different sort from our sort altogether . They say as he got her from Constantinople . ”
50869	50873	50875	50875	Ursula	255	“ He would ! ”
50877	50900	50875	50875	Ursula	255	“ He ’d better have left her to the Turks , I ’m sure they would have had more decency towards her . ”
51413	51428	51392	51394	the elder man	1423	“ What price that , eh ? She ’ll do , wo n’t she ? ”
51429	51432	51434	51436	the young man	676	“ Which ? ”
51444	51471	51434	51436	the young man	676	“ Her with the red stockings . What d’you say ? I ’d give my week ’s wages for five minutes ; what!—just for five minutes . ”
51478	51490	51491	51491	he	676	“ Your missis ’ ud have summat to say to you , ”
51535	51544	51545	51546	the man	4658	“ You ’re first class , you are , ”
51556	51569	51571	51573	the younger man	1430	“ Do you think it would be worth a week ’s wages ? ”
51577	51592	51571	51573	the younger man	1430	“ Do I ? I ’d put ’em bloody - well down this second — ”
51630	51633	51634	51634	he	1430	“ No , ”
51637	51646	51634	51634	he	1430	“ It ’s not worth that to me . ”
51647	51651	51653	51655	the old man	1432	“ Is n’t ? ”
51657	51668	51653	51655	the old man	1432	“ By God , if it is n’t to me ! ”
51756	51768	51770	51770	Gudrun	160	“ It has a foul kind of beauty , this place , ”
51777	51803	51770	51770	Gudrun	160	“ Ca n’t you feel in some way , a thick , hot attraction in it ? I can . And it quite stupifies me . ”
53879	53884	53886	53886	Hermione	168	“ There ’s Gudrun , ”
53895	53908	53886	53886	Hermione	168	“ We will go and speak to her . Do you mind ? ”
53981	53989	53991	53991	Hermione	168	“ How do you do , Gudrun ? ”
54002	54008	53991	53991	Hermione	168	“ What are you doing ? ”
54009	54021	54058	54058	Hermione	168	“ How do you do , Hermione ? I was sketching . ”
54022	54026	54058	54058	Hermione	168	“ Were you ? ”
54040	54052	54058	54058	Hermione	168	“ May we see ? I should like to so much . ”
54063	54066	54068	54068	Gudrun	160	“ Well — ”
54080	54088	54072	54072	she	160	exposed—“there ’s nothing in the least interesting . ”
54089	54102	54103	54103	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t there ? But let me see , will you ? ”
54304	54312	54314	54314	Hermione	168	“ That ’s what you have done , ”
54346	54355	54332	54332	Gudrun	160	“ That is it , is n’t it ? ”
54362	54365	54367	54367	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
54375	54380	54382	54382	Gerald	255	“ Let me look , ”
54468	54471	54473	54473	Hermione	168	“ There ! ”
54483	54501	54473	54473	Hermione	168	“ I ’m so sorry , so awfully sorry . Ca n’t you get it , Gerald ? ”
54552	54559	54567	54567	Gudrun	160	“ It is of no importance , ”
54608	54618	54620	54620	Hermione	168	“ I ’m so dreadfully sorry — dreadfully sorry , ”
54622	54632	54620	54620	Hermione	168	“ I ’m afraid it was all my fault . ”
54633	54654	54656	54656	Gudrun	160	“ It ’s of no importance — really , I assure you — it does n’t matter in the least , ”
54698	54705	54707	54707	Hermione	168	“ I ’m so dreadfully sorry , ”
54717	54726	54713	54713	Gudrun	160	“ Is there nothing that can be done ? ”
54727	54732	54734	54734	Gudrun	160	“ In what way ? ”
54740	54748	54734	54734	Gudrun	160	“ Ca n’t we save the drawings ? ”
54768	54773	54775	54775	Gudrun	160	“ I assure you , ”
54781	54804	54775	54775	Gudrun	160	“ the drawings are quite as good as ever they were , for my purpose . I want them only for reference . ”
54805	54839	54757	54757	Gudrun	160	“ But ca n’t I give you a new book ? I wish you ’d let me do that . I feel so truly sorry . I feel it was all my fault . ”
54840	54847	54849	54849	Gudrun	160	“ As far as I saw , ”
54851	54892	54849	54849	Gudrun	160	“ it was n’t your fault at all . If there was any fault , it was Mr Crich ’s . But the whole thing is entirely trivial , and it really is ridiculous to take any notice of it . ”
54953	54964	54965	54965	he	255	“ I ’m awfully glad if it does n’t matter , ”
54968	54977	54965	54965	he	255	“ if there ’s no real harm done . ”
55015	55027	54998	54998	she	160	“ Of course , it does n’t matter in the least . ”
55110	55127	55106	55106	Her	160	“ Good - bye ! I ’m so glad you forgive me . Gooood - bye ! ”
55209	55220	55225	55225	she	168	“ Are n’t we going too much to the left ? ”
55248	55256	55257	55257	he	255	“ I think it ’s all right , ”
55563	55587	55553	55553	he	1593	“ How do you do ? I ’m making the punt water - tight . Tell me if you think it is right . ”
55594	55612	55613	55613	he	1593	“ You are your father ’s daughter , so you can tell me if it will do , ”
55625	55636	55637	55637	she	168	“ I am sure I am my father ’s daughter , ”
55646	55665	55637	55637	she	168	“ But I do n’t know anything about carpentry . It looks right , do n’t you think ? ”
55666	55716	55720	55720	they	1597	“ Yes , I think . I hope it wo n’t let me to the bottom , that ’s all . Though even so , it is n’t a great matter , I should come up again . Help me to get it into the water , will you ? ”
55731	55734	55735	55735	he	1593	“ Now , ”
55738	55764	55735	55735	he	1593	“ I ’ll try it and you can watch what happens . Then if it carries , I ’ll take you over to the island . ”
55765	55768	55769	55769	she	168	“ Do , ”
55845	55849	55850	55850	he	1593	“ Rather overgrown , ”
55858	55876	55850	55850	he	1593	“ but very nice . I ’ll come and fetch you . The boat leaks a little . ”
55894	55902	55903	55903	he	1593	“ It ’ll float us all right , ”
55945	55952	55953	55953	he	1593	“ I shall mow this down , ”
55956	55969	55953	55953	he	1593	“ and then it will be romantic — like Paul et Virginie . ”
55970	55981	55983	55983	Ursula	255	“ Yes , one could have lovely Watteau picnics here , ”
55991	56000	56001	56001	he	1593	“ I do n’t want Watteau picnics here , ”
56004	56009	56010	56010	she	168	“ Only your Virginie , ”
56013	56017	56018	56018	he	1593	“ Virginie enough , ”
56022	56032	56018	56018	he	1593	“ No , I do n’t want her either . ”
56062	56072	56073	56073	she	168	“ You have been ill ; have n’t you ? ”
56079	56082	56083	56083	he	1593	“ Yes , ”
56110	56117	56118	56118	she	168	“ Has it made you frightened ? ”
56121	56125	56126	56126	he	1593	“ What of ? ”
56157	56170	56171	56171	she	168	“ It is frightening to be very ill , is n’t it ? ”
56174	56180	56181	56181	he	1593	“ It is n’t pleasant , ”
56184	56215	56181	56181	he	1593	“ Whether one is really afraid of death , or not , I have never decided . In one mood , not a bit , in another , very much . ”
56216	56249	56250	56250	He	1593	“ But does n’t it make you feel ashamed ? I think it makes one so ashamed , to be ill — illness is so terribly humiliating , do n’t you think ? ”
56256	56259	56260	56260	he	1593	“ Maybe , ”
56263	56328	56260	56260	he	1593	“ Though one knows all the time one ’s life is n’t really right , at the source . That ’s the humiliation . I do n’t see that the illness counts so much , after that . One is ill because one does n’t live properly — can’t . It ’s the failure to live that makes one ill , and humiliates one . ”
56329	56337	56338	56338	she	168	“ But do you fail to live ? ”
56344	56375	56338	56338	she	168	“ Why yes — I do n’t make much of a success of my days . One seems always to be bumping one ’s nose against the blank wall ahead . ”
56397	56402	56403	56403	she	168	“ Your poor nose ! ”
56414	56421	56422	56422	he	1593	“ No wonder it ’s ugly , ”
56451	56464	56465	56465	she	168	“ But I ’m happy — I think life is awfully jolly , ”
56468	56471	56472	56472	he	1593	“ Good , ”
56540	56549	56550	56550	she	168	“ I do enjoy things — don’t you ? ”
56553	56607	56550	56550	she	168	“ Oh yes ! But it infuriates me that I ca n’t get right , at the really growing part of me . I feel all tangled and messed up , and I ca n’t get straight anyhow . I do n’t know what really to do . One must do something somewhere . ”
56608	56616	56617	56617	she	168	“ Why should you always be doing ? ”
56620	56651	56617	56617	she	168	“ It is so plebeian . I think it is much better to be really patrician , and to do nothing but just be oneself , like a walking flower . ”
56652	56657	56658	56658	he	1593	“ I quite agree , ”
56661	56718	56658	56658	he	1593	“ if one has burst into blossom . But I ca n’t get my flower to blossom anyhow . Either it is blighted in the bud , or has got the smother - fly , or it is n’t nourished . Curse it , it is n’t even a bud . It is a contravened knot . ”
56782	56788	56789	56789	she	168	“ And why is it , ”
56794	56808	56789	56789	she	168	“ that there is no flowering , no dignity of human life now ? ”
56809	56892	56766	56766	She	168	“ The whole idea is dead . Humanity itself is dry - rotten , really . There are myriads of human beings hanging on the bush — and they look very nice and rosy , your healthy young men and women . But they are apples of Sodom , as a matter of fact , Dead Sea Fruit , gall - apples . It is n’t true that they have any significance — their insides are full of bitter , corrupt ash . ”
56893	56900	56902	56902	Ursula	255	“ But there are good people , ”
56904	56928	56902	56902	Ursula	255	“ Good enough for the life of today . But mankind is a dead tree , covered with fine brilliant galls of people . ”
56955	56966	56967	56967	she	168	“ And if it is so , why is it ? ”
56984	57036	56972	56972	They	1610	“ Why , why are people all balls of bitter dust ? Because they wo n’t fall off the tree when they ’re ripe . They hang on to their old positions when the position is over - past , till they become infested with little worms and dry - rot . ”
57069	57082	57083	57083	she	168	“ But even if everybody is wrong — where are you right ? ”
57086	57093	57083	57083	she	168	“ where are you any better ? ”
57094	57099	57100	57100	he	1609	“ I?—I’m not right , ”
57104	57272	57083	57083	she	168	“ At least my only rightness lies in the fact that I know it . I detest what I am , outwardly . I loathe myself as a human being . Humanity is a huge aggregate lie , and a huge lie is less than a small truth . Humanity is less , far less than the individual , because the individual may sometimes be capable of truth , and humanity is a tree of lies . And they say that love is the greatest thing ; they persist in saying this , the foul liars , and just look at what they do ! Look at all the millions of people who repeat every minute that love is the greatest , and charity is the greatest — and see what they are doing all the time . By their works ye shall know them , for dirty liars and cowards , who dare n’t stand by their own actions , much less by their own words . ”
57273	57276	57278	57278	Ursula	255	“ But , ”
57281	57313	57278	57278	Ursula	255	“ that does n’t alter the fact that love is the greatest , does it ? What they do does n’t alter the truth of what they say , does it ? ”
57314	57539	57083	57083	she	168	“ Completely , because if what they say were true , then they could n’t help fulfilling it . But they maintain a lie , and so they run amok at last . It ’s a lie to say that love is the greatest . You might as well say that hate is the greatest , since the opposite of everything balances . What people want is hate — hate and nothing but hate . And in the name of righteousness and love , they get it . They distil themselves with nitroglycerine , all the lot of them , out of very love . It ’s the lie that kills . If we want hate , let us have it — death , murder , torture , violent destruction — let us have it : but not in the name of love . But I abhor humanity , I wish it was swept away . It could go , and there would be no absolute loss , if every human being perished tomorrow . The reality would be untouched . Nay , it would be better . The real tree of life would then be rid of the most ghastly , heavy crop of Dead Sea Fruit , the intolerable burden of myriad simulacra of people , an infinite weight of mortal lies . ”
57540	57551	57553	57553	Ursula	255	“ So you ’d like everybody in the world destroyed ? ”
57555	57560	57553	57553	Ursula	255	“ I should indeed . ”
57561	57569	57608	57608	his	1611	“ And the world empty of people ? ”
57570	57603	57608	57608	his	1611	“ Yes truly . You yourself , do n’t you find it a beautiful clean thought , a world empty of people , just uninterrupted grass , and a hare sitting up ? ”
57655	57658	57659	57659	she	1612	“ But , ”
57662	57677	57659	57659	she	1612	“ you ’d be dead yourself , so what good would it do you ? ”
57678	57724	57608	57608	his	1611	“ I would die like a shot , to know that the earth would really be cleaned of all the people . It is the most beautiful and freeing thought . Then there would never be another foul humanity created , for a universal defilement . ”
57725	57728	57730	57730	Ursula	255	“ No , ”
57732	57738	57730	57730	Ursula	255	“ there would be nothing . ”
57739	57760	57608	57608	his	1611	“ What ! Nothing ? Just because humanity was wiped out ? You flatter yourself . There ’d be everything . ”
57761	57771	57608	57608	his	1611	“ But how , if there were no people ? ”
57772	57864	57870	57870	he	255	“ Do you think that creation depends on man ! It merely does n’t . There are the trees and the grass and birds . I much prefer to think of the lark rising up in the morning upon a humanless world . Man is a mistake , he must go . There is the grass , and hares and adders , and the unseen hosts , actual angels that go about freely when a dirty humanity does n’t interrupt them — and good pure - tissued demons : very nice . ”
57942	58008	57931	57931	Her	1614	“ If only man was swept off the face of the earth , creation would go on so marvellously , with a new start , non - human . Man is one of the mistakes of creation — like the ichthyosauri . If only he were gone again , think what lovely things would come out of the liberated days;—things straight out of the fire . ”
58009	58017	58018	58018	she	1614	“ But man will never be gone , ”
58032	58040	58018	58018	she	1614	“ The world will go with him . ”
58041	58045	58046	58046	he	255	“ Ah no , ”
58049	58152	58046	58046	he	255	“ not so . I believe in the proud angels and the demons that are our fore - runners . They will destroy us , because we are not proud enough . The ichthyosauri were not proud : they crawled and floundered as we do . And besides , look at elder - flowers and bluebells — they are a sign that pure creation takes place — even the butterfly . But humanity never gets beyond the caterpillar stage — it rots in the chrysalis , it never will have wings . It is anti - creation , like monkeys and baboons . ”
58329	58332	58333	58333	she	1614	“ But , ”
58336	58354	58333	58333	she	1614	“ you believe in individual love , even if you do n’t believe in loving humanity — ? ”
58355	58483	58538	58538	she	1614	“ I do n’t believe in love at all — that is , any more than I believe in hate , or in grief . Love is one of the emotions like all the others — and so it is all right whilst you feel it . But I ca n’t see how it becomes an absolute . It is just part of human relationships , no more . And it is only part of any human relationship . And why one should be required always to feel it , any more than one always feels sorrow or distant joy , I can not conceive . Love is n’t a desideratum — it is an emotion you feel or you do n’t feel , according to circumstance . ”
58484	58495	58496	58496	she	1614	“ Then why do you care about people at all ? ”
58499	58515	58496	58496	she	1614	“ if you do n’t believe in love ? Why do you bother about humanity ? ”
58516	58530	58593	58593	she	1614	“ Why do I ? Because I ca n’t get away from it . ”
58531	58537	58538	58538	she	1614	“ Because you love it , ”
58545	58552	58553	58553	he	1620	“ If I do love it , ”
58556	58562	58553	58553	he	1620	“ it is my disease . ”
58563	58578	58579	58579	she	1614	“ But it is a disease you do n’t want to be cured of , ”
58599	58615	58616	58616	she	1614	“ And if you do n’t believe in love , what do you believe in ? ”
58620	58632	58616	58616	she	1614	“ Simply in the end of the world , and grass ? ”
58641	58649	58650	58650	he	1620	“ I believe in the unseen hosts , ”
58653	58676	58650	58650	he	1620	“ And nothing else ? You believe in nothing visible , except grass and birds ? Your world is a poor show . ”
58677	58682	58683	58683	he	1620	“ Perhaps it is , ”
58946	58952	58953	58953	he	1620	“ The point about love , ”
58962	58998	58953	58953	he	1620	“ is that we hate the word because we have vulgarised it . It ought to be prescribed , tabooed from utterance , for many years , till we get a new , better idea . ”
59008	59017	59018	59018	she	1614	“ But it always means the same thing , ”
59021	59035	59036	59036	he	1620	“ Ah God , no , let it not mean that any more , ”
59039	59046	59036	59036	he	1620	“ Let the old meanings go . ”
59047	59054	59055	59055	she	1614	“ But still it is love , ”
59078	59081	59082	59082	he	1620	“ No , ”
59085	59108	59082	59082	he	1620	“ it is n’t . Spoken like that , never in the world . You ’ve no business to utter the word . ”
59109	59132	59133	59133	she	1614	“ I must leave it to you , to take it out of the Ark of the Covenant at the right moment , ”
59349	59362	59363	59363	she	1614	“ Do let us go to the shore , to follow them , ”
59438	59441	59442	59442	he	1614	“ Look , ”
59445	59463	59442	59442	he	1614	“ your boat of purple paper is escorting them , and they are a convoy of rafts . ”
59507	59514	59515	59515	she	1614	“ Why are they so lovely , ”
59518	59527	59515	59515	she	1614	“ Why do I think them so lovely ? ”
59528	59534	59535	59535	he	1614	“ They are nice flowers , ”
59547	59583	59538	59538	her	1614	“ You know that a daisy is a company of florets , a concourse , become individual . Do n’t the botanists put it highest in the line of development ? I believe they do . ”
59584	59594	59596	59596	Ursula	255	“ The compositæ , yes , I think so , ”
59623	59630	59631	59631	he	1614	“ Explain it so , then , ”
59634	59655	59631	59631	he	1614	“ The daisy is a perfect little democracy , so it ’s the highest of flowers , hence its charm . ”
59656	59659	59660	59660	she	1614	“ No , ”
59663	59673	59660	59660	she	1614	“ no — never . It is n’t democratic . ”
59674	59677	59678	59678	he	1614	“ No , ”
59681	59702	59678	59678	he	1614	“ It ’s the golden mob of the proletariat , surrounded by a showy white fence of the idle rich . ”
59703	59712	59713	59713	she	1614	“ How hateful — your hateful social orders ! ”
59716	59729	59678	59678	he	1614	“ Quite ! It ’s a daisy — we’ll leave it alone . ”
59730	59742	59743	59743	she	1614	“ Do . Let it be a dark horse for once , ”
59746	59757	59758	59758	she	1614	“ if anything can be a dark horse to you , ”
59829	59833	59834	59834	he	1614	“ You know , ”
59837	59859	59834	59834	he	1614	“ that I am having rooms here at the mill ? Do n’t you think we can have some good times ? ”
59860	59865	59866	59866	she	1614	“ Oh are you ? ”
59887	59898	59899	59899	he	1614	“ If I find I can live sufficiently by myself , ”
59902	59990	59899	59899	he	1614	“ I shall give up my work altogether . It has become dead to me . I do n’t believe in the humanity I pretend to be part of , I do n’t care a straw for the social ideals I live by , I hate the dying organic form of social mankind — so it ca n’t be anything but trumpery , to work at education . I shall drop it as soon as I am clear enough — tomorrow perhaps — and be by myself . ”
59991	59999	60001	60001	Ursula	255	“ Have you enough to live on ? ”
60003	60020	59899	59899	he	1614	“ Yes — I’ve about four hundred a year . That makes it easy for me . ”
60026	60032	60034	60034	Ursula	255	“ And what about Hermione ? ”
60036	60055	60034	60034	Ursula	255	“ That ’s over , finally — a pure failure , and never could have been anything else . ”
60056	60064	59899	59899	he	1614	“ But you still know each other ? ”
60065	60077	60034	60034	Ursula	255	“ We could hardly pretend to be strangers , could we ? ”
60084	60094	60096	60096	Ursula	255	“ But is n’t that a half - measure ? ”
60100	60107	60108	60108	he	255	“ I do n’t think so , ”
60111	60123	60108	60108	he	255	“ You ’ll be able to tell me if it is . ”
60139	60161	60162	60162	he	255	“ One must throw everything away , everything — let everything go , to get the one last thing one wants , ”
60165	60169	60170	60170	she	1644	“ What thing ? ”
60175	60184	60185	60185	he	255	“ I do n’t know — freedom together , ”
60227	60234	60235	60235	he	255	“ As a matter of fact , ”
60244	60268	60235	60235	he	255	“ I believe that is Hermione come now , with Gerald Crich . She wanted to see the rooms before they are furnished . ”
60269	60273	60275	60275	Ursula	255	“ I know , ”
60277	60286	60235	60235	he	255	“ She will superintend the furnishing for you . ”
60287	60294	60235	60235	he	255	“ Probably . Does it matter ? ”
60295	60304	60306	60306	Ursula	255	“ Oh no , I should think not , ”
60308	60337	60306	60306	Ursula	255	“ Though personally , I ca n’t bear her . I think she is a lie , if you like , you who are always talking about lies . ”
60350	60378	60339	60339	she	1645	“ Yes , and I do mind if she furnishes your rooms — I do mind . I mind that you keep her hanging on at all . ”
60386	60389	60390	60390	he	1646	“ Perhaps , ”
60393	60450	60390	60390	he	1646	“ I do n’t want her to furnish the rooms here — and I do n’t keep her hanging on . Only , I need n’t be churlish to her , need I ? At any rate , I shall have to go down and see them now . You ’ll come , wo n’t you ? ”
60451	60458	60459	60459	she	1647	“ I do n’t think so , ”
60465	60484	60459	60459	she	1647	“ Wo n’t you ? Yes do . Come and see the rooms as well . Do come . ”
60509	60522	60523	60523	he	1646	“ We know each other well , you and I , already , ”
60669	60674	60676	60676	Gerald	255	“ Here ’s Rupert ! ”
60696	60713	60715	60716	the labourer	1651	“ O - o - h them birds , they wo n’t let you speak — ! ”
60722	60729	60715	60716	the labourer	1651	“ I ’ll cover them up . ”
60758	60774	60775	60775	she	1652	“ Now will you stop it , and let a body speak for your row , ”
60819	60828	60830	60831	Mrs Salmon	263	“ Oh , they wo n’t go on , ”
60834	60842	60830	60831	Mrs Salmon	263	“ They ’ll go to sleep now . ”
60843	60846	60848	60848	Hermione	168	“ Really , ”
60852	60856	60858	60858	Gerald	255	“ They will , ”
60860	60876	60858	60858	Gerald	255	“ They will go to sleep automatically , now the impression of evening is produced . ”
60877	60884	60886	60886	Ursula	255	“ Are they so easily deceived ? ”
60888	60893	60895	60895	Gerald	255	“ Oh , yes , ”
60897	60937	60895	60895	Gerald	255	“ Do n’t you know the story of Fabre , who , when he was a boy , put a hen ’s head under her wing , and she straight away went to sleep ? It ’s quite true . ”
60938	60947	60949	60949	Birkin	169	“ And did that make him a naturalist ? ”
60951	60954	60956	60956	Gerald	255	“ Probably , ”
60983	60987	60988	60988	she	1660	“ How ridiculous ! ”
60991	61021	60988	60988	she	1660	“ It really thinks the night has come ! How absurd ! Really , how can one have any respect for a creature that is so easily taken in ! ”
61022	61025	61027	61027	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
61048	61057	61058	61058	she	168	“ Yes , does n’t he look comical ? ”
61061	61067	61058	61058	she	168	“ Like a stupid husband . ”
61093	61105	61079	61079	she	168	“ How did you come here ? We saw Gudrun too . ”
61106	61115	61117	61117	Ursula	255	“ I came to look at the pond , ”
61119	61127	61079	61079	she	168	“ and I found Mr Birkin there . ”
61128	61143	61079	61079	she	168	“ Did you ? This is quite a Brangwen land , is n’t it ! ”
61144	61152	61154	61154	Ursula	255	“ I ’m afraid I hoped so , ”
61156	61175	61154	61154	Ursula	255	“ I ran here for refuge , when I saw you down the lake , just putting off . ”
61176	61189	61190	61190	Hermione	168	“ Did you ! And now we ’ve run you to earth . ”
61216	61222	61224	61224	Ursula	255	“ I was going on , ”
61226	61248	61224	61224	Ursula	255	“ Mr Birkin wanted me to see the rooms . Is n’t it delightful to live here ? It is perfect . ”
61249	61252	61254	61254	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
61272	61280	61281	61281	she	168	“ How do you feel , Rupert ? ”
61293	61297	61298	61298	he	1661	“ Very well , ”
61301	61307	61298	61298	he	1661	“ Were you quite comfortable ? ”
61339	61343	61344	61344	he	1661	“ Quite comfortable , ”
61371	61381	61382	61382	she	168	“ And you think you ’ll be happy here ? ”
61387	61394	61382	61382	she	168	“ I ’m sure I shall . ”
61395	61409	61411	61412	the labourer	1651	“ I ’m sure I shall do anything for him as I can , ”
61416	61434	61411	61412	the labourer	1651	“ And I ’m sure our master will ; so I hope he ’ll find himself comfortable . ”
61443	61449	61450	61450	she	168	“ Thank you so much , ”
61481	61488	61478	61478	she	168	“ Have you measured the rooms ? ”
61489	61492	61493	61493	he	1651	“ No , ”
61496	61504	61493	61493	he	1651	“ I ’ve been mending the punt . ”
61505	61512	61513	61513	she	168	“ Shall we do it now ? ”
61521	61532	61533	61533	he	1651	“ Have you got a tape measure , Mrs Salmon ? ”
61541	61552	61554	61555	the woman	873	“ Yes sir , I think I can find one , ”
61563	61578	61554	61555	the woman	873	“ This is the only one I ’ve got , if it will do . ”
61590	61596	61597	61597	she	873	“ Thank you so much , ”
61600	61612	61597	61597	she	873	“ It will do very nicely . Thank you so much . ”
61626	61635	61614	61614	she	873	“ Shall we do it now , Rupert ? ”
61636	61647	61648	61648	he	1651	“ What about the others , they ’ll be bored , ”
61652	61657	61659	61659	Hermione	168	“ Do you mind ? ”
61668	61674	61675	61675	they	1666	“ Not in the least , ”
61678	61686	61687	61687	she	873	“ Which room shall we do first ? ”
61710	61719	61720	61720	he	1651	“ We ’ll take them as they come , ”
61723	61737	61747	61747	she	1652	“ Should I be getting your teas ready , while you do that ? ”
61753	61757	61759	61759	Hermione	168	“ Would you ? ”
61793	61806	61778	61778	her	873	“ I should be so glad . Where shall we have it ? ”
61807	61826	61836	61836	Hermione	168	“ Where would you like it ? Shall it be in here , or out on the grass ? ”
61827	61834	61836	61836	Hermione	168	“ Where shall we have tea ? ”
61843	61870	61872	61872	Birkin	169	“ On the bank by the pond . And we ’ll carry the things up , if you ’ll just get them ready , Mrs Salmon , ”
61874	61878	61880	61882	the pleased woman	1672	“ All right , ”
61916	61924	61926	61926	Hermione	168	“ This is the dining - room , ”
61928	61943	61926	61926	Hermione	168	“ We ’ll measure it this way , Rupert — you go down there — ”
61944	61953	61955	61955	Gerald	255	“ Ca n’t I do it for you , ”
61966	61972	61974	61974	Hermione	168	“ No , thank you , ”
62129	62135	62137	62137	Hermione	168	“ This is the study , ”
62139	62173	62137	62137	Hermione	168	“ Rupert , I have a rug that I want you to have for here . Will you let me give it to you ? Do — I want to give it you . ”
62174	62180	62181	62181	he	1684	“ What is it like ? ”
62185	62228	62181	62181	he	1684	“ You have n’t seen it . It is chiefly rose red , then blue , a metallic , mid - blue , and a very soft dark blue . I think you would like it . Do you think you would ? ”
62229	62235	62236	62236	he	1684	“ It sounds very nice , ”
62239	62250	62236	62236	he	1684	“ What is it ? Oriental ? With a pile ? ”
62251	62284	62181	62181	he	1684	“ Yes . Persian ! It is made of camel ’s hair , silky . I think it is called Bergamos — twelve feet by seven—. Do you think it will do ? ”
62285	62290	62291	62291	he	1684	“ It would do , ”
62294	62316	62291	62291	he	1684	“ But why should you give me an expensive rug ? I can manage perfectly well with my old Oxford Turkish . ”
62317	62330	62181	62181	he	1684	“ But may I give it to you ? Do let me . ”
62331	62338	62339	62339	She	1685	“ How much did it cost ? ”
62347	62358	62339	62339	She	1685	“ I do n’t remember . It was quite cheap . ”
62368	62379	62380	62380	he	1684	“ I do n’t want to take it , Hermione , ”
62383	62393	62394	62394	she	1685	“ Do let me give it to the rooms , ”
62412	62419	62394	62394	she	1685	“ I shall be so disappointed . ”
62420	62433	62434	62434	he	1684	“ You know I do n’t want you to give me things , ”
62438	62448	62449	62449	she	1685	“ I do n’t want to give you things , ”
62453	62460	62449	62449	she	1685	“ But will you have this ? ”
62461	62465	62466	62466	he	1684	“ All right , ”
62540	62549	62550	62550	she	168	“ Are you sure you were quite comfortable ? ”
62557	62560	62561	62561	he	1684	“ Perfectly , ”
62565	62594	62550	62550	she	168	“ And were you warm ? There is no down quilt . I am sure you need one . You must n’t have a great pressure of clothes . ”
62595	62601	62602	62602	he	1684	“ I ’ve got one , ”
62605	62611	62602	62602	he	1684	“ It is coming down . ”
62704	62719	62701	62701	Gerald	255	“ Oh , I hated you so much the other day , Mr Crich , ”
62720	62724	62726	62726	Gerald	255	“ What for ? ”
62732	62748	62726	62726	Gerald	255	“ For treating your horse so badly . Oh , I hated you so much ! ”
62749	62755	62757	62757	Hermione	168	“ What did he do ? ”
62759	62810	62757	62757	Hermione	168	“ He made his lovely sensitive Arab horse stand with him at the railway - crossing whilst a horrible lot of trucks went by ; and the poor thing , she was in a perfect frenzy , a perfect agony . It was the most horrible sight you can imagine . ”
62811	62820	62822	62822	Hermione	168	“ Why did you do it , Gerald ? ”
62828	62857	62822	62822	Hermione	168	“ She must learn to stand — what use is she to me in this country , if she shies and goes off every time an engine whistles . ”
62858	62865	62867	62867	Ursula	255	“ But why inflict unnecessary torture ? ”
62869	62915	62916	62916	Gerald	255	“ Why make her stand all that time at the crossing ? You might just as well have ridden back up the road , and saved all that horror . Her sides were bleeding where you had spurred her . It was too horrible — ! ”
62919	62926	62927	62927	he	255	“ I have to use her , ”
62930	62953	62927	62927	he	255	“ And if I ’m going to be sure of her at all , she ’ll have to learn to stand noises . ”
62954	62959	62961	62961	Ursula	255	“ Why should she ? ”
62966	63003	62961	62961	Ursula	255	“ She is a living creature , why should she stand anything , just because you choose to make her ? She has as much right to her own being , as you have to yours . ”
63004	63009	63011	63011	Gerald	255	“ There I disagree , ”
63013	63084	63011	63011	Gerald	255	“ I consider that mare is there for my use . Not because I bought her , but because that is the natural order . It is more natural for a man to take a horse and use it as he likes , than for him to go down on his knees to it , begging it to do as it wishes , and to fulfil its own marvellous nature . ”
63106	63181	63094	63094	her	168	“ I do think — I do really think we must have the courage to use the lower animal life for our needs . I do think there is something wrong , when we look on every living creature as if it were ourselves . I do feel , that it is false to project our own feelings on every animate creature . It is a lack of discrimination , a lack of criticism . ”
63182	63185	63187	63187	Birkin	169	“ Quite , ”
63190	63207	63187	63187	Birkin	169	“ Nothing is so detestable as the maudlin attributing of human feelings and consciousness to animals . ”
63208	63211	63213	63213	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
63217	63240	63213	63213	Hermione	168	“ we must really take a position . Either we are going to use the animals , or they will use us . ”
63241	63247	63249	63249	Gerald	255	“ That ’s a fact , ”
63251	63305	63249	63249	Gerald	255	“ A horse has got a will like a man , though it has no mind strictly . And if your will is n’t master , then the horse is master of you . And this is a thing I ca n’t help . I ca n’t help being master of the horse . ”
63306	63318	63320	63320	Hermione	168	“ If only we could learn how to use our will , ”
63322	63355	63320	63320	Hermione	168	“ we could do anything . The will can cure anything , and put anything right . That I am convinced of — if only we use the will properly , intelligibly . ”
63356	63367	63369	63369	Birkin	169	“ What do you mean by using the will properly ? ”
63371	63379	63380	63380	she	168	“ A very great doctor taught me , ”
63389	63432	63380	63380	she	168	“ He told me for instance , that to cure oneself of a bad habit , one should force oneself to do it , when one would not do it — make oneself do it — and then the habit would disappear . ”
63433	63439	63441	63441	Gerald	255	“ How do you mean ? ”
63443	63482	63441	63441	Gerald	255	“ If you bite your nails , for example . Then , when you do n’t want to bite your nails , bite them , make yourself bite them . And you would find the habit was broken . ”
63483	63488	63490	63490	Gerald	255	“ Is that so ? ”
63492	63535	63490	63490	Gerald	255	“ Yes . And in so many things , I have made myself well . I was a very queer and nervous girl . And by learning to use my will , simply by using my will , I made myself right . ”
63583	63594	63596	63596	Birkin	169	“ It is fatal to use the will like that , ”
63599	63609	63596	63596	Birkin	169	“ disgusting . Such a will is an obscenity . ”
63643	63651	63652	63652	she	168	“ I ’m sure it is n’t , ”
63812	63817	63818	63818	he	1701	“ And of course , ”
63823	63906	63818	63818	he	1701	“ horses have n’t got a complete will , like human beings . A horse has no one will . Every horse , strictly , has two wills . With one will , it wants to put itself in the human power completely — and with the other , it wants to be free , wild . The two wills sometimes lock — you know that , if ever you ’ve felt a horse bolt , while you ’ve been driving it . ”
63907	63920	63922	63922	Gerald	255	“ I have felt a horse bolt while I was driving it , ”
63924	63944	63922	63922	Gerald	255	“ but it did n’t make me know it had two wills . I only knew it was frightened . ”
63961	63975	63977	63977	Ursula	255	“ Why should a horse want to put itself in the human power ? ”
63979	63996	63977	63977	Ursula	255	“ That is quite incomprehensible to me . I do n’t believe it ever wanted it . ”
63997	64022	64024	64024	Birkin	169	“ Yes it did . It ’s the last , perhaps highest , love - impulse : resign your will to the higher being , ”
64026	64035	64024	64024	Birkin	169	“ What curious notions you have of love , ”
64039	64082	64024	64024	Birkin	169	“ And woman is the same as horses : two wills act in opposition inside her . With one will , she wants to subject herself utterly . With the other she wants to bolt , and pitch her rider to perdition . ”
64083	64090	64092	64092	Ursula	255	“ Then I ’m a bolter , ”
64100	64115	64117	64117	Birkin	169	“ It ’s a dangerous thing to domesticate even horses , let alone women , ”
64119	64128	64117	64117	Birkin	169	“ The dominant principle has some rare antagonists . ”
64129	64134	64136	64136	Ursula	255	“ Good thing too , ”
64138	64141	64143	64143	Gerald	255	“ Quite , ”
64150	64156	64143	64143	Gerald	255	“ There ’s more fun . ”
64174	64202	64163	64163	She	168	“ Is n’t the evening beautiful ! I get filled sometimes with such a great sense of beauty , that I feel I can hardly bear it . ”
64257	64265	64267	64267	Ursula	255	“ Would n’t you like a dress , ”
64271	64283	64267	64267	Ursula	255	“ of this yellow spotted with orange — a cotton dress ? ”
64284	64287	64289	64289	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
64309	64321	64267	64267	Ursula	255	“ Would n’t it be pretty ? I should love it . ”
64390	64454	64456	64456	Hermione	168	“ I really do not want to be forced into all this criticism and analysis of life . I really do want to see things in their entirety , with their beauty left to them , and their wholeness , their natural holiness . Do n’t you feel it , do n’t you feel you ca n’t be tortured into any more knowledge ? ”
64474	64477	64479	64479	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
64481	64495	64479	64479	Ursula	255	“ I do . I am sick of all this poking and prying . ”
64496	64506	64508	64508	Hermione	168	“ I ’m so glad you are . Sometimes , ”
64521	64584	64508	64508	Hermione	168	“ sometimes I wonder if I ought to submit to all this realisation , if I am not being weak in rejecting it . But I feel I can’t — I ca n’t . It seems to destroy everything . All the beauty and the — and the true holiness is destroyed — and I feel I ca n’t live without them . ”
64585	64597	64599	64599	Ursula	255	“ And it would be simply wrong to live without them , ”
64601	64637	64599	64599	Ursula	255	“ No , it is so irreverent to think that everything must be realised in the head . Really , something must be left to the Lord , there always is and always will be . ”
64638	64641	64643	64643	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
64650	64661	64662	64662	she	168	“ it should , should n’t it ? And Rupert — ”
64672	64718	64599	64599	Ursula	255	muse—“he can only tear things to pieces . He really is like a boy who must pull everything to pieces to see how it is made . And I ca n’t think it is right — it does seem so irreverent , as you say . ”
64719	64734	64736	64736	Ursula	255	“ Like tearing open a bud to see what the flower will be like , ”
64738	64759	64736	64736	Ursula	255	“ Yes . And that kills everything , does n’t it ? It does n’t allow any possibility of flowering . ”
64760	64765	64767	64767	Ursula	255	“ Of course not , ”
64769	64775	64767	64767	Ursula	255	“ It is purely destructive . ”
64776	64784	64785	64785	Hermione	168	“ It is , is n’t it ! ”
64883	64889	64891	64891	Hermione	168	“ Shall we be going ? ”
64893	64918	64891	64891	Hermione	168	“ Rupert , you are coming to Shortlands to dinner ? Will you come at once , will you come now , with us ? ”
64919	64925	64927	64927	Birkin	169	“ I ’m not dressed , ”
64929	64938	64927	64927	Birkin	169	“ And you know Gerald stickles for convention . ”
64939	64947	64949	64949	Gerald	255	“ I do n’t stickle for it , ”
64951	64991	64949	64949	Gerald	255	“ But if you ’d got as sick as I have of rowdy go - as - you - please in the house , you ’d prefer it if people were peaceful and conventional , at least at meals . ”
64992	64996	64998	64998	Birkin	169	“ All right , ”
65000	65012	64998	64998	Birkin	169	“ But ca n’t we wait for you while you dress ? ”
65016	65021	65022	65022	He	255	“ If you like . ”
65036	65039	65040	65040	she	1713	“ Only , ”
65047	65114	65040	65040	she	1713	“ I must say that , however man is lord of the beast and the fowl , I still do n’t think he has any right to violate the feelings of the inferior creation . I still think it would have been much more sensible and nice of you if you ’d trotted back up the road while the train went by , and been considerate . ”
65115	65119	65121	65121	Gerald	255	“ I see , ”
65129	65136	65121	65121	Gerald	255	“ I must remember another time . ”
65137	65147	65151	65151	herself	255	“ They all think I ’m an interfering female , ”
65219	65225	65226	65226	she	1714	“ She ’s really good , ”
65231	65239	65226	65226	she	1714	“ She really wants what is right . ”
65451	65460	65461	65461	she	1714	“ Why does he ask Gudrun as well ? ”
65467	65485	65461	65461	she	1714	“ Does he want to protect himself , or does he think I would not go alone ? ”
65512	65554	65506	65506	she	1714	“ I do n’t want Gudrun to be there , because I want him to say something more to me . So I sha n’t tell Gudrun anything about it , and I shall go alone . Then I shall know . ”
65780	65785	65786	65786	he	1737	“ You are alone ? ”
65789	65797	65786	65786	he	1737	“ Yes — Gudrun could not come . ”
65853	65860	65861	65861	she	1714	“ How nice the fuchsias are ! ”
65869	65884	65861	65861	she	1714	“ Are n’t they ! Did you think I had forgotten what I said ? ”
65893	65910	65911	65911	she	1714	“ I do n’t want you to remember it — if you do n’t want to , ”
65931	65934	65935	65935	he	1737	“ No , ”
65938	65985	65935	65935	he	1737	“ It is n’t that . Only — if we are going to know each other , we must pledge ourselves for ever . If we are going to make a relationship , even of friendship , there must be something final and infallible about it . ”
66035	66068	66025	66025	he	1737	“ I ca n’t say it is love I have to offer — and it is n’t love I want . It is something much more impersonal and harder — and rarer . ”
66080	66089	66077	66077	she	1714	“ You mean you do n’t love me ? ”
66097	66154	66077	66077	she	1714	“ Yes , if you like to put it like that . Though perhaps that is n’t true . I do n’t know . At any rate , I do n’t feel the emotion of love for you — no , and I do n’t want to . Because it gives out in the last issues . ”
66155	66164	66165	66165	she	1714	“ Love gives out in the last issues ? ”
66174	66267	66165	66165	she	1714	“ Yes , it does . At the very last , one is alone , beyond the influence of love . There is a real impersonal me , that is beyond love , beyond any emotional relationship . So it is with you . But we want to delude ourselves that love is the root . It is n’t . It is only the branches . The root is beyond love , a naked kind of isolation , an isolated me , that does not meet and mingle , and never can . ”
66286	66295	66296	66296	she	1714	“ And you mean you ca n’t love ? ”
66302	66325	66296	66296	she	1714	“ Yes , if you like . I have loved . But there is a beyond , where there is not love . ”
66346	66360	66361	66361	she	1714	“ But how do you know — if you have never really loved ? ”
66364	66407	66361	66361	she	1714	“ It is true , what I say ; there is a beyond , in you , in me , which is further than love , beyond the scope , as stars are beyond the scope of vision , some of them . ”
66408	66415	66417	66417	Ursula	255	“ Then there is no love , ”
66419	66438	66417	66417	Ursula	255	“ Ultimately , no , there is something else . But , ultimately , there is no love . ”
66467	66480	66451	66451	she	1714	“ Then let me go home — what am I doing here ? ”
66481	66487	66488	66488	he	255	“ There is the door , ”
66491	66498	66488	66488	he	255	“ You are a free agent . ”
66522	66533	66534	66534	she	1714	“ If there is no love , what is there ? ”
66540	66543	66544	66544	he	255	“ Something , ”
66561	66564	66544	66544	he	255	“ What ? ”
66589	66593	66594	66594	he	255	“ There is , ”
66604	66778	66594	66594	he	255	“ a final me which is stark and impersonal and beyond responsibility . So there is a final you . And it is there I would want to meet you — not in the emotional , loving plane — but there beyond , where there is no speech and no terms of agreement . There we are two stark , unknown beings , two utterly strange creatures , I would want to approach you , and you me . And there could be no obligation , because there is no standard for action there , because no understanding has been reaped from that plane . It is quite inhuman,—so there can be no calling to book , in any form whatsoever — because one is outside the pale of all that is accepted , and nothing known applies . One can only follow the impulse , taking that which lies in front , and responsible for nothing , asked for nothing , giving nothing , only each taking according to the primal desire . ”
66802	66809	66810	66810	she	1714	“ It is just purely selfish , ”
66813	66906	66907	66907	She	1714	“ If it is pure , yes . But it is n’t selfish at all . Because I do n’t know what I want of you . I deliver myself over to the unknown , in coming to you , I am without reserves or defences , stripped entirely , into the unknown . Only there needs the pledge between us , that we will both cast off everything , cast off ourselves even , and cease to be , so that that which is perfectly ourselves can take place in us . ”
66916	66930	66931	66931	she	1714	“ But it is because you love me , that you want me ? ”
66934	66955	66931	66931	she	1714	“ No it is n’t . It is because I believe in you — if I do believe in you . ”
66956	66962	66963	66963	she	1714	“ Are n’t you sure ? ”
66982	67001	67002	67002	he	1742	“ Yes , I must believe in you , or else I should n’t be here saying this , ”
67005	67028	67002	67002	he	1742	“ But that is all the proof I have . I do n’t feel any very strong belief at this particular moment . ”
67041	67052	67053	67053	she	1714	“ But do n’t you think me good - looking ? ”
67078	67090	67091	67091	he	1742	“ I do n’t feel that you ’re good - looking , ”
67094	67099	67100	67100	she	1714	“ Not even attractive ? ”
67113	67131	67132	67132	he	1742	“ Do n’t you see that it ’s not a question of visual appreciation in the least , ”
67135	67169	67132	67132	he	1742	“ I do n’t want to see you . I ’ve seen plenty of women , I ’m sick and weary of seeing them . I want a woman I do n’t see . ”
67170	67183	67184	67184	she	1714	“ I ’m sorry I ca n’t oblige you by being invisible , ”
67187	67190	67191	67191	he	1742	“ Yes , ”
67194	67226	67191	67191	he	1742	“ you are invisible to me , if you do n’t force me to be visually aware of you . But I do n’t want to see you or hear you . ”
67227	67239	67240	67240	she	1714	“ What did you ask me to tea for , then ? ”
67258	67321	67252	67252	He	1742	“ I want to find you , where you do n’t know your own existence , the you that your common self denies utterly . But I do n’t want your good looks , and I do n’t want your womanly feelings , and I do n’t want your thoughts nor opinions nor your ideas — they are all bagatelles to me . ”
67322	67330	67331	67331	she	1714	“ You are very conceited , Monsieur , ”
67334	67364	67331	67331	she	1714	“ How do you know what my womanly feelings are , or my thoughts or my ideas ? You do n’t even know what I think of you now . ”
67365	67374	67252	67252	He	1742	“ Nor do I care in the slightest . ”
67375	67405	67252	67252	He	1742	“ I think you are very silly . I think you want to tell me you love me , and you go all this way round to do it . ”
67406	67410	67411	67411	he	1743	“ All right , ”
67420	67442	67411	67411	he	1743	“ Now go away then , and leave me alone . I do n’t want any more of your meretricious persiflage . ”
67443	67449	67450	67450	she	1744	“ Is it really persiflage ? ”
67517	67528	67529	67529	he	1743	“ What I want is a strange conjunction with you — ”
67533	67563	67529	67529	he	1743	“ not meeting and mingling — you are quite right — but an equilibrium , a pure balance of two single beings — as the stars balance each other . ”
67608	67615	67616	67616	she	1744	“ Is n’t this rather sudden ? ”
67624	67638	67639	67639	he	1743	“ Best to read the terms of the contract , before we sign , ”
67709	67715	67717	67717	Birkin	169	“ What ’s he after ? ”
67999	68006	68008	68008	Birkin	169	“ She is a wild cat , ”
68010	68019	68008	68008	Birkin	169	“ She has come in from the woods . ”
68183	68191	68193	68193	Ursula	255	“ Now why does he do that ? ”
68197	68204	68206	68206	Birkin	169	“ They are on intimate terms , ”
68208	68217	68206	68206	Birkin	169	“ And is that why he hits her ? ”
68218	68221	68223	68223	Birkin	169	“ Yes , ”
68225	68238	68223	68223	Birkin	169	“ I think he wants to make it quite obvious to her . ”
68239	68247	68248	68248	she	1744	“ Is n’t it horrid of him ! ”
68263	68275	68257	68257	she	1744	“ Stop it , do n’t bully . Stop hitting her . ”
68302	68310	68311	68311	Birkin	169	“ Are you a bully , Mino ? ”
68350	68353	68355	68355	Ursula	255	“ Mino , ”
68357	68372	68355	68355	Ursula	255	“ I do n’t like you . You are a bully like all males . ”
68373	68376	68378	68378	Birkin	169	“ No , ”
68380	68438	68378	68378	Birkin	169	“ he is justified . He is not a bully . He is only insisting to the poor stray that she shall acknowledge him as a sort of fate , her own fate : because you can see she is fluffy and promiscuous as the wind . I am with him entirely . He wants superfine stability . ”
68439	68445	68447	68447	Ursula	255	“ Yes , I know ! ”
68449	68474	68447	68447	Ursula	255	“ He wants his own way — I know what your fine words work down to — bossiness , I call it , bossiness . ”
68489	68498	68500	68500	Birkin	169	“ I quite agree with you , Miciotto , ”
68505	68516	68500	68500	Birkin	169	“ Keep your male dignity , and your higher understanding . ”
68567	68586	68588	68588	Birkin	169	“ Now he will find the belle sauvage once more , and entertain her with his superior wisdom , ”
68614	68647	68611	68611	she	1771	“ Oh it makes me so cross , this assumption of male superiority ! And it is such a lie ! One would n’t mind if there were any justification for it . ”
68648	68653	68655	68655	Birkin	169	“ The wild cat , ”
68657	68669	68655	68655	Birkin	169	“ does n’t mind . She perceives that it is justified . ”
68670	68674	68676	68676	Ursula	255	“ Does she ! ”
68678	68687	68676	68676	Ursula	255	“ And tell it to the Horse Marines . ”
68688	68693	68655	68655	Birkin	169	“ To them also . ”
68694	68722	68655	68655	Birkin	169	“ It is just like Gerald Crich with his horse — a lust for bullying — a real Wille zur Macht — so base , so petty . ”
68723	68811	68676	68676	Ursula	255	“ I agree that the Wille zur Macht is a base and petty thing . But with the Mino , it is the desire to bring this female cat into a pure stable equilibrium , a transcendent and abiding rapport with the single male . Whereas without him , as you see , she is a mere stray , a fluffy sporadic bit of chaos . It is a volonté de pouvoir , if you like , a will to ability , taking pouvoir as a verb . ”
68812	68824	68655	68655	Birkin	169	“ Ah — ! Sophistries ! It ’s the old Adam . ”
68825	68852	68655	68655	Birkin	169	“ Oh yes . Adam kept Eve in the indestructible paradise , when he kept her single with himself , like a star in its orbit . ”
68853	68858	68860	68860	Ursula	255	“ Yes — yes — ”
68868	68927	68863	68863	her	1772	“ There you are — a star in its orbit ! A satellite — a satellite of Mars — that ’s what she is to be ! There — there — you’ve given yourself away ! You want a satellite , Mars and his satellite ! You ’ve said it — you’ve said it — you’ve dished yourself ! ”
68968	68977	68978	68978	he	1773	“ I ’ve not said it at all , ”
68981	68992	68978	68978	he	1773	“ if you will give me a chance to speak . ”
68993	68998	68999	68999	she	1772	“ No , no ! ”
69002	69033	68999	68999	she	1772	“ I wo n’t let you speak . You ’ve said it , a satellite , you ’re not going to wriggle out of it . You ’ve said it . ”
69034	69047	69048	69048	he	1773	“ You ’ll never believe now that I have n’t said it , ”
69051	69069	69048	69048	he	1773	“ I neither implied nor indicated nor mentioned a satellite , nor intended a satellite , never . ”
69070	69074	69075	69075	she	1772	“ You prevaricator ! ”
69082	69089	69091	69095	the landlady from the doorway	1774	“ Tea is ready , sir , ”
69118	69125	69097	69097	They	1775	“ Thank you , Mrs Daykin . ”
69141	69147	69148	69148	he	1773	“ Come and have tea , ”
69151	69159	69160	69160	she	1772	“ Yes , I should love it , ”
69177	69199	69167	69167	They	1536	“ I did not say , nor imply , a satellite . I meant two single equal stars balanced in conjunction — ”
69200	69214	69215	69215	she	1772	“ You gave yourself away , you gave away your little game completely , ”
69245	69252	69253	69253	she	1772	“ What good things to eat ! ”
69256	69262	69263	69263	he	1773	“ Take your own sugar , ”
69330	69337	69338	69338	she	1772	“ Your things are so lovely ! ”
69344	69382	69338	69338	she	1772	“ I like them . It gives me real pleasure to use things that are attractive in themselves — pleasant things . And Mrs Daykin is good . She thinks everything is wonderful , for my sake . ”
69383	69386	69388	69388	Ursula	255	“ Really , ”
69390	69423	69338	69338	she	1772	“ landladies are better than wives , nowadays . They certainly care a great deal more . It is much more beautiful and complete here now , than if you were married . ”
69424	69432	69433	69433	he	1773	“ But think of the emptiness within , ”
69436	69439	69440	69440	she	1772	“ No , ”
69443	69466	69440	69440	she	1772	“ I am jealous that men have such perfect landladies and such beautiful lodgings . There is nothing left them to desire . ”
69467	69490	69338	69338	she	1772	“ In the house - keeping way , we ’ll hope not . It is disgusting , people marrying for a home . ”
69491	69494	69496	69496	Ursula	255	“ Still , ”
69498	69513	69338	69338	she	1772	“ a man has very little need for a woman now , has he ? ”
69514	69554	69440	69440	she	1772	“ In outer things , maybe — except to share his bed and bear his children . But essentially , there is just the same need as there ever was . Only nobody takes the trouble to be essential . ”
69555	69559	69560	69560	she	1772	“ How essential ? ”
69563	69568	69569	69569	he	1773	“ I do think , ”
69572	69604	69569	69569	he	1773	“ that the world is only held together by the mystic conjunction , the ultimate unison between people — a bond . And the immediate bond is between man and woman . ”
69605	69613	69615	69615	Ursula	255	“ But it ’s such old hat , ”
69617	69633	69615	69615	Ursula	255	“ Why should love be a bond ? No , I ’m not having any . ”
69634	69641	69642	69642	he	1773	“ If you are walking westward , ”
69645	69670	69642	69642	he	1773	“ you forfeit the northern and eastward and southern direction . If you admit a unison , you forfeit all the possibilities of chaos . ”
69671	69677	69678	69678	she	1772	“ But love is freedom , ”
69681	69689	69690	69690	he	1773	“ Do n’t ca nt to me , ”
69693	69714	69690	69690	he	1773	“ Love is a direction which excludes all other directions . It ’s a freedom together , if you like . ”
69715	69718	69719	69719	she	1772	“ No , ”
69722	69727	69719	69719	she	1772	“ love includes everything . ”
69728	69733	69734	69734	he	1773	“ Sentimental ca nt , ”
69737	69819	69734	69734	he	1773	“ You want the state of chaos , that ’s all . It is ultimate nihilism , this freedom - in - love business , this freedom which is love and love which is freedom . As a matter of fact , if you enter into a pure unison , it is irrevocable , and it is never pure till it is irrevocable . And when it is irrevocable , it is one way , like the path of a star . ”
69820	69823	69824	69824	she	1772	“ Ha ! ”
69828	69836	69824	69824	she	1772	“ It is the old dead morality . ”
69837	69840	69841	69841	he	1773	“ No , ”
69844	69897	69841	69841	he	1773	“ it is the law of creation . One is committed . One must commit oneself to a conjunction with the other — for ever . But it is not selfless — it is a maintaining of the self in mystic balance and integrity — like a star balanced with another star . ”
69898	69911	69912	69912	she	1772	“ I do n’t trust you when you drag in the stars , ”
69915	69934	69912	69912	she	1772	“ If you were quite true , it would n’t be necessary to be so far - fetched . ”
69935	69942	69943	69943	he	1773	“ Do n’t trust me then , ”
69948	69957	69943	69943	he	1773	“ It is enough that I trust myself . ”
69958	69968	69969	69969	she	1772	“ And that is where you make another mistake , ”
69972	70013	69969	69969	she	1772	“ You do n’t trust yourself . You do n’t fully believe yourself what you are saying . You do n’t really want this conjunction , otherwise you would n’t talk so much about it , you ’d get it . ”
70023	70026	70027	70027	he	1773	“ How ? ”
70030	70035	70036	70036	she	1772	“ By just loving , ”
70054	70102	70051	70051	he	1773	“ I tell you , I do n’t believe in love like that . I tell you , you want love to administer to your egoism , to subserve you . Love is a process of subservience with you — and with everybody . I hate it . ”
70103	70106	70107	70107	she	1772	“ No , ”
70122	70136	70107	70107	she	1772	“ It is a process of pride — I want to be proud — ”
70137	70150	70151	70151	he	1773	“ Proud and subservient , proud and subservient , I know you , ”
70155	70189	70151	70151	he	1773	“ Proud and subservient , then subservient to the proud — I know you and your love . It is a tick - tack , tick - tack , a dance of opposites . ”
70190	70195	70196	70196	she	1772	“ Are you sure ? ”
70200	70206	70196	70196	she	1772	“ what my love is ? ”
70207	70213	70214	70214	he	1773	“ Yes , I am , ”
70217	70221	70222	70222	she	1772	“ So cocksure ! ”
70225	70244	70222	70222	she	1772	“ How can anybody ever be right , who is so cocksure ? It shows you are wrong . ”
70263	70272	70273	70273	he	1773	“ Tell me about yourself and your people , ”
70364	70372	70373	70373	he	1773	“ If she really could pledge herself , ”
70397	70405	70406	70406	he	1773	“ We have all suffered so much , ”
70439	70444	70445	70445	she	1772	“ Have n’t we ! ”
70455	70465	70445	70445	she	1772	“ It is almost absurd , is n’t it ? ”
70466	70470	70471	70471	he	1773	“ Quite absurd , ”
70474	70482	70471	70471	he	1773	“ Suffering bores me , any more . ”
70483	70489	70490	70490	He	1773	“ So it does me . ”
70589	70603	70604	70604	she	1772	“ Say you love me , say ‘ my love ’ to me , ”
70624	70631	70632	70632	he	1773	“ I love you right enough , ”
70637	70647	70632	70632	he	1773	“ But I want it to be something else . ”
70648	70655	70656	70656	she	1772	“ But why ? But why ? ”
70667	70674	70656	70656	she	1772	“ Why is n’t it enough ? ”
70675	70683	70684	70684	he	1773	“ Because we can go one better , ”
70693	70700	70701	70701	she	1772	“ No , we ca n’t , ”
70713	70735	70736	70736	She	1772	“ We can only love each other . Say ‘ my love ’ to me , say it , say it . ”
70767	70796	70744	70744	He	1773	“ Yes,—my love , yes,—my love . Let love be enough then . I love you then — I love you . I ’m bored by the rest . ”
70797	70800	70801	70801	she	1772	“ Yes , ”
71221	71246	71214	71215	her father	583	“ Do n’t you think you might as well get yourself up for a Christmas cracker , an ’ ha ’ done with it ? ”
71285	71303	71274	71274	she	160	“ Regarde , regarde ces gens - là ! Ne sont - ils pas des hiboux incroyables ? ”
71325	71334	71335	71335	Ursula	255	“ No , really , it ’s impossible ! ”
71507	71516	71518	71518	Gudrun	160	“ Look at the young couple in front , ”
71572	71581	71583	71583	Ursula	255	“ We are roaring at you , mother , ”
71603	71607	71608	71608	she	273	“ Oh indeed ! ”
71611	71627	71608	71608	she	273	“ What is there so very funny about me , I should like to know ? ”
71718	71729	71731	71731	Ursula	255	“ You look so stately , like a country Baroness , ”
71746	71753	71756	71756	Gudrun	160	“ Just like a country Baroness ! ”
71775	71788	71790	71791	the father	646	“ Go home , you pair of idiots , great giggling idiots ! ”
71796	71803	71805	71805	Ursula	255	“ Mm - m - er ! ”
71829	71845	71847	71848	Mrs Brangwen	273	“ Do n’t be so silly as to take any notice of the great gabies , ”
71855	71874	71875	71875	he	646	“ I ’ll see if I ’m going to be followed by a pair of giggling yelling jackanapes — ”
71897	71912	71914	71915	Mrs Brangwen	273	“ Why you ’re as silly as they are , to take any notice , ”
71925	71934	71936	71936	Ursula	255	“ There are some people coming , father , ”
71985	72021	71976	71976	Brangwen	273	“ I ’m going back home if there ’s any more of this . I ’m damned if I ’m going to be made a fool of in this fashion , in the public road . ”
72057	72063	72053	72053	They	4851	“ in the public road . ”
72078	72088	72089	72089	she	160	“ But we were n’t laughing to hurt you , ”
72102	72113	72089	72089	she	160	“ We were laughing because we ’re fond of you . ”
72114	72128	72130	72130	Ursula	255	“ We ’ll walk on in front , if they are so touchy , ”
72247	72251	72253	72253	Gudrun	160	“ My eye ! ”
72265	72286	72287	72287	Gudrun	160	“ there ’s a pretty crowd if you like ! Imagine yourself in the midst of that , my dear . ”
72299	72305	72306	72306	she	1863	“ It looks rather awful , ”
72310	72321	72323	72323	Gudrun	160	“ And imagine what they ’ll be like — imagine ! ”
72338	72348	72350	72350	Ursula	255	“ I suppose we can get away from them , ”
72353	72365	72367	72367	Gudrun	160	“ We ’re in a pretty fix if we ca n’t , ”
72381	72387	72388	72388	she	1863	“ We need n’t stay , ”
72391	72404	72406	72406	Gudrun	160	“ I certainly sha n’t stay five minutes among that little lot , ”
72420	72429	72431	72431	Gudrun	160	“ Policemen to keep you in , too ! ”
72433	72443	72431	72431	Gudrun	160	“ My word , this is a beautiful affair . ”
72444	72454	72456	72456	Ursula	255	“ We ’d better look after father and mother , ”
72459	72471	72473	72473	Gudrun	160	“ Mother ’s perfectly capable of getting through this little celebration , ”
72731	72744	72705	72705	he	1874	“ How do you do ? You ’re better , are you ? ”
72745	72768	72769	72769	His	1874	“ Yes , I ’m better . How do you do , Mrs Brangwen ? I know Gudrun and Ursula very well . ”
72795	72798	72800	72801	Mrs Brangwen	273	“ Yes , ”
72808	72819	72820	72820	He	1874	“ I have heard them speak of you often enough . ”
72937	72940	72942	72942	Gudrun	160	“ Why , ”
72945	72968	72942	72942	Gudrun	160	“ do n’t they have the manners to put their coats on , and not to assume such intimacy in their appearance . ”
73082	73089	73090	73090	Gudrun	160	“ Does n’t she look weird ! ”
73105	73111	73113	73113	Hermione	168	“ How do you do ! ”
73217	73223	73225	73225	Hermione	168	“ This is Mrs Brangwen , ”
73463	73472	73474	73474	Gerald	255	“ Wait a minute , wait a minute , ”
73513	73520	73500	73500	they	1901	“ Oh it ’s so nice ! ”
73527	73533	73500	73500	they	1901	“ It ’s quite lovely . ”
73568	73587	73588	73588	he	255	“ You would n’t care to go on board for the next trip , and have tea there ? ”
73591	73595	73597	73597	Gudrun	160	“ No thanks , ”
73600	73609	73597	73597	Gudrun	160	“ You do n’t care for the water ? ”
73610	73623	73624	73624	He	255	“ For the water ? Yes , I like it very much . ”
73633	73646	73624	73624	He	255	“ You do n’t care for going on a launch , then ? ”
73659	73662	73663	73663	she	160	“ No , ”
73666	73675	73655	73655	she	160	“ I ca n’t say that I do . ”
73687	73694	73696	73696	Ursula	255	“ Un peu trop de monde , ”
73700	73707	73696	73696	Ursula	255	“ Eh ? Trop de monde ! ”
73712	73722	73708	73708	He	255	“ Yes there ’s a fair number of ’em . ”
73729	73746	73747	73747	she	160	“ Have you ever been from Westminster Bridge to Richmond on one of the Thames steamers ? ”
73750	73753	73754	73754	he	255	“ No , ”
73757	73765	73754	73754	he	255	“ I ca n’t say I have . ”
73766	73782	73783	73783	She	160	“ Well , it ’s one of the most vile experiences I ’ve ever had . ”
73796	74053	73783	73783	She	160	“ There was absolutely nowhere to sit down , nowhere , a man just above sang ‘ Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep ’ the whole way ; he was blind and he had a small organ , one of those portable organs , and he expected money ; so you can imagine what that was like ; there came a constant smell of luncheon from below , and puffs of hot oily machinery ; the journey took hours and hours and hours ; and for miles , literally for miles , dreadful boys ran with us on the shore , in that awful Thames mud , going in up to the waist — they had their trousers turned back , and they went up to their hips in that indescribable Thames mud , their faces always turned to us , and screaming , exactly like carrion creatures , screaming ‘ ’ Ere y’are sir , ’ ere y’are sir , ’ ere y’are sir , ’ exactly like some foul carrion objects , perfectly obscene ; and paterfamilias on board , laughing when the boys went right down in that awful mud , occasionally throwing them a ha’penny . And if you ’d seen the intent look on the faces of these boys , and the way they darted in the filth when a coin was flung — really , no vulture or jackal could dream of approaching them , for foulness . I never would go on a pleasure boat again — never . ”
74096	74100	74101	74101	he	255	“ Of course , ”
74104	74115	74101	74101	he	255	“ every civilised body is bound to have its vermin . ”
74116	74119	74121	74121	Ursula	255	“ Why ? ”
74123	74130	74121	74121	Ursula	255	“ I do n’t have vermin . ”
74131	74172	74174	74174	Gudrun	160	“ And it ’s not that — it ’s the quality of the whole thing — paterfamilias laughing and thinking it sport , and throwing the ha’pennies , and materfamilias spreading her fat little knees and eating , continually eating — ”
74176	74179	74181	74181	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
74183	74211	74181	74181	Ursula	255	“ It is n’t the boys so much who are vermin ; it ’s the people themselves , the whole body politic , as you call it . ”
74215	74219	74220	74220	he	255	“ Never mind , ”
74223	74232	74220	74220	he	255	“ You sha n’t go on the launch . ”
74287	74311	74312	74312	he	255	“ Will you have tea here then , or go across to the house , where there ’s a tent on the lawn ? ”
74315	74328	74330	74330	Ursula	255	“ Ca n’t we have a rowing boat , and get out ? ”
74340	74345	74347	74347	Gerald	255	“ To get out ? ”
74349	74353	74355	74355	Gudrun	160	“ You see , ”
74364	74379	74355	74355	Gudrun	160	“ we do n’t know the people , we are almost complete strangers here . ”
74380	74394	74395	74395	he	255	“ Oh , I can soon set you up with a few acquaintances , ”
74419	74422	74423	74423	she	160	“ Ah , ”
74426	74445	74446	74446	She	160	“ you know what we mean . Ca n’t we go up there , and explore that coast ? ”
74469	74507	74446	74446	She	160	“ That looks perfectly lovely . We might even bathe . Is n’t it beautiful in this light . Really , it ’s like one of the reaches of the Nile — as one imagines the Nile . ”
74519	74529	74530	74530	he	255	“ You ’re sure it ’s far enough off ? ”
74538	74560	74530	74530	he	255	“ Yes , you might go there , if we could get a boat . They seem to be all out . ”
74575	74582	74584	74584	Ursula	255	“ How lovely it would be ! ”
74587	74595	74596	74596	he	255	“ And do n’t you want tea ? ”
74599	74602	74604	74604	Gudrun	160	“ Oh , ”
74606	74618	74604	74604	Gudrun	160	“ we could just drink a cup , and be off . ”
74637	74646	74647	74647	he	255	“ Can you manage a boat pretty well ? ”
74650	74653	74655	74655	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
74659	74663	74655	74655	Gudrun	160	“ pretty well . ”
74664	74668	74670	74670	Ursula	255	“ Oh yes , ”
74672	74684	74670	74670	Ursula	255	“ We can both of us row like water - spiders . ”
74685	74721	74655	74655	Gudrun	160	“ You can ? There ’s a light little canoe of mine , that I did n’t take out for fear somebody should drown themselves . Do you think you ’d be safe in that ? ”
74722	74726	74728	74728	Gudrun	160	“ Oh perfectly , ”
74730	74735	74737	74737	Ursula	255	“ What an angel ! ”
74739	74759	74737	74737	Ursula	255	“ Do n’t , for my sake , have an accident — because I ’m responsible for the water . ”
74760	74763	74765	74765	Gudrun	160	“ Sure , ”
74767	74777	74779	74779	Ursula	255	“ Besides , we can both swim quite well , ”
74781	74813	74779	74779	Ursula	255	“ Well — then I ’ll get them to put you up a tea - basket , and you can picnic all to yourselves,—that ’s the idea , is n’t it ? ”
74814	74826	74828	74828	Gudrun	160	“ How fearfully good ! How frightfully nice if you could ! ”
74861	74866	74867	74867	he	1920	“ Where ’s Birkin ? ”
74874	74884	74867	74867	he	1920	“ He might help me to get it down . ”
74885	74897	74899	74899	Gudrun	160	“ But what about your hand ? Is n’t it hurt ? ”
74976	74994	74995	74995	he	1920	“ Oh I can manage with one hand . The canoe is as light as a feather , ”
74998	75003	74995	74995	he	1920	“ There ’s Rupert!—Rupert ! ”
75015	75023	75025	75025	Ursula	255	“ What have you done to it ? ”
75041	75046	75048	75048	Gerald	255	“ To my hand ? ”
75050	75058	75048	75048	Gerald	255	“ I trapped it in some machinery . ”
75059	75062	75064	75064	Ursula	255	“ Ugh ! ”
75066	75073	75064	75064	Ursula	255	“ And did it hurt much ? ”
75074	75077	75078	75078	he	1920	“ Yes , ”
75081	75099	75078	75078	he	1920	“ It did at the time . It ’s getting better now . It crushed the fingers . ”
75100	75103	75105	75105	Ursula	255	“ Oh , ”
75112	75125	75105	75105	Ursula	255	“ I hate people who hurt themselves . I can feel it . ”
75132	75138	75140	75140	Birkin	169	“ What do you want ? ”
75159	75171	75172	75172	Gerald	255	“ You ’re quite sure you ’ll be safe in it ? ”
75175	75179	75181	75181	Gudrun	160	“ Quite sure , ”
75183	75220	75181	75181	Gudrun	160	“ I would n’t be so mean as to take it , if there was the slightest doubt . But I ’ve had a canoe at Arundel , and I assure you I ’m perfectly safe . ”
75283	75287	75288	75288	she	160	“ Thanks awfully , ”
75304	75315	75316	75316	He	727	“ It ’s lovely — like sitting in a leaf . ”
75656	75665	75667	75667	Ursula	255	“ We will bathe just for a moment , ”
75669	75677	75667	75667	Ursula	255	“ and then we ’ll have tea . ”
75759	75768	75770	75770	Ursula	255	“ How lovely it is to be free , ”
75911	75918	75920	75920	Ursula	255	“ Are you happy , Prune ? ”
75929	75937	75939	75939	Gudrun	160	“ Ursula , I ’m perfectly happy , ”
75948	75952	75939	75939	Gudrun	160	“ So am I. ”
76040	76045	76023	76023	Ursula	255	“ Ännchen von Tharau . ”
76156	76170	76171	76171	she	160	“ Do you mind if I do Dalcroze to that tune , Hurtler ? ”
76184	76190	76192	76192	Ursula	255	“ What did you say ? ”
76200	76209	76211	76211	Gudrun	160	“ Will you sing while I do Dalcroze ? ”
76231	76237	76238	76238	she	160	“ While you do — ? ”
76242	76246	76248	76248	Gudrun	160	“ Dalcroze movements , ”
76263	76283	76285	76285	Ursula	255	“ Oh Dalcroze ! I could n’t catch the name . Do — I should love to see you , ”
76292	76298	76285	76285	Ursula	255	“ What shall I sing ? ”
76299	76314	76330	76330	she	160	“ Sing anything you like , and I ’ll take the rhythm from it . ”
76341	76352	76330	76330	she	160	“ My love — is a high - born lady — ”
76556	76578	76581	76581	Ursula	255	“ My love is a high - born lady — She is - s - s — rather dark than shady — ”
76675	76678	76667	76667	Gudrun	160	“ Ursula ! ”
76679	76682	76684	76684	Ursula	255	“ Yes ? ”
76712	76715	76717	76717	Ursula	255	“ Ugh ! ”
76727	76734	76737	76737	Gudrun	160	“ They ’re quite all right , ”
76800	76807	76809	76809	Ursula	255	“ Wo n’t they do anything ? ”
76846	76855	76857	76857	Gudrun	160	“ Do n’t they look charming , Ursula ? ”
76874	76877	76879	76879	Ursula	255	“ Charming , ”
76883	76893	76879	76879	Ursula	255	“ But wo n’t they do anything to us ? ”
76911	76919	76920	76920	she	160	“ I ’m sure they wo n’t , ”
76956	76963	76964	76964	she	160	“ Sit down and sing again , ”
76973	76978	76980	76980	Ursula	255	“ I ’m frightened , ”
77031	77037	77039	77039	Gudrun	160	“ They are quite safe , ”
77044	77055	77039	77039	Gudrun	160	“ Sing something , you ’ve only to sing something . ”
77084	77090	77073	77073	Ursula	255	“ Way down in Tennessee — ”
77388	77395	77378	77378	them	1981	“ Hue ! Hi - eee ! ”
77467	77476	77477	77477	he	255	“ What do you think you ’re doing ? ”
77489	77495	77498	77498	Gudrun	160	“ Why have you come ? ”
77505	77514	77515	77515	Gerald	255	“ What do you think you were doing ? ”
77520	77526	77528	77528	Ursula	255	“ We were doing eurythmics , ”
77580	77586	77587	77587	Gerald	255	“ Where are you going ? ”
77627	77635	77637	77637	Birkin	169	“ A poor song for a dance , ”
77720	77729	77730	77730	she	160	“ I think we ’ve all gone mad , ”
77737	77744	77745	77745	he	255	“ Pity we are n’t madder , ”
77791	77795	77796	77796	he	255	“ Offended — ? ”
77808	77817	77796	77796	he	255	“ I thought you liked the light fantastic . ”
77818	77823	77824	77824	she	160	“ Not like that , ”
77899	77905	77906	77906	he	255	“ Why not like that ? ”
77970	77976	77977	77977	she	160	“ No , do n’t ! ”
77983	77988	77989	77989	he	255	“ Cordelia after all , ”
78017	78021	78022	78022	she	160	“ And you , ”
78027	78043	78022	78022	she	160	“ why do you always take your soul in your mouth , so frightfully full ? ”
78044	78056	78062	78062	his	255	“ So that I can spit it out the more readily , ”
78251	78261	78263	78263	Gerald	255	“ Why do you want to drive them mad ? ”
78284	78293	78294	78294	he	255	“ It ’s not safe , you know , ”
78297	78307	78294	78294	he	255	“ They ’re nasty , when they do turn . ”
78308	78315	78316	78316	she	160	“ Turn where ? Turn away ? ”
78320	78323	78324	78324	he	255	“ No , ”
78327	78332	78324	78324	he	255	“ turn against you . ”
78333	78338	78339	78339	she	160	“ Turn against me ? ”
78349	78367	78368	78368	he	255	“ Anyway , they gored one of the farmer ’s cows to death , the other day , ”
78371	78377	78378	78378	she	160	“ What do I care ? ”
78381	78386	78387	78387	he	255	“ I cared though , ”
78390	78398	78387	78387	he	255	“ seeing that they ’re my cattle . ”
78399	78418	78419	78419	she	160	“ How are they yours ! You have n’t swallowed them . Give me one of them now , ”
78427	78434	78435	78435	he	255	“ You know where they are , ”
78443	78459	78435	78435	he	255	“ You can have one if you ’d like it sent to you later on . ”
78466	78482	78483	78483	she	160	“ You think I ’m afraid of you and your cattle , do n’t you ? ”
78501	78508	78509	78509	he	255	“ Why should I think that ? ”
78552	78557	78558	78558	she	160	“ That ’s why , ”
78678	78686	78687	78687	he	255	“ You have struck the first blow , ”
78722	78730	78731	78731	she	160	“ And I shall strike the last , ”
78776	78788	78790	78790	she	160	“ Why are you behaving in this impossible and ridiculous fashion . ”
78847	78861	78862	78862	she	160	“ It ’s you who make me behave like this , you know , ”
78868	78873	78874	78874	he	255	“ I ? How ? ”
79019	79027	79006	79006	she	160	“ Do n’t be angry with me . ”
79043	79058	79040	79040	he	255	“ I ’m not angry with you . I ’m in love with you . ”
79086	79095	79096	79096	she	160	“ That ’s one way of putting it , ”
79140	79151	79152	79152	he	255	“ It ’s all right , then , is it ? ”
79179	79187	79188	79188	she	160	“ Yes , it ’s all right , ”
79267	79275	79276	79276	he	255	“ Do you smell this little marsh ? ”
79296	79302	79303	79303	she	160	“ It ’s rather nice , ”
79306	79309	79310	79310	he	255	“ No , ”
79313	79316	79310	79310	he	255	“ alarming . ”
79317	79321	79322	79322	she	160	“ Why alarming ? ”
79325	79336	79337	79337	he	255	“ It seethes and seethes , a river of darkness , ”
79340	79373	79337	79337	he	255	“ putting forth lilies and snakes , and the ignis fatuus , and rolling all the time onward . That ’s what we never take into count — that it rolls onwards . ”
79374	79378	79310	79310	he	255	“ What does ? ”
79379	79435	79310	79310	he	255	“ The other river , the black river . We always consider the silver river of life , rolling on and quickening all the world to a brightness , on and on to heaven , flowing into a bright eternal sea , a heaven of angels thronging . But the other is our real reality — ”
79436	79448	79450	79450	Ursula	255	“ But what other ? I do n’t see any other , ”
79452	79460	79461	79461	he	255	“ It is your reality , nevertheless , ”
79464	79517	79461	79461	he	255	“ that dark river of dissolution . You see it rolls in us just as the other rolls — the black river of corruption . And our flowers are of this — our sea - born Aphrodite , all our white phosphorescent flowers of sensuous perfection , all our reality , nowadays . ”
79518	79527	79529	79529	Ursula	255	“ You mean that Aphrodite is really deathly ? ”
79531	79547	79548	79548	he	255	“ I mean she is the flowering mystery of the death - process , yes , ”
79551	79611	79548	79548	he	255	“ When the stream of synthetic creation lapses , we find ourselves part of the inverse process , the blood of destructive creation . Aphrodite is born in the first spasm of universal dissolution — then the snakes and swans and lotus — marsh - flowers — and Gudrun and Gerald — born in the process of destructive creation . ”
79612	79619	79620	79620	she	2005	“ And you and me — ? ”
79623	79626	79627	79627	he	255	“ Probably , ”
79630	79650	79627	79627	he	255	“ In part , certainly . Whether we are that , in toto , I do n’t yet know . ”
79651	79673	79674	79674	she	2005	“ You mean we are flowers of dissolution — fleurs du mal ? I do n’t feel as if I were , ”
79684	79696	79697	79697	he	255	“ I do n’t feel as if we were , altogether , ”
79700	79747	79697	79697	he	255	“ Some people are pure flowers of dark corruption — lilies . But there ought to be some roses , warm and flamy . You know Herakleitos says ‘ a dry soul is best . ’ I know so well what that means . Do you ? ”
79748	79754	79627	79627	he	255	“ I ’m not sure , ”
79758	79782	79755	79755	Ursula	255	“ But what if people are all flowers of dissolution — when they ’re flowers at all — what difference does it make ? ”
79783	79801	79802	79802	he	255	“ No difference — and all the difference . Dissolution rolls on , just as production does , ”
79805	79844	79802	79802	he	255	“ It is a progressive process — and it ends in universal nothing — the end of the world , if you like . But why is n’t the end of the world as good as the beginning ? ”
79845	79852	79854	79854	Ursula	255	“ I suppose it is n’t , ”
79859	79865	79866	79866	he	255	“ Oh yes , ultimately , ”
79869	79923	79866	79866	he	255	“ It means a new cycle of creation after — but not for us . If it is the end , then we are of the end — fleurs du mal if you like . If we are fleurs du mal , we are not roses of happiness , and there you are . ”
79924	79931	79933	79933	Ursula	255	“ But I think I am , ”
79935	79945	79933	79933	Ursula	255	“ I think I am a rose of happiness . ”
79946	79951	79952	79952	he	255	“ Ready - made ? ”
79956	79961	79962	79962	she	2006	“ No — real , ”
79967	79980	79981	79981	he	255	“ If we are the end , we are not the beginning , ”
79984	79989	79990	79990	she	2006	“ Yes we are , ”
79993	80002	79933	79933	Ursula	255	“ The beginning comes out of the end . ”
80003	80020	79933	79933	Ursula	255	“ After it , not out of it . After us , not out of us . ”
80021	80032	80033	80033	she	2006	“ You are a devil , you know , really , ”
80036	80051	80033	80033	she	2006	“ You want to destroy our hope . You want us to be deathly . ”
80052	80055	80056	80056	he	255	“ No , ”
80059	80070	80056	80056	he	255	“ I only want us to know what we are . ”
80071	80074	80075	80075	she	2006	“ Ha ! ”
80080	80089	80075	80075	she	2006	“ You only want us to know death . ”
80090	80096	80102	80102	Gerald	255	“ You ’re quite right , ”
80575	80581	80583	80583	his	2006	“ That is all right , ”
80612	80617	80618	80618	she	169	“ This is beautiful , ”
80621	80624	80618	80618	she	169	“ Lovely , ”
80643	80649	80650	80650	she	169	“ Light one for me , ”
80732	80745	80718	80718	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t it beautiful , oh , is n’t it beautiful ! ”
80882	80897	80899	80899	Birkin	169	“ You ’ve got the heavens above , and the waters under the earth , ”
80903	80910	80911	80911	she	169	“ Anything but the earth itself , ”
80926	80938	80940	80940	Gudrun	160	“ I ’m dying to see what my second one is , ”
81017	81022	81024	81024	Gudrun	160	“ How truly terrifying ! ”
81043	81051	81052	81052	she	169	“ But is n’t it really fearful ! ”
81064	81074	81058	81058	he	255	“ Change it with Ursula , for the crabs . ”
81082	81085	81086	81086	she	169	“ Ursula , ”
81089	81099	81086	81086	she	169	“ could you bear to have this fearful thing ? ”
81100	81108	81110	81110	Ursula	255	“ I think the colouring is lovely , ”
81112	81117	81119	81119	Gudrun	160	“ So do I , ”
81121	81144	81119	81119	Gudrun	160	“ But could you bear to have it swinging to your boat ? Do n’t you want to destroy it at once ? ”
81145	81149	81151	81151	Ursula	255	“ Oh no , ”
81153	81162	81151	81151	Ursula	255	“ I do n’t want to destroy it . ”
81163	81183	81184	81184	Gudrun	160	“ Well do you mind having it instead of the crabs ? Are you sure you do n’t mind ? ”
81191	81194	81196	81196	Ursula	255	“ No , ”
81235	81239	81241	81241	Birkin	169	“ Come then , ”
81243	81252	81253	81253	He	255	“ I ’ll put them on the boats . ”
81264	81275	81277	81277	Gerald	255	“ I suppose you ’ll row me back , Rupert , ”
81288	81299	81301	81301	Birkin	169	“ Wo n’t you go with Gudrun in the canoe ? ”
81303	81310	81301	81301	Birkin	169	“ It ’ll be more interesting . ”
81341	81347	81349	81349	Gudrun	160	“ Is that all right ? ”
81353	81361	81362	81362	he	255	“ It ’ll suit me very well , ”
81365	81385	81362	81362	he	255	“ But what about you , and the rowing ? I do n’t see why you should pull me . ”
81386	81390	81391	81391	she	160	“ Why not ? ”
81394	81407	81409	81409	her	160	“ I can pull you as well as I could pull Ursula . ”
81494	81501	81503	81503	his	255	“ Kiss me before we go , ”
81523	81527	81528	81528	she	160	“ But why ? ”
81535	81538	81539	81539	he	255	“ Why ? ”
81616	81630	81631	81631	she	160	“ Are you sure you do n’t hurt your hand , doing that ? ”
81636	81645	81631	81631	she	160	“ Because I could have done it perfectly . ”
81646	81653	81654	81654	he	255	“ I do n’t hurt myself , ”
81725	81733	81734	81734	she	160	“ You like this , do you ? ”
81748	81756	81757	81757	he	255	“ There is a space between us , ”
81803	81810	81811	81811	she	160	“ But I ’m very near , ”
81817	81823	81824	81824	he	255	“ Yet distant , distant , ”
81846	81862	81835	81835	she	160	“ Yet we can not very well change , whilst we are on the water . ”
82092	82098	82099	82099	she	160	“ Is n’t it beautiful ! ”
82275	82278	82279	82279	he	255	“ Yes , ”
82283	82289	82279	82279	he	255	“ It is very beautiful . ”
82440	82450	82452	82452	Gudrun	160	“ Shall I row to the landing - stage ? ”
82455	82458	82459	82459	he	255	“ Anywhere , ”
82462	82467	82459	82459	he	255	“ Let it drift . ”
82468	82480	82481	82481	she	160	“ Tell me then , if we are running into anything , ”
82495	82501	82502	82502	he	255	“ The lights will show , ”
82535	82541	82542	82542	she	160	“ Nobody will miss you ? ”
82550	82554	82555	82555	he	255	“ Miss me ? ”
82558	82563	82542	82542	she	160	“ No ! Why ? ”
82564	82575	82523	82523	she	160	“ I wondered if anybody would be looking for you . ”
82576	82584	82542	82542	she	160	“ Why should they look for me ? ”
82592	82601	82602	82602	he	255	“ But perhaps you want to get back , ”
82610	82621	82622	82622	she	160	“ No , I do n’t want to get back , ”
82625	82632	82602	82602	he	255	“ No , I assure you . ”
82633	82645	82664	82664	somebody	4745	“ You ’re quite sure it ’s all right for you ? ”
82646	82651	82664	82664	somebody	4745	“ Perfectly all right . ”
82715	82721	82722	82722	he	255	“ Somebody in the water , ”
82736	82742	82722	82722	he	255	“ Can you row up ? ”
82743	82750	82752	82752	Gudrun	160	“ Where , to the launch ? ”
82758	82761	82752	82752	Gudrun	160	“ Yes . ”
82762	82774	82775	82775	she	160	“ You ’ll tell me if I do n’t steer straight , ”
82782	82788	82789	82789	he	255	“ You keep pretty level , ”
82818	82826	82828	82828	Gudrun	160	“ Was n’t this bound to happen ? ”
82952	82956	82957	82957	she	160	“ Of course , ”
82962	82982	82957	82957	she	160	“ nobody will be drowned . Of course they wo n’t . It would be too extravagant and sensational . ”
83031	83049	83018	83019	a child	733	“ Di — Di — Di — Di — Oh Di — Oh Di — Oh Di ! ”
83059	83067	83069	83069	Gerald	255	“ It ’s Diana , is it , ”
83071	83088	83069	83069	Gerald	255	“ The young monkey , she ’d have to be up to some of her tricks . ”
83136	83166	83167	83167	Boats	2059	“ Where , where ? There you are — that ’s it . Which ? No — No - o - o. Damn it all , here , here — ”
83246	83258	83227	83228	the child	2063	“ Di — Oh Di — Oh Di — Di — ! ”
83274	83287	83291	83291	himself	255	“ You ’d be better if you were in bed , Winnie , ”
83320	83333	83335	83335	Gudrun	160	“ You ca n’t go into the water with your hurt hand , ”
83346	83354	83335	83335	Gudrun	160	“ What ? It wo n’t hurt . ”
83432	83454	83456	83457	the child	2063	“ Oh get her out ! Oh Di , darling ! Oh get her out ! Oh Daddy , Oh Daddy ! ”
83490	83497	83456	83457	the child	2063	“ Hi there — Rockley!—hi there ! ”
83498	83502	83504	83505	the captain	1907	“ Mr Gerald ! ”
83510	83518	83504	83505	the captain	1907	“ Miss Diana ’s in the water . ”
83519	83526	83528	83528	Gerald	255	“ Anybody gone in for her ? ”
83533	83540	83528	83528	Gerald	255	“ Young Doctor Brindell , sir . ”
83541	83544	83504	83505	the captain	1907	“ Where ? ”
83545	83567	83528	83528	Gerald	255	“ Ca n’t see no signs of them , sir . Everybody ’s looking , but there ’s nothing so far . ”
83576	83583	83504	83505	the captain	1907	“ Where did she go in ? ”
83584	83594	83504	83505	the captain	1907	“ I think — about where that boat is , ”
83600	83609	83504	83505	the captain	1907	“ that one with red and green lights . ”
83610	83614	83616	83616	Gerald	255	“ Row there , ”
83621	83633	83634	83635	the child	2063	“ Get her out , Gerald , oh get her out , ”
83647	83653	83655	83655	Gerald	255	“ Lean back that way , ”
83668	83674	83660	83660	he	255	“ She wo n’t upset . ”
83800	83811	83797	83797	Winifred	186	“ Oh do find her Gerald , do find her , ”
83873	83878	83870	83870	someone	2083	“ There he is . ”
84140	84151	84153	84153	his	255	“ Put the lights out , we shall see better , ”
84385	84405	84355	84355	she	160	“ Take the launch in . It ’s no use keeping her there . Get lines for the dragging , ”
84432	84437	84444	84444	Winifred	186	“ Gerald ! Gerald ! ”
84499	84502	84504	84504	Ursula	255	“ Gudrun ? ”
84508	84511	84504	84504	Ursula	255	“ Ursula ! ”
84521	84526	84528	84528	Gudrun	160	“ Where is Gerald ? ”
84530	84536	84538	84538	Ursula	255	“ He ’s dived again , ”
84541	84556	84538	84538	Ursula	255	“ And I know he ought not , with his hurt hand and everything . ”
84557	84567	84569	84569	Birkin	169	“ I ’ll take him in home this time , ”
84592	84597	84599	84599	Ursula	255	“ There he is ! ”
84645	84653	84655	84655	Ursula	255	“ Why do n’t you help him ? ”
84799	84805	84789	84789	Birkin	169	“ Where are you going ? ”
84816	84819	84821	84821	Birkin	169	“ Home , ”
84823	84827	84829	84829	Gerald	255	“ Oh no ! ”
84832	84856	84829	84829	Gerald	255	“ We ca n’t go home while they ’re in the water . Turn back again , I ’m going to find them . ”
84878	84881	84883	84883	Birkin	169	“ No ! ”
84885	84890	84883	84883	Birkin	169	“ You ca n’t . ”
84933	84939	84941	84941	Gerald	255	“ Why should you interfere ? ”
85015	85018	85019	85019	he	255	“ Father ! ”
85022	85035	85019	85019	he	255	“ Yes my boy ? Go home and get those things off . ”
85036	85045	85047	85047	Gerald	255	“ We sha n’t save them , father , ”
85049	85058	85047	85047	Gerald	255	“ There ’s hope yet , my boy . ”
85059	85090	85019	85019	he	255	“ I ’m afraid not . There ’s no knowing where they are . You ca n’t find them . And there ’s a current , as cold as hell . ”
85091	85099	85101	85102	the father	646	“ We ’ll let the water out , ”
85104	85122	85123	85123	he	646	“ Go home you and look to yourself . See that he ’s looked after , Rupert , ”
85130	85186	85123	85123	he	646	“ Well father , I ’m sorry . I ’m sorry . I ’m afraid it ’s my fault . But it ca n’t be helped ; I ’ve done what I could for the moment . I could go on diving , of course — not much , though — and not much use — ”
85206	85217	85219	85219	Birkin	169	“ Of course , you ’ve got no shoes on , ”
85221	85227	85229	85229	Gudrun	160	“ His shoes are here ! ”
85262	85268	85269	85269	he	646	“ If you once die , ”
85272	85299	85269	85269	he	646	“ then when it ’s over , it ’s finished . Why come to life again ? There ’s room under that water there for thousands . ”
85300	85305	85306	85306	she	160	“ Two is enough , ”
85330	85335	85336	85336	he	646	“ That ’s true , ”
85339	85376	85336	85336	he	646	“ maybe . But it ’s curious how much room there seems , a whole universe under there ; and as cold as hell , you ’re as helpless as if your head was cut off . ”
85387	85399	85400	85400	he	646	“ There ’s one thing about our family , you know , ”
85403	85443	85400	85400	he	646	“ Once anything goes wrong , it can never be put right again — not with us . I ’ve noticed it all my life — you ca n’t put a thing right , once it has gone wrong . ”
85456	85535	85444	85444	They	2121	“ And do you know , when you are down there , it is so cold , actually , and so endless , so different really from what it is on top , so endless — you wonder how it is so many are alive , why we ’re up here . Are you going ? I shall see you again , sha n’t I ? Good - night , and thank you . Thank you very much ! ”
85640	85645	85646	85646	he	2126	“ Come with me , ”
85651	85667	85646	85646	he	2126	“ and then I will walk home with you , when I ’ve done this . ”
85972	85979	85980	85980	she	2140	“ Ca n’t we go now ? ”
86083	86091	86092	86092	she	2140	“ Do you think they are dead ? ”
86104	86107	86108	86108	he	2126	“ Yes , ”
86111	86117	86108	86108	he	2126	“ Is n’t it horrible ! ”
86137	86144	86145	86145	she	2140	“ Do you mind very much ? ”
86149	86158	86159	86159	he	2126	“ I do n’t mind about the dead , ”
86162	86187	86159	86159	he	2126	“ once they are dead . The worst of it is , they cling on to the living , and wo n’t let go . ”
86194	86197	86198	86198	she	2140	“ Yes , ”
86201	86217	86198	86198	she	2140	“ The fact of death does n’t really seem to matter much , does it ? ”
86218	86221	86222	86222	he	2126	“ No , ”
86225	86238	86222	86222	he	2126	“ What does it matter if Diana Crich is alive or dead ? ”
86239	86244	86245	86245	she	2140	“ Does n’t it ? ”
86250	86285	86245	86245	she	2140	“ No , why should it ? Better she were dead — she’ll be much more real . She ’ll be positive in death . In life she was a fretting , negated thing . ”
86286	86292	86294	86294	Ursula	255	“ You are rather horrible , ”
86296	86342	86294	86294	Ursula	255	“ No ! I ’d rather Diana Crich were dead . Her living somehow , was all wrong . As for the young man , poor devil — he’ll find his way out quickly instead of slowly . Death is all right — nothing better . ”
86343	86352	86353	86353	she	2140	“ Yet you do n’t want to die , ”
86380	86401	86365	86365	he	2126	“ I should like to be through with it — I should like to be through with the death process . ”
86402	86408	86410	86410	Ursula	255	“ And are n’t you ? ”
86436	86503	86427	86427	he	2126	“ There is life which belongs to death , and there is life which is n’t death . One is tired of the life that belongs to death — our kind of life . But whether it is finished , God knows . I want love that is like sleep , like being born again , vulnerable as a baby that just comes into the world . ”
86567	86575	86576	86576	she	2140	“ Why should love be like sleep ? ”
86580	86646	86576	86576	she	2140	“ I do n’t know . So that it is like death — I do want to die from this life — and yet it is more than life itself . One is delivered over like a naked infant from the womb , all the old defences and the old body gone , and new air around one , that has never been breathed before . ”
86713	86716	86717	86717	she	2140	“ But , ”
86721	86738	86717	86717	she	2140	“ did n’t you say you wanted something that was not love — something beyond love ? ”
86836	86843	86844	86844	he	2126	“ I do n’t want love , ”
86847	86919	86844	86844	he	2126	“ I do n’t want to know you . I want to be gone out of myself , and you to be lost to yourself , so we are found different . One should n’t talk when one is tired and wretched . One Hamletises , and it seems a lie . Only believe me when I show you a bit of healthy pride and insouciance . I hate myself serious . ”
86920	86928	86929	86929	she	2159	“ Why should n’t you be serious ? ”
86944	86950	86939	86939	he	2126	“ I do n’t know . ”
86967	86973	86974	86974	she	2159	“ Is n’t it strange , ”
86990	87010	86974	86974	she	2159	“ how we always talk like this ! I suppose we do love each other , in some way . ”
87011	87015	87016	87016	he	2126	“ Oh yes , ”
87019	87023	87016	87016	he	2126	“ too much . ”
87029	87044	87045	87045	she	2159	“ You ’d have to have it your own way , would n’t you ? ”
87048	87057	87045	87045	she	2159	“ You could never take it on trust . ”
87080	87083	87084	87084	he	2126	“ Yes , ”
87167	87173	87174	87174	she	2159	“ Is n’t somebody coming ? ”
87242	87249	87250	87250	he	2126	“ Not this , not this , ”
87429	87445	87446	87446	he	2126	“ I was becoming quite dead - alive , nothing but a word - bag , ”
87587	87594	87595	87595	he	255	“ You still here , Rupert ? ”
87598	87661	87595	87595	he	255	“ We ca n’t get them . The bottom slopes , you know , very steep . The water lies between two very sharp slopes , with little branch valleys , and God knows where the drift will take you . It is n’t as if it was a level bottom . You never know where you are , with the dragging . ”
87662	87673	87675	87675	Birkin	169	“ Is there any need for you to be working ? ”
87677	87690	87675	87675	Birkin	169	“ Would n’t it be much better if you went to bed ? ”
87691	87717	87744	87744	he	255	“ To bed ! Good God , do you think I should sleep ? We ’ll find ’em , before I go away from here . ”
87718	87736	87737	87737	Gerald	255	“ But the men would find them just the same without you — why should you insist ? ”
87756	87789	87744	87744	he	255	“ Do n’t you bother about me , Rupert . If there ’s anybody ’s health to think about , it ’s yours , not mine . How do you feel yourself ? ”
87790	87811	87744	87744	he	255	“ Very well . But you , you spoil your own chance of life — you waste your best self . ”
87823	87836	87820	87820	he	255	“ Waste it ? What else is there to do with it ? ”
87837	87869	87884	87884	he	255	“ But leave this , wo n’t you ? You force yourself into horrors , and put a mill - stone of beastly memories round your neck . Come away now . ”
87870	87879	87880	87880	Gerald	255	“ A mill - stone of beastly memories ! ”
87895	87914	87884	87884	he	255	“ God , you ’ve got such a telling way of putting things , Rupert , you have . ”
87934	87945	87920	87920	He	2178	“ Wo n’t you leave it ? Come over to my place”—he
87954	87957	87959	87959	Gerald	255	“ No , ”
87971	88057	87959	87959	Gerald	255	“ Thanks very much , Rupert — I shall be glad to come tomorrow , if that ’ll do . You understand , do n’t you ? I want to see this job through . But I ’ll come tomorrow , right enough . Oh , I ’d rather come and have a chat with you than — than do anything else , I verily believe . Yes , I would . You mean a lot to me , Rupert , more than you know . ”
88058	88069	88071	88071	Birkin	169	“ What do I mean , more than I know ? ”
88107	88115	88117	88117	Gerald	255	“ I ’ll tell you another time , ”
88120	88133	88135	88135	Birkin	169	“ Come along with me now — I want you to come , ”
88173	88206	88170	88170	he	255	“ No , I ’ll see this job through , Rupert . Thank you — I know what you mean . We ’re all right , you know , you and me . ”
88207	88226	88228	88228	Birkin	169	“ I may be all right , but I ’m sure you ’re not , mucking about here , ”
88263	88268	88270	88270	Gerald	255	“ She killed him , ”
88848	88853	88854	88854	she	160	“ Unless something happens , ”
88867	88883	88854	88854	she	160	“ I shall die . I am at the end of my line of life . ”
89322	89332	89334	89334	Ursula	255	“ I shall die — I shall quickly die , ”
89439	89445	89446	89446	she	2228	“ Then let it end , ”
89638	89649	89650	89650	she	2228	“ Does the body correspond so immediately with the spirit ? ”
90566	90573	90555	90556	the children	4705	“ Ursula , there ’s somebody . ”
90574	90583	90584	90584	she	2265	“ I know . Do n’t be silly , ”
90641	90647	90648	90648	she	2265	“ Oh is it you ? ”
90651	90660	90661	90661	he	2269	“ I am glad you are at home , ”
90672	90680	90681	90681	He	2269	“ They are all gone to church . ”
90701	90712	90714	90714	Ursula	255	“ Go and get undressed now , Billy and Dora , ”
90716	90735	90736	90737	The children	4705	“ Mother will be back soon , and she ’ll be disappointed if you ’re not in bed . ”
90805	90814	90815	90815	he	2269	“ What have you been doing all day ? ”
90819	90824	90825	90825	she	2274	“ Only sitting about , ”
90931	90936	90914	90916	the two children	2276	“ Ursula ! Ursula ! ”
90982	90990	90992	90992	Billy	289	“ Shall you take us to bed ! ”
90999	91006	91007	91007	she	2274	“ Why you are angels tonight , ”
91011	91025	91007	91007	she	2274	“ Wo n’t you come and say good - night to Mr Birkin ? ”
91084	91094	91096	91096	Birkin	169	“ Will you say good - night to me ? ”
91215	91223	91224	91224	Ursula	255	“ Are you going to be kissed ? ”
91248	91268	91270	91270	Ursula	255	“ Wo n’t you say good - night to Mr Birkin ? Go , he ’s waiting for you , ”
91286	91293	91295	91295	Ursula	255	“ Silly Dora , silly Dora ! ”
91314	91318	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Come then , ”
91322	91330	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Let us go before mother comes . ”
91331	91340	91342	91342	Billy	289	“ Who ’ll hear us say our prayers ? ”
91345	91350	91342	91342	Billy	289	“ Whom you like . ”
91351	91356	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Wo n’t you ? ”
91357	91363	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Yes , I will . ”
91364	91367	91342	91342	Billy	289	“ Ursula ? ”
91368	91372	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Well Billy ? ”
91373	91380	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Is it whom you like ? ”
91381	91386	91342	91342	Billy	289	“ That ’s it . ”
91387	91393	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ Well what is whom ? ”
91394	91402	91320	91320	Ursula	255	“ It ’s the accusative of who . ”
91415	91419	91420	91420	Birkin	169	“ Is it ? ”
91493	91500	91501	91501	she	2292	“ Do n’t you feel well ? ”
91508	91516	91501	91501	she	2292	“ I had n’t thought about it . ”
91517	91528	91529	91529	He	289	“ But do n’t you know without thinking about it ? ”
91553	91570	91571	91571	she	2292	“ Do n’t you know whether you are unwell or not , without thinking about it ? ”
91574	91578	91579	91579	he	289	“ Not always , ”
91583	91594	91579	91579	he	289	“ But do n’t you think that ’s very wicked ? ”
91595	91598	91628	91628	He	289	“ Wicked ? ”
91599	91627	91628	91628	He	289	“ Yes . I think it ’s criminal to have so little connection with your own body that you do n’t even know when you are ill . ”
91634	91637	91638	91638	he	289	“ Yes , ”
91641	91659	91628	91628	He	289	“ Why do n’t you stay in bed when you are seedy ? You look perfectly ghastly . ”
91660	91664	91665	91665	he	289	“ Offensively so ? ”
91669	91678	91665	91665	he	289	“ Yes , quite offensive . Quite repelling . ”
91679	91688	91628	91628	He	289	“ Ah ! ! Well that ’s unfortunate . ”
91689	91734	91628	91628	He	289	“ And it ’s raining , and it ’s a horrible night . Really , you should n’t be forgiven for treating your body like it — you ought to suffer , a man who takes as little notice of his body as that . ”
91735	91747	91748	91748	he	289	“ — takes as little notice of his body as that , ”
91792	91797	91799	91799	Brangwen	160	“ Good - evening , ”
91804	91813	91799	91799	Brangwen	160	“ Came to see me , did you ? ”
91814	91817	91819	91819	Birkin	169	“ No , ”
91821	91849	91819	91819	Birkin	169	“ not about anything , in particular , that is . The day was dismal , and I thought you would n’t mind if I called in . ”
91850	91858	91860	91861	Mrs Brangwen	273	“ It has been a depressing day , ”
91878	91883	91884	91884	She	160	“ Mother ! Mother ! ”
91895	91908	91886	91886	her	160	“ I shall come up to you in a minute , Doysie . ”
91913	91926	91927	91927	she	160	“ There is nothing fresh at Shortlands , I suppose ? Ah , ”
91930	91941	91927	91927	she	160	“ no , poor things , I should think not . ”
91942	91953	91955	91956	the father	646	“ You ’ve been over there today , I suppose ? ”
91958	91984	91927	91927	she	160	“ Gerald came round to tea with me , and I walked back with him . The house is overexcited and unwholesome , I thought . ”
91985	91998	92000	92000	Gudrun	160	“ I should think they were people who had n’t much restraint , ”
92002	92007	92008	92008	Birkin	169	“ Or too much , ”
92011	92019	92021	92021	Gudrun	160	“ Oh yes , I ’m sure , ”
92026	92032	92021	92021	Gudrun	160	“ one or the other . ”
92033	92046	92048	92048	Birkin	169	“ They all feel they ought to behave in some unnatural fashion , ”
92050	92076	92048	92048	Birkin	169	“ When people are in grief , they would do better to cover their faces and keep in retirement , as in the old days . ”
92077	92080	92082	92082	Gudrun	160	“ Certainly ! ”
92088	92118	92082	92082	Gudrun	160	“ What can be worse than this public grief — what is more horrible , more false ! If grief is not private , and hidden , what is ? ”
92119	92122	92123	92123	he	646	“ Exactly , ”
92126	92155	92123	92123	he	646	“ I felt ashamed when I was there and they were all going about in a lugubrious false way , feeling they must not be natural or ordinary . ”
92156	92159	92161	92162	Mrs Brangwen	273	“ Well — ”
92169	92182	92161	92162	Mrs Brangwen	273	“ it is n’t so easy to bear a trouble like that . ”
94129	94137	94138	94138	he	255	“ Why are you laid up again ? ”
94166	94174	94175	94175	Birkin	169	“ For my sins , I suppose , ”
94183	94206	94175	94175	Birkin	169	“ For your sins ? Yes , probably that is so . You should sin less , and keep better in health ? ”
94207	94214	94215	94215	He	2384	“ You ’d better teach me . ”
94223	94230	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ How are things with you ? ”
94234	94238	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ With me ? ”
94258	94284	94245	94245	he	2384	“ I do n’t know that they ’re any different . I do n’t see how they could be . There ’s nothing to change . ”
94285	94306	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ I suppose you are conducting the business as successfully as ever , and ignoring the demand of the soul . ”
94307	94312	94314	94314	Gerald	255	“ That ’s it , ”
94316	94338	94314	94314	Gerald	255	“ At least as far as the business is concerned . I could n’t say about the soul , I’am sure . ”
94339	94342	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ No . ”
94343	94352	94354	94354	Gerald	255	“ Surely you do n’t expect me to ? ”
94356	94373	94354	94354	Gerald	255	“ No . How are the rest of your affairs progressing , apart from the business ? ”
94374	94399	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ The rest of my affairs ? What are those ? I could n’t say ; I do n’t know what you refer to . ”
94400	94406	94408	94408	Birkin	169	“ Yes , you do , ”
94410	94423	94408	94408	Birkin	169	“ Are you gloomy or cheerful ? And what about Gudrun Brangwen ? ”
94424	94429	94435	94435	Gerald	255	“ What about her ? ”
94437	94440	94441	94441	he	255	“ Well , ”
94444	94469	94441	94441	he	255	“ I do n’t know . I can only tell you she gave me a hit over the face last time I saw her . ”
94470	94480	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ A hit over the face ! What for ? ”
94481	94491	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ That I could n’t tell you , either . ”
94492	94498	94441	94441	he	255	“ Really ! But when ? ”
94499	94529	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ The night of the party — when Diana was drowned . She was driving the cattle up the hill , and I went after her — you remember . ”
94530	94555	94232	94232	Birkin	169	“ Yes , I remember . But what made her do that ? You did n’t definitely ask her for it , I suppose ? ”
94556	94635	94636	94636	Birkin	169	“ I ? No , not that I know of . I merely said to her , that it was dangerous to drive those Highland bullocks — as it is . She turned in such a way , and said—‘I suppose you think I ’m afraid of you and your cattle , do n’t you ? ’ So I asked her ‘ why , ’ and for answer she flung me a back - hander across the face . ”
94662	94685	94646	94646	Gerald	255	“ I did n’t laugh at the time , I assure you . I was never so taken aback in my life . ”
94686	94693	94636	94636	Birkin	169	“ And were n’t you furious ? ”
94694	94712	94636	94636	Birkin	169	“ Furious ? I should think I was . I ’d have murdered her for two pins . ”
94713	94716	94718	94718	Birkin	169	“ H’m ! ”
94720	94735	94736	94736	He	2385	“ Poor Gudrun , would n’t she suffer afterwards for having given herself away ! ”
94741	94746	94748	94748	Gerald	255	“ Would she suffer ? ”
94762	94777	94754	94755	Both men	1407	“ Badly , I should think ; seeing how self - conscious she is . ”
94778	94810	94736	94736	He	2385	“ She is self - conscious , is she ? Then what made her do it ? For I certainly think it was quite uncalled - for , and quite unjustified . ”
94811	94820	94754	94755	Both men	1407	“ I suppose it was a sudden impulse . ”
94821	94843	94844	94844	Birkin	169	“ Yes , but how do you account for her having such an impulse ? I ’d done her no harm . ”
94849	94861	94862	94862	he	2385	“ The Amazon suddenly came up in her , I suppose , ”
94865	94868	94870	94870	Gerald	255	“ Well , ”
94872	94882	94870	94870	Gerald	255	“ I ’d rather it had been the Orinoco . ”
94917	94923	94924	94924	Birkin	169	“ And you resent it ? ”
94927	94945	94946	94946	He	255	“ I do n’t resent it . I do n’t care a tinker ’s curse about it . ”
94958	94976	94953	94953	he	255	“ No , I ’ll see it through , that ’s all . She seemed sorry afterwards . ”
94977	94989	94990	94990	Gerald	255	“ Did she ? You ’ve not met since that night ? ”
94995	94998	94999	94999	he	255	“ No , ”
95002	95019	94999	94999	he	255	“ We ’ve been — you can imagine how it ’s been , since the accident . ”
95020	95028	94953	94953	he	255	“ Yes . Is it calming down ? ”
95029	95105	94953	94953	he	255	“ I do n’t know . It ’s a shock , of course . But I do n’t believe mother minds . I really do n’t believe she takes any notice . And what ’s so funny , she used to be all for the children — nothing mattered , nothing whatever mattered but the children . And now , she does n’t take any more notice than if it was one of the servants . ”
95106	95116	94999	94999	he	255	“ No ? Did it upset you very much ? ”
95117	95190	94953	94953	he	255	“ It ’s a shock . But I do n’t feel it very much , really . I do n’t feel any different . We ’ve all got to die , and it does n’t seem to make any great difference , anyhow , whether you die or not . I ca n’t feel any grief , you know . It leaves me cold . I ca n’t quite account for it . ”
95191	95202	95204	95204	Birkin	169	“ You do n’t care if you die or not ? ”
95246	95249	95250	95250	he	255	“ Oh , ”
95253	95294	95250	95250	he	255	“ I do n’t want to die , why should I ? But I never trouble . The question does n’t seem to be on the carpet for me at all . It does n’t interest me , you know . ”
95295	95301	95303	95303	Birkin	169	“ Timor mortis conturbat me , ”
95305	95331	95303	95303	Birkin	169	adding—“No , death does n’t really seem the point any more . It curiously does n’t concern one . It ’s like an ordinary tomorrow . ”
95392	95400	95401	95401	he	255	“ If death is n’t the point , ”
95412	95415	95401	95401	he	255	voice—“what is ? ”
95426	95430	95401	95401	he	255	“ What is ? ”
95443	95462	95464	95464	Birkin	169	“ There ’s long way to go , after the point of intrinsic death , before we disappear , ”
95466	95470	95472	95472	Gerald	255	“ There is , ”
95474	95481	95482	95482	He	255	“ But what sort of way ? ”
95501	95542	95482	95482	He	255	“ Right down the slopes of degeneration — mystic , universal degeneration . There are many stages of pure degradation to go through : agelong . We live on long after our death , and progressively , in progressive devolution . ”
95648	95652	95653	95653	he	255	“ Of course , ”
95663	95766	95653	95653	he	255	“ it is father who really feels it . It will finish him . For him the world collapses . All his care now is for Winnie — he must save Winnie . He says she ought to be sent away to school , but she wo n’t hear of it , and he ’ll never do it . Of course she is in rather a queer way . We ’re all of us curiously bad at living . We can do things — but we ca n’t get on with life at all . It ’s curious — a family failing . ”
95767	95778	95780	95780	Birkin	169	“ She ought n’t to be sent away to school , ”
95789	95796	95780	95780	Birkin	169	“ She ought n’t . Why ? ”
95797	95844	95653	95653	he	255	“ She ’s a queer child — a special child , more special even than you . And in my opinion special children should never be sent away to school . Only moderately ordinary children should be sent to school — so it seems to me . ”
95845	95874	95653	95653	he	255	“ I ’m inclined to think just the opposite . I think it would probably make her more normal if she went away and mixed with other children . ”
95875	95930	95780	95780	Birkin	169	“ She would n’t mix , you see . You never really mixed , did you ? And she would n’t be willing even to pretend to . She ’s proud , and solitary , and naturally apart . If she has a single nature , why do you want to make her gregarious ? ”
95931	95953	95653	95653	he	255	“ No , I do n’t want to make her anything . But I think school would be good for her . ”
95954	95961	95962	95962	Gerald	255	“ Was it good for you ? ”
95999	96015	96016	96016	he	255	“ I hated it at the time , but I can see it was necessary , ”
96019	96041	96016	96016	he	255	“ It brought me into line a bit — and you ca n’t live unless you do come into line somewhere . ”
96042	96045	96047	96047	Birkin	169	“ Well , ”
96049	96106	96047	96047	Birkin	169	“ I begin to think that you ca n’t live unless you keep entirely out of the line . It ’s no good trying to toe the line , when your one impulse is to smash up the line . Winnie is a special nature , and for special natures you must give a special world . ”
96107	96117	96119	96119	Gerald	255	“ Yes , but where ’s your special world ? ”
96121	96220	96119	96119	Gerald	255	“ Make it . Instead of chopping yourself down to fit the world , chop the world down to fit yourself . As a matter of fact , two exceptional people make another world . You and I , we make another , separate world . You do n’t want a world same as your brothers - in - law . It ’s just the special quality you value . Do you want to be normal or ordinary ! It ’s a lie . You want to be free and extraordinary , in an extraordinary world of liberty . ”
96289	96303	96305	96305	Birkin	169	“ Yet you are so banal as to consider me chiefly a freak , ”
96308	96312	96314	96314	Gerald	255	“ A freak ! ”
96341	96351	96353	96353	he	255	“ No — I never consider you a freak . ”
96368	96372	96373	96373	Gerald	255	“ I feel , ”
96376	96418	96419	96419	He	255	“ that there is always an element of uncertainty about you — perhaps you are uncertain about yourself . But I ’m never sure of you . You can go away and change as easily as if you had no soul . ”
96655	96669	96670	96670	he	255	“ You know how the old German knights used to swear a Blutbruderschaft , ”
96685	96704	96706	96706	Gerald	255	“ Make a little wound in their arms , and rub each other ’s blood into the cut ? ”
96708	96773	96774	96774	He	255	“ Yes — and swear to be true to each other , of one blood , all their lives . That is what we ought to do . No wounds , that is obsolete . But we ought to swear to love each other , you and I , implicitly , and perfectly , finally , without any possibility of going back on it . ”
96814	96828	96830	96830	Birkin	169	“ We will swear to each other , one day , shall we ? ”
96832	96865	96830	96830	Birkin	169	“ We will swear to stand by each other — be true to each other — ultimately — infallibly — given to each other , organically — without possibility of taking back . ”
96902	96913	96915	96915	Birkin	169	“ Shall we swear to each other , one day ? ”
96940	96951	96952	96952	he	255	“ We ’ll leave it till I understand it better , ”
96980	96983	96984	96984	he	2405	“ Yes , ”
96987	97016	96984	96984	he	2405	“ You must tell me what you think , later . You know what I mean ? Not sloppy emotionalism . An impersonal union that leaves one free . ”
97196	97208	97180	97180	Birkin	169	“ Ca n’t you get a good governess for Winifred?—somebody exceptional ? ”
97209	97246	97247	97247	Gerald	255	“ Hermione Roddice suggested we should ask Gudrun to teach her to draw and to model in clay . You know Winnie is astonishingly clever with that plasticine stuff . Hermione declares she is an artist . ”
97273	97325	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ Really ! I did n’t know that . Oh well then , if Gudrun would teach her , it would be perfect — couldn’t be anything better — if Winifred is an artist . Because Gudrun somewhere is one . And every true artist is the salvation of every other . ”
97326	97339	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ I thought they got on so badly , as a rule . ”
97340	97371	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ Perhaps . But only artists produce for each other the world that is fit to live in . If you can arrange that for Winifred , it is perfect . ”
97372	97381	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ But you think she would n’t come ? ”
97382	97555	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ I do n’t know . Gudrun is rather self - opinionated . She wo n’t go cheap anywhere . Or if she does , she ’ll pretty soon take herself back . So whether she would condescend to do private teaching , particularly here , in Beldover , I do n’t know . But it would be just the thing . Winifred has got a special nature . And if you can put into her way the means of being self - sufficient , that is the best thing possible . She ’ll never get on with the ordinary life . You find it difficult enough yourself , and she is several skins thinner than you are . It is awful to think what her life will be like unless she does find a means of expression , some way of fulfilment . You can see what mere leaving it to fate brings . You can see how much marriage is to be trusted to — look at your own mother . ”
97556	97564	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ Do you think mother is abnormal ? ”
97565	97596	97265	97265	Birkin	169	“ No ! I think she only wanted something more , or other than the common run of life . And not getting it , she has gone wrong perhaps . ”
97597	97606	97608	97608	Gerald	255	“ After producing a brood of wrong children , ”
97611	97623	97624	97624	Birkin	169	“ No more wrong than any of the rest of us , ”
97627	97644	97624	97624	Birkin	169	“ The most normal people have the worst subterranean selves , take them one by one . ”
97645	97657	97659	97659	Gerald	255	“ Sometimes I think it is a curse to be alive , ”
97665	97668	97670	97670	Birkin	169	“ Well , ”
97672	97706	97670	97670	Birkin	169	“ why not ! Let it be a curse sometimes to be alive — at other times it is anything but a curse . You ’ve got plenty of zest in it really . ”
97707	97714	97716	97716	Gerald	255	“ Less than you ’d think , ”
97740	97763	97765	97765	Gerald	255	“ I do n’t see what she has to distinguish between teaching at the Grammar School , and coming to teach Win , ”
97767	97812	97765	97765	Gerald	255	“ The difference between a public servant and a private one . The only nobleman today , king and only aristocrat , is the public , the public . You are quite willing to serve the public — but to be a private tutor — ”
97813	97822	97843	97843	he	255	“ I do n’t want to serve either — ”
97823	97834	97835	97835	Gerald	255	“ No ! And Gudrun will probably feel the same . ”
97846	97870	97843	97843	he	255	“ At all events , father wo n’t make her feel like a private servant . He will be fussy and greatful enough . ”
97871	97908	97843	97843	he	255	“ So he ought . And so ought all of you . Do you think you can hire a woman like Gudrun Brangwen with money ? She is your equal like anything — probably your superior . ”
97909	97913	97915	97915	Gerald	255	“ Is she ? ”
97917	97942	97915	97915	Gerald	255	“ Yes , and if you have n’t the guts to know it , I hope she ’ll leave you to your own devices . ”
97943	97946	97948	97948	Gerald	255	“ Nevertheless , ”
97950	97978	97948	97948	Gerald	255	“ if she is my equal , I wish she were n’t a teacher , because I do n’t think teachers as a rule are my equal . ”
97979	98003	98004	98004	Gerald	255	“ Nor do I , damn them . But am I a teacher because I teach , or a parson because I preach ? ”
98096	98107	98108	98108	he	255	“ I ’ve been neglecting my business all this while , ”
98112	98121	98122	98122	Birkin	169	“ I ought to have reminded you before , ”
98129	98139	98141	98141	Gerald	255	“ I knew you ’d say something like that , ”
98146	98150	98141	98141	Gerald	255	“ Did you ? ”
98151	98190	98122	98122	Birkin	169	“ Yes , Rupert . It would n’t do for us all to be like you are — we should soon be in the cart . When I am above the world , I shall ignore all businesses . ”
98191	98203	98205	98205	Birkin	169	“ Of course , we ’re not in the cart now , ”
98209	98230	98205	98205	Birkin	169	“ Not as much as you make out . At any rate , we have enough to eat and drink — ”
98231	98236	98238	98238	Birkin	169	“ And be satisfied , ”
98315	98318	98320	98320	Birkin	169	“ So , ”
98322	98327	98320	98320	Birkin	169	“ Good - bye . ”
98347	98352	98354	98354	Gerald	255	“ Good - bye , ”
98368	98382	98354	98354	Gerald	255	“ I shall come again . I miss you down at the mill . ”
98383	98393	98395	98395	Birkin	169	“ I ’ll be there in a few days , ”
98461	98476	98428	98428	Birkin	169	“ Good - bye then . There ’s nothing I can do for you ? ”
98477	98482	98483	98483	Birkin	169	“ Nothing , thanks . ”
98822	98946	98817	98817	she	160	“ go ’ if she went to London . But she knew London , she wanted something else . She had seventy pounds , of which nobody knew anything . She would move soon , as soon as she heard from her friends . Her nature , in spite of her apparent placidity and calm , was profoundly restless . The sisters happened to call in a cottage in Willey Green to buy honey . Mrs Kirk , a stout , pale , sharp - nosed woman , sly , honied , with something shrewish and cat - like beneath , asked the girls into her too cosy , too tidy kitchen . There was a cat - like comfort and cleanliness everywhere . “
98952	98964	98949	98950	Miss Brangwen	195	” she said , in her slightly whining , insinuating voice , “
98979	98991	98968	98968	you	195	” Gudrun , whom she addressed , hated her at once . “
98999	99004	99005	99005	You	0	” she replied abruptly . “
99063	99064	99048	99048	you	0	” “
99072	99080	99067	99067	I	0	” Gudrun looked round at her slowly . “
99094	99095	99082	99082	you	0	” “
99105	99106	99107	99107	I	0	” “
99116	99133	99107	99107	I	0	” Gudrun was very cold and repelling . She knew the common people hated the school . “
99205	99206	99200	99200	He	2435	” “
99211	99215	99208	99208	he	2435	” asked Ursula . “
99245	99246	99248	99248	he	2435	” “
99250	99257	99258	99258	He	2435	” asked Gudrun , faintly ironic . “
99289	99290	99293	99293	they	5559	” “
99299	99303	99293	99293	they	5559	” said Ursula . “
99308	99317	99293	99293	they	5559	” Mrs Krik lowered her voice a little . “
99356	99366	99338	99338	She	1821	” The woman made a dry , sly face . “
99377	99378	99368	99368	you	2439	” “
99424	99438	99446	99449	That wilful , masterful	2448	” A curious malicious , sly tone came into the woman ’s voice . “
99441	99445	99446	99449	That wilful , masterful	2448	” said Gudrun . “
99690	99691	99682	99682	They	2457	” “
99694	99698	99682	99682	They	2457	” said Gudrun . “
99912	99924	99925	99925	I	0	” Gudrun went away in fury and loathing . The phrase , “
99933	100581	99925	99925	I	0	” sent her into a white , stony fury . She could not bear it , she wanted to have the woman taken out at once and strangled . And yet there the phrase was lodged in her mind for ever , beyond escape . She felt , one day , she would have to tell him , to see how he took it . And she loathed herself for the thought . But at Shortlands the life - long struggle was coming to a close . The father was ill and was going to die . He had bad internal pains , which took away all his attentive life , and left him with only a vestige of his consciousness . More and more a silence came over him , he was less and less acutely aware of his surroundings . The pain seemed to absorb his activity . He knew it was there , he knew it would come again . It was like something lurking in the darkness within him . And he had not the power , or the will , to seek it out and to know it . There it remained in the darkness , the great pain , tearing him at times , and then being silent . And when it tore him he crouched in silent subjection under it , and when it left him alone again , he refused to know of it . It was within the darkness , let it remain unknown . So he never admitted it , except in a secret corner of himself , where all his never - revealed fears and secrets were accumulated . For the rest , he had a pain , it went away , it made no difference . It even stimulated him , excited him . But it gradually absorbed his life . Gradually it drew away all his potentiality , it bled him into the dark , it weaned him of life and drew him away into the darkness . And in this twilight of his life little remained visible to him . The business , his work , that was gone entirely . His public interests had disappeared as if they had never been . Even his family had become extraneous to him , he could only remember , in some slight non - essential part of himself , that such and such were his children . But it was historical fact , not vital to him . He had to make an effort to know their relation to him . Even his wife barely existed . She indeed was like the darkness , like the pain within him . By some strange association , the darkness that contained the pain and the darkness that contained his wife were identical . All his thoughts and understandings became blurred and fused , and now his wife and the consuming pain were the same dark secret power against him , that he never faced . He never drove the dread out of its lair within him . He only knew that there was a dark place , and something inhabiting this darkness which issued from time to time and rent him . But he dared not penetrate and drive the beast into the open . He had rather ignore its existence . Only , in his vague way , the dread was his wife , the destroyer , and it was the pain , the destruction , a darkness which was one and both . He very rarely saw his wife . She kept her room . Only occasionally she came forth , with her head stretched forward , and in her low , possessed voice , she asked him how he was . And he answered her , in the habit of more than thirty years : “
100596	100665	100588	100588	I	0	” But he was frightened of her , underneath this safeguard of habit , frightened almost to the verge of death . But all his life , he had been so constant to his lights , he had never broken down . He would die even now without breaking down , without knowing what his feelings were , towards her . All his life , he had said : “
100676	101319	100669	100669	she	304	” With unbroken will , he had stood by this position with regard to her , he had substituted pity for all his hostility , pity had been his shield and his safeguard , and his infallible weapon . And still , in his consciousness , he was sorry for her , her nature was so violent and so impatient . But now his pity , with his life , was wearing thin , and the dread almost amounting to horror , was rising into being . But before the armour of his pity really broke , he would die , as an insect when its shell is cracked . This was his final resource . Others would live on , and know the living death , the ensuing process of hopeless chaos . He would not . He denied death its victory . He had been so constant to his lights , so constant to charity , and to his love for his neighbour . Perhaps he had loved his neighbour even better than himself — which is going one further than the commandment . Always , this flame had burned in his heart , sustaining him through everything , the welfare of the people . He was a large employer of labour , he was a great mine - owner . And he had never lost this from his heart , that in Christ he was one with his workmen . Nay , he had felt inferior to them , as if they through poverty and labour were nearer to God than he . He had always the unacknowledged belief , that it was his workmen , the miners , who held in their hands the means of salvation . To move nearer to God , he must move towards his miners , his life must gravitate towards theirs . They were , unconsciously , his idol , his God made manifest . In them he worshipped the highest , the great , sympathetic , mindless Godhead of humanity . And all the while , his wife had opposed him like one of the great demons of hell . Strange , like a bird of prey , with the fascinating beauty and abstraction of a hawk , she had beat against the bars of his philanthropy , and like a hawk in a cage , she had sunk into silence . By force of circumstance , because all the world combined to make the cage unbreakable , he had been too strong for her , he had kept her prisoner . And because she was his prisoner , his passion for her had always remained keen as death . He had always loved her , loved her with intensity . Within the cage , she was denied nothing , she was given all licence . But she had gone almost mad . Of wild and overweening temper , she could not bear the humiliation of her husband ’s soft , half - appealing kindness to everybody . He was not deceived by the poor . He knew they came and sponged on him , and whined to him , the worse sort ; the majority , luckily for him , were much too proud to ask for anything , much too independent to come knocking at his door . But in Beldover , as everywhere else , there were the whining , parasitic , foul human beings who come crawling after charity , and feeding on the living body of the public like lice . A kind of fire would go over Christiana Crich ’s brain , as she saw two more pale - faced , creeping women in objectionable black clothes , cringing lugubriously up the drive to the door . She wanted to set the dogs on them , “
101336	101377	101328	101330	At ’em boys	2461	” But Crowther , the butler , with all the rest of the servants , was Mr Crich ’s man . Nevertheless , when her husband was away , she would come down like a wolf on the crawling supplicants : “
101416	101503	101504	101504	Person	2465	” The servants had to obey her . And she would stand watching with an eye like the eagle ’s , whilst the groom in clumsy confusion drove the lugubrious persons down the drive , as if they were rusty fowls , scuttling before him . But they learned to know , from the lodge - keeper , when Mrs Crich was away , and they timed their visits . How many times , in the first years , would Crowther knock softly at the door : “
101511	101512	101504	101504	Person	2465	” “
101516	101517	101518	101518	Grocock	309	” “
101522	101523	101518	101518	Grocock	309	” “
101529	101547	101526	101526	they	2463	” The question was half impatient , half gratified . He liked hearing appeals to his charity . “
101554	101555	101526	101526	they	2463	” “
101576	101577	101526	101526	they	2463	” “
101588	101595	101580	101580	you	2462	” his wife would say abruptly . “
101617	101618	101612	101612	they	2463	” “
101646	101647	101637	101637	They	2463	” “
101686	101687	101677	101677	my	0	” “
101706	101707	101694	101699	all the rats in the world	2475	” “
101723	101757	101758	101759	Mr Crich	171	” But she suddenly swept out of the room , and out to the study . There sat the meagre charity - seekers , looking as if they were at the doctor ’s . “
101802	101828	101831	101831	I	0	” The poor people rose in confusion . But Mr Crich , pale and black - bearded and deprecating , came behind her , saying : “
101878	101879	101876	101876	Missis	311	” “
101899	103353	103355	103355	he	2480	” Sometimes , it seemed to Mrs Crich as if her husband were some subtle funeral bird , feeding on the miseries of the people . It seemed to her he was never satisfied unless there was some sordid tale being poured out to him , which he drank in with a sort of mournful , sympathetic satisfaction . He would have no raison d’être if there were no lugubrious miseries in the world , as an undertaker would have no meaning if there were no funerals . Mrs Crich recoiled back upon herself , she recoiled away from this world of creeping democracy . A band of tight , baleful exclusion fastened round her heart , her isolation was fierce and hard , her antagonism was passive but terribly pure , like that of a hawk in a cage . As the years went on , she lost more and more count of the world , she seemed rapt in some glittering abstraction , almost purely unconscious . She would wander about the house and about the surrounding country , staring keenly and seeing nothing . She rarely spoke , she had no connection with the world . And she did not even think . She was consumed in a fierce tension of opposition , like the negative pole of a magnet . And she bore many children . For , as time went on , she never opposed her husband in word or deed . She took no notice of him , externally . She submitted to him , let him take what he wanted and do as he wanted with her . She was like a hawk that sullenly submits to everything . The relation between her and her husband was wordless and unknown , but it was deep , awful , a relation of utter inter - destruction . And he , who triumphed in the world , he became more and more hollow in his vitality , the vitality was bled from within him , as by some hæmorrhage . She was hulked like a hawk in a cage , but her heart was fierce and undiminished within her , though her mind was destroyed . So to the last he would go to her and hold her in his arms sometimes , before his strength was all gone . The terrible white , destructive light that burned in her eyes only excited and roused him . Till he was bled to death , and then he dreaded her more than anything . But he always said to himself , how happy he had been , how he had loved her with a pure and consuming love ever since he had known her . And he thought of her as pure , chaste ; the white flame which was known to him alone , the flame of her sex , was a white flower of snow to his mind . She was a wonderful white snow - flower , which he had desired infinitely . And now he was dying with all his ideas and interpretations intact . They would only collapse when the breath left his body . Till then they would be pure truths for him . Only death would show the perfect completeness of the lie . Till death , she was his white snow - flower . He had subdued her , and her subjugation was to him an infinite chastity in her , a virginity which he could never break , and which dominated him as by a spell . She had let go the outer world , but within herself she was unbroken and unimpaired . She only sat in her room like a moping , dishevelled hawk , motionless , mindless . Her children , for whom she had been so fierce in her youth , now meant scarcely anything to her . She had lost all that , she was quite by herself . Only Gerald , the gleaming , had some existence for her . But of late years , since he had become head of the business , he too was forgotten . Whereas the father , now he was dying , turned for compassion to Gerald . There had always been opposition between the two of them . Gerald had feared and despised his father , and to a great extent had avoided him all through boyhood and young manhood . And the father had felt very often a real dislike of his eldest son , which , never wanting to give way to , he had refused to acknowledge . He had ignored Gerald as much as possible , leaving him alone . Since , however , Gerald had come home and assumed responsibility in the firm , and had proved such a wonderful director , the father , tired and weary of all outside concerns , had put all his trust of these things in his son , implicitly , leaving everything to him , and assuming a rather touching dependence on the young enemy . This immediately roused a poignant pity and allegiance in Gerald ’s heart , always shadowed by contempt and by unadmitted enmity . For Gerald was in reaction against Charity ; and yet he was dominated by it , it assumed supremacy in the inner life , and he could not confute it . So he was partly subject to that which his father stood for , but he was in reaction against it . Now he could not save himself . A certain pity and grief and tenderness for his father overcame him , in spite of the deeper , more sullen hostility . The father won shelter from Gerald through compassion . But for love he had Winifred . She was his youngest child , she was the only one of his children whom he had ever closely loved . And her he loved with all the great , overweening , sheltering love of a dying man . He wanted to shelter her infinitely , infinitely , to wrap her in warmth and love and shelter , perfectly . If he could save her she should never know one pain , one grief , one hurt . He had been so right all his life , so constant in his kindness and his goodness . And this was his last passionate righteousness , his love for the child Winifred . Some things troubled him yet . The world had passed away from him , as his strength ebbed . There were no more poor and injured and humble to protect and succour . These were all lost to him . There were no more sons and daughters to trouble him , and to weigh on him as an unnatural responsibility . These too had faded out of reality . All these things had fallen out of his hands , and left him free . There remained the covert fear and horror of his wife , as she sat mindless and strange in her room , or as she came forth with slow , prowling step , her head bent forward . But this he put away . Even his life - long righteousness , however , would not quite deliver him from the inner horror . Still , he could keep it sufficiently at bay . It would never break forth openly . Death would come first . Then there was Winifred ! If only he could be sure about her , if only he could be sure . Since the death of Diana , and the development of his illness , his craving for surety with regard to Winifred amounted almost to obsession . It was as if , even dying , he must have some anxiety , some responsibility of love , of Charity , upon his heart . She was an odd , sensitive , inflammable child , having her father ’s dark hair and quiet bearing , but being quite detached , momentaneous . She was like a changeling indeed , as if her feelings did not matter to her , really . She often seemed to be talking and playing like the gayest and most childish of children , she was full of the warmest , most delightful affection for a few things — for her father , and for her animals in particular . But if she heard that her beloved kitten Leo had been run over by the motor - car she put her head on one side , and replied , with a faint contraction like resentment on her face : “
103357	104642	103355	103355	he	2480	” Then she took no more notice . She only disliked the servant who would force bad news on her , and wanted her to be sorry . She wished not to know , and that seemed her chief motive . She avoided her mother , and most of the members of her family . She loved her Daddy , because he wanted her always to be happy , and because he seemed to become young again , and irresponsible in her presence . She liked Gerald , because he was so self - contained . She loved people who would make life a game for her . She had an amazing instinctive critical faculty , and was a pure anarchist , a pure aristocrat at once . For she accepted her equals wherever she found them , and she ignored with blithe indifference her inferiors , whether they were her brothers and sisters , or whether they were wealthy guests of the house , or whether they were the common people or the servants . She was quite single and by herself , deriving from nobody . It was as if she were cut off from all purpose or continuity , and existed simply moment by moment . The father , as by some strange final illusion , felt as if all his fate depended on his ensuring to Winifred her happiness . She who could never suffer , because she never formed vital connections , she who could lose the dearest things of her life and be just the same the next day , the whole memory dropped out , as if deliberately , she whose will was so strangely and easily free , anarchistic , almost nihilistic , who like a soulless bird flits on its own will , without attachment or responsibility beyond the moment , who in her every motion snapped the threads of serious relationship with blithe , free hands , really nihilistic , because never troubled , she must be the object of her father ’s final passionate solicitude . When Mr Crich heard that Gudrun Brangwen might come to help Winifred with her drawing and modelling he saw a road to salvation for his child . He believed that Winifred had talent , he had seen Gudrun , he knew that she was an exceptional person . He could give Winifred into her hands as into the hands of a right being . Here was a direction and a positive force to be lent to his child , he need not leave her directionless and defenceless . If he could but graft the girl on to some tree of utterance before he died , he would have fulfilled his responsibility . And here it could be done . He did not hesitate to appeal to Gudrun . Meanwhile , as the father drifted more and more out of life , Gerald experienced more and more a sense of exposure . His father after all had stood for the living world to him . Whilst his father lived Gerald was not responsible for the world . But now his father was passing away , Gerald found himself left exposed and unready before the storm of living , like the mutinous first mate of a ship that has lost his captain , and who sees only a terrible chaos in front of him . He did not inherit an established order and a living idea . The whole unifying idea of mankind seemed to be dying with his father , the centralising force that had held the whole together seemed to collapse with his father , the parts were ready to go asunder in terrible disintegration . Gerald was as if left on board of a ship that was going asunder beneath his feet , he was in charge of a vessel whose timbers were all coming apart . He knew that all his life he had been wrenching at the frame of life to break it apart . And now , with something of the terror of a destructive child , he saw himself on the point of inheriting his own destruction . And during the last months , under the influence of death , and of Birkin ’s talk , and of Gudrun ’s penetrating being , he had lost entirely that mechanical certainty that had been his triumph . Sometimes spasms of hatred came over him , against Birkin and Gudrun and that whole set . He wanted to go back to the dullest conservatism , to the most stupid of conventional people . He wanted to revert to the strictest Toryism . But the desire did not last long enough to carry him into action . During his childhood and his boyhood he had wanted a sort of savagedom . The days of Homer were his ideal , when a man was chief of an army of heroes , or spent his years in wonderful Odyssey . He hated remorselessly the circumstances of his own life , so much that he never really saw Beldover and the colliery valley . He turned his face entirely away from the blackened mining region that stretched away on the right hand of Shortlands , he turned entirely to the country and the woods beyond Willey Water . It was true that the panting and rattling of the coal mines could always be heard at Shortlands . But from his earliest childhood , Gerald had paid no heed to this . He had ignored the whole of the industrial sea which surged in coal - blackened tides against the grounds of the house . The world was really a wilderness where one hunted and swam and rode . He rebelled against all authority . Life was a condition of savage freedom . Then he had been sent away to school , which was so much death to him . He refused to go to Oxford , choosing a German university . He had spent a certain time at Bonn , at Berlin , and at Frankfurt . There , a curiosity had been aroused in his mind . He wanted to see and to know , in a curious objective fashion , as if it were an amusement to him . Then he must try war . Then he must travel into the savage regions that had so attracted him . The result was , he found humanity very much alike everywhere , and to a mind like his , curious and cold , the savage was duller , less exciting than the European . So he took hold of all kinds of sociological ideas , and ideas of reform . But they never went more than skin - deep , they were never more than a mental amusement . Their interest lay chiefly in the reaction against the positive order , the destructive reaction . He discovered at last a real adventure in the coal - mines . His father asked him to help in the firm . Gerald had been educated in the science of mining , and it had never interested him . Now , suddenly , with a sort of exultation , he laid hold of the world . There was impressed photographically on his consciousness the great industry . Suddenly , it was real , he was part of it . Down the valley ran the colliery railway , linking mine with mine . Down the railway ran the trains , short trains of heavily laden trucks , long trains of empty wagons , each one bearing in big white letters the initials : “
104647	105966	105967	105967	Ye	2481	” These white letters on all the wagons he had seen since his first childhood , and it was as if he had never seen them , they were so familiar , and so ignored . Now at last he saw his own name written on the wall . Now he had a vision of power . So many wagons , bearing his initial , running all over the country . He saw them as he entered London in the train , he saw them at Dover . So far his power ramified . He looked at Beldover , at Selby , at Whatmore , at Lethley Bank , the great colliery villages which depended entirely on his mines . They were hideous and sordid , during his childhood they had been sores in his consciousness . And now he saw them with pride . Four raw new towns , and many ugly industrial hamlets were crowded under his dependence . He saw the stream of miners flowing along the causeways from the mines at the end of the afternoon , thousands of blackened , slightly distorted human beings with red mouths , all moving subjugate to his will . He pushed slowly in his motor - car through the little market - top on Friday nights in Beldover , through a solid mass of human beings that were making their purchases and doing their weekly spending . They were all subordinate to him . They were ugly and uncouth , but they were his instruments . He was the God of the machine . They made way for his motor - car automatically , slowly . He did not care whether they made way with alacrity , or grudgingly . He did not care what they thought of him . His vision had suddenly crystallised . Suddenly he had conceived the pure instrumentality of mankind . There had been so much humanitarianism , so much talk of sufferings and feelings . It was ridiculous . The sufferings and feelings of individuals did not matter in the least . They were mere conditions , like the weather . What mattered was the pure instrumentality of the individual . As a man as of a knife : does it cut well ? Nothing else mattered . Everything in the world has its function , and is good or not good in so far as it fulfils this function more or less perfectly . Was a miner a good miner ? Then he was complete . Was a manager a good manager ? That was enough . Gerald himself , who was responsible for all this industry , was he a good director ? If he were , he had fulfilled his life . The rest was by - play . The mines were there , they were old . They were giving out , it did not pay to work the seams . There was talk of closing down two of them . It was at this point that Gerald arrived on the scene . He looked around . There lay the mines . They were old , obsolete . They were like old lions , no more good . He looked again . Pah ! the mines were nothing but the clumsy efforts of impure minds . There they lay , abortions of a half - trained mind . Let the idea of them be swept away . He cleared his brain of them , and thought only of the coal in the under earth . How much was there ? There was plenty of coal . The old workings could not get at it , that was all . Then break the neck of the old workings . The coal lay there in its seams , even though the seams were thin . There it lay , inert matter , as it had always lain , since the beginning of time , subject to the will of man . The will of man was the determining factor . Man was the archgod of earth . His mind was obedient to serve his will . Man ’s will was the absolute , the only absolute . And it was his will to subjugate Matter to his own ends . The subjugation itself was the point , the fight was the be - all , the fruits of victory were mere results . It was not for the sake of money that Gerald took over the mines . He did not care about money , fundamentally . He was neither ostentatious nor luxurious , neither did he care about social position , not finally . What he wanted was the pure fulfilment of his own will in the struggle with the natural conditions . His will was now , to take the coal out of the earth , profitably . The profit was merely the condition of victory , but the victory itself lay in the feat achieved . He vibrated with zest before the challenge . Every day he was in the mines , examining , testing , he consulted experts , he gradually gathered the whole situation into his mind , as a general grasps the plan of his campaign . Then there was need for a complete break . The mines were run on an old system , an obsolete idea . The initial idea had been , to obtain as much money from the earth as would make the owners comfortably rich , would allow the workmen sufficient wages and good conditions , and would increase the wealth of the country altogether . Gerald ’s father , following in the second generation , having a sufficient fortune , had thought only of the men . The mines , for him , were primarily great fields to produce bread and plenty for all the hundreds of human beings gathered about them . He had lived and striven with his fellow owners to benefit the men every time . And the men had been benefited in their fashion . There were few poor , and few needy . All was plenty , because the mines were good and easy to work . And the miners , in those days , finding themselves richer than they might have expected , felt glad and triumphant . They thought themselves well - off , they congratulated themselves on their good - fortune , they remembered how their fathers had starved and suffered , and they felt that better times had come . They were grateful to those others , the pioneers , the new owners , who had opened out the pits , and let forth this stream of plenty . But man is never satisfied , and so the miners , from gratitude to their owners , passed on to murmuring . Their sufficiency decreased with knowledge , they wanted more . Why should the master be so out - of - all - proportion rich ? There was a crisis when Gerald was a boy , when the Masters ’ Federation closed down the mines because the men would not accept a reduction . This lock - out had forced home the new conditions to Thomas Crich . Belonging to the Federation , he had been compelled by his honour to close the pits against his men . He , the father , the Patriarch , was forced to deny the means of life to his sons , his people . He , the rich man who would hardly enter heaven because of his possessions , must now turn upon the poor , upon those who were nearer Christ than himself , those who were humble and despised and closer to perfection , those who were manly and noble in their labours , and must say to them : “
105975	106111	105967	105967	Ye	2481	” It was this recognition of the state of war which really broke his heart . He wanted his industry to be run on love . Oh , he wanted love to be the directing power even of the mines . And now , from under the cloak of love , the sword was cynically drawn , the sword of mechanical necessity . This really broke his heart . He must have the illusion and now the illusion was destroyed . The men were not against him , but they were against the masters . It was war , and willy nilly he found himself on the wrong side , in his own conscience . Seething masses of miners met daily , carried away by a new religious impulse . The idea flew through them : “
106119	106159	106112	106113	All men	2482	” and they would carry the idea to its material fulfilment . After all , is it not the teaching of Christ ? And what is an idea , if not the germ of action in the material world . “
106180	106584	106112	106113	All men	2482	” It was a religious creed pushed to its material conclusion . Thomas Crich at least had no answer . He could but admit , according to his sincere tenets , that the disquality was wrong . But he could not give up his goods , which were the stuff of disquality . So the men would fight for their rights . The last impulses of the last religious passion left on earth , the passion for equality , inspired them . Seething mobs of men marched about , their faces lighted up as for holy war , with a smoke of cupidity . How disentangle the passion for equality from the passion of cupidity , when begins the fight for equality of possessions ? But the God was the machine . Each man claimed equality in the Godhead of the great productive machine . Every man equally was part of this Godhead . But somehow , somewhere , Thomas Crich knew this was false . When the machine is the Godhead , and production or work is worship , then the most mechanical mind is purest and highest , the representative of God on earth . And the rest are subordinate , each according to his degree . Riots broke out , Whatmore pit - head was in flames . This was the pit furthest in the country , near the woods . Soldiers came . From the windows of Shortlands , on that fatal day , could be seen the flare of fire in the sky not far off , and now the little colliery train , with the workmen ’s carriages which were used to convey the miners to the distant Whatmore , was crossing the valley full of soldiers , full of redcoats . Then there was the far - off sound of firing , then the later news that the mob was dispersed , one man was shot dead , the fire was put out . Gerald , who was a boy , was filled with the wildest excitement and delight . He longed to go with the soldiers to shoot the men . But he was not allowed to go out of the lodge gates . At the gates were stationed sentries with guns . Gerald stood near them in delight , whilst gangs of derisive miners strolled up and down the lanes , calling and jeering : “
106602	108225	106597	106597	thee	2487	” Insults were chalked on the walls and the fences , the servants left . And all this while Thomas Crich was breaking his heart , and giving away hundreds of pounds in charity . Everywhere there was free food , a surfeit of free food . Anybody could have bread for asking , and a loaf cost only three - ha’pence . Every day there was a free tea somewhere , the children had never had so many treats in their lives . On Friday afternoon great basketfuls of buns and cakes were taken into the schools , and great pitchers of milk , the schoolchildren had what they wanted . They were sick with eating too much cake and milk . And then it came to an end , and the men went back to work . But it was never the same as before . There was a new situation created , a new idea reigned . Even in the machine , there should be equality . No part should be subordinate to any other part : all should be equal . The instinct for chaos had entered . Mystic equality lies in abstraction , not in having or in doing , which are processes . In function and process , one man , one part , must of necessity be subordinate to another . It is a condition of being . But the desire for chaos had risen , and the idea of mechanical equality was the weapon of disruption which should execute the will of man , the will for chaos . Gerald was a boy at the time of the strike , but he longed to be a man , to fight the colliers . The father however was trapped between two half - truths , and broken . He wanted to be a pure Christian , one and equal with all men . He even wanted to give away all he had , to the poor . Yet he was a great promoter of industry , and he knew perfectly that he must keep his goods and keep his authority . This was as divine a necessity in him , as the need to give away all he possessed — more divine , even , since this was the necessity he acted upon . Yet because he did not act on the other ideal , it dominated him , he was dying of chagrin because he must forfeit it . He wanted to be a father of loving kindness and sacrificial benevolence . The colliers shouted to him about his thousands a year . They would not be deceived . When Gerald grew up in the ways of the world , he shifted the position . He did not care about the equality . The whole Christian attitude of love and self - sacrifice was old hat . He knew that position and authority were the right thing in the world , and it was useless to ca nt about it . They were the right thing , for the simple reason that they were functionally necessary . They were not the be - all and the end - all . It was like being part of a machine . He himself happened to be a controlling , central part , the masses of men were the parts variously controlled . This was merely as it happened . As well get excited because a central hub drives a hundred outer wheels or because the whole universe wheels round the sun . After all , it would be mere silliness to say that the moon and the earth and Saturn and Jupiter and Venus have just as much right to be the centre of the universe , each of them separately , as the sun . Such an assertion is made merely in the desire of chaos . Without bothering to think to a conclusion , Gerald jumped to a conclusion . He abandoned the whole democratic - equality problem as a problem of silliness . What mattered was the great social productive machine . Let that work perfectly , let it produce a sufficiency of everything , let every man be given a rational portion , greater or less according to his functional degree or magnitude , and then , provision made , let the devil supervene , let every man look after his own amusements and appetites , so long as he interfered with nobody . So Gerald set himself to work , to put the great industry in order . In his travels , and in his accompanying readings , he had come to the conclusion that the essential secret of life was harmony . He did not define to himself at all clearly what harmony was . The word pleased him , he felt he had come to his own conclusions . And he proceeded to put his philosophy into practice by forcing order into the established world , translating the mystic word harmony into the practical word organisation . Immediately he saw the firm , he realised what he could do . He had a fight to fight with Matter , with the earth and the coal it enclosed . This was the sole idea , to turn upon the inanimate matter of the underground , and reduce it to his will . And for this fight with matter , one must have perfect instruments in perfect organisation , a mechanism so subtle and harmonious in its workings that it represents the single mind of man , and by its relentless repetition of given movement , will accomplish a purpose irresistibly , inhumanly . It was this inhuman principle in the mechanism he wanted to construct that inspired Gerald with an almost religious exaltation . He , the man , could interpose a perfect , changeless , godlike medium between himself and the Matter he had to subjugate . There were two opposites , his will and the resistant Matter of the earth . And between these he could establish the very expression of his will , the incarnation of his power , a great and perfect machine , a system , an activity of pure order , pure mechanical repetition , repetition ad infinitum , hence eternal and infinite . He found his eternal and his infinite in the pure machine - principle of perfect co - ordination into one pure , complex , infinitely repeated motion , like the spinning of a wheel ; but a productive spinning , as the revolving of the universe may be called a productive spinning , a productive repetition through eternity , to infinity . And this is the God - motion , this productive repetition ad infinitum . And Gerald was the God of the machine , Deus ex Machina . And the whole productive will of man was the Godhead . He had his life - work now , to extend over the earth a great and perfect system in which the will of man ran smooth and unthwarted , timeless , a Godhead in process . He had to begin with the mines . The terms were given : first the resistant Matter of the underground ; then the instruments of its subjugation , instruments human and metallic ; and finally his own pure will , his own mind . It would need a marvellous adjustment of myriad instruments , human , animal , metallic , kinetic , dynamic , a marvellous casting of myriad tiny wholes into one great perfect entirety . And then , in this case there was perfection attained , the will of the highest was perfectly fulfilled , the will of mankind was perfectly enacted ; for was not mankind mystically contra - distinguished against inanimate Matter , was not the history of mankind just the history of the conquest of the one by the other ? The miners were overreached . While they were still in the toils of divine equality of man , Gerald had passed on , granted essentially their case , and proceeded in his quality of human being to fulfil the will of mankind as a whole . He merely represented the miners in a higher sense when he perceived that the only way to fulfil perfectly the will of man was to establish the perfect , inhuman machine . But he represented them very essentially , they were far behind , out of date , squabbling for their material equality . The desire had already transmuted into this new and greater desire , for a perfect intervening mechanism between man and Matter , the desire to translate the Godhead into pure mechanism . As soon as Gerald entered the firm , the convulsion of death ran through the old system . He had all his life been tortured by a furious and destructive demon , which possessed him sometimes like an insanity . This temper now entered like a virus into the firm , and there were cruel eruptions . Terrible and inhuman were his examinations into every detail ; there was no privacy he would spare , no old sentiment but he would turn it over . The old grey managers , the old grey clerks , the doddering old pensioners , he looked at them , and removed them as so much lumber . The whole concern seemed like a hospital of invalid employees . He had no emotional qualms . He arranged what pensions were necessary , he looked for efficient substitutes , and when these were found , he substituted them for the old hands . “
108235	108249	108226	108226	I	0	” his father would say , in a tone of deprecation and appeal . “
108272	108273	108264	108264	I	0	” “
108308	108309	108297	108297	You	4673	” “
108347	108348	108334	108334	he	2488	” “
108363	108434	108435	108435	Gerald	255	” The father sighed . He wanted not to know any more . He believed the pits would have to be overhauled if they were to go on working . And after all , it would be worst in the long run for everybody , if they must close down . So he could make no answer to the appeals of his old and trusty servants , he could only repeat “
108438	108589	108435	108435	Gerald	255	” So the father drew more and more out of the light . The whole frame of the real life was broken for him . He had been right according to his lights . And his lights had been those of the great religion . Yet they seemed to have become obsolete , to be superseded in the world . He could not understand . He only withdrew with his lights into an inner room , into the silence . The beautiful candles of belief , that would not do to light the world any more , they would still burn sweetly and sufficiently in the inner room of his soul , and in the silence of his retirement . Gerald rushed into the reform of the firm , beginning with the office . It was needful to economise severely , to make possible the great alterations he must introduce . “
108597	108601	108602	108602	We	2493	” he asked . “
108623	108624	108625	108625	They	2492	” “
108646	110345	108641	108641	everybody	780	” Widows , these stock figures of sentimental humanitarianism , he felt a dislike at the thought of them . They were almost repulsive . Why were they not immolated on the pyre of the husband , like the sati in India ? At any rate , let them pay the cost of their coals . In a thousand ways he cut down the expenditure , in ways so fine as to be hardly noticeable to the men . The miners must pay for the cartage of their coals , heavy cartage too ; they must pay for their tools , for the sharpening , for the care of lamps , for the many trifling things that made the bill of charges against every man mount up to a shilling or so in the week . It was not grasped very definitely by the miners , though they were sore enough . But it saved hundreds of pounds every week for the firm . Gradually Gerald got hold of everything . And then began the great reform . Expert engineers were introduced in every department . An enormous electric plant was installed , both for lighting and for haulage underground , and for power . The electricity was carried into every mine . New machinery was brought from America , such as the miners had never seen before , great iron men , as the cutting machines were called , and unusual appliances . The working of the pits was thoroughly changed , all the control was taken out of the hands of the miners , the butty system was abolished . Everything was run on the most accurate and delicate scientific method , educated and expert men were in control everywhere , the miners were reduced to mere mechanical instruments . They had to work hard , much harder than before , the work was terrible and heart - breaking in its mechanicalness . But they submitted to it all . The joy went out of their lives , the hope seemed to perish as they became more and more mechanised . And yet they accepted the new conditions . They even got a further satisfaction out of them . At first they hated Gerald Crich , they swore to do something to him , to murder him . But as time went on , they accepted everything with some fatal satisfaction . Gerald was their high priest , he represented the religion they really felt . His father was forgotten already . There was a new world , a new order , strict , terrible , inhuman , but satisfying in its very destructiveness . The men were satisfied to belong to the great and wonderful machine , even whilst it destroyed them . It was what they wanted . It was the highest that man had produced , the most wonderful and superhuman . They were exalted by belonging to this great and superhuman system which was beyond feeling or reason , something really godlike . Their hearts died within them , but their souls were satisfied . It was what they wanted . Otherwise Gerald could never have done what he did . He was just ahead of them in giving them what they wanted , this participation in a great and perfect system that subjected life to pure mathematical principles . This was a sort of freedom , the sort they really wanted . It was the first great step in undoing , the first great phase of chaos , the substitution of the mechanical principle for the organic , the destruction of the organic purpose , the organic unity , and the subordination of every organic unit to the great mechanical purpose . It was pure organic disintegration and pure mechanical organisation . This is the first and finest state of chaos . Gerald was satisfied . He knew the colliers said they hated him . But he had long ceased to hate them . When they streamed past him at evening , their heavy boots slurring on the pavement wearily , their shoulders slightly distorted , they took no notice of him , they gave him no greeting whatever , they passed in a grey - black stream of unemotional acceptance . They were not important to him , save as instruments , nor he to them , save as a supreme instrument of control . As miners they had their being , he had his being as director . He admired their qualities . But as men , personalities , they were just accidents , sporadic little unimportant phenomena . And tacitly , the men agreed to this . For Gerald agreed to it in himself . He had succeeded . He had converted the industry into a new and terrible purity . There was a greater output of coal than ever , the wonderful and delicate system ran almost perfectly . He had a set of really clever engineers , both mining and electrical , and they did not cost much . A highly educated man cost very little more than a workman . His managers , who were all rare men , were no more expensive than the old bungling fools of his father ’s days , who were merely colliers promoted . His chief manager , who had twelve hundred a year , saved the firm at least five thousand . The whole system was now so perfect that Gerald was hardly necessary any more . It was so perfect that sometimes a strange fear came over him , and he did not know what to do . He went on for some years in a sort of trance of activity . What he was doing seemed supreme , he was almost like a divinity . He was a pure and exalted activity . But now he had succeeded — he had finally succeeded . And once or twice lately , when he was alone in the evening and had nothing to do , he had suddenly stood up in terror , not knowing what he was . And he went to the mirror and looked long and closely at his own face , at his own eyes , seeking for something . He was afraid , in mortal dry fear , but he knew not what of . He looked at his own face . There it was , shapely and healthy and the same as ever , yet somehow , it was not real , it was a mask . He dared not touch it , for fear it should prove to be only a composition mask . His eyes were blue and keen as ever , and as firm in their sockets . Yet he was not sure that they were not blue false bubbles that would burst in a moment and leave clear annihilation . He could see the darkness in them , as if they were only bubbles of darkness . He was afraid that one day he would break down and be a purely meaningless babble lapping round a darkness . But his will yet held good , he was able to go away and read , and think about things . He liked to read books about the primitive man , books of anthropology , and also works of speculative philosophy . His mind was very active . But it was like a bubble floating in the darkness . At any moment it might burst and leave him in chaos . He would not die . He knew that . He would go on living , but the meaning would have collapsed out of him , his divine reason would be gone . In a strangely indifferent , sterile way , he was frightened . But he could not react even to the fear . It was as if his centres of feeling were drying up . He remained calm , calculative and healthy , and quite freely deliberate , even whilst he felt , with faint , small but final sterile horror , that his mystic reason was breaking , giving way now , at this crisis . And it was a strain . He knew there was no equilibrium . He would have to go in some direction , shortly , to find relief . Only Birkin kept the fear definitely off him , saved him his quick sufficiency in life , by the odd mobility and changeableness which seemed to contain the quintessence of faith . But then Gerald must always come away from Birkin , as from a Church service , back to the outside real world of work and life . There it was , it did not alter , and words were futilities . He had to keep himself in reckoning with the world of work and material life . And it became more and more difficult , such a strange pressure was upon him , as if the very middle of him were a vacuum , and outside were an awful tension . He had found his most satisfactory relief in women . After a debauch with some desperate woman , he went on quite easy and forgetful . The devil of it was , it was so hard to keep up his interest in women nowadays . He did n’t care about them any more . A Pussum was all right in her way , but she was an exceptional case , and even she mattered extremely little . No , women , in that sense , were useless to him any more . He felt that his mind needed acute stimulation , before he could be physically roused . Gudrun knew that it was a critical thing for her to go to Shortlands . She knew it was equivalent to accepting Gerald Crich as a lover . And though she hung back , disliking the condition , yet she knew she would go on . She equivocated . She said to herself , in torment recalling the blow and the kiss , “
110397	110464	110465	110465	Winnie	297	” For she had an insatiable curiosity to see and to know everything . She also wanted to know what Winifred was really like . Having heard the child calling from the steamer in the night , she felt some mysterious connection with her . Gudrun talked with the father in the library . Then he sent for his daughter . She came accompanied by Mademoiselle . “
110491	110539	110469	110470	Miss Brangwen	195	” said the father . The child looked at Gudrun for a moment with interest , before she came forward and with face averted offered her hand . There was a complete sang - froid and indifference under Winifred ’s childish reserve , a certain irresponsible callousness . “
110545	110555	110558	110558	you	2499	” said the child , not lifting her face . “
110561	110577	110558	110558	you	2499	” said Gudrun . Then Winifred stood aside , and Gudrun was introduced to Mademoiselle . “
110587	110596	110578	110578	You	297	” said Mademoiselle , in a bright manner . “
110600	110680	110578	110578	You	297	” said Gudrun . Winifred was watching from her distance . She was as if amused , but rather unsure as yet what this new person was like . She saw so many new persons , and so few who became real to her . Mademoiselle was of no count whatever , the child merely put up with her , calmly and easily , accepting her little authority with faint scorn , compliant out of childish arrogance of indifference . “
110685	110690	110683	110683	Winifred	297	” said the father , “
110728	110733	110700	110700	She	195	” Winifred smiled slightly . “
110740	110744	110738	110738	Daddie	323	” she asked . “
110757	110758	110754	110755	Rupert Birkin	169	” “
110764	110777	110760	110760	you	297	” Winifred asked of Gudrun , turning to her with faint challenge . “
110780	111007	110760	110760	you	297	” said Gudrun . Winifred readjusted herself a little . She had been ready to accept Gudrun as a sort of servant . Now she saw it was on terms of friendship they were intended to meet . She was rather glad . She had so many half inferiors , whom she tolerated with perfect good - humour . Gudrun was very calm . She also did not take these things very seriously . A new occasion was mostly spectacular to her . However , Winifred was a detached , ironic child , she would never attach herself . Gudrun liked her and was intrigued by her . The first meetings went off with a certain humiliating clumsiness . Neither Winifred nor her instructress had any social grace . Soon , however , they met in a kind of make - belief world . Winifred did not notice human beings unless they were like herself , playful and slightly mocking . She would accept nothing but the world of amusement , and the serious people of her life were the animals she had for pets . On those she lavished , almost ironically , her affection and her companionship . To the rest of the human scheme she submitted with a faint bored indifference . She had a pekinese dog called Looloo , which she loved . “
111013	111017	111011	111011	Looloo	324	” said Gudrun , “
111030	111031	111032	111032	Darling	4727	” “
111034	111058	111032	111032	Darling	4727	” cried Winifred , rushing to the dog , that sat with contemplative sadness on the hearth , and kissing its bulging brow . “
111074	111087	111032	111032	Darling	4727	” Then she chuckled gleefully , and turning to Gudrun , said : “
111092	111105	111032	111032	Darling	4727	” They proceeded to get pencils and paper , and were ready . “
111108	111116	111032	111032	Darling	4727	” cried Winifred , hugging the dog , “
111127	111152	111153	111153	I	0	” The dog looked up at her with grievous resignation in its large , prominent eyes . She kissed it fervently , and said : “
111168	111183	111153	111153	I	0	” As she sketched she chuckled to herself , and cried out at times : “
111192	111308	111314	111314	they	2505	” And again chuckling , she rushed to embrace the dog , in penitence , as if she were doing him some subtle injury . He sat all the time with the resignation and fretfulness of ages on his dark velvety face . She drew slowly , with a wicked concentration in her eyes , her head on one side , an intense stillness over her . She was as if working the spell of some enchantment . Suddenly she had finished . She looked at the dog , and then at her drawing , and then cried , with real grief for the dog , and at the same time with a wicked exultation : “
111316	111352	111354	111355	a Loolie	2506	” She took her paper to the dog , and held it under his nose . He turned his head aside as in chagrin and mortification , and she impulsively kissed his velvety bulging forehead . “
111382	111453	111375	111376	his mother	4685	” She looked at her paper and chuckled . Then , kissing the dog once more , she rose and came gravely to Gudrun , offering her the paper . It was a grotesque little diagram of a grotesque little animal , so wicked and so comical , a slow smile came over Gudrun ’s face , unconsciously . And at her side Winifred chuckled with glee , and said : “
111483	111527	111477	111477	Looloo	324	” And she flew off to embrace the chagrined little dog . He looked up at her with reproachful , saturnine eyes , vanquished in his extreme agedness of being . Then she flew back to her drawing , and chuckled with satisfaction . “
111537	111543	111532	111532	him	2507	” she said to Gudrun . “
111552	111580	111550	111550	him	2507	” Gudrun replied . The child treasured her drawing , carried it about with her , and showed it , with a silent embarrassment , to everybody . “
111583	111596	111600	111600	Looloo	324	” she said , thrusting the paper into her father ’s hand . “
111602	111864	111600	111600	Looloo	324	” he exclaimed . And he looked down in surprise , hearing the almost inhuman chuckle of the child at his side . Gerald was away from home when Gudrun first came to Shortlands . But the first morning he came back he watched for her . It was a sunny , soft morning , and he lingered in the garden paths , looking at the flowers that had come out during his absence . He was clean and fit as ever , shaven , his fair hair scrupulously parted at the side , bright in the sunshine , his short , fair moustache closely clipped , his eyes with their humorous kind twinkle , which was so deceptive . He was dressed in black , his clothes sat well on his well - nourished body . Yet as he lingered before the flower - beds in the morning sunshine , there was a certain isolation , a fear about him , as of something wanting . Gudrun came up quickly , unseen . She was dressed in blue , with woollen yellow stockings , like the Bluecoat boys . He glanced up in surprise . Her stockings always disconcerted him , the pale - yellow stockings and the heavy heavy black shoes . Winifred , who had been playing about the garden with Mademoiselle and the dogs , came flitting towards Gudrun . The child wore a dress of black - and - white stripes . Her hair was rather short , cut round and hanging level in her neck . “
111876	111888	111874	111874	we	2511	” she said , linking her hand through Gudrun ’s arm . “
111903	111904	111899	111899	you	2512	” “
111939	111950	111930	111930	He	327	” And the child chuckled sardonically at her own hyperbole . “
111961	111962	111957	111957	he	327	” “
111967	111992	111965	111965	Mademoiselle	322	” said the little French governess , wavering up with a slight bow , a bow of the sort that Gudrun loathed , insolent . “
112031	112032	112092	112092	Winifred	297	” “
112049	112061	112092	112092	Winifred	297	” said Gudrun in her good , but rather heavy French . “
112111	112112	112104	112105	Son Bismarck	327	” “
112133	112137	112138	112138	Bismarck	327	” cried Winifred . “
112158	112166	112155	112156	ein Wunder	2514	” said Gudrun , in mocking incantation . “
112174	112189	112155	112156	ein Wunder	2514	” repeated Winifred , with odd seriousness , under which lay a wicked chuckle . “
112196	112205	112155	112156	ein Wunder	2514	” came the slightly insolent sneering of Mademoiselle . “
112208	112215	112155	112156	ein Wunder	2514	” said Winifred briefly , indifferent . “
112247	112248	112238	112238	He	327	” “
112254	112263	112264	112265	A chancelier	2516	” said Winifred , with slightly contemptuous indifference . “
112283	112294	112278	112281	a sort of judge	2519	” said Gerald coming up and shaking hands with Gudrun . “
112305	112322	112295	112295	You	297	” said he . Mademoiselle waited , and discreetly made her inclination , and her greeting . “
112334	112338	112330	112330	Bismarck	327	” he said . “
112343	112344	112341	112341	Monsieur	2521	” “
112374	112375	112364	112364	I	0	” “
112379	112383	112364	112364	I	0	” cried Winifred . “
112391	112395	112384	112384	We	2523	” said Gudrun . “
112406	112414	112384	112384	We	2523	” he said , being purposely fatuous . “
112418	112457	112384	112384	We	2523	” cried Winifred with emphasis , chuckling . Gudrun detected the tang of mockery in him , and she looked up and smiled into his face . He felt his nerves caressed . Their eyes met in knowledge . “
112464	112468	112460	112460	you	195	” he asked . “
112474	112481	112460	112460	you	195	” she said , with nonchalance . “
112492	112523	112487	112487	you	195	” He led her along the path . She followed intently . Winifred came , and the governess lingered in the rear . They stopped before some veined salpiglossis flowers . “
112529	112601	112487	112487	you	195	” she cried , looking at them absorbedly . Strange how her reverential , almost ecstatic admiration of the flowers caressed his nerves . She stooped down , and touched the trumpets , with infinitely fine and delicate - touching finger - tips . It filled him with ease to see her . When she rose , her eyes , hot with the beauty of the flowers , looked into his . “
112606	112610	112604	112604	they	2524	” she asked . “
112618	112622	112615	112615	I	0	” he answered . “
112630	112631	112623	112623	I	0	” “
112639	113025	112632	112632	They	2524	” she said . They stood together in a false intimacy , a nervous contact . And he was in love with her . She was aware of Mademoiselle standing near , like a little French beetle , observant and calculating . She moved away with Winifred , saying they would go to find Bismarck . Gerald watched them go , looking all the while at the soft , full , still body of Gudrun , in its silky cashmere . How silky and rich and soft her body must be . An excess of appreciation came over his mind , she was the all - desirable , the all - beautiful . He wanted only to come to her , nothing more . He was only this , this being that should come to her , and be given to her . At the same time he was finely and acutely aware of Mademoiselle ’s neat , brittle finality of form . She was like some elegant beetle with thin ankles , perched on her high heels , her glossy black dress perfectly correct , her dark hair done high and admirably . How repulsive her completeness and her finality was ! He loathed her . Yet he did admire her . She was perfectly correct . And it did rather annoy him , that Gudrun came dressed in startling colours , like a macaw , when the family was in mourning . Like a macaw she was ! He watched the lingering way she took her feet from the ground . And her ankles were pale yellow , and her dress a deep blue . Yet it pleased him . It pleased him very much . He felt the challenge in her very attire — she challenged the whole world . And he smiled as to the note of a trumpet . Gudrun and Winifred went through the house to the back , where were the stables and the out - buildings . Everywhere was still and deserted . Mr Crich had gone out for a short drive , the stableman had just led round Gerald ’s horse . The two girls went to the hutch that stood in a corner , and looked at the great black - and - white rabbit . “
113045	113052	113041	113041	he	2525	” she laughed quickly , then added “
113077	113078	113073	113073	you	2527	” “
113085	113089	113080	113080	we	2526	” said Gudrun . “
113101	113118	113095	113095	He	2525	” She looked at Gudrun , her head on one side , in odd calculating mistrust . “
113127	113128	113132	113132	you	2527	” “
113142	113163	113136	113136	he	2525	” They took the key to unlock the door . The rabbit exploded in a wild rush round the hutch . “
113170	113176	113164	113164	He	2525	” cried Winifred in excitement . “
113188	113199	113200	113200	Bismarck	327	” The rabbit tore round the hutch in a hurry . “
113202	113211	113200	113200	Bismarck	327	” cried the child , in rousing excitement . “
113221	113252	113217	113217	You	327	” Winifred looked up at Gudrun with some misgiving in her wild excitement . Gudrun smiled sardonically with her mouth . Winifred made a strange crooning noise of unaccountable excitement . “
113258	113275	113254	113254	he	2525	” she cried , seeing the rabbit settled down in a far corner of the hutch . “
113282	113298	113277	113277	we	2529	” she whispered excitedly , mysteriously , looking up at Gudrun and edging very close . “
113306	113445	113446	113446	Bismarck	327	” she chuckled wickedly to herself . They unlocked the door of the hutch . Gudrun thrust in her arm and seized the great , lusty rabbit as it crouched still , she grasped its long ears . It set its four feet flat , and thrust back . There was a long scraping sound as it was hauled forward , and in another instant it was in mid - air , lunging wildly , its body flying like a spring coiled and released , as it lashed out , suspended from the ears . Gudrun held the black - and - white tempest at arms ’ length , averting her face . But the rabbit was magically strong , it was all she could do to keep her grasp . She almost lost her presence of mind . “
113455	113464	113450	113450	you	327	” said Winifred in a rather frightened voice , “
113476	113593	113472	113472	he	2525	” Gudrun stood for a moment astounded by the thunder - storm that had sprung into being in her grip . Then her colour came up , a heavy rage came over her like a cloud . She stood shaken as a house in a storm , and utterly overcome . Her heart was arrested with fury at the mindlessness and the bestial stupidity of this struggle , her wrists were badly scored by the claws of the beast , a heavy cruelty welled up in her . Gerald came round as she was trying to capture the flying rabbit under her arm . He saw , with subtle recognition , her sullen passion of cruelty . “
113606	113612	113597	113600	one of the men	2530	” he said hurrying up . “
113620	113646	113615	113615	he	2525	” cried Winifred , almost frantic . He held out his nervous , sinewy hand and took the rabbit by the ears , from Gudrun . “
113653	113714	113615	113615	he	2525	” she cried , in a high voice , like the crying a seagull , strange and vindictive . The rabbit made itself into a ball in the air , and lashed out , flinging itself into a bow . It really seemed demoniacal . Gudrun saw Gerald ’s body tighten , saw a sharp blindness come into his eyes . “
113722	113886	113715	113715	I	0	” he said . The long , demon - like beast lashed out again , spread on the air as if it were flying , looking something like a dragon , then closing up again , inconceivably powerful and explosive . The man ’s body , strung to its efforts , vibrated strongly . Then a sudden sharp , white - edged wrath came up in him . Swift as lightning he drew back and brought his free hand down like a hawk on the neck of the rabbit . Simultaneously , there came the unearthly abhorrent scream of a rabbit in the fear of death . It made one immense writhe , tore his wrists and his sleeves in a final convulsion , all its belly flashed white in a whirlwind of paws , and then he had slung it round and had it under his arm , fast . It cowered and skulked . His face was gleaming with a smile . “
113900	113963	113887	113887	You	2533	” he said , looking at Gudrun . And he saw her eyes black as night in her pallid face , she looked almost unearthly . The scream of the rabbit , after the violent tussle , seemed to have torn the veil of her consciousness . He looked at her , and the whitish , electric gleam in his face intensified . “
113971	113976	113964	113964	I	0	” Winifred was crooning . “
113994	114012	113989	113989	He	2534	” A smile twisted Gudrun ’s face , as she recovered . She knew she was revealed . “
114025	114042	114015	114015	they	2535	” she cried , the high note in her voice , like a seagull ’s cry . “
114045	114049	114015	114015	they	2535	” he said . “
114064	114093	114057	114057	he	2534	” Winifred was saying , putting out her hand and touching the rabbit tentatively , as it skulked under his arm , motionless as if it were dead . “
114103	114107	114101	114101	Gerald	255	” she asked . “
114115	114119	114122	114122	he	2534	” he said . “
114125	114146	114122	114122	he	2534	” cried the child , with a sudden flush of amusement . And she touched the rabbit with more confidence . “
114163	114164	114159	114159	He	2534	” “
114171	114175	114167	114167	you	2536	” asked Gerald . “
114182	114286	114167	114167	you	2536	” she said . Gudrun looked at Gerald with strange , darkened eyes , strained with underworld knowledge , almost supplicating , like those of a creature which is at his mercy , yet which is his ultimate victor . He did not know what to say to her . He felt the mutual hellish recognition . And he felt he ought to say something , to cover it . He had the power of lightning in his nerves , she seemed like a soft recipient of his magical , hideous white fire . He was unconfident , he had qualms of fear . “
114292	114296	114288	114288	he	2534	” he asked . “
114299	114303	114288	114288	he	2534	” she said . “
114310	114386	114304	114304	He	2534	” he said , turning his face away . They came to the little court , which was shut in by old red walls in whose crevices wall - flowers were growing . The grass was soft and fine and old , a level floor carpeting the court , the sky was blue overhead . Gerald tossed the rabbit down . It crouched still and would not move . Gudrun watched it with faint horror . “
114393	114397	114304	114304	He	2534	” she cried . “
114402	114422	114304	114304	He	2534	” he said . She looked up at him , and a slight sinister smile contracted her white face . “
114429	114433	114426	114427	a fool	4749	” she cried . “
114441	114495	114437	114439	a sickening fool	2540	” The vindictive mockery in her voice made his brain quiver . Glancing up at him , into his eyes , she revealed again the mocking , white - cruel recognition . There was a league between them , abhorrent to them both . They were implicated with each other in abhorrent mysteries . “
114502	114520	114500	114500	you	2541	” he asked , showing his hard forearm , white and hard and torn in red gashes . “
114525	114535	114500	114500	you	2541	” she cried , flushing with a sinister vision . “
114540	114557	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” She lifted her arm and showed a deep red score down the silken white flesh . “
114562	114648	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” he exclaimed . But it was as if he had had knowledge of her in the long red rent of her forearm , so silken and soft . He did not want to touch her . He would have to make himself touch her , deliberately . The long , shallow red rip seemed torn across his own brain , tearing the surface of his ultimate consciousness , letting through the forever unconscious , unthinkable red ether of the beyond , the obscene beyond . “
114660	114666	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” he asked , solicitous . “
114671	114852	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” she cried . And suddenly the rabbit , which had been crouching as if it were a flower , so still and soft , suddenly burst into life . Round and round the court it went , as if shot from a gun , round and round like a furry meteorite , in a tense hard circle that seemed to bind their brains . They all stood in amazement , smiling uncannily , as if the rabbit were obeying some unknown incantation . Round and round it flew , on the grass under the old red walls like a storm . And then quite suddenly it settled down , hobbled among the grass , and sat considering , its nose twitching like a bit of fluff in the wind . After having considered for a few minutes , a soft bunch with a black , open eye , which perhaps was looking at them , perhaps was not , it hobbled calmly forward and began to nibble the grass with that mean motion of a rabbit ’s quick eating . “
114857	114861	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” said Gudrun . “
114868	114872	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” He laughed . “
114877	114881	114559	114560	a devil	5658	” he said , “
114896	114897	114886	114886	I	0	” “
114905	114909	114900	114900	you	0	” she asked . “
114922	114967	114968	114968	God	167	” There was a queer , faint , obscene smile over his face . She looked at him and saw him , and knew that he was initiate as she was initiate . This thwarted her , and contravened her , for the moment . “
114976	114997	114968	114968	God	167	” she said , in a high , shrill voice . The smile intensified a little , on his face . “
115001	115021	114968	114968	God	167	” he said , looking at her fixedly . Slowly her face relaxed into a smile of obscene recognition . “
115025	115041	114968	114968	God	167	” she said , in a strong , slow , almost man - like way . “
115049	115081	115023	115023	Gerald	255	” Her eyes looked up at him with shocking nonchalance . He felt again as if she had torn him across the breast , dully , finally . He turned aside . “
115088	115109	115111	115112	its mother	2545	” Winifred was softly conjuring the rabbit , and creeping forward to touch it . It hobbled away from her . “
115126	115462	115463	115464	human ”	6336	” After his illness Birkin went to the south of France for a time . He did not write , nobody heard anything of him . Ursula , left alone , felt as if everything were lapsing out . There seemed to be no hope in the world . One was a tiny little rock with the tide of nothingness rising higher and higher She herself was real , and only herself — just like a rock in a wash of flood - water . The rest was all nothingness . She was hard and indifferent , isolated in herself . There was nothing for it now , but contemptuous , resistant indifference . All the world was lapsing into a grey wish - wash of nothingness , she had no contact and no connection anywhere . She despised and detested the whole show . From the bottom of her heart , from the bottom of her soul , she despised and detested people , adult people . She loved only children and animals : children she loved passionately , but coldly . They made her want to hug them , to protect them , to give them life . But this very love , based on pity and despair , was only a bondage and a pain to her . She loved best of all the animals , that were single and unsocial as she herself was . She loved the horses and cows in the field . Each was single and to itself , magical . It was not referred away to some detestable social principle . It was incapable of soulfulness and tragedy , which she detested so profoundly . She could be very pleasant and flattering , almost subservient , to people she met . But no one was taken in . Instinctively each felt her contemptuous mockery of the human being in himself , or herself . She had a profound grudge against the human being . That which the word “
115464	116374	116375	116375	You	2547	” stood for was despicable and repugnant to her . Mostly her heart was closed in this hidden , unconscious strain of contemptuous ridicule . She thought she loved , she thought she was full of love . This was her idea of herself . But the strange brightness of her presence , a marvellous radiance of intrinsic vitality , was a luminousness of supreme repudiation , nothing but repudiation . Yet , at moments , she yielded and softened , she wanted pure love , only pure love . This other , this state of constant unfailing repudiation , was a strain , a suffering also . A terrible desire for pure love overcame her again . She went out one evening , numbed by this constant essential suffering . Those who are timed for destruction must die now . The knowledge of this reached a finality , a finishing in her . And the finality released her . If fate would carry off in death or downfall all those who were timed to go , why need she trouble , why repudiate any further . She was free of it all , she could seek a new union elsewhere . Ursula set off to Willey Green , towards the mill . She came to Willey Water . It was almost full again , after its period of emptiness . Then she turned off through the woods . The night had fallen , it was dark . But she forgot to be afraid , she who had such great sources of fear . Among the trees , far from any human beings , there was a sort of magic peace . The more one could find a pure loneliness , with no taint of people , the better one felt . She was in reality terrified , horrified in her apprehension of people . She started , noticing something on her right hand , between the tree trunks . It was like a great presence , watching her , dodging her . She started violently . It was only the moon , risen through the thin trees . But it seemed so mysterious , with its white and deathly smile . And there was no avoiding it . Night or day , one could not escape the sinister face , triumphant and radiant like this moon , with a high smile . She hurried on , cowering from the white planet . She would just see the pond at the mill before she went home . Not wanting to go through the yard , because of the dogs , she turned off along the hill - side to descend on the pond from above . The moon was transcendent over the bare , open space , she suffered from being exposed to it . There was a glimmer of nightly rabbits across the ground . The night was as clear as crystal , and very still . She could hear a distant coughing of a sheep . So she swerved down to the steep , tree - hidden bank above the pond , where the alders twisted their roots . She was glad to pass into the shade out of the moon . There she stood , at the top of the fallen - away bank , her hand on the rough trunk of a tree , looking at the water , that was perfect in its stillness , floating the moon upon it . But for some reason she disliked it . It did not give her anything . She listened for the hoarse rustle of the sluice . And she wished for something else out of the night , she wanted another night , not this moon - brilliant hardness . She could feel her soul crying out in her , lamenting desolately . She saw a shadow moving by the water . It would be Birkin . He had come back then , unawares . She accepted it without remark , nothing mattered to her . She sat down among the roots of the alder tree , dim and veiled , hearing the sound of the sluice like dew distilling audibly into the night . The islands were dark and half revealed , the reeds were dark also , only some of them had a little frail fire of reflection . A fish leaped secretly , revealing the light in the pond . This fire of the chill night breaking constantly on to the pure darkness , repelled her . She wished it were perfectly dark , perfectly , and noiseless and without motion . Birkin , small and dark also , his hair tinged with moonlight , wandered nearer . He was quite near , and yet he did not exist in her . He did not know she was there . Supposing he did something he would not wish to be seen doing , thinking he was quite private ? But there , what did it matter ? What did the small privacies matter ? How could it matter , what he did ? How can there be any secrets , we are all the same organisms ? How can there be any secrecy , when everything is known to all of us ? He was touching unconsciously the dead husks of flowers as he passed by , and talking disconnectedly to himself . “
116381	116386	116375	116375	You	2547	” he was saying . “
116398	116411	116375	116375	You	2547	” He threw a dead flower - husk on to the water . “
116448	116468	116469	116469	Cybele	330	” He stood still , looking at the water , and throwing upon it the husks of the flowers . “
116491	117458	117459	117459	You	2551	” Ursula wanted to laugh loudly and hysterically , hearing his isolated voice speaking out . It was so ridiculous . He stood staring at the water . Then he stooped and picked up a stone , which he threw sharply at the pond . Ursula was aware of the bright moon leaping and swaying , all distorted , in her eyes . It seemed to shoot out arms of fire like a cuttle - fish , like a luminous polyp , palpitating strongly before her . And his shadow on the border of the pond , was watching for a few moments , then he stooped and groped on the ground . Then again there was a burst of sound , and a burst of brilliant light , the moon had exploded on the water , and was flying asunder in flakes of white and dangerous fire . Rapidly , like white birds , the fires all broken rose across the pond , fleeing in clamorous confusion , battling with the flock of dark waves that were forcing their way in . The furthest waves of light , fleeing out , seemed to be clamouring against the shore for escape , the waves of darkness came in heavily , running under towards the centre . But at the centre , the heart of all , was still a vivid , incandescent quivering of a white moon not quite destroyed , a white body of fire writhing and striving and not even now broken open , not yet violated . It seemed to be drawing itself together with strange , violent pangs , in blind effort . It was getting stronger , it was re - asserting itself , the inviolable moon . And the rays were hastening in in thin lines of light , to return to the strengthened moon , that shook upon the water in triumphant reassumption . Birkin stood and watched , motionless , till the pond was almost calm , the moon was almost serene . Then , satisfied of so much , he looked for more stones . She felt his invisible tenacity . And in a moment again , the broken lights scattered in explosion over her face , dazzling her ; and then , almost immediately , came the second shot . The moon leapt up white and burst through the air . Darts of bright light shot asunder , darkness swept over the centre . There was no moon , only a battlefield of broken lights and shadows , running close together . Shadows , dark and heavy , struck again and again across the place where the heart of the moon had been , obliterating it altogether . The white fragments pulsed up and down , and could not find where to go , apart and brilliant on the water like the petals of a rose that a wind has blown far and wide . Yet again , they were flickering their way to the centre , finding the path blindly , enviously . And again , all was still , as Birkin and Ursula watched . The waters were loud on the shore . He saw the moon regathering itself insidiously , saw the heart of the rose intertwining vigorously and blindly , calling back the scattered fragments , winning home the fragments , in a pulse and in effort of return . And he was not satisfied . Like a madness , he must go on . He got large stones , and threw them , one after the other , at the white - burning centre of the moon , till there was nothing but a rocking of hollow noise , and a pond surged up , no moon any more , only a few broken flakes tangled and glittering broadcast in the darkness , without aim or meaning , a darkened confusion , like a black and white kaleidoscope tossed at random . The hollow night was rocking and crashing with noise , and from the sluice came sharp , regular flashes of sound . Flakes of light appeared here and there , glittering tormented among the shadows , far off , in strange places ; among the dripping shadow of the willow on the island . Birkin stood and listened and was satisfied . Ursula was dazed , her mind was all gone . She felt she had fallen to the ground and was spilled out , like water on the earth . Motionless and spent she remained in the gloom . Though even now she was aware , unseeing , that in the darkness was a little tumult of ebbing flakes of light , a cluster dancing secretly in a round , twining and coming steadily together . They were gathering a heart again , they were coming once more into being . Gradually the fragments caught together re - united , heaving , rocking , dancing , falling back as in panic , but working their way home again persistently , making semblance of fleeing away when they had advanced , but always flickering nearer , a little closer to the mark , the cluster growing mysteriously larger and brighter , as gleam after gleam fell in with the whole , until a ragged rose , a distorted , frayed moon was shaking upon the waters again , re - asserted , renewed , trying to recover from its convulsion , to get over the disfigurement and the agitation , to be whole and composed , at peace . Birkin lingered vaguely by the water . Ursula was afraid that he would stone the moon again . She slipped from her seat and went down to him , saying : “
117472	117473	117470	117470	you	2551	” “
117481	117482	117477	117477	you	2551	” “
117498	117499	117496	117496	you	2551	” “
117516	117520	117505	117505	I	0	” he said . “
117547	117548	117536	117536	It	2553	” “
117553	117566	117536	117536	It	2553	” he said . And they were silent for a few minutes . “
117573	117577	117536	117536	It	2553	” she said . “
117580	117581	117536	117536	It	2553	” “
117588	117589	117584	117584	you	2551	” “
117597	117598	117584	117584	you	2551	” “
117606	117607	117608	117608	I	0	” “
117620	117621	117584	117584	you	2551	” “
117624	117650	117584	117584	you	2551	” Again there was a space of silence . Ursula looked at the moon . It had gathered itself together , and was quivering slightly . “
117661	117665	117584	117584	you	2551	” she asked . “
117688	117689	117683	117683	you	2551	” “
117705	117706	117692	117692	I	0	” “
117710	117716	117717	117717	I	0	” he asked in surprise . “
117727	117728	117717	117717	I	0	” “
117737	117741	117717	117717	I	0	” he said . “
117747	117748	117751	117751	I	0	” “
117763	117818	117756	117756	I	0	” They went and sat down on the roots of the trees , in the shadow . And being silent , he remembered the beauty of her eyes , which were sometimes filled with light , like spring , suffused with wonderful promise . So he said to her , slowly , with difficulty : “
117835	117868	117830	117830	you	2551	” It was as if he had been thinking of this for some time . She was startled , she seemed to leap clear of him . Yet also she was pleased . “
117875	117909	117830	117830	you	2551	” she asked . But he was shy , and did not say any more . So the moment passed for this time . And gradually a feeling of sorrow came over her . “
117915	117919	117910	117910	My	0	” she said . “
117922	117933	117910	117910	My	0	” he answered briefly , not wanting to hear this . “
117946	117956	117935	117935	I	0	” she said . But he did not answer . “
117964	117969	117962	117962	you	0	” she said slowly , “
117990	117991	117992	117992	I	0	” “
118041	118050	118056	118056	you	0	” After a moment ’s silence she replied : “
118093	118123	118079	118079	you	0	” It was a great effort to him to maintain this conversation , and to press for the thing he wanted from her , the surrender of her spirit . “
118128	118132	118079	118079	you	0	” he said . “
118198	118199	118209	118209	You	0	” “
118202	118208	118209	118209	You	0	” she said , pondering . “
118254	118265	118242	118242	you	0	” But this only made him shut off from her . “
118269	118273	118242	118242	you	0	” he said , “
118293	118294	118295	118295	You	0	” “
118302	118306	118295	118295	You	0	” she cried . “
118310	118315	118307	118307	I	0	” he said angrily . “
118320	118426	118317	118317	I	0	” His mind saw again the lovely golden light of spring transfused through her eyes , as through some wonderful window . And he wanted her to be with him there , in this world of proud indifference . But what was the good of telling her he wanted this company in proud indifference . What was the good of talking , any way ? It must happen beyond the sound of words . It was merely ruinous to try to work her by conviction . This was a paradisal bird that could never be netted , it must fly by itself to the heart . “
118466	118480	118481	118481	You	0	” A shiver of rage went over his veins , at this repeated : “
118489	118497	118481	118481	You	0	” All the paradisal disappeared from him . “
118500	118506	118481	118481	You	0	” he said , irritated , “
118567	118568	118563	118565	a rag doll	2557	” “
118571	118577	118563	118565	a rag doll	2557	” she laughed in mockery . “
118601	118617	118618	118618	she	2558	” She rose in anger , to go home . You want the paradisal unknowing , ”
118636	118731	118618	118618	she	2558	“ I know what that means , thank you . You want me to be your thing , never to criticise you or to have anything to say for myself . You want me to be a mere thing for you ! No thank you ! If you want that , there are plenty of women who will give it to you . There are plenty of women who will lie down for you to walk over them — go to them then , if that ’s what you want — go to them . ”
118732	118735	118736	118736	he	2559	“ No , ”
118743	118782	118736	118736	he	2559	“ I want you to drop your assertive will , your frightened apprehensive self - insistence , that is what I want . I want you to trust yourself so implicitly , that you can let yourself go . ”
118783	118788	118789	118789	she	2560	“ Let myself go ! ”
118796	118846	118789	118789	she	2560	“ I can let myself go , easily enough . It is you who ca n’t let yourself go , it is you who hang on to yourself as if it were your only treasure . You — you are the Sunday school teacher — You — you preacher . ”
118863	118877	118878	118878	he	2561	“ I do n’t mean let yourself go in the Dionysic ecstatic way , ”
118881	118940	118878	118878	he	2561	“ I know you can do that . But I hate ecstasy , Dionysic or any other . It ’s like going round in a squirrel cage . I want you not to care about yourself , just to be there and not to care about yourself , not to insist — be glad and sure and indifferent . ”
118941	118945	118946	118946	she	2560	“ Who insists ? ”
118949	118963	118946	118946	she	2560	“ Who is it that keeps on insisting ? It is n’t me ! ”
118982	118986	118987	118987	he	2561	“ I know , ”
118990	119017	118987	118987	he	2561	“ While ever either of us insists to the other , we are all wrong . But there we are , the accord does n’t come . ”
119076	119083	119084	119084	she	2560	“ Do you really love me ? ”
119090	119099	119100	119100	he	2561	“ I call that your war - cry , ”
119105	119108	119109	119109	she	2560	“ Why ! ”
119117	119124	119109	119109	she	2560	“ Your insistence — Your war - cry—“A
119128	119150	119087	119087	He	2561	Brangwen”—an old battle - cry . Yours is , ‘ Do you love me ? Yield knave , or die . ’ ”
119151	119154	119155	119155	she	2560	“ No , ”
119160	119182	119155	119155	she	2560	“ not like that . Not like that . But I must know that you love me , must n’t I ? ”
119183	119195	119087	119087	He	2561	“ Well then , know it and have done with it . ”
119196	119201	119087	119087	He	2561	“ But do you ? ”
119202	119231	119232	119232	She	2560	“ Yes , I do . I love you , and I know it ’s final . It is final , so why say any more about it . ”
119244	119249	119250	119250	she	2560	“ Are you sure ? ”
119259	119274	119250	119250	she	2560	“ Quite sure — so now have done — accept it and have done . ”
119283	119289	119290	119290	she	2560	“ Have done with what ? ”
119295	119299	119300	119300	he	2564	“ With bothering , ”
119465	119475	119476	119476	he	2564	“ But we ’ll be still , shall we ? ”
119479	119482	119483	119483	she	2560	“ Yes , ”
119511	119518	119519	119519	she	2560	“ I must be going home , ”
119522	119529	119530	119530	he	2564	“ Must you — how sad , ”
119545	119551	119552	119552	she	2560	“ Are you really sad ? ”
119557	119560	119561	119561	he	2564	“ Yes , ”
119564	119576	119561	119561	he	2564	“ I wish we could stay as we were , always . ”
119577	119583	119584	119584	she	2560	“ Always ! Do you ? ”
119603	119610	119601	119601	she	2560	“ Kiss me ! Kiss me ! ”
120894	120902	120881	120881	She	331	“ Oh , I ’ll tell father . ”
120950	120953	120955	120955	Brangwen	160	“ Well , ”
120957	120964	120955	120955	Brangwen	160	“ I ’ll get a coat . ”
120989	121013	120974	120974	he	2585	“ You must excuse me , I was just doing a bit of work in the shed . Come inside , will you . ”
121219	121231	121233	121233	Brangwen	160	“ The weather ’s not so bad as it has been , ”
121249	121252	121254	121254	Birkin	169	“ No , ”
121256	121265	121254	121254	Birkin	169	“ It was full moon two days ago . ”
121266	121280	121233	121233	Brangwen	160	“ Oh ! You believe in the moon then , affecting the weather ? ”
121281	121300	121254	121254	Birkin	169	“ No , I do n’t think I do . I do n’t really know enough about it . ”
121301	121329	121254	121254	Birkin	169	“ You know what they say ? The moon and the weather may change together , but the change of the moon wo n’t change the weather . ”
121330	121335	121337	121337	Birkin	169	“ Is that it ? ”
121339	121346	121337	121337	Birkin	169	“ I had n’t heard it . ”
121356	121375	121353	121353	Birkin	169	“ Am I hindering you ? I called to see Ursula , really . Is she at home ? ”
121376	121398	121402	121402	him	2611	“ I do n’t believe she is . I believe she ’s gone to the library . I ’ll just see . ”
121410	121413	121414	121414	he	2611	“ No , ”
121420	121435	121436	121436	Birkin	169	“ But she wo n’t be long . You wanted to speak to her ? ”
121450	121457	121458	121458	he	2611	“ As a matter of fact , ”
121461	121471	121458	121458	he	2611	“ I wanted to ask her to marry me . ”
121488	121493	121494	121494	he	2611	“ O - oh ? ”
121516	121523	121494	121494	he	2611	“ Was she expecting you then ? ”
121524	121527	121529	121529	Birkin	169	“ No , ”
121531	121546	121529	121529	Birkin	169	“ No ? I did n’t know anything of this sort was on foot — ”
121562	121574	121551	121551	Birkin	169	“ I wonder why it should be ‘ on foot ’ ! ”
121579	121588	121576	121576	he	2611	“ No , it ’s perhaps rather sudden . ”
121600	121606	121599	121599	he	2611	added—“but I do n’t know — ”
121607	121616	121618	121618	Brangwen	160	“ Quite sudden , is it ? Oh ! ”
121625	121630	121632	121632	Birkin	169	“ In one way , ”
121634	121640	121632	121632	Birkin	169	“ — not in another . ”
121653	121660	121650	121650	Brangwen	160	“ Well , she pleases herself — ”
121661	121665	121667	121667	Birkin	169	“ Oh yes ! ”
121684	121715	121681	121681	he	2611	“ Though I should n’t want her to be in too big a hurry , either . It ’s no good looking round afterwards , when it ’s too late . ”
121716	121726	121728	121728	Birkin	169	“ Oh , it need never be too late , ”
121730	121737	121728	121728	Birkin	169	“ as far as that goes . ”
121738	121744	121746	121747	the father	646	“ How do you mean ? ”
121749	121763	121765	121765	Birkin	169	“ If one repents being married , the marriage is at an end , ”
121767	121772	121765	121765	Birkin	169	“ You think so ? ”
121773	121776	121728	121728	Birkin	169	“ Yes . ”
121777	121791	121792	121792	Birkin	169	“ Ay , well that may be your way of looking at it . ”
121801	121824	121792	121792	Birkin	169	“ So it may . As for your way of looking at it , William Brangwen , it needs a little explaining . ”
121825	121829	121831	121831	Brangwen	289	“ I suppose , ”
121833	121854	121831	121831	Brangwen	289	“ you know what sort of people we are ? What sort of a bringing - up she ’s had ? ”
121855	121860	121862	121862	Birkin	169	“ ‘ She ’ , ”
121872	121879	121862	121862	Birkin	169	“ is the cat ’s mother . ”
121880	121895	121896	121896	he	646	“ Do I know what sort of a bringing - up she ’s had ? ”
121907	121910	121911	121911	he	646	“ Well , ”
121914	121942	121911	121911	he	646	“ she ’s had everything that ’s right for a girl to have — as far as possible , as far as we could give it her . ”
121943	121950	121952	121952	Birkin	169	“ I ’m sure she has , ”
121981	121996	121997	121997	he	646	“ And I do n’t want to see her going back on it all , ”
122005	122008	122010	122010	Birkin	169	“ Why ? ”
122023	122059	122060	122060	Birkin	169	“ Why ! I do n’t believe in your new - fangled ways and new - fangled ideas — in and out like a frog in a gallipot . It would never do for me . ”
122078	122091	122093	122093	Birkin	169	“ Yes , but are my ways and ideas new - fangled ? ”
122095	122099	122093	122093	Birkin	169	“ Are they ? ”
122105	122115	122116	122116	he	646	“ I ’m not speaking of you in particular , ”
122119	122159	122116	122116	he	646	“ What I mean is that my children have been brought up to think and do according to the religion I was brought up in myself , and I do n’t want to see them going away from that . ”
122166	122172	122174	122174	Birkin	169	“ And beyond that — ? ”
122187	122203	122180	122180	he	646	“ Eh ? What do you mean ? All I want to say is that my daughter”—he
122225	122229	122231	122231	Birkin	169	“ Of course , ”
122233	122252	122231	122231	Birkin	169	“ I do n’t want to hurt anybody or influence anybody . Ursula does exactly as she pleases . ”
122330	122341	122342	122342	he	646	“ And as for beliefs , that ’s one thing , ”
122345	122378	122342	122342	he	646	“ But I ’d rather see my daughters dead tomorrow than that they should be at the beck and call of the first man that likes to come and whistle for them . ”
122389	122394	122395	122395	he	646	“ As to that , ”
122398	122428	122395	122395	he	646	“ I only know that it ’s much more likely that it ’s I who am at the beck and call of the woman , than she at mine . ”
122441	122445	122446	122446	he	646	“ I know , ”
122449	122509	122446	122446	he	646	“ she ’ll please herself — she always has done . I ’ve done my best for them , but that does n’t matter . They ’ve got themselves to please , and if they can help it they ’ll please nobody but themselves . But she ’s a right to consider her mother , and me as well — ”
122517	122554	122513	122513	his	289	“ And I tell you this much , I would rather bury them , than see them getting into a lot of loose ways such as you see everywhere nowadays . I ’d rather bury them — ”
122555	122562	122564	122564	Birkin	169	“ Yes but , you see , ”
122577	122600	122564	122564	Birkin	169	“ they wo n’t give either you or me the chance to bury them , because they ’re not to be buried . ”
122613	122619	122620	122620	he	2627	“ Now , Mr Birkin , ”
122623	122666	122620	122620	he	2627	“ I do n’t know what you ’ve come here for , and I do n’t know what you ’re asking for . But my daughters are my daughters — and it ’s my business to look after them while I can . ”
122692	122701	122702	122702	Brangwen	289	“ I ’ve nothing against your marrying Ursula , ”
122707	122729	122702	122702	Brangwen	289	“ It ’s got nothing to do with me , she ’ll do as she likes , me or no me . ”
123048	123058	123060	123060	Rosalind	331	“ Did you bring me that Girl ’s Own ? ”
123062	123079	123060	123060	Rosalind	331	“ Yes , I brought it . But I forgot which one it was you wanted . ”
123080	123084	123086	123086	Rosalind	331	“ You would , ”
123089	123097	123086	123086	Rosalind	331	“ It ’s right for a wonder . ”
123109	123112	123114	123114	Ursula	255	“ Where ? ”
123139	123142	123133	123133	his	289	“ Ursula . ”
123153	123160	123161	123161	she	2629	“ Oh how do you do ! ”
123221	123228	123229	123229	she	2629	“ Have I interrupted a conversation ? ”
123232	123240	123242	123242	Birkin	169	“ No , only a complete silence , ”
123244	123247	123249	123249	Ursula	255	“ Oh , ”
123287	123300	123302	123303	her father	583	“ Mr Birkin came to speak to you , not to me , ”
123305	123311	123312	123312	she	2629	“ Oh , did he ! ”
123344	123350	123329	123329	she	2629	“ Was it anything special ? ”
123351	123356	123357	123357	he	583	“ I hope so , ”
123362	123374	123376	123377	her father	583	“ — To propose to you , according to all accounts , ”
123379	123382	123384	123384	Ursula	255	“ Oh , ”
123386	123389	123384	123384	Ursula	255	“ Oh , ”
123397	123405	123406	123406	She	2629	“ Have you nothing more to say ? ”
123412	123422	123423	123423	she	2629	“ Did you really come to propose to me ? ”
123435	123438	123439	123439	he	583	“ Yes , ”
123442	123450	123439	123439	he	583	“ I suppose I came to propose . ”
123461	123465	123466	123466	she	2629	“ Did you ? ”
123486	123489	123490	123490	he	583	“ Yes , ”
123493	123507	123490	123490	he	583	“ I wanted to — I wanted you to agree to marry me . ”
123595	123598	123599	123599	she	2629	“ Yes , ”
123685	123693	123694	123694	he	583	“ Well , what do you say ? ”
123716	123725	123713	123713	she	2629	“ I did n’t speak , did I ? ”
123737	123740	123713	123713	she	2629	“ No , ”
123747	123767	123768	123768	She	2629	“ But you need n’t look like an idiot . You ’ve got your wits , have n’t you ? ”
123775	123787	123788	123788	she	2629	“ I ’ve got my wits , what does that mean ? ”
123798	123810	123812	123813	her father	583	“ You heard what was asked you , did n’t you ? ”
123817	123823	123788	123788	she	2629	“ Of course I heard . ”
123824	123833	123835	123836	her father	583	“ Well then , ca n’t you answer ? ”
123838	123843	123835	123836	her father	583	“ Why should I ? ”
123860	123863	123865	123865	Birkin	169	“ No , ”
123873	123890	123865	123865	Birkin	169	“ there ’s no need to answer at once . You can say when you like . ”
123899	123906	123907	123907	she	2629	“ Why should I say anything ? ”
123910	123936	123907	123907	she	2629	“ You do this off your own bat , it has nothing to do with me . Why do you both want to bully me ? ”
123937	123944	123946	123947	her father	583	“ Bully you ! Bully you ! ”
123955	123991	123946	123947	her father	583	“ Bully you ! Why , it ’s a pity you ca n’t be bullied into some sense and decency . Bully you ! You ’ll see to that , you self - willed creature . ”
124026	124033	124034	124034	he	583	“ But none is bullying you , ”
124045	124049	124050	124050	she	2629	“ Oh yes , ”
124053	124063	124034	124034	he	583	“ You both want to force me into something . ”
124064	124072	124073	124073	he	583	“ That is an illusion of yours , ”
124077	124080	124082	124083	her father	583	“ Illusion ! ”
124085	124098	124082	124083	her father	583	“ A self - opinionated fool , that ’s what she is . ”
124104	124116	124099	124099	Birkin	169	“ However , we ’ll leave it for the time being . ”
124129	124136	124137	124138	her father	583	“ You fool ! You fool ! ”
124807	124811	124812	124812	she	2668	“ Of course , ”
124816	124913	124812	124812	she	2668	“ there is a quality of life in Birkin which is quite remarkable . There is an extraordinary rich spring of life in him , really amazing , the way he can give himself to things . But there are so many things in life that he simply does n’t know . Either he is not aware of their existence at all , or he dismisses them as merely negligible — things which are vital to the other person . In a way , he is not clever enough , he is too intense in spots . ”
124914	124917	124919	124919	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
124921	124934	124919	124919	Ursula	255	“ too much of a preacher . He is really a priest . ”
124935	124962	124812	124812	she	2668	“ Exactly ! He ca n’t hear what anybody else has to say — he simply can not hear . His own voice is so loud . ”
124963	124971	124980	124980	Gudrun	160	“ Yes . He cries you down . ”
124972	124978	124980	124980	Gudrun	160	“ He cries you down , ”
124982	125023	124980	124980	Gudrun	160	“ And by mere force of violence . And of course it is hopeless . Nobody is convinced by violence . It makes talking to him impossible — and living with him I should think would be more than impossible . ”
125024	125038	125039	125039	I	0	“ You do n’t think one could live with him ’ asked Ursula . “
125115	125116	125107	125107	I	0	” “
125119	125131	125107	125107	I	0	” assented Ursula vaguely . She only half agreed with Gudrun . “
125136	125140	125107	125107	I	0	” she said , “
125153	125154	125107	125107	I	0	” “
125160	125164	125107	125107	I	0	” said Gudrun . “
125193	125194	125187	125187	him	172	” “
125197	125201	125187	125187	him	172	” said Ursula . “
125208	125209	125202	125202	You	2674	” “
125220	125424	125215	125215	you	2674	” This was all so true , that Ursula felt jarred to the bottom of her soul with ugly distaste . She went on , with the discord jarring and jolting through her , in the most barren of misery . Then there started a revulsion from Gudrun . She finished life off so thoroughly , she made things so ugly and so final . As a matter of fact , even if it were as Gudrun said , about Birkin , other things were true as well . But Gudrun would draw two lines under him and cross him out like an account that is settled . There he was , summed up , paid for , settled , done with . And it was such a lie . This finality of Gudrun ’s , this dispatching of people and things in a sentence , it was all such a lie . Ursula began to revolt from her sister . One day as they were walking along the lane , they saw a robin sitting on the top twig of a bush , singing shrilly . The sisters stood to look at him . An ironical smile flickered on Gudrun ’s face . “
125431	125435	125215	125215	you	2674	” smiled Gudrun . “
125440	125450	125438	125438	he	2676	” exclaimed Ursula , with a little ironical grimace . “
125462	125463	125454	125460	a little Lloyd George of the air	2677	” “
125482	125575	125454	125460	a little Lloyd George of the air	2677	” cried Gudrun in delight . Then for days , Ursula saw the persistent , obtrusive birds as stout , short politicians lifting up their voices from the platform , little men who must make themselves heard at any cost . But even from this there came the revulsion . Some yellowhammers suddenly shot along the road in front of her . And they looked to her so uncanny and inhuman , like flaring yellow barbs shooting through the air on some weird , living errand , that she said to herself : “
125680	126171	125678	125678	God	167	” It seemed to her irreverence , destructive of all true life , to make little Lloyd Georges of the birds . It was such a lie towards the robins , and such a defamation . Yet she had done it herself . But under Gudrun ’s influence : so she exonerated herself . So she withdrew away from Gudrun and from that which she stood for , she turned in spirit towards Birkin again . She had not seen him since the fiasco of his proposal . She did not want to , because she did not want the question of her acceptance thrust upon her . She knew what Birkin meant when he asked her to marry him ; vaguely , without putting it into speech , she knew . She knew what kind of love , what kind of surrender he wanted . And she was not at all sure that this was the kind of love that she herself wanted . She was not at all sure that it was this mutual unison in separateness that she wanted . She wanted unspeakable intimacies . She wanted to have him , utterly , finally to have him as her own , oh , so unspeakably , in intimacy . To drink him down — ah , like a life - draught . She made great professions , to herself , of her willingness to warm his foot - soles between her breasts , after the fashion of the nauseous Meredith poem . But only on condition that he , her lover , loved her absolutely , with complete self - abandon . And subtly enough , she knew he would never abandon himself finally to her . He did not believe in final self - abandonment . He said it openly . It was his challenge . She was prepared to fight him for it . For she believed in an absolute surrender to love . She believed that love far surpassed the individual . He said the individual was more than love , or than any relationship . For him , the bright , single soul accepted love as one of its conditions , a condition of its own equilibrium . She believed that love was everything . Man must render himself up to her . He must be quaffed to the dregs by her . Let him be her man utterly , and she in return would be his humble slave — whether she wanted it or not . After the fiasco of the proposal , Birkin had hurried blindly away from Beldover , in a whirl of fury . He felt he had been a complete fool , that the whole scene had been a farce of the first water . But that did not trouble him at all . He was deeply , mockingly angry that Ursula persisted always in this old cry : “
126180	126501	126174	126174	you	2685	” and in her bright , insolent abstraction . He went straight to Shortlands . There he found Gerald standing with his back to the fire , in the library , as motionless as a man is , who is completely and emptily restless , utterly hollow . He had done all the work he wanted to do — and now there was nothing . He could go out in the car , he could run to town . But he did not want to go out in the car , he did not want to run to town , he did not want to call on the Thirlbys . He was suspended motionless , in an agony of inertia , like a machine that is without power . This was very bitter to Gerald , who had never known what boredom was , who had gone from activity to activity , never at a loss . Now , gradually , everything seemed to be stopping in him . He did not want any more to do the things that offered . Something dead within him just refused to respond to any suggestion . He cast over in his mind , what it would be possible to do , to save himself from this misery of nothingness , relieve the stress of this hollowness . And there were only three things left , that would rouse him , make him live . One was to drink or smoke hashish , the other was to be soothed by Birkin , and the third was women . And there was no one for the moment to drink with . Nor was there a woman . And he knew Birkin was out . So there was nothing to do but to bear the stress of his own emptiness . When he saw Birkin his face lit up in a sudden , wonderful smile . “
126507	126511	126505	126505	Rupert	169	” he said , “
126541	126575	126537	126539	the right somebody	2689	” The smile in his eyes was very astonishing , as he looked at the other man . It was the pure gleam of relief . His face was pallid and even haggard . “
126585	126590	126576	126578	The right woman	2690	” said Birkin spitefully . “
126604	126619	126600	126602	an amusing man	2691	” He laughed as he said it . Birkin sat down near the fire . “
126625	126629	126630	126630	I	0	” he asked . “
126673	126674	126675	126675	You	0	” “
126681	126682	126683	126683	Bored	336	” “
126711	126721	126697	126697	I	0	” Birkin glanced up and looked in his eyes . “
126728	126735	126722	126722	You	0	” he said . Gerald smiled . “
126738	126742	126722	126722	You	0	” he said . “
126752	126753	126793	126793	God	167	” “
126756	126781	126793	126793	God	167	” said Birkin , in his soft voice . There was a long pause during which each could feel the presence of the other . “
126787	126791	126793	126793	God	167	” said Birkin . “
126803	126804	126805	126807	Some old Johnny	2693	” “
126823	126827	126805	126807	Some old Johnny	2693	” said Birkin . “
126832	126836	126805	126807	Some old Johnny	2693	” said Gerald . “
126878	126879	126909	126909	they	2696	” “
126884	126888	126909	126909	they	2696	” said Birkin . “
126894	126898	126909	126909	they	2696	” said Gerald . “
126906	126907	126909	126909	they	2696	” “
126915	126916	126909	126909	they	2696	” “
126921	126925	126918	126918	you	0	” said Gerald . “
126930	126934	126927	126927	you	0	” said Birkin . “
126941	126998	126935	126935	I	0	” replied Gerald . He took his hands out of his trousers pockets , and reached for a cigarette . He was tense and nervous . He lit the cigarette over a lamp , reaching forward and drawing steadily . He was dressed for dinner , as usual in the evening , although he was alone . “
127009	127013	126935	126935	I	0	” said Birkin . “
127026	127027	127021	127021	You	0	” “
127033	127037	127030	127030	I	0	” said Gerald . “
127046	127047	127039	127039	you	0	” “
127057	127061	127050	127050	I	0	” said Birkin . “
127064	127078	127050	127050	I	0	” Gerald lifted his head and blew the smoke slowly into the air . “
127081	127085	127088	127088	I	0	” said Birkin . “
127113	127114	127118	127118	you	0	” “
127125	127129	127118	127118	you	0	” said Birkin . “
127147	127148	127118	127118	you	0	” “
127151	127203	127204	127204	I	0	” said Birkin , bitingly . Gerald stood leaning back against the mantel - piece . He looked down at Birkin , and his eyes flashed with a sort of terror like the eyes of a stallion , that are bloodshot and overwrought , turned glancing backwards in a stiff terror . “
127222	127226	127214	127214	I	0	” he said . “
127232	127260	127261	127261	I	0	” said Birkin coldly . Gerald listened with quick impatience . He kept glancing down at Birkin , as if looking for something from the other man . “
127269	127273	127261	127261	I	0	” said Birkin . “
127302	127303	127304	127304	You	0	” “
127307	127311	127304	127304	You	0	” exclaimed Gerald . “
127334	127335	127325	127325	You	0	” “
127353	127354	127355	127355	They	2700	” “
127368	127369	127370	127370	I	0	” “
127382	127386	127387	127387	You	0	” said Birkin . “
127390	127408	127387	127387	You	0	” A queer , smiling look tightened Gerald ’s face for a moment , as he said , “
127418	127419	127411	127411	I	0	” “
127439	127440	127429	127429	you	0	” “
127455	127467	127429	127429	you	0	” He rang the bell , and waited for the butler . “
127477	127484	127429	127429	you	0	” he said to the man , “
127500	127514	127497	127498	anybody else	1074	” The man went . Gerald turned to Birkin with his eyes lighted . “
127524	127528	127516	127516	you	0	” he said . “
127533	127534	127530	127530	you	0	” “
127537	127538	127539	127539	You	0	” “
127552	127553	127544	127544	he	2703	” “
127609	127613	127614	127614	I	0	” Gerald nodded . “
127619	127623	127614	127614	I	0	” he said , “
127635	127636	127629	127629	They	2706	” “
127682	127683	127754	127754	I.	0	” “
127690	127702	127754	127754	I.	0	” The man brought in the tray and set it down . “
127710	127718	127754	127754	I.	0	” said Gerald . The door closed . “
127722	127726	127754	127754	I.	0	” said Gerald ; “
127740	127741	127734	127734	you	2703	” “
127750	127751	127744	127744	I	0	” “
127755	127844	127754	127754	I.	0	” Gerald fastened the door and pushed the furniture aside . The room was large , there was plenty of space , it was thickly carpeted . Then he quickly threw off his clothes , and waited for Birkin . The latter , white and thin , came over to him . Birkin was more a presence than a visible object , Gerald was aware of him completely , but not really visually . Whereas Gerald himself was concrete and noticeable , a piece of pure final substance . “
127847	127851	127754	127754	I.	0	” said Birkin , “
127872	127916	127865	127865	You	2703	” And his hands closed on the naked body of the other man . In another moment , he had Gerald swung over lightly and balanced against his knee , head downwards . Relaxed , Gerald sprang to his feet with eyes glittering . “
127921	127925	127865	127865	You	2703	” he said . “
127930	128875	127865	127865	You	2703	” So the two men began to struggle together . They were very dissimilar . Birkin was tall and narrow , his bones were very thin and fine . Gerald was much heavier and more plastic . His bones were strong and round , his limbs were rounded , all his contours were beautifully and fully moulded . He seemed to stand with a proper , rich weight on the face of the earth , whilst Birkin seemed to have the centre of gravitation in his own middle . And Gerald had a rich , frictional kind of strength , rather mechanical , but sudden and invincible , whereas Birkin was abstract as to be almost intangible . He impinged invisibly upon the other man , scarcely seeming to touch him , like a garment , and then suddenly piercing in a tense fine grip that seemed to penetrate into the very quick of Gerald ’s being . They stopped , they discussed methods , they practised grips and throws , they became accustomed to each other , to each other ’s rhythm , they got a kind of mutual physical understanding . And then again they had a real struggle . They seemed to drive their white flesh deeper and deeper against each other , as if they would break into a oneness . Birkin had a great subtle energy , that would press upon the other man with an uncanny force , weigh him like a spell put upon him . Then it would pass , and Gerald would heave free , with white , heaving , dazzling movements . So the two men entwined and wrestled with each other , working nearer and nearer . Both were white and clear , but Gerald flushed smart red where he was touched , and Birkin remained white and tense . He seemed to penetrate into Gerald ’s more solid , more diffuse bulk , to interfuse his body through the body of the other , as if to bring it subtly into subjection , always seizing with some rapid necromantic fore - knowledge every motion of the other flesh , converting and counteracting it , playing upon the limbs and trunk of Gerald like some hard wind . It was as if Birkin ’s whole physical intelligence interpenetrated into Gerald ’s body , as if his fine , sublimated energy entered into the flesh of the fuller man , like some potency , casting a fine net , a prison , through the muscles into the very depths of Gerald ’s physical being . So they wrestled swiftly , rapturously , intent and mindless at last , two essential white figures working into a tighter closer oneness of struggle , with a strange , octopus - like knotting and flashing of limbs in the subdued light of the room ; a tense white knot of flesh gripped in silence between the walls of old brown books . Now and again came a sharp gasp of breath , or a sound like a sigh , then the rapid thudding of movement on the thickly - carpeted floor , then the strange sound of flesh escaping under flesh . Often , in the white interlaced knot of violent living being that swayed silently , there was no head to be seen , only the swift , tight limbs , the solid white backs , the physical junction of two bodies clinched into oneness . Then would appear the gleaming , ruffled head of Gerald , as the struggle changed , then for a moment the dun - coloured , shadow - like head of the other man would lift up from the conflict , the eyes wide and dreadful and sightless . At length Gerald lay back inert on the carpet , his breast rising in great slow panting , whilst Birkin kneeled over him , almost unconscious . Birkin was much more exhausted . He caught little , short breaths , he could scarcely breathe any more . The earth seemed to tilt and sway , and a complete darkness was coming over his mind . He did not know what happened . He slid forward quite unconscious , over Gerald , and Gerald did not notice . Then he was half - conscious again , aware only of the strange tilting and sliding of the world . The world was sliding , everything was sliding off into the darkness . And he was sliding , endlessly , endlessly away . He came to consciousness again , hearing an immense knocking outside . What could be happening , what was it , the great hammer - stroke resounding through the house ? He did not know . And then it came to him that it was his own heart beating . But that seemed impossible , the noise was outside . No , it was inside himself , it was his own heart . And the beating was painful , so strained , surcharged . He wondered if Gerald heard it . He did not know whether he were standing or lying or falling . When he realised that he had fallen prostrate upon Gerald ’s body he wondered , he was surprised . But he sat up , steadying himself with his hand and waiting for his heart to become stiller and less painful . It hurt very much , and took away his consciousness . Gerald however was still less conscious than Birkin . They waited dimly , in a sort of not - being , for many uncounted , unknown minutes . “
128879	128883	127865	127865	You	2703	” panted Gerald , “
128904	128984	128985	128985	I	0	” Birkin heard the sound as if his own spirit stood behind him , outside him , and listened to it . His body was in a trance of exhaustion , his spirit heard thinly . His body could not answer . Only he knew his heart was getting quieter . He was divided entirely between his spirit , which stood outside , and knew , and his body , that was a plunging , unconscious stroke of blood . “
128994	128998	128985	128985	I	0	” panted Gerald . “
129006	129007	129000	129000	you	2709	” “
129010	129026	129000	129000	you	2709	” said Birkin , hardening his throat and producing the words in the tension there , “
129041	129057	129034	129034	you	2709	” Then he relaxed again to the terrible plunging of his heart and his blood . “
129062	129066	129034	129034	you	2709	” panted Gerald , “
129076	129077	129034	129034	you	2709	” “
129082	129317	129034	129034	you	2709	” said Birkin . He still heard as if it were his own disembodied spirit hearing , standing at some distance behind him . It drew nearer however , his spirit . And the violent striking of blood in his chest was sinking quieter , allowing his mind to come back . He realised that he was leaning with all his weight on the soft body of the other man . It startled him , because he thought he had withdrawn . He recovered himself , and sat up . But he was still vague and unestablished . He put out his hand to steady himself . It touched the hand of Gerald , that was lying out on the floor . And Gerald ’s hand closed warm and sudden over Birkin ’s , they remained exhausted and breathless , the one hand clasped closely over the other . It was Birkin whose hand , in swift response , had closed in a strong , warm clasp over the hand of the other . Gerald ’s clasp had been sudden and momentaneous . The normal consciousness however was returning , ebbing back . Birkin could breathe almost naturally again . Gerald ’s hand slowly withdrew , Birkin slowly , dazedly rose to his feet and went towards the table . He poured out a whiskey and soda . Gerald also came for a drink . “
129330	129341	129034	129034	you	2709	” said Birkin , looking at Gerald with darkened eyes . “
129346	129364	129034	129034	you	2709	” said Gerald . He looked at the delicate body of the other man , and added : “
129376	129377	129034	129034	you	2709	” “
129396	129397	129391	129391	It	2712	” “
129403	129404	129405	129405	I	0	” “
129412	129413	129410	129410	you	2710	” “
129416	129443	129410	129410	you	2710	” said Gerald . There were long spaces of silence between their words . The wrestling had some deep meaning to them — an unfinished meaning . “
129467	129468	129410	129410	you	2710	” “
129473	129484	129410	129410	you	2710	” said Gerald . Then he laughed pleasantly , adding : “
129492	129500	129410	129410	you	2710	” He stretched out his arms handsomely . “
129503	129507	129410	129410	you	2710	” said Birkin . “
129520	129521	129518	129518	oneself	4646	” “
129524	129532	129518	129518	oneself	4646	” The two men began to dress . “
129541	129547	129537	129537	you	0	” said Birkin to Gerald , “
129561	129562	129563	129563	You	0	” “
129576	129584	129563	129563	You	0	” asked Gerald , his eyes glistening . “
129623	129633	129618	129618	We	2716	” Gerald laughed in his throat , and said : “
129667	129668	129672	129672	you	0	” “
129678	129679	129672	129672	you	0	” “
129685	129689	129672	129672	you	0	” laughed Gerald . “
129709	129710	129706	129706	we	2716	” “
129713	129733	129706	129706	we	2716	” said Gerald . They drew to the fire , with the decanters and the glasses and the food . “
129745	129749	129740	129740	I	0	” said Gerald . “
129754	129755	129750	129750	I	0	” “
129763	129767	129756	129756	I	0	” said Birkin . “
129788	129837	129779	129779	I	0	” Birkin remained alone , looking at the fire . His mind had reverted to Ursula . She seemed to return again into his consciousness . Gerald came down wearing a gown of broad - barred , thick black - and - green silk , brilliant and striking . “
129843	129853	129838	129838	You	0	” said Birkin , looking at the full robe . “
129861	129865	129866	129866	I	0	” said Gerald . “
129870	129871	129866	129866	I	0	” “
129877	129935	129872	129872	I	0	” Birkin was silent , thinking how scrupulous Gerald was in his attire , how expensive too . He wore silk socks , and studs of fine workmanship , and silk underclothing , and silk braces . Curious ! This was another of the differences between them . Birkin was careless and unimaginative about his own appearance . “
129940	129951	129872	129872	I	0	” said Gerald , as if he had been thinking ; “
129975	130065	130067	130067	you	0	” Birkin laughed . He was looking at the handsome figure of the other man , blond and comely in the rich robe , and he was half thinking of the difference between it and himself — so different ; as far , perhaps , apart as man from woman , yet in another direction . But really it was Ursula , it was the woman who was gaining ascendance over Birkin ’s being , at this moment . Gerald was becoming dim again , lapsing out of him . “
130070	130075	130067	130067	you	0	” he said suddenly , “
130091	130104	130105	130105	You	0	” He saw the blank shining wonder come over Gerald ’s face . “
130108	130109	130105	130105	You	0	” “
130138	130152	130153	130153	You	0	” Gerald only stared in wonder , as if he did not grasp . “
130173	130174	130160	130160	you	0	” “
130177	130181	130182	130182	I	0	” said Birkin , “
130185	130186	130182	130182	I	0	” “
130200	130201	130190	130190	you	0	” “
130235	130236	130230	130230	I	0	” “
130243	130247	130248	130248	Ye	2725	” concluded Gerald . “
130254	130255	130248	130248	Ye	2725	” “
130264	130265	130257	130257	you	0	” “
130282	130283	130268	130268	She	2719	” “
130300	130301	130290	130290	she	2719	” “
130315	130316	130317	130317	She	2719	” “
130320	130321	130323	130323	she	2719	” “
130333	130334	130352	130352	she	2719	” “
130357	130363	130352	130352	she	2719	” Birkin raised his shoulders . “
130368	130372	130352	130352	she	2719	” he answered . “
130385	130386	130382	130382	I	0	” “
130400	130401	130396	130396	you	0	” “
130412	130413	130402	130402	I	0	” “
130419	130420	130414	130414	You	0	” “
130423	130438	130414	130414	You	0	” Gerald stared in amazement and amusement . He could not take it in . “
130451	130452	130446	130446	you	0	” “
130457	130458	130446	130446	you	0	” “
130462	130476	130446	130446	you	0	” He leaned back in his chair , filled with delight and amusement . “
130483	130487	130446	130446	you	0	” he said . “
130503	130504	130501	130501	you	0	” “
130508	130512	130506	130506	I	0	” said Birkin . “
130527	130537	130524	130524	you	0	” Now Birkin could not follow Gerald ’s meaning . “
130545	130549	130550	130550	You	0	” said Gerald . “
130563	130564	130550	130550	You	0	” “
130596	130602	130585	130585	I	0	” Gerald watched him steadily . “
130611	130615	130604	130604	you	0	” he asked . “
130623	130669	130621	130621	her	2731	” said Birkin , his face going very still and fixed . Gerald glistened for a moment with pleasure , as if it were something done specially to please him . Then his face assumed a fitting gravity , and he nodded his head slowly . “
130673	130677	130621	130621	her	2731	” he said , “
130695	130696	130690	130690	one	4646	” “
130702	130706	130697	130697	I	0	” said Birkin . “
130710	130720	130697	130697	I	0	” said Gerald . Then , after a pause , “
130787	130788	130784	130784	I	0	” “
130801	130802	130808	130808	you	0	” “
130824	130846	130847	130847	I	0	” He put his hand to his breast , closing his fist there , as if he would draw something out . “
130865	130866	130861	130861	I	0	” “
130873	130877	130878	130878	You	0	” asked Birkin . “
130905	130913	130889	130889	I	0	” His eyes were bright and puzzled . “
130927	130943	130916	130916	you	0	” he said , anxiously . Birkin looked at him , and shook his head . “
130949	130953	130944	130944	I	0	” he said . “
130959	130981	130954	130954	I	0	” Gerald had been on the qui vive , as awaiting his fate . Now he drew back in his chair . “
130984	130988	130992	130992	I	0	” he said , “
130998	130999	130997	130997	I.	0	” “
131008	131012	131013	131013	I	0	” said Birkin . “
131020	131021	131013	131013	I	0	” “
131024	131028	131013	131013	I	0	” said Gerald , “
131044	131045	131034	131034	I	0	” “
131054	131055	131047	131047	you	0	” “
131067	131068	131069	131069	You	0	” “
131073	131074	131069	131069	You	0	” “
131081	131088	131077	131077	I	0	” There was a long pause . “
131096	131100	131077	131077	I	0	” said Birkin . “
131108	131109	131077	131077	I	0	” “
131151	131169	131135	131135	I	0	” he paused , and a blank , barren look passed over his face , to express his feeling—“so
131196	131197	131190	131190	I	0	” “
131200	131204	131205	131205	We	2741	” said Birkin . “
131224	131225	131222	131222	you	0	” “
131231	131287	131205	131205	We	2741	” Gudrun was away in London , having a little show of her work , with a friend , and looking round , preparing for flight from Beldover . Come what might she would be on the wing in a very short time . She received a letter from Winifred Crich , ornamented with drawings . “
131504	131604	131605	131605	Father	185	“ Dear Miss Brangwen , are you coming back soon , you are very much missed here . I enclose a drawing of father sitting up in bed . He says he hopes you are not going to forsake us . Oh dear Miss Brangwen , I am sure you wo n’t . Do come back and draw the ferrets , they are the most lovely noble darlings in the world . We might carve them in holly - wood , playing against a background of green leaves . Oh do let us , for they are most beautiful . “
131730	131900	131709	131709	Gerald	255	” Gudrun caught the drift of the family intentions , in this letter . Gerald wanted her to be attached to the household at Shortlands , he was using Winifred as his stalking - horse . The father thought only of his child , he saw a rock of salvation in Gudrun . And Gudrun admired him for his perspicacity . The child , moreover , was really exceptional . Gudrun was quite content . She was quite willing , given a studio , to spend her days at Shortlands . She disliked the Grammar School already thoroughly , she wanted to be free . If a studio were provided , she would be free to go on with her work , she would await the turn of events with complete serenity . And she was really interested in Winifred , she would be quite glad to understand the girl . So there was quite a little festivity on Winifred ’s account , the day Gudrun returned to Shortlands . “
131917	131925	131901	131901	You	2763	” Gerald said smiling to his sister . “
131929	131933	131709	131709	Gerald	255	” cried Winifred , “
131938	131939	131901	131901	You	2763	” “
131953	131954	131709	131709	Gerald	255	” “
131961	132182	132183	132183	Daddie	323	” protested Winifred , with all the extreme mauvaise honte of her years . Nevertheless , the idea appealed to her . She wanted very much to carry it out . She flitted round the green - houses and the conservatory looking wistfully at the flowers on their stems . And the more she looked , the more she longed to have a bunch of the blossoms she saw , the more fascinated she became with her little vision of ceremony , and the more consumedly shy and self - conscious she grew , till she was almost beside herself . She could not get the idea out of her mind . It was as if some haunting challenge prompted her , and she had not enough courage to take it up . So again she drifted into the green - houses , looking at the lovely roses in their pots , and at the virginal cyclamens , and at the mystic white clusters of a creeper . The beauty , oh the beauty of them , and oh the paradisal bliss , if she should have a perfect bouquet and could give it to Gudrun the next day . Her passion and her complete indecision almost made her ill . At last she slid to her father ’s side . “
132185	132189	132183	132183	Daddie	323	” she said . “
132195	132234	132183	132183	Daddie	323	” But she hung back , the tears almost coming to her eyes , in her sensitive confusion . Her father looked at her , and his heart ran hot with tenderness , an anguish of poignant love . “
132247	132248	132249	132249	Daddie	323	” “
132252	132256	132249	132249	Daddie	323	” her eyes smiled laconically—“isn’t
132270	132292	132260	132260	I	0	” The sick man looked at the bright , knowing eyes of his child , and his heart burned with love . “
132310	132339	132305	132305	they	2767	” This was not very reassuring to Winifred . She half suspected that queens in themselves were a silliness . Yet she so wanted her little romantic occasion . “
132344	132348	132341	132341	I	0	” she asked . “
132371	132391	132361	132361	I	0	” The child smiled a small , subtle , unconscious smile to herself , in anticipation of her way . “
132401	132405	132393	132393	I	0	” she said . “
132418	132474	132413	132413	me	0	” Winifred silently kissed the sick man , and drifted out of the room . She again went the round of the green - houses and the conservatory , informing the gardener , in her high , peremptory , simple fashion , of what she wanted , telling him all the blooms she had selected . “
132482	132486	132477	132477	you	339	” Wilson asked . “
132491	132503	132487	132487	I	0	” she said . She wished servants did not ask questions . “
132531	132532	132533	132533	I	0	” “
132541	132542	132533	132533	I	0	” “
132555	132556	132551	132553	Duchess of Portland	2769	” “
132559	132560	132564	132564	her	2769	” “
132588	132589	132576	132576	you	339	” “
132600	132601	132602	132602	You	339	” “
132614	132861	132862	132862	We	2770	” The next day Winifred , in a dress of silvery velvet , and holding a gaudy bunch of flowers in her hand , waited with keen impatience in the schoolroom , looking down the drive for Gudrun ’s arrival . It was a wet morning . Under her nose was the strange fragrance of hot - house flowers , the bunch was like a little fire to her , she seemed to have a strange new fire in her heart . This slight sense of romance stirred her like an intoxicant . At last she saw Gudrun coming , and she ran downstairs to warn her father and Gerald . They , laughing at her anxiety and gravity , came with her into the hall . The man - servant came hastening to the door , and there he was , relieving Gudrun of her umbrella , and then of her raincoat . The welcoming party hung back till their visitor entered the hall . Gudrun was flushed with the rain , her hair was blown in loose little curls , she was like a flower just opened in the rain , the heart of the blossom just newly visible , seeming to emit a warmth of retained sunshine . Gerald winced in spirit , seeing her so beautiful and unknown . She was wearing a soft blue dress , and her stockings were of dark red . Winifred advanced with odd , stately formality . “
132871	132875	132862	132862	We	2770	” she said . “
132881	132887	132888	132888	Mine	2772	” She presented the bouquet . “
132890	133019	132888	132888	Mine	2772	” cried Gudrun . She was suspended for a moment , then a vivid flush went over her , she was as if blinded for a moment with a flame of pleasure . Then her eyes , strange and flaming , lifted and looked at the father , and at Gerald . And again Gerald shrank in spirit , as if it would be more than he could bear , as her hot , exposed eyes rested on him . There was something so revealed , she was revealed beyond bearing , to his eyes . He turned his face aside . And he felt he would not be able to avert her . And he writhed under the imprisonment . Gudrun put her face into the flowers . “
133026	133063	132888	132888	Mine	2772	” she said , in a muffled voice . Then , with a strange , suddenly revealed passion , she stooped and kissed Winifred . Mr Crich went forward with his hand held out to her . “
133076	133096	133067	133067	you	2773	” he said , playfully . Gudrun looked up at him with a luminous , roguish , unknown face . “
133099	133103	133067	133067	you	2773	” she replied . “
133115	133139	133106	133106	I	0	” Her voice seemed to imply that she was glad to get back to Shortlands , her tone was warm and subtly caressing . “
133146	133151	133152	133152	You	2773	” smiled the father . “
133162	133189	133154	133154	you	2773	” Gudrun only looked into his face with dark - blue , warm , shy eyes . She was unconsciously carried away by her own power . “
133203	133212	133191	133191	you	2773	” Mr Crich continued , holding her hand . “
133215	133222	133191	133191	you	2773	” she said , glowing strangely . “
133234	133235	133230	133230	I	0	” “
133264	133265	133262	133262	Gerald	255	” “
133272	133281	133266	133266	You	2773	” said Gerald to her , shaking hands . “
133287	133288	133283	133283	you	2773	” “
133291	133295	133283	133283	you	2773	” she said , “
133299	133300	133283	133283	you	2773	” “
133305	133335	133336	133336	Winifred	297	” he said . She wondered what he meant . But she was all aglow with her reception , carried away by this little flattering ceremonial on her behalf . “
133338	133343	133336	133336	Winifred	297	” said the father , “
133361	133372	133354	133354	You	2773	” Gudrun went out with her bouquet in her hand . “
133379	133391	133374	133377	a remarkable young woman	2776	” said the father to Gerald , when she had gone . “
133394	133648	133374	133377	a remarkable young woman	2776	” replied Gerald briefly , as if he did not like the observation . Mr Crich liked Gudrun to sit with him for half an hour . Usually he was ashy and wretched , with all the life gnawed out of him . But as soon as he rallied , he liked to make believe that he was just as before , quite well and in the midst of life — not of the outer world , but in the midst of a strong essential life . And to this belief , Gudrun contributed perfectly . With her , he could get by stimulation those precious half - hours of strength and exaltation and pure freedom , when he seemed to live more than he had ever lived . She came to him as he lay propped up in the library . His face was like yellow wax , his eyes darkened , as it were sightless . His black beard , now streaked with grey , seemed to spring out of the waxy flesh of a corpse . Yet the atmosphere about him was energetic and playful . Gudrun subscribed to this , perfectly . To her fancy , he was just an ordinary man . Only his rather terrible appearance was photographed upon her soul , away beneath her consciousness . She knew that , in spite of his playfulness , his eyes could not change from their darkened vacancy , they were the eyes of a man who is dead . “
133656	133673	133674	133674	Thomas	164	” he said , suddenly rousing as she entered , announced by the man - servant . “
133687	133707	133677	133678	Miss Brangwen	338	” He looked at her soft , fresh face with pleasure . It gave him the illusion of life . “
133726	133727	133724	133724	Thomas	164	” “
133732	133790	133730	133730	you	164	” said Gudrun . And as soon as she had said it , her heart sank horribly . The sick man seemed to fall into a gap of death , at her contradiction . She ought to play up to him , not to contravene him . In an instant she was smiling her rather roguish smile . “
133799	133803	133730	133730	you	164	” she said . “
133811	133821	133805	133805	I	0	” The sick man caught at this straw instantly . “
133839	133840	133837	133837	Thomas	164	” “
133846	133847	133848	133848	I	0	” “
133854	133865	133866	133866	You	164	” said Gudrun , looking at the sick man confidingly . “
133884	133885	133871	133871	Thomas	164	” “
133889	133904	133871	133871	Thomas	164	” said Gudrun . She did not want anything , but she was wise . “
133907	133927	133871	133871	Thomas	164	” He waited till she was settled with her little glass and her biscuit . Then he was satisfied . “
133934	133941	133928	133928	You	0	” he said with some excitement , “
133952	133953	133928	133928	You	0	” “
133956	133964	133928	133928	You	0	” exclaimed Gudrun , in mock wonder . “
133977	133978	133967	133967	Winnie	297	” “
133998	134013	133993	133993	her	341	” Gudrun smiled subtly , indulgently . The sick man smiled also , elated . “
134049	134050	134039	134039	We	2781	” “
134058	134074	134075	134075	You	164	” cried Gudrun , with excited warmth . The thought of the rafters stirred her . “
134087	134088	134075	134075	You	164	” “
134131	134132	134123	134123	one	4646	” “
134152	134153	134150	134150	Winifred	297	” “
134159	134180	134155	134155	you	164	” Gudrun knew all these things already , but she must look shy and very grateful , as if overcome . “
134227	134269	134293	134293	you	164	” He looked at Gudrun with dark , vacant eyes . She looked back at him as if full of gratitude . These phrases of a dying man were so complete and natural , coming like echoes through his dead mouth . “
134305	134306	134295	134295	I	0	” “
134309	134313	134295	134295	I	0	” said Gudrun , “
134334	134335	134331	134331	I	0	” “
134338	134348	134331	134331	I	0	” he said , pleased to be the benefactor , “
134365	134366	134356	134356	You	0	” “
134376	134380	134381	134381	I	0	” said Gudrun , “
134388	134389	134381	134381	I	0	” “
134394	134455	134381	134381	I	0	” He was really very pleased . But already he was getting tired . She could see the grey , awful semi - consciousness of mere pain and dissolution coming over him again , the torture coming into the vacancy of his darkened eyes . It was not over yet , this process of death . She rose softly saying : “
134467	134899	134461	134461	I	0	” She went out , telling the nurse that she had left him . Day by day the tissue of the sick man was further and further reduced , nearer and nearer the process came , towards the last knot which held the human being in its unity . But this knot was hard and unrelaxed , the will of the dying man never gave way . He might be dead in nine - tenths , yet the remaining tenth remained unchanged , till it too was torn apart . With his will he held the unit of himself firm , but the circle of his power was ever and ever reduced , it would be reduced to a point at last , then swept away . To adhere to life , he must adhere to human relationships , and he caught at every straw . Winifred , the butler , the nurse , Gudrun , these were the people who meant all to him , in these last resources . Gerald , in his father ’s presence , stiffened with repulsion . It was so , to a less degree , with all the other children except Winifred . They could not see anything but the death , when they looked at their father . It was as if some subterranean dislike overcame them . They could not see the familiar face , hear the familiar voice . They were overwhelmed by the antipathy of visible and audible death . Gerald could not breathe in his father ’s presence . He must get out at once . And so , in the same way , the father could not bear the presence of his son . It sent a final irritation through the soul of the dying man . The studio was made ready , Gudrun and Winifred moved in . They enjoyed so much the ordering and the appointing of it . And now they need hardly be in the house at all . They had their meals in the studio , they lived there safely . For the house was becoming dreadful . There were two nurses in white , flitting silently about , like heralds of death . The father was confined to his bed , there was a come and go of sotto voce sisters and brothers and children . Winifred was her father ’s constant visitor . Every morning , after breakfast , she went into his room when he was washed and propped up in bed , to spend half an hour with him . “
134906	134917	134904	134904	Daddie	323	” she asked him invariably . And invariably he answered : “
134930	135563	134928	134928	pet	2800	” She held his hand in both her own , lovingly and protectively . And this was very dear to him . She ran in again as a rule at lunch time , to tell him the course of events , and every evening , when the curtains were drawn , and his room was cosy , she spent a long time with him . Gudrun was gone home , Winifred was alone in the house : she liked best to be with her father . They talked and prattled at random , he always as if he were well , just the same as when he was going about . So that Winifred , with a child ’s subtle instinct for avoiding the painful things , behaved as if nothing serious was the matter . Instinctively , she withheld her attention , and was happy . Yet in her remoter soul , she knew as well as the adults knew : perhaps better . Her father was quite well in his make - belief with her . But when she went away , he relapsed under the misery of his dissolution . But still there were these bright moments , though as his strength waned , his faculty for attention grew weaker , and the nurse had to send Winifred away , to save him from exhaustion . He never admitted that he was going to die . He knew it was so , he knew it was the end . Yet even to himself he did not admit it . He hated the fact , mortally . His will was rigid . He could not bear being overcome by death . For him , there was no death . And yet , at times , he felt a great need to cry out and to wail and complain . He would have liked to cry aloud to Gerald , so that his son should be horrified out of his composure . Gerald was instinctively aware of this , and he recoiled , to avoid any such thing . This uncleanness of death repelled him too much . One should die quickly , like the Romans , one should be master of one ’s fate in dying as in living . He was convulsed in the clasp of this death of his father ’s , as in the coils of the great serpent of Laocoön . The great serpent had got the father , and the son was dragged into the embrace of horrifying death along with him . He resisted always . And in some strange way , he was a tower of strength to his father . The last time the dying man asked to see Gudrun he was grey with near death . Yet he must see someone , he must , in the intervals of consciousness , catch into connection with the living world , lest he should have to accept his own situation . Fortunately he was most of his time dazed and half gone . And he spent many hours dimly thinking of the past , as it were , dimly re - living his old experiences . But there were times even to the end when he was capable of realising what was happening to him in the present , the death that was on him . And these were the times when he called in outside help , no matter whose . For to realise this death that he was dying was a death beyond death , never to be borne . It was an admission never to be made . Gudrun was shocked by his appearance , and by the darkened , almost disintegrated eyes , that still were unconquered and firm . “
135566	135574	134928	134928	pet	2800	” he said in his weakened voice , “
135584	135585	135578	135578	you	2801	” “
135592	135627	135578	135578	you	2801	” replied Gudrun . There were slight dead gaps in the conversation , as if the ideas called up were only elusive straws floating on the dark chaos of the sick man ’s dying . “
135634	135638	135578	135578	you	2801	” he said . “
135650	135663	135715	135715	you	2801	” said Gudrun . She waited for what he would say next . “
135675	135687	135665	135665	you	2801	” It was strange how hollow the words were , meaningless . “
135702	135703	135694	135694	She	2804	” “
135718	135724	135715	135715	you	2801	” Gudrun was rather surprised . “
135730	135735	135715	135715	you	2801	” she exclaimed softly . “
135740	135750	135715	135715	you	2801	” Again Gudrun waited for what he would say . “
135766	135783	135751	135751	You	2801	” he asked , with a pitiful faint smile that was almost too much for Gudrun . “
135786	135794	135715	135715	you	2801	” she smiled — she would lie at random—“I
135803	135804	135800	135800	I	0	” “
135817	135940	135941	135941	You	2801	” Again Gudrun smiled , though her soul was dry with repulsion . Did one have to die like this — having the life extracted forcibly from one , whilst one smiled and made conversation to the end ? Was there no other way ? Must one go through all the horror of this victory over death , the triumph of the integral will , that would not be broken till it disappeared utterly ? One must , it was the only way . She admired the self - possession and the control of the dying man exceedingly . But she loathed the death itself . She was glad the everyday world held good , and she need not recognise anything beyond . “
135959	135960	135952	135952	you	2801	” “
135970	135974	135963	135963	you	2801	” said Gudrun . “
135987	136138	135985	135985	yourself	2801	” he said , and he felt a little exultation , that he had made this speech . He was still so strong and living ! But the nausea of death began to creep back on him , in reaction . Gudrun went away , back to Winifred . Mademoiselle had left , Gudrun stayed a good deal at Shortlands , and a tutor came in to carry on Winifred ’s education . But he did not live in the house , he was connected with the Grammar School . One day , Gudrun was to drive with Winifred and Gerald and Birkin to town , in the car . It was a dark , showery day . Winifred and Gudrun were ready and waiting at the door . Winifred was very quiet , but Gudrun had not noticed . Suddenly the child asked , in a voice of unconcern : “
136152	136156	136140	136140	you	2806	” Gudrun started . “
136162	136166	136157	136157	I	0	” she replied . “
136172	136173	136169	136169	you	2806	” “
136186	136198	136179	136179	He	5349	” The child pondered a few moments , then she asked : “
136207	136243	136201	136201	you	2806	” It was put almost like a question in geography or science , insistent , as if she would force an admission from the adult . The watchful , slightly triumphant child was almost diabolical . “
136251	136255	136245	136245	I	0	” repeated Gudrun . “
136261	136279	136258	136258	I	0	” But Winifred ’s large eyes were fixed on her , and the girl did not move . “
136285	136302	136280	136280	He	5349	” said Gudrun . A small smile came over Winifred ’s face , subtle and sceptical . “
136310	136355	136303	136303	I	0	” the child asserted , mockingly , and she moved away into the drive . Gudrun watched the isolated figure , and her heart stood still . Winifred was playing with a little rivulet of water , absorbedly as if nothing had been said . “
136363	136385	136356	136356	I	0	” she said , out of the moist distance . Gerald came to the door from out of the hall behind . “
136399	136419	136391	136391	she	2809	” he said . Gudrun looked at him . Their eyes met ; and they exchanged a sardonic understanding . “
136424	136443	136391	136391	she	2809	” said Gudrun . He looked at her again , and a fire flickered up in his eyes . “
136461	136480	136458	136458	you	0	” he said . She was rather taken aback . But , gathering herself together , she replied : “
136490	136491	136458	136458	you	0	” “
136496	136680	136493	136493	I	0	” And they both felt the subterranean desire to let go , to fling away everything , and lapse into a sheer unrestraint , brutal and licentious . A strange black passion surged up pure in Gudrun . She felt strong . She felt her hands so strong , as if she could tear the world asunder with them . She remembered the abandonments of Roman licence , and her heart grew hot . She knew she wanted this herself also — or something , something equivalent . Ah , if that which was unknown and suppressed in her were once let loose , what an orgiastic and satisfying event it would be . And she wanted it , she trembled slightly from the proximity of the man , who stood just behind her , suggestive of the same black licentiousness that rose in herself . She wanted it with him , this unacknowledged frenzy . For a moment the clear perception of this preoccupied her , distinct and perfect in its final reality . Then she shut it off completely , saying : “
136701	136702	136493	136493	I	0	” “
136707	136762	136493	136493	I	0	” he answered , going with her . They found Winifred at the lodge admiring the litter of purebred white puppies . The girl looked up , and there was a rather ugly , unseeing cast in her eyes as she turned to Gerald and Gudrun . She did not want to see them . “
136765	136769	136493	136493	I	0	” she cried . “
136797	136815	136816	136816	My	0	” She turned to caress the fine white bull - terrier bitch that stood uneasily near her . “
136821	136825	136816	136816	My	0	” she said , “
136879	136880	136876	136876	I	0	” “
136886	136896	136883	136884	Miss Winifred	186	” said the woman , appearing at the door . “
136923	136924	136925	136925	I	0	” “
136943	136944	136936	136938	a gentleman puppy	2822	” “
136948	136957	136936	136938	a gentleman puppy	2822	” There was the sound of a car . “
136962	136987	136960	136960	Rupert	169	” cried the child , and she ran to the gate . Birkin , driving his car , pulled up outside the lodge gate . “
136992	136996	136960	136960	Rupert	169	” cried Winifred . “
137011	137012	137009	137009	I	0	” “
137024	137028	137013	137013	I	0	” he said . “
137058	137079	137030	137030	I	0	” Birkin helped her up , amused at sending Gerald to sit by Gudrun in the body of the car . “
137087	137098	137081	137081	you	169	” Gerald called , as they rushed along the lanes . “
137101	137105	137030	137030	I	0	” exclaimed Birkin . “
137108	137129	137030	137030	I	0	” Gerald looked at Gudrun , who sat by his side , and he said , his eyes narrowly laughing , “
137152	137157	137142	137142	I	0	” Gudrun flushed deeply . “
137163	137167	137179	137179	he	2824	” she asked . “
137187	137192	137179	137179	he	2824	” Gudrun flushed darkly . “
137198	137205	137179	137179	he	2824	” she said , in challenge . “
137216	137217	137218	137218	I	0	” “
137227	137233	137218	137218	I	0	” said Gudrun , coldly . “
137243	137247	137241	137241	Rupert	169	” he called . “
137254	137255	137193	137193	You	2825	” “
137260	137277	137193	137193	You	2825	” called Gudrun . Birkin glanced quickly round . There was irritation in his eyes also . “
137280	137284	137193	137193	You	2825	” he replied . “
137294	137295	137287	137287	you	2825	” “
137298	137317	137287	137287	you	2825	” she cried , determined to fling her stone also into the pool , since they had begun , “
137338	137362	137329	137329	she	2826	” Gudrun ’s voice was clear and gong - like . It reminded Rupert of her father ’s , so strong and vibrant . “
137366	137377	137364	137364	I	0	” said Birkin , his face playful but yet determined , “
137395	137415	137364	137364	I	0	” They were both amused . Why this public avowal ? Gerald seemed suspended a moment , in amusement . “
137424	137428	137364	137364	I	0	” he called . “
137431	137435	137364	137364	I	0	” shouted Birkin . “
137446	137458	137364	137364	I	0	” said Gerald , and the car ran through the mud . “
137466	137512	137364	137364	I	0	” said Gerald , turning to Gudrun . This was an assumption of a sort of intimacy that irritated Gudrun almost like an affront . It seemed to her that Gerald was deliberately insulting her , and infringing on the decent privacy of them all . “
137517	137528	137364	137364	I	0	” she said , in her high , repellent voice . “
137547	137548	137539	137539	I	0	” “
137555	137559	137539	137539	I	0	” replied Gerald . “
137592	137593	137612	137612	he	2828	” “
137632	137633	137612	137612	he	2828	” “
137654	137663	137664	137664	You	0	” Then he seemed to glimmer in himself . “
137674	137678	137672	137672	you	0	” he asked . “
137693	137704	137685	137685	you	0	” came Gudrun ’s voice , strident above the noise . “
137725	137726	137728	137728	you	0	” “
137738	137742	137733	137733	you	0	” she echoed . “
137764	137805	137806	137806	You	0	” His eyes were flickering on her all the time . She felt as is he were kissing her freely and malevolently . It made the colour burn in her cheeks , but her heart was quite firm and unfailing . “
137816	137826	137808	137808	Rupert	169	” Gerald asked . Her eyes flashed with acknowledgment . “
137834	137838	137839	137839	I	0	” she said , “
137892	137893	137927	137927	He	2831	” “
137896	137900	137927	137927	He	2831	” said Gerald . “
137913	137914	137911	137911	Rupert	169	” “
137952	137953	137927	137927	He	2831	” “
137985	137986	137993	137993	he	2831	” “
137999	138003	137993	137993	he	2831	” said Gudrun . “
138089	138090	138094	138094	he	2831	” “
138097	138106	138094	138094	he	2831	” laughed Gerald . Gudrun shrugged her shoulders . “
138114	138118	138094	138094	he	2831	” she said . “
138124	138162	138163	138163	He	2831	” said Gerald . Birkin sat motionless , driving the car , quite unconscious of what they said . And Gudrun , sitting immediately behind him , felt a sort of ironic pleasure in thus exposing him . “
138166	138176	138163	138163	He	2831	” she added , with a grimace of irony , “
138205	138206	138163	138163	He	2831	” “
138212	138216	138210	138210	me	0	” said Gerald . “
138222	138226	138210	138210	me	0	” said Gudrun . “
138244	138248	138227	138227	I	0	” said Gerald . “
138253	138257	138251	138251	I	0	” said she . “
138271	138272	138266	138266	he	2831	” “
138275	138279	138280	138280	He	2831	” said Gudrun . “
138305	138306	138302	138302	I	0	” “
138317	138318	138319	138320	Le paradis	2848	” “
138322	138472	138319	138320	Le paradis	2848	” mocked Gudrun . Birkin , as he drove , felt a creeping of the spine , as if somebody was threatening his neck . But he shrugged with indifference . It began to rain . Here was a change . He stopped the car and got down to put up the hood . They came to the town , and left Gerald at the railway station . Gudrun and Winifred were to come to tea with Birkin , who expected Ursula also . In the afternoon , however , the first person to turn up was Hermione . Birkin was out , so she went in the drawing - room , looking at his books and papers , and playing on the piano . Then Ursula arrived . She was surprised , unpleasantly so , to see Hermione , of whom she had heard nothing for some time . “
138481	138485	138479	138479	you	2849	” she said . “
138488	138490	138319	138320	Le paradis	2848	” said Hermione—“I’ve
138496	138497	138319	138320	Le paradis	2848	” “
138504	138505	138319	138320	Le paradis	2848	” “
138508	138548	138319	138320	Le paradis	2848	” The two women looked at each other . Ursula resented Hermione ’s long , grave , downward - looking face . There was something of the stupidity and the unenlightened self - esteem of a horse in it . “
138557	138563	138564	138564	she	2849	” Ursula said to herself , “
138569	139087	138564	138564	she	2849	” It did seem as if Hermione , like the moon , had only one side to her penny . There was no obverse . She stared out all the time on the narrow , but to her , complete world of the extant consciousness . In the darkness , she did not exist . Like the moon , one half of her was lost to life . Her self was all in her head , she did not know what it was spontaneously to run or move , like a fish in the water , or a weasel on the grass . She must always know . But Ursula only suffered from Hermione ’s one - sidedness . She only felt Hermione ’s cool evidence , which seemed to put her down as nothing . Hermione , who brooded and brooded till she was exhausted with the ache of her effort at consciousness , spent and ashen in her body , who gained so slowly and with such effort her final and barren conclusions of knowledge , was apt , in the presence of other women , whom she thought simply female , to wear the conclusions of her bitter assurance like jewels which conferred on her an unquestionable distinction , established her in a higher order of life . She was apt , mentally , to condescend to women such as Ursula , whom she regarded as purely emotional . Poor Hermione , it was her one possession , this aching certainty of hers , it was her only justification . She must be confident here , for God knows , she felt rejected and deficient enough elsewhere . In the life of thought , of the spirit , she was one of the elect . And she wanted to be universal . But there was a devastating cynicism at the bottom of her . She did not believe in her own universals — they were sham . She did not believe in the inner life — it was a trick , not a reality . She did not believe in the spiritual world — it was an affectation . In the last resort , she believed in Mammon , the flesh , and the devil — these at least were not sham . She was a priestess without belief , without conviction , suckled in a creed outworn , and condemned to the reiteration of mysteries that were not divine to her . Yet there was no escape . She was a leaf upon a dying tree . What help was there then , but to fight still for the old , withered truths , to die for the old , outworn belief , to be a sacred and inviolate priestess of desecrated mysteries ? The old great truths had been true . And she was a leaf of the old great tree of knowledge that was withering now . To the old and last truth then she must be faithful even though cynicism and mockery took place at the bottom of her soul . “
139096	139113	139088	139088	I	0	” she said to Ursula , in her slow voice , that was like an incantation . “
139122	139123	139120	139120	friends	5028	” “
139127	139131	139120	139120	friends	5028	” said Ursula . “
139140	139162	139164	139164	he	2852	” Hermione paused before she answered . She saw perfectly well the other woman ’s vaunt : it seemed truly vulgar . “
139166	139176	139164	139164	he	2852	” she said slowly , and with perfect equanimity . “
139185	139227	139179	139179	you	2850	” The question was so calm and mild , so simple and bare and dispassionate that Ursula was somewhat taken aback , rather attracted . It pleased her almost like a wickedness . There was some delightful naked irony in Hermione . “
139230	139234	139235	139235	He	2852	” replied Ursula , “
139248	139278	139242	139242	I	0	” Hermione watched her with slow calm eyes . She noted this new expression of vaunting . How she envied Ursula a certain unconscious positivity ! even her vulgarity ! “
139285	139310	139282	139282	you	2850	” she asked , in her easy sing song . She was perfectly at her ease , perhaps even rather happy in this conversation . “
139318	139363	139364	139364	He	2852	” Ursula flushed a little at the mild impertinence of this question . And yet she could not definitely take offence . Hermione seemed so calmly and sanely candid . After all , it was rather great to be able to be so sane . “
139373	139377	139364	139364	He	2852	” she replied . “
139383	139390	139391	139391	He	2852	” Hermione was slow and level . “
139401	139417	139419	139419	he	2852	” Hermione was silent for some time , watching Ursula with slow , pensive eyes . “
139421	139434	139419	139419	he	2852	” she said at length , without expression . Then , rousing , “
139450	139451	139444	139444	You	2850	” “
139494	139506	139509	139509	you	2850	” Again there was a long pause , before Hermione replied : “
139515	139551	139509	139509	you	2850	” Then again there was silence . Hermione shuddered with a strange desire . Ah , if only he had asked her to subserve him , to be his slave ! She shuddered with desire . “
139558	139559	139554	139554	I	0	” “
139566	139592	139596	139596	he	2852	” They had both begun at once , they both stopped . Then , Hermione , assuming priority of speech , resumed as if wearily : “
139602	139603	139604	139604	He	2852	” “
139668	139669	139663	139663	he	2852	” “
139681	139686	139677	139677	his	2852	” said Hermione slowly . “
139689	139693	139677	139677	his	2852	” cried Ursula . “
139710	139718	139719	139719	He	2852	” But immediately she began to retract . “
139730	139734	139719	139719	He	2852	” she resumed . “
139799	139841	139842	139842	He	2852	” There was a long pause , bitter for Hermione . Ah , if only he would have made this demand of her ? Her he drove into thought , drove inexorably into knowledge — and then execrated her for it . “
139849	139853	139842	139842	He	2852	” Ursula resumed , “
139863	139864	139842	139842	He	2852	” “
139874	139884	139889	139889	he	2852	” said Hermione in her mild sing - song , “
139892	139901	139889	139889	he	2852	” Her long face looked sardonic and amused . “
139904	140131	139889	139889	he	2852	” said Ursula vaguely . After all , the tiresome thing was , he did not want an odalisk , he did not want a slave . Hermione would have been his slave — there was in her a horrible desire to prostrate herself before a man — a man who worshipped her , however , and admitted her as the supreme thing . He did not want an odalisk . He wanted a woman to take something from him , to give herself up so much that she could take the last realities of him , the last facts , the last physical facts , physical and unbearable . And if she did , would he acknowledge her ? Would he be able to acknowledge her through everything , or would he use her just as his instrument , use her for his own private satisfaction , not admitting her ? That was what the other men had done . They had wanted their own show , and they would not admit her , they turned all she was into nothingness . Just as Hermione now betrayed herself as a woman . Hermione was like a man , she believed only in men ’s things . She betrayed the woman in herself . And Birkin , would he acknowledge , or would he deny her ? “
140134	140149	139889	139889	he	2852	” said Hermione , as each woman came out of her own separate reverie . “
140164	140165	140156	140156	I	0	” “
140170	140174	140156	140156	I	0	” asked Ursula . “
140177	140180	139889	139889	he	2852	” said Hermione slowly—“I
140193	140206	140184	140185	a man	4648	” Hermione held out her hand and clenched it with rhapsodic intensity . “
140258	140287	140255	140257	a sensitive man—.	2861	” There was a break , as if the pythoness had uttered the oracle , and now the woman went on , in a rhapsody - wearied voice : “
140456	140463	140464	140464	He	2856	” Hermione lapsed into bitter reverie . “
140554	140555	140589	140589	one	4646	” “
140558	140563	140589	140589	one	4646	” said Ursula humbly , “
140569	140587	140564	140564	you	0	” An unearthly light came on Hermione ’s face . She clenched her hand like one inspired . “
140624	140625	140564	140564	you	0	” “
140637	140641	140642	140642	I	0	” said Ursula . “
140661	140672	140674	140674	you	0	” Hermione stopped and looked at her a long time . “
140676	140720	140674	140674	you	0	” she said at last . And this utterance seemed to her a mark of Ursula ’s far distance from herself . For to Hermione suffering was the greatest reality , come what might . Yet she too had a creed of happiness . “
140723	140727	140674	140674	you	0	” she said . “
140733	140742	140728	140728	One	4646	” But it was a matter of will . “
140745	140752	140728	140728	One	4646	” said Hermione , listlessly now , “
140824	140825	140818	140818	I	0	” “
140829	140833	140818	140818	I	0	” said Ursula , “
140856	140857	140851	140851	he	2867	” “
140866	140896	140860	140860	his	2867	” said Hermione , with that weary finality , and a sort of si jeunesse savait infallibility . There was a pause . Then Ursula broke into faltering challenge . “
140910	140911	140908	140908	you	0	” “
140915	140919	140908	140908	you	0	” said Hermione . “
140984	140985	140987	140987	I	0	” “
140989	140993	140987	140987	I	0	” said Ursula . “
141006	141007	140997	140997	he	2867	” “
141018	141037	140997	140997	he	2867	” They both lapsed into silence . Ursula was filled with deep resentment and a touch of hopelessness . “
141043	141054	140997	140997	he	2867	” she said to herself , silently addressing her adversary . “
141244	141529	141237	141237	your	2865	” The two women sat on in antagonistic silence . Hermione felt injured , that all her good intention , all her offering , only left the other woman in vulgar antagonism . But then , Ursula could not understand , never would understand , could never be more than the usual jealous and unreasonable female , with a good deal of powerful female emotion , female attraction , and a fair amount of female understanding , but no mind . Hermione had decided long ago that where there was no mind , it was useless to appeal for reason — one had merely to ignore the ignorant . And Rupert — he had now reacted towards the strongly female , healthy , selfish woman — it was his reaction for the time being — there was no helping it all . It was all a foolish backward and forward , a violent oscillation that would at length be too violent for his coherency , and he would smash and be dead . There was no saving him . This violent and directionless reaction between animalism and spiritual truth would go on in him till he tore himself in two between the opposite directions , and disappeared meaninglessly out of life . It was no good — he too was without unity , without mind , in the ultimate stages of living ; not quite man enough to make a destiny for a woman . They sat on till Birkin came in and found them together . He felt at once the antagonism in the atmosphere , something radical and insuperable , and he bit his lip . But he affected a bluff manner . “
141544	141545	141541	141541	you	168	” “
141561	141562	141555	141555	you	168	” “
141599	141699	141597	141597	Ursula	255	” It was rather annoying to see him trying to placate both women at once . Both women watched him , Hermione with deep resentment and pity for him , Ursula very impatient . He was nervous and apparently in quite good spirits , chattering the conventional commonplaces . Ursula was amazed and indignant at the way he made small - talk ; he was adept as any fat in Christendom . She became quite stiff , she would not answer . It all seemed to her so false and so belittling . And still Gudrun did not appear . “
141711	141717	141719	141719	you	0	” said Hermione at length . “
141721	141725	141719	141719	you	0	” he answered . “
141733	141734	141719	141719	you	0	” “
141749	141750	141719	141719	you	0	” “
141757	141758	141759	141759	I	0	” “
141764	141781	141759	141759	I	0	” said Hermione slowly . Then she looked at him with her slow , heavy gaze . “
141806	141807	141791	141791	Olandese	350	” “
141811	141815	141791	141791	Olandese	350	” he said . “
141824	141828	141818	141818	I	0	” said Hermione . “
141836	141837	141831	141831	you	0	” “
141862	141863	141849	141849	I	0	” “
141878	141882	141866	141866	she	95	” said Birkin ; “
141912	141966	141907	141907	Barnes	349	” Hermione was silent for some moments , in a state of hostility . But yet , she had got Birkin back again into her world ! How subtle her influence was , she seemed to start his irritable attention into her direction exclusively , in one minute . He was her creature . “
141969	141973	141974	141974	you	2879	” she said , “
141978	142007	141974	141974	you	2879	” Then a sort of tension came over her , she raised her face like the pythoness inspired with oracles , and went on , in rhapsodic manner : “
142032	142068	142021	142021	i	0	” She went on in Italian , as if , in thinking of the Italians she thought in their language . He listened with a shade of distaste to her rhapsody , then he said : “
142095	142096	142097	142097	I	0	” “
142109	142113	142105	142105	you	2879	” said Hermione . “
142140	142141	142105	142105	you	2879	” “
142148	142170	142143	142143	you	2879	” Ursula asked of Hermione . Hermione hated to be broken in upon in this manner . Yet she answered mildly : “
142195	142196	142189	142190	My mother	2883	” “
142199	142289	142290	142290	Micio	351	” There was a pause , painful to Ursula and to Birkin . Hermione however seemed abstracted and calm . Birkin was white , his eyes glowed as if he were in a fever , he was far too over - wrought . How Ursula suffered in this tense atmosphere of strained wills ! Her head seemed bound round by iron bands . Birkin rang the bell for tea . They could not wait for Gudrun any longer . When the door was opened , the cat walked in . “
142294	142330	142331	142331	Vieni	352	” called Hermione , in her slow , deliberate sing - song . The young cat turned to look at her , then , with his slow and stately walk he advanced to her side . “
142336	142361	142331	142331	Vieni	352	” Hermione was saying , in her strange caressive , protective voice , as if she were always the elder , the mother superior . “
142392	142406	142408	142408	he	2887	” And slowly she rubbed his head , slowly and with ironic indifference . “
142412	142423	142408	142408	he	2887	” said Ursula , who knew nothing of the language . “
142426	142432	142408	142408	he	2887	” said Hermione at length . “
142464	142690	142458	142458	She	2889	” Tea was brought in . Birkin poured out for them . It was strange how inviolable was the intimacy which existed between him and Hermione . Ursula felt that she was an outsider . The very tea - cups and the old silver was a bond between Hermione and Birkin . It seemed to belong to an old , past world which they had inhabited together , and in which Ursula was a foreigner . She was almost a parvenue in their old cultured milieu . Her convention was not their convention , their standards were not her standards . But theirs were established , they had the sanction and the grace of age . He and she together , Hermione and Birkin , were people of the same old tradition , the same withered deadening culture . And she , Ursula , was an intruder . So they always made her feel . Hermione poured a little cream into a saucer . The simple way she assumed her rights in Birkin ’s room maddened and discouraged Ursula . There was a fatality about it , as if it were bound to be . Hermione lifted the cat and put the cream before him . He planted his two paws on the edge of the table and bent his gracious young head to drink . “
142696	142700	142458	142458	She	2889	” sang Hermione , “
142710	142782	142458	142458	She	2889	” She lifted the cat ’s head with her long , slow , white fingers , not letting him drink , holding him in her power . It was always the same , this joy in power she manifested , peculiarly in power over any male being . He blinked forbearingly , with a male , bored expression , licking his whiskers . Hermione laughed in her short , grunting fashion . “
142796	142865	142789	142792	com ’ è superbo	2891	” She made a vivid picture , so calm and strange with the cat . She had a true static impressiveness , she was a social artist in some ways . The cat refused to look at her , indifferently avoided her fingers , and began to drink again , his nose down to the cream , perfectly balanced , as he lapped with his odd little click . “
142879	142883	142789	142792	com ’ è superbo	2891	” said Birkin . “
142886	142913	142789	142792	com ’ è superbo	2891	” said Hermione , easily assenting . Then , looking down at the cat , she resumed her old , mocking , humorous sing - song . “
142923	142973	142789	142792	com ’ è superbo	2891	” She lifted the Mino ’s white chin on her forefinger , slowly . The young cat looked round with a supremely forbearing air , avoided seeing anything , withdrew his chin , and began to wash his face with his paw . Hermione grunted her laughter , pleased . “
142977	143019	142789	142792	com ’ è superbo	2891	” she said . The cat reached forward again and put his fine white paw on the edge of the saucer . Hermione lifted it down with delicate slowness . This deliberate , delicate carefulness of movement reminded Ursula of Gudrun . “
143044	143110	143111	143111	I	0	” And she kept her finger on the softly planted paw of the cat , and her voice had the same whimsical , humorous note of bullying . Ursula had her nose out of joint . She wanted to go away now . It all seemed no good . Hermione was established for ever , she herself was ephemeral and had not yet even arrived . “
143116	143135	143111	143111	I	0	” she said suddenly . Birkin looked at her almost in fear — he so dreaded her anger . “
143145	143149	143213	143213	I	0	” he said . “
143152	143156	143157	143157	I	0	” she answered . “
143161	143183	143157	143157	I	0	” And turning to Hermione , before there was time to say any more , she held out her hand and said “
143188	143189	143157	143157	I	0	” “
143194	143202	143204	143204	you	0	” sang Hermione , detaining the hand . “
143209	143210	143204	143204	you	0	” “
143219	143234	143235	143235	You	0	” said Ursula , her face set , and averted from Hermione ’s eyes . “
143240	143260	143237	143237	you	0	” But Ursula had got her hand free . She turned to Birkin with a quick , almost jeering : “
143265	143608	143237	143237	you	0	” and she was opening the door before he had time to do it for her . When she got outside the house she ran down the road in fury and agitation . It was strange , the unreasoning rage and violence Hermione roused in her , by her very presence . Ursula knew she gave herself away to the other woman , she knew she looked ill - bred , uncouth , exaggerated . But she did not care . She only ran up the road , lest she should go back and jeer in the faces of the two she had left behind . For they outraged her . Next day Birkin sought Ursula out . It happened to be the half - day at the Grammar School . He appeared towards the end of the morning , and asked her , would she drive with him in the afternoon . She consented . But her face was closed and unresponding , and his heart sank . The afternoon was fine and dim . He was driving the motor - car , and she sat beside him . But still her face was closed against him , unresponding . When she became like this , like a wall against him , his heart contracted . His life now seemed so reduced , that he hardly cared any more . At moments it seemed to him he did not care a straw whether Ursula or Hermione or anybody else existed or did not exist . Why bother ! Why strive for a coherent , satisfied life ? Why not drift on in a series of accidents — like a picaresque novel ? Why not ? Why bother about human relationships ? Why take them seriously - male or female ? Why form any serious connections at all ? Why not be casual , drifting along , taking all for what it was worth ? And yet , still , he was damned and doomed to the old effort at serious living . “
143611	143615	143237	143237	you	0	” he said , “
143620	143654	143237	143237	you	0	” The car was running along a broad white road , between autumn trees . He gave her a little bit of screwed - up paper . She took it and opened it . “
143658	143667	143237	143237	you	0	” she cried . She examined the gift . “
143672	143677	143237	143237	you	0	” she cried again . “
143686	143706	143681	143681	you	0	” She put the question offensively . His face flickered with bored irritation . He shrugged his shoulders slightly . “
143711	143717	143707	143707	I	0	” he said , coolly . “
143725	143726	143723	143723	you	0	” “
143735	143758	143728	143728	I	0	” he asked . There was a silence , whilst she examined the rings that had been screwed up in the paper . “
143765	143769	143728	143728	I	0	” she said , “
143777	143796	143797	143797	You	0	” It was a round opal , red and fiery , set in a circle of tiny rubies . “
143802	143806	143797	143797	You	0	” he said . “
143812	143813	143807	143807	I	0	” “
143819	143823	143807	143807	I	0	” he said . “
143826	143841	143807	143807	I	0	” It was a rose - shaped , beautiful sapphire , with small brilliants . “
143844	143848	143807	143807	I	0	” she said , “
143853	143861	143807	143807	I	0	” She held it in the light . “
143870	143871	143807	143807	I	0	” “
143875	143879	143807	143807	I	0	” he said . “
143884	143961	143807	143807	I	0	” He suddenly swung the car out of the way of a farm - cart . It tilted on the bank . He was a careless driver , yet very quick . But Ursula was frightened . There was always that something regardless in him which terrified her . She suddenly felt he might kill her , by making some dreadful accident with the motor - car . For a moment she was stony with fear . “
143973	143978	143807	143807	I	0	” she asked him . “
143986	143997	143807	143807	I	0	” he said . And then , after a pause : “
144008	144030	144000	144000	you	0	” It was a squarish topaz set in a frame of steel , or some other similar mineral , finely wrought . “
144033	144037	144000	144000	you	0	” she said , “
144051	144052	144046	144046	you	0	” “
144063	144064	144065	144065	You	0	” “
144071	144072	144065	144065	You	0	” “
144082	144083	144086	144086	you	0	” “
144091	144092	144086	144086	you	0	” “
144101	144102	144093	144093	I	0	” “
144120	144208	144115	144115	You	0	” He did not answer . She remained with the jewels shut in her hand . She wanted to try them on her fingers , but something in her would not let her . And moreover , she was afraid her hands were too large , she shrank from the mortification of a failure to put them on any but her little finger . They travelled in silence through the empty lanes . Driving in a motor - car excited her , she forgot his presence even . “
144213	144218	144115	144115	You	0	” she asked suddenly . “
144224	144225	144115	144115	You	0	” “
144232	144233	144115	144115	You	0	” “
144236	144379	144115	144115	You	0	” It was the answer she liked . She opened her hand to look at the rings . They gave her such pleasure , as they lay , the three circles , with their knotted jewels , entangled in her palm . She would have to try them on . She did so secretly , unwilling to let him see , so that he should not know her finger was too large for them . But he saw nevertheless . He always saw , if she wanted him not to . It was another of his hateful , watchful characteristics . Only the opal , with its thin wire loop , would go on her ring finger . And she was superstitious . No , there was ill - portent enough , she would not accept this ring from him in pledge . “
144382	144399	144115	144115	You	0	” she said , putting forward her hand , that was half - closed and shrinking . “
144407	144426	144405	144405	me	0	” He looked at the red - glinting , soft stone , on her over - sensitive skin . “
144429	144433	144405	144405	me	0	” he said . “
144443	144448	144441	144441	they	2894	” she said wistfully . “
144471	144472	144467	144467	I	0	” “
144476	144506	144467	144467	I	0	” she laughed . And , consumed with a desire to see how the other rings would look on her hand , she put them on her little finger . “
144515	144519	144467	144467	I	0	” he said . “
144522	144583	144467	144467	I	0	” she replied , doubtfully . And she sighed . She knew that , in accepting the rings , she was accepting a pledge . Yet fate seemed more than herself . She looked again at the jewels . They were very beautiful to her eyes — not as ornament , or wealth , but as tiny fragments of loveliness . “
144591	145035	144587	144587	you	0	” she said , putting her hand , half unwillingly , gently on his arm . He smiled , slightly . He wanted her to come to him . But he was angry at the bottom of his soul , and indifferent . He knew she had a passion for him , really . But it was not finally interesting . There were depths of passion when one became impersonal and indifferent , unemotional . Whereas Ursula was still at the emotional personal level — always so abominably personal . He had taken her as he had never been taken himself . He had taken her at the roots of her darkness and shame — like a demon , laughing over the fountain of mystic corruption which was one of the sources of her being , laughing , shrugging , accepting , accepting finally . As for her , when would she so much go beyond herself as to accept him at the quick of death ? She now became quite happy . The motor - car ran on , the afternoon was soft and dim . She talked with lively interest , analysing people and their motives — Gudrun , Gerald . He answered vaguely . He was not very much interested any more in personalities and in people — people were all different , but they were all enclosed nowadays in a definite limitation , he said ; there were only about two great ideas , two great streams of activity remaining , with various forms of reaction therefrom . The reactions were all varied in various people , but they followed a few great laws , and intrinsically there was no difference . They acted and reacted involuntarily according to a few great laws , and once the laws , the great principles , were known , people were no longer mystically interesting . They were all essentially alike , the differences were only variations on a theme . None of them transcended the given terms . Ursula did not agree — people were still an adventure to her — but — perhaps not as much as she tried to persuade herself . Perhaps there was something mechanical , now , in her interest . Perhaps also her interest was destructive , her analysing was a real tearing to pieces . There was an under - space in her where she did not care for people and their idiosyncracies , even to destroy them . She seemed to touch for a moment this undersilence in herself , she became still , and she turned for a moment purely to Birkin . “
145048	145052	145053	145053	We	2896	” she said . “
145073	145074	145075	145075	I	0	” “
145084	145088	145075	145075	I	0	” he said . “
145101	145102	145096	145096	you	0	” “
145107	145117	145103	145103	Hermione	168	” he said , in rather an uneasy voice . “
145145	145171	145172	145172	You	0	” Ursula drew away , closed in a violent silence . He knitted his brows , and his eyes began to sparkle again in anger . “
145180	145185	145178	145178	you	0	” he asked irritably . “
145202	145210	145199	145199	I	0	” Her tone was jeering and offensive . “
145218	145222	145214	145214	I	0	” he said ; “
145233	145242	145229	145229	you	0	” His brows were tense with violent irritation . “
145272	145273	145266	145266	I	0	” “
145278	145282	145284	145284	your	0	” he cried , “
145341	145342	145338	145339	her counterpart	2899	” “
145347	145351	145338	145339	her counterpart	2899	” cried Ursula . “
145452	145468	145469	145469	he	0	“ If you were n’t a fool , if only you were n’t a fool , ”
145475	145543	145469	145469	he	0	“ you ’d see that one could be decent , even when one has been wrong . I was wrong to go on all those years with Hermione — it was a deathly process . But after all , one can have a little human decency . But no , you would tear my soul out with your jealousy at the very mention of Hermione ’s name . ”
145544	145579	145469	145469	he	0	“ I jealous ! I — jealous ! You are mistaken if you think that . I ’m not jealous in the least of Hermione , she is nothing to me , not that ! ”
145586	145687	145581	145581	Ursula	255	“ No , it ’s you who are a liar . It ’s you who must return , like a dog to his vomit . It is what Hermione stands for that I hate . I hate it . It is lies , it is false , it is death . But you want it , you ca n’t help it , you ca n’t help yourself . You belong to that old , deathly way of living — then go back to it . But do n’t come to me , for I ’ve nothing to do with it . ”
145728	145736	145737	145737	he	2904	“ Ah , you are a fool , ”
145746	145909	145737	145737	he	2904	“ Yes , I am . I am a fool . And thank God for it . I ’m too big a fool to swallow your cleverness . God be praised . You go to your women — go to them — they are your sort — you’ve always had a string of them trailing after you — and you always will . Go to your spiritual brides — but do n’t come to me as well , because I ’m not having any , thank you . You ’re not satisfied , are you ? Your spiritual brides ca n’t give you what you want , they are n’t common and fleshy enough for you , are n’t they ? So you come to me , and keep them in the background ! You will marry me for daily use . But you ’ll keep yourself well provided with spiritual brides in the background . I know your dirty little game . ”
145938	145958	145918	145918	she	2906	“ And I , I ’m not spiritual enough , I ’m not as spiritual as that Hermione — ! ”
145971	146023	146024	146024	Her	2906	“ Then go to her , that ’s all I say , go to her , go . Ha , she spiritual — spiritual , she ! A dirty materialist as she is . She spiritual ? What does she care for , what is her spirituality ? What is it ? ”
146040	146255	146256	146256	She	2909	“ I tell you it ’s dirt , dirt , and nothing but dirt . And it ’s dirt you want , you crave for it . Spiritual ! Is that spiritual , her bullying , her conceit , her sordid materialism ? She ’s a fishwife , a fishwife , she is such a materialist . And all so sordid . What does she work out to , in the end , with all her social passion , as you call it . Social passion — what social passion has she?—show it me!—where is it ? She wants petty , immediate power , she wants the illusion that she is a great woman , that is all . In her soul she ’s a devilish unbeliever , common as dirt . That ’s what she is at the bottom . And all the rest is pretence — but you love it . You love the sham spirituality , it ’s your food . And why ? Because of the dirt underneath . Do you think I do n’t know the foulness of your sex life — and her’s?—I do . And it ’s that foulness you want , you liar . Then have it , have it . You ’re such a liar . ”
146322	146329	146330	146330	he	2910	“ This is a degrading exhibition , ”
146334	146340	146341	146341	she	2909	“ Yes , degrading indeed , ”
146344	146353	146341	146341	she	2909	“ But more to me than to you . ”
146354	146362	146363	146363	he	2910	“ Since you choose to degrade yourself , ”
146382	146385	146386	146386	she	2909	“ You ! ”
146389	146529	146386	146386	she	2909	“ You ! You truth - lover ! You purity - monger ! It stinks , your truth and your purity . It stinks of the offal you feed on , you scavenger dog , you eater of corpses . You are foul , foul — and you must know it . Your purity , your candour , your goodness — yes , thank you , we ’ve had some . What you are is a foul , deathly thing , obscene , that ’s what you are , obscene and perverse . You , and love ! You may well say , you do n’t want love . No , you want yourself , and dirt , and death — that ’s what you want . You are so perverse , so death - eating . And then — ”
146530	146537	146538	146538	he	2911	“ There ’s a bicycle coming , ”
146553	146559	146560	146560	she	2912	“ I do n’t care , ”
146600	146604	146605	146605	he	2911	“ — Afternoon , ”
146610	146615	146617	146617	Birkin	169	“ Good - afternoon , ”
146687	146700	146701	146701	he	2911	“ It may all be true , lies and stink and all , ”
146704	146759	146701	146701	he	2911	“ But Hermione ’s spiritual intimacy is no rottener than your emotional - jealous intimacy . One can preserve the decencies , even to one ’s enemies : for one ’s own sake . Hermione is my enemy — to her last breath ! That ’s why I must bow her off the field . ”
146760	146796	146797	146797	her	2921	“ You ! You and your enemies and your bows ! A pretty picture you make of yourself . But it takes nobody in but yourself . I jealous ! I ! What I say , ”
146803	146842	146797	146797	her	2921	“ I say because it is true , do you see , because you are you , a foul and false liar , a whited sepulchre . That ’s why I say it . And you hear it . ”
146843	146848	146849	146849	he	2922	“ And be grateful , ”
146857	146860	146861	146861	she	2921	“ Yes , ”
146864	146879	146861	146861	she	2921	“ and if you have a spark of decency in you , be grateful . ”
146880	146890	146891	146891	he	2922	“ Not having a spark of decency , however — ”
146894	146897	146898	146898	she	2921	“ No , ”
146901	146952	146898	146898	she	2921	“ you have n’t a spark . And so you can go your way , and I ’ll go mine . It ’s no good , not the slightest . So you can leave me now , I do n’t want to go any further with you — leave me — ”
146953	146963	146964	146964	he	2922	“ You do n’t even know where you are , ”
146967	147006	146964	146964	he	2922	“ Oh , do n’t bother , I assure you I shall be all right . I ’ve got ten shillings in my purse , and that will take me back from anywhere you have brought me to . ”
147034	147038	147039	147039	he	2922	“ Very good , ”
147042	147051	147039	147039	he	2922	“ The only hopeless thing is a fool . ”
147052	147058	147059	147059	she	2923	“ You are quite right , ”
147109	147115	147116	147116	she	2923	“ And take your rings , ”
147119	147160	147116	147116	she	2923	“ and go and buy yourself a female elsewhere — there are plenty to be had , who will be quite glad to share your spiritual mess,—or to have your physical mess , and leave your spiritual mess to Hermione . ”
147694	147703	147704	147704	she	2936	“ See what a flower I found you , ”
147754	147757	147758	147758	he	2922	“ Pretty ! ”
147949	147955	147956	147956	she	2936	“ Did I abuse you ? ”
147975	147979	147980	147980	she	2936	“ Never mind , ”
147983	147991	147980	147980	she	2936	“ it is all for the good . ”
148002	148007	148008	148008	she	2936	“ Is n’t it ? ”
148011	148014	148015	148015	he	2922	“ Certainly , ”
148018	148028	148029	148029	She	2936	“ Wait ! I shall have my own back . ”
148048	148060	148061	148061	she	2936	“ You are mine , my love , are n’t you ? ”
148067	148070	148071	148071	he	2922	“ Yes , ”
148134	148138	148139	148139	she	2936	“ My love ! ”
148269	148275	148276	148276	she	2936	“ Do you love me ? ”
148283	148286	148287	148287	he	2922	“ Yes , ”
148309	148314	148315	148315	she	2936	“ So you ought , ”
148326	148333	148315	148315	she	2936	“ Did you find the rings ? ”
148334	148337	148362	148362	She	2936	“ Yes . ”
148338	148343	148315	148315	she	2936	“ Where are they ? ”
148344	148349	148350	148350	She	2936	“ In my pocket . ”
148366	148371	148372	148372	she	2936	“ Shall we go ? ”
148375	148378	148379	148379	he	2922	“ Yes , ”
148451	148456	148457	148457	she	2936	“ Are you happy ? ”
148468	148471	148472	148472	he	2922	“ Yes , ”
148475	148480	148481	148481	she	2936	“ So am I , ”
148507	148514	148515	148515	she	2936	“ Do n’t drive much more , ”
148518	148530	148515	148515	she	2936	“ I do n’t want you to be always doing something . ”
148531	148534	148535	148535	he	2922	“ No , ”
148538	148553	148535	148535	he	2922	“ We ’ll finish this little trip , and then we ’ll be free . ”
148554	148564	148565	148565	she	2936	“ We will , my love , we will , ”
148674	148679	148680	148680	she	2936	“ Are we here ! ”
148724	148731	148732	148732	she	2936	“ Father came here with mother , ”
148735	148755	148732	148732	she	2936	“ when they first knew each other . He loves it — he loves the Minster . Do you ? ”
148756	148784	148732	148732	she	2936	“ Yes . It looks like quartz crystals sticking up out of the dark hollow . We ’ll have our high tea at the Saracen ’s Head . ”
148927	148932	148933	148933	she	2936	“ Is it true ? ”
148938	148941	148933	148933	she	2936	“ What ? ”
148942	148949	148957	148957	he	2958	“ Everything — is everything true ? ”
148950	148956	148957	148957	he	2958	“ The best is true , ”
148964	148968	148969	148969	she	2936	“ Is it ? ”
149224	149230	149231	149231	she	2936	“ We love each other , ”
149236	149241	149242	149242	he	2958	“ More than that , ”
149671	149675	149676	149676	she	2936	“ My love , ”
149694	149698	149699	149699	he	2958	“ My love , ”
150107	150112	150113	150113	she	2936	“ What good things ! ”
150118	150130	150113	150113	she	2936	“ How noble it looks!—shall I pour out the tea ? — ”
150201	150206	150207	150207	she	2936	“ Everything is ours , ”
150212	150215	150216	150216	he	2958	“ Everything , ”
150229	150235	150236	150236	she	2936	“ I ’m so glad ! ”
150243	150248	150249	150249	he	2958	“ So am I , ”
150252	150271	150249	150249	he	2958	“ But I ’m thinking we ’d better get out of our responsibilities as quick as we can . ”
150272	150276	150277	150277	she	2936	“ What responsibilities ? ”
150282	150293	150277	150277	she	2936	“ We must drop our jobs , like a shot . ”
150302	150306	150307	150307	she	2936	“ Of course , ”
150310	150315	150307	150307	she	2936	“ there ’s that . ”
150316	150322	150323	150323	he	2958	“ We must get out , ”
150326	150339	150323	150323	he	2958	“ There ’s nothing for it but to get out , quick . ”
150349	150353	150354	150354	she	2936	“ But where ? ”
150357	150363	150364	150364	he	2958	“ I do n’t know , ”
150367	150377	150364	150364	he	2958	“ We ’ll just wander about for a bit . ”
150385	150395	150396	150396	she	2936	“ I should be perfectly happy at the Mill , ”
150399	150408	150409	150409	he	2958	“ It ’s very near the old thing , ”
150412	150419	150409	150409	he	2958	“ Let us wander a bit . ”
150478	150485	150486	150486	she	2936	“ Where will you wander to ? ”
150489	150515	150486	150486	she	2936	“ I do n’t know . I feel as if I would just meet you and we ’d set off — just towards the distance . ”
150516	150523	150524	150524	she	2936	“ But where can one go ? ”
150528	150546	150524	150524	she	2936	“ After all , there is only the world , and none of it is very distant . ”
150547	150550	150551	150551	he	2958	“ Still , ”
150554	150600	150551	150551	he	2958	“ I should like to go with you — nowhere . It would be rather wandering just to nowhere . That ’s the place to get to — nowhere . One wants to wander away from the world ’s somewheres , into our own nowhere . ”
150605	150612	150613	150613	she	2936	“ You see , my love , ”
150616	150646	150613	150613	she	2936	“ I ’m so afraid that while we are only people , we ’ve got to take the world that ’s given — because there is n’t any other . ”
150647	150652	150653	150653	he	2958	“ Yes there is , ”
150656	150716	150653	150653	he	2958	“ There ’s somewhere where we can be free — somewhere where one need n’t wear much clothes — none even — where one meets a few people who have gone through enough , and can take things for granted — where you be yourself , without bothering . There is somewhere — there are one or two people — ”
150717	150722	150723	150723	she	2936	“ But where — ? ”
150726	150748	150723	150723	she	2936	“ Somewhere — anywhere . Let ’s wander off . That ’s the thing to do — let ’s wander off . ”
150749	150752	150753	150753	she	2936	“ Yes — ”
150771	150776	150777	150777	he	2958	“ To be free , ”
150780	150796	150777	150777	he	2958	“ To be free , in a free place , with a few other people ! ”
150797	150800	150801	150801	she	2936	“ Yes , ”
150806	150810	150812	150812	her	2936	“ few other people ”
150814	150824	150825	150825	he	2958	“ It is n’t really a locality , though , ”
150828	150853	150825	150825	he	2958	“ It ’s a perfected relation between you and me , and others — the perfect relation — so that we are free together . ”
150854	150865	150866	150866	she	2936	“ It is , my love , is n’t it , ”
150869	150886	150866	150866	she	2936	“ It ’s you and me . It ’s you and me , is n’t it ? ”
151028	151036	151037	151037	he	2958	“ We shall never go apart again , ”
151112	151116	151117	151117	he	2958	“ Now then , ”
151120	151261	151117	151117	he	2958	“ yours first . Put your home address , and the date — then ‘ Director of Education , Town Hall — Sir — ’ Now then!—I do n’t know how one really stands — I suppose one could get out of it in less than month — Anyhow ‘ Sir — I beg to resign my post as classmistress in the Willey Green Grammar School . I should be very grateful if you would liberate me as soon as possible , without waiting for the expiration of the month ’s notice . ’ That ’ll do . Have you got it ? Let me look . ‘ Ursula Brangwen . ’ Good ! Now I ’ll write mine . I ought to give them three months , but I can plead health . I can arrange it all right . ”
151271	151274	151275	151275	he	2992	“ Now , ”
151286	151328	151275	151275	he	2992	“ shall we post them here , both together ? I know Jackie will say , ‘ Here ’s a coincidence ! ’ when he receives them in all their identity . Shall we let him say it , or not ? ”
151329	151335	151336	151336	she	2993	“ I do n’t care , ”
151339	151343	151344	151344	he	2992	“ No — ? ”
151349	151358	151359	151359	she	2993	“ It does n’t matter , does it ? ”
151362	151365	151366	151366	he	2992	“ Yes , ”
151369	151396	151366	151366	he	2992	“ Their imaginations shall not work on us . I ’ll post yours here , mine after . I can not be implicated in their imaginings . ”
151410	151417	151418	151418	she	2993	“ Yes , you are right , ”
151455	151460	151461	151461	he	2992	“ Shall we go ? ”
151464	151469	151470	151470	she	2993	“ As you like , ”
151569	151578	151579	151579	Ursula	255	“ Are you going to Shortlands to dinner ? ”
151587	151591	151592	151592	he	2992	“ Good God ! ”
151595	151611	151592	151592	he	2992	“ Shortlands ! Never again . Not that . Besides we should be too late . ”
151612	151623	151579	151579	Ursula	255	“ Where are we going then — to the Mill ? ”
151624	151672	151673	151673	She	3001	“ If you like . Pity to go anywhere on this good dark night . Pity to come out of it , really . Pity we ca n’t stop in the good darkness . It is better than anything ever would be — this good immediate darkness . ”
151949	151956	151957	151957	he	2992	“ We need not go home , ”
151960	151980	151957	151957	he	2992	“ This car has seats that let down and make a bed , and we can lift the hood . ”
151993	152001	152002	152002	she	3008	“ But what about them at home ? ”
152005	152010	152002	152002	she	3008	“ Send a telegram . ”
152128	152138	152139	152139	he	2992	“ I will send a telegram to your father , ”
152142	152158	152139	152139	he	2992	“ I will merely say ‘ spending the night in town , ’ shall I ? ”
152159	152162	152163	152163	she	3017	“ Yes , ”
152307	152326	152327	152327	he	2992	“ There is some bread , and cheese , and raisins , and apples , and hard chocolate , ”
152717	152722	152723	152723	she	3017	“ Where are we ? ”
152726	152731	152723	152723	she	3017	“ In Sherwood Forest . ”
152808	152814	152815	152815	he	2992	“ We will stay here , ”
152818	152825	152815	152815	he	2992	“ and put out the lights . ”
154225	154229	154230	154230	he	255	“ I say , ”
154246	154260	154230	154230	he	255	“ wo n’t you stay to dinner tonight ? I wish you would . ”
154279	154288	154289	154289	she	160	“ They ’ll be expecting me at home , ”
154292	154303	154304	154304	he	255	“ Oh , they wo n’t mind , will they ? ”
154307	154318	154304	154304	he	255	“ I should be awfully glad if you ’d stay . ”
154327	154336	154337	154337	he	255	“ I ’ll tell Thomas , shall I ? ”
154340	154349	154350	154350	she	160	“ I must go almost immediately after dinner , ”
154539	154543	154534	154534	He	255	“ Come in . ”
154592	154605	154606	154606	she	3072	“ The doctor would like to speak to you , Mr Crich , ”
154616	154620	154621	154621	he	255	“ The doctor ! ”
154627	154632	154621	154621	he	255	“ Where is he ? ”
154633	154642	154610	154610	her	3072	“ He is in the dining - room . ”
154643	154650	154651	154651	He	255	“ Tell him I ’m coming . ”
154669	154675	154677	154677	Gudrun	160	“ Which nurse was that ? ”
154679	154688	154690	154690	Winifred	297	“ Miss Inglis — I like her best , ”
154783	154792	154794	154794	Winifred	297	“ I must go now and see Mama , ”
154796	154806	154807	154807	She	3076	“ and see Dadda before he goes to sleep . ”
154823	154833	154835	154835	Gerald	255	“ You need n’t go yet , need you ? ”
154843	154867	154835	154835	Gerald	255	“ It is early yet . I ’ll walk down with you when you go . Sit down , do n’t hurry away . ”
154944	154954	154955	154955	she	160	“ Had the doctor anything new to tell you ? ”
154989	154995	154996	154996	he	255	“ No — nothing new , ”
155009	155033	155034	155034	He	255	“ He says the pulse is very weak indeed , very intermittent — but that does n’t necessarily mean much , you know . ”
155057	155060	155061	155061	she	160	“ No , ”
155066	155076	155061	155061	she	160	“ I do n’t understand anything about these things . ”
155077	155083	155084	155084	he	255	“ Just as well not , ”
155087	155098	155084	155084	he	255	“ I say , wo n’t you have a cigarette?—do ! ”
155121	155124	155125	155125	he	255	“ No , ”
155128	155145	155125	155125	he	255	“ we ’ve never had much illness in the house , either — not till father . ”
155174	155224	155225	155225	He	255	“ It ’s something you do n’t reckon with , you know , till it is there . And then you realise that it was there all the time — it was always there — you understand what I mean?—the possibility of this incurable illness , this slow death . ”
155249	155253	155225	155225	He	255	“ I know , ”
155257	155262	155225	155225	He	255	“ it is dreadful . ”
155316	155330	155331	155331	he	255	“ I do n’t know what the effect actually is , on one , ”
155367	155417	155361	155361	he	255	“ But I absolutely am not the same . There ’s nothing left , if you understand what I mean . You seem to be clutching at the void — and at the same time you are void yourself . And so you do n’t know what to do . ”
155418	155421	155422	155422	she	160	“ No , ”
155441	155447	155448	155448	she	160	“ What can be done ? ”
155482	155492	155493	155493	he	255	“ I do n’t know , I ’m sure , ”
155496	155631	155632	155632	He	255	“ But I do think you ’ve got to find some way of resolving the situation — not because you want to , but because you ’ve got to , otherwise you ’re done . The whole of everything , and yourself included , is just on the point of caving in , and you are just holding it up with your hands . Well , it ’s a situation that obviously ca n’t continue . You ca n’t stand holding the roof up with your hands , for ever . You know that sooner or later you ’ll have to let go . Do you understand what I mean ? And so something ’s got to be done , or there ’s a universal collapse — as far as you yourself are concerned . ”
155695	155702	155703	155703	she	160	“ But what can be done ? ”
155707	155737	155703	155703	she	160	“ You must use me if I can be of any help at all — but how can I ? I do n’t see how I can help you . ”
155745	155754	155755	155755	he	255	“ I do n’t want you to help , ”
155761	155836	155755	155755	he	255	“ because there ’s nothing to be done . I only want sympathy , do you see : I want somebody I can talk to sympathetically . That eases the strain . And there is nobody to talk to sympathetically . That ’s the curious thing . There is nobody . There ’s Rupert Birkin . But then he is n’t sympathetic , he wants to dictate . And that is no use whatsoever . ”
155892	155897	155898	155898	he	255	“ Oh , mother ! ”
155901	155914	155898	155898	he	255	“ How nice of you to come down . How are you ? ”
155953	155963	155945	155945	He	255	“ You know Miss Brangwen , do n’t you ? ”
155971	155974	155975	155975	she	565	“ Yes , ”
156009	156019	156020	156020	she	565	“ I came to ask you about your father , ”
156032	156041	156020	156020	she	565	“ I did n’t know you had company . ”
156042	156065	156066	156067	Mrs Crich	165	“ No ? Did n’t Winifred tell you ? Miss Brangwen stayed to dinner , to make us a little more lively — ”
156084	156096	156098	156098	she	565	“ I ’m afraid it would be no treat to her . ”
156105	156123	156098	156098	she	565	“ Winifred tells me the doctor had something to say about your father . What is it ? ”
156124	156150	156151	156151	Gerald	255	“ Only that the pulse is very weak — misses altogether a good many times — so that he might not last the night out , ”
156282	156287	156288	156288	she	565	“ How are you ? ”
156305	156326	156288	156288	she	565	“ You ’re not getting into a state , are you ? You ’re not letting it make you hysterical ? ”
156337	156346	156347	156347	he	568	“ I do n’t think so , mother , ”
156354	156366	156347	156347	he	568	“ Somebody ’s got to see it through , you know . ”
156367	156374	156376	156377	his mother	4685	“ Have they ? Have they ? ”
156380	156411	156376	156377	his mother	4685	“ Why should you take it on yourself ? What have you got to do , seeing it through . It will see itself through . You are not needed . ”
156412	156425	156426	156426	he	568	“ No , I do n’t suppose I can do any good , ”
156429	156441	156426	156426	he	568	“ It ’s just how it affects us , you see . ”
156442	156482	156376	156377	his mother	4685	“ You like to be affected — don’t you ? It ’s quite nuts for you ? You would have to be important . You have no need to stop at home . Why do n’t you go away ! ”
156500	156520	156521	156521	he	568	“ I do n’t think it ’s any good going away now , mother , at the last minute , ”
156526	156531	156533	156534	his mother	4685	“ You take care , ”
156536	156581	156533	156534	his mother	4685	“ You mind yourself — that ’s your business . You take too much on yourself . You mind yourself , or you ’ll find yourself in Queer Street , that ’s what will happen to you . You ’re hysterical , always were . ”
156582	156590	156591	156591	he	568	“ I ’m all right , mother , ”
156594	156608	156591	156591	he	568	“ There ’s no need to worry about me , I assure you . ”
156609	156639	156640	156640	He	568	“ Let the dead bury their dead — don’t go and bury yourself along with them — that ’s what I tell you . I know you well enough . ”
156680	156687	156688	156688	she	565	“ You ca n’t do it , ”
156694	156721	156688	156688	she	565	“ You have n’t the nerve . You ’re as weak as a cat , really — always were . Is this young woman staying here ? ”
156722	156725	156727	156727	Gerald	255	“ No , ”
156729	156736	156727	156727	Gerald	255	“ She is going home tonight . ”
156737	156753	156688	156688	she	565	“ Then she ’d better have the dog - cart . Does she go far ? ”
156754	156759	156688	156688	she	565	“ Only to Beldover . ”
156760	156763	156764	156766	The elderly woman	3080	“ Ah ! ”
156782	156795	156797	156798	the mother	565	“ You are inclined to take too much on yourself , Gerald , ”
156811	156818	156819	156819	he	255	“ Will you go , mother ? ”
156824	156833	156834	156834	she	565	“ Yes , I ’ll go up again , ”
156844	156849	156841	156841	she	565	“ Good - night . ”
156882	156891	156892	156892	she	565	“ Do n’t come any further with me , ”
156901	156910	156892	156892	she	565	“ I do n’t want you any further . ”
156946	156954	156955	156955	he	255	“ A queer being , my mother , ”
156958	156961	156963	156963	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
156965	156972	156963	156963	Gudrun	160	“ She has her own thoughts . ”
156973	156976	156978	156978	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
156985	156991	156992	156992	he	255	“ You want to go ? ”
156995	157009	156992	156992	he	255	“ Half a minute , I ’ll just have a horse put in — ”
157010	157013	157015	157015	Gudrun	160	“ No , ”
157017	157023	157015	157015	Gudrun	160	“ I want to walk . ”
157045	157053	157054	157054	he	255	“ You might just as well drive , ”
157057	157064	157065	157065	she	565	“ I ’d much rather walk , ”
157071	157096	157065	157065	she	565	“ You would ! Then I will come along with you . You know where your things are ? I ’ll put boots on . ”
157118	157125	157126	157126	he	255	“ Let us light a cigarette , ”
157138	157144	157126	157126	he	255	“ You have one too . ”
157379	157384	157385	157385	he	255	“ That ’s better , ”
157420	157425	157426	157426	she	565	“ Are you happier ? ”
157431	157435	157436	157436	he	255	“ Much better , ”
157445	157453	157436	157436	he	255	“ and I was rather far gone . ”
157490	157500	157501	157501	she	565	“ I ’m so glad if I help you , ”
157504	157507	157508	157508	he	255	“ Yes , ”
157511	157525	157501	157501	she	565	“ There ’s nobody else could do it , if you would n’t . ”
157526	157531	157532	157532	she	565	“ That is true , ”
157645	157655	157657	157657	her	565	“ But how much do you care for me ! ”
157663	157677	157657	157657	her	565	“ You see , I do n’t know , I do n’t understand ! ”
157678	157682	157683	157683	His	255	“ How much ! ”
157691	157701	157683	157683	His	255	“ I do n’t know either — but everything . ”
157739	157747	157749	157749	her	565	“ But I ca n’t believe it , ”
157823	157827	157828	157828	he	255	“ Why not ? ”
157831	157854	157855	157855	he	255	“ Why do n’t you believe it ? It ’s true . It is true , as we stand at this moment — ”
157864	157936	157937	157937	He	255	“ I care for nothing on earth , or in heaven , outside this spot where we are . And it is n’t my own presence I care about , it is all yours . I ’d sell my soul a hundred times — but I could n’t bear not to have you here . I could n’t bear to be alone . My brain would burst . It is true . ”
157948	157951	157952	157952	she	565	“ No , ”
158493	158499	158500	158500	he	3127	“ This is worth everything , ”
159029	159035	159036	159036	she	160	“ You are so beautiful , ”
159349	159356	159357	159357	she	160	“ Do n’t come any further , ”
159360	159368	159369	159369	he	255	“ You ’d rather I did n’t ? ”
159397	159405	159406	159406	She	160	“ Much rather — good - night . ”
159427	159432	159433	159433	he	255	“ Good - night , ”
159436	159439	159433	159433	he	255	“ Tomorrow . ”

159678	159691	159693	159693	Gerald	255	“ Some more — we shall have to run off the lake , ”
159695	159699	159693	159693	Gerald	255	“ Will you ? ”
159791	159802	159809	159810	his father	5330	“ Wha - a - ah - h - h — ”
159921	159924	159932	159932	she	3167	“ Ah ! ”
159940	159945	159956	159956	she	3167	“ Ah - h ! ”
159993	160004	159976	159976	She	3167	“ Poor Mr Crich!—Poor Mr Crich ! Poor Mr Crich ! ”
160005	160010	160012	160012	Gerald	255	“ Is he dead ? ”
160017	160025	160037	160037	she	3167	“ Oh yes , he ’s gone , ”
160093	160100	160101	160101	he	255	“ He ’s gone , Basil , ”
160122	160125	160127	160127	Basil	359	“ What ? ”
160178	160183	160184	160184	he	255	“ Father ’s gone , ”
160187	160196	160184	160184	he	255	“ He ’s dead ? Who says so ? ”
160197	160210	160211	160211	She	4685	“ Oh , you know , mother , if you see him . ”
160221	160229	160230	160230	he	255	“ Are you going to see him ? ”
160233	160236	160237	160237	she	4685	“ Yes , ”

160320	160323	160324	160324	she	565	“ Ay , ”
160342	160347	160324	160324	she	565	“ You ’re dead . ”
160359	160362	160363	160363	she	565	“ Beautiful , ”
160366	160403	160404	160404	she	565	“ beautiful as if life had never touched you — never touched you . God send I look different . I hope I shall look my years , when I am dead . Beautiful , beautiful , ”
160409	160432	160404	160404	she	565	“ You can see him in his teens , with his first beard on his face . A beautiful soul , beautiful — ”
160445	160465	160442	160442	she	565	“ None of you look like this , when you are dead ! Do n’t let it happen again . ”
160513	160555	160507	160507	she	565	“ Blame me , blame me if you like , that he lies there like a lad in his teens , with his first beard on his face . Blame me if you like . But you none of you know . ”
160574	160602	160556	160556	She	565	“ If I thought that the children I bore would lie looking like that in death , I ’d strangle them when they were infants , yes — ”
160603	160608	160616	160616	Gerald	255	“ No , mother , ”
160621	160632	160616	160616	Gerald	255	“ we are different , we do n’t blame you . ”
160657	160660	160661	160661	she	565	“ Pray ! ”

160950	160957	160959	160959	Gerald	255	“ You are cosy enough here , ”
161025	161031	161033	161033	Gudrun	160	“ Have you had coffee ? ”
161035	161048	161049	161049	he	255	“ I have , but I ’ll have some more with you , ”
161052	161068	161070	161070	Winifred	297	“ Then you must have it in a glass — there are only two cups , ”
161072	161080	161081	161081	he	255	“ It is the same to me , ”
161223	161229	161230	161230	she	3203	“ Will you have milk ? ”
161259	161266	161267	161267	he	255	“ No , I wo n’t , ”
161301	161318	161319	161319	he	255	“ Why do n’t you give me the glass — it is so clumsy for you , ”
161352	161359	161360	161360	he	255	“ You are quite en ménage , ”
161363	161375	161377	161377	Winifred	297	“ Yes . We are n’t really at home to visitors , ”
161379	161390	161377	161377	Winifred	297	“ You ’re not ? Then I ’m an intruder ? ”
161467	161472	161455	161457	the man below	3206	“ back - back ! ”
161525	161538	161522	161523	the daughters	3178	saying—“He was a good father to us — the best father in the world”—or
161539	161552	161553	161553	Gerald	255	else—“We sha n’t easily find another man as good as father was . ”
162296	162302	162303	162303	he	255	“ Can you tell me , ”
162306	162312	162303	162303	he	255	“ where this road goes ? ”
162313	162323	162357	162358	the miner	3232	“ Road ? Ay , it goes ter Whatmore . ”
162324	162345	162357	162358	the miner	3232	“ Whatmore ! Oh thank you , that ’s right . I thought I was wrong . Good - night . ”
162346	162351	162357	162358	the miner	3232	“ Good - night , ”

162865	162875	162876	162876	he	255	“ Can you tell me where Somerset Drive is ? ”
162885	162889	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ Where what ? ”
162897	162901	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ Somerset Drive . ”
162902	162930	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ Somerset Drive!—I’ve heard o ’ such a place , but I could n’t for my life say where it is . Who might you be wanting ? ”
162931	162938	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ Mr Brangwen — William Brangwen . ”
162939	162946	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ William Brangwen — ? — ? ”
162947	162965	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ Who teaches at the Grammar School , at Willey Green — his daughter teaches there too . ”
162966	163038	162891	162893	the tipsy miner	3257	“ O - o - o - oh , Brangwen ! Now I ’ve got you . Of course , William Brangwen ! Yes , yes , he ’s got two lasses as teachers , aside hisself . Ay , that ’s him — that ’s him ! Why certainly I know where he lives , back your life I do ! Yi — what place do they ca ’ it ? ”
163039	163043	163045	163045	Gerald	255	“ Somerset Drive , ”
163056	163063	163065	163066	the collier	983	“ Somerset Drive , for certain ! ”
163077	163113	163114	163114	He	255	“ Somerset Drive — yi ! I could n’t for my life lay hold o ’ the lercality o ’ the place . Yis , I know the place , to be sure I do — ”
163132	163167	163114	163114	He	255	“ You go up theer — an ’ you ta’e th ’ first — yi , th ’ first turnin ’ on your left — o ’ that side — past Withamses tuffy shop — ”
163168	163172	163174	163174	Gerald	255	“ I know , ”
163176	163256	163174	163174	Gerald	255	“ Ay ! You go down a bit , past wheer th ’ water - man lives — and then Somerset Drive , as they ca ’ it , branches off on ’ t right hand side — an ’ there ’s nowt but three houses in it , no more than three , I believe,—an ’ I ’m a’most certain as theirs is th ’ last — th ’ last o ’ th ’ three — you see — ”
163257	163263	163265	163265	Gerald	255	“ Thank you very much , ”
163267	163272	163265	163265	Gerald	255	“ Good - night . ”

164307	164314	164296	164296	He	255	“ Is it you , Ursula ? ”
164336	164343	164344	164344	he	255	“ No , it ’s me , ”
164353	164360	164344	164344	he	255	“ It is I , Gerald . ”
164387	164390	164391	164391	she	3307	“ Gerald ! ”
164421	164428	164429	164429	she	3307	“ Let me make a light , ”
164585	164592	164593	164593	she	3307	“ How did you come up ? ”
164596	164608	164609	164609	She	3307	“ I walked up the stairs — the door was open . ”
164614	164624	164625	164625	he	255	“ I have n’t closed this door , either , ”
164736	164742	164743	164743	she	3307	“ Why have you come ? ”
164749	164754	164755	164755	he	255	“ I wanted to , ”
164771	164777	164778	164778	she	3307	“ You are so muddy , ”
164794	164802	164803	164803	he	255	“ I was walking in the dark , ”
164843	164852	164853	164853	she	3307	“ And what do you want of me , ”
164920	164928	164929	164929	she	3307	“ What do you want of me ? ”
164999	165007	165008	165008	he	255	“ I came — because I must , ”
165011	165017	165018	165018	She	3307	“ Why do you ask ? ”
165027	165032	165033	165033	she	3307	“ I must ask , ”
165042	165048	165049	165049	he	255	“ There is no answer , ”
165084	165093	165094	165094	she	3307	“ But why did you come to me ? ”
165097	165126	165094	165094	she	3307	“ Because — it has to be so . If there were n’t you in the world , then I should n’t be in the world , either . ”
165177	165186	165187	165187	she	3307	“ Wo n’t you take off your boots , ”
165190	165196	165187	165187	she	3307	“ They must be wet . ”
166854	166861	166844	166844	She	160	“ Three — four — five ! ”
167006	167014	166997	166997	she	160	“ You must go , my love . ”
167035	167048	167024	167024	He	3338	“ But you must go , my love . It ’s late . ”
167049	167055	167056	167056	he	3338	“ What time is it ? ”
167077	167082	167083	167083	she	160	“ Past five o’clock , ”
167109	167115	167116	167116	she	160	“ You really must go , ”
167119	167125	167126	167126	he	3338	“ Not for a minute , ”
167140	167146	167147	167147	he	3338	“ Not for a minute , ”
167154	167157	167158	167158	she	160	“ Yes , ”
167163	167173	167158	167158	she	160	“ I ’m afraid if you stay any longer . ”
167317	167330	167332	167332	Gudrun	160	“ It is like a workman getting up to go to work , ”
167334	167344	167332	167332	Gudrun	160	“ And I am like a workman ’s wife . ”
167401	167413	167414	167414	she	160	“ Perhaps you ought to have put your boots on downstairs , ”
167833	167839	167840	167840	he	3338	“ Good - bye then , ”
167843	167851	167852	167852	she	160	“ I ’ll come to the gate , ”
167888	167893	167894	167894	she	160	“ Good - bye , ”
168152	168163	168164	168164	he	255	“ Shall we make it a double - barrelled affair ? ”
168171	168178	168180	168180	Birkin	364	“ Who for the second shot ? ”
168182	168187	168189	168189	Gerald	255	“ Gudrun and me , ”
168210	168216	168217	168217	he	255	“ Serious — or joking ? ”
168220	168238	168217	168217	he	255	“ Oh , serious . Shall I ? Shall Gudrun and I rush in along with you ? ”
168239	168245	168247	168247	Birkin	364	“ Do by all means , ”
168249	168260	168247	168247	Birkin	364	“ I did n’t know you ’d got that length . ”
168261	168265	168267	168267	Gerald	255	“ What length ? ”
168278	168289	168267	168267	Gerald	255	“ Oh yes , we ’ve gone all the lengths . ”
168290	168310	168312	168312	Birkin	364	“ There remains to put it on a broad social basis , and to achieve a high moral purpose , ”
168314	168328	168330	168330	Gerald	255	“ Something like that : the length and breadth and height of it , ”
168334	168338	168340	168340	Birkin	364	“ Oh well , ”
168342	168356	168340	168340	Birkin	364	“ it ’s a very admirable step to take , I should say . ”
168363	168370	168371	168371	he	255	“ Why are n’t you enthusiastic ? ”
168374	168385	168371	168371	he	255	“ I thought you were such dead nuts on marriage . ”
168391	168413	168386	168386	Birkin	364	“ One might as well be dead nuts on noses . There are all sorts of noses , snub and otherwise — ”
168417	168429	168430	168430	he	255	“ And all sorts of marriage , also snub and otherwise ? ”
168433	168438	168430	168430	he	255	“ That ’s it . ”
168439	168452	168454	168454	Gerald	255	“ And you think if I marry , it will be snub ? ”
168469	168479	168480	168480	he	255	“ How do I know what it will be ! ”
168483	168493	168480	168480	he	255	“ Do n’t lambaste me with my own parallels — ”
168499	168511	168512	168512	he	255	“ But I should like to know your opinion , exactly , ”
168515	168555	168512	168512	he	255	“ On your marriage?—or marrying ? Why should you want my opinion ? I ’ve got no opinions . I ’m not interested in legal marriage , one way or another . It ’s a mere question of convenience . ”
168562	168570	168571	168571	he	255	“ More than that , I think , ”
168575	168605	168571	168571	he	255	“ However you may be bored by the ethics of marriage , yet really to marry , in one ’s own personal case , is something critical , final — ”
168606	168622	168559	168559	him	255	“ You mean there is something final in going to the registrar with a woman ? ”
168623	168635	168637	168637	Gerald	255	“ If you ’re coming back with her , I do , ”
168639	168647	168637	168637	Gerald	255	“ It is in some way irrevocable . ”
168648	168654	168656	168656	Birkin	364	“ Yes , I agree , ”
168658	168685	168656	168656	Birkin	364	“ No matter how one regards legal marriage , yet to enter into the married state , in one ’s own personal instance , is final — ”
168686	168692	168694	168694	Birkin	364	“ I believe it is , ”
168696	168699	168694	168694	Birkin	364	“ somewhere . ”
168700	168711	168713	168713	Gerald	255	“ The question remains then , should one do it , ”
168724	168733	168734	168734	he	3359	“ You are like Lord Bacon , Gerald , ”
168737	168786	168734	168734	he	3359	“ You argue it like a lawyer — or like Hamlet ’s to - be - or - not - to - be . If I were you I would not marry : but ask Gudrun , not me . You ’re not marrying me , are you ? ”
168798	168801	168802	168802	he	255	“ Yes , ”
168805	168840	168802	168802	he	255	“ one must consider it coldly . It is something critical . One comes to the point where one must take a step in one direction or another . And marriage is one direction — ”
168841	168848	168850	168850	Birkin	364	“ And what is the other ? ”
168874	168880	168881	168881	he	255	“ I ca n’t say , ”
168884	168890	168881	168881	he	255	“ If I knew that — ”
168903	168912	168914	168914	Birkin	364	“ You mean if you knew the alternative ? ”
168916	168931	168914	168914	Birkin	364	“ And since you do n’t know it , marriage is a pis aller . ”
168945	168958	168959	168959	he	255	“ One does have the feeling that marriage is a pis aller , ”
168962	168969	168971	168971	Birkin	364	“ Then do n’t do it , ”
168973	168978	168979	168979	he	255	“ I tell you , ”
168983	169057	168979	168979	he	255	“ the same as I ’ve said before , marriage in the old sense seems to me repulsive . Égoïsme à deux is nothing to it . It ’s a sort of tacit hunting in couples : the world all in couples , each couple in its own little house , watching its own little interests , and stewing in its own little privacy — it ’s the most repulsive thing on earth . ”
169058	169063	169065	169065	Gerald	255	“ I quite agree , ”
169067	169085	168979	168979	he	255	“ There ’s something inferior about it . But as I say , what ’s the alternative . ”
169086	169114	168979	168979	he	255	“ One should avoid this home instinct . It ’s not an instinct , it ’s a habit of cowardliness . One should never have a home . ”
169115	169120	169122	169122	Gerald	255	“ I agree really , ”
169124	169131	169122	169122	Gerald	255	“ But there ’s no alternative . ”
169132	169183	168979	168979	he	255	“ We ’ve got to find one . I do believe in a permanent union between a man and a woman . Chopping about is merely an exhaustive process . But a permanent relation between a man and a woman is n’t the last word — it certainly is n’t . ”
169184	169187	169189	169189	Gerald	255	“ Quite , ”
169191	169195	169197	169197	Birkin	364	“ In fact , ”
169199	169228	169197	169197	Birkin	364	“ because the relation between man and woman is made the supreme and exclusive relationship , that ’s where all the tightness and meanness and insufficiency comes in . ”
169229	169236	169238	169238	Gerald	255	“ Yes , I believe you , ”
169240	169279	169238	169238	Gerald	255	“ You ’ve got to take down the love - and - marriage ideal from its pedestal . We want something broader . I believe in the additional perfect relationship between man and man — additional to marriage . ”
169280	169292	169294	169294	Gerald	255	“ I can never see how they can be the same , ”
169296	169315	169294	169294	Gerald	255	“ Not the same — but equally important , equally creative , equally sacred , if you like . ”
169316	169320	169322	169322	Gerald	255	“ I know , ”
169324	169341	169322	169322	Gerald	255	“ you believe something like that . Only I ca n’t feel it , you see . ”
170118	170121	170123	170123	Birkin	364	“ Look , ”
170125	170132	170123	170123	Birkin	364	“ there is a pretty chair . ”
170133	170136	170138	170138	Ursula	364	“ Charming ! ”
170140	170145	170138	170138	Ursula	364	“ Oh , charming . ”
170211	170216	170218	170218	Birkin	364	“ It was once , ”
170220	170318	170218	170218	Birkin	364	“ gilded — and it had a cane seat . Somebody has nailed this wooden seat in . Look , here is a trifle of the red that underlay the gilt . The rest is all black , except where the wood is worn pure and glossy . It is the fine unity of the lines that is so attractive . Look , how they run and meet and counteract . But of course the wooden seat is wrong — it destroys the perfect lightness and unity in tension the cane gave . I like it though — ”
170319	170323	170325	170325	Ursula	364	“ Ah yes , ”
170327	170331	170325	170325	Ursula	364	“ so do I. ”
170332	170338	170339	170339	Birkin	364	“ How much is it ? ”
170344	170348	170339	170339	Birkin	364	“ Ten shillings . ”
170349	170357	170218	170218	Birkin	364	“ And you will send it — ? ”
170362	170369	170370	170370	Birkin	364	“ So beautiful , so pure ! ”
170373	170380	170370	170370	Birkin	364	“ It almost breaks my heart . ”
170390	170407	170381	170381	They	3409	“ My beloved country — it had something to express even when it made that chair . ”
170408	170415	170417	170417	Ursula	364	“ And has n’t it now ? ”
170429	170506	170424	170424	he	4658	“ No , it has n’t . When I see that clear , beautiful chair , and I think of England , even Jane Austen ’s England — it had living thoughts to unfold even then , and pure happiness in unfolding them . And now , we can only fish among the rubbish heaps for the remnants of their old expression . There is no production in us now , only sordid and foul mechanicalness . ”
170507	170513	170515	170515	Ursula	364	“ It is n’t true , ”
170517	170556	170515	170515	Ursula	364	“ Why must you always praise the past , at the expense of the present ? Really , I do n’t think so much of Jane Austen ’s England . It was materialistic enough , if you like — ”
170557	170565	170567	170567	Birkin	364	“ It could afford to be materialistic , ”
170569	170621	170567	170567	Birkin	364	“ because it had the power to be something other — which we have n’t . We are materialistic because we have n’t the power to be anything else — try as we may , we ca n’t bring off anything but materialism : mechanism , the very soul of materialism . ”
170644	170657	170658	170658	she	364	“ And I hate your past . I ’m sick of it , ”
170661	170715	170658	170658	she	364	“ I believe I even hate that old chair , though it is beautiful . It is n’t my sort of beauty . I wish it had been smashed up when its day was over , not left to preach the beloved past to us . I ’m sick of the beloved past . ”
170716	170728	170729	170729	he	3410	“ Not so sick as I am of the accursed present , ”
170732	170764	170729	170729	he	3410	“ Yes , just the same . I hate the present — but I do n’t want the past to take its place — I do n’t want that old chair . ”
170800	170804	170805	170805	he	3410	“ All right , ”
170808	170841	170797	170797	He	3410	“ then let us not have it . I ’m sick of it all , too . At any rate one ca n’t go on living on the old bones of beauty . ”
170842	170847	170848	170848	she	3410	“ One ca n’t , ”
170851	170859	170797	170797	He	3410	“ I do n’t want old things . ”
170860	170873	170874	170874	he	3410	“ The truth is , we do n’t want things at all , ”
170877	170893	170874	170874	he	3410	“ The thought of a house and furniture of my own is hateful to me . ”
170905	170918	170902	170902	she	3410	“ So it is to me . But one must live somewhere . ”
170919	170925	170926	170926	he	3410	“ Not somewhere — anywhere , ”
170929	171011	170926	170926	he	3410	“ One should just live anywhere — not have a definite place . I do n’t want a definite place . As soon as you get a room , and it is complete , you want to run from it . Now my rooms at the Mill are quite complete , I want them at the bottom of the sea . It is a horrible tyranny of a fixed milieu , where each piece of furniture is a commandment - stone . ”
171025	171034	171035	171035	she	3410	“ But what are we going to do ? ”
171038	171065	171035	171035	she	3410	“ We must live somehow . And I do want some beauty in my surroundings . I want a sort of natural grandeur even , splendour . ”
171066	171220	171221	171221	She	3415	“ You ’ll never get it in houses and furniture — or even clothes . Houses and furniture and clothes , they are all terms of an old base world , a detestable society of man . And if you have a Tudor house and old , beautiful furniture , it is only the past perpetuated on top of you , horrible . And if you have a perfect modern house done for you by Poiret , it is something else perpetuated on top of you . It is all horrible . It is all possessions , possessions , bullying you and turning you into a generalisation . You have to be like Rodin , Michelangelo , and leave a piece of raw rock unfinished to your figure . You must leave your surroundings sketchy , unfinished , so that you are never contained , never confined , never dominated from the outside . ”
171228	171246	171247	171247	she	3415	“ And we are never to have a complete place of our own — never a home ? ”
171250	171260	171261	171261	he	3417	“ Pray God , in this world , no , ”
171264	171272	171273	171273	she	3415	“ But there ’s only this world , ”
171287	171301	171302	171302	he	3417	“ Meanwhile , then , we ’ll avoid having things of our own , ”
171305	171314	171315	171315	she	3415	“ But you ’ve just bought a chair , ”
171318	171330	171331	171331	he	3417	“ I can tell the man I do n’t want it , ”
171347	171350	171351	171351	she	3415	“ No , ”
171354	171368	171351	171351	she	3415	“ we do n’t want it . I ’m sick of old things . ”
171369	171375	171376	171376	he	3417	“ New ones as well , ”
171457	171465	171467	171467	Ursula	364	“ Let us give it to them , ”
171469	171478	171467	171467	Ursula	364	“ Look they are getting a home together . ”
171479	171489	171490	171490	he	3417	“ I wo n’t aid abet them in it , ”
171510	171514	171516	171516	Ursula	364	“ Oh yes , ”
171518	171532	171516	171516	Ursula	364	“ It ’s right for them — there ’s nothing else for them . ”
171533	171537	171539	171539	Birkin	364	“ Very well , ”
171541	171552	171539	171539	Birkin	364	“ you offer it to them . I ’ll watch . ”
171595	171601	171603	171603	Ursula	364	“ We bought a chair , ”
171605	171626	171603	171603	Ursula	364	“ and we do n’t want it . Would you have it ? We should be glad if you would . ”
171644	171651	171653	171653	Ursula	364	“ Would you care for it ? ”
171655	171666	171667	171667	she	364	“ It ’s really very pretty — but — but — ”
171713	171722	171724	171724	Ursula	364	“ We wanted to give it to you , ”
171902	171910	171911	171911	she	364	“ Wo n’t you have the chair ? ”
171979	171985	171986	171986	he	4658	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
172042	172047	172021	172021	his	4658	“ What she warnt?—eh ? ”
172067	172082	172083	172083	he	4658	“ To give you a chair — that — with the label on it , ”
172111	172124	172125	172125	he	4658	“ What ’s she warnt to give it us for , guvnor , ”
172138	172173	172175	172175	Birkin	364	“ Thought you ’d like it — it ’s a pretty chair . We bought it and do n’t want it . No need for you to have it , do n’t be frightened , ”
172195	172212	172214	172215	the woman	873	“ Why do n’t you want it for yourselves , if you ’ve just bought it ? ”
172218	172245	172246	172246	She	364	“ ’ Taint good enough for you , now you ’ve had a look at it . Frightened it ’s got something in it , eh ? ”
172259	172267	172269	172269	Birkin	364	“ I ’d never thought of that , ”
172271	172282	172269	172269	Birkin	364	“ But no , the wood ’s too thin everywhere . ”
172283	172287	172289	172289	Ursula	364	“ You see , ”
172297	172333	172291	172291	her	364	“ We are just going to get married , and we thought we ’d buy things . Then we decided , just now , that we would n’t have furniture , we ’d go abroad . ”
172407	172417	172419	172421	the city girl	3453	“ It ’s all right to be some folks , ”
172468	172476	172477	172477	he	3452	“ Cawsts something to chynge your mind , ”
172486	172493	172495	172495	Birkin	364	“ Only ten shillings this time , ”
172514	172524	172525	172525	he	3452	“ Cheap at ’ arf a quid , guvnor , ”
172528	172534	172525	172525	he	3452	“ Not like getting divawced . ”
172535	172542	172544	172544	Birkin	364	“ We ’re not married yet , ”
172546	172555	172557	172559	the young woman	3397	“ No , no more are n’t we , ”
172562	172571	172557	172559	the young woman	3397	“ But we shall be , a Saturday . ”
172626	172632	172634	172634	Birkin	364	“ Good luck to you , ”
172636	172641	172643	172645	the young woman	3397	“ Same to you , ”
172652	172661	172662	172662	Birkin	364	“ When ’s yours coming off , then ? ”
172668	172677	172678	172678	he	3452	“ It ’s for the lady to say , ”
172681	172693	172678	172678	he	3452	“ We go to the registrar the moment she ’s ready . ”
172703	172708	172710	172712	the young man	676	“ No ’ urry , ”
172717	172729	172731	172733	the young woman	3397	“ Oh , do n’t break your neck to get there , ”
172735	172748	172731	172733	the young woman	3397	“ ’ Slike when you ’re dead — you’re long time married . ”
172760	172770	172772	172772	Birkin	364	“ The longer the better , let us hope , ”
172774	172781	172783	172785	the young man	676	“ That ’s it , guvnor , ”
172788	172801	172783	172785	the young man	676	“ Enjoy it while it larsts — niver whip a dead donkey . ”
172802	172810	172812	172814	the young woman	3397	“ Only when he ’s shamming dead , ”
172827	172835	172836	172836	he	3465	“ Aw , there ’s a difference , ”
172840	172846	172848	172848	Birkin	364	“ What about the chair ? ”
172850	172856	172858	172859	the woman	873	“ Yes , all right , ”
172879	172884	172886	172886	Birkin	364	“ That ’s it , ”
172888	172902	172886	172886	Birkin	364	“ Will you take it with you , or have the address altered . ”
172903	172924	172941	172941	he	297	“ Oh , Fred can carry it . Make him do what he can for the dear old ’ ome . ”
172925	172933	172935	172935	Fred	297	“ Mike use of ’ i m , ”
172960	172969	172970	172970	he	297	“ ’ Ere ’s mother ’s cosy chair , ”
172973	172978	172980	172980	he	297	“ Warnts a cushion . ”
172989	172998	173000	173000	Ursula	364	“ Do n’t you think it ’s pretty ? ”
173002	173008	173010	173012	the young woman	3397	“ Oh , I do , ”
173014	173030	173032	173034	the young man	676	“ ’ Ave a sit in it , you ’ll wish you ’d kept it , ”
173049	173053	173054	173054	she	364	“ Awfully comfortable , ”
173057	173066	173054	173054	she	364	“ But rather hard . You try it . ”
173103	173109	173111	173113	the young woman	3397	“ Do n’t spoil him , ”
173115	173130	173111	173113	the young woman	3397	“ He ’s not used to arm - chairs , ’ e is n’t . ”
173144	173152	173131	173133	The young man	676	“ Only warnts legs on ’ is . ”
173163	173177	173157	173159	The young woman	3397	“ Thank you for the chair — it’ll last till it gives way . ”
173178	173185	173187	173189	the young man	676	“ Keep it for an ornyment , ”
173191	173198	173200	173200	Ursula	364	“ Good afternoon — good afternoon , ”
173204	173209	173211	173213	the young man	676	“ Goo’-luck to you , ”
173351	173357	173359	173359	Ursula	364	“ How strange they are ! ”
173361	173366	173367	173367	he	676	“ Children of men , ”
173370	173386	173367	173367	he	676	“ They remind me of Jesus : ‘ The meek shall inherit the earth . ’ ”
173387	173395	173397	173397	Ursula	364	“ But they are n’t the meek , ”
173399	173412	173413	173413	he	676	“ Yes , I do n’t know why , but they are , ”
173444	173454	173455	173455	she	364	“ And are they going to inherit the earth ? ”
173458	173463	173455	173455	she	364	“ Yes — they . ”
173464	173473	173474	173474	she	364	“ Then what are we going to do ? ”
173477	173493	173474	173474	she	364	“ We ’re not like them — are we ? We ’re not the meek ? ”
173494	173509	173455	173455	she	364	“ No . We ’ve got to live in the chinks they leave us . ”
173510	173514	173516	173516	Ursula	364	“ How horrible ! ”
173518	173528	173516	173516	Ursula	364	“ I do n’t want to live in chinks . ”
173529	173534	173535	173535	he	3490	“ Do n’t worry , ”
173538	173563	173535	173535	he	3490	“ They are the children of men , they like market - places and street - corners best . That leaves plenty of chinks . ”
173564	173569	173570	173570	she	364	“ All the world , ”
173573	173581	173570	173570	she	364	“ Ah no — but some room . ”
173645	173654	173656	173656	Ursula	364	“ I do n’t mind it even then , ”
173666	173673	173656	173656	Ursula	364	“ It does n’t concern me . ”
173674	173680	173681	173681	he	3490	“ No more it does , ”
173688	173709	173681	173681	he	3490	“ One need n’t see . One goes one ’s way . In my world it is sunny and spacious — ”
173710	173721	173722	173722	she	364	“ It is , my love , is n’t it ? ”
173745	173758	173759	173759	he	3490	“ And we will wander about on the face of the earth , ”
173762	173775	173759	173759	he	3490	“ and we ’ll look at the world beyond just this bit . ”
173794	173804	173805	173805	she	364	“ I do n’t want to inherit the earth , ”
173808	173817	173805	173805	she	364	“ I do n’t want to inherit anything . ”
173825	173835	173818	173818	He	3490	“ Neither do I. I want to be disinherited . ”
173842	173850	173851	173851	she	364	“ We wo n’t care about anything , ”
173861	173874	173875	173875	she	364	“ And we ’ll be married , and have done with them , ”
173882	173893	173894	173894	she	364	“ It ’s one way of getting rid of everything , ”
173897	173902	173894	173894	she	364	“ to get married . ”
173903	173913	173914	173914	he	3490	“ And one way of accepting the whole world , ”
173917	173925	173926	173926	she	364	“ A whole other world , yes , ”
173930	173939	173940	173940	he	3490	“ Perhaps there ’s Gerald — and Gudrun — ”
173943	173953	173954	173954	she	364	“ If there is there is , you see , ”
173957	173975	173954	173954	she	364	“ It ’s no good our worrying . We ca n’t really alter them , can we ? ”
173976	173979	173980	173980	he	3490	“ No , ”
173983	174000	173980	173980	he	3490	“ One has no right to try — not with the best intentions in the world . ”
174001	174009	174010	174010	she	364	“ Do you try to force them ? ”
174013	174016	174017	174017	he	3490	“ Perhaps , ”
174020	174037	174017	174017	he	3490	“ Why should I want him to be free , if it is n’t his business ? ”
174044	174054	174055	174055	she	364	“ We ca n’t make him happy , anyhow , ”
174058	174068	174055	174055	she	364	“ He ’d have to be it of himself . ”
174069	174073	174074	174074	he	3490	“ I know , ”
174077	174090	174074	174074	he	3490	“ But we want other people with us , do n’t we ? ”
174091	174096	174097	174097	she	364	“ Why should we ? ”
174100	174106	174107	174107	he	3490	“ I do n’t know , ”
174111	174123	174107	174107	he	3490	“ One has a hankering after a sort of further fellowship . ”
174124	174128	174129	174129	she	364	“ But why ? ”
174132	174147	174129	174129	she	364	“ Why should you hanker after other people ? Why should you need them ? ”
174160	174170	174171	174171	he	3490	“ Does it end with just our two selves ? ”
174176	174203	174171	174171	he	3490	“ Yes — what more do you want ? If anybody likes to come along , let them . But why must you run after them ? ”
174211	174215	174216	174216	he	3490	“ You see , ”
174219	174239	174216	174216	he	3490	“ I always imagine our being really happy with some few other people — a little freedom with people . ”
174246	174299	174240	174240	She	3500	“ Yes , one does want that . But it must happen . You ca n’t do anything for it with your will . You always seem to think you can force the flowers to come out . People must love us because they love us — you ca n’t make them . ”
174300	174304	174305	174305	he	3490	“ I know , ”
174308	174338	174305	174305	he	3490	“ But must one take no steps at all ? Must one just go as if one were alone in the world — the only creature in the world ? ”
174339	174345	174346	174346	she	3500	“ You ’ve got me , ”
174349	174449	174346	174346	she	3500	“ Why should you need others ? Why must you force people to agree with you ? Why ca n’t you be single by yourself , as you are always saying ? You try to bully Gerald — as you tried to bully Hermione . You must learn to be alone . And it ’s so horrid of you . You ’ve got me . And yet you want to force other people to love you as well . You do try to bully them to love you . And even then , you do n’t want their love . ”
174458	174463	174464	174464	he	3501	“ Do n’t I ? ”
174467	174543	174464	174464	he	3501	“ It ’s the problem I ca n’t solve . I know I want a perfect and complete relationship with you : and we ’ve nearly got it — we really have . But beyond that . Do I want a real , ultimate relationship with Gerald ? Do I want a final almost extra - human relationship with him — a relationship in the ultimate of me and him — or do n’t I ? ”
174624	174635	174611	174611	Ursula	255	“ Rupert and I are going to be married tomorrow . ”
174643	174647	174648	174648	he	583	“ You what ? ”
174651	174654	174656	174656	Gudrun	160	“ Tomorrow ! ”
174658	174661	174663	174664	the mother	565	“ Indeed ! ”
174677	174681	174683	174684	her father	583	“ Married tomorrow ! ”
174687	174694	174683	174684	her father	583	“ What are you talking about . ”
174695	174698	174700	174700	Ursula	255	“ Yes , ”
174702	174706	174700	174700	Ursula	255	“ Why not ? ”
174719	174734	174712	174712	her	3502	“ Everything is all right — we shall go to the registrar ’s office — ”
174751	174756	174758	174758	Gudrun	160	“ Really , Ursula ! ”
174760	174772	174774	174775	the mother	565	“ Might we ask why there has been all this secrecy ? ”
174780	174786	174788	174788	Ursula	255	“ But there has n’t , ”
174790	174794	174788	174788	Ursula	255	“ You knew . ”
174795	174799	174802	174803	the father	646	“ Who knew ? ”
174805	174820	174802	174803	the father	646	“ Who knew ? What do you mean by your ‘ you knew ’ ? ”
174836	174842	174843	174843	she	3502	“ Of course you knew , ”
174847	174857	174843	174843	she	3502	“ You knew we were going to get married . ”
174864	174892	174843	174843	she	3502	“ We knew you were going to get married , did we ? Knew ! Why , does anybody know anything about you , you shifty bitch ! ”
174893	174896	174898	174898	Gudrun	160	“ Father ! ”
174926	174938	174939	174939	she	3502	“ But is n’t it a fearfully sudden decision , Ursula ? ”
174942	174948	174950	174950	Ursula	255	“ No , not really , ”
174958	174999	174950	174950	Ursula	255	“ He ’s been wanting me to agree for weeks — he ’s had the licence ready . Only I — I was n’t ready in myself . Now I am ready — is there anything to be disagreeable about ? ”
175000	175004	175006	175006	Gudrun	160	“ Certainly not , ”
175016	175027	175006	175006	Gudrun	160	“ You are perfectly free to do as you like . ”
175028	175053	175054	175054	he	3517	“ ‘ Ready in yourself’—yourself , that ’s all that matters , is n’t it ! ‘ I was n’t ready in myself , ’ ”
175060	175075	175054	175054	he	3517	“ You and yourself , you ’re of some importance , are n’t you ? ”
175093	175099	175100	175100	she	3502	“ I am to myself , ”
175107	175131	175100	175100	she	3502	“ I know I am not to anybody else . You only wanted to bully me — you never cared for my happiness . ”
175146	175159	175161	175162	her mother	770	“ Ursula , what are you saying ? Keep your tongue still , ”
175176	175183	175184	175184	she	3502	“ No , I wo n’t , ”
175187	175221	175184	175184	she	3502	“ I wo n’t hold my tongue and be bullied . What does it matter which day I get married — what does it matter ! It does n’t affect anybody but myself . ”
175236	175241	175242	175242	he	3517	“ Does n’t it ? ”
175254	175261	175262	175262	she	3502	“ No , how can it ? ”
175269	175287	175288	175288	he	3517	“ It does n’t matter to me then , what you do — what becomes of you ? ”
175309	175312	175314	175314	Ursula	255	“ No , ”
175324	175330	175316	175317	Her father	583	“ You only want to — ”
175350	175353	175354	175354	he	3517	“ What ? ”
175357	175361	175362	175362	she	3502	“ Bully me , ”
175394	175397	175399	175399	Gudrun	160	“ Father ! ”
175405	175410	175399	175399	Gudrun	160	“ it is impossible ! ”
175437	175442	175443	175443	she	3502	“ It ’s true , ”
175460	175479	175443	175443	she	3502	“ What has your love meant , what did it ever mean?—bullying , and denial — it did — ”
175572	175585	175560	175561	the mother	565	“ Well , you should n’t take so much notice of her . ”
175623	175628	175629	175629	she	3502	“ Good - bye ! ”
175642	175647	175629	175629	she	3502	“ I ’m going . ”
175825	175839	175815	175815	she	3502	“ Good evening ! Is Mr Birkin in ? Can I see him ? ”
175840	175853	175854	175854	Ursula	255	“ Yes , he ’s in . He ’s in his study . ”
175870	175873	175874	175874	he	3538	“ Hello ! ”
175912	175919	175920	175920	she	3502	“ Do I look a sight ? ”
175925	175933	175934	175934	he	3538	“ No — why ? Come in , ”
175973	175979	175980	175980	he	3538	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
176004	176010	176011	176011	he	3538	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
176042	176049	176050	176050	he	3538	“ What is it , then ? ”
176074	176079	176080	176080	she	3502	“ Father hit me , ”
176098	176102	176103	176103	he	3538	“ What for ? ”
176130	176133	176134	176134	he	3538	“ Why ? ”
176155	176172	176146	176146	She	3502	“ Because I said I was going to be married tomorrow , and he bullied me . ”
176173	176180	176181	176181	Her	3502	“ Why did he bully you ? ”
176198	176221	176222	176222	she	3502	“ Because I said he did n’t care — and he does n’t , it ’s only his domineeringness that ’s hurt — ”
176266	176273	176274	176274	he	3538	“ It is n’t quite true , ”
176277	176288	176274	176274	he	3538	“ And even so , you should n’t say it . ”
176289	176298	176299	176299	she	3502	“ It is true — it is true , ”
176302	176335	176299	176299	she	3502	“ and I wo n’t be bullied by his pretending it ’s love — when it isn’t — he does n’t care , how can he — no , he ca n’t — ”
176347	176360	176362	176362	Birkin	169	“ Then you should n’t rouse him , if he ca n’t , ”
176365	176375	176376	176376	she	3502	“ And I have loved him , I have , ”
176379	176398	176376	176376	she	3502	“ I ’ve loved him always , and he ’s always done this to me , he has — ”
176399	176410	176411	176411	he	3538	“ It ’s been a love of opposition , then , ”
176414	176429	176411	176411	he	3538	“ Never mind — it will be all right . It ’s nothing desperate . ”
176430	176433	176434	176434	she	3502	“ Yes , ”
176437	176444	176434	176434	she	3502	“ it is , it is . ”
176445	176448	176411	176411	he	3538	“ Why ? ”
176449	176457	176411	176411	he	3538	“ I shall never see him again — ”
176458	176481	176482	176482	He	3538	“ Not immediately . Do n’t cry , you had to break with him , it had to be — don’t cry . ”
176501	176506	176507	176507	he	3538	“ Do n’t cry , ”
176510	176517	176507	176507	he	3538	“ do n’t cry any more . ”
176548	176555	176556	176556	she	3502	“ Do n’t you want me ? ”
176559	176563	176538	176538	she	3502	“ Want you ? ”
176578	176587	176588	176588	she	3502	“ Do you wish I had n’t come ? ”
176603	176606	176607	176607	he	3538	“ No , ”
176610	176630	176607	176607	he	3538	“ I wish there had n’t been the violence — so much ugliness — but perhaps it was inevitable . ”
176641	176648	176649	176649	she	3502	“ But where shall I stay ? ”
176661	176667	176668	176668	he	3538	“ Here , with me , ”
176671	176684	176655	176655	He	3538	“ We ’re married as much today as we shall be tomorrow . ”
176685	176688	176715	176715	his	3538	“ But — ”
176689	176696	176697	176697	he	3538	“ I ’ll tell Mrs Varley , ”
176700	176705	176697	176697	he	3538	“ Never mind now . ”
176743	176749	176750	176750	she	3502	“ Do I look ugly ? ”
176768	176771	176772	176772	he	3538	“ No , ”
176775	176778	176772	176772	he	3538	“ fortunately . ”
176979	176984	176985	176985	he	3538	“ I love you , ”
177249	177260	177247	177247	He	3538	“ Your nose is beautiful , your chin is adorable . ”
177283	177292	177276	177276	he	3538	“ I love you , I love you , ”
177422	177427	177420	177420	I	0	“ I love you , ”
177603	177608	177609	177609	Gerald	255	“ You are happy ? ”
177617	177621	177622	177622	she	3502	“ Very happy ! ”
177632	177640	177622	177622	she	3502	“ Yes , one can see it . ”
177641	177645	177647	177647	Ursula	255	“ Can one ? ”
177661	177667	177651	177651	He	255	“ Oh yes , plainly . ”
177677	177689	177672	177672	She	3502	“ And can you see that Rupert is happy as well ? ”
177699	177703	177704	177704	he	255	“ Oh yes , ”
177707	177710	177704	177704	he	255	“ Really ! ”
177711	177715	177716	177716	He	255	“ Oh yes . ”
177755	177765	177766	177766	she	3502	“ Why do n’t you be happy as well ? ”
177769	177777	177766	177766	she	3502	“ You could be just the same . ”
177783	177787	177788	177788	he	255	“ With Gudrun ? ”
177791	177794	177795	177795	she	3502	“ Yes ! ”
177824	177838	177839	177839	he	255	“ You think Gudrun would have me , and we should be happy ? ”
177842	177849	177850	177850	she	3502	“ Yes , I ’m sure ! ”
177872	177880	177881	177881	she	3502	“ Oh , I ’m so glad , ”
177887	177893	177894	177894	he	255	“ What makes you glad ? ”
177897	177902	177903	177903	she	3502	“ For her sake , ”
177906	177919	177894	177894	he	255	“ I ’m sure you’d — you’re the right man for her . ”
177920	177924	177925	177925	he	255	“ You are ? ”
177928	177939	177925	177925	he	255	“ And do you think she would agree with you ? ”
177940	177944	177945	177945	she	3502	“ Oh yes ! ”
177957	177989	177990	177990	She	3502	“ Though Gudrun is n’t so very simple , is she ? One does n’t know her in five minutes , does one ? She ’s not like me in that . ”
178003	178013	177990	177990	She	3502	“ You think she ’s not much like you ? ”
178022	178044	178017	178017	She	3502	“ Oh , in many ways she is . But I never know what she will do when anything new comes . ”
178045	178050	178052	178052	Gerald	255	“ You do n’t ? ”
178066	178086	178087	178087	he	255	“ I was going to ask her , in any case , to go away with me at Christmas , ”
178098	178111	178087	178087	he	255	“ Go away with you ? For a time , you mean ? ”
178112	178119	178120	178120	he	255	“ As long as she likes , ”
178136	178140	178142	178142	Ursula	255	“ Of course , ”
178146	178161	178142	178142	Ursula	255	“ she might just be willing to rush into marriage . You can see . ”
178162	178165	178167	178167	Gerald	255	“ Yes , ”
178169	178199	178167	178167	Gerald	255	“ I can see . But in case she won’t — do you think she would go abroad with me for a few days — or for a fortnight ? ”
178200	178204	178206	178206	Ursula	255	“ Oh yes , ”
178208	178214	178206	178206	Ursula	255	“ I ’d ask her . ”
178215	178225	178167	178167	Gerald	255	“ Do you think we might all go together ? ”
178226	178231	178206	178206	Ursula	255	“ All of us ? ”
178239	178251	178233	178233	Ursula	255	“ It would be rather fun , do n’t you think ? ”
178252	178256	178257	178257	he	255	“ Great fun , ”
178260	178267	178269	178269	Ursula	255	“ And then you could see , ”
178271	178274	178269	178269	Ursula	255	“ What ? ”
178275	178296	178297	178297	She	3565	“ How things went . I think it is best to take the honeymoon before the wedding — don’t you ? ”
178307	178312	178313	178313	he	255	“ In certain cases , ”
178316	178328	178313	178313	he	255	“ I ’d rather it were so in my own case . ”
178329	178333	178335	178335	Ursula	255	“ Would you ! ”
178340	178353	178354	178354	Birkin	169	“ Yes , perhaps you ’re right . One should please oneself . ”
178370	178373	178375	178375	Birkin	169	“ Gudrun ! ”
178377	178414	178375	178375	Birkin	169	“ She ’s a born mistress , just as Gerald is a born lover — amant en titre . If as somebody says all women are either wives or mistresses , then Gudrun is a mistress . ”
178415	178424	178426	178426	Ursula	255	“ And all men either lovers or husbands , ”
178428	178434	178426	178426	Ursula	255	“ But why not both ? ”
178435	178442	178443	178443	he	255	“ The one excludes the other , ”
178446	178453	178455	178455	Ursula	255	“ Then I want a lover , ”
178457	178463	178464	178464	he	255	“ No you do n’t , ”
178467	178472	178473	178473	she	3566	“ But I do , ”
178631	178643	178645	178645	Ursula	255	“ I do n’t believe I dare have come in alone , ”
178647	178652	178645	178645	Ursula	255	“ It frightens me . ”
178653	178656	178658	178658	Gudrun	160	“ Ursula ! ”
178660	178695	178658	178658	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t it amazing ! Can you believe you lived in this place and never felt it ? How I lived here a day without dying of terror , I can not conceive ! ”
178848	178857	178859	178859	Ursula	255	“ Imagine that we passed our days here ! ”
178861	178865	178867	178867	Gudrun	160	“ I know , ”
178869	178889	178867	178867	Gudrun	160	“ It is too appalling . What must we be like , if we are the contents of this ! ”
178890	178893	178895	178895	Ursula	255	“ Vile ! ”
178897	178902	178895	178895	Ursula	255	“ It really is . ”
178911	178912	178867	178867	Gudrun	160	“ Vogue”—half
179048	179057	179059	179059	Ursula	255	“ A cheerful sight , are n’t they ? ”
179068	179072	179074	179074	Gudrun	160	“ Very cheerful , ”
179243	179246	179248	179248	Ursula	255	“ Really , ”
179250	179261	179248	179248	Ursula	255	“ this room could n’t be sacred , could it ? ”
179270	179273	179274	179274	she	160	“ Impossible , ”
179277	179319	179262	179262	Gudrun	160	“ When I think of their lives — father ’s and mother ’s , their love , and their marriage , and all of us children , and our bringing - up — would you have such a life , Prune ? ”
179320	179327	179248	179248	Ursula	255	“ I would n’t , Ursula . ”
179328	179372	179248	179248	Ursula	255	“ It all seems so nothing — their two lives — there ’s no meaning in it . Really , if they had not met , and not married , and not lived together — it would n’t have mattered , would it ? ”
179373	179382	179384	179384	Gudrun	160	“ Of course — you ca n’t tell , ”
179386	179404	179405	179405	she	160	“ No . But if I thought my life was going to be like it — Prune , ”
179411	179416	179405	179405	she	160	“ I should run . ”
179425	179446	179448	179448	Gudrun	160	“ As a matter of fact , one can not contemplate the ordinary life — one can not contemplate it , ”
179450	179626	179448	179448	Gudrun	160	“ With you , Ursula , it is quite different . You will be out of it all , with Birkin . He ’s a special case . But with the ordinary man , who has his life fixed in one place , marriage is just impossible . There may be , and there are , thousands of women who want it , and could conceive of nothing else . But the very thought of it sends me mad . One must be free , above all , one must be free . One may forfeit everything else , but one must be free — one must not become 7 , Pinchbeck Street — or Somerset Drive — or Shortlands . No man will be sufficient to make that good — no man ! To marry , one must have a free lance , or nothing , a comrade - in - arms , a Glücksritter . A man with a position in the social world — well , it is just impossible , impossible ! ”
179627	179636	179638	179638	Ursula	255	“ What a lovely word — a Glücksritter ! ”
179640	179650	179638	179638	Ursula	255	“ So much nicer than a soldier of fortune . ”
179651	179658	179660	179660	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , is n’t it ? ”
179662	179686	179660	179660	Gudrun	160	“ I ’d tilt the world with a Glücksritter . But a home , an establishment ! Ursula , what would it mean?—think ! ”
179687	179691	179693	179693	Ursula	255	“ I know , ”
179695	179708	179693	179693	Ursula	255	“ We ’ve had one home — that ’s enough for me . ”
179709	179713	179715	179715	Gudrun	160	“ Quite enough , ”
179717	179726	179728	179728	Ursula	255	“ The little grey home in the west , ”
179731	179740	179742	179742	Gudrun	160	“ Does n’t it sound grey , too , ”
179796	179799	179800	179800	he	3603	“ Hello ! ”
179824	179831	179832	179832	she	3600	“ Hello ! Here we are , ”
179844	179851	179852	179852	he	3603	“ This is a ghostly situation , ”
179855	179880	179882	179882	Gudrun	160	“ These houses do n’t have ghosts — they’ve never had any personality , and only a place with personality can have a ghost , ”
179884	179897	179882	179882	Gudrun	160	“ I suppose so . Are you both weeping over the past ? ”
179898	179902	179904	179904	Gudrun	160	“ We are , ”
179911	179926	179927	179927	she	3600	“ Not weeping that it ’s gone , but weeping that it ever was , ”
179930	179933	179934	179934	he	3603	“ Oh , ”
179972	179988	179990	179990	Ursula	255	“ Gudrun says she could not bear to be married and put into a house , ”
180007	180010	180011	180011	he	3603	“ Well , ”
180014	180029	180011	180011	he	3603	“ if you know beforehand you could n’t stand it , you ’re safe . ”
180030	180033	180035	180035	Gudrun	160	“ Quite ! ”
180037	180074	180076	180076	Ursula	255	“ Why does every woman think her aim in life is to have a hubby and a little grey home in the west ? Why is this the goal of life ? Why should it be ? ”
180078	180088	180090	180090	Birkin	169	“ Il faut avoir le respect de ses bêtises , ”
180092	180109	180111	180111	Ursula	255	“ But you need n’t have the respect for the bêtise before you ’ve committed it , ”
180113	180122	180111	180111	Ursula	255	“ Ah then , des bêtises du papa ? ”
180123	180129	180131	180131	Gudrun	160	“ Et de la maman , ”
180134	180139	180141	180141	Ursula	255	“ Et des voisins , ”
180194	180210	180212	180212	Gudrun	160	“ Do you mind stopping at Coulsons . I have to leave the key there , ”
180214	180217	180219	180219	Birkin	169	“ Right , ”
180623	180626	180621	180621	she	160	“ Home . ”
180636	180645	180647	180647	Ursula	255	“ Come with us to tea — do , ”
180660	180670	180672	180672	Gudrun	160	“ Thanks awfully — but I must go in — ”
180703	180715	180717	180717	Ursula	255	“ Do come — yes , it would be so nice , ”
180719	180736	180717	180717	Ursula	255	“ I ’m awfully sorry — I should love to — but I can’t — really — ”
180746	180752	180754	180754	Ursula	255	“ Ca n’t you really ! ”
180759	180767	180769	180769	Gudrun	160	“ No , really I ca n’t , ”
180780	180787	180789	180789	Birkin	169	“ All right , are you ? ”
180791	180794	180796	180796	Gudrun	160	“ Quite ! ”
180798	180803	180796	180796	Gudrun	160	“ Good - night ! ”
180804	180809	180810	180810	they	3634	“ Good - night , ”
180813	180824	180826	180826	Birkin	169	“ Come whenever you like , we shall be glad , ”
180828	180834	180836	180836	Gudrun	160	“ Thank you very much , ”
180977	180982	180983	180983	She	160	“ glad - eye . ”
181146	181154	181156	181156	Gudrun	160	“ Are n’t you fearfully happy here ? ”
181200	181205	181156	181156	Gudrun	160	” she said aloud . “
181224	181232	181233	181233	Ursula	255	” And it seemed to her perfect . “
181235	181249	181233	181233	Ursula	255	” she said at length , in a voice of question and detachment , “
181266	181267	181270	181270	he	255	” “
181276	181303	181270	181270	he	255	” A deep flush dyed Gudrun ’s cheek . She was silent a moment , as if taken aback , and not knowing what to say . “
181310	181316	181307	181307	you	255	” she said at last , “
181322	181326	181329	181329	him	255	” Ursula laughed . “
181333	181373	181329	181329	him	255	” she said . Gudrun was silent . It was evident that , whilst she was almost mortified by Gerald ’s taking the liberty of making such a suggestion to Birkin , yet the idea itself attracted her strongly . “
181386	181390	181383	181383	I	0	” said Ursula , “
181405	181432	181398	181398	I	0	” Gudrun did not reply for some moments . She had still to get over the feeling of insult at the liberty taken with her freedom . “
181442	181446	181447	181447	He	255	” she asked . “
181456	181469	181447	181447	He	255	” said Ursula . Again Gudrun looked down , and was silent . “
181477	181508	181472	181472	you	255	” said Ursula , tentatively . She was never quite sure how many defences Gudrun was having round herself . Gudrun raised her face with difficulty and held it averted . “
181521	181525	181509	181509	I	0	” she replied . “
181587	181593	181579	181579	I	0	” She used the French word “
181596	181649	181579	181579	I	0	” Her eyes flashed , her soft face was flushed and sullen . Ursula looked on , rather frightened , frightened most of all because she thought Gudrun seemed rather common , really like a little type . But she had not the courage quite to think this — not right out . “
181653	181659	181579	181579	I	0	” she cried , stammering . “
181703	181723	181693	181693	they	3646	” Gudrun flushed deeper . She could not bear it that Gerald gave her away — even to Birkin . “
181740	181748	181726	181726	you	0	” she asked , with deep anger . “
181752	181756	181726	181726	you	0	” said Ursula . “
181812	181834	181809	181810	such cowards	3652	” But Gudrun was still silent with anger . She wanted the absolute secrecy kept , with regard to her movements . “
181840	181844	181809	181810	such cowards	3652	” said Ursula . “
181882	181900	181878	181878	he	255	” Gudrun ’s mouth was still closed , sullen and ugly . She opened it at length . “
181910	181914	181902	181902	you	0	” she asked . “
181949	181957	181998	181998	you	0	” Through Gudrun ’s mind went the angry thought—“they
181961	181962	181998	181998	you	0	” “
181965	181970	181998	181998	you	0	” she said aloud , “
181981	181982	181983	181983	I	0	” “
182008	182009	181998	181998	you	0	” “
182013	182024	181998	181998	you	0	” said Gudrun , sarcastically . Ursula was put out . “
182028	182032	181998	181998	you	0	” she said , “
182052	182053	182035	182035	Gerald	255	” “
182060	182064	182054	182054	I	0	” said Gudrun , “
182076	182077	182079	182079	he	255	” “
182081	182085	182079	182079	he	255	” said Ursula . “
182092	182093	182089	182089	you	0	” “
182102	182112	182094	182094	I	0	” said Gudrun coldly . Now Ursula was silent . “
182115	182126	182094	182094	I	0	” she said at last , with a doubtful laugh , “
182137	182647	182094	182094	I	0	” At which Gudrun looked more glum . Christmas drew near , all four prepared for flight . Birkin and Ursula were busy packing their few personal things , making them ready to be sent off , to whatever country and whatever place they might choose at last . Gudrun was very much excited . She loved to be on the wing . She and Gerald , being ready first , set off via London and Paris to Innsbruck , where they would meet Ursula and Birkin . In London they stayed one night . They went to the music - hall , and afterwards to the Pompadour Café . Gudrun hated the Café , yet she always went back to it , as did most of the artists of her acquaintance . She loathed its atmosphere of petty vice and petty jealousy and petty art . Yet she always called in again , when she was in town . It was as if she had to return to this small , slow , central whirlpool of disintegration and dissolution : just give it a look . She sat with Gerald drinking some sweetish liqueur , and staring with black , sullen looks at the various groups of people at the tables . She would greet nobody , but young men nodded to her frequently , with a kind of sneering familiarity . She cut them all . And it gave her pleasure to sit there , cheeks flushed , eyes black and sullen , seeing them all objectively , as put away from her , like creatures in some menagerie of apish degraded souls . God , what a foul crew they were ! Her blood beat black and thick in her veins with rage and loathing . Yet she must sit and watch , watch . One or two people came to speak to her . From every side of the Café , eyes turned half furtively , half jeeringly at her , men looking over their shoulders , women under their hats . The old crowd was there , Carlyon in his corner with his pupils and his girl , Halliday and Libidnikov and the Pussum — they were all there . Gudrun watched Gerald . She watched his eyes linger a moment on Halliday , on Halliday ’s party . These last were on the look - out — they nodded to him , he nodded again . They giggled and whispered among themselves . Gerald watched them with the steady twinkle in his eyes . They were urging the Pussum to something . She at last rose . She was wearing a curious dress of dark silk splashed and spattered with different colours , a curious motley effect . She was thinner , her eyes were perhaps hotter , more disintegrated . Otherwise she was just the same . Gerald watched her with the same steady twinkle in his eyes as she came across . She held out her thin brown hand to him . “
182652	182700	182650	182650	you	3658	” she said . He shook hands with her , but remained seated , and let her stand near him , against the table . She nodded blackly to Gudrun , whom she did not know to speak to , but well enough by sight and reputation . “
182706	182710	182712	182712	you	3658	” said Gerald . “
182714	182715	182712	182712	you	3658	” “
182726	182727	182724	182724	Wupert	212	” “
182737	182738	182730	182730	He	212	” “
182753	182754	182749	182749	him	212	” “
182763	182773	182759	182759	he	212	” The Pussum ’s eyes had a hot flash . “
182792	182793	182785	182785	he	212	” “
182800	182801	182785	182785	he	212	” “
182809	182810	182804	182804	He	212	” “
182813	182814	182804	182804	He	212	” “
182826	182855	182819	182819	you	3658	” This last was in a tone of challenge . The Pussum let it be known by her tone , that she was aware of Gudrun ’s listening . “
182865	182869	182858	182858	he	212	” replied Gerald . “
182876	182913	182874	182874	he	212	” pursued the Pussum . This was received in silence . There was an ugly , mocking persistence in the small , beautiful figure of the short - haired girl , as she stood near Gerald . “
182921	182925	182915	182915	you	0	” she asked . “
182929	182930	182915	182915	you	0	” “
182945	182946	182937	182937	you	0	” “
182950	182951	182937	182937	you	0	” “
182962	182970	182956	182956	I	0	” Then came her touch of diablerie . “
182977	182978	182971	182971	You	0	” “
182985	183002	182971	182971	You	0	” Gerald was quite calm and easy , a spark of satiric amusement in his eye . “
183010	183030	183004	183004	you	0	” This was a direct blow for Gudrun , spoken in a level , toneless voice of callous ease . “
183033	183040	183004	183004	you	0	” he replied , quite colourlessly . “
183063	183064	183054	183054	You	0	” “
183068	183076	183054	183054	You	0	” he said . She nodded them both “
183113	183123	183104	183104	They	3664	“ He wo n’t come over;—he is otherwise engaged , ”
183140	183148	183150	183150	Gudrun	160	“ Is she a friend of yours ? ”
183157	183168	183169	183169	he	255	“ I ’ve stayed at Halliday ’s flat with Birkin , ”
183255	183266	183267	183267	Halliday	204	“ Oh , do n’t make me think of Birkin , ”
183271	183297	183298	183298	He	204	“ He makes me perfectly sick . He is as bad as Jesus . ‘ Lord , what must I do to be saved ! ’ ”
183304	183309	183315	183316	the Russian	221	“ Do you remember , ”
183318	183332	183315	183316	the Russian	221	“ the letters he used to send . ‘ Desire is holy — ’ ”
183333	183337	183339	183339	Halliday	204	“ Oh yes ! ”
183341	183364	183365	183365	He	204	“ Oh , how perfectly splendid . Why , I ’ve got one in my pocket . I ’m sure I have . ”
183375	183387	183365	183365	He	204	“ I ’m sure I’ve — hic ! Oh dear!—got one . ”
183395	183421	183390	183390	Gudrun	160	“ Oh yes , how perfectly — hic!—splendid ! Do n’t make me laugh , Pussum , it gives me the hiccup . Hic ! — ”
183426	183435	183436	183437	the Pussum	4973	“ What did he say in that one ? ”
183478	183537	183563	183563	his	215	“ Wait — oh do wait ! No - o , I wo n’t give it to you , I ’ll read it aloud . I ’ll read you the choice bits,—hic ! Oh dear ! Do you think if I drink water it would take off this hiccup ? Hic ! Oh , I feel perfectly helpless . ”
183538	183558	183560	183560	Maxim	215	“ Is n’t that the letter about uniting the dark and the light — and the Flux of Corruption ? ”
183569	183574	183576	183577	the Pussum	211	“ I believe so , ”
183579	183593	183594	183594	Halliday	204	“ Oh is it ? I ’d forgotten — hic!—it was that one , ”
183601	183628	183629	183629	he	204	“ Hic ! Oh yes . How perfectly splendid ! This is one of the best . ‘ There is a phase in every race — ’ ”
183648	183677	183678	183678	he	204	“ ‘ When the desire for destruction overcomes every other desire . In the individual , this desire is ultimately a desire for destruction in the self’—hic ! — ”

183717	183727	183729	183730	the Pussum	4973	“ There ’s not much to destroy in him , ”
183732	183750	183729	183730	the Pussum	4973	“ He ’s so thin already , there ’s only a fag - end to start on . ”
183751	183772	183774	183774	Halliday	204	“ Oh , is n’t it beautiful ! I love reading it ! I believe it has cured my hiccup ! ”
183776	183836	183774	183774	Halliday	204	“ Do let me go on . ‘ It is a desire for the reduction process in oneself , a reducing back to the origin , a return along the Flux of Corruption , to the original rudimentary conditions of being — ! ’ Oh , but I do think it is wonderful . It almost supersedes the Bible — ”
183837	183844	183846	183847	the Russian	221	“ Yes — Flux of Corruption , ”
183849	183855	183846	183847	the Russian	221	“ I remember that phrase . ”
183856	183866	183868	183869	the Pussum	211	“ Oh , he was always talking about Corruption , ”
183871	183887	183868	183869	the Pussum	211	“ He must be corrupt himself , to have it so much on his mind . ”
183888	183891	183893	183894	the Russian	221	“ Exactly ! ”
183896	184070	183893	183894	the Russian	221	“ Do let me go on ! Oh , this is a perfectly wonderful piece ! But do listen to this . ‘ And in the great retrogression , the reducing back of the created body of life , we get knowledge , and beyond knowledge , the phosphorescent ecstasy of acute sensation . ’ Oh , I do think these phrases are too absurdly wonderful . Oh but do n’t you think they are — they’re nearly as good as Jesus . ‘ And if , Julius , you want this ecstasy of reduction with the Pussum , you must go on till it is fulfilled . But surely there is in you also , somewhere , the living desire for positive creation , relationships in ultimate faith , when all this process of active corruption , with all its flowers of mud , is transcended , and more or less finished — ’ I do wonder what the flowers of mud are . Pussum , you are a flower of mud . ”
184071	184080	184242	184242	he	204	“ Thank you — and what are you ? ”
184081	184124	184242	184242	he	204	“ Oh , I ’m another , surely , according to this letter ! We ’re all flowers of mud — fleurs — hic ! du mal ! It ’s perfectly wonderful , Birkin harrowing Hell — harrowing the Pompadour — Hic ! ”
184125	184132	184134	184134	Maxim	215	“ Go on — go on , ”
184136	184147	184134	184134	Maxim	215	“ What comes next ? It ’s really very interesting . ”
184148	184160	184162	184163	the Pussum	4973	“ I think it ’s awful cheek to write like that , ”
184165	184174	184176	184177	the Russian	5027	“ Yes — yes , so do I , ”
184179	184209	184176	184177	the Russian	5027	“ He is a megalomaniac , of course , it is a form of religious mania . He thinks he is the Saviour of man — go on reading . ”
184210	184213	184214	184214	Halliday	204	“ Surely , ”
184217	184234	184235	184235	he	204	“ ‘ surely goodness and mercy hath followed me all the days of my life — ’ ”
184251	184358	184242	184242	he	204	“ ‘ Surely there will come an end in us to this desire — for the constant going apart,—this passion for putting asunder — everything — ourselves , reducing ourselves part from part — reacting in intimacy only for destruction,—using sex as a great reducing agent , reducing the two great elements of male and female from their highly complex unity — reducing the old ideas , going back to the savages for our sensations,—always seeking to lose ourselves in some ultimate black sensation , mindless and infinite — burning only with destructive fires , raging on with the hope of being burnt out utterly — ’ ”
184359	184365	184367	184367	Gudrun	160	“ I want to go , ”
184450	184454	184455	184455	she	160	“ Excuse me , ”
184458	184468	184455	184455	she	160	“ Is that a genuine letter you are reading ? ”
184469	184473	184475	184475	Halliday	204	“ Oh yes , ”
184477	184481	184475	184475	Halliday	204	“ Quite genuine . ”
184482	184487	184490	184490	he	204	“ May I see ? ”
184500	184504	184505	184505	she	160	“ Thank you , ”
184734	184775	184728	184729	the Pussum	211	“ Go and get it back from her . I never heard of such a thing ! Go and get it back from her . Tell Gerald Crich — there he goes — go and make him give it up . ”
184793	184798	184799	184799	she	160	“ To the hotel ? ”
184809	184814	184815	184815	he	255	“ Where you like , ”
184818	184821	184822	184822	she	160	“ Right ! ”
184830	184836	184827	184828	the driver	4986	“ Wagstaff’s — Barton Street . ”
184885	184892	184893	184893	she	160	“ You ’ve forgotten the man , ”
184921	184929	184931	184931	Gerald	255	“ What was all the row about ? ”
184937	184946	184947	184947	she	160	“ I walked away with Birkin ’s letter , ”
184966	184969	184970	184970	he	255	“ Ah ! ”
184973	184981	184970	184970	he	255	“ Splendid ! A set of jackasses ! ”
184982	184989	184990	184990	she	160	“ I could have killed them ! ”
184995	185034	184990	184990	she	160	“ Dogs!—they are dogs ! Why is Rupert such a fool as to write such letters to them ? Why does he give himself away to such canaille ? It ’s a thing that can not be borne . ”
185088	185110	185085	185085	she	160	“ I feel I could never see this foul town again — I could n’t bear to come back to it . ”
185337	185346	185348	185348	Birkin	169	“ Let us go forward , shall we ? ”
186175	186178	186184	186184	Everybody	780	“ OSTEND , ”
186362	186367	186368	186368	Ursula	255	“ Köln — Berlin — ”

186411	186418	186419	186420	The porter	3684	“ That was it , Basle ! ”
186424	186431	186433	186433	he	3684	“ À Bâle — deuxième classe?—Voilà ! ”
186469	186475	186477	186477	Birkin	169	“ Nous avons encore — ? ”
186488	186495	186477	186477	Birkin	169	“ Encore une demi - heure . ”
186513	186516	186518	186518	Birkin	169	“ Come , ”
186520	186529	186518	186518	Birkin	169	“ It is cold . Let us eat . ”
187523	187541	187542	187542	Birkin	169	“ Do you know if Mr and Mrs Crich — English — from Paris , have arrived ? ”
187581	187586	187587	187587	she	160	“ Gudrun ! Gudrun ! ”
187598	187603	187587	187587	she	160	“ Shu - hu ! ”
187623	187628	187629	187629	she	160	“ Really — Ursula ! ”
187658	187661	187663	187663	Gudrun	160	“ But ! ”
187667	187685	187663	187663	Gudrun	160	“ We thought it was tomorrow you were coming ! I wanted to come to the station . ”
187686	187694	187696	187696	Ursula	255	“ No , we ’ve come today ! ”
187698	187705	187696	187696	Ursula	255	“ Is n’t it lovely here ! ”
187706	187709	187711	187711	Gudrun	160	“ Adorable ! ”
187713	187731	187711	187711	Gudrun	160	“ Gerald ’s just gone out to get something . Ursula , are n’t you fearfully tired ? ”
187732	187750	187696	187696	Ursula	255	“ No , not so very . But I look a filthy sight , do n’t I ! ”
187751	187771	187772	187772	She	3818	“ No , you do n’t . You look almost perfectly fresh . I like that fur cap immensely ! ”
187802	187806	187808	187808	Ursula	255	“ And you ! ”
187810	187819	187820	187820	Gudrun	160	“ What do you think you look like ! ”
187828	187834	187835	187835	she	160	“ Do you like it ? ”
187838	187844	187846	187846	Ursula	255	“ It ’s very fine ! ”
187855	187863	187865	187865	Birkin	169	“ Go up — or come down , ”
187936	187940	187942	187942	Gudrun	160	“ First floor ? ”
187950	187957	187958	187959	the waiter	4920	“ Second Madam — the lift ! ”
188065	188072	188074	188074	Ursula	255	“ Go with Gerald and smoke , ”
188078	188086	188074	188074	Ursula	255	“ Gudrun and I want to talk . ”
188122	188128	188129	188129	she	3835	“ Where is the letter ? ”
188132	188137	188139	188139	Gudrun	160	“ I kept it , ”
188141	188152	188153	188153	she	3835	“ You ’ll give it me , wo n’t you ? ”
188168	188177	188165	188165	she	160	“ Do you really want it , Ursula ? ”
188178	188185	188187	188187	Ursula	255	“ I want to read it , ”
188189	188192	188194	188194	Gudrun	160	“ Certainly , ”
188238	188246	188248	188248	Ursula	255	“ What did you do in Paris ? ”
188250	188253	188255	188255	Gudrun	160	“ Oh , ”
188256	188273	188194	188194	Gudrun	160	laconically—“the usual things . We had a fine party one night in Fanny Bath ’s studio . ”
188274	188293	188199	188199	she	3835	“ Did you ? And you and Gerald were there ! Who else ? Tell me about it . ”
188294	188297	188299	188299	Gudrun	160	“ Well , ”
188301	188517	188299	188299	Gudrun	160	“ There ’s nothing particular to tell . You know Fanny is frightfully in love with that painter , Billy Macfarlane . He was there — so Fanny spared nothing , she spent very freely . It was really remarkable ! Of course , everybody got fearfully drunk — but in an interesting way , not like that filthy London crowd . The fact is these were all people that matter , which makes all the difference . There was a Roumanian , a fine chap . He got completely drunk , and climbed to the top of a high studio ladder , and gave the most marvellous address — really , Ursula , it was wonderful ! He began in French — La vie , c’est une affaire d’âmes impériales — in a most beautiful voice — he was a fine - looking chap — but he had got into Roumanian before he had finished , and not a soul understood . But Donald Gilchrist was worked to a frenzy . He dashed his glass to the ground , and declared , by God , he was glad he had been born , by God , it was a miracle to be alive . And do you know , Ursula , so it was — ”
188523	188532	188534	188534	Ursula	255	“ But how was Gerald among them all ? ”
188536	188616	188617	188617	Ursula	255	“ Gerald ! Oh , my word , he came out like a dandelion in the sun ! He ’s a whole saturnalia in himself , once he is roused . I should n’t like to say whose waist his arm did not go round . Really , Ursula , he seems to reap the women like a harvest . There was n’t one that would have resisted him . It was too amazing ! Can you understand it ? ”
188629	188632	188633	188633	she	3836	“ Yes , ”
188636	188648	188633	188633	she	3836	“ I can . He is such a whole - hogger . ”
188649	188659	188661	188661	Gudrun	160	“ Whole - hogger ! I should think so ! ”
188663	188768	188661	188661	Gudrun	160	“ But it is true , Ursula , every woman in the room was ready to surrender to him . Chanticleer is n’t in it — even Fanny Bath , who is genuinely in love with Billy Macfarlane ! I never was more amazed in my life ! And you know , afterwards — I felt I was a whole roomful of women . I was no more myself to him , than I was Queen Victoria . I was a whole roomful of women at once . It was most astounding ! But my eye , I ’d caught a Sultan that time — ”
188916	188927	188929	188929	Gudrun	160	“ Do n’t you love to be in this place ? ”
188931	188961	188929	188929	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t the snow wonderful ! Do you notice how it exalts everything ? It is simply marvellous . One really does feel übermenschlich — more than human . ”
188962	188966	188968	188968	Ursula	255	“ One does , ”
188970	188982	188968	188968	Ursula	255	“ But is n’t that partly the being out of England ? ”
188983	188989	188991	188991	Gudrun	160	“ Oh , of course , ”
188993	189036	188991	188991	Gudrun	160	“ One could never feel like this in England , for the simple reason that the damper is never lifted off one , there . It is quite impossible really to let go , in England , of that I am assured . ”
189055	189061	189063	189063	Gerald	255	“ It ’s quite true , ”
189065	189122	189063	189063	Gerald	255	“ it never is quite the same in England . But perhaps we do n’t want it to be — perhaps it ’s like bringing the light a little too near the powder - magazine , to let go altogether , in England . One is afraid what might happen , if everybody else let go . ”
189123	189127	189129	189129	Gudrun	160	“ My God ! ”
189131	189152	189129	189129	Gudrun	160	“ But would n’t it be wonderful , if all England did suddenly go off like a display of fireworks . ”
189153	189158	189160	189160	Ursula	255	“ It could n’t , ”
189162	189176	189160	189160	Ursula	255	“ They are all too damp , the powder is damp in them . ”
189177	189186	189188	189188	Gerald	255	“ I ’m not so sure of that , ”
189190	189194	189196	189196	Birkin	169	“ Nor I , ”
189198	189222	189196	189196	Birkin	169	“ When the English really begin to go off , en masse , it ’ll be time to shut your ears and run . ”
189223	189228	189230	189230	Ursula	255	“ They never will , ”
189232	189237	189238	189238	he	255	“ We ’ll see , ”
189241	189247	189249	189249	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t it marvellous , ”
189251	189301	189249	189249	Gudrun	160	“ how thankful one can be , to be out of one ’s country . I can not believe myself , I am so transported , the moment I set foot on a foreign shore . I say to myself ‘ Here steps a new creature into life . ’ ”
189302	189313	189315	189315	Gerald	255	“ Do n’t be too hard on poor old England , ”
189317	189328	189315	189315	Gerald	255	“ Though we curse it , we love it really . ”
189342	189346	189348	189348	Birkin	169	“ We may , ”
189350	189382	189348	189348	Birkin	169	“ But it ’s a damnably uncomfortable love : like a love for an aged parent who suffers horribly from a complication of diseases , for which there is no hope . ”
189392	189400	189401	189401	she	160	“ You think there is no hope ? ”
189422	189458	189414	189414	He	3840	“ Any hope of England ’s becoming real ? God knows . It ’s a great actual unreality now , an aggregation into unreality . It might be real , if there were no Englishmen . ”
189459	189469	189471	189471	Gudrun	160	“ You think the English will have to disappear ? ”
189538	189567	189535	189535	he	3840	“ Well — what else is in front of them , but disappearance ? They ’ve got to disappear from their own special brand of Englishness , anyhow . ”
189586	189598	189599	189599	she	160	“ But in what way do you mean , disappear ? — ”
189602	189613	189616	189616	Gerald	255	“ Yes , do you mean a change of heart ? ”
189618	189629	189631	189631	Birkin	169	“ I do n’t mean anything , why should I ? ”
189633	189662	189631	189631	Birkin	169	“ I ’m an Englishman , and I ’ve paid the price of it . I ca n’t talk about England — I can only speak for myself . ”
189663	189666	189668	189668	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
189671	189681	189668	189668	Gudrun	160	“ you love England immensely , immensely , Rupert . ”
189682	189687	189688	189688	he	3840	“ And leave her , ”
189691	189703	189705	189705	Gerald	255	“ No , not for good . You ’ll come back , ”
189710	189721	189723	189723	Birkin	169	“ They say the lice crawl off a dying body , ”
189731	189737	189723	189723	Birkin	169	“ So I leave England . ”
189738	189747	189749	189749	Gudrun	160	“ Ah , but you ’ll come back , ”
189756	189762	189763	189763	he	3840	“ Tant pis pour moi , ”
189766	189776	189778	189778	Gerald	255	“ Is n’t he angry with his mother country ! ”
189782	189788	189790	189790	Gudrun	160	“ Ah , a patriot ! ”
189946	189952	189953	189953	she	160	“ What are they then ? ”
189963	189966	189967	189967	he	255	“ What ? ”
189977	189981	189970	189970	his	255	“ Your thoughts . ”
189990	189997	189998	189998	he	255	“ I think I had none , ”
190001	190004	190005	190005	she	160	“ Really ! ”
190030	190034	190036	190036	Gudrun	160	“ Ah but , ”
190038	190051	190059	190059	her	160	“ let us drink to Britannia — let us drink to Britannia . ”
190070	190076	190077	190077	he	255	“ I think Rupert means , ”
190080	190096	190077	190077	he	255	“ that nationally all Englishmen must die , so that they can exist individually and — ”
190097	190102	190105	190105	Gudrun	160	“ Super - nationally — ”
190202	190208	190209	190209	she	160	“ My God , Jerry , ”
190219	190226	190209	190209	she	160	“ you ’ve done it now . ”
190227	190230	190231	190231	She	160	“ What ? ”
190244	190249	190231	190231	She	160	“ Look at it ! ”
190308	190318	190320	190320	Ursula	255	“ It makes one feel so small and alone , ”
190333	190345	190347	190347	Gerald	255	“ You ’re not sorry you ’ve come , are you ? ”
190366	190369	190371	190371	Gerald	255	“ Ah , ”
190379	190401	190371	190371	Gerald	255	“ this is perfect . There ’s our sledge . We ’ll walk a bit — we’ll run up the road . ”
190677	190688	190690	190690	Gudrun	160	“ It ’s a marvellous place , for all that , ”
190707	190710	190711	190711	he	255	“ Good , ”
190850	190858	190859	190859	she	3867	“ This is something I never expected , ”
190862	190871	190859	190859	she	3867	“ It is a different world , here . ”

197895	197928	197881	197881	Gudrun	160	“ He should have all the women he can — it is his nature . It is absurd to call him monogamous — he is naturally promiscuous . That is his nature . ”
197985	197991	197992	197992	she	160	“ It is really true , ”

198301	198308	198309	198309	she	160	“ Who do I like best ? ”
198326	198354	198309	198309	she	160	“ Why I do n’t know , I do n’t know enough about them yet , to be able to say . Who do you like best ? ”
198355	198387	198406	198406	his	255	“ Oh , I do n’t care — I do n’t like or dislike any of them . It does n’t matter about me . I wanted to know about you . ”
198388	198392	198393	198393	she	160	“ But why ? ”
198411	198417	198418	198418	he	255	“ I wanted to know , ”
198443	198453	198454	198454	she	160	“ Well , I ca n’t tell you already , ”

198725	198728	198729	198729	she	160	“ Oh , ”
198736	198754	198729	198729	she	160	“ I ’m ready for anything — anything will be fine for me , I ’m sure . ”
198762	198808	198758	198758	she	160	“ God , why am I so nervous — why are you so nervous , you fool . If he sees it I ’m done for forever — you know you ’re done for forever , if he sees the absurd state you ’re in . ”
199097	199114	199073	199073	she	160	“ Oh , would you mind looking in that bag behind there and giving me my — ”
199121	199129	199130	199130	she	160	“ My what — my what — ? ”
199201	199205	199206	199206	he	4124	“ Your what ? ”

199436	199455	199429	199429	she	160	“ Ah , what a fine game you played with the Professor ’s daughter — didn’t you now ? ”
199456	199460	199461	199461	he	4124	“ What game ? ”
199467	199487	199489	199489	Gudrun	160	“ Is n’t she in love with you — oh dear , is n’t she in love with you ! ”

199520	199561	199517	199517	she	160	“ Why the poor girl is lying at this moment overwhelmed , dying with love for you . She thinks you ’re wonderful — oh marvellous , beyond what man has ever been . really , is n’t it funny ? ”
199562	199570	199571	199571	he	4124	“ Why funny , what is funny ? ”
199574	199584	199585	199585	she	160	“ Why to see you working it on her , ”
199600	199609	199585	199585	she	160	“ Really Gerald , the poor girl — ! ”
199610	199617	199618	199618	he	4124	“ I did nothing to her , ”
199621	199639	199618	199618	he	4124	“ Oh , it was too shameful , the way you simply swept her off her feet . ”
199640	199645	199646	199646	he	4124	“ That was Schuhplatteln , ”
199654	199661	199663	199663	Gudrun	160	“ Ha — ha — ha ! ”
200403	200407	200408	200408	She	160	“ What for ? ”
200744	200779	200731	200731	She	160	“ Oh , my dear , my dear , the game is n’t worth even you . You are a fine thing really — why should you be used on such a poor show ! ”
201069	201075	201076	201076	she	4158	“ You ’ve done it , ”
201079	201082	201083	201083	he	255	“ What ? ”
201088	201092	201083	201083	he	255	“ Convinced me . ”
201636	201641	201642	201642	he	255	“ What is it ? ”
201646	201654	201642	201642	he	255	“ Was it too much for you ? ”
201685	201690	201691	201691	he	255	“ What is it ? ”
201694	201700	201691	201691	he	255	“ Did it upset you ? ”
201726	201729	201730	201730	she	160	“ No , ”
201737	201747	201730	201730	she	160	“ It was the complete moment of my life . ”
202934	202942	202944	202944	Ursula	255	“ Is n’t it interesting , Prune , ”
202951	202972	202944	202944	Ursula	255	“ Herr Loerke is doing a great frieze for a factory in Cologne , for the outside , the street . ”
202997	203000	202973	202973	She	4198	“ griffes , ”
203003	203007	203008	203008	she	4198	“ What in ? ”
203011	203015	203017	203017	Ursula	255	“ Aus was ? ”
203019	203022	203023	203023	he	389	“ Granit , ”
203041	203047	203049	203049	Gudrun	160	“ What is the relief ? ”
203051	203055	203049	203049	Gudrun	160	“ Alto relievo . ”
203056	203062	203068	203068	Gudrun	160	“ And at what height ? ”
203171	203182	203184	203184	Ursula	255	“ But how wonderful , to have such a factory ! ”
203186	203193	203184	203184	Ursula	255	“ Is the whole building fine ? ”
203194	203198	203199	203199	he	389	“ Oh yes , ”
203202	203220	203199	203199	he	389	“ The frieze is part of the whole architecture . Yes , it is a colossal thing . ”
203235	203307	203222	203222	he	389	“ Sculpture and architecture must go together . The day for irrelevant statues , as for wall pictures , is over . As a matter of fact sculpture is always part of an architectural conception . And since churches are all museum stuff , since industry is our business , now , then let us make our places of industry our art — our factory - area our Parthenon , ecco ! ”
203311	203315	203316	203316	she	4209	“ I suppose , ”
203319	203333	203316	203316	she	4209	“ there is no need for our great works to be so hideous . ”
203340	203345	203346	203346	he	389	“ There you are ! ”
203349	203526	203346	203346	he	389	“ there you are ! There is not only no need for our places of work to be ugly , but their ugliness ruins the work , in the end . Men will not go on submitting to such intolerable ugliness . In the end it will hurt too much , and they will wither because of it . And this will wither the work as well . They will think the work itself is ugly : the machines , the very act of labour . Whereas the machinery and the acts of labour are extremely , maddeningly beautiful . But this will be the end of our civilisation , when people will not work because work has become so intolerable to their senses , it nauseates them too much , they would rather starve . Then we shall see the hammer used only for smashing , then we shall see it . Yet here we are — we have the opportunity to make beautiful factories , beautiful machine - houses — we have the opportunity — ”
203540	203546	203547	203547	she	160	“ What does he say ? ”
203570	203577	203579	203579	Gudrun	160	“ And do you think then , ”
203581	203588	203579	203579	Gudrun	160	“ that art should serve industry ? ”
203589	203601	203602	203602	he	4210	“ Art should interpret industry , as art once interpreted religion , ”
203605	203613	203614	203614	she	160	“ But does your fair interpret industry ? ”
203618	203665	203616	203616	him	4210	“ Certainly . What is man doing , when he is at a fair like this ? He is fulfilling the counterpart of labour — the machine works him , instead of he the machine . He enjoys the mechanical motion , in his own body . ”
203666	203677	203679	203679	Gudrun	160	“ But is there nothing but work — mechanical work ? ”
203681	203686	203687	203687	he	4210	“ Nothing but work ! ”
203705	203748	203687	203687	he	4210	“ No , it is nothing but this , serving a machine , or enjoying the motion of a machine — motion , that is all . You have never worked for hunger , or you would know what god governs us . ”
203763	203773	203774	203774	she	160	“ No , I have not worked for hunger , ”
203777	203783	203774	203774	she	160	“ but I have worked ! ”
203784	203789	203790	203790	he	4210	“ Travaillé — lavorato ? ”
203793	203811	203812	203812	He	4210	“ E che lavoro — che lavoro ? Quel travail est - ce que vous avez fait ? ”
203833	203843	203844	203844	he	4210	“ You have never worked as the world works , ”
203852	203855	203856	203856	she	160	“ Yes , ”
203859	203875	203856	203856	she	160	“ I have . And I do — I work now for my daily bread . ”
203898	203909	203890	203890	She	160	“ But have you ever worked as the world works ? ”
203920	203923	203924	203924	he	4210	“ Yes , ”
203932	203954	203924	203924	he	4210	“ I have known what it was to lie in bed for three days , because I had nothing to eat . ”
204014	204148	204010	204010	he	4210	“ My father was a man who did not like work , and we had no mother . We lived in Austria , Polish Austria . How did we live ? Ha!—somehow ! Mostly in a room with three other families — one set in each corner — and the W.C. in the middle of the room — a pan with a plank on it — ha ! I had two brothers and a sister — and there might be a woman with my father . He was a free being , in his way — would fight with any man in the town — a garrison town — and was a little man too . But he would n’t work for anybody — set his heart against it , and would n’t . ”
204149	204157	204159	204159	Ursula	255	“ And how did you live then ? ”
204173	204178	204179	204179	he	4211	“ Do you understand ? ”
204182	204185	204186	204186	she	4212	“ Enough , ”
204207	204216	204218	204218	Ursula	255	“ And how did you become a sculptor ? ”
204220	204228	204229	204229	he	4211	“ How did I become a sculptor — ”
204232	204235	204236	204236	he	4211	“ Dunque — ”
204248	204332	204236	204236	he	4211	French—“I became old enough — I used to steal from the market - place . Later I went to work — imprinted the stamp on clay bottles , before they were baked . It was an earthenware - bottle factory . There I began making models . One day , I had had enough . I lay in the sun and did not go to work . Then I walked to Munich — then I walked to Italy — begging , begging everything . ”
204333	204385	204236	204236	he	4211	“ The Italians were very good to me — they were good and honourable to me . From Bozen to Rome , almost every night I had a meal and a bed , perhaps of straw , with some peasant . I love the Italian people , with all my heart . “
204407	204475	204236	204236	he	4211	” He looked down at the ground , his voice tailing off into silence . Gudrun looked at his fine , thin , shiny skin , reddish - brown from the sun , drawn tight over his full temples ; and at his thin hair — and at the thick , coarse , brush - like moustache , cut short about his mobile , rather shapeless mouth . “
204481	204498	204479	204479	you	0	” she asked . He looked up at her with his full , elfin eyes startled . “
204502	204518	204479	204479	you	0	” he repeated . And he hesitated . It was evidently one of his reticencies . “
204524	204531	204522	204522	you	4214	” he replied , without answering . “
204538	204542	204532	204532	I	0	” she answered . “
204547	204563	204532	204532	I	0	” he repeated , looking into her eyes . He paused . Then he said : “
204574	204575	204566	204567	Herr Gemahl	402	” “
204578	204582	204583	204584	Your husband	4215	” asked Gudrun . “
204586	204595	204583	204583	Your	4214	” said Ursula , with a certain irony . “
204603	204614	204615	204615	He	4215	” said Gudrun in English . In German she answered , “
204621	204653	204615	204615	He	4215	” But Loerke was watching closely , with his uncanny , full , suspicious eyes . Something in Gudrun seemed to accord with him . He was really like one of the “
205044	205057	205058	205058	Gerald	255	“ What do the women find so impressive in that little brat ? ”
205061	205066	205068	205068	Birkin	169	“ God alone knows , ”
205070	205094	205068	205068	Birkin	169	“ unless it ’s some sort of appeal he makes to them , which flatters them and has such a power over them . ”
205101	205110	205111	205111	he	255	“ Does he make an appeal to them ? ”
205114	205118	205120	205120	Birkin	169	“ Oh yes , ”
205122	205152	205120	205120	Birkin	169	“ He is the perfectly subjected being , existing almost like a criminal . And the women rush towards that , like a current of air towards a vacuum . ”
205153	205161	205163	205163	Gerald	255	“ Funny they should rush to that , ”
205165	205172	205174	205174	Birkin	169	“ Makes one mad , too , ”
205176	205200	205174	205174	Birkin	169	“ But he has the fascination of pity and repulsion for them , a little obscene monster of the darkness that he is . ”
205209	205219	205220	205220	he	255	“ What do women want , at the bottom ? ”
205228	205232	205233	205233	he	255	“ God knows , ”
205236	205272	205233	205233	he	255	“ Some satisfaction in basic repulsion , it seems to me . They seem to creep down some ghastly tunnel of darkness , and will never be satisfied till they ’ve come to the end . ”
205295	205302	205303	205303	he	255	“ And what is the end ? ”
205311	205348	205306	205306	Birkin	169	“ I ’ve not got there yet , so I do n’t know . Ask Loerke , he ’s pretty near . He is a good many stages further than either you or I can go . ”
205349	205358	205360	205360	Gerald	255	“ Yes , but stages further in what ? ”
205377	205384	205385	205385	he	255	“ Stages further in social hatred , ”
205388	205449	205385	205385	he	255	“ He lives like a rat , in the river of corruption , just where it falls over into the bottomless pit . He ’s further on than we are . He hates the ideal more acutely . He hates the ideal utterly , yet it still dominates him . I expect he is a Jew — or part Jewish . ”
205450	205453	205455	205455	Gerald	255	“ Probably , ”
205457	205472	205455	205455	Gerald	255	“ He is a gnawing little negation , gnawing at the roots of life . ”
205473	205482	205484	205484	Gerald	255	“ But why does anybody care about him ? ”
205486	205515	205484	205484	Gerald	255	“ Because they hate the ideal also , in their souls . They want to explore the sewers , and he ’s the wizard rat that swims ahead . ”
205529	205539	205540	205540	he	255	“ I do n’t understand your terms , really , ”
205550	205560	205540	205540	he	255	“ But it sounds a rum sort of desire . ”
205561	205569	205571	205571	Birkin	169	“ I suppose we want the same , ”
205573	205601	205571	205571	Birkin	169	“ Only we want to take a quick jump downwards , in a sort of ecstasy — and he ebbs with the stream , the sewer stream . ”
205664	205673	205674	205674	Gudrun	160	“ Do you do nothing but architectural sculpture ? ”
205680	205684	205685	205685	he	389	“ Not now , ”
205688	205707	205685	205685	he	389	“ I have done all sorts — except portraits — I never did portraits . But other things — ”
205708	205714	205716	205716	Gudrun	160	“ What kind of things ? ”
205767	205778	205779	205779	he	389	“ That is quite an early thing — not mechanical , ”
205782	205786	205779	205779	he	389	“ more popular . ”
206024	206030	206031	206031	she	4230	“ How big is it ? ”
206046	206050	206051	206051	he	389	“ How big ? ”
206059	206066	206067	206067	he	389	“ Without pedestal — so high — ”
206071	206076	206077	206077	He	389	hand—“with pedestal , so — ”
206106	206114	206115	206115	she	4230	“ And what is it done in ? ”
206144	206150	206130	206130	He	389	“ Bronze — green bronze . ”
206151	206155	206157	206157	Gudrun	160	“ Green bronze ! ”
206186	206191	206192	206192	she	4230	“ Yes , beautiful , ”
206215	206218	206220	206220	Ursula	255	“ Why , ”
206222	206239	206220	206220	Ursula	255	“ did you make the horse so stiff ? It is as stiff as a block . ”
206240	206243	206244	206244	he	389	“ Stiff ? ”
206252	206276	206277	206277	He	389	“ Yes . Look how stock and stupid and brutal it is . Horses are sensitive , quite delicate and sensitive , really . ”
206307	206311	206312	206312	he	389	“ Wissen Sie , ”
206325	206396	206312	206312	he	389	“ that horse is a certain form , part of a whole form . It is part of a work of art , a piece of form . It is not a picture of a friendly horse to which you give a lump of sugar , do you see — it is part of a work of art , it has no relation to anything outside that work of art . ”
206435	206447	206448	206448	He	389	“ But it is a picture of a horse , nevertheless . ”
206456	206472	206448	206448	He	389	“ As you like — it is not a picture of a cow , certainly . ”
206502	206518	206519	206519	she	160	“ What do you mean by ‘ it is a picture of a horse ? ’ ”
206525	206606	206519	206519	she	160	“ What do you mean by a horse ? You mean an idea you have in your head , and which you want to see represented . There is another idea altogether , quite another idea . Call it a horse if you like , or say it is not a horse . I have just as much right to say that your horse is n’t a horse , that it is a falsity of your own make - up . ”
206617	206629	206630	206630	she	160	“ But why does he have this idea of a horse ? ”
206633	206652	206630	206630	she	160	“ I know it is his idea . I know it is a picture of himself , really — ”
206658	206664	206665	206665	he	404	“ A picture of myself ! ”
206671	206801	206665	206665	he	404	“ Wissen sie , gnädige Frau , that is a Kunstwerk , a work of art . It is a work of art , it is a picture of nothing , of absolutely nothing . It has nothing to do with anything but itself , it has no relation with the everyday world of this and other , there is no connection between them , absolutely none , they are two different and distinct planes of existence , and to translate one into the other is worse than foolish , it is a darkening of all counsel , a making confusion everywhere . Do you see , you must not confuse the relative work of action , with the absolute world of art . That you must not do . ”
206802	206808	206810	206810	Gudrun	160	“ That is quite true , ”
206820	206866	206810	206810	Gudrun	160	“ The two things are quite and permanently apart , they have nothing to do with one another . I and my art , they have nothing to do with each other . My art stands in another world , I am in this world . ”
206902	206913	206874	206874	Loerke	404	“ Ja — so ist es , so ist es . ”
206935	206954	206955	206955	she	4240	“ It is n’t a word of it true , of all this harangue you have made me , ”
206959	206987	206955	206955	she	4240	“ The horse is a picture of your own stock , stupid brutality , and the girl was a girl you loved and tortured and then ignored . ”
207055	207068	207069	207069	she	4240	“ As for your world of art and your world of reality , ”
207072	207150	207069	207069	she	4240	“ you have to separate the two , because you ca n’t bear to know what you are . You ca n’t bear to realise what a stock , stiff , hide - bound brutality you are really , so you say ‘ it ’s the world of art . ’ The world of art is only the truth about the real world , that ’s all — but you are too far gone to see it . ”
207291	207298	207271	207271	Gudrun	160	“ Was the girl a model ? ”
207299	207313	207271	207271	Gudrun	160	“ Nein , sie war kein Modell . Sie war eine kleine Malschülerin . ”
207314	207320	207322	207322	Gudrun	160	“ An art - student ! ”
207437	207443	207444	207444	Ursula	255	“ Where is she now ? ”
207460	207468	207469	207469	he	404	“ That is already six years ago , ”
207472	207486	207469	207469	he	404	“ she will be twenty - three years old , no more good . ”
207515	207519	207504	207504	He	255	“ Lady Godiva . ”
207520	207528	207529	207529	he	255	“ But this is n’t Lady Godiva , ”
207537	207559	207529	207529	he	255	“ She was the middle - aged wife of some Earl or other , who covered herself with her long hair . ”
207560	207566	207568	207568	Gudrun	160	“ À la Maud Allan , ”
207574	207579	207580	207580	he	255	“ Why Maud Allan ? ”
207583	207597	207580	207580	he	255	“ Is n’t it so ? I always thought the legend was that . ”
207598	207615	207616	207616	She	4255	“ Yes , Gerald dear , I ’m quite sure you ’ve got the legend perfectly . ”
207631	207646	207647	207647	he	255	“ To be sure , I ’d rather see the woman than the hair , ”
207652	207658	207660	207660	Gudrun	160	“ Would n’t you just ! ”
207688	207692	207693	207693	she	4255	“ Of course , ”
207702	207709	207693	207693	she	4255	“ you understood your little Malschülerin . ”
207722	207727	207729	207729	Gerald	255	“ The little girl ? ”
207765	207772	207773	207773	she	160	“ Did n’t he understand her ! ”
207786	207816	207817	207817	She	160	“ You ’ve only to look at the feet — aren’t they darling , so pretty and tender — oh , they ’re really wonderful , they are really — ”
207906	207912	207913	207913	Gudrun	160	“ What was her name ? ”
207917	207922	207915	207915	Loerke	404	“ Annette von Weck , ”
207927	207975	207976	207976	He	255	“ Ja , sie war hübsch . She was pretty — but she was tiresome . She was a nuisance,—not for a minute would she keep still — not until I ’d slapped her hard and made her cry — then she ’d sit for five minutes . ”
207992	207999	208001	208001	Gudrun	160	“ Did you really slap her ? ”
208015	208021	208022	208022	he	255	“ Yes , I did , ”
208027	208058	208022	208022	he	255	“ harder than I have ever beat anything in my life . I had to , I had to . It was the only way I got the work done . ”
208091	208102	208104	208104	Gerald	255	“ Why did you have such a young Godiva then ? ”
208106	208128	208104	208104	Gerald	255	“ She is so small , besides , on the horse — not big enough for it — such a child . ”
208138	208141	208142	208142	he	404	“ Yes , ”
208145	208179	208142	208142	he	404	“ I do n’t like them any bigger , any older . Then they are beautiful , at sixteen , seventeen , eighteen — after that , they are no use to me . ”
208187	208191	208193	208193	Gerald	255	“ Why not ? ”
208200	208222	208195	208195	Loerke	404	“ I do n’t find them interesting — or beautiful — they are no good to me , for my work . ”
208223	208239	208241	208241	Gerald	255	“ Do you mean to say a woman is n’t beautiful after she is twenty ? ”
208243	208291	208241	208241	Gerald	255	“ For me , no . Before twenty , she is small and fresh and tender and slight . After that — let her be what she likes , she has nothing for me . The Venus of Milo is a bourgeoise — so are they all . ”
208292	208305	208307	208307	Gerald	255	“ And you do n’t care for women at all after twenty ? ”
208309	208326	208327	208327	Loerke	404	“ They are no good to me , they are of no use in my art , ”
208331	208339	208327	208327	Loerke	404	“ I do n’t find them beautiful . ”
208340	208346	208348	208348	Gerald	255	“ You are an epicure , ”
208356	208362	208364	208364	Gudrun	160	“ And what about men ? ”
208367	208377	208379	208379	Loerke	404	“ Yes , they are good at all ages , ”
208381	208416	208379	208379	Loerke	404	“ A man should be big and powerful — whether he is old or young is of no account , so he has the size , something of massiveness and — and stupid form . ”
208678	208681	208682	208682	she	4259	“ Rupert , ”
208690	208697	208682	208682	she	4259	“ I want to go away . ”
208705	208709	208710	208710	he	4271	“ Do you ? ”
208736	208741	208742	208742	she	4259	“ Do n’t you ? ”
208746	208754	208755	208755	he	4271	“ I had n’t thought about it , ”
208758	208766	208755	208755	he	4271	“ But I ’m sure I do . ”
208774	208779	208780	208780	she	4259	“ I hate it , ”
208783	208815	208780	208780	she	4259	“ I hate the snow , and the unnaturalness of it , the unnatural light it throws on everybody , the ghastly glamour , the unnatural feelings it makes everybody have . ”
208824	208827	208828	208828	he	4271	“ Well , ”
208831	208864	208828	208828	he	4271	“ we can go away — we can go tomorrow . We ’ll go tomorrow to Verona , and find Romeo and Juliet , and sit in the amphitheatre — shall we ? ”
208883	208886	208887	208887	she	4259	“ Yes , ”
208909	208919	208920	208920	she	4259	“ I shall love to be Romeo and Juliet , ”
208923	208927	208920	208920	she	4259	“ My love ! ”
208928	208938	208939	208939	he	4271	“ Though a fearfully cold wind blows in Verona , ”
208942	208961	208939	208939	he	4271	“ from out of the Alps . We shall have the smell of the snow in our noses . ”
208970	208977	208978	208978	she	4259	“ Are you glad to go ? ”
209005	209017	208990	208990	She	4259	“ Do n’t laugh at me — don’t laugh at me . ”
209018	209024	209025	209025	he	4271	“ Why how ’s that ? ”
209034	209045	209046	209046	she	4259	“ Because I do n’t want to be laughed at , ”
209063	209069	209070	209070	she	4259	“ Do you love me ? ”
209077	209080	209081	209081	he	4271	“ Yes , ”
209131	209138	209139	209139	he	4271	“ Your mouth is so hard , ”
209146	209155	209156	209156	she	4259	“ And yours is so soft and nice , ”
209160	209170	209171	209171	he	4271	“ But why do you always grip your lips ? ”
209176	209180	209181	209181	she	4259	“ Never mind , ”
209185	209191	209181	209181	she	4259	“ It is my way . ”
209403	209406	209408	209408	Ursula	255	“ Prune , ”
209410	209436	209408	209408	Ursula	255	“ I think we shall go away tomorrow . I ca n’t stand the snow any more . It hurts my skin and my soul . ”
209437	209447	209449	209449	Gudrun	160	“ Does it really hurt your soul , Ursula ? ”
209455	209479	209449	209449	Gudrun	160	“ I can believe quite it hurts your skin — it is terrible . But I thought it was admirable for the soul . ”
209480	209492	209494	209494	Ursula	255	“ No , not for mine . It just injures it , ”
209496	209499	209501	209501	Gudrun	160	“ Really ! ”
209527	209533	209535	209535	Gerald	255	“ You will go south ? ”
209546	209549	209551	209551	Birkin	169	“ Yes , ”
209721	209732	209733	209733	she	160	“ I ca n’t take them from you , Prune , ”
209736	209749	209733	209733	she	160	“ I ca n’t possibly deprive you of them — the jewels . ”
209750	209756	209758	209758	Gudrun	160	“ Are n’t they jewels ! ”
209768	209775	209758	209758	Gudrun	160	“ Are n’t they real lambs ! ”
209776	209784	209786	209786	Ursula	255	“ Yes , you must keep them , ”
209788	209822	209786	209786	Ursula	255	“ I do n’t want them , I ’ve got three more pairs . I want you to keep them — I want you to have them . They ’re yours , there — ”
209839	209853	209855	209855	Ursula	255	“ One gets the greatest joy of all out of really lovely stockings , ”
209857	209861	209863	209863	Gudrun	160	“ One does , ”
209865	209872	209863	209863	Gudrun	160	“ the greatest joy of all . ”
209904	209911	209912	209912	Gudrun	160	“ Do you feel , Ursula , ”
209939	209940	209912	209912	Gudrun	160	” “
209948	209952	209912	209912	Gudrun	160	” said Ursula . “
209963	209964	209967	209967	I	0	” “
209985	209989	209977	209977	you	255	” Ursula quivered . “
210002	210006	209990	209990	I	0	” she said . “
210015	210019	210007	210007	I	0	” Gudrun waited . “
210025	210035	210021	210021	you	255	” she asked . Ursula meditated for a moment . “
210043	210068	210038	210038	I	0	” she replied . But Gudrun read the unconscious brightness on her sister ’s face , rather than the uncertain tones of her speech . “
210118	210127	210128	210128	I	0	” Ursula was silent , trying to imagine . “
210131	210139	210141	210141	Rupert	169	” she said at length , involuntarily , “
210162	210174	210175	210175	One	4646	” Gudrun watched her sister with impassive face and steady eyes . “
210188	210192	210184	210184	I	0	” she said . “
210237	210284	210184	210184	I	0	” Ursula looked out of the window . In her soul she began to wrestle , and she was frightened . She was always frightened of words , because she knew that mere word - force could always make her believe what she did not believe . “
210287	210300	210184	210184	I	0	” she said , full of mistrust , of herself and everybody . “
210303	210307	210308	210308	I	0	” she added , “
210364	210369	210326	210326	you	4296	” Gudrun considered herself . “
210372	210376	210326	210326	you	4296	” she said . “
210446	210458	210514	210514	one	4646	” Ursula looked away . She was so frightened of argument . “
210470	210474	210475	210475	One	4646	” she said . “
210511	210512	210499	210499	one	4646	” “
210523	210527	210514	210514	one	4646	” asked Gudrun . “
210581	210587	210570	210570	you	4296	” Ursula suddenly straightened herself . “
210590	210594	210570	210570	you	4296	” she said . “
210633	210656	210626	210626	You	4296	” Gudrun reflected for a few moments . Then a smile of ridicule , almost of contempt , came over her face . “
210668	210674	210626	210626	You	4296	” she cried in derision . “
210718	210719	210626	210626	You	4296	” “
210722	210726	210626	210626	You	4296	” said Ursula , “
210783	210818	210753	210753	I	0	” Gudrun looked at Ursula with steady , balancing eyes . She admired and despised her sister so much , both ! Then , suddenly she averted her face , saying coldly , uglily : “
210831	210840	210821	210821	I	0	” Over Ursula ’s mind flashed the thought : “
210854	210870	210847	210847	you	4296	” Gudrun rose , came over to Ursula and put her arm round her neck . “
210880	210891	210878	210878	dear	2460	” she said , her voice clanging with false benignity . “
210907	210970	210902	210902	Rupert	169	” Her arm rested round Ursula ’s neck , her fingers on Ursula ’s cheek for a few moments . Ursula was supremely uncomfortable meanwhile . There was an insult in Gudrun ’s protective patronage that was really too hurting . Feeling her sister ’s resistance , Gudrun drew awkwardly away , turned over the pillow , and disclosed the stockings again . “
210975	210982	210902	210902	Rupert	169	” she laughed , rather hollowly . “
210995	211026	210902	210902	Rupert	169	” And they passed to the familiar worldly subjects . Gerald and Birkin had walked on ahead , waiting for the sledge to overtake them , conveying the departing guests . “
211035	211051	211031	211031	you	4324	” asked Birkin , glancing up at Gerald ’s very red , almost blank face . “
211059	211063	211054	211054	I	0	” Gerald replied . “
211071	211072	211054	211054	I	0	” “
211083	211090	211054	211054	I	0	” asked Birkin . Gerald laughed . “
211095	211099	211054	211054	I	0	” he said . “
211108	211120	211105	211105	you	4324	” said Birkin . Gerald screwed up his eyes a little . “
211124	211128	211129	211129	I	0	” he said . “
211152	211153	211156	211156	I	0	” “
211164	211168	211156	211156	I	0	” asked Birkin . “
211190	211194	211182	211182	I	0	” said Gerald . “
211202	211224	211182	211182	I	0	” said Birkin . Gerald looked into the distance , with the small - pupilled , abstract eyes of a hawk . “
211282	211309	211250	211250	she	160	” He went on a few paces , staring ahead , his eyes fixed , looking like a mask used in ghastly religions of the barbarians . “
211317	211321	211250	211250	she	160	” he said , “
211348	211386	211340	211340	you	4326	” He was speaking as if in a trance , verbal and blank . Then suddenly he braced himself up with a kind of rhapsody , and looked at Birkin with vindictive , cowed eyes , saying : “
211448	211459	211494	211494	I	0	” he stopped on the snow and suddenly opened his clenched hands—“it
211474	211486	211494	211494	I	0	” he looked round into the air with a queer histrionic movement “
211517	211538	211509	211509	you’re	4326	” He walked on in silence . It seemed like bragging , but like a man in extremity bragging truthfully . “
211542	211546	211509	211509	you’re	4326	” he resumed , “
211580	211602	211573	211573	her	897	” Birkin looked at him , at his strange , scarcely conscious face . Gerald seemed blank before his own words . “
211610	211614	211615	211615	You	0	” said Birkin . “
211628	211629	211573	211573	her	897	” “
211632	211636	211573	211573	her	897	” said Gerald , “
211647	211654	211655	211655	I	0	” And the two walked on . “
211669	211682	211684	211684	you	0	” said Birkin bitterly . Gerald looked at him strangely , abstractedly . “
211686	211694	211684	211684	you	0	” he said , with icy scepticism . “
211702	212010	211697	211697	you	0	” He was hardly responsible for what he said . The sledge came . Gudrun dismounted and they all made their farewell . They wanted to go apart , all of them . Birkin took his place , and the sledge drove away leaving Gudrun and Gerald standing on the snow , waving . Something froze Birkin ’s heart , seeing them standing there in the isolation of the snow , growing smaller and more isolated . When Ursula and Birkin were gone , Gudrun felt herself free in her contest with Gerald . As they grew more used to each other , he seemed to press upon her more and more . At first she could manage him , so that her own will was always left free . But very soon , he began to ignore her female tactics , he dropped his respect for her whims and her privacies , he began to exert his own will blindly , without submitting to hers . Already a vital conflict had set in , which frightened them both . But he was alone , whilst already she had begun to cast round for external resource . When Ursula had gone , Gudrun felt her own existence had become stark and elemental . She went and crouched alone in her bedroom , looking out of the window at the big , flashing stars . In front was the faint shadow of the mountain - knot . That was the pivot . She felt strange and inevitable , as if she were centred upon the pivot of all existence , there was no further reality . Presently Gerald opened the door . She knew he would not be long before he came . She was rarely alone , he pressed upon her like a frost , deadening her . “
212018	212056	211697	211697	you	0	” he said . And she could tell by his tone he resented it , he resented this isolation she had drawn round herself . Yet , feeling static and inevitable , she was kind towards him . “
212065	212085	212058	212058	you	4330	” she asked . He did not answer , but came and stood behind her , in the darkness . “
212088	212092	212058	212058	you	4330	” she said , “
212106	212119	212101	212101	you	4330	” He crouched beside her , to look through the low window . “
212122	212126	212101	212101	you	4330	” he said . “
212132	212133	212101	212101	you	4330	” “
212154	212179	212140	212140	you	4330	” They remained in silence . With a mute , heavy gesture she put her hand on his knee , and took his hand . “
212185	212189	212181	212181	you	4330	” he asked . “
212196	212210	212181	212181	you	4330	” she said . Then , in a slow mood , she asked : “
212218	212226	212214	212214	you	4330	” He stiffened himself further against her . “
212235	212239	212230	212230	you	4330	” he asked . “
212245	212249	212240	212240	I	0	” she replied . “
212256	212280	212253	212253	your	4330	” he asked . There was a pause . At length , in the darkness , came her voice , hard and indifferent : “
212285	212304	212253	212253	your	4330	” she said coldly , almost flippant . His heart went icy at the sound of her voice . “
212312	212331	212332	212332	I	0	” he asked , as if admitting the truth of her accusation , yet hating her for it . “
212358	212374	212346	212346	You	4330	” Her heart was beating to suffocate her , yet she was strong and unrelenting . “
212383	212387	212377	212377	I	0	” he asked . “
212409	212414	212395	212395	I	0	” It was that statement “
212420	212429	212395	212395	I	0	” which sounded in his ears with madness . “
212444	212454	212432	212432	you	4330	” he said in a voice strangled with rage . “
212466	212479	212456	212456	you	0	” she asked . He was silent with cold passion of anger . “
212492	212500	212490	212490	you	0	” she repeated almost with a sneer . “
212503	212507	212490	212490	you	0	” he said . “
212520	212521	212518	212518	you	4330	” “
212532	212535	212536	212536	he	0	“ love , ”
212539	212563	212536	212536	he	0	“ Yes , you do . You know all right that you have never loved me . Have you , do you think ? ”
212564	212567	212568	212568	he	0	“ No , ”
212581	212589	212590	212590	she	4330	“ And you never will love me , ”
212594	212598	212590	212590	she	4330	“ will you ? ”
212612	212615	212616	212616	he	0	“ No , ”
212619	212622	212623	212623	she	4330	“ Then , ”
212626	212633	212623	212623	she	4330	“ what have you against me ! ”
212645	212653	212654	212654	his	0	“ If only I could kill her , ”
212660	212673	212654	212654	his	0	“ If only I could kill her — I should be free . ”
212689	212696	212697	212697	he	0	“ Why do you torture me ? ”
212708	212719	212720	212720	she	4330	“ Ah , I do n’t want to torture you , ”
212791	212797	212798	212798	she	4330	“ Say you love me , ”
212801	212816	212798	212798	she	4330	“ Say you will love me for ever — won’t you — won’t you ? ”
212849	212860	212861	212861	she	4330	“ Wo n’t you say you ’ll love me always ? ”
212864	212881	212861	212861	she	4330	“ Say it , even if it is n’t true — say it Gerald , do . ”
212882	212889	212890	212890	he	0	“ I will love you always , ”
212909	212917	212918	212918	she	4330	“ Fancy your actually having said it , ”
212935	212952	212953	212953	she	4330	“ Try to love me a little more , and to want me a little less , ”
213003	213012	213013	213013	he	0	“ You mean you do n’t want me ? ”
213016	213055	213013	213013	he	0	“ You are so insistent , and there is so little grace in you , so little fineness . You are so crude . You break me — you only waste me — it is horrible to me . ”
213056	213061	213062	213062	he	0	“ Horrible to you ? ”
213065	213094	213062	213062	he	0	“ Yes . Do n’t you think I might have a room to myself , now Ursula has gone ? You can say you want a dressing room . ”
213095	213110	213111	213111	he	0	“ You do as you like — you can leave altogether if you like , ”
213116	213123	213124	213124	she	4332	“ Yes , I know that , ”
213127	213144	213124	213124	she	4332	“ So can you . You can leave me whenever you like — without notice even . ”
213279	213282	213283	213283	she	4332	“ Gerald , ”
213286	213289	213283	213283	she	4332	“ Gerald . ”
213351	213357	213358	213358	she	4332	“ Gerald , my dear ! ”
213432	213438	213439	213439	she	4332	“ Turn round to me , ”
213549	213556	213557	213557	she	4332	“ My God , my God , ”
213599	213608	213609	213609	she	4332	“ Shall I die , shall I die ? ”
213690	213694	213680	213680	he	0	“ thou shalt , ”
213695	213700	213680	213680	he	0	“ thou shalt not . ”
213756	213761	213762	213762	she	4332	“ In the end , ”
213767	213775	213762	213762	she	4332	“ I shall go away from him . ”
213776	213784	213785	213785	he	0	“ I can be free of her , ”
213830	213836	213837	213837	he	0	“ Where shall I go ? ”
213841	213850	213851	213851	he	0	“ Ca n’t you be self - sufficient ? ”
213862	213867	213868	213868	he	0	“ Self - sufficient ! ”
214825	214832	214833	214833	he	0	“ What does the twilight matter ? ”
214836	214851	214833	214833	he	0	“ Why do you grovel before it ? Is it so important to you ? ”
214860	214864	214865	214865	she	160	“ Go away , ”
214868	214881	214882	214882	she	160	“ and leave me to it . It is beautiful , beautiful , ”
214890	214925	214882	214882	she	160	“ It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life . Do n’t try to come between it and me . Take yourself away , you are out of place — ”
214973	214985	214986	214986	she	160	“ That was the most perfect thing I have ever seen , ”
215003	215029	214986	214986	she	160	“ It amazes me that you should want to destroy it . If you ca n’t see it yourself , why try to debar me ? ”
215049	215053	215054	215054	he	0	“ One day , ”
215064	215085	215054	215054	he	0	“ I shall destroy you , as you stand looking at the sunset ; because you are such a liar . ”
215105	215108	215109	215109	she	160	“ Ha ! ”
215112	215121	215109	215109	she	160	“ I am not afraid of your threats ! ”
215154	215159	215160	215160	he	0	“ In the end , ”
215169	215183	215160	215160	he	0	“ when it reaches that point , I shall do away with her . ”
215615	215619	215621	215621	Gudrun	160	“ Of course , ”
215623	215657	215621	215621	Gudrun	160	“ life does n’t really matter — it is one ’s art which is central . What one does in one ’s life has peu de rapport , it does n’t signify much . ”
215658	215667	215669	215670	the sculptor	4354	“ Yes , that is so , exactly , ”
215672	215709	215669	215670	the sculptor	4354	“ What one does in one ’s art , that is the breath of one ’s being . What one does in one ’s life , that is a bagatelle for the outsiders to fuss about . ”
216005	216012	216013	216013	he	404	“ Sehen sie , gnädige Frau — ”
216016	216026	216028	216028	Gudrun	160	“ Bitte sagen Sie nicht immer , gnädige Frau , ”
216061	216070	216071	216071	she	160	“ Please do n’t call me Mrs Crich , ”
216116	216124	216126	216126	Loerke	404	“ What shall I say , then ? ”
216134	216141	216142	216142	she	160	“ Sagen Sie nur nicht das , ”
216150	216157	216142	216142	she	160	“ Not that , at least . ”
216191	216197	216198	216198	he	255	“ Soll ich Fräulein sagen ? ”
216203	216209	216210	216210	she	160	“ I am not married , ”
216333	216338	216339	216339	she	160	“ Truth is best , ”
217010	217012	217008	217008	she	873	“ goodness ”
218492	218503	218504	218504	he	255	“ What makes you so smitten with that little vermin ? ”
218572	218578	218579	218579	she	160	“ What do you mean ? ”
218582	218596	218597	218597	Her	160	“ My God , what a mercy I am not married to you ! ”
218617	218625	218626	218626	he	255	“ Tell me , only tell me , ”
218632	218643	218626	218626	he	255	voice—“tell me what it is that fascinates you in him . ”
218644	218650	218651	218651	she	160	“ I am not fascinated , ”
218659	218685	218651	218651	she	160	“ Yes , you are . You are fascinated by that little dry snake , like a bird gaping ready to fall down its throat . ”
218694	218705	218706	218706	she	160	“ I do n’t choose to be discussed by you , ”
218709	218720	218721	218721	he	255	“ It does n’t matter whether you choose or not , ”
218724	218783	218721	218721	he	255	“ that does n’t alter the fact that you are ready to fall down and kiss the feet of that little insect . And I do n’t want to prevent you — do it , fall down and kiss his feet . But I want to know , what it is that fascinates you — what is it ? ”
218793	218803	218804	218804	she	160	“ How dare you come brow - beating me , ”
218807	218830	218804	218804	she	160	“ how dare you , you little squire , you bully . What right have you over me , do you think ? ”
218891	218900	218902	218902	Gerald	255	“ It is not a question of right , ”
218941	219012	219013	219013	She	160	“ It ’s not a question of my right over you — though I have some right , remember . I want to know , I only want to know what it is that subjugates you to that little scum of a sculptor downstairs , what it is that brings you down like a humble maggot , in worship of him . I want to know what you creep after . ”
219027	219031	219032	219032	she	160	“ Do you ? ”
219044	219079	219032	219032	she	160	“ Do you want to know what it is in him ? It ’s because he has some understanding of a woman , because he is not stupid . That ’s why it is . ”
219095	219102	219103	219103	he	255	“ But what understanding is it ? ”
219106	219132	219103	219103	he	255	“ The understanding of a flea , a hopping flea with a proboscis . Why should you crawl abject before the understanding of a flea ? ”
219171	219191	219192	219192	she	160	“ Do n’t you think the understanding of a flea is more interesting than the understanding of a fool ? ”
219195	219199	219200	219200	he	255	“ A fool ! ”
219203	219214	219215	219215	she	160	“ A fool , a conceited fool — a Dummkopf , ”
219223	219231	219232	219232	he	255	“ Do you call me a fool ? ”
219235	219253	219232	219232	he	255	“ Well , would n’t I rather be the fool I am , than that flea downstairs ? ”
219275	219284	219285	219285	she	160	“ You give yourself away by that last , ”
219293	219300	219301	219301	he	255	“ I shall go away soon , ”
219309	219312	219313	219313	she	160	“ Remember , ”
219316	219335	219313	219313	she	160	“ I am completely independent of you — completely . You make your arrangements , I make mine . ”
219340	219350	219351	219351	he	255	“ You mean we are strangers from this minute ? ”
219377	219380	219381	219381	she	160	“ Strangers , ”
219384	219424	219381	219381	she	160	“ we can never be . But if you want to make any movement apart from me , then I wish you to know you are perfectly free to do so . Do not consider me in the slightest . ”
219575	219591	219572	219572	she	160	“ I shall always tell you , whenever I am going to make any change — ”
219721	219732	219733	219733	he	404	“ You are not married at all , are you ? ”
219742	219748	219749	219749	she	160	“ Not in the least , ”
219815	219818	219819	219819	he	404	“ Good , ”
219833	219840	219841	219841	he	404	“ Was Mrs Birkin your sister ? ”
219844	219847	219841	219841	he	404	“ Yes . ”
219848	219854	219883	219883	she	160	“ And was she married ? ”
219855	219860	219841	219841	he	404	“ She was married . ”
219861	219868	219841	219841	he	404	“ Have you parents , then ? ”
219869	219872	219874	219874	Gudrun	160	“ Yes , ”
219876	219881	219874	219874	Gudrun	160	“ we have parents . ”
219904	219907	219908	219908	he	404	“ So ! ”
219915	219925	219908	219908	he	404	“ And the Herr Crich , is he rich ? ”
219926	219937	219883	219883	she	160	“ Yes , he is rich , a coal owner . ”
219938	219948	219883	219883	she	160	“ How long has your friendship with him lasted ? ”
219949	219953	219908	219908	he	404	“ Some months . ”
219959	219966	219967	219967	he	404	“ Yes , I am surprised , ”
219972	219996	219967	219967	he	404	“ The English , I thought they were so — cold . And what do you think to do when you leave here ? ”
219997	220005	220006	220006	she	160	“ What do I think to do ? ”
220009	220023	220024	220024	he	404	“ Yes . You can not go back to the teaching . No — ”
220027	220090	220026	220026	his	404	shoulders—“that is impossible . Leave that to the canaille who can do nothing else . You , for your part — you know , you are a remarkable woman , eine seltsame Frau . Why deny it — why make any question of it ? You are an extraordinary woman , why should you follow the ordinary course , the ordinary life ? ”
220218	220222	220223	220223	she	160	“ You see , ”
220226	220233	220223	220223	she	160	“ I have no money whatsoever . ”
220234	220239	220240	220240	he	404	“ Ach , money ! ”
220247	220287	220240	220240	he	404	“ When one is grown up , money is lying about at one ’s service . It is only when one is young that it is rare . Take no thought for money — that always lies to hand . ”
220288	220292	220293	220293	she	160	“ Does it ? ”
220298	220316	220293	220293	she	160	“ Always . The Gerald will give you a sum , if you ask him for it — ”
220321	220328	220329	220329	she	160	“ I will ask anybody else , ”
220334	220338	220329	220329	she	160	difficulty—“but not him . ”
220345	220348	220349	220349	he	404	“ Good , ”
220352	220378	220349	220349	he	404	“ Then let it be somebody else . Only do n’t go back to that England , that school . No , that is stupid . ”
220434	220444	220445	220445	she	160	“ The only other place I know is Paris , ”
220448	220456	220445	220445	she	160	“ and I ca n’t stand that . ”
220478	220483	220484	220484	he	404	“ Paris , no ! ”
220487	220596	220484	220484	he	404	“ Between the réligion d’amour , and the latest ’ ism , and the new turning to Jesus , one had better ride on a carrousel all day . But come to Dresden . I have a studio there — I can give you work,—oh , that would be easy enough . I have n’t seen any of your things , but I believe in you . Come to Dresden — that is a fine town to be in , and as good a life as you can expect of a town . You have everything there , without the foolishness of Paris or the beer of Munich . ”
220639	220644	220645	220645	he	4448	“ No — Paris , ”
220648	220686	220687	220687	he	4448	“ it makes me sick . Pah — l’amour . I detest it . L’amour , l’amore , die Liebe — I detest it in every language . Women and love , there is no greater tedium , ”
220716	220722	220723	220723	she	4449	“ I think the same , ”
220726	220730	220731	220731	he	4448	“ A bore , ”
220734	220779	220781	220781	he	4448	“ What does it matter whether I wear this hat or another . So love . I need n’t wear a hat at all , only for convenience . Neither need I love except for convenience . I tell you what , gnädige Frau — ”
220799	220828	220829	220829	his	4448	aside—“gnädige Fräulein , never mind — I tell you what , I would give everything , everything , all your love , for a little companionship in intelligence — ”
220838	220842	220843	220843	he	4448	“ You understand ? ”
220851	220882	220843	220843	he	4448	“ It would n’t matter if she were a hundred years old , a thousand — it would be all the same to me , so that she can understand . ”
220912	220928	220929	220929	she	4449	“ I shall have to wait about eighty years to suit you , at that ! ”
220932	220942	220929	220929	she	4449	“ I am ugly enough , are n’t I ? ”
220958	220963	220964	220964	he	4448	“ You are beautiful , ”
220967	220986	220987	220987	he	4448	“ and I am glad of it . But it is n’t that — it is n’t that , ”
220996	221044	221045	221045	he	4448	“ It is that you have a certain wit , it is the kind of understanding . For me , I am little , chétif , insignificant . Good ! Do not ask me to be strong and handsome , then . But it is the me — ”
221053	221087	221045	221045	he	4448	oddly—“it is the me that is looking for a mistress , and my me is waiting for the thee of the mistress , for the match to my particular intelligence . You understand ? ”
221088	221091	221092	221092	she	4449	“ Yes , ”
221095	221099	221092	221092	she	4449	“ I understand . ”
221100	221109	221110	221110	he	4448	“ As for the other , this amour — ”
221126	221204	221205	221205	He	4448	troublesome—“it is unimportant , unimportant . Does it matter , whether I drink white wine this evening , or whether I drink nothing ? It does not matter , it does not matter . So this love , this amour , this baiser . Yes or no , soit ou soit pas , today , tomorrow , or never , it is all the same , it does not matter — no more than the white wine . ”
221241	221246	221247	221247	she	160	“ That is true , ”
221258	221273	221247	221247	she	160	“ that is true for me too . It is the understanding that matters . ”
221312	221317	221318	221318	he	4448	“ Do you know , ”
221335	221348	221350	221350	he	4448	“ your fate and mine , they will run together , till — ”
221358	221362	221363	221363	she	160	“ Till when ? ”
221389	221395	221396	221396	he	4448	“ I do n’t know , ”
221399	221405	221396	221396	he	4448	“ I do n’t know . ”
221961	221969	221970	221970	she	160	“ I have been thinking , Gerald , ”
221978	221988	221970	221970	she	160	“ that I shall not go back to England . ”
221989	221992	221993	221993	he	4448	“ Oh , ”
221996	222003	221993	221993	he	4448	“ where will you go then ? ”
222030	222041	222042	222042	she	160	“ I ca n’t see the use of going back , ”
222045	222054	222042	222042	she	160	“ It is over between me and you — ”
222075	222122	222067	222067	He	4448	“ Over , is it ? I believe it is over . But it is n’t finished . Remember , it is n’t finished . We must put some sort of a finish on it . There must be a conclusion , there must be finality . ”
222136	222144	222145	222145	she	160	“ What has been , has been , ”
222148	222162	222163	222163	She	160	“ There is nothing that I regret . I hope you regret nothing — ”
222170	222177	222178	222178	he	4448	“ Oh , I regret nothing , ”
222183	222187	222188	222188	she	160	“ Good then , ”
222191	222210	222188	222188	she	160	“ good then . Then neither of us cherishes any regrets , which is as it should be . ”
222211	222218	222219	222219	he	4448	“ Quite as it should be , ”
222232	222240	222241	222241	she	160	“ Our attempt has been a failure , ”
222244	222253	222241	222241	she	160	“ But we can try again , elsewhere . ”
222282	222287	222288	222288	he	4448	“ Attempt at what ? ”
222291	222299	222300	222300	she	160	“ At being lovers , I suppose , ”
222316	222327	222328	222328	he	4448	“ Our attempt at being lovers has been a failure ? ”
222338	222358	222334	222334	he	4448	“ I ought to kill her here . There is only this left , for me to kill her . ”
222376	222381	222382	222382	she	160	“ Has n’t it ? ”
222385	222395	222382	222382	she	160	“ Do you think it has been a success ? ”
222413	222426	222427	222427	he	4448	“ It had some of the elements of success , our relationship , ”
222430	222438	222427	222427	he	4448	“ It — might have come off . ”
222477	222480	222481	222481	she	160	“ No , ”
222484	222490	222481	222481	she	160	“ You can not love . ”
222491	222495	222496	222496	he	4448	“ And you ? ”
222517	222524	222525	222525	she	160	“ I could n’t love you , ”
222773	222783	222784	222784	she	160	“ I will go away the day after tomorrow , ”
223040	223051	223052	223052	she	160	“ It is n’t as if he really loved me , ”
223057	223230	223052	223052	she	160	“ He does n’t . Every woman he comes across he wants to make her in love with him . He does n’t even know that he is doing it . But there he is , before every woman he unfurls his male attractiveness , displays his great desirability , he tries to make every woman think how wonderful it would be to have him for a lover . His very ignoring of the women is part of the game . He is never unconscious of them . He should have been a cockerel , so he could strut before fifty females , all his subjects . But really , his Don Juan does not interest me . I could play Dona Juanita a million times better than he plays Juan . He bores me , you know . His maleness bores me . Nothing is so boring , so inherently stupid and stupidly conceited . Really , the fathomless conceit of these men , it is ridiculous — the little strutters . “
223270	223367	223368	223368	I	0	“ As for Loerke , there is a thousand times more in him than in a Gerald . Gerald is so limited , there is a dead end to him . He would grind on at the old mills forever . And really , there is no corn between the millstones any more . They grind on and on , when there is nothing to grind — saying the same things , believing the same things , acting the same things . Oh , my God , it would wear out the patience of a stone . “
223509	223759	223500	223500	I	0	“ At least in Dresden , one will have one ’s back to it all . And there will be amusing things to do . It will be amusing to go to these eurythmic displays , and the German opera , the German theatre . It will be amusing to take part in German Bohemian life . And Loerke is an artist , he is a free individual . One will escape from so much , that is the chief thing , escape so much hideous boring repetition of vulgar actions , vulgar phrases , vulgar postures . I do n’t delude myself that I shall find an elixir of life in Dresden . I know I sha n’t . But I shall get away from people who have their own homes and their own children and their own acquaintances and their own this and their own that . I shall be among people who do n’t own things and who have n’t got a home and a domestic servant in the background , who have n’t got a standing and a status and a degree and a circle of friends of the same . Oh God , the wheels within wheels of people , it makes one ’s head tick like a clock , with a very madness of dead mechanical monotony and meaninglessness . How I hate life , how I hate it . How I hate the Geralds , that they can offer one nothing else . “
223779	223794	223796	223796	she	4491	“ No , I wo n’t think of it — it is too much — ”
225420	225427	225417	225417	she	160	“ I shall be leaving tomorrow . ”
225428	225443	225444	225444	he	255	“ We will go together as far as Innsbruck , for appearance ’s sake ? ”
225447	225450	225451	225451	she	160	“ Perhaps , ”
226238	226241	226242	226242	he	404	“ Wait ! ”
226267	226271	226272	226272	she	160	“ Oh Loerke , ”
226275	226292	226272	226272	she	160	“ What an inspiration ! What a comble de joie indeed ! What is the Schnapps ? ”
226301	226304	226305	226305	he	404	“ Heidelbeer ! ”
226308	226333	226334	226334	she	160	“ No ! From the bilberries under the snow . Does n’t it look as if it were distilled from snow . Can you — ”
226341	226364	226365	226365	She	160	bottle—“can you smell bilberries ? Is n’t it wonderful ? It is exactly as if one could smell them through the snow . ”
226398	226403	226404	226404	she	160	“ Ha ! Ha ! ”
226564	226571	226572	226572	his	404	“ You are going away tomorrow ? ”
226578	226581	226572	226572	his	404	“ Yes . ”
226611	226614	226572	226572	his	404	“ Wohin ? ”
226643	226649	226650	226650	she	160	“ I do n’t know , ”
226664	226669	226670	226670	he	404	“ One never does , ”

229629	229637	229638	229638	she	160	“ There were n’t even any words , ”

231661	231667	231668	231668	she	4634	“ You ’ve got me , ”
231677	231682	231683	231683	he	4615	“ If I die , ”
231686	231696	231683	231683	he	4615	“ you ’ll know I have n’t left you . ”
231697	231701	231702	231702	she	4634	“ And me ? ”
231705	231714	231715	231715	he	4615	“ And you wo n’t have left me , ”
231718	231731	231715	231715	he	4615	“ We sha n’t have any need to despair , in death . ”
231739	231747	231748	231748	she	4634	“ But need you despair over Gerald ? ”
231751	231754	231755	231755	he	4615	“ Yes , ”
231857	231863	231864	231864	she	160	“ Did you need Gerald ? ”

231895	231933	231892	231892	he	3168	“ You are enough for me , as far as a woman is concerned . You are all women to me . But I wanted a man friend , as eternal as you and I are eternal . ”
231934	231941	231942	231942	she	160	“ Why are n’t I enough ? ”
231945	231970	231942	231942	she	160	“ You are enough for me . I do n’t want anybody else but you . Why is n’t it the same with you ? ”
231971	232013	232014	232014	he	4644	“ Having you , I can live all my life without anybody else , any other sheer intimacy . But to make it complete , really happy , I wanted eternal union with a man too : another kind of love , ”
232017	232024	232025	232025	she	160	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
232028	232040	232025	232025	she	160	“ It ’s an obstinacy , a theory , a perversity . ”
232041	232044	232045	232045	he	4644	“ Well — ”
