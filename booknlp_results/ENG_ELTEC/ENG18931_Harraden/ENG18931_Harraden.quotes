0	5	7	14	one of the guests at the English table	100	" YES , indeed , "
16	48	7	14	one of the guests at the English table	100	" yes , indeed , we start life thinking that we shall build a great cathedral , a crowning glory to architecture , and we end by contriving a mud hut ! "
49	61	63	65	the Disagreeable Man	102	" I am glad you think so well of human nature , "
81	110	63	65	the Disagreeable Man	102	" I should be more inclined to say that we end by being content to dig a hole , and get into it , like the earth men . "
163	171	173	175	beautiful Mrs. Reffold	27	" He is going to speak again , "
191	200	201	201	he	102	" Please , pass me the Yorkshire relish , "
381	389	390	390	she	108	" Is that what you asked for ? "
395	404	390	390	she	108	" or was it the water - bottle ? "
405	415	417	419	the Disagreeable Man	102	" You are rather deaf , I should think , "
422	458	417	419	the Disagreeable Man	102	" I only remarked that it was a pity you were not eating your dinner . Perhaps the scrutiny of the two hundred and fifty guests in this civilized place is a vexation to you . "
459	468	469	469	she	108	" I did not know they were scrutinizing , "
472	497	469	469	she	108	" and even if they are , what does it matter to me ? I am sure I am quite too tired to care . "
498	505	507	509	the Disagreeable Man	102	" Why have you come here ? "
512	521	522	522	she	108	" Probably for the same reason as yourself , "
525	532	522	522	she	108	" to get better or well . "
533	540	541	541	he	102	" You wo n't get better , "
545	568	541	541	he	102	" I know your type well ; you burn yourselves out quickly . And — my God — how I envy you ! "
569	577	578	578	she	108	" So you have pronounced my doom , "
598	601	602	602	she	108	" Listen , "
612	661	606	606	she	108	" because you are hopeless , it does not follow that you should try to make others hopeless too . You have drunk deep of the cup of poison ; I can see that . To hand the cup on to others is the part of a coward . "
893	904	905	905	he	30	" She has never been much to either of us , "
910	957	905	905	he	30	" And yet , when Malvina was alive , I used to think that she was hard on Bernardine . I believe I said so once or twice . But Malvina had her own way of looking at things . Well , that is over now . "
1714	1723	1724	1724	she	31	" You were not very cheering last night , "
1729	1741	1742	1742	he	102	" I believe I am not generally considered to be lively , "
1754	1768	1769	1769	she	31	" Still , I am sorry I spoke to you as I did , "
1774	1786	1787	1787	He	102	" It was foolish of me to mind what you said . "
1812	1821	1822	1822	he	102	" I have been here nearly seven years , "
1843	1986	1839	1839	he	102	" If you want to know anything about the place , I can tell you . If you are able to walk , I can show you some lovely spots , where you will not be bothered with people . I can take you to a snow fairy - land . If you are sad and disappointed , you will find shining comfort there . It is not all sadness in Petershof . In the silent snow forests , if you dig the snow away , you will find the tiny buds nestling in their white nursery . If the sun does not dazzle your eyes , you may always see the great mountains piercing the sky . These wonders have been a happiness to me . You are not too ill but that they may be a happiness to you also . "
1987	1998	1999	1999	she	147	" Nothing can be much of a happiness to me , "
2011	2029	1999	1999	she	147	" I have had to give up so much : all my work , all my ambitions . "
2030	2044	2045	2045	he	148	" You are not the only one who has had to do that , "
2049	2126	2045	2045	he	148	" Why make a fuss ? Things arrange themselves , and eventually we adjust ourselves to the new arrangement . A great deal of caring and grieving , phase one ; still more caring and grieving , phase two ; less caring and grieving , phase three ; no further feeling whatsoever , phase four . Mercifully I am at phase four . You are at phase one . Make a quick journey over the stages . "
2560	2571	2533	2533	They	164	" I am going to speak to this little thing , "
2586	2628	2572	2573	Mrs. Reffold	27	" I must find out who she is , and where she comes from . And , fancy , she has come quite alone . I have inquired . How hopelessly out of fashion she dresses . And what a hat ! "
2629	2641	2643	2646	one of the men	170	" I should not take the trouble to speak to her , "
2648	2665	2643	2646	one of the men	170	" She may fasten herself on to you . You know what a bore that is . "
2666	2679	2681	2682	Mrs. Reffold	27	" Oh , I can easily snub any one if I wish , "
2703	2719	2720	2720	she	27	" I had not a chance of speaking to you last night , Miss Holme , "
2723	2744	2720	2720	she	27	" You retired so early . I hope you have rested after your journey . You seemed quite worn out . "
2745	2749	2751	2751	Bernardine	31	" Thank you , "
2774	2783	2785	2786	Mrs. Reffold	27	" You are not alone , I suppose ? "
2788	2794	2796	2796	Bernardine	31	" Yes , quite alone , "
2798	2813	2815	2816	Mrs. Reffold	27	" But you are evidently acquainted with Mr. Allitsen , your neighbour at table , "
2818	2843	2815	2816	Mrs. Reffold	27	" so you will not feel quite lonely here . It is a great advantage to have a friend at a place like this . "
2844	2853	2855	2855	Bernardine	31	" I never saw him before last night , "
2857	2862	2864	2865	Mrs. Reffold	27	" Is it possible ? "
2872	2935	2868	2868	her	27	" Then you have made a triumph of the Disagreeable Man . He very rarely deigns to talk with any of us . He does not even appear to see us . He sits quietly and reads . It would be interesting to hear what his conversation is like . I should be quite amused to know what you did talk about . "
2936	2943	2945	2945	Bernardine	31	" I dare say you would , "
3026	3033	3034	3034	she	27	" Your father will miss you , "
3038	3045	3034	3034	she	27	" I should think probably not , "
3049	3059	3069	3069	she	31	" One is not easily missed , you know . "
3072	3081	3069	3069	she	31	" He is probably occupied with other things ! "
3082	3088	3094	3094	her	27	" What is your father ? "
3099	3109	3111	3111	Bernardine	31	" I do n't know what he is now , "
3114	3125	3111	3111	Bernardine	31	" But he was a genius . He is dead . "
3169	3221	3160	3160	she	27	" Dear me , how very unfortunate : a genius too . Death is indeed cruel . And here one sees so much of it , that unless one learns to steel one 's heart , one becomes melancholy . Ah , it is indeed sad to see all this suffering ! "
3268	3275	3276	3276	she	27	" One gentleman was a Russian , "
3279	3327	3276	3276	she	27	" Fancy coming all the way , from Russia to this little out - of - the - world place ! But people come from the uttermost ends of the earth , though of course there are many Londoners here . I suppose you are from London ? "
3328	3337	3339	3339	Bernardine	31	" I am not living in London now , "
3342	3351	3353	3354	Mrs. Reffold	27	" But you know it , without doubt , "
3356	3384	3353	3354	Mrs. Reffold	27	" There are several Kensington people here . You may meet some friends : indeed in our hotel there are two or three families from Lexham Gardens . "
3422	3454	3413	3413	She	31	" Have you asked all the questions you wish to ask ? And , if so , may I ask one of you . Where does one get the best tea ? "
3498	3512	3514	3514	Bernardine	31	" Now I have taught her a lesson not to interfere with me , "
3518	3524	3514	3514	Bernardine	31	" How beautiful she is . "
3544	3551	3553	3557	the taller of the two	185	" Well , I 'm blessed ! "
3563	3568	3570	3571	the other	166	" So am I , "
3578	3586	3588	3589	Mrs. Reffold	27	" Those are precisely my own feelings , "
3694	3699	3700	3700	he	37	" Ei , Ei ! "
3705	3726	3700	3700	he	37	" Marie is in a good temper to - day . I will give her a call as I pass . "
3787	3793	3794	3794	she	39	" Good day , Wäli , "
3809	3822	3794	3794	she	39	" I suppose you have a letter for me . How delightful ! "
3823	3832	3833	3833	he	37	" Never mind about the letter just now , "
3847	3897	3837	3837	his	37	" How nice to hear you singing so sweetly , Marie ! Dear me , in the old days at Grüsch , how often I have heard that song of the spinning - wheels . You have forgotten the old days , Marie , though you remember the song . "
3898	3912	3914	3914	Marie	39	" Give me my letter , Wäli , and go about your work , "
3942	3949	3950	3950	he	37	" Ah , ah ! Marie , "
3958	3982	3950	3950	he	37	" I know how it is with you : you only like people in fine binding . They have not always fine hearts . "
3983	3990	3992	3992	Marie	39	" What nonsense you talk Wäli ! "
3993	4053	3950	3950	he	37	" There , just hand me the oil - can . You can fill this lamp for me . Not too full , you goose ! And this one also , ah , you 're letting the oil trickle down ! Why , you 're not fit for anything except carrying letters ! Here , give me my letter . "
4054	4059	4061	4061	Wäli	37	" What pretty flowers , "
4063	4097	4061	4061	Wäli	37	" Now if there is one thing I do like , it is a flower . Can you spare me one , Marie ? Put one in my button - hole , do ! "
4098	4106	4108	4108	Marie	39	" You are a nuisance this afternoon , "
4128	4138	4140	4140	Marie	39	" Those Portuguese ladies will drive me quite mad , "
4142	4153	4140	4140	Marie	39	" They always ring just when I am enjoying myself ? "
4154	4161	4163	4163	Wäli	37	" When you are enjoying yourself ! "
4166	4170	4172	4172	Marie	39	" Of course , "
4174	4189	4172	4172	Marie	39	" I always do enjoy cleaning the oil - lamps ; I always did ! "
4190	4201	4203	4203	Wäli	37	" Ah , I 'd forgotten the oil - lamps ! "
4205	4211	4213	4213	Marie	39	" And so had I ! "
4215	4254	4213	4213	Marie	39	" Na , na , there goes that bell again ! Wo n't they be angry ! Wo n't they scold at me ! Here , Wäli , give me my letter , and I 'll be off . "
4255	4267	4269	4269	Wäli	37	" I never told you I had any letter for you , "
4271	4285	4269	4269	Wäli	37	" It was entirely your own idea . Good afternoon , Fräulein Marie . "
4338	4352	4333	4333	her	39	" Do step down one moment ; I want to show you something ! "
4353	4361	4363	4363	Wäli	37	" I must deliver the registered letters , "
4369	4380	4320	4320	She	39	" I have already wasted too much of my time . "
4381	4393	4395	4395	Marie	39	" Wo n't you waste a few more minutes on me ? "
4398	4408	4395	4395	Marie	39	" It is not often I see you now . "
4418	4433	4435	4435	Marie	39	" I want to show you such a beautiful photograph I 've had taken , "
4437	4444	4435	4435	Marie	39	" Ach , it is beautiful ! "
4445	4453	4455	4455	Wäli	37	" You must give one to me , "
4458	4467	4469	4469	Marie	39	" Oh , I ca n't do that , "
4483	4597	4472	4472	she	39	" It was a present to me from the Polish gentleman himself . He saw me the other day here in the pantry . I was so tired , and I had fallen asleep with my broom , just as you see me here . So he made a photograph of me . He admires me very much . Is n't it nice ? and is n't the Polish gentleman clever ? and is n't it nice to have so much attention paid to one ? Oh , there 's that horrid bell again ! Good afternoon , Herr Wäli . That is all I have to say to you , thank you . "
4635	4671	4613	4614	ROBERT ALLITSEN	40	" They will not care about you , and you will not care about the foreigners . So you will thus be thrown on your own resources , just as I was when I came . "
4672	4683	4684	4684	Bernardine	31	" I can not say that I have any resources , "
4687	4713	4684	4684	Bernardine	31	" I do n't feel well enough to try to do any writing , or else it would be delightful to have the uninterrupted leisure . "
4768	4776	4777	4777	she	31	" But now , having the leisure , "
4780	4787	4777	4777	she	31	" I have not the brains ! "
4788	4797	4799	4801	the Disagreeable Man	28	" I never knew any writer who had , "
4804	4812	4813	4813	she	31	" Perhaps your experience has been limited , "
4816	4823	4824	4824	he	984	" Why do n't you read ? "
4827	4847	4824	4824	he	984	" There is a good library here . It contains all the books we do n't want to read . "
4848	4855	4856	4856	Bernardine	31	" I am tired of reading , "
4859	4916	4856	4856	Bernardine	31	" I seem to have been reading all my life . My uncle , with whom I live , keeps , a second - hand book - shop , and ever since I can remember , I have been surrounded by books . They have not done me much good , nor any one else either . "
4917	4923	4924	4924	he	984	" No , probably not , "
4927	4991	4924	4924	he	984	" But now that you have left off reading , you will have a chance of learning something , if you live long enough . It is wonderful how much one does learn when one does not read . It is almost awful . If you do n't care about reading now , why do you not occupy yourself with cheese - mites ? "
4992	5003	4856	4856	Bernardine	31	" I do not feel drawn towards cheese - mites . "
5004	5030	4856	4856	Bernardine	31	" Perhaps not , at first ; but all the same they form a subject which is very engaging . Or any branch of bacteriology . "
5031	5048	4856	4856	Bernardine	31	" Well , if you were to lend me your microscope , perhaps I might begin . "
5049	5056	4856	4856	Bernardine	31	" I could not do that , "
5061	5068	5057	5057	he	984	" I never lend my things . "
5069	5079	5080	5080	she	984	" No , I did not suppose you would , "
5083	5094	5080	5080	she	984	" I knew I was safe in making the suggestion . "
5095	5110	5111	5111	he	984	" You are rather quick of perception in spite of all your book reading , "
5114	5177	5111	5111	he	984	" Yes , you are quite right . I am selfish . I dislike lending my things , and I dislike spending my money except on myself . If you have the misfortune to linger on as I do you will know that it is perfectly legitimate to be selfish in small things , if one has made the one great sacrifice . "
5178	5185	5186	5186	She	984	" And what may that be ? "
5222	5232	5233	5233	he	984	" Look at those asses of people on toboggans , "
5237	5254	5233	5233	he	984	" Could you manage to enjoy yourself in that way ? That might do you good . "
5255	5258	5259	5259	she	984	" Yes , "
5262	5273	5259	5259	she	984	" but it would not be any pleasure to me . "
5454	5457	5425	5427	the original character	211	" Disagreeable Man "
5759	5761	5763	5764	each other	167	" something "
5768	5770	5763	5764	each other	167	" something "
5905	5919	5920	5920	he	40	" I never saw a female wear a shawl more carelessly than you , "
5923	5934	5920	5920	he	40	" You do n't seem to know anything about it . "
6086	6088	6084	6084	He	40	" smoked "
6114	6139	6104	6104	people	946	" Excuse me , Sir or Madam , I must now take my temperature . We will resume the topic in a few minutes . "
6661	6665	6644	6644	He	264	" The Ideals . "
6695	6706	6707	6707	he	264	" Even if I faint by the way - side , "
6712	6738	6707	6707	he	264	" and am not able to reach the summit , still it is something to be on the road which leads to the High Ideals . "
6798	6804	6805	6805	he	269	" And yet another one , "
6808	6815	6805	6805	he	269	" What does it all mean ? "
6825	6832	6833	6833	he	264	" Old white - haired man , "
6836	6876	6833	6833	he	264	" tell me ; and so I have come at last to the wonderful Temple of Knowledge . I have been journeying hither all my life . Ah , but it is hard work climbing up to the Ideals . "
6887	6890	6891	6891	he	272	" Listen , "
6895	6943	6891	6891	he	272	" This is not the Temple of Knowledge . And the Ideals are not a chain of mountains ; they are a stretch of plains , and the Temple of Knowledge is in their centre . You have come the wrong road . Alas , poor Traveller ! "
6975	6981	6982	6982	he	42	" Can one rest here ? "
6986	6989	6982	6982	he	42	" No . "
6990	7003	7056	7057	the Traveller	264	" Is there a way down the other side of these mountains ? "
7004	7007	7056	7057	the Traveller	264	" No . "
7008	7015	6982	6982	he	42	" What are these mountains called ? "
7016	7022	7056	7057	the Traveller	264	" They have no name . "
7023	7035	7056	7057	the Traveller	264	" And the temple — how do you call the temple ? "
7036	7042	6982	6982	he	42	" It has no name ! "
7043	7054	7056	7057	the Traveller	264	" Then I call it the Temple of Broken Hearts , "
7075	7078	7079	7079	he	275	" Brother , "
7082	7196	7079	7079	he	275	" you are not the first to come here , but you may be the last . Go back to the plains , and tell the dwellers in the plains that the Temple of True Knowledge is in their very midst ; any one may enter it who chooses , the gate is not even closed . The Temple has always been in the plains , in the very heart of life , and work , and daily effort . The philosopher may enter , the stone - breaker may enter . You must have passed it every day of your life ; a plain , venerable building , unlike your glorious cathedrals . "
7197	7207	7209	7210	the Traveller	264	" I have seen the children playing near it , "
7212	7240	7209	7210	the Traveller	264	" When I was a child I used to play there . Ah , if I had only known ! Well , the past is the past . "
7261	7266	7267	7267	he	275	" Do not rest , "
7270	7296	7267	7267	he	275	" If you once rest there , you will not rise again . When you once rest , you will know how weary you are . "
7297	7306	7308	7309	the Traveller	264	" I have no wish to go farther , "
7311	7332	7308	7309	the Traveller	264	" My journey is done ; it may have been in the wrong direction , but still it is done . "
7333	7341	7343	7345	the old man	272	" Nay , do not linger here , "
7347	7481	7343	7345	the old man	272	" Retrace your steps . Though you are broken - hearted yourself , you may save others from breaking their hearts . Those whom you meet on this road , you can turn back . Those who are but starting in this direction you can bid pause and consider how mad it is to suppose that the Temple of True Knowledge should have been built on an isolated and dangerous mountain . Tell them that although God seems hard , He is not as hard as all that . Tell them that the Ideals are not a mountain range , but their own plains , where their great cities are built , and where the corn grows , and where men and women are toiling , sometimes in sorrow and sometimes in joy . "
7482	7487	7489	7490	the Traveller	264	" I will go , "
8050	8059	8060	8060	he	102	" You have come to a new world , "
8063	8158	8060	8060	he	102	" the world of suffering . You are in a fury because your career has been checked , and because you have been put on the shelf ; you , of all people . Now you will learn how many quite as able as yourself , and abler , have been put on the shelf too , and have to stay there . You are only a pupil in suffering . What about the professors ? If your wonderful wisdom has left you with any sense at all , look about you and learn . "
8634	8642	8643	8643	she	31	" It seems so little to ask , "
8651	8705	8706	8706	She	31	" I only want to be able to do a few strokes of work . I would be content now to do so little , if only I might do some . The laziest day - labourer on the road would laugh at the small amount of work which would content me now . "
8715	8726	8727	8727	he	102	" So you think you are moderate in your demands , "
8732	8879	8727	8727	he	102	" You are a most amusing young woman . You are so perfectly unconscious how exacting you really are . For , after all , what is it you want ? You want to have that wonderful brain of yours restored , so that you may begin to teach , and , perhaps , write a book . Well , to repeat my former words : you are still at phase one , and you are longing to be strong enough to fulfil your ambitions and write a book . When you arrive at phase four , you will be quite content to dust one of your uncle 's books instead : far more useful work and far more worthy of encouragement . If every one who wrote books now would be satisfied to dust books already written , what a regenerated world it would become ! "
9213	9223	9224	9224	she	31	" I so want to get better , chérie , "
9229	9283	9224	9224	she	31	" Life is so bright . Death : ah , how the very thought makes one shiver ! That horrid doctor says I must not skate ; it is not wise . When was I wise ? Wise people do n't enjoy themselves . And I have enjoyed myself , and will still . "
9284	9295	9296	9298	the Disagreeable Man	102	" How can you go about with that little danseuse ? "
9305	9313	9296	9298	the Disagreeable Man	102	" Do you know who she is ? "
9314	9317	9319	9319	Bernardine	31	" Yes , "
9321	9362	9319	9319	Bernardine	31	" she is the lady who thinks you must be a very ill - bred person because you stalk into meals , with your hands in your pockets . She wondered how I could bring myself to speak to you . "
9363	9373	9375	9376	Robert Allitsen	40	" I dare say many people wonder at that , "
9380	9384	9386	9386	Bernardine	31	" Oh no , "
9388	9410	9386	9386	Bernardine	31	" they wonder that you talk to me . They think I must either be very clever or else very disagreeable . "
9411	9419	9421	9422	Robert Allitsen	40	" I should not call you clever , "
9425	9428	9430	9430	Bernardine	31	" No , "
9433	9465	9430	9430	Bernardine	31	" But I always did think myself clever until I came here . Now I am beginning to know better . But it is rather a shock , is n't it ? "
9466	9474	9475	9475	he	40	" I have never experienced the shock , "
9478	9487	9488	9488	she	31	" Then you still think you are clever ? "
9491	9511	9512	9512	he	40	" There is only one man my intellectual equal in Petershof , and he is not here any more , "
9516	9538	9512	9512	he	40	" Now I come to remember , he died . That is the worst of making friendships here ; people die . "
9539	9554	9556	9556	Bernardine	31	" Still , it is something to be left king of the intellectual world , "
9558	9568	9556	9556	Bernardine	31	" I never thought of you in that light . "
9596	9606	9607	9607	he	40	" Why do you talk with that horrid Swede ? "
9611	9627	9607	9607	he	40	" He is a wretched low foreigner . Have you heard some of his views ? "
9628	9633	9635	9635	Bernardine	31	" Some of them , "
9638	9689	9635	9635	Bernardine	31	" One of his views is really amusing : that it is very rude of you to read the newspaper during meal - time ; and he asks if it is an English custom . I tell him it depends entirely on the Englishman , and the Englishman 's neighbour ! "
10082	10089	10090	10090	she	31	" Dear Wilfrid is so unselfish , "
10093	10109	10090	10090	she	31	" He will not have me stay at home . But I feel very selfish . "
10123	10135	10119	10119	her	31	" Oh no , Mrs. Reffold , do n't say that . "
10155	10161	10151	10151	Bernardine	31	" Mr. Reffold seems lonely . "
10162	10178	10180	10181	Mrs. Reffold	27	" Oh , he has a trained nurse , and she can read to him , "
10188	10196	10198	10198	Bernardine	31	" I had a trained nurse once , "
10200	10218	10198	10198	Bernardine	31	" and she could read ; but she would not . She said it hurt her throat . "
10219	10229	10231	10232	Mrs. Reffold	27	" Dear me , how very unfortunate for you , "
10234	10251	10231	10232	Mrs. Reffold	27	" Ah , there is Captain Graham calling . I must not keep the sledges waiting . "
10295	10299	10300	10300	she	27	" Miss Holme , "
10303	10333	10300	10300	she	27	" I have thought of such a splendid idea . Will you go and see Mr. Reffold this afternoon ? That would be a nice little change for him . "
10337	10343	10344	10344	she	31	" If you wish it , "
10405	10415	10416	10416	Bernardine	31	" Mrs. Reffold asks me to visit Mr. Reffold , "
10458	10467	10469	10469	Bernardine	31	" I do n't know whether I intrude , "
10471	10483	10469	10469	Bernardine	31	" but Mrs. Reffold said I might come to see you . "
10513	10522	10501	10501	She	351	" Are you paid for coming to me ? "
10541	10549	10550	10550	she	351	" No , I am not paid , "
10565	10572	10573	10573	he	48	" Ah , that 's well ! "
10581	10626	10633	10633	he	48	" I 'm so tired of paid service . To know that things are done for me because a certain amount of francs are given so that those things may be done — well , one gets weary of it ; that 's all ! "
10636	10641	10642	10642	he	48	" I lie here , "
10645	10657	10642	10642	he	48	" and the loneliness of it — the loneliness of it ! "
10658	10665	10666	10666	she	351	" Shall I read to you ? "
10680	10687	10688	10688	he	48	" I want to talk first , "
10691	10737	10688	10688	he	48	" I want to talk first to some one who is not paid for talking to me . I have often watched you , and wondered who you were . Why do you look so sad ? No one is waiting for you to die ? "
10738	10745	10746	10746	she	351	" Do n't talk like that ! "
10773	10783	10784	10784	he	48	" Are you one of my wife 's friends ? "
10787	10795	10796	10796	she	351	" I do n't suppose I am , "
10800	10824	10796	10796	she	351	" but I like her , all the same . Indeed , I like her very much . And I think her beautiful ! "
10825	10832	10833	10833	he	48	" Ah , she is beautiful ! "
10837	10866	10833	10833	he	48	" Does n't she look splendid in her furs ? By Jove , you are right ! She is a beautiful woman . I am proud of her ! "
10875	10878	10879	10879	he	48	" Beautiful , "
10885	10889	10879	10879	he	48	" but hard . "
10890	10894	10896	10896	Bernardine	31	" Come now , "
10898	10914	10896	10896	Bernardine	31	" you are surrounded with books and newspapers . What shall I read to you ? "
10915	10923	10924	10924	he	48	" No one reads what I want , "
10928	10951	10924	10924	he	48	" My tastes are not their tastes . I do n't suppose you would care to read what I want to hear ! "
10952	10955	10956	10956	she	31	" Well , "
10960	10968	10956	10956	she	31	" try me . Make your choice . "
10969	10978	10979	10979	he	48	" Very well , the Sporting and Dramatic , "
10982	11012	10979	10979	he	48	" Read every word of that . And about that theatrical divorce case . And every word of that too . Do n't you skip , and cheat me . "
11028	11035	11036	11036	he	48	" That is something like literature , "
11042	11056	11036	11036	he	48	" I can understand papers of that sort going like wild - fire . "
11168	11176	11177	11177	he	48	" You 're just a little brick , "
11192	11204	11188	11188	he	48	" And you 're not to be paid , are you ? "
11205	11211	11212	11212	she	31	" Not a single sou ! "
11215	11223	11188	11188	he	48	" What a strange idea of yours ! "
11224	11230	11231	11231	he	48	" You are not offended ? "
11235	11254	11231	11231	he	48	" But you ca n't think what a difference it makes to me . You are not offended ? "
11255	11261	11262	11262	she	31	" Not in the least ! "
11265	11294	11295	11295	He	48	" I know quite well how you mean it . You want a little kindness with nothing at the back of it . Now , good - bye ! "
11305	11315	11295	11295	He	48	" I say , will you come again soon ? "
11316	11326	11386	11386	she	27	" Yes , I will come to - morrow . "
11327	11373	11295	11295	He	48	" Do you know you 've been a little brick . I hope I have n't tired you . You are only a bit of a thing yourself . But , by Jove , you know how to put a fellow in a good temper ! "
11400	11408	11409	11409	she	27	" We 've had a splendid afternoon , "
11412	11490	11409	11409	she	27	" and we 've arranged to go again to - morrow at the same time . Such a pity you do n't come ! Oh , by the way , thank you for going to see my husband . I hope he did not tire you . He is a little querulous , I think . He so enjoyed your visit . Poor fellow ! it is sad to see him so ill , is n't it ? "
11536	11542	11543	11543	she	39	" The poor lonely fellow ! "
11865	11870	11871	11871	he	373	" These things occur , "
11873	12002	11850	11850	She	31	" It is not that they are worse here than everywhere else ; it is simply that they are together in an accumulated mass , and , as such , strike us with tremendous force . I myself am accustomed to these exhibitions of selfishness and neglect . I should be astonished if they did not take place . Do n't mix yourself up with anything . If people are neglected , they are neglected , and there is the end of it . To imagine that you or I are going to do any good by filling up the breach , is simply an insanity leading to unnecessarily disagreeable consequences . I know you go to see Mr. Reffold . Take my advice , and keep away . "
12003	12010	12011	12011	she	31	" You speak like a Calvinist , "
12017	12038	12011	12011	she	31	" with the quintessence of self - protectiveness ; and I do n't believe you mean a word you say . "
12039	12045	12046	12046	he	374	" My dear young woman , "
12049	12161	12046	12046	he	374	" we are not living in a poetry book bound with gilt edges . We are living in a paper - backed volume of prose . Be sensible . Do n't ruffle yourself on account of other people . Do n't even trouble to criticize them ; it is only a nuisance to yourself . All this simply points back to my first suggestion : fill up your time with some hobby , cheese - mites or the influenza bacillus , and then you will be quite content to let people be neglected , lonely , and to die . You will look upon it as an ordinary and natural process . "
12172	12177	12178	12178	she	31	" There are days , "
12181	12199	12178	12178	she	31	" when I ca n't bear to talk with you . And this is one of them . "
12200	12205	12206	12206	he	374	" I am sorry , "
12391	12401	12402	12402	he	374	" I 'm a chap that wants very little , "
12406	12415	12402	12402	he	374	" Those who want little , get nothing . "
12513	12522	12526	12526	herself	31	" If only I dared tell her now , "
12528	12535	12526	12526	herself	31	" loudly and before them all ! "
12545	12555	12556	12556	she	31	" After all , it is not my affair , "
12621	12624	12625	12625	he	48	" Stay , "
12628	12648	12625	12625	he	48	" It is not much of a pleasure to you , but it is a great pleasure to me . "
12689	12693	12694	12694	he	48	" Little Brick , "
12703	12774	12694	12694	he	48	" I have something on my mind . You wo n't laugh , I know . You 're not the sort . I know you 're clever and thoughtful , and all that ; you could tell me more than all the parsons put together . I know you 're clever ; my wife says so . She says only a very clever woman would wear such boots and hats ! "
12778	12781	12782	12782	she	31	" Well , "
12786	12790	12782	12782	she	31	" tell me . "
12791	12803	12804	12804	he	384	" You must have thought a good deal , I suppose , "
12807	12958	12782	12782	she	31	" about life and death , and that sort of thing . I 've never thought at all . Does it matter , Little Brick ? It 's too late now . I ca n't begin to think . But speak to me ; tell me what you think . Do you believe we get another chance , and are glad to behave less like curs and brutes ? Or is it all ended in that lonely little churchyard here ? I 've never troubled about these things before , but now I know I am so near that gloomy little churchyard — well , it makes me wonder . As for the Bible , I never cared to read it , I was never much of a reader , though I 've got through two or three firework novels and sporting stories . Does it matter , Little Brick ? "
12959	12965	12966	12966	she	385	" How do I know ? "
12970	13034	12966	12966	she	385	" How does any one know ? People say they know ; but it is all a great mystery — nothing but a mystery . Everything that we say , can be but a guess . People have gone mad over their guessing , or they have broken their hearts . But still the mystery remains , and we can not solve it . "
13035	13046	13047	13047	he	386	" If you do n't know anything , Little Brick , "
13050	13074	13047	13047	he	386	" at least tell me what you think : and do n't be too learned ; remember I 'm only a brainless fellow . "
13085	13091	13092	13092	she	385	" If I were you , "
13095	13289	13092	13092	she	385	" I should not worry . Just make up your mind to do better when you get another chance . One ca n't do more than that . That is what I shall think of : that God will give each one of us another chance , and that each one of us will take it and do better — I and you and every one . So there is no need to fret over failure , when one hopes one may be allowed to redeem that failure later on . Besides which , life is very hard . Why , we ourselves recognize that . If there be a God , some Intelligence greater than human intelligence , he will understand better than ourselves that life is very hard and difficult , and he will be astonished not because we are not better , but because we are not worse . At least , that would be my notion of a God . I should not worry , if I were you . Just make up your mind to do better if you get the chance , and be content with that . "
13290	13301	13302	13302	he	387	" If that is what you think , Little Brick , "
13305	13332	13302	13302	he	387	" it is quite good enough for me . And it does not matter about prayers and the Bible , and all that sort of thing ? "
13333	13341	13342	13342	she	388	" I do n't think it matters , "
13345	13395	13342	13342	she	388	" I never have thought such things mattered . What does matter , is to judge gently , and not to come down like a sledge - hammer on other people 's failings . Who are we , any of us , that we should be hard on others ? "
13396	13412	13413	13413	he	387	" And not come down like a sledge - hammer on other people 's failings , "
13417	13427	13413	13413	he	387	" I wonder if I have ever judged gently . "
13428	13434	13435	13435	she	388	" I believe you have , "
13443	13446	13447	13447	he	387	" No , "
13450	13501	13447	13447	he	387	" I have been a paltry fellow . I have been lying here , and elsewhere too , eating my heart away with bitterness , until you came . Since then I have sometimes forgotten to feel bitter . A little kindness does away with a great deal of bitterness . "
13509	13519	13520	13520	he	387	" I think I could sleep , Little Brick , "
13528	13547	13520	13520	he	387	" I want to dream about your sermon . And I 'm not to worry , am I ? "
13548	13551	13552	13552	she	388	" No , "
13563	13570	13556	13556	she	388	" you are not to worry . "
13600	13614	13615	13615	he	40	" I am going to Loschwitz , a village about twelve miles off , "
13618	13633	13615	13615	he	40	" And I have ordered a sledge . Do you care to come too ? "
13634	13642	13643	13643	she	31	" If I may pay my share , "
13646	13650	13651	13651	he	40	" Of course , "
13654	13677	13651	13651	he	40	" I did not suppose you would like to be paid for any better than I should like to pay for you . "
13681	13687	13688	13688	she	31	" When do we start ? "
13691	13694	13695	13695	he	40	" Now , "
13698	13771	13695	13695	he	40	" Bring a rug , and also that shawl of yours which is always falling down , and come at once without any fuss . We shall be out for the whole day . What about Mrs. Grundy ? We could manage to take her if you wished , but she would not be comfortable sitting amongst the photographic apparatus , and I certainly should not give up my seat to her . "
13772	13779	13781	13781	Bernardine	31	" Then leave her at home , "
14193	14203	14204	14204	she	31	" I have never before enjoyed anything so much , "
14207	14215	14216	14216	he	28	" So you have found your tongue , "
14219	14233	14216	14216	he	28	" Do you mind talking a little now ? I feel rather lonely . "
14270	14274	14275	14275	she	31	" You talk , "
14278	14287	14275	14275	she	31	" and tell me all about the country . "
14337	14348	14349	14349	he	28	" I ca n't trouble to hold it for you , "
14352	14397	14349	14349	he	28	" but I do n't mind opening it . The sun is blazing to - day , and you will get your eyes bad if you are not careful . That would be a pity , for you seem to me rather better lately . "
14398	14410	14412	14412	she	31	" What a confession for you to make of any one ! "
14414	14430	14431	14431	he	28	" Oh , I do n't mean to say that you will ever get well , "
14435	14469	14431	14431	he	28	" You seem to have pulled yourself in too many directions for that . You have tried to be too alive ; and , now you are obliged to join the genus cabbage . "
14470	14484	14485	14485	she	31	" I am certainly less ill than I was when I first came , "
14488	14510	14485	14485	she	31	" and I feel in a better frame of mind altogether . I am learning a good deal in sad Petershof . "
14511	14520	14521	14521	he	28	" That is more than I have done , "
14524	14532	14533	14533	she	31	" Well , perhaps you teach instead , "
14536	14559	14533	14533	she	31	" You have taught me several things . Now , go on telling me about the country people . You like them ? "
14560	14565	14566	14566	he	28	" I love them , "
14570	14620	14566	14566	he	28	" I know them well , and they know me . You see I have been in this district so long now , and have walked about so much , that the very wood cutters know me ; and the drivers give me lifts on their piles of timber . "
14621	14633	14635	14635	Bernardine	31	" You are not surly with the poor people , then ? "
14637	14658	14635	14635	Bernardine	31	" though I must say I can not imagine you being genial . Were you ever genial , I wonder ? "
14659	14673	14674	14674	he	413	" I do n't think that has ever been laid to my charge , "
14911	14914	14915	14920	An old woman over the way	427	" 1670 . "
15001	15013	14994	14994	She	427	" Liza , Fritz , Liza , Trüdchen , come quickly ! "
15022	15030	15015	15015	she	427	" Herr Allitsen , what a surprise ! "
15054	15064	15065	15065	She	427	" Liza , Fritz , Trüdchen , make haste ! "
15122	15135	15115	15116	The mother	434	" She notices no one now ; she sits there always waiting . "
15161	15164	15165	15165	he	40	" Catharina , "
15240	15248	15237	15237	she	133	" Waiting . I am always waiting . "
15352	15355	15356	15356	he	40	" Catharina , "
15367	15380	15356	15356	he	40	" do you remember how you used to cook me the trout ? "
15393	15403	15404	15404	She	59	" Will you cook me some to - day ? "
15446	15519	15438	15440	The old mother	442	" He was always so good to us all ; we love him , every one of us . When poor Catharina was betrothed five years ago , it was to Herr Allitsen we first told the good news . He has a wonderful way about him — just look at him with Catharina now . She has not noticed any one for months , but she knows him , you see . "
15665	15672	15674	15676	the old mother	442	" Liza will see to lunch , "
15678	15701	15674	15676	the old mother	442	" You shall have some mutton cutlets and some forellen . But before she goes , she has something to tell you . "
15702	15709	15710	15710	Liza	56	" I am betrothed to Hans , "
15715	15725	15727	15729	the Disagreeable Man	102	" I always knew you were fond of Hans , "
15731	15756	15727	15729	the Disagreeable Man	102	" He is a good fellow , Liza , and I 'm glad you love him . But have n't you just teased him ! "
15757	15764	15765	15765	Liza	56	" That was good for him , "
15769	15777	15765	15765	Liza	56	" Is he here to - day ? "
15785	15793	15794	15794	he	40	" Then I shall take your photographs , "
15828	15837	15838	15838	she	59	" I should like to cook the forellen , "
15864	15872	15873	15873	she	442	" Catharina , my best loved child ! "
15926	15931	15932	15932	he	40	" Why , Catharina , "
15935	15951	15932	15932	he	40	" you do n't mean you 've cooked them ? Then they will be good ! "
15995	16005	16006	16006	he	40	" Catharina was always sorry that I was ill , "
16009	16120	16006	16006	he	40	" When I stayed here , as I have done , for weeks together , she used to take every care of me . And it was a kindly sympathy which I could not resent . In those days I was suffering more than I have done for a long time now , and she was very pitiful . She could not bear to hear me cough . I used to tell her that she must learn not to feel . But you see she did not learn her lesson , for when this trouble came on her , she felt too much . And you see what she is . "
16296	16300	16301	16301	he	102	" Look happy ! "
16335	16347	16348	16348	he	102	" Look as though you were n't going to be photographed , "
16351	16383	16348	16348	he	102	" Liza , for goodness ' sake look as though you were baking the bread ; and Hans , try and believe that you are doing some of your beautiful carving . "
16513	16522	16523	16523	he	102	" That will be something like a picture , "
16534	16570	16523	16523	he	102	" Now I am going for about a mile 's walk . Will you come with me and see what I am going to photograph , or will you rest here till I come back ? "
16730	16736	16737	16737	she	59	" Fräulein is not strong , "
16741	16754	16737	16737	she	59	" If Fräulein lived here , I should take care of her . "
16803	16808	16809	16809	she	31	" Liza is betrothed , "
16817	16833	16809	16809	she	31	" They do n't tell me ; but I know . I was betrothed once . "
16855	16860	16852	16852	she	31	" Fräulein is betrothed ? "
16936	16950	16951	16951	she	59	" This is the first time Herr Allitsen has ever brought a friend , "
16954	16987	16951	16951	she	59	" He has always been alone . Fräulein is betrothed to Herr Allitsen — is that so ? Ah , I am glad . He is so good and , so kind . "
16994	17002	17003	17003	she	31	" No , I am not betrothed , "
17007	17022	17003	17003	she	31	" We are just friends ; and not always that either . We quarrel . "
17023	17029	17031	17032	Frau Steinhart	67	" All lovers do that , "
17035	17043	17045	17045	Bernardine	31	" Well , you ask him yourself , "
17062	17069	17050	17050	She	31	" See , there he comes ! "
17103	17126	17094	17095	Frau Steinhart	67	" Fräulein is a very dear young lady : Herr Allitsen has made a wise choice . He is betrothed at last ! "
17136	17142	17143	17143	he	102	" Stupid old Frau Steinhart ! "
17149	17163	17143	17143	he	102	" People like myself do n't get betrothed . We get buried instead ! "
17164	17169	17170	17170	she	31	" Na , na ! "
17173	17192	17170	17170	she	31	" What a thing to say — and so unlike you too ! No , but tell me ! "
17193	17203	17204	17204	he	102	" Well , I am telling you the truth , "
17207	17219	17204	17204	he	102	" If you wo n't believe me , ask Fräulein herself . "
17220	17226	17228	17229	Frau Steinhart	67	" I have asked her , "
17231	17240	17228	17229	Frau Steinhart	67	" and she told me to ask you . "
17364	17370	17371	17371	she	67	" Fräulein will come again ? "
17416	17436	17409	17410	Frau Steinhart	67	" It is a little disappointing to me , Herr Allitsen . I did so hope you were betrothed . "
17536	17543	17544	17544	he	102	" You are not warmly clothed , "
17547	17578	17544	17544	he	102	" I have an extra coat . Put it on ; do n't make a fuss but do so at once . I know the climate and you do n't . "
17604	17621	17598	17598	he	102	" So my friends took you for my betrothed . I hope you are not offended . "
17622	17628	17629	17629	she	31	" Why should I be ? "
17633	17655	17629	17629	she	31	" I was only amused , because there never were two people less lover - like than you and I are . "
17656	17664	17665	17665	he	102	" No , that 's quite true , "
17677	17695	17696	17696	she	31	" So that I really do n't see that we need concern ourselves further in the matter , "
17707	17727	17696	17696	she	31	" I 'm not offended , and you are not offended , and there 's an end of it . "
17728	17744	17745	17747	the Disagreeable Man	102	" You seem to me to be a very sensible young woman in some respects , "
17769	17836	17753	17753	He	102	" Although you have read so much , you seem to me sometimes to take a sensible view of things . Now , I do n't want to be betrothed to you , any more than I suppose you want to be betrothed to me . And yet we can talk quietly about the matter without a scene . That would be impossible with most women . "
17840	17847	17848	17848	she	492	" Well , I only know , "
17852	17889	17848	17848	she	492	" that I have enjoyed my day very much , and I 'm much obliged to you for your companionship . The fresh air , and the change of surroundings , will have done me good . "
17897	17911	17912	17912	he	493	" It is the least disagreeable day I have spent for many months , "
17916	17927	17928	17928	she	492	" Let me settle with you for the sledge now , "
17975	17985	17986	17986	he	493	" Here is the shawl you are always dropping , "
17989	18026	17986	17986	he	493	" You 're rather cold , are n't you ? Here , come to the restaurant and have some brandy . Do n't make a fuss . I know what 's the right thing for you ! "
18093	18121	18090	18090	he	493	" Good - night , and thank you for your companionship . It has been my birthday to - day , and I 've quite enjoyed it . "
18222	18225	18226	18226	she	39	" Willingly , "
18243	18247	18248	18248	she	39	" Anything more ? "
18295	18298	18299	18299	he	69	" Yes , "
18302	18310	18299	18299	he	69	" Here are five francs for you . "
18487	18490	18491	18491	she	39	" Ach ! "
18494	18502	18491	18491	she	39	" how I long to be home ! "
18514	18517	18518	18518	she	39	" Ach ! "
18521	18546	18505	18505	she	39	" and when I 'm there , I shall long to be here . Da wo ich nicht bin , da ist das Gluck . "
18691	18702	18703	18703	she	39	" It was my fault , it was my fault ! "
18706	18720	18703	18703	she	39	" I gave him the case . But how was I to know ? "
18739	18747	18748	18748	she	39	" And he gave me five francs , "
18751	18759	18748	18748	she	39	" I shudder to think of them . "
18781	18788	18789	18789	he	37	" It is from your Mutterli , "
18800	18836	18789	18789	he	37	" I give it willingly . I do n't like the look of one or two of the letters I have to give you , Mariechen . That Hans writes to you . Confound him ! "
18928	18933	18934	18934	she	31	" Poor old Marie , "
18937	18991	18934	18934	she	31	" Come and cry your kind heart out , and then you will feel better . Sit by me here , and do n't try to speak . And I will make you some tea in true English fashion , and you must take it hot , and it will do you good . "
19029	19037	19038	19038	she	39	" Fräulein Holme , I hate them . "
19041	19070	19038	19038	she	39	" I could never keep them . How could I send them now to my old mother ? They would bring her ill luck — indeed they would . "
19113	19119	19120	19120	she	39	" A beautiful tin wreath , "
19125	19144	19120	19120	she	39	" I know the exact kind . When my father died , we put one on his grave . "
19192	19204	19176	19176	He	102	" Well , there 's one person less in the world . "
19205	19215	19216	19216	Bernardine	31	" I think you make these remarks from habit , "
19532	19540	19541	19541	he	40	" Here is something to interest you , "
19544	19574	19541	19541	he	40	" an article on Realism in Fiction , or some nonsense like that . You need n't read it now . I do n't want the paper again . '' "
19582	19593	19541	19541	he	40	" she said , as she glanced at the article , "
19599	19600	19577	19577	you	40	" "
19611	19615	19616	19616	I	0	" he replied . "
19640	19641	19618	19618	I	0	" "
19644	19649	19618	19618	I	0	" she said eagerly , "
19662	19663	19655	19655	you	40	" "
19670	19674	19655	19655	you	40	" he answered , "
19681	19791	19676	19676	I	0	" She went to put on her cloak and , hat , and found him waiting for her at the top of the staircase . They passed out into the beautiful night : the sky was radiantly bejewelled , the air crisp and cold , and harmless to do ill . In the distance , the jodelling of some peasants . In the hotels , the fun and merriment , side by side with the suffering and hopelessness . In the deaconess 's house , the body of the Dutchman . In God 's heavens , God 's stars . Robert Allitsen and Bernardine walked silently for some time . "
19794	19798	19801	19801	me	0	" she said , "
19803	19804	19801	19801	me	0	" "
19810	19817	19801	19801	me	0	" he said half to himself , "
19896	19906	19907	19907	I	0	" He paused a moment , and then continued : "
19949	19962	19983	19983	my	0	" He paused again , and Bernardine was silent from mere awe . "
19969	19973	19983	19983	my	0	" he said , "
20086	20108	20128	20128	Dutchman	73	" . . . . Bernardine had unconsciously put her hand on his arm ; her face was full of suffering . "
20112	20121	20128	20128	Dutchman	73	" she asked , with almost painful eagerness . "
20132	20151	20124	20124	I	0	" he said deliberately . Bernardine 's hand fell from the Disagreeable Man 's arm . She shivered . "
20160	20169	20156	20156	you	543	" he said , almost tenderly for him . "
20174	20175	20170	20170	You	543	" "
20179	20188	20177	20177	I	0	" she said , with a short laugh . "
20212	20213	20177	20177	I	0	" "
20221	20225	20226	20226	One	958	" he asked . "
20235	20556	20226	20226	One	958	" she said , half in a whisper . Then he looked up , and saw all the pain on the little face . THE Dutchman was buried in the little cemetery which faced the hospital . Marie 's tin wreath was placed on the grave . And there the matter ended . The Kurhaus guests recovered from their depression : the German Baroness returned to her buoyant vulgarity , the little danseuse to her busy flirtations . The French Marchioness , celebrated in Parisian circles for her domestic virtues , from which she was now taking a holiday , and a very considerable holiday too , gathered her nerves together again and took renewed pleasure in the society of the Russian gentleman . The French Marchioness had already been requested to leave three other hotels in Petershof ; but it was not at all probable that the proprietors of the Kurhaus would have presumed to measure Madame 's morality or immorality . The Kurhaus committee had a benign indulgence for humanity — provided of course that humanity had a purse — an indulgence which some of the English hotels would not have done badly to imitate . There was a story afloat concerning the English quarter , that a tired little English lady , of no importance to look at , probably not rich , and probably not handsome , came to the most respectable hotel in Petershof , thinking to find there the peace and quiet which her weariness required . But no one knew who the little lady was , whence she had come , and why . She kept entirely to herself , and was thankful for the luxury of loneliness after some overwhelming sorrow . One day she was requested to go . The proprietor of the hotel was distressed , but he could not do otherwise than comply with the demands of his guests . "
20567	20571	20562	20562	you	546	" he said . "
20627	21571	20623	20623	I	0	" So the little tired lady had to go . That was how the story went . It was not known what became of her , but it was known that the English people in the Kurhaus tried to persuade her to come to them . But she had lost heart , and left in distress . This could not have happened in the Kurhaus , where all were received on equal terms , those about whom nothing was known , and those about whom too much was known . The strange mixture and the contrasts of character afforded endless scope for observation and amusement , and Bernardine , who was daily becoming more interested in her surroundings , felt that she would have been sorry to have exchanged her present abode for the English quarter . The amusing part of it was that the English people in the Kurhaus were regarded by their compatriots in the English quarter as sheep of the blackest dye ! This was all the more ridiculous because with two exceptions — firstly of Mrs. Reffold , who took nearly all her pleasures with the American colony in the Grand Hotel ; and secondly , of a Scotch widow who had returned to Petershof to weep over her husband 's grave , but put away her grief together with her widow 's weeds , and consoled herself with a Spanish gentleman — with these two exceptions , the little English community in the Kurhaus was most humdrum and harmless , being occupied , as in the case of the Disagreeable Man , with cameras and cheese - mites , or in other cases with the still more engrossing pastime of taking care of one 's ill - health , whether real or fancied : but yet , an innocent hobby in itself and giving one absolutely no leisure to do anything worse : a great recommendation for any pastime . This was not Bernardine 's occupation : it was difficult to say what she did with herself , for she had not yet followed Robert Allitsen 's advice and taken up some definite work : and the very fact that she had no such wish , pointed probably to a state of health which forbade it . She , naturally so keen and hard - working , was content to take what the hour brought , and the hour brought various things : chess with the Swedish professor , or Russian dominoes with the shrivelled - up little Polish governess who always tried to cheat , and who clutched her tiny winnings with precisely the same greediness shown by the Monte Carlo female gamblers . Or the hour brought a stroll with the French danseuse and her poodle , and a conversation about the mere trivialities of life , which a year or two , or even a few months ago , Bernardine would have condemned as beneath contempt , but , which were now taking their rightful place in her new standard of importances . For some natures learn with greater difficulty and after greater delay than others , that the real importances of our existence are the nothingnesses of every - day life , the nothingnesses which the philosopher in his study , reasoning about and analysing human character , is apt to overlook ; but which , nevertheless , make him and every one else more of a human reality and less of an abstraction . And Bernardine , hitherto occupied with so - called intellectual pursuits , with problems of the study , of no value to the great world outside the study , or with social problems of the great world , great movements , and great questions , was now just beginning to appreciate the value of the little incidents of that same great world . Or the hour brought its own thoughts , and Bernardine found herself constantly thinking of the Disagreeable Man : always in sorrow and always with sympathy , and sometimes with tenderness . When he told her about the one sacrifice , she could have wished to wrap him round with love and tenderness . If he could only have known it , he had never been so near love as then . She had suffered so much herself , and , with increasing weaknesses , had so wished to put off the burden of the flesh , that her whole heart went out to him . Would he get his freedom , she wondered , and would he use it ? Sometimes when she was with him , she would look up to see whether she could read the answer in his face ; but she never saw any variation of expression there , nothing to give her even a suggestion . But this she noticed : that there was a marked variation in his manner , and that when he had been rough in bearing , or bitter in speech , he made silent amends at the earliest opportunity by being less rough and less bitter . She felt this was no small concession on the part of the Disagreeable Man . He was particularly disagreeable on the day when the Dutchman was buried , and so the following day when Bernardine met him in the little English library , she was not surprised to find him almost kindly . He had chosen the book which she wanted , but he gave it up to her at once without any grumbling , though Bernardine expected him to change his mind before they left the library . "
21574	21584	20623	20623	I	0	" he said , as they walked along together , "
21596	21597	21599	21599	you	555	" "
21607	21611	21599	21599	you	555	" she said . "

21629	21648	21623	21623	I	0	" he said quietly . That was the first time he had ever alluded to his own health . "

22046	22047	22026	22026	I	0	" "
22059	22063	22050	22050	I	0	" he said . "
22080	22081	22065	22065	you	0	" "
22085	22089	22065	22065	you	0	" she said . "
22093	22094	22090	22090	I	0	" "
22105	22109	22095	22095	I	0	" he continued . "
22169	22170	22160	22160	I	0	" "
22173	22182	22160	22160	I	0	" she said , for he had paused . "
22193	22194	22160	22160	I	0	" "
22201	22205	22206	22206	You	0	" he said . "
22332	22336	22337	22337	I	0	" Bernardine laughed . "
22350	22354	22341	22341	I	0	" she said . "
22364	22365	22360	22360	I	0	" "
22370	22374	22360	22360	I	0	" he said . "
22416	22417	22418	22418	You	0	" "
22424	22428	22418	22418	You	0	" she asked . "
22431	22435	22418	22418	You	0	" he answered , "
22449	22495	22443	22443	you	0	" She expressed a wish to see it , and when they reached the Kurhaus , she went with him up to his beautiful room , where he spent his time in the company of his microscope and his chemical bottles and his photographic possessions . "
22513	22517	22506	22506	I	0	" he said . "
22538	22633	22506	22506	I	0	" She watched him preparing the tea ; he did everything so daintily , this Disagreeable Man . He put a handkerchief on the table , to serve for an afternoon tea - cloth , and a tiny vase of violets formed the centre - piece . He had no cups , but he polished up two tumblers , and no housemaid could have been more particular , about their glossiness . Then he boiled the water and made the tea . Once she offered to help him ; but he shook his head . "
22639	22644	22506	22506	I	0	" he said grimly . "
22655	22708	22709	22709	You	0	" After tea , they began the inspection of the new camera , and Robert Allitsen showed her all the newest improvements . He did not seem to think much of her intelligence , for he explained everything as though he were talking to a child , until Bernardine rather lost patience . "
22718	22722	22723	22723	I	0	" she suggested . "
22740	22754	22732	22732	you	0	" He looked at her as one might look at an impatient child . "
22761	22766	22732	22732	you	0	" he replied mildly . "
22788	22914	22915	22915	You	0	" But he took the hint all the same , and shortened his explanations , and as Bernardine was genuinely interested , he was well satisfied . From time to time he looked at his old camera and at his companion , and from the expression of unease on his face , it was evident that some contest was going on in his mind . Twice he stood near his old camera , and turned round to Bernardine intending to make some remark . Then he chanced his mind , and walked abruptly to the other end of the room as though to seek advice from his chemical bottles . Bernardine meanwhile had risen from her chair , and was looking out of the window . "
22921	22925	22915	22915	You	0	" she said . "
22963	22964	22948	22948	I	0	" "
22973	22977	22967	22967	you	0	" he asked . "
22988	22992	22978	22978	I	0	" she said . "
23056	23072	23039	23039	his	44	" The Disagreeable Man was standing by his camera again : his decision was made . "
23080	23085	23039	23039	his	44	" he said kindly . "
23119	23120	23111	23111	I	0	" "
23126	23136	23122	23122	you	0	" she asked , glancing at him in astonishment . "
23143	23190	23139	23139	I	0	" he said . He looked remarkably pleased with himself , and Bernardine could not help smiling . He looked just as a child looks when he has given up a toy to another child , and is conscious that he has behaved himself rather well . "
23199	23204	23191	23191	I	0	" she said frankly . "
23215	23216	23205	23205	I	0	" "
23231	23236	23229	23229	I	0	" he said thoughtfully . "
23239	23243	23229	23229	I	0	" she answered . "
23250	23251	23229	23229	I	0	" "
23254	23264	23229	23229	I	0	" he said , with a kind of relief , "
23276	23277	23280	23280	you	0	" "
23287	23291	23280	23280	you	0	" she asked . "
23312	23313	23296	23296	you	0	" "
23325	23329	23296	23296	you	0	" he replied , "
23370	23407	23438	23439	Herr Allitsen	58	" They fixed a time for the morrow , and Bernardine went off with the camera ; and meeting Marie on the staircase , confided to her the piece of good fortune which had befallen her . "
23418	23429	23416	23416	Marie	39	" she said . Marie raised her hands in astonishment . "
23441	23445	23448	23448	he	58	" said Marie . "
23457	23532	23533	23533	I	0	" Bernardine laughed and passed on to her room . And the Disagreeable Man meanwhile was cutting a new scientific book which had just come from England . He spent a good deal of money on himself . He was soon absorbed in this book , and much interested in the diagrams . Suddenly he looked up to the corner where the old camera had stood , before Bernardine took it away in triumph . "
23542	23549	23533	23533	I	0	" he said a little uneasily . "
23555	23568	23588	23588	she	581	" . . . Then a kinder mood took possession of him . "
23594	23627	23588	23588	she	581	" ONE afternoon when Mrs. Reffold came to say good - bye to her husband before going out for the usual sledge - drive , he surprised her by his unwonted manner . "
23633	23638	23588	23588	she	581	" he said sharply . "
23668	23690	23693	23693	you	581	" She was so astonished , that she at once laid aside her cloak and hat , and touched the bell . "
23696	23702	23693	23693	you	581	" Mr. Reffold asked testily . "
23710	23736	23693	23693	you	581	" she answered , with provoking cheerfulness . She scribbled something on a card , and gave it to the servant who answered the bell . "
23739	23793	23693	23693	you	581	" she said , with great sweetness of manner . And she sat down beside him , drew out her fancy - work , and worked away contentedly . She would have made a charming study of a devoted wife soothing a much - loved husband in his hours of sickness and weariness . "
23802	23806	23795	23795	you	581	" he asked . "
23812	23816	23795	23795	you	581	" she replied . "
23824	23825	23826	23826	You	581	" "
23835	23839	23833	23833	Winifred	77	" he said . "
23845	23850	23842	23842	I	0	" was the answer . "
23865	23866	23857	23857	I	0	" "
23877	23881	23867	23867	You	581	" he said , "
23905	23914	23903	23903	Winifred	77	" Mrs. Reffold looked up from her embroidery . "
23921	23925	23903	23903	Winifred	77	" she said . "
23930	23931	23934	23934	you	581	" "
23945	23950	23934	23934	you	581	" he said bitterly . "
23975	23976	23973	23973	you	581	" "
23990	23997	23977	23977	You	581	" she said , looking puzzled . "
24004	24009	24002	24002	you	581	" Mr. Reffold laughed . "
24013	24017	24002	24002	you	581	" he said . "
24039	24040	24033	24033	you	77	" "
24043	24051	24033	24033	you	77	" she said , in some surprise . "
24086	24120	24080	24080	You	581	" He turned wearily on his side , and made no answer . And for some time there was silence between them . Then he watched her as she bent over her embroidery . "
24128	24133	24126	24126	Winifred	77	" he said quietly , "
24151	24183	24147	24147	you	77	" Mrs. Reffold gave no reply , but she made a resolution to write to her particular friend at Cannes and confide to her how very trying her husband had become . "
24193	24198	24184	24184	I	0	" she thought meekly . "
24209	24229	24230	24230	I	0	" And Mrs. Reffold pitied herself profoundly . She stitched sincere pity for herself into that piece of embroidery . "
24236	24241	24232	24232	you	0	" continued Mr. Reffold , "
24324	24325	24317	24317	you	0	" "
24340	24349	24350	24350	I	0	" Mrs. Reffold said , with pathetic patience . "
24364	24365	24356	24356	You	0	" "
24368	24372	24356	24356	You	0	" he said ; "
24417	24694	24412	24413	Little Brick	53	" After that , it was some time before he spoke . He was thinking of his Little Brick , and of all the pleasant hours he had spent with her , and of the kind , wise words she had spoken to him , an ignorant fellow . She was something like a companion . So he went on thinking , and Mrs. Reffold went on embroidering . She was now feeling herself to be almost a heroine . It is a very easy matter to make oneself into a heroine or a martyr . Selfish , neglectful ? What did he mean ? Oh , it was just part of his illness . She must go on bearing her burden as she had borne it these many months . Her rightful position was in a London ball - room . Instead of which , she had to be shut up in an Alpine village : a hard lot . It was little enough pleasure she could get , and apparently her husband grudged her that . His manner to her this afternoon was not such as to encourage her to stay in from her drive on another occasion . To - morrow she would go sledging . That flash of light which reveals ourselves to ourselves had not yet come to Mrs. Reffold . She looked at her husband , and thought from his restfulness that he had gone to sleep , and she was just beginning to write to that particular friend at Cannes , to tell her what a trial she was undergoing , when Mr. Reffold called her to his side . "
24697	24717	24695	24695	Winifred	77	" he said gently , and there was tenderness in his voice , and love written on his face , "
24836	25013	24832	24832	I	0	" This great long fellow was so yearning for love and sympathy . What would it not have been to him if she had gathered him into her arms , and soothed all his irritability and suffering with her love ? But she pressed his hand , and kissed him lightly on the cheek , and told him that he had been a little sharp , but that she quite understood , and that she was not hurt . Her charm of manner gave him some satisfaction ; and when Bernardine came in a few minutes later , she found Mr. Reffold looking happier and more contented than she had ever seen him . Mrs. Reffold , who was relieved at the interruption , received Bernardine warmly , though there was a certain amount of shyness which she had never been able to conquer in Bernardine 's presence . There was something in the younger woman which quelled Mrs. Reffold : it may have been some mental quality , or it may have been her boots ! "
25017	25022	25014	25015	Little Brick	53	" said Mr. Reffold , "
25041	25042	25033	25033	I	0	" "
25054	25062	25045	25045	we	595	" said Mrs. Reffold , smiling sweetly . "
25071	25075	25064	25064	I	0	" he continued . "
25083	25084	25064	25064	I	0	" "
25087	25115	25064	25064	I	0	" said Bernardine , who was amused at the notion of Mr. Reffold apologizing to Mrs. Reffold , and of Mrs. Reffold posing as the gracious forgiver , "
25122	25135	25064	25064	I	0	" But she could not control her feelings , and she laughed . "
25143	25155	25136	25136	You	596	" Mr. Reffold said , in a reproachful tone of voice . "
25158	25178	25136	25136	You	596	" she said . And she laughed again . Mrs. Reffold 's forgiving graciousness had altogether upset her gravity . "
25188	25203	25179	25179	You	596	" Mrs. Reffold said . Bernardine looked at her hopelessly , and laughed again . "
25213	25217	25204	25204	I	0	" she said , "
25249	25356	25243	25243	I	0	" She recovered herself after that , and tried hard not to think of Mrs. Reffold as the dispenser of forgiveness , although it was some time before she could look at her hostess without wishing to laugh . The corners of her mouth twitched , and her brown eyes twinkled mischievously , and she spoke very rapidly , making fun of her first attempts at photography , and criticising herself so comically , that both Mr. and Mrs. Reffold were much amused . All the same , Bernardine was relieved when Mrs. Reffold went to fetch some silks , and left her with Mr. Reffold . "
25367	25373	25364	25365	Little Brick	53	" he said to her . "
25478	25479	25462	25462	you	598	" "
25492	25496	25497	25497	your	598	" she said ; "
25513	25520	25505	25505	you	598	" But he shook his head . "
25537	25541	25542	25542	I	0	" he said , "
25594	25607	25608	25608	I	0	" He took her hand and raised it reverently to his lips . "
25611	25615	25608	25608	I	0	" he continued , "
25712	25794	25704	25704	she	1077	" The little bit of happiness at which the poor fellow snatched , seemed to make him more pathetic than before . Bernardine promised to tell his wife , and went off to find her , making as an excuse a book which Mrs. Reffold had offered to lend her . Mrs. Reffold was in her bedroom . She asked . Bernardine to sit down whilst she searched for the book . She had a very gracious manner when she chose . "
25804	25809	25801	25802	Miss Holme	35	" she said kindly . "
25832	25833	25836	25836	I	0	" "
25840	25856	25836	25836	I	0	" Bernardine said , rather astonished that Mrs. Reffold should have noticed her at all . "
25893	25894	25871	25871	He	36	" "
25901	25907	25897	25899	a curious person	608	" Mrs. Reffold said smiling ; "
25933	25959	25924	25924	You	604	" She would have liked to say more on this subject , but experience had taught her that Bernardine was not to be trifled with . "
25969	25973	25960	25960	I	0	" Bernardine said , "
26013	26025	26011	26011	his	36	" She rose to go , but Mrs. Reffold detained her . "
26031	26035	26011	26011	his	36	" she said . "
26043	26061	26011	26011	his	36	" She was leaning back in an arm - chair playing with the fringe of an antimacassar . "
26073	26078	26011	26011	his	36	" she said suddenly . "
26110	26118	26103	26103	I	0	" Bernardine listened to her in astonishment . "
26121	26125	26103	26103	I	0	" she added , "
26154	26170	26171	26171	His	48	" She looked the picture of health . Bernardine gasped ; and Mrs. Reffold continued : "
26203	26204	26201	26201	you	0	" "
26211	26215	26209	26209	him	48	" Bernardine said . "
26225	26231	26219	26219	I	0	" Mrs. Reffold said piously . "
26246	26247	26209	26209	him	48	" "
26253	26259	26260	26260	He	48	" thought Bernardine to herself . "
26268	26273	26260	26260	He	48	" she went on : "
26296	26297	26288	26288	I	0	" "
26308	26334	26306	26306	you	0	" Bernardine asked mildly . Mrs. Reffold looked at her suspiciously . She was never quite sure that Bernardine was not making fun of her . "
26344	26354	26340	26340	I	0	" she added , as though in self- defence . "
26364	26365	26356	26356	he	48	" "
26376	26384	26370	26370	he	48	" Bernardine said , with some warmth . "
26480	26575	26478	26478	you	0	" She stopped suddenly , surprised at her boldness . Mrs. Reffold was still leaning back in the arm - chair , her hands clasped together above her beautiful head . Her face was pale . She did not speak . Bernardine waited . The silence was unbroken save by the merry cries of some children tobogganing in the Kurhaus garden . The stillness grew oppressive , and Bernardine rose . She knew from the effort which those few words had cost her , how far removed she was from her old former self . "
26583	26588	26580	26581	Mrs. Reffold	27	" she said nervously . "
26596	27307	26593	26594	Miss Holme	35	" was the only answer . THE Doctors in Petershof always said that the caretakers of the invalids were a much greater anxiety than the invalids themselves . The invalids would either get better or die : one of two things probably . At any rate , you knew where you were with them . But not so with the caretakers : there was nothing they were not capable of doing — except taking reasonable care of their invalids ! They either fussed about too much , or else they did not fuss about at all . They all began by doing the right thing : they all ended by doing the wrong . The fussy ones had fits of apathy , when the poor irritable patients seemed to get a little better ; the negligent ones had paroxysms of attentiveness , when their invalids , accustomed to loneliness and neglect , seemed to become rather worse by being worried . To remonstrate with the caretakers would have been folly : for they were well satisfied with their own methods . To contrive their departure would have been an impossibility : for they were firmly convinced that their presence was necessary to the welfare of their charges . And then , too , judging from the way in which they managed to amuse themselves , they liked being in Petershof , though they never owned that to the invalids . On the contrary , it was the custom for the caretakers to depreciate the place , and to deplore the necessity which obliged them to continue there month after month . They were fond , too , of talking about the sacrifices which they made , and the pleasures which they willingly gave up in order to stay with their invalids . They said this in the presence of their invalids . And if the latter had told them by all means to pack up and go back to the pleasures which they had renounced , they would have been astonished at the ingratitude which could suggest the idea . They were amusing characters , these caretakers . They were so thoroughly unconscious of their own deficiencies . They might neglect their own invalids , but they would look after other people 's invalids , and play the nurse most soothingly and prettily where there was no call and no occasion . Then they would come and relate to their neglected dear ones what they had been doing for others : and the dear ones would smile quietly , and watch the buttons being stitched on for strangers , and the cornflour which they could not get nicely made for themselves , being carefully prepared for other people 's neglected dear ones . Some of the dear ones were rather bitter . But there were many of a higher order of intelligence , who seemed to realize that they had no right to be ill , and that being ill , and therefore a burden on their friends , they must make the best of everything , and be grateful for what was given them , and patient when anything was withheld . Others of a still higher order of understanding , attributed the eccentricities of the caretakers to one cause alone : the Petershof air . They know it had the invariable effect of getting into the head , and upsetting the balance of those who drank deep of it . Therefore no one was to blame , and no one need be bitter . But these were the philosophers of the colony : a select and dainty few in any colony . But there were several rebels amongst the invalids , and they found consolation in confiding to each other their separate grievances . They generally held their conferences in the rooms known as the newspaper - rooms , where they were not likely to be interrupted by any caretakers who might have stayed at home because they were tired out . To - day there were only a few rebels gathered together , but they were more than usually excited , because the Doctors had told several of them that their respective caretakers must be sent home . "
27313	27324	27325	27326	The Doctor	498	" said little Mdlle . Gerardy , wringing her hands . "
27456	27457	27451	27451	her	612	" "
27475	27484	27462	27462	she	612	" said a Polish gentleman , M. Lichinsky . "
27632	27671	27628	27628	I	0	" Then a young American spoke . He had been getting gradually worse since he came to Petershof , but his brother , a bright sturdy young fellow , seemed quite unconscious of the seriousness of his condition . "
27679	27684	27685	27685	My	0	" he asked pathetically . "
27810	27851	27800	27800	they	630	" His cheeks were sunken , his eyes were leaden . There was no power in his voice , no vigour in his frame . He was just slipping quickly down the hill for want of proper care and understanding . "
27865	27874	27857	27857	I	0	" said an English lady , Mrs. Bridgetower . "
28106	28107	28108	28108	I	0	" "
28124	28130	28131	28131	She	637	" said little Fräulein Oberhof . "
28314	28315	28316	28316	One	958	" "
28329	28334	28316	28316	One	958	" said M. Lichinsky . "
28358	28456	28350	28350	You	47	" Even as he spoke , a stout lady thrust herself into the reading - room . She looked very hot and excited . She was M. Lichinsky 's mother . She spoke with a whirlwind of Polish words . It is sometimes difficult to know when these people are angry and when they are pleased . But there was no mistake about Mme . Lichinsky . She was always angry . Her son rose from the sofa and followed her to the door . Then he turned round to his confederates , and shrugged his shoulders . "
28460	28465	28466	28466	YOU	648	" he said hopelessly . "
28474	28483	28466	28466	YOU	648	" Robert Allitsen said one day to Bernardine , "
28501	28502	28493	28493	You	648	" "
28512	28518	28503	28503	I	0	" Bernardine answered rather peevishly . "
28528	28529	28530	28530	You	648	" "
28535	28539	28530	28530	You	648	" he said . "
28564	28565	28566	28566	You	649	" "
28570	28575	28566	28566	You	649	" she put in . "
28584	28585	28580	28580	me	0	" "
28599	28603	28580	28580	me	0	" he said , "
28637	28638	28629	28629	she	651	" "
28650	28707	28639	28639	I	0	" Bernardine said , highly indignant . She could tolerate his uppishness about subjects of which she knew far more than he did ; but his masterfulness about a subject of which she really knew nothing was more than she could bear with patience . He had not the tact to see that she was irritated . "
28718	28722	28708	28708	I	0	" he said ; "
28746	28753	28629	28629	she	651	" She flushed crimson with temper . "
28764	28769	28629	28629	she	651	" she said fiercely . "
28778	28868	28869	28869	Dear	654	" Then , after the fashion of angry women , having said her say , she stalked away . If there had been a door to bang , she would certainly have banged it . However , she did what she could under the circumstances : she pushed a curtain roughly aside , and passed into the concert - room , where every night of the season 's six months , a scratchy string orchestra entertained the Kurhaus guests . She left the Disagreeable Man standing in the passage . "
28872	28892	28869	28869	Dear	654	" he said thoughtfully . And he stroked his chin . Then he trudged slowly up to his room . "
28896	29162	28894	28894	me	0	" he said once more . Arrived in his bedroom , he began to read . But after a few minutes he shut his book , took the lamp to the looking - glass and brushed his hair . Then he put on a black coat and a white silk tie . There was a speck of dust on the coat . He carefully removed that , and then extinguished the lamp . On his way downstairs he met Marie , who gazed at him in astonishment . It was quite unusual for him to be seen again when he had once come up from table - d'hôte . She noticed the black coat and the white silk tie too , and reported on these eccentricities to her colleague Anna . The Disagreeable Man meanwhile had reached the Concert Hall . He glanced around , and saw where Bernardine was sitting , and then chose a place in the opposite direction , quite by himself . He looked somewhat like a dog who has been well beaten . Now and again he looked up to see whether she still kept her seat . The bad music was a great irritation to him . But he stayed on heroically . There was no reason why he should stay . Gradually , too , the audience began to thin . Still he lingered , always looking like a dog in punishment . At last Bernardine rose , and the Disagreeable Man rose too . He followed her humbly to the door . She turned and saw him . "
29174	29178	29166	29166	I	0	" he said . "
29185	29186	29183	29183	me	0	" "
29197	29203	29190	29190	I	0	" she answered , laughing . "
29210	29211	29208	29208	me	0	" "
29221	29225	29214	29214	I	0	" he said . "
29235	29284	29230	29230	I	0	" And with that he wished her good - night and went to his room . But that was not the end of the matter , for the next day when he was taking his breakfast with her , he of his own accord returned to the subject . "
29298	29302	29292	29292	I	0	" he said . "
29333	29334	29327	29327	my	0	" "
29344	29355	29342	29342	yours	0	" she said , as she poured out her coffee . "
29379	29380	29370	29370	you	0	" "
29387	29392	29381	29381	You	655	" he said grimly . "
29429	29444	29445	29445	You	655	" They both laughed , and the good understanding between them was cemented again . "
29451	29456	29445	29445	You	655	" he said suddenly . "
29520	29526	29514	29514	You	655	" Bernardine shook her head . "
29535	29539	29540	29540	I	0	" she said . "
29555	29556	29557	29557	You	655	" "
29563	29567	29557	29557	You	655	" he continued . "
29681	29682	29667	29667	I	0	" "
29693	29697	29687	29687	your	655	" she suggested . "
29705	29710	29687	29687	your	655	" he said solemnly . "
29719	29720	29711	29711	I	0	" "
29733	29760	29721	29721	You	655	" Bernardine said . At that moment Mrs. Reffold came into the breakfast - room , and , seeing Bernardine , gave her a stiff bow . "
29771	29788	29763	29763	you	655	" Robert Allitsen said . Bernardine then told him of her last interview with Mrs. Reffold . "
29803	29807	29808	29808	I	0	" he said . "
29880	29881	29882	29882	I	0	" "
29889	29893	29885	29885	you	0	" Bernardine said . "
29907	29908	29901	29901	her	27	" "
29920	29924	29911	29911	you	0	" he said . "
29931	29932	29911	29911	you	0	" "
29943	29948	29911	29911	you	0	" she replied quickly . "
29961	29965	29911	29911	you	0	" he said . "
29992	29993	29988	29988	geniuses	670	" "
29999	30003	29995	29995	I	0	" Bernardine said . "
30047	30059	30031	30031	She	672	" There were tears in Bernardine 's eyes as she spoke . "
30062	30069	30031	30031	She	672	" said the Disagreeable Man kindly , "
30077	30078	30079	30079	She	672	" "
30087	30090	30079	30079	She	672	" Bernardine said "
30100	30101	30102	30104	Poor little child	675	" "
30106	30114	30102	30104	Poor little child	675	" he said , half to himself . "
30129	30245	30117	30117	I	0	" But Bernardine did not hear him ; she was thinking of her friend . She was thinking , as we all think , that those to whom in our suffering we turn for sympathy , become hallowed beings . Saints they may not be ; but for want of a better name , saints they are to us , gracious and lovely presences . The great time Eternity , the great space Death , could not rob them of their saintship ; for they were canonized by our bitterest tears . She was roused from her reverie by the Disagreeable Man , who got up , and pushed his chair noisily under the table . "
30257	30262	30247	30247	you	676	" he asked cheerily . "
30275	30286	30247	30247	you	676	" Then as they went along together , he said : "
30336	30337	30371	30372	no one	157	" "
30343	30347	30371	30372	no one	157	" Bernardine asked . "
30385	30386	30371	30372	no one	157	" "
30413	30417	30404	30404	we	677	" he said . "
30459	30477	30478	30478	I	0	" They were standing outside the room set apart for the photograph - maniacs of the Kurhaus . "
30488	30492	30478	30478	I	0	" Bernardine said . "
30523	30530	30520	30520	I	0	" The Disagreeable Man smiled grimly . "
30541	30559	30520	30520	I	0	" he said . Then , feeling that he was on dangerous ground , he added quickly : "
30572	30636	30570	30570	you	39	" On her way to her room she stopped to talk to pretty Fräulein Müller , who was in high spirits , having had an excellent report from the Doctor . Fräulein Müller always insisted on talking English with Bernardine ; and as her knowledge of it was limited , a certain amount of imagination was necessary to enable her to be understood . "
30642	30646	30639	30640	Miss Holme	35	" she said , "
30657	30658	30654	30655	the Doctor	498	" "
30666	30670	30659	30659	You	35	" Bernardine said . "
30686	30687	30677	30679	the Spanish gentleman	684	" "
30690	30696	30677	30679	the Spanish gentleman	684	" was the merry answer . "
30709	30731	30732	30732	Mademoiselle	76	" At that moment the Spanish gentleman came out of the Kurhaus flower- shop , with a beautiful bouquet of flowers . "
30734	30846	30732	30732	Mademoiselle	76	" he said , handing them to Fräulein Müller , and at the same time putting his hand to his heart . He had not noticed Bernardine at first , and when he saw her , he became somewhat confused . She smiled at them both , and escaped into the flower - shop , which was situated in one of the covered passages connecting the mother - building with the dependencies . Herr Schmidt , the gardener , was making a wreath . His favourite companion , a saffron cat , was playing with the wire . Schmidt was rather an ill - tempered man , but he liked Bernardine . "
30858	30867	30856	30856	Fräulein	47	" he said , in his sulky way . "
30886	30887	30888	30888	You	0	" "
30895	30899	30900	30900	You	685	" she said . "
30908	30918	30900	30900	You	685	" he replied , looking up from his work . "
30931	30935	30928	30929	Herr Schmidt	86	" she said . "
30946	30947	30950	30950	Fräulein	47	" "
30989	30990	30986	30986	I	0	" "
30997	31014	30986	30986	I	0	" she answered as she took possession of her violets , and stroked the saffron cat . "
31025	31026	31016	31016	I	0	" "
31036	31040	31041	31041	She	691	" he said . "
31087	31336	31337	31338	Miss Holme	35	" She left him to his work , and went away , thinking . All the time she had now been in Petershof had not sufficed to make her indifferent to the sadness of her surroundings . In vain the Disagreeable Man 's preachings , in vain her own reasonings with herself . These people here who suffered , and faded , and passed away , who were they to her ? Why should the faintest shadow steal across her soul on account of them ? There was no reason . And still she felt for them all , she who in the old days would have thought it waste of time to spare a moment 's reflection on anything so unimportant as the sufferings of an individual human being . And the bridge between her former and her present self was her own illness . What dull - minded sheep we must all be , how lacking in the very elements of imagination , since we are only able to learn by personal experience of grief and suffering , something about the suffering and grief of others ! Yea , how the dogs must wonder at us : those dogs who know when we are in pain or trouble , and nestle nearer to us . So Bernardine reached her own door . She heard her name called , and , turning round , saw Mrs. Reffold . There was a scared look on the beautiful face . "
31340	31344	31337	31338	Miss Holme	35	" she said , "
31369	31422	31367	31367	I	0	" . . . . Bernardine took her hand , and the two women hurried away in silence . BERNARDINE had seen Mr. Reffold the previous day . She had sat by his side and held his hand . He had smiled at her many times , but he only spoke once . "
31426	31440	31423	31424	Little Brick	53	" he whispered — for his voice had become nothing but a whisper . "
31463	31515	31448	31448	God	44	" But that was yesterday . The lane had come to an ending at last , and Mr. Reffold lay dead . They bore him to the little mortuary chapel . And Bernardine stayed with Mrs. Reffold , who seemed afraid to be alone . She clung to Bernardine 's hand . "
31520	31525	31448	31448	God	44	" she said excitedly , "
31545	31609	31531	31531	I	0	" She expressed no sorrow , no regret . She did not even speak his name . She just sat nursing her beautiful face . Once or twice Bernardine tried to slip away . This waiting about was a strain on her , and she felt that she was doing no good . But each time Mrs. Reffold looked up and prevented her . "
31614	31618	31531	31531	I	0	" she said . "
31640	31779	31636	31636	you	35	" So Bernardine lingered . She tried to read a book which lay on the table . She counted the lines and dots on the wall - paper . She thought about the dead man ; and about the living woman . She had pitied him ; but when she looked at the stricken face of his wife , Bernardine 's whole heart rose up in pity for her . Remorse would come , although it might not remain long . The soul would see itself face to face for one brief moment ; and then forget its own likeness . But for the moment — what a weight of suffering , what a whole century of agony ! Bernardine grew very tender for Mrs. Reffold : she bent over the sofa , and fondled the beautiful face . "
31782	31809	31780	31781	Mrs. Reffold	27	" . . . she whispered . That was all she said : but it was enough . Mrs. Reffold burst into an agony of tears . "
31815	31819	31812	31813	Miss Holme	35	" she sobbed , "
31843	31911	31841	31841	myself	0	" And then it was that the soul knew its own remorse . SHE had left him alone and neglected for whole hours when he was alive . And now when he was dead , and it probably mattered little to him where he was laid , it was some time before she could make up her mind to leave him in the lonely little Petershof cemetery . "
31921	31928	31933	31933	you	0	" she said to the Doctor . "
31940	31994	31933	31933	you	0	" thought the Doctor . But he did not say that : he just urged her quietly to have her husband buried in Petershof ; and she yielded . So they laid him to rest in the dreary cemetery . Bernardine went to the funeral , much against the Disagreeable Man 's wish . "
32003	32009	32001	32001	yourself	0	" he said to her . "
32019	32026	32001	32001	yourself	0	" But she shook her head . "
32030	32034	32001	32001	yourself	0	" she said . "
32054	32119	32049	32049	she	27	" The Disagreeable Man shrugged his shoulders , and went off by himself . Mrs. Reffold clung very much to Bernardine those last days before she left Petershof . She had decided to go to Wiesbaden , where she had relations ; and she invited Bernardine to go with her : it was more than that , she almost begged her . Bernardine refused . "
32129	32133	32120	32120	I	0	" she said , "
32150	32151	32143	32143	I	0	" "
32161	32166	32143	32143	I	0	" Mrs. Reffold suggested . "
32176	32183	32168	32168	I	0	" Bernardine could not be persuaded . "
32186	32190	32168	32168	I	0	" she said . "
32311	32343	32305	32305	you	0	" So they parted . Mrs. Reffold had spoken no word of affection to Bernardine , but at the station , as she bent down to kiss her , she whispered : "
32382	32446	32377	32377	you	0	" And Bernardine promised . When she got back to her room , she found a small packet on her table . It contained Mr. Reffold 's watch - chain . She had so often seen him playing with it . There was a little piece of paper enclosed with it , and Mr. Reffold had written on it some two months ago : "
32470	32563	32564	32564	I	0	" Bernardine unfastened her watch from the black hair cord , and attached it instead to Mr. Reffold 's massive gold chain . As she sat there fiddling with it , the idea seized her that she would be all the better for a day 's outing . At first she thought she would go alone , and then she decided to ask Robert Allitsen . She learnt from Marie that he was in the dark room , and she hastened down . She knocked several times before there was any answer . "
32572	32576	32564	32564	I	0	" he said . "
32581	32582	32583	32583	I	0	" "
32590	32605	32583	32583	I	0	" she said . The Disagreeable Man opened the door of the dark room . "
32612	32626	32606	32606	My	0	" he said gruffly . Then seeing Bernardine standing there , he added : "
32638	32639	32633	32633	you	0	" "
32642	32654	32633	32633	you	0	" she said , smiling at his sudden change of manner . "
32674	32697	32671	32671	you	0	" He made no answer , and retired once more into the dark room . Then he came out with his camera . "
32706	32711	32712	32712	I	0	" he said cheerily . "
32722	32767	32719	32720	those peasants	702	" In half an hours time they were on their way . It was the same drive as before : and since then , Bernardine had seen more of the country , and was more accustomed to the wonderful white scenery : but still the "
32770	32931	32932	32932	I	0	" awed her , and still the deep silence held her . It was the same scene , and yet not the same either , for the season was now far advanced , and the melting of the snows had begun . In the far distance the whiteness seemed as before ; but on the slopes near at hand , the green was beginning to assert itself , and some of the great trees had cast off their heavy burdens , and appeared more gloomy in their freedom than in the days of their snow - bondage . The roads were no longer quite so even as before ; the sledge glided along when it could , and bumped along when it must . Still , there was sufficient snow left to make the drive possible , and even pleasant . The two companions were quiet . Once only the Disagreeable Man made a remark , and then he said : "
32941	32942	32943	32943	You	0	" "
32948	32952	32943	32943	You	0	" Bernardine remarked . "
32960	32974	32955	32955	I	0	" he answered in his grim way . Then came a long pause . "
32984	32988	32955	32955	I	0	" he said . "
33017	33018	32955	32955	I	0	" "
33032	33036	33024	33024	I	0	" she said ; "
33098	33099	33082	33083	my uncle	993	" "
33105	33113	33101	33101	you	0	" the Disagreeable Man asked rather timidly . "
33120	33125	33114	33114	I	0	" she answered brightly . "
33137	33138	33161	33161	You	0	" "
33153	33160	33161	33161	You	0	" he said half to himself . "
33178	33179	33195	33195	I	0	" "
33189	33193	33195	33195	I	0	" she answered ; "
33250	33251	33253	33253	you	0	" "
33260	33264	33253	33253	you	0	" he said . "
33276	33277	33278	33278	You	0	" "
33288	33293	33282	33282	you	0	" she said sharply . "
33297	33301	33295	33295	you	0	" he replied . "
33310	33311	33305	33305	them	707	" "
33319	33325	33305	33305	them	707	" she said rather heartlessly . "
33350	33351	33336	33336	you	0	" "
33360	33386	33353	33353	I	0	" he repeated , in the bitterness of his heart . Bernardine did not notice : she was on a subject which always excited her . "
33398	33402	33394	33396	the political women	711	" she said , "
33467	33468	33473	33473	them	718	" "
33475	33481	33473	33473	them	718	" asked the Disagreeable Man ; "
33492	33493	33494	33500	The Girton girl of ten years ago	716	" "
33502	33506	33494	33500	The Girton girl of ten years ago	716	" said Bernardine , "
33618	33619	33626	33626	I	0	" "
33629	33633	33647	33647	she	716	" he interrupted . "
33657	33674	33675	33675	she	716	" continued Bernardine , looking at the Disagreeable Man , and not seeming to see him : "
33695	33700	33675	33675	she	716	" Here she paused . "
33714	33718	33705	33705	me	0	" she said . "
33737	33738	33724	33724	you	0	" "
33744	33748	33724	33724	you	0	" he asked . "
33758	33759	33760	33760	I	0	" "
33778	33783	33762	33762	you	0	" she said frankly . "
33797	33798	33784	33784	You	0	" "
33814	33818	33800	33800	I	0	" he said , "
33841	33845	33835	33835	you	0	" Bernardine laughed . "
33856	33864	33847	33847	I	0	" she said , and then added , "
33870	33917	33847	33847	I	0	" And that was the end of the matter , for the word spread about that Herr Allitsen had arrived , and every one turned out to give the two guests greeting . Frau Steinhart smothered Bernardine with motherly tenderness , and whispered in her ear : "
33934	34057	33928	33928	I	0	" But Bernardine smiled and shook her head , and went to greet the others who crowded round them ; and at last poor Catharina drew near too , holding Bernardine 's hand lovingly within her own . Then Hans , Liza 's lover , came upon the scene , and Liza told the Disagreeable Man that she and Hans were to be married in a month 's time . And the Disagreeable Man , much to Bernardine 's amazement , drew from his pocket a small parcel , which he confided to Liza 's care . Every one pressed round her while she opened it , and found what she had so often wished for , a silver watch and chain . "
34060	34064	33928	33928	I	0	" she cried , "
34086	34133	34082	34082	Susanna	88	" Then there were the photographs to be examined . Liza looked with stubborn disapproval on the pictures of herself in her working - dress . But she did not conceal her admiration of the portraits which showed her to the world in her best finery . "
34136	34140	34082	34082	Susanna	88	" she cried , "
34148	34250	34082	34082	Susanna	88	" The Disagreeable Man grunted , but behaved after the fashion of a hero , claiming , however , a little silent sympathy from Bernardine . It was a pleasant , homely scene : and Bernardine , who , felt quite at her ease amongst these people , chatted away with them as though she had known them all her life . Then Frau Steinhart suddenly remembered that her guests needed some food , and Liza was despatched to her duties as cook ; though it was some time before she could be induced to leave off looking at the photographs . "
34258	34264	34254	34254	you	733	" said the Disagreeable Man . "
34275	34290	34291	34291	Liza	56	" She ran off laughing , and finally Bernardine found herself alone with Catharina . "
34296	34302	34303	34303	She	735	" she said to Bernardine . "
34310	34311	34303	34303	She	735	" "
34318	34325	34326	34326	Fräulein	39	" Bernardine said half to herself . "
34329	34341	34326	34326	Fräulein	39	" Catharina asked eagerly . Bernardine looked wistfully at her companion . "
34346	34350	34326	34326	Fräulein	39	" she said . "
34360	34361	34326	34326	Fräulein	39	" "
34368	34374	34363	34363	you	59	" Catharina said almost proudly . "
34379	34592	34376	34376	I	0	" She spoke no more after that , but took up her knitting , and watched Bernardine playing with the kittens . She was playing with the kittens , and she was thinking ; and all the time she felt conscious that this peasant woman , stricken in mind and body , was pitying her because that great happiness of loving and being loved had not come into her life . It had seemed something apart from her ; she had never even wanted it . She had wished to stand alone , like a little rock out at sea . And now ? In a few minutes the Disagreeable Man and she sat down to their meal . In spite of her excitement , Liza managed to prepare everything nicely ; though when she was making the omelette aux fines herbes , she had to be kept guarded lest she might run off to have another look at the silver watch and the photographs of herself in her finest frock ! Then Bernardine and Robert Allitsen drank to the health of Hans and Liza : and then came the time of reckoning . When he was paying the bill , Frau Steinhart , having given him the change , said coaxingly : "
34648	34649	34650	34650	You	736	" "
34659	34664	34650	34650	You	736	" he said quietly . "
34681	34699	34665	34665	You	736	" But seeing that she looked troubled lest she might have offended him , he added quickly : "
34718	34895	34710	34710	you	740	" And she had to be content with that . She asked no more questions of either of them : but she was terribly disappointed . There was something a little comical in her disappointment ; but Robert Allitsen was not amused at it , as he had been on a former occasion . As he leaned back in the sledge , with the same girl for his companion , he recalled his feelings . He had been astonished and amused , and perhaps a little shy , and a great deal relieved that she had been sensible enough to be amused too . And now ? They had been constantly together for many months : he who had never cared before for companionship , had found himself turning more and more to her . And now he was going to lose her . He looked up once or twice to make sure that she was still by his side : she sat there so quietly . At last he spoke in his usual gruff way . "
34909	34913	34897	34897	you	741	" he asked . "
34925	34940	34916	34916	I	0	" she answered , trying to be bright . But she was not bright . "
34956	34963	34943	34943	you	741	" he said after a pause . "
34969	34970	34965	34965	you	741	" "
34976	34980	34965	34965	you	741	" she said . "
35032	35033	35025	35025	you	0	" "
35036	35040	35025	35025	you	0	" he answered . "
35049	35050	35004	35004	you	0	" "
35059	35063	35004	35004	you	0	" she asked , "
35071	35072	35004	35004	you	0	" "
35075	35079	35004	35004	you	0	" he sneered . "
35190	35191	35202	35202	We	745	" "
35197	35201	35202	35202	We	745	" she said . "
35211	35215	35202	35202	We	745	" he continued ; "
35326	35327	35321	35321	they	748	" "
35337	35341	35321	35321	they	748	" she said . "
35694	35695	35696	35696	I	0	" "
35705	35711	35696	35696	I	0	" the Disagreeable Man said . "
35719	35723	35696	35696	I	0	" she said . "
35737	35775	35776	35776	You	768	" He shrugged his shoulders , and the two comrades fell into silence again . They were within two miles of Petershof , when he broke the silence : there was something wonderfully gentle in his voice . "
35780	35784	35776	35776	You	768	" he said , "
35828	35829	35802	35802	me	0	" "
35832	35846	35802	35802	me	0	" she said kindly ; she wondered what he could have to say . "
35856	35860	35847	35847	I	0	" he continued , "
35964	35991	35958	35958	I	0	" . . . . He stopped suddenly . The tears had gathered in Bernardine 's eyes her hand rested for one moment on his arm . "
35995	35999	36000	36000	you	36	" she said , "
36092	36111	36084	36084	I	0	" A smile passed over the Disagreeable Man 's face , one of his rare , beautiful smiles . "
36118	36123	36115	36115	your	36	" he said quietly , "
36134	36446	36129	36129	I	0	" Then a few minutes brought them back to Petershof . HE had loved her so patiently , and now he felt that he must have his answer . It was only fair to her , and to himself too , that he should know exactly where he stood in her affections . She had certainly given him little signs here and there , which had made him believe that she was not indifferent to his admiration . Little signs were all very well for a short time ; but meanwhile the season was coming to an end : she had told him that she was going back to her work at home . And then perhaps he would lose her altogether . It would not be safe now for him to delay a single day longer . So the little postman armed himself with courage . Wäli 's brain was muddled that day . He who prided himself upon knowing the names of all the guests in Petershof , made the most absurd mistakes about people and letters too ; and received in acknowledgment of his stupidity a series of scoldings which would have unnerved a stronger person than the little hunchback postman . In fact , he ceased to care how he gave out the letters : all the envelopes seemed to have the same name on them : Marie Truog . Every word which he tried to decipher turned to that ; so finally he tried no more , leaving the destination of the letter to be decided by the impulse of the moment . At last he arrived at that quarter of the Kurhaus where Marie held sway . He heard her singing in her pantry . Suddenly she was summoned downstairs by an impatient bellringer , and on her return found Wäli waiting in the passage . "
36453	36463	36464	36464	you	774	" she cried , throwing a letter at him ; "
36475	36506	36464	36464	you	774	" Then some one else rang , and Marie hurried off again . She came back with another letter in her hand , and found Wäli sitting in her pantry . "
36516	36520	36522	36522	Madame	75	" she said , "
36560	36574	36555	36555	I	0	" Wäli took off his little round hat , and wiped his forehead . "
36585	36656	36583	36583	Marie	39	" he said ; something has gone wrong with me . Every name I look at turns to Marie Truog . I ought to have brought every one of the letters to you . But I knew they could not be all for you , though you have so many admirers . For they would not be likely to write at the same time , to catch the same post . "
36657	36667	36669	36669	Marie	39	" It would be very dull if they did , "
36688	36700	36701	36703	the little postman	1453	" But I am the one who loves you , Mariechen , "
36706	36747	36701	36703	the little postman	1453	" I have always loved you ever since I can remember . I am not much to look at , Mariechen : the binding of the book is not beautiful , but the book itself is not a bad book . "
36771	36779	36781	36781	Wäli	37	" I do n't plead for myself , "
36783	36825	36826	36826	Marie	39	" If you do n't love me , that is the end of the matter . But if you do love me , Mariechen , and will marry me , you wo n't be unhappy . Now I have said all . "
36839	36850	36851	36851	she	39	" You have been a long time in telling me , "
36856	36873	36851	36851	she	39	" Why did n't you tell me three months ago ? It 's too late now . "
36874	36879	36881	36883	the little postman	1453	" Oh , Mariechen ! "
36894	36920	36881	36883	the little postman	1453	" you love some one else — you are already betrothed ? And now it 's too late , and you love some one else ! "
36921	36931	36932	36932	Marie	39	" I never said I loved some one else , "
36935	36988	36932	36932	Marie	39	" I only said it was too late . Why , it must be nearly five o'clock , and my lamps are not yet ready . I have n't a moment to spare . Dear me , and there is no oil in the can ; no , not one little drop ! "
36995	37007	36989	36990	The devil	778	" exclaimed Wäli , snatching the can out of her hands . "
37062	37063	37048	37048	you	39	" "
37070	37082	37065	37065	I	0	" she said , in a most melancholy tone of voice ; "
37110	37123	37101	37101	I	0	" Wäli 's heart sank , the tears came into his eyes . "
37136	37141	37143	37143	Fritz	57	" continued the torturer , "
37151	37188	37143	37143	Fritz	57	" A few minutes afterwards , the Disagreeable Man , having failed to attract any notice by ringing , descended to Marie 's pantry , to fetch his lamp . He discovered Wäli embracing his betrothed . "
37195	37213	37189	37189	I	0	" he said grimly , and he retreated at once . But directly afterwards he came back . "
37221	37834	37214	37215	The matron	504	" he said . And he hurried away . MANY of the guests in the foreign quarter had made a start downwards into the plains ; and the Kurhaus itself , though still well filled with visitors , was every week losing some of its invalids . A few of the tables looked desolate , and some were not occupied at all , the lingerers having chosen , now that their party was broken up , to seek the refuge of another table . So that many stragglers found their way to the English dining - board , each bringing with him his own national bad manners , and causing much annoyance to the Disagreeable Man , who was a true John Bull in his contempt of all foreigners . The English table was , so he said , like England herself : the haven of other nation 's offscourings . There were several other signs , too , that the season was far advanced . The food had fallen off in quality and quantity . The invalids , some of them better and some of them worse , had become impatient . And plans were being discussed , where formerly temperatures and coughs and general symptoms were the usual subjects of conversation ! The caretakers , too , were in a state of agitation ; some few keenly anxious to be of to new pastures ; and others , who had perhaps formed attachments , an occurrence not unusual in Petershof , were wishing to hold back time with both hands , and were therefore delighted that the weather , which had not yet broken up , gave no legitimate excuse for immediate departure . Pretty Fräulein Müller had gone , leaving her Spanish gentleman quite disconsolate for the time being . The French Marchioness had returned to the Parisian circles where she was celebrated for all the domestic virtues , from which she had been taking such a prolonged holiday in Petershof . The little French danseuse and her poodle had left for Monte Carlo . M. Lichinsky and his mother passed on to the Tyrol , where Madame would no doubt have plenty of opportunities for quarrelling : or not finding them , would certainly make them without any delay , by this means keeping herself in good spirits and her son in bad health . There were some , too , who had hurried off without paying their doctors : being of course those who had received the greatest attention , and who had expressed the greatest gratitude in their time of trouble , but who were of opinion that thankfulness could very well take the place of francs : an opinion not entirely shared by the doctors themselves . The Swedish professor had betaken himself off , with his chessmen and his chessboard . The little Polish governess who clutched so eagerly at her paltry winnings , caressing those centimes with the same fondness and fever that a greater gambler grasps his thousands of francs , she , had left too ; and , indeed , most of Bernardine 's acquaintances had gone their several ways , after six months ' constant intercourse , and companionship , saying good - bye with the same indifference as though they were saying good - morning or good - afternoon . This cold - heartedness struck Bernardine more than once , and she spoke of it to Robert Allitsen . It was the day before her own departure , and she had gone down with him to the restaurant , and sat sipping her coffee , and making her complaint . "
37852	37856	37846	37846	I	0	" she said . "
37865	37887	37888	37888	You	0	" he replied , pouring out some more coffee for himself , and as an after thought , for her too . "
38088	38089	38091	38091	you	788	" "
38093	38097	38091	38091	you	788	" she asked , "
38104	38105	38098	38098	you	788	" "
38109	38114	38098	38098	you	788	" he said decidedly . "
38123	38127	38115	38115	You	788	" she said . "
38137	38141	38115	38115	You	788	" he answered . "
38200	38201	38202	38202	I	0	" "
38208	38213	38202	38202	I	0	" she said gently . "
38230	38231	38223	38223	I	0	" "
38246	38263	38223	38223	I	0	" he said , smiling sadly . They left the restaurant , and sauntered out together . "
38273	38277	38268	38268	you	0	" he said . "
38283	38287	38278	38278	I	0	" Bernardine said . "
38296	38300	38301	38301	I	0	" he remarked . "
38345	38346	38348	38348	you	788	" "
38373	38377	38348	38348	you	788	" she asked . "
38386	38495	38496	38496	I	0	" he answered , in his old gruff way . She thought of his words when she was packing : the many pleasant hours were to count for nothing ; for nothing the little bits of fun , the little displays of temper and vexation , the snatches of serious talk , the contradictions , and all the petty details of six months ' close companionship . He was not different from the others who had parted from her so lightly . No wonder , then , that he could sympathise with them . That last night at Petershof , Bernardine hardened her heart against the Disagreeable Man . "
38506	38512	38496	38496	I	0	" she said to herself . "
38522	38590	38591	38591	I	0	" Then the vision of a forlorn figure rose before her . And the little hard heart softened at once . In the morning they breakfasted together as usual . There was scarcely any conversation between them . He asked for her address , and she told him that she was going back to her uncle who kept the second - hand book- shop in Stone Street . "
38603	38607	38591	38591	I	0	" he explained . "
38623	38624	38625	38625	I	0	" "
38635	38703	38625	38625	I	0	" she said . Then it suddenly flashed across her mind what he had told her about his one great sacrifice for his mother 's sake . She looked up at him , and he met her glance without flinching . He said good - bye to her at the foot of the staircase . It was the first time she had ever shaken hands with him . "
38708	38713	38625	38625	I	0	" he said gently . "
38719	38720	38625	38625	I	0	" "
38725	38857	38625	38625	I	0	" she answered . He went up the stairs , and turned round as though he wished to say something more . But he changed his mind , and kept his own counsel . An hour later Bernardine left Petershof . Only the concierge of the Kurhaus saw her off at the station . TWO days after Bernardine had left Petershof , the snows began to melt . Nothing could be drearier than that process : nothing more desolate than the outlook . The Disagreeable Man sat in his bedroom trying to read Carpenter 's Anatomy . It failed to hold him . Then he looked out of the window , and listened to the dripping of the icicles . At last he took a pen , and wrote as follows : "
38864	38865	38858	38859	LITTLE COMRADE	92	" "
38993	39112	39113	39113	You	799	" It did not seem possible that such a time could come . Many cruel things have happened to me , as to scores of others , but this is the most cruel of all . Against my wish and against my knowledge , you have crept into my life as a necessity , and now I have to give you up . You are better , God bless you , and you go back to a fuller life , and to carry on your work , and to put to account those talents which no one realises more than I do ; and as for myself , God help me , I am left to wither away . "
39353	39831	39833	39833	you	810	" When I think of it all now , I am not sorry that I let myself go . At least I have learnt what I knew nothing of before : now I understand what people mean when they say that love adds a dignity to life which nothing else can give . That dignity is mine now , nothing can take it from me ; it is my own . You are my very own ; I love everything about you . From the beginning I recognized that you were clever and capable . Though I often made fun of what you said , that was simply a way I had ; and when I saw you did not mind , I continued in that way , hoping always to vex you ; your good temper provoked me , because I knew that you made allowances for me being a Petershof invalid . You would never have suffered a strong man to criticize you as I did ; you would have flown at him , for you are a feverish little child : not a quiet woolly lamb . At first I was wild that you should make allowances for me . And then I gave in , as weak men are obliged . When you came , I saw that your troubles and sufferings would make you bitter . Do you know who helped to cure you ? It was I. I have seen that often before . That is the one little bit of good I have done in the world : I have helped to cure cynicism . You were shocked at the things I said , and you were saved . I did not save you intentionally , so I am not posing as a philanthropist . I merely mention that you came here hard , and you went back tender . That was partly because you have lived in the City of Suffering . Some people live there and learn nothing . But you would learn to feel only too much . I wish that your capacity for feeling were less ; but then you would not be yourself , your present self I mean , for you have changed even since I have known you . Every week you seemed to become more gentle . You thought me rough and gruff at parting , little comrade : I meant to be so . If you had only known , there was a whole world of tenderness for you in my heart . I could not trust myself to be tender to you ; you would have guessed my secret . And I wanted you to go away undisturbed . You do not feel things lightly , and it was best for you that you should harden your heart against me . "
39998	40063	39991	39991	I	0	" I have never seen any of your work , but I think you have now something to say to others , and that you will say it well . And if you have the courage to be simple when it comes to the point , you will succeed . And I believe you will have the courage , I believe everything of you . "
40138	40383	40133	40133	you	654	" Do you remember how those peasants at the Gasthaus thought we were betrothed ? I thought that might annoy you ; and though I was relieved at the time , still , later on , I wished you had been annoyed . That would have shown that you were not indifferent . From that time my love for you grew apace . You must not mind me telling you so often ; I must go on telling you . Just think , dear , this is the first love - letter I have ever written : and every word of love is a whole world of love . I shall never call my life a failure now . I may have failed in everything else , but not in loving . Oh , little one , it ca n't be that I am not to be with you , and not to have you for my own ! And yet how can that be ? It is not I who may hold you in my arms . Some strong man must love and wrap you round with tenderness and softness . You little independent child , in spite of all your wonderful views and theories , you will soon be glad to lean on some one for comfort and sympathy . And then perhaps that troubled little spirit of yours may find its rest . Would to God I were that strong man ! "
40468	40531	40532	40532	You	819	" There is one thing I want you to know : indeed I am not the gruff fellow I have so often seemed . Do believe that . Do you remember how I told you that I dreamed of losing you ? And now the dream has come true . I am always looking for you , and can not find you . "
40571	40634	40635	40637	The Disagreeable Man	102	" But I do love you , no one can take that from me : it is my own dignity , the crown of my life . Such a poor life . . . no , no , I wo n't say that now . I can not pity myself now . . . no , I can not . . . . "
40767	40772	40773	40773	Customers	830	" History of Rome . "
40857	40863	40854	40854	people	946	" He will miss her . "
40909	40926	40906	40906	people	946	" He will be sorry . He is fond of her in his own queer way . "
41011	41016	41004	41004	Bernardine	31	" History repeats itself . "
41064	41070	41071	41071	he	272	" When that is done , "
41075	41081	41071	41071	he	272	" I can find more . "
41090	41096	41087	41087	people	946	" He will be lonely . "
41115	41121	41106	41106	They	946	" I always have Gibbon . "
41131	41137	41128	41128	they	946	" He will be glad . "
41168	41175	41176	41176	she	31	" I shall dust the books , "
41179	41189	41190	41190	he	272	" Ah , I dare say they want it , "
41193	41203	41204	41204	she	31	" I shall get a little teaching to do , "
41207	41216	41204	41204	she	31	" And I shall take care of you . "
41217	41220	41221	41221	he	272	" Ah , "
41403	41411	41412	41412	she	31	" I will work up the business , "
41717	41722	41723	41723	they	846	" You have changed , "
41728	41742	41723	41723	they	846	" but then of course you have been ill , have n't you ? "
41886	41891	41892	41892	they	849	" She has learnt , "
42121	42132	42133	42133	he	272	" She never used to take any interest in them , "
42138	42146	42133	42133	he	272	" I wonder why she does now ? "
42235	42244	42245	42245	he	33	" You have forgotten to feed the sparrows , "
42248	42255	42245	42245	he	33	" They must be quite hungry . "
42286	42295	42296	42296	he	33	" It is a comfort to have you , "
42311	42324	42325	42325	she	31	" I wish I had been more to you all these years , "
42427	42440	42441	42441	Bernardine	31	" If we could only find some subject which we both liked , "
42446	42453	42441	42441	Bernardine	31	" That might knit us together . "
42568	42572	42573	42573	he	33	" Next year , "
42577	42594	42573	42573	he	33	" we must subscribe to the fund , even if we have to sell a book . "
42700	42714	42715	42715	he	272	" I do n't remember what you like , but will this do ? "
42819	42856	42812	42812	His	272	" But I know how to wait : if I have not learnt anything else , I have learnt how to wait . And some day I shall be free . And then . . . . "
43064	43073	43074	43074	she	31	" I will try to begin my book , "
43079	43095	43074	43074	she	31	" If I can only get interested in it , I shall forget my anxiety ! "
43306	43311	43313	43313	Success	96	" I am Success , "
43338	43341	43342	43342	he	888	" Ah , "
43345	43533	43342	43342	he	888	" do not be too confident . Very often things go by opposites in this land . What you call Success , we often call Failure ; what you call Failure , we call Success . Do you see those two men waiting there ? The one nearer to us was thought to be a good man in your world ; the other was generally accounted bad . But here we call the bad man good , and the good man bad . That seems strange to you . Well then , look yonder . You considered that statesman to be sincere ; but we say he was insincere . We chose as our poet - laureate a man at whom your world scoffed . Ay , and those flowers yonder : for us they have a fragrant charm ; we love to see them near us . But you do not even take the trouble to pluck them from the hedges where they grow in rich profusion . So , you see , what we value as a treasure , you do not value at all . "
43540	43545	43546	43546	he	889	" And your name ? "
43558	43563	43564	43564	she	95	" I am Failure , "
43575	43582	43583	43583	he	889	" Come , now , Success , "
43588	43599	43583	43583	he	889	" let me lead you into the Presence - Chamber . "
43661	43667	43668	43668	she	95	" But what of her , "
43679	43685	43668	43668	she	95	" must she be left ? "
43686	43691	43692	43694	the old man	272	" She will learn , "
43697	43712	43692	43694	the old man	272	" She is learning already . Come , now : we must not linger . "
43731	43772	43727	43728	the Sovereign	893	" The world needs you , dear and honoured worker . You know your real name : do not heed what the world may call you . Go back and work , but take with you this time unconquerable hope . "
43879	43883	43884	43884	she	31	" Uncle Zerviah , "
43888	43920	43884	43884	she	31	" you have lived through a long life , and must have passed through many different experiences . Was there ever a time when you cared for people rather than books ? "
43921	43924	43925	43925	he	33	" Yes , "
43942	43948	43949	43949	she	31	" Tell me about it , "
43952	43958	43959	43959	he	33	" It was long ago , "
43964	43979	43959	43959	he	33	" long before I married Malvina . And she died . That was all . "
43980	43985	43987	43987	Bernardine	31	" That was all , "
44001	44015	43995	43995	she	31	" And you have loved , Uncle Zerviah ? And you were loved ? "
44016	44021	44022	44022	he	33	" Yes , indeed , "
44027	44045	44022	44022	he	33	" Then you would not laugh at me if I were to unburden my heart to you ? "
44172	44177	44178	44178	he	28	" You little thing , "
44181	44199	44178	44178	he	28	" I have come to see you . It is eight years since I was in England . "
44206	44216	44217	44217	she	31	" And you ought not to be here now , "
44239	44249	44250	44250	he	33	" I am free to do what I choose , "
44253	44259	44250	44250	he	33	" My mother is dead . "
44260	44264	44265	44265	Bernardine	31	" I know , "
44269	44276	44265	44265	Bernardine	31	" But you are not free . "
44290	44295	44296	44296	he	33	" You look tired , "
44299	44306	44296	44296	he	33	" What have you been doing ? "
44307	44315	44316	44316	she	31	" I have been dusting the books , "
44323	44360	44316	44316	she	31	" You remember you told me I should be content to do that . The very oldest and shabbiest have had my tenderest care . I found the shop in disorder . You see it now . "
44361	44371	44372	44372	he	33	" I should not call it particularly tidy now , "
44376	44393	44372	44372	he	33	" Still , I suppose you have done your best . Well , and what else ? "
44394	44407	44408	44408	she	31	" I have been trying to take care of my old uncle , "
44411	44467	44408	44408	she	31	" We are just beginning to understand each other a little . And he is beginning to feel glad to have me . When I first discovered that , the days became easier to me . It makes us into dignified persons when we find out that there is a place for us to fill . "
44468	44476	44477	44477	he	33	" Some people never find it out , "
44480	44497	44498	44498	she	31	" Probably , like myself , they went on for a long time , without caring , "
44501	44513	44498	44498	she	31	" I think I have had more luck than I deserve . "
44514	44517	44519	44521	the Disagreeable Man	102	" Well , "
44523	44535	44519	44521	the Disagreeable Man	102	" And you are glad to take up your life again ? "
44536	44539	44540	44540	she	31	" No , "
44544	44606	44540	44540	she	31	" I have not got as far as that yet . But I believe that after some little time I may be glad . I hope so , I am working for that . Sometimes I begin to have a keen interest in everything . I wake up with an enthusiasm . After about two hours I have lost it again . "
44607	44612	44613	44613	he	33	" Poor little child , "
44617	44660	44613	44613	he	33	" I , too know what that is . But you will get back to gladness : not the same kind of satisfaction as before ; but some other satisfaction , that compensation which is said to be included in the scheme . "
44661	44669	44670	44670	she	31	" And I have begun my book , "
44694	44695	44670	44670	she	31	" "
44706	44714	44715	44715	I	0	" he said , scanning her curiously . "
44723	44728	44721	44721	myself	0	" Bernardine , said . "
44754	44755	44756	44756	I	0	" "
44770	44774	44759	44759	you	31	" he remarked . "
44782	44783	44759	44759	you	31	" "
44788	44792	44785	44785	you	0	" she said . "
44806	44807	44799	44799	you	0	" "
44817	44821	44799	44799	you	0	" he said . "
44829	44830	44824	44824	I	0	" "
44843	44847	44836	44836	you	0	" she said . "
44857	44861	44848	44848	I	0	" he said . "
44872	44882	44863	44863	you	0	" she said deliberately . He looked up quickly . "
44886	44890	44891	44891	my	0	" he cried , "
44906	44932	44899	44899	you	98	" She had been leaning against the counter , and now she raised herself , and stood erect , a proud , dignified little figure . "
44939	44949	44950	44950	I	0	" she said simply , and with true earnestness . "
45025	45032	45054	45054	I	0	" He still did not speak . "
45044	45048	45049	45049	I	0	" she continued . "
45072	45083	45063	45063	I	0	" Her voice trembled , but she went on bravely : "
45093	45097	45098	45098	You	907	" she said . "
45125	45231	45115	45117	the Disagreeable Man	102	" He still did not speak . Was it that he could not trust himself to words ? But in that brief time , the thoughts which passed through his mind were such as to overwhelm him . A picture rose up before him : a picture of a man and woman leading their lives together , each happy in the other 's love ; not a love born of fancy , but a love based on comradeship and true understanding of the soul . The picture faded , and the Disagreeable Man raised his eyes and looked at the little figure standing near him . "
45238	45243	45235	45236	little child	917	" he said wearily , "
45258	45273	45250	45250	I	0	" Then he bent over the counter , and put his hand on hers . "
45284	45288	45274	45274	I	0	" he said . "
45304	45399	45297	45297	I	0	" The next moment he was gone . In the afternoon of that same day Bernardine went to the City . She was not unhappy : she had been making plans for herself . She would work hard , and fill her life as full as possible . There should be no room for unhealthy thought . She would go and spend her holidays in Petershof . There would be pleasure in that for him and for her . She would tell him so to - morrow . She knew he would be glad . "
45403	45409	45297	45297	I	0	" she said to herself , "
45425	45488	45489	45489	You	921	" That was what she was thinking of at four in the afternoon : how she could best cultivate her garden . At five she was lying unconscious in the accident - ward of the New Hospital : she had been knocked down by a waggon , and terribly injured . She will not recover , the Doctor said to the nurse . "
45500	45522	45524	45526	the Disagreeable Man	102	" At six she regained consciousness , and opened her eyes . The nurse bent over her . Then she whispered : "
45555	45607	45609	45611	the Disagreeable Man	28	" The brown eyes looked at the nurse so entreatingly . It was a long time before she could forget the pathos of those brown eyes . A few minutes later , she made another sign as though she wished to speak . Nurse Katharine bent nearer . Then she whispered : "
45635	45674	45675	45675	I	0	" Bernardine died . ROBERT ALLITSEN came to the old book - shop to see Zerviah Holme before returning to the mountains . He found him reading Gibbon . These two men had stood by Bernardine 's grave . "
45682	45688	45675	45675	I	0	" the old man said . "
45695	45701	45693	45693	her	929	" the young man said . "
45718	45719	45693	45693	her	929	" "
45724	45728	45729	45729	She	929	" Zerviah said . "
45741	45783	45729	45729	She	929	" Then , with a tenderness which was almost foreign to him , Zerviah told Robert Allitsen how Bernardine had opened her heart to him . She had never loved any one before : but she had loved the Disagreeable Man . "
45796	45801	45790	45790	I	0	" she had said . "
45808	45815	45802	45802	I	0	" Those were her very words . "
45819	45825	45802	45802	I	0	" said the Disagreeable Man . "
45834	45839	45829	45829	you	0	" Then he added : "
45863	45871	45855	45855	her	0	" Zerviah placed them in his hand . "
45876	45883	45855	45855	her	0	" the old man said kindly . "
45891	45963	45884	45884	I	0	" The picture of the little thin eager face was folded up with the papers . The two men parted . Zerviah Holme went back to his Roman History . The Disagreeable Man went back to the mountains : to live his life out there , and to build his bridge , as we all do , whether consciously or unconsciously . If it breaks down , we build it again . "
