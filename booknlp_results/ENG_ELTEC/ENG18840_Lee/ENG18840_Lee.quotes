1170	1195	1196	1196	She	528	“ Dear Mr Hamlin , I must kiss the hands that have opened the paradise of body and soul to so many of us . ”
1265	1269	1270	1270	Perry	146	“ You see , ”
1274	1309	1310	1310	Perry	146	“ I must paint things — well — not the sort of things I exactly admire,—because , you see , there ’s Mrs Perry and the children — five girls,—and last year ’s baby . ”
1836	1860	1867	1867	Hamlin	145	“ I am gone to sketch at the Lake of Massaciuccoli ; sha n’t be back till lunch ; please look after Hamlin . ”
1861	1865	1867	1867	Hamlin	145	“ Confound it ! ”
1869	1884	1867	1867	Hamlin	145	“ am I to be left in tête‐à‐tête with Mrs Perry all the morning ? ”
2077	2084	2086	2086	Hamlin	145	“ This looks more like it , ”
2413	2419	2421	2421	Hamlin	145	“ I beg your pardon , ”
2501	2507	2509	2509	Hamlin	145	“ I beg your pardon , ”
2512	2525	2509	2509	Hamlin	145	“ but can you tell me how I may get some breakfast ? ”
2549	2555	2557	2558	the children	3862	“ It ’s Mr Hamlin , ”
2607	2619	2620	2620	She	586	“ I do n’t know anything about your breakfast , sir . ”
2639	2677	2620	2620	She	586	“ Mr Perry went to sketch at Massaciuccoli early this morning , and took the boy with him ; Mrs Perry may never be disturbed till nine ; and the cook is gone to Lucca for provisions . ”
2678	2684	2686	2686	Hamlin	145	“ That ’s very sad , ”
2719	2730	2731	2731	she	586	“ I suppose the cook has orders about your breakfast , ”
2756	2777	2748	2748	she	586	“ Mrs Perry did not think you would want anything so early ; the cook will be back about nine . ”
2814	2818	2819	2819	he	145	“ Nine o’clock ! ”
2822	2850	2819	2819	he	145	“ that ’s a long time to wait . Could n’t you give me something to eat ? I saw a table spread in the next room . ”
2866	2876	2877	2877	she	583	“ It ’s the children ’s breakfast , sir , ”
2880	2888	2877	2877	she	583	“ we have neither tea nor coffee . ”
2889	2894	2896	2901	the eldest of the little girls	589	“ We have milk , ”
2904	2908	2896	2901	the eldest of the little girls	589	“ and figs . ”
2909	2914	2916	2916	Hamlin	145	“ Milk and figs ! ”
2918	2934	2935	2935	he	145	“ why , that ’s a breakfast for the gods ! and wo n’t you , ”
2939	2949	2935	2935	he	145	appealingly—“won’t you share a little of it with me ? ”
2950	2958	2960	2961	the girl	583	“ You are Mrs Perry ’s guest , ”
2967	2979	2960	2961	the girl	583	“ and of course you are welcome to anything you choose . ”
2986	2989	2990	2990	he	145	“ Indeed ! ”
2993	3013	2990	2990	he	145	“ I do n’t wish to do anything against the habits of the house , or disagreeable to you . ”
3014	3022	3023	3023	she	583	“ It is not against any rules , ”
3026	3050	3051	3051	HAMLIN	145	“ If you will excuse me , I will see whether the milk is heated . The children will show you the way . ”
3197	3202	3204	3206	the eldest child	599	“ And you know , ”
3221	3333	3204	3206	the eldest child	599	“ mamma told us you were the great poet , and she read us a poem of yours about Sir Troilus . Mamma always reads poetry to us — and we liked it so much,—and I liked all about where he kisses the lady so much , and her purple dress with the golden roses , and then about Love , where he comes and takes her by the throat , and chokes her , and makes her feel like a furnace . Mamma says it ’s just like love . Mr Thaddeus Smith was in love with the gardener ’s girl when he came here last year , mamma says . ”
3334	3338	3340	3340	Hamlin	145	“ Good heavens ! ”
3342	3350	3340	3340	Hamlin	145	“ what a mamma and what children ! ”
3351	3367	3370	3372	a smaller one	600	“ And mamma told us to get some myrtles and put them in your room , ”
3374	3386	3388	3389	the eldest	601	“ Hush , Winnie ! You know you should n’t tell , ”
3391	3396	3398	3399	the younger	602	“ And you know , ”
3408	3444	3402	3402	her	602	“ mamma said we should put the myrtles , because you made poems about myrtles ; and we were to have had on our best frocks , and met you in the hall , and — ”
3445	3450	3402	3402	her	602	“ Hush , Winnie ! ”
3451	3484	3402	3402	her	602	“ And thrown roses on the floor before you ; only then papa got a telegram saying you were coming by the late train , and we had to go to bed — ”
3564	3573	3575	3575	Hamlin	145	“ May I cut the bread for you ? ”
3584	3597	3598	3598	she	157	“ I do n’t think you will know how to do it , ”
3601	3619	3598	3598	she	157	“ We have only yesterday ’s bread at this hour , until the cook returns from market . ”
3636	3645	3630	3630	she	157	“ Now , children , say your prayer . ”
3737	3745	3747	3747	Winnie	157	“ That ’s mamma ’s Tuesday hymn , ”
3749	3762	3747	3747	Winnie	157	“ she makes a different one for each day of the week . ”
4458	4481	4454	4454	he	145	“ How is it that you speak English so marvellously well ? No one would ever guess that you were not English . ”
4482	4487	4489	4490	the girl	583	“ I am English , ”
4570	4577	4578	4578	he	145	“ You mean English by adoption , ”
4581	4587	4578	4578	he	145	“ surely not by blood ? ”
4588	4615	4616	4616	she	630	“ My mother was an Italian . I think her family came from Sicily or Sardinia , or somewhere , where there are Spaniards and Moors , ”
4619	4631	4616	4616	she	630	“ but my father was Scotch . He came from Aberdeen . ”
4632	4640	4641	4641	he	145	“ Have you ever been in Scotland ? ”
4659	4662	4663	4663	she	630	“ No , ”
4687	4704	4676	4676	she	630	“ I was born in Italy ; my father was employed at Spezia in the docks . ”
4717	4733	4710	4710	her	163	“ Annina ’s father was one of those who make the big men‐of‐war at Spezia . ”
4734	4761	4763	4765	a smaller one	600	“ Oh , you know , we once went with papa , and saw a man‐of‐war , and all the boilers and big , big cannons , ”
4767	4777	4780	4781	the eldest	601	“ And he was a bad , bad man , ”
4785	4832	4780	4781	the eldest	601	“ He used to drink quantities of acquavite ; and one day when he had drunk so much acquavite , do you know what he did ? He tried to throw Annina ’s mother out of the window , and then shot himself with a revolver . ”
4933	4939	4941	4941	Winnie	157	“ And is it true , ”
4943	4998	4941	4941	Winnie	157	“ that you are going to do our picture ? Mamma said you would want to paint us angels or fairies . All the painters paint us , because , mamma says , we are the most beautiful children in Florence . They always give us chocolate and marrons glacés to keep us quiet . ”
5091	5095	5096	5096	he	145	“ Thank you , ”
5099	5108	5096	5096	he	145	“ gardens are n’t much in my line . ”
5127	5134	5135	5135	he	145	“ Yes , by the way , ”
5138	5154	5135	5135	he	145	“ I do take an interest in gardens sometimes . Come and show me yours . ”
5271	5277	5279	5279	Winnie	157	“ This is my garden ! ”
5293	5307	5279	5279	Winnie	157	“ I have marigolds , and sunflowers , and red beans and potatoes . ”
5308	5314	5316	5316	Mildred	165	“ And this is mine , ”
5324	5342	5316	5316	Mildred	165	“ I call it the garden of Acrasia ; because mamma told us once about Sir Guyon — ”
5343	5360	5362	5362	Winnie	157	“ Wo n’t you give us anything to buy seeds with ; we want tomato seeds , ”
5364	5376	5378	5378	Mildred	165	“ Hush , Winnie ! I wonder you ’re not ashamed ! ”
5380	5389	5391	5391	Hamlin	145	“ They are very good sort of gardens , ”
5411	5424	5426	5426	he	145	“ here — I hope your tomatoes may prosper and prove eatable . ”
5432	5436	5437	5437	he	145	“ Come here , ”
5440	5448	5437	5437	he	145	“ I want to speak to you ; ”
5499	5503	5505	5505	Hamlin	145	“ Look here , ”
5509	5559	5505	5505	Hamlin	145	“ I want to know how you would feel if your papa had been in the habit of drinking too much acquavite , and had shot himself after trying to murder your mamma , and some nasty little girl blurted it all out at breakfast to a perfect stranger ? ”
5626	5643	5612	5612	She	660	“ My papa is a gentleman , and Annina ’s papa was a common man — a mascalzone,”—with
5651	5658	5660	5660	Hamlin	145	“ Your papa is a gentleman , ”
5664	5713	5660	5660	Hamlin	145	“ I have known him long before you were born . But remember , if you say cruel things which hurt people ’s feelings , whether they be gentle people or servants , however much your papa may be a gentleman , you wo n’t be a lady . ”
5980	6005	6134	6140	the other voice calmly—“una delle solite bugíe	3950	“ Annina , how dare you distress the signorina Mildred ? How dare you say cruel things to my poor , poor sensitive child ? ”
6006	6017	6134	6140	the other voice calmly—“una delle solite bugíe	3950	“ I have said nothing cruel to the signorina Mildred , ”
6025	6067	6134	6140	the other voice calmly—“una delle solite bugíe	3950	“ the signorina Mildred went to show her garden to Mr Hamlin , and then came back crying . I asked her what had happened , but she refused to tell me . I have nothing to do with her tears . ”
6068	6077	6079	6080	Mrs Perry	146	“ How dare you tell such an untruth ? ”
6082	6120	6079	6080	Mrs Perry	146	“ The signorina Mildred said something about your father at breakfast , and you , like a little viper , turned round upon the poor little darling . She is nearly in hysterics ! You little serpent ! ”
6121	6132	6134	6140	the other voice calmly—“una delle solite bugíe	3950	“ It is one of Miss Mildred ’s usual lies , ”
6137	6142	6134	6140	the other voice calmly—“una delle solite bugíe	3950	calmly—“una delle solite bugíe . ”
6317	6321	6322	6322	he	145	“ You see , ”
6325	6345	6322	6322	he	145	“ Mrs Perry is very delicate — in short , scarcely fit for any kind of household bother,—so that — ”
6346	6349	6351	6351	Hamlin	145	“ Oh , ”
6353	6363	6351	6351	Hamlin	145	“ I had a capital breakfast with your children . ”
6405	6409	6411	6411	Perry	146	“ Of course , ”
6420	6494	6495	6495	he	688	studio—“of course I ’m very happy , and that sort of thing . My wife — well , she ’s a little impetuous , and I do n’t always agree about her way of bringing up the children — but there ’s no saying that she is n’t an immensely superior kind of woman . I do n’t always agree with her , mind you ; but she has the true poetic temperament , and”—here
6499	6600	6495	6495	he	688	effort—“she keeps me up to the mark with my work . I was always a lazy hound , you know , and all that . In short , I know I ’m quite a singularly fortunate man . Nevertheless,—well , I tell you my frank opinion about matrimony : never do it ; the odds are too great . My own belief is , that , especially for an artist , it ’s a fellow ’s ruin . Mine , you see , is an exceptional position . But if you take my advice , old man , never marry . ”
6601	6612	6614	6614	Hamlin	145	“ I do n’t think there is the faintest chance , ”
6616	6650	6614	6614	Hamlin	145	“ Women have got to bore me long ago : all that in my poems is mere recollections of the past — descriptions of a myself which has long come to an end . ”
6651	6658	6660	6660	Perry	146	“ I ’m glad of it , ”
6662	6675	6660	6660	Perry	146	“ It is a foolish thing to get tied to a woman . ”
6676	6680	6682	6682	Hamlin	145	“ Foolish indeed ! ”
6769	6782	6783	6783	he	145	“ That is a very strange‐looking girl you have in your service , ”
6796	6800	6802	6803	Mrs Perry	146	“ The cook ? ”
6805	6822	6802	6803	Mrs Perry	146	“ Is n’t she a divine creature ? I call her Monna Lisa ’s younger sister . ”
6823	6833	6834	6834	he	145	“ I do n’t know your cook by sight , ”
6837	6848	6849	6850	Mrs Perry	146	“ I mean the other young woman they call Annina — ”
6855	6873	6849	6850	Mrs Perry	146	“ The nurse — or governess,—I do n’t know exactly how to describe her,—of your little girls . ”
6874	6880	6882	6883	Mrs Perry	146	“ My children ’s maid , ”
6889	6914	6882	6883	Mrs Perry	146	“ Thank heaven , my children have never had and shall never have any other nurse or any other governess than their own mother . ”
6915	6922	6849	6850	Mrs Perry	146	“ Well , now , Julia , ”
6927	6943	6849	6850	Mrs Perry	146	“ I think , you know , that ’s pushing it a little too far . ”
6944	6955	6957	6958	Mrs Perry	146	“ My children shall never learn anything from a menial , ”
6960	6979	6957	6958	Mrs Perry	146	“ neither to walk bodily , nor morally , nor intellectually , as long as I am alive . ”
6980	6984	6986	6986	Hamlin	145	“ Good heavens ! ”
6988	7000	6986	6986	Hamlin	145	“ what a bandy‐legged family they are likely to turn out ! ”
7001	7008	7010	7010	Perry	146	“ I suppose you mean Annie , ”
7012	7026	7010	7010	Perry	146	“ Yes , she ’s a good girl , and a good‐looking girl . ”
7027	7034	7036	7037	Mrs Perry	146	“ You are mad , Melton , ”
7039	7049	7036	7037	Mrs Perry	146	“ with your idea of goodness and good looks ! ”
7050	7057	7060	7060	Hamlin	145	“ I think her extraordinarily good‐looking , ”
7070	7077	7079	7079	Perry	146	“ I always told you so , ”
7081	7087	7089	7089	Hamlin	145	“ When I say good‐looking , ”
7091	7131	7089	7089	Hamlin	145	“ I do n’t mean it at all in the ordinary sense . There are dozens of Italian girls five times as pretty as that girl , and I daresay most people do n’t think her at all attractive . ”
7132	7135	7138	7139	Mrs Perry	146	“ Yes , ”
7141	7158	7138	7139	Mrs Perry	146	“ vulgar minds and eyes never appreciate the higher beauty . They see only the body . ”
7159	7169	7172	7172	Hamlin	145	“ This is exactly a question of the body , ”
7174	7207	7172	7172	Hamlin	145	“ That girl is one of the most singular types I have ever come across . She is like some of Michaelangelo ’s women , but even stranger — a superb creature . ”
7229	7236	7237	7237	she	146	“ All our servants are handsome , ”
7240	7270	7237	7237	she	146	“ the cook ’s the finest Leonardo da Vinci type — when you see her you will want to do her picture , Mr Hamlin , as Venus Mystica , ”
7304	7308	7312	7312	she	146	“ And the footman ”
7316	7319	7312	7312	she	146	“ Errand‐boy , ”
7333	7392	7312	7312	she	146	“ The footman is quite a type of manly beauty — a young Hercules,—such a neck and shoulders and arms — and a head like a cameo . I always make it a rule to engage only handsome servants , because it spiritualises the minds of our children to be brought up constantly surrounded by beautiful human forms . ”
7393	7397	7399	7399	Hamlin	145	“ I see , ”
7441	7452	7454	7454	Perry	152	“ That girl you noticed has rather a curious history , ”
7456	7459	7454	7454	Perry	152	“ Indeed ! ”
7461	7482	7517	7517	his	152	Hamlin;“she looks as if she ought to have some sort of tragic past — a kind of Brynhilt or Amazon . ”
7483	7501	7503	7503	Perry	152	“ It ’s tragic enough if you like , but it ’s unfortunately not at all poetical , ”
7505	7515	7517	7518	his wife	700	“ There is poetry in all suffering , Melton , ”
7521	7698	7517	7518	his wife	700	“ Well , this girl is the daughter of a Scotch mechanic , a very clever fellow , I believe , who fell in love with the Italian maid of some old friends of ours , and followed her to Italy . He got a very good position in the docks at Spezia , but then the other chaps caballed against him , and made him lose his place . They had to live from hand to mouth for a long while , doing odd jobs for the railway company ; he squandered his money also on inventions , so , little by little , he and his wife and children got into great distress . Then he took to drinking , poor devil ! ( I ’m sure I should have done so long before ;) and one day that he had again been done out of a place by some Italian scoundrel , he tried to throw his wife out of the window , and then shot himself . It was a dreadful business . ”
7699	7709	7711	7712	Mrs Perry	146	“ He was a great republican , poor dear , ”
7714	7732	7711	7712	Mrs Perry	146	“ I ’m a republican too , a socialist — quite a dreadful creature , Mr Hamlin . ”
7733	7742	7744	7744	Hamlin	145	“ What became of the wife and children ? ”
7746	7835	7744	7744	Hamlin	145	“ The children had all died by this time , except Annie ; and the poor wife was quite broken in health . There was a nephew of the husband ’s , a Scotch lad , quite a boy , who was awfully plucky and worked for them for some time . Then the widow died ; and an old friend of ours , old Miss Curzon , the famous singer that had been — perhaps you may have heard of her — took Annie into her house . ”
7836	7841	7843	7844	Mrs Perry	146	“ Darling Miss Curzon ! ”
7846	7886	7843	7844	Mrs Perry	146	“ She was the noblest woman that ever lived . How she loved me ! I always say that I lost my voice — I had a lovely voice before my marriage — when dear darling Miss Curzon died . ”
7887	7896	7899	7899	Perry	146	“ Miss Curzon was an excellent old woman , ”
7901	7927	7899	7899	Perry	146	“ she took Annie when she was eleven , and kept her in her house and educated her till her own death two years ago ; ”
7940	7964	7967	7968	Mrs Perry	146	“ Then I said to my husband , ‘ Perry , this child is a legacy to us from our dearest friend , ’ ”
7972	8006	7967	7968	Mrs Perry	146	“ ‘ we are not rich , but Heaven will send us enough for our children and this child ; and if it do n’t , why , we must do without . ’ ”
8007	8017	7967	7968	Mrs Perry	146	“ So she has been with you ever since ? ”
8018	8021	8023	8023	Perry	146	“ Yes , ”
8027	8056	8023	8023	Perry	146	“ and I should like her to remain for the children ’s sake , only that I feel the girl ought to look out for some better place . ”
8172	8181	8183	8183	Hamlin	145	“ And what is this girl ’s name ? ”
8185	8188	8190	8190	Perry	146	“ Anne , ”
8192	8196	8190	8190	Perry	146	“ Anne Brown . ”
8393	8396	8397	8397	he	145	“ Nonsense ! ”
8398	8411	8371	8371	he	145	cried—“don’t say that ; do n’t leave me in the lurch yet . ”
8412	8416	8418	8418	Hamlin	145	“ You see , ”
8422	8444	8418	8418	Hamlin	145	“ I intend going to America ; and I really think I ought to do a little work before leaving Italy . ”
8445	8451	8371	8371	he	145	“ What sort of work ? ”
8452	8481	8371	8371	he	145	“ Why , I suppose — I think — I ought to take this opportunity of working a little at one of my pictures for the next Grosvenor . ”
8482	8486	8488	8488	Perry	146	“ Which picture ? ”
8492	8514	8521	8521	Perry	146	“ I really scarcely know . I suppose I ought to be making some studies for Circe and the child Comus . ”
8515	8519	8521	8521	Perry	146	“ Child Comus ! ”
8523	8572	8521	8521	Perry	146	“ Why , I ’ve the very thing you want here at hand . Such a Comus for you ! There ’s not a model in all Florence will suit you so well ; it ’s the farmer ’s son . Such legs , and such a chest ! ”
8573	8582	8584	8584	Hamlin	145	“ I do n’t intend doing him naked , ”
8593	8637	8584	8584	Hamlin	145	“ Naked or not , he ’s what you want . The head , since you do n’t care for legs and chest . You shall have him to‐morrow ; and you can work much better here than in that swelter at Florence — ”
8638	8642	8646	8646	Perry	146	“ In short , ”
8648	8735	8646	8646	Perry	146	“ do n’t leave me yet , old fellow . You do n’t know what it is for me to have you here — I feel quite another man . It seems to me as if I were ten years younger . The fact is , do n’t you know , a man ’s never the same when once married ; it ’s a weight round his neck . Do n’t go away yet , dear old Watty , for the sake of auld lang syne . ”
8778	8794	8796	8796	Hamlin	145	“ Well , I ’m willing enough to stay , if you ’ll keep me , ”
8798	8803	8805	8805	Perry	146	“ That ’s right ! ”
8811	8829	8805	8805	Perry	146	“ Keep me from growing into a turnip for a little longer , for goodness ’ sake . ”
9748	9757	9758	9759	The girl	583	olive‐tree—“You must first ask permission of Miss Brown . ”
10098	10112	10113	10113	Hamlin	145	“ Wo n’t you sit down and do it here , Miss Brown ? ”
10396	10407	10408	10408	he	145	“ I may want her for a picture some day , ”
10422	10425	10426	10426	she	146	“ Oh ! ”
10429	10528	10426	10426	she	146	“ paint a picture of her as the Witch of Atlas , with a red cloak and red roses all about her , and a background of cactuses and aloes all twisting and writhing , and looking as if they gibbered . Do paint her like that , dear Mr Hamlin — and Mildred and Winnie will do for attendant spirits . Begin to‐morrow — you shall have her to sit to you all day ; and she has such lovely arms and shoulders , you must paint her in some kind of dress that will show them . ”
10529	10548	10551	10551	Melton	146	“ I think it ’s rather cool of you to promise Annie as a sitter in that way , ”
10552	10561	10426	10426	she	146	Perry—“especially with so few clothes on , Julia . ”
10562	10566	10568	10569	Mrs Perry	146	“ Why not ? ”
10574	10591	10568	10569	Mrs Perry	146	“ If she is beautiful she must be painted . She shall begin sitting to‐morrow morning . ”
10592	10602	10604	10604	Perry	146	“ She sha n’t do anything of the kind ! ”
10608	10643	10604	10604	Perry	146	“ I do n’t see at all what right we have to dispose of her . We pay her wages as a servant for our children , not as a model for our visitors . ”
10644	10659	10661	10661	Hamlin	145	“ I never dreamed of Miss Brown being in any way compelled to sit , ”
10666	10678	10661	10661	Hamlin	145	“ I only wanted your assistance in asking whether she would . ”
10679	10685	10687	10688	Mrs Perry	146	“ Of course she will , ”
10690	10735	10687	10688	Mrs Perry	146	“ Why , I wonder what great hardship there is in sitting for one ’s likeness ? Have n’t I done it hundreds of times ? When a woman is beautiful , it ’s her duty ; that ’s what I was always told . ”
10736	10748	10750	10751	Mr Perry	152	“ It may be the duty of a lady , Julia , ”
10755	10779	10750	10751	Mr Perry	152	“ and it may be yours ; but it is n’t the duty of a servant girl — the difference lies in that . ”
10780	10783	10785	10786	Mrs Perry	146	“ Well , ”
10790	10831	10785	10786	Mrs Perry	146	“ I think you do n’t show much appreciation of the honour of having one of the greatest of living painters in our house , Perry . I do , and I shall see to his having the proper model . ”
10832	10843	10845	10845	Hamlin	145	“ Please , I entreat you , dear Mrs Perry , ”
10847	10881	10845	10845	Hamlin	145	“ do let the matter go — it really is of no consequence ; and , indeed , it would be in the last degree distasteful to me to have an unwilling sitter . ”
10882	10893	10895	10896	Mrs Perry	146	“ You shall have a willing one , Mr Hamlin ; ”
10916	10919	10920	10920	he	779	“ Julia , ”
10923	10942	10920	10920	he	779	“ do leave it to me — I’ll speak to Annie — only do leave it to me . ”
10943	10951	10952	10952	she	700	“ I see no reason for this , ”
10955	10965	10967	10967	Perry	146	“ Then I shall speak to Annie at once , ”
10969	10987	10988	10988	he	779	“ There ’s been far too much of this turning of servants into models in this house , ”
10995	11077	10988	10988	he	779	“ Mrs Perry ca n’t be got to see that it is n’t at all the right sort of thing . I do n’t mind so much with the others , for I suppose they ’re a parcel of sluts ; but Annie is another matter . I do n’t mind it ’s being you , you know , old fellow ; but I object to the principle . Annie ! Annie ! I want to speak to you a moment , ”
11092	11101	11102	11102	he	779	“ I ’ve spoken to her , Hamlin , ”
11105	11309	11102	11102	he	779	“ I told her that she was just what you wanted for the Lady Guenevere or the Lady of the Lake , or some lady or other — all a lie ; but you see I did n’t wish her to know it was merely because she ’s handsome . I told her she was like a portrait of one of these persons . Please do n’t tell her she ’s not . I really expected she ’d refuse ; and I said to her , ‘ Annie , mind you do n’t let the mistress force you into sitting ; do n’t do it to please anybody . ’ I ’m really quite surprised , for she ’s such a very reserved girl always ; but then she is an obliging creature too , and I think she ’ll do more to please me than perhaps my wife , because I always let her understand that this is n’t a good place at all , and that she ought to try for another . Well , she says she ’ll sit ; but not till after the ironing is done in the morning . I proposed half‐past nine — will that do ? ”
11310	11314	11316	11316	Hamlin	145	“ Thank you , ”
11326	11336	11319	11319	his	145	“ you ’re a good old creature , Perry . ”
11443	11449	11450	11450	he	145	“ I have bungled everything , ”
11457	11484	11450	11450	he	145	“ and kept you here for nothing , Miss Brown . The fact is , that you are far more difficult to draw than I expected . ”
11507	11511	11513	11513	Perry	152	“ Try again , ”
11515	11530	11513	11513	Perry	152	“ I daresay Annie will sit for you again — won’t you , Annie ? ”
11531	11542	11544	11545	the girl	583	“ If Mr Hamlin wishes me to sit , certainly , ”
11548	11556	11558	11558	Hamlin	145	“ She is confoundedly difficult to draw , ”
11567	11579	11581	11581	Perry	152	“ She ’s difficult because she ’s a kind of mystery , ”
11583	11693	11581	11581	Perry	152	“ I ’ve felt it ever since we have had her . One thinks there must be something behind that face , and yet it seems to be a mere blank . My belief is , that people of this condition of life often have very little character — at least none in particular developed . Because , after all , it ’s talking and jawing about things which do n’t matter a pin that develops our character . The people who have no opportunity for that remain quite without character , until some day they are forced to choose whether they ’ll be self‐sacrificing creatures or mean pigs . ”
11694	11701	11703	11703	Hamlin	145	“ There ’s something in that , ”
11714	11752	11703	11703	Hamlin	145	“ but it is hard that a man should be unable to copy the shape of a handsome face as he would copy the shape of a handsome vase , without wondering what there may be inside . ”
12043	12047	12048	12048	He	145	“ Anne Brown . ”
12101	12113	12114	12114	he	145	“ I find we have a common friend , Miss Brown , ”
12128	12133	12134	12134	she	583	“ A common friend ? ”
12150	12166	12134	12134	she	583	“ I suppose you mean Mr Perry ; I have n’t many friends now anywhere . ”
12167	12197	12143	12143	her	583	“ Oh ! this is the friend of a great many people — thousands — besides ourselves , so you need not feel jealous ; his name is Dante . ”
12198	12201	12203	12204	Anne Brown	171	“ Indeed ! ”
12218	12233	12234	12234	he	145	“ I found two books belonging to you in the vineyard early this morning , ”
12237	12247	12234	12234	he	145	“ and I put them on the nursery window‐sill . ”
12248	12252	12254	12255	Miss Brown	171	“ Thank you , ”
12262	12269	12258	12258	her	171	“ I missed them last night . ”
12270	12289	12291	12291	Hamlin	145	“ I was indiscreet enough to wonder whether you and I cared for the same things in Dante , ”
12293	12312	12291	12291	Hamlin	145	“ so I ventured to open the book . I found you had marked the passage about Provenzano . ”
12313	12316	12318	12319	Miss Brown	171	“ Yes , ”
12321	12339	12318	12319	Miss Brown	171	“ How is it that you marked Provenzano , and did not mark Ugolino , I wonder ? ”
12340	12353	12258	12258	her	171	“ I do n’t care about Ugolino . He was a traitor . ”
12354	12367	12369	12369	Hamlin	145	“ Do you consider that traitors ought to be starved to death ? ”
12375	12389	12390	12390	she	171	“ I do n’t think any one ought to be starved to death , ”
12395	12434	12390	12390	she	171	“ it is too dreadful . But I do n’t care about Ugolino , because he was a traitor ; and the Archbishop was a traitor too . There is no one to be glad or sorry about . ”
12435	12457	12258	12258	her	171	“ And Francesca da Rimini ? Do you find there is nothing to care for or be sorry about in her ? ”
12474	12481	12482	12482	she	171	“ The husband was quite right , ”
12489	12495	12482	12482	she	171	“ You are very severe , ”
12497	12509	12390	12390	she	171	Hamlin—“much more severe than Dante . He was sorry for them . ”
12510	12516	12517	12517	she	171	“ They were quite happy , ”
12520	12540	12541	12541	she	171	“ They did not mind being killed ; they did not mind being driven about in the wind , of course”—then
12546	12551	12541	12541	she	171	“ Why of course ? ”
12561	12622	12624	12624	she	171	“ Because I do n’t think one would mind , if people cared for one , being driven about in the wind like that . Lots of people have been driven about in revolutions , and put into dungeons together , and so on . If they had put papa in prison , I should have wanted to go in with him,”—for
12744	12751	12753	12753	Hamlin	145	“ That is what I want ! ”
12755	12765	12753	12753	Hamlin	145	“ the Amazon or Valkyr — as I thought . ”
12766	12775	12776	12776	he	145	“ Tell me why you care for Provenzano , ”
12789	12805	12806	12806	she	171	“ Because he was so proud , and did not like to do humble things , ”
12809	12824	12806	12806	she	171	“ and yet he begged in the streets for a ransom for his friend . ”
12898	12908	12909	12909	she	171	“ If Mrs Perry wishes it , of course , ”
12912	12916	12918	12918	Hamlin	145	“ Excuse me , ”
12920	12945	12918	12918	Hamlin	145	“ Mrs Perry ’s consent may be necessary for you ; but for me , the sitting depends upon your wishes , Miss Brown . ”
12946	12956	12957	12957	she	171	“ I do n’t care one way or another , ”
12994	13005	13007	13008	Mrs Perry	146	“ Do let me keep them , dear Mr Hamlin , ”
13010	13020	13007	13008	Mrs Perry	146	“ they are the most precious things I possess . ”
13021	13027	13029	13029	Hamlin	145	“ They are horrible rubbish ; ”
13036	13063	13029	13029	Hamlin	145	“ If you want something of mine , I will make you a sketch of little Winnie — only please do n’t keep these fearful things . ”
13064	13073	13074	13074	she	171	“ Thank you , thank you so much ! ”
13075	13091	13029	13029	Hamlin	145	exclaimed—“but oh , may n’t I keep this ? it is such a lovely head ! ”
13092	13101	13102	13102	he	145	“ It ’s the head of Miss Brown , ”
13106	13139	13140	13140	he	145	“ You do n’t care for it much on her shoulders,—why should you care for it on my paper — an abominable caricature ? Really , I must be permitted to tear it up”—and
13236	13246	13247	13247	he	145	“ What do you want with an Italian grammer ? ”
13250	13264	13247	13247	he	145	“ You surely do n’t require to study it yourself , Miss Brown ? ”
13265	13273	13274	13274	she	171	“ I want to teach some day , ”
13277	13287	13274	13274	she	171	“ Do you mean to teach the Perry children ? ”
13288	13356	13247	13247	he	145	“ Oh no — to teach , to be a daily governess , what we call a parlatrice here . It is not difficult . The lessons are all conversation . Many English ladies want those sort of lessons . I know a girl , the daughter of Mrs Perry ’s dressmaker , who gives ten lessons every day , and and gets two francs a lesson . ”
13357	13380	13247	13247	he	145	“ Ten lessons a‐day ! But that ’s fearful . What awful slavery ! Surely you do n’t want to do that ? ”
13381	13393	13274	13274	she	171	“ I wish I could . I should be so happy . ”
13394	13403	13247	13247	he	145	“ Then you want to leave the Perrys ? ”
13404	13414	13247	13247	he	145	“ I want to give up being a servant . ”
13435	13443	13444	13444	he	145	“ You do n’t care for children ? ”
13449	13463	13464	13464	she	800	“ I do n’t know . I do n’t care for these children , ”
13468	13476	13464	13464	she	800	“ I thought women always liked children . ”
13481	13484	13485	13485	she	800	“ Oh , ”
13488	13520	13485	13485	she	800	“ children are worse sometimes than grown people ; and then one ca n’t resent it , or answer bad words , or strike them , just because they are children . ”
13521	13534	13608	13608	Hamlin	145	“ Then you think you would prefer being a teacher of Italian ? ”
13535	13569	13608	13608	Hamlin	145	“ Oh yes , I must become that some day ; I study when I have a little time . A teacher talks with ladies , and talks about all sorts of things . ”
13570	13582	13485	13485	she	800	“ How do you mean — about all sorts of things ? ”
13583	13607	13608	13608	Hamlin	145	“ About things — which are not things to eat , or mend , or clean,—about books , and places , and people . ”
13614	13622	13623	13623	he	145	“ Is that such a rare pleasure ? ”
13652	13669	13671	13672	the girl	583	“ Miss Curzon used to talk about books to me — and about music , sometimes , ”
13674	13690	13671	13672	the girl	583	“ She made me read Shakespeare with her . That is long , long ago . ”
13691	13704	13671	13672	the girl	583	“ And since then . Do you never talk about such things ? ”
13705	13708	13671	13672	the girl	583	“ Never . ”
13709	13712	13671	13672	the girl	583	“ Never ? ”
13720	13729	13716	13716	her	171	“ Never , except with you , sir . ”
13747	13761	13762	13762	he	145	“ Have you ever read the ‘ Vita Nuova , ’ Miss Brown ? ”
13765	13774	13762	13762	he	145	“ What ’s the ‘ Vita Nuova ’ ? ”
13775	13813	13814	13814	She	583	“ It is a little book by Dante , in prose and verse , telling how he met Beatrice , and then how she died . It is much more beautiful than the ‘ Divina Commedia . ’ ”
13818	13859	13814	13814	She	583	“ Is it more beautiful than Bertran del Bornio , where he carried his head like a lantern ? Or Bocca degli Abati , where they all change into snakes ? Or Cacciaguida when he prophesies about Dante ’s exile ? ”
13860	13874	13762	13762	he	145	“ It is quite different — all about beautiful things , and love . ”
13875	13883	13762	13762	he	145	“ I do n’t care for that . ”
13884	13894	13895	13896	Miss Brown	171	“ You must read it some day , though . ”
13908	13917	13919	13919	Perry	146	“ I say , Hamlin , old fellow , ”
13933	13987	13919	13919	Perry	146	“ do you care to see the festival at Lucca to‐morrow ? I ’m going to take the children in for a treat , and I shall take Annie too — for she never gets any amusement , poor girl . I ’ve hired a waggonette — will you be of the party ? ”
13988	14008	13762	13762	he	145	“ Will you let me think about it , Perry ? I do n’t much go in for festivals . ”
14009	14020	13919	13919	Perry	146	“ This is a picturesque affair — really worth seeing . ”
14021	14026	14028	14028	Hamlin	145	“ By the way , ”
14030	14058	14028	14028	Hamlin	145	“ I have nearly finished my sketch of Miss Brown , and I should like — I suppose I ought — to make her some little present . ”
14059	14064	14066	14067	Melton Perry	146	“ I would n’t , ”
14070	14134	14066	14067	Melton Perry	146	“ she ’s an odd girl , and you might just hurt her feelings . You see her father was a republican , and that sort of thing , so she ’s got all sorts of notions about equality and so forth . Awful bosh , of course , but still I think it ’s as well she should have them as not . ”
14135	14143	14145	14145	Hamlin	145	“ I did n’t mean any money , ”
14156	14189	14190	14190	Hamlin	145	“ Then , if you will run the risk , give her some school‐books . You know she wants to set up as a teacher . Grammars — that sort of thing . ”
14197	14203	14190	14190	Hamlin	145	“ Horrible!—to give her grammars ! ”
14204	14211	14190	14190	Hamlin	145	“ It ’s what she wants . ”
14212	14233	14190	14190	Hamlin	145	“ Why , it would seem — well — it would be like encouraging her to become a daily governess . ”
14234	14244	14245	14245	Hamlin	145	“ That ’s just what I wish to do . ”
14871	14874	14849	14855	the crowd of vehicles of all sorts	830	“ Libertas , ”
16061	16068	16070	16070	Perry	146	“ What ! here after all ! ”
16072	16082	16070	16070	Perry	146	“ Up to some mischief , you cunning dog ! ”
16083	16096	16098	16098	Hamlin	145	“ Up to the mischief of watching these good people ’s devotion , ”
16100	16106	16108	16109	the children	3862	“ Why did you come ? ”
16112	16127	16129	16129	Hamlin	145	“ I suppose because I thought I should like to amuse myself after all , ”
16266	16271	16273	16275	the little ones	901	“ Buy us something , ”

25469	25476	25478	25479	Mrs Perry	146	“ May shall not have fever , ”
25483	25496	25478	25479	Mrs Perry	146	“ and Hamlin ’s masterpiece , which you choose to sneer at — ”
25497	25509	25511	25511	Hamlin	145	“ Oh , please , do n’t bother about my masterpieces ! ”
25513	25546	25511	25511	Hamlin	145	“ — Shall not be sacrificed . You shall take the children to the sea‐side , Melton ; and Annie shall continue to give him as many sittings as he may wish . ”
25583	25588	25589	25589	he	693	“ Damn your sea‐side ! ”
25594	25597	25599	25600	Mrs Perry	146	“ Melton ! ”
25608	25613	25615	25615	Perry	146	“ Damn your sea‐side ! ”
25617	25686	25615	25615	Perry	146	“ Have n’t you eyes in your head to understand that the sea‐side has nothing to do with the matter ? The children no more require to go to Viareggio than I require to be made Khan of Tartary . What is required is that an honest girl , who was intrusted to us by an old friend , should not get to be talked of as a — ”
25687	25702	25704	25705	Mrs Perry	146	“ This loathsome coarseness is too much for me . Adieu , Mr Hamlin ! ”
25712	25719	25721	25721	Perry	146	“ Lord deliver us from womankind ! ”
25739	25749	25750	25750	Hamlin	145	“ What a nice breakfast I shall have to‐morrow ! ”
25768	25774	25776	25776	Perry	146	“ Hamlin , old boy , ”
25778	25808	25776	25776	Perry	146	“ do n’t be down upon me . I really am confoundedly sorry to bother you — indeed I am ; but — you see — about this girl — ”
25809	25813	25815	25815	Hamlin	145	“ I understand , ”
25819	25828	25815	25815	Hamlin	145	“ do n’t let ’s talk about it . ”
25829	25844	25846	25846	Perry	146	“ But — please do n’t be in a rage with me , Watty , ”
25850	25889	25846	25846	Perry	146	“ really I do n’t know what to do . You see , it ’s not as if she were an ordinary girl or an ordinary servant ; then I should say — hang it , please yourself ! ”
25890	25894	25896	25896	Hamlin	145	“ Sweet morals ! ”
25898	26097	25896	25896	Hamlin	145	“ But with her it ’s different ; I ’m sure you must recognise that yourself . Now I do n’t mean to say you are in the least to blame , or that the girl cares the least scrap about you ; but still , this sort of thing wo n’t do . I know you ’re the last man to do a dirty thing — indeed you ’re the only man whom I would have permitted to go on so long . But then , quite without meaning anything , all that sitting , and talking , and discussing poetry and ‘ Vita Nuova ’ together — without knowing it , it puts ideas into a girl ’s head , makes her dissatisfied , that sort of thing , and the result is that she goes to the bad . And then , here in Florence especially , a girl ’s none the better looked at for having sat , if even only to one man . People begin to talk ( at the villa it was another matter ) , stories go round , and it becomes difficult for her to get a respectable situation . ”
26098	26106	26108	26108	Hamlin	145	“ You need n’t say any more , ”
26125	26142	26144	26144	Perry	146	“ You understand , old fellow , I do n’t mean it about you in particular , ”
26146	26192	26144	26144	Perry	146	“ indeed you ’ve behaved like Sir Bors , Sir Percival , and Sir Galahad all rolled into one . But it ’s the fatality of the circumstances , the beastly world about us . You ’re not angry , are you , with me ? ”
26193	26198	26200	26200	Hamlin	145	“ Not a bit , ”
26231	26255	26144	26144	Perry	146	“ not a bit , my dear Perry . I suppose you have no objection to Miss Brown giving me one more morning ? ”
26256	26284	26144	26144	Perry	146	“ Not the least — two , or even three , for the matter of that . I was only anxious not to spin out things indefinitely . ”
26285	26295	26297	26297	Hamlin	145	“ One more sitting will be more than enough , ”
26299	26318	26297	26297	Hamlin	145	“ By the way , before I go , I want to do a drawing of little Mildred . ”
26528	26534	26536	26539	Hamlin ’s old housekeeper	1175	“ It is bad weather , ”
26541	26544	26546	26546	Anne	171	“ Horrible , ”
26590	26607	26608	26608	he	145	“ It is very good of you to come in such horrible weather , Miss Brown , ”
26611	26627	26629	26629	she	1176	“ It is the last sitting — I thought I ought not to miss it , ”
26646	26655	26656	26656	he	145	“ Wo n’t you warm yourself a little ? ”
26659	26670	26656	26656	he	145	“ No , thank you ; I am not cold . ”
26678	26688	26689	26689	he	145	“ You are going to Viareggio , Miss Brown , ”
26692	26700	26689	26689	he	145	“ Yes ; I believe I am . ”
26701	26721	26722	26722	he	145	“ You will enjoy the change of air . The sea — you told me you liked the sea one day,”—and
26733	26738	26722	26722	he	145	“ I suppose so . ”
26898	26909	26910	26910	he	145	“ Take that letter to the post‐office at the Uffizi , ”
26918	26926	26910	26910	he	145	“ and mind you get it registered . ”
27015	27036	27012	27012	he	145	“ Do you remember my finding your ‘ Dante ’ in the vineyard at the Villa Arnolfini , Miss Brown ? ”
27037	27040	27041	27041	she	171	“ Yes , ”
27044	27060	27012	27012	he	145	“ And you told me that you wished to fit yourself to be a teacher ? ”
27061	27067	27012	27012	he	145	“ Yes , I remember . ”
27068	27071	27074	27074	Hamlin	145	“ Well , ”
27076	27128	27074	27074	Hamlin	145	“ I have been thinking about that ; and I think it would be a pity — I mean — I hope you wo n’t think it horribly rude of me to say so — I think it would be better if you went to school for a little while yourself . ”
27147	27155	27156	27156	she	171	“ Of course it would be better , ”
27161	27223	27156	27156	she	171	“ of course I shall always be very ignorant ; but I have no wish to set up for what I am not . I am not going to teach people anything — only to correct their pronunciation and a few mistakes . One does not require to study much for that , and I shall be competent to do it . ”
27241	27246	27247	27247	he	145	“ You misunderstand me , ”
27250	27277	27279	27279	he	145	“ and indeed what I have to say is so strange and perhaps so unjustifiable , that you have every right to do so . Listen , ”
27286	27355	27279	27279	he	145	“ Please do not think me very bold , and forgive the horrid way in which I am forced to put things , when I tell you , dear Miss Brown , that I am very much interested in you , and , indeed — will you forgive a comparative stranger saying so?—that I have never felt so much attracted by any one as I do by you . ”
27370	27384	27387	27387	Hamlin	145	“ The time has come when our acquaintance must come to an end , ”
27391	27508	27387	27387	Hamlin	145	“ but I can not let this happen without making an effort to prolong it . I have no brothers or sisters — no one , at least , living with me , except distant relations . I have never taken much interest in anybody . But now I want to know — would you , instead of our parting company altogether — would you let me become your guardian for the next few years , and as such , would you let me take charge of your education and send you to school ? It seems a very ridiculous thing to suggest . But still you must not be angry with me for doing so . ”
27620	27624	27625	27625	he	145	“ Miss Brown , ”
27630	27836	27625	27625	he	145	hand—“Anne — oh , do n’t be unhappy ! I did not mean to offend you . Do n’t you understand my meaning ? I wish you to be what you have a right to be . I wish you to be in such a position that of all the men in the world you may choose the one who deserves you most . Anne , I love you — and I hope that perhaps some day you may love me ; but I want you to be able to love whoever may best deserve you , and merely to do my best that you should care for me . I want you to have a future independent of me — to possess the education and the fortune which shall enable you to marry whomsoever you will , or not to marry at all . Will you let me , for the time being , be your guardian , your father , your brother ; let me provide for you , take care of your money , see to your education ? I do not ask you to love me , but merely to give me a chance of trying to make you prefer me . ”
27911	27920	27921	27921	she	171	“ May I have a glass of water ? ”
27929	27933	27934	27934	she	171	“ never mind , ”
27935	27942	27927	27927	Hamlin	145	said—“never mind — I must go ; ”
27959	27963	27965	27965	Hamlin	145	“ Miss Brown , ”
27967	27975	27977	27977	he	145	“ why do n’t you answer me ? ”
27992	28000	28001	28001	she	171	“ Because you do not deserve it , ”
28010	28017	28001	28001	she	171	“ Let me go , please . ”
28018	28026	28028	28028	Hamlin	145	“ I can not let you go , ”
28036	28130	28028	28028	Hamlin	145	“ until you have listened to me . Will you let me provide for your future , send you to school , and then place you in the care of my aunt ? Will you let me act as if I were your guardian for the next three years , and at the end of them you shall have enough to live and marry as befits a lady , and be as free as air , or become my wife — whichever you shall choose ? Answer me , for I am serious . ”
28135	28145	28146	28146	she	171	“ Do n’t ask me for an answer now , ”
28149	28160	28146	28146	she	171	“ I am not sure that you are in earnest . ”
28161	28169	28171	28171	Hamlin	145	“ I am — indeed I am ! ”
28173	28210	28171	28171	Hamlin	145	“ I have intended asking you this ever since my return to Florence . I returned merely in order to ask you . I am in earnest ; can not you give me a serious answer ? ”
28211	28236	28237	28237	He	145	“ Not now — I ca n’t think about anything ; I must ask ; I do n’t know what is right to do . ”
28962	28977	28978	28978	he	145	“ Have you thought over our conversation in the studio yesterday , Miss Brown ? ”
28981	28984	28991	28991	he	145	“ Yes , ”
29000	29004	28994	28994	his	145	“ I have . ”
29005	29010	29013	29013	Hamlin	145	“ Well , then , ”
29015	29038	29013	29013	Hamlin	145	“ with regard to the plan which I submitted to you , what is your answer ? Do you consent or not ? ”
29045	29049	29050	29050	she	171	“ I consent , ”
29124	29131	29109	29109	she	171	“ this is what I want . ”
29132	29136	29137	29137	he	145	“ Thank you , ”
29192	29198	29200	29200	Perry	146	“ That ’s my vocation , ”
29202	29222	29224	29224	he	145	“ and not painting damned landscape spinach and soapsud seas . Look ! are n’t they jolly old fiends ? ”
29242	29245	29247	29247	Hamlin	145	“ Capital ! ”
29249	29302	29303	29303	Perry	146	“ But look here ; I came to tell you something . I want the address of Miss Brown ’s guardian,—you told me there was one,—because I am going to have Miss Brown educated , with a view , if she do not change her mind , to her becoming my wife . ”
29312	29315	29316	29316	he	145	“ Damnation ! ”
29332	29338	29341	29341	Perry	146	“ So that ’s it ! ”
29343	29368	29341	29341	Perry	146	“ While I was bothering my brains with trying to take care of Anne , you were being inveigled by that cursed hypocritical slut . ”
29369	29385	29387	29387	Hamlin	145	“ I shall be obliged to you to speak in rather different language , Perry , ”
29406	29422	29424	29424	Perry	146	“ Oh , beast ! brute ! seven‐times‐distilled and most‐kickable jackass that I have been , ”
29426	29463	29424	29424	Perry	146	“ that I should have let this happen to you!—that I should have let you be entrapped under my very nose ! But it must n’t be , old fellow ; I wo n’t stand it . ”
29464	29470	29472	29472	Hamlin	145	“ You will have to , ”
29476	29499	29472	29472	Hamlin	145	“ and so , let ’s say no more about it . Only one word : Miss Brown has not inveigled me . ”
29509	29518	29500	29500	Perry	146	“ No woman ever does inveigle a man ! ”
29519	29600	29424	29424	Perry	146	“ Miss Brown has not inveigled me . I conceived the desire of educating her , and giving myself a chance of marrying her if she would have me , long ago , before I returned to Florence . And , as a favour , I beg you will respect Miss Brown so long as she remains in your house , as you would respect the woman who is at present my ward , and may possibly become my wife . ”
29601	29608	29610	29610	Perry	146	“ Ward ! wife ! fiddlesticks ! ”
29612	29718	29610	29610	Perry	146	“ For God ’s sake , my dearest old Watty , do n’t go and do such a damnable thing ! do n’t be such an idiot as to suppose you must do it . That was my confounded folly : let myself be led on , and then thought it was my own choice , my resolution , all sorts of fine things . No man ever really wants to tie himself up ; it ’s the woman who does it , and makes him believe it ’s himself . All this is bosh , mere bosh ; you ’ll think better of it . ”
29719	29791	29424	29424	Perry	146	“ I tell you again , Perry , that there is no inveigling about the matter . I made up my mind to this step while I was away from Florence . Besides , I am not going to marry Miss Brown straight off ; I am going to give her the education which such a woman deserves , to enable her to marry me should she care to do so . ”
29792	29797	29799	29799	Perry	146	“ Education , forsooth ! ”
29801	29839	29799	29799	Perry	146	“ you will get yourself married before you have time to say Jack Robinson : and to think that I have brought it all upon you ! to think that I have driven you to do it ! ”
29851	29891	29840	29840	Hamlin	145	“ Really , you need not feel under any responsibility . I alone am responsible in the business — I and good fortune , which has brought me into the presence of the most marvelIous woman that ever was — ”
29892	29913	29915	29916	poor Perry	146	“ But what do you do it for ? You ’re not in love with Annie , I do believe , ”
29918	29934	29936	29936	Hamlin	145	“ I do it because she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen , ”
29940	29975	29976	29976	Perry	146	“ and the woman who , properly educated , is of all others the one whom I should most wish to love — because , in short , I can not see her wasted . ”
30004	30014	30015	30015	she	146	“ What is the matter ? what has happened ? ”
30044	30055	30057	30057	Perry	146	“ Hamlin wants to bring up and marry Anne Brown , ”
30078	30102	30104	30104	Perry	146	“ Anne Brown — do you hear that ? He wants to marry her ! to educate her ! He has already proposed ! ”
30120	30124	30125	30125	she	146	“ Dear friend , ”
30129	30139	30125	30125	she	146	“ my heart told me that this would be . ”
30140	30143	30145	30145	Perry	146	“ Fudge ! ”
30147	30160	30145	30145	Perry	146	“ if it did , why the deuce did n’t you interfere ? ”
30161	30218	30219	30220	Mrs Perry	146	“ My heart told me this would be . I congratulate you , dearest friend , that you have at last found the embodiment of your mysterious dreams of beauty . And I thank you , on my part , for giving me the happiness of seeing that glorious dethroned goddess reinstated in her rights , and also,”—and

30308	30321	30323	30324	Mrs Perry	146	“ And that will be yourself — your noble , darling self , ”
30326	30337	30339	30339	Hamlin	145	“ I am happy that you approve of my decision , ”
30343	30365	30339	30339	Hamlin	145	“ and since you do , will you kindly tell me the address of Miss Brown’s — Miss Brown ’s guardian ? ”
30366	30373	30375	30375	Perry	146	“ Julia , I forbid you , ”

30473	30484	30471	30471	Perry	146	“ to think that it should all be my fault . ”
30485	30491	30493	30494	Mrs Perry	146	“ Come into my boudoir , ”
30496	30533	30493	30494	Mrs Perry	146	“ you shall write to him without a moment ’s delay . Denrest Mr Hamlin , it is so noble , so lovely on your part ; and dear Anne — how beautiful she will become ! ”

31541	31606	31538	31539	the visitor	1235	“ has given me rather a confused account of the proposal which I understand you to have made to my cousin ; and I thought it wiser to see you before speaking to her . I must therefore beg you to tell me whether Mr Perry ’s account of your proposal is correct , and also whether you are in earnest in making it . ”
31607	31625	31627	31627	Hamlin	145	“ Had you waited for my letter , I think you could have had no further doubts , ”
31633	31708	31627	31627	Hamlin	145	“ To recapitulate , then . I proposed to Miss Brown that she should permit me to take charge of her education for the next two years , and , on her becoming of age and deeming her studies complete , to place at her disposal the capital of an income which should enable her to live in a manner corresponding with the education she had received , and to make a suitable marriage . ”
31722	31730	31731	31731	he	145	“ I am to understand , therefore , ”
31734	31748	31731	31731	he	145	“ that I was misinformed as to this being a proposal of marriage . ”
31749	31753	31755	31755	Hamlin	145	“ Pardon me , ”
31759	31838	31755	31755	Hamlin	145	“ I told your cousin that I hoped that perhaps , at the end of those two years , or more , she might feel inclined to accept me as her husband ; but that my particular object was that Miss Brown should , on coming of age , find herself in possession of a fortune corresponding to her education , and which should leave her free to contract whatever marriage she pleased , or to continue single . ”
31843	31847	31848	31848	he	223	“ In short , ”
31859	31906	31856	31856	his	223	“ you offer to provide my cousin with a competence whereon to live , or get married , after she shall have remained for two years in your charge . I fully appreciate the intention of your proposal ; and I therefore beg to refuse it . ”
31975	31985	31986	31986	he	223	“ I quite understand your refusal , Mr Brown , ”
31989	32028	31986	31986	he	223	“ as a result of your interpretation of the case ; and I suppose I have no right to ask you to see my proposal , except as you would mean it were you to make it yourself . ”
32041	32058	32059	32059	he	223	“ If your intention is to marry my cousin , why not marry her at once ? ”
32120	32125	32126	32126	he	145	“ Because — because , ”
32129	32132	32126	32126	he	145	“ Because , ”
32137	32224	32126	32126	he	145	“ a man in your position of life can not marry a girl like my cousin before she has been turned into a lady ; and because , even if this be granted , he can not bind himself to marry her until he see whether schooling has succeeded in making a lady of her . I perfectly follow your reasons ; but you also can follow mine when I say that my cousin can not be subjected to the ups and downs of your appreciation . ”
32261	32267	32269	32269	Hamlin	145	“ You misunderstand my motives , ”
32274	32346	32348	32348	Hamlin	145	“ My reason for not marrying your cousin at once is , that I would not marry a woman who can not possibly love me as yet ; and my reason against a formal engagement between us is , that I can not consent to bind Miss Brown to marry me when she has no opportunity as yet of choosing a man more to her taste . It seems to me , ”
32357	32437	32348	32348	Hamlin	145	“ that to take your cousin in marriage now , or to bind her to marry me in the future , would be buying her in exchange for the education and the money which she will receive from me . That education and that money are intended to secure her freedom , to secure her choice of a man whom she may love , not to make her into the chattel of a man whom she could only despise . ”
32513	32522	32523	32523	he	145	“ All this is very noble and chivalric , ”
32526	32600	32523	32523	he	145	“ and I doubt not quite natural in a poet like you , Mr Hamlin ; but for us practical people , I fear it wo n’t do . I am fully persuaded of the desirability of giving my cousin some further schooling , and fully persuaded also of the undesirability of leaving her any longer in the care of Mr Perry . So I shall take her back to England with me . ”
32650	32654	32656	32656	Hamlin	145	“ I see , ”
32670	32713	32666	32667	his guest	556	seated—“I see that , in plain words , you suppose that I project settling some money upon your cousin , with a view of making her my mistress for two years — that is it , is it not , Mr Brown ? ”
32776	32790	32767	32767	he	223	“ Yes , sir ; that is exactly the state of the case . ”
32804	32809	32810	32810	he	145	“ In that case , ”
32813	32882	32810	32810	he	145	“ I think I can devise a plan which shall satisfy you — which will relieve your apprehensiveness . I offer not merely to settle upon Miss Brown the capital of five hundred a‐year , to be administered by you until her majority ; but also to give you my word of honour to marry Miss Brown at any time that she may summon me to do so . ”
32908	32915	32916	32916	he	223	“ I do n’t understand you , ”
32919	32933	32916	32916	he	223	“ I do n’t understand what you want to do with my cousin . ”
32934	32947	32949	32949	Hamlin	145	“ It seems difficult to explain it to you , Mr Brown , ”
32951	33052	32949	32949	Hamlin	145	“ still , I may repeat it . I wish Miss Brown to receive all the advantages of education and money which a woman gifted like her has a right to , and which will enable her to freely marry a man worthy of her — myself , or any other in the world . I will not hear of binding Miss Brown to me at present , either by marriage or by promise of marriage ; she is to remain absolutely independent . But I offer once more to pledge myself to marry her whenever she may wish it . ”
33061	33073	33074	33074	he	1265	“ Are you ready to sign a document to that effect ? ”
33077	33086	33088	33088	Hamlin	145	“ I will give Miss Brown my word , ”
33092	33115	33088	33088	Hamlin	145	“ and I will give you , Mr Brown , as many signed documents as may be equivalent thereto in your eyes . ”
33163	33235	33160	33160	he	223	“ On these conditions I can no longer make any opposition ; and it rests with my cousin to accept or refuse your offer . I can only warn her and you — and to do so is my duty , I think — that , in my opinion , such an arrangement is utterly undesirable for both parties , and that my strong advice is not to enter upon it . ”
33236	33244	33246	33246	Hamlin	145	“ I take your warning to heart , ”
33250	33331	33246	33246	Hamlin	145	“ but I can not agree with it . May I beg you to meet me at the English Consulate to‐morrow morning , to witness the document which you proposed I should draw out ; the matter of her money settlement I shall leave in the hands of my lawyers . What hour will suit you ? and may I have the pleasure of receiving you to breakfast with me and Mr Perry , who will doubtless be my witness ? ”
33336	33340	33341	33341	he	223	“ Thank you , ”
33345	33380	33341	33341	he	223	“ I think I should prefer breakfasting at my inn . With regard to the document , I shall be happy to meet you at the Consulate any time convenient to yourself . But , ”
33394	33417	33388	33388	his	223	“ we must first hear whether , on second thoughts , my cousin accepts your proposal . Good afternoon , Mr Hamlin . ”
33418	33422	33424	33424	Hamlin	145	“ Good afternoon , ”
33466	33477	33478	33478	she	146	“ So you have seen our noble , darling Hamlin , ”
33481	33499	33478	33478	she	146	“ and you have felt your heart go out to meet him as we have felt ours . ”
33500	33507	33509	33509	Brown	223	“ I have seen Mr Hamlin , ”
33522	33535	33509	33509	Brown	223	“ and I should like to speak to my cousin , please . ”
33536	33541	33542	33543	Mrs Perry	146	“ Anne — my beautiful Anne”—cried
33553	33557	33558	33558	she	146	“ Poor child ! ”
33561	33573	33574	33574	Anne	171	“ how she has been trembling in her heart all day ! ”
33614	33620	33621	33621	she	146	“ Good afternoon , Richard , ”
33647	33655	33656	33656	she	146	“ Do n’t be unhappy , darling , ”
33661	33692	33656	33656	she	146	“ I know how one woman always longs for another woman in these moments . I will stay with you while your cousin tells you the result of his visit . ”
33693	33703	33705	33705	Brown	171	“ It is very kind of you , madam , ”
33708	33737	33705	33705	Brown	171	“ but I think this matter had better be settled solely between my cousin and myself . Would you permit her to take me into some other room ? ”
33738	33748	33750	33751	Mrs Perry	146	“ Oh , I do n’t wish to intrude , ”
33753	33780	33783	33783	she	146	“ I only wished to support this poor child with my presence . But after all , a woman who loves requires support from no one . ”
33797	33808	33810	33810	Brown	171	“ I have been to Mr Hamlin ’s , Anne , ”
33819	33822	33814	33814	himself	171	“ Well ? ”
33860	33863	33865	33865	Brown	171	“ Well , ”
33890	33930	33875	33875	his	1272	“ I have spoken to Mr Hamlin ; and I find that you were correct in your judgment , and that I was mistaken in mine . He is in earnest in his proposal , and honest in it . ”
33931	33936	33938	33939	Anne Brown	171	“ I knew that ; ”
34056	34061	34062	34062	she	171	“ I knew that , ”
34065	34075	34076	34076	she	171	“ though you would not believe it . So , ”
34087	34111	34076	34076	she	171	“ I suppose I am left free to decide , and that you are ready to let Mr Hamlin do what he chooses . ”
34112	34119	34120	34120	he	1281	“ You are free to decide , ”
34123	34167	34169	34169	his	1281	“ Mr Hamlin , as I have said , is serious and honest , and willing to make every provision which can bind him and leave you free , legally . I can not , as your guardian , say no . But , ”
34176	34199	34169	34169	his	1281	“ as your kinsman , and as the representative of your father , I most earnestly dissuade you from accepting this proposal . ”
34203	34212	34213	34213	she	171	“ But you can no longer oppose it , ”
34217	34236	34238	34238	Brown	171	“ I have told you before that you are free , Anne . And because you are free , ”
34254	34354	34355	34355	Anne	171	indifference—“because you are free , I want you to listen to me . This proposal is one which , in the eyes of the world , will change your life for the better : you will be educated , get the manners of a lady , be rich yourself , and marry a rich man . But will you stand higher in your own opinion ? Would you stand as high as you should in that of your father , if he were alive ? You , having bartered your freedom , having accepted all from this one man ? ”
34360	34364	34367	34368	Richard Brown	223	“ Of course , ”
34371	34540	34367	34368	Richard Brown	223	“ you will have every worldly advantage . But will you be happy taken out of your own sphere of life , knowing yourself to be bound in gratitude to this man , who will always continue to feel your superior , to look down upon you as a beggar whom he has fed , or a chattel which he has bought ? This man is , for his class and ideas , honourable : he wishes to leave you free to marry him only if you please ; he wishes to marry you really and truly . But in reality he is making you his slave ; for how can you refuse him the only thing which you , my poor Nan , can give him in return for his money ? And in reality he is making you his mistress ; for what sort of marriage is it which is a marriage merely before the world — where the one buys and the other is bought ? ”
34631	34636	34638	34638	Brown	171	“ Annie , dear , ”
34642	34737	34638	34638	Brown	171	“ you know I am a rough man , and do n’t know how to mince matters and say things to women ; but you know that I am fond of you . Do n’t you recollect when you were a wee lassie , and I used to carry you about on my back , and go into the water to get you the sea‐weeds and the little nautiluses . I suppose you do n’t any longer . But still , you know I would not for the world hurt my poor little Nan . ”
34769	34777	34779	34779	Brown	171	“ Do n’t cry — don’t cry ! ”
34785	34934	34779	34779	Brown	171	“ Poor child ! I know it must be very hard for you who are so young ; I know what it must be to be tempted with a lady ’s education , and money , and a fine gentleman , who ’s in love with one , for a husband . But remember what your poor dad used to tell us , that we common folk must make our own way — make the others feel that we ’re as good as they , and not accept anything from them . D’you remember how he used to say to me , ‘ Work and be proud ’ ? Well , and I have worked and have been proud , and it ’s that that has enabled me to rest a little . And you , too , must be proud , and work , my little Annie . ”
34935	34939	34940	34940	he	1284	“ Look here , ”
34944	35082	35083	35083	He	1285	“ you must not think you are never to be anything but a servant . I feel I ’ve been to blame , and neglected you too long . You see , I ’ve had to work hard for my life , out in England ; but now I am quite safely off — indeed much better off than I ever anticipated : my employer is going to take me into partnership next year . Well , since you wish to go to school , I will send you there . You shall come back with me to England , and I will send you to the very best school to be found : you shall be as good as any lady , and you shall owe nothing to any one . Annie , do say yes . ”
35178	35186	35187	35187	she	171	“ You are very good , Dick , ”
35196	35214	35216	35216	she	171	“ but — but — oh no , no , I ca n’t , I ca n’t ! ”
35224	35229	35231	35231	Brown	223	“ Ca n’t what ? ”
35240	35346	35234	35234	his	223	“ ca n’t what ? Ca n’t accept my offer ; ca n’t owe anything to me , to your cousin , to the man to whom your father confided you ? No ! you wo n’t be under such an obligation , eh ? Nay , do n’t humbug me . You ca n’t give up the money , the land , the house , the fine name — all the things which he can give you and I ca n’t ; for I can only give you an education , and I was such a fool as to think that you wanted that ! ”
35356	35364	35365	35365	he	223	“ You want to marry that man , ”
35370	35490	35365	35365	he	223	“ well , do so . But remember what marriage means . You are a girl of the people , who has had to take care of herself — not a fine young lady , as yet , thank God , with all the fine names which fine folk have for nasty things . You know what marriage means . It means being a man ’s chattel , more than his beast of burden , his plaything , the toy of his caprice and sensuality . It means , also , that you must smother all love for a worthier man , or degrade yourself in your own eyes . Will you be this , sell yourself thus — ? ”
35491	35502	35504	35505	the girl	583	“ Mr Hamlin does not wish me to degrade myself , ”
35507	35522	35504	35505	the girl	583	“ He respects me,—yes , he does ; and you — you do n’t ! ”
35523	35528	35530	35530	Brown	223	“ He respects you ! ”
35532	35585	35530	35530	Brown	223	“ And he does not want to degrade you . Of course , he ’s a respectable , highly moral man . But , upon my soul , I would rather you had been seduced by a man you loved , than that you should have sold yourself coldly in this way . ”
35626	35631	35612	35612	she	171	“ I love him ! ”
35682	35687	35688	35688	she	171	“ I love him ! ”

35708	35760	35700	35700	he	1291	“ I left the choice in your hands , and you have chosen . To‐morrow morning I shall settle everything with Mr Hamlin — the papers , I mean — which shall make him henceforth your sole protector . Then I shall go . Goodbye . I wish you joy of your choice”—he
35761	35765	35766	35766	Anne	171	paused—“you mercenary thing ! ”
35785	35790	35791	35791	he	1291	“ One thing more , ”
35794	35907	35791	35791	he	1291	“ which I desire you to know . You have taken care of yourself hitherto , and you are prudent enough in all conscience , and world‐wise enough , and heartless enough , to do so in future ; so this piece of information may be of use to you . To‐morrow he will sign a paper , which I shall keep till you come of age , declaring that , although he leaves you complete freedom in the choice of a husband , he binds himself to marry you whenever you may call upon him to do so . You will doubtless know how to turn this to profit . Good‐bye . ”

37473	37504	37470	37470	she	230	“ oh no , no — you ca n’t understand . I do n’t feel lonely — I do n’t feel unhappy — but it ’s only because Mr Hamlin — ”

Flowers seem to grow well , as it is pretty well beyond reach of smoke . There are also some fine elms and poplars in front , all along the river‐side , which is old‐fashioned , and .not yet made into a modern embankment . It is rather far from the world ; but the world is hideous , and the farther away from it the better , do n’t you think ? My aunt is busy about the practical household properties ; I am getting in some of the more useless furniture . If you should dislike the arrangement , it can all be easily undone . I hope you will not disapprove of this step ; the house is pretty well unique , and I had to decide on taking it , unless some one else was to snap it up ; otherwise I should certainly have consulted you first . I trust you will forgive me . ”
43612	43704	43747	43751	the girl from New Zealand	1538	“ There are two rooms additional on the garden , having a separate entrance from the embankment , and which I think you will not at present require for yourself . Would you perhaps let me rent them for a studio ? My own lodgings are a long way from St John ’s House ( that is its name , for it was a priory once ) ; but if I had my workshop there , I might hope to see you almost every day , if you would let me . ”
43800	43806	43808	43808	Anne	171	“ I am going away , ”
43815	43826	43812	43812	she	171	it—“going away from school — to London , next month . ”
43838	43846	43847	43847	she	171	“ Oh , are you really going ? ”
43886	43904	43847	43847	she	171	“ Are you really going , Annie ? . . . Oh , I am so sorry ! ”
43905	43908	43910	43910	Anne	171	“ Sorry ? ”
43912	43935	43910	43910	Anne	171	“ it is very nasty of you to be sorry — I am glad ; oh , so glad ! so glad ! ”
44003	44012	44014	44014	Anne	171	“ Oh , forgive me ! forgive me ! ”
44046	44074	44075	44077	The New Zealander	1548	“ forgive me , forgive — I am a brute — a beast — oh dear , oh dear , that happiness should make me so wicked ! ”
44095	44102	44103	44103	she	171	“ Will you remember me sometimes ? ”
44106	44113	44103	44103	she	171	“ I love you so much . ”
44124	44134	44135	44135	she	171	“ Oh yes , I will always remember you , ”
44297	44316	44317	44317	he	145	“ I am sure you will enjoy it much more than the vile , vulgar , usual route , ”
44470	44483	44484	44484	she	231	“ Mr Hamlin has sent a girl to fetch you , dear , ”
44487	44492	44494	44494	Anne	171	“ To fetch me ? ”
44503	44508	44509	44509	she	231	door—“Pray , come in , ”
44538	44544	44546	44547	Mrs Simson	230	“ This is Miss Brown , ”
44569	44586	44588	44590	the young woman	586	“ Mrs Macgregor , Mr Hamlin ’s aunt , engaged me as your travelling‐maid , miss , ”
44607	44706	44601	44601	Hamlin	145	“ MY DEAR MISS BROWN,—My aunt is unfortunately too delicate to admit of my asking her to fetch you from Coblenz ; but she has engaged the bearer to be your maid , unless you have some previous . choice at Coblenz , in which case , please forgive our interference . She is highly recommended , and seems a good girl , and accustomed to travel . She will telegraph me how you are from Cologne and Antwerp . I shall await you Thursday evening on the wharf . Till then , farewell.—Your sincere and impatient friend , “
44710	44750	44707	44708	WALTER HAMLIN	145	” For some unaccountable reason Anne felt quite angry . She did not require any one to travel with her ; she did not want a maid . The very word maid seemed to bring up her whole past . “
44759	44767	44751	44751	You	1558	” she said to the girl coldly . “
44773	44783	44751	44751	You	1558	” said Mrs Simson , reading Hamlin ’s note . “
44791	44797	44784	44784	I	0	” cried Anne , angrily . “
44812	44874	44784	44784	I	0	” answered Mrs Simson , blandly . But Anne felt miserable , she knew not why , and hated the maid . Presently she went up to her room to pack her trunk . On opening the door she discovered the maid — her maid — on her knees , emptying the chest of drawers , and folding thing after thing . “
44881	44888	44889	44889	I	0	” cried Anne , turning purple . “
44897	44913	44889	44889	I	0	” The girl stared politely , and answered in a subdued , respectfully chiding tone — “
44923	44924	44914	44914	I	0	” “
44931	44937	44929	44929	myself	0	” cried Anne , excitedly . “
44944	44956	44942	44942	madam	4383	” was the maid ’s icy answer ; and she rose . “
44964	44985	44986	44986	You	4237	” she said , standing by the door , with a reproachful , prim little face . Anne was ashamed . “
44994	45055	44986	44986	You	4237	” she answered , rather humbled ; and she began folding her things . But the girl was much quicker than she , and Anne soon remained with nothing to do , looking on vacantly . She felt as if she would give worlds to get the girl away ; she felt as if she ought to say to her , “
45087	45111	45085	45085	myself	0	” — and as if every moment of silence were a kind of deceit . At last she could bear it no longer — “
45114	45118	45139	45139	you	4237	” she cried , “
45144	45151	45139	45139	you	4237	” The girl rose and retired . “
45158	45172	45156	45156	miss	4492	” she replied , fixing her eyes on Anne ’s strange excited face . “
45191	45923	45184	45184	she	1568	” thought Anne . The next evening , among the lamentations of Mrs Simson ’s establishment , Anne Brown set off for Cologne . This first short scrap of journey moved her very much : when the train puffed out of the station , and the familiar faces were hidden by outhouses and locomotives , the sense of embarking on unknown waters rushed upon Anne ; and when , that evening , her maid bade her good night at the hotel at Cologne , offering to brush her hair and help her to undress , she was seized with intolerable homesickness for the school,—the little room she had just left,—and she would have implored any one to take her back . But the next days she felt quite different : the excitement of novelty kept her up , and almost made it seem as if all these new things were quite habitual ; for there is nothing stranger than the way in which excitement settles one in novel positions , and familiarises one with the unfamiliar . Seeing a lot of sights on the way , and knowing that a lot more remained to be seen , it was as if there were nothing beyond these three or four days — as if the journey would have no end ; that an end there must be , and what that end meant seemed a thing impossible to realise . She scarcely began to realise it when the ship began slowly to move from the wharf at Antwerp ; when she walked up and down the deserted and darkened deck watching the widening river under the clear blue spring night , lit only by a ripple of moonlight , widening mysteriously out of sight , bounded only by the shore‐lights , with here or there the white or blue or red light of some ship , and its long curl of smoke , making you suddenly conscious that close by was another huge moving thing , more human creatures in this solitude,—till at last all was mere moonlight‐permeated mist of sky and sea . And only as the next day — as the boat cut slowly through the hazy , calm sea — was drawing to its close , did Anne begin to feel at all excited . At first , as she sat on deck , the water , the smoke , the thrill of the boat , the people walking np and down , the children wandering about among the piles of rope , and leaning over the ship ’s sides — all these things seemed the only reality . But later , as they got higher up in the Thames , and the unwonted English sunshine became dimmer , a strange excitement arose in Anne — an excitement more physical than mental , which , with every movement of the boat , made her heart beat faster and faster , till it seemed as if it must burst , and a lot of smaller hearts to start up and throb all over her body , tighter and tighter , till she had to press her hand to her chest , and sit down gasping on a bench . The afternoon was drawing to a close , and the river had narrowed ; all around were rows of wharves and groups of ships ; the men began to tug at the ropes . They were in the great city . The light grew fainter , and the starlight mingled with the dull smoke‐grey of London ; all about were the sad grey outlines of the old houses on the wharves , the water grey and the sky also , with only a faint storm‐red where the sun had set . The rigging , interwoven against the sky , was grey also ; the brownish sail of some nearer boat , the dull red sides of some steamer hard by , the only colour . The ship began to slacken speed and to turn , great puffs and pants of the engine running through its fibres ; the sailors began to halloo , the people around to collect their luggage : they were getting alongside of the wharf . Anne felt the maid throw a shawl round her ; heard her voice , as if from a great distance , saying , “
45931	45998	45926	45927	Mr Hamlin	145	” felt herself walking along as if in a dream ; and as if in a dream a figure come up and take her hand , and slip her arm through his , and she knew herself to be standing on the wharf , in the twilight , the breeze blowing in her face , all the people jostling and shouting around her . Then a voice said—“I
46009	46329	46006	46007	Miss Brown	171	” It was at once so familiar and so strange that it made her start ; the dream seemed dispelled . She was in reality , and Hamlin was really by her side . IT is sad to think how little even the most fervently loving among us are able to reproduce , to keep within recollection , the reality of the absent beloved ; certain as we seem to be , living as appears the phantom which we have cherished , we yet always find , on the day of meeting , that the loved person is different from the simulacrum which we have carried in our hearts . As Anne Brown sat in the carriage which was carrying her to her new home , the feeling which was strongest in her was , not joy to see Hamlin again , nor fear at entering on this new phase of existence , but a recurring shock of surprise at the voice which was speaking to her , the voice which she now recognised as that of the real Hamlin , but which was so undefinably different from the voice which had haunted her throughout those months of absence . Hamlin was seated by her side , the maid opposite . The carriage drove quickly through a network of dark streets , and then , on , on , along miles of embankment . It was a beautiful spring night , and the mists and fogs which hung over river and town were soaked with moonlight , turned into a pale‐blue luminous haze , starred with the yellow specks of gas , broken into , here and there , by the yellow sheen from some open hall‐door or lit windows of a party‐giving house : out of the faint blueness emerged the unsubstantial outlines of things — bushes , and overhanging tree‐branches , and distant spectral towers and belfries . “
46336	46340	46330	46330	You	1571	” said Hamlin . “
46344	46359	46330	46330	You	1571	” answered Anne , that repeated revelation of the real voice still startling her — “
46364	46462	46463	46463	I	0	” He asked her how she had left those at Coblenz , and about her journey ; she had to tell him about every picture and church she had seen at Cologne , Brussels , Bruges , and Antwerp . It is strange how people whose hearts have seemed full to bursting with things they have so long been waiting to say , will talk , when they meet again , like persons introduced for the first time at a dinner‐party . On they rolled , and on , through the pale moonlight mist by the river . “
46466	46482	46463	46463	I	0	” said Hamlin , when they had done discussing Van Eyck , and Rubens , and Memling—“I
46500	46504	46505	46505	I	0	” he added , “
46526	46793	46513	46513	She	4294	” His aunt ! Anne had forgotten all about her ; and her heart sank within her as the carriage at last drew up in front of some garden railings . The house door was thrown open , and a stream of yellow light flooded the strip of garden and the railings . Hamlin gave Anne his arm ; the maid followed . A woman‐servant was holding the door open , and raising a lamp above her . Anne bent her head , feeling that she was being scrutinised . She walked speechless , leaning on Hamlin ’s arm , and those steps seemed to her endless . It was all very strange and wonderful . Her step was muffled in thick , dark carpets ; all about , the walls of the narrow passage were covered with tapestries , and here and there came a gleam of brass or a sheen of dim mirror under the subdued light of some sort of Eastern lamp , which hung , with yellow sheen of metal discs and tassels , from the ceiling . Thus up the narrow carpeted and tapestried stairs , and into a large dim room , with strange‐looking things all about . Some red embers sent a crimson flicker over the carpet ; by the tall fireplace was a table with a shaded lamp , and at it was seated a tall , slender woman , with the figure of a young girl , but whose face , when Anne saw it , was parched and hollowed out , and surrounded by grey hair . “
46802	46821	46796	46797	Miss Brown	171	” said Hamlin . The old lady rose , advanced , and kissed Anne frigidly on both cheeks . “
46832	46890	46827	46827	you	1575	” she said , in a tone which was neither cold nor insincere , but simply and utterly indifferent . Anne sat down . There was a moment ’s silence , and she felt the old lady ’s eyes upon her , and felt that Hamlin was looking at his aunt , as much as to say , “
46900	46907	46895	46895	you	0	” and she shrank into herself . “
46917	46929	46908	46908	You	1575	” said Mrs Macgregor after a moment , vaguely and dreamily . “
46933	46939	46908	46908	You	1575	” answered Anne , faintly , “
46948	46949	46946	46946	you	1575	” “
46955	46964	46946	46946	you	1575	” went on the old lady , absently . “
46972	46996	46970	46970	Walter	145	” Hamlin rang . In a moment tea‐things were brought . Hamlin handed a cup to Anne , and offered her some cake . “
47003	47008	46946	46946	you	1575	” said Mrs Macgregor — “
47020	47021	47022	47023	Miss Brown	171	” “
47041	47045	47039	47039	aunt	1579	” corrected Hamlin . “
47081	47109	47079	47079	Walter	145	” But while Mrs Macgregor ’s mind and words seemed to ramble vaguely about , her eyes were fixed upon Anne — large , melancholy dark eyes . “
47123	47127	47121	47121	you	145	” she asked . “
47138	47173	47121	47121	you	145	” answered Anne , shyly ; all this dim room , with its vague sense of beautiful things all round , this absent‐minded lady , all seemed to harmonise with her own dreamlike sensations . “
47181	47191	47121	47121	you	145	” explained Hamlin , probably for the hundredth time . “
47243	47244	47228	47235	a man from — what ’s his name	1580	” “
47248	47252	47228	47235	a man from — what ’s his name	1580	” interrupted Hamlin . “
47262	47267	47260	47260	Margaret	249	” asked Mrs Macgregor . “
47275	47276	47273	47273	auntie	1582	” “
47296	47341	47294	47294	Rachel	250	” Thus they went on for another half‐hour ; Mrs Macgregor calling Anne by one wrong name after another , alluding to things which she could not possibly know anything about , and Hamlin trying to set matters right and induce Anne to talk . “
47347	47351	47294	47294	Rachel	250	” he said , “
47379	47380	47367	47367	you	145	” “
47386	47390	47381	47381	I	0	” protested Anne . “
47397	47403	47391	47391	You	0	” said the old lady . “
47406	47410	47391	47391	You	0	” added Hamlin , “
47460	47467	47457	47458	Miss Brown	171	” and he kissed her hand . “
47477	47572	47457	47458	Miss Brown	171	” The few words of Italian almost brought the tears to Anne ’s eyes ; she felt so strange here , so far from everything — and yet what had she left behind ? nothing , and no one who loved her , except that little girl from New Zealand . She felt terribly alone in the world . Hamlin had evidently not trusted to his aunt to send Anne to bed , for the maid came in uncalled , and asked whether Miss Brown would not like to go up to her room . “
47576	47630	47457	47458	Miss Brown	171	” said Mrs Macgregor ; and taking a heavy old‐fashioned silver candlestick , she led Anne to her room . The poor girl was too weary and dazed to see what it was like . She sank on to a chair , and passively let the maid take off her hat and cloak . “
47638	47647	47632	47632	I	0	” she asked . Anne shook her head . “
47652	47683	47632	47632	I	0	” The girl retired , but Mrs Macgregor remained standing by Anne ’s side , looking at the reflection in the glass of her pale , sad , tired face . “
47691	47725	47688	47688	Eliza	169	” said Mrs Macgregor . Anne mechanically pulled out the hair‐pins , and the masses of iron‐black crisp hair fell over her shoulders . The old lady looked at her for a moment . “
47734	47745	47732	47732	Anne	171	” she said , at last hitting the right name , “
47748	47766	47688	47688	Eliza	169	” she added , with a curious compassionate look , as she kissed the girl ’s forehead , “
47775	47787	47768	47768	you	0	” Anne did not answer ; but she felt herself redden . “
47796	47802	47768	47768	you	0	” said the old lady , “
47842	48936	48937	48937	I	0	” The words went on in Anne ’s head , but she was too worn out to understand them . She soon fell asleep , and dreamed that Melton Perry had painted a picture , and that in a storm the ship ’s crew said it must be used as a raft ; and somehow it all took place at Florence , in the large pond in the Boboli Gardens . ANNE BROWN awoke with a vague sense of gladness , but no very clear notion of where she was . Then it came upon her that this was Hamlin ’s house , that she would actually see him again in a few hours ; for it was as if she had not seen him at all the previous evening . The sun was streaming through the blinds , filling the room with a yellowish light ; from without came a sound of leaves , of twittering birds , and the plash of the steamer‐paddles in the river . Anne looked round her and wondered . She had never seen such a room as this in her life : the wails were all panelled white , except where the panelling was interrupted by expanses of pale‐yellow chintz ; the furniture also was of old‐fashioned chintz ; the mirror was like what she had seen in the illustrations to an old copy of ‘ Sir Charles Grandison ’ which had belonged to Miss Curzon ; the tapered chairs and tables to match . There were blue‐and‐white jars and pots all about , and old‐fashioned china things on the dressing‐table : except for the fac‐similes of drawings by Mantegna and Botticelli , and the coloured copies of famous Italian pictures which dotted the walls , the room might have been untouched since the days of the first Georges . She remembered that Hamlin had told her that the house was an old one ; but she could not understand how everything came to look so very spick and span and new . She got up and went to the window . Below , in the little garden , was a lilac‐tree bursting into flower , and a yellow laburnum . A milkman ’s cart was drawn up before the door . In front were the trees , in tender leaf , and the wooden parapet of the river‐walk ; then the Thames , still wide , but so different from what she had seen it the previous evening : a clear grey stream reflecting green banks and cloudy blue sky , with here and there a barge or boat moored by the shore . The sky was blue , but covered with moist clouds , and it seemed to Anne that she could almost see where it arose on the horizon , so low did it seem . There was a scent of recent rain in the air , a shimmer of moisture on the leaves and grass . Was this London , which she had always fancied so noisy , and grimy , and vulgarly new ? Anne was already half dressed ; but she spent some time wondering which of her frocks she should put on : they had been made expressly for London , and greatly admired by the girls at Coblenz , but now one looked more absurd and frumpish than the other . At last she put on a sort of greyish‐blue tweed , such as were then worn on the Continent , and having looked at herself rather anxiously in the glass , she opened her door and hesitatingly went out into the passage . All was perfectly quiet as she went down the carpeted stairs , wondering at the tapestry and brazen wrought shields and plaster casts and curious weapons which covered its walls ; she could hear only the ticking of the old clock , which stood in its tall inlaid case in the hall . After the bustle of girls and servants at the Coblenz school , and the hundred and one noises of screeching well‐pulleys , whirring buckets , whistling starlings , singing and chattering servants , clattering crockery , which greet the early riser in an Italian house,—this silence seemed to her almost eerie , and she wandered about over the noiseless floors like the knight in the palace of the sleeping beauty . She found her way into the drawing‐room , where she had been received the previous evening ; there was another next to it , and a kind of little library beyond . It was , indeed , an enchanted palace ; the walls were all hung with pictures and drawings , and pieces of precious embroidery , and burnished oriental plates , and the floors spread with oriental carpets and matting , which gave out a faint , drowsy , sweet scent . The curious furniture was covered with old brocade and embroidery , and in all corners , on brackets and tables and in cabinets , were all manner of wonderful glass and china , and strange ivory and inlaid Japanese toys . There were flowers , also , about everywhere , and palms in the windows . In the library were more books than Anne had almost ever seen ; and in the chief drawing‐room a beautiful grand piano , not made like those of our days , but with slight straight legs and a yellow case painted with faded‐looking flowers . Anne looked at everything with astonishment and awe : it was like the rooms in Walter Crane ’s fairy books , with their inlaid chests and brocade couches , and majolica vases full of peacocks ’ feathers . It took her a long time to take it all in . She stole to the piano , opened it gently , and played the accompaniment of a song of Carissimi ’s , which Hamlin was fond of , but inaudibly , without letting her fingers press down the keys . Then she looked at everything once more . She was beginning to get familiarised with the pictures on the wall ; the pale , delicate bits of landscape ; the deep‐coloured pictures of ladies in wonderful jewel‐like robes , with mysterious landscapes behind them ; the drawings of strange , beautiful , emaciated , cruel‐looking creatures , men or women , with wicked lips and combed‐out locks,—all these things , which were like so many points of interrogation — when the door opened and the maid appeared . “
48947	48951	48937	48937	I	0	” she said . “
49012	49048	48979	48980	Mrs Macgregor	243	” Anne followed the servant to Mrs Macgregor ’s room , where she found the old lady in her dressing‐gown , before a table spread with eighteenth‐century china , or what to Anne seemed such . “
49060	49071	49058	49058	Charlotte	255	” said Mrs Macgregor , kissing Anne on both cheeks . “
49119	49135	49110	49110	me	0	” And Mrs Macgregor made Anne turn round slowly . She looked at her approvingly . “
49144	49148	49138	49140	a handsome girl	1595	” she said ; “
49159	49169	49138	49140	a handsome girl	1595	time,”—and she smiled with the faint smile of an old belle,—“girls
49236	49308	49231	49234	a good flesh‐and‐blood girl	1597	” Anne did not know what to answer ; she poured herself out a cup of tea in silence , and vaguely ate some bread and butter . The old lady was good‐natured , garrulous , flighty ; but yet , beneath the shiftiness of her exterior , there seemed to be something real , something sad and bitter , when you looked at her thin drawn mouth and melancholy eyes . “
49321	49325	49231	49234	a good flesh‐and‐blood girl	1597	” she pursued , “
49511	49807	49509	49509	he	178	young”—and Mrs Macgregor became suddenly very silent . After breakfast Anne was free until luncheon‐time , as Mrs Macgregor proceeded to lie down on her sofa and read Leigh Hunt ’s ‘ Religion of the Heart , ’ or Fox ’s ‘ Religious Ideas , ’ which Anne saw lying on her table . Hamlin ’s aunt had evidently been an esprit fort in her youth , and possessed in her bedroom a whole library of what were once deemed literary firebrands , but might nowadays be described as mild , old‐fashioned free‐thinking literature . Anne roamed about the drawing‐room once more , looking again and again at the pictures , and opening the books , as people do in a strange house , before they can settle down . She timidly also opened the piano , but shut it again after a minute . Then she took a volume of Jean Paul out of a shelf , and carried it up into her room . Finding it too dull to read , and with an irritating sense that she ought to be doing something definite , she wrote a letter to Mrs Simson , and one to the little New Zealander . She felt so much like a fish out of water that Coblenz seemed more than her birthplace , and the people there more than mother and sisters . At last she heard one o’clock strike , and soon after there came a knock at the house‐door , and running to the window she saw Hamlin standing on the doorstep . She withdrew her head quickly , and went down to meet him . He was more respectful than ever,—asked her how she had slept , and what she thought of the house . “
49812	49816	49509	49509	he	178	” said Anne , “
49828	49829	49509	49509	he	178	” “
49833	49837	49509	49509	he	178	” asked Hamlin . “
49868	49869	49885	49885	they	1612	” “
49875	49881	49885	49885	they	1612	” answered Hamlin , sadly ; “
49910	49911	49902	49902	nobody	1614	” “
49937	49953	49915	49915	they	1612	” asked Anne , looking with wonder upon these new things which seemed so old . “
49962	49990	49915	49915	they	1612	” said Hamlin , seating himself opposite her and looking her full in the face as he used to do long ago at the studio in Florence . “
50021	50022	50004	50004	We	1616	” “
50037	50094	50095	50095	I	0	” asked Anne , a vague remembrance of things which she had heard her father say years ago about progress and modern achievements returning to her mind as it had never done when , in the letters which he used to write to her at Coblenz , Hamlin had said before what he was saying now . “
50104	50108	50095	50095	I	0	” replied Hamlin , “
50114	50115	50118	50118	we	1616	” “
50122	50152	50118	50118	we	1616	” asked Anne , scarcely thinking of what she was saying ; conscious only that she was really once more in his presence . Hamlin shook his head sadly . “
50160	50181	50156	50156	we	1616	” he said , pointing to a bunch of delicate pale‐pink roses , which drooped withered in a Venetian glass . “
50341	50342	50346	50346	you	1625	” “
50352	50356	50346	50346	you	1625	” cried Anne . “
50379	50414	50346	50346	you	1625	” Hamlin shook his head , and remained for some time with his beautiful greenish‐blue eyes fixed on Anne , as she sat twisting and untwisting the fringe on the arm of her chair . “
50423	50454	50420	50421	Miss Brown	171	” said Hamlin , rising from his chair and leaning against the chimney‐piece , all covered with Japanese cups and curious nick‐nacks , and not taking his eyes off her , “
50504	50546	50566	50566	you	1631	” Hamlin spoke these lover‐like words in a tone so cold , so sad , that Anne did not at first understand to whom he was alluding , and looked up rather in interrogation than in embarrassment . A bell rang . “
50551	50555	50566	50566	you	1631	” said Hamlin . “
50563	50564	50566	50566	you	1631	” “
50576	50584	50574	50574	Walter	145	” asked Mrs Macgregor , after lunch . “
50595	50607	50585	50585	She	171	” Hamlin looked at Anne , as much as to say , “
50615	50616	50609	50609	you	171	” “
50631	50635	50629	50629	aunt	1579	” he said ; “
50650	50651	50652	50652	I	0	” “
50672	50689	50670	50670	Walter	145	” suggested Mrs Macgregor . Poor Anne felt a sort of horror go all down her . “
50696	50698	50670	50670	Walter	145	” she cried—“not
50712	50713	50736	50736	you	1631	” “
50723	50733	50736	50736	you	1631	” said Hamlin , in a tone of annoyance . “
50749	50754	50747	50747	Watty	178	” insisted his aunt . “
50783	50784	50772	50773	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	” “
50789	50793	50786	50787	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	” exclaimed Hamlin . “
50833	50834	50796	50796	your	1631	” “
50839	50845	50796	50796	your	1631	” answered Anne , laughing . “
50856	50857	50846	50846	I	0	” “
50901	50902	50888	50888	I	0	” “
50906	50910	50888	50888	I	0	” cried Anne ; “
50915	50916	50917	50917	I	0	” “
50926	50931	50917	50917	I	0	” interrupted Mrs Macgregor . “
50954	50961	50917	50917	I	0	” Hamlin reddened , but laughed . “
50996	50997	50986	50986	Chough	248	” “
51002	51008	50986	50986	Chough	248	” merely remarked Mrs Macgregor . “
51019	51024	51012	51012	he	262	” went on Hamlin . “
51037	51038	51027	51029	a strange creature	1644	” “
51043	51049	51027	51029	a strange creature	1644	” put in his aunt . “
51066	51069	51062	51064	a real poet	1646	” went on Hamlin—“indeed
51114	51115	51116	51120	The son of a duke	1652	” “
51122	51129	51132	51134	the natural son	1654	” asked Anne , in surprise . “
51145	51150	51151	51151	People	577	” said Mrs Macgregor . “
51192	51196	51197	51198	Poor Chough	265	” Hamlin smiled . “
51230	51728	51729	51730	Miss Brown	171	” They went together into the strip of garden which lay behind the house . There were not many flowers out as yet , only a few peonies and lilacs , and a belated tulip or hyacinth , but there was green , daisied grass , and big grey‐mossed apple‐trees still in blossom ; and across the low walls , covered with creepers , you saw big waving tree‐branches , and old brick houses covered with ivy : the birds were singing , and some hens clucking next door . It was very quiet and old‐world . Hamlin showed her all the rose‐buds which might soon come out , and the place where the lilies would be , and the espaliers for the sweet‐peas . Then they went into the two ground‐floor rooms which he was arranging for his studio : there were quantities of beautiful rare books and volumes of prints , and Persian and Japanese and old Italian metal‐work , and pottery all about , and easels with unfinished pictures evcrywhere — a great and beautiful confusion . When he had showed her his properties , and she had reverently handled the things which had once belonged to Shelley and Keats , and the bundles of unpublished manuscripts , entrusted to Hamlin by living poets , they sat down in the studio and began to discuss various matters : Anne ’s school life , her readings and lessons , Hamlin ’s work , art , poetry , life , all sorts of things,—a long and drowsy afternoon ’s talk , such as is possible only after a long correspondence between people become familiar without much personal intercourse , who , knowing each other ’s mind , are now beginning to know each other ’s face and ways and heart ; and which has a charm quite peculiar to itself , like that of hearing for the first time , with full symphony of voices and instruments , some piece of music which we have learned to know and love merely from the dry score . Anne had never felt so happy in all her life , and Hamlin not often happier in his , as they sat in the studio , talking over abstract questions , which seemed to acquire such a quite personal interest from those who were discussing them . They were thus engaged when the servant announced Mr Cosmo Chough . Anne ’s heart sank at the thought of confronting one of Hamlin ’s most intimate friends , and one of the poets who constituted the stars of his solar system . To Anne ’s surprise Mr Chough did not at all resemble either Shelley or Keats , as she imagined ; he was a little wiry man , with fiercely brushed coal‐black hair and whiskers , dressed within an inch of his life , but in a style of fashionableness , booted and cravated , which was quite peculiar to himself . “
51732	51736	51729	51730	Miss Brown	171	” said Hamlin , “
51747	51926	51744	51745	Cosmo Chough	248	” Mr Chough made a most fascinating bow , and swooped gracefully to the other end of the studio to fetch himself a chair near Anne ’s . He was quite touchingly concerned in Anne ’s journey and her sensations after it ; and asked her whether she liked London , with a sort of expansive chivalry of manner , as of Sir Walter Raleigh spreading embroidered cloaks across puddles for Queen Elizabeth , which struck her as rather ridiculous , but very agreeable , as she had rather anticipated being scorned by Hamlin ’s poetical friends . Anne thought Mr. Chough decidedly nice , with his oriental style of politeness , and magnificent volubility , constantly quoting poetry in various languages in a shrill and chirpy voice ; moreover , he seemed to adore Hamlin , and this was enough to put him in her good graces . Mr Chough rapidly informed her what the principal poets in London and Paris ( for he spoke of French things with an affectation of throaty accent and allusions to his “
51929	52042	52043	52043	We	1662	” which greatly puzzled Anne ) were writing ; and Anne felt so completely taken into confidence that she ventured to ask him whether he was himself writing anything at present , as she had greatly admired some short pieces of his which Hamlin had sent her . Mr Chough was as modest as he was polite . His eyes shone , and he clasped his small hands in ecstasy at the idea of anything of his having pleased Miss Brown . He then proceeded to tell her that he had an idea for a long poem — a sort of masque or mystery‐play — to be called the Triumph of Womanhood . “
52065	52069	52043	52043	We	1662	” he explained ; “
52095	52097	52098	52098	I	0	“ Gloria ”
52134	52135	52117	52117	I	0	” “
52143	52172	52117	52117	I	0	” said Anne , naively . Mr Chough had opened the piano , and began playing , in a masterly way , a fragment of very intricate fugue . “
52178	52182	52174	52174	you	1666	” he asked : “
52247	52248	52229	52229	I	0	” “
52254	52258	52252	52252	you	1666	” cried Anne . “
52278	52298	52269	52269	you	1666	” interrupted Hamlin . Cosmo Chough looked mortified , and Anne wondered why Hamlin should silence his old friend . “
52307	52311	52269	52269	you	1666	” she asked . “
52329	52330	52315	52315	she	1668	” “
52338	52342	52315	52315	she	1668	” explained Chough ; “
52381	52382	52372	52372	himself	1672	” “
52393	52394	52390	52391	a saint	924	” “
52417	52421	52402	52402	I	0	” proceeded Chough ; “
52426	52427	52402	52402	I	0	” “
52437	52443	52445	52445	I	0	” interrupted Hamlin , roughly , “
52486	52492	52476	52476	Chough	248	” he explained to Anne , “
52508	52658	52494	52494	he	1677	” Chough sat down and began to sing , in a warbling falsetto , but with the most marvellous old‐world grace and finish . Anne did not attend . She was wondering about Imperia of Rome . Why had Hamlin cut short Chough ? What had Imperia done ? The remarks of Mrs Macgregor came to her mind ; and she felt indignant , and her indignation was all the greater , perhaps , because Chough ’s offence was vague and unknown — how nobly and simply Hamlin had silenced him ! She wondered whether he was very angry with Chough , and whether Chough ’s feelings had been much hurt . She felt rather sorry for the sharp way in which he had been treated , and terrified lest she should be a source of misunderstanding between Hamlin and his friends . She greatly praised Chough ’s singing . “
52663	52671	52672	52672	you	1679	” cried the little poet , supplicatingly ; “
52688	52694	52679	52679	I	0	” Anne refused in terror . “
52701	52811	52698	52699	Miss Brown	171	” urged Hamlin . So she took her courage with both hands , as she expressed it , and sang an air by Scarlatti , Chough accompanying . She made several false starts , and sang the wrong words almost throughout , for she felt a lump in her chest . Anne had a deep , powerful , rather guttural voice , not improved by singing modern German songs at Coblenz ; but the voice was fine , and she had caught something of the manner of her former protectress , Miss Curzon , who had been a great singer in her day . Chough burst out into applause . “
52816	52820	52821	52821	you	171	” he cried ; “
52848	52867	52868	52868	You	171	” Anne looked at Hamlin ; such an offer , on so slight an acquaintance , surprised her . “
52882	53027	52879	52880	Miss Brown	171	” asked Hamlin , approvingly . He afterwards told her that Chough spent whatever leisure remained from an inferior Government offce , in which , together with a whole band of other poets , he was employed , in playing accompaniments for various young ladies whom he considered , each singly , the most divine types of womanhood whom he had ever met . Chough was in high spirits , and proceeded to display to Anne two or three relics which he carried on his person . A fervent though not very orthodox Catholic , he was prone to religious mysticism : on his watch‐chain hung a gold cross , containing a bit of wood from St Theresa ’s house , which a friend had brought him from Spain ; by its side dangled a large locket , enclosing a wisp of yellow hair . “
53037	53053	53033	53034	Lucretia Borgia	275	” he said , displaying it with as much unction as he had manifested for St Theresa—“a
53071	53072	53073	53073	She	1681	” “
53089	53097	53087	53087	she	1681	” remarked Anne , not knowing what to say,—“a
53107	53113	53103	53104	the Germans	235	” Cosmo Chough was indignant . “
53116	53120	53103	53104	the Germans	235	” he cried — “
53165	53166	53167	53167	I	0	” “
53181	53192	53167	53167	I	0	” said Anne , in her frank , stolid way , “
53197	53198	53167	53167	I	0	” “
53214	53218	53205	53205	you	0	” cried Chough , “
53230	53237	53221	53221	their	1683	” Anne shook her head contemptuously . “
53248	53252	53238	53238	I	0	” she said ; “
53273	53357	53263	53263	they	1685	” and she relapsed into silence . She had had what Hamlin used to call her Amazon or Valkyr expression as she spoke ; and he felt , as he had felt in Florence , the persuasion that this proud and sombre woman must have in her future some great decision , some great sacrifice of others or of herself . While they were talking , the servant entered to tell Miss Brown that Mrs Argiropoulo was in the drawing‐room with Mrs Macgregor . “
53362	53369	53359	53360	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	” exclaimed Hamlin between his teeth , “
53376	53377	53359	53360	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	” “
53384	53388	53380	53382	the lion‐hunting lady	1687	” asked Anne . “
53405	53406	53399	53399	she	1687	” “
53411	53417	53418	53418	you	0	” repeated Anne in amazement ; “
53434	53435	53428	53428	she	1687	” “
53446	53459	53443	53444	Miss Brown	171	” exclaimed Chough enthusiastically , as he opened the door for her ; “
53506	53708	53496	53496	You	0	” Anne did not answer , but she grew purple . So every one was curious to see this nursery‐maid whom the great Hamlin had cast his eyes on , and whom he had generously educated ; for the first time her heart burst with indignation and ruffled pride . But after a moment , as she sat in the drawing‐room , after frigidly returning the fat and fashionable lion‐huntress ’s affectionate greeting , her conscience smote her : who was she , that she should feel thus ? if she did depend entirely on Hamlin ’s generosity , ought she not to be grateful merely , and proud ? and if his friends felt curious to see her , was it not natural , he being what he was ; and had she a right to feel annoyed at their curiosity , at their knowing all about her ? It had been mean and unworthy . Yet she could not help feeling a sort of vague anger at she knew not what , as the lady chattered away , in glib Greek‐English , about poets , and studios , and dinner‐parties ; and she answered Mrs Argiropoulo only in monosyllables . “
53725	53731	53712	53712	me	0	” lisped the Greek lady , “
53756	53782	53747	53754	some of the principal persons of our set	1693	” She was very fat , very good‐natured , and extremely vulgar‐looking , her huge body encased in a medieval dress of flaming gold brocade . “
53797	53801	53802	53802	Her	171	” thought Anne . “
53809	53811	53802	53803	Her husband	693	” whispered Chough—“an
53836	53837	53829	53829	Their	1702	” “
53854	53858	53838	53839	My aunt	4294	” answered Hamlin ; “
53878	53879	53865	53866	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	” “
53886	53891	53865	53866	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	” answered Mrs Argiropoulo ; “
53911	53912	53894	53894	I	0	” “
53921	53925	53913	53913	I	0	” said Hamlin . “
53931	53949	53928	53929	that woman	1707	” exclaimed Hamlin , as he returned from escorting the wife of the currant‐dealer to the door ; “
53958	53959	53950	53956	an odious , inquisitive , vulgar brute	1708	” “
53967	53971	53964	53964	I	0	” insinuated Anne . “
53979	53980	53974	53977	every one ’s good‐natured	1709	” “
53987	53994	53995	53996	Every one	4712	” asked Mrs Macgregor , bitterly . “
54000	54011	53995	53996	Every one	4712	” continued Hamlin , throwing himself back in his chair ; “
54089	54097	54045	54045	they	1711	” he added , turning to Anne , “
54120	54121	54133	54133	one	1716	” “
54129	54132	54133	54133	one	1716	” said Mrs Macgregor—“what
54185	54190	54191	54191	One	620	” Hamlin merely smiled . “
54201	54238	54191	54191	One	620	” he said , and looked at Anne . When Mr Cosmo Chough had taken his seat next to Mrs Argiropoulo , the portly lady deluged him with questions and replies as her landau rolled away . “
54257	54261	54243	54243	I	0	” she said . “
54338	54339	54343	54343	mine	0	” “
54346	54351	54343	54343	mine	0	” cried little Chough , enthusiastically—“that
54422	54433	54403	54403	I	0	” At this grand winding up Mrs Argiropoulo laughed loudly . “
54444	54448	54440	54442	those young men	1732	” she said . “
54503	54530	54493	54493	I	0	” This was an old joke , for Mr Cosmo Chough always surrounded his dwelling‐place with mystery , and had his letters addressed to his office . “
54537	54545	54547	54547	me	0	” he said in a stately way ; “
54568	54569	54556	54556	I	0	” “
54577	55479	54556	54556	I	0	” ordered Mrs Argiropoulo of her footman , who knew , as well as his mistress and every other creature in what they called London , that Mr Cosmo Chough lived in a secluded terrace in Canonbury . ANNE BROWN found that Hamlin , or , as he studiously put it , Mrs Macgregor , had made several engagements for her before her arrival ; and before she could thoroughly realise that the school , the journey from Coblenz , were things of the past , she found herself being led about , passively , half unconsciously , through the mazes of æsthetic London . It was all very hazy : Anne was informed that this and that person was coming to dinner or lunch at Hammersmith ; that this or that person hoped she would come and dine or take tea somewhere or other ; that such or such a lady was going to take her to see some one or other ’s studio , or to introduce her at some other person ’s house . She knew that they were all either distinguished poets , or critics , or painters , or musicians , or distinguished relations and friends of the above ; that they all received her as if they had heard of her from their earliest infancy ; that they pressed her to have tea , and strawberries , and claret‐cup , and cakes , and asked her what she thought of this picture or that poem ; that they lived in grim , smut‐engrained houses in Bloomsbury , or rose‐grown cottages at Hampstead , with just the same sort of weird furniture , partly Japanese , partly Queen Anne , partly medieval ; with blue‐and‐white china and embroidered chasubles stuck upon the walls if they were rich , and twopenny screens and ninepenny pots if they were poor , but with no further differences ; and , finally , that they were all intimately acquainted , and spoke of each other as being , or just having missed being , the most brilliant or promising specimens of whatever they happened to be . At first Anne felt very shy and puzzled ; but after a few days the very vagueness which she felt about all these men and women , these artists , critics , poets , and relatives , who were perpetually reappearing as on a merry‐go‐round,—nay , the very cloudiness as to the identity of these familiar faces — the very confusion as to whether they were one , two , or three different individuals,—produced in Miss Brown an indifference , an ease , almost a familiarity , like that which we may experience towards the vague , unindividual company met on a steamer or at a hotel . And little by little , out of this crowd of people who seemed to look , and to dress , and to talk very much alike,—venerable bearded men , who were the heads of great schools of painting , or poetry , or criticism , or were the papas of great offspring ; elderly , quaintly dressed ladies , who were somebody ’s wife , or mother , or sister ; youngish men , with manners at once exotically courteous , and curiously free and easy , in velveteen coats and mustard‐coloured shooting‐jackets or elegiac‐looking dress‐coats , all rising in poetry , or art , or criticism ; young ladies , varying from sixteen to six‐and‐thirty , with hair cut like medieval pages , or tousled like mœnads , or tucked away under caps like eighteenth‐century housekeepers , habited in limp and stayless garments , picturesque and economical , with Japanese chintzes for brocade , and flannel instead of stamped velvets — most of which young ladies appeared at one period , past , present , or future , to own a connection with the Slade school , and all of whom , when not poets or painters themselves , were the belongings of some such , or madly in love with the great sonneteer such a one , or the great colourist such another;—out of all this confusion there began gradually to detach themselves and assume consistency in Anne ’s mind one or two personalities , some of whom attracted , and some of whom repelled her , as we shall see further on ; but to all these people , vague or distinct , attractive or repulsive , Miss Brown felt a kind of gratitude — something , in an infinitesimal degree , of the thankfulness for undeserved kindness and courtesy which constituted a large part of her love for Hamlin . It was a curious state of things , thus to be introduced by a man whom she knew at once so much and so little , to this exclusive and esoteric sort of people ; and whenever the thought would come upon her how completely and utterly she , the daughter of the dockyard workman of Spezia , the former servant of the little Perrys , was foreign to all this , it made her feel alone and giddy , like one standing on a rock and watching the waters below . Such was the condition of things when one morning , about three weeks after Anne ’s arrival , Hamlin put upon the luncheon‐table a note addressed to Miss Brown . “
55494	55498	54556	54556	I	0	” he said ; “
55544	55545	55538	55539	Aunt Claudia	247	” “
55553	55641	55546	55547	Aunt Claudia	247	” answered Mrs Macgregor , in a bitter little tone . Anne could not quite understand this amiable and cynical old lady , who was at once devotedly attached to her nephew , and perpetually railing at his friends . A fear seized her lest , in her vague , almost somnambulic introduction into æsthetic society , she might have unconsciously neglected the woman who , proud of her birth as she was , requested this workman ’s daughter to address and consider her as her aunt . “
55649	55653	55546	55547	Aunt Claudia	247	” cried Anne ; “
55662	55663	55659	55660	Mrs Macgregor	243	” “
55668	55672	55546	55547	Aunt Claudia	247	” hesitated Hamlin , “
55687	55688	55690	55690	she	261	” “
55703	55713	55717	55717	she	261	” interrupted Aunt Claudia , with her friendly cynicism , “
55741	55742	55735	55736	Miss Pringle	287	” “
55771	55772	55764	55765	Aunt Claudia	247	” “
55777	55783	55775	55775	Nan	171	” silenced the old lady ; “
55825	55826	55821	55823	school board managers	1755	” “
55835	55842	55829	55829	you	1744	” persisted Anne , addressing Hamlin , “
55879	55880	55870	55870	you	1744	” “
55888	55894	55885	55886	Miss Brown	171	” cried Hamlin , peevishly . “
55906	55911	55902	55902	you	1744	” insisted Mrs Macgregor . “
55947	55957	55924	55924	he	178	” Anne looked in amazement ; and Hamlin reddened . “
55974	55978	55960	55960	you	1744	” he said ; “
56051	56092	56044	56044	I	0	” Miss Brown scarcely knew what to say or feel : there was in her a moment ’s humiliation at being so completely Hamlin ’s property as to warrant this ; then she felt grateful and ashamed of her ingratitude . “
56112	56116	56094	56094	you	0	” she said . “
56139	56140	56117	56117	I	0	” “
56144	56168	56117	56117	I	0	” answered Anne , thinking of all the dresses for Miss Curzon and the little Perrys which she had made in her day . “
56179	56180	56176	56177	Mr Hamlin	145	” “
56195	56207	56208	56208	I	0	” exclaimed Mrs Macgregor when her nephew was out of hearing . “
56231	56232	56223	56223	he	145	” “
56238	56460	56233	56233	I	0	” said Anne , sighing as she stooped over her book , and feeling all the same that she wished Hamlin would let her make up her dresses herself . A few days later the dressmaker came to try on the dress , or rather ( perhaps because Hamlin did not wish Anne to see it before it was finished ) its linings and a small amount of the Greek stuff of which it was made ; but it was not till the very afternoon of Mrs Argiropoulo ’s party that the costume was brought home finished . Miss Brown was by this time tolerably accustomed to the eccentric garb of æsthetic circles , and she firmly believed that it was the only one which a self‐respecting woman might wear ; but when she saw the dress which Hamlin had designed for her , she could not help shrinking back in dismay . It was of that Cretan silk , not much thicker than muslin , which is woven in minute wrinkles of palest yellowy white ; it was made , it seemed to her , more like a night‐gown than anything else , shapeless and yet clinging with large and small folds , and creases like those of damp sculptor ’s drapery , or the garments of Mantegna ’s women . “
56469	56475	56461	56461	I	0	” said Anne , appalled . “
56483	56488	56479	56479	ma’am	1585	” cried the dressmaker . “
56528	56529	56530	56530	I	0	” “
56537	56544	56530	56530	I	0	” cried Miss Brown , resolutely . “
56563	56564	56559	56559	I	0	” “
56571	56631	56566	56566	you	1585	” answered the woman , and continued adjusting the limp garment with the maid ’s assistance . Anne walked to the mirror . She was almost terrified at the figure which met her . That colossal woman , with wrinkled drapery clinging to her in half‐antique , half‐medieval guise,—that great solemn , theatrical creature , could that be herself ? “
56635	56641	56632	56632	I	0	” she said in despair , “
56670	56671	56661	56661	you	289	” “
56677	56687	56675	56675	madam	4383	” answered the dressmaker , ruffled in her dignity . “
56697	56705	56709	56709	I	0	” she added , with crushing effect , “
56733	56755	56722	56722	I	0	” The Lyceum ! Anne felt half petrified . What ! Hamlin was having her rigged out by a stage dressmaker ! “
56764	56783	56784	56784	He	145	” hesitated the maid , as Anne bade her help her out of this mass of limp stuff . “
56804	56805	56786	56786	he	145	” “
56819	56832	56806	56806	Watty	178	” said Mrs Macgregor , putting her head in at the door . “
56836	56870	56806	56806	Watty	178	” Anne followed down‐stairs , gathering all that uncanny white crape about her . For the first time she felt a dull anger against Hamlin . He met her in the dim drawing‐room . “
56878	56892	56871	56871	My	0	” was all Miss Brown could say , tousling it with her hands . “
56906	56910	56911	56911	you	171	” exclaimed Hamlin ; “
56915	56933	56911	56911	you	171	how”—and he paused and looked at her , where she stood before him , stooping her massive head sullenly—“you
56944	56971	56942	56942	Anne	171	” It was the first time he had called her by her Christian name since that scene , long ago , in the studio at Florence . “
56979	56983	56973	56973	me	0	” he apologised . “
57009	57010	56999	56999	me	0	” “
57024	57028	57016	57016	you	171	” said Anne , “
57050	57068	57040	57040	I	0	” Hamlin kissed her hand . He was more than usually handsome , and looked very happy . “
57072	57076	57040	57040	I	0	” he said ; “
57117	57325	57105	57106	Edith Spencer	286	” He looked at her with a kind of fervour , and left the room . Anne sat down . Why did that dress make such a difference to him ? Why did he care so much more for her because she had it on ? Did he care for her only as a sort of live picture ? she thought bitterly . But , after all , it was quite natural on his part to be pleased , since he had invented the dress . And it was very good of him to have thought of her at all . And thus , in a state of enjoyable repentance , she awaited the hour to go to Mrs Argiropoulo . Mrs Spencer , a very lovable and laughable little woman , whose soul was divided between her babies and fierce rancours against all enemies of pre‐Raphaelitism , hereditary , in virtue of her father , Andrew Saunders , in her family , came punctually , marvellously attired in grey cashmere medieval garments , a garland of parsley and gilt oak‐leaves in her handsome red hair . On seeing Anne , who stood awaiting her by the fireplace , she could not repress an exclamation of admiration . “
57328	57344	57105	57106	Edith Spencer	286	” answered Anne , unaccustomed to have her looks admired at Florence and at Coblenz ; “
57376	57377	57374	57374	you	0	” “
57388	57411	57387	57387	Walter	145	” ( she always spoke of him thus familiarly , because he had worked as a youth in her father ’s studio ) “
57425	57431	57387	57387	Walter	145	” Anne shook her head . “
57435	57446	57387	57387	Walter	145	” she answered , with a sort of reasoned conviction , “
57474	57475	57476	57476	You	0	” “
57518	57519	57507	57507	I	0	” “
57526	57532	57522	57522	you	0	” said Anne , quietly . “
57556	57664	57665	57665	I	0	” MISS BROWN felt very excited as the brougham drew up at Mrs Argiropoulo ’s , and they entered her large house , blazing with lights and crammed with flowers . She followed Mrs Spencer timidly up‐stairs ; but the men who crowded the landing never guessed that this majestic and imperturbable creature could possibly be nervous . At the top of the stairs , receiving her guests , an occupation ( called seeing a few friends ) which excluded her from her own drawing‐room the best part of the evening , was Mrs Argiropoulo , gorgeous in old lace and diamonds , and withal excessively vulgar . “
57677	57695	57665	57665	I	0	” she exclaimed to Anne ’s astonishment , despatching the other comers with a mere frigid handshake . “
57708	57709	57710	57710	I	0	” “
57715	57716	57710	57710	I	0	” “
57723	57731	57717	57717	You	0	” went on the fat Greek lady . “
57767	57800	57764	57764	I	0	pardon”—this last remark was addressed to a compact crowd of ladies and gentlemen on the threshold of the largest reception‐room , into which the lady of the house summarily elbowed her way . “
57804	57836	57764	57764	I	0	” she whispered , as Anne , bewildered among the lights and noise , tried to pick her way over the trailing skirts , and every one turned to stare as she passed—“Here
57838	57847	57764	57764	I	0	Euphrosyne”—perceiving one of her big bouncing daughters in the crowd—“I
57871	57907	57864	57867	the Duchess of Orkney	1775	” The spacious drawing‐room was filled , as for a theatrical performance , with rows of chairs , wellnigh occupied already . Into the very first of these Mrs Argiropoulo led Anne and Mrs Spencer . “
57911	57915	57916	57916	I	0	” she whispered . “
57945	57953	57939	57943	the dear Marchioness of Epsom	1776	goodbye”—and she whirled off her portly person . “
57956	57961	57962	57963	old Argey	292	” whispered Mrs Spencer , “
57973	58082	57962	57963	old Argey	292	” Anne looked round . In front was a vacant space , with an open piano , and some chairs in a corner facing the company . All round and behind were chairs , and only a little gangway remained leading to the piano , next to where Mrs Argiropoulo had placed Anne . She had never seen such a crowd of magnificently and oddly dressed people in her life . Old ladies in velvet and diamonds , young ones in Worth toilets , or weirdly attired in lank robes and draperies , with garlands of lilies or turbans , or strings of sequins in their disorderly locks . “
58090	58103	57962	57963	old Argey	292	” said Mrs Spencer , looking round like a rapid little bird , “
58231	58278	58225	58225	you	1789	” Mr O’Reilly , a callow critic who united æstheticism with frivolity , bowed , and cast curious glances at Anne . For a moment she felt horribly ungrateful about the dress . She was sure that little O’Reilly was thinking that it was a night‐gown . “
58285	58307	58315	58316	Mrs Spencer	288	” asked Mrs Spencer . Mr O’Reilly fixed his eyes on Anne , and answered languidly , with a faint smile — “
58359	58360	58341	58342	No one	3899	” “
58371	58378	58341	58342	No one	3899	” asked Mrs Spencer , laughing . “
58598	58599	58610	58610	they	1802	” “
58603	58607	58610	58610	they	1802	” said Anne ; “
58619	58620	58610	58610	they	1802	” “
58695	58885	58886	58886	Aphrodite	301	” Gosselin had come forward , his opera‐hat in his hand , and begun to recite . It was a very delightful performance , and Anne enjoyed it greatly . Besides , it was a great relief to find that this entertainment was a performance , and not as she had dreaded , a series of introductions and conversations with celebrities . There was a dead silence during Gosselin ’s recitation , except near the door , where people kept pressing in and out . When he had ceased , Anne looked round . She was surprised at the aspect of many of the company . They had evidently not been listening at all , but looking about , straining to see some one in the front rows . In a minute the little gangway leading to the piano was crowded . Posthlethwaite , whom she had met several times before , was elbowing his unwieldy person — a Japanese lily bobbing out of the button‐hole of his ancestral dress‐coat — towards her . He had scarcely begun a description of a picture which he had just seen , representing “
58898	59441	58886	58886	Aphrodite	301	” when Mrs Argiropoulo came up with several gentlemen about her , whom she began rapidly to introduce to Anne : two of them were famous painters ; one a well‐known sculptor ; another was an aristocratic drawing‐room novelist ; the fifth a man of fashion . They all stood in the gangway around Anne ’s chair , while Posthlethwaite , who was not the person to be ousted , propped his elephantine person against the end of the piano , and leaning down his flabby flat‐cheeked face and mop of tow , continued conversing with Miss Brown , regardless of the new‐comers , who exchanged smiles as they listened to him with much more amused attention than they had listened to Gosselin . Anne was very bewildered ; and as she answered the remarks of the party surrounding her , she became aware that the people behind were all looking in her direction — looking , doubtless , at Gosselin and his ladies behind the piano , or at Posthlethwaite . For a moment Anne turned round , wondering whether she should see Hamlin . But instead of Hamlin , her eyes met a face as familiar as his — a dark , rather snub face , with bushy black beard and hair , which emerged high above the heads of a knot of literary and political celebrities . She started imperceptibly , but turned away , and looked towards the piano , where Madame Gauffre had begun to recite , her plump little black figure standing out against the moonlight flooding through the window , in strange contrast to the yellow light of the room , in which dimly loomed the tops of trees and the towers of Westminster . Could it be her cousin Dick ? Anne rarely mistook people ’s faces , and least of all was it possible for her to mistake Richard Brown ’s , though she had not seen him since that morning in Florence . But what should Richard be doing here , in this fashionable party ? It was evidently a mere accidental resemblance , but it brought up a painful train of thought . Anne had once or twice written to her cousin and guardian from school , in a formal cold way , and he had let her know that he had become a partner in the military foundry , and had changed his address . She had got a vague idea that he was now rich . But she had not yet let him know of her arrival in England , and she felt ungrateful and rather ashamed , for , after all , he had always wished her well , and had been her playfellow . If he should have thought that she was ashamed of him ? Heaven knows that was not her feeling , but she felt against Richard Brown a vague , instinctive aversion , as to something insulting and degrading to herself . She determined , however , to write to him the very next day . With a shrill exclamation and a pert curtsy , Madame Gauffre , who was reciting the part of a schoolgirl of fifteen , suddenly came to an end . “
59449	59465	59444	59444	you	1815	” said a voice behind her . She turned round . It was Richard Brown . “
59476	59487	59468	59468	you	1815	” he said , calmly pushing aside the astonished Posthlethwaite , “
59530	59576	59526	59526	you	1815	” The voice was always that same deep one , which , when lowered to a whisper , had something curiously hot and passionate about it ; but the accent and the easy worldly manner seemed as if they could not belong to Richard Brown . “
59584	59592	59578	59579	the deuce	4325	” asked Posthlethwaite angrily of Mrs Spencer . “
59636	59637	59604	59604	you	1815	” “
59643	59649	59604	59604	you	1815	” answered the little journalist . “
59662	59663	59660	59660	you	1815	” “
59672	59679	59664	59664	We	1820	” answered Mrs Spencer , seriously . “
59685	59689	59690	59690	I	0	” said Posthlethwaite . “
59723	59728	59705	59705	I	0	” Thaddy O’Reilly laughed . “
59804	59805	59785	59785	he	1824	” “
59828	59847	59822	59822	you	1815	” said Mrs Spencer , simply and seriously . Young O’Reilly went into an inaudible but convulsive giggle . “
59881	59882	59885	59885	he	1824	” “
59893	59897	59885	59885	he	1824	” retorted Posthlethwaite . “
59906	59907	59901	59901	he	1824	” “
59911	59915	59909	59909	Jove	305	” exclaimed O’Reilly , “
59928	59929	59922	59923	Richard Brown,—perhaps	223	” “
59937	59962	59932	59932	you	1834	” whispered Mrs Argiropoulo to the little knot of artists whom she had assembled . Posthlethwaite , as usual , answered for the company . “
59981	59982	59968	59969	a goddess	759	” “
59989	59995	59983	59987	That ’s Hamlin ’s look‐out	1838	” answered Paints , the R.A. “
60004	60009	60002	60002	him	1824	” they all asked . “
60017	60018	60011	60011	he	1824	” “
60029	60033	60036	60036	he	1824	” answered O’Reilly ; “
60069	60070	60065	60065	you	1839	” “
60083	60106	60075	60075	you	256	” cried Mrs Argiropoulo , who was working up and down the crowd . Richard Brown had already given Anne his arm . “
60112	60117	60075	60075	you	256	” cried Mrs Argiropoulo . “
60138	60139	60132	60132	you	256	” “
60144	60149	60142	60142	Annie	171	” whispered Richard Brown . “
60158	60172	60176	60177	Mr Posthlethwaite	256	” And he let his cousin be borne away in triumph by Posthlethwaite . “
60184	60192	60193	60193	he	256	” explained Mrs Argiropoulo to Mrs Spencer ; “
60238	60239	60231	60231	they	1843	” “
60252	60259	60240	60241	Walter Hamlin	145	” answered Mrs Spencer , fiercely ; “
60295	60374	60276	60277	Mr Bones	308	” As Anne passed through the crowd on Posthlethwaite ’s arm every one turned to look at her . And then it suddenly flashed upon her that she was the person people had been staring at , she was the lion of the evening — she , the servant whom the great poet‐painter had adopted . Every one was looking at her ; she felt horribly alone , numb , unreal . At that moment Hamlin came up . “
60380	60384	60378	60378	yourself	171	” he asked . “
60397	60398	60276	60277	Mr Bones	308	” “
60413	60428	60408	60408	you	171	” Anne ’s voice was so wretched and supplicating that Hamlin felt quite terrified . “
60434	60438	60431	60432	Mrs Spencer	288	” he asked . “
60460	60461	60446	60446	Edith	286	” “
60469	60478	60463	60463	me	0	” said the mellifluous fat voice of Posthlethwaite . “
60493	60504	60488	60488	you	171	” and Hamlin pushed the prince of æsthetes roughly aside . “
60515	60530	60507	60507	you	171	” asked Anne feebly , while he was helping her on with her cloak . “
60546	60583	60535	60535	I	0	” answered Hamlin in a whisper . When the two women were alone in the brougham , Anne could stand it no longer ; and leaning her head in the corner , she began to cry . “
60593	60604	60591	60591	Annie	171	” cried Mrs Spencer , drawing her close to her . “
60614	60615	60591	60591	Annie	171	” “
60620	60628	60591	60591	Annie	171	” answered Anne , wiping her eyes . “
60641	60642	60634	60634	I	0	” “
60651	60663	60591	60591	Annie	171	” replied the little woman , half in consolation , half in pride—“mere
60786	62272	62282	62283	Mr Chough”—he	318	” THE sudden discovery that she was the standard beauty of the most prominent artistic set , and accepted as such by the rest of society , would have greatly disturbed almost any woman . But Anne Brown ’s nature was too completely homogeneous — too completely without the innumerable strata , and abysses , and peaks , and winding ways of modern women ’s characters — for her to experience any of the mixed feelings of pride , and disgust , and humiliation , and general uncomfortablehess which would have been the lot of a more complex nature . The atoms of her character were not easily shaken into new patterns : it was coherent , and , like most coherent things , difficult to upset , slow to move , and quick to settle down . After the first shock of surprise , she resigned herself , without doubts , or diffidence , or elation , to her new place . That she was more beautiful than other women had indeed never occurred to her before ; but once that it had been proved to her she accepted it as a fact , as she had accepted as a fact the still stranger news that Hamlin had singled her out to change her life and love her . She did not take it at all as a merit or any other exciting thing in herself : the only effect which it had upon her was to strengthen a curious feeling , constitutional in her , and resulting probably from the very coherence and weightiness of her character , that she was fated to be or do something different from other women — a sort of sense of tragic passiveness , which always formed the background of her happiness . Moreover , the discovery which she had made at Mrs Argiropoulo ’s somehow made Anne ’s position more intelligible and simple to herself . She had heard of other men who had educated and married girls of the lower orders on account of their beauty . Hamlin ’s behaviour was now no longer a mystery to her ; and the absence of mystery served merely , to Anne ’s quite unromantic , practically passionate , half‐southern temper , to make Hamlin ’s nobleness and goodness more obvious to her . She had the curious Italian capacity for feeling an ideal passion — a passion which was merely a sublimated form of friendship and admiration — for a real personality ; and her instinctive desire was merely to get nearer that real personality . But much as she tried , the reality of Hamlin seemed to escape and baffle her : he was a complex man , and she a homogeneous woman ; and as she could not see Hamlin well in detail , she loved him in the very simple and broad outlines which she was able to comprehend . Now that she had settled down in æsthetic society , and found her place , and got to understand the main points of things , she was quite ideally happy . Her life was very full , and was surrounded by a flood of love,—on her side or on Hamlin ’s ? She scarcely knew ; but she knew that she was happy . By this time the round of sight‐seeing , play‐going , excursions , and introductions , was over ; her life had subsided into the normal . Its object , she felt , as one feels a wholesome and agreeable desire for food or sleep , was to make herself as worthy as possible of Hamlin , or rather to let him find in her the best possible bargain . She worked very hard at all the things which the school had left incomplete,—at what , living in that æsthetic society , seemed to her the solid requisites of life . She read history and biography and poetry , with the determination with which other girls , anticipating marriage , might study manuals of domestic economy ; and she worked at developing her taste in art and music as others might have practised cooking or dressmaking ; for these were the things which would be requisite in Hamlin ’s spiritual household . The people around her , the men and women of Hamlin ’s set , seemed to her as necessary , as inevitable , as normal as the trees and houses all round . Some of them she liked , and some she disliked ; but their ideas , though sometimes absurd caricatures , and their tempers , though often intolerable , seemed to Anne quite natural and proper in the main , though rendered ridiculous or disagreeable in individuals . Indeed she got rather to believe in imperfect individuals,—being thus constantly either made cross by the touchiness , the morbidness , the disgusting fleshliness , the intolerance of the æsthetes around her , or made to laugh by their affectations , their vanity , their inconsistency , their grotesque manias of wickedness and mysticism — while unable to judge or condemn the general , intellectual , and moral condition of which these individual excrescences were the result . Some of the people were distinctly repulsive , or distinctly boring , or distinctly annoying to her ; others , like Mrs Spencer and her father and mother and sisters , decidedly lovable ; others , like little Chough , decidedly amusing and amiable : and she took them as they came , but with the indifference of concentrated feeling ; for what did it matter whether she cared for them , or they cared for her , as long as she was doing her best to deserve Hamlin ? Meanwhile Anne Brown read quantities of medieval and Elizabethan literature ; went with Hamlin to see pictures and hear music ; studied Dante and Shakespeare — the algebra and arithmetic , so to speak , of the æsthetic set — and even began , secretly , to work at a Greek grammar . Twice a‐week Cosmo Chough came to practise her accompaniments with her ; and twice a‐week also , of an evening , friends dropped in at the house at Hammersmith , when Mrs Macgregor would leave her nephew and niece , as she called her , to entertain the guests . On other evenings Anne would usually go to the house of one of the set , where literature and art , and the faults of friends , and the wrong‐headedness of the public , were largely discussed ; music was made , young long‐haired Germans on the loose performing ; and poets , especially the inexhaustible Chough , would recite their compositions , perched on the arms of sofas , or stretched on the hearth‐rug ; while the ladies went to sleep , or pretended to do so , over the descriptions of the kisses of cruel , blossom‐mouthed women , who sucked out their lovers ’ hearts , bit their lips , and strewed their apartments with coral‐like drops of blood . Most of these poets , as Anne speedily discovered , were young men of harmless lives , and altogether unacquainted with the beautiful , baleful ladies they represented as sucking at their vitals ; and none was more utterly harmless than Cosmo Chough . Instead of the terrible Faustinas , Messalinas , and Lucretia Borgias to whom his poems were addressed , the poor little man had in his miserable home in the north of London a wife older than himself , often bedridden and always half crazy , who turned the house in a sort of disorderly litter , neglected her children , and vented on her husband the most jealous and perverse temper ; but the victim of Venus , as he styled himself , nursed her with absolute devotion , denied himself every gratification to allow her a servant and send his children to school , and made all new‐comers believe that Mrs Cosmo Chough was the most angelic invalid that the world had ever seen . People in the set had got accustomed to this fact , and treated Chough merely as an amusing little caricature of genius ; but when Anne understood the real state of the case , she was deeply touched , and possessed with a violent desire to help the little man . He could not , indeed , restrain his habit of alluding in pompous language to Phryne , Pasiphaë , La Belle Heaulmière , Madame du Barry , and all the most celebrated improprieties of all times and nations ; nor from discussing the most striking literary obscenities , from Petronius to Walt Whitman . But although at first surprised ( as every one was surprised and indeed shocked ) by Anne ’s unblushing and quietly resolute—“I
62283	62450	62451	62451	You	1860	Chough”—he became quite devoted to Anne . When he gave a set of lectures , in Mrs Spencer ’s house , on what was nominally Elizabethan drama , but virtually the unmentionable play of Ford , and the ladies dropped off one by one and merely laughed at poor Cosmo ’s eccentricities , Anne had the courage to sit out the performance , and to tell Chough openly that he ought to be ashamed of himself for holding forth on such subjects — a proceeding which made Hamlin ’s friends blame Miss Brown for want of womanly feeling and prudishness alike ; and which put Hamlin just a little out of temper , until she answered his unspoken censure by remarking , with a sort of Italian bluntness and seriousness , that a woman of her age had no business not to understand the real meaning of such things , and understanding them , not to let the poets know that she would not tolerate them . “
62461	62466	62467	62467	I	0	” explained Mrs Spencer . “
62484	62485	62486	62486	They	1861	” “
62493	62499	62486	62486	They	1861	” answered Anne , sceptically , “
62510	62587	62588	62588	You	1860	” To return to Chough . Anne gradually became the confidant of the domestic difficulties , though not of the domestic shame , of the little poet ; and to every one ’s great astonishment , she obtained Hamlin ’s permission to have one of Chough ’s little girls at Hammersmith every Saturday till Monday , and tried to instil into the miserable puny imps some notion of how to behave and how to amuse themselves . “
62605	62619	62622	62622	I	0	” asked Hamlin , the first Sunday that Maggy Chough spent at Hammersmith . “
62625	62629	62622	62622	I	0	” answered Anne . “
62683	62935	62936	62936	He	1871	” Hamlin smiled ; and next day made a crayon drawing of Anne , one of the dozens in his studio , with Chough ’s child ; but he managed to make Anne look mournfully mysterious , and the child haggard and wild , so that people thought it represented Medea and one of the children of Jason . So far Anne ’s acquaintance were entirely limited to the æsthetic set ; but there were two exceptions . One was a couple of sisters , Mary and Marjory Leigh , who existed as it were on the borderland — Mary Leigh being a sort of amateur painter with strong literary proclivities ; the other was Richard Brown , who , after the meeting at Mrs Argiropoulo ’s , called at Hammersmith , was politely received by Hamlin , with whom he appeared quite reconciled , and talked on a variety of indifferent subjects , as if Anne Brown had never been his ward . Hamlin had apparently never appeared to him in the light of a slave‐buyer and seducer , and all parties had apparently never been in any save their present position . Anne asked her cousin to one or two of their evenings : he came , seemed to know one or two people slightly , and although professing profound ignorance of art , managed to interest one or two of the æsthetic brotherhood by developing his views on the necessity of extending artistic training to the lower classes . “
62950	62956	62941	62943	a stupid man	1872	” remarked little Mrs Spencer ; “
62976	62977	62961	62961	he	1871	” “
63002	63019	63000	63000	Edith	286	” cried her father , the veteran painter in tempera , who was a fearful punster . “
63061	63062	63054	63055	Mr Morris	326	” “
63093	63097	63098	63098	I	0	” said Hamlin . “
63105	63106	63112	63112	Watty	178	” “
63128	63135	63120	63120	you	0	” said Mrs Spencer , hotly . “
63155	63825	63153	63153	reformers	1884	” At any rate , Richard Brown was permitted to show himself sometimes in æsthetic company . But Richard Brown did not avail himself much of the condescending permission to improve his mind ; and neither at her own house ( for people always spoke of Miss Brown ’s house now ) nor at the houses of any of her friends would Anne have had much opportunity of seeing her cousin , had he not , by a curious chance , been a frequent visitor at the house of the Leigh girls . Mary Leigh was , as already said , a demi‐semi‐æsthete ; she had studied art in an irregular , Irish sort of way , and she had a literary , romantic kind of imagination , which fitted her rather for an illustrator than a painter . She felt the incompleteness of her own endowment , in a gentle , half‐humorous , half‐sad way ; and the incompleteness of her own life — for her ideal of happiness was to travel about , to live in Italy , and this she had cheerfully sacrificed to please her sister , whose only interests in life were school boards , and depauperisation , and ( it must be admitted ) a mild amount of flirtation with young men of scientific and humanitarian tendencies . Between the sisters there was perfect love , but not perfect understanding ; and Mary Leigh , who felt a little lonely , a little shut into herself by her younger sister , who was at once a philosopher and a baby in her eyes , vented her imaginative and artistic cravings in a passionate admiration for Hamlin ’s strange and beautiful ward or fiancée , a kind of intellectual fervour which Anne was as remarkable for inspiring as she seemed unable to inspire either ordinary liking or ordinary love : and as Mary Leigh likewise adored Hamlin , and Hamlin in return thought Mary Leigh a nice sort of girl , Anne Brown did what visiting and sight‐seeing and shopping was left to her almost always in Mary Leigh ’s company . Now , if Anne was the idol of the æsthetic Mary , the humanitarian and practical younger sister , who , with the cut‐and‐dry decision of a philosopher of twenty‐two , looked upon æsthetics and æsthetes as somewhat pestilent in nature , had her idol also in a very different person , and this was no other than Richard Brown , to be whose lieutenant in some of his philanthropical and educational schemes was Marjory ’s highest ambition . Richard Brown had , ever since meeting his cousin at Mrs Argiropoulo ’s in the character of an artistic beauty , made up his mind that Anne was no concern of his , and was luckily disposed of in the æsthetic set ; and for some time he almost took a pleasure in making her understand , whenever he met her at the Leighs ’ house in Chelsea , that he did not in the least expect her to take an interest , or pretend to take an interest , in the plans which he discussed with Marjory Leigh . Anne on the other hand , imbued with Hamlin ’s and Chough ’s theory that all attempts at improving the world result merely in failure , and that the only wise occupation of a noble mind is to make for itself a paradise of beautiful thoughts and forms and emotions , was extremely sceptical of her cousin ’s and Marjory ’s schemes , and once or twice declared her disbelief with perfect openness . Richard Brown was at first annoyed , then amused , then indignant ; and then , seeing how completely Anne ’s ideas were borrowed from her set , and also how completely unsuitable they were to her downright , serious , and practical nature , he determined , not without vanity playing a part as well as conviction , to “
63831	64169	63153	63153	reformers	1884	” as he expressed it , into her mind . There had been recently founded , by some friends of his , a kind of club where girls of the dressmaker ’s apprentice and shopwomen class might spend their leisure moments in reading and meeting each other ; which club , besides a library and reading‐room , offered to its members a certain number of classes or sets of lectures on various subjects , delivered at a nominal price , after work hours . The lecturers or teachers were nearly all young ladies : Marjory Leigh had for some time lectured on sanitary arrangements ( this being her especial hobby ) , and Mary Leigh was going to set up a drawing‐class . Anne Brown , practical by nature and æsthetically sceptical by training , had no very great belief in the famous club ; she had been told so often that mankind is too stupid and degraded to be helped , that she had almost got to believe it . But she let herself be taken one evening to a lecture , at what she called Marjory ’s college . The lecture was just beginning as they entered the little , white‐washed , bare room up innumerable stairs . Four or five young women , decently dressed , were seated at desks , copy‐books and ink‐stands before them ; and a beautiful little girl , who had been pointed out to Anne in æsthetic circles as a rising poetess , was seated opposite them at the end of a table . The Leighs and Anne sat down silently near the door , and the lecture began . It was on modern history . The pupils listened with the greatest attention , their pens flying on their copy‐books . The lecturer , a small , graceful , extremely frail little creature , began in a somewhat tremulous voice ; then gradually , as she got more excited , became more voluble , excited , and absolutely eloquent . “
64178	64182	64170	64170	She	1885	” whispered Marjory , “
64189	64590	64184	64184	she	1885	” Anne listened . But she did not follow the lecturer ’s argument very closely . She thought what these girls were , what the drudgery of their work , the temptations of their leisure , the hopeless narrowness of their horizon ; and she thought also , the thought throbbing on almost like dull pain , what it would have been for her , when she also was alone in the world — when she had drudgery on the one hand and temptation on the other — when her whole nature had been parched and withered for want of a few words that should speak of higher and nobler things,—had she been permitted , once a‐week , to come to such a place , to hear about such subjects , to be spoken to by such an earnest and enthusiastic and exquisite creature as this . At the end of the lecture the girls crowded shyly round the lecturer , some to beg her to explain a point , others to ask for books on the subject , all of them to thank with pathetic earnestness . Then they went away , and the Leigh girls came forward to the lecturer . From where she sat she could not see the new‐comers ; and she was astonished , and in a way awe‐stricken , on seeing Anne Brown , the exotic beauty of whom she had heard so much , whose portrait she had seen in so many studios , and to whom she had been introduced almost in fear and trembling , for Anne had a kind of awe‐inspiring fascination for imaginative people . Anne , on the other hand , was silent and depressed , and the little poetess must have made up her mind that this magnificent and sombre creature was as sullen and lethargic and haughty as one of Michelangelo ’s goddesses . But in reality Miss Brown could have laid her head on one of the desks and cried like a child . When , the following day , Mary Leigh came to take her out for a walk , Anne looked as if she had received bad news , or as if she had bad news to communicate . She answered only in monosyllables ; until , as they were looking in at a shop window , she suddenly turned to her companion . “
64595	64600	64592	64592	you	1886	” she said hesitatingly , “
64613	64614	64592	64592	you	1886	” “
64617	64624	64625	64625	you	1886	” exclaimed Mary Leigh in astonishment ; “
64638	64646	64632	64632	you	1886	” Anne was silent . She sighed . “
64711	64718	64709	64709	I	0	” Mary Leigh squeezed her hand . “
64725	64729	64719	64719	We	1890	” she said . “
64742	64746	64747	64747	he	229	” answered Anne ; “
64765	64766	64758	64758	he	229	” “
64772	64783	64758	64758	he	229	” replied the enthusiastic Irish girl looking at her companion . “
64820	64824	64813	64813	Mozart	331	” Anne sighed . “
64833	64837	64813	64813	Mozart	331	” she answered . “
64852	64875	64876	64876	I	0	” The other Miss Leigh was immensely astonished , and , with her youthful intolerance , rather indignant at Anne ’s suggestion . “
64879	64885	64876	64876	I	0	” said Anne , hesitatingly , “
64904	64910	64887	64887	I	0	” Marjory shook her head . “
64922	64926	64887	64887	I	0	” she said . “
64975	64976	64971	64973	Frau von Hillern	335	” “
64981	65010	64971	64973	Frau von Hillern	335	” Anne said sadly . Marjory was rather sorry for her rough practicalness , but at the same time she had a blind impulse to harass an æsthete . “
65019	65038	64971	64973	Frau von Hillern	335	” she said ; and , as the door opened and Richard Brown entered , she went on — “
65058	65059	65055	65056	Mr Brown	223	” “
65062	65066	65055	65056	Mr Brown	223	” answered Richard . “
65082	65083	65074	65074	you	223	” “
65116	65117	65118	65118	You	223	” “
65125	65151	65152	65152	You	223	” cried Brown , and his face assumed that look of somewhat brutal contempt hidden under suavity of manner , which Anne hated so much . “
65169	65170	65171	65171	I	0	” “
65178	65184	65176	65176	Dick	229	” answered Anne , sternly ; “
65201	65213	65214	65215	Mr Hamlin	145	” ( and she looked her cousin reproachfully in the face ) “
65266	65267	65270	65270	you	229	” “
65272	65276	65270	65270	you	229	” cried Brown . “
65311	65312	65313	65313	I	0	” “
65324	65330	65322	65322	Dick	229	” answered Anne , simply . “
65354	65355	65347	65347	you	229	” “
65358	65378	65381	65381	you	229	” said Brown , evidently surprised at her manner , and looking searchingly in her pale , strange‐featured face , “
65385	65391	65381	65381	you	229	teach?”—his voice was much gentler . “
65393	65405	65381	65381	you	229	present”—Anne ’s voice sank , for she felt the uselessness of her offer—“I
65412	65418	65381	65381	you	229	” ( Brown smiled ) ; “
65434	65435	65428	65428	I	0	” “
65451	65458	65436	65436	I	0	” interrupted Marjory Leigh , impatiently . “
65477	65478	65466	65467	the secretary	1907	” “
65486	65490	65479	65479	I	0	” mused Brown . “
65504	65505	65506	65506	I	0	” “
65513	65531	65506	65506	I	0	” said Anne , haughtily . Why was she always having her æstheticism thrust in her face ? “
65534	65539	65506	65506	I	0	” added her cousin , “
65545	65563	65506	65506	I	0	” They fell to talking of other things . As Brown was leaving , Anne stopped him . “
65567	65571	65506	65506	I	0	” she said , “
65583	65587	65506	65506	I	0	” Brown smiled . “
65597	65598	65591	65591	you	0	” “
65607	65613	65614	65614	I	0	” answered Anne , gravely , “
65623	65624	65616	65616	I	0	” “
65632	65633	65630	65630	Annie	171	” “
65661	65671	65654	65654	you	0	” Brown looked at her with a puzzled expression . “
65681	65683	65654	65654	you	0	” he said—“I
65718	65719	65721	65721	you	0	” “
65733	65734	65725	65725	I	0	” “
65755	65763	65764	65764	You	171	” He laughed , and went away . “
65771	65786	65764	65764	You	171	” remarked Marjory , shaking her short mane of hair out before the glass ; “
65799	66165	66166	66166	They	1909	” WHEN Mrs Macgregor had gone up‐stairs to rest before dinner on their arrival at Wotton Hall , Hamlin took Miss Brown round the huge , deserted‐looking house , which his grandfather had built on returning from Jamaica . It was like an Italian villa , with vaulted rooms , gilded and stuccoed , marble floors , and terraced windows ; the furniture was all of the Napoleonic period ; nothing could be more dignified or sadder . When Hamlin had shown her the large drawing‐rooms , the library , the room which had been the play‐room when he was a child , he took Anne into the large Palladian hall , and showed her the innumerable portraits of ladies and gentlemen in armour , and ruffs , and bobwigs , and powder , hanging all round — his ancestors ever since his family had left England in the civil wars . Anne looked at them shyly . They were mostly indifferently painted and vapid — affected , like all old portraits by mediocre painters ; but it seemed to her that in most of these gentlemen , with peaked beards on their Vandyck lace , or horse‐hair wigs , or carefully powdered hair tied back in silk bags , she could recognise a resemblance to the man by her side — the same delicate , handsome features , the same fair , almost beardless complexion , the same gentle , melancholy , slightly ironical expression : and never did the real meaning of Hamlin ’s marriage with her come clearer before her mind than when , in that silent hall , surrounded by all those portraits of his ancestors , she suddenly saw herself and him reflected in one of the long dim mirrors ; she , so tall and strong , so powerful of bone and muscle , with her strange , half‐southern , half‐Jewish , and almost half‐Ethiopian beauty , by the side of that slight , fair , pale , aristocratic man , with features sharp like those of a high‐bred race‐horse , nervous and wistful and dreamy , as if he were tired of his family having lasted so long . “
66176	66180	66166	66166	They	1909	” said Hamlin , “
66517	66518	66510	66510	you	1936	” “
66521	66600	66510	66510	you	1936	” said Anne , laughing , as she looked at Hamlin , at that noble and delicate face , which seemed to her the noblest and most beautiful in the world ; and yet , when she looked at Mordaunt Hamlin again , with his morbid woman ’s face and his effeminate bare throat , she could not help feeling a certain disgust at the thought that perhaps — perhaps — Hamlin was just a little like him . “
66606	66624	66603	66604	my mother	3900	” said Hamlin , pointing to a faded crayon of a beautiful , gentle , pathetic‐looking woman . “
66630	66636	66628	66628	you	0	” cried Anne , delighted . “
66662	66663	66647	66647	I	0	” “
66692	66693	66697	66697	her	3900	” “
66699	66700	66695	66695	you	0	” “
66748	66761	66746	66746	papa	3893	” and Hamlin stopped before the full‐length of a handsome effeminate man . “
66777	66781	66775	66775	you	0	” he said . “
66784	66855	66775	66775	you	0	” answered Anne , looking at that weak , worn , rather blear face , and thinking how her father , too , had been a drunkard ; but how different had been the drunkenness of the poor overworked mechanic , so industrious and gentle and high‐spirited when he was sober , from the sort of emasculating vice of Mordaunt and Arnold Hamlin , of Walter Hamlin ’s bad‐faced father ! “
66861	66876	66919	66920	the mother	1950	” pursued Hamlin , with a sort of psychological interest in his own family , “
66957	66958	66959	66959	I	0	” “
66972	66976	66963	66963	you	1947	” said Anne . “
67018	67075	67012	67012	I	0	” Anne stopped to look at the picture . It was very well painted , though a trifle old‐fashioned . The two boys were represented in shooting‐jackets , with guns and dogs . The shorter , slighter , and paler boy was evidently Walter Hamlin ; the other was more robust , boyish , and ordinary‐looking . “
67089	67090	67086	67086	he	4292	” “
67094	67100	67086	67086	he	4292	” answered Hamlin , quickly . “
67134	67184	67124	67124	he	341	” It seemed to Anne that Hamlin was going to say something different from what he had said . What had become of Arnold Hamlin ? Mrs Macgregor ’s allusions to him , who had evidently been her favourite nephew , always seemed to point to a melancholy end . “
67189	67197	67124	67124	he	341	” said Hamlin , after a moment . “
67225	67226	67223	67223	Mordaunt	144	” “
67237	67288	67229	67229	you	1960	” said Anne , trying to break through Hamlin ’s strange mood . They left the hall , and went to the window of the large drawing‐room , and looked out on the reddening beeches and the grass , permitted to grow high and thick , in the yellow sunlight . “
67298	67302	67289	67289	I	0	” said Hamlin ; “
67369	67375	67354	67354	I	0	” Anne did not answer . “
67381	67395	67376	67376	I	0	” went on Hamlin , leaning on the window‐sill by Anne ’s side , “
67447	67464	67465	67465	I	0	” and he looked up at Anne , who was leaning against the tall French window . “
67470	67485	67465	67465	I	0	” went on Hamlin , again looking out at the vaporous yellow sunset horizon — “
67556	67635	67640	67640	I	0	” He looked at Anne ; she had turned an ashy‐white as she listened ; she had thought that Hamlin loved her , and now . . . He noticed it , and understood , but pretended not to understand ; he enjoyed playing upon a living soul , all the more upon a soul like this one , slow to respond to his touch , with low and long‐sustained vibrations , like those of some deep‐toned instrument . “
67646	67685	67640	67640	I	0	” he went on , conscious to himself that he was speaking the truth , and at the same time that he was acting , telling it at a moment and in a manner which made it untruthful ; “
67757	67763	67764	67764	I	0	” Anne shook her head . “
67770	67775	67764	67764	I	0	” Hamlin smiled sadly . “
67841	67980	67981	67981	I	0	” Hamlin had often said things like these in the letters which he used to write to her , and had hinted , much more clearly , at weaknesses and basenesses which she would some day recognise in him . It could not occur to Anne , whose character was so completely of a piece , that there was any untruthfulness in this mode of speaking , any more than she could believe that Hamlin could be correct in thus speaking of himself . The sort of shimmer , as of the two tints in a shot stuff , of reality and unreality , of genuine and affected feeling , of moods which came spontaneously and of other moods , noticed , treasured up , reproduced in himself,—which existed in Hamlin , would be perfectly unintelligible to Anne . “
67984	67989	68033	68033	he	503	” she answered gravely , “
68037	68132	68033	68033	he	503	” A sensation of a new experience passed through Hamlin ’s mind as Anne said this : it seemed so strange , pathetic , grand , to him — who knew himself to be for ever mixing up the unrealities of his art with the realities of his life , to be continually experimenting upon himself the moods of his poetry — that any one should seriously think thus , should not know that when a man recognises in himself a fault , he may , so far from eradicating , cherish it stealthily . “
68159	68163	68142	68142	you	1979	” said Anne ; “
68229	68243	68211	68211	poets	1628	because”—and she looked at him half laughing , half with the tears in her eyes—“you
68316	68348	68349	68349	You	1979	” Hamlin did not answer . He was deeply touched , touched all the more because he knew how little she guessed at the self‐conscious unreality of so much of him . “
68354	68365	68349	68349	You	1979	” he said sadly , then went on more cheerfully : “
68483	68648	68669	68670	Miss Brown	171	” He had taken her hand , and playing with her strong shapely fingers , so much stronger and less delicate , though not less shapely than his own , looked with a kind of solemnity into her face . Anne could not answer , for if she did , she knew she must cry ; she felt the tears , as it were , all through her nature ; she seemed to see , she knew not why , but as a solemn certainty , that things could never go any further , that Hamlin was prophesying the inevitable future : and yet , in the midst of this quite inexplicable , unreasonable sense of loss and resignation , there was a deep happiness which she had never before felt , the happiness of the present ; a something new to Anne , though all other lovers have felt the happiness of possession of one another , even at the moment of loss . “
68654	68663	68669	68670	Miss Brown	171	” said Hamlin , and shut the window . “
68684	68715	68673	68673	you	1985	” His voice seemed like the curtain dropping after a scene , or the chord at the end of a duet . It was a return to reality and prose . “
68737	69368	69369	69369	I	0	” Hamlin strolled out into the terrace , and lit a cigarette ; the past and present , his real and unreal self , Anne , his brother and father , his great‐uncle Mordaunt — all went cloudily through his brain . He was very happy . Love to him was not what it was to other men , not what he had tried it himself in former years . It was romance , but romance not of ladders and hairbreadth escapes , but of psychical conditions , of spiritual sensations . He had written fleshly poetry and passionate poetry , but no one could be less fleshly or less passionate than Hamlin : the ‘ Vita Nuova’—if it could be made modern , and the parts altered and reversed — unreal reality of love , had been his ideal , and he had got it . They had many conversations like this one . Hamlin never so much as kissed Anne ’s hand , never told her that he loved her , spoke merely of himself , of her , of the future and the past , of what she would one day know , of what he would one day feel ; and Anne listened seriously , trying to cure him of his despondency and morbidness , trying to persuade him of his own worth and of her clear‐sightedness , while never a suspicion crossed her simple stern mind that all this earnest talk , which was so tragic and still so delightful , was the thing which she scornfully connected with whispers and kisses and nonsense,—in one word , love‐making . THEY remained about a fortnight completely solitary in the large house . Hamlin was finishing a poem and correcting the proofs of his next volume . Anne was continuing her usual literary studies , but now with the addition of some books and pamphlets on political economy , which had been incredulously lent her by Richard Brown . The two young people had never seen so much of one another , and they were , Hamlin in his dreamy manner , Anne in her serious , practical way , very happy . Mrs Macgregor went on reading her old‐fashioned freethinking books , and giving out cynical remarks , which her amiable and utterly gullible character deprived of all weight . She was the elder and considerably older sister of Hamlin ’s mother , and had lived in the house for many years as a widow . She had been twice married , each time for love , and each time to men who , if one might trust her nephew , had been immediately reduced by her into the most devoted and timid slaves ; yet she always spoke of marriage as if every misfortune of her existence was due to it . Imbued with the pseudo‐scientific and somewhat anti‐social philosophy of early deism ( though herself a rigid stickler for decorum ) , Mrs Macgregor had a way of talking of love and marriage which for some time had made poor Anne profoundly miserable : men and women , averred the old lady , were , whatever they might pretend to the contrary , entirely at the mercy of their animal passions,—to suppose that any one successfully resisted them was sheer folly ; marry people must , but marriage was the most unfortunate of all necessities , the beginning of all unhappiness , the end of all independence , self‐respect , and pleasure in life ; it was the long waking up from a disgraceful delusion ; yet this disgraceful delusion , this drunken condition called love , was ( always according to Mrs Macgregor ) the one beautiful and poetical thing in the world . “
69383	69390	69380	69381	Aunt Claudia	247	” Anne would often exclaim indignantly . “
69443	69444	69412	69412	I	0	” “
69451	69460	69412	69412	I	0	” Mrs Macgregor would answer with a smile , “
69477	69478	69412	69412	I	0	” “
69483	69500	69504	69505	Aunt Claudia	247	” answered Anne , feeling quite nauseated and terrified , and at the same time resolute in herself—“if
69527	71107	71110	71110	Walter	145	” Then , when she saw Hamlin , and thought of the noble way in which he had acted towards her , of the calm and clear love and gratitude which she felt towards him,—when she thought of the things which they talked about together , of the desire to become worthier with which his love had inspired her , of the greater trust in his own worthiness which she hoped her love was instilling into him,—nay , when she looked at that thoughtful , delicate , almost diaphanous face of his , Anne ’s anger towards the old lady would turn into mere pity ; she would merely , in her own certainty of worthiness , smile at what she now considered as the mere empty talk of a disgusting school of thought , or , at best , as the lamentable generalisations from a horribly exceptional family , such as she understood , vaguely , that of Hamlin ’s father to have been . And , for the rest , Anne believed that though people were very ridiculous , and affected , and mean in little matters ( she was thinking of the Spencers , and the Saunders , and so many other of her æsthetic friends ) , and although they might also , like Cosmo Chough , make the mistake of thinking indecent things interesting and dramatic , the vast majority of mankind and womankind was really very pure , and generous , and loving at bottom . So , after a time , she listened to Mrs Macgregor ’s remarks with only a little habitual and instinctive annoyance , but without any kind of serious belief in them . And when Aunt Claudia would sometimes allude to the bad lives which had been led in this particular house — to the vices ( taking them quite as ordinary matters ) of Hamlin ’s grandfather and father and uncles , of the neglect and violence which her sister , Hamlin ’s mother , had suffered from , hinting that , if one only knew , the self‐same things were happening in every other family on earth,—whenever there came any such allusions , Anne would carefully , as it were , close up these loopholes into a past , in which she scarcely believed and from which she shrank : the world seemed to her as good , and healthy , and strong , and easy to understand as herself . But while she did thus , Anne was so gentle and sympathising to Mrs Macgregor , that the old lady was never hurt by her contradictions ; indeed she would sometimes say that , were she not persuaded that no law of nature can have any real exceptions , she would almost believe that Anne was quite different from any other woman that ever was . It seemed somehow , here all alone in this ancestral home of Hamlin ’s , as if the fate which Hamlin had refused to forestall was working itself happily out ; and as if , tacitly , the poet‐painter and the girl whom he had educated were becoming affianced to each other . None of the outward ceremony was broken through ; he was always Mr Hamlin , and she Miss Brown , and there was never an allusion permitted to any more intimate relations . But it seemed perfectly natural that he and she should go walks together ; that Aunt Claudia should leave them alone at breakfast and luncheon ; and that , when the old lady had retired to her room , they should remain , with brotherly and sisterly ease , though not brotherly and sisterly free‐and‐easiness , talking together of an evening . And as they talked , their plans seemed constantly to merge ; that they should be separated never occurred to either ( except when Hamlin was in one of his tragic moods ) , although not a word passed to settle their future together . The long courtship , the long enjoyment of a ceremonious and unfettered love , was what Hamlin had wished for , and what he had ; to a fixed future , a family and family affections , he was not the man to look forward ; it would have to come , and he did not feel any dislike for it , but he gave it no thought . As to Anne , she had never made up her mind that she had a right to be Hamlin ’s wife ; to have thought so for one moment would have seemed to her grasping ingratitude ; and she was too happy in the present to think about the future . The thing to be thought of was to become worthy of him , that was all . BY the middle of the summer a perfect colony from æsthetic London had settled itself , to the amazed terror of the vicar and his parishioners , in Wotton Hall and the inn of the adjacent village . The Spencers came , with a perfect shipload of babies , and accompanied by Mrs Spencer ’s father and mother ; Cosmo Chough came , bringing scarcely any luggage except MS . poems and old music ; Thaddy O’Reilly came , and half‐a‐dozen young poets and painters , to name whom would be perfectly superfluous , and who were all the humble worshippers of Walter Hamlin . All these people had pictures to paint , poems to compose , articles to write ; but the exciting question for the whole household was the approaching publication of Hamlin ’s new book . Hamlin ’s acquaintance with Anne Brown had not been without a decided influence on his art . He had written a number of sonnets about her ever since the moment of their first meeting , recording various moods , real and fictitious , in connection with her , and of which he had sent or read her the greater number . Perhaps he would have written much the same sort of thing about any other woman ; but Anne had influenced him at once more directly and more indirectly . The æsthetic school of poetry , of which Hamlin and Chough were the most brilliant exponents of the younger generation , was evidently running to seed . It was beginning to be obvious , to every one who was not an æsthete , that the reign of the mysterious evil passions , of the half‐antique , half‐medieval ladies of saturnine beauty and bloodthirsty voluptuousness of the demigods and heroes treated like the figures in a piece of tapestry , must be coming to a close ; and that a return to nature must be preparing . Anne had felt it , and had vaguely determined that the man who was to revolutionise poetry was Hamlin . Indeed , who else could it be ? The elder poets were safe in their ruts ; the majority of the younger ones who had already come forward were mere imitators and caricaturists , not excepting the great Chough himself . Hamlin alone was a man of genius ; he alone was capable of turning over a new leaf ; and one or two new departures , attempts at a new way of describing things , if not actually an attempt at describing new things , persuaded Anne that the change was beginning . She did not like telling him that she perceived it coming ; for she thought that Hamlin might , did he perceive it , consider it as an apostasy from his original school , and draw back . But she encouraged him by showing a marked preference for the pieces which savoured of this new style ; and she even suggested to him to write a tale , in which he should substitute , for the conventional background copied by æsthetic poetry from the borders of missals , the pictures of old masters and of their French gods , Gautier and Baudelaire , the scenery of his own home , the wide commons , the beech‐woods on the downs , the solemn horizons of the fenny country which spread from Wotton to the sea . He had written it , and read it to her during that fortnight of solitude ; and Anne ’s heart had beat at the thought of the change which was to be wrought by Hamlin ’s new book — of the unknown youths hitherto fumbling vainly for a new style , who were to recognise in Hamlin the leader of a new school , the prophet of a new art . When the colony of London æsthetes arrived at Wotton , the new poem was solemnly read to them . They were all seated in the old‐fashioned library , the rows and rows of old novels and books of standard literature , the busts of ancient philosophers looking down upon them,—a quaint little assembly of ladies in peacock‐blue and dull sage and Japanese dragoned and medieval brocaded gowns , with slashed sleeves and limp tails — of men got up to look like Frenchmen or Germans , or Renaissance creatures , in wondrous velveteens , colonred almost like the bindings of their own books . They listened with considerable attention , and obvious impatience to interrupt . The first who did so was Mrs Spencer . “
71112	71117	71110	71110	Walter	145	” she exclaimed indignantly , “
71140	71141	71142	71142	I	0	” “
71152	71158	71150	71150	Edith	286	” answered Hamlin , testily . “
71171	71199	71166	71166	Zola	95	” said her father , a good‐natured man , who never carried his belief in himself to the length which it was carried to by his family . “
71207	71212	71205	71205	Zola	95	” cried Miss Spencer ; “
71223	71225	71166	71166	Zola	95	” ( “
71241	71248	71166	71166	Zola	95	” murmured the old painter . ) “
71298	71318	71319	71319	I	0	” There was a slight laugh at Mrs Spencer ’s vehemence , in which Hamlin alone did not join . “
71331	71338	71319	71319	I	0	” put in Chough , blandly . “
71385	71386	71387	71387	I	0	” “
71395	71445	71387	71387	I	0	” gobbled out Dennistoun , the little rickety poet , who had to be carried up and down stairs , and who wrote , while slowly sinking inch by inch into the grave , about carrying off lovely girls , and throttling them in the fierceness of his love . “
71487	71508	71509	71509	I	0	” This seemed an unanswerable piece of criticism . Anne alone leaned across the table ; she was very indignant . “
71512	71516	71509	71509	I	0	” she said , “
71548	71564	71565	71565	My	0	” Cosmo Chough looked at Dennistoun , and Dennistoun looked at Mrs Spencer ’s father . “
71570	71580	71610	71610	papa	3893	” cried the old painter in his broad Scotch , “
71600	71601	71602	71602	I	0	” “
71612	71630	71604	71604	you	0	” silenced his daughter , whose zeal for him and his school included timely snubbings for himself . “
71684	71685	71678	71678	I	0	” “
71697	71701	71691	71692	the children	3862	” reflected Chough , “
71734	71735	71717	71717	you	2013	” “
71747	71753	71738	71742	a husband of the lady	2014	” suggested O’Reilly , laughing . “
71757	71765	71755	71755	you	2013	” said Hamlin , affecting to laugh , “
71788	71819	71776	71776	You	2013	” and he looked bitterly round . Chough felt the rebuke and was silent . But Dennistoun , who was gasping , propped up in his chair , was furious . “
71832	71837	71852	71852	Wordsworth	348	” he gobbled out ; “
71863	71936	71852	71852	Wordsworth	348	” Hamlin rolled up his MS . He was very white . The others he did not mind , but this little rickety Dennistoun , whose poems were the most limited and the most hopelessly morbid of the whole set , annoyed him ; for in Dennistoun , for all his limitations and repetitions , Hamlin recognised the most genuine poet of his circle , his most real rival . Those words , “
71947	72041	71939	71939	Wordsworth	348	” were like a blow . He could have knocked down Dennistoun , had he not been a cripple . The conversation was changed ; and soon the first dinner‐bell dispersed the company . When Anne came down she heard some one stirring in the study next door . She went in . Hamlin was seated before the table , his head on his hands ; the MS . , all crumpled up , lay in front of him . Anne came silently to his side . Her heart was bursting with indignation . “
72047	72053	71939	71939	Wordsworth	348	” asked Hamlin , crossly . “
72103	72126	72094	72094	I	0	” Anne had spoken with vehemence and almost anger . She took one of his hands , which was dog’s‐earing the MS . “
72131	72135	72138	72138	you	2015	” she asked , “
72158	72159	72160	72160	I	0	” “
72164	72169	72160	72160	I	0	” and Hamlin stopped . “
72190	72205	72176	72176	Dennistoun	347	” His tone was angry and tearful , like that of a punished child . “
72239	72245	72259	72259	they	2016	” He did not answer . “
72248	72253	72254	72254	you	2015	” went on Anne , “
72274	72304	72262	72262	You	2015	” It seemed so impossible to her how any one could not believe in that poem , which seemed to her so strong , and noble , and beautiful . “
72312	72318	72319	72319	you	2015	” answered Hamlin , brusquely ; “
72331	72332	72319	72319	you	2015	” “
72345	72346	72347	72347	I	0	” “
72362	72363	72359	72359	O’Reilly	295	” “
72385	72397	72364	72372	The disconsolate poet being consoled by his beautiful fiancée	2019	” whispered O’Reilly to Mrs Spencer as they entered the room . “
72419	72423	72406	72406	you	145	” asked O’Reilly . “
72446	72452	72453	72453	Walter	145	” answered Hamlin , angrily . “
72455	72460	72453	72453	Walter	145	” cried Mrs Spencer , “
72468	72681	72463	72463	you	145	” But , despite this bravado , Anne felt , and her spirit sank within her , that Hamlin had been disgusted with his poem . He was rather cantankerous throughout dinner ; and Anne , watching him , felt a strange mixture of indignation — towards his critics for their criticism , and towards Hamlin for minding it . THE time has come for him to break with the old school , thought Anne ; consoling herself for a certain childish petulance , perhaps not quite new to her , in Hamlin ’s manner . But Anne proved mistaken . Whether the critics became less rabid on the following day , or whether Hamlin was suddenly smitten with the truth of their criticism , she could not say . He was very snappish at first towards Chough , and absolutely refused to speak to Dennistoun for nearly twenty‐four hours . Chough , who loved Hamlin like the apple of his eye , would not , however , be spurned ; he followed Hamlin about , he soothed him , he flattered him , he assured him that he was much the greatest poet of his generation ; but he repeated , almost with tears in his eyes , Dennistoun ’s criticism . “
72691	72695	72463	72463	you	145	” he cried ; “
72715	72716	72710	72710	Dennistoun	347	” “
72725	72731	72723	72723	Chough	248	” answered Hamlin , angrily ; “
72745	72967	72739	72739	I	0	” Anne did not revive the subject of the unlucky poem . It was useless provoking quarrels between Hamlin and his friends ; quarrels in which she was forced to own to herself that he showed himself too easily mortified and put out of temper . If he had been taught to mistrust their judgment , if he had been alienated from their school by their absurd criticism , why , so much the better . This business drew Anne ’s attention to the poetry of the school ; she re‐read a number of poems by Chough , Dennistoun , and several gods , demigods , and heroes of the movement . Whether it was that she had read them fragmentarily before , or that she had not understood their full meaning , or whether her attention was now called to their bad points rather than to their good ones , she scarcely knew ; but it seemed to her that she had never before comprehended this style of poetry : its beauty had ceased to please her , it seemed to her false , emasculate , diseased . Hamlin alone had not gone to its worst lengths ; he had sinned , but comparatively little . He was evidently intended for something better . And Anne thought with pride of that “
72972	73185	73186	73186	I	0	” which they had all fallen upon , and which was to be the signal for a new era in poetry . Soon it would be out ; and she the only person to have appreciated it . It seemed to Anne that at last , in her humble way , she might be beginning to repay the debt of gratitude which she owed Hamlin ( not that she wished that the debt should ever be less , God knows , or dreamed that it could be ) ; but at last Hamlin might reap some advantage from his generosity . He had stooped to make her , to turn the Perrys ’ servant into a lady ; in her turn , perhaps she , the woman of the lower classes , might encourage the delicately nurtured poet to attempt things bolder , simpler , and more healthy than he had done before . The proof‐sheets of the new volume began to come in . Anne had read nearly all its contents at one time or other , yet Hamlin , in his grave , ceremoniously adoring way , handed on the proofs to her . One day a fresh bundle came by post . After breakfast , Hamlin took Anne aside . “
73194	73198	73186	73186	I	0	” he said . “
73253	73270	73250	73250	you	2028	” Anne was quite taken aback for joy , and at the same time for fear . “
73276	73280	73250	73250	you	2028	” she said ; “
73330	73331	73332	73332	You	2028	” “
73358	73364	73350	73350	I	0	” said Hamlin , solemnly . “
73410	73443	73444	73444	I	0	” Hamlin had never spoken so passionately and earnestly before . Anne did not answer , but she squeezed his hand , and the gesture , and the look accompanying it , meant “
73448	73449	73444	73444	I	0	” “
73452	73461	73444	73444	I	0	” said Hamlin , detaining her as she was leaving—“I
73537	73538	73539	73539	I	0	” “
73542	73546	73548	73548	you	0	” answered Anne . “
73558	74676	73554	73554	I	0	” She went up into her room , shut the door , and seating herself at the table , unrolled the little bundle of proof‐sheets . But at first she could not read , or could read only the titles — her heart beat so , and the blood boomed so in her temples . That he should love her so much , believe in her so much — that it should really be he , just he and she , and not some one else ; it seemed too strange to be true . She slowly began to read the sonnets . Some of them she knew already ; others were expansions in verse of things which Hamlin had said or written to her ; many were about herself , passionate , with a sort of delicate , subdued , respectful passion , played , like some exquisite instrument , in various keys and rhythms of subdued pain or gladness . She felt so proud and glad , and at the same time so moved and saddened , that she almost cried over them . There were a lot of other sonnets , descriptive of places and of moods . Some of these she did not at all relish . They were not fleshly nor exactly improper ; but they contained allusions which Anne could not help following , allusions which she did not quite understand , but which she did not like . She felt half ashamed of herself , wondering whether all the impure poetry which she had lately been reading , whether her prejudice against the school to which these decidedly belonged , might not be making her imagine things which were not meant ; and Anne blushed at the thought — blushed at her knowing so many things , having learned so many things , in her half education as an Italian servant , in her culture as an æsthetic personage , which perhaps other girls of her age would not dream of . It was probably only her own morbid fancy . But then she came upon a set of sonnets — no fewer than twelve connected together by similarity of title — which put an end to her doubts . She felt giddy and sick as she read them ; mysterious and mystical hankerings , mysterious half‐longing repentance , and half‐repentant longings after untold shameful things . Anne pushed aside the proof‐sheets , and leaned her head on her hands . She seemed to be smothering for want of air ; she went to the window , and leaned against its rails . It was raining — a steady , clear fine rain . She looked at it mechanically as it filled the air like a thin veil , and crevassed the sand outside with yellow trickles of water . She did not for one instant believe that Hamlin had ever felt the things about which he was writing ; but he had written about them . She knew , from an unerring instinct , as well as from her own deep love , that Hamlin was as pure a man as could be found ; had he not been towards her — was he not , at that very moment — the very personification of chivalrous and spiritual lovingness ? Then she remembered the allusions which , without understanding them , used to frighten her in his letters — the allusions to vague evil which beckoned to him , which surrounded him ; and she remembered also his constant references in conversation to his being unlike what she imagined , to his baseness and unworthiness . Two years earlier she would have been seized with an agonising terror ; a week before she might have been overcome with pitying admiration at his self‐tormenting moral purity , taking umbrage at every thought of evil which passed across and seemed to soil his mind . But somehow , now , she did neither . She did not for one second believe that Hamlin was in any way a bad man . She repeated to herself that he was morbidly introspective , self‐scrutinising , morbidly imaginative ; but she could not realise that these hateful sonnets had been written in any great agony of imagined self‐debasement ; they were so artistic , so evidently written with enjoyment , so self‐conscious ; they were so clearly not the doubts of a troubled mind , but the work of a poet — and , what was much worse , so clearly the work of a poet of a definite school , of the school of Chough and Dennistoun and all the others , whom she was beginning to loathe . Anne looked at them over and over again . There was no reality in them ; mere revolting pose . Gradually her mind settled about them . They were doubtless things written long ago , when , without knowing what it all meant , he had been carried away by the wave of imitation of one or two shameless or foolish writers . He had alluded to sonnets which he had expected her to dislike , he had insisted so on a certain number being put aside ; if he had made her think that it was the sonnets about herself which provoked his doubts , that came from a sort of shame , an unwillingness to point out to her what she might perhaps overlook : it was not quite straightforward , but everybody , Anne had learned by this time , did not do right in a quite straightforward way . The only thing which perplexed her was , why he had submitted these poems to her at all ? Why had he not torn them up ? why shown them to her ? A little she could not help , as a woman , resenting his having done so at all . But perhaps he had done so to show her the difference between what he had been and what he was going to be,—perhaps — perhaps he had got a little callous , living among poets of this school . Anyhow , they were things of the past , and Anne did not distress herself any longer about them , so foreign did they seem to Hamlin , so impossible was it to bring them into connection with the thought of him . She put the proofs into her pocket , and waited for an opportunity of giving them back . Before dinner , when the guests were safe out of the way , she called Hamlin into the library . “
74682	74692	73554	73554	I	0	” she said , laying them on the table . “
74699	74703	74707	74707	you	2030	” cried Hamlin ; “
74718	74750	74713	74713	you	2030	” He looked so cheerful , so utterly unconscious of the possibility of Anne ’s having anything to say disagreeable to himself and herself , that she began to feel nervous . “
74761	74764	74751	74751	I	0	” she answered slowly—“indeed
74792	74799	74751	74751	I	0	But”—she resumed , after a moment ’s silence—“there
74826	74874	74824	74824	themselves	2032	” She spoke rapidly , decidedly , but when she had done she felt that she was crimson . Hamlin seemed quite speechless for astonishment . He quickly unrolled the smaller parcel , and glanced at its contents . A look of surprised ill‐humour crossed his face . “
74883	74890	74875	74875	I	0	” he said with affected coolness ; “
74913	74926	74898	74898	Chough	248	” So he had already provided himself with a stock of criticisms . “
74936	74951	74927	74927	I	0	” answered Anne , trying to feel as if she had expected this news . “
74983	75001	75002	75002	You	0	” she spoke resolutely and unflinchingly , because she saw Hamlin ’s eyes fixed incredulously on her . “
75075	75081	75056	75056	I	0	” Hamlin bit his moustache . “
75099	75107	75056	75056	I	0	” and he turned over the proofs . “
75122	75131	75119	75119	I	0	” and Anne vainly tried to soften down her expressions,—“I
75144	75156	75119	75119	I	0	” Hamlin ’s eyes flashed , but he kept his temper . “
75168	75180	75119	75119	I	0	” he said , echoing the worn‐out aphorism of his school . “
75188	75189	75190	75190	I	0	” “
75208	75215	75216	75216	You	0	” Hamlin spoke sullenly and doggedly . “
75222	75226	75227	75227	You	0	” cried Anne . “
75276	75277	75272	75272	You	0	” “
75283	75289	75291	75291	you	0	” exclaimed Hamlin , angrily . “
75309	75347	75348	75348	I	0	” Anne was silent for a moment : that he should prefer to make her believe in his own baseness ! It was horrible , loathsome , and , at the same time , pitiable and childish . “
75354	75358	75348	75348	I	0	” she repeated , “
75462	75506	75510	75510	yourself	0	” Anne had seized his arm ; he was shaken by her unexpected vehemence and passion ; he had never thought that Anne could become so passionate about anything ; he looked on , taken by surprise , not knowing what to think . “
75512	75514	75510	75510	yourself	0	” repeated Anne—“do
75555	75556	75553	75553	yourself	0	” “
75561	75565	75567	75567	you	145	” answered Hamlin ; “
75591	75608	75609	75609	I	0	” Anne ’s look — a look of incredulous contempt — smote him like a rod . “
75618	75624	75609	75609	I	0	” he said , sadly ; “
75661	75662	75650	75650	I	0	” “
75670	75677	75650	75650	I	0	” Hamlin smiled a forced smile . “
75693	75694	75683	75683	you	145	” “
75702	75708	75695	75695	You	0	” asked Anne , anxiously . “
75751	75800	75737	75737	you	145	” For a moment Hamlin had been overcome , had been delighted by this sudden burst of impetuosity , by this passionate belief in him and vindication of himself . But now , as he again glanced at the sonnets , he was once more annoyed and resentful . “
75812	75819	75820	75820	I	0	” he said with some irritation . “
75848	75852	75840	75846	an honourable man trying to defame himself	2043	” Hamlin sighed . “
75907	75908	75913	75914	the Fens’?—aren’t	352	” “
75926	75945	75923	75923	you	0	” Could Hamlin be merely worrying her , to vent his annoyance at the loss of the sonnets ? “
75958	75969	75923	75923	you	0	” answered Hamlin , with a kind of dogged satisfaction . “
75987	75993	75982	75982	you	0	” The ballad torn up ! “
76029	76072	76012	76012	I	0	” He spoke sharply , brutally , as if to bring home to Anne the unreliableness of her judgment : she had induced him to write it ; she had praised it ; and she wanted him to tear up those sonnets . “
76087	76092	76107	76107	you	145	” he went on ; “
76109	76110	76099	76099	I	0	” “
76113	76132	76099	76099	I	0	” said Anne , in a husky voice which burst out in a way that almost frightened him ; “
76142	76195	76099	76099	I	0	” but she said no more . ONE morning Hamlin received two unexpected letters at breakfast . From his looks , which he was at all times quite unable to control , it was clear that one of them brought good news , while the other must be about some disagreeable matter . “
76205	76233	76196	76197	Edmund Lewis	353	” announced Hamlin to his aunt , to Anne , and to his guests . There was a chorus of exclamations of surprise , sprinkled with pleasure . “
76239	76243	76244	76244	He	353	” asked Anne . “
76277	76366	76275	76275	him	353	” Anne remembered the name , and the strange , beautiful , cruel , mysterious , out‐of‐drawing heads in crayon , which had curiously impressed her the first morning after her arrival in England , rose before her eyes ; since then she had seen so many similar things , had got to understand so completely that mysterious , beautiful faces , with combed‐out hair , big weird eyes , and cruel lips , were so much school property , that she had become quite indifferent to them . “
76388	76392	76369	76369	you	2048	” remarked Anne . “
76401	76404	76369	76369	you	2048	” interrupted little O’Reilly—“only
76609	76610	76603	76603	Lewis	353	” “
76624	76629	76613	76613	you	2061	” cried Mrs Spencer . “
76660	76661	76662	76664	Poor Mrs Lewis	356	” “
76666	76670	76662	76664	Poor Mrs Lewis	356	” laughed O’Reilly ; “
76691	76692	76675	76675	you	2061	” “
76709	76710	76701	76701	I	0	” “
76716	76726	76714	76714	Edith	286	” interrupted her father , in his broad Scotch ; “
76743	76744	76745	76745	I	0	” “
76768	76788	76755	76755	I	0	” and Mrs Spencer , who was the most devoted of wives and mothers , tossed her head rebelliously . “
76830	76831	76836	76837	Mrs Lewis	356	” “
76840	76844	76833	76833	you	0	” asked O’Reilly , “
76870	76871	76872	76872	Papa	185	” “
76888	76916	76872	76872	Papa	185	” At this perfectly solemn answer there was a general laugh ; even poor Mr Spencer , who was the most timid of æsthetical persons , joining . “
76928	76932	76973	76973	you	0	” remarked Hamlin , “
76949	76950	76973	76973	you	0	” “
76964	76970	76953	76953	Lewis	353	” answered Chough , bitterly . “
76983	76987	76973	76973	you	0	” suggested Anne , “
77010	77011	77012	77012	He	4025	” “
77020	77050	77012	77012	He	4025	” replied Mrs Spencer sharply , still thinking of what she would do if by any chance Mr Spencer were to suddenly disbelieve in her father and his school . “
77069	77073	77066	77067	Miss Brown	171	” asked O’Reilly . “
77118	77150	77106	77106	her	2079	” Dennistoun , who had sat silent at the other end of the table , propped up on his chair , suddenly stretched out his long neck , and gobbled out — “
77229	77240	77226	77226	their	2083	coming!”—and he tried to fix his weak eyes on Anne . “
77243	77248	77226	77226	their	2083	” she answered quickly , “
77301	77311	77286	77287	not everybody	2085	” O’Reilly leaned over the back of her chair . “
77327	77331	77324	77325	Miss Brown	171	” he whispered . “
77334	77338	77339	77339	Lewis	353	” remarked Hamlin , “
77369	77377	77357	77357	He	353	” and Hamlin glanced round the table ; “
77388	77445	77354	77355	Miss Brown	171	” Perhaps , thought Anne , Edmund Lewis was disliked by this set for the same reasons which , she could not help understanding , were beginning to make her vaguely unpopular . Still , she did not like the story of his marriage , she did not like the recollection of his morbidly beautiful drawings . “
77453	77461	77451	77451	Lewis	353	” said Hamlin to her after breakfast ; “
77640	77656	77629	77629	she	2090	” Mrs Macgregor was walking slowly up and down the gravel walk before the house . “
77682	77683	77676	77677	my aunt	4294	” “
77689	77704	77705	77705	I	0	” cried Mrs Macgregor suspiciously , as if expecting to be told something disagreeable . “
77714	77718	77711	77712	Aunt Claudia	247	” said Hamlin , “
77727	77728	77720	77720	I	0	” “
77739	77744	77737	77737	Lewis	353	” interrupted Mrs Macgregor . “
77751	77752	77753	77753	I	0	” “
77770	77775	77776	77777	Cousin Sacha	359	” and Hamlin tried to smile—“from
77779	77792	77776	77777	Cousin Sacha	359	” Mrs Macgregor recoiled as if she had trodden on a toad . “
77796	77797	77776	77777	Cousin Sacha	359	” “
77816	77846	77814	77814	her	358	” For a moment there was a dead silence . The old lady ’s face , usually so vacant , was lit up into a terrific energy of anger . “
77856	77857	77850	77850	she	358	” “
77873	77877	77869	77869	she	358	” answered Hamlin . “
77892	77896	77897	77897	he	2105	” My aunt , “
77904	77947	77897	77897	he	2105	” has got a tremendous aversion — a prejudice — towards this one and only cousin of mine . She disliked her father , very reasonably , and I think she has let her dislike descend to the second generation rather unreasonably . “
77948	77951	77953	77954	Mrs Macgregor	243	” Unreasonably ! “
77956	77979	77953	77954	Mrs Macgregor	243	” you know it was not unreasonable , Walter — you know what that Cousin Sacha of yours was in this house . “
77980	77988	77990	77990	Hamlin	145	” I know nothing of the sort , “
77994	78065	77990	77990	Hamlin	145	” I know that Sacha lived in this house as a child ; I know she left it as a child ; I know we all hated her and hers , and that perhaps they deserved it ; but I know that we have no right to hate a woman of whom we know nothing , because she happened to have been a badly brought up child , years ago . “
78070	78075	78076	78076	I	0	” went on Hamlin , “
78091	78092	78076	78076	I	0	” “
78096	78103	78105	78105	you	0	” almost foamed out his aunt . “
78115	78116	78105	78105	you	0	” “
78162	78163	78135	78135	she	2106	” “
78168	78173	78179	78179	she	2106	” interrupted Mrs Macgregor . “
78189	78190	78179	78179	she	2106	” “
78202	78203	78192	78192	you	0	” “
78254	78310	78236	78236	She	2106	” Anne had heard many allusions to this Cousin Sacha , and they belonged to that class of cynical hints which always made her indignant with Mrs Macgregor . She instinctively took part with this unknown woman , and she admired Hamlin ’s decision and generosity . Why did he not always act like this ? “
78317	78328	78311	78312	That child	4205	” said Mrs Macgregor , when Hamlin had left them , “
78615	78616	78617	78618	Poor child	4378	” “
78620	78670	78617	78618	Poor child	4378	” said Anne . She shuddered at this glimpse into Hamlin ’s early life ; it had a horrible attraction for her , and yet she felt that she would far rather know nothing about it . All this filth seemed to cling to her mind and soil it . “
78676	78677	78678	78678	She	2131	” “
78688	78695	78683	78683	she	2131	” went on Mrs Macgregor meditatively , “
79845	79846	79822	79822	he	340	” “
79849	79870	79822	79822	he	340	” repeated Anne in astonishment ; she had listened without saying a word to this horrible page of family history . “
79884	79895	79898	79898	he	2216	” Mrs Macgregor looked at her with strange wide eyes . “
79947	79961	79974	79974	she	358	” cried Mrs Macgregor , and it was a kind of suppressed cry of pain—“and
79983	79992	79974	79974	she	358	” Anne did not know what to say . “
79995	80058	80060	80061	Aunt Claudia	247	” she could not help saying after a minute , for it seemed to her as if the whole story were so unjust , so one‐sided , as if there were so much too much laid at the door of the unhappy , neglected , corrupt child — so much too little pity or indignation shown at her having been thus neglected and corrupted,—“but
80156	80191	80146	80146	his	145	” It seemed to her so frightful that a girl , a child , a victim , just because she was a victim , should have such a weight of guilt thrown upon her . “
80203	80226	80194	80195	a woman	3960	” said Mrs Macgregor fiercely , her love for her lost nephew , and her strange theories of sexual influences mixing grotesquely and tragically—“and
80277	80278	80281	80281	them	2232	” “
80283	80290	80281	80281	them	2232	” she said after a moment , “
80336	82583	80323	80323	Hamlins	361	” Anne sighed . And as she walked through the big , stately rooms of Wotton House , she thought of the horrible scenes which had happened in there ; of the waste of life by violence and vice and neglect which they had witnessed ; especially of that wretched , vicious child , held so terribly responsible for the folly and wickedness of others . And the sense of the terrible power of circumstances , of the degradation into which others may lead one , or out of which others may raise one , which had been silently growing in her as she watched the world in her tragic way , came over her with a terrifying rush ; and she felt , half in anxiety at scarcely escaped danger , half in joy at safety , a tumult of gratitude when she remembered how Walter Hamlin had raised her up , led her out of the way of all temptation and evil contact , and left her safe and strong as she knew herself to be . As the summer changed into autumn , the guests at Wotton Hall were gradually renewed . Chough remained , and at Anne ’s particular desire sent for his two little girls , sad , strange , Cockney creatures , to whom the large house , the garden , the country walks and country sights , were as things of another world . But the Spencers , Dennistoun , and O’Reilly departed ; and in their place arrived the two Leigh girls and Edmund Lewis . The last‐named gentleman did not by any means strike Anne as a fascinating being . He was a stumpy , high‐shouldered , thick‐set little man , always very slackly dressed , with small , rather handsome features , and a profusion of curly reddish hair and beard , which made his face look even more like unbaked dough than it might otherwise have done . Some people considered him very handsome , and it was obvious that he himself felt as if he were tall ; for he stumped and slouched in and out of rooms with his hands in his pockets , and dropped on to chairs and sofas with the heavy importance of gait of a Hercules . Nothing could be more comic than the contrast between this lumbering and solemn redhaired dwarf and Cosmo Chough , black , fierce , alert , courteous , and grandiloquent . Lewis was silent ; but when he spoke he fixed his handsome eyes searchingly upon one , and either trailed his voice along with slow emphasis , or answered in monosyllables , which left in you an uncomfortable feeling of having made some inappropriate or impertinent remark . He had , moreover , lips of the colour of the very best sealing‐wax ; a peculiarity which , while decidedly adding to the pictorial value of a red‐haired man , has a something quite particularly repulsive to certain people , among whom Anne Brown must be counted . However , she tried to like Mr Lewis . In some respects he was a more genuine personality than Chough , or Dennistoun , or almost any other of Hamlin ’s æsthetic friends . He did not make himself up — manner , appearance , ideas , or words — to look like anything which he was not , or at all events which he did not thoroughly believe himself to be ; and he was , moreover , much more in the way of will and definite tendencies , and felt himself ( however mistakenly ) to be much more in the way of power , character , and importance , than any other man whom Anne had ever come across , except her cousin Richard , between whom and Edmund Lewis there existed , despite a thousand differences , a certain resemblance . And perhaps it was exactly this resemblance to Richard Brown,—a man whom Anne did not exactly like , nay , who even occasionally repelled her a little , but of whose power and truthfulness and generosity Anne could not doubt,—perhaps it was this resemblance , however vague it might be , which made Anne for some time believe that Edmund Lewis , little as he pleased her , might be a remarkable sort of man , and treat Chough ’s insinuations against him as merely another instance of that childish unreasonableness of likings and dislikings , which , together with vanity and weakness of will , she had got to associate with a poetic endowment . Over Hamlin , at all events , Edmund Lewis had an undeniable influence ; an influence which he himself avowedly attributed to his magnetic powers , which he would exert , or imagine that he exerted , sitting lazily opposite his friends or victims , staring vaguely at them and speaking in his slow , important voice . He was a painter , in an irregular sort of way , himself , and took much more interest in Hamlin ’s art than in his poetry ; so that Hamlin , who was sick of versifying for the moment , had a fit of painting once more , and spent hours locked up in his studio with Lewis , while poor Cosmo Chough was more and more thrown upon Anne and her friends . But the girls had got to understand Chough , and the fund of kindness and self‐sacrificing gentleness which was hidden beneath the little man ’s poetical thin‐skinnedness and the queer poetical veneer of mystic wickedness which he himself did not understand . He could not by any possibility be broken of his tendency to talk overmuch about Messalina , Lucretia Borgia , and La Belle Heaulmière ; but by this time it was quite obvious that he had not the smallest experience of ladies of any such character , still less the faintest thought of giving offence by his allusions to them . To Anne he was utterly devoted : he was fascinated by her beauty , afraid of its tragic earnestness , afraid of her downright , quiet manner , afraid of her silent contemptuousness , of her uncompromising censoriousness ; but if ever a person appreciated Anne ’s kindness , her energy , her imperious desire of helping others , it was Chough . Anne had often spoken to him about the neglected education of his little girls ; not reproachfully , for she knew but too well on what it depended , but trying to stir him up to resist the sort of fatality which seemed to hang over his family concerns . And now she insisted on taking the children ’s education into her own hands , until Chough should be able to afford sending them to a proper school . Perhaps the thought of that neglected , unconsciously corrupted , terribly responsible little heathen girl , who had done so much mischief in Wotton Hall fifteen years before , had something to do with Anne ’s energetic behaviour towards the little Choughs — to whom , every morning regularly , she gave a two hours ’ lesson in grammar and writing and history , as complete as if she had been a schoolmistress and they her pupils ; until their father , astonished at their unexpected development of human faculties , took it in his head to turn them into first‐rate musicians , and actually got up at six in the morning to teach them the piano , while Hamlin and Lewis were still asleep . Marjory Leigh , who had considered Anne in the light of an irresponsible but decidedly objectionable æsthetic villain on her departure from London , looked on in puzzled amazement . She could not understand how any one so beautiful , so versed in useless literature and useless art , any one whom her foolish elder sister foolishly adored , could be anxious and able to make herself of use in the world . And even Mary Leigh , in her gentle , ironical way , was astonished at Anne ’s new vocation , and adored her all the more enthusiastically for it . Mrs Macgregor hinted , in her affectionate cynical manner , that Anne was mistaking for a desire to be useful to Chough ’s children the mere imperious necessity of caring for some one , which was the vicarious form of love ; and prophesied archly that , once married , Anne would soon be satisfied with uselessness . Anne smiled contemptuously at Mrs Macgregor ’s theories . Yet she was as unaware as was Mrs Macgregor herself , that there was indeed an imperious necessity in her nature — a necessity more personal , more selfish , and more terrible than her mere desire to be of use . In these four months Anne had gradually , and hitherto unconsciously , ceased to love Hamlin as she had formerly loved him . Like many of the most powerful and passionate natures , Anne had a fatal tendency to love ideally and love the ideal ; not so much to invest with unreal qualities the object of her passion , but to conceive a passion for an impersonal creation of her own , an amalgamation of her own ardent and confused aspirations after an unknown excellence ; and then to identify the object of this strange intellectual and moral passion with the first real person who struck her as excellent and noble and beautiful , or who appealed strongly to her sympathies and her gratitude . Of love in the ordinary sense , such a nature is wellnigh incapable ; and the devotion due to real imperfect creatures , pity and sympathy with weakness , the devotion due to a sense of duty , although it may be intense and tender in such people , comes only on later , when the first splendid idol has been shattered , and whatever passion there is must be given , in humbleness or sorrow , to the unsatisfying realities of this world . With such a nature and such tendencies , Anne had been met , when young , ignorant , and friendless , by an indistinct yet real personality — by Hamlin , who had done for her more than any other man had ever done for a woman ; and in this vaguely seen Hamlin , known at first only as a servant knows the brilliant guest of the house , a model the painter to whom she is sitting — and then known at a distance , in letters which were the unreal efflorescence of a poet ’s mind,—in this vaguely seen Hamlin , to whom she owed her new life , and who was surrounded by all the beautiful things and ideas which that new life represented , Anne Brown had incarnated the ideal of good and beauty towards which her simple , self‐unconscious , energetic soul so strenuously aspired . Such a love as this must be transformed into something less exalted , or must die out unsatisfied , whatever the person who feels it or the person with whom it is connected : the real , however excellent , can never satisfy the craving after the ideal ; a living individual can never quiet desires which have no individual object , which are mere dumb and violent activities of a too powerful soul . But Anne was not the kind of woman in whom simpler and less exacting instincts , in whom ordinary love , can gradually supplant such an ideal passion ; and what was worse , Hamlin was not the man who could substitute for an impossible and unapproachable creature of the imagination , a less perfect , but more appealing , more attaching , more lovable creature of reality . No man that ever breathed could have satisfied cravings which were in reality not after a man , but after a higher life , a more complete activity , a nobler aim ; but Hamlin fell short not merely of Anne ’s ideal , but also , in many things , even of the reality of Anne herself , and of all she could understand and sympathise with . The ecstatic devotion had speedily given way in her to a more sober kind of admiration and affection ; but now , little by little , that also was being invaded , transformed piecemeal here and there , by doubt , contempt , and disgust . Anne ’s eyes had gradually opened to the fact that Hamlin was vain , thin‐skinned , professionally jealous , and afraid of the judgment , as he was avid of the praise , of his own inferiors ; and that , in the negative line , he was without strong likings , enthusiasms , or aspirations ; and the negative qualities affected her more than the positive ones : to her the coldness of Hamlin ’s sympathies was more painful than the weakness of his nature . Vaguely and gradually these things had dawned upon Anne ; and she could no more deny their existence than she could persuade herself that a grey English autumn day was brilliant as an Italian summer morning . But of late things had happened , like that incident of the suppressed “
82589	83451	80323	80323	Hamlins	361	” and of the self‐slandering sonnets which Hamlin looked upon with such complacency , which had given her glimpses into something worse than she could well believe in , worse than she had the heart to look into . These she cast behind her , thinking of them as little as possible , trying to consider them as hallucinations , or at all events , gross exaggerations of her own : she must have misunderstood ; such things could not be . She tried to settle her love of Hamlin on a real and more solid basis . She fully admitted to herself that Hamlin had weaknesses,—the weaknesses which she remarked in so many of the men around him,—weaknesses going together with the fine qualities of the poet ’s nature,—weaknesses which , Anne was beginning to suspect , every one had ( forgetting that she had not ) , or at least something equivalent thereunto . She admitted to herself that Hamlin was weak ; nay , to do so was a sort of relief . That Hamlin should come of a family infirm of will and often vicious , that he should have been brought up surrounded by vice and violence engendered by weakness ; this notion , due partly to her own observations , and confirmed by Mrs Macgregor ’s confidences , explained so much away , and left room for so much : it explained all the wretched part of his nature , it left room for all the good , for the gentleness , the generosity , the chivalric spirit which had made Anne what she was ; and it let her hope , every now and then , that better might be in store . For since the evil was merely negative and the good so thorough and so positive , surely the good would vanquish the evil . And , looking at the people who surrounded Hamlin,—at these vain , weak , unreal poets and artists , at this whole school of people who , whatever their private life , affected to live only for selfish enjoyment of beauty and selfish interest in sin,—Anne used often to think that Hamlin was in the position of a sort of Rinaldo , the noblest of all heroes , degraded into mean sloth by the Armida of æstheticism , but requiring only the shrill of the trumpet and the clash of arms from the real living world to be redeemed and to show himself in his real nobility . She would even exaggerate her aversion or contempt for Hamlin ’s companions and for his school ; the worse they were , the more excuse for him ; and she would often sit dreaming of the way in which he might be gradually got from under their influence , and brought in contact with those stronger , more healthy , or more terrible realities , which Anne ’s nature , by a kind of occult sympathy , felt in the world all round , as the birds and insects will feel the storm which is still invisible beyond the hills , but which is coming to purify , and shake , and revive . And so Anne went on loving and hoping , and believing herself to be happy . But there began to be a strange restlessness about her ; a desire to be useful , to be perpetually active in something , to be always trying to understand , and sympathise , and help — an imperious necessity not to be left to her own thoughts ( those thoughts which had once been like a paradise , in which solitude was the highest bliss ) . For , alone with her own thoughts , Anne was beginning to experience an intolerable sense of isolation , and intolerable sense of impotence . IN this condition of mind Anne was violently impelled towards the two Leigh girls ; and strongly induced to take an aversion to Edmund Lewis . For the Leighs represented every day more and more the influence which was strengthening her , the influence which might revive Hamlin ; and Edmund Lewis seemed sent as an incarnation of those tendencies which , in her belief , had marred the nobility of Hamlin ’s nature . Anne ’s unmistakable desire to know what was going on in the striving and suffering world outside the strongholds of æstheticism , to help in it to her utmost ; to be , what the people believing only in beauty and passion could not conceive , responsible,—all this intense striving got the better of Marjory Leigh ’s prejudices . She began to understand that she had found in Anne a zealous lieutenant ; nay , after some time , the conscientious though somewhat pig‐headed and conceited young philanthropist admitted to herself that Anne was a force for work and good which dragged even her along , making her , by the influence of her complete unselfishness , self‐unconsciousness , and energy , more ready to examine into her own mode of doing things , to sift her vanity from her humanitarianism . “
83459	83473	83452	83452	Anne	171	” Marjory one day remarked to her sister , waking up from a long reverie—“less
83541	84128	83533	83539	a rather bigoted sort of brute formerly	2237	” and Marjory pushed her fingers through her short , lank yellow hair , and looked up at her sister with her childish , resolute , defiant face , not yet puzzled by the sad experience of the difficulty of doing good , and of the dangerousness of even the wisest theories . Mary Leigh smiled . She was proud of her little sister ; and she was , in a sort of a way , in love with Anne Brown . Marjory thought her rather æsthetic and spiritless , she knew ; and Anne was absorbed in her own thoughts ; but Mary Leigh was one of those girls who can resign themselves cheerfully to being second best , as long as they are the best in their power — to be happy in her devotion , even if it be unreciprocated ; and she was happy , in a subdued way — proud of Marjory and adoring Anne , and seeing that the two somewhat unresponsive objects of her love could now appreciate one another . So much for the Leighs . But if their presence at Wotton was a support and a consolation to Anne , the presence of Edmund Lewis very soon grew to be a positive source of disgust . At first , in his egotistic , silently brow‐beating way , he was an interesting visitor . He had travelled and read a good deal , and , in point of fact , knew much more about literature than about his own art . His imagination turned easily to the terrible ; he considered Webster as greater than Shakespeare , and Ford as greater than Webster ; he had personal experiences of more or less criminal persons , whose acquaintance , for the sake of morbid psychology , he had sought , and whose characteristics he had lovingly studied ; while in reality mild and even milk‐soppish in his habits , he seemed to experience a fascination from violence and bloodshed . For a week or so he was decidedly interesting , if not , to Anne and her two girl‐friends , attractive . But hostility soon arose . He was a fervid spiritualist , and a great adept in mesmerising ; his vanity made him see mediums , victims of his will‐power , everywhere . He immediately discovered one in Anne , and begged to be permitted to try his tricks , as Marjory Leigh called them . Now , if there was one thing which was more abhorrent to Anne than any other , it was spiritualism : averse to mysticism like every Italian ; prosaic and common‐sense , perhaps just in proportion to the idealism of passion and aspiration , she was impatient of the vulgar mysteriousness of modern magic ; while at the same time her powerful personality , her austere will ( which she always recognised as the most precious part of her nature ) , which took umbrage at Mrs Macgregor ’s theories of obedience to mere physical passions , was positively insulted by the notion of surrender to the perfectly unintellectual will of another . However , she let Lewis try . During his performance , as he fixed his green eyes upon her , and made passes with his flabby white fingers , Anne felt a loathing as if a slug were trailing over her , but she sat unaffected by Mr Lewis ’s will‐power , and at last wearied out his patience . “
84135	84147	84132	84132	you	2238	” cried Lewis angrily , at the end of the séance . “
84155	84161	84132	84132	you	2238	” answered Anne , bluntly ; “
84174	84175	84176	84176	Hamlin	145	” “
84181	84191	84176	84176	Hamlin	145	” replied Lewis , with a certain malignant pride . “
84202	84203	84200	84200	Hamlin	145	” “
84208	84212	84176	84176	Hamlin	145	” explained Hamlin ; “
84238	84239	84232	84232	one	620	” “
84247	84330	84232	84232	one	620	” corrected Anne . From that moment Anne felt that Lewis hated her . Yet he was , in a way , fascinated by her exotic beauty ; he could not make up his mind that so strange and splendid a woman could resist him . He never tried to magnetise her again ; and he made many drawings of her , curiously distorting her expression , sullen , but frank and resolute , into a kind of sombre , morbid wistfulness . “
84340	84346	84335	84335	he	2242	” cried Marjory one day ; “
84381	84386	84335	84335	he	2242	” Mary Leigh laughed . “
84394	84398	84399	84401	the great men	2247	” she said : “
84471	84557	84463	84463	Anne	171	” Mary Leigh , who was the most absent‐minded of Irish enthusiasts , suddenly stopped short . She had only just remembered that Hamlin was a poet and a painter of the school which she had just described . And a pained , darkened look had come over Anne . Mary Leigh could not understand that that look meant that Anne had often thought just the same thing , and that now there returned to her , with sickening bitterness , the double recollection of the “
84563	84570	84463	84463	Anne	171	” and of those twelve sonnets called “
84573	84669	84670	84670	I	0	” Meanwhile Anne gradually got substantial reasons for her instinctive aversion to Edmund Lewis . The family of the vicar of Wotton sometimes visited at the Hall . There were two very young girls , scarcely more than children , for whom Anne and the Leighs had taken a fancy . One afternoon they came to tea , delicate pink‐and‐white creatures of fourteen or fifteen , impressionable , nervous , utterly ignorant of the world . Hamlin seemed to appreciate the charm of obvious purity and guilelessness which went with their ignorance of the world . “
84682	84697	84460	84460	you	2243	” he whispered to Anne , as they sat at tea in the library , “
84760	84939	84757	84757	you	2252	” Even Chough could not make a single unintelligible allusion to the wife of Claudius or the daughter of Alexander VI . , but sat with one of his children on his knee , looking at the young girls and gently humming a scrap of old minuet , fresh and simple like themselves . Anne could not help thinking that she had never been what these girls were . She had been shown the ugly things of life , taught to struggle with them since her childhood , and now believing equally in good , but believing sadly and bitterly . It was better to be a woman as she was , a woman who knew of good and evil , and was prepared to fight her way out of darkness ; but still it was sad never , never to have been as these girls . Edmund Lewis was leaning forward on the table , his reddish‐auburn head with its glittering eyes rising like that of a snake , as if silently trying to mesmerise the visitors . “
84953	85196	84941	84941	we	2253	” he proposed , in a half‐ jocular way which he occasionally had . The girls had never seen any pictures scarcely , and having heard of Hamlin and Lewis as famous painters from London , were delighted . The whole party went up to Hamlin ’s studio . He showed the girls not the things for which he cared most , but what he thought would give them most pleasure — magnificent tinted sketches of poetical legends , of the Sleeping Beauty , Cupid and Psyche , and so forth . Anne thought she had scarcely ever seen Hamlin so nice before as when he got the sketches out of the portfolio , and told the girls what they represented . When he had done , Edmund Lewis , with his slow , shuffling movements , placed his large sketch‐book on an easel , and turned a page . It was covered with outline drawings of men and women , stark naked , in various listless attitudes . Anne had seen these drawings time after time , and had thought them , accustomed as she was to studios and painters , merely clever nude studies , with the usual expression of bored depravity of all Lewis ’s work . She had criticised the drawing and anatomy , and had never before thought that any impropriety was connected with them . But now she could not help blushing and feeling vaguely indignant . “
85209	85401	84941	84941	we	2253	” whispered Mary Leigh , who , heaven knows , had seen nude studies enough in her life . Both she and Anne had caught the surprised , vacant expression of the two girls , had seen the flush in their face , and understood the silence , never asking what it all meant , as they stared at all this emaciated , flabby nakedness . And Anne caught also Edmund Lewis ’s expression , as he held the corner of the page , ready to turn over , with one hand , stroking his reddish‐brown beard with the other , and looking , with slightly raised eyebrows and curious green eyes , towards Hamlin , as if to call his attention . Lewis turned another page , and another ; always the same stark‐naked people . Anne was very black . Heaven knows from what instinct , perhaps from a paternal recollection of his own little girls , Cosmo Chough understood Anne ’s look ; and edging himself awkwardly into the corner , he banged against the easel , and made it and the sketch‐hook come down with a crash . “
85406	85423	84941	84941	we	2253	” cried Lewis , stooping to pick up his drawings , and slowly replacing the sketch‐book . “
85435	85439	85440	85440	you	2258	” said Anne ; “
85462	85472	85459	85460	Mr Lewis	364	” Lewis gave Anne a rapid , angry glance . “
85479	85494	85495	85495	I	0	” he said snappishly ; adding , in his drawling , mock courteous way , “
85509	85510	85495	85495	I	0	” “
85534	85937	85529	85529	they	2257	” said Anne , taking no notice of him . Perhaps , thought Anne , she might have been prejudiced against Edmund Lewis . He did draw morbid‐looking nudities ; but so many other men did just the same , that it was quite possible he might have displayed that sketch‐book from mere thoughtlessness . Yet she could not believe it ; she had seen Lewis ’s look as he turned over the pages , and that look had disgusted her . The next day but one the question was settled in her mind . It was a fine autumn morning , and Anne was seated on the terrace , waiting for the others to come down to breakfast . The air , just touched by the first cold , was exquisitely pure ; and the sear bracken of the hillside opposite sparkled golden with the heavy dew . All round the swallows were whirring about , collecting for departure . The thought of the Villa Arnolfini — of the place in the vineyard , among the yellowing vines , where she used to sit on the dry warm mint and fennel with the little Perrys , where , under the big mulberry‐tree , they had buried her Dante in a heap of yellow leaves — came home to Anne . How good Hamlin had been to her ! the idea almost pained her . But this lovely morning seemed to have swept all evil away . If only , Anne said to herself , Hamlin ’s sympathies could be violently roused — if only he could be awakened suddenly , by some unexpected contact with the tragic realities of the world , by a sudden appeal to his generosity and indignation , out of this æsthetic day‐dream with its enervating visions of impure beauty and forbidden things . If only this could be done , the horrid spell which kept him at a moral distance from her would be broken through . . . . And soon it must come , this awakening . As she was thinking in this way , Edmund Lewis strolled up , his hands behind his back , to the table at which she was seated . He gave her a little unceremonious nod , and then , interrupting the tune which he was faintly whistling , pushed a paper‐bound book across the table to her . “
85947	85951	85953	85953	you	2262	” he asked ; “
85972	86007	85958	85958	I	0	” Anne ’s eye glanced at the page , pencil‐marked all round , and then at the title on the margin . It was Gautier ’s ‘ Mademoiselle de Maupin . ’ She understood . “
86014	86018	86008	86008	I	0	” she answered , “
86042	86072	86030	86031	a man	503	” and she quietly handed the volume back , looking up , her beautiful severe face flushed , her slate‐grey eyes flashing , at Lewis . The painter started . “
86077	86087	86030	86031	a man	503	” he answered quickly , with his usual self‐possession , “
86137	86148	86136	86137	Miss Brown”—there	375	Brown”—there was a tone of patronising insolence in his voice . “
86154	86183	86136	86137	Miss Brown”—there	375	” answered Anne , rising . Oh how , how could Hamlin , with his chivalrous nature , endure the daily contact of such a man as this ! “
86200	86226	86184	86184	Lewis	353	” said Anne , later on . She could not allude to that scene of the book ; but she felt she must say something . “
86270	86271	86264	86264	you	2273	” “
86274	86292	86264	86264	you	2273	” answered Mary Leigh boldly , quite astonished at Anne ’s venturing to mention such a subject . “
86301	86305	86306	86306	Lewis	353	” answered Hamlin . “
86329	86330	86325	86325	I	0	” “
86334	86342	86325	86325	I	0	” thought Anne , with a shudder . “
86353	86490	86325	86325	I	0	” THREE days later , Chough and Lewis returned to town , and Hamlin went with them . The weather had broken up , and it was time to settle for the winter . Aunt Claudia and Anne were to stay on another fortnight , in order to give Hamlin time to make some alterations in the house at Hammersmith . Such at least was the pretext ; but Anne knew that Madame Elaguine had arrived in London , and she guessed that Hamlin would wish to transact whatever business there might be , before exposing to Mrs Macgregor ’s wrath the Cousin Sacha of former days — before , perhaps , refusing to let Anne Brown meet a woman whose past spoke little in her favour , and of whose present he knew absolutely nothing . “
86498	86539	86492	86492	I	0	” he exclaimed the evening before his departure , as he walked up and down the hall with Anne , while the rest of the company was listening to Cosmo Chough , shrilly piping eighteenth century music in the drawing‐room . “
86561	86568	86569	86570	Aunt Claudia	247	” he asked . Anne nodded . “
86577	86578	86569	86570	Aunt Claudia	247	” “
86584	86591	86580	86580	you	2276	” cried Hamlin , almost convulsively , “
86617	86618	86614	86614	you	2276	” “
86661	86662	86648	86648	I	0	” “
86704	86726	86727	86727	I	0	” There was something odd in his tone ; something not of indignation , but of a kind of clinging curiosity . “
86730	86734	86727	86727	I	0	” said Anne , “
86802	86803	86826	86827	a fiend	2291	” “
86808	86821	86826	86827	a fiend	2291	” There was some disappointment in Hamlin ’s tone . Anne laughed . “
86835	86837	86832	86833	a vampire	2293	” she said—“something
86870	86877	86878	86878	I	0	” Hamlin could not help laughing . “
86924	87363	87364	87364	He	2298	” Anne had induced Cosmo Chough to leave his little girls in her charge ; and the Leighs were to return to London with her and Aunt Claudia . The big house seemed very empty without Hamlin and his friends ; but the quiet was pleasant . Somehow , when he was away , when she could no longer see him perpetually sitting and walking with Edmund Lewis , Anne ’s love for Hamlin became much stronger . In her recollection he existed only with reference to herself ; she felt his goodness , she believed in his nobility , she felt sure that some day he would become more manly , healthy , and resolute . If only she could enter into his confidence , instead of men like Lewis and Dennistoun ; if only she could make him see all that there was in the world besides mere art and poetry . Perhaps she was unworthy to do it . This thought spurred her on , redoubled Anne ’s restless desire to know , to sympathise , and to help . Marjory Leigh had , soon after her arrival at Wotton , made acquaintance with the wife of the vicar , a simple , energetic , rather narrow‐minded but boundlessly unselfish woman , all whose thoughts were given to improving the condition of the neighbouring poor . To tell the whole truth , the vicar had a son , a young man entirely belying the usual saying about clergymen ’s sons , who had renounced a good living in the neighbourhood in order to become a curate in the East End of London . Harry Collett had been at Oxford at the same time as Hamlin ; he had even , for some time , belonged to the æsthetic set of which Hamlin and Melton Perry had been the heads : but he had soon become a religious enthusiast ; and , his religious enthusiasm cooling down , he had remained an ardent philanthropist . Hamlin had a liking for Harry Collett . He was handsome , tall , and emaciated , like a St John the Baptist by Donatello ; he was in his own style poetical ; he was a dreamer and an enthusiast . Hamlin used to call him Francis of Assisi . He did several sketches of him , and asked him several times to Wotton Hall . Anne also liked and admired him ; but there was something exaggerated , narrow‐minded , in him , which shocked her Italian temperament . What she wanted was secular energy , not priestly devotion . “
87369	87375	87366	87367	a monk	2299	” she used to say ; “
87418	87651	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” Marjory Leigh , who declared herself to belong to the most advanced of all advanced parties , and to whom Richard Brown was little less than a god , perfectly agreed in Anne ’s verdict . But being of a proselytising temper , and having a special love for proselytising among the young men of her acquaintance , she immediately set about enlightening the rather High Church benevolence of Harry Collett , as soon as he came to spend at Wotton his summer holidays . Anne and Mary Leigh used often to laugh over the intensely serious flirtations which were carried on between Marjory and the East End curate — flirtations of which both parties were perfectly unaware — earnestly discussing charity reorganisation , ventilation , primary instruction , and so forth ; but which was nevertheless destined to result , soon after the general return to town , in a long engagement between Marjory and Harry Collett . Harry was already back at his post in the East End ; but Marjory , being unable to discuss philanthropy with him , went daily to help his mother in her work . Thus it was that Anne gradually became acquainted with the petty miseries of village life , its dull indifference , mistaken by poets for innocence , and beneath which lies so much possibility of stupid misery and stupid crime . “
87660	87723	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” Anne used to say ; and she determined to ask Cousin Dick ’s advice , for she believed in radical measures rather than in the small palliations of the vicar ’s wife . One afternoon — they were within three or four days of return to London — Marjory Leigh returned more than usually excited from a visit to the vicarage . “
87729	87753	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” asked Anne , as the three girls sat alone in Hamlin ’s empty studio . Marjory threw her hat on the floor . “
87759	87763	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” she said , “
87782	87805	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” she added quickly , before Anne or her sister had time to exclaim , and as if to reclaim her reputation for omniscience—“of
87827	87833	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	still,”—and poor Marjory fairly burst into tears,—“I
87847	88010	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” Finally , when she had had some tea , Marjory , all blushing and stammering , and in a hesitating , roundabout way , which curiously belied her usual affectation of cynical omniscience , proceeded to explain what had just happened . A girl with an illegitimate baby — a very common occurrence in those parts — had turned up for assistance at the vicarage , and , while deprecating the wretched creature ’s fault , the vicar ’s wife had revealed to Marjory Leigh a jealously hidden stain in her parish ; namely , that in the hamlet to which the girl belonged , a mishap , as she termed it , like hers was a trifle , and indeed could scarcely be considered a fault at all , compared with the condition of brutish sin in which rolled , cynically huddled together in cabins no better than sties , the whole small population of that foul little fen village . “
88021	88025	87399	87416	men who do n’t merely feel sorry for vice , but who try to understand its scientific reason	2302	” cried Marjory , “
88105	88131	88096	88103	Christian people being so sinful close by one	2310	” and Marjory burst into hysterical sobs . Mary Leigh had exclaimed in horror as soon as Marjory ’s meaning had become plain to her . “
88145	88161	88162	88162	You	249	” she exclaimed , throwing herself on her knees and clasping her sister ’s waist . “
88187	88216	88181	88181	yourself	249	” Anne had not exclaimed . She sat perfectly still , and said nothing . Most persons would have deemed her very callous , she looked so calm . “
88224	88230	88231	88231	you	249	” she asked , after a minute—“are
88247	88248	88241	88242	Mrs Collett	376	” “
88268	88284	88255	88256	Mrs Collett	376	” and interrupted by her sobs , Marjory repeated scraps of what she had heard . “
88290	88298	88255	88256	Mrs Collett	376	” asked Anne , after another pause . “
88368	88604	88361	88362	Mrs Spencer	288	” Anne remembered . The recollection of that moment came like a vision ; she saw the wide river , between its low sedgy banks of boggy green ; the reddish storm sunset reflected in clotted flame‐coloured masses in its thick grey waters ; the moon rising , a spectral crescent on the blue evening sky ; she heard the quail of the frogs , the cries of the water‐fowl : the Spencers and Chough on ahead with the two Leighs and Harry Collett ; and she and Hamlin lingering behind , watching the reddened stream — and the cattle , dark outlines on the flat green banks opposite ; Hamlin scrambling down the bank to get a tuft of willow herb growing half in the water . She was feeling so happy ; Hamlin was so good and gentle and handsome , and she loved him so ; and they two had stood by the river alone , until the little Spencer children had run back and taken her hand , and begun asking a hundred questions in their shrill baby lisp . It was so lovely and peaceful and good , this green country , this quiet evening , with Hamlin by her side and the children holding her hand . She had felt a painful longing to impress the place and the moment on her mind , to keep this happy present . “
88610	88619	88620	88621	Cold Fremley	380	” she had asked ; and Hamlin had answered “
88623	88928	88620	88621	Cold Fremley	380	” Cold Fremley ! Anne went on repeating to herself all that afternoon : the recollection of that beautiful scene , become hideous like a nightmare , haunted her . The huddled roofs dark in the distance , the curl of smoke — that was the place . Anne felt dizzy . She had read enough about shame and sin , heaven knows ; the poems of the poets of the set were full of allusions to such things . But she had never realised that they could be realities ; they had been so many artistic dabs of horror , imaginary , or belonging vaguely to some distant , dim world , as unreal as the beautiful haunted woods and mysterious castles , the pale unsubstantial gods and heroes , and men and women of the pictures of Rossetti and Burne Jones , of the poems of Swinburne and Morris , and Hamlin and Chough . But that abominations like these should be here , close at hand , in sordid , filthy reality , reality under this same sun , swept by this same wind , reality through which she had unconsciously walked ; this seemed impossible . A strange thing happened : the thought of what she had heard haunted her so persistently , loomed before her in such ever‐changing horror , that Anne at last felt like one drunk or half asleep , and began to doubt whether it was not all a horrible nightmare . Had Marjory really told her these things ? Before a court of justice Anne would have been unable to say whether she had or not . It was so unreal to her that she could not accept it as a reality ; the more she brooded , the more did it seem a hallucination . “
88931	88940	88620	88621	Cold Fremley	380	” said Anne the next day , suddenly , “
88965	88972	88956	88957	Mrs Collett	376	” Marjory looked up in astonishment . “
88976	88983	88956	88957	Mrs Collett	376	is,”—she had half forgotten it herself . “
88994	89013	88945	88945	you	249	” said Anne , passing her hand over her eyes , as if to disperse some black mist ; “
89040	89135	89136	89136	Anne	171	” Marjory looked at Anne . She was very pale , and her big , greyish‐blue , onyx‐coloured eyes were wide with a fixed stare . She looked as if she did indeed see the tarnish on the world , and felt the clamminess ; as if , like a person taken with some fever , she tasted copper on her tongue . Marjory was a sensible girl . She had studied medicine , and knew an appalling amount about direction of the will , expectant attention , and other psychological and physiological matters . “
89138	89142	89028	89028	you	0	” she said , “
89235	89260	89261	89261	You	171	unworthy,”—and Marjory completely forgot how she herself had entered the room in hysterics the previous day . Anne took no notice of her speech . “
89275	89286	89261	89261	You	171	” she asked , after a pause . Marjory nodded . “
89339	89360	89361	89361	Laura	190	” A thought seemed to flash across Anne ’s darkened mind . Her maid had just brought in the tea‐things . “
89363	89367	89361	89361	Laura	190	” she asked , “
89388	89389	89390	89390	I	0	” “
89409	89413	89400	89400	he	2328	” answered Laura . “
89418	89422	89400	89400	he	2328	” ordered Anne . “
89428	89433	89400	89400	he	2328	” cried Mary Leigh , “
89467	89468	89462	89463	Mrs Collett	376	” “
89475	89483	89462	89463	Mrs Collett	376	” answered Anne , quietly and firmly ; “
89497	89498	89462	89463	Mrs Collett	376	” “
89501	89506	89509	89509	you	171	” cried practical Marjory ; “
89530	89531	89515	89515	you	171	” “
89542	89546	89539	89539	they	2333	” repeated Anne . “
89583	89584	89561	89561	I	0	” “
89612	89616	89599	89599	you	171	” cried Marjory , contemptuously—“I
89620	89628	89629	89630	The steward	2337	” At this moment the maid entered . “
89659	89679	89653	89653	he	145	” Marjory and her sister looked at each other and then at Anne , as much as to say , “
89690	89700	89653	89653	he	145	” Anne flushed scarlet , but her face brightened . “
89708	89739	89701	89701	I	0	” she said , as soon as the maid ’s back was turned . Her voice faltered a little ; but it was from sudden surprise , not from hesitation . “
89754	89759	89701	89701	I	0	” exclaimed Mary Leigh ; “
89766	89767	89760	89760	you	4117	” “
89782	89786	89779	89780	your aunt	1756	” suggested Marjory . “
89791	89795	89788	89789	Aunt Claudia	247	” cried Anne . “
89847	89848	89843	89843	he	145	” “
89858	89862	89863	89863	you	4117	” insisted Mary ; “
89892	89893	89883	89890	a man who is in love with you	2345	” “
89903	89907	89883	89890	a man who is in love with you	2345	” answered Anne . “
89963	90274	89957	89957	I	0	” The Leighs looked at her with incredulous astonishment . It seemed so simple to her . IT was raining when they arrived in London — a warmish , brown , clammy autumn day . The streets were a porridge of liquid mud , whose trail dragged along the wet asphalt ; the houses were staring forth , a livid dirt‐grey , in the thin rain ; and the sky , the very rain , was befouled with grime . Only drays splashed through the mud , and carriages carrying hurried‐looking people ; children , still in their tattered summer cottons and battered straw hats , stared in at the shops , the broad sheen from whose brilliant windows was caught up by the wet pavement , and lingered out , in broken reflections , in the brown ooze of the thoroughfare . Along the deserted suburban streets every second house seemed to be a gin‐palace , with shining coloured globes , and stucco pinnacles soaked with rain , and ground‐glass windows shining out like a leprosy of white . Mrs Macgregor closed her eyes in disgust . Even the maid looked depressed . But Anne stared out of the window of the carriage at all the hideous soppy sordidness , which seemed to soil and soak black into one ’s mind ; and she felt glad . All this was reality : it was the world in which lay her redemption , and the redemption of Hamlin . Anne found Hamlin full of his cousin Sacha , upon whom he had already called three times , and in whom , to his surprise , he had found not a trace of the child whom he had hated ; but a respectable , unworldly young mother , devoted to her children , timid , and only deserving a little sympathy . “
90282	90286	90277	90280	a very curious woman	2352	” he said , “
90343	90344	90333	90333	I	0	” “
90354	90358	90350	90350	she	2351	” exclaimed Anne . “
90402	90403	90389	90389	I	0	” “
90412	90416	90389	90389	I	0	” laughed Hamlin ; “
90435	90436	90431	90431	her	2351	” “
90475	90601	90602	90602	She	2357	” Anne felt really glad . That the terrible Cousin Sacha , the fiend‐child of Wotton Hall , should turn out a respectable , unworldly young woman , devoted to her children , seemed to her like the first breaking of the spell which hung over Hamlin . She felt no jealousy of Cousin Sacha ; for , as Hamlin spoke of Madame Elaguine , it was obvious that if he was anxious to show her to Anne , he was equally impatient to display his beautiful ward to her , who had evidently been told a great deal about her already . The next day Madame Elaguine was to call on Anne . Mrs Macgregor took the announcement in a spirit of sombre defiance . “
90606	90610	90602	90602	She	2357	” she said , “
90625	90626	90602	90602	She	2357	” “
90629	90633	90602	90602	She	2357	” answered Hamlin . “
90662	90709	90710	90710	She	2357	” Accordingly , at half‐past three , Mrs Macgregor rolled off in the brougham to Mrs Argiropoulo ’s , and to various other people whom she declared she hated . At four o’clock Hamlin came up‐stairs from his studio , and Anne gave him some tea . “
90718	90744	90710	90710	She	2357	” he said . There was a noise of wheels ; Anne felt her hand tremble as she poured out a second cup for Hamlin . “
90771	90856	90857	90857	She	2357	” But the wheels passed on . More wheels , which also passed ; rings and knocks ; but no Madame Elaguine . Hamlin , at every false alarm , got up and looked at Anne — a long , admiring look at her stately figure and her strange pale face , with the overhanging masses of crimp black hair ; at the splendid postures , of which only Michelangelo seemed to have ever understood the magnificent weary weightiness into which she naturally fell . “
90863	90876	90857	90857	She	2357	” he said with some irritation , as the clock struck five ; “
90891	90892	90893	90893	I	0	” “
90919	90920	90910	90910	you	0	” “
90927	90928	90910	90910	you	0	” “
90950	90951	90956	90956	she	2357	” “
90964	90978	90981	90981	she	2357	” At that moment a cab stopped , and there came a knock . “
90983	91037	90981	90981	she	2357	” cried Hamlin , and he ran down‐stairs . Madame Elaguine entered ; in the dusk Anne could scarcely see her face : she was rather below the average height , but so slender that she looked tall ; there was something very shy about her , and Anne could understand her shyness . “
91046	91050	91038	91038	I	0	” she said ; “
91058	91059	91060	91060	I	0	” “
91072	91077	91069	91069	your	2364	” said Madame Elaguine ; “
91103	91227	91095	91095	she	2366	” and she laughed a little shy laugh . She had a beautiful voice , high and silvery , and yet warm and caressing , like a child ’s , which inevitably made you think of delicate green leaves , and fields whitened with budding clover , and all sorts of young and tender things . She was very thin , almost emaciated , and with a slight droop of the head : it was too dark for Anne to see her features distinctly , but she seemed pretty , and frail , and wasted . There was something in that childish voice which touched Anne ; her strong , rebellious disbelief in the horrible Sacha of Mrs Macgregor came indignantly to her . “
91242	91252	91233	91233	you	2364	” said Madame Elaguine , after some trifling conversation , “
91265	91283	91284	91284	Walter	145	” and her voice , in a sudden outburst of frankness , became just a little tremulous , “
91331	91332	91337	91339	a bad‐hearted child	2370	” “
91341	91345	91337	91339	a bad‐hearted child	2370	” cried Anne , “
91370	91375	91364	91364	I	0	” Madame Elaguine sighed . “
91380	91384	91364	91364	I	0	” she said , “
91436	91486	91487	91487	You	145	” There was something in that clear soft voice , with its just perceptible daintiness of Russian pronunciation , making the English words not less English , but more distinct and liquid , which made what from any one else might have seemed strange , quite natural and simple . “
91495	91499	91487	91487	You	145	” asked Anne . “
91592	91593	91579	91579	I	0	” “
91600	91604	91579	91579	I	0	” asked Anne ; “
91615	91616	91579	91579	I	0	” “
91626	91636	91619	91619	I	0	” exclaimed Madame Elaguine , with a curious wildness ; “
91667	91668	91660	91660	I	0	” “
91672	91974	91660	91660	I	0	” ordered Hamlin , who had summoned the servants . He was impatient that the two women should see each other , impatient to display to his cousin the magnificent creature which belonged to him . They had begun discussing various school‐plans for Madame Elaguine ’s children when the lamps were brought in . Anne was surprised when she saw Hamlin ’s cousin distinctly ; she had imagined her pretty and delicate in an ordinary way , but there was nothing commonplace about this woman . She was pale , and of almost ghastly thinness , and her features , despite her small size , were large , and perhaps a little gaunt . It struck Anne that she had seen a face like that before , and later she discovered that what Madame Elaguine made her think of was Sarah Bernhardt in one of her girlish parts , or as her face looked under the little cap of Coppée ’s page‐boy . It was a charming , frank , worn , yet childish face , full of movement,—a face which seemed to vibrate like a delicate instrument — not exactly beautiful nor exactly lovable , but interesting and fascinating . It seemed to Anne that she could perfectly understand the past of this woman : a highly nervous , delicate nature , not earnest but passionate , easily turned into the very best or the very worst ; and she felt more than ever indignant at the thought of the corruption in contact with which this mobile impressionable creature had come as a child,—at the thought of all the unintentional shame which this woman must look back upon in her childhood . While they were talking , Sacha Elaguine was equally busy looking at Anne ; and Anne puzzled her . “
91985	92035	91660	91660	I	0	” said the little Russian to herself , as she looked at Anne ’s solemn , unruffled , and yet tragic beauty . At that moment a carriage stopped at the door . Hamlin went to the window . He looked rather pale and puzzled as he came back . “
92045	92050	92037	92037	me	0	” he said hurriedly ; “
92069	92104	92066	92066	you	2378	” Anne understood . Mrs Macgregor , who had gone out expecting Madame Elaguine to come an hour earlier , had returned , and Hamlin dreaded a scene . But Madame Elaguine understood also . “
92110	92114	92105	92105	Your	2378	” she said ; “
92142	92159	92120	92120	she	1756	” Hamlin hesitated ; but Madame Elaguine seemed to pin him down with her rapid glance . “
92164	92168	92120	92120	she	1756	” he said ; “
92195	92196	92190	92190	she	247	” “
92210	92228	92237	92238	Your aunt	1756	” and the little emaciated creature rapidly stopped Hamlin as he was raising the curtain into the next room—“I
92291	92292	92285	92285	she	1756	” “
92301	92325	92329	92329	her	1756	” said Anne , though she knew full well what sort of reception Mrs Macgregor was likely to give to the detested Sacha . “
92332	92333	92329	92329	her	1756	” “
92348	92352	92335	92335	you	360	” insisted Hamlin . “
92418	92429	92402	92403	my aunt	4294	” Madame Elaguine listened with a slight look of contempt . “
92513	92546	92547	92547	I	0	” There was something theatrical in this which took Hamlin by surprise ; but it was the theatricalness of a quixotic and passionate temper , and Anne liked Madame Elaguine for it . “
92554	92559	92551	92552	Mrs Macgregor	243	” repeated the Russian ; “
92606	92623	92599	92599	I	0	” and she shook her little head with its close pale‐yellow curls and deep brown eyes , “
92646	92647	92648	92648	I	0	” “
92656	92710	92653	92654	Aunt Claudia	247	” said Anne . But as she spoke , Mrs Macgregor entered . The old lady was short‐sighted ; and in that room , where the light , concentrated on a few spots , left all the more shadow all round , she did not at first notice the presence of a stranger . “
92717	92722	92714	92714	she	1756	” she asked savagely . “
92731	92737	92728	92729	Aunt Claudia	247	” answered Anne , quietly . “
92740	92745	92714	92714	she	1756	” exclaimed Mrs Macgregor — “
92751	92752	92754	92754	she	1756	” “
92758	92777	92754	92754	she	1756	” went on Anne , with a weighty coldness which often put down the old lady ’s ebullitions , “
92786	92810	92779	92779	she	1756	” Hamlin was standing by the piano . How he wished his cousin at the devil for inflicting such a scene upon him ! “
92814	92831	92779	92779	she	1756	” muttered Mrs Macgregor . But Madame Elaguine had come forward and stretched out her hand . “
92844	92853	92841	92842	Aunt Claudia	247	” she said , in her clear voice . “
92894	92933	92937	92938	Sacha Polozoff	358	” She had sat down opposite to Mrs Macgregor . Hamlin ’s aunt scanned her from head to foot ; she was taken by surprise , shaken throughout her nature , and at a loss how to answer . “
92940	92949	92935	92935	you	247	” said Mrs Macgregor at length , slowly . “
93030	93053	93017	93017	I	0	” And she stretched out her hand with a bitter smile . Madame Elaguine stooped down and kissed that shaking old hand . “
93131	93149	93150	93150	I	0	self,”—she spoke very low , and with tears in her voice , but with passion and pride . “
93159	93164	93154	93154	you	247	” replied Mrs Macgregor , “
93203	93273	93188	93188	you	247	” Sacha bowed ; the insult seemed to trickle off her . Anne half wondered , half admired . She could not in the least understand the kind of character which prompted such a useless and hollow ceremony as this ; but as to Madame Elaguine , this solemn act of self‐humiliation seemed necessary and just ; she admired her for having the courage to carry out her intention . “
93276	93289	93188	93188	you	247	” said Madame Elaguine , as Anne accompanied her into the anteroom . “
93345	93352	93354	93354	you	0	” Her tone was very appealing . “
93361	93372	93354	93354	you	0	” said Anne , in her earnest , solemn way , “
93400	93412	93389	93389	I	0	” The little thin woman looked up in Anne ’s face . “
93417	93421	93413	93413	You	0	” she said . “
93429	93493	93423	93423	you	0	” Anne stooped down and kissed her shyly on her wan cheek . But a sort of shudder passed through her as her own lips touched that hot face , and grazed the light hair , which seemed to give out some faint Eastern perfume . This woman was so unlike anything she had ever seen — so unlike her own simple self . “
93509	93514	93507	93507	you	0	” asked Madame Elaguine . “
93526	93544	93507	93507	you	0	” She was very excited , and she gasped as if her heart were beating like bursting . “
93552	93556	93549	93550	Mr Hamlin	145	” said Anne . “
93563	93576	93557	93557	She	2406	” said Hamlin , as he followed Anne up‐stairs from the door . “
93586	93587	93579	93579	I	0	” “
93629	93630	93631	93631	I	0	” “
93678	93682	93665	93665	she	2406	” Anne laughed . “
93735	93736	93737	93737	I	0	” “
93741	93796	93737	93737	I	0	” answered Hamlin , looking at Anne , and seeing her again in that close‐fitting white bodice , with rolled‐up sleeves , bending her magnificent head over the iron‐board in the little nursery , with frescoes of blue skies , and blue seas , and ducks , and people in boats , at the Villa Arnolfini—“I
93845	93879	93840	93840	I	0	” Anne smiled ; but she took his words to heart , for somehow that same impression which he said he had received from her face she had had vaguely in her heart . “
93896	93900	93903	93906	a tolerably grateful one	2413	” she said , “
93908	93909	93910	93910	I	0	” “
93927	93944	93913	93914	Anne Brown	171	” remarked Marjory Leigh to her sister one day , soon after their return to town . “
93956	93957	93945	93945	I	0	” “
93966	93970	93913	93914	Anne Brown	171	” answered Mary ; “
94023	94024	94015	94015	Anne	171	” “
94027	94031	94015	94015	Anne	171	” cried Marjory ; “
94042	94287	94032	94032	you	0	” But despite her sister ’s superior knowledge of womankind and of everything else , Mary Leigh was in the right ; perhaps in some cases enthusiastic admiration gives a better clue to action than mere common‐sense . Anne really was made in such a way that when once she was persuaded that any course was the right one , no dislike which she might have to it , no thought of being considered queer , or improper , or quixotic , could restrain her from it . The thing became none the pleasanter to do ; but it was done unflinchingly : indeed there was in Anne an almost destructive quality of will , a power of ruthlessly cutting through all obstacles , the passing consciousness of which , joined with the consciousness of the many disagreeable things which it might at any moment force her to go through , produced in her a curious kind of pessimism , which , while it recognised the evil of the world , made that very recognition an incitement to struggle for good . Anne had made up her mind that Hamlin must have the horrible condition of his Cold Fremley tenants explained to him . She fully appreciated the unseemliness , the painfulness , of such a revelation coming from her ; but as there appeared to be no one else who could satisfactorily make it to him , it must be made by her . “
94293	94408	94032	94032	you	0	” she said to herself : and this was the most characteristic remark that Anne could ever make ; for it is curious how very much simpler life does become to people who are in the habit of acting without regard for their own feelings . But it was , though simple , difficult , not on her own account , but on Hamlin ’s . In the first few days after her return from Wotton , she had several times been on the point of broaching the subject , but she had desisted on noticing the absolute want of seriousness in Hamlin ’s manner , the æsthetic vagueness and fickleness of his thoughts . “
94418	94505	94409	94409	He	2417	” she said to herself ; and as , time after time , she watched for a propitious moment without finding it , Anne became painfully aware , as one becomes aware of some deficiency in a valued piece of property only when it is pointed out , of Hamlin ’s want of seriousness , of his utter want of any habit of asking himself about his responsibilities , or indeed of thinking about anything except himself and the beautiful and weird things which delighted him . “
94514	94519	94511	94511	my	0	” Anne suddenly thought ; “
94539	94672	94511	94511	my	0	” So it must be done at once . Hamlin , she knew , was alone in his studio ; he must have finished his afternoon ’s work , or very nearly , and there was no Chough , or Lewis , or Dennistoun on the horizon . So Anne closed the piano at which she had been practising some of Chough ’s favourite old music , and went down‐stairs . She had made up her mind ; but , as she went slowly to the studio , she felt her heart begin to flutter and to beat , and a cold perspiration to start out in her forehead . For all her familiarity with the æsthetic world , in whose apprehension , as Thaddy O’Reilly ’s Yankee friend had quietly remarked , “
94678	94908	94909	94909	I	0	exist,”—for all her habit of reading poems in which every unmentionable shamefulness was used as so much vermilion or pale‐green or mysterious grey in a picturesque and suggestive composition,—Anne had retained a constitutional loathing for touching some subjects , which was like the blind instinctive horror of certain animals for brackish water or mud . When Marjory Leigh had first taken her into her confidence , and told her of the pools of sin which stagnated among the starving , unwashed , and unlettered million , Anne had recoiled , and felt a sort of momentary horror for Marjory , a sort of resentment at this foulness thus obtruded on to her ; and this feeling , which would sometimes still recur while talking with her philanthropic friend , was perhaps the thing in all her life of which Anne was the most profoundly ashamed . The æsthetes all round her would let all the world rot away in physical hideousness rather than have that physical hideousness put before their eyes ; and she , was she not even worse , in her cowardly horror of seeing moral wounds and leprosies ? So Anne argued with herself ; and she would now face anything ; but the feeling of moral sickness was there , however bravely she might look at evil , and try and help to remedy it . “
94915	94941	94909	94909	I	0	” Anne thought as she felt her heart fluttering as if it would break loose , as she stood and knocked at the studio door . “
94945	94979	94982	94982	I	0	” cried Hamlin . He thought it was the servant , for at first he did not turn round , but continued writing at a beautiful , fantastically inlaid desk in a corner . “
94984	94995	94982	94982	I	0	” said Anne . He started up to meet her . “
95006	95012	95003	95004	Madonna Anna	387	” he said , beaming ; “
95103	95113	95084	95084	you	0	” Anne smiled faintly , but her heart sank . “
95130	95298	95121	95121	I	0	” he said , and rolled an easel into the middle of the room . Anne stood for a moment before the almost Giorgionesquely magnificent picture , looking vaguely at the well‐known lady — with those strange , half‐classic , half‐Semitic , and yet a little Ethiopian , features , those wide grey eyes , that pent‐roof of crisp , lustreless , black hair , those hollowed cheeks and tragic lips which had by this time become so familiar to the artistic world of London . It never seemed to her that this could have anything to do with her , this sombre , mystic , wistful woman of unreality . But she was not thinking of that ; she stood at the picture , but almost without seeing it . Hamlin was standing a little aside , looking from her to the picture , and from the picture to her , and humming the lines from Dante ’s sonnet , which Chough had set to music — “
95312	95313	95121	95121	I	0	” “
95316	95322	95323	95323	Dante	180	” he said to himself , “
95332	95333	95323	95323	Dante	180	” “
95344	95361	95341	95342	Mr Hamlin	145	” said Anne , suddenly turning round . Something in her voice took him by surprise . “
95367	95420	95341	95342	Mr Hamlin	145	” he said , pulling forward a heavy arm‐chair , covered with old‐fashioned green brocade . Anne sat down . How was she to begin ? She had intended to prelude with some sort of apology for entering on such a subject ; but , somehow , now she could not apologise . “
95438	95466	95341	95342	Mr Hamlin	145	” asked Anne , slowly . Hamlin had just caught a look which he wanted for his picture , and he had taken up his painting things . “
95469	95495	95341	95342	Mr Hamlin	145	” and he looked up from his palette in Anne ’s pale face , with the almost monochrome faint‐red lips and the delicately hollowed cheeks . “
95521	95522	95514	95514	we	2425	” “
95554	95555	95559	95559	I	0	” “
95593	95594	95582	95582	I	0	” “
95599	95626	95582	95582	I	0	” went on Anne , carefully steadying her voice , but keeping her eyes on the little cypress‐trees and conventional anemones of the Persian rug under her feet—“it
95662	95663	95582	95582	I	0	” “
95666	95674	95582	95582	I	0	” cried Hamlin , with a shudder , “
95699	95700	95683	95683	you	2421	” “
95706	95718	95683	95683	you	2421	” went on Anne , a coldness coming all over her . “
95744	95745	95683	95683	you	2421	” “
95750	95758	95683	95683	you	2421	” said Hamlin , mixing his paints . “
95773	95774	95683	95683	you	2421	” “
95782	95786	95683	95683	you	2421	” cried Anne . “
95872	95937	95855	95855	they	2448	” The difficulty of saying it had vanished ; Anne felt that , whether she would or would not , it must come out . Her voice had kept steady , but died out in terrible hoarseness ; and her wide‐opened eyes fixed themselves upon Hamlin . Hamlin let his hand with the palette drop on his knee , and listened with deep attention . “
95942	95946	95855	95855	they	2448	” he said ; “
95954	95955	95855	95855	they	2448	” “
95960	95964	95855	95855	they	2448	” cried Anne . “
96036	96112	96114	96114	you	0	” Anne had not the slightest thought of being eloquent , but she was , not only in her words , but in her face and look . Hamlin appreciated it ; he was struck . Such a view of evil and of fate had never presented itself to him ; he recognised how much newer and grander it was than the usual platitude about fatal passion in which he and his school had indulged . “
96120	96128	96114	96114	you	0	” he asked , with some interest . “
96198	96206	96186	96186	she	376	” Hamlin did not seem to attend . “
96212	96214	96186	96186	she	376	” he mused—“all
96270	96326	96327	96328	Mrs Collett	376	” A sickening fear came over Anne . But she drove it from her : she tried to say to herself that she had expected this ; that Hamlin , being unaccustomed to any serious thought of the evil of others , and being a poet , would at first take things in this way . “
96452	96464	96472	96472	my	0	” The word factory seemed to sear into Hamlin ’s nerves . “
96489	96494	96472	96472	my	0	” he cried indignantly . “
96503	96509	96472	96472	my	0	” said Anne , sternly . “
96564	96571	96612	96613	Cold Fremley	380	” Hamlin seemed moved and puzzled . “
96577	96581	96582	96582	I	0	” he mused . “
96637	96641	96634	96634	I	0	” he added , “
96709	96719	96721	96721	you	2479	” Against this Anne felt it useless to struggle . “
96739	96744	96721	96721	you	2479	” she went on , “
96814	96820	96783	96784	every one	4712	” invocated Anne in despair , “
96869	96870	96875	96875	you	2479	” “
96895	96901	96875	96875	you	2479	” answered Hamlin , coldly . “
96905	96910	96913	96913	you	0	” cried Anne , blazing up—“not
96924	96939	96913	96913	you	0	” The words were scarcely out of her mouth when she repented of them . “
96942	96947	96913	96913	you	0	” she added sullenly , “
96955	96969	96913	96913	you	0	” Hamlin did not answer ; he was taken by surprise , embarrassed . “
96996	96997	97000	97000	you	0	” “
97103	97104	97094	97094	you	0	” “
97114	97120	97111	97112	Miss Brown	171	” answered Hamlin , quietly ; “
97144	97212	97216	97216	mine	145	” He had wasted all this on her , and the people on his estate lived in foul , sinful hovels ! A strange gratitude , mixed with horror , overcame Anne ; all the beautiful things about her,—her beautiful fantastic dress , which Hamlin always designed for her , her knowledge and good‐breeding,—all that had been paid for with that money , became loathsome to her . “
97231	97233	97223	97225	a mere beggar	2492	” she exclaimed—“living
97414	97441	97398	97398	you	2500	” Hamlin smiled ; he admired and disbelieved ; but what a magnificent woman she was ! what passion , what fervour under that cold exterior ! “
97449	97463	97398	97398	you	2500	” he said gently , looking at Anne with admiring and loving eyes . “
97492	97493	97495	97495	you	2500	” “
97508	97541	97502	97502	You	2500	” He was good and generous at bottom — she knew it ; and she could have fallen on her knees and cried like a child with her head upon his arm . “
97549	97555	97542	97542	I	0	” he answered with alacrity . “
97570	97571	97562	97562	I	0	” “
97581	97589	97574	97574	you	0	” asked Anne , suddenly and terribly ; “
97601	97602	97603	97603	I	0	” “
97611	97629	97603	97603	I	0	” answered Hamlin , who felt no shame for doing so , and resented being thus reproved . “
97707	97729	97731	97731	you	2504	” he went on gently , but with that tone of knowledge of the evil of the world which Anne so much hated—“of
97844	97885	97894	97894	you	2509	” Hamlin ’s eyes sparkled , and he spoke with a flush ; but there was no excitement , no horror in his tone . Anne felt that he was reciting in prose what he would soon write in verse . “
97889	97893	97894	97894	you	2509	” she said , “
97924	97939	97911	97911	You	2509	” Hamlin was a man who could not easily keep at high moral tension . “
97944	97948	97911	97911	You	2509	” he answered ; “
98015	98016	98017	98017	I	0	” “
98020	98035	98017	98017	I	0	” said Anne , faintly — everything seemed to be turning all round her ; “
98038	98039	98017	98017	I	0	” “
98048	98059	98060	98060	You	2509	” said Hamlin , following her to the studio door . “
98103	98425	98426	98426	She	2513	” Hamlin ’s voice sounded faint and distant to Anne , hollow like an echo in a whispering chamber . She went mechanically up‐stairs ; she did not know how she felt , but everything seemed surrounded by thick , clammy horror ; the world was going to pieces . When she had shut the door of her room behind her , she threw herself with her face on her bed , and burst into an agony of half‐audible sobs . But when at length hours passed , and the maid came to ask whether she would come to tea , Anne felt no better ; a black despair weighed upon her . On her dressing‐table stood a Japanese jar , filled with delicate autumnal roses ; they had the pallor , the diaphanous purity which the frost gives to flowers , as approaching death gives it sometimes to human creatures . Anne looked at them ; and then , without passion or excitement , she took them out of the vase , and threw them into the fire . She watched the petals shrivel and fall to black dust on the flame , and the leaves and stalks turn slowly , with a hissing noise , into glowing embers . Then she felt ashamed . The poor flowers were pure — they at least were clean — and she had destroyed them . And Anne buried her head in her hands , and began to sob once more . THE Leigh girls never discovered which of them was in the right ; and as Anne never made any further allusion to Cold Fremley , they concluded that she had not spoken to Hamlin about it . Hamlin noticed no change in her , but then he never expected to see one : Anne became gradually more silent , more indifferent , more abrupt in her answers . Some people said , “
98437	98482	98426	98426	She	2513	” and others , like Thaddy O’Reilly , hinted that the vagaries and splendours of æsthetic society , the poems and music and improprieties of Chough and Dennistoun , the nudities and Elizabethan dramatists of Lewis , were beginning to pall upon Miss Brown . “
98488	98493	98426	98426	She	2513	” said Thaddy O’Reilly , “
98532	100347	100348	100348	I	0	” So said Thaddy O’Reilly ; but it must be added that he said it to Mrs Spencer , to alarm and anger whose hereditary high‐art passions was the little journalist ’s great delight . Anne still went out into æsthetic society , she still listened to new poems and to literary discussions , she still sat to Hamlin and to half‐a‐dozen other painters ; but when people at concerts or the play used to point out Miss Brown as the queen of æstheticism , they little guessed how far removed were the thoughts of this queen from her realm and her subjects . Ever since that memorable conversation about Cold Fremley , beautiful things,—all the things — poetry , painting , music , romance — which had originally surrounded Hamlin with a sort of luminous emanation in Anne ’s eyes,—had grown loathsome to her . She knew that it was unfair and absurd , but she could not resist the feeling that all the fair forms and sound patterns and imaginary passions of poetry — nay , that the very beauty of nature , where any existed — were foul ; and her soul shrank from them as from contamination . She began to take a grim pleasure in that sordid ugliness which had , on her arrival in London , given her such a shock , and to which Hamlin and his friends were always shutting their eyes . The fog , the black ooze , the melancholy monotony of griminess , the hideousness of the men and women in the streets , jarred upon her much less than the beautiful pictures of Italian scenery which Hamlin hung up at Hammersmith,—than the lovely , mysterious creatures in jewel‐coloured robes , wandering in distant countries of bliss and romance , which Hamlin painted . The poetry of pure beauty sickened her ; and she could not take up even the purest poems of that school , not even the mere charming pieces of decoration of Morris , without putting them down with disgust . She began to feel a vague nostalgic longing after her own past : faint recollections of her father ’s grimy , workshop at Spezia , of the poor little room where her mother had sat doing cheap dressmaking , returned to her . The life at Florence , the sordid life with the Perrys , the tattered furniture and ill‐swept rooms , the dirty and noisy kitchen with the haunting smell of sink ; the dull routine of washing and ironing and mending , of dressing and undressing the refractory children , of teaching them their letters and trying to keep them tidy ; the ill‐will , the muttered anger , the jeering scraps of song of the other servants , who resented Anne ’s superiority,—all these recollections which had almost been effaced during her happy new life at Coblenz and in London , returned to her , vivid as reality , and filled her with unaccountable yearning . And yet , when she asked herself what this meant , she could not but confess that she was different from what she had then been ; that she had absorbed too much of the new life ever to be happy in the old one — nay , that that very indignation with the mere selfish worship of beauty which made all things seem black in her eyes , would never have been possible had she remained a mere servant . Hamlin had redeemed her soul ; he had made her a thinking and feeling being — but what for ? She dared not admit to herself that it was merely in order that she should despise him . But Anne pushed aside these thoughts . She felt that she had no right to indulge in them — that she must give her mind to other things , her heart and her energy . Without exactly knowing what she could do , or even whether she could do anything at all , she felt that she must work — work with all her might ; for it seemed as if all the thoughts which the people about her refused to think , all the sympathy which they refused to feel , all the work which they refused to do , and all the sacrifices which they refused to make , must all be taken upon herself — as if she alone must bear this terrible weight of rejected responsibilities . So Anne worked . Her cousin Dick had said that no one could do any good in ignorance ; and she felt herself shamefully ignorant of all but useless things . She got together a whole heap of books and pamphlets on every possible kind of grievance and evil in the world ; she made Marjory Leigh tell her all the dreadful things which she knew , show her all the dreadful things which she had seen . Of such things Marjory and her young man , the East End curate , could tell her but too many ; yet Anne was not satisfied . She sought the acquaintance of Marjory ’s colleagues in the work of helping the poor , and of Harry Collett ’s fellow‐workers — older men and women , whose account of the evil of the world , less exaggerated and poetical than Marjory ’s and Harry ’s , was still more grimly tragic . They were hopeful nevertheless ; but Anne , returning home from her attendance on lectures , her ghastly rounds in the slums,—home to the lovely house , with the Persian carpets , the 18th‐century hangings and furniture , the old majolica and Japanese ware , the flowers and the books of music,—returning home to the discussions on art and literature in Hamlin ’s studio and at her own dinner‐table,—Anne felt mere despair . For , it must be remembered , Anne had none of those consoling thoughts to fall back upon which religion , however conventional , affords . Her father , a Radical workman of the French school , had brought her up with a few elementary ideas of right and wrong , and the faith that all priests , like all kings , were the curse of the world . Miss Curzon , the kind‐hearted old prima donna who had taken charge of her in her earliest girlhood , had given her examples of only the most frivolous Voltairianism ; from the servants and the Italians who surrounded her at the Perrys , she had learned only a contempt for the conscienceless mummeries of the lowest Catholicism ; from Mrs Perry only a contempt , as great in its way , for the heartless conventionalism of mere social Protestantism ; and from Hamlin himself , and Hamlin ’s friends ( for at Coblenz he had stipulated that Miss Brown was not to be bored with religion ) , she had heard only of the religion of beauty . Of the men and women who used to come to Hammersmith and to Wotton , some , like Chough , professed Catholicism , and wrote mystical rhapsodies to the Virgin Mary ; others , like Dennistoun , called the Virgin a prostitute , and God a highway murderer : some went in for imitating the näiveté of medieval Christianity ; yet others filled their books with hymns to the gods , clean and foul , of paganism . There was a deal of vociferating on the subject ; a deal of abusive language both of the religious and the irreligious ; a deal of exhortation on the part of men like Hamlin not to have the bad taste to muddle religion with poetry ; and on the whole , there was an atmosphere of absolute insincerity , in which , as in abstract politics ( for certain æsthetes were extreme retrogrades , and loathed civilisation ; while others would pour out by the hour revolutionary tirades of the most blood‐thirsty description ) , it appeared that religion was a mere personal hobby or poetical fiction : the usual conclusion being simply that the world was too disgusting a place for a well‐constituted soul ; that the century was empty , and heartless , and emasculate ; and that , as the people in the ‘ Decameron ’ fled from the plague , and told stories and sang songs in a pleasant villa all by themselves , so also must superior men and women fly from the sordidness , the uninterestingness , the mediocrity , and incapacity for passion of reality , and entertain one another with tales of romance and wonder in a fairy land , where the sole divinity was beauty , and where alone , among the lovely and noble things left by the past , noble natures could develop uncramped , according to the ideal of the Greeks , of medieval men , or of that most elevated genius , the late Théophile Gautier . To meet the terrible realities which were now being revealed to her , to answer her own painful craving after usefulness , Anne had therefore only a vain negative belief — the pessimism which is at the bottom of all æstheticism , the belief in the fatal supremacy of evil and ugliness . But in Anne this purely negative creed speedily became positive ; pessimism produced not a desire to abandon the odious reality and take refuge in mere imaginary happiness , but a frightful moral tension , a constant battle of her aspirations with her belief , of her conscience with her reason , a strain of rebellion against the inevitable . So , to the weight of the knowledge of evil , to the weight of the consciousness of the deadness of soul which surrounded her , was added in Anne the terrible sense of the injustice and callousness of nature and of fate , of the groundlessness of those instincts of good which left her no peace . But all this no one ever guessed . She despised indulging her own wretchedness . She went on , behaving as usual , goading herself to practical concerns silently , letting no one know of her misery , letting no thought of it waste a moment of her time . Her longing was to break the hateful solidarity between herself and the school of æsthetic indifferentism ; her instinct was , since she ( dependent as she felt herself on a man ’s charity ) could not practically help others , at least to understand and feel about all these subjects which Hamlin and his friends tabooed . And with this haunting desire , she turned not merely to Marjory Lee and Harry Collett , but instinctively also to her cousin Dick . “
100362	100378	100348	100348	I	0	” she said , giving him back the various primers and pamphlets on economical subjects . “
100388	100447	100386	100386	Dick	379	” They were sitting alone in the drawing‐room at Hammersmith . Richard Brown had called only once before , ceremoniously and briefly , and he would not have come this time either , if Anne had not written expressly to beg him to fetch back the books . He looked at her in his incredulous , contemptuous way . “
100450	100454	100386	100386	Dick	379	” he said , “
100479	100511	100548	100548	I	0	” and he looked round the room at the pieces of embroidery and the Eastern carpets , the pictures and drawings , the quantities of Japanese porcelain and lacquer all round . “
100551	100552	100548	100548	I	0	” “
100560	100566	100567	100567	he	145	” said Anne , quickly ; “
100593	100594	100585	100585	I	0	” “
100608	100648	100605	100605	I	0	” went on Brown , with his placid sneer , which seemed , in this frightfully masculine man , to condemn in Anne her mind , her person , her manner , her character , and even her sex . “
100781	100785	100794	100794	you	0	” Anne frowned . “
100789	100793	100794	100794	you	0	” she said , “
100851	100894	100895	100895	You	0	” Richard Brown bit his black beard , and looked at Anne from beneath his beetle brows ; he threw himself a little back on his chair , and with his head on one side , he said , with affected indifference — “
100934	100935	100932	100932	Anne	171	” “
100986	100994	100995	100995	I	0	” Brown was silent for a moment . “
101018	101020	100995	100995	I	0	papers”—he said crushingly—“and
101033	101034	101035	101035	I	0	” “
101147	101192	101197	101197	your	0	” and she fixed her eyes on her cousin ’s ugly and powerful face , in which , for all its ugliness , one might have fancied one saw something not wholly unlike that magnificent sibyl‐like face which pre‐Raphaelite artists had immortalised and caricatured . “
101200	101211	101197	101197	your	0	” she went on , as Brown made no reply , “
101258	101315	101319	101319	Anne	171	” Richard Brown did not answer . He was a frank man , and he frankly faced Anne ’s look , and in return looked long and searchingly at her ; and as the habitual look of bantering contempt had given way to a serious scrutiny , so now he gradually grew more gentle and earnest . “
101321	101329	101330	101330	I	0	” he said , after a moment ; “
101378	101395	101371	101371	me	0	” Brown rarely hesitated for the end of his sentence , but this time he did . “
101424	101432	101371	101371	me	0	Hamlin”—Anne finished his sentence bitterly . She went on—“Well
101487	101527	101567	101567	you	2544	” and Anne pulled the long pliable leaves of a palm passionately through her fingers . Brown ’s suspiciousness had tried to return ; but it was routed by Anne ’s firm look , by Anne ’s frank words . “
101549	101553	101567	101567	you	2544	” answered Brown , “
101604	101605	101597	101597	you	2544	” “
101611	101620	101609	101609	Dick	379	” said Anne , stretching out her hand . “
101683	101684	101685	101685	I	0	” “
101704	101721	101722	101722	you	2544	” said Brown — that sneer of conscious masculinity and conscious self‐madeness coming over him again ; “
101730	101745	101728	101728	Anne	171	” But he met Anne ’s glance , and his tone changed once more . “
101757	101761	101746	101746	I	0	” he said . “
101773	101774	101767	101767	you	2544	” “
101788	101798	101786	101786	Hegel	2550	” Anne stopped short , and then boldly added — “
101810	101814	101807	101807	you	0	” Brown smiled . “
101828	101832	101807	101807	you	0	” he said ; “
101854	102536	101852	101852	Good‐bye	393	” After that visit , Anne began to see more of her cousin . He came sometimes to Hammersmith , and he met her frequently at the Leighs . Anne did not feel that she completely liked him . He was pure‐minded , certainly , and generous , a man devoted to progress even in its humblest forms ; he had a powerful intellect and a more powerful will . But , somehow , there was in him an indefinable coarseness of fibre , a want of appreciation , of sympathy with other people ’s ideals , a tendency to despise all those around him , and to see meanness in all those who were not in the same position , or who had not the same views and aims as himself ; above all , an unconscious desire to domineer — a brutal , almost animal wish for supremacy , which his knowledge of his own purity and rectitude and self‐sacrificing power made him accept and cherish as if it were a kind of holy spirit dwelling within himself , and not merely the product of a brutal temperament , which a noble intellect and a generous heart had severed from all brutish interests , but which remained brutal none the less . Anne ’s pride , her consciousness of finer fibre than her cousin ’s , made her shrink from seeking in Richard Brown for assistance in her arduous task of freeing her spirit from the slough of æsthetic selfishness ; his suspiciousness of her motives , his sarcasms , his blindness to her purity of impulse , all this galled her ; but she submitted to be galled . She wished her soul at least to be free , though her body might remain , as it were , in bondage , and Richard stood at the door of that world of nobler endeavour which she longed to enter ; moreover , her stern spirit made her take a sort of pleasure in the very bitterness which she had to taste . If Richard had been sympathising , if he had met her half‐way and tried to help her on , she would have felt that she was bound to him , that she was battering her liberty once more ; and vaguely Anne knew that she must never be bound to any one save Hamlin — that little as he could understand her , she was obliged , for ever , to try and understand him . And sometimes even , though the sense of Hamlin ’s baseness , of his selfish æstheticism and his untruthful morbidness , weighed more upon her day by day , Anne would elaborately go over all that he had been to her — nay , all that , to the best of his power , he still was : she would sit for hours reading and re‐reading those treasured‐up letters whose arrival had made her so strangely happy at Coblenz ; ( how long , long ago it seemed , and how little that schoolgirl seemed to share of her identity ! ) and Anne , reading over those letters , carefully collecting together all the stances of Hamlin ’s generosity and delicacy and gentleness which she could remember — nay , mere looks and tones which had brought home formerly her love for him — made up out of them a simulacrum of Hamlin , and persuaded herself that she loved it , and that it was Hamlin ’s real reality , the reality which had become spoilt by the horrible moral atmosphere , distorted , warped , but a reality nevertheless . Nay , sometimes the sense of Hamlin ’s weakness would come home to her , and with a pang make her feel how much she was bound to suffer , how much she was bound to do for him . HAMLIN had forgotten all about the business of Cold Fremley , except that he had stopped the printing of his book , and set to work remodelling the “
102542	102965	102966	102966	She	2551	” to the immense admiration of Chough and Dennistoun , who were quite reconciled to realism now that it was allied with horrid sin . But that Anne was at all alienated from him , never once entered his mind . He noticed , indeed , that Anne had grown much more serious of late , that she seemed less happy than some months before ; but for that he had his explanation . He believed that her character was suddenly maturing ( for he never guessed that Anne ’s nature was one of those which mature rapidly , and whose maturity means responsibility ) , and that there was brewing beneath that sombre exterior a storm of passion of which he was the object . That such a storm would come had been his persuasion from the very beginning of his acquaintance with Anne ; he had guessed in her some strange latent force , and to see it develop had been his wish . That long courtship , that purely Platonic familiarity , giving scope to so much poetic devotion , poetic gratitude , was always to end , in Hamlin ’s expectation , with a sudden burst of passion , which should envelop him , give his cold nature the exquisite sensation of being fired , carried off by a more powerful temperament than his own . Hamlin had had many love‐affairs in his day , more or less pure or base ; he had , once or twice , been mastered by the stronger nature of a woman , but that had been mere brute passion , and what he desired was to rouse a passion terrifically overwhelming , but pure , intellectual , and with all the fearful violence of merely intellectual passions : a passion like that , which he always admired more than any other in literature , of Heathcliff for Catharine in ‘ Wuthering Heights,’—a passion such as some men have felt for a dead woman . This he had always hoped from Anne , and in the expectation of this he had been confirmed by every new revelation of her character . Sometimes , when Anne sat listless in the midst of their guests , her mind for away , her tragic face more sombre for the blackness that was in the world around her and in her own soul , Hamlin would watch her , and feel , with a pang of satisfaction , that he had not been mistaken in her . “
102979	103059	103060	103060	She	2551	” Lewis had once exclaimed angrily , as he felt how utterly all that kind of occult sensual fascination , which his pale mysterious face , his vermilion lips , his cat‐like green eyes , his low droning voice , his sultan‐like freedom of manner , his sense of omniscience and omnipotence , his own nature , strangely compounded of the beast and of the dreamer , indubitably exercised over many women , how utterly it trickled off Anne — “
103088	103089	103083	103083	you	396	” “
103105	103111	103113	103113	she	2551	” answered Hamlin , contemptuously ; “
103292	103299	103289	103290	a barmaid	2562	” Edmund Lewis ’s lip curled . “
103419	103420	103427	103427	Lewis	353	” “
103429	103433	103427	103427	Lewis	353	” said Hamlin . “
103477	103575	103474	103475	Miss Brown	171	” Chough had been listening . The excitable little poet of womanhood detested Lewis , whose arrogance grated upon him , and whose impurity of nature unconsciously offended the real innocence which underlay all his grandiloquently improper verses . And Chough adored Anne ; she was , he often said , a quite new revelation of womanhood ; and he believed that , as passion was the one noble thing in the world , and as Miss Brown was the noblest woman that had ever lived , that there must be a deal of passion in Anne . “
103583	103593	103474	103475	Miss Brown	171	” said Chough , pulling his long black whiskers ; “
103682	103683	103684	103684	Idiot	2576	” “
103686	103967	103684	103684	Idiot	2576	” muttered Hamlin ; and yet he felt pleased at Chough ’s mystical corroboration of his ideas . Meanwhile there was one subject upon which Anne sympathised warmly with Hamlin , and that was his cousin Sacha . For all her evident theatricalness , Anne warmed towards Madame Elaguine . She saw in her something frank and fearless which appealed to her , and a pathetic helpless desire , as of a child which has been naughty but wants to learn how to be good , to retrieve her own wasted life , to save her children from what she had undergone herself ; above all , a wish to be in earnest without well knowing how to , a strain to be a serious woman in the midst of the habits of a spoilt child and of a flirt . For a spoilt child , unaccustomed to self‐control , impatient of small sacrifices , avid of excitement and novelty , avid of constant attention and admiration , Madame Elaguine certainly was ; and a flirt as certainly also . She flirted with every one , with Hamlin , with as many of his friends — Chough , Lewis , and Dennistoun — as he took to her ; with Anne , with the Leigh girls , with the solemn schoolmasters and schoolmistresses , whom she interviewed for the benefit of her children ; she flirted — you saw it by her smile and her little childish laugh of recognition — with the very housemaid who opened the door ; she flirted with every man , woman , and child , with every dog or cat that she came across . “
103979	104034	103969	103972	a flirt that woman	2577	” cried Hamlin , as he saw every one of his and Anne ’s friends subjugated in an hour ’s visit by Madame Elaguine . And to be a flirt was no recommendation to Hamlin ; he wanted to absorb all admiration , he wanted to inspire love ; flirts were his particular aversion . “
104042	104046	103969	103972	a flirt that woman	2577	” answered Anne ; “
104059	104060	104061	104061	I	0	” “
104085	104086	104076	104076	you	0	” “
104091	104109	104088	104088	I	0	serious”—and poor Anne felt at the moment that she certainly was too serious to be very happy ; “
104157	104250	104251	104251	Your	2585	” For experience had taught Anne the bitter truth that people could be serious — heaven knows how serious!—like the odious Lewis and like Hamlin himself , and yet have no fibre of sympathy or indignation ; and her experience of flippant little Chough , with his tenderly cared for wife — of flirtatious Marjory Leigh and her humanitarian labours — had made her hope most from the very people whose light nature she , so earnest and tragic , could understand least . And to this category she added Madame Elaguine . “
104265	104515	104260	104260	I	0	” she said . Hamlin shrugged his shoulders ; but nevertheless , though he highly resented Madame Elaguine ’s all‐round flirtatiousness , he was forced to admit to himself that the little woman had , when you were in her presence , a sort of magnetic fascination . What moved Anne was Madame Elaguine ’s vehement passion for her children , the long schemes which , to Hamlin ’s ennui , she would enthusiastically dilate upon for their future ; and somehow , from words which she used to drop , it would seem that she had been in danger of losing those children — that she was still exposed to having them taken from her , or to being in some way separated from them . Anne did not absolutely formulate to herself a hope of helping Madame Elaguine ; but she felt vaguely that perhaps she , with her seriousness and determination , might help the excitable and decidedly vague‐minded little woman to persist in and carry out her ideas ; that here she had at last a chance of being useful . The first thing , Anne felt , was to bridge over the gulf of past animosity which still separated Hamlin from his cousin — to take away from Sacha Elaguine the demoralising sense of being an only half‐forgiven intruder . The great difficulty was Mrs Macgregor . The old lady could not abate one tittle of her hatred for the Sacha of former days . “
104537	104543	104516	104516	I	0	” she would answer Anne . “
104576	104577	104573	104573	Schopenhauer	400	” “
104583	104587	104580	104581	Auntie Claudia	401	” persisted Anne , “
104637	104638	104640	104640	one	620	” “
104667	104678	104679	104679	I	0	” And Mrs Macgregor looked with cynical compassion at Anne . “
104696	104700	104689	104690	every one	4712	” answered Anne . “
104759	104760	104729	104729	I	0	” “
104796	104797	104798	104798	I	0	” “
104859	104860	104844	104844	I	0	” “
104984	104985	104964	104964	you	401	” “
105054	105055	105057	105057	you	401	” “
105097	105194	105195	105195	I	0	” So Anne had her way . And Madame Elaguine came often to Hammersmith . Hamlin and Anne did their best to prevent her meeting Mrs Macgregor ; Madame Elaguine was received mainly in the studio , where , little by little , and at first seemingly casually , Hamlin ’s friends would drop in to meet her . She was a curiously fascinating little woman . Education , in any regular sense , she seemed never to have had ; she was grotesquely ignorant about a great many things , and laughed at it herself . “
105214	105406	105195	105195	I	0	” she would say — or spelling , or grammar , or something similar . On the other hand , she had a lot of superficial accomplishments , like most Russians : she spoke four or five languages with tolerable correctness and extraordinary fluency ; she had , in some mysterious manner , acquired Greek . She read little , and that little mainly novels and poetry ; but , with her Russian rapidity to adapt herself to a new position , she had scarcely realised that she had been accidentally drafted into æsthetical society , before she had got æsthetic literature , æsthetic gossip , and æsthetic modes of feeling at her finger‐ends . She immediately understood the relative positions of Hamlin , of Chough , of Dennistoun , of Lewis , and of all the others ; and was able to talk to each as he best liked to be talked to . She began with a passion for Alfred de Musset , for Gautier , for Catulle Mendès , and she rapidly became an enthusiast for Swinburne , for Rossetti , for Chough , and , above all , “
105415	105514	105195	105195	I	0	” She let herself be talked to about æsthetic dresses , gravely listening ( with only a little side‐look of amusement at Hamlin or Anne ) to Mrs Spencer ’s strictures on modern costumes , on stays , and heels , and tight waists and full skirts ; and she immediately set to work untrimming her frocks and making them up into wondrous garments , not at all like what any æsthetic woman had ever worn in her life , but queer , fantastic , delightful , neither Greek nor medieval , but individual and quaint and fascinating . “
105534	105718	105719	105719	She	0	” she would say , when any one admired the capricious garments , in which she looked sometimes like a schoolgirl , and sometimes like a page in woman ’s clothes , and sometimes almost like a little nun . But this was not the case . Without ever having learned , she sang with wonderful charm : a small , childish , high voice , which trilled out Russian and Spanish and French folk‐songs , and which had a strange , hot , passionate power of singing those German songs which poor Anne , for all her fine voice ( which Chough used distressingly to compare with that of various equivocal singers of former days ) and her conscientious learning , could never succeed in rendering . But the fact was that Madame Elaguine ’s personality was surrounded by a vague halo and shimmer of talents : she had never learned to do anything , yet she could somehow do everything ; she could write fearfully misspelt but fascinating letters and bits of verse and prose ; she could mimic and act . “
105725	105754	105719	105719	She	0	” was one of the first things which Edmund Lewis , who seemed at once singularly attracted and puzzled by her , found to say about Madame Elaguine . “
105768	105798	105759	105759	she	0	” answered Hamlin , who never cared much to hear his cousin praised , since everything which was praised in her seemed to point to a deficiency in Anne . “
105810	105819	105801	105801	she	0	” answered Lewis , in his positive way . “
105841	105842	105843	105849	A nice little kittenish , intelligent flirt	2623	” “
105863	105872	105855	105861	a hundred Russian women one has known	2624	” said Hamlin . Lewis shook his head . “
105899	105900	105889	105889	she	1707	” “
105915	105921	105912	105913	Mr Lewis	364	” said Anne , scornfully . “
105934	105935	105926	105926	you	0	” “
105948	106113	105943	105943	I	0	” and he gave Anne one of those looks of fierce aversion which , loathing him as she did , she rather liked from the little painter . However , Lewis proved right this time . Madame Elaguine had scarcely ever heard about spiritualism , but she threw herself into it with all her Russian ardour , and in a very short time , under Lewis ’s guidance , became a great adept . Lewis declared that he had never met so gifted a medium in his life ; and , indeed , Madame Elaguine showed a perfectly marvellous power of going off into trances , reading thoughts , and otherwise communicating with spirit‐land . A young doctor , one of Marjory Leigh ’s hygienic demigods , whom she brought to call on Anne , once met Madame Elaguine at Hammersmith . Anne noticed the way in which he watched her face and manner ; she seemed somehow to interest him as a problem . “
106125	106135	106116	106116	you	2631	” asked Marjory Leigh when the Russian had left . “
106140	106147	106116	106116	you	2631	” answered the Professor , vaguely . “
106159	106163	106148	106148	She	2615	” said Anne ; “
106171	106172	106164	106164	I	0	” “
106175	106187	106164	106164	I	0	” said the young doctor , a rough , brusque creature , “
106217	106218	106221	106221	you	0	” “
106226	106232	106221	106221	you	0	” said Anne , quickly . “
106256	106257	106239	106239	she	2615	” “
106267	106272	106239	106239	she	2615	” exclaimed the doctor . “
106339	106340	106341	106341	She	2641	” “
106366	106370	106344	106345	Mr Lewis	364	” answered Anne . “
106380	106381	106378	106378	myself	0	” “
106426	106427	106423	106424	that lady	2641	” “
106431	106435	106423	106424	that lady	2641	” hesitated Anne , “
106461	106462	106466	106466	they	2644	” “
106492	106936	106481	106485	only one , depraved ancestor	2645	” The recollection of all she had heard of Sacha ’s horrible profligate old Russian father , of her violent and weak and constantly ailing mother , flashed across Anne . And then came also the remembrance of those portraits at Wotton Hall — of those generations of weak and depraved planters , who had been the grandfathers and granduncles of Sacha as well as of Hamlin . And any remaining ill‐will which Mrs Macgregor ’s stories had left was swept away . Anne did not like Madame Elaguine , in the same way that she liked the Leighs or even Mrs Spencer ; but she felt a sudden strong compassion for her . Perhaps , she thought , there is more goodness in the world than I guessed . And it seemed to her that this giddy little woman , with her passionate desire for the welfare of her children , this woman who had struggled through the disadvantages of hereditary weakness and corrupt training , was a sort of a hero . AUTUMN turned to winter , and at last Hamlin ’s long‐expected , much‐talked‐of book of new poems made its appearance . In her gradual estrangement from Hamlin , in the gradual replacing of the ideal creature whom she had so fervently loved by a reality by which she was beginning to be repelled , Anne had hung some of her last hopes to Hamlin ’s poetry . She would often say to herself that , after all , Hamlin made no pretence to being anything more than an artistic nature ; that he was a great artist , born to give the world a certain amount of pleasure , and that she had no right to ask of him to be anything else . What could she , willing as she was to sympathise and to work,—what could a man like Richard Brown , with all his self‐sacrificing energy and ability , do for mankind that might compare with what had been done by Leonardo , by Mozart , by Keats — men as solely artistic as Hamlin ? and Hamlin was a great poet , and would become a greater one — of that Anne felt persuaded , for his work was steadily improving , and there were things in this book which she recognised as having the highest merit . So she clung to Hamlin ’s poetry as to an anchor for his nobility and for her affection . At length the volume was published . Hamlin arrived at Hammersmith one morning and placed a copy of it by the side of Anne ’s plate at breakfast . “
106943	106947	106481	106485	only one , depraved ancestor	2645	” he said , “
106956	106957	106481	106485	only one , depraved ancestor	2645	” “
106961	107026	106959	106959	you	2648	” said Anne , flushing with pleasure ; for , opening the book , she found on the fly‐leaf a little poem , imitated from the love‐songs of the Tuscan peasants , in which Hamlin dedicated the volume to her ; it was beautiful and simple and almost solemn — the very flower of that distant and poetic love which he professed towards her . “
107065	107081	107060	107060	you	2648	” she exclaimed . Hamlin did not answer ; perhaps because he was aware that this “
107087	107181	107182	107182	I	0	” rewritten under the influence of Dennistoun , was not the same as the one which he had torn up three months before . Anne soon discovered it : reading through the still uncut sheets , she found that instead of the story of married love , which had called down the wrath of the whole school , Hamlin had set in his beautiful descriptions a ghastly tale which she scarcely required more than to glance at . So this was all that had come of her having mentioned Cold Fremley to him ! “
107230	107231	107227	107227	you	2649	” “
107234	107397	107227	107227	you	2649	” said Anne , icily . There was the description of the sunset on the fens , of the broad slow river flowing between low green banks , its clotted masses reflecting the red sunset embers ; the description of the whole scene as they had witnessed it ; and then a description of the people of Cold Fremley , of their lives and sins , in which she could almost recognise her own words in which she had vainly pleaded for them that memorable afternoon in his studio . A cold terror prevented Anne from turning at once to the sonnets . But after all , had he not , as it were , promised to abide by her choice ? had he not submitted , however reluctantly , to the condemnation of those twelve sonnets ? Anne felt ashamed of her own suspicions and fears ; she boldly turned to the end of the book , peeped between the leaves — “
107404	107527	107227	107227	you	2649	” Anne did not know what was the feeling which filled her . She had never felt it before . It was too cold to be indignation , too self‐possessed to be horror : she seemed surrounded by an icy atmosphere , through which she saw Hamlin as through a mist . He had broken his word , and for what ? To attribute to himself vicious thoughts and feelings which he had never had . Anne said not a word ; the man who was capable of acting thus could not understand if he were chidden for it . Breakfast passed gloomily , talking little , or of indifferent things . Hamlin was evidently ruffled by this reception of his book . “
107541	107554	107555	107555	I	0	” he asked with some irritation , as he rose from table . “
107564	107581	107559	107559	you	2650	” Anne ’s voice smote him as if he had opened the window to a snowstorm . “
107589	107590	107591	107591	I	0	” “
107616	107617	107613	107614	Marjory Leigh	249	” “
107672	107673	107657	107657	she	4336	” “
107676	107789	107657	107657	she	4336	” answered Anne . Anne went out with Marjory Leigh , who was on a round of visiting poor people at Lainbeth . They were joined by Harry Collett . He stood in great awe of his future bride ’s superior wisdom and dogmatic manner ; but it was touching to see how completely these two creatures — the shy and mystical curate , and the masterful and rationalistic young woman , who was wo nt to tell him that some day he should be persuaded that only secular work was really useful , and the Church ought to be disestablished — understood each other , and sympathised in their best endeavours . “
107798	107804	107790	107790	Hamlin	145	” said Collett to Anne . “
107863	108005	108006	108006	You	2657	” Anne did not answer . She felt alone — alone as in a desert , without an ear to hear her , or a hand to touch hers . Often did that sensation recur to her now ; a sensation as of dragging wearily and alone along an ice‐bound road , under a grey wintry sky , weary and solitary , but with the knowledge that the more solitary and weary she felt , the more was she bound to plod on . Things that happened seemed spectral . Here in London she saw less of Hamlin than in the country ; he was going about with his friends , he was at his cousin ’s . She did not know or care where . People talked a great deal about the new book ; and only Anne was silent . “
108015	108095	108096	108096	You	2657	” said Richard Brown to her one evening , fixing his eyes upon her in his ruthless way . He came often now ; he had apparently got to believe in her , and he even held out a possibility to her , if she continued to work steadily , reading and attending lectures , that she might by the summer‐time be able to offer herself to teach the elements of political economy at the Working Women ’s Club . “
108105	108124	108096	108096	You	2657	” It was not a question , but an assertion , and Anne felt it as a taunt . “
108133	108138	108125	108125	I	0	” she answered boldly ; “
108148	108163	108140	108140	I	0	” Brown made a characteristic upward movement with one of his big black eyebrows . “
108186	108187	108167	108167	you	2657	” “
108215	108216	108221	108221	Hamlin	145	” “
108234	108266	108267	108267	He	145	” For a moment Anne did not answer . Brown ’s question was like an insolent attempt to see into her heart . Yet what right had she to hide anything ? “
108293	108342	108279	108279	he	145	” She was determined to keep her cousin at a distance . He had hated her ever becoming connected with æsthetic society , and he tried to force her to admit that she regretted it . But Brown had an inveterate hatred which he could not put aside . “
108355	108418	108344	108344	you	2660	” he asked . The review was one of the few bad ones which Hamlin ’s book had had , among a chorus of good ones . But it was written by a rabid enemy of pre‐Raphaelite poetry ; and who had taken the occasion of this book to show up what he considered the pestilent moral condition of the whole school . “
108437	108438	108446	108446	it	2661	” “
108469	108470	108466	108466	you	2660	” “
108474	108486	108471	108471	I	0	” answered Anne slowly , and choking her pride and emotion , “
108547	108561	108562	108562	he	2662	” she added , as if to put an end to the conversation , “
108581	108649	108650	108650	She	2668	” Brown did not press the conversation . He understood . He had of late been getting to comprehend Anne ’s character ; he recognised her serious unselfishness , her indomitable desire for good ; he saw in her a strange straining dissatisfaction — a something which was as the beating of a bird ’s wings against its cage . And now he understood whence it came . “
108661	108690	108650	108650	She	2668	” he said sternly to himself , remembering that scene when he had tried vainly to dissuade her from accepting Hamlin ’s offer , and she had answered , “
108695	108696	108693	108693	him	2669	” “
108718	108754	108755	108756	Poor child	4378	” But then , as he said good night and looked at that noble face , whose tragic intensity of rectitude was now revealed to him , Richard Brown could not help feeling a pang . “
108758	109280	108755	108756	Poor child	4378	” he said to himself ; and wished he had proved less of a prophet than he believed himself to have done . He began , in consequence , to feel a little ashamed of himself , and came oftener to see Anne . He was a brilliant man when you got him on his own subjects , warm‐hearted , self‐sacrificing , ambitious , eloquent ; and he had always a number of practical schemes at heart . Originally a hand at a foundry , he had for some time , like Anne ’s father , been smitten with communistic theories ; but instead of being tempted into becoming a socialistic demagogue , he had , when he was about twenty‐five , given up the little workman ’s newspaper , of which he was editor and chief author , and deliberately set to work studying economical and social questions in the intervals of his work , carefully suspending his judgment during the while . To a man as impetuous and ambitious as Brown , to whom the easy and tempting path of party leader lay open , such a course must have meant a terrible and long‐sustained effort of self‐control . But his indomitable conscience and will had carried him through it ; and now he was reaping the unexpected reward of his forbearance . While slowly working his way in business and studying the subjects which were dearest to him , he had managed also to cultivate a mechanical genius , which seemed in some way hereditary in the family of Anne ’s father , who , in happier circumstances , might perhaps have been a brilliant inventor instead of a starving expatriated workman . He had made valuable improvements in the foundry of which he had become the foreman , and had now , for the last two years , been the chief partner and virtual director of the business , with a fair livelihood in the present , and a large fortune and great influence in the immediate future . But money and influence were nothing to Richard Brown ; or rather , influence to him meant merely the triumph of his own philanthropical schemes . Selfish he undoubtedly was , but his selfishness , his vanity , his pride , his ambition , were drafted off into the service of others . Anne listened with enthusiasm , but not unmixed with sadness , to her cousin ’s projects for educating the lower classes , for bringing home to the upper classes their own responsibilities ; they had the charm of dreams , but of the dreams of a man who seemed able to make what he desired into reality . Even in this æsthetic society , which had looked upon him with suspicion and loathing , Richard Brown got a certain importance . He would spend hours with old Saunders the painter , and his daughter , the enthusiastic Mrs Spencer , discussing the way of introducing more beautiful patterns into trade , and of getting up schools of design and loan exhibitions for the poorer classes . “
109290	109297	109283	109288	a man of the middle ages	2673	” Mrs Spencer would enthusiastically exclaim ; “
109322	109323	109324	109324	He	2672	” “
109330	109335	109326	109328	a canny Radical	2677	” answered her father , “
109385	109574	109575	109579	that shoddy philanthropical black brute	2680	” Chough was equally enthusiastic . Richard Brown was anxious to get up some concerts at a kind of workman ’s union at which he presided ; and Chough — yes , the great Chough himself , who hinted mysteriously that his father ( who was an apothecary at Limerick ) was a duke , but that he would rather die than succeed to the title — was prevailed upon to take the musical direction upon himself . While these schemes were going on , Madame Elaguine met Richard Brown . There was something in this big , burly , rather brutal man , which immediately fascinated the nervous little Russian woman : she sat at Brown ’s feet , she listened with rapture to his theories , she threw herself headlong into the plan of the concerts ; she offered to perform , to teach , to do whatever Brown might wish . Hamlin was thoroughly disgusted with his cousin Sacha , who had hitherto known no divinity save him and pure beauty , when he saw her devoting herself to humanitarianism , personified in what he called “
109581	109608	109575	109579	that shoddy philanthropical black brute	2680	” He became vehemently devoted to Anne . He seemed to repent of his book . He declared himself sick of London and of æsthetic society . “
109617	109621	109622	109622	I	0	” he said . “
109655	109674	109654	109655	Miss Brown?”—and	407	Brown?”—and he looked at her with his slow , beautiful glance of Platonic love . Anne smiled sadly . “
109694	109785	109689	109689	I	0	” She had got so accustomed to these sudden returns of Hamlin ’s , to these false starts , these longings after a healthier moral and intellectual atmosphere , which came to nothing . She saw so plainly the hopeless weakness and thinness of his nature ; and yet in such moments she could not help feeling some of that old love for this beautiful , delicate , idealistic , chivalrous creature whom she knew to be mere selfishness and vanity . If only he would remain thus at least . “
109791	109805	109787	109787	you	2681	” answered Hamlin , leaning over the piano at which she was seated ; “
109878	109943	109955	109955	Bastien‐Lepage	408	” It was but too true . That school of mere beautiful suggestion , which scorned reality and mechanical skill as a bird scorns the ground , was fast sinking into nullity . Anne had often remarked it in comparing the works of various masters ; she had noticed the stray sentences , not meant for her , dropped by painters of other schools . “
109963	110016	109961	109961	Duran	410	” she said , with a smile at the vanity of her own words . Hamlin could not even conceive that she was in earnest , that any one could dream of seeing anything in modern French painting , that any one could be so mad as to think of his studying . “
110019	110023	110048	110048	they	2687	” he cried , “
110089	110771	110048	110048	they	2687	” And he suddenly turned round and looked at her with great yearning eyes . Hamlin was genuinely unhappy , though he did not guess that his unhappiness was due to vacuity , to slighted vanity , to the sudden infatuation of Madame Elaguine for a shoddy philanthropist . He longed for passion as , in hot climates , after months of faint sultriness , one longs for rain and wind ; and he looked at Anne as one might watch the dark clouds hanging on the hills , the dark clouds which hold the storm for which one is thirsting . Oh for a strong passion!—it would revive him , revive his art . Hamlin did not say it to himself in so many words , but he felt it . He talked long and vehemently about the necessity of going outside one ’s self , of transmuting one ’s consciousness into that of another , of having something beyond one ’s self to live for . He told Anne , always with those yearning eyes fixed upon her , that what was wanted to revive the world and art ( and by the world he meant himself ) was passion ; but not the mere sultry passion which his school had sung about , which merely enervated and sent to sleep , but the clear cold air , the whirlwinds and thunderstorms of ideal love — of love such as Dante had felt for Beatrice , and Heathcliff for Cathey . It was very eloquent and beautiful what he said about this love , which was something vague and quite unselfish and outside one ’s self,—a sort of act of adoration and purification and renunciation,—a meeting of two souls which vibrated in unison in their desire for the good and the noble . While he spoke , Anne almost believed that he was sincere ; sincere , indeed , he was , but according to his nature , not hers . She felt the tears coming into her eyes , and a vague wish to throw herself into his arms and implore him to cast aside his selfish habits , to live for the life of other men and for her love , came to her heart . But when , suddenly , their conversation was interrupted by the entry of Edmund Lewis and Madame Elaguine , it all ebbed back , till her whole nature seemed to burst . She felt that he did not know what he was saying , what he did not comprehend what he was wanting ; she felt the uselessness of saying to this man that the world and herself were waiting for him to love them , that her whole nature was sickening for want of one with which to vibrate in harmony of desire for the good and the noble . Cold Fremley , the sonnets , a hundred little words and looks which had made the chasm between them , returned to her . She felt once more alone , terribly and hopelessly alone . And still , when she met her cousin Dick , and realised how different he was , how genuine and strong and passionate for good , she could not help experiencing a sort of repulsion from him , and a melancholy , hopeless throwing of herself back on to the unreal Hamlin . She felt that Richard Brown , with all his nobility and energy of nature , would never have done for her what Hamlin had done , would never have been for her what Hamlin had been ; that he would never have singled her out , her a mere servant , and guessed that in her there was a soul which could love and could aspire . But after all , why had Hamlin singled her out ? and what had he guessed in her , what had he hoped from her ? That line of Rossetti ’s , which Hamlin admired more than any other , which he so often quoted — “
110778	110831	110048	110048	they	2687	” — returned to her with a chill ; and she felt that Hamlin wanted , expected from her that sort of passion which he had spoken of to revive him and his art . It seemed to her as if she had been sold in the slave‐market , and were being told “
110835	110898	110048	110048	they	2687	” RICHARD BROWN did not let Madame Elaguine sit at his feet very long . After about a fortnight of extremely assiduous visits at the Russian lady ’s house at Kensington , during which he poured out to the enthusiastic little woman all his philanthropical schemes , Richard suddenly gave up calling , and even avoided meeting Madame Elaguine at other houses . “
110908	111067	110901	110901	you	2690	” asked Anne of her cousin . To confess the truth , Anne was rather malicious in her question . She had speedily recognised the vanity , or rather the self‐sufficiency , the belief in his own irresistible uniqueness , which was the leaven of Cousin Dick ’s virtues , and she had been amused from the first at seeing how this earnest philanthropist had let himself be caught by Madame Elaguine ’s conscious or unconscious instinct of flirtation ; and now , she thought , Dick has suddenly awaked from his dream of having fascinated and converted her . Anne smiled as she asked the question , but there was sadness as well as amusement in her smile . In his way — his blind , self‐satisfied , unselfish way — Dick was as vain as Hamlin : wherever she looked vanity and hollowness met her , and she herself could not even conceive what vanity was . “
111075	111110	111070	111070	you	2691	” repeated Anne . Brown suddenly raised his big , rough , black head from the review which he had been mechanically looking at , and answered , looking straight in front of him — “
111126	111144	111120	111120	she	360	” There was something brief and silencing in his tone which surprised Anne and precluded further questions . “
111148	111153	111120	111120	she	360	” added Richard Brown , “
111189	111206	111179	111179	she	360	” Anne was indignant , and yet , at the same time , a little shocked . “
111215	111216	111211	111212	Madame Elaguine	360	” “
111219	111240	111179	111179	she	360	” answered Brown , half waiving the subject , and half insisting upon it , as self‐important men frequently do . “
111260	111311	111256	111258	an odious woman	2135	” Anne laughed bitterly . The whole world seemed so awry , every one seeing everything through the crooked spectacles of his own vanity . Now here was Dick insinuating evil against a woman because he had been such a big baby as to fancy her in love with him . “
111317	111321	111322	111322	they	4644	” cried Anne ; “
111335	111357	111322	111322	they	4644	” Brown reddened , and was on the point of saying something . But he checked himself , and merely remarked — “
111376	111377	111366	111366	they	3959	” “
111476	111482	111483	111484	Most women	2710	” Brown shook his head . “
111501	111502	111496	111496	Anne	171	” “
111506	111512	111504	111504	you	0	” answered Anne , scornfully . “
111565	111566	111567	111567	One	620	” “
111578	111602	111603	111603	I	0	” said Anne , half to herself ; and she thought of the mud which she had discovered in her own silver idol . “
111615	111625	111603	111603	I	0	” said Cousin Dick , turning off the conversation . “
111635	112457	112466	112470	the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty ”	5933	” said Anne to herself , and her pessimism became more confirmed . But later , although she continued to believe quite equally in Richard Brown ’s vanity , she began to suspect that there had been in this coarse‐looking man a movement of modesty , an unwillingness to let her eyes rest upon some nasty thing which he had seen . But of this , at present , she had no idea , and Madame Elaguine , although she did not find much in common with her , became for Anne another victim of the vanity and injustice of the world . They saw a good deal of the little woman now . Anne thought she understood her thoroughly , and owned to herself that she had not understood her at first . She recognised that the little woman had much more character than she had at first imagined ; and the impression of frailness , childishness , and helplessness which something in Madame Elaguine ’s appearance , manner , and voice had at first given her , wore away so completely that she could scarcely believe it had ever existed . Eccentric and irresponsible she still seemed , always rushing from one enthusiasm to another , always thirsting for excitement ; but Anne found that instead of a childish girl who could lean upon her , she had to deal with a woman , undisciplined and capricious indeed , but still , in many respects , more of a woman than herself . She was flighty and giddy like her own little girl in many respects , and fully as ignorant of many things ; but she had a knowledge of sides of life which Anne instinctively guessed , and from which she recoiled . With an extraordinary love of the beautiful , the fantastic , and the ideal , which , as it made her dress herself in queer ingénue little costumes , also made her mould her conduct , ideas , and words rather theatrically in obedience to a conception of something striking and pretty,—Madame Elaguine had , at the same time , a vein — no , Anne thought it must be a mere exterior dab , not due to her inner nature , but to her Russian and Continental education — of coarseness , which surprised and pained Miss Brown . Once or twice , in Anne ’s presence , she alluded to things in a manner which gave Anne a shock ; and Anne , who , half Italian as she was , and wholly fearless and unprudish , would ask herself what right she had had to feel like that ; she would analyse Madame Elaguine ’s words , and find them , when measured by a Continental standard , very harmless ; yet somehow , though she told herself that she was stupid and unjust , something of the painful impression would remain . Also , she could not conceive how a woman could like to sit for hours , as Madame Elaguine did , on the score of spiritual séances , with a man like Edmund Lewis . She never heard him talk on anything objectionable to the Russian ; and yet there was something to her inconceivable in the endurance of this man by a young woman . Anne came to the conclusion that she must be growing horribly prejudiced and unjust ; and the less she could sympathise with some of Madame Elaguine ’s tastes ( though there was nothing really objectionable in them ) the more did she force herself to try and understand , and make allowance for , and help the little woman . And one day Anne ’s sympathies were really enlisted for her . It was about Christmas , and Anne had prevailed upon Hamlin to accompany her and Madame Elaguine to a pantomime , to which the Russian was taking her little girl , and Anne the two Chough children . Anne amused herself heartily , as she always did , at every sort of theatrical performance , with the love of shows and acting in her Italian blood ; she was so happy laughing with the children , while Hamlin talked with his cousin and Chough in the back of the box , that that evening long remained a sort of oasis in the dreariness of her inner life . There was a tremendous crush in the lobbies and on the stairs ; . and while Chough shoved on his two children , and Hamlin tried to make way through the crowd for his frail little cousin , who looked as if she would be knocked over and trampled like a feather , Anne , towering through the throng ( and people turned to look at that magnificent pale face , set in crisp black hair , and said to each other , “
112470	112576	112466	112470	the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty ”	5933	” ) , held Sacha Elaguine ’s little girl close in front of her , calmly making the crowd divide as a ship divides the water . They were fairly out of the theatre , on the steps looking out into the street , with the gas burning dim in the fog , and the long splashes of yellow light on pavement and wet cab‐tops , waiting in the damp cold , while Chough called their carriage , and Madame Elaguine , leaning on Hamlin ’s arm , the two little Choughs by her side , had heaved a sigh of relief , and exclaimed — “
112600	112676	112466	112470	the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty ”	5933	” When little Hélène Elaguine , who was holding Anne ’s hand , and see‐sawing from one leg to another — while staring at the men in opera hats and comforters , and the ladies and children huddled in furs , and the policemen and cabmen who passed in front — suddenly gave a piercing shriek , and threw herself into Anne ’s arms , clinging to her and burying her head in her pelisse . “
112687	112700	112685	112685	child	5758	” cried Anne , mechanically clasping the little girl round the waist . “
112706	112741	112466	112470	the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty ”	5933	” cried Hamlin , who had not seen this action . But Madame Elaguine had let go his arm and darted forward , white as ashes , and seized her child from Anne , and cried—“Let
112749	112796	112797	112797	I	0	” in an agonised voice . The carriage came up , and she jumped into it , scarcely giving Hamlin and Anne time to follow , and leaving Chough and his children amazed before the theatre door . The carriage stopped at her door in Kensington . “
112819	112833	112834	112834	They	2724	” And Madame Elaguine burst into tears , strangely intermingled with hysterical laughs . “
112848	112849	112842	112842	they	2724	” “
112856	112860	112842	112842	they	2724	” asked Hamlin . “
112869	112876	112866	112867	Madame Elaguine	360	” said Anne , with decision ; “
112913	112988	112911	112911	you	2726	” Hamlin lifted his cousin out of the carriage , while Anne took charge of the child , whom its nurse carried up in a condition of lethargic sleep . When they were in Madame Elaguine ’s drawing‐room , the Russian took the child in her arms , and flinging herself on a sofa , burst out crying , her sobs interrupted by moaning complaints that some one wanted to take her child away . “
113002	113019	112989	112989	I	0	” whispered Hamlin to Anne , who had knelt down by the side of the sofa . “
113031	113032	113020	113020	I	0	” “
113036	113058	113020	113020	I	0	” answered Anne , under her breath . But Madame Elaguine heard . She started up , and looking wildly about — “
113068	113072	113020	113020	I	0	” she cried . “
113080	113084	113078	113078	Sacha	386	” said Hamlin . “
113095	113100	113101	113101	I	0	” repeated Madame Elaguine . “
113112	113113	113105	113105	I	0	” “
113124	113128	113121	113122	Mr Hamlin	145	” whispered Anne ; “
113140	113212	113129	113129	she	171	” Hamlin took a chair near the table , and looked on in surprise . Madame Elaguine was stretched on the sofa , her sleeping child pressed close to her ; her little head , with its short pale curls , thrown back ; her eyes half closed , moaning and gasping and sobbing ; and Anne , kneeling by her side , looking anxiously into that curious , convulsed face . “
113222	113242	113214	113214	you	2731	” asked Hamlin of his cousin ’s Swiss maid , who stood by , the picture of self‐satisfied composure . “
113286	113292	113284	113284	Madame	360	” added the servant quietly , “
113300	113301	113302	113304	What black man	2734	” “
113306	113328	113302	113304	What black man	2734	” asked Hamlin . Sacha Elaguine had suddenly raised herself on her elbow,—as if she had heard the maid ’s words . “
113337	113342	113335	113335	Sophie	417	” she said quietly . “
113349	113353	113354	113354	Sophie	417	” asked Anne . “
113361	113427	113354	113354	Sophie	417	” answered Madame Elaguine ; and sitting up , she drew the half‐wakened child close to her and kissed her with convulsive passion . Yet she let the maid carry off the little one , and merely let herself slip down on the couch with a moan , putting aside her heavy fur and passing her hands through her pale blond hair , and moaning . “
113437	113443	113430	113430	you	2735	” said Anne to Hamlin . “
113451	113477	113444	113444	I	0	” She would loathe to have Hamlin sitting there , looking at her , if she were in Madame Elaguine ’s condition . Hamlin rose . “
113482	113500	113444	113444	I	0	” said his cousin faintly , turning round and fixing her vague northern blue eyes on him ; “
113507	113598	113505	113505	Walter	145	” Hamlin remained standing , his eyes involuntarily fixed upon the curious spectacle of this prostrate little figure , panting and gasping as if going to die , and half unconscious of any one ’s presence — her cloak thrown back on the sofa , her hair tangled , her bare arms and neck ( for it was one of her caprices always to go the play , even to the pantomime , full dress ) half covered by the fur of her pelisse and the lace of her dress . “
113608	113618	113603	113603	I	0	” repeated the Russian , in a faint voice . “
113628	113629	113622	113622	Anne	171	” “
113634	113644	113646	113646	you	0	” answered Anne , in her cheerful strong voice ; “
113654	113655	113656	113656	I	0	” “
113660	113756	113656	113656	I	0	” and Sacha flung her arms round Anne ’s neck , and drew her dark head close to her own little pale yellow one . Anne felt her arms tighten passionately round her , her little hand tighten convulsively round her neck , as if the half‐fainting woman would throttle her,—but she felt no fear , only a vague , undefinable repulsion . Madame Elaguine sighed a long sigh of relief , and loosened her hold ; but she kept Anne ’s face near hers , and kissed her with hot lips on the forehead . “
113760	113764	113656	113656	I	0	” she said , “
113768	113769	113656	113656	I	0	” “
113776	113810	113656	113656	I	0	” said Anne , trying to get loose and to rise to her feet . But Madame Elaguine kept her down in her kneeling posture , her arm always round Anne ’s shoulder . “
113819	113836	113811	113811	I	0	” she said , in a slow , vague tone , fixing her eyes upon Hamlin . “
113888	113984	113985	113985	I	0	” and Madame Elaguine hid her face in Anne ’s iron‐black hair . Hamlin looked on as in a dream . It was a curious sight , these two women , so different , and yet both so young and beautiful , the one clinging so to the other ; and of the two , Madame Elaguine , whom he had never thought regularly handsome , with her thin , strange face , and red lips , and wild eyes , seemed to him at this moment the stranger and more beautiful of the two . “
113992	113997	113998	113998	Walter	145	” said Madame Elaguine . “
114021	114081	113998	113998	Walter	145	” Hamlin brought the box ; and Madame Elaguine , without letting go her hold of Anne , pressed a spring and opened it . It was full to the brim of letters — some large and folded in their envelopes , others mere scraps of paper . She took some out , and spread them on her knees . “
114084	114113	113998	113998	Walter	145	” she said , letting Anne go , so that she could , while still kneeling , see the papers . Anne raised herself , and Hamlin approached . “
114118	114133	113998	113998	Walter	145	” said the Russian , carefully handling the soiled and crumpled pieces of paper ; “
114155	114165	114142	114143	other women,—they	2739	” And she fixed her eyes wildly on Hamlin . “
114256	114390	114241	114241	I	0	” her voice burst out hot and passionate . Anne and Hamlin were shyly fingering the papers ; they were all in the same hand — a curious , crabbed , left‐handed character — some in French , some in English , some in Russian , but all brief and to the same purpose : initials of which neither Anne nor Hamlin understood the meaning at the head , and below a threat of something terrible , sometimes left vague , sometimes outspoken , as death , to what was styled the traitress . Many of them said that what could not be visited on the mother should be visited on the children , and all concluded with saying that wherever the traitress went she would be followed by invisible eyes and footsteps . “
114400	114412	114394	114394	my	0	” began Madame Elaguine , covering her eyes with her hands ; “
114982	115214	114961	114961	he	1239	” A convulsion passed across Madame Elaguine ’s face ; it dropped , like that of a dying person . But she started up suddenly , and went on with her story . For ten years nearly she had been persecuted in this mysterious way ; threatening letters had come to her by all manner of conveyances,—brought by the post , found on her table , dropped by invisible hands at her feet . Attempts had been made to poison her , stopped just in time to let her know of them — for the object seemed rather to make her life unbearable than to take it away ; burning spirits of wine had been poured under her door ; twice she had been shot at . But the most terrible part of the persecution had come when they had discovered her passionate love for her little girl ( the boy , now at school , they had somehow let alone ) . Several times , in various places ( for she was always on the move , flying her enemies ) , attempts had been made to carry off the child ; once , at Cannes , she had gone to the window just in time to see a man snatch up the child , who was playing in the garden , and to fire off a revolver at him . “
115222	115229	115216	115216	I	0	” said Madame Elaguine , savagely , “
115244	115330	115238	115238	her	2725	” The individual who had made these attempts she described as being very dark , as if his complexion had been altered by overdoses of nitrate of silver . And this man would every now and then , at unexpected moments , reappear , and his reappearance meant some fresh outrage . Poor little Helen had suddenly seen him , or thought she had seen him , among the crowd coming out of the theatre ; and this had produced the child ’s sudden fit . “
115339	115344	115345	115345	I	0	” said Madame Elaguine , “
115372	115379	115467	115467	she	415	” and she burst into tears . “
115402	115451	115462	115462	Helen	415	” she cried . Anne had listened awe‐stricken . She had always thought there was something mysterious about this giddy little woman . This frightful undeserved calamity struck down her imagination ; what right had she ever to feel unhappy in the presence of such misery as this ? “
115454	115457	115462	115462	Helen	415	” she suggested timidly—“perhaps
115499	115500	115492	115492	she	415	” “
115513	115531	115508	115508	he	2783	” moaned Madame Elaguine , turning over on the sofa and burying her face in its cushions . “
115537	115543	115550	115550	your	2785	” whispered Anne to Hamlin ; “
115567	115568	115553	115553	I	0	” “
115572	115671	115553	115553	I	0	” and Hamlin , as he noiselessly opened the door , cast a last glance at that singular group in the rose‐coloured light of his cousin ’s lamp,—Sacha , with her fur and lace all in disarray , gasping on the couch , her bare throat heaving , and one of her thin white arms hanging loosely by her side ; and Anne Brown , in her long plain white dress of high art simplicity of cut , stooping over her . For some time Anne sat by Sacha ’s side , holding the Russian ’s hot hand . “
115676	115686	115687	115688	Mr Hamlin	145	” suddenly asked Madame Elaguine , turning her head . “
115694	115717	115687	115688	Mr Hamlin	145	” Madame Elaguine raised herself and sat up on the sofa , and passed her little hands through her disorderly yellow hair . “
115725	115736	115723	115723	Annie	171	” she said . Anne stooped down and kissed her . “
115746	115751	115738	115738	I	0	” said Madame Elaguine . “
115759	115776	115753	115753	I	0	” asked Anne , who feared that Hamlin ’s cousin might have another fit of hysterics . “
115788	115803	115783	115783	she	417	” On Anne ’s call , the Swiss maid emerged from the next room . “
115809	115823	115783	115783	she	417	” ordered Sacha , rising and leaning on the arm of the sofa . “
115831	115888	115825	115825	I	0	” asked Anne , for the maid looked so indifferent , nay , so sulky , and she seemed to handle her mistress so roughly , that Miss Brown wondered how Madame Elaguine , in her state of nerves , could endure to be helped by her . Anne waited till Madame Elaguine was in bed . “
115902	116180	115889	115889	I	0	” said the maid , looking at Anne with a curious insolence ; and she led her up‐stairs . Anne did not put out the lamp , and she did not undress . She could not sleep ; and she felt miserable at the notion of Madame Elaguine being left all alone on the first floor . What if the little woman should wake up with a panic , if she were to fancy that some of her mysterious persecutors were hiding in her room ? Anne took the lamp , and silently descended into the drawing‐room . All was quiet . She sat down in an arm‐chair , and made up the dying fire . She felt very restless and unable to sleep . The whole scene of this night and Sacha ’s revelations had shaken her nerves and gone to her imagination . In her half‐drowsy , dreamy condition , everything seemed to her strange and eerie in this room , which was so unlike her own at Hammersmith . It was full of pretty things , but in great confusion ; Sacha ’s piano was still open , with a book of Rubinstein ’s songs on it . There was a heap of dog’s‐eared French novels and recent volumes of poetry on the table , and the whole room was heavy with the scent of some Eastern drug and of Madame Elaguine ’s Turkish cigarettes . On the table by Anne ’s side were some books : she took up one , and opened it at random ; it was Hamlin ’s new volume . At the head of the page was the title , “
116187	116209	115889	115889	I	0	” and all along the margin was a faint line in pencil , and the words , in a childish hand , “
116217	117359	115889	115889	I	0	” THE notion that a man was waiting , thirsting for her love , would have been enough for many a woman in Anne ’s position — many a woman more gifted than Anne , and more conscious of her gifts , especially if the man who thus tacitly implored her to love and kindle love in him , were , like Hamlin , the former object of passionate worship . But with Anne Brown it was different . Some few women seem to be born to have been men , or at least not to have been women . To them love , if it come , will be an absorbing passion , but a passion only of brief duration , the mere momentary diversion into a personal and individual channel of a force which constitutes the whole moral and intellectual existence , whose object is an unattainable ideal of excellence , and whose field is the whole of the world in which there is injustice , and callousness , and evil . Such women may be very happy if they love a man with their eyes open — love him as a mere secondary concern , as a mere trusty companion in the struggle after the ideal ; but if they love in a man what momentarily seems to be that ideal , if they love with all the force of their nature , a terrible reaction of vacuity and despair must soon come . As with their lovers and husbands , so also with their children : they can not blissfully concentrate all their passion upon them ; such love will soon become narrow and bitter for them . They are indeed sent into the world ( if any of us is ever sent for any purpose ) to be its Joans of Arc — to kindle from their pure passion a fire of enthusiasm as passionate , but purer than it is given to men to kindle : they are not intended to be , except as a utilisation of what is fatally wasted , either wives or mothers . Masculine women , mere men in disguise , they are not : the very strength and purity of their nature , its intensity as of some undiluted spirit , is dependent upon their cleaner and narrower woman ’s nature , upon their narrowness and obstinacy of woman ’s mind ; they are , and can only be , true women ; but women without woman ’s instincts and wants , sexless — women made not for man but for humankind . Anne Brown was one of these . She had no idea that she was of this strange , rare stuff of heroines ; she had no notion that she was at all superior to the ordinary run of her sex ; indeed it was her perfect ignorance of her own exceptional nature which caused most of her wretchedness , making her at once more impatient with the weakness of others , and more impatient with her own difficulty of being satisfied . Love , therefore , was not for her a happiness , nor an ideal , nor even a compensation . In an intensely earnest nature like hers , a few years are worth a lifetime : everything is understood , endured much sooner ; all that can be felt , for pleasure or pain , is rapidly exhausted , and the character remains early , with all its human lusts and vanities burnt out like the gases in green wood , ready to become the fuel for unindividual ideal passion . So at twenty‐three , Anne had , so to speak , loved out her love , her passionate adoring love , as she had dreamed out the dreams of her life ; anything that might still come would be but a faint momentary flicker of sentiment , a detail in her life , and no more . So when Hamlin had , in his veiled way , made her to understand what he hoped , what he desired , what he expected , what ( she could not help saying to herself ) he had bargained for , of her,—the thought of this love , which she could no longer feel , and which she was expected to give — of this love which was to be merely the highest selfish pleasure , the most precious ( because the most refined ) , æsthetic lust of a selfish æsthetic voluptuary , Anne experienced a sense of horror and self‐debasement . So this was what Hamlin was waiting for — this which made him play that comedy of respectful distant adoration , of freedom of choice in her , of absence of all rights in himself — this that her solid mass of soul should slowly take fire , and smoulder , and , leaping up in inextinguishable flame , set him also ablaze . Hitherto Anne had been unhappy from her isolation , from her gradual discovery that the man whom she had loved as an ideal of nobility must be scorned as a mere weak‐spirited and morbid‐minded artistic automaton,—a mind creating beautiful things from sheer blind necessity , as a violin gives out beautiful sounds , but soulless , like the mere instrument of wood and string . She had been unhappy because she was alone , terribly alone ; but now she was unhappy because she had discovered that she was in bondage , surrounded by walls , a slave . And now that she yearned for the icy sense of isolation with which she had lived a few weeks back , as a prisoner in a fortress might yearn for the desert , she found also that she could no longer drift on indifferent , enduring the present , and hoping for the future . She could no longer vaguely say to herself , as she had so often said before , that Hamlin might be redeemed , that he might yet become once more an object of her love : for it had become plain to her that her future was settled ; that whatever Hamlin was , he was her master , her proprietor ; and that , lovable or not lovable to her nature , he expected , counted upon her love . This new feeling made Anne ’s life — that life which was so completely a life of the world within , not of the world without — insupportable in a new way . Isolated she could live , but not caged . Her whole soul sickened ; she no longer thought of trying to influence Hamlin , of trying to help others ; all her energies were concentrated upon helping , upon freeing herself . “
117369	117378	115889	115889	I	0	” said Sacha one day to her cousin . “
117383	117384	117385	117386	Miss Brown	171	” “
117392	117399	117400	117400	She	171	” answered Hamlin , affecting indifference . “
117442	117443	117437	117437	she	171	” “
117449	117456	117437	117437	she	171	” cried Madame Elaguine , impatiently . “
117502	117503	117494	117494	she	171	” “
117507	117531	117504	117505	Miss Brown	171	” said Edmund Lewis , in his drawling , clammy voice , fixing his conquering eyes on Madame Elaguine with a quiet , insolent smile—“Miss
117558	117563	117538	117538	she	171	” The Russian laughed . “
117571	118869	117538	117538	she	171	” she cried , and turned contemptuously on her heel . Hamlin did not answer , but a feeling of satisfaction came over him . Anne was unhappy ; and in a nature like hers , he said to himself , love must be unhappiness . But when he saw Lewis and his cousin alone he felt annoyed ; and he fell upon their spiritualistic practices with a perfect rabidness of scorn . Anne little knew that she was watched ; she did not care what might or might not be thought of her by Sacha Elaguine , by Chough , by Edmund Lewis , by any of these people whom she despised ; and as to Hamlin , an instinct told her that he would never guess what it was that troubled her . So Anne kept her pain to herself ; but sometimes the despair of being thus enslaved became too strong for endurance , and she longed for some one to whom to confide it . Every word , every look , every piece of attention , every show of indifference on Hamlin ’s part , seemed to mean the same thing : that he expected her to love him — everything seemed to allude and point to that . The only women with whom she was at all really intimate were the Leighs ; but Anne could not say a word to them , could not ask their advice . She could never , she thought , make either of these girls enter into her situation , comprehend her feelings , make her understand that she was not ungrateful , and that Hamlin was not ungenerous . Yet she felt the terrible need of some one to counsel her — to take some of the frightful responsibility either of ingratitude or of degradation from off her — to show her either how to get out of the situation , or how to submit to it . Such a person there was — a person who might help her , who might even understand her ; but something told Anne that she must not have recourse to him , to her cousin Dick . Perhaps it was vanity , perhaps a knowledge that Richard Brown would triumph over this miserable ending to what he had always opposed ; a fear lest he might misunderstand Hamlin , and bespatter what was the one beautiful thing in his life — his raising up of Anne . For it was a curious point that , contemptible as Hamlin had become to Anne , and unworthy in her own eyes of her love , she could not endure the idea of any one else understanding this , of any one else attacking Hamlin . None of them , she felt , could understand what Hamlin had done for her ; what he had been — nay , what , as a beloved piece of the past , he still was — to her ; only she could measure what she owed to him , and only she , therefore , might weigh the bad in him against the good . For even when she was most overcome with the sense of the moral prison which was closing round her , to cripple her life and break her spirit , Anne could not wish that the past had been otherwise — that she had never met Hamlin , never contracted a debt towards him , never loved him . Bleak and dark as might be the present , she would not ever have given up that past,—that sudden flaming up of her life , that one spell of hope and trustfulness , and admiration and love , which must serve her for all her existence : to have had that was always sweet , to have been given it was always a reason for gratitude . Moreover , Anne could not now contemplate what she would have been had she never met Hamlin . To her stern and idealising nature , to have remained without knowledge , without responsibility , without sympathy , without sense of right or wrong , morally only half developed , only half alive , as she had been during her earlier girlhood , was unendurable . She would not , for all the pain and humiliation which it might cost her , have forfeited the finer fibre , the clearer vision which had shown her that she was indebted therefor to a man whom she despised . No ; she could not , even in thought , relinquish the past . But what of the future ? The question laid hold of Anne ’s mind , and for some weeks rode it like an incubus . How many of us have thus let a hopeless problem get hold of our whole nature , and make it move , day after day , week after week , in the frightful treadmill of its vicious circle ? Every night Anne lay down to sleep with her doubts half solved , her mind half made up , only to wake up the next day with all her doubts reinforced and all her resolutions scattered . Such a condition is not due to weakness or indecision of character ; nay , it is probably only the earnest minds , the most capable of serious decisions , who can thus go on living in suspense , resisting the temptation of a decision , enduring the monotonous recurrence of a struggle of motives and of thought ; it is the effort , this frightful mental instability , at retaining moral life where life would easily be extinguished ; it is the weary tramp up and down with cold cramped limbs of the prisoner who knows that were he to stop , were he to lie down , he would have rest , but also death . Almost unintentionally Anne kept asking herself what steps she could take to be free . She used , in moments of weakness and weariness of heart , to go over schemes of independence , to indulge in day‐dreams of self‐supporting liberty . She who , a few months ago , had dreamed of raising the lower classes , of spreading higher knowledge and ideals among them , of awakening the more fortunate parts of society to their sense of responsibility,—she whose whole energy had been taken up in silent projects for bettering , no matter how little , the world , bettering the poor by making them think and enjoy , bettering the rich by making them feel ; giving the shop‐girls of the Women ’s Club a glimpse into the world of imagination , and giving Hamlin a glimpse into the world of reality,—she was now thinking of how she might earn her bread , how she might live as a teacher or a governess . Talking with the Leighs and her cousin , she used shyly , and with a desire to deceive very foreign to her , to put questions , seemingly purely abstract , as to what a poor girl with a certain amount of education could best do — as to what was required of a schoolmistress or a governess . And , while telling herself that it was all useless — that she was bound by the past , however much she might try and cut herself loose from the present — Anne mechanically gave her time to studying , no longer to be more worthy of Hamlin , or more useful in the world , but to enable herself to gain a livelihood if . . . Ah ! well , when she asked herself plainly what that “
118871	118892	117538	117538	she	171	” meant , she had to answer that she scarcely knew : if the slave‐owner should say to his slave , “
118901	119866	118895	118895	I	0	” if the man who had bought the precious statue or picture should weary of it and wish to exchange it . And Anne had to admit to herself that Hamlin was not the man to feel or act like this . Nay sometimes , when she had indulged in a day‐dream of freedom — when she had let herself go to the vain belief that Hamlin would one day awaken to the sense that this woman was not his ideal , as she had awakened to the sense that he was not hers — when she had worked out the details of her half‐starving life of independence , her return to her old drudgery ( but with a freer spirit ) , her hard struggle as a teacher of little children , or a shop‐girl , or at best a schoolmistress,—the recollection of the past would suddenly overpower her — the recollection of what she had been , what she had hoped — the recollection of her love of that debt which she was now devising a means of paying off,—and poor Anne would burst into tears . But that debt , she felt , could not be paid off . She might support herself in the future , but how could she get rid of the past ? If she lived on dry bread for the rest of her life , Hamlin would still have done for her what she believed that no other man had ever done for a woman ; if she could save up every penny of earnings and place before him all that he had ever spent for her education , would it not be the basest , vilest mockery and cheat , and could she repay the love which he had felt , the trustfulness which he had shown ? Repay it she never could ; for love and trustfulness she could not give in return ; and she must ever remain in his debt , remain his to do his bidding . And yet at times the question arose in her , What right had she to pay a debt at the price of her honour ? To become Hamlin ’s wife when she did not love him , to pretend love which she did not feel , this was in Anne ’s eyes , measured by her stern measure of right and wrong , a prostitution ; and could it be honourable to let herself be dishonoured ? But Anne cast this thought behind her ; Hamlin , by binding only himself and leaving her free , had by his chivalrous generosity really bound her ; if to possess her , and as much of her life and love as she could give , would make Hamlin happy , he had a right to it . The strain , Anne felt , was becoming too much for her ; this question of her own future , of her own dignity and undignity , was swallowing up her whole nature , neither more nor less than the nature of Hamlin and his friend was swallowed up by their æsthetical feelings . Anne recognised , with terror , that she was deteriorating ; that she was beginning to care nothing for others in this preoccupation about herself ; and that such a thing should happen — that she too should lose her more generous feelings — was a greater degradation than any other which could come over her . This shame and this misfortune alone it was in her power to prevent , and she determined to prevent it . She did her best to put aside all questions of her own future , to accustom herself to wait for what might happen , what she might be summoned to do , and she threw herself with more ardour than ever ( trying to escape from the contamination , not merely , as before , of the selfishness of others , but of her own ) into such studies and questions as concerned wider interests than her own . Anne ’s earnest nature , lacking the happy faculty of being absorbed by present feelings , had always been very subject to a dull moral pain at the evil in the world , storms from the great Sahara of misery which would lower over her own oasis of happiness , clogging its atmosphere and blighting its greenness . But now her efforts not to brood over her own unhappiness , resulted merely in her brooding almost unceasingly over the unhappiness of others . And gradually , to the sense of the misery of the world , became superadded the terrible sense of the injustice of that world ’s arrangements : from being indignant with the callousness of men , Anne became indignant , with the same cold and sombre indignation , at the callousness of God . She felt herself alone , isolated , separated not only from the men and women surrounding her , but separated in spirit from the whole scheme of things . And to her , the greater part of whose life was in her aspirations , this gradual removal of anything to which to aspire , this gradual destruction of every ideal with which to sympathise , such a condition of moral loneliness was , as Anne once said to her cousin , worse than death . Richard Brown had somehow , that day , been more sympathising with Anne than usual . Had she not been too much engrossed , she might have noticed that he watched her face , listened to her words , not merely now with gentleness and friendliness , but with a kind of suppressed admiration and wonder . “
119874	119878	118895	118895	I	0	” answered Richard ; “
119902	119929	119930	119930	I	0	” Anne looked up from the frock which she was making for one of the little Choughs , whose wardrobe was getting into a lamentable condition . “
120020	120102	120103	120104	All mankind	2799	” Richard Brown looked at Anne for a moment in silence . He was a singularly unæsthetic man , and confusing beauty with mere utility , he had never well understood the beauty which artistic people chose to see in this strange , uncommon , sombre face , so unlike that of any one else , and which seemed to have no prototype either in man or woman . But now he felt that Anne was beautiful , and very beautiful . “
120120	120124	120111	120111	you	2800	” he answered ; “
120168	120175	120111	120111	you	2800	” Anne shrugged her shoulders contemptuously . “
120186	120190	120111	120111	you	2800	” she asked . “
120193	120206	120111	120111	you	2800	” said her cousin , watching her face as he let his words drop—“because
120314	120370	120308	120308	you	2812	” Anne did not answer , but remained for a moment with her hands folded over her work , looking out of the window . Outside there was only yellow fog , and leafless spectral branches ; yet her onyx‐grey eyes opened slowly , as if she were taking in some faint but glorious vision . “
120385	120390	120391	120392	the gods	3874	” went on Brown ; “
120406	120411	120403	120403	I	0	” he added bitterly , “
120454	120492	120493	120493	I	0	” Anne was accustomed to such hits at Hamlin ; they were too true to be refuted , and too spiteful to be accepted ; and now she was too much absorbed to notice any of them . “
120506	120510	120504	120504	Dick	379	” she said . “

120607	120637	120586	120586	I	0	” and Anne thought bitterly how her own only religion , her love for Hamlin , her desire to become worthy of his goodness , had lamentably betrayed her . “
120644	120697	120586	120586	I	0	” said Brown , with his positivistic solemnity . Anne looked at him contemptuously ; she had so often heard people talk solemnly like that . Did not Hamlin talk in that way about the religion of beauty , and Dennistoun about the religion of love , by which he meant lust ? “

121119	121120	121107	121107	I	0	” “
121132	121138	121121	121121	I	0	” interrupted Brown , impatiently ; “
121205	121258	121260	121260	you	0	” His words seemed to go through Anne . Was she becoming selfish , weak , self‐indulgent ? The terror of it sickened her . And was everything , however noble it seemed — love , beauty , nay , even her indignation at the world ’s evil — only a snare ? “
121266	121274	121260	121260	you	0	” she said , after a moment . “
121335	121336	121327	121327	I	0	” “
121345	121358	121339	121341	a noble girl	2836	” said Brown half audibly , fixing his eyes on Anne ’s . “
121385	121386	121387	121387	You	0	” “
121395	121400	121387	121387	You	0	” she answered sadly . “
121422	121826	121827	121827	I	0	” Richard Brown lent Anne a number of books , and he often came of an evening when Hamlin was gone to Madame Elaguine ’s spiritual séances ( for despite his scepticism he found himself attracted by the mysticism with which Edmund Lewis had easily infected his cousin ) , and talked them over with her . He took her also to hear the lectures of a friend of his , a red‐haired young man of genius , dying of consumption , who had for truth and righteousness a passion such as other men may have for sport , and who was the chief preacher of the secular and scientific religion with which Brown was imbued , and with which he was seeking to imbue Anne . Anne was not so quick in being converted as her cousin had expected ; she was slow of thought , and her earnestness , her honesty , perhaps also a painful remembrance of so many other deluded hopes , made her sceptical . But , little by little , Anne was converted ; and , as her cousin had foretold , she was happier . The world and its contradictions became simpler in her eyes , and she became once more confident of good . Moreover , what Brown never guessed , her new faith in the triumph of right , her new belief in the necessity of doing one ’s duty for the sake of mankind and of progress , had at once given her a more serene determination to accomplish her duty towards Hamlin ; and , what was more important , it had taken away her thoughts a little from her own position of impotence and isolation and probable degradation . And perhaps , unconsciously also to Anne , she felt less isolated now : she felt as if in this rough , brutal , vain philanthropist , who was so honest , for all his petty vanity , and who was so desirous of her good , despite all his former contemptuousness , she had gained what she had never had , and had yet always vaguely wanted,—some one for her to understand and to understand her , to help and be helped by — not an ideal being to adore as she had adored Hamlin , but a good , wholesome , strong reality whom she could love as a brother . “
121839	121849	121837	121837	Dick	379	” she said one day , taking his hand ; “
121864	121875	121858	121858	you	2840	” Brown flushed , and his cynical smile failed him . “
121886	122015	122016	122023	A nasty , ignorant , frivolous little woman	2841	” he exclaimed . But suddenly he checked himself . END OF THE SECOND VOLUME . WHILE Anne was being indoctrinated with her cousin ’s philosophical theories , Hamlin had little by little let himself be drawn into the little clique of more mystical and Bohemian pre‐Raphaelites whom Edmund Lewis had collected round Madame Elaguine . The old‐fashioned , long‐established æsthetes , who believed that artistic salvation resided solely in themselves and their kith and kin , and who strangely muddled together the theories of an esoteric school and the prejudice of the untravelled Briton , decidedly set their face against Madame Elaguine . They had not liked Anne Brown because she was not sufficiently engaging ; but they thoroughly hated Sacha Elaguine because she was too fascinating . “
122025	122038	122016	122023	A nasty , ignorant , frivolous little woman	2841	” said Mrs Spencer , who was the spokeswoman of the party ; “
122084	122263	122064	122064	she	2841	” And the older people , and the women of the æsthetic world — the spinsters with dishevelled locks and overflowing hearts , who kept little garlanded lamps before the photographs of puny English painters and booted and red‐shirted American poets , all agreed with her . But the younger men merely laughed , and neglected the solemn , smut‐engrained parlours of Bloomsbury , the chilly , ascetic studios of Hampstead , for Madame Elaguine ’s curious , disorderly , charming house in Kensington — the house patched up with old lodging‐house furniture and all manner of Eastern stuffs and brocades , crowded with a woman ’s nick‐nacks , strewn with French novels and poems , and redolent of cigarettes and Russian perfumes . For there was in this delicate , nervous little creature , eaten up with love of excitement , something which acted as a spell upon most men ; and it was curious to see how she managed to make them all in love with her , and at the same time excite no jealousy . “
122276	122292	122267	122267	Circe	177	” asked Mrs Spencer , when this peculiarity was pointed out to her by Chough . “
122308	122479	122480	122480	I	0	” Lewis explained it as being due to Madame Elaguine ’s magnetic power . Whether the Russian had been fully converted to his spiritualistic theories , or , indeed , whether it was possible to make her believe seriously in anything , it is impossible to say . But she had caught the spiritualistic infection from Lewis as a tinder catches fire . Nothing in the world could suit her better : spiritualism appealed to her love of excitement and mystery , to an idealistic and mystical strain which made her hanker after strange supersensuous contacts and occult affinities ; moreover , if ever there was a woman of whom one might believe that she could vibrate with disembodied passion , and come in contact with an uncorporeal world , it was this emaciated , nervous , hysterical creature , who lived off coffee and cigarettes , and lived , as it seemed , only with her restless mind , and not at all with her frail , incapable body . “
122484	122492	122480	122480	I	0	” she would say to her friends , “
122575	122619	122554	122554	I	0	him,”—and she gave a little shudder . Cosmo Chough listened spell‐bound with admiration , twisting and untwisting his long black whiskers . What a woman was this ! And he ruminated over a new chapter of his Triumph of Womanhood , of which Sacha Elaguine—“Sacha
122623	122686	122554	122554	I	0	” as she bade her friends call her — should be the heroine . Edmund Lewis smiled his sensual lazy smile , which one knew that he imagined to be the prototype of the cruel and lustful mysterious smile of the men and women , and creatures neither one nor the other or both , who came from beneath his fantastic pencil . “
122694	122710	122554	122554	I	0	” he said , in his luscious voice , stooping over Madame Elaguine ’s chair , “
122732	122733	122721	122722	a vampire	2293	” “
122738	122742	122736	122736	Lewis	353	” thought Chough . “
122766	122829	122763	122764	a poet	498	” and he made a note of the vampire . Hamlin was standing by , smoking his cigarette sullenly . He did not like these sort of liberties which Lewis took with his cousin ; he had even of late warned her that , although his friend was an excellent fellow , too great intimacy with him might prove disagreeable to her . “
122839	122845	122837	122837	Lewis	353	” he exclaimed , frowning . “
122869	122888	122889	122889	Your	353	” Lewis laughed triumphantly ; but Madame Elaguine , to his amazement , cut him short by saying — “
122920	122933	122934	122934	I	0	” Lewis , who was never abashed , merely raised his eyebrows . “
122943	122947	122934	122934	I	0	” he answered . “
122958	122964	122949	122949	Lewis	353	” whispered Hamlin to Sacha , “
122974	122986	122968	122968	him	353	” Madame Elaguine pressed his fingers in her little hot hand . “
122991	123009	122987	122987	You	353	” she answered , in what was like the buzz of a gnat , but infinitely caressing ; “
123042	123064	123036	123036	Anne	171	” The last words were scarcely more than a little sigh to herself ; but Hamlin caught them , and reddened . “
123070	123086	123065	123065	Anne	171	” he said briefly ; then added , as if to justify himself in his own eyes—“I
123094	123103	123065	123065	Anne	171	” Sacha shook her little thin childish head . “
123110	123220	123065	123065	Anne	171	” Miss Brown went but rarely to the house of Hamlin ’s cousin . She was extremely sorry for the poor little woman ’s misfortunes ; and asking herself what she would have been had she had Madame Elaguine ’s past , she often admired how the Russian had kept her independence and self‐respect , and serenity and cheerfulness . Yet , while she believed herself fully to appreciate Sacha , and invariably defended her against the jealous prudery of Mrs Spencer and her clique , Anne somehow felt no desire to see much of her . She set it down to her own narrowness and coldness of temper . “
123229	123238	123239	123239	I	0	” she used to say to Mary Leigh ; “
123289	123345	123347	123347	you	2863	” Poor Mary Leigh was silent . Anne — this beautiful noble , distant , somewhat inscrutable Anne — was the idol of the enthusiastic Irish girl . She had often longed to tell her so ; she longed , at this moment , to put her arms round Anne ’s neck , and say quite quietly—“I
123351	123497	123349	123349	Anne	171	” but she had not the courage . How much may this sort of cowardice , called reticence , cheat people of ? The knowledge that there is a loving heart near one , that there is a creature whom one can trust , that the world is not a desert,—all this might be given , but is not . And the other regrets , perhaps throughout life , that word which remained unspoken , that kiss which remained ungiven , and would have been as the draught of water to the wearied traveller . Anyhow Anne , while thinking that she liked Madame Elaguine , somehow did not care to see much of her . What she could do for her she did willingly . Madame Elaguine wanted the child to learn English , but made a fuss about letting her have a governess . “
123508	123609	123504	123504	my	0	” she said . But as she went on grieving at little Helen ’s ignorance , and her own incapacity , from want of schooling and want of strength , to teach her , Anne offered to teach the child together with the little Chough girls , who were still her pupils . Madame Elaguine was rapturously grateful ; but Helen was so completely spoilt , that she could be brought to Anne only when she fancied it herself , and Anne found her so demoralised that she really did not like to bring her in contact with the Choughs . “
123623	123779	123618	123618	you	2865	” Madame Elaguine would say ; and Helen was within week of being ten , and Anne , much as she disliked asking Madame Elaguine anything , urged that she should begin to be taught . Moreover , Anne ’s time was too much taken up reading under Richard Brown ’s directions , and her thoughts were too much preoccupied to make her feel at all sociable , even had she not felt an instinctive repugnance to the sort of company , headed by Edmund Lewis , which she knew she would meet at Madame Elaguine ’s . However , one evening she could not refuse Sacha ’s invitation , more especially as the latter , evidently to please Anne , had invited her friends the two Leighs . It was a grand spiritualistic séance . Madame Elaguine was in great excitement , and Edmund Lewis was radiant . But Hamlin looked bored and pressed . “
123789	123920	123780	123780	I	0	” he said impatiently to Anne . Anne loathed it : the triviality disgusted her , the giving up of one ’s will to another revolted her , and she could not understand how a woman could endure to be handled and breathed upon by a man like Lewis . Mary Leigh was half excited and half amused ; Marjory , the strong‐minded scoffer , had determined to unmask some sort of trickery . The séance , to which Edmund Lewis had brought a famous professional medium , was very much like any other séance : a darkened room , a company of people partly excited , partly bored ; expectation , disappointment , faith , incredulity ; moving of tables and rapping , faint music , half visible hands . “
123935	123983	123984	123984	You	2866	” as little Thaddy O’Reilly fiippantly remarked to Anne . How could Madame Elaguine have patience with such rubbish ? wondered Miss Brown . What excitement could that excitement‐loving little woman , with a real mystery in her own life , find in all this stale shibboleth ? “
124000	124014	123994	123994	I	0	” said Sacha to Hamlin , as her little soft hand touched his . “
124048	124049	124042	124042	you	2866	” “
124052	124058	124042	124042	you	2866	” answered Anne , briefly . “
124073	124111	124061	124062	Mr Hamlin	145	” Hamlin somehow admired Anne ’s answer ; he was glad it was so,—had she felt like his cousin , something would have spoilt in an ideal of his ; and yet Anne ’s coldness annoyed him . “
124126	124133	124112	124113	The spirits	2867	” said Edmund Lewis , angrily . “
124168	124210	124211	124211	Spirit‐hands	424	” But nevertheless , when the company was giving up the séance as spoilt , mysterious sounds were heard , and something luminous , which was immediately identified as a pair of spirit‐hands , was seen to float over the table . “
124213	124218	124211	124211	Spirit‐hands	424	” whispered Edmund Lewis . “
124227	124232	124211	124211	Spirit‐hands	424	” whispered Thaddy O’Reilly . “
124236	124280	124211	124211	Spirit‐hands	424	” whispered Madame Elaguine . Something round , like a wreath , did seem to float , supported by the spirit‐hands . Some said it was oak , others cypress , others myrtle ; but it soon became apparent that it was bay . “
124284	124426	124427	124427	I	0	” whispered the guests to each other . The wreath floated unsteadily over the heads of the party ; but , as it passed Marjory Leigh , that evil‐minded young materialist quickly snatched at it , but it was whisked away by the indignant spirits . There was a murmur of indignation ; but indignation turned into triumph when suddenly the wreath reappeared , and hovered for two good minutes over Hamlin ’s head . There was a cry of admiration , and Madame Elaguine clapped her hands . But Marjory Leigh struck a light , and lit the candle by her side . She could see faintly the excited faces all round , and among them the pale face of Anne Brown , scornful and angry , fixed upon that of Hamlin , who was flushed , hesitating , surprised . “
124439	124446	124427	124427	I	0	” said Marjory Leigh , quietly ; “
124470	124539	124453	124453	they	2867	” And she stretched out something in the palm of her hand . Every one crowded round , and took it up by turns . It was a leaf , torn and broken , of green laurel which she had pulled off when the crown had passed over her ; but the green laurels were masses of stamped paper , and left a green stain in the hand . “
124592	124597	124580	124581	Walter Hamlin	145	” cried Thaddy O’Reilly . “
124618	124640	124641	124641	You	2874	” There was a titter . Madame Elaguine burst out laughing . Hamlin laughed , but he looked black as thunder . “
124651	124659	124660	124660	You	2874	” cried Lewis furiously at Marjory Leigh . “
124673	124674	124675	124675	My	0	” “
124679	124686	124675	124675	My	0	” said Thaddy O’Reilly , gently , “
124701	124702	124692	124693	a gentleman	662	” “
124725	124731	124714	124714	I	0	” said Marjory , fiercely . “
124744	124910	124735	124735	spirits	2878	” The séance came to an end . The lamps were lit . The medium dismissed with considerable contumely . Edmund Lewis went away in a huff ; and Madame Elaguine , who cared in spiritualism only for those strange thrills which she had before described , laughed a great deal about the matter , and settled down to make music with Cosmo Chough . Hamlin looked as if he wished himself a thousand miles away . He would speak with no one ; he was angry with his cousin for having let him in for such a ridiculous scene , and angry with the rest of the company for having witnessed it ; he had no command over his looks ; and while Madame Elaguine ’s curious , warm , childish voice throbbed passionately through Schumann ’s songs , or while people took their tea and talked , he sat aside , in the doorway of the next room , like a whipped child . “
124917	125175	124735	124735	spirits	2878	” whispered Madame Elaguine , laughing , to Chough . But Anne did not laugh . She felt the humiliation not of the paper laurels , but of that radiant look which she had seen in Hamlin when the lights had first been lit . And she was indignant with Hamlin for taking this ridiculous business so tragically , and at the same time sorry for his poor , wounded , unsympathised‐with vanity . She left the piano , where she had been sitting near Sacha , and went to him where he sat disconsolately looking over a heap of newspapers in the next room . She did not allude to the scene . What use was it chiding him ? He could never understand . She talked to him about the picture which he was painting , about the people , anything to make him feel that she was sorry for him . Hamlin was bitter against his friends ; he began once more his tirades against modern art and poetry , its lifelessness and weakness ; he again declared himself longing for a different life ; he again , passionately and delicately , called upon Anne , in his veiled way , to redeem him . Anne listened sadly . She knew it all so well by heart , this vain talk which was to be the daily bread of her soul . Suddenly Hamlin ’s eye fell upon Marjory Leigh , who was seated talking with Thaddy O’Reilly in the recess of a window . “
125187	125191	124735	124735	spirits	2878	” he cried , “
125199	125200	125201	125201	Marjory	249	” “
125248	125249	125250	125250	She	249	” “
125255	125263	125250	125250	She	249	” exclaimed Hamlin , crossly and violently . “
125309	125310	125311	125311	Marjory	249	” “
125324	125330	125311	125311	Marjory	249	” answered Anne , quietly . “
125387	125388	125376	125376	she	249	” “
125417	125423	125413	125413	I	0	” cried Hamlin , fiercely , “
125462	125463	125456	125456	O’Reilly	295	” “
125476	125482	125484	125484	she	249	” answered Anne , indignantly , “
125524	125525	125526	125526	I	0	” “
125544	125551	125526	125526	I	0	” said Hamlin , still hotly ; “
125587	125620	125575	125575	I	0	” and Hamlin looked dignified . Anne did not answer at first . She was filled with contempt for this vain childish ill‐humour , which was taking the proportions of rabid hatred . “
125626	125632	125621	125621	Marjory	249	” she at last said , “
125653	125654	125655	125655	I	0	” “
125662	125666	125655	125655	I	0	” exclaimed Hamlin . “
125685	125686	125676	125676	she	249	” “
125697	125706	125689	125690	Mr Hamlin	145	” asked Marjory of Anne a little later . “
125727	125755	125715	125716	the spirits	2867	” ANNE had forgotten all about the séance , when , about a week later , Mary Leigh arrived at Hammersmith in a state of extreme excitement . “
125763	125779	125761	125761	Mary	324	” asked Anne , wondering at her flushed face , which was usually so quiet . “
125784	125798	125761	125761	Mary	324	” said Mary Leigh , looking impatiently at some visitors who were present . “
125825	125844	125820	125820	me	0	” But the visitors had scarcely turned their backs , when Mary Leigh turned suddenly towards Miss Brown . “
125893	125894	125888	125888	Marjory	249	” “
125899	125910	125888	125888	Marjory	249	” asked Anne , a vague terror coming over her . “
125944	126067	125940	125940	you	171	” Miss Brown took the letter , evidently much pulled about and read and re‐read , from Mary Leigh , and smoothed it out and read it slowly ; while her friend sat by , looking anxiously at her face . The letter was from Marjory ’s intended . Harry Collett told her , with a dignity and gentleness , a desire not to hurt the one who had hurt him , and an incapacity of hiding his great pain , which nearly made Anne cry , that his eyes had at length been opened to the undesirableness of a marriage which , however much wished for by him , could not satisfy all the claims of a nature llke Marjory ’s . “
126078	126083	126084	126084	I	0	” wrote poor Harry , “
126284	126305	126306	126306	I	0	” But the poor curate ’s angelic nature could not resist the temptation of a fling at his supposed rival . “
126321	126325	126318	126318	my	0	” he added , “
126369	126370	126358	126358	I	0	” “
126375	126382	126383	126384	some one	1380	” cried Mary Leigh , impatiently ; “
126426	126438	126407	126407	Marjory	249	” added Mary Leigh , with an agony in her voice , “
126460	126482	126454	126455	Mr Hamlin	145	” Anne did not look up from the letter . She was very white , and her face full of shame . “
126488	126495	126454	126455	Mr Hamlin	145	” she answered , half audibly . “
126504	126508	126548	126548	Anne	171	” cried Mary . “
126567	126568	126555	126556	Madame Elaguine	360	” “
126572	126578	126555	126556	Madame Elaguine	360	” answered Anne , quickly , “
126599	126600	126592	126592	she	386	” “
126608	126609	126602	126602	you	171	” “
126620	126659	126615	126616	Mr Hamlin	145	” There was a dead silence . Poor Mary Leigh was torn by her indignation for her sister , and her pain at the shame cast upon her admired Hamlin , and through him upon her adored Anne . “
126675	126680	126667	126667	I	0	” she said desperately , “
126702	126703	126698	126698	she	249	” “
126711	126718	126719	126719	Marjory	249	” Mary Leigh shook her head . “
126778	126787	126788	126789	Mr Hamlin	145	” Anne passed her hand across her forehead . “
126794	126804	126788	126789	Mr Hamlin	145	” she said slowly , and with an effort , “
126811	126812	126806	126806	he	145	” “
126823	126829	126830	126830	I	0	” cried Mary , hopelessly . “
126847	126848	126841	126841	him	145	” “
126855	126863	126853	126853	you	171	good”—and Mary Leigh threw herself on Anne ’s neck—“for
126885	126886	126875	126875	you	171	” “
126894	126900	126875	126875	you	171	” answered Anne , mournfully . “
126912	126942	126907	126907	you	171	” Mary Leigh left the letter with Miss Brown ; and that evening , as Anne was sitting with Hamlin after dinner , she suddenly dashed into the subject . “
126982	126990	126991	126991	I	0	” asked Anne . Hamlin looked puzzled . “
126997	127002	126991	126991	I	0	” he said evasively . “
127010	127011	127004	127004	you	171	” “
127042	127043	127030	127030	I	0	” “
127054	127055	127046	127046	you	171	” “
127058	127060	127046	127046	you	171	have”—Hamlin spoke absently—“yes
127071	127072	127046	127046	you	171	” “
127077	127083	127046	127046	you	171	” cried Anne , indignantly ; “
127110	127129	127130	127130	I	0	” and she handed him the letter . Hamlin looked at it with an air of puzzled indifference . “
127140	127154	127130	127130	I	0	” he said , coolly and serenely , returning the letter to Anne . “
127167	127168	127156	127156	you	171	” “
127202	127242	127243	127244	Mr Hamlin	145	” Anne looked at him with wonder . So after having , momentarily at least , made two people as unhappy as was well possible , this was how he took the revelation of the results of his doings . “
127246	127252	127253	127253	you	145	” said Anne , sternly , “
127289	127290	127272	127272	you	145	” “
127351	127352	127353	127353	You	0	” “
127361	127367	127353	127353	You	0	” asked Anne , reproachfully . “
127405	127406	127382	127382	I	0	” “
127449	127450	127451	127451	I	0	” “
127488	127513	127484	127484	I	0	” Hamlin ’s tone was bored and slightly impatient . He had evidently not the smallest shame or regret for what he had done . “
127527	127537	127520	127520	you	0	” said Anne , trying to speak as gently as possible—“you
127622	127640	127641	127641	I	0	” Hamlin had risen from his seat , and his face had taken a curious obstinate look . “
127654	127658	127651	127652	Miss Brown	171	” he said , “
127704	127705	127702	127702	mine	0	” “
127727	127728	127719	127719	your	0	” “
127762	127763	127757	127757	I	0	” “
127771	127775	127764	127765	No one	3899	” cried Anne . “
127806	127807	127800	127801	Mr Hamlin	145	” “
127812	127818	127809	127809	I	0	” answered Hamlin , hotly , “
127855	127871	127849	127849	you	376	” He had gone to Anne ’s writing‐table . Anne put her arm over it . “
127886	127890	127872	127872	You	376	” she said . “
127934	127935	127909	127910	Miss Brown	171	” “
127939	127953	127954	127954	I	0	” answered Anne , and the words were like drops of freezing water . “
127957	127980	127954	127954	I	0	” she added , the remembrance of what he had answered when she had entreated him not to slander himself in those sonnets “
127983	127984	127986	127987	your school	2942	” “
128016	128024	128013	128013	I	0	” and Anne ’s indignation blazed up , “
128043	128044	128045	128045	I	0	” “
128055	128113	128045	128045	I	0	” he answered mournfully and bitterly , and left the room . He was thinking of all he had done for Anne — all that he had done and left undone . Anne remained seated , looking into the fire , for some moments . Then she went to her desk and took paper and an envelope . “
128118	128123	128114	128116	DEAR MR COLLETT	427	” she wrote slowly , “
128346	128766	128343	128344	ANNE BROWN	171	” Anne stopped several times in course of writing , and read and re‐read her letter . Hamlin had refused to make amends ; well , she must make them for him : the matter was simple , and it was Anne ’s character , whenever she saw the right course , to take it without hesitation , however painful to her . Like many very honest and firm people , she had something destructive in her temper ; she could , as Sacha Elaguine had said , sacrifice herself and others with a sort of sullen savage satisfaction . It was a humiliation for Hamlin , but he had deserved it ; it was a bitter humiliation for herself , but her debt of gratitude towards Hamlin forced her to take the consequences of the bad that was in him as well as the good . To admit that Hamlin had , from mere womanish ill‐temper , calumniated a friend , wantonly and thoughtlessly made two loving natures mistrust each other , and that he had then refused to repair the mischief of his own making,—this was intolerably bitter to Anne ; still it had to be done . She put the letter on the hall table , and bade the servant post it without delay . Then she felt the full ignominy of the matter ; and her whole nature recoiled from Hamlin ’s . Nay , it did not recoil ; there was no reality to shrink from . Anne no longer felt horror as she had done when he had given her that poem about Cold Fremley ; she rccognised that his fault was negative , that his moral evil was moral nullity — the utter incapacity in this man , who had acted so chivalrously towards her , of perceiving when he was doing a mean thing . And the thought that she would be chained for ever to the side of a man whose whole nature was merely æsthetic , who was wholly without moral nerves or moral muscles , filled her with despair . The next day , Hamlin sent word that he had to go and see some pictures at Oxford , and would be away for two days . Anne felt a vague hope that he was ashamed of himself . Madame Elaguine called , and with her came Cosmo Chough . The conversation , to Miss Brown ’s annoyance , turned upon the spiritualistic séance of the previous week . “
128773	128777	128768	128769	a fool	4435	” exclaimed Sacha . “
128853	128854	128855	128856	Mr Hamlin	145	” “
128858	128864	128855	128856	Mr Hamlin	145	” said Anne , evasively , “
128883	128884	128855	128856	Mr Hamlin	145	” “
128895	128914	128855	128856	Mr Hamlin	145	” said Madame Elaguine , eating some of the petals of the roses that were at her elbow , “
128938	128989	128992	128992	you	145	” Anne had often said those same words to herself ; yet somehow she knew that in Sacha Elaguine ’s mouth they had a different meaning ; and she felt it , when , with her curious , half‐childlike , and yet infinitely conscious smile , she turned to Chough . “
128999	129042	128992	128992	you	145	” Cosmo Chough pretended that he understood , as he always did , whenever he thought that passion and the Eternal Feminine were in question ; he tightened his black moustachioed lips into a long grimace , and bowed in deferential agreement . “
129046	129060	128992	128992	you	145	” said the little man , sticking his single eye‐glass in his eye , “
129121	129122	129118	129119	a man	503	” “
129129	129133	129118	129119	a man	503	” laughed Sacha . “
129290	129347	129278	129278	they	5019	” And Chough sighed , and fixed his eyes on his lacquered boot‐tips , as much as to intimate that he , who lived on mutton‐chops and spent his life nursing an epileptic wife , was of that Caliph Vathek kind . Madame Elaguine laughed ; but Chough thought it was at Hamlin , and frowned . “
129365	129374	129375	129375	he	145	” he said , looking fiercely around him , “
129471	129472	129464	129465	Miss Brown	171	” “
129476	129482	129473	129474	Mr Hamlin	145	” said Anne , slowly , “
129496	129522	129523	129523	I	0	” she added , feeling as if Madame Elaguine were looking into her soul , and as if she must read ingratitude written in it , “
129552	129553	129547	129547	he	145	” “
129559	129574	129547	129547	he	145	” exclaimed the polite little poet , to whom Anne was quite the goddess , “
129613	129614	129638	129638	one	620	” “
129617	129632	129638	129638	one	620	” mused Madame Elaguine , following out the pattern of the carpet with her parasol “
129678	129679	129680	129680	I	0	” “
129687	129693	129680	129680	I	0	” said Anne , quietly . “
129720	129725	129712	129718	the man who feels may come later	2984	” finished the Russian . “
129737	129743	129732	129732	they	577	” said Anne , sternly ; “
129749	129750	129732	129732	they	577	” “
129755	129759	129732	129732	they	577	” exclaimed Chough , “
129781	129782	129778	129779	Mademoiselle Aïssé	432	” “
129788	129814	129785	129786	Mademoiselle Aïssé	432	” asked Anne absently , forgetting that experience had taught her that it was safer not to inquire too curiously into Mr Chough ’s heroines . “
129835	129840	129833	129833	they	2987	” asked Madame Elaguine . “
129871	129872	129861	129861	I	0	” “
129875	129879	129861	129861	I	0	” exclaimed Chough . “
129897	129898	129861	129861	I	0	” “
129911	129915	129902	129909	this purest woman of — the eighteenth century	2992	” laughed Sacha . “
130048	130075	130081	130081	Aïssé	432	” Chough paused and looked round him to watch the effect of his eloquence . But his eyes fell upon Anne . She was very white . “
130084	130089	130090	130090	Aïssé	432	” asked Madame Elaguine . “
130136	130191	130126	130126	you	3001	” Anne felt that she had betrayed herself . To Sacha , she hoped , she believed not — but to Chough . The little poet , in his trumpery way , was really attached to Anne , whom he considered as his guardian angel ; and perhaps his affection had made him understand . “
130198	130221	130226	130226	she	432	” asked Anne , some time later , as she stood by the piano where Chough was playing . Chough looked up . “
130236	130237	130233	130233	she	432	” “
130246	130251	130239	130239	you	3003	” asked Madame Elaguine ; “
130269	130270	130261	130262	Mr Chough	248	” “
130277	130281	130275	130275	you	0	” answered Anne , “
130304	130305	130301	130302	Mademoiselle Aïssé	432	” “
130313	130314	130315	130315	She	432	” “
130356	130357	130358	130361	A nasty old ambassador	3005	” “
130363	130368	130358	130361	A nasty old ambassador	3005	” said Madame Elaguine . “
130394	130975	130391	130392	Mr Chough	248	” WHEN Chough first told her the story of Mademoiselle Aïssé , it was as if Anne had been suddenly confronted by her own wraith , surrounded by strange and tragic lights ; and the shock was very violent . But Miss Brown was too honest not to see after a minute that between her and Aïssé there was an unfathomable difference . M. de Ferréol was a mere experimentalising old roué , who had had a mistress prepared as he might have had a goose fattened ; and what he claimed of Aïssé was her infamy . Anne ’s conscience smote her ; she was very ungrateful . And she thought over all those scenes at the Villa Arnolfini , at Florence , nay , here in England not so long ago ; she thought of Hamlin ’s generosity and delicacy of mind — of the quixotic way in which he had bound himself while leaving her free — of the chivalrous way in which he had dowered her , making her feel almost as if all this money , which placed her on his own level , was her own inheritance , and not his charity . She remembered all the respect , which was more of a brother than of a lover , with which he treated her — the constant manner in which he hid all her obligations to him , never letting any taunt or harsh word of hers get the better of his resolution that Anne should feel that she owed nothing to him , and that he craved for her love as he might have done for that of a queen . And it came home to her how pure , nay , how poetically and romantically noble was the love which he asked for ; and she felt almost wicked when she reflected that what he wanted was to make her into the very highest thing which a man can make a woman — a sort of Beatrice , a creature to love whom will be spiritual redemption . All these things did Anne say to herself ; but it cost her an effort , and the strain could not be kept up . The fact was that she had , in her terror of being unjust , refused to listen to her own plea . But it came back to her like an overwhelming flood . She could not love Hamlin ; her soul recoiled from contact with his as her body might have recoiled from the forced embrace of a corpse : such a union , it seemed , would mean the death of her own nature . To be Hamlin ’s wife , to spend all her life by his side , hopelessly watching his growing callousness to everything for which she felt born,—to feel one generous impulse after another gradually waxing feebler , one energy after another for good becoming paralysed by the deathly moral chill of his utter heartlessness,—was this not much worse than any mere dishonour of the body , this prostitution of the spirit ? Aïssé ’s soul at least was free ; her Ferréol could not deprive her of her moral freedom , her aspirations , her powers of self‐sacrifice ; but with her , Anne Brown , it was different . And she repeated to herself with bitterness the warning words which Richard Brown had spoken in vain so long , long ago : “
130997	131171	131173	131173	Harry	376	” How little Dick had guessed the much more terrible meaning which these words would come to have for her ! Unconsciously Anne ’s mind reverted to the business of Marjory and Harry Collett ; and her mind ’s eye rested for a moment upon those two lovers , to each of whom , through whatsoever of discrepancy there might be , the other represented his or her highest ideal , that other ’s opinion his or her highest conscience ; not passionately in love , like Othello and Desdemona , or Romeo and Juliet , but persuaded to their inmost soul that in living by each other ’s side , and sympathising with and helping in the other ’s work , each would be fulfilling his or her best destiny in the world . Another woman situated like Anne might have let herself be tempted into cynicism by unconscious envy ; but this was not within Miss Brown ’s honest , and open‐eyed , and stern nature . She never once said to herself—“Marjory
131182	131275	131173	131173	Harry	376	” She had dreamed , alas ! and had awakened ; but she recognised that these two were broad awake , and that their happiness was a reality . Anne looked at these two lovers for a moment , but without any envy or bitterness . It never even entered her mind to covet their happiness , to imagine that she might have a right to anything similar . Anne , though leaning towards socialism in her theories , was not in the least a communistic mind ; she did not ask , “
131288	131518	131519	131519	I	0	” She envied no one the prize in the lottery ; she begged only for a chance . To be the wife of a man whom she loved , and who loved her — to be the companion and helpmate of some one who was striving after her own ideals ; such hankerings had never passed through her mind — or , if they had , they had long since been banished . What Anne longed for , what her soul hungered after , was merely negative freedom . Freedom to sympathise and to aspire — to do whatever little she still might to carve herself out a spiritual life of her own , no matter how mean and insignificant ; freedom to live in that portion of her which was most worthy of life . To gain her bread , no matter how harshly ; to be of some use , to teach at a school or nurse at a hospital ; nay , to be able merely to encourage others to do what she might not,—this was all that Anne asked ; and this , in her future as the wife of Hamlin , as the queen of this æsthetic world , which seemed to poison and paralyse her soul , was what she knew she could not have , what she knew she must do without . “
131525	131532	131521	131523	a selfish brute	3013	” she suddenly said to herself , “
131539	132043	131519	131519	I	0	mine,”—and she took down her books of political economy , and tried to fix her attention upon them , and think out a scheme of the lessons and exercises which she would give to the shop‐girls at the Working Women ’s Club . But what was the use of doing this ? Hamlin , she knew , loathed the notion of her teaching at the Club ; he would never let her teach there ; and , once his wife , she understood him sufficiently to be fully aware that he would consider himself completely empowered to make her do or leave alone whatever he chose . Still Anne tried to work on courageously . In the afternoon she went to hear one of Professor Richmond ’s lectures . This was the fervent young positivist whom Cousin Dick so much admired , and whose intense moral convictions had done a good deal to keep Anne out of the slough of desponding pessimism round which she had been some time hovering . Andrew Richmond was a man who had many slanderers , many of whom he has now left behind him — their misrepresentations having been more long‐lived than he ; for he had passed through many phases of thought , and , being perfectly honest , he had never been able to become unjust to any , and thus had made enemies not merely among the men whose beliefs he had abandoned , but among those also whose beliefs he had accepted without accepting their follies . He stood very alone ; and it was perhaps this isolation — this obvious indifference of the man to all save his own reason and conscience — which added to the solemnity of his convictions ; and made him appear , more than any one else , in the light of a priest of morality , of a prophet of the advent of justice . Anne had never spoken to Richmond ; but she felt that , of all human souls , this one did the most to keep up the courage of her own . This was one of the last discourses which the poor dying positivist ever delivered ; and it was the more earnest for the sense of his approaching end . He spoke this time , or , as his ridiculers called it , he preached upon the relation of duty to progress ; upon the value of each good impulse carried out , and each evil one resisted , in making morality more natural and spontaneous in the world ; and he insisted especially upon the danger , to people whose ideas of right and wrong rested no longer upon any priestly authority , of the individual sophisticating himself into the belief that in yielding to the preferences of his own nature he was following the highest law , and that any special usefulness ought legitimately to be bought at the expense of departing from the moral rules of the world . “
132053	132057	132063	132064	the individual	2834	” he said , “
132091	132092	132093	132093	I	0	” “
132099	132106	132107	132107	he	3017	” Madame Elaguine had once said ; “
132115	132116	132107	132107	he	3017	” “
132147	132165	132143	132143	he	3017	” Richard Brown had answered sternly . At the door of the lecture‐room Anne met her cousin . “
132172	132176	132167	132167	you	3018	” he asked . “
132185	132268	132179	132179	I	0	” Anne had made it a rule for the last two or three months to deprive herself of all luxuries . She did not wish to enjoy everything that she had a right to ; she had also a stern pleasure in doing the things most repugnant to her ; and a walk through the London streets , in murky spring weather , was to Anne ’s Italian temper , nurtured with æsthetic delicacy , one of the most disagreeable of expeditions . “
132277	132295	132179	132179	I	0	” said Richard Brown , looking at her as he buttoned her ulster over her massive figure . “
132342	132343	132346	132346	you	0	” “
132349	132350	132346	132346	you	0	” “
132360	132377	132354	132354	I	0	” And Brown looked once more at his cousin as he opened his umbrella over her . “
132386	132407	132379	132379	you	3018	” Richard Brown was not a lady ’s man , and there was something awkward and unaccustomed in his request . “
132444	132445	132434	132434	I	0	” “
132457	132570	132453	132453	you	379	” For some time they walked along in silence through the black oozy streets , crammed with barrows of fruit , round which gathered the draggled dripping women , their babies huddled up in their torn shawls , their hair untidy and dank beneath their once lilac or pale‐pink smut‐engrained bonnets ; the cabs , shining blue‐black , ploughed through the mud ; the heavy drays splashed from gutter to gutter ; the houses were black and oozy ; the very raindrops on the railings looked black ; the sky was a dirty dull‐grey waste ; only the scarlet letter‐boxes stood out coloured in the general smutty , foggy , neutral tint . “
132589	132612	132572	132572	you	379	” said Dick grimly , as they passed the ground‐glass windows and colonnade and coloured glass globes of one of these establishments . “
132681	132710	132665	132665	they	3029	” Always that indirect attack upon Hamlin and his friends : it was just and reasonable ; yet , coming from Brown , it somehow grated upon Anne . “
132716	132720	132665	132665	they	3029	” she said . “
132760	132765	132755	132755	I	0	” she added boldly , “
132804	132805	132812	132812	he	442	” “
132814	132818	132812	132812	he	442	” sneered Brown , “
132828	132845	132820	132820	he	442	” They fell to talking about the lecture , and then about Richard Brown ’s plans . “
132855	132859	132846	132846	I	0	” he said , “
132871	132872	132866	132867	Mr Gillespie	443	” “
132888	132889	132875	132875	They	3035	” “
132934	132966	132967	132967	I	0	” and he turned and looked at her . There was a curious expression , what she could not understand , except that it was defiant , in Dick ’s face . “
133002	133029	132993	132994	Mr Hamlin	145	” Anne could not have explained why she felt bound , at this particular moment , to throw Hamlin ’s generosity in her cousin ’s face . “
133034	133047	132993	132994	Mr Hamlin	145	” answered Brown , suppressing something he had been about to retort , “
133090	133091	133094	133094	you	3038	” “
133104	133128	133099	133099	you	3038	” And yet , thought Anne , until he had been piqued by Hamlin ’s offer , he had forgotten all about her . “
133139	133140	133132	133132	you	3038	” “
133167	133192	133132	133132	you	3038	” And he proceeded to explain the various questions which he intended studying , the various evils into whose reason he wished to look . “
133204	133208	133132	133132	you	3038	” he said . “
133388	133389	133381	133386	patient working on the public mind	3053	” “
133398	133399	133400	133400	One	620	” “
133417	133451	133400	133400	One	620	” Anne was silent . Dick ’s words were like military music to her . Oh to be able to join him , to march by his side , to carry his arms ! “
133468	133473	133474	133474	You	3057	” Dick went on . “
133480	133486	133474	133474	You	3057	” said Anne , anxiously . “
133509	133510	133505	133505	Richmond	440	” “
133632	133690	133620	133626	some one who knows German and French	3066	” Anne felt a lump in her throat . Oh that she had been a man , instead of being this useless , base creature of mere comely looks , a woman , set apart for the contemplation of æsthetes ! If she had been a man , and could have helped a man like Richard Brown ! “
133702	133735	133692	133692	I	0	” added Brown , and he dropped the subject . They walked on for some moments in silence ; then he began questioning her about Lewis , and Chough , and Dennistoun . “
133744	133748	133749	133749	he	379	” said Anne ; “
133836	133837	133830	133830	I	0	” “
133876	133877	133846	133847	Mr Lewis	364	” “
133886	133899	133880	133880	I	0	” and Anne seemed suddenly to understand her instinctive horror of Lewis . “
133908	133909	133901	133901	Hamlin	379	” “
133949	133950	133942	133942	he	353	” “
133959	133960	133953	133953	Lewis	353	” “
133965	133999	133953	133953	Lewis	353	” Anne resented being thus cross‐questioned about Hamlin , but she was quite unable to prevaricate in her answers — her nature was too frank , and Richard ’s questions were too direct . “
134009	134028	134000	134000	You	0	” he suddenly asked , or rather affirmed . Anne flushed , but did not answer at once . “
134035	134043	134029	134029	I	0	” she said , after a moment . “
134065	134085	134062	134062	I	0	” Richard looked at her with pity , and at the same time with that implacable scrutiny of his . “
134099	134103	134088	134088	your	0	” he said . “
134116	134117	134118	134118	Chough	379	” “
134136	134137	134129	134129	I	0	” “
134173	134181	134162	134162	Hamlin	379	” Anne turned very white and trembled . “
134219	134220	134201	134201	he	145	” “
134229	134269	134223	134223	you	0	” Richard had stopped as they walked along the Hammersmith embankment . It was a very quiet spot , and not a soul was out in the thin , grey , drizzly fog . Anne hesitated for a moment . “
134295	134346	134347	134347	You	0	” She did not look in Brown ’s face as she answered , but stared vaguely at the river , at the dripping trees , the grey willow branches pulled backwards and forwards by the grey current ; at the houses opposite , and the boats dim in the fog . “
134353	134360	134361	134361	Anne	171	” repeated Richard in a whisper . “
134366	134367	134361	134361	Anne	171	” “
134385	134386	134383	134383	Richard	223	” “
134425	134445	134446	134446	I	0	” Anne looked for a moment at the swirling waters , at the willow twigs whirled hither and thither . “
134452	134458	134446	134446	I	0	” There was a pause . “
134472	134473	134466	134466	you	0	” “
134497	134498	134493	134493	he	145	” “
134515	134516	134517	134517	I	0	” “
134564	134574	134579	134579	you	171	” Richard Brown burst into a strange shrill laugh . “
134588	134599	134579	134579	you	171	” he exclaimed , but always in the same undertone . “
134816	134817	134818	134818	Richard	223	” “
134820	134826	134818	134818	Richard	223	” said Anne , hotly , “
134850	134851	134852	134852	My	0	” “
134875	134886	134867	134867	Anne	171	” and he laid his hand heavily on her arm . “
134894	134899	134887	134887	You	223	” she answered icily , “
134908	134909	134910	134910	I	0	” “
134920	134928	134918	134918	Anne	171	” and his voice became suddenly supplicating , “
135085	135086	135077	135078	that man	1086	” “
135134	135141	135165	135165	I	0	” Richard paused for a minute . “
135144	135148	135149	135149	you	171	” he cried , “
135161	135162	135165	135165	I	0	” “
135186	135187	135189	135189	he	145	” “
135205	135206	135207	135207	He	145	” “
135242	135243	135234	135234	he	145	” “
135290	135291	135268	135268	he	145	” “
135333	135338	135322	135322	I	0	” Richard turned round . “
135344	135348	135322	135322	I	0	” he cried , “
135425	135430	135435	135435	women	3959	” Anne laughed bitterly . “
135470	135486	135487	135487	You	0	” And Anne broke a twig off a bush and threw it into the stream . “
135533	135534	135515	135515	you	171	” “
135545	135552	135515	135515	you	171	” cried poor Anne , despairingly . “
135608	135609	135600	135600	You	171	” “
135613	135623	135624	135624	you	229	” said Anne gently , touched by this enthusiasm , “
135666	135667	135668	135668	You	171	” “
135674	135678	135679	135679	Anne	171	” cried Brown . “
135745	135815	135719	135720	a woman	3960	” Richard looked straight before him : Anne could see his face quiver . A coldness came all over her : a coldness and a heat . She felt as if she must cry out . It was too sudden , too wonderful . The vision of being Richard Brown ’s wife overcame her like some celestial vision a fasting saint . But she made an effort over herself . “
135822	135826	135719	135720	a woman	3960	” she said ; “
135836	135854	135855	135855	Anne	171	” She hesitated : the longing for what she knew herself to be renouncing was too great . “
135857	135865	135855	135855	Anne	171	” cried Richard , seizing her hand , “
135883	135940	135878	135878	I	0	” It was like the outburst of another nature , a strange , unsuspected ego , bursting out from beneath the philanthropist ’s cool and self‐sacrificing surface . That sudden contact gave Anne a shock which woke her , restored her to herself ; it horrified her almost . She made him let go her hand . “
135947	135951	135878	135878	I	0	” she said , “
135965	135977	135963	135963	Dick	229	” She was sorry the moment after she had said it . “
135984	135988	135978	135978	I	0	” cried Richard . “
135991	135995	135978	135978	I	0	” said Anne . “
136015	136035	136013	136013	you	0	” There was a command , a threat implied in her voice . Brown somehow felt ashamed of himself . “
136042	136047	136038	136038	you	0	” he said flatly . “
136050	136859	136860	136860	I	0	” said Anne . And she walked away and entered the house — Hamlin ’s house . THE sudden revelation of her cousin ’s feeling was more than a shock , it was a blow to Anne . In her loneliness , in her dreary waiting for the hour of sacrifice , Richard Brown ’s friendship had , almost without her knowing it , been her great consolation and support . It had given her a sense of safety and repose to think that , in the midst of all the morbid passion and fantastic vanity which seemed to surround her , there was a possibility of honest companionship , of affection which meant merely reciprocal esteem and sympathy in the objects of life ; wholesome prose in the middle of unhealthy poetry . This was now gone : Richard Brown loved her , wanted her ; it was the old nauseous story over again ; the sympathy , the comradeship , the quiet brotherly and sisterly affection had all been a sham , a sham for her and for himself . Was Mrs Macgregor right , and was there , of really genuine and vital in the world , only the desire of the man for the woman and of the woman for the man , with all its brood of vanity and baseness , and all its trappings of poetry and sympathy and self‐sacrifice ? Anne looked round her , and she saw men like Chough and Dennistoun and Lewis , base or doing their best to become it ; Hamlin , her girlish ideal of poetical love , had gone the same way ; and now the one man who had remained to her as an object of friendship and respect , her cousin Dick , had preached against selfish æstheticism , had talked her into his positivistic philanthropy — had conjured her to respect her nobler nature , her soul , her generous instincts — had supplicated her not to degrade herself,—nay , had quibbled with right and wrong , had urged her to break her trust,—what for ? that he might satisfy his whim of possessing her . The solitude and the chilliness around Anne had increased ; she wished for good , but she disbelieved in its existence . Add to this that she felt she was now no longer at liberty to see so much of Dick as she had formerly done ; instead of a consolation and a support , his presence seemed to her now more of a danger and an insult . So she waited , hopeless and solitary , for the hour of the sacrifice to strike ; for Hamlin to claim her . To fulfil that debt , to suffer that moral death‐blow , seemed to her now the one certainty , the one aim of her life . Such was the bulk of Miss Brown ’s condition ; but there were streakings of another colour which made it , on the whole , only more gloomy . The possibility , the vision which had for a moment been projected on to her mind , of becoming Richard Brown ’s wife , of sharing in all those thoughts and endeavours which were her highest ideal , would return to her every now and then in strange sudden gleams . And this possibility , or rather this which was an impossibility , made the real necessity of her life only the gloomier for the contrast . Anne had vaguely aspired after a life of nobler sympathies and stronger aims , but she had never gone so far as to dream of sharing the life of her cousin ; and she thought that , had matters been different , had she been free , had Hamlin not claimed her , had Richard not loved her ( for his love , his selfish tempting her away from her duty , seemed to her a sort of dishonour to him and her ) , she would have had the fulfilment of her most far‐fetched desires within her grasp,—merely increased moral numbness , the sullen pain of resignation , towards a fate which was too slow in coming . Anne did not pay much heed to Hamlin and his doings : it seemed to her , whose life in the last months had appeared like years , that it was always the same monotony ; Hamlin was waiting for her to fall in love with him , watching whether she was not in love already ; offering her , in those vague , Platonic , elegiac speeches of his about the necessity of a higher life of which he no longer had much hope , of a pure passion which he feared he was unworthy to experience , an opportunity for saying “
136868	137247	136860	136860	I	0	” Veiled in Dantesque mysticism , muffled in Shakespearian obscurity , such was , to her who understood and was expected to understand , the gist of all the poems which he wrote . The day would come , Anne saw it clearly , when some trifling quarrel , some trifling jealousy , some rebuff to his vanity , or some sense of more than usual vacuity , would get the better of Hamlin ’s patience , and when he would say to Anne that he loved her and that her love was his life . She had gone over it all so often in fancy , with the bitter sarcasm of understanding that whole , to her so tragic , little comedy . But had she been a person more observant and penetrating than she was ( for her long delusion about her cousin Richard plainly shows that she was neither ) , or had she been less engrossed in her own conception of events , Miss Brown might have noticed , as spring turned into summer , that certain slight changes were taking place in Hamlin . He had , without any intentional rupture , taken to seeing much less of Chough and Dennistoun ; he scarcely ever visited his old master , Mrs Spencer , or any others of the school ; he refused invitations to parties , or if he had accepted , found them too great a bore at the last moment ; the only house , except that at Hammersmith , which he frequented , was Madame Elaguine ’s . He used to attend all her spiritualistic séances , and alternate between finding spiritualism a vulgar fraud and a mystic possibility ; he used to quarrel with Edmund Lewis , and at the same time to seek his company more than any other man ’s . He would vacillate also between the most extreme opinions about his cousin Sacha . One day he would entertain Anne by the hour about her virtues , her talents , her persecution ; the next he would be captiously fault‐finding , accusing Madame Elaguine of being a brainless little flirt , a mere ordinary Russian , who cared only for excitement and being perpetually en scène . “
137265	137278	136860	136860	I	0	” Anne would ask , not without bitterness in her own heart . “
137295	137563	136860	136860	I	0	” Be it as it may , Hamlin was restless , subject to strange ups and downs of humour , sometimes in a state of vague unaccountable cheerfulness , sometimes horribly depressed . To any one but Anne it would have occurred that there must be some novelty in his life . But Anne did not see ; indeed , from a sort of instinct , she observed Hamlin as little as possible : she had loved him when she had not known him ; the less she saw , except his gentle , chivalric , poetic , idealising surface , the better . But one day — it might be a fortnight after the memorable walk home from Richmond ’s lecture — Anne found among her letters one , evidently delivered by hand or dropped into the letterbox , the address upon which . puzzled her considerably . It was not merely that the handwriting was unknown to her , but that it was so utterly unlike any human handwriting that could be conceived ; it was like a child ’s elaborate copy of print , but executed with a precision , and at the same time a certain artistic chic , of which a child is incapable . Had she been in Italy , Anne would have expected to find within that envelope one of those marvellously written out and illuminated sonnets which certain needy individuals , counts and marquises fallen into bad circumstances and anxious to redeem their only bed from the pawnbroker ’s , serve up at regular intervals to English and Americans , “
137582	137633	137634	137635	MADONNA MIA	444	” are supposed to include munificence to beggars . To Anne ’s astonishment the letter which she found actually was in Italian . But it was Italian of Stratford‐atte‐Bow , and her first impulse was to burst out laughing . But the next moment she reddened with surprise and indignation . “
137637	137679	137687	137688	the honest	3115	” began this epistle , which had evidently been concocted with a ‘ Decameron ’ and a Baedeker ’s travelling phrase‐book , and which sounded like English written by a German waiter who should have taken to Spenser after the first dozen lessons,—“Inasmuch
137738	137767	137771	137771	cousins	2104	” Anne turned the note round and round , and read and re‐read it , her heart beating as if she had received a slap in the face . “
137773	137817	137821	137823	a base woman	2716	” Her first thought was that this was an allusion to herself and Richard Brown ; some one had understood what she had not , and was suspecting what was not true . But then her mind picked up that other mysterious phrase , “
137825	138997	138998	138998	I	0	” The cousins were not herself and Dick , but Hamlin and Sacha Elaguine , and that was the base woman alluded to . It was as if a great light had shone in Anne ’s face ; she was dazzled , dazed . The friendship of two cousins ! Was there , then , more than friendship between them ? Did Hamlin love Sacha , or Sacha Hamlin ? Anne gave a great sigh ; but it was a sigh of relief,—the sigh of the drowning wretch who is dragged on shore — the sigh of the hunted fugitive who sees his pursuers turn back . The friendship of cousins ? Why , then , she was saved , she was free ! But her excitement lasted only a minute . Was she to believe an anonymous letter , evidently malicious , evidently intended to slander an innocent woman , to sow discord or to ruin her own happiness ? It was evidently from an enemy of Madame Elaguine ’s ; it could not be from a friend of her own ; for a friend would have spoken to her clearly and openly , or would have spared her what , in the eyes of the world , which regarded her as Hamlin ’s affianced bride , must have been a horrible revelation . It was an infamous or ridiculous calumny . From whom did it come ? Anne thought for a long time ; she counted up her own enemies and Madame Elaguine ’s . At one moment she suspected Edmund Lewis , at another Mrs Spencer ; but she was too honest to credit any one of them with such a piece of treachery . Madame Elaguine ’s mysterious enemies — yes , it must be they ! thought Anne ; it must be a new trick of theirs , a device for alienating her from her new friends . Anne ’s heart sank . Why must such terrible temptations be put upon her ? Miss Brown meditated for some time upon what she ought to do . She felt indignant with the mysterious author of the letter ; and she felt that , as it contained a slander , it was her duty to let those whom it accused know the whole matter . Should she show that paper to Hamlin ? Once in her life , Anne gave way to a movement of cowardice . That letter , shown by her to Hamlin , would , she knew , bring the catastrophe . Hamlin would be furious and delighted ; he would think she was jealous and unhappy ; he would on the spot declare that he loved her , and ask her to be his wife . This consummation of her sacrifice , which , in the dull apathy of the last fortnight , she had almost prayed for , now terrified her . When it came , she was ready ; but to hasten it — to bring it down untimely on herself — to do that , Anne had not the heart . After all , it concerned Madame Elaguine most , and she would doubtless have some clue to the writer of the letter , and consequently take the matter less to heart . Anne determined to show the letter to her . She thought she would go to her at once , or write ; but a faint , faint , almost unconscious instinct of self‐preservation bade her wait awhile ; wait till she should have an opportunity of seeing Madame Elaguine in the natural course of events . Miss Brown had made up her mind that the mysterious letter had no sort of truth in it ; yet despite this decision , which lay , cut and dry , on the surface of her consciousness , a hidden imperceptible movement was going on within her . She seemed suddenly to remember things which she had not at the time noticed , to see things which had not before existed , and must still have been there yesterday as well as to‐day . Things which had been meaningless acquired a meaning ; things which had seemed without connection began to group themselves . A change had taken place of late in Hamlin ; he had become solitary and morose , and more than usually up and down in spirits — he had seen only Sacha and her . How much had he seen of Sacha ? Anne did not know , but she imagined a great deal . Then she remembered how he had taken to finding fault with the little woman , to running her down systematically to himself and to Anne . Could it be that he felt himself tempted to break his engagement ? Anne knew Hamlin too well by this time to credit him with that . If such a thing should happen,—if , finding insensibly that Anne was not what he had imagined , disappointed with her coldness , hurt by her censoriousness , and attracted by a woman who was everything that she was not — Hamlin should ever come to feel for Sacha more than mere friendship , it was not in his nature to perceive his danger and to struggle ; he would let himself go to sleep in the pleasantness of a new sensation , he would drift on vaguely , and start up in surprise . A new love was for him the most poignant of temptations,—a new love in its still half‐unconscious , Platonic , vague condition ; and he was not a man to resist such a temptation ; indeed he had gone through life with the philosophy that a poet may dally with any emotion , however questionable , as long as he does not actually commit a dishonourable action . Oh no , Hamlin ’s ups and downs could not be struggles or remorse ; so Anne decided that it was all fancy , all calumny . And she determined to give the letter to Sacha on the first opportunity . Madame Elaguine at last made up her mind that her little Helen ought to learn something ; and with the impulsiveness of her nature , she determined that she , whom she had always kept under her own eyes , should go to school . Why there should be such a swing of the pendulum , and why Madame Elaguine should not rather hire a governess to teach the child in her own house , Miss Brown could not explain , except by the capriciousness , the tendency always to be in extremes , of Hamlin ’s cousin . Anyhow , Sacha had determined that Helen must soon go to school , and she had written to Anne begging her , before the child went , to permit her to share for a week or two the lessons which Miss Brown was giving the little Choughs . “
139001	139005	138998	138998	I	0	” she wrote , “
139145	139315	139316	139316	I	0	” Anne was touched by this letter . Poor Madame Elaguine , although she did care too much for Baudelaire and Gautier , and did tell too many anecdotes about married women ’s lovers and married men ’s cocottes for Anne ’s taste , was yet a good and brave little woman ; and she must be helped , if one could help her . And Anne was doubly indignant about that anonymous letter she put in her pocket , and went to call on Hamlin ’s cousin . Madame Elaguine was in one of her unstrung moments . Anne found her lying on a sofa , a heap of books about her , reading none , fidgety and vacant . She brightened up for a moment on Miss Brown ’s entry , and received her with a kind of rapturous gratitude , quite out of all proportion ; but she speedily relapsed into her depressed condition . Anne thought it better not to introduce the business at once . “
139321	139325	139327	139327	you	3130	” she said , “
139366	139371	139341	139341	you	3130	” Madame Elaguine hesitated . “
139377	139382	139341	139341	you	3130	” she suddenly exclaimed , “
139537	139574	139575	139575	I	0	” Anne looked at the Russian , who had raised herself on her sofa convulsively , and thatched and torn to pieces a flower which was lying on her , with a great look of pity . “
139580	139582	139594	139594	I	0	” cried Sacha—“I
139615	139634	139601	139601	I	0	” and she suddenly burst out laughing . Anne did not know whether to cry or to laugh . “
139654	139663	139601	139601	I	0	” she said , in her business‐like way ; “
139788	139789	139760	139760	you	0	” “
139811	139818	139802	139802	I	0	” exclaimed Madame Elaguine , vehemently . “
139821	139825	139806	139806	spies	3150	” said Anne ; “
139859	139860	139861	139861	I	0	” “
139876	139882	139883	139883	Helen	415	” repeated Sacha , hotly . “
139889	139898	139883	139883	Helen	415	” Anne felt angry with the little woman . “
139908	139912	139883	139883	Helen	415	” she said ; “
139933	139944	139925	139926	a governess	2497	” She felt as if there were something wrong here . “
139954	139958	139960	139960	you	0	” cried Sacha ; “
140004	140015	139986	139986	she	3159	” Anne had forgotten that . How unjust she was ! “
140018	140022	139986	139986	she	3159	” she said ; “
140112	140137	140102	140103	the Choughs	3167	” Madame Elaguine rose , and , to Anne ’s immeasurable surprise , she flung herself on her neck , and began to sob . “
140144	140148	140139	140139	Anne	171	” she said , “
140179	140180	140175	140175	I	0	” “
140217	140305	140334	140334	Anne	171	” Somehow or other Miss Brown , for all her good‐nature , always had a harsh instinct whenever she saw Sacha in such a condition as this — an instinct that the Russian could prevent it — that such fits of tears and abjectness were mere self‐indulgence , and self‐indulgence which was utterly incompatible with Anne ’s idea of self‐respect . But Madame Elaguine could not be reined in . She fell back in an arm‐chair in an agony of hysterical sobbing , mixed with ghastly laughing . “
140390	140434	140382	140382	you	171	” and she suddenly burst out laughing . Anne was very white . She had heard and she had understood ; but she had no right to have heard or to have understood . Suddenly Sacha started up and looked strangely about her . “
140441	140453	140437	140437	you	171	” she asked , with a start as if of terror . “
140474	140475	140468	140468	I	0	” “
140480	140484	140487	140487	you	171	” said Anne ; “
140505	140506	140498	140499	a governess	2497	” “
140509	140520	140498	140499	a governess	2497	” cried Madame Elaguine , with a sigh of relief . “
140637	140638	140626	140626	I	0	” “
140651	140655	140660	140660	they	3174	” said Anne . “
140671	140676	140660	140660	they	3174	” Madame Elaguine nodded . “
140711	140752	140758	140758	they	3174	” and opening the door of her bedroom , Sachs pointed to the wall opposite . Over Madame Elaguine ’s bed hung a painted portrait of little Helen ; but where the face should have been was a dark spot . “
140761	140765	140758	140758	they	3174	” cried Anne . “
140778	140795	140768	140768	they	3174	” said the Swiss maid , who was sitting in the room , with a shrug . “
140819	140832	140816	140816	Madame	360	” Something cynical and insolent in the woman struck Anne very much . “
140836	140847	140816	140816	Madame	360	” she said , leading Sacha back to the drawing‐room . “
140863	140864	140852	140852	your	3178	” “
140871	140879	140881	140881	I	0	” said Sacha , with clenched teeth , “
140921	140922	140923	140923	You	3178	” “
140937	140991	140929	140930	a husband	4417	” said Anne , quietly . Madame Elaguine turned scarlet . Was she afraid of having let out her secret ? But to Anne ’s surprise , instead of looking anxious , a sudden look of triumphant amusement passed over her face , a strange brazen look , and she burst out laughing — “
141033	141034	141035	141035	You	3178	” “
141044	141050	141035	141035	You	3178	” said Anne , gently . “
141062	141082	141059	141060	Madame Elaguine	360	” At the door she met Hamlin . It seemed to her that he looked guilty , and coloured . “
141124	141158	141159	141159	You	0	” Hamlin was unnerved by the allusion to the persecution . He stood silent for a moment , with a long lingering look on Anne , like a man making a mental comparison . “
141167	141173	141164	141165	Miss Brown	171	” he said , slowly ; “
141185	141186	141187	141187	Sacha	447	” “
141195	141311	141187	141187	Sacha	447	” answered Anne . And Hamlin went up and Miss Brown went out . MISS BROWN did not hand over the anonymous letter either to Madame Elaguine or to Hamlin . She felt that she had now no longer a right to do so . Sacha had , in the vague pouring out of words of that fit which Anne had witnessed , let out her secret ; but Anne had no right to use it or to act upon it . She could only watch and wait . Wait!—but in what a different spirit ! Wait , not for the hour of death , but for the moment of freedom , of complete freedom . “
141318	141334	141187	141187	Sacha	447	” asked Mrs Spencer , meeting her on her way back from Madame Elaguine ’s . “
141355	141356	141357	141358	No one	3899	” “
141364	141368	141357	141358	No one	3899	” said Anne . “
141378	141379	141369	141369	I	0	” “
141396	141400	141388	141388	you	0	” Anne laughed . “
141409	141414	141406	141407	Madame Elaguine	360	” Mrs Spencer frowned . “
141449	141450	141451	141452	Mr Hamlin	145	” “
141456	141462	141451	141452	Mr Hamlin	145	” answered Anne , sternly . “
141467	141499	141451	141452	Mr Hamlin	145	” said Mrs Spencer that evening to her father and husband , and to one or two of those well‐thinking æsthetes de la vieille roche , whom Hamlin had basely deserted . “
141599	141600	141592	141595	that little Russian vixen	3200	” “
141607	141638	141640	141640	ye	286	” objected her father , seated among an admiring crowd in his dusty studio at Hampstead , among his ghastly Saviours on gilded grounds , and Nativities , in despite of perspective—“how
141652	141653	141640	141640	ye	286	” “
141664	141665	141659	141659	you	3893	” “
141677	141693	141668	141669	Mr Saunders	451	” chorussed the two or three elderly poetesses and untidy Giottesque painters of the circle . “
141705	141716	141668	141669	Mr Saunders	451	” Mrs Spencer sighed , as much as to say , “
141738	141761	141765	141765	he	3207	” Cosmo Chough had been reading some of his ‘ Triumph of Womanhood , ’ lying on the hearth‐rug in the studio . “
141769	141780	141765	141765	he	3207	” he asked , darting up , with beaming eyes . “
141798	141799	141783	141783	I	0	” “
141802	141806	141783	141783	I	0	” cried Chough , “
141814	141819	141812	141812	I	0	” but he stopped . “
141837	141838	141830	141830	papa	3893	” “
141848	142620	142621	142621	I	0	” said old Saunders ; whereupon he was jeered at with all the respect due to so great an artist . For the first time after so long , Anne felt happy . A load was off her mind . That Hamlin should love Sacha , and Sacha Hamlin , was the miracle which alone could release her , and releasing her , put an end at the same time to the horrible false position into which Hamlin ’s self‐engagement to a woman so different from himself created for him also in the future . And now only did it strike Anne that perhaps she had no right towards Hamlin to pay off her debt of gratitude at the expense of what might be his future misery as well as hers . Had Hamlin been sufficiently infatuated to wish to marry a woman whom he did not really and solidly love , would it have been right on her part to let him have his way ? All these doubts , which she had previously put behind her , as mere selfish sophistry to tempt her from her duty , now rushed home to her . But they came no longer to torment , but to add to the relief , the cessation of bondage . Hamlin would never , she said to herself , have been really happy with her as a wife ; and now it happened that he had met the woman who , whatever her shortcomings , seemed to suit him . That Sacha Elaguine was an undisciplined , thoughtless , rather sensuous woman , loving excitement and art , and indifferent to abstract good and evil , Anne fully admitted ; but were not these the very qualities which would make her appreciate what in Hamlin was original and charming , and blind her , for her happiness ( and added Anne , convinced by sad failure of the futility of trying to change people ’s nature ) and for his , to his weak sides ? And Sacha had just that exuberant passionateness , more of the temperament and the fancy than of the heart , which Hamlin required , and which she , Anne , so lamentably lacked . For Sacha also it would mean a new life : it would mean , for the poor , excitable little woman , always defrauded of affection and of an object of adoration , a reality in her life , something to love , to worship , to pet , to flatter — something to make her forget her miserable bedraggled childhood , her wretched married life , her persecution and her maladies . This it would mean to them ; and to Anne it would mean . . . Ah ! Anne did not dare to think what it would mean for her ; she was not yet sure . She might be mistaken , she was still bound to doubt . And still , that great bliss , at which Anne was afraid to look , meant only what to other women would have been a poor gift : liberty to gain her bread , to feel and think for herself — a life ’s solitude . Days passed on ; and Anne , instead of being , as she expected , disappointed , was confirmed by every little thing in her belief . On one pretext or other , Hamlin was perpetually at Madame Elaguine ’s . The latest excuse for seeing her was to paint her portrait ; so , for a number of days , Sacha came every morning to the house at Hammersmith , and spent a couple of hours at least closeted with Hamlin in the studio . Anne usually received her , and she frequently stayed to lunch ; and Miss Brown could not help feeling indignant at the coolness with which Hamlin amused himself playing with two women : he was perpetually trailing after Sacha , he was perpetually , she felt persuaded , talking about life and love and himself in a way which was equivalent to making love to the little woman ; and yet , he would still come and sit at Anne ’s feet , and represent himself as the dejected and heartbroken creature whom only a strong and pure woman could help . Once , Miss Brown had considerable difficulty in restraining herself when , after a day spent with his cousin , he came in the evening to her , and began the usual talk about his soul being shrivelled up . “
142630	142634	142621	142621	I	0	” he exclaimed . “
142702	142703	142686	142686	I	0	” “
142708	142714	142686	142686	I	0	” said Anne , icily ; “
142758	142787	142686	142686	I	0	” Hamlin was silent . He had — she felt sure , and she was indignant as if at an affront — imagined that he might tempt her into saying—“I
142792	142831	142686	142686	I	0	” while his poor , giddy , irresponsible cousin was being dragged further and further into a passion which she would never recover from — for she , at least , had a heart and he had none . “
142836	142844	142845	142845	I	0	” cried Hamlin , after a minute . “
142897	143017	142894	142894	my	0	” Hamlin fixed his eyes on the ground . He looked very weak and miserable , and like a man who feels that he has dishonoured himself in some way . But to Anne it was all merely a piece of acting — the climax of that long and nauseous comedy of self‐reproach and self‐sympathising , of pretending to hanker after evil and good , that was equally indifferent to him,—that comedy which had begun long ago in his letters to her at Coblenz , which she had watched with admiration , and love , and agony at first , and with contempt and disgust at last . And she was hardened towards him . She could have said to him—“Go
143022	143276	143020	143020	Sacha	447	” only that at this moment such a notion seemed an insult to his cousin , and that a horrible fear possessed her that he would seize upon that , and try and work her and her anger into this very patchwork of artificial and morbid sentiment over which he was for ever gloating . Once or twice , indeed , it did occur to Anne that perhaps this whole flirtation with Madame Elaguine had been got up by Hamlin for her , benefit ; that he was playing with the heart of the foolish little woman ( who did not realise that he was making her love him ) merely to provoke Anne ’s jealousy — to move her by this means , since he had failed by every other . But even if it had been thus begun , and Miss Brown shrank from believing that Hamlin would have been so deliberately base , it was clear that the comedy had become reality — that he cared for his cousin and she for him . Perhaps — perhaps — all this remorse was real after all . But Anne ’s heart had got hardened against him : she could no longer , do what he liked , believe that there was anything genuine in him . Meanwhile Hamlin ’s perpetual attendance on Madame Elaguine had become apparent to every one ; and even Mrs Spencer admitted to her father that Hamlin could not have proposed that day she had met Anne . “
143312	143313	143306	143306	she	3216	” “
143319	143324	143306	143306	she	3216	” said her father , “
143342	143343	143333	143334	Miss Brown	171	” “
143352	143386	143345	143345	she	3216	” exclaimed Mrs Spencer ; and forgetting the many acrimonious remarks in which she had indulged against Miss Brown , and the many times she had sighed at Walter Hamlin taking up with a “
143390	143408	143414	143421	one of the noblest women in the world	3218	” instead of with this or the other Sappho or Properzia dei Rossi of her circle , she added—“I
143459	143469	143444	143444	I	0	” In which sentiment poor Mr Spencer modestly acquiesced . “
143490	143627	143470	143470	I	0	” she said . Of course no one else did have the courage . Edmund Lewis became every day more and more offensive in manner to Miss Brown ; he hated her , and he enjoyed seeing her what he considered ousted . Mrs Macgregor , although she went on abusing Madame Elaguine for being the Sacha of other days , lived too much in her bedroom , saw too little of what was going on even in the house , to guess at anything . Mary and Marjory Leigh looked on in wonder and indignation ; but Anne ’s calm and cheerful manner forbade their saying anything . Did not Anne know better than any one how Hamlin felt towards her ? and if Anne was satisfied , must it not all be a delusion ? “
143635	143647	143630	143630	Hamlin	145	” said Mary , forgetting about the letter to Harry Collett ; “
143676	143684	143685	143685	I	0	” The mere thought seemed a profanation . “
143695	143701	143689	143689	Hamlin	145	” said Marjory , sternly ; “
143724	143725	143716	143716	Anne	171	” “
143736	143743	143716	143716	Anne	171	” said Harry Collett , mercifully . “
143837	143838	143824	143824	I	0	” “
143855	143868	143846	143846	Hamlin	145	” said Marjory to her sister , when Mr Collett was gone . “
143891	143904	143907	143907	you	0	” Mary laughed , and catching hold of Marjory , kissed her . “
143910	143918	143907	143907	you	0	” cried Marjory , indignantly breaking loose . “
143946	143947	143907	143907	you	0	” “
143965	144136	143959	143959	I	0	” And thus the Leighs , being very happy themselves , forgot Anne Brown ’s supposed grievances , even as the best of us , being happy , will forget the wrongs of others . But there was one person who could not forget what seemed to him the most frightful sacrilege in the world ; and that person was Mr Cosmo Chough . He considered himself as the assistant high priest of the divinity called Anne Brown , and he believed that it was his duty to bring back the high priest in person , namely Hamlin , to the worship from which the powers of evil had momentarily seduced him . But he thought it more simple to apply to the offended goddess than to her recalcitrant priest , who , to tell the truth , had treated his vague remarks with considerable scorn . Accordingly , one day ( June had come round now ) Miss Brown was informed that Mr Cosmo Chough desired to see her . “
144145	144215	144142	144143	Mr Chough	248	” said Anne , stretching out her hand to the little man , who came in with even more than usually brushed coat and hat , and more than usually blacked boots , his lips squeezed into a long , cat‐like grimace of solemnity , his brows knit gloomily , and walking on the tips of his toes like an operatic conspirator . Mr Chough sat down and sighed . “
144222	144264	144266	144266	me	0	” asked Miss Brown , with her hand on the bell . The poet of womanhood darted up , laid one hand lightly on Anne ’s arm , and opening and straightening out the other with an eloquent gesture , said — “
144289	144296	144275	144275	I	0	” Anne could not help smiling . “
144312	144336	144297	144297	You	3236	” she said . Mr Chough sighed , and waited gloomily until tea had been brought , absolutely refusing to open his lips . “
144346	144391	144338	144338	you	3236	” asked Anne , thinking it might be some new bit of the ‘ Triumph of Womanhood , ’ which Cosmo Chough most innocently read to all the ladies of his acquaintance , only Anne having the courage to say every now and then , “
144419	144420	144405	144405	people	577	” “
144427	144433	144405	144405	people	577	” answered Chough , solemnly . “
144451	144452	144434	144434	I	0	” “
144469	144470	144466	144467	Mr Chough	248	” “
144475	144487	144489	144489	me	0	” began Cosmo , stooping forward on his chair and frowning , “
144525	144526	144512	144512	I	0	” “
144529	144535	144512	144512	I	0	” cried Anne , laughing , “
144570	144571	144564	144565	a duke	1651	” “
144675	144709	144711	144711	mark	3253	” and Cosmo Chough , stretching out one long thin leg , so as to display his small foot and the martial wrinkles of his boot , and propping his elbow on his other knee—“now
144735	144773	144723	144735	A certain lady , whom I will designate as the Queen of Night”—and	6487	Night”—and he made his cat ’s grimace , and pausing , looked mournfully at Miss Brown , who sat quietly by , bending over a piece of embroidery which she was doing from a design by Hamlin . “
144776	144777	144723	144735	A certain lady , whom I will designate as the Queen of Night”—and	6487	” “
144871	144890	144891	144891	I	0	” Little by little Miss Brown had guessed what Chough was hiding beneath this grotesque piece of romancing . “
144937	144993	144929	144929	you	3261	” Anne spoke coldly and indifferently ; and Chough , who , despite his vaunted knowledge of the human heart , was the most obtuse of good‐hearted little people , actually prided himself upon having put his case so delicately , that Miss Brown could not even guess as yet that she was alluded to . “
145033	145042	145005	145008	The Queen of Night	4214	” ( Chough always liked to show off his French)—“has
145235	145251	145252	145252	You	0	” Miss Brown suddenly sat bolt‐upright , and fixing her eyes on Chough , said — “
145268	145269	145261	145261	you	0	” “
145277	145286	145252	145252	You	0	” asked Cosmo Chough , striking an attitude . “
145310	145311	145252	145252	You	0	” “
145316	145337	145252	145252	You	0	” howled Chough ; but in reality what he was thinking of was Miss Brown ’s stricture upon the Italian . “
145343	145351	145340	145341	Miss Brown	171	” he cried , after a minute , “
145425	145451	145452	145453	Oh fool	3283	” Poor Cosmo had let go all his affectation ; he wrung his hands in real distress , and he actually seemed to be crying . “
145475	145490	145455	145455	fool	3284	” His sorrow was so genuine that Miss Brown felt quite sorry for him . “
145499	145503	145495	145497	dear Mr Chough	248	” she said , “
145531	145547	145519	145519	I	0	” And she stretched out her hand . Chough struck his head with his fist . “
145591	145592	145585	145585	you	248	” “
145596	145602	145585	145585	you	248	” said Anne , quietly , “
145656	145662	145663	145663	You	248	” Chough gaped in astonishment . “
145675	145676	145663	145663	You	248	” “
145712	145718	145727	145727	you	248	” Anne spoke very composedly . “
145752	145753	145743	145743	you	248	” “
145767	145768	145743	145743	you	248	” “
145822	145823	145802	145802	I	0	” “
145828	145838	145802	145802	I	0	” There was a freezing indifference in her voice . “
146062	146063	146064	146064	I	0	” “
146078	146084	146075	146076	Mr Chough	248	” said Anne , sternly . “
146200	146201	146194	146194	his	145	” “
146206	146212	146230	146230	his	145	” answered Anne , harshly ; “
146251	146252	146240	146240	she	360	” “
146256	146268	146253	146254	His wife	700	” screamed Chough , and looked as if he would faint ; “
146310	146311	146303	146303	you	248	” “
146357	146362	146338	146338	She	360	” Chough started up . “
146373	146383	146338	146338	She	360	” he cried , kissing Anne ’s dress enthusiastically . “
146392	146397	146386	146386	you	248	” she asked angrily . “
146409	146416	146398	146398	I	0	” answered the little man solemnly . “
146479	146480	146464	146464	I	0	” “
146487	146499	146481	146481	I	0	” said Anne sternly , pronouncing every word clearly and slowly . “
146509	146528	146529	146529	You	248	” Poor little Chough was so utterly dumfounded that he had not the breath to finish his sentence . “
146545	146549	146536	146536	I	0	” said Anne . “
146577	146578	146579	146579	You	248	” “
146583	146595	146581	146581	another	5884	” whispered Chough , his eyebrows and whiskers standing on end . “
146603	146604	146581	146581	another	5884	” “
146635	146636	146637	146638	Mr Hamlin	145	” “
146710	146746	146747	146747	You	3317	” There was a silence . Anne took up her piece of work ; Chough sat rapping gently on the table with his finger‐tips , looking wonderingly at her . At last Miss Brown spoke . “
146893	146910	146890	146890	you	3317	” Miss Brown looked very solemn ; and Chough was overcome by an almost religious awe . “
146917	146922	146911	146911	I	0	” he said quietly , “
146962	147326	146958	146958	God	195	” And Anne , who believed only in right and wrong , felt really the better and stronger for the blessing of the preposterous little poet of Messalina and Lucrezia Borgia , who declared himself to be an atheist when he did not declare himself to be a Catholic mystic . SOME time after this conversation with Cosmo Chough , a circumstance took place which caused great momentary excitement , and considerably unsettled Miss Brown ’s mind . The summer had come with a sudden rush ; and Hamlin had had the notion of taking his aunt and Miss Brown , and two or three friends , to spend a week at Wotton . Among these friends was Madame Elaguine . That Hamlin should care to take his cousin to the house where she had played so lamentable a part in her childhood ; that Sacha should endure to confront those invisible ghosts of her uncle , her cousins , her own former self , of all the shameful past , which haunted that house , was quite incomprehensible to Anne . But day by day she was forced to recognise that she was surrounded by incomprehensible ways of feeling and thinking , that she was , in a way , like a person solitary among mankind from deafness or blindness , from incapacity to put herself in their place ; and recognising this , she recognised also , with her unflinching justice , that she had no right to hastily condemn the things which she could not understand . So when Madame Elaguine , on the evening of her arrival at Wotton , insisted on wandering all over the once familiar house , and openly said that she felt a pleasure , the bitter pleasure of self‐inflicted penance , in confronting the past , in humiliating her present self by the company of her former self , Anne merely said to herself that she could not conceive a woman feeling like that — but that , nevertheless , this theatrical and hysterical excitement might , after all , lead to as good a result as her own silent and painful solitary self‐absorption . “
147333	147349	147329	147331	a brazen creature	3325	” Aunt Claudia had cried , when she heard that Sacha was going to Wotton ; “
147408	147409	147410	147410	I	0	” “
147417	147423	147414	147415	Aunt Claudia	247	” Anne had answered resolutely , “
147487	147983	147481	147481	she	360	” So Anne had gone . The self‐humiliation of Madame Elaguine , and the hours she had spent in her room — she had asked for the room which had been hers as a child — crying over the past , did not prevent her being in excessively high spirits the evening following their arrival and the successive one . It would seem as if the painful associations in which she had steeped herself had produced a reaction in her whole nature . She was childishly , almost uproariously gay , played with little Helen the greater part of the afternoon , and after dinner treated the company — that is to say , Anne , Mrs Spencer , Lewis , and Hamlin — to a perfect concert of all manner of wild gipsy songs , Spanish and Russian , sung with a fury which amounted almost to genius ; and followed these up with little French songs , old and new , picked up heaven knows where — from operettes , from peasants , from books — the words of which and the astonishing gaminerie with which they were delivered , amused Lewis to fits of laughing , threw Chough into enthusiasm , annoyed Hamlin a little , puzzled poor Mrs Spencer , and made Anne reflect , as charitably as she could , upon the different standards of propriety which seemed to exist for Englishwomen and for Russians . Madame Elaguine ’s songs made Anne feel quite uncomfortable and angry ; but she said nothing , seeing Mrs Spencer , who could tolerate any amount of impropriety as long as it was medieval and poetic , was evidently putting down this French levity as a mark of the Russian woman ’s depravity ; and she felt somehow , that though she was annoyed herself , and annoyed with good cause , she must not back up Mrs Spencer ’s prejudiced indignation . Cousin Sacha seemed to take a pleasure in vexing Hamlin , in shocking Anne , in making Mrs Spencer think her a wicked creature ; she sang on , in her devil‐may‐care , street‐boy way , with a malicious , childish impudence in her face ; then suddenly , when she saw Hamlin get positively black at what he considered her bad taste — suddenly dropped from her leste French couplets into a strange , wild , Spanish gipsy song , sad and despairing beyond saying . She looked very fascinating , as she sat near the window , resting her guitar on her knee , her tiny feet and embroidered stockings very visible beneath the lace flounces and frills of her thistle‐down dress ; her deep , Russian blue eyes looking , as it seemed , rather into the past than the present , her whole slight , even emaciated , body and face tense with a sort of hysterical emotion . Suddenly she threw the guitar on the sofa . “
147986	147990	147481	147481	she	360	” she cried , “
148035	148060	148031	148031	I	0	” And she walked through the French window on to the wide terrace which surrounded one side of the house and overlooked the lawn . “
148066	148070	148031	148031	I	0	” she said , “
148079	148103	148104	148104	you	3334	” turning with affected deference and timidity to Mrs Spencer , who considered a woman who smoked as little short of an adventuress , “
148118	148119	148112	148112	I	0	” “
148128	148157	148112	148112	I	0	” snorted Mrs Spencer , stalking back into the drawing‐room , and sitting down near the window . The three men immediately produced cigars and cigarettes and matches . “
148165	148170	148163	148163	Walter	145	” said Madame Elaguine ; “
148199	148278	148197	148197	myself	0	” And she went into her bedroom , the last room opening out to the terrace , to fetch her box of tobacco and her cigarette‐papers . In a minute she returned , whistling , in a curious bird‐like whistle , below her breath , and rolling a cigarette in her fingers . Some of the party were seated , some standing . Madame Elaguine came to where Miss Brown was seated , looking into the twilight park . “
148282	148317	148279	148280	Dear Annie	418	” she murmured , putting her arm round Miss Brown ’s neck , in her childish way , and which yet always affected Anne as might the caress of a lamia ’s clammy scales . “
148321	148340	148279	148280	Dear Annie	418	” she said , putting her face close to Anne , and lowering her voice to a whisper , “
148432	148438	148449	148449	Sacha	447	” Anne did not answer . “
148451	148488	148489	148489	I	0	” asked Lewis , in his sultan‐like familiar way . He had a trick of calling her Sacha every now and then , as he had tried , but failed , to call Miss Brown Annie . “
148535	148542	148516	148516	you	3341	” answered Madame Elaguine , coldly . “
148548	148588	148516	148516	you	3341	” exclaimed Cosmo Chough , looking up at the blue evening sky , singularly pure and blue and high , twinkling with stars , and against which the distant trees stood out clear like the sidescenes of a theatre . “
148608	148616	148516	148516	you	3341	” and he pointed at the sky . “
148634	148639	148516	148516	you	3341	” said the Russian . “
148666	148667	148664	148664	Annie	458	” “
148672	148686	148664	148664	Annie	458	” asked Chough , suddenly . They looked up at his startled voice . “
148691	148698	148664	148664	Annie	458	” asked Madame Elaguine , quietly . “
148712	148713	148709	148710	Mr Chough	248	” “
148720	148784	148709	148710	Mr Chough	248	” exclaimed Lewis . In the midst of the general blue dusk , one of the cedars on the lawn , and a screen of trees beyond , had suddenly burst into sight , enveloped in a bright light , which made the grass all round burn out a vivid yellowish‐green against the darkness . Anne turned round quickly and looked behind her . “
148791	148795	148709	148710	Mr Chough	248	” she cried . “
148801	148860	148709	148710	Mr Chough	248	” And before the others could understand , she had rushed towards the other end of the terrace . The light , which had suddenly illumined the piece of lawn , the trees opposite , did issue , a brilliant broad sheet like that of large chandelier , from out of the open window of Sacha ’s room . “
148864	148868	148869	148869	you	3341	” cried Hamlin , “
148884	148885	148869	148869	you	3341	” “
148890	148895	148869	148869	you	3341	” cried Madame Elaguine , “
148909	148990	148991	148991	They	3350	” and she rushed wildly after Anne into her bedroom . An extraordinary spectacle met Miss Brown first , and the rest of the party an instant or two later . The large old‐fashioned bed of Cousin Sacha , which stood in the centre of the room , was burning , blazing like a Christmas pudding , its whole top , coverlet and pillows , turned into a roaring mass of bluish flame , whence arose an acrid stifling smell . “
149001	149013	149014	149014	They	3350	” shrieked Madame Elaguine , throwing herself into Hamlin ’s arms . “
149026	149072	149020	149020	they	3350	” But before he had had time to answer , she had rushed off into a neighbouring room , and , with a presence of mind most unexpected in her , returned with a heap of woollen blankets which she had dragged off a bed . “
149079	149105	149020	149020	they	3350	” she cried to Anne , who , with her strong arms , had immediately dashed the contents of a bath on to the flames . “
149118	149235	149315	149315	his	353	” and taking the soaking blankets , the little woman threw them dexterously on to the blazing bed , among the hissing of the smoke and fire . In a minute every one had brought blankets , cushions , water ; the servants had run up ; and in about five minutes the flames were extinguished . The damages were very trifling compared with the appearance of danger . The fire had not spread beyond the surface of the bed , and consumed only the upper layer of bedding . But the sight of that expanse of waving blue flame had been frightful , and it seemed impossible to realise that no harm had been done . “
149239	149243	149315	149315	his	353	happened?”—“How have they done it?”—“Send
149249	149251	149315	149315	his	353	”—“Scour the park!”—every
149260	149274	149276	149276	Hamlin	447	“ I ’ll go down into the park and have a good hunt , ”
149290	149299	149276	149276	Hamlin	447	“ they ca n’t have got far yet . ”
149300	149310	149312	149312	Lewis	353	“ I do n’t think you ’ll catch them , ”
149320	149330	149332	149333	Mrs Spencer	288	“ We ’re not in Russia , Mr Lewis , ”
149338	149355	149332	149333	Mrs Spencer	288	“ here any one can be caught ; it ’s not an incompetent police as abroad . ”
149356	149364	149366	149366	Lewis	353	“ Some things ca n’t be caught , ”
149744	149761	149729	149729	she	171	“ And they never forgot , as long as they lived , that terrible burning bed . ”
149834	149851	149852	149852	Anne	171	“ And they never forgot , as long as they lived , that terrible burning bed . ”
149908	149914	149915	149915	She	171	“ That terrible burning bed . ”
152949	152963	152965	152968	the practical Marjory Leigh	249	“ If you go on like that you will get seedy , Annie , ”
153023	153029	153031	153032	the doctors	3460	“ Nervous prostration from overwork , ”
153055	153058	153059	153059	he	447	“ Sacha , ”
153080	153102	153103	153103	he	447	“ it is I who am killing Anne ; and it is you — you — who are forcing me to do it,”—and
153130	153137	153139	153140	the Russian	5582	“ It ’s no great harm , ”
153144	153297	153139	153140	the Russian	5582	“ I ’m not quite such a guy as you represented me , Watty , and I ’m the better pleased not to go down to posterity like that . As to Anne , do n’t flatter yourself you are breaking her heart , for the excellent reason that there is none to break . Too much study ! the doctor says , and he knows . A woman like that works only with her brain . Too much Euclid , Kant , Hegel , Fichte , & c. You need n’t flatter yourself that you are of the company . Seriously , can you be such a baby as to imagine that if that woman loved you she would n’t have turned me out of doors ages ago ? Besides , she talked only of Girton College and of her cousin Richard when she was delirious , the nurse tells me . ”
153315	153405	153310	153310	she	360	“ Poor Walter ! what a misfortune it is to be a poet and to be vain ! I am really grieved for you . But sooner or later you would understand that when a woman has no heart , but only ‘ a muscle for pumping the blood to the extremities , ’ as one of her professors calls it , she ca n’t love ; and that , moreover , no woman will ever understand or love you , you silly person , except your cousin Sacha . ”
154151	154159	154160	154160	she	171	“ What has become of Sacha Elaguine ? ”
154192	154209	154160	154160	she	171	“ Has she gone out of town ? You have never spoken about her , Mary . ”
154245	154256	154258	154259	Mary Leigh	324	“ Have n’t I ? Oh yes , I must , ”
154272	154284	154258	154259	Mary Leigh	324	“ Madame Elaguine ? Oh , she ’s just as usual . ”
154285	154290	154292	154292	Marjory	249	“ Odious little brute , ”
154361	154366	154368	154368	Anne	171	“ I am free ! ”
154502	154516	154518	154518	Anne	171	“ Wo n’t you let me smell Mr Hamlin ’s flowers , Mary ? ”
154532	154542	154544	154544	Mary	324	“ They are n’t fit for you , Anne , ”
154551	154568	154544	154544	Mary	324	“ they ’re horrible , morbid sort of things — they’ll just make your head ache . ”
154569	154579	154581	154581	Anne	171	“ My head is much stronger than you think , ”
154583	154652	154581	154581	Anne	171	“ let me have them — they are lovely . The jasmine does n’t smell like ordinary jasmine . What is it?—it smells like the incense that Sacha Elaguine burns in her boudoir ; it ’s nice , but too strong . I wonder whether they have been in her boudoir to catch it . It ’s very kind of Mr Hamlin to bring them to me , especially as”—Anne
154665	154679	154680	154681	Mary Leigh	324	wits—“he does n’t care a bit about me any longer , you know . ”
154702	154712	154713	154713	she	324	“ Oh , Annie , Annie , my darling ! ”
154716	154721	154713	154713	she	324	“ You are good , ”
154723	154757	154694	154694	her	324	Anne—“you are good to love me so . But Mr Hamlin is also very good , although he does n’t love me . I am very happy — so happy , Mary dear . ”
154758	154763	154765	154765	Mary	324	“ She is mad , ”
155230	155237	155238	155238	she	171	“ How is your cousin Sacha ? ”
155241	155246	155247	155247	he	145	“ She is well , ”
155251	155274	155247	155247	he	145	“ and — sends you many messages . I do n’t let her come , because she would excite you . Goodbye . ”
155569	155577	155579	155579	Anne	171	“ He is mean , after all , ”
155581	155601	155579	155579	Anne	171	“ he is angry with poor Sacha for being the cause of his finding himself in a false position . ”
155791	155797	155798	155798	she	171	“ Is Mr Lewis back ? ”
155806	155814	155815	155815	he	145	“ Lewis is not likely to return , ”
156176	156183	156184	156184	he	145	“ You are nearly recovered now ? ”
156187	156202	156184	156184	he	145	“ Do you feel as if you were getting your strength back , Anne ? ”
156203	156207	156208	156208	she	171	“ Oh yes , ”
156211	156255	156208	156208	she	171	“ I feel wonderfully well . I have been for a drive these last few days , and I am sure I could walk , if only they would let me . I only feel very tired and lazy every now and then . ”
156261	156289	156290	156290	he	145	“ Do you remember what you told me that afternoon when we walked home from Richmond ’s lecture — a rainy day at the end of March ? ”
156294	156300	156290	156290	he	145	“ Yes , I do . ”
156301	156343	156363	156363	he	223	“ You said , if you remember , that you did not care for Mr Hamlin , and that you felt yourself bound to him only by gratitude and the sense that he wanted you — do you remember , Nan ? ”
156344	156351	156352	156353	Richard Brown	223	“ I remember perfectly . Well ? ”
156376	156445	156363	156363	he	223	“ Well , I think it is right that you should know what is by this time known by all your acquaintances . Walter Hamlin no longer wants you ; he has entirely thrown you over for another woman . He is — I do n’t know exactly what to call it , and do n’t mean any innuendo — well — the accepted lover of Madame Elaguine . ”
156449	156454	156455	156455	she	3515	“ I know it , ”
156459	156476	156455	156455	she	3515	“ I have known it , or at least guessed it , since a long while . ”
156557	156572	156573	156573	he	223	“ It is no business of mine to pass a judgment over Mr Hamlin , ”
156596	156613	156582	156582	he	223	“ the whole business seems to me quite consonant with all my notions of his character . ”
156614	156627	156630	156630	Anne	171	“ I do not think Mr Hamlin has acted dishonourably towards me , ”
156634	156652	156630	156630	Anne	171	“ on the contrary , I feel sure that he reproaches himself much more than he need . ”
156653	156706	156707	156707	He	3519	“ Very likely . What I was going to say is merely that this new turn which matters have taken necessarily implies an entire change in your position towards Mr Hamlin . He no longer wants you ; you are therefore free . Am I correct in my view of the case ? ”
156721	156729	156731	156731	Anne	171	“ As far as I can judge , ”
156747	156763	156764	156764	She	171	“ I think you are quite correct , Dick . I believe I am free . ”
156784	156805	156764	156764	She	171	“ In that case I presume you will have to remodel your life . Have you thought of any plans ? ”
156806	156887	156888	156888	she	171	“ I have thought over the matter a good deal . My intention , as soon as Mr Hamlin and I have come to an explanation , which will be shortly , is to go to Ireland for a few months with Mary Leigh , to finish getting well and to finish some preparatory work , and then to go up to Girton . I should be able to pass the entrance examination in another three months . You see , ”
156891	157102	156888	156888	she	171	“ Mr Hamlin , in spending the money that he has in turning me into a lady , has made it difficult for me to take to any such livelihood as would have naturally been mine under other circumstances ; and I think , therefore , that I have a right to invest a portion of the money which he has settled upon me , and which he fully intended me to keep in any ease , in qualifying myself for the only sort of business for which I am now fit . He has settled upon me the equivalent of five hundred a‐year , apart from the expenses of this house , of which I know nothing . Much less than that would more than cover the expenses of keeping me at Girton and of starting me as a teacher or journalist ; and once fairly started , I hope I should be able to support myself and gradually to refund this money . Do you think that would be fair , Dick ? You see , it is quite useless for me to think of ever repaying , even if money could repay in such matters , what Mr Hamlin has spent upon me during all these years . ”
157125	157154	157103	157103	She	3520	“ Do you really contemplate renouncing the fortune which Mr Hamlin settled on you ? giving up all the luxury to which he has accustomed you , Annie ? ”
157182	157188	157190	157190	Anne	171	“ Why , of course , ”
157192	157260	157190	157190	Anne	171	“ When Mr Hamlin marries his cousin , he will find , that he has not too much with all his money . And I would certainly not keep any of it as soon as I could do without ; though heaven knows I am not ungrateful , nor so silly as to fancy that I should be in the very least lightening my obligation towards him . ”
157269	157272	157273	157273	he	223	“ Listen , ”
157279	157376	157377	157378	Richard Brown	223	“ I am nearer to you than Walter Hamlin and whatever I am , I owe it to your father . I find I have just made a very considerable and quite unexpected profit off some mining shares which Mr Gillespie left me . Let me advance you out of this money whatever may be wanted to defray your expenses at college ; you will repay me when you find it convenient . In this way , you will be entirely independent of Mr Hamlin at once : you can let him have all his money . ”
157398	157476	157391	157391	he	223	“ You are very kind , Dick ; but I ca n’t accept your offer . I owe it to Mr Hamlin , in return for all the generosity he has shown towards me and would still show , that I should never accept anything from any man but him , even if I were not resolved never to put myself under such an obligation again . I have no right to prefer your generosity to his . ”
157534	157543	157545	157545	Anne	171	“ You are becoming quite tolerant , Dick , ”
157547	157618	157545	157545	Anne	171	“ Six months ago you could never have conceived that any one unlike yourself or differing from your views could have anything good in him . I am very glad ; it will make you more hopeful of the world , and show you a lot of energy and good faith which deserves to be united to your own , and which you would formerly have thrown upon the dust‐heap . ”
157619	157624	157626	157626	Brown	171	“ You are right , ”
157628	157692	157626	157626	Brown	171	“ I feel that I have diminished my own usefulness by not admitting any other kind of usefulness than my own . I often catch myself thinking , now , that my great danger lies in my tendency to underrate people ; sometimes it seems as if , unless I can struggle against it , it will invade and sterilise my whole nature . ”
157693	157705	157545	157545	Anne	171	“ I am so glad you feel like that , Dick . ”
157706	157712	157713	157713	he	3523	“ And do you know , ”
157716	157801	157713	157713	he	3523	“ I think this change is due to you ; knowing you has shown me how horribly unreasonable and unjust I am apt to be in my preconceived notions . I really did think you an æsthete once , Annie ; nay , at one time , I was so base as to think that you were base , that you cared for Hamlin ’s position and money and good looks , while not caring for him . Will you forgive me , Annie ? ”
157849	157864	157865	157865	she	3524	“ I wonder whether you will ever learn to be just to Mr Hamlin , ”
157868	157875	157876	157876	She	3524	“ I will do my best . ”
157884	157897	157899	157899	Anne	171	“ I wonder whether I have ever been just to Mr Hamlin , ”
157904	157913	157899	157899	Anne	171	“ What makes you say that , Nan ? ”
157914	157944	157876	157876	She	3524	“ I do n’t know . I feel how difficult it is for a nature like mine to be just towards , to understand , any one outside it . ”
157945	157953	157954	157954	he	223	“ Can you be just towards me ? ”
157958	157965	157954	157954	he	223	“ I am , I think . ”
157966	157973	157876	157876	She	3524	“ Do you think , then , ”
157979	158006	157876	157876	She	3524	“ that during the time you spend at Girton you could try a little and understand me,—you could try and like me a little , Annie ? ”
158007	158015	158016	158016	she	3526	“ I do like you , Richard , ”
158041	158048	158049	158049	he	223	“ I do n’t mean this , ”
158054	158077	158049	158049	he	223	“ I want you to like me , Nan , as much — as much as you thought you liked Walter Hamlin . ”
158084	158090	158091	158091	she	171	“ That is quite impossible , ”
158094	158120	158091	158091	she	171	“ one does n’t feel like that twice , I fancy , Richard , any more than one believes twice in angels or such things . ”
158145	158148	158149	158149	he	223	“ Good‐bye , ”
158152	158162	158163	158163	he	223	“ I fear I have tired you . Annie , ”
158166	158263	158163	158163	he	223	“ it is idiotic , is n’t it ? but all the time you were ill , even until I came into this room , I kept hoping that you might have lost your looks — that Hamlin might be quite unable ever to care for you again — that you might have ceased to be , in this sort of way , above me . And yet , when I saw you , I was glad it was not so . Oh , Nan , promise me you will try and like me a little . ”
158264	158355	158356	158356	She	3528	“ Please do n’t say that , Dick . I have been a slave , a prisoner . Ca n’t you understand that my great joy is the sense of my freedom , my sense of belonging to no one , caring about no one ? Ca n’t you understand that it seems horrible to me to even think that I could ever care for any one again ? Ca n’t you let me enjoy my liberty , at least until I have realised that it is n’t a dream ? ”
158372	158377	158378	158378	he	1291	“ By the way , ”
158381	158400	158378	158378	he	1291	“ I suppose you have heard who is expected here soon — your old friend , Melton Perry . ”
158401	158405	158407	158407	Anne	171	“ Melton Perry ! ”
158421	158440	158441	158441	She	171	“ Oh , I shall be so glad to see him , he is such a good man ! ”
158956	158960	158961	158961	she	360	“ Poor Annie , ”
158964	159045	158961	158961	she	360	“ you have been very ill , and must have thought me a great brute for not coming to see you before . But Walter absolutely forbade my coming — stood in front of your door , so to speak , and shut it in my face . He pretended that I should have excited you too much . Perhaps I should ; I am a wretched , excitable creature . Perhaps he was right ; what do you think ? ”
159074	159083	159085	159086	Miss Brown	171	“ I think Mr Hamlin was quite mistaken , ”
159096	159123	159085	159086	Miss Brown	171	“ I am much less subject to excitement than he supposes ; and your presence would not have excited me more than any one else ’s . ”
159124	159127	159129	159130	Madame Elaguine	360	“ Really ! ”
159140	159173	159175	159175	she	360	“ I should have thought that I was exciting , now . Not more exciting , for instance , than the Miss Leighs ? or than your cousin , Mr Richard Brown ? ”
159188	159469	159175	159175	she	360	“ By the way , your cousin has quite cut me of late , Annie — ask him why . I suspect that he thinks me a dangerous woman , quite without moral ballast,—what my German teacher used to call Sittlicher Ernst . He was such a funny creature that German teacher of mine ; did I ever tell you about him ? He taught at the school where I was in Petersburg : a thin lank creature , with long red wrists projecting a yard from his sleeves , and a waistcoat which would ride up whenever he was excited ; he used to lean against the wall , any part of his body at random , and bend and sway the rest of him about , like a caterpillar . He taught us German literature , and was very shocked because I said the ‘ Bride of Corinth ’ was the only amusing thing Goethe had ever written . He believed in Schopenhauer — and hated women , and me in particular , because I had no Sittlicher Ernst ; and one day , what do you think he did ? he fell on his knees and tried to catch me round the waist . Poor devil ! he was turned out of doors , and drowned himself later . I wonder whether it was out of despair at my want of Sittlicher Ernst ? He was such a queer creature . I sometimes think , after all , he was the only man I could really have loved , if only his waistcoat had not ridden up , and his wrists projected so much from his cuffs . ”
159682	159693	159694	159694	she	171	“ It ’s a pretty frock , is n’t it ? ”
159704	159857	159858	159858	Anne	171	“ Oh no , I did n’t make this ; I am bored with always making my own frocks . It ’s from Worth . I swore I would bring round Watty from belief in pre‐Adamitic skirts and purfled sleeves and eighteen‐penny medievalism to a belief in Worth ; you know he used always to rant at Paris clothes . Well , I ’ve been as good as my word ; this is from Worth , and what ’s more , Walter has paid my bill . Humiliating , rather , is n’t it ? but then , you see , I ’m a pauper , and ca n’t buy Worth frocks on a thousand a‐year , including subscription for a copy of Chough ’s new translation of ‘ Villon , ’ with all the improprieties annotated , Dutch paper , morocco , rough edges , price three guineas , can I ? ”
160000	160007	160010	160011	Madame Elaguine	360	“ Walter is a queer creature , ”
160013	160177	160010	160011	Madame Elaguine	360	“ somewhat like my German caterpillar professor : I do n’t mean in the matter of wrists and waistcoats , but in the matter of women . I do n’t know how to say it ; my ideas are n’t ever very clear : I suppose it ’s want of Sittlicher Ernst , and also because I ’m hysterical — at least the doctors say so ; because I insist on having my own way . I mean that Walter , for instance , hates me in a certain sense just as that professor did . I ’m sure he sometimes feels as if he could throttle me , because I have no Sittlicher Ernst , and because I made love to him , and offered him barley‐sugar and tops when I was ten . And yet ! Ah , well , I suppose I am a wretch ! Oh , Annie dear , I fear , I fear I am a wretch ! ”
160219	160236	160237	160237	she	360	“ Oh Annie , I am an unworthy wretch ! I am a beast towards you ! ”
160299	160302	160303	160303	she	171	“ Madame Elaguine ”
160323	160354	160303	160303	she	171	“ I have long wanted to tell you something with regard to Mr Hamlin — indeed I feel I ought to have told it you before , but . . . ”
160567	160590	160592	160593	Madame Elaguine	360	“ This is my first visit to you since your illness , and it will be my last for a little time , ”
160630	160636	160638	160638	Anne	171	“ Are you going away ? ”
160658	160664	160665	160665	she	171	“ Only for a fortnight , ”
160673	160796	160665	160665	she	171	“ Oh no ; I ca n’t do without London and my friends — hideous London and disagreeable friends , at least so far as Walter is concerned . I suppose it ’s my perversity and want of Sittlicher Ernst , again . I am going to Paris this evening . I have a notion of taking Boris out of his English school and sending him to the Lycée . I feel I have had a surfeit of respectability and æstheticism , and that I ’d rather my son were a Frenchman and a Bohemian . It ’s a whim . Perhaps it will make me return a frantic Anglomaniac . Fancy if Boris were to grow up a thing like this ! ”
160799	160854	160665	160665	she	171	Hamlin,—“a horrible pseudo Sir Galahad , as Watty was at sixteen . Faugh ! I could n’t bear it . Good‐bye , Annie dear ; I fear you must think me an immoral woman , and that my German professor was n’t so far wrong . Good‐bye , my beautiful Madonna of the Glaciers , ”
160879	160885	160887	160887	Sacha	386	“ Come along , Watty ! ”
160889	160902	160887	160887	Sacha	386	“ ca n’t you learn to open the door for a woman ? ”
160903	160909	160911	160911	Hamlin	145	“ Good‐bye , Miss Brown , ”
161049	161081	161041	161041	he	145	“ If you will allow me , I will come to‐morrow afternoon and see what can be done to my Vision of Beatrice , if you will give me a sitting . ”
161126	161131	161118	161118	Hamlin	145	“ DEAR MISS BROWN , ”
161133	161191	161118	161118	Hamlin	145	said,—“I fear you will think me very uncourteous to break through our engagement for to‐morrow morning . But I am feeling rather anxious lest Madame Elaguine should get imposed on about the school for her boy ; so I shall join her for a few days in Paris . Pray forgive my apparent rudeness.—Yours sincerely , W. H. ”
161192	161200	161202	161203	Mary Leigh	324	“ What ’s your news , Annie ? ”
161215	161228	161229	161229	Anne	171	“ You look as if you had come in for a fortune ! ”
161236	161277	161229	161229	Anne	171	“ It was only Mr Hamlin postponing a sitting which I was to give him . I really do n’t feel much like sitting yet . Mr Hamlin ’s gone to Paris to look after a school for Boris Elaguine . ”
161278	161283	161304	161304	she	324	“ And Madame Elaguine ? ”
161284	161291	161229	161229	Anne	171	“ Madame Elaguine — went yesterday . ”
161292	161297	161299	161300	Mary Leigh	324	“ Oh , indeed ! ”
161887	161893	161895	161895	Anne	171	“ Oh , Aunt Claudia , ”
161897	161926	161895	161895	Anne	171	“ Mr Perry is coming to‐morrow evening ! Do you think — oh , do you think you could have him to stay here till Mr Hamlin return ? ”
161927	161933	161935	161935	Chough	379	“ Who is Mr Perry ? ”
161974	161978	161980	161980	Anne	171	“ Mr Perry , ”
161982	162025	161980	161980	Anne	171	“ is the gentleman in whose house I was a servant until I met Mr Hamlin — the father of the little girls whose maid I was . He was very kind to me , and I am very fond of him . ”
162175	162199	162202	162203	Miss Brown	171	“ Mr Perry , except Miss Curzon , was the only friend I ever had , until — until I met Mr Hamlin , ”
162205	162259	162202	162203	Miss Brown	171	“ You will give him the spare room , Aunt Claudia , for my sake , wo n’t you ? And you will let me arrange it for him , and make it look a little untidy , and put match‐boxes and pipe‐lights about , so that he may feel a little comfortable . ”
162264	162294	162260	162261	Mrs Macgregor	243	“ Put as many pipe‐lights about as you please , my dear ; but if he fill Watty ’s studio with pipe‐smoke , you will be responsible , not I. ”
162501	162514	162515	162515	he	3590	“ I hear that Walter Hamlin is in Paris with his cousin , ”
162549	162564	162565	162565	Lewis	353	“ Yes ; they have gone to settle about sending Boris to the Lycée . ”
162623	162660	162661	162661	he	353	“ I do n’t think Madame Elaguine ’s Russian relations — her aunt who lives in Paris and Boris ’s grandfather — will be particularly pleased at her going about like that with a young man , ”
162664	162677	162661	162661	he	353	“ Russians are such corrupt people , they see mischief in everything . ”
162741	162754	162756	162756	Anne	171	“ Madame Elaguine is Mr Hamlin ’s cousin , you must remember , ”
162764	162868	162870	162870	Lewis	353	“ True ; but the people who meet them in Paris wo n’t know that , or wo n’t believe it . Besides , it ’s not as if they had always lived together and been as brother and sister , as some cousins have . I think Madame Elaguine is very rash to run the risk of unnecessary gossip ; and I must say I ca n’t understand Hamlin being so dense as not to see that he was compromising his cousin , especially as people were beginning to notice his assiduity to his cousin even here . Of course , however , ”
162879	162959	162870	162870	Lewis	353	“ being engaged , to you makes a difference to Hamlin . A man who is engaged to be married may , I suppose , go about with any woman — it is as if he were married . I am very sorry I shall be far away , somewhere in Central Asia or South America — I do n’t know where — when your marriage will come off , Miss Brown . I must make my congratulations betimes . ”
162960	162968	162970	162970	Anne	171	“ There is nothing to congratulate about , ”
162974	163048	162970	162970	Anne	171	“ there has been no question of my marrying Mr Hamlin . I am sorry such an idea should have got abroad . I was , you know , Mr Hamlin ’s ward till lately , and I am now taking advantage of his aunt ’s kindness to stay here till — till I settle what I am going to do ; I may be going to Girton — I do n’t know . ”
163049	163054	163056	163056	Lewis	353	“ Oh , indeed ! ”
163058	163078	163056	163056	Lewis	353	“ pray forgive my unintentional impertinence then . Girton ? Ah — How long do you intend remaining there ? ”
163079	163090	163091	163091	Anne	171	“ I do n’t know . Nothing is settled yet . ”
163111	163127	163056	163056	Lewis	353	“ I may stay there altogether . I should rather like to be a teacher . ”
163128	163132	163134	163134	Lewis	353	“ And I , ”
163144	163160	163134	163134	Lewis	353	“ would , in that case , like to be a pupil , Miss Brown . ”
163186	163202	163203	163203	he	353	“ I ca n’t get over Hamlin ’s thoughtlessness in accompanying Madame Elaguine to Paris , ”
163206	163243	163203	163203	he	353	“ It would have been so simple to ask some lady to be of the party . I suppose you did not like leaving Mrs Macgregor ? I was sorry to hear that she was ailing . ”
163244	163253	163255	163255	Anne	171	“ There was no question of my going , ”
163257	163304	163305	163305	She	171	“ and I do think it is such silly nonsense about any one being required . If people choose to think that Mr Hamlin is going to marry his cousin — well , why not ? It would be a very natural thing if he did . ”
163357	163370	163371	163371	he	353	“ I suppose you see a good deal of Mr Richard Brown ? ”
163374	163382	163371	163371	he	353	“ he ’s an extraordinarily clever man . ”
163383	163409	163371	163371	he	353	“ Yes ; he is very able . I see him often enough . At present his electioneering business does n’t leave him much time . ”
163410	163446	163371	163371	he	353	“ Ah , to be sure . It costs a lot of money , does n’t it , to get into Parliament ? But I suppose Mr Brown is rich now , is he not ? ”
163447	163453	163371	163371	he	353	“ He is well off . ”
163454	163470	163472	163472	Lewis	353	“ And he is sure to succeed . He has a fine career before him , ”
163734	163785	163787	163787	Lewis	353	“ I do n’t know whether you remarked at the time , that the flames burst out just two minutes after Madame Elaguine had fetched the cigarette‐papers out of her room , and that she had given orders to her maid not to come until she should be rung for , ”
163789	163809	163787	163787	Lewis	353	“ also , that Madame Elaguine seemed extremely unwilling that any inquiry should be made into the matter afterwards . ”
163837	163854	163862	163863	Hélène Elaguine	414	“ And they never forgot , so long as they lived , that terrible burning bed , ”
163901	163910	163893	163893	she	171	“ I have had my doubts about it , ”
163922	163925	163926	163926	she	171	“ Indeed , ”
163938	163962	163926	163926	she	171	“ I am inclined to believe that Madame Elaguine did set that bed on fire . Several things have made me think so . ”
163966	164043	163926	163926	she	171	“ I am glad to find that you take my view of the case , Miss Brown . The chemist at Appledore — where , if you remember , Madame Elaguine went for some shopping the day before the fire — showed me himself the bottle of acid from which he had helped Madame Elaguine — I forget the name of the stuff — she said she wanted some to take spots out of a dress . ”
164044	164047	164050	164050	Lewis	353	“ Indeed , ”
164052	164078	164050	164050	Lewis	353	“ I think that we have in Madame Elaguine a very curious instance of a sort of monomania which has , I believe , its scientific name,”—and
164162	164187	164190	164190	Lewis	353	“ One is apt to meet very singular types among Russian women , especially such as have led a wandering life like Madame Elaguine , ”
164192	164286	164190	164190	Lewis	353	“ They are devoured by a passion for the forbidden , or at least for the unreal and theatrical ; there is something strangely crooked in their moral vision , something discordant in their nature . They are extraordinary , charming , intelligent , depraved creatures . Only a Russian woman could be at once so childish and so theatrical and insincere , so full of idealism and of cynicism , as Madame Elaguine . Ah , she is a wonderful being ! That matter of the burning bed finishes her off perfectly . ”
164471	164483	164484	164484	she	171	“ I think you take a dreadful view of the matter , ”
164487	164624	164484	164484	she	171	“ you explain Madame Elaguine , who is only half a Russian , by all the horrible Russians you have ever met or imagined . I think there is a much simpler explanation . Madame Elaguine has been very strangely brought up ; she has lived with very bad people ; her husband was a horrible wretch , we all know . She is excessively hysterical — her mother , Mr Hamlin ’s aunt , was so also — and we all know that the desire to be prominent , to deceive , is a common form of hysteria . And as she has never been brought up to restrain herself , she imagines herself to be persecuted , and makes up the persecution . She is much more to be pitied than to be blamed . ”
164742	164752	164753	164753	he	353	“ I do n’t believe in praise and blame , ”
164756	164905	164753	164753	he	353	“ I believe merely in fate . Some people are born noble , truthful , chaste — others just the reverse . It is the fault of neither ; and each , in its way , is equally interesting and valuable to the artist or the psychologist . The curious thing about Madame Elaguine is , that she apparently stands half‐way ; she is , according to the ideas of the world , half responsible and half irresponsible . We see in her a hysterical woman , troubled by a morbid love of deceit ; and at the same time a woman to whom such deceit is or has been practically necessary . Madame Elaguine continues for her amusement , and develops to the utmost , an imaginary persecution , whose origin must be sought in some intrigue which it was her interest to veil by a mystification , ”
165000	165004	165005	165005	she	171	“ Mr Lewis , ”
165008	165074	165005	165005	she	171	“ I do n’t think those things should be listened to by me or said by you . I believe that Madame Elaguine is not sound in her mind , and that her persecution is a hoax ; but I believe that she is an honest woman in other respects . She is a friend of mine , and I will not hear her slandered . ”
165075	165125	165126	165126	Lewis	353	“ Heaven forbid that I should wish to slander her ! I think she is a fascinating woman ; and she is — at least she was — quite as great a friend of mine as of yours . I was only telling you how I explain her character . ”
165145	165150	165151	165151	he	353	“ I hate scandal , ”
165158	165213	165151	165151	he	353	“ and I am most grieved to have appeared to be talking scandal . People always misunderstand the sort of passionate interest I take in every kind of curious character . I suppose you would call it morbid , Miss Brown ; but I really was considering Madame Elaguine merely as an interesting study . ”
165244	165251	165252	165252	she	3613	“ That is all very fine , ”
165256	165280	165252	165252	she	3613	“ but do you , or do you not , believe Madame Elaguine to be a dishonourable woman , apart from this monomania ? ”
165281	165343	165344	165345	Miss Brown	171	“ It is very hard to say . You know I disbelieve in what you call moral responsibilities . I imagine Madame Elaguine to have found her mania for persecution very convenient at one period of her life — yes , certainly . I think it is the only rational way to account for the beginning of it — don’t you ? ”
165357	165366	165367	165367	she	3613	“ If you think that , Mr Lewis , ”
165370	165427	165367	165367	she	3613	“ may I ask how you reconciled with your notions of gentlemanly behaviour the calm way in which you let Mr Hamlin introduce such a woman as you describe to me , and let me continue to know her ? No ; you are perfectly aware that all this is merely trumped up at the moment . ”
165450	165552	165553	165553	Anne	171	“ Walter Hamlin ’s eyes are quite as good as mine . As regards my behaviour towards you , I can not go into details , but you may understand , dear Miss Brown , that two or three months ago I may not , as a man of honour , have been at liberty to discuss Madame Elaguine ’s character in the way that I have done now that Madame Elaguine ’s relations with me have entirely changed their nature . Good‐bye , dear Miss Brown . I am most truly grieved if I have offended you in any way . ”
165664	165668	165670	165670	Anne	171	“ Mr Perry ! ”
165690	165703	165670	165670	Anne	171	“ Mr Perry ! oh I am so glad to see you ! ”
165763	165779	165781	165782	Melton Perry	152	“ Did n’t expect me yet , eh , Annie — I mean Miss Brown ? ”
165793	165872	165785	165785	she	171	“ I suppose you expected me by the Dover train . But I came by Dieppe , six hours ’ agony , but a saving of twelve‐and‐sixpence . I was always an economical creature , was n’t I ? Why , what ’s that you have round your neck ? That beastly little pewter and horn rosary that I got you at the Fair of the Impruneta , by George ! Fancy your having kept such a thing ! ”
165873	165884	165886	165886	Anne	171	“ It ’s one of the best things I have , ”
165902	165910	165785	165785	she	171	past—“it ’s the present of a friend . ”
165911	165926	165928	165928	Perry	152	“ And all this , is n’t this also the present of a friend ? ”
165973	165988	165969	165969	she	171	“ but I forgot , Walter Hamlin is n’t a particular friend of yours . ”
166012	166023	166025	166025	Perry	152	“ Lord , what a damned gorgeous place this is ! ”
166076	166139	166154	166154	Anne	171	“ what a beautiful woman you are , Annie ! Do you know , I usen’t to believe it , when Watty raved about you at the Villa Arnolfini . What a crusty old jackass I must have been ! But tell , why in the wide world are n’t you married yet ? What have you been doing all this time ? ”
166140	166152	166154	166154	Anne	171	“ Mr Hamlin has not asked me to marry him yet , ”
166176	166185	166186	166186	he	152	“ Not asked you to marry him yet ! ”
166189	166205	166186	166186	he	152	“ do you mean to say you are n’t engaged to him . . . ? ”
166211	166261	166208	166208	her	171	“ That he ’s been going loafing , and spooning , and doing Vita Nuova all this time ? I thought that he must have lost two dozen grandfathers and grandmothers in rapid succession , so that one mourning postponed your marriage after the other , or something similar . ”
166269	166275	166276	166276	he	152	“ Hamlin ’s not ill ? ”
166279	166291	166276	166276	he	152	“ Consumption , madness , doctors ’ consultations,—anything of that sort ? ”
166299	166337	166292	166293	Miss Brown	171	“ Oh no , Mr Hamlin has been quite well . He is in Paris at present ; he did n’t expect you quite so soon , but he will be back in a day or two . ”
166350	166405	166338	166339	Melton Perry	152	“ Miss Brown — no , I ca n’t call you Miss Brown — Annie , tell me the truth . Has Hamlin not kept his word — has he played you any dirty trick ? No , no , I do n’t mean anything,—but , has Hamlin played fast and loose with you ? ”
166406	166419	166421	166421	Anne	171	“ Mr Hamlin never intended asking me to marry him at once , ”
166455	166515	166448	166448	she	171	“ Do n’t you remember , Mr Perry ? We were to wait , to see whether we really . . . I will tell you all about it later — to‐morrow . It is a long story ; I want to hear about you now , about Italy — about your work , the children , Mrs Perry . ”
166516	166520	166521	166521	she	171	“ Mr Hamlin , ”
166546	166565	166521	166521	she	171	“ has been most generous and noble towards me ; indeed much more than I can ever say . ”
166566	166577	166581	166581	himself	146	“ I ’m damned if I understand any of it , ”
166666	166669	166670	166670	he	145	“ Annie , ”
166673	166692	166670	166670	he	145	“ if it ’s not rude to ask , for I ’ve forgotten — how old are you ? ”
166693	166710	166718	166718	he	145	“ I was twenty‐four last month . Why do you ask ? Do you think I look more?”—she
166759	166762	166764	166764	Perry	146	“ Twenty‐four , ”
166768	166829	166764	166764	Perry	146	“ Well now , do n’t be offended — of course you could n’t be more , for you were n’t of age when you left us ; but somehow — it is n’t that you do n’t look young , you know , but all the same I should have thought . . . I ’m a rude brute . ”
166830	166837	166839	166840	Miss Brown	171	“ That I was much older , ”
166842	166851	166839	166840	Miss Brown	171	“ Well , I often think so myself . ”
166852	166939	166940	166940	he	3631	“ It ’s something , I do n’t know what . You are far handsomer than in Italy , and you never did look much like a girl — you know what I mean ; but now , upon my word , I do n’t know how to say it , I never saw an unmarried woman look like you . You look as if you had seen and understood such a heap of things . I feel quite a fool before you . Forgive me , ”
166943	166988	166940	166940	he	3631	“ I ’m always a blundering tomfool . I had somehow thought of you as something like my own girls . Winnie ’s sixteen , you know , and such a strapping girl . But I feel as if you might be my grandmother . ”
166992	167044	166989	166989	Anne	171	“ I have always felt as if I were your grandmother . I was born old . Good‐bye , Mr Perry . Remember that dinner is at seven ; and put on a dress‐coat if you want to win the heart of my aunt — I mean Mr Hamlin ’s aunt . ”
167056	167076	167077	167077	he	152	“ I ’m damned if I understand anything of it all , and Annie least of any of them , ”
167080	167084	167086	167087	Melton Perry	152	“ AFTER all , ”
167171	167242	167159	167165	the man who came from the country	3637	linen,—“after all , it was a very bright idea of old Watty ’s to fall in love with our nursemaid and turn her into a wonderful æsthetic being in a wonderful æsthetic house : it was very sensible of Mrs Perry to encourage him in the idea ; and it was just like a confounded , fumbling , purblind old pig and ass like me to try and prevent it . ”
167319	167334	167336	167336	Anne	171	“ Please smoke ; you used always to smoke after lunch with Mrs Perry , ”
167338	167355	167336	167336	Anne	171	“ But — this is n’t Florence ; and you — you are n’t Mrs Perry . ”
167569	167584	167585	167585	she	171	“ I must tell you all my history since last we saw each other , ”
167588	167603	167585	167585	she	171	“ you will want to hear it , wo n’t you , Mr Perry ? ”
167647	167812	167585	167585	she	171	“ Oh dear , yes — of course — I’m dying to hear it . I ca n’t at all realise that it is really you , Annie , or really anybody and anything . Do you remember when we went into Lucca that day for the feast of the Holy Face , and I left you with Winnie and Mildred to go to the opera with Hamlin ? D’you remember the plaster bust of Castruccio at the top of the hotel stairs , with the old woman ’s night‐cap on ? I do n’t know why that bust haunted me so . What tiny trots Winnie and Mildred were , with sashes down at their knees ! and such confounded young flirts , five feet seven , as they are now ! I see you have Winnie ’s photograph . How comic those brats must have looked ! . . . But wo n’t you tell me all your marvellous and incredible circumstances ? ”
167813	167835	167837	167837	Anne	171	“ I scarcely know where to begin ; perhaps I had better begin at the end . You wanted to know , ”
167849	167866	167837	167837	Anne	171	“ why Mr Hamlin and I were n’t married yet , nor even engaged . . . ”
167867	167961	167963	167964	Melton Perry	152	“ Oh yes ; what the deuce is the meaning of it , Annie ? You are certainly the queerest people , you æsthetic folk . By Jove ! you actually have a photograph of yourself with the children . I had clean forgotten its existence ; and now I remember as if it were yesterday taking you to Alinari ’s , and how beastly naughty Winnie was ! Oh , what a sulky blackamoor you do look , Annie ! Good gracious ! you do n’t mean to say you know her ? ”
167979	167995	167963	167964	Melton Perry	152	“ Where in the world did you pick up a photograph of Mrs Constantine Bulzo ? ”
167996	168001	168003	168003	Anne	171	“ Mrs Constantine Bulzo ? ”
168008	168044	168003	168003	Anne	171	“ Whom do you mean ? I never heard of such a person . That photograph?—why , that ’s a half‐Russian cousin of Mr Hamlin 's , Sacha Elaguine , who was a Miss Polozoff . ”
168045	168050	168052	168053	Melton Perry,—“well	478	“ Hamlin ’s cousin ! ”
168053	168099	168003	168003	Anne	171	Perry,—“well , upon my word . . . yes , of course , I had forgotten — of course , her name is n’t Mrs Constantine Bulzo any longer . But may I ask , how under heaven do you come to know Madame Elaguine ? ”
168100	168134	168003	168003	Anne	171	“ I do n’t understand a word . This lady is Madame Elaguine ; she is Mr Hamlin ’s first cousin , and that ’s of course how I come to know her . ”
168135	168201	168202	168203	Miss Brown	171	“ Hamlin ’s cousin or not Hamlin ’s cousin , how in the wide world could a woman like you ever know , ever meet such a — such a — excuse the word , but it ’s the least bad I can find — such an abominable baggage as this woman , Elaguine , or Bulzo , or Polozoff — as this abominable Sacha ? ”
168221	168234	168236	168236	Perry	152	“ Good Lord , what ’s the matter with you , Annie ? ”
168241	168271	168236	168236	Perry	152	“ you surely did n’t imagine that — you surely ca n’t be a great friend of such a creature as that . What ’s the matter?—are you ill ? ”
168272	168283	168285	168285	Anne	171	“ It ’s nothing — the heat , I suppose , ”
168294	168397	168285	168285	Anne	171	“ and then , also , I suppose I ’m not very strong yet ; I ’ve had brain fever , and you took me by surprise . But I ought n’t to have been surprised , because I know Sacha Elaguine has a great many enemies , and that her circumstances , her history , and in some measure , unfortunately , her ways and character , rather lend themselves to all manner of horrible stories . She ’s a frightfully tried and slandered little woman , poor thing . But I don’t — I do n’t believe any of it . ”
168425	168439	168441	168441	Perry	152	“ Are you really fond of Madame Bulzo — I mean Madame Elaguine ? ”
168462	168469	168441	168441	Perry	152	“ Are you intimate with her ? ”
168470	168495	168497	168497	Anne	171	“ I am intimate in the sense of having been with her a good deal , and knowing more than other people about her , ”
168499	168563	168497	168497	Anne	171	“ but I ca n’t say I am a great friend of hers . She is Mr Hamlin ’s cousin ; she has settled in England recently ; he — we , I mean — see a good deal of her . I am awfully sorry for her , poor little woman ; but there is n’t very much in common between us . ”
168564	168568	168570	168570	Perry	152	“ Thank goodness ! ”
168572	168612	168570	168570	Perry	152	“ Do you know , the sight of that photograph made me feel quite sick — the thought that you , Annie , should be the friend of such a creature . But I knew you could n’t be . ”
168613	168654	168441	168441	Perry	152	“ But I am Madame Elaguine ’s friend ; I do n’t believe a word of the infamous stories that are told about her ; and you would n’t believe them either , if you knew all that I do . ”

168669	168791	168663	168663	Perry	152	“ about the iniquities of Monsieur Elaguine , about the terrible persecution , the bits of letters , the pistol‐shots , the poisoned chocolate , the lit spirits of wine poured under the door,—all that crazy imposture , I suppose ? Well , I hope that Hamlin knows no more than you ; otherwise , by God ! he ’s no better than a blackguard to let you associate with this woman , be she his cousin a hundred times over ; and you must never see that woman again , Annie . I forbid you to — I , as the oldest friend you have in the world — I forbid you to defile yourself by knowing that infamous creature . ”
168825	168832	168833	168833	he	152	“ Listen to me , Anne , ”
168836	169555	168833	168833	he	152	“ and judge whether I am unfair . God knows I ’m not a Puritan , neither towards myself nor towards others . I ’ve been a very rowdy man ; I ’ve knowu a great many rowdy women — what you call regular bad women — Russians , who are the worst of all — by the dozen . I ’m not a red‐tapist ; I can quite understand women misbehaving,—having lovers — that sort of thing,—or even , if they are very wretched , selling themselves . It ’s beastly immoral to say so before a woman , but still , there it is , it ’s the truth . Well , such as you see me , I would n’t touch that woman with the longest pair of tongs in all the devil ’s kitchen . That woman is really wicked — not merely immoral , but abominable , atrocious ; she is the sort of woman who absolutely degrades a man , takes a pleasure in turning him into a beast and a madman — whose greatest pleasure would be to degrade and make a beast of an honest woman . Just listen to me . Some five years ago I knew a Greek couple — a young man and his sister , called Constantine and Marie Bulzo . They were orphans , very young , very handsome , especially the boy , who was only eighteen or nineteen . They were a sort of half‐English Greeks , and went in for being æsthetical and artistic , all that sort of thing . I knew them in Florence , where Miss Bulzo , who was four or five years older than her brother , was studying painting . I gave them both lessons . I never met two such beautiful creatures , body and soul , as those young Bulzos . They were like young saints , and yet perfectly childish and merry , and they were quite devoted to each other : Marie really lived only for the boy . Well , six months later I met the two at Venice . They were staying at the same hotel as your Madame Elaguine , who immediately proceeded to make herself awfully fascinating and pathetic to them . Of course the poor children swallowed all about the persecutions by the Nihilists as so much Gospel . They introduced me , and Madame Elaguine rather amused me ; but I saw very soon that she was n’t a woman for them to know . There was a man staying in the same hotel , an old friend of hers , and , in fact , her lover , who was one of the vilest scoundrels the world ever bred — a horrible loathsome old Russian . I used to wonder how Madame Elaguine could endure him , but then I found out that he paid her bills for her . I tried to warn the Bulzos , especially Constantine , as , being a man , he might be expected to understand such things rather better . But , figurati ! ( and Perry made an expressive gesture of Italian exaggeration , ) they would n’t hear a word against their beloved , deeply injured , martyrised Madame Elaguine . Well , we half quarrelled ; I scarcely saw anything of them . At the end of four months what do I hear , but that Miss Bulzo was married to Madame Elaguine ’s loathsome Russian ; and then , a week later , I see Constantine and Madame Elaguine go off in the train together . Do you understand ? Madame Elaguine , who was in love with young Bulzo , wanted to go off with him , and not knowing what to do with Marie , and wishing to dismiss and settle accounts with her quondam lover , had , in some fiendish way , induced this innocent girl of twenty‐four to marry this frightful old Russian sinner — had sold her to the loathsome beast as a settlement to their debts ; and Marie , after a few months , simply pined away and died of shame and disgust at the slavery she had been sold into . Do you understand that ? ”
169556	169578	170107	170108	Miss Brown	171	“ I understand ; but I do n’t see why I should believe — it ’s too horrible to be true . ”
169579	169857	168833	168833	he	152	“ It is true , though , for Constantine Bulzo told it me all himself later ; how the Elaguine had talked him over to consent , and had regularly bullied his sister into the marriage , by pretending that it was the only way of paying a lot of imaginary debts of her brother ’s , and had forced Constantine , who was raving in love with her , to hold his tongue . That was the end of Marie Bulzo . Now as to Constantine . His sister once safely married to her old beast , he went off with the Elaguine , or rather , the Elaguine went off with him . Next summer I met them at Perugia ; they were travelling about in remote places as Mr and Mrs Bulzo ; and English people were so kind as to believe that this Russian woman of thirty and this Greek boy of twenty were married . Constantine perfectly adored her ; but I never saw a man more changed : he looked thirty , a miserable , hang‐dog , effeminate sort of creature , quite unable to do anything except drag after his so‐called wife . That woman had regularly ruined the poor boy , broken his spirit , turned him into a kind of male odalisque of hers . Two years later the Bulzos were at Venice again ; and I came just in time for the catastrophe . One fine morning Mrs Constantine Bulzo , become Madame Elaguine once more , packed her trunks and went off with a French painter , leaving her supposed husband to pay the hotel bill . ”
169858	170082	170083	170083	Perry	152	“ I saw Constantine shortly after ; the woman had spent nearly all his money , and he was living , or starving , in a room in a beastly court , slinking out only early in the morning and late at night , spending the day lying in his bed , eating opium and drinking . I never saw such a wreck in my life . As he was starving , I got him a place as clerk at a picture‐shop , and tried to get him to work ; but he did n’t seem to care about living , and went on drinking and stupefying himself , till one day he drowned himself in the lagoon — they say accidentally , but I shall never believe it . That is the story of your Madame Elaguine ; and I swear to you I have not exaggerated one word of it . Do you still think she is a woman fit to be known by you ? By heaven ! when I think what that miserable boy was when I saw him last , and what he had been when first I knew him , I feel as if it would be the greatest possible pleasure to throttle your Madame Elaguine with my own hands ! Upon my soul , I do ! ”

170112	170165	170107	170108	Miss Brown	171	“ even admitting your story to be true , which I suppose , as it comes from you , that I must , was it all the woman ’s fault ? You men always throw the blame on the woman . But your Constantine Bulzo must have been a wretched weak creature . ”
170170	170188	170189	170189	he	152	“ No one has a right to expect every man or every woman to be very strong , ”
170194	170238	170189	170189	he	152	“ This poor boy was kind and trusting , and , when left to his own devices , honest . He was not weaker than most men , especially than most artistic natures — not weaker , for instance , than Walter Hamlin . ”
170268	170293	170248	170248	she	171	“ Did you tell me something — a dreadful story — about Madame Elaguine and a young Greek friend of yours , yesterday afternoon ? ”
170325	170333	170312	170312	her	171	“ Of course I did . Why ? ”
170334	170367	170305	170305	her	171	“ Oh , nothing . I had only a very bad night — all manner of horrible dreams , and I was not sure whether this might not be one of them . ”
170368	170375	170377	170378	Melton Perry	152	“ DO you know , Annie , ”
170386	170430	170377	170378	Melton Perry	152	“ I find Watty very much altered . He seems so fearfully depressed and broken‐spirited . He used always to be bored , but not like this ; he has got to look so old , with those great rings under his eyes . ”
170724	170746	170748	170748	Perry	152	“ It ’s awfully good of old Hamlin to wish me to know all these grand swell painters and newspaper writers , ”
170760	170826	170748	170748	Perry	152	“ and I suppose it is very useful to me . But still , I wish I could get him to understand that what I want at present is to see just him and you ; that all these confounded influential people will keep ; and that I ’d rather have a good talk over a pipe with him alone , as in old days . ”
171300	171310	171312	171312	Hamlin	145	“ Why are you going so soon , Brown ? ”
171322	171395	171320	171320	himself	145	“ you never give me a chance of seeing you . Wo n’t you stay to dinner ? It is very impertinent of me to invite people in a house that is n’t mine ; but I feel sure Miss Brown is disappointed in not having had any talk with you . Chough is coming to see Perry this evening , so you and your cousin might have a chat after dinner . ”
171444	171448	171450	171450	Richard	223	“ Thank you , ”
171452	171467	171468	171468	he	223	“ I am dining with some of my would‐be constituents to‐night . You know , ”
171473	171494	171468	171468	he	223	“ I am going into Parliament , I believe . I will return soon ; many thanks , Mr Hamlin . ”
171495	171508	171509	171509	he	223	“ I have a good many things to tell you , Nan , ”
171521	171567	171568	171568	He	223	“ I have heard of a scholarship which I am sure you could take if you would cram for six months ; and I want to ask you a lot of things also . I will come back in two or three days . Good‐bye . ”
171588	171594	171595	171595	she	171	“ Good‐bye , Cousin Dick , ”
171723	171727	171728	171728	he	152	“ Beautiful roses , ”
171736	171773	171728	171728	he	152	“ we have none like them in Italy . Why do n’t Italians cultivate flowers ? What do you call this ? Is it a La France ? I never knew a turnip from a jasmine . ”
171774	171788	171790	171790	Anne	171	“ I think it is a La France ; I do n’t know , ”
171800	171830	171790	171790	Anne	171	“ I think I must leave you now . You will find a box of cigarettes on the sideboard . Forgive me , I feel so tired and stupid . ”
171831	171835	171837	171837	Perry	152	“ One moment ! ”
171839	171885	171886	171886	Anne	171	“ It ’s a very disagreeable thing I have to say , Annie ; but I think I ought to say it . I guessed it the second time I saw him already ; but now I am quite sure of it — Hamlin drinks . ”
171891	172100	172103	172103	Perry	152	“ I do n’t mean to say that he gets drunk . But he drinks — spirits ; I ’ve seen him to‐night after dinner , and I ’m sure he ’s going to take more at home . There ’s no mistaking the look . It is n’t that he takes much , not more than I or most men might take ; but it is that he ought n’t to take any . He used , you know , never even to take wine , except with gallons of water . He ca n’t take anything of the sort . I remember already when we were at college together , Watty was a teetotaller . It appears some people are like that ; I ’ve heard doctors say that it ’s not unusual in families where there has been much drinking : it ’s a sort of diseased sensitiveness to alcohol — it becomes a kind of poison . You know that Hamlin ’s father drank , and one of his uncles died of drink , and his brother is either dead or dying , somewhere in a maison de santé , of a sort of mixed delirium tremens and craziness . It ’s a thing , ”
172120	172204	172103	172103	Perry	152	“ which grieves and alarms me horribly ; and in which I feel that you are probably the only person who could have any influence with him . It ’s useless my speaking . He must have got in among a bad lot . That little Chough seems harmless enough;but I hear that he was very close with a nasty fellow called Lewis — a spiritualist , opium‐eater , haschisch‐eater , and heaven knows what . Does he see much of him now ? ”
172205	172216	172103	172103	Perry	152	“ He has quarrelled with Edmund Lewis , I fancy . ”
172217	172336	172103	172103	Perry	152	“ Ah — so much the better . Then this would evidently be the moment to act . Of course I know it will be awfully difficult and horrible for you ; because he ’ll feel so miserably ashamed before you , and , of course , you will feel it almost as badly as he . But still , you are the only person that can influence him . You see he loves you , worships you , all that sort of thing . And I am sure you will have the courage to get over your repugnance to a disagreeable half‐hour , wo n’t you , Annie , for your own sake as well as his ? ”

178389	178403	178372	178372	she	171	“ You have nothing very pressing to do just now , I hope ? ”
178404	178407	178409	178409	Hamlin	145	“ Nothing , ”

178487	178512	178477	178477	he	144	“ I suppose it ’s this damp heat . Will it annoy you if I smoke a cigarette ? I feel my brain spinning . ”
178529	178533	178534	178534	she	171	“ Mr Hamlin , ”
178553	178608	178534	178534	she	171	“ it is going on three years since I left Coblenz and came into this house . I am over twenty‐four , and I do n’t think it is possible to continue much longer on the theory that I am your ward . It is time that something should be decided about my future . ”
178625	178632	178633	178633	he	145	“ I quite agree with you , ”
178636	178736	178633	178633	he	145	“ and I fully see how greatly I am to blame in not having forestalled you . You must not suppose that I have not thought more than once about this matter . I have done so , I assure you . But somehow , things have always come in the way ; and then , you know , I — I did not wish to put any pressure upon you . In short , I am unable to say how it is that I have placed myself in what may appear to be the wrong in this matter . ”
178746	178750	178751	178751	he	145	“ Forgive me , ”
178754	178769	178751	178751	he	145	“ for being so feeble this morning . I really have a wretched headache . ”
178770	178778	178780	178780	Anne	171	“ I am very sorry for you , ”
178790	178828	178751	178751	he	145	“ but all the same , I feel that I can no longer delay , and that I must avail myself of this opportunity to ask you a question . Have you any intention of marrying me ? ”
178918	178922	178923	178923	he	145	“ Miss Brown , ”
178938	179091	178927	178927	his	145	“ you have , if you remember the terms of our reciprocal engagement , always been free ; and you are free . It is rather sad for me to reflect — and perhaps a little sad for you also — how very differently things have turned out from what I believe both of us anticipated . And it is , as you may understand , not a little sad to part with what has been the best thing in my life — to end my best episode . But you must remember that I never wished you to be otherwise than perfectly independent ; it has been a great matter in a useless life like mine to have contributed to reinstate you , as it were , in your birthright ; it will be something to think of later , that I have been conducive in making you what you are ; and”—Hamlin
179101	179136	178927	178927	his	145	hand—“will you believe me also when I say that I am very , very happy that you have found a man whom you can love and respect , and who can make you happy ? ”
179208	179252	179253	179253	Anne	171	“ You do n’t understand me . I was not alluding to any notion of marrying my cousin . I do n’t want to marry Richard . What I want to ask you is this : Will you marry me , Mr Hamlin ? ”
179377	179382	179383	179383	he	145	“ Anne — Anne ! ”
179412	179419	179420	179420	he	145	“ Anne — you love me , ”

179604	179608	179609	179609	he	145	“ Forgive me , ”
179612	179673	179609	179609	he	145	“ forgive me — oh , forgive me , Anne . That all this time I should have been so blind — thought you indifferent and contemptuous . Oh , forgive me for all my wickedness , my folly ; forgive me , my darling , for not having understood that I belonged to you , that you loved me . ”
179730	179735	179736	179736	she	171	“ Well , then , ”
179740	179792	179736	179736	she	171	“ perhaps you can understand that — after what has passed , you understand — I am anxious that we should get married at once . Perry was asking me , only the other day , why things had dragged on so long ; and then also there is . . . ”
179793	179797	179799	179799	Hamlin	145	“ I understand , ”
179801	179837	179799	179799	Hamlin	145	“ Oh , forgive me , dearest . I never , never really loved that woman : I could not have loved her . I have never loved but you . Will you believe it ? ”
179838	179853	179856	179856	Anne	171	“ You will never see her again?—I mean , never except in my presence ? ”
179858	179899	179856	179856	Anne	171	“ Will you promise that ? And will you promise to leave London in a day or two — to go to Italy , anywhere where she is not — and wait till I can join you with Aunt Claudia ? ”
179900	179963	179964	179964	Anne	171	“ I promise ; I will do anything . Oh , Anne , if only you will forget all that ; if you will believe me when I tell you that I never loved that woman — that I felt the whole time that she was debasing , humiliating me , making me forfeit all my honour and my happiness . . . ”
180016	180023	180024	180024	she	171	“ You have promised , remember , ”
180025	180077	180078	180078	Hamlin	145	repeated,—“you will leave to‐morrow , the day after — as soon as you can . You wo n’t tell her where you are going — do you understand ? You will write to‐day , and tell her of our marriage , and that you have promised never to see her again . ”
180085	180089	180078	180078	Hamlin	145	“ And listen , ”
180095	180177	180078	180078	Hamlin	145	“ this evening there is a big party at the Argiropoulos . I did not intend going ; but I wish to go now . Write to Mrs Argiropoulo to tell her we are coming together ; explain that we are going to be married ; ask her to tell all her guests . I want every one to know . Do you understand , Mr Hamlin — Walter , I mean ? You wo n’t lose time , will you ? ”
180178	180183	180185	180185	Hamlin	145	“ No , no ! ”
180187	180206	180208	180208	he	145	“ I understand . Only forgive me ; and tell me that you love me , my darling ; ”
180222	180249	180208	180208	he	145	“ Tell me that you forgive me for all that I have made you suffer , Anne . Speak,—only one word , Anne — one word . ”
180258	180265	180266	180266	she	171	“ I forgive you , Walter , ”

180310	180336	180298	180298	she	171	“ I want you to accompany me and Aunt Claudia there in a few days . Mr Hamlin and I are going to be married . ”
180337	180343	180345	180345	Perry	152	“ God bless my soul ! ”
180347	180360	180345	180345	Perry	152	“ When — where — why did n’t you tell me before ? ”
180739	180748	180750	180751	Madame Elaguine	360	“ You are very tired , Annie dear , ”
180777	180805	180762	180762	her	360	“ All this emotion — this general ovation and triumph , this great joy of satisfied love — has been too much for you , poor child ! ”
180856	180872	180873	180873	she	171	“ I am merely rather tired . I did n’t get much sleep last night , ”
180945	180949	180951	180951	Sacha	386	“ Poor child ! ”
180967	181092	180951	180951	Sacha	386	“ Poor child ! Ah , well , I wo n’t bore you with congratulations . I know Walter sufficiently well to know how happy he will make you ; and I know how deeply you have loved him all the while , and how faithfully he has always loved you . But I want to give you a little wedding‐present . I have brought it here , because Walter has written to me that you do n’t want to have your bliss disturbed , and are going off at once . Quite right . When people are very happy , there ’s something immodest in letting the world see it and be jealous ; that ’s the classic view , is n’t it ? ”
181113	181118	181096	181096	she	3836	“ Oh dear no , ”
181124	181214	181096	181096	she	3836	“ you must n’t think I ’ve been ruining myself . I ’m far too much of a pauper and far too selfish to go making handsome presents . It does n’t cost me anything , you see , for Walter gave me them last month ; and as I really do n’t care a jackstraw about pearls , and I accepted them merely to please him , I think it ’s much better you should have them to make the set complete , since you have the necklace . ”
181343	181347	181348	181348	she	171	“ Thank you , ”
181362	181389	181390	181390	she	171	“ I do n’t think I could wear them , Madame Elaguine . And I do n’t think my husband would wish me to wear them , ”
181402	181409	181411	181412	the Russian	5582	“ Wo n’t you , really ? ”
181414	181551	181411	181412	the Russian	5582	“ I assure you Walter will be most mortified if he hear that you have refused them . It would be a hundred pities that the set should be spoilt . I would n’t have taken these , if he had n’t told me that I should have the rest . You see , I was the nearest of kin last month . And I ’m sure it would make poor Aunt Philippa turn in her grave to know that all her things did not go to Miss Anne Brown . Ah , well — as you like . I can always get them exchanged at the jeweller ’s for something else — or I ’ll tell Walter , and he can buy them back for you . That ’s more like a pauper ’s proceeding . ”
181552	181559	181561	181561	Anne	171	“ Thank you , Madame Elaguine , ”
181567	181586	181561	181561	Anne	171	“ I think I ought to go and talk to some of the people in the next room . ”
181596	181728	181588	181589	Madame Elaguine	360	“ Do n’t go yet , my dear Madonna of the Glaciers — I sha n’t see you again , perhaps , for a long while , and I want you to tell me some things . I ’m a horrible ill‐bred little creature , I know , but I ca n’t help it . I ’ve always had a lot of morbid curiosities . One of them is how love‐marriages are made up — how it all comes about . You see I was n’t married for love — I was married for money by my Russian relations . But I always think I should like to know about love‐marriages . Tell me what Walter said to you — how he did it . I wish I ’d seen it . ”
181747	181781	181784	181785	Madame Elaguine	360	“ Did you always love him — ever since the beginning — ever since he sent you to school ; and have you always gone on caring for him in the same way ? ”
181787	181832	181784	181785	Madame Elaguine	360	“ Fancy , I thought you did n’t care much for Walter , almost disliked him ; I almost thought you were in love with your big black cousin . It was like my obtuseness ! Do tell me all about it . . . ”
181833	181844	181846	181846	Anne	171	“ There is nothing to tell you , Madame Elaguine , ”
181848	181863	181846	181846	Anne	171	“ Mr Hamlin and I are going to be married , that ’s all . ”
181864	181868	181870	181871	Madame Elaguine	360	“ In short , ”
181879	182056	181870	181871	Madame Elaguine	360	“ you thought better of it ; you learned to appreciate the satisfaction of getting a handsome husband , with a good name and a good fortune . I think you are quite right . Mrs Hamlin of Wotton sounds better than Mrs Richard Brown . Or else are you still sufficiently human to enjoy making a man give the cold shoulder to another woman ? I fear I must spoil your satisfaction in this . I have never cared a button for Walter . I would not have married Walter for anything you could offer me ; I only cared to bring down his pride a little , in remembrance of the days when his great virtue of seventeen had me turned out of my uncle ’s house , like a housemaid who has made love with the butler . As to Walter himself , you are welcome to him , though I do n’t promise that some day the whim may not return to me to amuse myself a little more at his expense . ”
182113	182122	182123	182123	she	171	“ All this is very useless and disagreeable , ”
182130	182136	182123	182123	she	171	“ Good‐bye , Madame Elaguine . ”
182148	182152	182153	182153	she	386	“ I see , ”
182156	182284	182153	182153	she	386	“ your friend and former master Mr Perry has been entertaining you with anecdotes of my life , and perhaps Edmund Lewis has been doing so also . Very shocking , were n’t they ? Well , I wo n’t insult you any longer with my presence . But I think it ’s as well that you should know in time that if I have been in the mud according to your ideas , Walter Hamlin has been into it with me . It ’s rather difficult to make such things clear to a Madonna of the Glaciers , but perhaps Mr Perry will help you to understand the matter . To put it plainly , ever since you fell ill , Walter has been my lover . ”
182331	182337	182339	182340	Miss Brown	171	“ I knew it already , ”
182350	182355	182357	182358	Madame Elaguine	360	“ You knew it ! ”
182372	182377	182378	182378	she	360	“ You knew it ! ”
182393	182494	182378	182378	she	360	“ You knew it , and you make him marry you all the same ! Well , I wish you all possible happiness , and I rejoice that Walter has got a wife who understands so well how to deal with him . As to me , pray do n’t think that I bear you any malice . I am only surprised and amused ; and extremely interested , from the psychological point of view , in finding that a virtuous woman may condescend to things which would turn the stomach of a woman who has no pretence to virtue . ”
182567	182578	182579	182579	he	145	“ I fear I must be going home rather early , ”
182582	182608	182609	182609	he	145	“ as I set off for the Italian lakes tomorrow morning , and all my packing still remains to be done . And I think , ”
182619	182637	182609	182609	he	145	“ that Miss Brown looks rather tired also , and ought to let me escort her home . ”
182664	182669	182670	182670	she	171	“ Let us go , ”
182688	182694	182695	182695	he	145	“ Good evening , Annie , ”

182717	182723	182725	182726	Miss Brown	171	“ Thank you , Dick , ”
182734	182759	182728	182728	her	171	“ I ’m sorry it ’s so late ; the carriage is at the door , and Mr Hamlin and I must be leaving . ”

182770	182799	182768	182768	Brown	171	“ Well , then , I will take you down , and help you to get your wraps , while Mr Hamlin finishes taking leave of his friends . ”
182843	182872	182830	182831	Mrs Argiropoulo	261	“ Well , I must say it is a satisfaction to see two people who are really made for each other , like Walter Hamlin and dear Anne . ”
182925	182932	182934	182934	Hamlin	145	“ Anne , are you there ? ”

183000	183009	182994	182994	her	171	“ you have been very good to me — ”
183057	183066	183042	183042	he	145	“ Good‐bye , Nan — you mercenary creature ! ”
183082	183088	183090	183093	fat old Mr Saunders	451	“ Here , Mr Chough , ”
183102	183140	183090	183093	fat old Mr Saunders	451	“ you ’ll be just in time to write a nice bridal ode while Miss Brown packs her boxes to‐morrow . Mind you cut out Spenser and Suckling and all the rest of them , old boy . ”
183171	183182	183183	183183	he	451	“ Some better poet than I must write that ode , ”
183186	183211	183183	183183	he	451	“ all that her poor servant Cosmo can do , is to thank Miss Brown from all his heart for marrying his dearest friend . ”
183230	183239	183240	183240	she	171	“ Is the carriage there , Mr Hamlin ? ”

183307	183315	183294	183294	he	145	“ Are you cold , my love ? ”
