113	119	137	139	the fairy princess	158	“ live happy ever after . ”
359	364	395	395	Chloe	45	“ dressing - room . ”
520	525	526	526	she	45	“ You are horrid , ”
529	542	526	526	she	45	“ Why do n't you shave in your own dressing - room ? ”
543	549	551	551	I.	0	“ Whatever does it matter ? ”
552	558	559	559	she	45	“ My sachet 's ruined , ”
577	583	584	584	she	45	“ It 's no use , ”
588	655	584	584	she	45	“ I spend all my time trying to keep the house nice , and you 're always putting things down on things . You put your hateful fountain - pen down on the new drawn - linen table - centre only yesterday , and it 's made a great ink mark . Yes , you did — when you were writing the check for the butcher . ”
668	675	677	677	Chloe	45	“ But they 're not trifles , ”
679	696	677	677	Chloe	45	“ They 're just the little things that make all the difference between a home and — ”
697	700	584	584	she	45	“ And ? ”
701	738	677	677	Chloe	45	“ And other places . Breakfast will be quite spoiled . You 're frightfully late . And I do n't think this girl means to stay ; she 's been quite rude about the haddock already . ”
770	1204	767	767	I	0	“ Please do n't wait breakfast for me , and began to brush my hair with a dignified aloofness . Chloe went out , and I own that she banged the door . When I was ready I went down to breakfast . Chloe was reading the paper — a thing she never does . She poured out my tea and gave it to me without a glance . Thanking her coldly , I helped myself to haddock and opened my letters . It was with the second letter that the shock came . I read the letter twice . And I looked round our little dining - room — it was about ten feet by nine — and I sighed . For I knew — surely if inexplicably — that the dove of peace which had folded its wings there had spread them on a flight from which it would , perhaps , never return . I had quarrelled with my wife — about a shaving - brush ; but that episode had now shrunk to less than nothing in the presence of the new , the wonderful danger that threatened our home . I looked at the neat breakfast - table , bright with our wedding - presents — cruet - stands , butter - dishes , and silver - plated teaspoons . I looked at the row of shelves over the mantel - piece , where the more attractive of our crockery stood displayed ; at the corner cupboard , picked up for a song in Great Portland Street , and fitted with a lock inexorably guarding the marmalade , the loaf sugar , the sardines , the bottled beer , and such like costly items . I looked at Chloe , mutinously reading the paper — in a white muslin blouse which had been green , with white flowers on it , when we bought it together in the Lewisham High Street for twopence three farthings the yard , and which to my mind was all the prettier for the theft , by soap and water , of its original hue and design . I looked at the remains of the haddock on the dish , the two eggs in the eggstand — another wedding - present . And again I sighed . Chloe laid down the paper irresolutely and looked towards , but not at , me . I sighed again and stirred my tea . I could see that Chloe was making a heroic resolve to overcome her pride and end the quarrel . She did it . “
1213	1219	1206	1206	you	165	” she asked , severely . “
1223	1230	1206	1206	you	165	” I spoke from the heart . “
1236	1292	1234	1234	I	0	” she cried . And suddenly the first quarrel found itself over . Presently we went on with the breakfast . To be more accurate , we began . But my thoughts refused to bury themselves in the beefsteak - pudding which Chloe unfolded as a brilliant dinner prospect , and I sighed once more . “
1329	1361	1326	1326	she	0	” Chloe asked , making horseshoes in her pretty forehead , as she always does when life presents to her any problem not immediately soluble in a laugh or a joke . “
1427	1428	1435	1435	madam	169	” “
1437	1441	1443	1443	Moses	46	” I said , “
1475	1476	1478	1478	you	0	” “
1486	1490	1478	1478	you	0	” she asked . “
1496	1497	1478	1478	you	0	” “
1501	1505	1478	1478	you	0	” I said , “
1532	1539	1523	1523	you	169	” She came and perched there . “
1548	1552	1546	1546	Len	47	” she said . “
1567	1580	1581	1581	My	0	” Then I put my arm round her and spoke out roundly . “
1584	1588	1581	1581	My	0	” I said , “
1593	1594	1581	1581	My	0	” “
1603	1610	1597	1597	Len	47	” said Chloe , much interested . “
1613	1619	1597	1597	Len	47	” I said , firmly . “
1688	1797	1892	1893	the girl	180	” I am not sure that Chloe did not weep for joy . Though as a rule , one knows , that sort of weeping is only done in books . You see , we really had worked so very , very hard . However much in love one may be , one does not like to work ten hours a day . Though two may not grudge it as the price of life together . I wrote , Chloe illustrated — we worked hard — hard — hard , and earned enough to keep body and soul and the two of us together in our microscopic house . “
1800	1891	1892	1893	the girl	180	” we called it , but on its gatepost it called itself Ross Villa . And now — a hundred a year , and a house — such a house . It came back to me out of my youth , a monument of comfortable affluence , with vineries and pineries , and pits and frames , clean - shaved lawns and trim orchards , yew avenues , box edgings , stabling and coach - houses and pigsties and henneries . Chloe and I clung together in an ecstasy , till “
1894	1988	1892	1893	the girl	180	” came in to clear away breakfast . I never saw anything more dramatic than the way in which she indicated , as she bore out the empty dish , that her opinion of the haddock was not only entirely unaltered , but indeed confirmed , by our having eaten it . My article for the Weekly Wilderness got itself written somehow , but with difficulty , for Chloe , demoralized by our good fortune , interrupted me at every sentence — a thing we have carefully trained each other not to do . “
1994	2017	1892	1893	the girl	180	” she asked , suddenly , stopping in front of me with a compelling wave of her wand , or feather brush . “
2026	2027	2019	2019	you	182	” “
2032	2036	2019	2019	you	182	” I said . “
2046	2047	2043	2044	an angel	184	” “
2053	2064	2043	2044	an angel	184	” after a pause and an interval of fluffy energy . “
2068	2072	2043	2044	an angel	184	” I said ; “
2089	2090	2082	2082	You	186	” “
2123	2124	2108	2108	Len	47	” “
2184	2367	2370	2370	you	191	” But the interruption ruined a delightful sentence , conceived in a spirit of the most delicate irony , and dealing with the late deplorable action of the London water companies — and again I experienced that premonition of unrest . Never again , I felt certain , should I be able to be sure of a clear morning 's work . I made allowances for my wife . I was not , I feel certain , unjust or unreasonable , but I saw that while the house and the money were new topics , she could not be expected to preserve on them the hours of silence which my writing exacted . And by the time the topics were stale , the beautiful habit of letting each other alone during working - hours would have been broken forever . I laid down my fountain - pen to make these reflections . I heard Chloe pulling out drawers and opening cupboards in our room overhead . Yet before I could snatch up my pen she had whirled in and caught me idle . “
2393	2394	2382	2382	I	0	” “
2400	2430	2395	2395	I	0	” I said , beginning to write very fast , and not sufficiently grateful , I fear , for her indifference to the money as compared with the house . “
2451	2452	2453	2453	I	0	” “
2466	2472	2455	2455	I	0	” she said , guiltily . “
2486	2613	2481	2481	I	0	” But she was back again in less than half an hour with a question about larders burning on her lips , and my article degenerated from the clear , sustained logical argument which it meant to be , to a piece of patch - work — of patch - work ill fitted . I became desperate , and avenged my poor broken article by telling Chloe anything rather than the truth about my uncle 's old house . In the end this disingenuousness was paid for to the uttermost . If I had prepared her , if I had had the intelligence to overpaint , even , the charms of that old house — but I was firm , firm to the point of spitefulness . “
2642	2800	2481	2481	I	0	” This was the most she got out of me . My piece of patch - work got its last stitches put in sooner than I expected . I put it in its envelope , addressed it , and went up to our room . All the wardrobe drawers were pulled out . Chloe was sitting on the floor amid a heap of stuffs — a roll of chintz which her mother had given her for covers to our drawing - room furniture , if ever we had any ; some bits of velvet , soft reds and greens , that we had bought together at Liberty 's sale ; and she was snipping and tearing at a muslin and lace gown — a gown I had always admired . I remember she wore it to breakfast the day after our wedding . I felt as though my tenderest memories were being unpicked , stitch by stitch . “
2805	2822	2481	2481	I	0	” I said . She looked up with a flush of excitement on her little face . “
2872	2906	2853	2853	I	0	” My blood actually ran cold . I sat down suddenly on the clothes - basket . Chloe was not too preoccupied to tell me not to , for perhaps the twentieth time . “
2916	2920	2853	2853	I	0	” she said . “
2952	2977	2944	2944	I	0	” She got up , scattering muslin and velvet , and began to turn over a corner drawer . I found a trembling tongue . “
2992	3010	2984	2984	we	198	” She dropped a lace scarf and her best ivory prayer - book to look at me . “
3014	3015	2984	2984	we	198	” “
3027	3028	3021	3021	We	198	” “
3043	3044	3021	3021	We	198	” “
3071	3080	3081	3081	My	0	” Chloe 's eyes actually filled with tears . “
3087	3091	3081	3081	My	0	” I said , “
3128	3143	3162	3162	You	0	” She came to me then and asked me not to be so horrid . “
3148	3152	3162	3162	You	0	” she said , “
3195	3267	3162	3162	You	0	” I talked to her in a thoroughly reasonable way , and she presently promised that she also would be reasonable . She agreed that we must let the house . Also she insisted that as I had finished my work , we should go at once and look at it . I in my turn agreed . It was while I was lacing my boots that she said , sighing : “
3287	3475	3275	3275	you	47	” Even then I might have put up an arm to ward off the blow fate was aiming at me , but my bootlace was in a hard knot , and I said nothing on any other subject . In the hour when afternoon ends and evening begins , we set out to see the Red House . We rode our bicycles , of course . Poor as we were , we could yet command , on the hire system , machines which , at any rate , in their first youth , might have been the desire of princes . Once we had passed the dusty avenue of little villas ( wherein our Bandbox , the corner house , squeezed in between two more portly brethren , is of all the most unworthy ) , and had done the three miles of respectable semi - detachedness which form on this side of town the outer fringe of London 's loathly suburbs , our way lay through green lanes where hawthorns were budding in pink and pearl . And here I received a final note of warning . “
3480	3502	3478	3478	Len	47	” Chloe sighed , reining in her shining steed to gaze wistfully on the trim green of the scattered suburban pleasaunces , “
3539	3540	3541	3541	I	0	” “
3547	3635	3541	3541	I	0	” I said , briskly . It was merely a polite acquiescence in her aspiration , but it was noted . I , blind mole , noted nothing . The most explicit warnings pass us by unheeded ; it is only after the doom stroke has fallen that we perceive the significance of portents . We climbed the hill and passed through the long , sunny village street , clamorous now with bean - feasters and superior private pleasure parties in wagonettes drawn up in front of the “
3638	3640	3541	3541	I	0	” and “
3643	3646	3541	3541	I	0	” and the “
3650	3727	3541	3541	I	0	” for was it not Saturday , and the village but a bare ten miles from Charing Cross ? Then came the sharp turn to the left , the delicious downward rush through hawthorn - scented air , the black bar of shadow from the railway bridge , a red cottage , a red wall , tall chestnut - trees , pyramids of green fan - leaves and miraculous - scented flowers — a green gate . “
3732	3824	3541	3541	I	0	” I said , and Chloe brought down the brake in that reckless way of hers , and sprang to the ground . The sun - blistered , old , green gate swung long and wide on loud , red , rusty hinges as we led our beasts in . We left them under the biggest of the chestnut - trees , and walked up the wide , moss - grown drive to where the front door , fortified by heavy stone pillars , seemed to defy us , the besiegers . “
3830	4091	3541	3541	I	0	” asked Chloe , in a whisper . And well might she ask . The yellow brick on which in my talk I had laid so much stress was hidden almost — at any rate transformed , transfigured — by a net - work of great leaves and red buds ; creepers covered it — all but . And at the side there were jasmine that in July nights would be starry and scented , and wistaria , purple - flowered and yellow - leaved over its thick , gnarled boughs , and ivy ; and at the back , where the shaky green veranda is overhung by the perilous charm of the white balcony , Virginia - creepers and climbing roses grew in a thorny maze . The moat was there , girdling the old lawns — where once the Elizabethan manor stood — with a belt of silver , a sad swan and a leaky boat keeping each other company . Yellow laburnums trailed their long hair in the water , and sweet lilac - bushes swayed to look at their pretty plumes reflected in it . To right and left stretched the green tangled mysteries of the overgrown gardens . We stepped back onto the bridge that crosses the moat , and looked up at the tall house . Before the ivy dressed it , it must have been very ugly . I suspect my uncle of having had that ivy clipped to its last leaf every spring ; and he must have had the house scraped and “
4093	4163	4164	4164	You	209	” pretty often . How otherwise account for the yellow brick hideousness that glared at me through the mist of the years lying between me and my childhood ? The Red House is square , and very tall , but it has two large , low , long wings ending in four square brick turrets with pointed roofs . We stood and looked at it , and I said , “
4177	4183	4164	4164	You	209	” Chloe assented , feverishly : “
4201	4223	4164	4164	You	209	” We could n't , because I had forgotten to call at the plumber 's in the village for the key . “
4232	4236	4225	4225	I	0	” I said , “
4261	4262	4258	4258	you	209	” “
4270	4276	4264	4264	we	210	” said Chloe , firmly . “
4297	4306	4310	4310	you	209	” Already she was stooping for a stone . “
4324	4354	4264	4264	we	210	” We went round the house and round the house , like the snow in the riddle ; but every window had its eyelids down , as Chloe said . “
4360	4364	4264	4264	we	210	” she said , “
4384	4385	4373	4373	you	209	” “
4389	4393	4373	4373	you	209	” I said . “
4429	4453	4409	4409	he	215	” I was looking at the thick , twisted stems of the ivy that clung to the wall of the low left wing . “
4474	4475	4589	4589	you'll	218	” “
4478	4479	4589	4589	you'll	218	” “
4518	4531	4506	4506	I	0	” Chloe measured the height with her eyes , some ten feet . “
4535	4585	4506	4506	I	0	” she said , meekly . And I went up the ivy . It was as easy as going up a ladder ; but I own that as I stepped onto the leads I did not expect to hear my wife 's voice just below my feet , saying , “
4593	4625	4626	4626	You	219	” She had climbed up the ivy behind me . I said nothing till I had pulled her up to stand safely beside me , and then I fairly shook her . “
4629	4633	4626	4626	You	219	” I said . “
4651	4655	4639	4639	You	219	” She laughed . “
4671	4704	4639	4639	You	219	” As I was out of my cradle twenty - two years ago , and that was three years before she was even in hers , this insult called for no reply . “
4726	4730	4706	4706	you	220	” she said . “
4747	4773	4706	4706	you	220	” It was . I broke one of the cobwebby panes , and opened the window , but , of course , it was barred . “
4806	4821	4822	4822	I	0	” Chloe was looking at the bars . Suddenly she took her hat off . “
4829	4833	4822	4822	I	0	” she said . “
4842	4874	4834	4834	You	220	” The bottom of the window was level with the leads . She twisted her skirt round her ankles as she sat down , and pushed both feet between the bars . “
4901	4912	4898	4898	I	0	” She twisted herself like an eel through the bars . “
4918	4934	4898	4898	I	0	” and the next moment she was laughing at me out of the dark window . “
4939	4941	4898	4898	I	0	” I said.—“Open
4956	4991	4949	4949	I	0	” She disappeared . The little door shook to her withdrawal of the rust - locked bolts . I bent my head and stepped in . A kiss met my face in the dark . “
4997	5021	4898	4898	I	0	” she said . We went down the little , dark , rickety staircase . At the bottom was a door . Locked . “
5029	5033	4898	4898	I	0	” said Chloe . “
5040	5063	4898	4898	I	0	” I said , for my blood was up now , and , besides , the door did not feel very firm . “
5070	5129	4898	4898	I	0	” she said , when the door had given way to the pressure of mine , and we found ourselves standing in the great , dark kitchen , where the thin , dusty shafts of yellow sunlight shot through the shuttercracks . We had down those shutters , and looked out through the dingy windows on the moat . “
5138	5147	5132	5132	Len	47	” she said , and kissed me again . “
5191	5275	5132	5132	Len	47	” We explored the pantry and the servants ' hall , the little bedrooms above , and then along the flagged passage to the great hall , tiled with white and red marble , with the oak staircase winding up out of it . We explored the living - rooms that led from it , and before we had climbed the first flight of stairs to the great drawing - room , my wife was breathless with enthusiasm . She kissed me in every room—“for
5278	5308	5132	5132	Len	47	” as she explained — and when at last even the great attics held nothing concealed from us , I calculated that I had received twenty - nine kisses . “
5318	5351	5132	5132	Len	47	” I said , thoughtfully , when at last I had replaced all the shutters , and had persuaded her to come out and let me bang the big door after us . “
5363	5367	5132	5132	Len	47	” said Chloe . “
5387	5489	5490	5490	I	0	” We went . The old garden had always been beautiful to me , even in the days when I used secretly to eat gooseberries there , and plums , and peaches in an unripe state ; and it was beautiful now , even as I remembered it , only now its trees and bushes were incredibly grown — moss- cushioned its paths . Its fountains were dry and weed grown , and its sun - dial was covered with briony and woody nightshade . I put aside the green trails to show Chloe the motto , Horas numero nisi serenas ( “
5496	5515	5519	5519	you	229	” ) . She leaned her elbows on the top of the sundial , and looked at me . “
5522	5526	5519	5519	you	229	” she said . “
5540	5541	5542	5542	My	0	” “
5566	5567	5568	5568	I	0	” “
5581	5585	5573	5573	we	230	” said she . “
5600	5601	5573	5573	we	230	” “
5615	5616	5603	5603	we	230	” “
5635	5636	5632	5632	their	240	” “
5654	5655	5642	5642	I	0	” “
5663	5664	5657	5657	you	0	” “
5701	5702	5698	5698	you	47	” “
5720	5728	5704	5704	you	0	” There were four on the estate . “
5738	5739	5729	5729	I	0	” “
5747	5751	5752	5752	I	0	” I said . “
5757	5767	5754	5755	the Bandbox	6	” she said , mutinously . Then I laughed . “
5772	5776	5777	5777	I	0	” I said , “
5798	5879	5882	5882	you	0	” Chloe mounted in silence , and in silence we rode away . In the village I stopped at the plumber's — he is also a builder and a house agent , and though it was Saturday , he was , after all , at home — and rather hurriedly told him to try and let the Red House . Chloe said nothing , but stood beside me pale with the strain of her inward protest . We rode on . “
5884	5890	5882	5882	you	0	” she said , presently . “
6031	6032	6024	6024	you	256	” “
6045	6049	6033	6033	You	256	” I said , “
6090	6091	6087	6088	the doctor	265	” “
6100	6112	6094	6094	you	0	” she said , riding faster and faster in her indignation . “
6161	6406	6149	6149	You	0	” What spells she worked I do n't know , nor how she worked them . But , curiously enough , no one did take the house . City gentleman after city gentleman approached and retreated after a parley , that always ended in suggestions for repairs to the tune of from four to five hundred pounds . At first each new applicant was to me an object of interest , and to Chloe an object of jealous detestation . But as time wore on , and each new candidate told the same unflattering tale of the shocking state of repairs at the Red House , the hour came when at the accustomed formula I merely smiled . But Chloe laughed , a laugh of triumph and delight . We used to ride over there every day to see if the house was let , and it never was ; and more and more flowers came out in the garden — old , small sweet tulips and forget - me - nots and hearts - ease , and the roses were in tiny bud . And never for a day did Chloe cease to cry for the moon . The 27th of May is her birthday . It is also the anniversary of the day on which I first met her . So that when , on that day , she held her hand up to look at her new turquoises , and said , “
6443	6450	6436	6436	you	47	instead”—I could hold out no longer . “
6454	6458	6436	6436	you	47	” I said , “
6492	6493	6481	6481	you	47	” “
6499	6503	6481	6481	you	47	” she cried . “
6519	6520	6510	6510	you	270	” “
6529	6545	6510	6510	you	270	” I began , with proper severity . But she stopped my mouth quite irresistibly . “
6557	6561	6552	6552	I	0	” she said . “
6612	6613	6605	6605	we	273	” “
6619	6623	6605	6605	we	273	” I said . “
6627	6631	6605	6605	we	273	” said she . “
6638	6639	6605	6605	we	273	” “
6646	6647	6605	6605	we	273	” “
6656	6657	6649	6649	we	273	” “
6665	6666	6659	6659	we	273	” “
6674	6675	6659	6659	we	273	” “
6686	6687	6659	6659	we	273	” “
6694	6695	6696	6696	We	273	” “
6701	6702	6705	6705	you	0	” “
6708	6709	6705	6705	you	0	” “
6723	6724	6710	6710	I	0	” “
6732	6733	6734	6734	They	279	” “
6741	6742	6734	6734	They	279	” “
6748	6752	6734	6734	They	279	” I said . “
6757	6761	6734	6734	They	279	” said she . “
6798	6799	6800	6800	You	281	” “
6808	6820	6734	6734	They	279	” she said , but even at that moment she sighed . “
6829	6830	6823	6823	you	281	” “
6838	6938	6823	6823	you	281	” And so it was decided . The blow I had dreaded had fallen . My own hands had guided it . On the 6th of June we were to take possession of an immense mansion , standing in its own grounds , replete with every possible inconvenience . Chloe dropped her work and sewed curtains all day . I had never known her so happy . And indeed , now that the die was cast , I myself felt that our new experiment had in it at least all the elements of interest . I owned as much . “
6941	6945	6823	6823	you	281	” said Chloe , “
6989	7051	6967	6967	you	281	” Nor had she . Had either of us even faintly imagined a tenth part of what was to befall us in that house — And yet I do n't know . Chloe says now that she would have left the safe shelter of the Bandbox just the same . And I — well , as you see , if Chloe only “
7056	7064	6967	6967	you	281	” I am foolish enough for anything . “
7072	7076	7065	7065	YOU	281	” Chloe said . “
7091	7092	7093	7093	I	0	” “
7105	7144	7093	7093	I	0	” I replied , as I sat on a packing - case and stirred with my boot - toe a tangle of brown paper , string , dust , and empty bottles on the dining - room floor . “
7147	7151	7152	7152	Your	281	” she said . “
7164	7165	7152	7152	Your	281	” “
7188	7189	7170	7170	I	0	” “
7195	7201	7193	7193	me	0	” she said , briskly , “
7225	7226	7216	7216	It	290	” “
7232	7233	7216	7216	It	290	” “
7240	7244	7216	7216	It	290	” she interrupted . “
7306	7328	7269	7269	it	293	” She came and sat beside me on the packing - case , and I absently put my arm round her . “
7337	7341	7269	7269	it	293	” I said . “
7374	7375	7269	7269	it	293	” “
7381	7387	7269	7269	it	293	” she said , contemptuously . “
7397	7579	7393	7395	a good boy	298	” Acquiescing , I pinched her ears softly . What my wife terms sensible conversation is unworthy to be reported . The Bandbox lay before us , so to speak , in little bits . All the curtains were down , and all the pictures . The crockery was packed up , so were the wedding - presents . The saucepans and kettles sat in a forlorn group on the sitting - room floor . Our comfortable beds were now nothing but rolls of striped ticking and long , iron bands — lying about where one could best trip over them . The wall - papers , which had looked so bright and pleasant with our books and pictures on them , now showed , in patches of aggressively unfaded color , the outlines of the shelves and frames that had hung against them . The fire that had boiled our breakfast - kettle had gone out , and the cold ashes looked inexpressibly desolate . As we sat awaiting the arrival of our green - grocer , who had undertaken to “
7581	7592	7593	7593	I	0	” us , I pointed out the ashes to Chloe . “
7605	7649	7595	7595	you	298	” said she . The green - grocer had promised to come at nine o'clock . That was why we had got up in the middle of the night , and finished our packing before eight o'clock . It was now past ten . “
7657	7660	7650	7650	He	299	” said I. “
7703	7704	7706	7706	he	299	” “
7709	7739	7706	7706	he	299	” said Chloe , jumping off the packing - case at the squeaking sound which ever preludes any weak effort on the part of the Bandbox door - knocker . “
7744	7752	7742	7742	Len	47	” she whispered , in awestruck tones , “
7779	7780	7771	7772	a lady	304	” “
7788	7842	7771	7772	a lady	304	” said I , and indeed , in her white gown and blue pinafore , with her brown hair loose and ruffled , she made so pretty a picture that I could not help thinking how a really high - toned green - grocer might well have refused base coin as the price of “
7844	7857	7771	7772	a lady	304	” us , counting himself well paid by the sight of her . “
7866	7900	7901	7901	Chloe	45	” I said , and went . Chloe hid herself behind the kitchen door , where the jack - towel used to hang . Even its roller had been unscrewed and packed now . “
7903	7907	7901	7901	Chloe	45	” I called , “
7918	7919	7916	7916	Yolande	52	” “
7924	7929	7916	7916	Yolande	52	” Miss Riseborough echoed . “
7947	7948	7949	7949	Yolande	52	” “
7951	7955	7949	7949	Yolande	52	” Chloe cried . “
7964	7965	7959	7959	you	52	” “
8024	8043	8108	8108	you	52	” She was taking the long , pearl - headed pins out of her hat as she spoke . “
8046	8053	8108	8108	you	52	” said my wife , again . “
8082	8086	8108	8108	you	52	” But murmuring , “
8092	8102	8108	8108	you	52	” Yolande sank down on a roll of bedding . “
8143	8192	8193	8193	You	52	” Then the whole story came out — of Chloe 's folly and of my madness . Yolande listened intently , her bright , gray eyes taking in Chloe 's transports , and my all too moderate enthusiasm , as well as the devastated state of the Bandbox . “
8199	8203	8193	8193	You	52	” she said . “
8225	8226	8229	8229	you	0	” “
8232	8239	8229	8229	you	0	” said I , with intent . “
8322	8323	8310	8310	you	0	” “
8332	8336	8310	8310	you	0	” I said . “
8388	8412	8357	8357	you	0	” Of course we would , gladly , and we said so . And then we talked — always of the Red House . “
8429	8436	8441	8441	you	0	” Yolande said , at last , “
8528	8529	8522	8525	the samphire - gatherers	325	” “
8537	8550	8522	8525	the samphire - gatherers	325	” said I , drawing the cork of the ginger - ale , “
8583	8597	8564	8564	I	0	” So we stood up solemnly and raised our glasses to my toast , “
8606	8611	8564	8564	I	0	” Then said Yolande , “
8620	8627	8614	8615	the Babes	54	” And to Chloe 's toast , “
8641	8672	8637	8639	the fairy godmother	328	” we emptied the glasses . Then Yolande said good - bye , and pinned her hat on to her bright hair . At the door she turned to say : “
8835	8853	8866	8866	she	332	” And she was gone . Chloe turned to me with wide - open , sparkling eyes . “
8899	8900	8901	8901	She	332	” “
8904	8908	8901	8901	She	332	” I admitted , “
8931	8932	8926	8926	she	332	” “
8937	8941	8926	8926	she	332	” said Chloe . “
9002	9003	8993	8994	the men	303	” “
9010	9014	8993	8994	the men	303	” I said . “
9021	9050	8993	8994	the men	303	” Our fat - faced maid - servant , who had rigidly refused during the whole morning to assist us in the least , on the ground that she “
9058	9081	8993	8994	the men	303	” now descended the stairs , bearing her whole wardrobe in two brown - paper parcels and a tin hat - box . “
9087	9095	9096	9096	You	337	” said Chloe , to our remover . “
9110	9111	9112	9112	I	0	” “
9118	9125	9112	9112	I	0	” said the man , hoarsely , “
9144	9145	9142	9142	Bill	56	” “
9152	9157	9150	9150	Charley	57	” was the response . “
9166	9211	9158	9158	We	340	” said Chloe , and Charley seemed at once to form the lowest opinion of us . He was a thick - set ruffian with a red and angry eye . He was one of the four helpers engaged by the green - grocer to “
9213	9325	9150	9150	Charley	57	” us . His clothes and those of his friends smelled strange and stuffy , as though they had been smeared with putty and mutton fat , and locked away for years in a cupboard full of pickled onions and yellow soap and mice . The clothes of the unskilled laborer always have this strange scent . It lingers about everything they touch in passing through a house , and after days its freshness is still unimpaired . But I never knew any scent so overpowering as that which clung to the clothes of Charley and his mates . They strayed loudly up the uncarpeted stairs , urgent in their insistence on “
9330	9344	9150	9150	Charley	57	” and Chloe would have followed them , but Harriet came forward with , “
9359	9360	9351	9351	I	0	” “
9363	9364	9351	9351	I	0	” “
9403	9404	9379	9379	Mother	58	” “
9413	9419	9420	9420	Mother	58	” said Chloe , cheerfully . “
9428	9432	9434	9434	she	58	” resumed Harriet , “
9449	9450	9434	9434	she	58	” “
9469	9522	9454	9454	you	346	” said Chloe , with dignity . But when the fat - faced traitress had stumped away down the little passage , Chloe dragged me into the dismantled dining - room and flung her arms round my neck . This was not , I knew , affection . It was merely despair . “
9528	9539	9523	9523	She	348	” said my wife , with tears in her voice . “
9594	9595	9596	9596	I	0	” “
9617	9621	9622	9622	She	348	” I cried . “
9655	9656	9646	9647	another girl	351	” “
9664	9668	9657	9657	We	344	” said she . “
9691	9712	9681	9681	I	0	” It was only our best looking - glass , the same in which I had rebelliously dared to shave . “
9716	9720	9681	9681	I	0	” I said . “
9742	9797	9657	9657	We	344	” It was almost our only one . Reckless as a herd of pigs in mid - flight , yet slow as an army of lame snails , Charley and his confederates packed our Bandboxful of furniture into the dark van that smelled of matting and straw and quarter - day . They broke an “
9799	9936	9940	9940	you	353	” table , and the door of the corner cupboard , and they smashed on the door - step the great jar of pickled walnuts which my mother - in - law had told me would last us a year . But it was Harriet who , sulkily obeying my order to make herself useful , went to the top of the house to fetch two highly colored texts from the walls of her bed - room , and , returning , fell over the best toilet set , smashing the jug and the soap - dish lid ! It was rather a nice set , too , dark green , that Yolande had brought from Italy , and , by us , here , totally irreplaceable . I sent Harriet into the back kitchen then . “
9950	9959	9940	9940	you	353	” I said . When the last of our “
9961	10071	10143	10143	you	355	” had been dragged from the house , and the van had been half unpacked to recover my coat and hat , zealously hidden under the dining - room table in the van 's centre , and when the forlorn party of chairs and bookcases had been removed from the pavement and once more envanned , we added Harriet , speechless with sulky displeasure , to the van - load ; and as we watched them drive off , my heart , at least , was lighter . We set up our bicycles ready , and blew up the tires . Then we went all over the little house , “
10080	10111	10143	10143	you	355	” my wife said . Her face was quite sad now . It was in that horrid little dressing - room that she slipped her hand into mine and said : “
10160	10203	10158	10158	you	355	” A narrator can not be expected to chronicle all his replies . My answer satisfied Chloe , anyhow , and she consented to dry her eyes on my handkerchief . Then we took a last look round , and went out . “
10208	10222	10158	10158	you	355	” we said to our Bandbox , and wished it a happy future . “
10238	10242	10225	10231	the next people who live in you	359	” said Chloe , “
10261	10390	10225	10231	the next people who live in you	359	” We rode away , turning at the corner for one more last look at our Bandbox . Its bare windows blinked forlornly at us in the June sunlight like the eyes of a deserted orphan . We rode on in silence . We passed our furniture about half a mile from the Bandbox . And we had been keeping our tempers for more than two hours in the spacious emptiness of the Red House before the rattle of harness and the scent of Charley 's coat announced the arrival of the van . Charley and his minions made a hollow pretence of putting the furniture in its place . They did put the bedsteads together , insecurely , and in the wrong rooms ; and they set up “
10394	10539	10225	10231	the next people who live in you	359	” against walls . The oak chests they carried to the attic , and the best steel fire - irons were discovered , weeks later , in the cellar . But almost everything — saucepans , crockery , coal - scuttles , books , hearth - rugs , stair - rods , fenders — was dumped on the floors of the hall , the kitchen , and the dining - room . I remember that I had to move half a ton of mixed valuables to find the tea - kettle , when , after two hours of breathless energy , we heard the van 's retreating wheels , and were moved towards the kitchen by one common longing — for tea . Chloe got the tea , and I cleared it away . Harriet reluctantly consented to wash up the tea - things . “
10542	10557	10225	10231	the next people who live in you	359	” she added , and it really was like a blow in the wind , “
10603	10614	10615	10615	Mother	58	” In vain we besought her to reconsider this decision . “
10732	10733	10724	10724	I	0	” “
10739	11085	10696	10696	she	0	” said Chloe . And then we both began to laugh . That saved the situation , besides making Harriet uncomfortable . We let her go , because we could not help it , and we set out our supper — it was tinned salmon and bread — on a sheet of newspaper , because we could n't find any table - cloths . And we washed our hands with mottled soap , because the brown Windsor soap had hidden itself away somewhere . And we dried them on Chloe 's apron , because the towels were mislaid . And we made some cocoa , because the ginger - ale could not , at the moment , be found . It never was found , by - the - way . The search for lamps being fruitless , we walked together to the village in the cool , pale evening , and , returning with a pound of candles in a blue paper , it seemed natural to wander round the shadowy gardens , slowly wrapping themselves in the blue veil of the summer night . The stars came out , one by one , and a little moon that had been like a cloudy ghost through the gold of the afternoon seemed to wash her face with liquid light , and set to work shining in bright earnest . The house seemed very chill , very dark , very silent , as we let ourselves in . The most energetic search and half a box of wax vestas failed to find us a single candlestick . How we regretted , then , the empty bottles left behind at the Bandbox ! At last we set up our candles by melting the ends and sticking them in tea - saucers . Then I broke up a packing - case and made a fire in our room . By a fortunate accident , Chloe , looking for her brush and comb , found the blankets . We went round the house and closed all the shutters . “
11088	11094	10696	10696	she	0	” said Chloe , cheerfully , “
11101	11123	10696	10696	she	0	” I looked round on the unspeakable confusion — the whole Bandboxful of our effects emptied out , as it were , “
11129	11138	10696	10696	she	0	” upon the floor , and I said , “
11141	11254	10696	10696	she	0	” The birds woke us in the morning ; such an orchestra as I had never even imagined . Sleep seemed fled forever . It was I who went down to light the fire for breakfast . It was good to fling back the shutters and window - sashes , and to lean out through the drifted net of green jasmine leaves and taste the fresh sweets of the morning . Presently Chloe came and leaned beside me . The whole world seemed blue and green and gold ; the trees and the grass sparkling in the dewy sunshine , and on the bright turf the long , black , tree shadows . “
11262	11266	10696	10696	she	0	” Chloe breathed ; “
11291	11325	11279	11282	no one next door	204	” The birds sang , the sun shone softly , the swan in the moat spread wide wings , preening his white feathers . A purple haze covered the hills . It was indeed “
11329	11345	11279	11282	no one next door	204	” The wood began to crackle . I looked at my watch . Five o'clock . “
11357	11361	11279	11282	no one next door	204	” Chloe said . “
11385	11454	11374	11383	the poor silly people who only get up at eight	374	” I thought of them , and I knew that very soon we should once more be numbered among that pitiable band . But I said nothing . We cleared away the breakfast and made our room tidy , and every now and then she would stop to clap her hands — once there were two flat - irons and a duster in them — and to say : “
11478	11526	11374	11383	the poor silly people who only get up at eight	374	” We arranged a scheme of disentanglement , and applied it to our goods . Chloe dived into the mass and came up with treasures , which under her directions I bore to the situations she indicated . But many things seemed homeless , and the command , “
11542	11726	11529	11529	I	0	” grew so frequent that the kitchen - table groaned beneath its load , and even the tall dressers showed signs of repletion . But we got one room clear — the white parlor , Chloe called it . It was really half panelled in oak — painted , of course , by some vandal middle - Victorian hand — but still charming , with its carved garlands and flourishes , its high mantelpiece and odd corners . We swept it ; we put down our best carpet and hearth - rug ; we brought in our oak gate - table and our polished beechwood chairs with the rush seats , and the corner cupboard , and the little bow - legged oak sideboard ; we put some green Flemish pots on the mantel - piece . Chloe ran out and came back with half a dozen late tulips , and when she had set them on the table in a jar of Chinese willow - pattern ( hand - work , none of your transfers ) , why , then we had a “
11730	11748	11529	11529	I	0	” a refuge , as Chloe said . We also carted the remaining chaos into the kitchen . “
11755	11759	11750	11750	I	0	” she said ; “
11769	11925	11760	11760	we	375	” So pictures and curtains , and all the things that take time to their fixing , were carried away . And the swept hall looked large and beautiful , especially when we had cleaned the red and white of the marble inlaid floor with a wet broom and a pail of water . As I rubbed the broom vigorously over a discolored square of the marble , I was suddenly conscious of a guilty feeling . Analyzed , the sensation frightened me . I was becoming interested in these details . And I had not once thought about my work , though to - morrow was the day for my article in the Weekly Wilderness . It had never even entered my head to dream that I could ever be interested in cleaning a floor . Yet here I was calling joyously to Chloe , deep in a packing - case in the kitchen : “
11936	11937	11760	11760	we	375	” “
11947	11951	11760	11760	we	375	” she said , “
11986	11997	11998	11998	My	0	” I carried my pail and broom into the kitchen . “
12001	12005	11998	11998	My	0	” I said , “
12014	12015	12007	12007	you	173	” “
12018	12022	12007	12007	you	173	” she asked . “
12037	12311	12024	12024	you	376	” The very thought appalled me , and the fact that it did so appalled me still more deeply . I pointed out that a shaving - brush is useful for other purposes than for putting down on things , and presently we found it involved in a pair of lace curtains . We had lunch in the garden . And then Yolande 's furniture suddenly loomed at our gates . We had wholly forgotten it . The white parlor had to be reorganized to accommodate her oak settle . The piano we boldly ordered into the drawing - room , where it lived out long days of lonely grandeur . Her furniture was really charming — Chippendale chairs and a Sheraton bureau , pictures by the dozen and lovely crocks by the score . The men who moved her things had linen jackets , and they were not scented like Charley . They actually put things where we wanted them . We stood by in humble amazement . But when they asked where they should hang the pictures , we looked at each other , almost speechless with wonder and gratitude . They hung the pictures , they asked for a broom , and , if ours had not been wet , they would have swept up the dust their careful feet had not been able to help bringing in . They dusted the furniture ture , and asked if there was anything else they could do . I said there was not , and felt in my pocket for silver , far more than I could afford . But Chloe said : “
12343	12368	12340	12340	you	378	” They saw . They promised all things ; they took my silver and went . And that very evening a trim young woman came “
12373	12451	12340	12340	you	378	” accepted it , went off to fetch her box , and never returned . Perhaps she saw the ghost as she went out . We never knew . Next day I sat down with my type - writer in the parlor . Chloe went to London to ransack the registry - offices , so that there was no one to do house - work . Therefore , when I had done my article — it was on “
12457	12674	12675	12675	We	384	” I remember — I tidied the place up a little . Happening to find the black - leading apparatus in the bread - pan , I tried my hand at polishing the parlor - grate . It is much less easy than one would suppose , and I barked my knuckles against the bars . Then I cleaned some windows . I knew , from Cranford , that this was done with newspapers . The middles of the panes were easy , the corners inaccessible and irritating . Then I got tea ready and filled the lamps . I experienced all the sensations of an explorer in an unknown and ravishing country . All this was new and extraordinarily fascinating . I chopped wood and filled a box with it , ready for the morning . I also chopped my finger , and decided that I had done enough house - work for the moment . Then I remembered my article . I had forgotten to post it , and the post was gone when I got to the village . I had to walk to Blackheath to catch the late mail — four miles there and back . When I got home Chloe was sitting on the door - step with a perfect stranger . “
12681	12685	12675	12675	We	384	” she said . “
12706	12896	12698	12698	she	59	” I could see in Ellen 's eye that she was not so sure of this . When Ellen saw the kitchen , with its indescribable complications of domestic matter , she blenched , and I knew the worst . We all turned to , however , and tidied the kitchen superfically , arranged Ellen 's bedroom , assisted her to prepare supper , went to bed worn out , and came down in the morning to find Ellen gone . She was not wholly bad ; she had some kind impulses . She had lighted the fire and put on the kettle before leaving . But we were a little late that morning , and all the water had boiled away . When I filled the kettle at the tap it cracked , and Chloe said it was always the way , and snatched the kettle out of my hand , and boiled the water for tea in a saucepan that had had cabbage in it . So , after breakfast , I insisted on a turn in the quiet , sunny garden , and she grew calmer . “
12907	12911	12698	12698	she	59	” she said . “
12914	12918	12698	12698	she	59	” I owned , “
12941	12954	12931	12931	I	0	” She was stricken with remorse . I followed up my advantage . “
13052	13070	13071	13071	I	0	” For she was crying — with her head on my shoulder and my arms round her . “
13076	13082	13085	13085	you	387	” she said , presently . “
13278	13638	13260	13260	I	0	” We did all these things , and gradually some sort of order evolved itself from chaos , and the scent of Charley 's coat faded slowly away . Then we had a rapid succession of unsuitable servants ; five , I think , were honest , the sixth went off with all Chloe 's lace petticoats and her mink cape . Then we got a woman from the village to come in by the day . She worked fairly well , but she carried a covered basket , and it cost us too much in tea and butter . All this time we had never had a moment for gardening , and Chloe 's dream of growing our own vegetables was being swiftly hidden by the weeds of oblivion . There were flowers in plenty , though , now . Hundreds of roses , red and white and yellow . Thousands of pink roses . Canterbury - bells , red daisy - flowers , lupins , columbines , and giant larkspurs . Chloe kept the house a flowery bower . I cleaned the boots and the knives , and whistled at my work . It was when half the neck of mutton got into that covered basket and , ostrich - like , left its tail sticking out , that I told Mrs. Coombe that we must part . She asked for no explanation ; I gave none . We parted without unnecessary words . That day it began to rain — a thunder - storm first , then slow , steady , pelting rain for hours and hours . We sat over the kitchen fire that evening and told ghost stories till I saw my wife beginning to cast glances over her shoulder to where the darker shadows lurked in the corners of the great , black - raftered kitchen . Then I lit twelve candles , set then on the mantel - piece , and made port - wine negus , and we drank it and went to bed . In the pitch - dark middle of the night , Chloe caught me by the arm . “
13644	13653	13639	13639	You	402	” she said , in a terrified whisper ; “
13682	13686	13678	13678	you	0	” I listened . “
13708	13718	13693	13693	Len	47	” She held me very tight with both hands . “
13772	13820	13867	13869	a darling idiot	409	” I listened . And it was . I HAD held my breath to listen to the drip , drip — loud in itself and hollow in its echo through the grisly silence of the middle night . Now I let my breath go in a sigh . “
13827	13831	13867	13869	a darling idiot	409	” said Chloe . “
13837	13841	13867	13869	a darling idiot	409	” I said ; “
13871	13872	13867	13869	a darling idiot	409	” “
13884	13889	13893	13893	you	0	” Her teeth chattered . “
13896	13902	13893	13893	you	0	” I said , cheerfully . “
13929	13964	13921	13921	me	0	” I had always resolved that in no straits would I ever , barefooted , face a burglar . Think of the horrible advantage of hobnailed burglar - boots over shrinking , bare toes . “
13973	13977	13978	13978	You	411	” Chloe said . “
14003	14042	14043	14043	I	0	” One of the ugliest of our wedding presents , the umbrella with the rock - amethyst handle the size of a fives - ball , stood in the wardrobe corner . I balanced it in my hand . “
14055	14057	14043	14043	I	0	” said I—“even
14068	14069	14043	14043	I	0	” “
14074	14087	14072	14072	you	411	” said Chloe . She was creeping into her dressing - gown . “
14097	14098	14092	14092	I'll	0	” “
14106	14107	14109	14109	you	411	” “
14119	14120	14109	14109	you	411	” “
14128	14129	14125	14126	a burglar	1838	” “
14132	14133	14125	14126	a burglar	1838	” “
14145	14146	14136	14136	you	411	” “
14152	14154	14136	14136	you	411	” she said—“only
14159	14170	14136	14136	you	411	” I blew out the candle and took her hand . “
14188	14191	14180	14180	we	416	” said I. “
14196	14259	14180	14180	we	416	” We opened the door slowly and softly , and very softly and slowly crept along the dark passage hand in hand . At the stair - foot we stood still and listened . Not a sound but the drip - drip - dripping . It seemed to come from the white parlor . My wife clutched my hand in both hers . “
14264	14291	14260	14260	I	0	” she whispered , and struck a match . Her hands trembled so that she could hardly light the candle . I took it from her . “
14298	14355	14356	14356	Len	47	” I said . But we went on . I flung open the door of the white parlor , while Chloe stood with her back to the wall , hiding her face in her hands . I took two steps into the darkness . Then I laughed aloud and put down the candle on the table . “
14368	14369	14356	14356	Len	47	” “
14377	14381	14375	14375	dear	418	” I said , “
14391	14436	14386	14386	I	0	” I put it up as I spoke , and , catching Chloe 's hand , drew her under it . The drops splashed on the umbrella heavily from the ceiling above . Chloe and I looked in each other 's eyes and laughed . “
14455	14456	14356	14356	Len	47	” “
14461	14496	14356	14356	Len	47	” said I. The floor was an inch deep in water , and from the ceiling it was falling , in heavy , capricious showers , on furniture , books , cushions , curtains . “
14503	14515	14497	14497	You	418	” I asked , shutting the wet umbrella with a flap . “
14518	14519	14497	14497	You	418	” “
14533	14678	14679	14679	I	0	” We dressed hastily and lit the candles in the tall , old brass candlesticks on the white - parlor mantel - piece . It took us some little time to find places , where these could stand without prompt extinguishment from the dripping ceiling . Then , barefooted both , with my trousers tucked up , and Chloe 's skirts kilted to the knee , we did our best with pails and mops and house flannels . We carried all our books out into the hall , and stood them up on their edges , with their leaves open , to dry . We carried out our furniture - the settle , and the gate - table , and the rush - bottomed beechwood chairs . We took down the wet curtains and hung them on the bacon - rack in the kitchen . “
14687	14694	14679	14679	I	0	” said Chloe , in parenthesis . “
14711	14771	14679	14679	I	0	” It was a night 's work . When the gray of the dawn showed us , through rain - wrinkled window - panes , the green tangle of our garden , all beaten down to one dripping desolation , with a gray sky above , and over all the rain , I looked at my wife and said : “
14832	14906	14826	14826	I	0	” She had caught at the rope of bright hair that hung below her waist , and was wringing the water out of it . Her bare feet were pink and rosy in the mixed radiance of dawn and candlelight . Her striped red - and - white skirts gave her a sort of coquettish smartness , as of a Parisienne at Trouville . She held out her hand with a dramatic gesture . “
14912	14916	14826	14826	I	0	” she said ; “
14929	14979	14826	14826	I	0	” She led me through the kitchen to the little room where we worked . A fire burned red and glowing ; on her drawing - table , white damask covered , were bread , butter , tea - things . The brass kettle sang softly on the hob . “
14987	14990	14991	14991	You	423	” said I. “
15012	15013	15004	15004	you	423	” “
15021	15025	15026	15026	I	0	” said Chloe . “
15073	15074	15075	15075	You	423	” “
15080	15084	15077	15078	an angel	184	” I said . “
15091	15092	15085	15085	I	0	” “
15118	15122	15109	15109	you	421	” said she . “
15126	15143	15109	15109	you	421	” said I , holding her in one arm and making the tea with the other . “
15195	15196	15189	15189	I	0	” “
15204	15205	15198	15198	you	423	” “
15222	15223	15220	15220	Skurry	61	” “
15232	15236	15220	15220	Skurry	61	” she said . “
15244	15245	15238	15238	you	421	” “
15295	15333	15334	15334	Len	47	” It was rather a pleasant breakfast , though the drip , drip , drip went on merrily all the time . When the last sandwich had vanished Chloe put her elbows on the table and said : “
15370	15371	15381	15381	I	0	” “
15375	15379	15381	15381	I	0	” said I , “
15429	15538	15539	15539	Chloe	45	” I helped her into her mackintosh , and we went . The roof of the white parlor is one of the leaded spaces on the wings of the Red House . It has a parapet at back and front . These formed a sort of tank ; all the waste - pipes were stuffed up with leaves and twigs , and I pulled a black , sodden starlings ' nest out of one of them . The rain came down pitilessly . I looked about me . I knew that , below , the flood in the white parlor must be momently gaining in depth and intensity . “
15541	15545	15539	15539	Chloe	45	” I said , “
15576	15671	15567	15567	I	0	” I found it , after some search , in the pantry . I had taken it there myself , I remember , in the avowed belief that it , and it only , could serve to break into the first gooseberry pie of Chloe 's making . I brought it up onto the roof , and with it smashed away the bricks and cement till I had a two - foot embrasure in the back parapet . Then I paused . A moment 's silence full of concentrated reflection broke as I said , “
15690	15774	15780	15780	beloved	435	” Then we went to find the spade . With it we dug clay from the banks of one of the little streams which feed our moat . I transported it in the wheelbarrow , always through the rain , to the scene of action , and we raised it to the roof by a cord and the waste - paper basket . With it I built a dam round my embrasure . Then again I paused in Napoleonic meditation , and then — “
15782	15844	15780	15780	beloved	435	” I said , looking down on my wife 's pink , rain - wet face . Then I knocked over the last three inches at the bottom of my embrasure . The water from within my dam rushed out down the face of the house — behind the dam lay the tank of water , but my dam held firm . “
15879	16313	16314	16314	Chloe	45	” I spliced the dust - pan 's handle at right angles gles to the handle of the rake , and laid this last across the embrasure . The parapet held its ends securely , and the dust - pan , face downward , projected itself out through the opening . I made all fast with clay and then called Chloe to come up the step - ladder and share with me the triumphant moment when my dam should be broken down and my new dust - pan - cum - rake water - shoot come into play . One 's wife should share one 's joys as well as one 's sorrows , I said . The ingenious contrivance , which I thrilled to have found myself capable of devising , acted perfectly . I kicked my dam to pieces , and the imprisoned water behind rushed impetuously through the embrasure , and , directed by the trusty dust - pan , fell in a cataract a yard and a half from the house , to meander away harmlessly along the gravel path . I helped the flowing tide with the bass - broom , and all the while the rain splashed and spun and sputtered on mackintosh and bared heads . When the leads held but half an inch of water I strengthened the dust - pan and rake with clay , and we went indoors . The white parlor was unspeakably wet — but the water no longer dripped from the roof . We mopped again , dried and dressed , and did our ordinary house - work . Then the sun came out . We took cushions and rugs onto the balcony , and fell asleep . We slept till late in the afternoon . Then I went to fetch a plumber . He came , many days later , cleared the wastepipes , and sent me in a bill for £ 2 17s . 7d . This was the first charge on the legacy we had received from my uncle . The second was made by the inspector of the water company . He compelled us to put in new patent taps all over the house . This cost £ 7 9s . 3d . ; and when a grand - maternal government came down on us about the question of sinks and overflow - pipes — Chloe , in my absence , had the misfortune to cringe before its minion — the matter ended in a bill of £ 29 19s . 11d . Then I said : “
16330	16331	16314	16314	Chloe	45	” “
16337	16341	16314	16314	Chloe	45	” she interrupted , “

16367	16371	16314	16314	Chloe	45	” I quoted . “
16383	16387	16440	16440	I	0	” she said . “
16412	16413	16414	16414	We	437	” “

16443	16448	16440	16440	I	0	” she said again . “
16463	16480	16461	16461	you	47	” Remorselessly I pursued my advantage , for Chloe seemed to be in a yielding mood . “
16485	16508	16461	16461	you	47	” I began , but she caught me by the shoulders and shook me and took the words out of my mouth . “
16513	16517	16518	16518	I	0	” she said , “
16625	16626	16629	16629	you	47	” “
16638	16644	16629	16629	you	47	” She hesitated , then : “
16647	16653	16629	16629	you	47	” she cried , defiantly , “
16683	16684	16685	16685	My	0	” “
16732	16733	16754	16754	Chloe	45	” “
16742	16751	16752	16752	Chloe	45	” she said , with a mutinous glance . “
16756	16760	16754	16754	Chloe	45	” I said , “
16881	16894	16859	16859	you	45	” She hung her head and said I was just as bad . “
16990	16991	16992	16992	You	45	” “

17068	17072	17051	17051	models	467	” I said . “

17103	17109	17094	17094	I	0	” she said , dreamily . “

17163	17166	17160	17160	your	45	” said I. “
17173	17174	17160	17160	your	45	” “
17177	17181	17160	17160	your	45	” I answered , “
17202	17203	17200	17200	they	470	” “
17210	17211	17205	17205	you	45	” “
17294	18078	17282	17282	Chloe	45	” The hat was all right , but the coat was full of creases . It was not in the dresser drawer , after all , but on the bottom shelf of the oak side - board , and I had to iron it before I could dream of putting it on . Chloe told me how to do it , but she owned that I did it far better than she could have done it herself . My best boots were mislaid , too , as it happened , and , before I had discovered them in a corner of the bare drawing - room , I had missed the 11.32 . I went up by the 12.40 , however , and in the train I wondered to myself how it was that Chloe , who in the Bandbox had kept all in so neat an array , was now growing more untidy than I in my most reckless moods had ever been . It was a problem , and I bent myself to it as the train whirled me through green pastures outlined with elm - trees and hawthorn hedges , then through villas , red and self - consciously trim , with their neat gardens , geranium - flushed , calceolaria - gilded — neat as a prize map at a first - class high - school . The problem did not resolve itself . It was not till the train was rushing through a wilderness of yellow brick houses , all alike , all soot - begrimed , all standing , with their bits of blackened garden , their stunted flowers , their carefully trained snippets of creeper , for lives full of the courageous struggle of man 's innate love of beauty against the iron of environment , the crippling of the accident of birth , the handicap of hereditary submission to the undeserved darkening of life , that I began to see the answer to my question . In our first home — the Bandbox , the little nest that had held us at our first mating — Chloe had struggled to reproduce , and had reproduced , on a microscopic scale , and with the aid of a woman servant more or less tractable , the habits and methods learned in her mother 's house in Bedford . There were rules , and she followed them . I for my part had met the new rules as part of a new and delightful comedy , wherein my wife was heroine . At the same time I had felt no urgent need for altering the habits of years spent in chambers , at the mercy of an uncomplaining and systematically dishonest laundress . But when the Bandbox — I paid it the tribute of a perfunctory sigh , even in my railway - carriage solitude — when the dear Bandbox was left behind , and we entered the Red House , we entered , too , on a new life — a primitive existence where law was not . The rules Chloe had learned in Bedford as to the duties of servants and the routine of domestic life were now inapplicable , since we had no servant , and consequently no recognized routine . We were in the position of folk cast upon a desert island ( I mean an uninhabited one , but the phraseology , as the instinct , of boyhood survives ) . And here we had suddenly changed parts . The chart of custom by which Chloe had steered in Bandbox days had been reft from her . She had nothing left but delightful , genuine impulses towards beauty — the arrangement of flowers , the fixing of shelves , and the deep , eternal instinct to satisfy the cravings of hunger in herself and hers — me . I , on the other hand , being face to face with a new problem , met it , man fashion , with a new solution . I perceived that order alone could make our life in the Red House possible . As the train steamed over the bridge one practical conclusion came as the result of my meditations . Chloe must have a servant . I saw several editors , received a commission to write a series of articles on foreign politics , and a short story of strong domestic interest . Then I stood at the corner by the Mansion House in a meditation so deep as to provoke the amused and contemptuous scrutiny of my fellows , and at last , just as a small boy was murmuring at my elbow , “
18109	18185	18097	18097	your	476	” I hailed a ' bus and was borne away by it . I went straight to Mrs. May 's registry - office in Tottenham Court Road . The ladies who attended to my needs seemed to me to have the most perfect manners in the world . So well did they act for me that in half an hour I had engaged an amiable general servant , who was to come on the next Monday “
18190	18191	18097	18097	your	476	” “
18196	18202	18203	18203	you	479	” I said to her , “
18234	18237	18245	18246	Your mistress	485	house”—her plump face fell—“but
18276	18278	18279	18281	no young men	487	evening”—her face brightened—“but
18323	18405	18318	18318	you	479	” I could see the smile Mrs. May was trying to conceal , and I felt a tremor of doubt . Perhaps , after all , it did not do to treat servants as though they were of the same flesh and blood as one 's self . The girl hesitated , looked doubtfully at me , I smiled at her in my best manner , and she smiled back heartily , and as it seemed to me without mental reservations . “
18410	18414	18318	18318	you	479	” she said , “
18420	18442	18318	18318	you	479	” So that was settled . I felt the warm point of triumph which punctuates the career of the born organizer . “
18447	18451	18318	18318	you	479	” said I ; “
18460	18661	18457	18458	Carter Paterson	64	” And with that I left well alone , and went back to Cannon Street via the Twopenny Tube . I had to wait half an hour for a train . On the platform was the usual dingy , mixed crowd of clerks , type - writing girls , art students , and City men , and among them , her red hair shining at me down the length of the gloomy platform , a woman 's figure that I knew . Her dainty dress of muslin , sown with little bunches of violets , her charming hat , her perfect gloves and shoes — these alone might not have thrust her identity on me . Thank Heaven , more than one Englishwoman wears pretty muslin gowns and picture - hats , and has gloves and shoes that fit her . It was the set of her shoulders , the poise of her head , the modest , graceful self - possession of her attitude that made me bold to step behind her , and , without even a sight of her face , to murmur over her shoulder and into the prettiest ear — almost — in the world , “
18664	18691	18457	18458	Carter Paterson	64	” She turned in a flash , and her face came to me in that dull place like a gleam of sunlight in a cloudy day . “
18697	18701	18694	18694	you	490	” I said , “
18718	18719	18720	18720	I	0	” “

18850	18864	18865	18865	Yolande	52	” My prophecy was fulfilled . My wife opened the door to us . “
18867	18871	18865	18865	Yolande	52	” she cried , “
18880	18881	18872	18872	I	0	” “
18890	18894	18895	18895	Chloe	45	” said Yolande . “
18897	18905	18907	18907	you	45	” I cried , with proper severity , “
18924	18951	18918	18918	Your	45	” She looked at me with that disarming blink of soft lashes for the sake of which the harshest of recording angels would risk his situation . “
18960	18962	18952	18952	I	0	” she said—“it
18997	18998	18993	18993	you	52	” “
19003	19007	19001	19001	Beatrice	66	” I said ; “
19023	19024	19001	19001	Beatrice	66	” “
19034	19035	19001	19001	Beatrice	66	” “
19045	19053	19039	19039	your	66	” I returned , capping the quotation . “
19061	19089	19039	19039	your	66	” she cried , the action rhyming with the word , and fled . She came down to tea all white muslin and lace and pink ribbons . “
19096	19102	19103	19103	I	0	” she said . deprecatingly . “
19125	19327	19328	19328	Madam	169	” Throughout tea I could look at nothing else . Yolande is a witch . How else could she have known that in these weeks of happy , hard work I had vaguely missed something , somehow , and had never guessed till now that it was my wife 's beauty , so unadorned , and still so dear , that had fretted me with the unconscious desire to see it once more fitly clothed ? The evening was a festival . Yolande played Chopin to us in the dim , empty drawing - room , and if I did hold my wife 's hand the while , Yolande did not mind , for she was used to us . Chloe showed us the duchess and footman drawing , and indeed the duchess 's arm was hopelessly wrong , and the footman 's legs things to weep over . We drank ginger - ale , always with us the outward expression of hilarity , and , as the evening waned , sang comic songs . When Yolande had gone to bed , in the room got ready for the servants who never came , I caught my wife by both hands . “
19330	19334	19328	19328	Madam	169	” said I , “
19349	19350	19337	19337	you	169	” “
19360	19364	19351	19351	I	0	” she said ; “
19374	19375	19370	19370	Yolande	52	” “
19381	19385	19370	19370	Yolande	52	” said I , “
19393	19399	19400	19400	You	0	” Chloe looked at me . “
19403	19407	19400	19400	You	0	” she said . “
19438	19439	19435	19435	me	0	” “
19474	19475	19465	19465	you	0	” “
19481	19485	19486	19486	You	0	” said she . “
19524	19525	19514	19514	she	52	” “
19531	19532	19528	19528	you	0	” “
19564	19568	19570	19570	Len	47	” She paused , then—“And
19572	19576	19570	19570	Len	47	” she said , “
19606	19607	19609	19609	you	0	” “
19614	19626	19609	19609	you	0	” I said , with my face against the pink ribbons , “
19686	19699	19700	19700	Len	47	” She pushed me away till she could look in my eyes . “
19702	19706	19700	19700	Len	47	” she said , “
19745	19746	19735	19735	You	47	” “
19751	19755	19735	19735	You	47	” I said , “
19783	19930	19780	19780	I	0	” Now what made me talk that nonsense ? And suppose Chloe had laughed at it or , on the other hand , had taken it seriously , where should we have been ? Now , Heaven be praised for the gift of understanding . If Chloe had done , had looked , anything but what she did do and look — But Chloe is Chloe , and , thank God , mine . Yolande stayed with us three days . The rainbow delights of our new house seemed newly dyed when we displayed them to her appreciative eyes . And I felt a new impulse to work , now that Chloe had some one to bear her company as she gathered flowers , rearranged furniture , or struggled , face all aglow , against the fiendish arts of the kitchen range . I wrote half my “
19937	20160	19780	19780	I	0	” and then stuck fast . There was a scene where the hero , on the point of marriage with a respectable and admired heiress , the friend of childhood 's hour , sees , as he walks up the church to his bridal , the face of his old love , whom he had thought dead . This scene wanted something besides smartness . It wanted fire , passion , delicacy of handling , strength of grasp . And these qualities , strange to say , eluded me . I told my woes , and received from Chloe and Yolande sympathy , but no aid . On that third moonlight evening , when we sat out on the grass , round the sun - dial , and Yolande sang Spanish and Pyrenean songs to the tinkle of Chloe 's guitar , I almost seemed to surprise in myself the force to grapple with that scene and get the better of it ; but when they had gone to bed and I sat face to face with my type - writer , the force shrivelled to a very agony of conscious incompetence . I wrote three abject sentences , and went to bed hopeless . Next morning I took Yolande to a cricket match , and in the evening she left us . “
20174	20178	20169	20169	you	514	” she said , “
20220	20365	20366	20366	Chloe	45	” We went up to the little country station , bareheaded , ungloved , to the scandal of the porters and the station - master , and waved our farewells as the train bore her away . Chloe 's clean handkerchief had a great hole in it , which she never noticed till too late , and then we went back , she to house - work , and I to my story . I had left it at page thirty - one ; it stood now at page fifty - nine . The story was finished . I read the pages rapidly . The story was good , very good . All the fire and passion and force I had longed for and had known to be necessary were here . The story began tamely , and ended in vivid and triumphant drama . “
20368	20388	20366	20366	Chloe	45	” I called . She came , a dish - cloth in her hand and apron round her waist . “
20399	20405	20389	20390	Some one	404	” She read it slowly . “
20410	20414	20389	20390	Some one	404	” she asked . “
20428	20429	20422	20422	you	45	” “
20434	20435	20432	20432	you	45	” “
20442	20443	20432	20432	you	45	” “
20451	20471	20432	20432	you	45	” she said . Then she blinked at me with long lashes , and laughed . I laughed too . “
20477	20495	20432	20432	you	45	” I said , but I read in her laughing eyes the word that sprang to my own lips—“Yolande
20497	20600	20432	20432	you	45	” OF course we have our own little stereotyped code of honor and morality , laid by on the shelf , ready for use , and in it we read vaguely that one may not put one 's name to another 's work , or make money by another 's success . Had any one offered to finish for me the story to which I should put my name , I had refused , though the offer had been made by Rudyard Kipling himself . But when a ghost finishes your story , what 's to be done ? As Chloe said , “
20610	20666	20604	20605	the ghost	518	” She added that of course I must send it in . And indeed it seemed to me that the matter was at least arguable . Yet I could not bring myself to sign my name to the thing . Chloe made horseshoes in her forehead , and professed herself unable to understand my hesitation . “
20678	20682	20683	20683	you	519	” she said , “
20695	20696	20683	20683	you	519	” “
20701	20702	20683	20683	you	519	” “
20765	20779	20854	20855	the governor	524	” I bit the end of my fountain - pen till it cracked . “
20785	20852	20853	20853	You	523	” said I. Chloe laughed . And I wrote to Yolande that evening . Chloe wrote , too — about a pattern for a fichu , I believe — and we posted the letters in the village . When we came home we found an unattractive working - man slouching by our gate . As we approached , he touched his hat with a grudging gesture . “
20857	20867	20854	20855	the governor	524	” he inquired . I ventured a modest assent . “
20878	20882	20884	20884	you	523	” said he , “
20896	20897	20884	20884	you	523	” “
20902	20919	20884	20884	you	523	” said I , truthful in defiance of Chloe 's finger - pressure on my arm . “
20925	20936	20922	20922	you	523	” said my visitor , rubbing a stubbly chin reflectively , “
20976	21000	20968	20968	I	0	” My tenant - aspirant inspired me with little admiration and less confidence , but Chloe pinched my arm again , and said , “
21006	21007	21002	21002	you	523	” “
21019	21023	21017	21017	miss	533	” said he . “
21043	21044	21032	21032	we	528	” “
21056	21063	21032	21032	we	528	” said the man , eagerly , “
21089	21090	21086	21086	she	536	” “
21097	21120	21086	21086	she	536	” said I , severely non - committal , and feigning insensibility as Chloe 's fingers tightened almost painfully on my arm . “
21129	21136	21124	21124	you	0	” she asked . At the word “
21138	21154	21086	21086	she	536	” a shadow of a grin passed under the reflective hand that stroked the stubble . “
21168	21173	21162	21162	we	528	” was the answer . “
21181	21186	21162	21162	we	528	” said my wife . “
21205	21206	21212	21212	lady	539	” “
21225	21263	21212	21212	lady	539	” This alacritous acceptance of the raised figure should have warned us — I , indeed , did perceive that the man wanted the cottage enough to pay the four shillings for it . But Chloe said : “
21289	21290	21283	21283	you	0	” “
21300	21305	21298	21298	miss	533	” said the man , “
21348	21349	21338	21338	I	0	” “
21355	21403	21338	21338	I	0	” said Chloe , and our new tenant left us . I was full of doubts and distrusts , which I turned to impart to Chloe ; but as our gate slammed behind us she threw her arms round my neck in a transport of avaricious enthusiasm . “
21467	21468	21471	21471	you	0	” “
21481	21482	21478	21479	Mrs. Midas	70	” “
21485	21491	21478	21479	Mrs. Midas	70	” she answered , promptly . “
21553	21554	21555	21556	This man	547	” “
21558	21562	21555	21556	This man	547	” I said , “
21625	21626	21629	21629	dear	418	” “
21631	21635	21629	21629	dear	418	” said she . “
21654	21733	21648	21648	him	547	” But on Saturday it was too late . We learned , indeed , during the course of the day , our tenant 's name , and it was Prosser , than which no surname claims a larger share of my personal abhorrence ; but where was the use of asking for references when the moving had been effected during the hours immediately following the dawn , when our after - breakfast expedition to the cottage showed us the “
21737	21768	21771	21771	I	0	” already dumped down on the cottage - garden flower - beds , and a slatternly drab of a woman carrying them slowly in ? The furniture looked very dirty . “
21780	21789	21771	21771	I	0	” I murmured , as we delicately withdrew . “
21809	21810	21806	21807	the lady	459	” “
21819	21824	21806	21807	the lady	459	” said my wife ; “
21874	21875	21876	21876	I	0	” “
21883	21892	21880	21880	you	559	” I said . And indeed I did . “
22003	22004	22000	22001	competent directors	570	” “
22012	22018	22005	22005	We	528	” she answered , gayly . “
22106	22293	22294	22294	You	577	” It was with but half a heart that I collected pail , hearth - stone , and house - flannel . I had to take a scrubbing - brush to the green mould , and I wondered why the favorite implement gave me so little joy as I wielded it . The sudden arrival of the new maid 's box , by Carter Paterson , enlightened me . I found myself now working with vigor and enthusiasm . Since she really was coming ! I knew then that I had never believed she would come , and it had seemed futile to spread milk - white over the doorstep , just for Chloe and me , whose eyes its blotted gray and moss green had always delighted . Now I finished the doorstep con amore , and hastened to the kitchen where Chloe and a hammer were busy together . I scrubbed the dressers and the table and the deal shelf that pulls out under the window . Chloe is always wise enough to feed energy with praise — a diet too often grudged it . “
22299	22303	22294	22294	You	577	” she said . “
22316	22317	22318	22318	You	577	” “
22337	22338	22332	22333	Jane Austen	72	” “
22342	22346	22339	22340	Dear Jane	73	” said Chloe . “
22355	22408	22339	22340	Dear Jane	73	” She had nailed up a deep flounce of green and red chintz along the chimney - piece , and another above the windows . A cushion to match nestled in the shabby Windsor arm - chair we had recently picked up for two and threepence in a back street in Deptford . “
22506	22507	22481	22481	you	577	” “
22510	22516	22481	22481	you	577	” I said , firmly ; “
22536	22842	22529	22529	I	0	” The cake - tins were a shining crown to the splendor of the chintz flounce . Our crockery , well spread out upon the two large dressers , made a brave show . Our bedroom hearth - rug , also woven of reds and greens , showed up the beauty of the chintz flounce , which in its turn , by its neat newness , added lustre and importance to the hearth - rug . It was indeed a beautiful picture — a poem , even , set to music by the singing of the new kitchen kettle , and I did not grudge the sacrifice of the parlor table - cloth to the completion of that radiant harmony . We had our lunch in a very great hurry , so as to get the plates washed up before our new servant came . By two o'clock all was ready . Ever since the joyous day when in my well - ironed frock - coat I had gone forth and engaged a servant , Chloe had ventured , day by day , on more and more daring preparations for the maid 's arrival , and Chloe had dragged me with her . We had cleaned the white parlor — when we had a servant we could afford to sit in a parlor . We had laid down a rug or two on the red - and - white marble of the hall , and hung two or three old prints on the dull brown of its walls . We sat out some oak chairs and the old elm kneading - trough in it by way of furniture . We had put up dimity curtains in the new maid 's bedroom : Chloe insisted on these , not because she admired the material , but because “
22844	22966	23012	23012	you	588	” is such a nice word — the born sister of lavender , and tall presses , and well - scrubbed boards , and patch - work quilts . We had a patch - work quilt — the gift of a gaunt great - aunt of mine — and we sacrificed it to the fitness of things , and let it live with the dimity curtains . Chloe adorned the dimity - covered dressing ing - table with a smart , new pin - cushion with blue bows , and set a blue jug of pink roses on the broad window - sill . Our servant 's bedroom was as pretty as paint . I said so , and Chloe said : “
23025	23026	23027	23027	I	0	” “
23039	23043	23027	23027	I	0	” I said ; “
23050	23051	23044	23044	we	589	” “
23056	23057	23054	23054	nobody	591	” “
23065	23066	23060	23060	her	590	” “
23071	23075	23067	23067	We	589	” said Chloe , “
23162	23270	23149	23149	I	0	” No courtier expecting a visit from his sovereign ever waited the monarch 's advent with half the anxious embarrassment that was ours as , I in flannels and Chloe in soft muslin , we sat in the wicker chairs by the front porch , with our books and our work - basket , in an atmosphere of elegant leisure , ayant l'air de rien , just as if we sat there idly every day of the week . At half - past three the white smoke of the down train clouded the blue above our willow - trees . Chloe put her hand to her heart . “
23324	23325	23329	23329	you	0	” “
23338	23342	23343	23343	her	594	” I said ; “
23356	23371	23372	23372	Courage	74	” Breaking a silence full of emotion came the click of the front gate . “
23374	23378	23379	23379	My	0	” I murmured . “
23386	23390	23379	23379	My	0	” said she . “
23403	23404	23407	23407	you	0	” “
23431	23484	23485	23485	She	0	” I saw her meet the new servant and lead her into the house . It was an anxious time . I could not read , and I was trying to go on with Chloe 's duster- hemming when she came back , with bright eyes and no horseshoes on her brow . “
23490	23495	23485	23485	She	0	” said my wife , “
23532	23626	23529	23529	she	0	“ ‘ This is the spare room , I suppose , mum . ’ And I said , ‘ No , it 's yours . ’ And she just said , ‘ Well ’ and sniffed at the roses . And she came down almost directly . Oh , what beautiful things clean caps and aprons are ! And she 's getting the tea , Len . And she likes the kitchen . And she said it was like their kitchen at home . I do believe she 's going to be nice ! ”
23668	23671	23672	23672	she	75	“ Why , ”
23675	23712	23672	23672	she	75	“ I could do the work here with one hand behind me ! You go along , mum , and play the pianna , and mess about with the flowers , or make your pretty pictures . ”
23911	23917	23919	23919	I.	0	“ Fortune smiles at last , ”
23920	23927	23919	23919	I.	0	“ Here 's to the ghost ! ”
23946	23950	24005	24006	The editor	167	“ Dear sir , ”
23954	24004	24005	24006	The editor	167	“ your story , ‘ The Return , ’ to hand . It is quite satisfactory , and if you care to supply a series of six , in the same style , we could , I think , find room for them in the magazine during next year . ”
24036	24045	24046	24046	I	0	“ It is my name at the foot , ”
24049	24084	24046	24046	I	0	“ This piece of luck has happened to me ! It ought to have been addressed to Messrs. Ghost & Co. , ought n't it ? Aid me , ye powers ! Six stories ! ”
24085	24091	24093	24093	Chloe	45	“ In the same style , ”
24116	24129	24093	24093	Chloe	45	“ Are you going to imitate the ghost 's style , Len ? ”
24143	24154	24155	24155	she	45	“ Of course you write much better than the ghost , ”
24160	24169	24155	24155	she	45	“ but he does say the same style . ”
24170	24187	24189	24189	I.	0	“ I have written stories before — and I can do it again , I suppose , ”
24190	24225	24189	24189	I.	0	“ I only happened to get stuck with that story . I should have finished it all right if the ghost had n't interfered . I wish to goodness she 'd let it alone ! ”
24242	24249	24250	24250	she	45	“ Will you have another cup ? ”
24255	24261	24250	24250	she	45	“ What 's the matter ? ”
24281	24284	24285	24285	I	0	“ What ! ”
24288	24344	24285	24285	I	0	“ take part with a nasty , stuck - up ghost against your own husband — so talented , yet so modest ? If I am to have a rival , let it be flesh and blood , and not a ghost whose head I can not punch , whose back I can not horsewhip ! ”
24345	24350	24351	24351	she	45	“ Well , then , ”
24365	24396	24351	24351	she	45	“ I think the ghost only meant to be kind , and I do n't like to hear you speak as if you thought it had no business to interfere . ”
24397	24401	24402	24402	I	0	“ I see , ”
24415	24418	24419	24419	she	45	“ Yes , ”
24422	24436	24419	24419	she	45	“ I see you see . Here 's luck to the six stories ! ”
24457	24472	24450	24450	she	75	“ Please , mum , are those your cottages along by the garden wall ? ”
24480	24483	24484	24484	she	45	“ Yes , ”
24487	24494	24484	24484	she	45	“ Do you know any one — ”
24495	24500	24502	24502	Mary	75	“ Well , mum , ”
24504	24519	24520	24520	Chloe	45	“ I think it 's no more but right that you should know it . ”
24523	24526	24520	24520	Chloe	45	“ What ? ”
24530	24572	24527	24527	Mary	75	“ Why , their goings - on ! I see him last night , as I come in , as drunk as drunk , lying all over the front garden , and I went down this morning to have another look . ”
24573	24586	24587	24587	I	0	“ And was he still there — all over the front garden ? ”
24590	24680	24587	24587	I	0	“ No , sir , not him , but everything else you can think of . But I wo n't say not a word more , sir ; but it 's not respectable , and I thought you ought to know , sir . You 're that innocent , sir , if you 'll excuse me saying so . I know you wo n't believe no harm of any one till you have caught 'em at it . You just go and look , sir , that 's all . ”
24734	24745	24746	24746	Chloe	45	“ And the worst of it is it 's true , ”
24749	24791	24746	24746	Chloe	45	“ You are innocent . No — don't be offended . I 'm afraid I am , too . We are Babes in the Wood , Len , just as Yolande said , and Mary has the sense to see it . ”
24798	24971	24792	24792	I	0	“ Yes , I know you said so , and I know it 's my fault ; but other things are yours . You are innocent . Do n't deny it . Oh , Len , we ought to be living in a villa , and paying proper little calls , and giving proper little dinners , and decorating our dinner - table with proper little cut flowers in proper little cut - glass vases ; and when we dined alone the fishmonger would send in two proper little whitings with their proper little tails in their mouths ; and we should have roast chicken , and it would be minced the next day , and everything would go by dull , beautiful , proper little clock - work ; and you would say what a good manager I was , because we neither of us should have any idea what good management really meant . We 're failures , Len . We have n't the wit to run a great estate . ”
24972	24976	24977	24977	I	0	“ In fact , ”
24980	24993	24977	24977	I	0	“ we 've bitten off a larger chunk than we can chew . ”
24994	25000	24792	24792	I	0	“ Do n't be vulgar ! ”
25001	25012	24792	24792	I	0	“ I 'm not — I'm trying to be American . ”
25013	25037	24977	24977	I	0	“ You 're not succeeding . They do n't talk like that . I knew an American once . He was the nicest — ”
25038	25056	24792	24792	I	0	“ I know . He thought you were the nicest . Why did n't you marry him ? ”
25057	25085	24792	24792	I	0	“ Because he was rich , and it 's my destiny to ruin a poor man . Len , I wish I was n't such an idiot ! ”
25086	25137	24977	24977	I	0	“ Or that I was n't . That would do just as well . But do n't let 's weep about it yet . Perhaps Mary exaggerated . Our tenant may merely have been in a fit . No known system of manorial management can avert fits among the tenantry . ”
25138	25154	24792	24792	I	0	“ But she said , ‘ You go and look , that 's all ! ’ ”
25155	25158	25160	25160	I	0	“ Well , ”
25164	25175	25160	25160	I	0	“ I will go and look . Will you come ? ”
25176	25179	25181	25181	she	617	“ No , ”
25183	25196	25181	25181	she	617	“ I 'm frightened . Yes , I will , of course . ”
25363	25370	25763	25763	I.	0	“ like flowers at a festival . ”
25750	25761	25774	25775	Mr. Prosser	71	“ I gave you written notice to quit last week , ”

25805	25810	25812	25812	I	0	“ Well , anyhow , ”
25814	25828	25838	25838	he	71	“ you 've got to clear out now . I want the cottage . ”
25829	25836	25838	25838	he	71	“ Right you are , sir , ”
25840	25852	25862	25862	I	0	“ but there must be proper notice give an ' took . ”
25853	25860	25862	25862	I	0	“ I give you notice now , ”
25864	25879	25884	25884	himself	635	“ and , while I am here , suppose you hand over the rent . ”
25892	25934	25946	25946	I	0	“ I 'm a yearly tenant , I am , and I pays on quarter - day , and six months ' notice is what I 'm entitled to . ‘ Nine pun two a year , ’ your missus said . ”
25935	25945	26289	26289	Chloe	45	“ Very well . I shall consult my solicitor , ”

26684	26693	26694	26694	I	0	“ Better than my life , of course , ”
26699	26717	26728	26728	she	45	“ but I 'm just starting on this story , and if it 's some domestic detail — ”
26718	26726	26728	26728	she	45	“ No , it ca n't wait , ”
26739	26764	26694	26694	I	0	“ and it 's not a variation on the domestic theme . It 's the theme itself . Len — it 's all over ! ”
26765	26771	26694	26694	I	0	“ What 's all over ? ”
26772	26781	26728	26728	she	45	“ Everything . She 's going to leave . ”
26782	26785	26694	26694	I	0	“ Why ? ”
26786	26806	26807	26807	I	0	“ I do n't know . I was too upset to ask her . I just came to you . ”
26831	26886	26893	26893	I	0	“ I do n't know what it is . We 've been nice to her , I 'm sure ! She likes us — at least I thought she did . It 's Destiny — it 's like Maeterlinck — whatever we do turns out all anyhow . There 's a curse upon us ! ”
26887	26892	26936	26936	She	162	“ Speak for yourself , ”
26898	26935	26948	26948	she	162	“ You may be cursed , though it 's barely polite of you to say so , but I am blessed above all that live , I 'm blessed if I 'm not — since you — ”
26941	26947	26948	26948	she	162	“ Do n't you see , ”
26951	26994	27010	27010	I	0	“ it 's serious , horribly serious ? I wish I had never come here . I wish we were back in the Bandbox — there ! Now crow over me , and tell me you told me so all the time ! ”
27013	27026	27035	27035	Chloe	45	“ At least we may as well know why she 's going . ”
27027	27033	27035	27035	Chloe	45	“ I 'll ask her , ”
27041	27070	27089	27089	I	0	“ It 's probably Prosser . If I were you I should just take him by the shoulders and turn him out . You 're quite strong enough . ”
27071	27087	27089	27089	I	0	“ Yes , and have an action for assault and a hundred pounds ' damages , ”
27099	27136	27172	27172	I.	0	“ Go and ask her . Perhaps it 's not Prosser . Even he , fiend without out references as he is , ca n't be responsible for everything . Perhaps she 's seen the ghost . ”
27167	27170	27178	27178	she	45	“ Well ? ”
27173	27176	27178	27178	she	45	“ Well ? ”
27180	27186	27195	27195	Chloe	45	“ Have you found out ? ”
27187	27193	27195	27195	Chloe	45	“ It 's all right , ”
27204	27223	27178	27178	she	45	“ We have n't done anything . She is awfully fond of us — but she must go . ”
27224	27227	27178	27178	she	45	“ Why ? ”
27228	27237	27195	27195	Chloe	45	“ She 's going to marry the baker . ”
27238	27242	27178	27178	she	45	“ Lucky man ! ”
27243	27251	27195	27195	Chloe	45	“ It 's a love - affair , ”
27253	27287	27195	27195	Chloe	45	Chloe—“the prettiest story . They could n't marry before because he was n't well enough off , and now an uncle has left him some money , and he 's bought a partnership . ”
27288	27315	27326	27326	Chloe	45	“ And how long have they been waiting for each other ? How many long years of priceless constancy , tried like gold in the furnace ? ”
27316	27324	27326	27326	Chloe	45	“ That 's the worst of it , ”
27334	27357	27195	27195	Chloe	45	“ she 's only known him for a month . But servants are expeditious as the wind in matters of the heart . ”
27358	27375	27387	27388	my wife	162	“ Charles Reade : Hard Cash — yes . Well , it 's hard on us . ”
27376	27385	27387	27388	my wife	162	“ But it 's very nice for them , ”
27390	27402	27409	27409	I	0	“ You ought to feel ever so much sympathy with lovers ! ”
27403	27407	27409	27409	I	0	“ I do , ”
27411	27428	27435	27435	she	162	“ especially when they are married and live in a house miles too big for them . ”
27429	27434	27435	27435	she	162	“ Oh , Len , ”
27438	27448	27387	27388	my wife	162	“ are you really so very sorry for yourself ? ”
27449	27463	27387	27388	my wife	162	“ I am just as sorry for myself as you are for me . ”
27464	27487	27435	27435	she	162	“ And I 'm just as sorry for you as you can possibly be for yourself . Where had we got to ? ”
27488	27519	27387	27388	my wife	162	“ We had got to Mary 's marrying the baker , and your not minding being left without a servant because of your admiration for the beauty of constant love . ”
27520	27533	27547	27547	I	0	“ Let 's go into the garden and finish talking about it . ”
27534	27545	27547	27547	I	0	“ I could talk all day about love and constancy , ”
27549	27554	27562	27562	she	660	“ but my story — ”
27555	27560	27562	27562	she	660	“ Bother the story ! ”
27564	27597	28211	28211	I	0	“ and it 's not love I want to talk about , unless you ca n't keep off the subject . It 's advertisements , and registry - offices , and Prosser . ”
28205	28210	28289	28289	Chloe	45	“ strong domestic interest . ”
28278	28287	28289	28289	Chloe	45	“ I knew it was going to rain , ”
28291	28334	28342	28342	I	0	“ How good it is to hear it ! Do n't you feel almost as glad of it as if you were a tree ? Fancy standing up to it and holding out all your leaves to feel the splash of it ! ”
28335	28341	28342	28342	I	0	“ It makes work easier , ”
28345	28368	28379	28379	she	45	“ Now you ca n't entice me away from my stories and tempt me to waste the golden hours in the garden . ”
28369	28378	28342	28342	I	0	“ That 's the worst of this house , ”
28380	28438	28446	28446	Chloe	45	said—“everything inside it urges to industry . The white parlor is so proper , I never sit in it without feeling that I ought to be doing open - work embroidery , if not working a sampler . What heaps of work we shall do in the winter when there 's no dear garden to tempt us ! ”
28439	28443	28478	28478	I	0	“ I wonder — ”
28481	28484	28494	28494	she	45	“ Coffee ? ”
28485	28492	28504	28504	she	45	“ It 's not ready yet , ”
28500	28503	28504	28504	she	45	“ Len , ”

28519	28524	28591	28591	She	45	“ Not more rabbits ? ”
28575	28590	28765	28765	she	45	“ No , no — how can you remind me of that ? Come . ”
28757	28764	28765	28765	she	45	“ Now I 'll make coffee , ”
28774	28799	28807	28807	she	45	“ Coffee seems very flat . Is it possible that you are n't going to satisfy my raging curiosity ? What is this room ? ”
28800	28806	28807	28807	she	45	“ It 's the loafery , ”
28810	28828	28765	28765	she	45	“ In the winter , as you say , we shall need a place to loaf in . ”
28829	28836	28848	28848	I	0	“ I did n't say so . ”
28837	28847	28868	28868	I	0	“ Yes , you did . Try the divan . ”
28864	28867	28868	28868	I	0	“ Chloe , ”
28871	28875	28890	28890	she	45	“ come here ! ”
28876	28887	28890	28890	she	45	“ I ca n't . I 'm making the coffee . ”
28901	28980	28868	28868	I	0	“ Do you know that you are blushing as though you had been detected in pocket - picking , or in some generous act ? Why are you embarrassed ? Why are you shy ? Why do you screen yourself behind a spirit - lamp ? Why have you done this ? And why do n't you rush into my arms as a dutiful wife should , and confess how you came to have such a beautiful idea ? ”
28981	28989	28868	28868	I	0	“ You do like it , then ? ”
28990	29031	28890	28890	she	45	“ Like it ? I protest , by all my household gods , that if I had been a bachelor inhabiting this house , thus , and in no other way , should I have furnished my living - room ! ”
29032	29042	29094	29094	She	693	“ Why ‘ if you were a bachelor ’ ? ”
29043	29093	29125	29125	I.	0	“ Because my wife likes pretty things . She likes green Flemish pots , and brass warming - pans , and Sheffield - plate candlesticks , and flowers ; and , as a husband , I like what she likes . Chloe , why are there no flowers here ? ”
29117	29123	29125	29125	I.	0	“ You 're a witch , ”
29126	29205	29213	29213	she	693	“ How did you know exactly what I liked ? Here is space — nothing to knock down ! And form — no curtains to break the fine lines of these old windows . And color — look at the green light ; it 's like a fairy palace lighted by glowworm - lamps , especially when that gleam of sunlight came ! Chloe , how did you know ? Is it because you love me very much ? ”
29206	29212	29248	29248	She	693	“ Not in the least , ”
29218	29247	29354	29354	she	693	“ It 's because — Len , do n't laugh at me — I knew how to do the room because it 's what I like , too ! ”
29283	29353	29354	29354	she	693	“ That 's why I felt silly and why I blushed — only , of course , I never did blush . I seem to be turning into somebody else , and perhaps you wo n't like me so much . Or I 'm half myself and half somebody else , and I do n't know which half is really you . It did n't cost anything , hardly , ”
29360	29418	29452	29452	she	693	“ The divan is only orange - boxes filled with straw , and covered with those old green curtains — you know — the ones that were so faded . And the table is out of the kitchen — the two shelves that pull out are quite enough there , Mary says . And that 's all . ”
29429	29451	29452	29452	she	693	“ I bought the stuff for these , of course — the green twirlies on them just match the old curtains , ”
29455	29462	29468	29468	I	0	“ And that really is all . ”
29463	29467	29477	29477	she	693	“ Honest Injun ? ”
29473	29476	29481	29481	her	693	“ Oh , ”
29484	29496	29505	29505	I	0	“ if you think I really did it to please you — ”
29497	29504	29515	29515	she	693	“ But tell me , then , ”
29508	29514	29515	29515	she	693	“ I do n't know , ”
29533	29743	29751	29751	I	0	“ You see , the Red House is so big . It 's like Shakespeare or Goethe , and the Bandbox was like Savoy opera . And I hate mixing things up . And then it is so awful to have to dust things ! Was n't it Thoreau who threw away his curios because he could n't be bothered to dust them ? And Mary 's going , and I thought if one could have a room with just only what one needed — a lounge , a table , two chairs — we can put more books if you like . But I thought — if you would — we need n't use it only for loafing ; we could bring anything we liked here — work or anything ; but I thought if you would agree never to leave anything here , but take everything away when we 'd done it , whatever it was , then we should always have one room tidy — at least the untidiness would never be more than one day deep . It 's letting the litter of the days overlap that makes everything so hopeless . And I thought , perhaps , I should get some work done here . ”
29744	29750	29751	29751	I	0	“ You are a genius , ”
29754	29780	29793	29793	she	696	“ and I am Prince Fortunate . I only regret one thing , and that is , that I did not think of it myself . ”
29781	29792	29793	29793	she	696	“ If you had you would n't have done it , ”
29796	29819	29515	29515	she	693	quickly—“that 's just it . Because you thought I — and so I did — but — Anyway , you 're pleased ? ”
29820	29824	29515	29515	she	693	“ I am . ”
29825	29901	29793	29793	she	696	“ The odd thing is that I think I must be two people , because if I had heaps of servants I should have the green pottery and brass and things in every room but this . Len , since we came to live here everything seems different . I feel as if I were swimming for my life in a great sea — nothing 's the same as I used to think it was . ”
29902	29905	29515	29515	she	693	“ Nothing ? ”
29906	29916	29922	29922	I	0	“ Only us . I wonder if you understand — ”
29917	29921	29922	29922	I	0	“ My dear , ”
29925	29940	29515	29515	she	693	“ we 've tumbled out of our doll 's house into the real world . ”
29941	29957	29515	29515	she	693	“ Oh no , this is n't the real world — it 's too nice . ”
29958	30021	29515	29515	she	693	“ Into a new world , then — a world where we have to think for ourselves and judge things on their merits . We 're like Columbus , madam . The really important thing is to find out for one 's self , without any sort of mistake , what are the things one cares about — the things that matter — ”
30022	30105	30117	30117	I	0	“ And the things one does n't care about — those are much more important — the things one has just because other people have them — at least , if that 's not the reason I do n't know what is . And we 've so much to learn , and there are so many good qualities I know nothing about . Do n't you feel very poor and unimportant , Len ? And very , very ignorant ? I do . ”
30106	30115	29515	29515	she	693	“ I know one or two important things , ”
30136	30216	30222	30222	Chloe	45	“ and I have one or two unimportant possessions — the Red House , and a wife , and a loafery . See , the sun is coming out in earnest ; how glorious it is through the green ! Oh , it 's a good world , when all 's said and done ! How thick the creeper grows . What does it hang by ? Why , there are bars ! This must have been the nursery . ”
30217	30220	30249	30249	I.	0	“ Yes , ”
30237	30247	30261	30261	her	162	“ It would make a splendid nursery , too , ”

30267	30288	30300	30300	She	45	“ Len , I feel very silly indeed , to - day ; I should like to say something stupid . ”
30289	30299	30300	30300	She	45	“ You could n't offer me a greater novelty . ”
30317	30414	30420	30420	I	0	“ You know you thought it was so mad of me wanting to come to the Red House , but I saw these bars that very first day , and I thought how nice it would be for them to have a beautiful place to remember when they grow up . Not to remember the people next door , and organ - grinders , and gritty dust , and pavements , but quietness and big green trees and lawns , and this grave old house . Do n't you think it would be nice for them ? ”

30563	30571	30572	30572	she	45	“ I told you I was silly , ”
30575	30675	30776	30777	the duke	2133	“ but since I am silly I 'll say one silly thing more . I do n't think any one in this world was ever so happy as I am . And when I get worried and cross , you know — Oh , why am I saying all the things that you know perfectly , and that one does n't say ? You must get back to your work , and I 'll try to do that drawing of the duke . And to - night we 'll have a consultation about Mary . Yolande shall advise us . ”
30807	30813	31236	31236	she	45	“ the greatest muff in the school”—and
31230	31235	31236	31236	she	45	“ Oh , Len , ”
31254	31292	31376	31376	I	0	“ look what she — I mean , look what the ghost has done ! Oh , what a clever ghost to be able to draw and write better — I mean as well as we can ! ”
31365	31375	31376	31376	I	0	“ It is indeed a ghost in a thousand ! ”
31379	31387	31393	31393	she	45	“ Shall you send the drawing in ? ”
31388	31392	31393	31393	she	45	“ Of course ! ”
31402	31422	31448	31448	Chloe	45	“ And I only wish the ghost would illustrate trate that hateful fairy tale for the Children 's Globe . ”
31442	31446	31448	31448	Chloe	45	“ And now , ”
31450	31459	31558	31558	she	52	“ we must hold a council of war . ”
31561	31607	31558	31558	she	52	“ Not here , anyway ; this is your very own room . I should feel as uncomfortable in it as I should in your boots , Len , or in Chloe 's gold - rimmed eye - glasses . I vote for the cedars . ”
31612	31615	31738	31738	Chloe	45	“ Nonsense ! ”
31730	31736	31775	31775	she	45	“ Can you do anything ? ”
31753	31774	31775	31775	she	45	“ I suppose I could offer to stay and help you to wash and spin , and bake and brew , ”
31778	31799	31815	31815	Chloe	45	“ but I 'm not effectual . And , besides , it would be like cutting firewood with a razor . ”
31800	31813	31829	31829	Yolande	52	“ Your modesty was always your strong point , my dear Razor , ”
31817	31827	31829	31829	Yolande	52	“ A razor is not fitted for chopping firewood , ”
31833	31889	31900	31900	her	162	“ and it is fitted for other things . If you cut firewood with it it ca n't do its own proper work that it was made for . And if I may just hit out once brutally and straight from the shoulder , I will relieve my mind and not hurt you very much . ”
31890	31894	31900	31900	her	162	“ Strike here , ”
31906	32044	32051	32051	Chloe	45	“ May I ? Thanks , awfully . Well , then , you all - round people , who can turn your hand to anything , you 're always chopping firewood with razors zors ; you 're always diverting your energies from their proper channel , and doing a dozen people 's work indifferent well , because you have n't time to do it properly . Len cleans boots and door - steps and candlesticks , and comes to his real work with only half a heart ; Chloe ca n't do her drawing comfortably , because she has sweeping and dusting and cooking to see to . A really reasonable Len , a truly conscientious Chloe , would work at its own trade , and hire other people to work at theirs . I have spoken . ”
32045	32049	32051	32051	Chloe	45	“ Poor fox ! ”
32055	32064	32072	32073	Miss Richborough	86	“ were the nasty grapes sour , then ? ”
32065	32071	32072	32073	Miss Richborough	86	“ I will not pretend , ”
32078	32131	32051	32051	Chloe	45	“ to misunderstand your allusion . I am not an accomplished sweeper . I dust ill and rarely . When I wash up I always break a cup or a plate . I dare say I should clean a boot with whitening , or a front door - step with Globe polish . ”
32132	32153	32051	32051	Chloe	45	“ And yet , by your own confession , you love to have your finger in your neighbor 's pies . ”
32154	32198	32210	32210	Chloe	45	“ Exactly ; I like to do what I am fitted for . I can adjust my neighbor 's pies better than any professional pastry - cook . And adjusting pies does n't interfere with my regular work — that 's the point . ”
32199	32209	32210	32210	Chloe	45	“ But we like doing things in the house , ”
32213	32284	32289	32289	I	0	“ Do n't I know it ? Oh , you need n't trouble to convince me of your depravity . I stick to what I said . All these irons in the fire — yes , even that contemptible little bit of garden that you 've weeded — all take off from the energy you ought to spend on your writing and drawing . You are both exceedingly naughty children ! ”
32285	32288	32289	32289	I	0	“ How , ”
32292	32303	32318	32318	she	45	“ in these circumstances would a really good child behave ? ”
32304	32317	32318	32318	she	45	“ It would not bite blades of grass , to begin with , ”
32321	32360	32368	32368	I	0	“ when it was being lectured for its own good . And then look at your ruffianly tenant . When one lets houses one employs an agent , and he insists on references . He knows his business . ”
32378	32385	32397	32397	Yolande	52	“ We were certainly wrong there . ”
32392	32395	32397	32397	Yolande	52	“ we , ”
32401	32480	32491	32491	I.	0	“ Then as to servants , it would pay you to have a really good one , if you had to pay her thirty or forty pounds a year . Do n't open your pretty eyes at me , Chloe — I mean it . You 've always got far more work than you can do , as things are now . If you really stick to your work you could well afford the wages of a paragon . ”
32481	32489	32491	32491	I.	0	“ Puzzle : to find the paragon , ”
32492	32559	32564	32564	I	0	“ Ah ! that 's where I come in . I ca n't wash dishes — anyway , I wo n't . But if you 'll give me a free hand I 'll find you a servant as good as this Mary of yours . I 'll bet my Omar Khayyam , and it 's a first edition , you know , against your Shropshire Lad ! ”
32560	32563	32564	32564	I	0	“ Done ! ”
32569	32577	32587	32587	Yolande	52	“ And what about the degraded Prosser ? ”
32578	32585	32642	32642	She	52	“ One thing at a time , ”
32589	32641	32690	32690	she	52	“ The question of the tenantry must stand over till we 've settled the problem of domestic service . Ah , do n't talk to me any more ! My brain is teeming with the most fascinating ideas , as brilliant as practicable . Let me alone while my schemes develop . ”
32680	32689	32690	32690	she	52	“ We are like babes in the wood , ”
32693	32701	32708	32708	I	0	“ I wonder whether she 'll succeed . ”
32702	32707	32708	32708	I	0	“ She always succeeds , ”
32713	32759	32690	32690	she	52	“ it 's her métier . Ours , I suppose , is that of these same babes — helplessness , appealing to the pity of all kindly passers - by — and I own that it 's not a métier I 'm particularly proud of . ”
32760	32769	32777	32777	I	0	“ Yolande is n't every passer - by . ”
32770	32776	32777	32777	I	0	“ Yes , she is , ”
32780	32785	32791	32792	my wife	162	“ every single one . ”
32786	32789	32791	32792	my wife	162	“ Dear , ”
32796	32809	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ you are very cross , and presently you will be sorry . ”
32851	32854	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ Seriously , ”
32868	32948	32958	32958	I	0	“ I think Yolande 's right . It 's our métier to write and draw , and earn our livings . We ca n't be clever enough to do everything . Why should we be too proud to let her try to do what we have n't been able to do — get a servant who will stay ? You 're not really vexed because Yolande said what she did ? You know how fond she is of us . ”
32949	32957	32958	32958	I	0	“ I only know I feel contemptible , ”
32961	32974	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ I ought to be able to manage these things for myself . ”
32975	32996	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ Then shall I tell Yolande not to trouble ? Len , how silly you are ! What is it ? ”
32997	33025	32958	32958	I	0	“ I should have thought it would be more pleasant to you to think you 'd married a man , and not a babe in the wood . ”
33026	33069	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ You were manly enough in the Bandbox , but I did n't know then half how dear you were . Oh , Len ! do n't you think it 's nice to find out all sorts of things together , even — ”
33070	33081	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ Even our babe - in - the - woodness ? ”
33082	33113	32958	32958	I	0	“ Yes , even our limitations . Why should we want to pretend we can do everything ? We can do a great many things that Yolande ca n't do . ”
33114	33126	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ Yes — wash up , and sweep , and dust . ”
33127	33141	32856	32856	Chloe	45	“ But you like doing them . And we can write and draw . ”
33142	33173	33179	33193	a wife who did not answer that appeal with an , “ Oh , darling	2185	“ So can — so can the ghost . Dear , the black dog is on my back . You 'd better go away and leave me for a bit . ”
33190	33206	33313	33313	she	45	“ Oh , darling , surely you do n't want to be away from me ? ”
33321	33380	33821	33821	she	75	“ Chloe , Chloe , I 've put the nasty black dog up the chimney . I 'm the happiest man alive ! I 'm King of the Universe , and you 're Queen ! Yolande does n't belong to the reigning house . Poor Yolande ! we ca n't do less than let her be our vizier . ”
33807	33820	33821	33821	she	75	“ I ai n't a - going to leave you , mum , ”
33824	33892	33900	33900	Chloe	45	“ Miss Yo she told me not to say nothing , so as to make it a regular surprise for you when I come back . I 'm only going for a week along of my Jim to see his father and mother down Marden way , and then I 'm coming back . Miss Yo told me you 'd told her to arrange what she liked . ”
33893	33898	33900	33900	Chloe	45	“ But your Jim , ”
33904	33910	33821	33821	she	75	“ what will he say ? ”
33911	33920	33821	33821	she	75	“ He 's only too pleased , mum . ”
33921	33933	33941	33941	Mary	75	“ Only too pleased ? Not to live with his wife ? ”
33934	33939	33941	33941	Mary	75	“ Oh , mum , ”
33948	34068	34157	34157	he	48	“ Miss Yo arranged it all . Him and me is to have all the rooms beyond the kitchen . He 's got a beautiful lot of furniture as come to him from his aunt at Canterbury . He wo n't be in no one 's way , mum , being out so much , and I 'm to do for you just the same as ever ; and I am so glad as never was , for I could n't abide the notion of leaving you , mum , and you putting roses in my bedroom and all , as if I was the Queen , and now working those things for me with your own pretty hands ! ”
34152	34155	34256	34256	she	75	“ backer , ”

We ' ai n't got no friends here to ask , so we thought we 'd have it done after service , so as to be sure of the congregation anyway . ”
34431	34433	34529	34529	she	75	“ backer ”

34746	34831	34843	34843	Chloe	45	“ Your cups are , I believe , Spode — or is it only Spode and Copeland ? Shall I wash up ? I warn you that I can not answer for my fingers . They lose their grasp if I become interested in my own reflections — or , yes — or in the conversation of others , so it 's no use offering to talk to me while I do it . I know my limitations , and I abide by them . ”
34832	34841	34843	34843	Chloe	45	“ I 'm not proud of my limitations , ”
34845	34850	34851	34851	Yolande	52	“ No , dear , ”
34856	34878	34727	34727	Chloe	45	“ that 's because you have n't any . Why do n't you get some ? They are a great convenience . ”
34879	34895	34851	34851	Yolande	52	“ You speak as though one could decide one 's limitations for one 's self . ”
34896	34908	34917	34917	Chloe	45	“ And ca n't one ? A clever woman like you — ”
34909	34915	34917	34917	Chloe	45	“ No butter , thanks , ”
34919	34979	34985	34985	I	0	“ — Like you could do anything that silly women can do , and could do any one thing she gave her whole mind to , better than these silly women . But no one can do everything . When you 've found that out , and decided what you want to do , you 've learned your limitations . ”
34980	34984	34985	34985	I	0	“ You mean , ”
34988	35012	35019	35019	her	788	“ that you could wash dishes with the best , and sweep and dust und so weiter , if you only cared to ? ”
35013	35017	34985	34985	I	0	“ Of course I could”—Yolande
35021	35134	34985	34985	I	0	eyes—“I could do anything I gave my mind to . But I have n't a hundred minds to give to a hundred industries . When I was quite a child I declined to be taught to sew . I saw , even then , that one 's knowledge of feminine crafts is just a weapon in the hands of the evil one , who lies in wait at every corner to keep one off one 's real work . I meant to go to Girton : so when they made me wash up the tea - things , I always dropped something . They soon left off asking me to wash up . ”
35135	35140	35181	35181	I	0	“ How horribly immoral ! ”
35141	35180	35208	35208	Yolande	52	“ Not at all . I only enforced my decision by concrete arguments — the only ones my aunt could understand . The secret of success is to know what you want and what you do n't want . ”
35202	35207	35208	35208	Yolande	52	“ Do you suppose , ”
35212	35270	35279	35279	Chloe	45	“ that I should have taken every prize in each form all the way up the school , and then got a scholarship at Girton , if I had allowed myself to be taught to dust the drawing - room and to make my own dresses , and sew on buttons and darn stockings for the boys ? ”
35271	35277	35279	35279	Chloe	45	“ I do n't know , ”
35281	35319	35426	35426	We	790	“ perhaps mathematics take more time than drawing . Anyway , I liked learning the things you despise , and I liked doing them . I liked helping mother . I like playing with my own house . ”
35320	35425	35431	35431	Chloe	45	“ Helping Len — yes — perhaps it would be different . You see , I never had a mother . If I had had , I dare say I should have learned all these arts , just so as to be able to do something for her when she wanted it . But , as it was , I set myself to do a man 's work , and I tried to live a man 's life — apart from these little worries . And what 's more , I succeeded . There 's not a feminine trait about me , thank Heaven . ”
35434	35450	35604	35604	we	790	“ Take down your pretty hair , Yolande . I want to look at it . ”
35608	35613	35623	35623	she	45	“ No feminine traits ! ”
35614	35622	35623	35623	she	45	“ That 's not a feminine trait , ”
35628	35700	35710	35710	Chloe	45	“ Even a man tries to look as nice as he can . It 's not much he can do — but he does it . Look at men 's ties . They use thousands of them , and nobody ever notices what they wear , any more than any one ever notices whether women wear threes or fours in shoes . Yet most women pinch their feet and their waists . ”
35701	35708	35623	35623	she	45	“ Men notice waists , anyhow , ”
35712	35742	35752	35752	I	0	“ If Len sees a girl pinched in so that you wonder she does n't snap off short , he says , ‘ There 's a smart girl . ’ ”
35743	35751	35783	35783	Yolande	52	“ We are wandering from the point , ”
35757	35781	35783	35783	Yolande	52	“ Which , by - the - way , is that this very evening as ever is I 'm off to my club , ”
35787	35933	35944	35944	Chloe	45	“ I will not be taught to do house - work , and I love you both far too much not to fall an easy victim to your arts if I were to see you really in need of help . I ca n't abjure the creed of a lifetime . My only safety is in flight . When Mary comes back I 'll come back , too , if you 'll have me . I ca n't stay here and see the dark side of Mary 's honey - moon . And meantime you 'll give me leave to let my master - mind play round the question of your horrible tenant . Did you notice his front garden as we came back from church ? By - the - way , why did you never tell me your church has a Norman chancel ? ”
35934	35942	35944	35944	Chloe	45	“ We did n't know it ourselves , ”
35946	36026	35783	35783	Yolande	52	“ You see , we 've always been to Westenden church . It 's a lovely walk through the woods in the evening . Perhaps among the other things you declined to learn you escaped the knowledge that after you 've moved into a new house your first appearance in your parish church is a signal that you are ready for your neighbors to call on you ? Well , we did n't want them to call on us . ”
36027	36047	36054	36054	Chloe	45	“ Perhaps they will now , mum , thanking you for your slap about my ignorance of pretty manners . ”
36048	36052	36054	36054	Chloe	45	“ Oh no , ”
36056	36069	36084	36084	Yolande	52	“ our appearance there was unofficial . Any one could see that . ”

36540	36549	36588	36588	Her	162	“ What , Oliver ! Asking for more ? ”
36550	36587	36643	36643	she	162	“ Yes , Mr. Bumble . I 'll get lunch now — and then you must go and write , and I 'll put on my very oldest rags and clean out the china - cupboard . ”

36646	36701	36710	36710	I	0	“ you know I 've never let Mary touch it — she 's never even seen it unlocked — so it 's all as black as ink . And then I 'll wash the floor , and then I 'll wash the china and put it all back after I 've cleaned the window . ”

36713	36772	36643	36643	she	162	“ No , not for the world . I 'm going to enjoy myself . I 'm going to play , I am — I'm going to fritter away my intellect , as Yolande says . And you 're going to enjoy the dignity of labor , and do what you are really fitted for . Lucky boy ! ”
36773	36793	36643	36643	she	162	“ If you taunt me with my chains I wo n't pull an oar at all in this galley . ”

37403	37412	37413	37414	the woman	559	“ Your mistress is out , I suppose , ”
37417	37550	37568	37568	she	45	“ The vicar told me about the marriage yesterday . I was not at church myself . I hope you will tell your mistress that I called . And do n't you think , my good girl , that you could manage to get your dress changed by four in the afternoon ? It has a very slatternly appearance . And do you think it conscientious to leave off your cap and apron just because your mistress is not at home ? We should try to act the same in people 's absence as in their presence . I suppose , now that your fellow - servant has left , you have extra work , but that need not make you careless about personal cleanliness . You must remember that your mistress — ”
37560	37567	37568	37568	she	45	“ I am my own mistress , ”
37571	37606	37634	37634	Chloe	45	“ and the mistress of the Red House . No , do n't apologize , unless it is for lecturing another person 's servant — of course you could n't be expected to understand . ”
37618	37633	37634	37634	Chloe	45	“ Do sit down . You 're the vicar 's wife , I suppose , ”
37638	37668	37694	37694	she	2293	“ It 's very kind of you to call . My husband will be down presently . He shall make the kettle boil and get some tea for you . ”
37683	37693	37694	37694	she	2293	“ I am extremely sorry that the mistake occurred , ”
37697	37705	37719	37719	Chloe	45	“ I am rather short - sighted . ”
37706	37717	37752	37752	she	45	“ Yes , of course you must be , very , ”
37745	37751	37752	37752	she	45	“ It was very funny , ”
37755	37824	37882	37882	Chloe	45	“ You must n't mind my laughing a little . Really I ought to be proud to be taken for a servant . But , of course , moving only among the upper classes , you 've never met any one who did any house - work except servants . Now , I love house - work . I like it much better than my own proper work . ”
37825	37833	37926	37927	my wife	162	“ What is your own proper work ? ”
37834	37855	37752	37752	she	45	“ Oh , I was taught a trade , and my husband has learned one . We work very hard . ”
37856	37869	37892	37892	she	45	“ You must find this house very large , with no servants . ”
37885	37891	37926	37927	my wife	162	“ Do you think so ? ”
37912	37924	37926	37927	my wife	162	“ We came to live in it because we wished to , ”
37929	37940	37952	37953	my wife	162	“ It 's a very heavy rent , I suppose , ”
37947	37950	37952	37953	my wife	162	“ No , ”
37955	37963	37968	37968	she	559	“ Thank you so much for asking . ”
37974	37990	37941	37943	the insufferable woman	835	“ You must not expect many callers . I am afraid Elmhurst 's very exclusive . ”
37991	37999	37941	37943	the insufferable woman	835	“ Indeed ! Why , I wonder ? ”
38000	38036	38045	38045	Chloe	45	“ The leading families are very select . They expect to know all about new - comers , and it is not everybody who can get on the visiting - list of our best set . ”
38037	38043	38045	38045	Chloe	45	“ This is very interesting , ”
38049	38056	37941	37943	the insufferable woman	835	“ The habits of the aborigines — ”
38057	38128	37941	37943	the insufferable woman	835	“ My dear Mrs. — I fear I do not know your name — I am only warning you for your own good , and to prevent disappointment in the future . I shall continue to call on you . A vicar 's wife has duties — As the dear Dean of Somerset used to say , ‘ Social distinctions do not exist among the wives of the clergy . ’ ”
38129	38137	38045	38045	Chloe	45	“ Did he really ? How discerning ! ”
38138	38188	38199	38199	Chloe	45	“ Yes , he did indeed . But , on the other hand , we learn in our catechism to do our duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call us . And , of course , we all have our appointed stations . ”
38189	38197	38199	38199	Chloe	45	“ Shall please , not has pleased , ”
38201	38237	38249	38250	the vicaress	838	“ we are not forbidden to rise if we can , even from domestic service to the level of the best set in Elmhurst . What is the chief qualification ? Money , I suppose . ”

38254	38283	38199	38199	Chloe	45	“ As the dear Bishop of Selsea used to say , we ought not to associate in intimacy with persons of distinctly different social rank from our own . ”
38284	38297	38199	38199	Chloe	45	“ Did he say that ? Do you know him , then ? ”
38298	38306	38199	38199	Chloe	45	“ I have stayed at the palace . ”
38307	38335	38345	38346	The vicar	2277	“ Are you sure you did n't misunderstand him ? I have often heard him say that a man should choose associates of his own intellectual rank — ”
38336	38344	38345	38348	The vicar 's wife	2293	“ You have often heard him say ? ”
38354	38393	38394	38397	The vicar 's wife	2293	“ Yes — I know him rather well . He is my uncle . I never heard him mention your name . Yet I seem to know your face . Were you not Miss Blake before you married ? ”
38403	38437	38472	38472	she	559	“ I remember you when I was a little girl and you were my uncle 's housekeeper . Well , I was saying just now , domestic service is a very honorable calling . ”
38463	38471	38493	38493	she	559	“ I think I will go now , ”
38487	38492	38585	38585	she	844	“ I am sorry , ”
38496	38584	38585	38585	she	844	“ I would n't have said it if I had n't thought you wanted to be horrid to me . I dare say you did n't , really , but I have a hateful temper . Please forgive me . I wo n't tell a soul , if you 'd rather I did n't . And I like you heaps better since I 've remembered that you used to work too . Do forgive me ! I wo n't tell any one , not even my husband , ”
38606	38620	38660	38660	Chloe	45	“ Say you forgive me , and let me get you some tea . ”
38645	38659	38660	38660	Chloe	45	“ There 's only one thing I wish you would do for me , ”
38664	38713	38933	38933	Yolande	52	“ Do n't let the first families of Elmhurst know one of my uncles is a bishop , or they 'll call . We want to be quiet . And we live here because the house is our own . The late owner was my husband 's uncle . ”

39038	39044	39260	39260	We	868	“ Put in a ferret . ”
39045	39061	39018	39018	I	0	“ Wise man ! And what does the rat do when it sees the ferret ? ”
39062	39065	39260	39260	We	868	“ Bolts ! ”
39066	39103	39260	39260	We	868	“ So did Prosser . He knew he was a rat , and fair game for the ferret by virtue of more than one shady act . So when I put in the ferret he bolted . ”
39104	39109	39018	39018	I	0	“ But your ferret ? ”
39110	39139	39260	39260	We	868	“ I let the next — door cottage to the ferret for seven and sixpence a week . Rents are high here . There are very few cottages . ”
39140	39162	39260	39260	We	868	“ That 's about eighteen pounds a year . Yolande , you 're a goddess ! And who is your ferret ? ”
39163	39192	39018	39018	I	0	“ His name is Bates . He is a perfectly respectable ferret . I gave him a hint to give Prosser a hint , and Prosser took it . ”
39193	39201	39260	39260	We	868	“ Let 's go and tell Chloe . ”
39202	39259	39260	39260	We	868	“ I 've told her . And she wants to work . Let 's go into Prosser 's house and look over it . I 'm afraid it will want doing up . Mrs. Bates has given it what she calls a rough cleaning down already . Mrs. Bates is a woman after my own heart . ”
39274	39287	39260	39260	We	868	“ Mrs. Bates can do that . She 's a universal genius . ”

39351	39358	39364	39364	I	0	“ I 'll let that too . ”
39359	39363	39397	39397	I	0	“ You shall , ”
39400	39423	39432	39432	she	45	“ By - the - way , you have n't told me yet wherein consists the ferretiness of your ferret , Bates . ”
39424	39431	39432	39432	she	45	“ Oh , have n't I ? ”
39437	39447	39860	39860	Chloe	45	“ You see , my ferret 's a policeman . ”

39897	40025	40110	40110	Chloe	45	“ Of course ! Not enough to drown the aunts and uncles , but just enough to remind them how superior they are to the follies of youth , and to incite them to show how much more cheerful they can be , in their maturity , than these restless — Oh , Len , I 'm talking like a goody - goody book . Come on ; let 's make a list of who we 'll ask , and what we will give them to eat , and who shall sit beside who , and then we 'll decide where they 're to eat it . We 'll save up the peaches for the party . There are three hundred and twenty - six of them . ”
40099	40108	40110	40110	Chloe	45	“ It must be the drawing - room , ”
40115	40141	40150	40150	I	0	“ and we must have little tables , with candles and paper shades , like in a hotel , and everything carved on a sideboard . ”

40155	40194	40337	40337	Chloe	45	“ Oh , we can make a sideboard in three minutes — those packing - cases Yolande 's china came in . We 'll make a big one while we 're about it — a really impressive sideboard . ”
40320	40336	40337	40337	Chloe	45	“ If we took every pikky we 've got out of all the other rooms , ”
40340	40388	40512	40512	Chloe	45	“ they 'd hardly show in this great barn . There ought to be some idea — Oh , Len , of course ! wreaths of evergreens right up high — oh!—and a frieze of pink muslin , and the evergreens in loops and swags . Delicious ! ”

41317	41345	41354	41354	I	0	“ whatever my faults may be , I 'm not intelligent . That 's what the police always are when they ca n't find out the murderer . ”

41401	41432	41440	41440	Yolande	52	“ Len , you 're like Nero , talking about unimportant things when — No , nothing 's burning . Yolande , if you do n't tell him I shall . ”
41433	41438	41456	41456	her	52	“ It 's nothing , ”
41464	41501	41397	41397	Chloe	45	“ It 's really nothing — only you gave me carte blanche as your land agent , and I 've let the big cottage for you — not Prosser's — the one on the other side . ”
41502	41539	41397	41397	Chloe	45	“ You have ? Chloe , I know it seems the basest ingratitude to Yolande , but — think of Prosser , fairest of land agents , and tell me frankly , has he any references ? ”
41540	41570	41456	41456	her	52	“ He simply bristles with them . His bank , Coutts 's , and his father , a cotton - broker of absolute eminence , were enough for me . ”
41571	41603	41397	41397	Chloe	45	“ But where did you catch him ? The sons of cotton - brokers with balances at Coutts 's are not found in every bush . How did you do it ? ”
41604	41703	41713	41713	Chloe	45	“ C'est tout simple . I advertised . You never thought of that ? No . Well , we all have our limitations . Chloe , if you let him throw bread at me I shall tell the tenant the house is unhealthy , and he wo n't take it . I advertised , he answered . I interviewed the bank and the cottonbroker,—incredibly eminent he really is ; I saw it at once . The man himself is a man of action . The agreement , signed , lies warm at this moment against Chloe 's heart . ”
41704	41711	41713	41713	Chloe	45	“ It 's in her Gladstone , ”

45846	45874	45905	45905	she	45	“ Oh , let me get away . And take him away and clean him , wo n't you ? It 's all got into his eyes . ”

45995	46002	46004	46005	Uncle Bletherthwaite	108	“ Asking for taps like this , ”
46007	46027	46037	46037	I	0	“ is no excuse for this unwarrantable intrusion into the midst of a family gathering . This young person — ”
46028	46036	46043	46043	herself	52	“ A member of the family gathering , ”
46058	46114	46123	46124	Aunt George	100	“ Oh , please do n't be alarmed . There were some pails of red stuff put aside for the fruit trees , and this gentleman , who lives next door , unfortunately came in contact with them ; and I had remembered the pails were there , and was just going to attend to them ”
46116	46121	46163	46163	She	52	“ In that dress ! ”
46131	46162	46172	46172	her	52	“ and I brought him in to be washed . I think I myself will also wash . Good - night . I am so sorry to have alarmed you . ”
46180	46213	46309	46310	Aunt George	100	“ Their carriages are beginning to come . Leave Chloe to get rid of them . That man must be washed , or he 'll die or be blind , or something . ”
46324	46329	46383	46391	A pale and cautious Yolande in a white wrapper	1086	“ goings - on , ”
46397	46429	46468	46468	she	52	“ Are they gone ? Oh , give him lemons — many lemons ; I 've got it all off my face with that . My hands are past praying for . ”

46502	46523	46530	46530	she	52	“ I have borne enough ; this ensanguined masquerade requires , as Uncle Bletherthwaite says , some explanation more convincing — ”
46524	46529	46556	46556	She	52	“ Oh , bother ! ”
46533	46555	46567	46568	Aunt George	100	“ I am a dog , and an outcast , and an abject idiot — and I 'll tell you everything . ”
46580	46642	46654	46654	Chloe	45	“ I know you 'll scorn me forever . But ‘ a fault that 's owned is half atoned , ’ and I 'll own my fault . It was only my only and always fault — I have but the one , you know — being too jolly clever by half . I 'll never try to do anything again . ”
46643	46653	46654	46654	Chloe	45	“ Tell us quickly , before he gets clean , ”
46657	46683	46692	46692	Yolande	52	“ Who is he ? What was it ? How did it happen ? Quick — before he bursts upon us with his clean face . ”
46684	46690	46692	46692	Yolande	52	“ There 's no hurry , ”
46703	46793	46812	46812	Chloe	45	“ You need n't be afraid of seeing his face clean yet awhile . Well , when you talked about the fruit - thief , I thought to myself , if one could only mark the thief thoroughly , it would be as good as catching him , because you could wire to all the police stations , ‘ Lost , Stolen , or Strayed , a Pink - spotted Fruit - stealer ! ’ I thought I was quite clever , and really I was a mere lunatic . ”
46803	46810	46812	46812	Chloe	45	“ It was a good idea , ”
46817	46826	46692	46692	Yolande	52	“ and so you took that pink dye — ”
46827	46915	46925	46925	Chloe	45	“ Yes . I hid two pails of it , one among the currant - bushes and one under the quince - tree . And then when we were in the garden I saw a flash , and I knew some one had struck a match — to see where the peaches were , I thought . Really , of course , it must have been this wretched man lighting his hateful pipe . So I stole away , and I got the big brass garden syringe . ”
46916	46923	46925	46925	Chloe	45	“ It was a good idea , ”
46931	46934	46998	46998	She	45	“ Well ? ”
46935	46997	46998	46998	She	45	“ Well — oh , then I stalked him ; and even when I was close to him I never knew he was just a human being in flannels . I thought he was playing ghost , and I said to myself , ‘ All the better to mark you on , my friend ! ’ Oh , it was funny . ”
47004	47253	46925	46925	Chloe	45	“ There was I creeping along with my syringe full charged , and the pail in my other hand — held well out , because of my gown — and he , poor soul , sauntering along in the shadows of the nut - walk , thinking nothing less than that some one was advancing with his pink doom . When he was a couple of yards off I fired a volley — slap in his face — and turned to run . He swore — but I forgive him that . My pail caught in a bough , and went over his feet , for he jumped towards the noise ; he is not a coward . He caught hold of my dress , in the dark ( he 's torn a yard out at the gathers , but it does n't matter ; the dress was ruined anyway ) , and as soon as I had heard his voice , even though it was swearing — I knew what I 'd done , and I said : ‘ It 's all a mistake . I 'm Yolande Riseborough . Ca n't you see ? ’ for he was staggering about . And then I saw he could n't , and I said : ‘ Come and be cleaned . Give me your hand . ’ And so I brought him in , and on the way we tumbled over the other pail . And nous voici — ”
47254	47261	46998	46998	She	45	“ You know him , then ? ”
47262	47300	46998	46998	She	45	“ Know him ? Any one would have known him , when it was too late . Oh , my broken heart ! What will you do to me when you know ? He 'll never stay — ”
47301	47318	47332	47332	Yolande	52	“ If you play at sphinxes another moment I shall slap you . Who is it ? ”
47319	47330	47332	47332	Yolande	52	“ It 's your new tenant . That 's all , ”
47343	47423	47930	47930	I	0	“ You know , permission to walk in the garden was given as one of the extra attractions of the cottage . I 'll never try to be clever again . I got you the tenant — cotton - broking lineage , and Coutts 's bank , and all — and now I 've squirted him with red dye out of a brass garden syringe , and he will never forgive it ; and I wish I was dead . ”
47924	47929	47930	47930	I	0	“ He 's wonderful , ”
47933	47938	47949	47949	Chloe	45	“ The right sort . ”
47939	47947	47949	47949	Chloe	45	“ One of our kind — yes , ”
47951	48002	48027	48027	I	0	“ some people are , do n't you know , and some are n't ; quite nice people , too , sometimes , curiously enough . And people who are n't very clever are , now and then . Besides that , he 's charming — isn't he , Yolande ? ”
48017	48026	48027	48027	I	0	“ What a night of adventures for us ! ”
48030	48045	48055	48055	Yolande	52	“ and , oh , my only hat ! what a night for him ! ”
48046	48053	48055	48055	Yolande	52	“ He may think himself lucky , ”
48057	48071	48087	48087	Chloe	45	“ How angel - good you were to him , Chloe ! Goodnight . ”
48072	48085	48087	48087	Chloe	45	“ Do you think it was a success — the real party ? ”
48091	48104	48112	48112	Yolande	52	“ They could n't believe that about the fruit and the dye . ”
48105	48110	48173	48173	She	45	“ It was true , ”
48114	48172	48195	48195	I	0	“ so I suppose they could n't . Oh yes , it 's all right ; give them something to talk about for months . It was a splendid party , Chloe , though I did n't have anything to do with it . I 'll never put my finger into any one else 's pie again ! ”
48187	48194	48195	48195	I	0	“ Oh yes , you will , ”
48198	48242	48176	48176	her	45	“ for the pie 's our good ! You see , this was such a very pink pie — and , besides , it was just that sort of an unimportant detail that does n't suit your genius . But it 's taught — ”
48243	48255	48195	48195	I	0	“ Taught me a lesson ? Yes , rub it in ! ”

48596	48612	48625	48625	I	0	“ But they 're good , are n't they — rather good , I mean ? ”

You do n't know how unhappy it makes me . Wait till she 's gone . Perhaps the ghost wo n't write any more , now it knows you do n't like it . ”

Yes — I see you do — and — But I 'm quite pleased when the ghost touches up my drawings , or even when it does them for me altogether . Dear ghost !

49893	49974	49982	49982	Yolande	52	“ Our property is exigent . We love it , and it presumes on our affection and makes us do things for it . It 's like doing things for one 's own child . Mothers like to wash and dress their own babies , and they do n't think it waste of time to spend hours over it — even if they might be earning money instead and keeping whole armies of competent professional nurses . Now your property — ”

If you do like it — well , you do , and so do the other half of the best women in the world . That 's all there is to it . And you do like sport .

We toiled joyously to the top of the house , I with the tray and Chloe with the little copper coal - scuttle whose broken handle we meant to get mended when we could afford it . We chose a fair - sized room , out of the many disused ones , opened the shutters , and dumped down our treasures on the floor . Our old tendency to furnish one room at the expense of another came irresistibly sistibly upon us , and we ransacked the house , carrying off to the lumber - room everything we could possibly not want . The house looked very bare when we had done , and for weeks I found myself toiling up those stairs in search of some necessary for one of us which the other had confiscated as “

We had known well enough that our income was increasing , that we no longer had , as Chloe said , to look all round every shilling . We had told Yolande , gleefully , the amount of every check we had received . But we had kept no accounts . She had . We all three fell into each other 's arms , or something very like it . “

A stray furze - bush or two at the end of our paddock broke into golden flower , and the skylarks sang in the pale blue above the orchard . The 20th was a day of cloudless beauty , and even in the midst of my mental congratulations to the members of the Antiquarian Society on their royal weather , I found room for a pang of sympathy pathy for those among them who might have had their skates ground . I recurred again that day , I remember , to our old life at the Bandbox . We were sitting in the loafery , now made cosey with curtains and a big wood fire . Chloe sat sewing in her rocking - chair . She had had some verses that morning , and , bad as they were , they had pleased her . There were seven stanzas , I remember . The first two were quite ordinary , and the other five got sillier and sillier , till at the end they were a mere jingle of nonsense — a sort of nursery rhyme , mostly written in the “
58298	58380	58392	58392	you	47	” The poem — Chloe really did call it a poem — began something like this : TO CHLOE AT WORK She liked it all , even the nonsense of the last five stanzas , and she said that she liked it none the less because it happened to be written on the backs of a green - grocer 's bill , the voting - card of a candidate for the school board , and two odd envelopes . She said : “
58402	58403	58404	58404	You	0	” “
58412	58416	58404	58404	You	0	” I said , “
58428	58429	58404	58404	You	0	” “
58439	58443	58450	58450	you	47	” she said . “
58460	58461	58463	58463	I	0	” “
58468	58469	58476	58476	you	47	” “
58487	58488	58476	58476	you	47	” “
58496	58605	58606	58608	Those Antiquarian brutes	1298	” she cried , jumping up and dropping scissors , thimble , tapemeasure , and a mass of lace and muslin . When I had picked everything up we went to the window . The creeper 's leaves were gone now , and we stood between dull red curtains and looked out on the misty garden , where the dead leaves lay , patches of wet gold and brown in the faint sunlight , and where a robin on a leafless apple - tree was singing his very best , and pretending to the rooks in the elms that he was a thrush disguised in a scarlet waistcoat . “
58610	58616	58639	58641	the Junior Blackheath	131	” I said , presently , “
58646	58647	58652	58653	the Antiquaries	1300	” “
58655	58659	58727	58727	I	0	” Chloe cried . “
58725	58726	58743	58743	they	1298	” “
58737	58738	58790	58790	myself	0	” “
58792	58903	58790	58790	myself	0	” She ran down the stairs , slipped her feet into the wooden sabots that she keeps for sudden winter garden excursions , and stumped off angrily down the path under the cedars . I took a short - cut between Jim 's celery - trenches . Chloe is terrible in her wrath , but if it grows too hot it boils over in tears of rage ; and I did not wish Chloe to cry , and I not there . The invaders were grouped round the sundial . All had their backs to us , and one of them was reading aloud . I caught a few words : “
58951	58994	59076	59076	children	627	” Then the reader heard the unmistakable threat in the emphatic stump , stump of Chloe 's wooden shoes , and stopped short . Her eyes were angry , her mouth expressed inhospitable intentions . I thought I heard a murmur of , “
58999	59075	59076	59076	children	627	” from the reader , but the next moment he had stepped towards my wife and taken off his cap with an oddly graceful flourish . He was a boy ; there were other boys , who followed his lead in cap - doffing . There were girls , too , rosy - faced little girls in highwayman coats and scarlet Tam - o'-Shanters . The whole invading company were , as Chloe had said , “
59078	59084	59086	59086	you	1306	” And all wore spectacles . “
59095	59101	59106	59106	you	1306	” said Chloe , severely . “
59109	59141	59193	59193	We	1309	” Her voice is very pretty , even when she is angry , and she was not nearly so angry as she had been before the boys took their caps off . “
59151	59192	59193	59193	We	1309	” asked the smallest boy of all , goggling at her through his spectacles , and speaking in an off - hand but perfectly agreeable manner . One of the girls shook him gently , and bade him shut up . “
59199	59208	59250	59250	I	0	” said the boy who had been reading . “
59255	59287	59250	59250	I	0	” The prettiest of the red - capped girls took the spectacles , and the boy felt in several pockets , while I drew near to offer Chloe my moral support . “
59292	59341	59250	59250	I	0	” he said , at last , disentangling a dingy paper from a mass of string , matches , envelopes , putty , and cobbler 's wax , and , with really a rather nice bow , he handed to Chloe — my letter to the Antiquarian Society ! “
59350	59354	59358	59359	Mr. Turnbull	130	” she said . “
59361	59362	59385	59385	We	1310	” “
59368	59384	59412	59412	I	0	” said a younger boy — a thin , pale , anxious - looking child . “
59420	59437	59490	59490	Oswald	136	” Chloe put her hands to her head with a gesture of despair . I said : “
59477	59489	59492	59492	you	136	” There was a silence . Then the eldest girl said , “
59495	59540	59557	59557	her	459	” The boy who had been reading twisted his cap , and stood uneasily on one foot . But almost at once he planted his feet firmly on the ground and began , looking Chloe straight in the eyes with a most disarming frankness . “
59560	59561	59557	59557	her	459	” “
59567	59573	59557	59557	her	459	” said Chloe , unexpectedly . “
59577	59578	59608	59608	him	1311	” “
59598	59606	59715	59715	you	1326	Albert”—he pushed forward a shy boy in velvet knickerbockers—“and
59721	59727	59715	59715	you	1326	” The voice was reproachful . “
59730	59752	59754	59754	you	1326	” I said , completely melted by this unexpected recognition of my — or the ghost's — talent as a writer . “
59759	59760	59769	59769	I	0	” “
59762	59768	59879	59879	he	1311	not”—his tone was somewhat injured . “

59899	59926	59958	59958	We	1310	” said Chloe , smiling ing ; and as she smiled I could see how deeply all present fell in love with her on the instant . “
59956	59957	59958	59958	We	1310	” “
59964	59982	59958	59958	We	1310	” said the eldest girl — she was a little prim , and not so pretty as the others—”only
60001	60002	60004	60004	you	1326	” “
60009	60034	60004	60004	you	1326	” I asked . They all laughed . It was a very pleasant sound , this peal of young laughter in our old garden . “
60038	60044	60004	60004	you	1326	” said the prettiest girl , “
60076	60077	60004	60004	you	1326	” “
60082	60086	60100	60100	We	1310	” I said . “

60105	60134	60170	60171	Albert Morrison	135	” the biggest boy said , with a sort of shy pride , as if he were confessing , in his modesty 's despite , to royal lineage . “
60178	60179	60189	60189	you	1326	” “
60191	60211	60189	60189	you	1326	” asked Chloe , abruptly , picking up her blue train and fixing her feet in her wooden shoes . “
60231	60232	60233	60233	I	0	” “
60237	60249	60259	60259	I	0	” said the smallest boy , before the others could answer . “
60270	60284	60303	60303	I	0	” The others murmured thanks , and we left them to their play . “
60291	60302	60320	60321	all children	1336	” said Chloe , when we were out of earshot . “
60324	60325	60326	60326	They	1336	” “
60341	60351	60396	60396	I	0	” I said , enunciating lightly a tremendous dogma . “
60394	60395	60396	60396	I	0	” “
60399	60403	60475	60475	Oswald	136	” she said ; “
60473	60474	60486	60486	Alice	134	” “
60480	60484	60777	60777	their	1343	” said I , “
60512	60774	60777	60777	their	1343	” I left Chloe laying the table for eleven in the white parlor . When I came back the cloth was spread , but Chloe had vanished . I found her in the garden submerged to the shoulders in a wave of children , and she carried nine pairs of spectacles in her hand . We all went in to lunch . I was now a mere outsider . Chloe , by some art unknown to me , had become one of the children , and was the most childlike child of all . The others really were not bad children . I do n't think I ever met any so full of enthusiastic energy . As a permanency , they might have been a little wearing , for , strong in Chloe 's extraordinary assumption of esprit de corps , they now threw away all shyness , and talked to us with simple directness of adventures , of contemporary literature , of the ways of Providence , and their own vital ambitions . They had a very full flow of conversation , and a much larger vocabulary than I remember having at their age . What struck me most was their confident assumption that , now we knew them , we could not help liking them ; and the assumption was , I own , justified . This assumption was particularly marked in Oswald . He evidently thought a good deal of himself , but , as I could not but reluctantly acknowledge , with some justice ! They were extremely “
60780	60878	60880	60880	you	1344	” as Mary said afterwards , but never vulgar . And they were very much funnier than they meant to be . The lunch , for which Chloe had madly brought out the best green - and - gold table - centre , charmed them . I had not thought that Chloe could be so thoroughly inspired with any menu . When no one could eat any more , the children looked at each other , and Dora , the prim one , said , quite unconscious of the evidence of rehearsal with which her speech bristled , “
60895	60896	60912	60912	I	0	” “
60905	60911	60958	60958	I	0	” said the pale boy . “
60941	60957	60970	60970	We	1345	” While I was getting these I heard the prim child say anxiously to Chloe : “
60976	60977	60987	60987	I	0	” “
60990	60998	61003	61003	his	1346	” said the stout child they called H.O. “
61006	61045	61003	61003	his	1346	” There was an awkward pause while the pale child sucked my pencil and rolled his eyes . He made the most shocking grimaces I ever saw , but when Chloe turned anxiously to Oswald , he said , “
61066	61084	61086	61086	you	1347	” Presently he stopped writing , folded the paper very small , and said suddenly and earnestly , “
61093	61102	61103	61103	We	1348	” We owned our indigence in this respect . “
61110	61114	61116	61116	you	1347	” he said . “
61122	61123	61116	61116	you	1347	” “
61130	61141	61163	61163	you	1351	” said Chloe , with a glorious inspiration , adding , “
61166	61190	61163	61163	you	1351	” Noël pressed the paper into Chloe 's hand and they rushed from the room , and as they went I heard the words “
61195	61202	61163	61163	you	1351	” I drew a long breath . “
61207	61211	61228	61228	They	627	” I said . “
61221	61227	61163	61163	you	1351	” said Chloe , wistfully . “
61231	61239	61163	61163	you	1351	” I said , kissing her ears , “
61244	61252	61255	61257	little old wife	1355	” She gave me a doubtful glance . “
61259	61263	61281	61281	They	627	” I said , “
61279	61280	61281	61281	They	627	” “
61288	61308	61281	61281	They	627	” she said , and then we read Noël 's poem : TO THE BLUE PRINCESS LADY WITH THE LUNCH “
61315	61319	61330	61331	The dear	1360	” I said . “
61328	61329	61330	61331	The dear	1360	” “
61333	61337	61352	61353	extraordinary children	1361	” she said . “
61355	61399	61400	61400	They	627	” I could hear the wave of children surging wildly about the house . I lighted a cigarette , and strove for calm . I seemed to have been living in the embrace of a friendly tornado . Chloe looked at me anxiously . “
61404	61413	61417	61417	they	627	” she said , for the fourth time . “
61423	61424	61435	61435	They	627	” “
61431	61434	61479	61479	Anybody	1368	” said I. “
61477	61478	61479	61479	Anybody	1368	” “
61483	61487	61489	61489	I	0	” she said , “
61496	61699	61700	61700	I	0	” There was a silence in the house . I went to see whether the exploring party had drowned itself in the rain - water cistern , which is just the sort of thing that kind of child would do . No ; Mary said they were exploring the cellars . As she spoke I heard a thunderous report reverberating below . Our cellars are large and vaulted ; from recollections of my childhood , I could conceive that they might seem well worth exploring . But I had not all Chloe 's confidence in these strange children . From the little I had seen of them I felt that they were quite capable of organizing a Guy Fawkes play , and carrying it out with scrupulous , enthusiastic fidelity if one of their number should happen , as seemed only too likely , to have any matches and loose gunpowder in his pocket . Yolande had just come from town , and by a curious coincidence our tenant had come on the same train . I left them talking to Chloe , and went down the cellar steps . Half - way down I was met by an incredibly cobwebby boy . “
61707	61713	61804	61804	We	1371	” he said , eagerly . “
61810	61890	61892	61892	you	1370	” One - half at least of my foreboding was justified . I wondered where they had dropped the hot heads of all the matches they had used . I got some candles and matches , and the cobwebbed child , whose name appeared to be Dickie , led me to a cellar where barrels were piled . Behind them I could just discern the shadowy outline of a door , from which came an intermittent knocking and voices : “
61896	61897	61899	61899	you	1370	” “
61905	61906	61934	61934	I	0	” “
61943	61944	62273	62273	I	0	” “
61958	62272	62273	62273	I	0	” There were three boys still in evidence , and the tenant had followed me to see the sport . The girls were as energetic as the boys , and one by one we rolled the barrels away . Curious that Chloe and I had never looked behind those barrels . The door was not fastened . It opened easily , and a shower of dust and cobwebs fell on the heads of the explorers who first pressed forward . From my soul I congratulated these children . Even to such an adventurous band as this an adventure so exciting could not happen every day . They were quite right . There was furniture in the inner cellar , odds and ends stowed away , to make room for new stuff , by busy , thrifty hands now long since folded in lavish idleness — hands that , in their life - day , could never bear to destroy or to waste . We carried the things up - stairs — all but the vast box - mangle and one other thing which I said I would carry up myself later . We bore into the kitchen , and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Chloe and Yolande , and the contemptuous temptuous ones of Mary , a full - sized oak dresser — in four pieces ; five chestnut - wood chairs , more or less dilapidated ; an oak settle — the seat was broken , but , oh , how our hearts rejoiced in the severe beauty of its panelled back ! three ladder - backed chairs — seats gone ; a large gate - table ; an elm kneading - trough ; and the magnificent wreck of a carved four - post bedstead ! The children were as delighted as we were , which is saying a good deal . “
62278	62285	62307	62307	you	1376	” said the poet , triumphantly . “
62324	62449	62452	62452	Len	47	” A most discerning child , truly ! When the children had been partially cleaned , our tenant invited them all to tea at his cottage . Yolande and Chloe went to help . When they were gone I went down to the cellar and fetched the thing I said I would carry myself . I bore it up to the loafery and cleaned it , and polished it , and mended it a little , and set it by the hearth , in the glow of the fire ; and that evening when Yolande and the tenant were deep in chess , I beckoned Chloe , and took her up to the loafery , and , lighting the candles , bade her look . “
62454	62465	62488	62488	I	0	” she cried , throwing her arms round my neck , “
62486	62487	62488	62488	I	0	” “
62499	62503	62545	62545	Len	47	” I said , “
62509	62518	62545	62545	Len	47	” She fell on her knees beside it . “
62557	62558	62545	62545	Len	47	” “
62565	62569	62594	62594	I	0	” I said . “
62592	62593	62607	62607	Len	47	” “
62597	62606	62623	62623	they	1381	” she said , coming nearer to me . “
62642	62789	62791	62791	me	0	” Presently my wife took me into our room , and , unlocking the corner drawer , showed me all that was in it . Little , little things . CHRISTMAS in the Red House was charming . It made us feel like pictures on Christmas cards . Chloe and I flatly refused to have anything to do with the decorations . We had had enough of evergreens when we decorated our drawing - room with the loops and swags for the great house - warming party . And rather than we would touch box or yew or laurel or holly again , the Red House should go undecorated . We said so , but our tenant insisted that no decorations at Christmas would be the first step towards the downfall of the British constitution and the death - blow to the naval supremacy of England . “
62795	62799	62851	62851	I	0	” he said . “
62854	62855	62858	62858	I	0	” “
62862	62866	62894	62894	Mary	75	” said Yolande . “
62898	62899	62902	62902	I	0	” “
62905	62909	62923	62923	my	0	” said Chloe . “
62936	62937	62923	62923	my	0	” “
62944	62948	62950	62950	you	53	” I said . “
62956	62957	62950	62950	you	53	” “
62963	62969	63157	63157	My	0	” she answered , gayly . “
62979	63156	63157	63157	My	0	” I felt a pang . Was it possible that Chloe had any suspicion ? Could she possibly guess that it was I , and not Yolande , who finished drawing her pictures for her ? No , she certainly could not . And I more than half wanted to tell her my secret . Yet I could not make up my mind to part with it . I had nursed it in my heart till it had grown very dear and precious . We left Yolande enthroned on the settle , di recting the labors of our tenant , but when the gong summoned us to tea and the wages - of - superintendence - scones , we found our tenant working at one end of the wreath , and Yolande busy at the other . It was not such a very long wreath as to have needed two pairs of hands , either . To do Miss Riseborough justice , she looked very much ashamed of this lapse from the principles of a lifetime . “
63163	63170	63172	63172	I	0	” she made haste to say , “
63203	63204	63172	63172	I	0	” “
63209	63213	63232	63232	one	1622	” I said . “
63240	63241	63310	63310	We	1393	” “
63315	63343	63310	63310	We	1393	” After tea the work was resumed , and the hall , stairs , and white parlor were all hung with shining wreaths before dinner - time . “
63348	63357	63372	63372	her	52	” said Chloe to me , in confidence . “
63375	63376	63372	63372	her	52	” “
63390	63394	63372	63372	her	52	” I said , “
63407	63408	63372	63372	her	52	” “
63414	63418	63539	63539	she	52	” she said , “
63543	63544	63652	63652	youth	1398	” “
63559	63647	63652	63652	youth	1398	” Yolande was spending Christmas at the Red House , and , it being Christmas Eve , the tenant dined with us . We had a merry evening . We had lighted a huge fire in the big , empty drawing - room where the piano was ; Chloe played waltzes , and Yolande danced with me and with the tenant . When the dancing was over Chloe and I sat by the fire and the others went out to look at the stars from the balcony . “
63654	63658	63677	63677	Chloe	45	” I sighed . “
63667	63676	63756	63756	She	52	” said Chloe , prosaically . I whispered : “
63762	63763	63756	63756	She	52	” “
63770	63774	63788	63788	him	1403	” said Chloe . “
63779	63784	63813	63813	I	0	” I went on , “
63811	63812	63813	63813	I	0	” “
63825	63829	63842	63842	Castor	146	” she said . “
63846	63847	64116	64116	He	1408	” “
63930	64053	64116	64116	He	1408	” So we spoke out into the starlit twilight of the balcony , and begged to be excused , and then we crept up - stairs and raked together the red embers of our loafery fire , and put logs on and crouched happily in low chairs on the hearthrug of our very own fire . Chloe knitted and I smoked happily and quietly till it seemed that we must no longer delay to go down and speed our parting tenant . It was , in fact , eleven o'clock . I was just knocking out my pipe on the hob when a light tap on the door mingled with my own tapping , and Yolande 's face looked round the door . “
64057	64061	64107	64107	He	1408	” we said , “
64065	64106	64116	64116	He	1408	” But we wondered , because Yolande had never , since the day when in our pride we first showed it to her , crossed the threshold of that room . Now she came in and closed the door softly . “
64111	64115	64116	64116	He	1408	” she said . “
64129	64164	64116	64116	He	1408	” She came across the room and sat down on the hearth - rug at Chloe 's feet . She leaned her arm on Chloe 's knee and laid her face upon the arm . “
64175	64183	64197	64197	I	0	” she said , after a silence . “
64205	64219	64197	64197	I	0	” Chloe and I successfully avoided each other 's eyes . Another silence . “
64225	64231	64197	64197	I	0	” I said , clumsily . “
64237	64241	64299	64299	you	1409	” she said . “
64311	64337	64338	64338	I	0	” We said , with as good an appearance of perfect ignorance as we could command , that we were sure we did not know . “
64345	64349	64338	64338	I	0	” she said . “
64352	64382	64383	64383	You	1409	” It was difficult to express congratulatory surprise — so difficult that we failed utterly . Chloe threw her arms round Yolande 's neck and began to laugh softly . “
64395	64399	64435	64435	you	1409	” she said . “
64441	64442	64435	64435	you	1409	” “
64446	64463	64468	64474	my pretty , clever , foolish child	1417	” said Yolande , in a suddenly changed voice ; but she returned Chloe 's kisses . “
64476	64480	64517	64517	you	1409	” said Chloe . “
64509	64510	64517	64517	you	1409	” “
64519	64526	64563	64565	a Girton girl	1420	” said Miss Riseborough , softly . “
64571	64572	64563	64565	a Girton girl	1420	” “
64581	64607	64608	64608	I	0	” Yolande 's voice was softer than ever . I felt in my bones that for some reason Chloe 's gentle enthusiasm did not please . “
64617	64634	64654	64654	you	1409	” I said , for I felt that I was out of place in this confidence . “
64640	64652	64654	64654	you	1409	” said Yolande , with a curious stiffness in her voice . “
64667	64668	64670	64671	the tenant	2381	” “
64680	64685	64670	64671	the tenant	2381	” said my wife . “
64690	64691	64692	64692	You	1409	” “
64697	64704	64710	64715	a man you have never seen	1422	” Yolande said , very deliberately . “
64717	64718	64710	64715	a man you have never seen	1422	” “
64721	64722	64724	64724	I	0	” “
64737	64740	64754	64755	Percival Forbes	147	” said I. “
64746	64753	64754	64755	Percival Forbes	147	” There was a slight pause . “
64757	64786	64818	64818	I	0	” she said . Our tenant 's name was something quite different . A silence followed that none of us knew how to break . Chloe spoke first . “
64822	64823	64818	64818	I	0	” “
64829	64840	64851	64851	Yolande	52	” said Yolande , in an odd , stifled voice ; “
64849	64850	64853	64853	I	0	” “
64862	64871	64887	64887	I	0	” Chloe was making horseshoes in her forehead . “
64896	64897	64912	64912	I	0	” “
64922	64940	65085	65085	you	52	” Chloe stroked her hair timidly , and I , in sheer embarrassment , refilled my pipe . “
65041	65042	65085	65085	you	52	” “
65045	65052	65054	65054	I	0	” said Chloe , with conviction . “
65064	65068	65092	65092	you	52	” I said , “
65095	65096	65092	65092	you	52	” “
65100	65123	65092	65092	you	52	” she said , remembering , and with a smile that seemed to me unmeaning she folded her hands over her heart . “
65128	65132	65137	65137	you	52	” I said , “
65152	65153	65137	65137	you	52	” “
65157	65164	65184	65184	You	52	” said Yolande , still smiling . “
65175	65183	65233	65233	my	0	” I said , in some irritation . “
65230	65231	65246	65246	He	2381	” “
65244	65245	65246	65246	He	2381	” “

65282	65286	65293	65293	me	0	” said Yolande ; “
65295	65296	65293	65293	me	0	” “
65302	65306	65331	65331	me	0	” I said ; “

65351	65362	65376	65376	he	2381	” said Yolande , in a small , meek voice , “
65383	65384	65376	65376	he	2381	” “
65389	65393	65448	65448	Len	47	” I said , “
65436	65447	65464	65464	you	47	” Yolande was silent a moment . Then she said : “
65473	65474	65475	65475	You	47	” “
65485	65492	65495	65495	Len	47	” said my wife , gently . “
65502	65503	65513	65513	one	1622	” “
65506	65512	65556	65556	I	0	” said Yolande , slowly , “
65554	65555	65559	65559	my	0	” “
65562	65566	65587	65587	you	47	” said I , “

65595	65601	65587	65587	you	47	” she said , softly . “
65604	65629	65587	65587	you	47	” Then she flashed a dazzling , illuminating smile at us and put her chin in the air in the prettiest , proudest way . “
65637	65685	65818	65818	I	0	” I think I may be pardoned for taking Yolande by the shoulders and shaking her as she held out to Chloe 's eyes a trembling left hand on which shone the gold signet ring which I had noted a hundred times on our tenant 's finger . “
65832	65833	65834	65834	I	0	” “
65843	65847	66089	66089	you	1452	” said Chloe . “
65909	66087	66089	66089	you	1452	” When they had gone I turned idly to the table . There lay an unfinished drawing of my wife's — a child with an impossibly foreshortened arm carrying a jug in two dimensions , on a head like a deformed cocoanut . I looked at it for a little while and then set to work . The sketch was spirited , and I had a certain pleasure in working it out , a pleasure so engrossing that I did not hear the door open , and my heart leaped like a fish with a pike after it as two hands fell on my shoulders , and I knew that my secret was discovered — that henceforth not Yolande , not the ghost , but I myself must carry the praise or blame due to the finisher of Chloe 's pictures . I turned my head and kissed the hand that lay on my left shoulder , the hand with my wedding - ring on it . She ruffled my hair with the other hand , and , “
66093	66099	66089	66089	you	1452	” she said , simply . “
66104	66105	66169	66169	you	1452	” “
66166	66167	66175	66175	you	1452	” “
66180	66200	66203	66203	you	1452	” I said , turning in my chair so that my arm could go round her as she stood . “
66208	66212	66276	66276	I	0	” she said , “
66274	66275	66314	66314	you	1452	” “

66329	66339	66424	66424	You	0	” she said , blinking at me in surprise . “

66436	66441	66498	66498	you	418	” I reminded her . “

66510	66516	66518	66518	you	418	” I said , confidently . “

66529	66533	66549	66549	I	0	” she said ; “

66626	66630	66661	66661	Yolande	52	” I said , “
66663	66670	66700	66700	I	0	” We had both forgotten her . “
66718	66719	66700	66700	I	0	” “
66722	66725	66700	66700	I	0	” said I. “
66734	66735	66860	66861	the pupils	1479	” “
66854	66858	66860	66861	the pupils	1479	” I laughed . “
66863	66864	66880	66880	She	52	” “
66894	66895	66944	66944	I	0	” “

66955	66960	66946	66946	you	1484	” said my wife . “

66974	66975	66976	66976	We	1482	” “
66986	66990	66976	66976	We	1482	” I said . “
67016	67022	67080	67080	Yolande	52	” She frowned a little . “
67048	67049	67080	67080	Yolande	52	” “
67054	67058	67080	67080	Yolande	52	” I said , “

67101	67105	67134	67135	a burglar	1838	” she said , “

67146	67150	67176	67176	she	366	” I said . “

67197	67201	67208	67208	she	366	” said Chloe . “

67252	67253	67254	67254	He	1487	” “
67259	67263	67285	67285	I	0	” said Chloe , “
67294	67310	67285	67285	I	0	” When I came back she was sitting in her favorite little rocking - chair . “
67319	67323	67366	67366	you	47	” she said . “
67329	67344	67387	67387	I	0	” said I , lowering myself to the hearth - rug at her feet . “
67385	67386	67387	67387	I	0	” “
67395	67415	67430	67430	me	0	” I said , taking her hands in mine . They were cold , and they trembled a little . “

67441	67449	67469	67469	You	47	” she said , trying to laugh . “
67484	67499	67569	67569	I	0	” I told her several . Then we sat silent . Presently I said : “
67567	67568	67569	67569	I	0	” “
67578	67591	67614	67614	I	0	” She spoke with a gleam of soft mischief in her eyes . “

67626	67630	67614	67614	I	0	” I said . “

67754	67766	67769	67769	I	0	” Even then I did n't see . She rose suddenly . “
67776	67780	67781	67781	You	0	” she said . “
67790	67796	67797	67797	You	47	” I rose , too . “
67805	67813	67819	67819	you	47	” I said , holding her hands . “
67824	67838	67819	67819	you	47	” She put her arms round my neck and whispered in my ear . “
67842	67846	67863	67863	Cross	149	” she cried , “
67861	67862	67971	67971	me	0	” “
67976	67991	67992	67992	I	0	” I put her back in the rocking - chair and knelt before her . “
68000	68004	68025	68025	she	52	” she said , “
68039	68040	68025	68025	she	52	” “
68047	68051	68065	68065	Chloe	45	” I echoed . “

68195	68199	68241	68241	Yolande	52	” I said ; “

68515	68552	68504	68504	Us	1512	” said she . YOLANDE was married — she was married at Elmhurst church , Chloe and I her only supporters . And after the wedding we all walked quietly down together from the church and said “
68556	68580	68504	68504	Us	1512	” to them at the door of their cottage , through whose windows the welcoming firelight shone out into the cheerless January dusk . “
68591	68596	68649	68649	Frances	150	” said my wife . “

68939	69157	69167	69169	my regretful optimist	1527	” We were , indeed , fortunate . Chloe 's daring adoption of the Red House as our home had been generously repaid . Instead of being the white elephant as which it had sometimes sought to disguise itself , it was now a credit to us , and an unchanging joy . Our cottages were let , and our garden . Our work in the Red House had been prosperous , the memories that had grown up there were precious , the hopes more precious still . Mary was happier than ever , now that she had a small servant — her slender personality wholly justified by our prosperity and our future — to teach and order about and be kind to . Our lives were peaceful , ordered , incredibly pleasant . And if I still sometimes cleaned a candlestick or a sword , and Chloe now and then washed china or dusted the white parlor , not even Yolande could complain that we neglected our work to indulge in these recreations . Chloe remarked one day that we had grown uninteresting . Our earlier domestic adventures , she declared , might have been made really amusing by a competent narrator , but now nothing happened to us except the things that ought to happen . “
69162	69166	69200	69200	We	1528	” I said , “

69615	69692	69699	69699	they	1539	” We were walking slowly round the garden , where the crocuses showed green and gold , and the birds were singing like mad . The spikes and buds of the daffodils made green patches , and the blue squills were out . The pigeons on the farm - roof were preening their shining breasts , nestling up to each other , repeating unceasingly the pretty , monotonous , proud cry of their pairing - time . “
69703	69707	69730	69730	they	1539	” said Chloe . “
69727	69728	69730	69730	they	1539	” “
69735	69739	69850	69850	I	0	” I said ; “
69823	69824	69886	69886	I	0	” “
69884	69885	69886	69886	I	0	” “
69892	69898	69990	69990	You	1538	” I said , firmly . “
70000	70012	69990	69990	You	1538	” For she was clinging to me and hiding her eyes . “
70016	70022	70130	70130	You	1538	” I heard her say . “
70135	70145	70148	70148	you	1538	” I was silent . Did I not know ? “
70151	70161	70330	70330	I	0	” she went on , holding me more closely . “
70336	70779	70914	70914	I	0	” So we walked and talked . And , indeed , such talk , while it intensified my own aching passion of tenderness and solicitude , did , by its frank revelation of that passion , do more to calm and cheer my wife than all my brave pretence — it was brave — of confident fearlessness had ever done . But I have written already more than is needed . It is because , when I remember that time , I can not well command my thought ; and my pen , seeing its superior officer in mutiny , mutinies too . For it was March now , and the time of our great fear and our great happiness was very near . Strangely enough , after that day it was Chloe who made the brave pretences and I who clung to her , imploring her to teach me her courage and confidence . Once again in the history of the Red House my wife and I had changed parts . The hushed peace that brooded over us folded us in wings too soft and close to let any breath of outside tempest come near . Yolande and the tenant talked to us , as it were , through a soft , warm veil . Our relations — oh , fortunate destiny that was ours!—kept away . Chloe 's mother ( who is as nice as any one could be who is not Chloe , and is twice Chloe 's age ) sprained an opportune ankle and could not come to us as she had intended , and as I had thought I wished . So that my wife and I had these last days — the last , as we alternately prayed and feared — alone together . The doings of Yolande and Yolande 's husband were like a bright , gay embroidery on the rich fabric of our quiet happiness . And the time drew near . It was on the 1st of April — a too appropriate date , as Yolande afterwards bewailed — that Chloe suddenly realized , in an imperative shock , that there was a certain Japanese dressing - jacket pattern without which she could not be happy another moment . She had the stuff to make it , a demurely eccentric Eastern - patterned silk ; she also had the material — a dull , soft blue — for what she called the revers . I suppose a man would call it the lining , but I am not quite sure . So she left a half - written story of the very strongest possible “
70782	70913	70945	70945	you	1552	” ( it was , indeed , for she was to get twenty pounds for the finished article ) to go down to Yolande 's cottage and borrow this priceless pattern which Yolande was known to possess . She had bought it among others for the guidance of the dressmaker who prepared her trousseau . And I , almost without a pang , abandoned a nearly finished drawing to go with her . The buds were gray and green on the trees , on the lilacs the buds were bronze , and carmine on the creeper . The daffodils were out , and the tulips rigid with the energy of pride and promise . Everything that makes the glory of the summer garden was pushing up green leaves and crying : “
70949	71159	70945	70945	you	1552	” The birds ' song was almost as intense as in the first pairing - time . We walked up the neat cottage garden , and we remembered the days of Prosser and the rags and the dead mouse and the mutton - bone . Now the garden was all trim and neat , and the earth had stirred in her sleep and thrown out handfuls of primroses and violets and early red tulips , just to show what she could do , and to remind us what she would do for us when the sun , her lover , had kissed her fully awake . We knocked at the cottage door . It was a very nice knocker — old brass . Yolande — under my guidance — had picked it up for sevenpence at a rag - and - bottle shop in Deptford . There was a long pause . Usually the door was opened almost coincidently with the fall of the knocker by pretty , fair - haired , cheery - faced Mrs. Bates , but now we stood long on the narrow doorstep and heard from within sounds of scuffling and rustling . We had time to see how right Browning was when he said , “
71170	71213	71225	71226	dusty millers	1553	” and how very long before their white perfection come the green pledges of the annunciation lilies . We knocked again . The scuffle or rustle assured us that some one was within . The leisure of our next waiting showed us the auriculas—“honey
71216	71224	71355	71355	I	0	” our grandmothers used to call them ; “
71227	71354	71355	71355	I	0	” the country - folk call them still — glowing in their soft shades of primrose and orange and red and purple . But when one desires , with all one 's soul , the cut - out paper pattern of a Japanese dressing - jacket for which one has already the material , even auriculas can not charm away desire for long . This time it was Chloe who knocked ; she knocked vehemently , and almost on the instant the door was opened by our tenant in person — our tenant , resplendent in speckless frock - coat and gleaming high hat — the armor in which he habitually leaves his home to fight with beasts in the newspaper - offices of Fleet Street . “
71362	71392	71409	71409	Yolande	52	” he said , hurriedly , and , indeed , its smoke showed already beyond the gray veil of leaf - buds on the trees of our railway embankment . “
71413	71414	71409	71409	Yolande	52	” “
71420	71421	71489	71489	I	0	” “
71474	71488	71489	71489	I	0	” He tore off down the red path , shouting as he went , “
71503	71612	71613	71613	Pray	153	” We were left planted on the doorstep . The next moment Yolande came down the stairs — they lead , sans phrases , from the bedrooms into the dining - room — and stood before us , a changed , a transfigured Yolande . Her stuff dress of dull Venetian red was pinned up over a delicious petticoat of mauve silk and lace ; she wore an apron — one of Mrs. Bates 's , I knew at once by its tasteful Nottingham trimmings — and over her bright hair she had pinned a white silk handkerchief that conscientiously strove to look like a mob - cap . “
71617	71628	71658	71658	Percy	147	” she said , in a bitter travesty of hospitality . “
71664	71665	71658	71658	Percy	147	” “
71671	71675	71676	71676	I	0	” I said — “
71687	71699	71712	71712	you	0	” she went on , pretending to tear her pretty hair , “
71707	71708	71712	71712	you	0	” “
71714	71724	71727	71730	a house - maid	1560	” asked Chloe , sitting down on the settle . “
71732	71736	71788	71791	the ferret 's wife	1535	” she said , tragically—“a
71798	71799	71808	71808	she	1535	” “
71804	71805	71901	71901	We	1571	” “
71865	71900	71901	71901	We	1571	” With this last quotation she sat down and poured out foaming beer for herself and us — at half - past eleven o'clock in the morning ! We drank it in respectful silence . “
71912	71923	72106	72108	my darling housemaid	1575	” she went on , setting down her empty tumbler . “
72099	72100	72106	72108	my darling housemaid	1575	” “
72115	72119	72122	72122	I	0	” said Chloe , “
72130	72140	72143	72143	I	0	” For the breakfast things still covered the table . “
72147	72167	72194	72194	I	0	” asked Yolande . Her eyes were bright , and in her cheeks shone the prettiest shell - pink . “
72192	72193	72194	72194	I	0	” “
72198	72210	72322	72322	women	2242	” said Yolande , firmly , but her eyes betrayed her ; “
72315	72316	72322	72322	women	2242	” “
72324	72328	72322	72322	women	2242	” said Chloe . “
72338	72342	72322	72322	women	2242	” said Yolande . “
72348	72848	72959	72959	you	1581	” We helped in the house - work ; it was to us a holiday excursion — a treat to good children . Incidentally , in the course of it we observed several things . One , that the two studies were now in one house , and that the door between them had been taken off its hinges and replaced by an Indian curtain drawn back in folds too stiff and formal to allow one to suppose for an instant that it was ever drawn across the doorway . Two , that Yolande had a work - basket , and that from it peeped a half - hemmed man 's necktie , and a half - knitted man 's sock . Third — But why sing songs of triumph over the vanquished ? Yolande had found her happiness where we had found it , so let my last words of her leave her there . And now , if I might , I would leave here certain blank pages to speak for me of certain April days , not ever to be forgotten , and never , never , never to be written about . I always look with wonder alternating with envy on those men who can set down , in black and white , the heights of their joy , the depths of their trouble . And I marvel whether they have less imagination than I , or more . Chloe can do this thing — and in a woman one can only envy the faculty ; it is that which makes her a better story - teller than I. For my part , when I think of those days my lips are closed like the lips of the dead , and my pen falls from between my fingers . So , because , somehow , those days should be recorded , I long for the blank pages , on which every man who loves his wife should read for himself what his heart would write for him there . And now it was May , and the sweet - plumed lilac was out , the red and white hawthorns were in bud - round , shining beads of coral and pearl . The garden had forgotten the lean days of winter and was all curves and softnesses in its new green gown ; fat thrushes hopped and pecked on the wide , wet lawns . The yellow tulips stood up like tall lamps above the delicate brocade of the forget - me - nots and their leaves . It was mid - May , and this was the morning which Chloe has chosen , since it is Saturday and a whole holiday , to invite the whole tribe of those astonishing Bastable children to spend the day . They arrived , much neater than I had expected , and when Chloe had greeted them — she remembered all their names , down to H.O.—she said : “
72873	72957	72959	72959	you	1581	” Chloe always would go up the stairs two steps at a time when anything she wanted was at the top of them . The children now , light - footed , heavy - booted , followed , clattering , her flying Turkish - slippered feet and the flutter of her spring - green gown . She led them to our loafery — now transformed in many undreamed - of ways , but with its window - bars still screened with budding creeper . “
72963	72976	72959	72959	you	1581	” she asked , pointing to a brown object by the fireside . “
72979	72987	73003	73003	We	1582	” said the boy they call Oswald . “
73016	73028	73003	73003	We	1582	” The girls had made a rush forward , with the prettiest “
73031	73050	73065	73065	you	1581	” of wonder and delight . The smallest boy of all put his fat legs very far apart . “
73053	73064	73065	73065	you	1581	” said he , in a tone of positive injury , “
73077	73078	73081	73081	you	1581	” “
73096	73102	73143	73144	The dear	1360	” I said , meekly . “
73112	73142	73146	73147	the precious	1588	” he said , with undisguised regret . The girls were gloating over the cradle in the most charming feminine attitudes . I should have liked to draw them . “
73149	73156	73178	73178	Its	172	” they said , in chorus . “
73176	73177	73194	73195	a girl	2245	” “
73186	73190	73201	73204	the Pussy - Kitten	1593	” I said , “
73206	73207	73212	73212	you	0	” “
73230	73237	73242	73242	I	0	” said Oswald , rather gloomily . “
73257	73298	73312	73312	you	0	” I could not help a glance at Chloe ; she certainly did grow prettier every day , and as for dearer — well , all things wax or wane . The second boy , Dickie , surprised my glance . “
73301	73311	73314	73314	her	1598	” he said , with obvious cessation of interest , “
73316	73384	73314	73314	her	1598	” He indicated Chloe by a not discourteous gesture , and instantly asked if they might not go and see the pig . ( Have I mentioned that Jim kept a pig ? ) Permission given , they swept away like a tidal wave , and we heard their boots sound fainter and fainter on the stairs . Chloe and I were left alone with the cradle . “
73393	73404	73314	73314	her	1598	” I said , meeting her eyes across the cradle , “
73422	73423	73314	73314	her	1598	” “
73427	73448	73492	73492	She	1598	” she said , covering up a fat , pink fist thrust out from beneath the pink eider - down . “
73490	73491	73492	73492	She	1598	” “
73501	73508	73492	73492	She	1598	” said my wife , anxiously . “
73515	73520	73537	73537	you	47	” I went on . “
73542	73543	73537	73537	you	47	” “
73547	73553	73569	73569	you	47	” she said , softly , “
73592	73593	73569	73569	you	47	” “
73596	73616	None	None	None	None	” I said , and across the cradle we kissed each other for the last time in this story . “
