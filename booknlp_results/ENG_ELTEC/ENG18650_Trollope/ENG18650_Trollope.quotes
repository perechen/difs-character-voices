3481	3483	3485	3486	Mr. Vavasor	338	" study "
3897	3910	3911	3912	her father	805	" It 's the ugliest room I ever saw in my life , "
3918	3925	3926	3926	Alice	337	" It is not very pretty , "
3929	3943	3945	3947	Mr .. Vavasor	338	" I 'll go halves with you in the expense of redoing it , "
3949	3969	3945	3947	Mr .. Vavasor	338	" Would n't that be extravagant , papa ? The things have not been here quite four years yet . "
4331	4336	4338	4338	Alice	337	" Well , aunt , "
4445	4456	4458	4459	Lady Macleod	342	" Would you mind shutting the window , my dear ? "
4517	4537	4501	4501	she	342	" Would you mind shutting the window ? I 'm so warm that I 'm afraid of the draught . "
4538	4553	4555	4555	Alice	337	" You do n't mean to say that you 've walked from King Street , "
4563	4637	4555	4555	Alice	337	" Indeed I do,—every step of the way . Cabs are so ruinous . It 's a most unfortunate thing ; they always say it 's just over the two miles here . I do n't believe a word of it , because I 'm only a little more than the half - hour walking it ; and those men will say anything . But how can I prove it , you know ? "
4638	4656	4501	4501	she	342	" I really think it 's too far for you to walk when it 's so warm . "
4657	4727	4501	4501	she	342	" But what can I do , my dear ? I must come , when I 've specially come up to London to see you . I shall have a cab back again , because it 'll be hotter then , and dear Lady Midlothian has promised to send her carriage at three to take me to the concert . I do so wish you 'd go , Alice . "
4728	4755	4555	4555	Alice	337	" It 's out of the question , aunt . The idea of my going in that way at the last moment , without any invitation ! "
4756	4792	4501	4501	she	342	" It would n't be without an invitation , Alice . The marchioness has said to me over and over again how glad she would be to see you , if I would bring you . "
4793	4810	4501	4501	she	342	" Why does n't she come and call if she is so anxious to know me ? "
4811	4835	4501	4501	she	342	" My dear , you 've no right to expect it ; you have n't indeed . She never calls even on me . "
4836	4897	4555	4555	Alice	337	" I know I 've no right , and I do n't expect it , and I do n't want it . But neither has she a right to suppose that , under such circumstances , I shall go to her house . You might as well give it up , aunt . Cart ropes would n't drag me there . "
4898	4924	4501	4501	she	342	" I think you are very wrong,—particularly under your present circumstances . A young woman that is going to be married , as you are — "
4925	4930	4501	4501	she	342	" As I am,—perhaps . "
4931	4995	4501	4501	she	342	" That 's nonsense , Alice . Of course you are ; and for his sake you are bound to cultivate any advantages that naturally belong to you . As to Lady Midlothian or the marchioness coming to call on you here in your father 's house , after all that has passed , you really have no right to look for it . "
4996	5005	4501	4501	she	342	" And I do n't look for it . "
5006	5039	4501	4501	she	342	" That sort of people are not expected to call . If you 'll think of it , how could they do it with all the demands they have on their time ? "
5040	5055	4501	4501	she	342	" My dear aunt , I would n't interfere with their time for worlds . "
5056	5134	4501	4501	she	342	" Nobody can say of me , I 'm sure , that I run after great people or rich people . It does happen that some of the nearest relations I have,—indeed I may say the nearest relations,—are people of high rank ; and I do not see that I 'm bound to turn away from my own flesh and blood because of that , particularly when they are always so anxious to keep up the connexion . "
5135	5160	4501	4501	she	342	" I was only speaking of myself , aunt . It is very different with you . You have known them all your life . "
5161	5201	4501	4501	she	342	" And how are you to know them if you wo n't begin ? Lady Midlothian said to me only yesterday that she was glad to hear that you were going to be married so respectably , and then — "
5202	5230	4501	4501	she	342	" Upon my word I 'm very much obliged to her ladyship . I wonder whether she considered that she married respectably when she took Lord Midlothian ? "
5559	5567	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" Alice , do n't be uncharitable , "
5573	5594	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" Whatever may have been Lady Midlothian 's misfortunes no one can say they have resulted from her own fault . "
5595	5623	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" Yes they can , aunt , if she married a man whom she knew to be a scapegrace because he was very rich and an earl . "
5624	5685	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" She was the daughter of a nobleman herself , and only married in her own degree . But I do n't want to discuss that . She meant to be good - natured when she mentioned your marriage , and you should take it as it was meant . After all she was only your mother 's second cousin — "
5686	5698	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" Dear aunt , I make no claim on her cousinship . "
5699	5741	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" But she admits the claim , and is quite anxious that you should know her . She has been at the trouble to find out everything about Mr .. Grey , and told me that nothing could be more satisfactory . "
5742	5754	5569	5570	Lady Macleod	342	" Upon my word I am very much obliged to her . "
6215	6224	6226	6227	Lady Macleod	342	" And when do you go , Alice ? "
6229	6254	6226	6227	Lady Macleod	342	" Early in July , I believe . It will be very hot , but Kate must be back by the middle of August . "
6263	6273	6255	6256	Kate Vavasor	356	" Oh ! Kate is to go with you ? "
6274	6303	6317	6318	Lady Macleod	342	" Of course she is . I could not go alone , or with no one but George . Indeed it was Kate who made up the party . "
6304	6315	6317	6318	Lady Macleod	342	" Of course you could not go alone with George , "
6415	6423	6425	6425	Alice	337	" That is exactly what I say , "
6427	6473	6425	6425	Alice	337	" But , indeed , he is simply going as an escort to me and Kate , as we do n't like the rôle of unprotected females . It is very good - natured of him , seeing how much his time is taken up . "
6474	6482	6552	6553	Lady Macleod	342	" I thought he never did anything . "
6483	6495	6558	6558	she	342	" That 's because you do n't know him , aunt . "
6496	6506	6507	6507	She	337	" No ; certainly I do n't know him . "
6527	6539	6523	6523	she	337	" And has your father been told that he is going ? "
6540	6546	6558	6558	she	342	" Of course he has . "
6547	6551	6558	6558	she	342	" And does — "
6575	6586	6558	6558	she	342	" And does Mr. Grey know that he is going ? "
6676	6686	6688	6688	Alice	337	" I might tell you simply that he does , "
6692	6782	6688	6688	Alice	337	" seeing that I wrote to him yesterday , letting him know that such were our arrangements ; but I feel that I should not thus answer the question you mean to ask . You want to know whether Mr. Grey will approve of it . As I only wrote yesterday of course I have not heard , and therefore can not say . But I can say this , aunt , that much as I might regret his disapproval , it would make no change in my plans . "
6783	6825	6688	6688	Alice	337	" Would it not ? Then I must tell you , you are very wrong . It ought to make a change . What ! the disapproval of the man you are going to marry make no change in your plans ? "
6826	6961	7012	7012	she	337	" Not in that matter . Come , aunt , if we must discuss this matter let us do it at any rate fairly . In an ordinary way , if Mr. Grey had asked me to give up for any reason my trip altogether , I should have given it up certainly , as I would give up any other indifferent project at the request of so dear a friend,—a friend with whom I am so — so — so closely connected . But if he asked me not to travel with my cousin George , I should refuse him absolutely , without a word of parley on the subject , simply because of the nature and closeness of my connection with him . I suppose you understand what I mean , aunt ? "
6962	6992	6688	6688	Alice	337	" I suppose I do . You mean that you would refuse to obey him on the very subject on which he has a right to claim your obedience . "
6993	7006	7008	7008	Alice	337	" He has no right to claim my obedience on any subject , "
7064	7085	7087	7087	Alice	337	" At present he has no right to my obedience on any subject , but least of all on that , "
7089	7109	7087	7087	Alice	337	" His advice he may give me , but I am quite sure he will not ask for obedience . "
7110	7122	7195	7195	she	337	" And if he advises you you will slight his advice . "
7123	7191	7195	7195	she	337	" If he tells me that I had better not travel with my cousin George I shall certainly not take his advice . Moreover , I should be careful to let him know how much I was offended by any such counsel from him . It would show a littleness on his part , and a suspicion of which I can not suppose him to be capable . "
7285	7322	7273	7273	she	342	" My dear Alice , I need hardly say that if you had a mother living , or any person with you filling the place of a mother , I should not interfere in this matter . "
7323	7345	7273	7273	she	342	" Of course , Aunt Macleod , if you think I am wrong you have quite a right to say so . "
7346	7390	7415	7415	She	337	" I do think you are wrong,—very wrong , indeed ; and if you persist in this I am afraid I must say that I shall think you wicked . Of course Mr. Grey can not like you to travel with George Vavasor . "
7391	7398	7399	7399	Alice	337	" And why not , aunt ? "
7451	7468	7424	7424	her	337	" Why not , Alice ? Surely you do not wish me to say why not . "
7469	7491	7415	7415	She	337	" But I do wish you to say why not . How can I defend myself till the accusation is made ? "
7492	7520	7415	7415	She	337	" You are now engaged to marry Mr. Grey , with the consent and approbation of all your friends . Two years ago you had — had — "
7521	7608	7424	7424	her	337	" Had what , aunt ? If you mean to say that two years ago I was engaged to my cousin George you are mistaken . Three years ago I told him that under certain conditions I would become engaged to him . But my conditions did not suit him , nor his me , and no engagement was ever made . Mr. Grey knows the history of the whole thing . As far as it was possible I have told him everything that took place . "
7609	7636	7415	7415	She	337	" The fact was , Alice , that George Vavasor 's mode of life was such that an engagement with him would have been absolute madness . "
7637	7714	7415	7415	She	337	" Dear aunt , you must excuse me if I say that I can not discuss George Vavasor 's mode of life . If I were thinking of becoming his wife you would have a perfect right to discuss it , because of your constant kindness to me . But as matters are he is simply a cousin ; and as I like him and you do not , we had better say nothing about him . "
7715	7736	7424	7424	her	337	" I must say this — that after what has passed , and at the present crisis of your life — "
7737	7748	7424	7424	her	337	" Dear aunt , I 'm not in any crisis . "
7749	7810	7415	7415	She	337	" Yes you are , Alice ; in the most special crisis of a girl 's life . You are still a girl , but you are the promised wife of a very worthy man , who will look to you for all his domestic happiness . George Vavasor has the name , at least , of being very wild . "
7811	7845	7424	7424	her	337	" The worthy man and the wild man must fight it out between them . If I were going away with George by himself , there might be something in what you say . "
7846	7852	7424	7424	her	337	" That would be monstrous . "
7853	7922	7424	7424	her	337	" Monstrous or not , it is n't what I 'm about to do . Kate and I have put our purses together , and are going to have an outing for our special fun and gratification . As we should be poor travellers alone , George has promised to go with his sister . Papa knows all about it , and never thought of making any objection . "
7966	7973	7975	7976	Lady Macleod	342	" I can only say again , "
7978	8046	7975	7976	Lady Macleod	342	" that I think Mr. Grey will be displeased,—and that he will have very great cause for displeasure . And I think , moreover , that his approbation ought to be your chief study . I believe , my dear , I 'll ask you to let Jane get me a cab . I sha n't have a bit too much time to dress for the concert . "
8098	8120	8094	8094	her	978	" God bless you , my dear . Good - bye ! I 'll come to - morrow if I can . "
8348	8355	8356	8356	she	337	" He is free to go , "
8361	8375	8356	8356	she	337	" If he does not trust me he is quite free to go . "
9242	9250	9239	9239	Morrison	363	" The mistress did n't mean this , "
9252	9259	9239	9239	Morrison	363	" The mistress did intend that . "
9337	9344	9348	9348	herself	362	" I did n't give commands , "
9363	9397	9348	9348	herself	362	" He asked me how I liked the things , and of course I was obliged to say . I was obliged to seem to care , even if I did n't care . "
9522	9530	9531	9531	she	362	" No ; I gave no commands , "
10450	10460	10461	10461	she	362	" Why should he find himself unhappy in London ? "
10472	10537	10461	10461	she	362	" Why should he pretend to condemn the very place which most men find the fittest for all their energies ? Were I a man , no earthly consideration should induce me to live elsewhere . It is odd how we differ in all things . However brilliant might be his own light , he would be contented to hide it under a bushel ! "
10978	10989	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" I would come because it 's my last day , "
10994	11019	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" but really I 'm so hurried , and have so many things to do , that I hardly know how to manage it . "
11020	11026	11028	11028	Alice	350	" It 's very kind , "
11040	11079	11028	11028	Alice	350	" I 'm keeping the cab , so I can just stay twenty - five minutes . I 've marked the time accurately , but I know the man will swear it 's over the half - hour . "
11080	11099	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" You 'll have no more trouble about cabs , aunt , when you are back in Cheltenham . "
11100	11154	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" The flies are worse , my dear . I really think they 're worse . I pay the bill every month , but they 've always one down that I did n't have . It 's the regular practice , for I 've had them from all the men in the place . "
11155	11169	11028	11028	Alice	350	" It 's hard enough to find honest men anywhere , I suppose . "
11170	11241	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" Or honest women either . What do you think of Mrs. Green wanting to charge me for an extra week , because she says I did n't give her notice till Tuesday morning ? I wo n't pay her , and she may stop my things if she dares . However , it 's the last time . I shall never come up to London again , my dear . "
11242	11252	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" Oh , aunt , do n't say that ! "
11253	11291	11028	11028	Alice	350	" But I do say it , my dear . What should an old woman like me do , trailing up to town every year , merely because it 's what people choose to call the season . "
11292	11316	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" To see your friends , of course . Age does n't matter when a person 's health is so good as yours . "
11317	11386	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" If you knew what I suffer from lumbago,—though I must say coming to London always does cure that for the time . But as for friends — ! Well , I suppose one has no right to complain when one gets to be as old as I am ; but I declare I believe that those I love best would sooner be without me than with me . "
11387	11395	11028	11028	Alice	350	" Do you mean me , aunt ? "
11396	11460	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" No , my dear , I do n't mean you . Of course my life would have been very different if you could have consented to remain with me till you were married . But I did n't mean you . I do n't know that I meant any one . You should n't mind what an old woman like me says . "
11461	11473	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" You 're a little melancholy because you 're going away . "
11474	11566	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" No , indeed . I do n't know why I stayed the last week . I did say to Lady Midlothian that I thought I should go on the 20th ; and , though I know that she knew that I really did n't go , she has not once sent to me since . To be sure they 've been out every night ; but I thought she might have asked me to come and lunch . It 's so very lonely dining by myself in lodgings in London . "
11567	11579	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" And yet you never will come and dine with me . "
11580	11636	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" No , my dear ; no . But we wo n't talk about that . I 've just one word more to say . Let me see . I 've just six minutes to stay . I 've made up my mind that I 'll never come up to town again,—except for one thing . "
11637	11645	11646	11646	Alice	350	" And what 's that , aunt ? "
11662	11684	11646	11646	Alice	350	" I 'll come for your marriage , my dear . I do hope you will not keep me long waiting . "
11685	11704	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" Ah ! I ca n't make any promise . There 's no knowing when that may be . "
11705	11744	11646	11646	Alice	350	" And why should there be no knowing ? I always think that when a girl is once engaged the sooner she 's married the better . There may be reasons for delay on the gentleman 's part . "
11745	11754	10991	10992	Lady Macleod	342	" There very often are , you know , "
11755	11774	11775	11775	Alice	350	" But , Alice , you do n't mean to say that Mr. Grey is putting it off ? "
11840	11845	11846	11846	she	350	" No , aunt , "
11849	11869	11846	11846	she	350	" Mr. Grey is not putting it off . It has been left to me to fix the time . "
11870	11879	11846	11846	she	350	" And why do n't you fix it ? "
11880	11916	11846	11846	she	350	" It is such a serious thing ! After all it is not more than four months yet since I — I accepted him . I do n't know that there has been any delay . "
11917	11931	11846	11846	she	350	" But you might fix the time now , if he wishes it . "
11932	11957	11846	11846	she	350	" Well , perhaps I shall,—some day , aunt . I 'm going to think about it , and you must n't drive me . "
11958	11971	11846	11846	she	350	" But you should have some one to advise you , Alice . "
11972	12068	11846	11846	she	350	" Ah ! that 's just it . People always do seem to think it so terrible that a girl should have her own way in anything . She must n't like any one at first ; and then , when she does like some one , she must marry him directly she 's bidden . I have n't much of my own way at present ; but you see , when I 'm married I sha n't have it at all . You ca n't wonder that I should n't be in a hurry . "
12069	12117	11846	11846	she	350	" I am not advocating anything like hurry , my dear . But , goodness gracious me ! I 've been here twenty - eight minutes , and that horrid man will impose upon me . Good - bye ; God bless you ! Mind you write . "
12355	12365	12367	12367	Kate	356	" What an auspicious omen for the future nuptials ! "
12375	12420	12367	12367	Kate	356	" Uncle John dines at home , and Mr. Grey joins in the dissipation of a dinner - party . We shall all be changed soon , I suppose , and George and I will take to keeping a little cottage in the country . "
12421	12424	12426	12426	Alice	350	" Kate , "
12430	12462	12426	12426	Alice	350	" I think you are about the most unjust person I ever met . I would forgive your raillery , however painful it might be , if it were only fair . "
12463	12477	12367	12367	Kate	356	" And to whom is it unfair on the present occasion;—to your father ? "
12478	12486	12367	12367	Kate	356	" It was not intended for him . "
12487	12491	12426	12426	Alice	350	" To yourself ? "
12492	12506	12367	12367	Kate	356	" I care nothing as to myself ; you know that very well . "
12507	12518	12367	12367	Kate	356	" Then it must have been unfair to Mr. Grey . "
12519	12549	12426	12426	Alice	350	" Yes ; it was Mr. Grey whom you meant to attack . If I can forgive him for not caring for society , surely you might do so . "
12550	12700	12367	12367	Kate	356	" Exactly ; but that 's just what you ca n't do , my dear . You do n't forgive him . If you did you might be quite sure that I should say nothing . And if you choose to bid me hold my tongue I will say nothing . But when you tell me all your own thoughts about this thing you can hardly expect but that I should let you know mine in return . I 'm not particular ; and if you are ready for a little good , wholesome , useful hypocrisy , I wo n't balk you . I may n't be quite so dishonest as you call me , but I 'm not so wedded to truth but what I can look , and act , and speak a few falsehoods if you wish it . Only let us understand each other . "
12701	12712	12367	12367	Kate	356	" You know I wish for no falsehood , Kate . "
12713	12792	12426	12426	Alice	350	" I know it 's very hard to understand what you do wish . I know that for the last year or two I have been trying to find out your wishes , and , upon my word , my success has been very indifferent . I suppose you wish to marry Mr. Grey , but I 'm by no means certain . I suppose the last thing on earth you 'd wish would be to marry George ? "
12793	12806	12367	12367	Kate	356	" The very last . You 're right there at any rate . "
12807	12862	12367	12367	Kate	356	" Alice — ! sometimes you drive me too hard ; you do , indeed . You make me doubt whether I hate or love you most . Knowing what my feelings are about George , I can not understand how you can bring yourself to speak of him to me with such contempt ! "
13168	13177	13178	13178	he	357	" He has plenty to say for himself , "
13187	13195	13178	13178	he	357	" Oh yes ; he can talk . "
13196	13218	13178	13178	he	357	" And he does n't talk like a prig either , which was what I expected . He 's uncommonly handsome . "
13219	13238	13178	13178	he	357	" I thought men never saw that in each other . I never see it in any man . "
13239	13278	13178	13178	he	357	" I see it in every animal — in men , women , horses , dogs , and even pigs . I like to look on handsome things . I think people always do who are ugly themselves . "
13279	13293	13178	13178	he	357	" And so you 're going into raptures in favour of John Grey . "
13294	13351	13178	13178	he	357	" No , I 'm not . I very seldom go into raptures about anything . But he talks in the way I like a man to talk . How he bowled my uncle over about those actors ; and yet if my uncle knows anything about anything it is about the stage twenty years ago . "
13629	13634	13635	13635	he	353	" Well , Alice , "
13645	13654	13635	13635	he	353	" and about that question of home affairs ? "
13655	13665	13796	13796	his	1145	" Let us finish off the foreign affairs first . "
13666	13676	13794	13794	he	1145	" We have finished them ; have n't we ? "
13677	13688	13635	13635	he	353	" Finished them ! why we have n't started yet . "
13689	13718	13796	13796	his	1145	" No ; you have n't started . But we 've had the discussion . Is there any reason why you 'd rather not have this thing settled . "
13719	13726	13794	13794	he	1145	" No ; no special reason . "
13727	13746	13635	13635	he	353	" Then why not let it be fixed ? Do you fear coming to me as my wife ? "
13747	13750	13796	13796	his	1145	" No . "
13751	13764	13796	13796	his	1145	" I can not think that you repent your goodness to me . "
13765	13786	13635	13635	he	353	" No ; I do n't repent it;—what you call my goodness ? I love you too entirely for that . "
13787	13791	13796	13796	his	1145	" My darling ! "
13809	13816	13794	13794	he	1145	" And if you love me — "
13817	13823	13796	13796	his	1145	" I do love you . "
13824	13836	13796	13796	his	1145	" Then why should you not wish to come to me ? "
13837	13849	13796	13796	his	1145	" I do wish it . I think I wish it . "
13850	13869	13796	13796	his	1145	" But , Alice , you must have wished it altogether when you consented to be my wife . "
13870	13888	13796	13796	his	1145	" A person may wish for a thing altogether , and yet not wish for it instantly . "
13889	13937	13796	13796	his	1145	" Instantly ! Come ; I have not been hard on you . This is still June . Will you say the middle of September , and we shall still be in time for warm pleasant days among the lakes ? Is that asking for too much ? "
13938	13946	13796	13796	his	1145	" It is not asking for anything . "
13947	13970	13971	13971	She	1148	" Nay , but it is , love . Grant it , and I will swear that you have granted me everything . "
14157	14160	14161	14161	she	1148	" John , "
14166	14177	14161	14161	she	1148	" do not press me about this till I return . "
14178	14195	14245	14245	He	1149	" But then you will say the time is short . It would be short then . "
14196	14225	14245	14245	He	1149	" I can not answer you now;—indeed , I can not . That is I can not answer in the affirmative . It is such a solemn thing . "
14226	14236	14161	14161	she	1148	" Will it ever be less solemn , dearest ? "
14237	14244	14245	14245	He	1149	" Never , I hope never . "
15267	15277	15278	15279	the squire	1192	" He shall have the estate for his life , "
15286	15329	15278	15279	the squire	1192	" I do n't think I have a right to leave it away from him . It never has been left away from the heir . But I 'll tie it up so that he sha n't cut a tree on it . "
15668	15679	15680	15680	men	856	" Where on earth does your nephew get his money ? "
15689	15698	15700	15700	Vavasor	338	" Upon my word I do n't know , "
15702	15724	15700	15700	Vavasor	338	" He does n't get it from me , and I 'm sure he does n't get it from my father . "
15970	15981	15983	15983	Kate	356	" It was grand of him , was n't it ? "
15992	15998	16000	16000	Alice	350	" It was very spirited , "
16002	16041	16000	16000	Alice	350	" If you knew all , you would say so . They could get no one else to stand but that Mr. Travers , and he would n't come forward , unless they would guarantee all his expenses . "
16042	16052	16054	16054	Alice	350	" I hope it did n't cost George much , "
16056	16118	16054	16054	Alice	350	" It did , though ; nearly all he had got . But what matters ? Money 's nothing to him , except for its uses . My own little mite is my own now , and he shall have every farthing of it for the next election , even though I should go out as a housemaid the next day . "
16283	16289	16290	16290	he	357	" I grieved for her , "
16293	16296	16290	16290	he	357	" greatly . "
16297	16306	16253	16253	He	357	" I 'm sure you did , George . "
16307	16358	16253	16253	He	357	" Yes , I did;—for her , herself . Of course the world has given me credit for lamenting the loss of her money . But the truth is , that as regards both herself and her money , it is much better for me that we were never married . "
16359	16370	16290	16290	he	357	" Do you mean even though she should have lived ? "
16371	16377	16253	16253	He	357	" Yes;—even had she lived . "
16378	16395	16253	16253	He	357	" And why so ? If you liked her , her money was surely no drawback . "
16396	16406	16253	16253	He	357	" No ; not if I had liked her . "
16407	16415	16290	16290	he	357	" And did you not like her ? "
16416	16419	16253	16253	He	357	" No . "
16420	16425	16253	16253	He	357	" Oh , George ! "
16426	16462	16290	16290	he	357	" I did not love her as a man should love his wife , if you mean that . As for my liking her , I did like her . I liked her very much . "
16463	16471	16253	16253	He	357	" But you would have loved her ? "
16472	16503	16253	16253	He	357	" I do n't know . I do n't find that task of loving so very easy . It might have been that I should have learned to hate her . "
16504	16524	16290	16290	he	357	" If so , it is better for you , and better for her , that she has gone . "
16525	16560	16253	16253	He	357	" It is better . I am sure of it . And yet I grieve for her , and in thinking of her I almost feel as though I were guilty of her death . "
16561	16573	16253	16253	He	357	" But she never suspected that you did not love her ? "
16574	16622	16253	16253	He	357	" Oh no . But she was not given to think much of such things . She took all that for granted . Poor girl ! she is at rest now , and her money has gone , where it should go , among her own relatives . "
16623	16645	16290	16290	he	357	" Yes ; with such feelings as yours are about her , her money would have been a burden to you . "
16646	16697	16253	16253	He	357	" I would not have taken it . I hope , at least , that I would not have taken it . Money is a sore temptation , especially to a poor man like me . It is well for me that the trial did not come in my way . "
16698	16724	16253	16253	He	357	" But you are not such a very poor man now , are you , George ? I thought your business was a good one . "
16725	16821	16253	16253	He	357	" It is , and I have no right to be a poor man . But a man will be poor who does such mad things as I do . I had three or four thousand pounds clear , and I spent every shilling of it on the Chelsea election . Goodness knows whether I shall have a shilling at all when another chance comes round ; but if I have I shall certainly spend it , and if I have not , I shall go in debt wherever I can raise a hundred pounds . "
16822	16832	16290	16290	he	357	" I hope you will be successful at last . "
16833	16895	16253	16253	He	357	" I feel sure that I shall . But , in the mean time , I can not but know that my career is perfectly reckless . No woman ought to join her lot to mine unless she has within her courage to be as reckless as I am . You know what men do when they toss up for shillings ? "
16896	16904	16253	16253	He	357	" Yes , I suppose I do . "
16905	16922	16253	16253	He	357	" I am tossing up every day of my life for every shilling that I have . "
16923	16932	16290	16290	he	357	" Do you mean that you're — gambling ? "
16933	17016	16253	16253	He	357	" No . I have given that up altogether . I used to gamble , but I never do that now , and never shall again . What I mean is this,—that I hold myself in readiness to risk everything at any moment , in order to gain any object that may serve my turn . I am always ready to lead a forlorn hope . That 's what I mean by tossing up every day for every shilling that I have . "
17205	17225	17226	17228	the old squire	1244	" He looked at me like the devil himself — making the hole in his face gape at me , "
17977	17989	17990	17990	George	357	" I 'll endeavour to get the cold water for you , "
17994	18030	17990	17990	George	357	" but as to the breakfasts , I can only hope you wo n't put me to severe trials by any very early hours . When people go out for pleasure it should be pleasure . "
18051	18064	18046	18046	Kate	356	" George , I wonder what your wishes really are about Alice ? "
18065	18080	17990	17990	George	357	" That she should n't want her breakfast too early while we are away . "
18081	18095	17990	17990	George	357	" That means that I 'm to hold my tongue , of course . "
18096	18103	18046	18046	Kate	356	" No , it does n't . "
18104	18115	18046	18046	Kate	356	" Then it means that you intend to hold yours . "
18116	18123	17990	17990	George	357	" No ; not that either . "
18124	18131	18046	18046	Kate	356	" Then what does it mean ? "
18132	18164	18046	18046	Kate	356	" That I have no fixed wishes on the subject . Of course she 'll marry this man John Grey , and then no one will hear another word about her . "
18165	18193	17990	17990	George	357	" She will no doubt , if you do n't interfere . Probably she will whether you interfere or not . But if you wish to interfere — "
18194	18214	18046	18046	Kate	356	" She 's got four hundred a year , and is not so good - looking as she was . "
18215	18262	18046	18046	Kate	356	" Yes ; she has got four hundred a year , and she is more handsome now than ever she was . I know that you think so;—and that you love her and love no one else — unless you have a sneaking fondness for me . "
18263	18274	17990	17990	George	357	" I 'll leave you to judge of that last . "
18275	18304	18046	18046	Kate	356	" And as for me,—I only love two people in the world ; her and you . If ever you mean to try , you should try now . "
18326	18339	17990	17990	George	357	" Six Weeks in the Bernese Oberland , by party of three , "
18555	18566	18567	18567	he	357	" What fine fellows those Alpine club men think themselves , "
18575	18595	18567	18567	he	357	" and how thoroughly they despise the sort of enjoyment I get from mountains . But they 're mistaken . "
18596	18607	18609	18609	Alice	350	" I do n't see why either need be mistaken , "
18611	18617	18618	18618	he	357	" But they are mistaken , "
18621	18677	18618	18618	he	357	" They rob the mountains of their poetry , which is or should be their greatest charm . Mont Blanc can have no mystery for a man who has been up it half a dozen times . It 's like getting behind the scenes at a ballet , or making a conjuror explain his tricks . "
18678	18685	18687	18687	Kate	356	" But is the exercise nothing ? "
18689	18702	18687	18687	Kate	356	" Yes ; the exercise is very fine;—but that avoids the question . "
18703	18709	18711	18711	Alice	350	" And they all botanize , "
18713	18893	18711	18711	Alice	350	" I do n't believe it . I believe that the most of them simply walk up the mountain and down again . But if they did , that avoids the question also . The poetry and mystery of the mountains are lost to those who make themselves familiar with their details , not the less because such familiarity may have useful results . In this world things are beautiful only because they are not quite seen , or not perfectly understood . Poetry is precious chiefly because it suggests more than it declares . Look in there , through that valley , where you just see the distant little peak at the end . Are you not dreaming of the unknown beautiful world that exists up there;—beautiful , as heaven is beautiful , because you know nothing of the reality ? If you make your way up there and back to - morrow , and find out all about it , do you mean to say that it will be as beautiful to you when you come back ? "
18894	18900	18902	18902	Alice	350	" Yes;—I think it would , "
18904	18921	18902	18902	Alice	350	" Then you 've no poetry in you . Now I 'm made up of poetry . "
19415	19422	19424	19424	he	357	" It 's nearly all over , "
19435	19446	19448	19448	Kate	356	" And I do think it has been a success , "
19450	19463	19448	19448	Kate	356	" Always excepting about the money . I 'm ruined for ever . "
19464	19473	19475	19475	George	357	" I 'll make your money all straight , "
19477	19487	19489	19489	Kate	356	" Indeed you 'll do nothing of the kind , "
19491	19555	19489	19489	Kate	356	" I 'm ruined , but you are ruineder . But what signifies ? It is such a great thing ever to have had six weeks ' happiness , that the ruin is , in point of fact , a good speculation . What do you say , Alice ? Wo n't you vote , too , that we 've done it well ? "
19556	19572	19448	19448	Kate	356	" I think we 've done it very well . I have enjoyed myself thoroughly . "
19573	19597	19489	19489	Kate	356	" And now you 've got to go home to John Grey and Cambridgeshire ! It 's no wonder you should be melancholy . "
19618	19627	19629	19629	Kate	356	" That 's good of you , Alice , "
19631	19651	19629	19629	Kate	356	" Is it not , George ? I like a person who will give a hearty meed of approbation . "
19652	19664	19448	19448	Kate	356	" But I am giving the meed of approbation to myself . "
19665	19676	19678	19678	Kate	356	" I like a person even to do that heartily , "
19680	19709	19678	19678	Kate	356	" Not that George and I are thankful for the compliment . We are prepared to admit that we owe almost everything to you,—are we not , George ? "
19710	19719	19721	19721	George	357	" I 'm not ; by any means , "
19723	19750	19721	19721	George	357	" Well , I am , and I expect to have something pretty said to me in return . Have I been cross once , Alice ? "
19751	19772	19678	19678	Kate	356	" No ; I do n't think you have . You are never cross , though you are often ferocious . "
19773	19784	19678	19678	Kate	356	" But I have n't been once ferocious,—nor has George . "
19785	19799	19801	19801	Alice	350	" He would have been the most ungrateful man alive if he had , "
19803	19838	19801	19801	Alice	350	" We 've done nothing since we 've started but realize from him that picture in ' Punch ' of the young gentleman at Jeddo who had a dozen ladies to wait upon him . "
19839	19868	19678	19678	Kate	356	" And now he has got to go home to his lodgings , and wait upon himself again . Poor fellow ! I do pity you , George . "
19869	19914	19678	19678	Kate	356	" No , you don't;—nor does Alice . I believe girls always think that a bachelor in London has the happiest of all lives . It 's because they think so that they generally want to put an end to the man 's condition . "
19915	19928	19930	19930	Kate	356	" It 's envy that makes us want to get married,—not love , "
19932	19946	19948	19948	he	1316	" It 's the devil in some shape , as often as not , "
19950	19968	19948	19948	he	1316	" With a man , marriage always seems to him to be an evil at the instant . "
19969	19973	19975	19975	Alice	350	" Not always , "
19977	20029	19975	19975	Alice	350	" Almost always;—but he does it , as he takes physic , because something worse will come if he do n't . A man never likes having his tooth pulled out , but all men do have their teeth pulled out,—and they who delay it too long suffer the very mischief . "
20030	20038	20040	20040	Kate	356	" I do like George 's philosophy , "
20051	20091	20040	20040	Kate	356	" it is so sharp , and has such a pleasant acid taste about it ; and then we all know that it means nothing . Alice , I 'm going up - stairs to begin the final packing . "
20092	20101	19975	19975	Alice	350	" I 'll come with you , dear . "
20102	20184	20040	20040	Kate	356	" No , do n't . To tell the truth I 'm only going into that man 's room because he wo n't put up a single thing of his own decently . We 'll do ours , of course , when we go up to bed . Whatever you disarrange to - night , Master George , you must rearrange for yourself to - morrow morning , for I promise I wo n't go into your room at five o'clock . "
20185	20194	20196	20196	George	357	" How I do hate that early work , "
20198	20207	20209	20209	Kate	356	" I 'll be down again very soon , "
20211	20226	20209	20209	Kate	356	" Then we 'll take one turn on the bridge and go to bed . "
20934	20944	20946	20946	George	357	" When are you to be married , Alice ? "
20950	20955	20957	20957	she	350	" Oh , George ! "
20959	20976	20946	20946	George	357	" You ask me a question as though you were putting a pistol to my ear . "
20977	20987	21371	21371	he	1341	" I 'm sorry the question was so unpleasant . "
20988	21029	21363	21363	she	1340	" I did n't say that it was unpleasant ; but you asked it so suddenly ! The truth is , I did n't expect you to speak at all just then . I suppose I was thinking of something . "
21030	21043	20946	20946	George	357	" But if it be not unpleasant,—when are you to be married ? "
21044	21055	21371	21371	he	1341	" I do not know . It is not fixed . "
21056	21067	21371	21371	he	1341	" But about when , I mean ? This summer ? "
21068	21085	21363	21363	she	1340	" Certainly not this summer , for the summer will be over when we reach home . "
21086	21101	20946	20946	George	357	" This winter ? Next spring ? Next year?—or in ten years ' time ? "
21102	21124	21371	21371	he	1341	" Before the expiration of the ten years , I suppose . Anything more exact than that I ca n't say . "
21125	21132	21133	21133	he	1339	" I suppose you like it ? "
21137	21151	21133	21133	he	1339	" What , being married ? You see I 've never tried yet . "
21152	21249	21371	21371	he	1341	" The idea of it,—the anticipation , You look forward with satisfaction to the kind of life you will lead at Nethercoats ? Do n't suppose I am saying anything against it , for I have no conception what sort of a place Nethercoats is . On the whole I do n't know that there is any kind of life better than that of an English country gentleman in his own place;—that is , if he can keep it up , and not live as the old squire does , in a state of chronic poverty . "
21250	21266	21371	21371	he	1341	" Mr. Grey 's place does n't entitle him to be called a country gentleman . "
21267	21276	21133	21133	he	1339	" But you like the prospect of it ? "
21277	21304	21371	21371	he	1341	" Oh , George , how you do cross - question one ! Of course I like it , or I should n't have accepted it . "
21305	21360	21371	21371	he	1341	" That does not follow . But I quite acknowledge that I have no right to cross - question you . If I ever had such right on the score of cousinship , I have lost it on the score of — ; but we wo n't mind that , will we , Alice ? "
21376	21382	21371	21371	he	1341	" Will we , Alice ? "
21383	21388	21133	21133	he	1339	" Will we what ? "
21389	21396	21133	21133	he	1339	" Recur to the old days . "
21397	21425	21371	21371	he	1341	" Why should we recur to them ? They are passed , and as we are again friends and dear cousins the sting of them is gone . "
21426	21484	21133	21133	he	1339	" Ah , yes ! The sting of them is gone . It is for that reason , because it is so , that we may at last recur to them without danger . If we regret nothing,—if neither of us has anything to regret , why not recur to them , and talk of them freely ? "
21485	21495	21133	21133	he	1339	" No , George ; that would not do . "
21496	21529	21133	21133	he	1339	" By heavens , no ! It would drive me mad ; and if I know aught of you , it would hardly leave you as calm as you are at present . "
21530	21540	21371	21371	he	1341	" As I would wish to be left calm — "
21541	21593	21133	21133	he	1339	" Would you ? Then I suppose I ought to hold my tongue . But , Alice , I shall never have the power of speaking to you again as I speak now . Since we have been out together , we have been dear friends ; is it not so ? "
21594	21604	21133	21133	he	1339	" And shall we not always be dear friends ? "
21605	21641	21371	21371	he	1341	" No , certainly not . How will it be possible ? Think of it . How can I really be your friend when you are the mistress of that man 's house in Cambridgeshire ? "
21642	21645	21133	21133	he	1339	" George ! "
21646	21675	21133	21133	he	1339	" I mean nothing disrespectful . I truly beg your pardon if it has seemed so . Let me say that gentleman 's house;—for he is a gentleman . "
21676	21682	21371	21371	he	1341	" That he certainly is . "
21683	21780	21133	21133	he	1339	" You could not have accepted him were he not so . But how can I be your friend when you are his wife ? I may still call you cousin Alice , and pat your children on the head if I chance to see them ; and shall stop in the streets and shake hands with him if I meet him;—that is if my untoward fate does not induce him to cut my acquaintance;—but as for friendship , that will be over when you and I shall have parted next Thursday evening at London Bridge . "
21781	21791	21133	21133	he	1339	" Oh , George , do n't say so ! "
21792	21797	21133	21133	he	1339	" But I do . "
21798	21819	21371	21371	he	1341	" And why on Thursday ? Do you mean that you wo n't come to Queen Anne Street any more ? "
21820	21849	21133	21133	he	1339	" Yes , that is what I do mean . This trip of ours has been very successful , Kate says . Perhaps Kate knows nothing about it . "
21850	21860	21133	21133	he	1339	" It has been very pleasant,—at least to me . "
21861	21870	21133	21133	he	1339	" And the pleasure has had no drawback ? "
21871	21876	21371	21371	he	1341	" None to me . "
21877	21904	21133	21133	he	1339	" It has been very pleasant to me , also;—but the pleasure has had its alloy . Alice , I have nothing to ask from you,—nothing . "
21905	21918	21133	21133	he	1339	" Anything that you should ask , I would do for you . "
21919	21934	21133	21133	he	1339	" I have nothing to ask;—nothing . But I have one word to say . "
21935	21956	21371	21371	he	1341	" George , do not say it . Let me go up - stairs . Let me go to Kate . "
21957	21968	21133	21133	he	1339	" Certainly ; if you wish it you shall go . "
22001	22062	21989	21989	he	1342	" Certainly you shall go to Kate , if you refuse to hear me . But after all that has passed between us , after these six weeks of intimate companionship , I think you ought to listen to me . I tell you that I have nothing to ask . I am not going to make love to you . "
22119	22130	22131	22131	he	1342	" I am not going to make love to you , "
22135	22194	22131	22131	he	1342	" As for making love , as the word goes , that must be over between you and me . It has been made and marred , and can not be remade . It may exist , or it may have been expelled ; but where it does not exist , it will never be brought back again . "
22195	22207	22104	22104	she	350	" It should not be spoken of between you and me . "
22208	22307	22104	22104	she	350	" So , no doubt , any proper - going duenna would say , and so , too , little children should be told ; but between you and me there can be no necessity for falsehood . We have grown beyond our sugar - toothed ages , and are now men and women . I perfectly understood your breaking away from me . I understood you , and in spite of my sorrow knew that you were right . I am not going to accuse or to defend myself ; but I knew that you were right . "
22308	22318	22131	22131	he	1342	" Then let there be no more about it . "
22319	22433	22104	22104	she	350	" Yes ; there must be more about it . I did not understand you when you accepted Mr. Grey . Against him I have not a whisper to make . He may be perfect for aught I know . But , knowing you as I thought I did , I could not understand your loving such a man as him . It was as though one who had lived on brandy should take himself suddenly to a milk diet,—and enjoy the change ! A milk diet is no doubt the best . But men who have lived on brandy ca n't make those changes very suddenly . They perish in the attempt . "
22434	22440	22104	22104	she	350	" Not always , George . "
22441	22458	22104	22104	she	350	" It may be done with months of agony;—but there was no such agony with you . "
22459	22464	22131	22131	he	1342	" Who can tell ? "
22465	22679	22680	22680	He	1344	" But you will tell me the cure was made . I thought so , and therefore thought that I should find you changed . I thought that you , who had been all fire , would now have turned yourself into soft - flowing milk and honey , and have become fit for the life in store for you . With such a one I might have travelled from Moscow to Malta without danger . The woman fit to be John Grey 's wife would certainly do me no harm,—could not touch my happiness . I might have loved her once,—might still love the memory of what she had been ; but her , in her new form , after her new birth,—such a one as that , Alice , could be nothing to me . Do n't mistake me . I have enough of wisdom in me to know how much better , ay , and happier a woman she might be . It was not that I thought you had descended in the scale ; but I gave you credit for virtues which you have not acquired . Alice , that wholesome diet of which I spoke is not your diet . You would starve on it , and perish . "
22963	23027	22939	22939	he	1350	" I have learned this since we have been again together , Alice ; and finding you , not the angel I had supposed , finding you to be the same woman I had once loved,—the safety that I anticipated has not fallen to my lot . That 's all . Here 's Kate , and now we 'll go for our walk . "
23028	23031	23033	23033	Kate	356	" George , "
23044	23064	23033	23033	Kate	356	" will you tell me whether you have been preparing all your things for an open sale by auction ? "
23121	23137	23093	23093	she	356	" Would you believe it ? he had three razors laid out on his table — "
23138	23146	23093	23093	she	356	" A man must shave,—even at Basle . "
23147	23253	23093	23093	she	356	" But not with three razors at once ; and three hair - brushes , and half a dozen toothbrushes , and a small collection of combs , and four or five little glass bottles , looking as though they contained poison,—all with silver tops . I can only suppose you desired to startle the weak mind of the chambermaid . I have put them all up ; but remember this , if they are taken out again you are responsible . And I will not put up your boots , George . What can you have wanted with three pairs of boots at Basle ? "
23254	23280	23320	23320	George	357	" When you have completed the list of my wardrobe we 'll go out upon the bridge . That is , if Alice likes it . "
23281	23291	23093	23093	she	356	" Oh , yes ; I shall like it . "
23292	23297	23299	23299	Kate	356	" Come along then , "
23425	23430	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Do you know , "
23434	23445	23432	23432	Kate	356	" I have a very great mind to run away . "
23446	23455	23407	23407	his	357	" Where do you want to run to ? "
23456	23512	23407	23407	his	357	" Well;—that would n't much signify . Perhaps I 'd go to the little inn at Handek . It 's a lonely place , where nobody would hear of me,—and I should have the waterfall . I 'm afraid they 'd want to have their bill paid . That would be the worst of it . "
23513	23521	23432	23432	Kate	356	" But why run away just now ? "
23522	23589	23407	23407	his	357	" I wo n't , because you would n't like going home with George alone,—and I suppose he 'd be bound to look after me , as he 's doing now . I wonder what he thinks of having to walk over the bridge after us girls . I suppose he 'd be in that place down there drinking beer , if we were n't here . "
23590	23608	23407	23407	his	357	" If he wanted to go , I dare say he would , in spite of us . "
23609	23667	23407	23407	his	357	" That 's ungrateful of you , for I 'm sure we 've never been kept in a moment by his failing us . But as I was saying , I do dread going home . You are going to John Grey , which may be pleasant enough ; but I 'm going — to Aunt Greenow . "
23668	23675	23432	23432	Kate	356	" It 's your own choice . "
23676	23733	23407	23407	his	357	" No , it 's not . I have n't any choice in the matter . Of course I might refuse to speak to Aunt Greenow , and nobody could make me;—but practically I have n't any choice in the matter . Fancy a month at Yarmouth with no companion but such a woman as that ! "
23734	23756	23407	23407	his	357	" I should n't mind it . Aunt Greenow always seems to me to be a very good sort of woman . "
23757	23788	23432	23432	Kate	356	" She may be a good woman , but I must say I think she 's of a bad sort . You 've never heard her talk about her husband ? "
23789	23817	23407	23407	his	357	" No , never ; I think she did cry a little the first day she came to Queen Anne Street , but that was n't unnatural . "
23818	23827	23407	23407	his	357	" He was thirty years older than herself . "
23828	23923	23432	23432	Kate	356	" But still he was her husband . And even if her tears are assumed , what of that ? What 's a woman to do ? Of course she was wrong to marry him . She was thirty - five , and had nothing , while he was sixty - five , and was very rich . According to all accounts she made him a very good wife , and now that she 's got all his money , you would n't have her go about laughing within three months of his death . "
23924	24014	23432	23432	Kate	356	" No ; I would n't have her laugh ; but neither would I have her cry . And she 's quite right to wear weeds ; but she need n't be so very outrageous in the depth of her hems , or so very careful that her caps are becoming . Her eyes will be worn out by their double service . They are always red with weeping , and yet she is ready every minute with a full battery of execution for any man that she sees . "
24015	24028	23407	23407	his	357	" Then why have you consented to go to Yarmouth with her ? "
24029	24064	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Just because she 's got forty thousand pounds . If Mr. Greenow had left her with a bare maintenance I do n't suppose I should ever have held out my hand to her . "
24065	24075	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Then you 're as bad as she is . "
24076	24194	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Quite as bad;—and that 's what makes me want to run away . But it is n't my own fault altogether . It 's the fault of the world at large . Does anybody ever drop their rich relatives ? When she proposed to take me to Yarmouth , was n't it natural that the squire should ask me to go ? When I told George , was n't it natural that he should say , ' Oh , go by all means . She 's got forty thousand pounds ! ' One ca n't pretend to be wiser or better than one 's relatives . And after all what can I expect from her money ? "
24195	24202	23407	23407	his	357	" Nothing , I should say . "
24203	24243	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Not a halfpenny . I 'm nearly thirty and she 's only forty , and of course she 'll marry again . I will say of myself , too , that no person living cares less for money . "
24244	24251	23432	23432	Kate	356	" I should think no one . "
24252	24270	24272	24272	she	1358	" Yet one sticks to one 's rich relatives . It 's the way of the world . "
24277	24309	24272	24272	she	1358	" But shall I tell you , Alice , why I do stick to her ? Perhaps you 'll think the object as mean as though I wanted her money myself . "
24310	24315	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Why is it ? "
24316	24421	23432	23432	Kate	356	" Because it is on the cards that she may help George in his career . I do not want money , but he may . And for such purposes as his , I think it fair that all the family should contribute . I feel sure that he would make a name for himself in Parliament ; and if I had my way I would spend every shilling of Vavasor money in putting him there . When I told the squire so I thought he would have eaten me . I really did think he would have turned me out of the house . "
24422	24433	24272	24272	she	1358	" And serve you right too after what had happened . "
24434	24533	23432	23432	Kate	356	" I did n't care . Let him turn me out . I was determined he should know what I thought . He swore at me ; and then he was so unhappy at what he had done that he came and kissed me that night in my bedroom , and gave me a ten - pound note . What do you think I did with it ? I sent it as a contribution to the next election and George has it now locked up in a box . Do n't you tell him that I told you . "
24549	24555	24557	24557	Kate	356	" Come here , George , "
24570	24599	24560	24560	she	356	" Would n't you like to be swimming down there as those boys were doing when we went out into the balcony ? The water looks so enticing . "
24600	24620	24560	24560	she	356	" I ca n't say I should;—unless it might be a pleasant way of swimming into the next world . "
24621	24634	24636	24636	Kate	356	" I should so like to feel myself going with the stream , "
24638	24657	24636	24636	Kate	356	" particularly by this light . I ca n't fancy in the least that I should be drowned . "
24658	24666	24668	24668	Alice	350	" I ca n't fancy anything else , "
24670	24702	24560	24560	she	356	" It would be so pleasant to feel the water gliding along one 's limbs , and to be carried away headlong,—knowing that you were on the direct road to Rotterdam . "
24703	24712	24714	24714	George	357	" And so arrive there without your clothes , "
24716	24786	24714	24714	George	357	" They would be brought after in a boat . Did n't you see that those boys had a boat with them ? But if I lived here , I 'd never do it except by moonlight . The water looks so clear and bright now , and the rushing sound of it is so soft ! The sea at Yarmouth wo n't be anything like that I suppose . "
24901	24906	24907	24907	he	357	" You are cold , "
24910	24914	24907	24907	he	357	" No indeed . "
24915	24933	24895	24895	George	357	" If you are let us go in . I thought you shivered with the night air . "
24934	24958	24907	24907	he	357	" It was n't that . I was thinking of something . Do n't you ever think of things that make you shiver ? "
24959	24985	24907	24907	he	357	" Indeed I do , very often;—so often that I have to do my shiverings inwardly . Otherwise people would think I had the palsy . "
24986	24995	24997	24997	Alice	350	" I do n't mean things of moment , "
24999	25046	24997	24997	Alice	350	" Little bits of things make me do it;—perhaps a word that I said and ought not to have said ten years ago;—the most ordinary little mistakes , even my own past thoughts to myself about the merest trifles . They are always making me shiver . "
25047	25059	24907	24907	he	357	" It 's not because you have committed any murder then . "
25060	25075	24907	24907	he	357	" No ; but it 's my conscience all the same , I suppose . "
25076	25187	24997	24997	Alice	350	" Ah ! I 'm not so good as you . I doubt it 's not my conscience at all . When I think of a chance I 've let go by , as I have thousands , then it is that I shiver . But , as I tell you , I shiver inwardly . I 've been in one long shiver ever since we came out because of one chance that I let go by . Come , we 'll go in . We 've to be up at five o'clock , and now it 's eleven . I 'll do the rest of my shivering in bed . "
25188	25196	25198	25198	Kate	356	" Are you tired of being out ? "
25208	25228	25198	25198	Kate	356	" Not tired of being out , but George reminds me that we have to be up at five . "
25229	25318	24997	24997	Alice	350	" I wish George would hold his tongue . We ca n't come to the bridge at Basle every night in our lives . If one found oneself at the top of Sinai I 'm afraid the first feeling would be one of fear lest one would n't be down in time to dress for dinner . Are you aware , George , that the king of rivers is running beneath your feet , and that the moon is shining with a brilliance you never see at home ? "
25319	25336	25338	25338	George	357	" I 'll stay here all night if you 'll put off going to - morrow , "
25340	25348	25350	25350	Kate	356	" Our money would n't hold out , "
25352	25363	25365	25365	he	357	" Do n't talk about Sinai any more after that , "
25367	25376	25365	25365	he	357	" but let 's go in to bed . "
25447	25456	25458	25458	he	357	" My shivering fit has to come yet , "
25460	25469	25458	25458	he	357	" and will last me the whole night . "
25603	25611	25613	25613	Kate	356	" If you 'll take my advice , "
25627	25657	25613	25613	Kate	356	" you 'll ask her in plain words to give you another chance . Do it to - morrow at Strasbourg ; you 'll never have a better opportunity . "
25658	25667	25613	25613	Kate	356	" And bid her throw John Grey over ! "
25668	25710	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Do n't say anything about John Grey ; leave her to settle that matter with herself . Believe me that she has quite courage enough to dispose of John Grey , if she has courage enough to accept your offer . "
25711	25759	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Kate , you women never understand each other . If I were to do that , all her most powerful feelings would be arrayed in arms against me . I must leave her to find out first that she wishes to be rid of her engagement . "
25760	25802	25613	25613	Kate	356	" She has found that out long ago . Do you think I do n't know what she wishes ? But if you ca n't bring yourself to speak to her , she 'll marry him in spite of her wishes . "
25803	25843	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Bring myself ! I 've never been very slow in bringing myself to speak to any one when there was need . It is n't very pleasant sometimes , but I do it , if I find occasion . "
25844	25874	25613	25613	Kate	356	" But surely it must be pleasant with her . You must be glad to find that she still loves you . You still love her , I suppose ? "
25875	25884	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Upon my word I do n't know . "
25885	25930	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Do n't provoke me , George . I 'm moving heaven and earth to bring you two together ; but if I did n't think you loved her , I 'd go to her at once and bid her never see you again . "
25931	25954	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Upon my word , Kate , I sometimes think it would be better if you 'd leave heaven and earth alone . "
25955	25973	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Then I will . But of all human beings , surely you 're the most ungrateful . "
25974	25987	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Why should n't she marry John Grey if she likes him ? "
25988	26039	25613	25613	Kate	356	" But she does n't like him . And I hate him . I hate the sound of his voice , and the turn of his eye , and that slow , steady movement of his,—as though he was always bethinking himself that he would n't wear out his clothes . "
26040	26058	25613	25613	Kate	356	" I do n't see that your hating him ought to have anything to do with it . "
26059	26108	25613	25613	Kate	356	" If you 're going to preach morals , I 'll leave you . It 's the darling wish of my heart that she should be your wife . If you ever loved anybody,—and I sometimes doubt whether you ever did,—but if you did , you loved her . "
26109	26117	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Did and do are different things . "
26118	26181	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Very well , George ; then I have done . It has been the same in every twist and turn of my life . In everything that I have striven to do for you , you have thrown yourself over , in order that I might be thrown over too . But I believe you say this merely to vex me . "
26182	26198	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Upon my word , Kate , I think you 'd better go to bed . "
26199	26223	25613	25613	Kate	356	" But not till I 've told her everything . I wo n't leave her to be deceived and ill - used again . "
26224	26251	25613	25613	Kate	356	" Who is ill - using her now ? Is it not the worst of ill - usage , trying to separate her from that man ? "
26252	26312	25613	25613	Kate	356	" No;—if I thought so , I would have no hand in doing it . She would be miserable with him , and make him miserable as well . She does not really love him . He loves her , but I 've nothing to do with that . It 's nothing to me if he breaks his heart . "
26313	26328	25613	25613	Kate	356	" I shall break mine if you do n't let me go to bed . "
26373	26380	26382	26382	Kate	356	" Why , you lazy creature , "
26384	26394	26382	26382	Kate	356	" I declare you have n't touched a thing . "
26395	26404	26349	26349	She	1384	" You said we 'd do it together . "
26405	26435	26382	26382	Kate	356	" But he has kept me . Oh , what a man he is ! If he ever does get married , what will his wife do with him ? "
26436	26445	26447	26447	Alice	350	" I do n't think he ever will , "
26449	26533	26447	26447	Alice	350	" Do n't you ? I dare say you understand him better than I do . Sometimes I think that the only thing wanting to make him thoroughly good , is a wife . But it is n't every woman that would do for him . And the woman who marries him should have high courage . There are moments with him when he is very wild ; but he never is cruel and never hard . Is Mr .. Grey ever hard ? "
26534	26541	26349	26349	She	1384	" Never ; nor yet wild . "
26542	26558	26349	26349	She	1384	" Oh , certainly not that . I 'm quite sure he 's never wild . "
26559	26576	26447	26447	Alice	350	" When you say that , Kate , I know that you mean to abuse him . "
26577	26610	26349	26349	She	1384	" No ; upon my word . What 's the good of abusing him to you ? I like a man to be wild,—wild in my sense . You knew that before . "
26611	26624	26349	26349	She	1384	" I wonder whether you 'd like a wild man for yourself ? "
26625	26679	26447	26447	Alice	350	" Ah ! that 's a question I 've never asked myself . I 've been often curious to consider what sort of husband would suit you , but I 've had very few thoughts about a husband for myself . The truth is , I 'm married to George . Ever since — "
26680	26685	26349	26349	She	1384	" Ever since what ? "
26686	26721	26349	26349	She	1384	" Since you and he were parted , I 've had nothing to do in life but to stick to him . And I shall do so to the end,—unless one thing should happen . "
26722	26728	26349	26349	She	1384	" And what 's that ? "
26729	26746	26349	26349	She	1384	" Unless you should become his wife after all . He will never marry anybody else . "
26747	26767	26349	26349	She	1384	" Kate , you should n't allude to such a thing now . You know that it 's impossible . "
26768	26811	26349	26349	She	1384	" Well , perhaps so . As far as I 'm concerned , it is all the better for me . If George ever married , I should have nothing to do in the world;—literally nothing — nothing — nothing — nothing ! "
26812	26822	26824	26824	Alice	350	" Kate , do n't talk in that way , "
26833	26837	26839	26839	she	350	" Go away , "
26841	27000	27001	27001	She	1389	" Go , Alice ; you and I must part . I can not bear it any longer . You must know it all . When you are married to John Grey , our friendship must be over . If you became George 's wife I should become nobody . I 've nothing else in the world . You and he would be so all - sufficient for each other , that I should drop away from you like an old garment . But I 'd give up all , everything , every hope I have , to see you become George 's wife . I know myself not to be good . I know myself to be very bad , and yet I care nothing for myself . Do n't Alice , do n't ; I do n't want your caresses . Caress him , and I 'll kneel at your feet and cover them with kisses . "
27020	27031	27013	27013	her	1389	" Kate , you should n't speak in that way . "
27032	27040	27088	27088	Kate	356	" Of course I shouldn't,—but I do . "
27041	27062	27013	27013	her	1389	" You , who know everything , must know that I can not marry your brother,—even if he wished it . "
27063	27069	27013	27013	her	1389	" He does wish it . "
27070	27080	27088	27088	Kate	356	" Not though I were under no other engagement . "
27081	27086	27088	27088	Kate	356	" And why not ? "
27094	27141	27088	27088	Kate	356	" What is there to separate you from George now , but that unfortunate affair , that will end in the misery of you all . Do you think I ca n't see ? Do n't I know which of the two men you like best ? "
27142	27188	27088	27088	Kate	356	" You are making me sorry , Kate , that I have ventured to come here in your brother 's company . It is not only unkind of you to talk to me in this way , but worse than that — it is indelicate . "
27189	27317	27088	27088	Kate	356	" Oh , indelicate ! How I do hate that word . If any word in the language reminds me of a whited sepulchre it is that;—all clean and polished outside with filth and rottenness within . Are your thoughts delicate ? that 's the thing . You are engaged to marry John Grey . That may be delicate enough if you love him truly , and feel yourself fitted to be his wife ; but it 's about the most indelicate thing you can do , if you love any one better than him . Delicacy with many women is like their cleanliness . Nothing can be nicer than the whole outside get - up , but you would n't wish to answer for anything beneath . "
27318	27328	27088	27088	Kate	356	" If you think ill of me like that — "
27329	27456	27088	27088	Kate	356	" No ; I do n't think ill of you . How can I think ill of you when I know that all your difficulties have come from him ? It has n't been your fault ; it has been his throughout . It is he who has driven you to sacrifice yourself on this altar . If we can , both of us , manage to lay aside all delicacy and pretence , and dare to speak the truth , we shall acknowledge that it is so . Had Mr. Grey come to you while things were smooth between you and George , would you have thought it possible that he could be George 's rival in your estimation ? It is Hyperion to Satyr . "
27457	27464	27088	27088	Kate	356	" And which is the Satyr ? "
27465	27539	27088	27088	Kate	356	" I 'll leave your heart to tell you . You know what is the darling wish of my heart . But , Alice , if I thought that Mr. Grey was to you Hyperion,—if I thought that you could marry him with that sort of worshipping , idolatrous love which makes a girl proud as well as happy in her marriage , I would n't raise a little finger to prevent it . "
27751	27765	27767	27767	Kate	356	" If you are tired , dear , we 'll put it off , "
27769	27774	27776	27776	Alice	350	" Not for worlds , "
27778	27788	27790	27790	Kate	356	" For half a word we 'll do it , "
27792	27813	27790	27790	Kate	356	" I 'll slip out to George and tell him , and there 's nothing he 'd like so much . "
27838	27845	27847	27847	George	357	" Do n't speak to me , "
27860	27869	27847	27847	George	357	" I shall only yawn in your face . "
27993	28010	28011	28011	she	356	" I 'm my aunt 's , body and soul , for the next six weeks , "
28031	28089	28011	28011	she	356	" And she is exigeant in a manner I ca n't at all explain to you . You must n't be surprised if I do n't even write a line . I 've escaped by stealth now . She went up - stairs to try on some new weeds for the seaside , and then I bolted . "
28774	28786	28787	28787	George	357	" Why not go to Yarmouth with her for a month ? "
28793	28816	28787	28787	George	357	" Of course it will be a bore . But an aunt with forty thousand pounds has a right to claim attention . "
28834	28848	28849	28851	the old squire	1244	" Your aunt Arabella has shown herself to be a very sensible woman , "
28855	28879	28849	28851	the old squire	1244	" much more sensible than anybody thought her before her marriage . Of course you should go with her if she asks you . "
29078	29090	29055	29055	she	405	" Omnibus;—no , indeed . Jeannette , get me a fly . "
29344	29352	29354	29355	Mrs. Greenow	405	" The large house in Montpelier Parade , "
29357	29365	29367	29368	the driver	1476	" They is all large , ma'am , "
29370	29374	29376	29377	Mrs. Greenow	405	" The largest , "
29379	29387	29389	29390	the driver	1476	" They 're much of a muchness , "
29392	29398	29400	29401	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Then Mrs. Jones 's , "
29403	29417	29400	29401	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But I was particularly told it was the largest in the row . "
29418	29426	29428	29429	the driver	1476	" I know Mrs. Jones 's well , "
29618	29637	29639	29639	she	405	" Dear Greenow ! sweet lamb ! Oh , Kate , if you 'd only known that man ! "
29674	29677	29679	29679	she	405	" because , "
29683	29708	29679	29679	she	405	" she did n't see why people should be stuffy when they went to the seaside;—not if they had means to make themselves comfortable . "
29709	29722	29662	29662	She	405	" Oh , Kate , I do wish you 'd known him ! "
29723	29729	29731	29731	Kate,—very	392	" I wish I had , "
29734	29746	29731	29731	Kate,—very	392	" I was unfortunately away when he went to Vavasor Hall . "
29747	29785	29787	29787	Kate	356	" Ah , yes ; but it was at home , in the domestic circle , that Greenow should have been seen to be appreciated . I was a happy woman , Kate , while that lasted . "
29831	29836	29838	29838	Jeannette	387	" Dinner , ma'am , "
29844	29858	29838	29838	Jeannette	387	" Jeannette , I told you always to say that dinner was served . "
29859	29865	29867	29867	Jeannette	387	" Dinner 's served then , "
29874	29879	29881	29882	her aunt	912	" Come , Kate , "
29884	29942	29881	29882	her aunt	912	" I 've but little appetite myself , but there 's no reason you should n't eat your dinner . I specially wrote to Mrs. Jones to have some sweetbread . I do hope she 's got a decent cook . It 's very little I eat myself , but I do like to see things nice . "
30168	30175	30176	30176	she	405	" Peace be to his manes ! "
30218	30220	30182	30182	she	405	" remains "
30226	30238	30240	30241	Mrs. Jones	389	" He is left her uncommon well off , I suppose , "
30245	30263	30240	30241	Mrs. Jones	389	" You may say that , ma'am . It 's more nor a hundred thousand of pounds ! "
30264	30267	30240	30241	Mrs. Jones	389	" No ! "
30268	30281	30240	30241	Mrs. Jones	389	" Pounds of sterling , ma'am ! Indeed it is;—to my knowledge . "
30282	30291	30240	30241	Mrs. Jones	389	" Why do n't she have a carriage ? "
30292	30389	30240	30241	Mrs. Jones	389	" So she do;—but a lady ca n't bring her carriage down to the sea when she 's only just buried her husband as one may say . What 'd folks say if they saw her in her own carriage ? But it ai n't because she ca n't afford it , Mrs. Jones . And now we 're talking of it you must order a fly for church to - morrow , that 'll look private , you know . She said I was to get a man that had a livery coat and gloves . "
30721	30760	30761	30761	Kate	356	" I need hardly say that in my present condition I care nothing for these things . Of course I would sooner be alone . But , my dear Kate , I know what I owe to you . "
30840	30844	30845	30845	she	405	" My dear , "
30848	30883	30845	30845	she	405	" in this matter you must let me do what I know to be right . I should consider myself to be very selfish if I allowed my grief to interfere with your amusements . "
30884	30897	30817	30818	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But , aunt , I do n't care for such amusements . "
30898	30929	30817	30818	Mrs. Greenow	405	" That 's nonsense , my dear . You ought to care for them . How are you to settle yourself in life if you do n't care for them ? "
30930	30939	30817	30818	Mrs. Greenow	405	" My dear aunt , I am settled . "
30940	30943	30945	30946	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Settled ! "
30966	31007	30945	30946	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But that 's nonsense . Of course you 're not settled ; and how are you to be , if I allow you to shut yourself up in such a place as this,—just where a girl has a chance ? "
31046	31143	31028	31028	she	405	" No , my dear ; I know very well what I owe to you , and I shall do my duty . As I said before , society can have no charms now for such a one as I am . All that social intercourse could ever do for me lies buried in my darling 's grave . My heart is desolate , and must remain so . But I 'm not going to immolate you on the altars of my grief . I shall force myself to go out for your sake , Kate . "
31144	31162	31028	31028	she	405	" But , dear aunt , the world will think it so odd , just at present . "
31163	31255	31028	31028	she	405	" I do n't care twopence for the world . What can the world do to me ? I 'm not dependent on the world,—thanks to the care of that sainted lamb . I can hold my own ; and as long as I can do that the world wo n't hurt me . No , Kate , if I think a thing 's right I shall do it . I mean to make the place pleasant for you if I can , and the world may object if it likes . "
31512	31522	31496	31497	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Upon my word then she is really handsome , "
31567	31572	31574	31574	Kate	356	" My dear aunt , "
31584	31593	31574	31574	Kate	356	" how you did snub that Captain Bellfield ! "
31594	31657	31531	31531	she	356	" Captain Bellfield , indeed ! I do n't believe he 's a captain at all . At any rate he has sold out , and the tradesmen have had a scramble for the money . He was only a lieutenant when the 97th were in Manchester , and I 'm sure he 's never had a shilling to purchase since that . "
31658	31667	31574	31574	Kate	356	" But everybody here seems to know him . "
31668	31725	31574	31574	Kate	356	" Perhaps they do not know so much of him as I do . The idea of his having the impudence to tell me I was looking very well ! Nothing can be so mean as men who go about in that way when they have n't money enough in their pockets to pay their washerwomen . "
31726	31744	31531	31531	she	356	" But how do you know , aunt , that Captain Bellfield has n't paid his washerwoman ? "
31745	31785	31574	31574	Kate	356	" I know more than you think , my dear . It 's my business . How could I tell whose attentions you should receive and whose you should n't , if I did n't inquire into these things ? "
31993	32005	32006	32006	she	405	" I declare , Kate , I do n't understand you , "
32071	32079	32080	32080	she	405	" I like the morning for contemplation , "
32084	32105	32080	32080	she	405	" When a woman has gone through all that I have suffered she has a great deal to think of . "
32106	32125	32127	32127	Jeannette	387	" And it is so much more comfortable to be a - thinking when one 's in bed , "
32136	32143	32145	32146	the widow	1443	" Child , hold your tongue , "
32148	32153	32155	32155	Jeannette	387	" Yes , ma'am , "
32170	32179	32080	32080	she	405	" What do n't you understand , aunt ? "
32180	32197	32080	32080	she	405	" You only danced twice last night , and once you stood up with Captain Bellfield . "
32198	32217	32080	32080	she	405	" On purpose to ask after that poor woman who washes his clothes without getting paid for it . "
32218	32246	32080	32080	she	405	" Nonsense , Kate ; you did n't ask him anything of the kind , I 'm sure . It 's very provoking . It is indeed . "
32247	32257	32080	32080	she	405	" But what harm can Captain Bellfield do me ? "
32258	32315	32080	32080	she	405	" What good can he do you ? That 's the question . You see , my dear , years will go by . I do n't mean to say you ai n't quite as young as ever you were , and nothing can be nicer and fresher than you are;—especially since you took to bathing . "
32316	32324	32080	32080	she	405	" Oh , aunt , do n't ! "
32325	32371	32080	32080	she	405	" My dear , the truth must be spoken . I declare I do n't think I ever saw a young woman so improvident as you are . When are you to begin to think about getting married if you do n't do it now ? "
32372	32389	32080	32080	she	405	" I shall never begin to think about it , till I buy my wedding clothes . "
32390	32428	32080	32080	she	405	" That 's nonsense,—sheer nonsense . How are you to get wedding clothes if you have never thought about getting a husband ? Did n't I see Mr .. Cheesacre ask you for a dance last night ? "
32429	32446	32080	32080	she	405	" Yes , he did ; while you were talking to Captain Bellfield yourself , aunt . "
32447	32468	32080	32080	she	405	" Captain Bellfield ca n't hurt me , my dear . And why did n't you dance with Mr. Cheesacre ? "
32469	32489	32080	32080	she	405	" He 's a fat Norfolk farmer , with not an idea beyond the virtues of stall - feeding . "
32490	32545	32080	32080	she	405	" My dear , every acre of it is his own land,—every acre ! And he bought another farm for thirteen thousand pounds only last autumn . They 're better than the squires,—some of those gentlemen farmers ; they are indeed . And of all men in the world they 're the easiest managed . "
32546	32555	32080	32080	she	405	" That 's a recommendation , no doubt . "
32556	32564	32080	32080	she	405	" Of course it is;—a great recommendation . "
32581	32667	32565	32566	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He 's to take us to the picnic to - morrow , and I do hope you 'll manage to let him sit beside you . It 'll be the place of honour , because he gives all the wine . He 's picked up with that man Bellfield , and he 's to be there ; but if you allow your name to be once mixed up with his , it will be all over with you as far as Yarmouth is concerned . "
32668	32688	32690	32690	Kate	356	" I do n't at all want to be mixed up with Captain Bellfield , as you call it , "
33077	33083	33084	33084	she	869	" Dance on the sand , "
33087	33094	33084	33084	she	869	" and yet no footing seen . "
33341	33385	33389	33389	he	395	" I had Grimsby with me the other day,—the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwick , you know . Blessed if he did n't stake my bay mare . But what matters ? I mounted him again the next day just the same . "
33441	33449	33450	33450	she	405	" It would n't do for me , "
33456	33480	33450	33450	she	405	" to be putting myself forward , as if I were giving a party myself , or anything of that sort;—would it now ? "
33481	33494	33450	33450	she	405	" Well , perhaps not . But you might come with us . "
33495	33552	33450	33450	she	405	" So I will , Mr. Cheesacre , for that dear girl 's sake . I should never forgive myself if I debarred her from all the pleasures of youth , because of my sorrows . I need hardly say that at such a time as this nothing of that sort can give me any pleasure . "
33553	33558	33560	33561	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" I suppose not , "
33567	33574	33560	33561	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Quite out of the question . "
33583	33603	33576	33577	Mrs. Greenow	405	" For though as regards age I might dance on the sands as merrily as the best of them — "
33604	33615	33450	33450	she	405	" That I 'm sure you could , Mrs. Greenow . "
33616	33630	33576	33577	Mrs. Greenow	405	" How 's a woman to enjoy herself if her heart lies buried ? "
33631	33643	33644	33645	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But it wo n't be so always , Mrs. Greenow . "
33687	33694	33576	33577	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But as I was saying , "
33696	33718	33719	33720	Mr. Cheesacre	395	she—"if you and I do it between us wo n't that be the surest way of having it come off nicely ? "
33730	33751	33719	33720	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Exactly so;—I'll do the meat and pastry and fruit , and you shall do the boats and the wine . "
33752	33757	33759	33759	Cheesacre	395	" And the music , "
33761	33769	33759	33759	Cheesacre	395	" and the expenses at the place . "
33784	33796	33798	33799	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'll go halves in all that if you like , "
33825	33831	33833	33834	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And , Mr. Cheesacre , "
33836	33850	33833	33834	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I did mean to send the music ; I did , indeed . "
33851	33862	33912	33912	Blowehard	399	" I could n't hear of it , Mrs. Greenow . "
33863	33897	33833	33834	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But I mention it now , because I was thinking of getting Blowehard to come . That other man , Flutey , would n't do at all out in the open air . "
33898	33904	33906	33907	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" It shall be Blowehard , "
34328	34339	34340	34340	he	395	" I say , Guss , you are a swell , "
34355	34364	34366	34367	the captain	1602	" I do n't know much about that , "
34369	34397	34366	34367	the captain	1602	" my fellow sent me this toggery , and said that it was the sort of thing . I 'll change with you if you like it . "
34761	34790	34752	34753	Captain Bellfield	393	" Oh , Mr. Cheesacre , if you have n't caught me before I 've half done ! Captain Bellfield , I hope you think my apron becoming . "
34791	34804	34968	34969	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Everything that you wear , Mrs. Greenow , is always becoming . "
34805	34843	34752	34753	Captain Bellfield	393	" Do n't talk in that way when you know — ; but never mind — we will think of nothing sad to - day if we can help it . Will we , Mr .. Cheesacre ? "
34844	34860	34752	34753	Captain Bellfield	393	" Oh dear no ; I should think not;—unless it should come on to rain . "
34861	34958	34968	34969	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" It wo n't rain — we wo n't think of such a thing . But , by the by , Captain Bellfield , I and my niece do mean to send out a few things , just in a bag you know , so that we may tidy ourselves up a little after the sea . I do n't want it mentioned , because if it gets about among the other ladies , they 'd think we wanted to make a dressing of it;—and there would n't be room for them all ; would there ? "
34959	34966	34968	34969	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" No ; there would n't , "
34992	34998	35000	35001	Mrs. Greenow	405	" That 's just it , "
35003	35050	35000	35001	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But there wo n't be any harm , will there , Mr. Cheesacre , in Jeanette 's going out with our things ? She 'll ride in the cart , you know , with the eatables . I know Jeannette 's a friend of yours . "
35051	35060	35062	35063	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" We shall be delighted to have Jeanette , "
35065	35071	35073	35073	Jeannette	387	" Thank ye , sir , "
35079	35164	35073	35073	Jeannette	387	" Jeannette , do n't you let Mr. Cheesacre turn your head ; and mind you behave yourself and be useful . Well ; let me see;—what else is there ? Mrs. Jones , you might as well give me that ham now . Captain Bellfield , hand it over . Do n't you put it into the basket , because you 'd turn it the wrong side down . There now , if you have n't nearly made me upset the apricot pie . "
35235	35244	35246	35246	she	405	" What do you think , Mr. Cheesacre , "
35248	35272	35246	35246	she	405	" Kate would n't come down because she did n't choose that you should see her with an apron on over her frock ! "
35273	35291	35217	35218	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm sure I do n't know why Miss Vavasor should care about my seeing her . "
35292	35328	35246	35246	she	405	" Nor I either . That 's just what I said . Do step up into the drawing - room ; you 'll find her there , and you can make her answer for herself . "
35329	35338	35340	35341	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" She would n't come down for me , "
35442	35447	35448	35449	Fanny Fairstairs	406	" Your dear aunt ! "
35458	35477	35448	35449	Fanny Fairstairs	406	" I do n't think I ever came across a woman with such genuine milk of human kindness ! "
35478	35486	35488	35489	her sister	1565	" Nor with so much true wit , "
35744	35753	35754	35755	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I know your husband would like it , "
35759	35775	35754	35755	Mrs. Greenow	405	" and I hope I may live to tell him that I made you go . "
35842	35852	35854	35854	Fanny	406	" We told Joe to come to the house , "
35861	35875	35854	35854	Fanny	406	" because we thought he might be useful in carrying down the cloaks . "
35962	35972	35974	35975	the widow	1443	" I 'll take your arm , Mr. Joe , "
35977	35986	35974	35975	the widow	1443	" and the girls shall come with us . "
36104	36117	36118	36118	he	395	" How absurd Bellfield looks in that jacket , does n't he ? "
36132	36151	36118	36118	he	395	" Do you think so ? I thought it was so very pretty and becoming for the occasion . "
36211	36217	36219	36219	Cheesacre	395	" It may be becoming , "
36221	36232	36219	36219	Cheesacre	395	" but do n't you think it 's awfully extravagant ? "
36233	36265	36276	36276	Cheesacre	395	" As to that I ca n't tell . You see I do n't at all know what is the price of a jacket covered all over with little brass buttons . "
36266	36274	36276	36276	Cheesacre	395	" And the waistcoat , Miss Vavasor ! "
36281	36292	36276	36276	Cheesacre	395	" The waistcoat I should think must have been expensive . "
36293	36312	36313	36313	he	395	" Oh , dreadful ! and he 's got nothing , Miss Vavasor ; literally nothing . Do you know,"—and
36324	36383	36321	36321	he	395	communication,—"I lent him twenty pounds the day before yesterday ; I did indeed . You wo n't mention it again , of course . I tell you , because , as you are seeing a good deal of him just now , I think it right that you should know on what sort of a footing he stands . "
36546	36556	36557	36558	the captain	1602	" She does very well pour passer le temps , "
36589	36603	36604	36604	he	395	" I do n't want it to be mentioned again , Miss Vavasor , "
36607	36617	36604	36604	he	395	" Such things should not be mentioned at all , "
36645	36714	36618	36618	Kate	356	" No , they should n't ; and therefore I know that I 'm quite safe with you , Miss Vavasor . He 's a very pleasant fellow , very ; and has seen the world,—uncommon ; but he 's better for eating and drinking with than he is for buying and selling with , as we say in Norfolk . Do you like Norfolk , Miss Vavasor ? "
36715	36731	36604	36604	he	395	" I never was in it before , and now I 've only seen Yarmouth . "
36732	36770	36604	36604	he	395	" A nice place , Yarmouth , very ; but you should come up and see our lands . I suppose you do n't know that we feed one - third of England during the winter months . "
36771	36775	36618	36618	Kate	356	" Dear me ! "
36776	36840	36604	36604	he	395	" We do , though ; nobody knows what a county Norfolk is . Taking it altogether , including the game you know , and Lord Nelson , and its watering - places and the rest of it , I do n't think there 's a county in England to beat it . Fancy feeding one - third of all England and Wales ! "
36841	36857	36604	36604	he	395	" With bread and cheese , do you mean , and those sort of things ? "
36858	36861	36863	36864	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Beef ! "
36877	36938	36871	36871	he	395	" Beef ! Yes indeed ; but if you were to tell them that in London they would n't believe you . Ah ! you should certainly come down and see our lands . The 7.45 a.m. train would take you through Norwich to my door , as one may say , and you would be back by the 6.22 p.m. "
36993	37000	37003	37004	the men	1672	" Take an oar , Captain , "
37018	37026	37027	37027	he	395	" Not to - day , Jack , "
37031	37042	37027	37027	he	395	" I 'll content myself with being bo'san this morning . "
37043	37059	37061	37062	the man	8761	" The best thing as the bo'san does is to pipe all hands to grog , "
37064	37074	37076	37077	the captain	1602	" I wo n't be behind in that either , "
37087	37101	37103	37104	the widow	1443	" What a fine generous fellow your friend , Mr. Cheesacre , is ! "
37106	37133	37103	37104	the widow	1443	" Yes , he is ; he 's a capital fellow in his way . Some of these Norfolk farmers are no end of good fellows . "
37134	37162	37027	37027	he	395	" And I suppose he 's something more than a common farmer . He 's visited by the people about where he lives , is n't he ? "
37163	37189	37061	37062	the man	8761	" Oh , yes , in a sort of a way . The county people , you know , keep themselves very much to themselves . "
37190	37210	37103	37104	the widow	1443	" That 's of course . But his house;—he has a good sort of place , has n't he ? "
37211	37255	37027	37027	he	395	" Yes , yes;—a very good house;—a little too near to the horse - pond for my taste . But when a man gets his money out of the till , he must n't be ashamed of the counter;—must he , Mrs. Greenow ? "
37256	37275	37103	37104	the widow	1443	" But he could live like a gentleman if he let his own land , could n't he ? "
37276	37287	37027	37027	he	395	" That depends upon how a gentleman wishes to live . "
37398	37406	37407	37409	an anxious mother	1680	" I really think , Mr. Cheesacre , "
37413	37438	37407	37409	an anxious mother	1680	" that you 'd better give it up . The water off the nasty cord has got all over Maria 's dress , already . "
37500	37516	37517	37517	he	395	" There are people who like to take everything and never like to give anything , "
37578	37606	37608	37608	Kate	356	" You ca n't suppose that any girl will like to be drenched with sea - water when she has taken so much trouble with her starch , "
37610	37618	37620	37621	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Then she should n't come fishing , "
37623	37629	37620	37621	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" I hate such airs . "
37832	37849	37855	37855	herself	405	" We 're to dine at four , and now it 's half - past three , "
37860	37869	37871	37874	an eager young lady	1692	" And to begin to dance at six , "
37876	37883	37885	37887	the young lady	1693	" Maria , hold your tongue , "
37891	37900	37902	37903	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Yes , we 'll dine at four , "
37905	37941	37902	37903	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" And as for the music , I 've ordered it to be here punctual at half - past five . We 're to have three horns , cymbals , triangle , and a drum . "
37942	37954	37956	37957	Charlie Fairstairs	413	" How very nice ; is n't it , Mrs. Greenow ? "
37959	37968	37970	37971	Captain Bellfield	393	" And now suppose we begin to unpack , "
37973	37983	37970	37971	Captain Bellfield	393	" Half the fun is in arranging the things . "
37984	37995	37997	37998	Fanny Fairstairs	406	" Oh , dear , yes ; more than half , "
38000	38010	38012	38012	Cheesacre	395	" Bellfield , do n't mind about the hampers , "
38014	38033	38012	38012	Cheesacre	395	" Wine is a ticklish thing to handle , and there 's my man there to manage it . "
38034	38053	38055	38055	Bellfield	393	" It 's odd if I do n't know more about wine than the boots from the hotel , "
38275	38282	38283	38283	he	395	" I 'll tell you what , "
38288	38311	38283	38283	he	395	" Bellfield and I will take the two ends of the table , and Mrs. Greenow shall sit at my right hand . "
38402	38411	38413	38413	he	393	" I do n't think that will do , "
38415	38474	38413	38413	he	393	" Mrs. Greenow gives the dinner , and Cheesacre gives the wine . We must have them at the two ends of the table . I am sure Mrs. Greenow wo n't refuse to allow me to hand her to the place which belongs to her . I will sit at her right hand and be her minister . "
38539	38554	38555	38555	he	395	" One would think that he had given it himself ; would n't you ? "
38579	38583	38585	38585	she	816	" Given what ? "
38587	38647	38648	38648	Maria	414	" Why , the music and the wine and all the rest of it . There are some people full of that kind of impudence . How they manage to carry it on without ever paying a shilling , I never could tell . I know I have to pay my way , and something over and beyond generally . "
38653	38658	38648	38648	Maria	414	" Yes , indeed . "
38709	38739	38700	38701	Joe Fairstairs	408	" Ophelia , my dear , you are dreadfully in the draught ; there 's a seat up here , just opposite , where you 'll be more comfortable . "
38740	38749	38751	38751	Ophelia	415	" There 's no draught here , mamma , "
38846	38852	38854	38854	Maria	414	" Is anything the matter ? "
38858	38861	38863	38863	he	395	" Matter ! "
38896	38908	38909	38909	she	356	" I never saw a man so nearly broken - hearted , "
38921	38932	38936	38936	himself	395	" Eleven , thirteen , eighteen , twenty - one , "
38963	38968	38970	38971	Captain Bellfield	393	" Ladies and gentlemen , "
38981	39006	38970	38971	Captain Bellfield	393	" if I may be permitted to get upon my legs for two minutes , I am going to propose a toast to you . "
39035	39043	39045	39046	the patron	1725	" If you please , Captain Bellfield , "
39056	39063	39045	39046	the patron	1725	" I 'll propose the toast . "
39064	39076	39078	39079	the captain	1602	" Nothing on earth could be better , my dear fellow , "
39081	39141	39078	39079	the captain	1602	" and I 'm sure I should be the last man in the world to take the job out of the hands of one who would do it so much better than I can ; but as it 's your health that we 're going to drink , I really do n't see how you are to do it . "
39349	39358	39359	39359	he	395	" I hate all this kind of thing , "
39364	39370	39359	39359	he	395	" It 's so fulsome . "
39371	39380	39382	39382	Kate	356	" After - dinner speeches never mean anything , "
39505	39515	39517	39517	he	393	" I 'm very much obliged to this company , "
39519	39589	39517	39517	he	393	" and to my friend Bellfield , who really is,—but perhaps that does n't signify now . I 've had the greatest pleasure in getting up this little thing , and I 'd made up my mind to propose Mrs. Greenow 's health ; but , h'm , ha , no doubt it has been in better hands . Perhaps , considering all things , Bellfield might have waited . "
39590	39606	39480	39481	Mrs. Greenow	405	" With such a subject on my hands , I could n't wait a moment . "
39607	39758	39760	39760	he	1734	" I did n't interrupt you , Captain Bellfield , and perhaps you 'll let me go on without interrupting me . We 've all drunk Mrs. Greenow 's health , and I 'm sure she 's very much obliged . So am I for the honour you 've done me . I have taken some trouble in getting up this little thing , and I hope you like it . I think somebody said something about liberality . I beg to assure you that I do n't think of that for a moment . Somebody must pay for these sort of things , and I 'm always very glad to take my turn . I dare say Bellfield will give us the next picnic , and if he 'll appoint a day before the end of the month , I shall be happy to be one of the party . "
39780	39791	39793	39793	Bellfield	393	" Nothing on earth would give me so much pleasure , "
40229	40237	40238	40239	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No , my friend , no , "
40255	40275	40238	40239	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Kate will be delighted I am sure to join you,—but as for me , you must excuse me . "
40340	40352	40354	40354	he	395	" I 'm not quite sure that I 'll dance myself , "
40601	40611	40612	40612	he	395	" By George ! there 's flesh and blood , "
40705	40716	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Oh , Mr. Cheesacre , you should join them , "
40721	40741	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" they 'll not half enjoy themselves without you . Kate will think that you mean to neglect her . "
40742	40761	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I sha n't dance , Mrs. Greenow , unless you like to stand up for a set . "
40762	40805	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No , my friend , no ; I shall not do that . I fear you forget how recent has been my bereavement . Your asking me is the bitterest reproach to me for having ventured to join your festive board . "
40806	40827	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Upon my honour I did n't mean it , Mrs. Greenow . I did n't mean it , indeed . "
40828	40841	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I do not suspect you . It would have been unmanly . "
40842	40868	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And nobody can say that of me . There is n't a man or woman in Norfolk that would n't say I was manly . "
40869	40877	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm quite sure of that . "
40878	40888	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I have my faults , I 'm aware . "
40889	40899	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And what are your faults , Mr. Cheesacre ? "
40900	40956	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Well ; perhaps I 'm extravagant . But it 's only in these kind of things you know , when I spend a little money for the sake of making my friends happy . When I 'm about , on the lands at home , I ai n't extravagant , I can tell you . "
40957	40964	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Extravagance is a great vice . "
40965	41008	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Oh , I ai n't extravagant in that sense;—not a bit in the world . But when a man 's enamoured , and perhaps looking out for a wife , he does like to be a little free , you know . "
41009	41022	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And are you looking out for a wife , Mr. Cheesacre ? "
41023	41037	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" If I told you I suppose you 'd only laugh at me . "
41038	41063	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No ; indeed I would not . I am not given to joking when any one that I regard speaks to me seriously . "
41064	41099	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Ai n't you though ? I 'm so glad of that . When one has really got a serious thing to say , one does n't like to have fun poked at one . "
41100	41126	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And , besides , how could I laugh at marriages , seeing how happy I have been in that condition?—so — very — happy , "
41138	41154	41132	41132	her	405	" So happy that you 'll try it again some day ; wo n't you ? "
41155	41202	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Never , Mr. Cheesacre ; never . Is that the way you talk of serious things without joking ? Anything like love — love of that sort — is over for me . It lies buried under the sod with my poor dear departed saint . "
41203	41207	41132	41132	her	405	" But , Mrs. Greenow,"—and
41229	41242	41132	41132	her	405	table,—"But , Mrs. Greenow , care killed a cat , you know . "
41243	41254	41132	41132	her	405	" And sometimes I think that care will kill me . "
41255	41268	40718	40719	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No , by George ; not if I can prevent it . "
41269	41288	41132	41132	her	405	" You 're very kind , Mr. Cheesacre ; but there 's no preventing such care as mine . "
41289	41502	41503	41504	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Is n't there though ? I 'll tell you what , Mrs. Greenow ; I 'm in earnest , I am indeed . If you 'll inquire , you 'll find there is n't a fellow in Norfolk pays his way better than I do , or is better able to do it . I do n't pay a sixpence of rent , and I sit upon seven hundred acres of as good land as there is in the county . There 's not an acre that wo n't do me a bullock and a half . Just put that and that together , and see what it comes to . And , mind you , some of these fellows that farm their own land are worse off than if they 'd rent to pay . They 've borrowed so much to carry on with , that the interest is more than rent . I do n't owe a sixpence to ere a man or ere a company in the world . I can walk into every bank in Norwich without seeing my master . There ai n't any of my paper flying about , Mrs. Greenow . I 'm Samuel Cheesacre of Oileymead , and it 's all my own . "
41564	41590	41592	41592	he	395	" It 's all my own , Mrs. Greenow , and the half of it shall be yours if you 'll please to take it ; "
41634	41644	41617	41617	he	395	" If you 'd known Greenow , Mr. Cheesacre — "
41645	41659	41592	41592	he	395	" I 've no doubt he was a very good sort of man . "
41660	41677	41592	41592	he	395	" If you 'd known him , you would not have addressed me in this way . "
41678	41775	41617	41617	he	395	" What difference would that make ? My idea is that care killed a cat , as I said before . I never knew what was the good of being unhappy . If I find early mangels do n't do on a bit of land , then I sow late turnips ; and never cry after spilt milk . Greenow was the early mangels ; I 'll be the late turnips . Come then , say the word . There ai n't a bedroom in my house,—not one of the front ones,—that is n't mahogany furnished ! "
41776	41783	41789	41789	her	405	" What 's furniture to me ? "
41964	41974	41975	41975	she	405	" Mr. Cheesacre and I are talking about farming , "
41978	41983	41975	41975	she	405	" Oh ; farming ! "
41989	42001	42003	42004	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Mr. Cheesacre thinks that turnips are better than early mangels , "
42006	42012	42014	42014	Cheesacre	395	" Yes , I do , "
42016	42023	42025	42026	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I prefer the early mangels , "
42028	42048	42025	42026	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I do n't think nature ever intended those late crops . What do you say , Mrs. Walker ? "
42049	42065	42067	42068	the lady	816	" I daresay Mr. Cheesacre understands what he 's about when he 's at home , "
42070	42088	42090	42091	the gentleman	818	" I know what a bit of land can do as well as any man in Norfolk , "
42093	42102	42104	42105	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It may be very well in Norfolk , "
42112	42132	42104	42105	Mrs. Greenow	405	" but the practice is n't thought much of in the other counties with which I am better acquainted . "
42133	42152	42154	42155	Mrs. Walker	420	" I 'd just come in to say that I thought we might be getting to the boats , "
42157	42164	42154	42155	Mrs. Walker	420	" My Ophelia is so delicate . "
42314	42321	42323	42324	Mrs. Walker	420	" I hope they 're sober , "
42333	42338	42340	42340	Bellfield	393	" Sober as judges , "
42369	42372	42374	42375	Mrs. Walker	420	" Because , "
42377	42407	42374	42375	Mrs. Walker	420	" I know that they play all manner of tricks when they're — in liquor . They 'd think nothing of taking us out to sea , Mrs. Greenow . "
42408	42417	42419	42419	Ophelia	415	" Oh , I do wish they would , "
42421	42433	42439	42439	she	1798	" Ophelia , mind you come in the boat with me , "
42517	42524	42526	42526	Ophelia	415	" Mamma will be so angry , "
42528	42552	42526	42526	Ophelia	415	" and it was all your fault . I did mean to go into the other boat . Do n't , Mr. Fairstairs . "
42611	42623	42624	42624	she	405	" I think we 'd better go back as we came , "
42634	42639	42641	42642	Captain Bellfield	393	" Oh , certainly , "
42644	42670	42641	42642	Captain Bellfield	393	" Why should there be any change ? Cheesacre , old fellow , mind you look after Mrs. Walker . Come along , my hearty . "
42683	42687	42676	42677	Captain Bellfield	393	" his hearty , "
42736	42755	42723	42723	Bellfield	393	" If you 're going to steer , Captain Bellfield , I beg that you 'll be careful . "
42756	42763	42765	42766	the Captain	1602	" Careful,—and with you on board ! "
42768	42792	42765	42766	the Captain	1602	" Do n't you know that I would sooner perish beneath the waves than that a drop of water should touch you roughly ? "
42793	42806	42723	42723	Bellfield	393	" But you see , we might perish beneath the waves together . "
42807	42841	42723	42723	Bellfield	393	" Together ! What a sweet word that is;—perish together ! If it were not that there might be something better even than that , I would wish to perish in such company . "
42842	42862	42765	42766	the Captain	1602	" But I should not wish anything of the kind , Captain Bellfield , and therefore pray be careful . "
42910	42913	42915	42915	he	393	" There , "
42924	42939	42915	42915	he	393	" I have brought you to no harm , at any rate as yet . "
42940	42953	42915	42915	he	393	" And , as I hope , will not do so hereafter . "
42954	43011	42915	42915	he	393	" May the heavens forbid it , Mrs. Greenow ! Whatever may be our lots hereafter,—yours I mean and mine,—I trust that yours may be free from all disaster . Oh , that I might venture to hope that , at some future day , the privilege might be mine of protecting you from all danger ! "
43012	43055	42915	42915	he	393	" I can protect myself very well , I can assure you . Good night , Captain Bellfield . We wo n't take you and Mr. Cheesacre out of your way;—will we , Kate ? We have had a most pleasant day . "
43119	43128	43130	43130	she	405	" Mr. Joe Fairstairs must pass the house , "
43132	43153	43130	43130	she	405	" and he will see us home . Mr. Cheesacre , good night . Indeed you shall not;—not a step . "
43195	43208	43209	43210	the aunt	1560	" Well , Kate , what do you think of the day ? "
43220	43262	43209	43210	the aunt	1560	" I never think much about such days , aunt . It was all very well , but I fear I have not the temperament fitted for enjoying the fun . I envied Ophelia Walker because she made herself thoroughly happy . "
43263	43273	43275	43276	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I do like to see girls enjoy themselves , "
43278	43299	43275	43276	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I do , indeed;—and young men too . It seems so natural ; why should n't young people flirt ? "
43300	43311	43209	43210	the aunt	1560	" Or old people either for the matter of that ? "
43312	43445	43275	43276	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Or old people either,—if they do n't do any harm to anybody . I 'll tell you what it is , Kate ; people have become so very virtuous , that they 're driven into all manner of abominable resources for amusement and occupation . If I had sons and daughters I should think a little flirting the very best thing for them as a safety valve . When people get to be old , there 's a difficulty . They want to flirt with the young people and the young people do n't want them . If the old people would be content to flirt together , I do n't see why they should ever give it up;—till they 're obliged to give up every thing , and go away . "
46833	46837	46838	46838	he	353	" Dearest Alice , "
46841	46870	46838	46838	he	353	" I have resolved to go to London at once . I will be with you in the evening at eight , the day after to - morrow . "
46875	46886	46873	46874	J. G.	426	" There was no more in the letter than that . "
46890	46899	46838	46838	he	353	" she said , when she received it , "
46910	48151	46873	46874	J. G.	426	" And what was the whole truth ? Alice Vavasor , when she declared to herself that she must tell her lover the whole truth , was expressing to herself her intention of putting an end to her engagement with Mr. Grey . She was acknowledging that that which had to be told was not compatible with the love and perfect faith which she owed to the man who was her affianced husband . And yet , why should it be so ? She did not intend to tell him that she had been false in her love to him . It was not that her heart had again veered itself round and given itself to that wild cousin of hers . Though she might feel herself constrained to part from John Grey , George Vavasor could never be her husband . Of that she assured herself fifty times during the two days ' grace which had been allowed her . Nay , she went farther than that with herself , and pronounced a verdict against any marriage as possible to her if she now decided against this marriage which had for some months past been regarded as fixed by herself and all her friends . People often say that marriage is an important thing , and should be much thought of in advance , and marrying people are cautioned that there are many who marry in haste and repent at leisure . I am not sure , however , that marriage may not be pondered over too much ; nor do I feel certain that the leisurely repentance does not as often follow the leisurely marriages as it does the rapid ones . That some repent no one can doubt ; but I am inclined to believe that most men and women take their lots as they find them , marrying as the birds do by force of nature , and going on with their mates with a general , though not perhaps an undisturbed satisfaction , feeling inwardly assured that Providence , if it have not done the very best for them , has done for them as well as they could do for themselves with all the thought in the world . I do not know that a woman can assure to herself , by her own prudence and taste , a good husband any more than she can add two cubits to her stature ; but husbands have been made to be decently good,—and wives too , for the most part , in our country,—so that the thing does not require quite so much thinking as some people say . That Alice Vavasor had thought too much about it , I feel quite sure . She had gone on thinking of it till she had filled herself with a cloud of doubts which even the sunshine of love was unable to drive from her heavens . That a girl should really love the man she intends to marry,—that , at any rate , may be admitted . But love generally comes easily enough . With all her doubts Alice never doubted her love for Mr. Grey . Nor did she doubt his character , nor his temper , nor his means . But she had gone on thinking of the matter till her mind had become filled with some undefined idea of the importance to her of her own life . What should a woman do with her life ? There had arisen round her a flock of learned ladies asking that question , to whom it seems that the proper answer has never yet occurred . Fall in love , marry the man , have two children , and live happy ever afterwards . I maintain that answer has as much wisdom in it as any other that can be given;—or perhaps more . The advice contained in it can not , perhaps , always be followed to the letter ; but neither can the advice of the other kind , which is given by the flock of learned ladies who ask the question . A woman 's life is important to her,—as is that of a man to him,—not chiefly in regard to that which she shall do with it . The chief thing for her to look to is the manner in which that something shall be done . It is of moment to a young man when entering life to decide whether he shall make hats or shoes ; but not of half the moment that will be that other decision , whether he shall make good shoes or bad . And so with a woman;—if she shall have recognised the necessity of truth and honesty for the purposes of her life , I do not know that she need ask herself many questions as to what she will do with it . Alice Vavasor was ever asking herself that question , and had by degrees filled herself with a vague idea that there was a something to be done ; a something over and beyond , or perhaps altogether beside that marrying and having two children;—if she only knew what it was . She had filled herself , or had been filled by her cousins , with an undefined ambition that made her restless without giving her any real food for her mind . When she told herself that she would have no scope for action in that life in Cambridgeshire which Mr. Grey was preparing for her , she did not herself know what she meant by action . Had any one accused her of being afraid to separate herself from London society , she would have declared that she went very little into society and disliked that little . Had it been whispered to her that she loved the neighbourhood of the shops , she would have scorned the whisperer . Had it been suggested that the continued rattle of the big city was necessary to her happiness , she would have declared that she and her father had picked out for their residence the quietest street in London because she could not bear noise;—and yet she told herself that she feared to be taken into the desolate calmness of Cambridgeshire . When she did contrive to find any answer to that question as to what she should do with her life,—or rather what she would wish to do with it if she were a free agent , it was generally of a political nature . She was not so far advanced as to think that women should be lawyers and doctors , or to wish that she might have the privilege of the franchise for herself ; but she had undoubtedly a hankering after some second - hand political manœuvering . She would have liked , I think , to have been the wife of the leader of a Radical opposition , in the time when such men were put into prison , and to have kept up for him his seditious correspondence while he lay in the Tower . She would have carried the answers to him inside her stays,—and have made long journeys down into northern parts without any money , if the cause required it . She would have liked to have around her ardent spirits , male or female , who would have talked of "
48155	48437	46873	46874	J. G.	426	" and have kept alive in her some flame of political fire . As it was , she had no cause . Her father 's political views were very mild . Lady Macleod 's were deadly conservative . Kate Vavasor was an aspiring Radical just now , because her brother was in the same line ; but during the year of the love - passages between George and Alice , George Vavasor 's politics had been as conservative as you please . He did not become a Radical till he had quarrelled with his grandfather . Now , indeed , he was possessed of very advanced views,—views with which Alice felt that she could sympathize . But what would be the use of sympathizing down in Cambridgeshire ? John Grey had , so to speak , no politics . He had decided views as to the treatment which the Roman Senate received from Augustus , and had even discussed with Alice the conduct of the Girondists at the time of Robespierre 's triumph ; but for Manchester and its cares he had no apparent solicitude , and had declared to Alice that he would not accept a seat in the British House of Commons if it were offered to him free of expense . What political enthusiasm could she indulge with such a companion down in Cambridgeshire ? She thought too much of all this,—and was , if I may say , over - prudent in calculating the chances of her happiness and of his . For , to give her credit for what was her due , she was quite as anxious on the latter head as on the former . "
48447	48454	48455	48455	I	0	" she would say to herself . "
48486	49169	49170	49170	My	0	" No doubt her tour in Switzerland with her cousin had had some effect in making such thoughts stronger now than they had ever been . She had not again learned to love her cousin . She was as firmly sure as ever that she could never love him more . He had insulted her love ; and though she had forgiven him and again enrolled him among her dearest friends , she could never again feel for him that passion which a woman means when she acknowledges that she is in love . That , as regarded her and George Vavasor , was over . But , nevertheless , there had been a something of romance during those days in Switzerland which she feared she would regret when she found herself settled at Nethercoats . She envied Kate . Kate could , as his sister , attach herself on to George 's political career , and obtain from it all that excitement of life which Alice desired for herself . Alice could not love her cousin and marry him ; but she felt that if she could do so without impropriety she would like to stick close to him like another sister , to spend her money in aiding his career in Parliament as Kate would do , and trust herself and her career into the boat which he was to command . She did not love her cousin ; but she still believed in him,—with a faith which he certainly did not deserve . As the two days passed over her , her mind grew more and more fixed as to its purpose . She would tell Mr. Grey that she was not fit to be his wife — and she would beg him to pardon her and to leave her . It never occurred to her that perhaps he might refuse to let her go . She felt quite sure that she would be free as soon as she had spoken the word which she intended to speak . If she could speak it with decision she would be free , and to attain that decision she would school herself with her utmost strength . At one moment she thought of telling all to her father and of begging him to break the matter to Mr. Grey ; but she knew that her father would not understand her , and that he would be very hostile to her,—saying hard , uncomfortable words , which would probably be spared if the thing were done before he was informed . Nor would she write to Kate , whose letters to her at this time were full of wit at the expense of Mrs. Greenow . She would tell Kate as soon as the thing was done , but not before . That Kate would sympathize with her , she was quite certain . So the two days passed by and the time came at which John Grey was to be there . As the minute hand on the drawing - room clock came round to the full hour , she felt that her heart was beating with a violence which she could not repress . The thing seemed to her to assume bigger dimensions than it had hitherto done . She began to be aware that she was about to be guilty of a great iniquity , when it was too late for her to change her mind . She could not bring herself to resolve that she would , on the moment , change her mind . She believed that she could never pardon herself such weakness . But yet she felt herself to be aware that her purpose was wicked . When the knock at the door was at last heard she trembled and feared that she would almost be unable to speak to him . Might it be possible that there should yet be a reprieve for her ? No ; it was his step on the stairs , and there he was in the room with her . "
49173	49292	49170	49170	My	0	" he said , coming to her . His smile was sweet and loving as it ever was , and his voice had its usual manly , genial , loving tone . As he walked across the room Alice felt that he was a man of whom a wife might be very proud . He was tall and very handsome , with brown hair , with bright blue eyes , and a mouth like a god . It was the beauty of his mouth,—beauty which comprised firmness within itself , that made Alice afraid of him . He was still dressed in his morning clothes ; but he was a man who always seemed to be well dressed . "
49296	49454	49170	49170	My	0	" he said , advancing across the room , and before she knew how to stop herself or him , he had taken her in his arms and kissed her . He did not immediately begin about the letter , but placed her upon the sofa , seating himself by her side , and looked into her face with loving eyes,—not as though to scrutinize what might be amiss there , but as though determined to enjoy to the full his privilege as a lover . There was no reproach at any rate in his countenance;—none as yet ; nor did it seem that he thought that he had any cause for fear . They sat in this way for a moment or two in silence , and during those moments Alice was summoning up her courage to speak . The palpitation at her heart was already gone , and she was determined that she would speak . "
49464	49471	49456	49456	I	0	" she said , at last , "

49492	49496	49476	49476	my	0	" he said . "

49550	49573	49533	49533	your	1968	" This she said in that tone of voice which clearly implies that the speaker is not thinking of the words spoken . "
49581	49582	49575	49575	Kate	356	" "
49595	49596	49585	49585	she	356	" "

50173	50230	50232	50232	me	0	" She sat quiet , looking at him — looking full into his face . She had in nowise changed her mind , but after such words from him , she did not know how to declare to him her resolution . There was something in his manner that awed her,—and something also that softened her . "
50234	50238	50232	50232	me	0	" said he , "
50285	50286	50278	50278	I	0	" "
50295	50324	50289	50289	I	0	" she said . And the tone of her voice , as she spoke , was different to any tone that he had heard before from her mouth . "
50334	50380	50326	50328	that melancholy fiend	1985	" He smiled as he said this , and as he smiled , he took her hand . She did not attempt to withdraw it , but sat by him in a strange calmness , looking straight before her into the middle of the room . "
50451	50452	50453	50453	I	0	" "
50500	50718	50488	50488	I	0	" As she said this , she sank before him on to the floor , and looked up into his face with an expression of sad contrition which almost drew him from his purposed firmness . He had purposed to be firm,—to yield to her in nothing , resolving to treat all that she might say as the hallucination of a sickened imagination,—as the effect of absolute want of health , for which some change in her mode of life would be the best cure . She might bid him begone in what language she would . He knew well that such was her intention . But he would not allow a word coming from her in such a way to disturb arrangements made for the happiness of their joint lives . As a loving husband would treat a wife , who , in some exceptionable moment of a melancholy malady , should declare herself unable to remain longer in her home , so would he treat her . As for accepting what she might say as his dismissal , he would as soon think of taking the fruit - trees from the southern wall because the sun sometimes shines from the north . He could not treat either his interests or hers so lightly as that . "
50829	50830	50831	50831	I	0	" "
50836	50837	50831	50831	I	0	" "

50945	50946	50922	50922	you	337	" "
50995	51039	50987	50987	you	337	" Then he put his hand upon her hair , as though he would caress her . But this she would not suffer , so she rose slowly , and stood with her hand upon the table in the middle of the room . "
51043	51047	51040	51041	Mr. Grey	353	" she said . "
51066	51067	51055	51055	I	0	" "
51071	51075	51068	51069	Mr. Grey	353	" she continued , "

51470	51717	51468	51468	yours	353	" He shook his head and still smiled . There was something in the imperturbed security of his manner which almost made her angry with him . It seemed as though he assumed so great a superiority that he felt himself able to treat any resolve of hers as the petulance of a child . And though he spoke in strong language of his love , and of his longing that she should come to him , yet he was so well able to command his feelings , that he showed no sign of grief at the communication she had made to him . She did not doubt his love , but she believed him to be so much the master of his love,—as he was the master of everything else , that her separation from him would cause him no uncontrollable grief . In that she utterly failed to understand his character . Had she known him better , she might have been sure that such a separation now would with him have carried its mark to the grave . Should he submit to her decision , he would go home and settle himself to his books the next day ; but on no following day would he be again capable of walking forth among his flowers with an easy heart . He was a strong , constant man , perhaps over - conscious of his own strength ; but then his strength was great . "
51722	51730	51468	51468	yours	353	" Alice had said to herself often . "
51738	51755	51733	51733	he	2005	" He did not stay with her long after the last word that has been recorded . "
51758	51773	51733	51733	he	2005	" he said , as for a moment he held her hand at parting , "
51783	51784	51774	51774	I	0	" "

51867	51896	51865	51865	Alice	337	" Then he went , and she sat there on the sofa without moving , till she heard her father 's feet as he came up the stairs . "

52106	52133	52104	52104	papa	8677	" Mr. Vavasor , as he went up to his bedroom , felt sure that there had been something wrong between his daughter and her lover . "
52147	52153	52154	52154	he	353	" he said to himself , "
52181	53346	52165	52165	he	353	" Alice , before she went to bed , sat down and wrote a letter to her cousin Kate . It can not perhaps fairly be said that George Vavasor was an unhospitable man , seeing that it was his custom to entertain his friends occasionally at Greenwich , Richmond , or such places ; and he would now and again have a friend to dine with him at his club . But he never gave breakfasts , dinners , or suppers under his own roof . During a short period of his wine - selling career , at which time he had occupied handsome rooms over his place of business in New Burlington Street , he had presided at certain feasts given to customers or expectant customers by the firm ; but he had not found this employment to his taste , and had soon relinquished it to one of the other partners . Since that he had lived in lodgings in Cecil Street,—down at the bottom of that retired nook , near to the river and away from the Strand . Here he had simply two rooms on the first floor , and hither his friends came to him very rarely . They came very rarely on any account . A stray man might now and then pass an hour with him here ; but on such occasions the chances were that the visit had some reference , near or distant , to affairs of business . Eating or drinking there was never any to be found here by the most intimate of his allies . His lodgings were his private retreat , and they were so private that but few of his friends knew where he lived . And had it been possible he would have wished that no one should have known his whereabouts . I am not aware that he had any special reason for this peculiarity , or that there was anything about his mode of life that required hiding ; but he was a man who had always lived as though secrecy in certain matters might at any time become useful to him . He had a mode of dressing himself when he went out at night that made it almost impossible that any one should recognise him . The people at his lodgings did not even know that he had relatives , and his nearest relatives hardly knew that he had lodgings . Even Kate had never been at the rooms in Cecil Street , and addressed all her letters to his place of business or his club . He was a man who would bear no inquiry into himself . If he had been out of view for a month , and his friends asked him where he had been , he always answered the question falsely , or left it unanswered . There are many men of whom everybody knows all about all their belongings;—as to whom everybody knows where they live , whither they go , what is their means , and how they spend it . But there are others of whom no man knows anything , and George Vavasor was such a one . For myself I like the open babbler the best . Babbling may be a weakness , but to my thinking mystery is a vice . Vavasor also maintained another little establishment , down in Oxfordshire ; but the two establishments did not even know of each other 's existence . There was a third , too , very closely hidden from the world 's eye , which shall be nameless ; but of the establishment in Oxfordshire he did sometimes speak , in very humble words , among his friends . When he found himself among hunting men , he would speak of his two nags at Roebury , saying that he had never yet been able to mount a regular hunting stable , and that he supposed he never would ; but that there were at Roebury two indifferent beasts of his if any one chose to buy them . And men very often did buy Vavasor 's horses . When he was on them they always went well and sold themselves readily . And though he thus spoke of two , and perhaps did not keep more during the summer , he always seemed to have horses enough when he was down in the country . No one even knew George Vavasor not to hunt because he was short of stuff . And here , at Roebury , he kept a trusty servant , an ancient groom with two little bushy grey eyes which looked as though they could see through a stable door . Many were the long whisperings which George and Bat Smithers carried on at the stable door , in the very back depth of the yard attached to the hunting inn at Roebury . Bat regarded his master as a man wholly devoted to horses , but often wondered why he was not more regular in his sojournings in Oxfordshire . Of any other portion of his master 's life Bat knew nothing . Bat could give the address of his master 's club in London , but he could give no other address . But though Vavasor 's private lodgings were so very private , he had , nevertheless , taken some trouble in adorning them . The furniture in the sitting - room was very neat , and the book - shelves were filled with volumes that shone with gilding on their backs . The inkstand , the paper - weight , the envelope case on his writing - table were all handsome . He had a single good portrait of a woman 's head hanging on one of his walls . He had a special place adapted for his pistols , others for his foils , and again another for his whips . The room was as pretty a bachelor 's room as you would wish to enter , but you might see , by the position of the single easy - chair that was brought forward , that it was seldom appropriated to the comfort of more than one person . Here he sat lounging over his breakfast , late on a Sunday morning in September , when all the world was out of town . He was reading a letter which had just been brought down to him from his club . Though the writer of it was his sister Kate , she had not been privileged to address it to his private lodgings . He read it very quickly , running rapidly over its contents , and then threw it aside from him as though it were of no moment , keeping , however , an enclosure in his hand . And yet the letter was of much moment , and made him think deeply . "
53354	53358	53348	53348	I	0	" said he , "
53375	53981	53983	53983	you	2018	" The reader will hardly require to be told that the him in question was John Grey , and that Kate 's letter was one instigating her brother to renew his love affair with Alice . And Vavasor was in truth well inclined to renew it , and would have begun the renewing it at once , had he not doubted his power with his cousin . Indeed it has been seen that he had already attempted some commencement of such renewal at Basle . He had told Kate more than once that Alice 's fortune was not much , and that her beauty was past its prime ; and he would no doubt repeat the same objections to his sister with some pretence of disinclination . It was not his custom to show his hand to the players at any game that he played . But he was , in truth , very anxious to obtain from Alice a second promise of her hand . How soon after that he might marry her , would be another question . Perhaps it was not Alice 's beauty that he coveted , nor yet her money exclusively . Nevertheless he thought her very beautiful , and was fully aware that her money would be of great service to him . But I believe that he was true in that word that he spoke to himself , and that his chief attraction was the delight which he would have in robbing Mr. Grey of his wife . Alice had once been his love , had clung to his side , had whispered love to him , and he had enough of the weakness of humanity in him to feel the soreness arising from her affection for another . When she broke away from him he had acknowledged that he had been wrong , and when , since her engagement with Mr. Grey , he had congratulated her , he had told her in his quiet , half - whispered , impressive words how right she was ; but not the less , therefore , did he feel himself hurt that John Grey should be her lover . And when he had met this man he had spoken well of him to his sister , saying that he was a gentleman , a scholar , and a man of parts ; but not the less had he hated him from the first moment of his seeing him . Such hatred under such circumstances was almost pardonable . But George Vavasor , when he hated , was apt to follow up his hatred with injury . He could not violently dislike a man and yet not wish to do him any harm . At present , as he sat lounging in his chair , he thought that he would like to marry his cousin Alice ; but he was quite sure that he would like to be the means of putting a stop to the proposed marriage between Alice and John Grey . Kate had been very false to her friend , and had sent up to her brother the very letter which Alice had written to her after that meeting in Queen Anne Street which was described in the last chapter,—or rather a portion of it , for with the reserve common to women she had kept back the other half . Alice had declared to herself that she would be sure of her cousin 's sympathy , and had written out all her heart on the matter , as was her wo nt when writing to Kate . "
53987	53991	53983	53983	you	2018	" she wrote , "
54146	54239	54240	54240	She	2023	" This letter from Alice to Kate , Vavasor read over and over again , though Kate 's letter to himself , which was the longer one , he had thrown aside after the first glance . There was nothing that he could learn from that . He was as good a judge of the manner in which he would play his own game as Kate could be ; but in this matter he was to learn how he would play his game from a knowledge of the other girl 's mind . "
54250	54256	54258	54258	she	2023	" he said to himself , "
54309	54498	54499	54500	A gentleman	998	" Then he threw her letter after Kate 's , and betook himself to his newspaper and his cigar . It was two hours after this , and he still wore his dressing - gown , and he was still lounging in his easy - chair , when the waiting - maid at the lodgings brought him up word that a gentleman wished to see him . Vavasor kept no servant of his own except that confidential groom down at Bicester . It was a rule with him that people could be better served and cheaper served by other people 's servants than by their own . Even in the stables at Bicester the innkeeper had to find what assistance was wanted , and charge for it in the bill . And George Vavasor was no Sybarite . He did not deem it impracticable to put on his own trousers without having a man standing at his foot to hold up the leg of the garment . A valet about a man knows a great deal of a man 's ways , and therefore George had no valet . "
54502	54509	54499	54500	A gentleman	998	" said he to the girl . "
54521	54522	54527	54527	he	818	" "
54530	54535	54527	54527	he	818	" said the girl . "
54541	54578	54538	54538	him	818	" said George . And the gentleman was a public - house keeper . Vavasor was pretty sure of his visitor before he desired the servant to give him entrance . It was Mr. Grimes from the "
54581	54953	54527	54527	he	818	" public - house and tavern , in the Brompton Road , and he had come by appointment to have a little conversation with Mr. Vavasor on matters political . Mr. Grimes was a man who knew that business was business , and as such had some considerable weight in his own neighbourhood . With him politics was business , as well as beer , and omnibus - horses , and foreign wines;—in the fabrication of which latter article Mr. Grimes was supposed to have an extended experience . To such as him , when intent on business , Mr. Vavasor was not averse to make known the secrets of his lodging - house ; and now , when the idle of London world was either at morning church or still in bed , Mr. Grimes had come out by appointment to do a little political business with the lately - rejected member for the Chelsea Districts . Vavasor had been , as I have said , lately rejected , and the new member who had beaten him at the hustings had sat now for one session in parliament . Under his present reign he was destined to the honour of one other session , and then the period of his existing glory,—for which he was said to have paid nearly six thousand pounds,—would be over . But he might be elected again , perhaps for a full period of six sessions ; and it might be hoped that this second election would be conducted on more economical principles . To this , the economical view of the matter , Mr. Grimes was very much opposed , and was now waiting upon George Vavasor in Cecil Street , chiefly with the object of opposing the new member 's wishes on this head . No doubt Mr. Grimes was personally an advocate for the return of Mr. Vavasor , and would do all in his power to prevent the re - election of the young Lord Kilfenora , whose father , the Marquis of Bunratty , had scattered that six thousand pounds among the electors and non - electors of Chelsea ; but his main object was that money should be spent . "
54960	54974	54527	54527	he	818	" he said to a confidential friend in the same way of business ; "
55052	55076	55036	55036	Anybody'd	2034	" And so , that the game might not go by , Mr. Grimes was now present in Mr. George Vavasor 's rooms . "
55081	55085	55078	55079	Mr. Grimes	434	" said George , "
55121	55122	55127	55128	Mr. Vavasor	357	" "
55130	55154	55127	55128	Mr. Vavasor	357	" said the publican , after having made his salute , and having taken his chair with some little show of mock modesty . "
55193	55194	55190	55191	Mr. Vavasor	357	" "
55235	55236	55224	55224	you	357	" "
55334	55335	55328	55328	You	357	" "
55362	55363	55346	55346	you	357	" "
55476	55477	55490	55490	You	357	" "
55494	55495	55490	55490	You	357	" "
55622	55821	55824	55824	Scruby	435	" Mr. Grimes was a stout man , not very tall , with a mottled red face , and large protruding eyes . As regards his own person , Mr. Grimes might have been taken as a fair sample of the English innkeeper , as described for many years past . But in his outer garments he was very unlike that description . He wore a black , swallow - tailed coat , made , however , to set very loose upon his back , a black waistcoat , and black pantaloons . He carried , moreover , in his hands a black chimney - pot hat . Not only have the top - boots and breeches vanished from the costume of innkeepers , but also the long , particoloured waistcoat , and the birds'-eye fogle round their necks . They get themselves up to look like Dissenting ministers or undertakers , except that there is still a something about their rosy gills which tells a tale of the spigot and corkscrew . Mr. Grimes had only just finished the tale of his own hard ways as a publican , when the door - bell was again rung . "
55826	55831	55824	55824	Scruby	435	" said George Vavasor , "
55840	55849	55850	55851	another gent	2055	" The handmaiden at George Vavasor 's lodgings announced "
55853	55874	55850	55851	another gent	2055	" and then Mr. Scruby entered the room in which were seated George , and Mr. Grimes the publican from the "
55877	56065	55850	55851	another gent	2055	" on the Brompton Road . Mr. Scruby was an attorney from Great Marlborough Street , supposed to be very knowing in the ways of metropolitan elections ; and he had now stepped round , as he called it , with the object of saying a few words to Mr. Grimes , partly on the subject of the forthcoming contest at Chelsea , and partly on that of the contest last past . These words were to be said in the presence of Mr. Vavasor , the person interested . That some other words had been spoken between Mr. Scruby and Mr. Grimes on the same subjects behind Mr. Vavasor 's back I think very probable . But even though this might have been so I am not prepared to say that Mr. Vavasor had been deceived by their combinations . The two men were very civil to each other in their salutations , the attorney assuming an air of patronizing condescension , always calling the other Grimes ; whereas Mr. Scruby was treated with considerable deference by the publican , and was always called Mr. Scruby . "
56070	56082	55850	55851	another gent	2055	" said the publican as soon as these salutations were over ; "
56091	56092	56088	56089	Mr. Scruby	435	" "

56154	56177	56151	56152	Mr. Scruby	435	" Mr. Scruby acknowledged that it was quiet , especially looking out over the river , and then they proceeded to business . "

59090	59120	59121	59121	Young	2151	" With that , he got up and bowed the attorney out of the room , with just a little more ceremony than he had shown to the publican . "
59123	59135	59121	59121	Young	2151	" said Vavasor to himself , when he was left alone . "
59190	59242	59152	59152	One	1066	" Then he took out a little memorandum - book from his breast - pocket , and having made in it an entry as to the amount and date of that bill which he had just accepted on the publican 's behalf , he conned over the particulars of its pages . "
59251	59263	59152	59152	One	1066	" he said to himself when he had completed the study . "
59323	59554	59555	59555	I	0	" Soon after that he dressed himself slowly , reading a little every now and then as he did so . When his toilet was completed , and his Sunday newspapers sufficiently perused , he took up his hat and umbrella and sauntered out . Kate Vavasor had sent to her brother only the first half of her cousin 's letter , that half in which Alice had attempted to describe what had taken place between her and Mr. Grey . In doing this , Kate had been a wicked traitor,—a traitor to that feminine faith against which treason on the part of one woman is always unpardonable in the eyes of other women . But her treason would have been of a deeper die had she sent the latter portion , for in that Alice had spoken of George Vavasor himself . But even of this treason , Kate would , I think , have been guilty , had the words which Alice wrote been of a nature to serve her own purpose if read by her brother . But they had not been of this nature . They had spoken of George as a man with whom any closer connection than that which existed at present was impossible , and had been written with the view of begging Kate to desist from making futile attempts in that direction . "
59560	59565	59557	59557	myself	0	" Alice had said , "
59648	59661	59635	59635	you	2163	" This part of Alice 's letter Kate had not sent to George Vavasor;—"But
59668	59692	59635	59635	you	2163	" Kate had said , as she read the words for the second time , and then put the papers into her desk . "
59697	61095	59635	59635	you	2163	" To give Kate Vavasor her due , she was , at any rate , unselfish in her intrigues . She was obstinately persistent , and she was moreover unscrupulous , but she was not selfish . Many years ago she had made up her mind that George and Alice should be man and wife , feeling that such a marriage would be good at any rate for her brother . It had been almost brought about , and had then been hindered altogether through a fault on her brother 's part . But she had forgiven him this sin as she had forgiven many others , and she was now at work in his behalf again , determined that they two should be married , even though neither of them might be now anxious that it should be so . The intrigue itself was dear to her , and success in it was necessary to her self - respect . She answered Alice 's letter with a pleasant , gossiping epistle , which shall be recorded , as it will tell us something of Mrs. Greenow 's proceedings at Yarmouth . Kate had promised to stay at Yarmouth for a month , but she had already been there six weeks , and was still under her aunt 's wing . Yarmouth , October , 186––. Dearest Alice , Of course I am delighted . It is no good saying that I am not . I know how difficult it is to deal with you , and therefore I sit down to answer your letter with fear and trembling , lest I should say a word too much , and thereby drive you back , or not say quite enough and thereby fail to encourage you on . Of course I am glad . I have long thought that Mr. Grey could not make you happy , and as I have thought so , how can I not be glad ? It is no use saying that he is good and noble , and all that sort of thing . I have never denied it . But he was not suited to you , and his life would have made you wretched . Ergo , I rejoice . And as you are the dearest friend I have , of course I rejoice mightily . I can understand accurately the sort of way in which the interview went . Of course he had the best of it . I can see him so plainly as he stood up in unruffled self - possession , ignoring all that you said , suggesting that you were feverish or perhaps bilious , waving his hand over you a little , as though that might possibly do you some small good , and then taking his leave with an assurance that it would be all right as soon as the wind changed . I suppose it 's very noble in him , not taking you at your word , and giving you , as it were , another chance ; but there is a kind of nobility which is almost too great for this world . I think very well of you , my dear , as women go , but I do not think well enough of you to believe that you are fit to be Mr. John Grey 's wife . Of course I 'm very glad . You have known my mind from the first to the last , and , therefore , what would be the good of my mincing matters ? No woman wishes her dearest friend to marry a man to whom she herself is antipathetic . You would have been as much lost to me , had you become Mrs. Grey of Nethercoats , Cambridgeshire , as though you had gone to heaven . I do n't say but what Nethercoats may be a kind of heaven,—but then one does n't wish one 's friend that distant sort of happiness . A flat Eden I can fancy it , hemmed in by broad dykes , in which cream and eggs are very plentiful , where an Adam and an Eve might drink the choicest tea out of the finest china , with toast buttered to perfection , from year 's end to year 's end ; into which no money troubles would ever find their way , nor yet any naughty novels . But such an Eden is not tempting to me , nor , as I think , to you . I can fancy you stretching your poor neck over the dyke , longing to fly away that you might cease to be at rest , but knowing that the matrimonial dragon was too strong for any such flight . If ever bird banged his wings to pieces against gilded bars , you would have banged yours to pieces in that cage . You say that you have failed to make him understand that the matter is settled . I need not say that of course it is settled , and that he must be made to understand it . You owe it to him now to put him out of all doubt . He is , I suppose , accessible to the words of a mortal , god though he be . But I do not fear about this , for , after all , you have as much firmness about you as most people;—perhaps as much as he has at bottom , though you may not have so many occasions to show it . As to that other matter I can only say that you shall be obliged , as far as it is in my power to obey you . For what may come out from me by word of mouth when we are together , I will not answer with certainty . But my pen is under better control , and it shall not write the offending name . And now I must tell you a little about myself;—or rather , I am inclined to spin a yarn , and tell you a great deal . I have got such a lover ! But I did describe him before . Of course it 's Mr. Cheesacre . If I were to say he has n't declared himself , I should hardly give you a fair idea of my success . And yet he has not declared himself,—and , which is worse , is very anxious to marry a rival . But it 's a strong point in my favour that my rival wants him to take me , and that he will assuredly be driven to make me an offer sooner or later , in obedience to her orders . My aunt is my rival , and I do not feel the least doubt as to his having offered to her half a dozen times . But then she has another lover , Captain Bellfield , and I see that she prefers him . He is a penniless scamp and looks as though he drank . He paints his whiskers too , which I do n't like ; and , being forty , tries to look like twenty - five . Otherwise he is agreeable enough , and I rather approve of my aunt 's taste in preferring him . But my lover has solid attractions , and allures me on by a description of the fat cattle which he sends to market . He is a man of substance , and should I ever become Mrs. Cheesacre , I have reason to think that I shall not be left in want . We went up to his place on a visit the other day . Oileymead is the name of my future home;—not so pretty as Nethercoats , is it ? And we had such a time there ! We reached the place at ten and left it at four , and he managed to give us three meals . I 'm sure we had before our eyes at different times every bit of china , delf , glass , and plate in the establishment . He made us go into the cellar , and told us how much wine he had got there , and how much beer . "
61110	61134	61102	61103	Mrs. Greenow	405	" he said , turning round to my aunt , with a pathetic earnestness , for which I had hardly given him credit . "
61189	61267	61297	61297	he	2169	" And then he winked his eye as though bidding my aunt to think of that before she encouraged such a lover as Bellfield . He took us into every bedroom , and disclosed to us all the glories of his upper chambers . It would have done you good to see him lifting the counterpanes , and bidding my aunt feel the texture of the blankets ! And then to see her turn round to me and say:—"Kate
61283	61289	61291	61291	I.	0	life!"—"It does seem very comfortable , "
61292	61295	61297	61297	he	2169	" Comfortable ! "
61299	61317	61297	61297	he	2169	" Yes , I do n't think there 's anybody can say that Oileymead is n't comfortable . "
61386	61390	61392	61392	he	2169	" Mrs. Greenow , "
61394	61399	61401	61401	he	2169	" look at that , "
61416	61421	61401	61401	he	2169	" Look at that ! "
61422	61429	61431	61432	my aunt	9039	" There 's a great deal , "
61434	61439	61441	61441	he	2169	" I believe you , "
61443	61471	61441	61441	he	2169	" I 've more muck upon this place here than any farmer in Norfolk , gentle or simple ; I do n't care who the other is . "
61544	61553	61554	61554	she	9039	" He wants a wife , my dear , "
61557	61573	61554	61554	she	9039	" and you may pick him up to - morrow by putting out your hand . "
61600	61606	61607	61607	she	9039	" Money 's never dirty , "
61610	61617	61607	61607	she	9039	" nor yet what makes money . "
61981	61988	61989	61989	she	356	" I will go to Cheltenham , "
61994	62025	61989	61989	she	356	" He has recommended it . I shall never be his wife;—but , till we have parted altogether , I will show him that I think well of his advice . "
62211	62217	62218	62218	she	356	" I tell you this , "
62221	62265	62218	62218	she	356	" in consequence of what you said to me on the matter . My father will know it to - morrow , and on the following morning I shall start for Cheltenham . I have heard from Lady Macleod and she expects me . "
62286	62289	62291	62291	he	805	" What ! "
62306	62314	62291	62291	he	805	" What ! not marry John Grey ! "
62315	62329	62273	62273	her	356	" No , papa ; I know how strange you must think it . "
62330	62341	62291	62291	he	805	" And you say that there has been no quarrel . "
62342	62367	62291	62291	he	805	" No;—there has been no quarrel . By degrees I have learned to feel that I should not make him happy as his wife . "
62368	62374	62376	62377	Mr. Vavasor	357	" It 's d––––d nonsense , "
62401	62415	62395	62395	he	805	" Oh , papa ! do n't talk to me in that way . "
62416	62454	62291	62291	he	805	" But it is . I never heard such trash in my life . If he comes to me I shall tell him so . Not make him happy ! Why ca n't you make him happy ? "
62455	62464	62291	62291	he	805	" We are not suited to each other . "
62465	62479	62395	62395	he	805	" But what 's the matter with him ? He 's a gentleman . "
62480	62488	62291	62291	he	805	" Yes ; he 's a gentleman . "
62489	62572	62291	62291	he	805	" And a man of honour , and with good means , and with all that knowledge and reading which you profess to like . Look here , Alice ; I am not going to interfere , nor shall I attempt to make you marry anyone . You are your own mistress as far as that is concerned . But I do hope , for your sake and for mine,—I do hope that there is nothing again between you and your cousin . "
62573	62580	62395	62395	he	805	" There is nothing , papa . "
62581	62644	62291	62291	he	805	" I did not like your going abroad with him , though I did n't choose to interrupt your plan by saying so . But if there were anything of that kind going on , I should be bound to tell you that your cousin 's position at present is not a good one . Men do not speak well of him . "
62645	62669	62291	62291	he	805	" There is nothing between us , papa ; but if there were , men speaking ill of him would not deter me . "
62670	62695	62395	62395	he	805	" And men speaking well of Mr. Grey will not do the other thing . I know very well that women can be obstinate . "
62696	62712	62291	62291	he	805	" I have n't come to this resolution without thinking much about it , papa . "
62713	62777	62291	62291	he	805	" I suppose not . Well;—I ca n't say anything more . You are your own mistress , and your fortune is in your own keeping . I ca n't make you marry John Grey . I think you very foolish , and if he comes to me I shall tell him so . You are going down to Cheltenham , are you ? "
62778	62789	62395	62395	he	805	" Yes , papa ; I have promised Lady Macleod . "
62790	62811	62813	62813	he	2200	" Very well . I 'd sooner it should be you than me ; that 's all I can say . "
62911	62921	62908	62908	his	2200	" any man alive should ever rear a daughter . "
62970	62978	62979	62979	he	2200	" She 's got her own money , "
62984	63026	62979	62979	he	2200	" and what does it matter ? I do n't suppose she 'll marry her cousin . I do n't think she 's fool enough for that . And after all she 'll probably make it up again with John Grey . "
63422	63438	63439	63439	he	357	" She can turn it all into capital to - morrow , if she pleases , "
63496	63503	63505	63505	he	357	" walking atop of John Grey , "
63524	63537	63539	63539	George	357	" You must have thought I had vanished out of the world , "
63562	63571	63572	63572	she	362	" Somebody told me that you were shooting , "
63578	63634	63572	63572	she	362	" So I was , but my shooting is not like the shooting of your great Nimrods,—men who are hunters upon the earth . Two days among the grouse and two more among the partridges are about the extent of it . Capel Court is the preserve in which I am usually to be found . "
63645	63650	63572	63572	she	362	" Oh , indeed . "
63651	63658	63659	63659	George	357	" Have you heard from Kate ? "
63662	63678	63659	63659	George	357	" Yes , once or twice ; she is still at Yarmouth with Aunt Greenow . "
63679	63740	63572	63572	she	362	" And is going to Norwich , as she says . Kate seems to have made a league with Aunt Greenow . I , who do n't pretend to be very disinterested in money matters , think that she is quite right . No doubt Aunt Greenow may marry again , but friends with forty thousand pounds are always agreeable . "
63741	63753	63755	63755	Alice	362	" I do n't believe that Kate thinks much of that , "
63757	63809	63755	63755	Alice	362	" Not so much as she ought , I dare say . Poor Kate is not a rich woman , or , I fear , likely to become one . She does n't seem to dream of getting married , and her own fortune is less than a hundred a year . "
63810	63829	63831	63831	Alice	362	" Girls who never dream of getting married are just those who make the best marriages at last , "
63833	63856	63831	63831	Alice	362	" Perhaps so , but I wish I was easier about Kate . She is the best sister a man ever had . "
63857	63862	63755	63755	Alice	362	" Indeed she is . "
63863	63935	63755	63755	Alice	362	" And I have done nothing for her as yet . I did think , while I was in that wine business , that I could have done anything I pleased for her . But my grandfather 's obstinacy put me out of that ; and now I 'm beginning the world again,—that is , comparatively . I wonder whether you think I 'm wrong in trying to get into Parliament ? "
63936	63972	63831	63831	Alice	362	" No ; quite right . I admire you for it . It is just what I would do in your place . You are unmarried , and have a right to run the risk . "
63973	63985	63987	63987	he	2223	" I am so glad to hear you speak like that , "
64030	64037	64019	64019	he	2223	" I have always thought so . "
64038	64046	63755	63755	Alice	362	" But you have never said it . "
64047	64057	63831	63831	Alice	362	" Have n't I ? I thought I had . "
64058	64121	64019	64019	he	2223	" Not heartily like that . I know that people abuse me;—my own people , my grandfather , and probably your father,—saying that I am reckless and the rest of it . I do risk everything for my object ; but I do not know that any one can blame me,—unless it be Kate . To whom else do I owe anything ? "
64122	64129	63755	63755	Alice	362	" Kate does not blame you . "
64130	64149	64151	64151	he	2226	" No ; she sympathizes with me ; she , and she only , unless it be you . "
64163	64214	64158	64158	she	2227	" She is brave enough to give me her hearty sympathy . But perhaps for that very reason I ought to be the more chary in endangering the only support that she is like to have . What is ninety pounds a year for the maintenance of a single lady ? "
64215	64226	64228	64228	Alice	362	" I hope that Kate will always live with me , "
64230	64246	64228	64228	Alice	362	" that is , as soon as she has lost her home at Vavasor Hall . "
64330	64334	64336	64336	he	2226	" What;—at Nethercoats ? "
64338	64379	64336	64336	he	2226	" Neither she nor I doubt your love , but few men would like such an intruder as that into their household , and of all men Mr. Grey , whose nature is retiring , would like it the least . "
64380	64388	64390	64390	Alice	362	" I was not thinking of Nethercoats , "
64392	64423	64390	64390	Alice	362	" Ah , no ; that is it , you see . Kate says so often to me that when you are married she will be alone in the world . "
64424	64441	64336	64336	he	2226	" I do n't think she will ever find that I shall separate myself from her . "
64442	64509	64510	64510	Alice	362	" No ; not by any will of your own . Poor Kate ! You can not be surprised that she should think of your marriage with dread . How much of her life has been made up of her companionship with you;—and all the best of it too ! You ought not to be angry with her for regarding your withdrawal into Cambridgeshire with dismay . "
64581	64589	64590	64590	she	362	" Kate may still live with me , "
64594	64604	64590	64590	she	362	" Everything is over between me and Mr. Grey . "
64605	64610	64590	64590	she	362	" Alice!—is that true ? "
64611	64640	64590	64590	she	362	" Yes , George ; it is true . If you will allow me to say so , I would rather not talk about it;—not just at present . "
64641	64648	64590	64590	she	362	" And does Kate know it ? "
64649	64656	64590	64590	she	362	" Yes , Kate knows it . "
64657	64662	64590	64590	she	362	" And my uncle ? "
64663	64671	64590	64590	she	362	" Yes , papa knows it also . "
64672	64711	64590	64590	she	362	" Alice , how can I help speaking of it ? How can I not tell you that I am rejoiced that you are saved from a thraldom which I have long felt sure would break your heart ? "
64712	64721	64590	64590	she	362	" Pray do not talk of it further . "
64722	64751	64590	64590	she	362	" Well ; if I am forbidden I shall of course obey . But I own it is hard to me . How can I not congratulate you ? "
64775	64789	64790	64790	he	2232	" Yes , Alice , I understand . You are angry with me , "
64793	64866	64790	64790	he	2232	" And yet you have no right to be surprised that when you tell me this I should think of all that passed between us in Switzerland . Surely the cousin who was with you then has a right to say what he thinks of this change in your life ; at any rate he may do so , if as in this case he approves altogether of what you are doing . "
64867	64887	64918	64918	She	2234	" I am glad of your approval , George ; but pray let that be an end to it . "
64999	65010	65011	65011	he	2232	" Do you remember asking me whether I ever shivered , "
65016	65040	65011	65011	he	2232	" — whether I ever thought of things that made me shiver ? Do n't you remember ; on the bridge at Basle ? "
65041	65047	65221	65221	he	2236	" Yes ; I remember . "
65048	65075	65011	65011	he	2232	" Well , Alice;—one cause for my shivering is over . I wo n't say more than that now . Shall you remain long at Cheltenham ? "
65076	65081	65011	65011	he	2232	" Just a month . "
65082	65090	65011	65011	he	2232	" And then you come back here ? "
65091	65117	65221	65221	he	2236	" I suppose so . Papa and I will probably go down to Vavasor Hall before Christmas . How much before I can not say . "
65118	65144	65011	65011	he	2232	" I shall see you at any rate after your return from Cheltenham ? Of course Kate will know , and she will tell me . "
65145	65169	65011	65011	he	2232	" Yes ; Kate will know . I suppose she will stay here when she comes up from Norfolk . Good - bye . "
65170	65211	65011	65011	he	2232	" Good - bye , Alice . I shall have fewer fits of that inward shivering that you spoke of,—many less , on account of what I have now heard . God bless you , Alice ; good - bye . "
65212	65219	65011	65011	he	2232	" Good - bye , George . "
65498	65504	65505	65505	he	2236	" I can understand well , "
65511	65554	65505	65505	he	2236	" what your present feelings are ; but I do not think you will be really angry with me because I have been unable to repress my joy at what I can not but regard as your release from a great misfortune . "
65559	65563	65564	65564	she	2237	" My release ! "
65578	65617	65564	65564	she	2237	" My release from a misfortune ! No;—but my fall from heaven ! Oh , what a man he is ! That he should have loved me , and that I should have driven him away from me ! "
65930	65939	65940	65940	she	2237	" I should be very humble to him , "
65943	65960	65940	65940	she	2237	" but he is so good , that I may dare to be humble before him . "
66835	66838	66839	66839	she	350	" Alice ! "
66854	66863	66839	66839	she	350	" oh , Alice , what is this ? "
66864	66877	66843	66843	she	350	" Yes , aunt ; it is very bad , I know , "
66889	66923	66880	66880	Alice	350	" Young ladies are very wicked when they do n't know their own minds . But if they have n't known them and have been wicked , what can they do but repent ? "
66924	66927	66929	66930	Lady Macleod	342	" Repent ! "
66932	66950	66929	66930	Lady Macleod	342	" Yes ; I hope you will repent . Poor Mr. Grey;—what must he think of it ? "
66951	66972	66880	66880	Alice	350	" I can only hope , aunt , that he wo n't think of it at all for very long . "
66973	66997	66880	66880	Alice	350	" That 's nonsense , my dear , Of course he 'll think of it , and of course you 'll marry him . "
66998	67004	66929	66930	Lady Macleod	342	" Shall I , aunt ? "
67005	67093	66880	66880	Alice	350	" Of course you will . Why , Alice , has n't it been all settled among families ? Lady Midlothian knew all the particulars of it just as well as I did . And is not your word pledged to him ? I really do n't understand what you mean . I do n't see how it is possible you should go back . Gentlemen when they do that kind of thing are put out of society;—but I really think it is worse in a woman . "
67094	67118	66880	66880	Alice	350	" Then they may if they please put me out of society;—only that I do n't know that I 'm particularly in it . "
67119	67136	66880	66880	Alice	350	" And the wickedness of the thing , Alice ! I 'm obliged to say so . "
67137	67177	66880	66880	Alice	350	" When you talk to me about society , aunt , and about Lady Midlothian , I give up to you , willingly;—the more willingly , perhaps , because I do n't care much for one or the other . "
67214	67253	67192	67192	Alice	350	" But when you tell me about wickedness and my conscience , then I must be my own judge . It is my conscience , and the fear of committing wickedness , that has made me do this . "
67254	67267	66880	66880	Alice	350	" You should submit to be guided by your elders , Alice . "
67268	67315	66880	66880	Alice	350	" No ; my elders in such a matter as this can not teach me . It can not be right that I should go to a man 's house and be his wife , if I do not think that I can make him happy . "
67316	67324	67192	67192	Alice	350	" Then why did you accept him ? "
67325	67381	66880	66880	Alice	350	" Because I was mistaken . I am not going to defend that . If you choose to scold me for that , you may do so , aunt , and I will not answer you . But as to marrying him or not marrying him now,—as to that , I must judge for myself . "
67382	67396	66880	66880	Alice	350	" It was a pity you did not know your own mind earlier . "
67397	67459	67192	67192	Alice	350	" It was a pity,—a great pity . I have done myself an injury that is quite irretrievable;—I know that , and am prepared to bear it . I have done him , too , an injustice which I regret with my whole heart . I can only excuse myself by saying that I might have done him a worse injustice . "
67572	67578	67580	67581	her ladyship	8703	" Well , my dear , "
67583	67611	67580	67581	her ladyship	8703	" I suppose you will like to go up - stairs and take off your bonnet . Mary shall bring you some tea when you come down . "
67664	67669	67643	67643	She	350	" poor Mr. Grey , "
67910	67923	67924	67924	she	342	" Did John Grey still wish that the match should go on ? "
68441	68454	68457	68458	Lady Macleod	342	" There 's nothing the matter , my dear , at all , "
68566	68569	68570	68570	she	342	" Alice , "
68573	68583	68570	68570	she	342	" I expect a visitor here to - day . "
68605	68611	68612	68612	she	337	" A visitor , aunt , "
68623	68652	68612	68612	she	337	" Yes , Alice a visitor . I should have told you before , only I thought,—I thought I had better not . It is Mr.—Mr . Grey . "
68653	68665	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" Indeed , aunt ! Is he coming to see you ? "
68666	68719	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" Well;—he is desirous no doubt of seeing you more especially ; but he has expressed a wish to make my acquaintance , which I can not , under the circumstances , think is unnatural . Of course , Alice , he must want to talk over this affair with your friends . "
68720	68729	68612	68612	she	337	" I wish I could have spared them , "
68731	68736	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	Alice,—"I wish I could . "
68737	68825	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" I have brought his letter here , and you can see it if you please . It is very nicely written , and as far as I am concerned I should not think of refusing to see him . And now comes the question . What are we to do with him ? Am I to ask him to dinner ? I take it for granted that he will not expect me to offer him a bed , as he knows that I live in lodgings . "
68826	68839	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" Oh no , aunt ; he certainly will not expect that . "
68840	68887	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" But ought I to ask him to dinner ? I should be most happy to entertain him , though you know how very scanty my means of doing so are;—but I really do not know how it might be,—between you and him , I mean . "
68888	68896	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" We should not fight , aunt . "
68897	68915	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" No , I suppose not;—but if you can not be affectionate in your manner to him — "
68916	68970	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" I will not answer for my manners , aunt ; but you may be sure of this,—that I should be affectionate in my heart . I shall always regard him as a dearly loved friend ; though for many years , no doubt , I shall be unable to express my friendship . "
68971	69006	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" That may be all very well , Alice , but it will not be what he will want . I think upon the whole that I had better not ask him to dinner . "
69007	69013	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" Perhaps not , aunt . "
69014	69062	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" It is a period of the day in which any special constraint among people is more disagreeable than at any other time , and then at dinner the servants must see it . I think there might be some awkwardness if he were to dine here . "
69063	69070	69072	69072	Alice	337	" I really think there would , "
69081	69160	69072	69072	Alice	337	" I hope he wo n't think that I am inhospitable . I should be so happy to do the best I could for him , for I regard him , Alice , quite as though he were to be your husband . And when anybody at all connected with me has come to Cheltenham I always have asked them to dine , and then I have Gubbins 's man to come and wait at table,—as you know . "
69161	69178	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" Of all men in the world Mr. Grey is the last to think about it . "
69179	69207	69072	69072	Alice	337	" That should only make me the more careful . But I think it would perhaps be more comfortable if he were to come in the evening . "
69208	69215	69072	69072	Alice	337	" Much more comfortable , aunt . "
69216	69259	68589	68591	the expected visitor	2333	" I suppose he will be here in the afternoon , before dinner , and we had better wait at home for him . I dare say he 'll want to see you alone , and therefore I 'll retire to my own rooms,"—looking
69268	69283	69285	69285	Alice	337	" But if you wish it , I will receive him first — and then Martha,"—Martha
69287	69292	69285	69285	Alice	337	maid—"can fetch you down . "
69705	69716	69717	69717	she	337	" At any rate it does not make him unhappy , "
69722	69728	69729	69729	he	353	" You are not angry , "
69732	69748	69729	69729	he	353	" that I should have followed you all the way here , to see you . "
69749	69779	69729	69729	he	353	" No , certainly ; not angry , Mr. Grey . All anger that there may be between us must be on your side . I feel that thoroughly . "
69780	69814	69729	69729	he	353	" Then there shall be none on either side . Whatever may be done , I will not be angry with you . Your father advised me to come down here to you . "
69815	69823	69729	69729	he	353	" You have seen him , then ? "
69824	69841	69729	69729	he	353	" Yes , I have seen him . I was in London the day you left . "
69842	69860	69729	69729	he	353	" It is so terrible to think that I should have brought upon you all this trouble . "
69861	69918	69729	69729	he	353	" You will bring upon me much worse trouble than that unless—. But I have not now come down here to tell you that . I believe that according to rule in such matters I should not have come to you at all , but I do n't know that I care much about such rules . "
69919	69929	69729	69729	he	353	" It is I that have broken all rules . "
69930	69948	69729	69729	he	353	" When a lady tells a gentleman that she does not wish to see more of him — "
69949	69962	69729	69729	he	353	" Oh , Mr. Grey , I have not told you that . "
69963	70073	69729	69729	he	353	" Have you not ? I am glad at any rate to hear you deny it . But you will understand what I mean . When a gentleman gets his dismissal from a lady he should accept it,—that is , his dismissal under such circumstances as I have received mine . But I can not lay down my love in that way ; nor , maintaining my love , can I give up the battle . It seems to me that I have a right at any rate to know something of your comings and goings as long as,—unless , Alice , you should take another name than mine . "
70074	70083	70085	70085	she	2345	" My intention is to keep my own . "
70102	70112	70095	70095	her	2345	" And you will not deny me that right ? "
70113	70142	69729	69729	he	353	" I can not hinder you . Whatever you may do , I myself have sinned so against you that I can have no right to blame you . "
70143	70172	69729	69729	he	353	" There shall be no question between us of injury from one to the other . In any conversation that we may have , or in any correspondence — "
70173	70186	69729	69729	he	353	" Oh , Mr. Grey , do not ask me to write . "
70187	70210	69729	69729	he	353	" Listen to me . Should there be any on either side , there shall be no idea of any wrong done . "
70211	70220	69729	69729	he	353	" But I have done you wrong;—great wrong . "
70221	70312	69729	69729	he	353	" No , Alice ; I will not have it so . When I asked you to accept my hand,—begging the greatest boon which it could ever come to my lot to ask from a fellow - mortal,—I knew well how great was your goodness to me when you told me that it should be mine . Now that you refuse it , I know also that you are good , thinking that in doing so you are acting for my welfare,—thinking more of my welfare than of your own . "
70313	70331	69729	69729	he	353	" Oh yes , yes ; it is so , Mr. Grey ; indeed it is so . "
70332	70423	70424	70424	She	2346	" Believing that , how can I talk of wrong ? That you are wrong in your thinking on this subject,—that your mind has become twisted by false impressions,—that I believe . But I can not therefore love you less,—nor , so believing , can I consider myself to be injured . Nor am I even so little selfish as you are . I think if you were my wife that I could make you happy ; but I feel sure that my happiness depends on your being my wife . "
70549	70566	70538	70538	he	353	" I hope — and believe that you will find your happiness elsewhere , Mr. Grey . "
70567	70723	70796	70796	he	2351	" Well ; we can but differ , Alice . In that we do differ . And now I will say one word to explain why I have come here . If I were to write to you against your will , it would seem that I were persecuting you . I can not bring myself to do that , even though I had the right . But if I were to let you go from me , taking what you have said to me and doing nothing , it would seem that I had accepted your decision as final . I do not do so . I will not do so . I come simply to tell you that I am still your suitor . If you will let me , I will see you again early in January,—as soon as you have returned to town . You will hardly refuse to see me . "
70724	70727	70728	70728	she	2350	" No , "
70731	70740	70728	70728	she	2350	" I can not refuse to see you . "
70741	70748	70749	70749	he	2351	" Then it shall be so , "
70752	70794	70749	70749	he	2351	" and I will not trouble you with letters , nor will I trouble you longer now with words . Tell your aunt that I have said what I came to say , and that I give her my kindest thanks . "
71637	71642	71644	71644	Maxwell	457	" Here 's Vavasor , "
71646	71671	71644	71644	Maxwell	457	" and now we wo n't play this blackguard game any longer . Somebody told me , Vavasor , that you were gone away . "
71672	71680	71632	71635	the sporting literary gentleman	2410	" Gone away;—what , like a fox ? "
71681	71777	71644	71644	Maxwell	457	" I do n't know what it was ; that something had happened to you since last season ; that you were married , or dead , or gone abroad . By George , I 've lost the trick after all ! I hate dummy like the devil . I never hold a card in dummy 's hand . Yes , I know ; that 's seven points on each side . Vavasor , come and cut . Upon my word if any one had asked me , I should have said you were dead . "
71778	71792	71632	71635	the sporting literary gentleman	2410	" But you see , nobody ever does think of asking you anything . "
71793	71799	71801	71801	Grindley	458	" What you probably mean , "
71803	71833	71801	71801	Grindley	458	" is that Vavasor was not returned for Chelsea last February ; but you 've seen him since that . Are you going to try it again , Vavasor ? "
71834	71845	71632	71635	the sporting literary gentleman	2410	" If you 'll lend me the money I will . "
71846	71863	71865	71866	Calder Jones	459	" I do n't see what on earth a man gains by going into the house , "
71868	71919	71865	71866	Calder Jones	459	" I could n't help myself as it happened , but , upon my word it 's a deuce of a bore . A fellow thinks he can do as he likes about going,—but he ca n't . It would n't do for me to give it up , because — "
71920	71934	71936	71936	Vavasor	357	" Oh no , of course not ; where should we all be ? "
71938	71947	71949	71949	Maxwell	457	" It 's you and me , Grindems , "
71951	71967	71949	71949	Maxwell	457	" D – – – – parliament , and now let 's have a rubber . "
72037	72046	72048	72048	Grindley	458	" I wonder he likes coming in here , "
72081	72088	72090	72091	Calder Jones	459	" I ca n't understand it , "
72102	72123	72090	72091	Calder Jones	459	" Last year he seemed to walk in just when he liked , as though he were one of us . "
72124	72133	72135	72135	Grindley	458	" He 's a bad sort of fellow , "
72137	72183	72135	72135	Grindley	458	" he 's so uncommonly dark . I do n't know where on earth he gets his money from , He was heir to some small property in the north , but he lost every shilling of that when he was in the wine trade . "
72184	72192	72194	72194	Maxwell,—making	462	" You 're wrong there , Grindems , "
72208	72234	72201	72201	he	462	" He made a pot of money at the wine business , and had he stuck to it he would have been a rich man . "
72235	72254	72135	72135	Grindley	458	" He 's lost it all since then , and that place in the north into the bargain . "
72255	72298	72135	72135	Grindley	458	" Wrong again , Grindems , my boy . If old Vavasor were to die to - morrow , Vavasor Hall would go just as he might choose to leave it . George may be a ruined man for aught I know — "
72299	72310	72312	72312	Grindley	458	" There 's no doubt about that , I believe , "
72314	72354	72312	72312	Grindley	458	" Perhaps not , Grindems ; but he ca n't have lost Vavasor Hall because he has never as yet had an interest in it . He 's the natural heir , and will probably get it some day . "
72355	72360	72362	72363	Calder Jones	459	" All the same , "
72365	72377	72362	72363	Calder Jones	459	" is n't it rather odd he should come in here ? "
72378	72386	72388	72388	Maxwell	457	" We 've asked him often enough , "
72390	72456	72388	72388	Maxwell	457	" not because we like him , but because we want him so often to make up a rubber . I do n't like George Vavasor , and I do n't know who does ; but I like him better than dummy . And I 'd sooner play whist with men I do n't like , Grindems , than I 'd not play at all . "
72492	72500	72502	72502	he	458	" That 's true , of course , "
72504	72531	72502	72502	he	458	" We ca n't pick men just as we please . But I certainly did n't think that he 'd make it out for another season . "
72582	72595	72597	72597	Maxwell	457	" Does anybody know anything about that brown horse of Vavasor 's ? "
72599	72615	72597	72597	Maxwell	457	" I saw him coming into the yard yesterday with that old groom of his . "
72616	72625	72807	72807	Grindley	458	" He had a brown horse last season , "
72627	72644	72597	72597	Maxwell	457	Grindley;—"a little thing that went very fast , but was n't quite sound on the road . "
72645	72651	72653	72653	Maxwell	457	" That was a mare , "
72655	72663	72597	72597	Maxwell	457	" and he sold her to Cinquebars . "
72665	72672	72674	72675	Calder Jones	459	" For a hundred and fifty , "
72677	72687	72674	72675	Calder Jones	459	" and she was n't worth the odd fifty . "
72688	72697	72699	72699	Maxwell	457	" He won seventy with her at Leamington , "
72701	72713	72699	72699	Maxwell	457	" and I doubt whether he 'd take his money now . "
72714	72723	72674	72675	Calder Jones	459	" Is Cinquebars coming down here this year ? "
72724	72730	72732	72732	Maxwell	457	" I do n't know , "
72734	72789	72732	72732	Maxwell	457	" I hope not . He 's the best fellow in the world , but he ca n't ride , and he do n't care for hunting , and he makes more row than any fellow I ever met . I wish some fellow could tell me something about that fellow 's brown horse . "
72790	72805	72807	72807	Grindley	458	" I 'd never buy a horse of Vavasor 's if I were you , "
72809	72821	72807	72807	Grindley	458	" He never has anything that 's all right all round . "
72822	72827	72829	72829	Maxwell	457	" And who has ? "
72856	73031	72832	72832	he	457	" That 's the mistake men make about horses , and that 's why there 's so much cheating . I never ask for a warranty with a horse , and do n't very often have a horse examined . Yet I do as well as others . You ca n't have perfect horses any more than you can perfect men , or perfect women . You put up with red hair , or bad teeth , or big feet,—or sometimes with the devil of a voice . But a man when he wants a horse wo n't put up with anything ! Therefore those who 've got horses to sell must lie . When I go into the market with three hundred pounds I expect a perfect animal . As I never do that now I never expect a perfect animal . I like 'em to see ; I like 'em to have four legs ; and I like 'em to have a little wind . I do n't much mind anything else . "
73032	73040	73042	73043	Calder Jones	459	" By Jove you 're about right , "
73130	73140	73141	73142	the master	2427	" Have you managed to come along pretty clean ? "
73152	73163	73165	73165	Bat	433	" They be the most beastly roads in all England , "
73182	73210	73165	73165	Bat	433	" But I 'll warrant I 'm cleaner than most on 'em . What for any county should make such roads as them I never could tell . "
73211	73248	73262	73262	he	433	" The roads about there are bad , certainly;—very bad . But I suppose they would have been better had Providence sent better materials . And what do you think of the brown horse , Bat ? "
73249	73254	73255	73255	He	433	" Well , sir . "
73268	73286	73288	73288	George	357	" He 's as fine an animal to look at as ever I put my eye on , "
73290	73296	73298	73298	Bat	433	" He 's all that , "
73300	73309	73298	73298	Bat	433	" He 's got lots of pace too . "
73310	73319	73262	73262	he	433	" I 'm sure he has , sir . "
73320	73333	73255	73255	He	433	" And they tell me you ca n't beat him at jumping . "
73334	73349	73298	73298	Bat	433	" They can mostly do that , sir , if they 're well handled . "
73350	73361	73262	73262	he	433	" You see he 's a deal over my weight . "
73362	73377	73255	73255	He	433	" Yes , he is , Mr. Vavasor . He is a fourteen stoner . "
73378	73382	73384	73384	Vavasor	357	" Or fifteen , "
73386	73408	73384	73384	Vavasor	357	" Perhaps he may , sir . There 's no knowing what a ' orse can carry till he 's tried . "
73652	73663	73665	73665	George	357	" We shall have a run from the big wood , "
73667	73679	73681	73681	Bat	433	" If they make un break , you will , sir , "
73683	73694	73696	73696	George	357	" At any rate I 'll ride the brown horse , "
73835	73843	73844	73844	Maxwell	457	" Are you well mounted this year ? "
73850	73888	73844	73844	Maxwell	457	" No , indeed ; I never was what I call well mounted yet . I generally have one horse and three or four cripples . That brown horse behind there is pretty good , I believe . "
73889	73903	73844	73844	Maxwell	457	" I see your man has got the old chestnut mare with him . "
73904	73944	73844	73844	Maxwell	457	" She 's one of the cripples,—not but what she 's as sound as a bell , and as good a hunter as ever I wish to ride ; but she makes a little noise when she 's going . "
73945	73956	73958	73958	Grindley	458	" So that you can hear her three fields off , "
73960	73975	73977	73977	Vavasor	357	" Five if the fields are small enough and your ears are sharp enough , "
73979	73998	73977	73977	Vavasor	357	" All the same I would n't change her for the best horse I ever saw under you . "
73999	74006	74008	74008	Maxwell	457	" Had you there , Grindems , "
74010	74017	74019	74019	Grindley	458	" No , he did n't , "
74021	74030	74019	74019	Grindley	458	" He did n't have me at all . "
74031	74049	74051	74051	George	357	" Your horses , Grindley , are always up to all the work they have to do , "
74053	74067	74051	74051	George	357	" and I do n't know what any man wants more than that . "
74068	74075	74077	74077	Maxwell	457	" Had you again , Grindems , "
74079	74088	74090	74090	Grindley	458	" I can ride against him any day , "
74092	74111	74113	74113	George	357	" Yes ; or against a brick wall either , if your horse did n't know any better , "
74115	74122	74124	74124	Maxwell	457	" Had you again , Grindems , "
74802	74810	74812	74812	Maxwell	457	" By George , there 's Pollock ! "
74824	74867	74812	74812	Maxwell	457	" I 'll bet half a crown that he 's come down from London this morning , that he was up all night last night , and that he tells us so three times before the hounds go out of the paddock . "
75879	75890	75892	75892	Maxwell	457	" I hope I see you well , Sir William , "
75911	75939	75909	75909	Vavasor	357	" Humph — well , yes , I 'm pretty well , thank'ee . Just move on , will you ? My mare ca n't stir here . "
76020	76026	76009	76009	he	2427	" Yes , Sir William , "
76027	76033	76009	76009	he	2427	" No , Sir William , "
76034	76041	76042	76050	One long - eared , long - legged fellow	2578	" No doubt , Sir William . "
76076	76091	76093	76094	Sir William	470	" Who the devil 's that fellow , that 's all breeches and boots ? "
76129	76139	76141	76142	Calder Jones	459	" Where shall we find first , Sir William ? "
76153	76166	76168	76169	Sir William	470	" How the mischief am I to know where the foxes are ? "
76460	76470	76472	76472	Maxwell	457	" Well , Pollock , when did you come ? "
76474	76478	76480	76482	the literary gentleman	2603	" By George , "
76484	76533	76480	76482	the literary gentleman	2603	" just down from London by the 8.30 from Euston Square , and got over here from Winslow in a trap , with two fellows I never saw in my life before . We came tandem in a fly , and did the nineteen miles in an hour . "
76534	76543	76545	76545	Maxwell	457	" Come , Athenian , draw it mild , "
76547	76589	76545	76545	Maxwell	457	" We did , indeed . I wonder whether they 'll pay me their share of the fly . I had to leave Onslow Crescent at a quarter before eight , and I did three hours ' work before I started . "
76590	76600	76602	76602	Grindley	458	" Then you did it by candle - light , "
76604	76661	76602	76602	Grindley	458	" Of course I did ; and why should n't I ? Do you suppose no one can work by candle - light except a lawyer ? I suppose you fellows were playing whist , and drinking hard . I 'm uncommon glad I was n't with you , for I shall be able to ride . "
76662	76669	76671	76671	Jones	459	" I bet you a pound , "
76673	76688	76671	76671	Jones	459	" if there 's a run , I see more of it than you . "
76689	76698	76700	76700	Grindley	458	" I 'll take that bet with Jones , "
76702	76710	76700	76700	Grindley	458	" and Vavasor shall be the judge . "
76711	76729	76731	76732	Sir William	470	" Gentlemen , the hounds ca n't get out , if you will stop up the gate , "
76781	76792	76793	76793	he	357	" I 'll ride the chestnut mare in the wood , "
76796	76804	76793	76793	he	357	" and do you keep near me . "
76805	76820	76822	76822	Bat	433	" I bean't to be galloping up and down them rides , I suppose , "
76827	76864	76822	76822	Bat	433	" I sha n't gallop up and down the rides , myself ; but do you mark me , to know where I am , so that I can change if a fox should go away . "
76865	76880	76793	76793	he	357	" You 'll be here all day , sir . That 's my belief . "
76881	76915	76793	76793	he	357	" If so , I wo n't ride the brown horse at all . But do you take care to let me have him if there 's a chance . Do you understand ? "
76916	76971	76822	76822	Bat	433	" Oh , yes , I understand , sir . There ai n't no difficulty in my understanding;—only I do n't think , sir , you 'll ever get a fox out of that wood to - day . Why , it stands to reason . The wind 's from the north - east . "
77214	77231	77233	77233	Pollock	468	" You 'll make that man cut his throat , if you go on at that , "
77235	77239	77241	77241	Maxwell	457	" Shall I ? "
77243	77259	77241	77241	Maxwell	457	" Then I 'll certainly stick to him for the sake of humanity in general . "
77286	77297	77299	77299	Grindley	458	" We sha n't do any good to - day , "
77306	77315	77317	77317	Vavasor	357	" I 'm sure I do n't know , "
77319	77339	77341	77341	Grindley	458	" That old fellow has got to be so stupid , he does n't know what he 's about , "
77347	77356	77358	77358	Vavasor	357	" How can he make the fox break ? "
77491	77501	77503	77503	Maxwell	457	" It 's the cussidest place in all creation , "
77505	77524	77503	77503	Maxwell	457	" I often said I 'd not come here any more , and now I say it again . "
77525	77536	77538	77538	Grindley	458	" And yet you 'll be here the next meet , "
77553	77563	77565	77565	Maxwell	457	" Grindems , you know a sight too much , "
77567	77581	77565	77565	Maxwell	457	" you do indeed . An ordinary fellow has no chance with you . "
77622	77632	77634	77634	Maxwell	457	" He is n't away , Tom , surely ? "
77636	77645	77647	77647	Tom;—and	473	" He 's out of the wood somewheres , "
77779	77783	77785	77786	Sir William	470	" Hold hard , "
77788	77799	77785	77786	Sir William	470	" The hounds are not out of the wood yet . "
77800	77808	77844	77844	his	357	" Is the fox away , sir ? "
77809	77837	77840	77840	he	357	" What 's the good of that if we ca n't get the hounds out?—Yes , he 's away . He passed out where I 'm standing . "
77933	77941	77943	77944	the master	2427	" He 's gone for Claydon 's , "
77946	77953	77943	77944	the master	2427	" Try them up that hedgerow . "
79096	79100	79102	79102	he	357	" By George ! "
79104	79126	79102	79102	he	357	" that 's too big for me yet awhile ; and there 's no end of a river at the bottom . "
79279	79287	79288	79288	Pearlings	477	" Where the devil is my fellow ? "
79302	79305	79307	79307	his	477	" his fellow "
79351	79363	79365	79365	George	357	" I wonder what it is that 's amiss with him , "
79414	79420	79422	79422	Burgo	427	" Where are we now ? "
79439	79446	79448	79448	Tom	472	" This is Bulby 's farm , "
79450	79461	79448	79448	Tom	472	" and we 're going right away for Elmham Wood . "
79462	79472	79474	79486	a stout farmer , who had come as far as that with them	2723	" Elmham Wood be d – – – – , "
79488	79499	79474	79486	a stout farmer , who had come as far as that with them	2723	" You wo n't see Elmham Wood to - day . "
79500	79507	79509	79509	Tom	472	" I suppose you know best , "
79536	79547	79549	79549	Tom	472	" He 's been through them firs , any way , "
79551	79557	79549	79549	Tom	472	" To him , Gaylass ! "
79585	79598	79600	79600	Pollock	468	" I say,—that took some of the wind out of a fellow , "
79602	79611	79613	79613	Burgo	427	" You must n't mind about wind now , "
79618	79631	79633	79634	Calder Jones	459	" Was n't the pace awful , coming up to that farmhouse ? "
79843	79851	79853	79853	Tom	472	" Darned if the Squire warn't right , "
79871	79881	79883	79883	Burgo	427	" We ai n't going for Claydon 's now ? "
79885	79896	79898	79898	Tom	472	" Them 's Claydon 's beeches we sees over there , "
79900	79909	79898	79898	Tom	472	" ' Tain't often the Squire 's wrong . "
80097	80107	80109	80109	Burgo	427	" I did n't see you at the start , "
80111	80119	80121	80123	the country gentleman	2747	" And I did n't see you , "
80125	80131	80121	80123	the country gentleman	2747	" so it 's even . "
80371	80378	80380	80380	Burgo	427	" A jolly thing so far , "
80384	80394	80380	80380	Burgo	427	" about the best we 've had this year . "
80395	80405	80407	80407	Maxwell	457	" I did n't see a yard of it , "
80409	80431	80407	80407	Maxwell	457	" I had n't nerve to get off the first road , and I have n't been off it ever since . "
80452	80459	80461	80461	he	457	" Who 's been with you ? "
80463	80546	80461	80461	he	457	" There 've been Tom and I;—and Calder Jones was there for a while . I think he killed himself somewhere . And there was Pollock , and your friend Grindley , and a chap whose name I do n't know who dropped out of heaven about half - way in the run ; and there was another man whose back I saw just now ; there he is,—by heavens , it 's Vavasor ! I did n't know he was here . "
80782	80799	80801	80801	Tom	472	" Same fox ! in course it was ; why should n't it be the same ? "
81516	81523	81525	81525	Burgo	427	" I 'm about done for , "
81529	81534	81536	81536	Maxwell	457	" Luckily for you , "
81538	81548	81536	81536	Maxwell	457	" the fox is much in the same way . "
81606	81614	81615	81617	The unfortunate man	2791	" Yoicks , tally ; gone away ! "
81619	81632	81634	81635	Sir William	470	" What the d – – – – are you roaring at ? "
81637	81650	81634	81635	Sir William	470	" Do you suppose I do n't know where the fox is ? "
82066	82071	82073	82073	Vavasor	357	" Are you hurt ? "
82075	82081	82073	82073	Vavasor	357	" can I do anything ? "
82088	82101	82103	82103	Burgo	427	" If you can find a chap just send him to me , "
82311	82322	82298	82298	Maxwell	457	" What do you want for that horse , Vavasor ? "
82323	82329	82331	82331	Vavasor	357	" A hundred and fifty , "
82333	82338	82340	82340	Maxwell	457	" He 's mine , "
82936	82945	82946	82946	he	427	" I shall never marry now,—that is all , "
83361	83365	83366	83366	she	488	" Was Alice , "
83369	83391	83366	83366	she	488	" afraid of the marquises and the countesses , or of all the rank and all the money which they boasted ? "
83404	83430	83395	83395	she	350	" Then would she permit Lady Glencora and Burgo to see each other in the drawing - room at Queen Anne Street , just once ! "
83492	83500	83506	83506	her	488	" Why should I not marry him ? "
83510	83516	83506	83506	her	488	" He is my equal . "
83572	83584	83592	83592	she	488	" If you will not help me , I am helpless ! "
83609	83616	83618	83619	Lady Glencora	488	" How shall I bribe you ? "
83621	83635	83618	83619	Lady Glencora	488	" Next to him I will love you better than all the world . "
83828	83906	83907	83907	She	488	" She had been counselled that it was not fitting for her to love as she had thought to love , and she had resolved to give up her dream . Her cousin Alice , she knew , would respect her secret . She was going to become the wife of the best man , she thought , in all the world ; and it should be the one care of her life to make him happy . "
83923	83948	83907	83907	She	488	" She was to be married at once . Would Alice be one among the bevy of bridesmaids who were to grace the ceremony ? "
83953	83955	83956	83956	she	350	heartily,—"heartily , "
84771	84775	84764	84764	she	350	" Glencora Palliser , "
84939	84952	84954	84954	Alice	337	" ' Since that!'—what does she mean by ' since that ' ? "
84958	84985	84956	84956	herself	337	" She has never set eyes on me at all . Why does she talk of not having seen as much of me as is desirable ? "
86309	86312	86313	86313	she	350	" Aunt , "
86316	86331	86313	86313	she	350	" I have had a letter this morning from your friend , Lady Midlothian . "
86332	86347	86293	86293	she	342	" She is my cousin , Alice ; and yours as much as mine . "
86348	86387	86293	86293	she	342	" Your cousin then , aunt . But it is of more moment that she is your friend . She certainly is not mine , nor can her cousinship afford any justification for her interfering in my affairs . "
86388	86393	86313	86313	she	350	" Alice,—from her position — "
86394	86443	86293	86293	she	342	" Her position can be nothing to me , aunt . I will not submit to it . There is her letter , which you can read if you please . After that you may burn it . I need hardly say that I shall not answer it . "
86444	86456	86293	86293	she	342	" And what am I to say to her , Alice ? "
86457	86472	86313	86313	she	350	" Nothing from me , aunt;—from yourself , whatever you please , of course . "
86484	86510	86293	86293	she	342	" And I have had another letter , from Lady Glencora , who married Mr. Palliser , and whom I knew in London last spring . "
86511	86520	86293	86293	she	342	" And has that offended you , too ? "
86521	86554	86313	86313	she	350	" No , there is no offence in that . She asks me to go and see her at Matching Priory , her husband 's house ; but I shall not go . "
86705	86716	86717	86718	Lady Glencora	488	" except so far as I myself may do so , "
86972	86977	86978	86978	she	912	" I have money , "
86994	87052	86978	86978	she	912	" I have money , but I have nothing else in the world . I have no home . Why should I not remain here in Norfolk , where I know a few people ? If you 'll say that you 'll go anywhere else with me , I 'll go to any place you 'll name . "
87169	87173	87174	87174	she	387	" Only think , "
87208	87224	87200	87200	she	387	" only think , that it is barely nine months since he was with me ? "
87225	87233	87235	87235	Kate	356	" Six , you mean , aunt , "
87239	87243	87245	87246	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Only nine months "
87257	87262	87245	87246	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Only nine months ! "
87274	87282	87283	87283	Jeannette	387	" It happened in May , Miss , "
87290	87307	87283	87283	Jeannette	387	" and that , as we reckons , it will be just a twelvemonth come Christmas . "
87470	87480	87461	87461	she	356	" That 's all very well , my dear , "
87486	87508	87481	87482	Aunt Greenow	380	" A girl must settle herself some day , you know;—and you 'd have it all your own way at Oileymead . "
87590	87600	87602	87602	Jeannette	387	" I am all for Mr. Cheesacre , Miss , "
87605	87651	87602	87602	Jeannette	387	" The Captain is perhaps the nicerer - looking gentleman , and he ai n't so podgy like ; but what 's good looks if a gentleman has n't got nothing ? I ca n't abide anything that 's poor ; neither ca n't Missus . "
87853	87866	87868	87869	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" You wo n't see much of the Captain , I suppose , "
87948	87956	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" Not much , I dare say , "
87961	87981	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" He tells me that he must be on duty ten or twelve hours a day . Poor fellow ! "
87982	88035	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" It 's a deuced good thing for him , and he ought to be very much obliged to me for putting him in the way of getting it . But he told me to tell you that if he did n't call , you were not to be angry with him . "
88036	88046	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" Oh , no;—I shall remember , of course . "
88047	88076	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" You see , if he do n't work now he must come to grief . He has n't got a shilling that he can call his own . "
88077	88083	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" Has n't he really ? "
88084	88117	87958	87959	the widow	1443	" Not a shilling , Mrs. Greenow;—and then he 's awfully in debt . He is n't a bad fellow , you know , only there 's no trusting him for anything . "
88168	88180	88159	88159	he	395	" He has n't been here , has he , Jenny ? "
88181	88201	88203	88204	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" We have n't seen a sight of him yet , sir,—and I have thought it a little odd . "
88517	88526	88528	88529	Mrs. Greenow	405	" What am I to do about it ? "
88556	88569	88528	88529	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It 's as much as Jeannette has been able to carry . "
88570	88589	88528	88529	Mrs. Greenow	405	" So it is , ma'am,—quite ; and I 'm strong in the arm , too , ma'am . "
88590	88606	88528	88529	Mrs. Greenow	405	" What am I to do , Kate ? He is such a good creature . "
88607	88617	88619	88619	Jeannette	387	" And he do admire you both so much , "
88621	88635	88637	88638	the aunt	1560	" Of course I do n't want to offend him for many reasons , "
88646	88680	88637	88638	the aunt	1560	" I do n't know anything about your reasons , aunt , but if I were you , I should leave the basket just as it is till he comes in the afternoon . "
88681	88734	88528	88529	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Would you mind seeing him yourself , Kate , and explaining to him that it wo n't do to get on in this way . Perhaps you would n't mind telling him that if he 'll promise not to bring any more , you wo n't object to take this one . "
88735	88753	88637	88638	the aunt	1560	" Indeed , aunt , I ca n't do that . They 're not brought to me . "
88754	88759	88637	88638	the aunt	1560	" Oh , Kate ! "
88760	88774	88528	88529	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Nonsense , aunt;—I wo n't have you say so;—before Jeannette , too . "
88775	88806	88637	88638	the aunt	1560	" I think it 's for both , ma'am ; I do indeed . And there certainly ai n't any cream to be bought like it in Norwich:—nor yet eggs . "
88807	88817	88819	88820	the widow	1443	" I wonder what there is in the basket . "
88829	88841	88819	88820	the widow	1443	" I declare if there is n't a turkey poult already . "
88842	88845	88847	88847	Jeannette	387	" My ! "
88849	88872	88847	88847	Jeannette	387	" A turkey poult ! Why , that 's worth ten and sixpence in the market if it 's worth a penny . "
88873	88894	88896	88896	Kate	356	" It 's out of the question that I should take upon myself to say anything to him about it , "
88898	88916	88918	88919	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Upon my word I do n't see why you should n't , as well as I , "
88921	88930	88932	88932	Jeannette	387	" I 'll tell you what , ma'am , "
88934	88948	88932	88932	Jeannette	387	" let me just ask him who they 're for;—he'll tell me anything . "
88949	88960	88962	88962	Kate	356	" Do n't do anything of the kind , Jeannette , "
88964	89002	88962	88962	Kate	356	" Of course , aunt , they 're brought for you . There 's no doubt about that . A gentleman does n't bring cream and turkeys to — I 've never heard of such a thing ! "
89003	89036	88932	88932	Jeannette	387	" I do n't see why a gentleman should n't bring cream and turkeys to you just as well as to me . Indeed , he told me once as much himself . "
89037	89064	89066	89066	Kate	356	" Then , if they 're for me , I 'll leave them down outside the front door , and he may find his provisions there . "
89076	89083	89085	89086	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Leave it alone , Kate , "
89109	89121	89085	89086	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Leave it alone . I 'll see Mr. Cheesacre myself . "
89122	89157	88932	88932	Jeannette	387	" And I do hope you wo n't mention my name . It 's the most absurd thing in the world . The man never spoke two dozen words to me in his life . "
89158	89166	89168	89169	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He speaks to me , though , "
89171	89178	89180	89180	Kate	356	" I dare say he does , "
89182	89192	89180	89180	Kate	356	" And about you , too , my dear . "
89193	89211	88932	88932	Jeannette	387	" He does n't come here with those big flowers in his button - hole for nothing , "
89213	89222	89180	89180	Kate	356	Jeannette,—"not if I knows what a gentleman means . "
89223	89230	89232	89233	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Of course he does n't , "
89235	89244	89246	89246	Kate	356	" If you do n't object , aunt , "
89248	89265	89246	89246	Kate	356	" I will write to grandpapa and tell him that I will return home at once . "
89266	89272	89274	89275	Mrs. Greenow	405	" What!—because of Mr. Cheesacre ? "
89277	89293	89274	89275	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I do n't think you 'll be so silly as that , my dear . "
89576	89582	89583	89583	he	395	" I just called in , "
89586	89593	89583	89583	he	395	" to see how you were . "
89594	89602	89604	89605	Mrs. Greenow	405	" We are not likely to starve , "
89614	89629	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" Just a few trifles that my old woman asked me to bring in , "
89633	89641	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" She insisted on putting them up . "
89642	89653	89655	89656	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But your old woman is by far too magnificent , "
89658	89670	89655	89656	Mrs. Greenow	405	" She really frightens Kate and me out of our wits . "
89690	89695	89697	89697	he	395	" Dear Mrs. Greenow , "
89699	89734	89697	89697	he	395	" there is no cause for you to be alarmed , I can assure you . Mere trifles;—light as air , you know . I do n't think anything of such things as these . "
89735	89776	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" But I and Kate think a great deal of them,—a very great deal , I can assure you . Do you know , we had a long debate this morning whether or no we would return them to Oileymead ? "
89777	89784	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" Return them , Mrs. Greenow ! "
89785	89818	89697	89697	he	395	" Yes , indeed : what are women , situated as we are , to do under such circumstances ? When gentlemen will be too liberal , their liberality must be repressed . "
89819	89855	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" And have I been too liberal , Mrs. Greenow ? What is a young turkey and a stick of celery when a man is willing to give everything that he has in the world ? "
89856	89889	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" You 've got a great deal more in the world , Mr. Cheesacre , than you 'd like to part with . But we wo n't talk of that , now . "
89890	89898	89697	89697	he	395	" When shall we talk of it ? "
89899	89918	89631	89631	Cheesacre	395	" If you really have anything to say , you had by far better speak to Kate herself . "
89919	89933	89940	89940	he	3071	" Mrs. Greenow , you mistake me . Indeed , you mistake me . "
89993	90003	90004	90004	she	387	" You may take these things down , Jeannette , "
90007	90018	90004	90004	she	387	" Mr. Cheesacre has promised that no more shall come . "
90019	90026	90028	90029	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" But I have n't promised , "
90031	90056	90028	90029	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" You will oblige me and Kate , I know;—and , Jeannette , tell Miss Vavasor that I am ready to walk with her . "
90305	90316	90318	90319	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He is the most generous man I ever met , "
90321	90326	90328	90329	Captain Bellfield	393	" So he is , "
90331	90356	90328	90329	Captain Bellfield	393	" and we 'll drink his health . Poor old Cheesy ! It 's a great pity he should n't get himself a wife . "
90357	90373	90375	90376	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I do n't know any man more calculated to make a young woman happy , "
90378	90383	90375	90376	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No , indeed , "
90388	90403	90385	90386	Miss Fairstairs	405	" I 'm told that his house and all about it is quite beautiful . "
90404	90416	90418	90419	the Captain	1602	" Especially the straw - yard and the horse - pond , "
90514	90517	90519	90520	Mrs. Greenow	405	and,—"Poor man , "
90527	90559	90519	90520	Mrs. Greenow	405	" if I had n't let him stay there , he would have had no resting - place for the sole of his foot , but some horrid barrack - room ! "
90601	90605	90606	90606	she	405	" looking back , "
90609	90632	90606	90606	she	405	" to things that were gone;—that were gone . But come , dears , I am not going to make you melancholy . "
90702	90713	90715	90716	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm afraid the wine is not very good , "
90718	90729	90715	90716	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But one ca n't get good wine in lodgings . "
90730	90748	90750	90751	the Captain	1602	" I 'm not thinking very much about it , Mrs. Greenow ; that 's the truth , "
90753	90765	90750	90751	the Captain	1602	" I daresay the wine is very good of its kind . "
90776	90793	90795	90796	the Captain	1602	" I suppose you find it rather dull , living in lodgings ; do n't you ? "
90798	90860	90795	90796	the Captain	1602	" I do n't know quite what you mean by dull , Captain Bellfield ; but a woman circumstanced as I am , ca n't find her life very gay . It 's not a full twelvemonth yet since I lost all that made life desirable , and sometimes I wonder at myself for holding up as well as I do . "
90861	90876	90938	90938	she	3104	" It 's wicked to give way to grief too much , Mrs. Greenow . "
90877	90901	90795	90796	the Captain	1602	" That 's what my dear Kate always says to me , and I 'm sure I do my best to overcome it . "
90956	90974	90938	90938	she	3104	" I did n't intend to treat you to such a scene as this , Captain Bellfield . "
90975	90997	90938	90938	she	3104	" There is nothing on earth , Mrs. Greenow , I desire so much , as permission to dry those tears . "
90998	91009	90938	90938	she	3104	" Time alone can do that , Captain Bellfield;—time alone . "
91010	91024	90938	90938	she	3104	" But can not time be aided by love and friendship and affection ? "
91025	91042	90938	90938	she	3104	" By friendship , yes . What would life be worth without the solace of friendship ? "
91043	91055	90938	90938	she	3104	" And how much better is the warm glow of love ? "
91122	91133	91134	91134	he	393	" How much better is the warm glow of love ? "
91167	91185	91154	91154	he	393	" The warm , glow of love , Captain Bellfield , if you have ever felt it — "
91186	91231	91134	91134	he	393	" If I have ever felt it ! Do I not feel it now , Mrs. Greenow ? There can be no longer any mask kept upon my feelings . I never could restrain the yearnings of my heart when they have been strong . "
91232	91242	91323	91324	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Have they often been strong , Captain Bellfield ? "
91243	91258	91154	91154	he	393	" Yes ; often;—in various scenes of life ; on the field of battle — "
91259	91271	91154	91154	he	393	" I did not know that you had seen active service . "
91272	91314	91323	91324	Mrs. Greenow	405	" What!—not on the plains of Zuzuland , when with fifty picked men I kept five hundred Caffres at bay for seven weeks;—never knew the comfort of a bed , or a pillow to my head , for seven long weeks ! "
91315	91321	91323	91324	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Not for seven weeks ? "
91326	91388	91323	91324	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No . Did I not see active service at Essiquebo , on the burning coast of Guiana , when all the wild Africans from the woods rose up to destroy the colony ; or again at the mouth of the Kitchyhomy River , when I made good the capture of a slaver by my own hand and my own sword ! "
91389	91396	91398	91399	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I really had n't heard , "
91401	91456	91458	91459	the Captain	1602	" Ah , I understand . I know . Cheesy is the best fellow in the world in some respects , but he can not bring himself to speak well of a fellow behind his back . I know who has belittled me . Who was the first to storm the heights of Inkerman ? "
91482	91500	91458	91459	the Captain	1602	" But when you spoke of yearnings , I thought you meant yearnings of a softer kind . "
91501	91596	91598	91598	he	3110	" So I did . So I did . I do n't know why I have been led away to speak of deeds that are very seldom mentioned , at any rate by myself . But I can not bear that a slanderous backbiting tongue should make you think that I have seen no service . I have served her Majesty in the four quarters of the globe , Mrs. Greenow ; and now I am ready to serve you in any way in which you will allow me to make my service acceptable . "
91616	91640	91598	91598	he	3110	" But , Captain Bellfield , I do n't want any services . Pray get up now ; the girl will come in . "
91641	91678	91680	91680	he	3110	" I care nothing for any girl . I am planted here till some answer shall have been made to me ; till some word shall have been said that may give me a little hope . "
91701	91704	91705	91705	he	3110	" Arabella , "
91708	91718	91705	91705	he	3110	" will you not speak a word to me ? "
91719	91776	91598	91598	he	3110	" Not a word , Captain Bellfield , till you get up ; and I wo n't have you call me Arabella . I am the widow of Samuel Greenow , than whom no man was more respected where he was known , and it is not fitting that I should be addressed in that way . "
91777	91788	91880	91881	the widow	1443	" But I want you to become my wife,—and then — "
91789	91875	91880	91881	the widow	1443	" Ah , then indeed ! But that then is n't likely to come . Get up , Captain Bellfield , or I 'll push you over and then ring the bell . A man never looks so much like a fool as when he 's kneeling down,—unless he 's saying his prayers , as you ought to be doing now . Get up , I tell you . It 's just half past seven , and I told Jeannette to come to me then . "
91898	91911	91912	91912	she	1443	" You 've pushed all the chairs about , you stupid man , "
92009	92021	92023	92023	Jeannette	387	" He 's a very handsome man , is the Captain , "
92036	92047	92049	92050	Mrs. Greenow	405	" You should n't think about handsome men , child , "
92052	92061	92063	92063	Jeannette	387	" And I 'm sure I do n't , "
92065	92092	92063	92063	Jeannette	387	" Not no more than anybody else ; but if a man is handsome , ma'am , why it stands to reason that he is handsome . "
92093	92109	92049	92050	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I suppose Captain Bellfield has given you a kiss and a pair of gloves . "
92110	92175	92063	92063	Jeannette	387	" As for gloves and such like , Mr. Cheesacre is much better for giving than the Captain ; as we all know ; do n't we , ma'am ? But in regard to kisses , they 're presents as I never takes from anybody . Let everybody pay his debts . If the Captain ever gets a wife , let him kiss her . "
92245	92252	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" That means you , Kate , "
92257	92281	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No , it does n't ; it does n't mean me at all . At any rate he wo n't see me . "
92282	92326	92220	92220	he	395	" I dare say it 's me he wishes to see . It seems to be the fashionable plan now for gentlemen to make offers by deputy . If he says anything , I can only refer him to you , you know . "
92327	92355	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Yes , you can ; you can tell him simply that I wo n't have him . But he is no more thinking of me than — "
92356	92369	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Than he is of me , you were going to say . "
92370	92385	92220	92220	he	395	" No , aunt ; I was n't going to say that at all . "
92386	92415	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Well , we shall see . If he does mean anything , of course you can please yourself ; but I really think you might do worse . "
92416	92428	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But if I do n't want to do at all ? "
92429	92449	92254	92255	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Very well ; you must have your own way . I can only tell you what I think . "
92573	92579	92580	92580	she	1443	" Thanks for the flowers , "
92585	92600	92580	92580	she	1443	" It was so good of you to bring something that we could accept . "
92601	92606	92608	92608	he	395	" As for that , "
92610	92640	92608	92608	he	395	" I do n't see why you should scruple about a trifle of cream , but I hope that any such feeling as that will be over before long . "
92809	92816	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" How goes everything at Oileymead ? "
92835	92866	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Pretty well , Mrs. Greenow ; pretty well . Everything will go very well if I am successful in the object which I have on hand to - day . "
92867	92882	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm sure I hope you 'll be successful in all your undertakings . "
92883	92960	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" In all my business undertakings I am , Mrs. Greenow . There is n't a shilling due on my land to e'er a bank in Norwich ; and I have n't thrashed out a quarter of last year 's corn yet , which is more than many of them can say . But there ai n't many of them who do n't have to pay rent , and so perhaps I ought n't to boast . "
92961	92981	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I know that Providence has been very good to you , Mr. Cheesacre , as regards worldly matters . "
92982	93055	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And I have n't left it all to Providence , either . Those who do , generally go to the wall , as far as I can see . I 'm always at work late and early , and I know when I get a profit out of a man 's labour and when I do n't , as well as though it was my only chance of bread and cheese . "
93056	93068	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I always thought you understood farming business , Mr. Cheesacre . "
93069	93153	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Yes , I do . I like a bit of fun well enough , when the time for it comes , as you saw at Yarmouth . And I keep my three or four hunters , as I think a country gentleman should ; and I shoot over my own ground . But I always stick to my work . There are men , like Bellfield , who wo n't work . What do they come to ? They 're always borrowing . "
93154	93167	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But he has fought his country 's battles , Mr. Cheesacre . "
93168	93203	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He fight ! I suppose he 's been telling you some of his old stories . He was ten years in the West Indies , and all his fighting was with the mosquitoes . "
93204	93218	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But he was in the Crimea . At Inkerman , for instance — "
93219	93258	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He in the Crimea ! Well , never mind . But do you inquire before you believe that story . But as I was saying , Mrs. Greenow , you have seen my little place at Oileymead . "
93259	93273	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" A charming house . All you want is a mistress for it . "
93274	93320	93322	93322	he	3128	" That 's it ; that 's just it . All I want is a mistress for it . And there 's only one woman on earth that I would wish to see in that position . Arabella Greenow , will you be that woman ? "
93342	93348	93349	93349	she	3129	" I , Mr. Cheesacre ! "
93352	93397	93349	93349	she	3129	" Yes , you . Who else ? Since I saw you what other woman has been anything to me ; or , indeed , I may say before ? Since the first day I saw you I felt that there my happiness depended . "
93398	93411	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Oh , Mr. Cheesacre , I thought you were looking elsewhere . "
93412	93442	93322	93322	he	3128	" No , no , no . There never was such a mistake as that . I have the highest regard and esteem for Miss Vavasor , but really — "
93443	93455	93349	93349	she	3129	" Mr. Cheesacre , what am I to say to you ? "
93456	93557	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" What are you to say to me ? Say that you 'll be mine . Say that I shall be yours . Say that all I have at Oileymead shall be yours . Say that the open carriage for a pair of ponies to be driven by a lady which I have been looking at this morning shall be yours . Yes , indeed ; the sweetest thing you ever saw in your life,—just like one that the lady of the Lord Lieutenant drives about in always . That 's what you must say . Come , Mrs. Greenow ! "
93558	93584	93322	93322	he	3128	" Ah , Mr. Cheesacre , you do n't know what it is to have buried the pride of your youth hardly yet twelve months . "
93585	93641	93349	93349	she	3129	" But you have buried him , and there let there be an end of it . Your sitting here all alone , morning , noon , and night , wo n't bring him back . I 'm sorry for him ; I am indeed . Poor Greenow ! But what more can I do ? "
93642	93662	92818	92819	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I can do more , Mr. Cheesacre . I can mourn for him in solitude and in silence . "
93663	93690	93322	93322	he	3128	" No , no , no . What 's the use of it,—breaking your heart for nothing,—and my heart too . You never think of that . "
93704	93713	93692	93693	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" It can not be , Mr. Cheesacre . "
93714	93741	93743	93743	he	395	" Ah , but it can be . Come , Mrs. Greenow . We understand each other well enough now , surely . Come , dearest . "
93799	93807	93809	93810	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Show Captain Bellfield up , certainly , "
93812	93821	93823	93824	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" D – – – – Captain Bellfield ! "
94361	94376	94378	94379	Lady Macleod	342	" I think you owe it as a duty to your family to go , "
94440	94451	94452	94454	the poor lady	3150	" I am becoming a very old woman , Alice , "
94459	94485	94452	94454	the poor lady	3150	" and I suppose I had better not interfere any further . Whatever I have said I have always meant to be for your good . "
94547	94556	94558	94559	Lady Macleod	342	" And because they are cousins as well , "
94673	94684	94685	94685	he	805	" I 'm very glad you are going , Alice , "
94695	94700	94685	94685	he	805	" Why , papa ? "
94701	94761	94685	94685	he	805	" Why?—because I think it 's the proper thing to do . You know I 've never said much to you about these people . They 're not connected with me , and I know that they hate the name of Vavasor;—not but what the name is a deal older than any of theirs , and the family too . "
94762	94801	94685	94685	he	805	" And therefore I do n't understand why you think I 'm specially right . If you were to say I was specially wrong , I should be less surprised , and of course I should n't go . "
94802	94835	94685	94685	he	805	" You should go by all means . Rank and wealth are advantages , let anybody say what they will to the contrary . Why else does everybody want to get them ? "
94836	94849	94685	94685	he	805	" But I sha n't get them by going to Matching Priory . "
94850	95013	95014	95014	Alice	350	" You 'll get part of their value . Take them as a whole , the nobility of England are pleasant acquaintances to have . I have n't run after them very much myself , though I married , as I may say , among them . That very thing rather stood in my way than otherwise . But you may be sure of this , that men and women ought to grow , like plants , upwards . Everybody should endeavour to stand as well as he can in the world , and if I had a choice of acquaintance between a sugar - baker and a peer , I should prefer the peer,—unless , indeed , the sugar - baker had something very strong on his side to offer . I do n't call that tuft - hunting , and it does not necessitate toadying . It 's simply growing up , towards the light , as the trees do . "
95068	95084	95085	95085	she	350	" Well , papa , I hope I shall find myself growing towards the light , "
95127	95171	95125	95125	George	357	" I hear you are going down to the Pallisers at Matching Priory to - morrow , and as I shall be glad to say one word to you before you go , will you let me see you this evening,—say at nine?—G. V. "
95295	95307	95312	95312	he	805	" I 'm so glad you 're going to Matching Priory , "
95345	95355	95356	95356	she	350	" How did you learn that I was going ? "
95359	95378	95356	95356	she	350	" I heard it from a friend of mine . Well;—from Burgo Fitzgerald , if you must know . "
95379	95384	95386	95386	Alice	350	" From Mr. Fitzgerald ? "
95392	95402	95386	95386	Alice	350	" How could Mr. Fitzgerald have heard of it ? "
95403	95423	95356	95356	she	350	" That 's more than I know , Alice . Not directly from Lady Glencora , I should say . "
95424	95430	95356	95356	she	350	" That would be impossible . "
95431	95463	95356	95356	she	350	" Yes ; quite so , no doubt . I think she keeps up her intimacy with Burgo 's sister , and perhaps it got round to him in that way . "
95464	95489	95356	95356	she	350	" And did he tell you also that I was going to - morrow ? He must have known all about it very accurately . "
95490	95595	95599	95599	she	350	" No ; then I asked Kate , and Kate told me when you were going . Yes ; I know . Kate has been wrong , has n't she ? Kate was cautioned , no doubt , to say nothing about your comings and goings to so inconsiderable a person as myself . But you must not be down upon Kate . She never mentioned it till I showed by my question to her that I knew all about your journey to Matching . I own I do not understand why it should be necessary to keep me so much in the dark . "
95651	95658	95660	95660	George	357	" I can not understand it , "
95668	95741	95660	95660	George	357	" It was but the other day that we were such dear friends ! Do you remember the balcony at Basle ? and now it seems that we are quite estranged;—nay , worse than estranged ; that I am , as it were , under some ban . Have I done anything to offend you , Alice ? If so , speak out , like a woman of spirit as you are . "
95742	95745	95747	95747	Alice	350	" Nothing , "
95749	95812	95747	95747	Alice	350	" Then why am I tabooed ? Why was I told the other day that I might not congratulate you on your happy emancipation ? I say boldly , that had you resolved on that while we were together in Switzerland , you would have permitted me , as a friend , almost as a brother , to discuss it with you . "
95813	95820	95660	95660	George	357	" I think not , George . "
95821	95858	95859	95859	Alice	350	" I am sure you would . And why has Kate been warned not to tell me of this visit to the Pallisers ? I know she has been warned though she has not confessed it . "
95899	95919	95893	95893	Vavasor	356	" If there be any reason , Alice , I think that I have a right to ask it . "
95990	96000	96001	96001	she	350	" I think that you have such a right , "
96006	96013	96001	96001	she	350	" Then let me exercise it . "
96014	96036	95971	95971	She	350	" I think that you have such a right , but I think also that you are ungenerous to exercise it . "
96037	96076	95971	95971	She	350	" I can not understand that . By heavens , Alice , I can not be left in this suspense ! If I have done anything to offend you , perhaps I can remove the offence by apology . "
96077	96086	96001	96001	she	350	" You have done nothing to offend me . "
96087	96154	95971	95971	She	350	" Or if there be any cause why our friendship should be dropped,—why we should be on a different footing to each other in London than we were in Switzerland , I may acknowledge it , if it be explained to me . But I can not put up with the doubt , when I am told that I have a right to demand its solution . "
96155	96181	96182	96182	She	3170	" Then I will be frank with you , George , though my being so will , as you may guess , be very painful . "
96217	96279	96214	96214	his	3171	" Your sister , George , has thought that my parting with Mr. Grey might lead to a renewal of a purpose of marriage between you and me . You know her eagerness , and will understand that it may have been necessary that I should require silence from her on that head . You ought now to understand it all . "
96280	96290	96291	96291	he	3171	" I then am being punished for her sins , "
96318	96341	96315	96315	his	3171	" I have said nothing about any sins , George , but I have found it necessary to be on my guard . "
96342	96345	96346	96346	he	3171	" Well , "
96354	96386	96346	96346	he	3171	" You are an honest woman , Alice,—the honestest I ever knew . I will bring Kate to order,—and , now , we may be friends again ; may we not ? "
96398	96401	96402	96402	she	3172	" Yes , "
96405	96413	96414	96414	She	3172	" certainly , if you wish it . "
96438	96447	96449	96449	he	3171	" I certainly do wish it very much , "
96459	96470	96453	96453	she	3172	" And I may now talk about your new freedom ? "
96471	96474	96476	96476	she	3172	" No , "
96478	96520	96476	96476	she	3172	" no . Do not speak of that . A woman does not do what I have done in that affair without great suffering . I have to think of it daily ; but do not make me speak of it . "
96521	96539	96545	96545	his	3171	" But this other subject , this visit to Matching ; surely I may speak of that ? "
96563	96577	96551	96551	she	3172	" I do n't see what you can have to say about it . "
96578	96604	96545	96545	his	3171	" But I have a great deal . I am so glad you are going . Mind you cement a close intimacy with Mr. Palliser . "
96605	96610	96545	96545	his	3171	" With Mr. Palliser ? "
96611	96639	96551	96551	she	3172	" Yes ; with Mr. Palliser . You must read all the blue books about finance . I 'll send them to you if you like it . "
96640	96645	96551	96551	she	3172	" Oh , George ! "
96646	96689	96545	96545	his	3171	" I 'm quite in earnest . That is , not in earnest about the blue books , as you would not have time ; but about Mr. Palliser . He will be the new Chancellor of the Exchequer without a doubt . "
96690	96718	96545	96545	his	3171	" Will he indeed ? But why should I make a bosom friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer . I do n't want any public money . "
96719	96732	96551	96551	she	3172	" But I do , my girl . Do n't you see ? "
96733	96740	96551	96551	she	3172	" No ; I do n't . "
96741	96753	96545	96545	his	3171	" I think I shall get returned at this next election . "
96754	96763	96545	96545	his	3171	" I 'm sure I hope you will . "
96764	96794	96551	96551	she	3172	" And if I do , of course it will be my game to support the ministry;—or rather the new ministry ; for of course there will be changes . "
96795	96806	96551	96551	she	3172	" I hope they will be on the right side . "
96807	96816	96545	96545	his	3171	" Not a doubt of that , Alice . "
96817	96826	96545	96545	his	3171	" I wish they might be changed altogether . "
96827	96914	96551	96551	she	3172	" Ah ! that 's impossible . It 's very well as a dream ; but there are no such men as you want to see,—men really from the people,—strong enough to take high office . A man ca n't drive four horses because he 's a philanthropist,—or rather a philhorseophist , and is desirous that the team should be driven without any hurt to them . A man ca n't govern well , simply because he is genuinely anxious that men should be well governed . "
96915	96925	96551	96551	she	3172	" And will there never be any such men ? "
96926	97008	96545	96545	his	3171	" I wo n't say that . I do n't mind confessing to you that it is my ambition to be such a one myself . But a child must crawl before he can walk . Such a one as I , hoping to do something in politics , must spare no chance . It would be something to me that Mr. Palliser should become the friend of any dear friend of mine,—especially of a dear friend bearing the same name . "
97009	97029	96551	96551	she	3172	" I 'm afraid , George , you 'll find me a bad hand at making any such friendship . "
97030	97081	96551	96551	she	3172	" They say he is led immensely by his wife , and that she is very clever . But I mean this chiefly , Alice , that I do hope I shall have all your sympathy in any political career that I may make , and all your assistance also . "
97082	97102	96545	96545	his	3171	" My sympathy I think I can promise you . My assistance , I fear , would be worthless . "
97103	97152	96551	96551	she	3172	" By no means worthless , Alice ; not if I see you take that place in the world which I hope to see you fill . Do you think women nowadays have no bearing upon the politics of the times ? Almost as much as men have . "
97456	97468	97438	97439	Another servant	3189	" Dear Alice , I 'm so glad you 've come , "
97476	97493	97438	97439	Another servant	3189	" Look here , dear ; your maid can go in the dog - cart with your things,"—it
97506	97524	97502	97503	Lady Glencora	488	better;—"she'll be quite comfortable there ; and do you get in here . Are you very cold ? "
97525	97535	97425	97429	a lady enveloped in furs	3188	" Oh , no ; not cold at all . "
97536	97566	97502	97503	Lady Glencora	488	" But it is awfully cold . You 've been in the stuffy carriage , but you 'll find it cold enough out here , I can tell you . "
97567	97588	97590	97590	Alice	337	" Oh ! Lady Glencora , I am so sorry that I 've brought you out on such a morning , "
97605	97692	97693	97693	Alice	337	" What nonsense ! Sorry ! Why I 've looked forward to meeting you all alone , ever since I knew you were coming . If it had snowed all the morning I should have come just the same . I drive out almost every day when I 'm down here,—that is , when the house is not too crowded , or I can make an excuse . Wrap these things over you ; there are plenty of them . You shall drive if you like . "
97712	97777	97693	97693	Alice	337	" I like driving better than anything , I think . Mr. Palliser does n't like ladies to hunt , and of course it would n't do as he does not hunt himself . I do ride , but he never gets on horseback . I almost fancy I should like to drive four - in - hand,—only I know I should be afraid . "
97778	97785	97787	97787	Alice	337	" It would look very terrible , "
97789	97896	97897	97897	She	337	" Yes ; would n't it ? The look would be the worst of it ; as it is all the world over . Sometimes I wish there were no such things as looks . I do n't mean anything improper , you know ; only one does get so hampered , right and left , for fear of Mrs. Grundy . I endeavour to go straight , and get along pretty well on the whole , I suppose . Baker , you must put Dandy in the bar ; he pulls so , going home , that I ca n't hold him in the check . "
97931	97936	97897	97897	She	337	" in the bar , "
97953	97961	97963	97964	Lady Glencora	488	" They 're called Dandy and Flirt , "
97970	97996	97963	97964	Lady Glencora	488	" Ai n't they a beautiful match ? The Duke gave them to me and named them himself . Did you ever see the Duke ? "
97997	98000	98002	98002	Alice	337	" Never , "
98004	98143	98148	98148	she	337	" He wo n't be here before Christmas , but you shall be introduced some day in London . He 's an excellent creature and I 'm a great pet of his ; though , after all , I never speak half a dozen words to him when I see him . He 's one of those people who never talk . I 'm one of those who like talking , as you 'll find out . I think it runs in families ; and the Pallisers are non - talkers . That does n't mean that they are not speakers , for Mr. Palliser has plenty to say in the House , and they declare that he 's one of the few public men who 've got lungs enough to make a financial statement without breaking down . "
98240	98252	98254	98255	Lady Glencora	488	" You 're not tired of me already , I hope , "
98257	98264	98266	98266	Alice	337	" I did n't mean that , "
98268	98286	98266	98266	Alice	337	" I delight in the drive . But somehow one expects Matching Station to be near Matching . "
98287	98380	98230	98230	she	488	" Ah , yes ; that 's a great cheat . It 's not Matching Station at all but Matching Road Station , and it 's eight miles . It is a great bore , for though the omnibus brings our parcels , we have to be constantly sending over , and it 's very expensive , I can assure you . I want Mr. Palliser to have a branch , but he says he would have to take all the shares himself , and that would cost more , I suppose . "
98381	98389	98230	98230	she	488	" Is there a town at Matching ? "
98390	98417	98266	98266	Alice	337	" Oh , a little bit of a place . I 'll go round by it if you like , and in at the further gate . "
98418	98423	98425	98425	Alice	337	" Oh , no ! "
98427	98570	98425	98425	Alice	337	" Ah , but I should like . It was a borough once , and belonged to the Duke ; but they put it out at the Reform Bill . They made some kind of bargain;—he was to keep either Silverbridge or Matching , but not both . Mr. Palliser sits for Silverbridge , you know . The Duke chose Silverbridge,—or rather his father did , as he was then going to build his great place in Barsetshire;—that 's near Silverbridge . But the Matching people have n't forgiven him yet . He was sitting for Matching himself when the Reform Bill passed . Then his father died , and he has n't lived there much since . It 's a great deal nicer place than Gatherum Castle , only not half so grand . I hate grandeur ; do n't you ? "
98571	98583	98266	98266	Alice	337	" I never tried much of it , as you have . "
98584	98606	98266	98266	Alice	337	" Come now ; that 's not fair . There 's no one in the world less grand than I am . "
98607	98620	98425	98425	Alice	337	" I mean that I 've not had grand people about me . "
98621	98677	98266	98266	Alice	337	" Having cut all your cousins,—and Lady Midlothian in particular , like a naughty girl as you are . I was so angry with you when you accused me of selling you about that . You ought to have known that I was the last person in the world to have done such a thing . "
98678	98693	98266	98266	Alice	337	" I did not think you meant to sell me , but I thought — "
98694	98772	98425	98425	Alice	337	" Yes , you did , Alice . I know what you thought ; you thought that Lady Midlothian was making a tool of me that I might bring you under her thumb , so that she might bully you into Mr. Grey 's arms . That 's what you thought . I do n't know that I was at all entitled to your good opinion , but I was not entitled to that special bad opinion . "
98773	98789	98266	98266	Alice	337	" I had no bad opinion;—but it was so necessary that I should guard myself . "
98790	98858	98425	98425	Alice	337	" You shall be guarded . I 'll take you under my shield . Mr. Grey sha n't be named to you , except that I shall expect you to tell me all about it ; and you must tell me all about that dangerous cousin , too , of whom they were saying such terrible things down in Scotland . I had heard of him before . "
98981	98990	98977	98977	she	350	" This is the beginning of the park , "
99037	99260	99264	99264	her	3205	" And that is Matching oak , under which Cœur de Lion or Edward the Third , I forget which , was met by Sir Guy de Palisere as he came from the war , or from hunting , or something of that kind . It was the king , you know , who had been fighting or whatever it was , and Sir Guy entertained him when he was very tired . Jeffrey Palliser , who is my husband 's cousin , says that old Sir Guy luckily pulled out his brandy - flask . But the king immediately gave him all the lands of Matching,—only there was a priory then and a lot of monks , and I do n't quite understand how that was . But I know one of the younger brothers always used to be abbot and sit in the House of Lords . And the king gave him Littlebury at the same time , which is about seven miles away from here . As Jeffrey Palliser says , it was a great deal of money for a pull at his flask . Jeffrey Palliser is here now , and I hope you 'll like him . If I have no child , and Mr. Palliser were not to marry again , Jeffrey would be the heir . "
99278	99294	99264	99264	her	3205	" I suppose that 's the way most of the old families got their estates . "
99295	99397	99264	99264	her	3205	" Either so , or by robbery . Many of them were terrible thieves , my dear , and I dare say Sir Guy was no better than he should be . But since that they have always called some of the Pallisers Plantagenet . My husband 's name is Plantagenet . The Duke is called George Plantagenet , and the king was his godfather . The queen is my godmother , I believe , but I do n't know that I 'm much the better for it . There 's no use in godfathers and godmothers;—do you think there is ? "
99398	99407	99264	99264	her	3205	" Not much as it 's managed now . "
99408	99437	99264	99264	her	3205	" If I had a child , — Oh , Alice , it 's a dreadful thing not to have a child when so much depends on it ! "
99438	99449	99264	99264	her	3205	" But you 're such a short time married yet . "
99450	99682	99264	99264	her	3205	" Ah , well ; I can see it in his eyes when he asks me questions ; but I do n't think he 'd say an unkind word , not if his own position depended on it . Ah , well ; this is Matching . That other gate we passed , where Dandy wanted to turn in,—that 's where we usually go up , but I 've brought you round to show you the town . That 's the inn,—whoever can possibly come to stay there I do n't know ; I never saw anybody go in or out . That 's the baker who bakes our bread,—we baked it at the house at first , but nobody could eat it ; and I know that that man there mends Mr. Palliser 's shoes . He 's very particular about his shoes . We shall see the church as we go in at the other gate . It is in the park , and is very pretty,—but not half so pretty as the priory ruins close to the house . The ruins are our great lion . I do so love to wander about them at moonlight . I often think of you when I do ; I do n't know why.—But I do know why , and I 'll tell you some day . Come , Miss Flirt ! "
99931	99937	99939	99939	she	488	" There 's Mr. Palliser , "
99941	99986	99939	99939	she	488	" that shows that you are an honoured guest , for you may be sure that he is hard at work and would not have come out for anybody else . Plantagenet , here is Miss Vavasor , perished . Alice , my husband . "
100002	100013	100015	100015	he	485	" I hope you 've not found it very cold , "
100017	100027	100015	100015	he	485	" The winter has come upon us quite suddenly . "
100259	100266	100267	100268	his wife	830	" Are the people all out ? "
100272	100305	100267	100268	his wife	830	" The men have not come in from shooting;—at least I think not;—and some of the ladies are driving , I suppose . But I have n't seen anybody since you went . "
100306	100408	100411	100411	she	3240	" Of course you have n't . He never has time , Alice , to see any one . But we 'll go up - stairs , dear . I told them to let us have tea in my dressing - room , as I thought you 'd like that better than going into the drawing - room before you had taken off your things . You must be famished , I know . Then you can come down , or if you want to avoid two dressings you can sit over the fire up - stairs till dinner - time . "
100421	100470	100417	100417	Alice	337	" Here 's my dressing - room , and here 's your room all but opposite . You look out into the park . It 's pretty , is n't it ? But come into my dressing - room , and see the ruins out of the window . "
100549	100555	100556	100556	she	488	" Is n't it pretty ? "
100564	100619	100556	100556	she	488	" I call it my dressing - room because in that way I can keep people out of it , but I have my brushes and soap in a little closet there , and my clothes,—my clothes are everywhere I suppose , only there are none of them here . Is n't it pretty ? "
100620	100624	100556	100556	she	488	" Very pretty . "
100625	100678	100556	100556	she	488	" The Duke did it all . He understands such things thoroughly . Now to Mr. Palliser a dressing - room is a dressing - room , and a bedroom a bedroom . He cares for nothing being pretty ; not even his wife , or he would n't have married me . "
100679	100690	100556	100556	she	488	" You would n't say that if you meant it . "
100691	100772	100774	100774	she	3244	" Well , I do n't know . Sometimes when I look at myself , when I simply am myself , with no making up or grimacing , you know , I think I 'm the ugliest young woman the sun ever shone on . And in ten years ' time I shall be the ugliest old woman . Only think,—my hair is beginning to get grey , and I 'm not twenty - one yet . Look at it ; "
100785	100804	100774	100774	she	3244	" But there 's one comfort ; he does n't care about beauty . How old are you ? "
100805	100813	100815	100815	Alice	337	" Over five - and - twenty , "
100817	100832	100815	100815	Alice	337	" Nonsense;—then I ought n't to have asked you . I am so sorry . "
100833	100853	100556	100556	she	488	" That 's nonsense at any rate . Why should you think I should be ashamed of my age ? "
100854	100908	100774	100774	she	3244	" I do n't know why , only somehow , people are ; and I did n't think you were so old . Five - and - twenty seems so old to me . It would be nothing if you were married ; only , you see , you wo n't get married . "
100909	100918	100815	100815	Alice	337	" Perhaps I may yet ; some day . "
100919	100967	100556	100556	she	488	" Of course you will . You 'll have to give way . You 'll find that they 'll get the better of you . Your father will storm at you , and Lady Macleod will preach at you , and Lady Midlothian will jump upon you . "
100968	100979	100774	100774	she	3244	" I 'm not a bit afraid of Lady Midlothian . "
100980	101053	100815	100815	Alice	337	" I know what it is , my dear , to be jumped upon . We talked with such horror of the French people giving their daughters in marriage , just as they might sell a house or a field , but we do exactly the same thing ourselves . When they all come upon you in earnest how are you to stand against them ? How can any girl do it ? "
101054	101062	100556	100556	she	488	" I think I shall be able . "
101063	101235	100815	100815	Alice	337	" To be sure you 're older,—and you are not so heavily weighted . But never mind ; I did n't mean to talk about that;—not yet at any rate . Well , now , my dear , I must go down . The Duchess of St. Bungay is here , and Mr. Palliser will be angry if I do n't do pretty to her . The Duke is to be the new President of the Council , or rather , I believe he is President now . I try to remember it all , but it is so hard when one does n't really care two pence how it goes . Not but what I 'm very anxious that Mr. Palliser should be Chancellor of the Exchequer . And now , will you remain here , or will you come down with me , or will you go to your own room , and I 'll call for you when I go down to dinner ? We dine at eight . "
101291	101308	101310	101311	the girl	922	" I shall feel so strange , ma'am , among all those people down - stairs , "
101313	101331	101310	101311	the girl	922	" They all seem to look at me as though they did n't know who I was . "
101332	101342	101310	101311	the girl	922	" You 'll get over that soon , Jane . "
101343	101363	101310	101311	the girl	922	" I suppose I shall ; but you see , they 're all like knowing each other , miss . "
101670	101680	101682	101682	Alice	350	" She should never mention it to any one , "
101686	101711	101682	101682	Alice	350	" If her lot in life has not satisfied her , there is so much the more reason why she should not mention it . "
101851	101857	101848	101848	she	488	said,—"so much depended on it . "
101936	101946	101947	101948	her mistress	2342	" How do you get on below , Jane ? "
101952	102025	101947	101948	her mistress	2342	" Why , miss , they are uncommon civil , and I do n't think after all it will be so bad . We had our teas very comfortable in the housekeeper 's room . There are five or six of us altogether , all ladies'-maids , miss ; and there 's nothing on earth to do all the day long , only sit and do a little needlework over the fire . "
102100	102105	102106	102106	she	488	" Let me see , "
102117	102174	102106	102106	she	488	" I 'll tell Jeffrey to take you in to dinner . He 's about the easiest young man we have here . He rather turns up his nose at everything , but that does n't make him the less agreeable ; does it , dear?—unless he turns up his nose at you , you know . "
102175	102181	102106	102106	she	488	" But perhaps he will . "
102182	102213	102214	102214	she	3278	" No ; he wo n't do that . That would be uncourteous,—and he 's the most courteous man in the world . There 's nobody here , you see , "
102222	102333	102214	102214	she	3278	" and I did n't suppose there would be . It 's always proper to be first in one 's own house . I do so try to be proper,—and it is such trouble . Talking of people earning their bread , Alice;—I'm sure I earn mine . Oh dear!—what fun it would be to be sitting somewhere in Asia , eating a chicken with one 's fingers , and lighting a big fire outside one 's tent to keep off the lions and tigers . Fancy your being on one side of the fire and the lions and tigers on the other , grinning at you through the flames ! "
102352	102362	102364	102364	Alice	350	" That sort of grin would n't frighten me , "
102366	102423	102364	102364	Alice	350	" I dare say not . I have been reading about it in that woman 's travels . Oh , here they are , and I must n't make any more faces . Duchess , do come to the fire . I hope you 've got warm again . This is my cousin , Miss Vavasor . "
102443	102514	102438	102438	she	3281	" I do n't know how you manage in your house , but the staircases are so comfortable . Now at Longroyston we 've taken all the trouble in the world,—put down hot - water pipes all over the house , and everything else that could be thought of , and yet , you ca n't move about the place without meeting with draughts at every corner of the passages . "
102555	102557	102549	102549	she	3281	" pipes "
102575	102600	102549	102549	she	3281	" I was telling Lady Glencora , Miss Palliser , that I never knew a house so warm as this,—or , I 'm sorry to say,"—and
102610	102615	102549	102549	she	3281	sorry,—"so cold as Longroyston . "
102759	102772	102774	102775	Miss Palliser	519	" It 's always easy to warm a small house like this , "
102798	102812	102774	102775	Miss Palliser	519	Iphy—"and I suppose equally difficult to warm a large one such as Longroyston . "
102822	102835	102837	102838	Lady Glencora	488	" We 've got no pipes , Duchess , at any rate , "
102966	102988	102942	102943	Mr. Palliser	485	" My wife has been thinking so much of your coming . I hope we shall be able to amuse you . "
103049	103063	103064	103064	she	488	" You must take my cousin , Alice Vavasor , in to dinner , "
103067	103076	103064	103064	she	488	" and;—will you oblige me to - day ? "
103077	103085	103097	103097	she	488	" Yes;—as you ask me like that . "
103086	103094	103097	103097	she	488	" Then try to make her comfortable . "
103210	103216	103201	103202	Lady Glencora	488	" My cousin , Duke , "
103221	103227	103217	103218	Lady Glencora	488	" and a terrible Radical . "
103228	103261	103262	103262	Alice	337	" Oh , indeed ; I 'm glad of that . We 're sadly in want of a few leading Radicals , and perhaps I may be able to gain one now . "
103288	103301	103302	103302	she	337	" But I 'm afraid I never shall be a leading Radical , "
103305	103318	103320	103320	he	515	" You shall lead me at any rate , if you will , "
103322	103332	103334	103335	Lady Glencora	488	" As the little dogs lead the blind men , "
103337	103382	103334	103335	Lady Glencora	488	" No , Lady Glencora , not so . But as the pretty women lead the men who have eyes in their head . There is nothing I want so much , Miss Vavasor , as to become a Radical;—if I only knew how . "
103383	103394	103396	103396	Alice	337	" I think it 's very easy to know how , "
103398	103440	103396	103396	Alice	337	" Do you ? I do n't . I 've voted for every liberal measure that has come seriously before Parliament since I had a seat in either House , and I 've not been able to get beyond Whiggery yet . "
103441	103449	103451	103451	Alice	337	" Have you voted for the ballot ? "
103465	103519	103460	103460	she	337	" Well ; no , I 've not . And I suppose that is the crux . But the ballot has never been seriously brought before any House in which I have sat . I hate it with so keen a private hatred , that I doubt whether I could vote for it . "
103520	103527	103529	103529	Alice	337	" But the Radicals love it , "
103531	103534	103536	103537	the Duke	2896	" Palliser , "
103548	103570	103536	103537	the Duke	2896	" I 'm told you can never be entitled to call yourself a Radical till you 've voted for the ballot . "
103571	103582	103584	103585	Mr. Palliser,—"or	523	" I do n't want to be called a Radical , "
103585	103593	103584	103585	Mr. Palliser,—"or	523	Palliser,—"or to be called anything at all . "
103594	103601	103603	103604	Lady Glencora	488	" Except Chancellor of the Exchequer , "
103610	103626	103628	103629	the Duke	2896	" And that 's about the finest ambition by which a man can be moved , "
103631	103648	103628	103629	the Duke	2896	" The man who can manage the purse - strings of this country can manage anything . "
103660	103669	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I was especially commissioned to amuse you , "
103677	103702	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" But when I undertook the task I had no conception that you would be calling Cabinet Ministers over the coals about their politics . "
103703	103734	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I did nothing of the kind , surely , Mr. Palliser . I suppose all Radicals do vote for the ballot , and that 's why I said it . "
103735	103748	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Your definition was perfectly just , I dare say , only — "
103749	103753	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Only what ? "
103754	103811	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Lady Glencora need not have been so anxious to provide specially for your amusement . Not but what I 'm very much obliged to her,—of course . But Miss Vavasor , unfortunately I 'm not a politician . I have n't a chance of a seat in the House , and so I despise politics . "
103812	103824	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Women are not allowed to be politicians in this country . "
103825	103890	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Thank God , they ca n't do much in that way;—not directly , I mean . Only think where we should be if we had a feminine House of Commons , with feminine debates , carried on , of course , with feminine courtesy . My cousins Iphy and Phemy there would of course be members . You do n't know them yet ? "
103891	103901	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No ; not yet . Are they politicians ? "
103902	104000	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Not especially . They have their tendencies , which are decidedly liberal . There has never been a Tory Palliser known , you know . But they are too clever to give themselves up to anything in which they can do nothing . Being women they live a depressed life , devoting themselves to literature , fine arts , social economy , and the abstract sciences . They write wonderful letters ; but I believe their correspondence lists are quite full , so that you have no chance at present of getting on either of them . "
104001	104015	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I have n't the slightest pretension to ask for such an honour . "
104016	104037	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Oh ! if you mean because you do n't know them , that has nothing to do with it . "
104038	104049	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" But I have no claim either private or public . "
104050	104120	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" That has nothing to do with it either . They do n't at all seek people of note as their correspondents . Free communication with all the world is their motto , and Rowland Hill is the god they worship . Only they have been forced to guard themselves against too great an accession of paper and ink . Are you fond of writing letters , Miss Vavasor ? "
104121	104135	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Yes , to my friends ; but I like getting them better . "
104136	104245	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I shrewdly suspect they do n't read half what they get . Is it possible any one should go through two sheets of paper filled by our friend the Duchess there ? No ; their delight is in writing . They sit each at her desk after breakfast , and go on till lunch . There is a little rivalry between them , not expressed to each other , but visible to their friends . Iphy certainly does get off the greater number , and I 'm told crosses quite as often as Phemy , but then she has the advantage of a bolder and larger hand . "
104246	104253	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Do they write to you ? "
104254	104325	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Oh , dear no . I do n't think they ever write to any relative . They do n't discuss family affairs and such topics as that . Architecture goes a long way with them , and whether women ought to be clerks in public offices . Iphy has certain American correspondents that take up much of her time , but she acknowledges she does not read their letters . "
104326	104336	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Then I certainly shall not write to her . "
104337	104380	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" But you are not American , I hope . I do hate the Americans . It 's the only strong political feeling I have . I went there once , and found I could n't live with them on any terms . "
104381	104405	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" But they please themselves . I do n't see they are to be hated because they do n't live after our fashion . "
104406	104468	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Oh ; it 's jealousy of course . I know that . I did n't come across a cab - driver who was n't a much better educated man than I am . And as for their women , they know everything . But I hated them , and I intend to hate them . You have n't been there ? "
104469	104473	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Oh no . "
104474	104558	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Then I will make bold to say that any English lady who spent a month with them and did n't hate them would have very singular tastes . I begin to think they 'll eat each other up , and then there 'll come an entirely new set of people of a different sort . I always regarded the States as a Sodom and Gomorrah , prospering in wickedness , on which fire and brimstone were sure to fall sooner or later . "
104559	104566	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I think that 's wicked . "
104567	104582	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I am wicked , as Topsy used to say . Do you hunt ? "
104583	104586	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No . "
104587	104592	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Do you shoot ? "
104593	104602	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Shoot ! What ; with a gun ? "
104603	104623	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Yes . I was staying in a house last week with a lady who shot a good deal . "
104624	104632	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No ; I do n't shoot . "
104633	104638	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Do you ride ? "
104639	104661	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No ; I wish I did . I have never ridden because I 've no one to ride with me . "
104662	104667	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Do you drive ? "
104668	104677	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No ; I do n't drive either . "
104678	104685	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Then what do you do ? "
104686	104694	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I sit at home , and — "
104695	104700	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Mend your stockings ? "
104701	104731	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No ; I do n't do that , because it 's disagreeable ; but I do work a good deal . Sometimes I have amused myself by reading . "
104732	104820	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Ah ; they never do that here . I have heard that there is a library , but the clue to it has been lost , and nobody now knows the way . I do n't believe in libraries . Nobody ever goes into a library to read , any more than you would into a larder to eat . But there is this difference;—the food you consume does come out of the larders , but the books you read never come out of the libraries . "
104821	104826	104828	104828	Alice	337	" Except Mudie 's , "
104830	104856	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Ah , yes ; he is the great librarian . And you mean to read all the time you are here , Miss Vavasor ? "
104857	104868	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I mean to walk about the priory ruins sometimes . "
104869	104896	104910	104911	the Duke	2896	" Then you must go by moonlight , and I 'll go with you . Only is n't it rather late in the year for that ? "
104897	104908	103671	103673	Mr. Jeffrey Palliser	485	" I should think it is,—for you , Mr. Palliser . "
105061	105072	105074	105075	Lady Glencora	488	" Jeffrey is a pleasant fellow , is he not ? "
105093	105101	105074	105075	Lady Glencora	488	" Very pleasant;—a little sarcastic , perhaps . "
105102	105125	105127	105128	Lady Glencora	488	" I should think you would soon find yourself able to get the better of that if he tries it upon you , "
105143	105157	105159	105160	the Duchess	3281	" It is quite deliciously warm , coming from one room to another , "
105167	105169	105159	105160	the Duchess	3281	" one "
105172	105175	105163	105163	her	3281	" other . "
105176	105185	105189	105191	Mrs. Conway Sparkes	531	" Then we had better keep continually moving , "
105230	105240	105242	105243	Lady Glencora	488	" I hope we may be warm here too , "
105245	105251	105242	105243	Lady Glencora	488	" But not deliciously warm , "
105257	105271	105253	105255	Mrs. Conway Sparkes	531	" It makes me tremble in every limb when Mrs. Sparkes attacks her , "
105285	105330	105272	105273	Lady Glencora	488	" for I know she 'll tell the Duke ; and he 'll tell that tall man with red hair whom you see standing about , and the tall man with red hair will tell Mr. Palliser , and then I shall catch it . "
105331	105342	105253	105255	Mrs. Conway Sparkes	531	" And who is the tall man with red hair ? "
105343	105369	105272	105273	Lady Glencora	488	" He 's a political link between the Duke and Mr. Palliser . His name is Bott , and he 's a Member of Parliament . "
105370	105377	105272	105273	Lady Glencora	488	" But why should he interfere ? "
105378	105460	105253	105255	Mrs. Conway Sparkes	531	" I suppose it 's his business . I do n't quite understand all the ins and outs of it . I believe he 's to be one of Mr. Palliser 's private secretaries if he becomes Chancellor of the Exchequer . Perhaps he does n't tell;—only I think he does all the same . He always calls me Lady Glen - cowrer . He comes out of Lancashire , and made calico as long as he could get any cotton . "
105658	105662	105664	105665	Lady Glencora	488	" Alice Vavasor , "
105679	105685	105664	105665	Lady Glencora	488	" can you play billiards ? "
105686	105689	105691	105691	Alice	337	" No , "
105696	105719	105691	105691	Alice	337	" Then you shall learn to - night , and if nobody else will teach you , you shall be my pupil . "
105738	105748	105750	105751	Lady Glencora	488	" You 'll play , Duchess , of course , "
105753	105767	105769	105770	the Duchess	3281	" It is so nice and warm , that I think I will , "
105792	105798	105776	105776	she	3281	" Let us all play , "
105804	105816	105800	105802	Mrs. Conway Sparkes	531	" and then it will be nicer,—and perhaps warmer , too . "
105976	105984	105986	105987	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" I wish I could play billiards , "
105995	106000	105986	105987	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" I do indeed . "
106001	106012	106014	106015	the Duchess	3281	" I thought you said you were coming to play , "
106033	106040	106042	106043	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Only to see your Grace , "
106045	106064	106066	106067	the Duchess	3281	" I do n't know that there is anything more to see in me than in anybody else , "
106069	106086	106066	106067	the Duchess	3281	" Mr. Palliser , that was a cannon . Will you mark that for our side ? "
106087	106100	106042	106043	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Oh no , Duchess , you hit the same ball twice . "
106101	106125	106066	106067	the Duchess	3281	" Very well;—then I suppose Miss Vavasor plays now . That was a miss . Will you mark that , if you please ? "
106306	106318	106323	106323	she	488	" I 'll come into your room just for one minute , "
106346	106368	106339	106339	she	488	" Would you mind going into my room — it 's just there , and sitting with Ellen for a minute ? "
106411	106451	106396	106396	she	488	" I must keep you up for a quarter of an hour while I tell you something . But first of all , how do you like the people ? Will you be able to be comfortable with them ? "
106487	106497	106499	106500	Lady Glencora	488	" But I 've got something to tell you , "
106512	106530	106499	106500	Lady Glencora	488	" Sit down opposite to me , and look at the fire while I look at you . "
106531	106537	106457	106457	she	337	" Is it anything terrible ? "
106538	106544	106457	106457	she	337	" It 's nothing wrong . "
106545	106555	106499	106500	Lady Glencora	488	" Oh , Lady Glencora , if it 's — "
106556	106603	106457	106457	she	337	" I wo n't have you call me Lady Glencora . Do n't I call you Alice ? Why are you so unkind to me ? I have not come to you now asking you to do for me anything that you ought not to do . "
106604	106614	106457	106457	she	337	" But you are going to tell me something . "
106649	106696	106499	106500	Lady Glencora	488	" Tell you something;—of course I am . I 'm going to tell you that,—that in writing to you the other day I wrote a fib . But it was n't that I wished to deceive you;—only I could n't say it all in a letter . "
106697	106702	106457	106457	she	337	" Say all what ? "
106703	106724	106457	106457	she	337	" You know I confessed that I had been very bad in not coming to you in London last year . "
106725	106735	106499	106500	Lady Glencora	488	" I never thought of it for a moment . "
106736	106792	106457	106457	she	337	" You did not care whether I came or not : was that it ? But never mind . Why should you have cared ? But I cared . I told you in my letter that I did n't come because I had so many things on hand . Of course that was a fib . "
106793	106801	106803	106803	Alice	337	" Everybody makes excuses of that kind , "
106805	106858	106860	106860	she	337	" But they do n't make them to the very people of all others whom they want to know and love . I was longing to come to you every day . But I feared I could not come without speaking of him;—and I had determined never to speak of him again . "
106873	106883	106860	106860	she	337	" Then why do it now , Lady Glencora ? "
106884	106980	106499	106500	Lady Glencora	488	" I wo n't be called Lady Glencora . Call me Cora . I had a sister once , older than I , and she used to call me Cora . If she had lived—. But never mind that now . She did n't live . I 'll tell you why I do it now . Because I can not help it . Besides , I 've met him . I 've been in the same room with him , and have spoken to him . What 's the good of any such resolution now ? "
106981	106988	106860	106860	she	337	" And you have met him ? "
106989	107024	106860	106860	she	337	" Yes ; he — Mr. Palliser — knew all about it . When he talked of taking me to the house , I whispered to him that I thought Burgo would be there . "
107025	107035	107037	107037	Alice	337	" Do not call him by his Christian name , "
107044	107067	107037	107037	Alice	337	" Why not?—why not his Christian name ? I did when I told my husband . Or perhaps I said Burgo Fitzgerald . "
107068	107071	106860	106860	she	337	" Well . "
107072	107125	107128	107128	she	337	" And he bade me go . He said it did n't signify , and that I had better learn to bear it . Bear it , indeed ! If I am to meet him , and speak to him , and look at him , surely I may mention his name . "
107134	107139	107128	107128	she	337	" May I not ? "
107140	107147	107149	107149	Alice	337	" What am I to say ? "
107151	107197	107128	107128	she	337	" Anything you please , that 's not a falsehood . But I 've got you here because I do n't think you will tell a falsehood . Oh , Alice , I do so want to go right , and it is so hard ! "
107292	107302	107304	107305	Lady Glencora	488	" I knew you would be good to me , "
107307	107363	107304	107305	Lady Glencora	488	" I knew you would . And you may say whatever you like . But I could not bear that you should not know the real reason why I neither came to you nor sent for you after we went to London . You 'll come to me now ; wo n't you , dear ? "
107364	107372	107374	107374	Alice	337	" Yes;—and you 'll come to me , "
107425	107433	107434	107434	she	337	" But I 'll come to you , "
107437	107446	107434	107434	she	337	" whether you come to me or not . "
107447	107454	107456	107457	Lady Glencora	488	" I will go to you , "
107459	107484	107456	107457	Lady Glencora	488	" of course,—why should n't I ? But you know what I mean . We shall have dinners and parties and lots of people . "
107485	107492	107494	107494	Alice	350	" And we shall have none , "
107498	107569	107494	107494	Alice	350	" And therefore there is so much more excuse for your coming to me;—or rather I mean so much more reason , for I do n't want excuses . Well , dear , I 'm so glad I 've told you . I was afraid to see you in London . I should hardly have known how to look at you then . But I 've got over that now . "
107632	107738	107745	107746	Lady Glencora	488	" I declare it 's ever so much past twelve . Good night , now , dear . I wonder whether he 's come up . But I should have heard his step if he had . He never treads lightly . He seldom gives over work till after one , and sometimes goes on till three . It 's the only thing he likes , I believe . God bless you ! good night . I 've such a deal more to say to you ; and Alice , you must tell me something about yourself , too ; wo n't you , dear ? "
109003	109014	108986	108986	she	488	" You must know that I have really loved him . "
109015	109022	109023	109023	he	485	" You must love me now , "
110595	110612	110613	110613	he	2896	" If you do n't like the people , my dear , we will go away , "
110627	110630	110631	110631	she	1625	" No , "
110634	110676	110631	110631	she	1625	" I do not wish to go away . I have said that we would stay till December , and Longroyston wo n't be ready before that . But I think that something ought to be done to silence that woman . "
110683	110686	110698	110699	The Duke	2896	" something , "
110694	110697	110698	110699	The Duke	2896	" woman . "
110735	110746	110748	110749	the husband	3493	" I do n't think she is worth your attention , "
110751	110760	110762	110763	the wife	819	" That 's all very well , Duke , "
110765	110801	110762	110763	the wife	819	" and perhaps she is not . But I find her in this house , and I do n't like to be laughed at . I think Lady Glencora should make her know her place . "
110802	110812	110762	110763	the wife	819	" Lady Glencora is very young , my dear . "
110813	110824	110826	110827	the Duchess	3281	" I do n't know about being so very young , "
111244	111251	111252	111253	Mr. Palliser	485	" And Mr. Bott is coming , "
111260	111264	111252	111253	Mr. Palliser	485	" Mr. Bott ! "
111270	111279	111265	111266	Lady Glencora	488	" Goodness me ! who is Mr. Bott ? "
111280	111288	111290	111291	Mr. Palliser	485	" He is member for St. Helens , "
111293	111302	111290	111291	Mr. Palliser	485	" A very serviceable man in his way . "
111303	111313	111315	111316	Lady Glencora	488	" And what am I to do with him ? "
111318	111358	111315	111316	Lady Glencora	488	" I do n't know that you can do anything with him . He is a man who has a great deal of business , and I dare say he will spend most of his time in the library . "
111644	111654	111655	111656	Lady Glencora	488	" I should n't dislike Mr. Bott so much , "
111662	111693	111655	111656	Lady Glencora	488	" if he did n't rub his hands and smile so often , and seem to be going to say something when he really is not going to say anything . "
111694	111709	111710	111711	Mr. Palliser	485	" I do n't think you need trouble yourself about him , my dear , "
111715	111761	111710	111711	Mr. Palliser	485	" But when he looks at me in that way , I ca n't help stopping , as I think he is going to speak ; and then he always says , ' Can I do anything for you , Lady Glen - cowrer ? ' "
111773	111783	111784	111784	she	3529	" Do n't be angry with me , dear , "
111787	111798	111784	111784	she	3529	" You must admit that he is rather a bore . "
111799	111809	111811	111812	the husband	3493	" I am not at all angry , Glencora , "
111814	111867	111811	111812	the husband	3493	" and if you insist upon it , I will see that he leaves;—and in such case will of course never ask him again . But that might be prejudicial to me , as he is a man whom I trust in politics , and who may perhaps be serviceable to me . "
112050	112063	112065	112066	the Duke	2896	" You seem to have a good man , I should say , "
112068	112088	112065	112066	the Duke	2896	" What ! Hubbings ? Yes;—he was a legacy from my uncle when he gave me up the Priory . "
112089	112137	112177	112177	he	2896	" A very good man , I should say . Of course he wo n't make it pay ; but he 'll make it look as though it did;—which is the next best thing . I could never get rent out of land that I farmed myself,—never . "
112138	112143	112145	112146	Mr. Palliser	485	" I suppose not , "
112257	112267	112268	112269	Mr. Bott	532	" We shall muster pretty strong , your Grace , "
112279	112288	112290	112291	the Duke	2896	" That depends on how the changes go , "
112293	112302	112290	112291	the Duke	2896	" I suppose there will be a change ? "
112303	112325	112268	112269	Mr. Bott	532	" Oh yes ; there 'll be a change,—certainly , I should say . And it will be in your direction . "
112326	112332	112290	112291	the Duke	2896	" And in Palliser 's ? "
112333	112356	112268	112269	Mr. Bott	532	" Yes ; I should think so;—that is , if it suits him . By - the - by , Mr. Bott — "
112382	112385	112368	112369	Mr. Bott	532	" telling . "
112447	112455	112457	112457	Glencora	488	" We always are to do that , "
112459	112486	112457	112457	Glencora	488	" It is the state occasion at Gatherum Castle , but it only lasts for one week . Then we go somewhere else . Oh dear ! "
112487	112497	112457	112457	Glencora	488	" Why do you say ' oh dear ' ? "
112498	112512	112457	112457	Glencora	488	" Because — ; I do n't think I mean to tell you . "
112513	112523	112457	112457	Glencora	488	" Then I 'm sure I wo n't ask . "
112524	112556	112457	112457	Glencora	488	" That 's so like you , Alice . But I can be as firm as you , and I 'm sure I wo n't tell you unless you do ask . "
112639	112671	112672	112673	Lady Glencora	488	" her cousin was a very nice person,—a very nice person indeed . What a pity it was that she had been so ill - treated by that gentleman in Oxfordshire ! "
112698	112708	112710	112711	the Duchess	3281	" Do you mean that she — jilted him ? "
112723	112740	112710	112711	the Duchess	3281	" Dear me , I 'm sorry for that . I should n't have thought it . "
112831	112837	112839	112839	Alice	350	" I rather think not , "
112841	112857	112839	112839	Alice	350	" But what has thinking to do with it ? Who ever thinks about it ? "
112858	112868	112817	112818	Lady Glencora	488	" I do n't just at present,—at any rate . "
112869	112888	112839	112839	Alice	350	" Upon my word it would be very nice;—and then perhaps some day you 'd be the Duchess . "
112889	112898	112839	112839	Alice	350	" Glencora , do n't talk such nonsense . "
112899	112924	112817	112818	Lady Glencora	488	" Those are the speculations which people make . Only I should spite you by killing myself , so that he might marry again . "
112925	112934	112839	112839	Alice	350	" How can you say such horrid things ? "
112935	112992	112839	112839	Alice	350	" I think I shall,—some day . What right have I to stand in his way ? He spoke to me the other day about Jeffrey 's altered position , and I knew what he meant;—or rather what he did n't mean to say , but what he thought . But I sha n't kill myself . "
112993	112999	112817	112818	Lady Glencora	488	" I should think not . "
113000	113008	113010	113011	Lady Glencora	488	" I only know one other way , "
113013	113027	113029	113029	Alice	350	" You are thinking of things which should never be in your thoughts , "
113032	113053	113029	113029	Alice	350	" Have you no trust in God 's providence ? Can not you accept what has been done for you ? "
113091	113098	113100	113101	Lady Glencora	488	" I did not tell you , "
113104	113122	113103	113103	her	488	friend;—"I did not tell you before he went that I was right about his tale - bearing . "
113123	113130	113103	113103	her	488	" And did he bear tales ? "
113131	113179	113103	113103	her	488	" Yes ; I did get the scolding , and I know very well that it came through him , though Mr. Palliser did not say so . But he told me that the Duchess had felt herself hurt by that other woman 's way of talking . "
113180	113188	113103	113103	her	488	" But it was not your fault . "
113189	113330	113103	113103	her	488	" No ; that 's what I said . It was he who desired me to ask Mrs. Conway Sparkes to come here . I did n't want her . She goes everywhere , and it is thought a catch to get her ; but if she had been drowned in the Red Sea I should n't have minded . When I told him that , he said it was nonsense,—which of course it was ; and then he said I ought to make her hold her tongue . Of course I said I could n't . Mrs. Conway Sparkes would n't care for me . If she quizzed me , myself , I told him that I could take care of myself , though she were ten times Mrs. Conway Sparkes , and had written finer poetry than Tennyson . "
113331	113338	113340	113340	Alice	350	" It is fine;—some of it , "
113342	113403	113340	113340	Alice	350	" Oh , I dare say ! I know a great deal of it by heart , only I would n't give her the pleasure of supposing that I had ever thought so much about her poetry . And then I told him that I could n't take care of the Duchess,—and he told me that I was a child . "
113404	113412	113103	113103	her	488	" He only meant that in love . "
113413	113458	113103	113103	her	488	" I am a child ; I know that . Why did n't he marry some strong - minded , ferocious woman that could keep his house in order , and frown Mrs. Sparkes out of her impudence ? It was n't my fault . "
113459	113467	113340	113340	Alice	350	" You did n't tell him that . "
113468	113591	113103	113103	her	488	" But I did . Then he kissed me , and said it was all right , and told me that I should grow older . ' And Mrs. Sparkes will grow more impudent , ' I said , ' and the Duchess more silly . ' And after that I went away . Now this horrid Mr. Bott has come back again , and only that it would be mean in me to condescend so far , I would punish him . He grins and smiles at me , and rubs his big hands more than ever , because he feels that he has behaved badly . Is it not horrid to have to live in the house with such people ? "
113592	113603	113340	113340	Alice	350	" I do n't think you need mind him much . "
113604	113636	113103	113103	her	488	" Yes ; but I am the mistress here , and am told that I am to entertain the people . Fancy entertaining the Duchess of St. Bungay and Mr. Bott ! "
113676	113682	113684	113684	Alice	350	" As regards Mr. Bott , "
113686	113701	113684	113684	Alice	350	" I think you should bear it as though there were no such person . "
113702	113711	113746	113747	Lady Glencora	488	" But that would be pretence,—especially to you . "
113712	113744	113746	113747	Lady Glencora	488	" No ; it would not be pretence ; it would be the reticence which all women should practise,—and you , in your position , more almost than any other woman . "
113973	113986	113988	113989	Mr. Bott	532	" What a delightful person is our dear friend , Lady Glencora ! "
114044	114049	114050	114050	she	350	" Yes , indeed , "
114053	114063	114050	114050	she	350	" How very cold it is to - night ! "
114104	114125	114086	114086	she	350	" Yes , it is cold . You and her ladyship are great friends , I believe , Miss Vavasor . "
114126	114132	114134	114134	Alice	337	" She is my cousin , "
114136	114167	114134	114134	Alice	337	" Ah ! yes ; that is so pleasant . I have reason to know that Mr. Palliser is very much gratified that you should be so much with her . "
114202	114232	114193	114193	she	337	" I do n't know that I am very much with her , and if I were I ca n't think it would make any difference to Mr. Palliser . "
114252	114280	114234	114235	Mr. Bott	532	" I can assure you that those are his sentiments . Of course we all know that dear Lady Glencora is young . She is very young . "
114281	114295	114193	114193	she	337	" Mr. Bott , I really would rather not talk about my cousin . "
114296	114311	114234	114235	Mr. Bott	532	" But , dear Miss Vavasor;—when we both have her welfare in view — ? "
114312	114356	114234	114235	Mr. Bott	532	" I have n't her welfare in view , Mr. Bott ; not in the least . There is no reason why I should . You must excuse me if I say I can not talk about her welfare with a perfect stranger . "
114865	114878	114881	114881	Plantagenet	515	" It is a pity you should do nothing all your life , "
114917	114924	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" What am I to do ? "
114928	114936	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" At any rate you might marry . "
114937	114969	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" Oh , yes;—I could marry . There 's no man so poor but what he can do that . The question would be how I might like the subsequent starvation . "
114970	114998	114999	114999	Jeffrey	485	" I do n't see that you need starve . Though your own fortune is small , it is something,—and many girls have fortunes of their own . "
115015	115030	115031	115031	he	485	" I do n't think I 'm very good at that kind of thing , "
115034	115077	115031	115031	he	485	" When the father and mother came to ask of my house and my home I should break down . I do n't say it as praising myself;—indeed , quite the reverse ; but I fear I have not a mercenary tendency . "
115078	115083	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" That 's nonsense . "
115084	115096	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" Oh , yes ; quite so . I admit that . "
115097	115130	115031	115031	he	485	" Men must have mercenary tendencies or they would not have bread . The man who ploughs that he may live does so because he , luckily , has a mercenary tendency . "
115131	115146	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" Just so . But you see I am less lucky than the ploughman . "
115147	115214	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" There is no vulgar error so vulgar,—that is to say , common or erroneous , as that by which men have been taught to say that mercenary tendencies are bad . A desire for wealth is the source of all progress . Civilization comes from what men call greed . Let your mercenary tendencies be combined with honesty and they can not take you astray . "
115242	115252	115254	115254	Jeffrey	485	" But I have n't got any such tendencies , "
115256	115267	115269	115270	Plantagenet Palliser	484	" Would you like to occupy a farm in Scotland ? "
115272	115277	115269	115270	Plantagenet Palliser	484	" And pay rent ? "
115278	115288	115031	115031	he	485	" You would have to pay rent of course . "
115289	115309	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" Thank you , no . It would be dishonest , as I know I should never pay it . "
115310	115324	115269	115270	Plantagenet Palliser	484	" You are too old , I fear , for the public service . "
115325	115347	115031	115031	he	485	" You mean a desk in the Treasury,—with a hundred a year . Yes ; I think I am too old . "
115348	115358	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" But have you no plan of your own ? "
115359	115376	115269	115270	Plantagenet Palliser	484	" Not much of one . Sometimes I have thought I would go to New Zealand . "
115377	115387	115031	115031	he	485	" You would have to be a farmer there . "
115388	115423	114926	114926	Jeffrey	485	" No;—I should n't do that . I should get up an opposition to the Government and that sort of thing , and then they would buy me off and give me a place . "
115424	115466	115269	115270	Plantagenet Palliser	484	" That does very well here , Jeffrey , if a man can get into Parliament and has capital enough to wait ; but I do n't think it would do out there . Would you like to go into Parliament ? "
115467	115504	115031	115031	he	485	" What ; here ? Of course I should . Only I should be sure to get terribly into debt . I do n't owe very much , now,—not to speak of,—except what I owe you . "
115505	115512	115514	115514	Plantagenet	484	" You owe nothing to me , "
115526	115576	115523	115523	his	484	" No ; do n't speak of it . I have no brother , and between you and me it means nothing . You see , Jeffrey , it may be that I shall have to look to you as my — my — my heir , in short . "
115605	115611	115613	115618	the elder heir of the Pallisers	3616	" That 's all true , "
115620	115648	115649	115649	Jeffrey	485	" but still—. In short , I wish you would do something . Do you think about it ; and then some day speak to me again . "
115834	115845	115847	115848	Lady Glencora	488	" Are you going to ride with us after lunch ? "
115860	115863	115865	115865	Jeffrey	485	" No , "
115867	115874	115865	115865	Jeffrey	485	" I 'm going to study . "
115875	115880	115882	115883	Lady Glencora	488	" To do what ? "
115885	115919	115882	115883	Lady Glencora	488	" To study;—or rather I shall spend to - day in sitting down and considering what I will study . My cousin has just been telling me that I ought to do something . "
115920	115925	115930	115930	her	534	" So you ought , "
115935	115983	115927	115927	Iphigenia	534	" But he did n't seem to have any clear opinion what it ought to be . You see there ca n't be two Chancellors of the Exchequer at the same time . Mrs. Sparkes , what ought a young man like me to set about doing ? "
115984	115993	115995	115996	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Go into Parliament , I should say , "
115998	116052	115995	115996	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Ah , yes ; exactly . He had some notion of that kind , too , but he did n't name any particular place . I think I 'll try the City of London . They 've four there , and of course the chance of getting in would thereby be doubled . "
116053	116066	116068	116069	the Duchess	3281	" I thought that commercial men were generally preferred in the City , "
116083	116097	116099	116100	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Mr. Palliser means to make a fortune in trade as a preliminary , "
116102	116114	116116	116117	the Duchess	3281	" I do n't think he meant anything of the kind , "
116119	116138	116140	116140	Jeffrey	485	" At any rate I have got to do something , so I ca n't go and ride , "
116142	116150	116152	116152	Iphigenia	534	" And you ought to do something , "
116183	116187	116188	116189	the glance	3629	" You see , "
116193	116250	116188	116189	the glance	3629	" Plantagenet is beginning to take an interest in his cousin , and you know why . The man who is to be the father of the future dukes must not be allowed to fritter away his time in obscurity . Had I that cradle up - stairs Jeffrey might be as idle as he pleased . "
116265	116280	116281	116281	he	485	" What is a man like me to do who wants to do something ? "
116334	116345	116320	116320	she	337	" Mrs. Sparkes says you ought to go into Parliament . "
116346	116368	116320	116320	she	337	" Yes;—and the dear Duchess would perhaps suggest a house in Belgrave Square . I want to hear your advice now . "
116369	116379	116320	116320	she	337	" I can only say ditto to Miss Palliser . "
116380	116405	116320	116320	she	337	" What ! Iphy ? About procrastination ? But you see the more of my time he steals the better it is for me . "
116406	116417	116320	116320	she	337	" That 's the evil you have got to cure . "
116418	116426	116320	116320	she	337	" My cousin Plantagenet suggested — marriage . "
116427	116438	116440	116440	Alice	337	" A very good thing too , I 'm sure , "
116442	116455	116440	116440	Alice	337	" only it depends something on the sort of wife you get . "
116456	116469	116320	116320	she	337	" You mean , of course , how much money she has . "
116470	116474	116320	116320	she	337	" Not altogether . "
116475	116509	116320	116320	she	337	" Looking at it from my cousin 's point of view , I suppose that it is the only important point . Who are there coming up this year,—in the way of heiresses ? "
116510	116531	116320	116320	she	337	" Upon my word I do n't know . In the first place , how much money makes an heiress ? "
116532	116549	116320	116320	she	337	" For such a fellow as me , I suppose ten thousand pounds ought to do . "
116550	116556	116558	116558	Alice	337	" That 's not much , "
116569	116645	116558	116558	Alice	337	" No — ; perhaps that 's too moderate . But the lower one went in the money speculation , the greater would be the number to choose from , and the better the chance of getting something decent in the woman herself . I have something of my own,—not much you know ; so with the lady 's ten thousand pounds we might be able to live,—in some second - rate French town perhaps . "
116646	116659	116320	116320	she	337	" But I do n't see what you would gain by that . "
116660	116726	116742	116742	he	3632	" My people here would have got rid of me . That seems to be the great thing . If you hear of any girl with about that sum , moderately good - looking , not too young so that she might know something of the world , decently born , and able to read and write , perhaps you will bear me in mind . "
116727	116733	116735	116735	Alice	337	" Yes , I will , "
116753	116769	116742	116742	he	3632	" When I meet such a one , I will send for you at once . "
116770	116778	116742	116742	he	3632	" You know no such person now ? "
116779	116789	116742	116742	he	3632	" Well , no ; not just at present . "
116790	116803	116804	116805	her cousin	883	" I declare I do n't think he could do anything better , "
116979	116990	116992	116993	Lady Glencora	488	" Though your finger were put out for the ring , "
116999	117012	116992	116993	Lady Glencora	488	" you should go back , if you did not love him . "
117013	117020	117022	117022	Alice	337	" But I did love him , "
117024	117032	117034	117035	Lady Glencora	488	" Then I do n't understand it , "
117067	117080	117082	117083	Lady Glencora	488	" I declare I do n't think he could do any better , "
117085	117097	117099	117099	Alice	337	" If you talk such nonsense , I will not stay , "
117101	117168	117099	117099	Alice	337	" But why should it be nonsense ? You would be very comfortable with your joint incomes . He is one of the best fellows in the world . It is clear that he likes you ; and then we should be so near to each other . I am sure Mr. Palliser would do something for him if he married,—and especially if I asked him . "
117169	117179	117060	117060	they	3641	" I only know of two things against it . "
117180	117186	117060	117060	they	3641	" And what are they ? "
117187	117209	117099	117099	Alice	337	" That he would not take me for his wife , and that I would not take him for my husband . "
117210	117221	117060	117060	they	3641	" Why not ? What do you dislike in him ? "
117222	117249	117060	117060	they	3641	" I do n't dislike him at all . I like him very much indeed . But one ca n't marry all the people one likes . "
117250	117263	117099	117099	Alice	337	" But what reason is there why you should n't marry him ? "
117264	117268	117270	117270	Alice	337	" This chiefly , "
117276	117307	117270	117270	Alice	337	" that I have just separated myself from a man whom I certainly did love truly , and that I can not transfer my affections quite so quickly as that . "
117394	117405	117414	117414	her	488	" It is an unmaidenly thing to do , certainly , "
117418	117447	117414	117414	her	488	" Nay , it is unwomanly ; but one may be driven . One may be so driven that all gentleness of womanhood is driven out of one . "
117448	117453	117414	117414	her	488	" Oh , Glencora ! "
117454	117469	117414	117414	her	488	" I did not propose that you should do it as a sudden thing . "
117470	117473	117414	117414	her	488	" Glencora ! "
117474	117520	117414	117414	her	488	" I did do it suddenly . I know it . I did it like a beast that is driven as its owner chooses . I know it . I was a beast . Oh , Alice , if you know how I hate myself ! "
117521	117531	117533	117533	Alice	337	" But I love you with all my heart , "
117535	117547	117533	117533	Alice	337	" Glencora , I have learned to love you so dearly ! "
117548	117573	117414	117414	her	488	" Then you are the only being that does . He ca n't love me . How is it possible ? You,—and perhaps another . "
117574	117591	117414	117414	her	488	" There are many who love you . He loves you . Mr. Palliser loves you . "
117592	117693	117694	117694	Alice	337	" It is impossible . I have never said a word to him that could make him love me . I have never done a thing for him that can make him love me . The mother of his child he might have loved , because of that . Why should he love me ? We were told to marry each other and did it . When could he have learned to love me ? But , Alice , he requires no loving , either to take it or to give it . I wish it were so with me . "
117717	117721	117724	117724	Glencora	488	" Forgive you ! "
117727	117787	117724	117724	Glencora	488	" What have I to forgive ? You do n't suppose I do not know it all , and think of it all without the chance of some stray word like that ! Forgive you ! I am so grateful that you love me ! Some one 's love I must have found,—or I could not have remained here . "
117996	118009	118011	118012	Mr. Bott	532	" Do you intend to prolong your stay here , Miss Vavasor ? "
118033	118043	118045	118045	Alice	337	" For a few more days , I think , "
118047	118109	118045	118045	Alice	337	" Ah — I'm glad of that . Mr. Palliser has pressed me so much to remain till he goes to the Duke 's , that I can not get away sooner . As I am an unmarried man myself , I can employ my time as well in one place as in another;—at this time of the year at least . "
118110	118118	118120	118120	Alice	337	" You must find that very convenient , "
118122	118181	118120	118120	Alice	337	" Yes , it is convenient . You see in my position,—Parliamentary position , I mean,—I am obliged , as a public man , to act in concert with others . A public man can be of no service unless he is prepared to do that . We must give and take , you know , Miss Vavasor . "
118195	118215	118045	118045	Alice	337	continued—"I always say to the men of my party,—of course I regard myself as belonging to the extreme Radicals . "
118216	118221	118223	118223	Alice	337	" Oh , indeed ! "
118225	118316	118223	118223	Alice	337	" Yes . I came into Parliament on that understanding ; and I have never seen any occasion as yet to change any political opinion that I have expressed . But I always say to the gentlemen with whom I act , that nothing can be done if we do n't give and take . I do n't mind saying to you , Miss Vavasor , that I look upon our friend , Mr. Palliser , as the most rising public man in the country . I do , indeed . "
118317	118327	118334	118334	herself	3658	" I am happy to hear you say so , "
118341	118430	118334	118334	herself	3658	" And I , as an extreme Radical , do not think I can serve my party better than by keeping in the same boat with him , as long as it will hold the two . ' He 'll make a Government hack of you , ' a friend of mine said to me the other day . ' And I 'll make a Manchester school Prime Minister of him , ' I replied . I rather think I know what I 'm about , Miss Vavasor . "
118431	118435	118437	118437	Alice	337	" No doubt , "
118439	118508	118437	118437	Alice	337	" And so does he;—and so does he . Mr. Palliser is not the man to be led by the nose by any one . But it 's a fair system of give and take . You ca n't get on in politics without it . What a charming woman is your relative , Lady Glencowrer ! I remember well what you said to me the other evening . "
118509	118513	118515	118515	Alice	337	" Do you ? "
118517	118536	118515	118515	Alice	337	" And I quite agree with you that confidential intercourse regarding dear friends should not be lightly made . "
118537	118541	118543	118543	Alice	337	" Certainly not , "
118545	118574	118543	118543	Alice	337	" But there are occasions , Miss Vavasor ; there are occasions when the ordinary laws by which we govern our social conduct must be made somewhat elastic . "
118575	118588	118437	118437	Alice	337	" I do n't think this one of them , Mr. Bott . "
118589	118654	118515	118515	Alice	337	" Is it not ? Just listen to me for one moment , Miss Vavasor . Our friend , Mr. Palliser , I am proud to say , relies much upon my humble friendship . Our first connection has , of course , been political ; but it has extended beyond that , and has become pleasantly social;—I may say , very pleasantly social . "
118655	118664	118665	118665	Alice	337	" What a taste Mr. Palliser must have ! "
118670	118693	118665	118665	Alice	337	" But I need not tell you that Lady Glencowrer is — very young ; we may say , very young indeed . "
118694	118709	118710	118711	This Alice	337	" Mr. Bott , I will not talk to you about Lady Glencora Palliser . "
118759	118780	118741	118741	he	532	" When I tell you , Miss Vavasor , that I speak solely with a view to her domestic happiness ! "
118781	118798	118729	118729	She	337	" I do n't think that she wishes to have any such guardian of her happiness . "
118799	118826	118827	118828	Hereupon Alice	544	" But if he wishes it , Miss Vavasor ! Now I have the means of knowing that he has the greatest reliance on your judgement . "
118851	118862	118864	118864	she	531	" Are you running from your breakfast , Miss Vavasor ? "
118866	118879	118881	118881	Alice	337	" No , Mrs. Sparkes ; I am running from Mr. Bott , "
118891	118899	118901	118902	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Mr. Bott , what is this ? "
118904	118911	118901	118902	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Ha , ha , ha , "
118938	118950	118952	118952	she	337	" I hope I shall be able to keep the peace , "
118954	118967	118952	118952	she	337	" I trust his offence was not one that requires special punishment . "
118968	118975	118978	118979	Mr. Bott	532	" Ha , ha , ha , "
119053	119060	119062	119063	Lady Glencora	488	" Mrs. Sparkes , good morning , "
119065	119083	119062	119063	Lady Glencora	488	" I hope nobody has waited breakfast . Good morning , Mr. Bott . Oh , Alice ! "
119084	119090	119092	119092	Alice	337	" What is the matter ? "
119099	119108	119092	119092	Alice	337	" Oh , Alice , such a blow ! "
119136	119140	119142	119143	Lady Glencora	488	" Come here , "
119156	119179	119142	119143	Lady Glencora	488	" Now I shall have to put your confidence in me to the test . This letter is from,—whom do you think ? "
119180	119186	119142	119143	Lady Glencora	488	" How can I guess ? "
119187	119233	119142	119143	Lady Glencora	488	" From Lady Midlothian ! and she 's coming here on Monday , on her road to London . Unless you tell me that you are quite sure this is as unexpected by me as by you , I will never speak to you again . "
119234	119242	119142	119143	Lady Glencora	488	" I am quite sure of that . "
119243	119261	119142	119143	Lady Glencora	488	" Ah ! then we can consult . But first we 'll go and have some breakfast . "
119351	119361	119363	119364	Mr. Palliser	485	" We shall be delighted to see Lady Midlothian , "
119366	119383	119385	119386	Lady Glencora	488	" But there is somebody here who will not be at all delighted to see her , "
119391	119397	119399	119399	he	1073	" Is there , indeed ? "
119401	119406	119399	119399	he	1073	" Who is that ? "
119407	119435	119444	119445	Mr. Palliser	485	" Her most undutiful cousin , Alice Vavasor . But , Alice , Mr. Palliser knows nothing about it , and it is too long to explain . "
119436	119442	119444	119445	Mr. Palliser	485	" I am extremely sorry — "
119447	119460	119462	119462	Alice	337	" I can assure you it does not signify in the least , "
119464	119476	119462	119462	Alice	337	" It will only be taking me away three days earlier . "
119511	119519	119521	119522	Lady Glencora	488	" It will do no such thing , "
119524	119541	119521	119522	Lady Glencora	488	" Do you mean to say that you are coward enough to run away from her ? "
119542	119559	119561	119562	Mr. Palliser	485	" I 'm afraid , Miss Vavasor , that we can hardly bid her not come , "
119589	119677	119572	119572	she	337	" I should tell you , Mr. Palliser , that I have never seen Lady Midlothian , though she is my far - away cousin . Nor have I ever quarrelled with her . But she has given me advice by letter , and I did not answer her because I thought she had no business to interfere . I shall go away , not because I am afraid of her , but because , after what has passed , our meeting would be unpleasant to her . "
119678	119689	119691	119692	Mr. Palliser	485	" You could tell her that Miss Vavasor is here , "
119694	119705	119691	119692	Mr. Palliser	485	" And then she need not come unless she pleased . "
119813	119823	119824	119825	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Is Mr. Bott an admirer of your cousin ? "
119833	119842	119844	119845	Lady Glencora	488	" A very distant one I should think , "
119847	119851	119844	119845	Lady Glencora	488	" Goodness gracious ! "
119871	119884	119844	119845	Lady Glencora	488	" it 's the very last thing I should have dreamt of . "
119885	119897	119899	119900	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" But I did n't dream it , first or last , "
119902	119908	119910	119911	Lady Glencora	488	" Why do you ask ? "
119913	119930	119932	119933	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Do n't suppose that I am asking whether Miss Vavasor is an admirer of his , "
119935	119966	119932	119933	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" I have no suspicion of that nature . I rather think that when he plays Bacchus she plays Ariadne , with full intention of flying from him in earnest . "
119967	119976	119978	119979	Lady Glencora	488	" Is Mr. Bott inclined to play Bacchus ? "
119981	120006	119978	119979	Lady Glencora	488	" I rather thought he was this morning . If you observe , he has something of a godlike and triumphant air about him . "
120007	120018	120020	120021	Lady Glencora	488	" I do n't think his godship will triumph there , "
120023	120036	120038	120040	the old lady	978	" I really think she would be throwing herself very much away , "
120042	120054	120056	120057	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" Miss Vavasor is not at all disposed to do that , "
120135	120144	120146	120147	Lady Glencora	488	" I shall receive her when she comes , "
120149	120161	120146	120147	Lady Glencora	488	" and of course will tell her that you are here . "
120162	120187	120146	120147	Lady Glencora	488	" Yes , that will be best ; and — ; dear me , I declare I do n't know how to manage it . "
120188	120203	120146	120147	Lady Glencora	488	" I 'll bring her to you in my room if you like it . "
120204	120213	120215	120215	Alice	350	" No ; that would be too solemn , "
120217	120232	120215	120215	Alice	350	" That would make her understand that I thought a great deal about her . "
120233	120257	120146	120147	Lady Glencora	488	" Then we 'll let things take their chance , and you shall come across her just as you would any other stranger . "
120723	120728	120730	120731	Lady Glencora	488	" Here is Alice , "
120741	120752	120753	120753	Alice	350	" Alice , let me introduce you to Lady Midlothian . "
120797	120814	120777	120777	She	350	" I am glad at last to be able to make your acquaintance , my dear , "
120819	120823	120777	120777	She	350	" very glad . "
120831	120856	120777	120777	She	350	" Your aunt , Lady Macleod , is one of my oldest friends , and I have heard her speak of you very often . "
120857	120870	120872	120872	Alice	350	" And Lady Macleod has often spoken to me of your ladyship , "
120874	120883	120885	120886	the Countess	994	" Then we know each other 's names , "
120888	120933	120885	120886	the Countess	994	" and it will be well that we should be acquainted with each other 's persons . I am becoming an old woman , and if I did not learn to know you now , or very shortly , I might never do so . "
121040	121046	121048	121048	Alice	350	" You are very kind , "
121050	121058	121060	121061	Lady Midlothian	350	" I would wish to be so , "
121063	121109	121060	121061	Lady Midlothian	350	" Blood is thicker than water , my dear ; and I know no earthly ties that can bind people together if those of family connection will not do so . Your mother , when she and I were young , was my dearest friend . "
121110	121117	121124	121124	she	350	" I never knew my mother , "
121143	121193	121124	121124	she	350	" No , my dear , you never did ; and that is to my thinking another reason why they who loved her should love you . But Lady Macleod is your nearest relative,—on your mother 's side , I mean,—and she has done her duty by you well . "
121194	121202	121060	121061	Lady Midlothian	350	" Indeed she has , Lady Midlothian . "
121203	121243	121124	121124	she	350	" She has , and others , therefore , have been the less called upon to interfere . I only say this , my dear , in my own vindication,—feeling , perhaps , that my conduct needs some excuse . "
121244	121254	121256	121257	Lady Glencora	488	" I 'm sure Alice does not think that , "
121259	121276	121278	121279	Lady Midlothian	350	" It is what I think rather than what Alice thinks that concerns my own shortcomings , "
121291	121304	121308	121308	she	350	" But I have wished to make up for former lost opportunities . "
121320	121345	121308	121308	she	350	" I am very anxious now to be reckoned one of Alice Vavasor 's friends , if she will allow me to become so . "
121346	121354	121364	121366	the old lady	978	" I can only be too proud,—if — "
121355	121362	121364	121366	the old lady	978	" If what , my dear ? "
121408	121415	121391	121391	her	978	" If what , my dear ? "
121416	121420	121422	121423	Lady Glencora	488	" Alice means — "
121425	121434	121436	121437	Lady Midlothian	350	" Let Alice say what she means herself , "
121439	121451	121453	121453	Alice	350	" I hardly know how to say what I do mean , "
121472	121519	121453	121453	Alice	350	" I am assured that you and I , Lady Midlothian , differ very much as to a certain matter ; and as it is one in which I must be guided by my own opinion , and not that of any other person , perhaps — "
121520	121527	121436	121437	Lady Midlothian	350	" You mean about Mr. Grey ? "
121528	121531	121533	121533	Alice	350	" Yes , "
121535	121542	121533	121533	Alice	350	" I mean about Mr. Grey . "
121543	121591	121436	121437	Lady Midlothian	350	" I think so much about that matter , and your happiness as therein concerned , that when I heard that you were here I was determined to take Matching in my way to London , so that I might have an opportunity of speaking to you . "
121592	121601	121603	121604	Lady Glencora	488	" Then you knew that Alice was here , "
121606	121623	121603	121604	Lady Glencora	488	" Of course I did . I suppose you have heard all the history , Glencora ? "
121635	121637	121603	121604	Lady Glencora	488	history,—"the history "
121647	121656	121631	121631	she	488	" And what do you think of it ? "
121712	121723	121725	121726	Lady Midlothian	350	" Perhaps another time and another place may be better , "
121728	121748	121725	121726	Lady Midlothian	350	" but I must go the day after to - morrow,—indeed , I thought of going to - morrow . "
121749	121755	121757	121758	Lady Glencora	488	" Oh , Lady Midlothian ! "
121760	121799	121757	121758	Lady Glencora	488	" You must regard this as merely a passing visit , made upon business . But , as I was saying , when shall I get an opportunity of speaking to Alice where we need not be interrupted ? "
121854	121866	121845	121845	she	350	" Lady Midlothian , it would really be of no use . "
121867	121875	122014	122015	Lady Midlothian	350	" Of no use , my dear ! "
121876	121890	121845	121845	she	350	" No , indeed . I did get your letter , you know . "
121891	121910	121845	121845	she	350	" And as you have not answered it , I have come all this way to see you . "
121911	121934	121940	121941	a stranger	3717	" I shall be so sorry if I give offence , but it is a subject which I can not bring myself to discuss"—she
121955	121967	121845	121845	she	350	uttered,—"which I can not bring myself to discuss with any one . "
121968	121983	121845	121845	she	350	" But you do n't mean to say that you wo n't see me ? "
121984	121993	121995	121995	Alice	350	" I will not talk upon that matter , "
121997	122008	121995	121995	Alice	350	" I will not do it even with Lady Macleod . "
122009	122012	122018	122018	her	350	" No , "
122029	122043	122018	122018	her	350	" and therefore it is so very necessary that other friends should interfere . "
122044	122052	122054	122054	Alice	350	" But I will endure no interference , "
122056	122069	122054	122054	Alice	350	" either from persons who are friends or who are not friends . "
122080	122104	122074	122074	she	350	" You must forgive me , Lady Midlothian , if I say that I can have no conversation with you on this matter . "
122158	122173	122175	122176	Lady Midlothian	350	" The most self - willed young woman I ever met in my life , "
122185	122195	122197	122198	Lady Glencora	488	" I knew very well how it would be , "
122200	122228	122197	122198	Lady Glencora	488	" But it is quite frightful , my dear . She has been engaged , with the consent of all her friends , to this young man . "
122229	122236	122175	122176	Lady Midlothian	350	" I know all about it . "
122237	122247	122197	122198	Lady Glencora	488	" But you must think she is very wrong . "
122248	122268	122197	122198	Lady Glencora	488	" I do n't quite understand her , but I suppose she fears they would not be happy together . "
122269	122350	122197	122198	Lady Glencora	488	" Understand her ! I should think not ; nobody can understand her . A young woman to become engaged to a gentleman in that way,—before all the world , as one may say;—to go to his house , as I am told , and talk to the servants , and give orders about the furniture and then turn round and simply say that she has changed her mind ! She has n't given the slightest reason to my knowledge . "
122427	122435	122437	122438	Lady Midlothian	350	" I shall not give it up , "
122440	122493	122437	122438	Lady Midlothian	350	" I have the greatest possible objection to her father , who contrived to connect himself with our family in a most shameful manner , without the slightest encouragement . I do n't think I have spoken to him since , but I shall see him now and tell him my opinion . "
122528	122535	122523	122523	she	350	" Good - bye to you , "
122545	122569	122536	122537	Lady Midlothian	350	" Even yet I hope that things may go right , and if so you will find that I can forget and forgive . "
122570	122576	122578	122579	Lady Glencora	488	" If perseverance merits success , "
122583	122589	122578	122579	Lady Glencora	488	" she ought to succeed . "
122590	122597	122599	122599	Alice	350	" But she wo n't succeed , "
122745	122754	122755	122756	Lady Glencora	488	" We are not going to be frightened , "
122759	122771	122755	122756	Lady Glencora	488	" People do not generally walk out at night in December , "
122776	122789	122791	122792	Lady Glencora	488	" That 's just the reason why we want to do it , "
122794	122829	122791	122792	Lady Glencora	488	" But we shall wrap ourselves up , and nobody need be afraid . Jeffrey , we shall expect you to stand sentinel at the old gate , and guard us from the ghosts . "
122980	123025	122972	122973	Lady Glencora	488	" No , indeed , Mr. Bott ; you were one of those who preached a sermon against my dissipation in the morning , and I 'm not going to allow you to join it , now the time for its enjoyment has come . "
123026	123042	123044	123046	the old lady	978	" My dear Lady Glencora , if I were you , indeed I would n't , "
123054	123069	123044	123046	the old lady	978	" My dear Mrs. Marsham , if you were me , indeed you would , "
123079	123089	123091	123092	Mr. Palliser	485	" I think it a foolish thing to do , "
123096	123109	123111	123112	Lady Glencora	488	" If you forbid it , of course we wo n't go , "
123114	123124	123111	123112	Lady Glencora	488	" Forbid it:—no ; I shall not forbid it . "
123125	123129	123131	123132	Lady Glencora	488	" Allons donc , "
123311	123318	123320	123321	Lady Glencora	488	" Let him say so plainly , "
123323	123377	123378	123379	Lady Glencora	488	" and I 'll give it up instantly . But I 'm not going to be lectured out of my purposes secondhand by Mr. Bott or old Mother Marsham . I understand all these people , my dear . And if you throw me over , Alice , I 'll never forgive you , "
123438	123443	123445	123446	Lady Glencora	488	" Now , Jeffrey , "
123459	123518	123445	123446	Lady Glencora	488	" when we get under the old gateway you must let me and Alice go round the dormitory and the chapel alone . Then we 'll come back by the cloisters , and we 'll take another turn outside with you . The outside is the finest by this light,—only I want to show Alice something by ourselves . "
123519	123535	123605	123605	she	337	" You 're not afraid , I know , and if Miss Vavasor is not — "
123536	123563	123445	123446	Lady Glencora	488	" Miss Vavasor,—who , I think , would have allowed you to call her by her other name on such an occasion as this,—is never afraid . "
123564	123573	123575	123575	Alice	337	" Glencora , how dare you say so ? "
123577	123587	123575	123575	Alice	337	" I really think we had better go back . "
123660	123664	123666	123666	Glencora	488	" Go back ! "
123668	123697	123698	123698	she	488	" No , indeed . We 'll go on , and leave him here . Then he can call nobody anything . Do n't be angry with me , "
123710	123727	123698	123698	she	488	" The truth is this;—if you choose to have him for your husband , you may . "
123728	123736	123666	123666	Glencora	488	" But if I do not choose . "
123737	123824	123698	123698	she	488	" Then there can be no harm done , and I will tell him so . But , Alice,—think of this . Whom will you meet that would suit you better ? And you need not decide now . You need not say a word , but leave me to tell him , that if it is to be thought of at all , it can not be thought of till he meets you in London . Trust me , you will be safe with me . "
123825	123835	123837	123837	Alice	337	" You shall tell him nothing of the kind , "
123839	123858	123837	123837	Alice	337	" I believe you to be joking throughout , and I think the joke is a bad one . "
123859	123932	123698	123698	she	488	" No ; there you wrong me . Indeed I am not joking . I know that in what I am saying I am telling you the simple truth . He has said enough to me to justify me in saying so . Alice , think of it all . It would reconcile me to much , and it would be something to be the mother of the future Duke of Omnium . "
123933	123941	123943	123943	Alice	337	" To me it would be nothing , "
123945	123980	123943	123943	Alice	337	" less than nothing . I mean to say that the temptation is one so easily resisted that it acts in the other way . Do n't say anything more about it , Glencora . "
123981	123993	123698	123698	she	488	" If you do n't wish it , I will not . "
123994	124037	123698	123698	she	488	" No;—I do not wish it . I do n't think I ever saw moonlight so bright as this . Look at the lines of that window against the light . They are clearer than you ever see them in the day . "
124299	124305	124307	124307	Glencora	488	" Is it not beautiful ! "
124309	124375	124376	124376	she	488	" I do love it so ! And there is a peculiar feeling of cold about the chill of the moon , different from any other cold . It makes you wrap yourself up tight , but it does not make your teeth chatter ; and it seems to go into your senses rather than into your bones . But I suppose that 's nonsense , "
124383	124397	124376	124376	she	488	" Not more so than what people are supposed to talk by moonlight . "
124398	124450	124376	124376	she	488	" That 's unkind . I 'd like what I say on such an occasion to be more poetical or else more nonsensical than what other people say under the same circumstances . And now I 'll tell you why I always think of you when I come here by moonlight . "
124451	124461	124376	124376	she	488	" But I suppose you do n't often come . "
124462	124585	124376	124376	she	488	" Yes , I do ; that is to say , I did come very often when we had the full moon in August . The weather was n't like this , and I used to run out through the open windows and nobody knew where I was gone . I made him come once , but he did n't seem to care about it . I told him that part of the refectory wall was falling ; so he looked at that , and had a mason sent the next day . If anything is out of order he has it put to rights at once . There would have been no ruins if all the Pallisers had been like him . "
124586	124595	124376	124376	she	488	" So much the better for the world . "
124596	124633	124376	124376	she	488	" No;—I say no . Things may live too long . But now I 'm going to tell you . Do you remember that night I brought you home from the play to Queen Anne Street ? "
124634	124640	124376	124376	she	488	" Indeed I do,—very well . "
124678	124689	124659	124659	she	337	" And do you remember how the moon shone then ? "
124690	124698	124376	124376	she	488	" Yes , I think I do . "
124699	124728	124376	124376	she	488	" I know I do . As we came round the corner out of Cavendish Square he was standing there,—and a friend of yours was standing with him . "
124729	124735	124659	124659	she	337	" What friend of mine ? "
124736	124747	124376	124376	she	488	" Never mind that ; it does not matter now . "
124748	124756	124376	124376	she	488	" Do you mean my cousin George ? "
124757	124817	124818	124818	She	3760	" Yes , I do mean your cousin ; and oh , Alice ! dear Alice ! I do n't know why I should love you , for if you had not been hardhearted that night,—stony cruel in your hard propriety , I should have gone with him then , and all this icy coldness would have been prevented . "
124845	124851	124853	124853	Alice	337	" You are very cold , "
124855	124862	124853	124853	Alice	337	" We had better go in . "
124863	124922	124818	124818	She	3760	" No , I am not cold,—not in that way . I wo n't go in yet . Jeffrey will come to us directly . Yes;—we should have escaped that night if you would have allowed him to come into your house . Ah , well ! we did n't , and there 's an end of it . "
124923	124931	124853	124853	Alice	337	" But Glencora,—you can not regret it . "
124932	125059	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Not regret it ! Alice , where can your heart be ? Or have you a heart ? Not regret it ! I would give everything I have in the world to have been true to him . They told me that he would spend my money . Though he should have spent every farthing of it , I regret it ; though he should have made me a beggar , I regret it . They told me that he would ill - use me , and desert me,—perhaps beat me . I do not believe it ; but even though that should have been so , I regret it . It is better to have a false husband than to be a false wife . "
125060	125088	124818	124818	She	3760	" Glencora , do not speak like that . Do not try to make me think that anything could tempt you to be false to your vows . "
125089	125147	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Tempt me to be false ! Why , child , it has been all false throughout . I never loved him . How can you talk in that way , when you know that I never loved him ? They browbeat me and frightened me till I did as I was told;—and now;—what am I now ? "
125148	125161	125163	125163	Alice	337	" You are his honest wife . Glencora , listen to me . "
125170	125173	125174	125174	she	337	" No , "
125177	125269	125174	125174	she	337	" no ; I am not honest . By law I am his wife ; but the laws are liars ! I am not his wife . I will not say the thing that I am . When I went to him at the altar , I knew that I did not love the man that was to be my husband . But him,—Burgo,—I love him with all my heart and soul . I could stoop at his feet and clean his shoes for him , and think it no disgrace ! "
125270	125299	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Oh , Cora , my friend , do not say such words as those ! Remember what you owe your husband and yourself , and come away . "
125300	125410	124853	124853	Alice	337	" I do know what I owe him , and I will pay it him . Alice , if I had a child I think I would be true to him . Think ! I know I would;—though I had no hour of happiness left to me in my life . But what now is the only honest thing that I can do ? Why , leave him;—so leave him that he may have another wife and be the father of a child . What injury shall I do him by leaving him ? He does not love me ; you know yourself that he does not love me . "
125411	125418	124853	124853	Alice	337	" I know that he does . "
125419	125539	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Alice , that is untrue . He does not ; and you have seen clearly that it is so . It may be that he can love no woman . But another woman would give him a son , and he would be happy . I tell you that every day and every night,—every hour of every day and of every night,—I am thinking of the man I love . I have nothing else to think of . I have no occupation,—no friends,—no one to whom I care to say a word . But I am always talking to Burgo in my thoughts ; and he listens to me . I dream that his arm is round me — "
125540	125545	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Oh , Glencora ! "
125546	125610	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Well!—Do you begrudge me that I should tell you the truth ? You have said that you would be my friend , and you must bear the burden of my friendship . And now,—this is what I want to tell you.—Immediately after Christmas , we are to go to Monkshade , and he will be there . Lady Monk is his aunt . "
125611	125624	124853	124853	Alice	337	" You must not go . No power should take you there . "
125625	125689	124853	124853	Alice	337	" That is easily said , child ; but all the same I must go . I told Mr. Palliser that he would be there , and he said it did not signify . He actually said that it did not signify . I wonder whether he understands what it is for people to love each other;—whether he has ever thought about it . "
125690	125702	124853	124853	Alice	337	" You must tell him plainly that you will not go . "
125703	125838	124853	124853	Alice	337	" I did . I told him plainly as words could tell him . ' Glencora , ' he said,—and you know the way he looks when he means to be lord and master , and put on the very husband indeed,—'This is an annoyance which you must bear and overcome . It suits me that we should go to Monkshade , and it does not suit me that there should be any one whom you are afraid to meet . ' Could I tell him that he would lose his wife if I did go ? Could I threaten him that I would throw myself into Burgo 's arms if that opportunity were given to me ? You are very wise , and very prudent . What would you have had me say ? "
125839	125856	124853	124853	Alice	337	" I would have you now tell him everything , rather than go to that house . "
125857	126000	124853	124853	Alice	337	" Alice , look here . I know what I am , and what I am like to become . I loathe myself , and I loathe the thing that I am thinking of . I could have clung to the outside of a man 's body , to his very trappings , and loved him ten times better than myself!—ay , even though he had ill - treated me,—if I had been allowed to choose a husband for myself . Burgo would have spent my money,—all that it would have been possible for me to give him . But there would have been something left , and I think that by that time I could have won even him to care for me . But with that man — ! Alice you are very wise . What am I to do ? "
126113	126118	126119	126119	she	337	" Here 's Jeffrey ! "
126122	126132	126119	126119	she	337	" What an unconscionable time we have kept him ! "
126133	126139	126140	126140	he	1119	" Do n't mention it , "
126143	126167	126140	126140	he	1119	" And I should n't have come to you now , only that I thought I should find you both freezing into marble . "
126168	126183	126185	126186	Lady Glencora	488	" We are not such cold - blooded creatures as that,—are we , Alice ? "
126188	126221	126185	126186	Lady Glencora	488	" And now we 'll go round the outside ; only we must not stay long , or we shall frighten those two delicious old duennas , Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott . "
126391	126398	126399	126399	he	485	" You must be very cold , "
126408	126413	126415	126415	Glencora;—but	553	" No , indeed , "
126432	126435	126437	126438	Mr. Palliser	485	" Jeffrey , "
126445	126471	126437	126438	Mr. Palliser	485	" I am angry with you . You , at least , should have known better than to have allowed her to remain so long . "
126679	126688	126690	126691	Jeffrey Palliser	485	" He is provoked with us , now , "
126712	126723	126706	126706	he	485	" He is afraid that she will have caught cold . "
126724	126759	126706	126706	he	485	" Yes ; and he thinks it wrong that she should remain out at night so long . You can easily understand , Miss Vavasor , that he has not much sympathy for romance . "
126760	126768	126770	126770	Alice	337	" I dare say he is right , "
126801	126810	126792	126793	Jeffrey Palliser	485	" Romance usually means nonsense , I believe . "
126811	126819	126706	126706	he	485	" That is not Glencora 's doctrine . "
126820	126851	126792	126793	Jeffrey Palliser	485	" No ; but she is younger than I am . My feet are very cold , Mr. Palliser , and I think I will go up to my room . "
126852	126856	126858	126858	Jeffrey	485	" Good night , "
126865	126879	126858	126858	Jeffrey	485	" I think it so hard that you should have incurred his displeasure . "
126880	126887	126889	126889	Alice	337	" It will not hurt me , "
126893	126900	126889	126889	Alice	337	" No;—but he does not forget . "
126901	126915	126858	126858	Jeffrey	485	" Even that will not hurt me . Good night , Mr. Palliser . "
126916	126944	126945	126945	He	485	" As it is the last night , may I say good night , Alice ? I shall be away to - morrow before you are up . "
126981	126984	126986	126986	she	337	" No , "
126988	127020	126986	126986	she	337	" Glencora was very wrong there,—doing an injury without meaning it to both of us . There can be no possible reason why you should call me otherwise than is customary . "
127021	127029	126945	126945	He	485	" Can there never be a reason ? "
127030	127054	126986	126986	she	337	" No , Mr. Palliser . Good night;—and if I am not to see you to - morrow morning , good - bye . "
127055	127067	126986	126986	she	337	" You will certainly not see me to - morrow morning . "
127068	127092	126945	126945	He	485	" Good - bye . Had it not been for this folly of Glencora 's , our acquaintance would have been very pleasant . "
127093	127105	126986	126986	she	337	" To me it has been very pleasant . Good night . "
127587	127592	127593	127593	Glencora	488	" I loathe myself , "
127597	127607	127593	127593	Glencora	488	" and the thing that I am thinking of . "
127932	127936	127937	127937	she	337	" Miss Vavasor , "
127940	127972	127937	127937	she	337	" I know that I am taking a great liberty , but may I come into your room for a few minutes ? I so much wish to speak to you ! "
128182	128190	128197	128197	she	519	" I know that I am intruding , "
128204	128210	128212	128212	Alice	337	" Oh dear , no , "
128214	128228	128212	128212	Alice	337	" If I can do anything for you I shall be very happy . "
128229	128280	128197	128197	she	519	" You are going to - morrow , and if I did not speak to you now I should have no other opportunity . Glencora seems to be very much attached to you , and we all thought it so good a thing that she should have such a friend . "
128281	128292	128294	128294	Alice	337	" I hope you have not all changed your minds , "
128307	128309	128197	128197	she	519	" all "
128323	128353	128303	128303	she	337	" Oh , no;—by no means . I did not mean that . My cousin , Mr. Palliser , I mean , liked you so much when you came . "
128354	128382	128197	128197	she	519	" And he does not like me quite so much now , because I went out in the moonlight with his wife . Is n't that it ? "
128383	128435	128197	128197	she	519	" Well;—no , Miss Vavasor . I had not intended to mention that at all . I had not indeed . I have seen him certainly since you came in,—just for a minute , and he is vexed . But it is not about that that I would speak to you . "
128436	128448	128303	128303	she	337	" I saw plainly enough that he was angry with me . "
128449	128460	128197	128197	she	519	" He thought you would have brought her in earlier . "
128461	128497	128197	128197	she	519	" And why should he think that I can manage his wife ? She was the mistress out there as she is in here . Mr. Palliser has been unreasonable . Not that it signifies . "
128498	128539	128303	128303	she	337	" I do n't think he has been unreasonable ; I do n't , indeed , Miss Vavasor . He has certainly been vexed . Sometimes he has much to vex him . You see , Glencora is very young . "
128592	128604	128605	128605	Alice	337	" She is not younger than when Mr. Palliser married her , "
128608	128661	128605	128605	Alice	337	" You mean that if a man marries a young wife he must put up with the trouble . That is a matter of course . But their ages , in truth , are very suitable . My cousin himself is not yet thirty . When I say that Glencora is young — "
128662	128685	128581	128581	Alice	337	" You mean that she is younger in spirit , and perhaps in conduct , than he had expected to find her . "
128686	128708	128605	128605	Alice	337	" But you are not to suppose that he complains , Miss Vavasor . He is much too proud for that . "
128709	128715	128717	128717	Alice	337	" I should hope so , "
128724	128779	128721	128722	Mr. Bott	532	" I hardly know how to explain to you what I wish to say , or how far I may be justified in supposing that you will believe me to be acting solely on Glencora 's behalf . I think you have some influence with her;—and I know no one else that has any . "
128780	128795	128605	128605	Alice	337	" My friendship with her is not of very long date , Miss Palliser . "
128796	128815	128605	128605	Alice	337	" I know it , but still there is the fact . Am I not right in supposing — "
128816	128821	128721	128722	Mr. Bott	532	" In supposing what ? "
128822	128846	128847	128847	Alice	337	" In supposing that you had heard the name of Mr. Fitzgerald as connected with Glencora 's before her marriage with my cousin ? "
128855	128861	128862	128862	she	337	" Yes , I had , "
128866	128889	128862	128862	she	337	" And I think you were agreed , with her other relations , that such a marriage would have been very dreadful . "
128890	128946	128721	128722	Mr. Bott	532	" I never spoke of the matter in the presence of any relatives of Glencora 's . You must understand , Miss Palliser , that though I am her far - away cousin , I do not even know her nearest connections . I never saw Lady Midlothian till she came here the other day . "
128947	128957	128862	128862	she	337	" But you advised her to abandon Mr. Fitzgerald . "
128958	128961	128862	128862	she	337	" Never ! "
128962	128976	128721	128722	Mr. Bott	532	" I know she was much with you , just at that time . "
128977	128986	128862	128862	she	337	" I used to see her , certainly . "
129082	129091	129093	129093	Alice	337	" Just then she was often with me , "
129099	129149	129093	129093	Alice	337	" and there was much talk between us about Mr. Fitzgerald . What was my advice then can be of little matter ; but in this we shall be both agreed , Miss Palliser , that Glencora now should certainly not be called upon to be in his company . "
129150	129158	129059	129059	she	337	" She has told you , then ? "
129159	129165	129059	129059	she	337	" Yes;—she has told me . "
129166	129177	129093	129093	Alice	337	" That he is to be at Lady Monk 's ? "
129178	129222	129059	129059	she	337	" She has told me that Mr. Palliser expects her to meet him at the place to which they are going when they leave the Duke 's , and that she thinks it hard that she should be subjected to such a trial . "
129223	129233	129059	129059	she	337	" It should be no trial , Miss Vavasor . "
129234	129257	129093	129093	Alice	337	" How can it be otherwise ? Come , Miss Palliser ; if you are her friend , be fair to her . "
129258	129368	129059	129059	she	337	" I am her friend;—but I am , above everything , my cousin 's friend . He has told me that she has complained of having to meet this man . He declares that it should be nothing to her , and that the fear is an idle folly . It should be nothing to her , but still the fear may not be idle . Is there any reason,—any real reason,—why she should not go ? Miss Vavasor , I conjure you to tell me,—even though in doing so you must cast so deep reproach upon her name ! Anything will be better than utter disgrace and sin ! "
129369	129394	129059	129059	she	337	" I conceive that I cast no reproach upon her in saying that there is great reason why she should not go to Monkshade . "
129395	129421	129093	129093	Alice	337	" You think there is absolute grounds for interference ? I must tell him , you know , openly what he would have to fear . "
129422	129455	129059	129059	she	337	" I think,—nay , Miss Palliser , I know,—that there is ample reason why you should save her from being taken to Monkshade , if you have the power to do so . "
129456	129478	129059	129059	she	337	" I can only do it , or attempt to do it , by telling him just what you tell me . "
129479	129500	129093	129093	Alice	337	" Then tell him . You must have thought of that , I suppose , before you came to me . "
129501	129550	129059	129059	she	337	" Yes;—yes , Miss Vavasor . I had thought of it . No doubt I had thought of it . But I had believed all through that you would assure me that there was no danger . I believed that you would have said that she was innocent . "
129551	129557	129559	129559	Alice	337	" And she is innocent , "
129585	129605	129568	129568	she	337	" She is innocent . Who accuses her of guilt ? You ask me a question on his behalf — "
129606	129617	129059	129059	she	337	" On hers — and on his , Miss Vavasor . "
129618	129698	129059	129059	she	337	" A question which I feel myself bound to answer truly,—to answer with reference to the welfare of them both ; but I will not have it said that I accuse her . She had been attached to Mr. Fitzgerald when your cousin married her . He knew that this had been the case . She told him the whole truth . In a worldly point of view her marriage with Mr. Fitzgerald would probably have been very imprudent . "
129699	129707	129059	129059	she	337	" It would have been utterly ruinous . "
129708	129735	129059	129059	she	337	" Perhaps so ; I say nothing about that . But as it turned out , she gave up her own wishes and married your cousin . "
129736	129749	129059	129059	she	337	" I do n't know about her own wishes , Miss Vavasor . "
129750	129802	129059	129059	she	337	" It is what she did . She would have married Mr. Fitzgerald , had she not been hindered by the advice of those around her . It can not be supposed that she has forgotten him in so short a time . There can be no guilt in her remembrance . "
129803	129815	129059	129059	she	337	" There is guilt in loving any other than her husband . "
129816	129876	129059	129059	she	337	" Then , Miss Palliser , it was her marriage that was guilty , and not her love . But all that is done and past . It should be your cousin 's object to teach her to forget Mr. Fitzgerald , and he will not do that by taking her to a house where that gentleman is staying . "
129877	129887	129059	129059	she	337	" She has said so much to you herself ? "
129888	129944	129059	129059	she	337	" I do not know that I need declare to you what she has said herself . You have asked me a question , and I have answered it , and I am thankful to you for having asked it . What object can either of us have but to assist her in her position ? "
129945	129968	129059	129059	she	337	" And to save him from dishonour . I had so hoped that this was simply a childish dread on her part . "
129969	130017	129059	129059	she	337	" It is not so . It is no childish dread . If you have the power to prevent her going to Lady Monk 's , I implore you to use it . Indeed , I will ask you to promise me that you will do so . "
130018	130030	129059	129059	she	337	" After what you have said , I have no alternative . "
130031	130051	129059	129059	she	337	" Exactly . There is no alternative . Either for his sake or for hers , there is none . "
130255	130268	130269	130269	he	485	" The carriage is ordered for you at a quarter before ten , "
130272	130284	130269	130269	he	485	" and I have come down to give you your breakfast . "
130308	130319	130321	130321	she	337	" Will you allow me to give you yours instead ? "
130346	130358	130360	130361	Mr. Palliser	485	" Glencora bids me say that she will be down immediately , "
130471	130479	130481	130481	he	532	" The frost was so uncommonly severe , "
130483	130500	130481	130481	he	532	" that any delicate person like Lady Glencora must have suffered in remaining out so long . "
130584	130595	130597	130597	Alice	337	" I hope you do not consider Lady Glencora delicate , "
130602	130608	130610	130611	the husband	3493	" She is not robust , "
130613	130618	130620	130621	Mrs. Marsham	548	" By no means , "
130623	130628	130630	130631	Mr. Bott	532	" Indeed , no , "
130702	130715	130717	130718	Iphigenia Palliser	534	" I think she is as strong as the rest of us , "
130733	130739	130741	130742	Mr. Bott	532	" As some of us , "
130785	130794	130795	130795	she	488	" The last morning has come , then , "
130798	130803	130805	130805	Alice	337	" Yes , indeed , "
130807	130819	130805	130805	Alice	337	" Mr. Palliser must have thought that I was never going . "
130820	130826	130828	130828	he	532	" On the other hand , "
130830	130841	130828	130828	he	532	" I have felt much obliged to you for staying . "
130861	130864	130866	130867	Lady Glencora	488	" Obliged ! "
130869	130895	130866	130867	Lady Glencora	488	" I ca n't tell you how much obliged I am . Oh , Alice , I wish you were going to stay with us ! "
130896	130907	130909	130910	Mr. Palliser	485	" We are leaving this in a week 's time , "
130912	130918	130920	130921	Lady Glencora	488	" Of course we are , "
130923	130950	130920	130921	Lady Glencora	488	" With all my heart I wish we were not . Dear Alice ! I suppose we shall not meet till we are all in town . "
130951	130962	130964	130964	Alice	337	" You will let me know when you come up , "
130966	130988	130989	130989	Alice	337	" I will send to you instantly ; and , Alice , I will write to you from Gatherum,—or from Monkshade . "
131072	131082	131083	131083	he	485	" Do n't come to the door , Glencora , "
131086	131096	131083	131083	he	485	" I especially wish you not to do so . "
131113	131121	131123	131124	Mr. Palliser	485	" Good - bye , Miss Vavasor , "
131915	131921	131922	131922	Burgo	427	" I believe she would , "
131934	131979	131926	131926	he	427	" It 's a thing of that sort that a man can only believe,—perhaps only hope,—till he has tried . I know that she is not happy with him , and I have made up my mind that I will at least ask her . "
131980	131991	131926	131926	he	427	" But he would have her fortune all the same ? "
131992	132062	131926	131926	he	427	" I do n't know how that would be . I have n't inquired , and I do n't mean to inquire . Of course I do n't expect you or any one else to believe me , but her money has no bearing on the question now . Heaven knows I want money bad enough , but I would n't take away another man 's wife for money . "
132063	132086	131926	131926	he	427	" You do n't mean to say you think it would be wicked . I supposed you to be above those prejudices . "
132087	132098	131926	131926	he	427	" It 's all very well for you to chaff . "
132099	132156	131926	131926	he	427	" It 's no chaff at all . I tell you fairly I would n't run away with any man 's wife . I have an old - fashioned idea that when a man has got a wife he ought to be allowed to keep her . Public opinion , I know , is against me . "
132157	132167	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" I think he ran away with my wife , "
132174	132204	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" that 's the way I look at it . She was engaged to me first ; and she really loved me , while she never cared for him . "
132205	132243	131926	131926	he	427	" Nevertheless , marriage is marriage , and the law is against you . But if I did go in for such a troublesome job at all , I certainly should keep an eye upon the money . "
132244	132251	131926	131926	he	427	" It can make no difference . "
132252	132270	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" It did make a difference , I suppose , when you first thought of marrying her ? "
132271	132363	131926	131926	he	427	" Of course it did . My people brought us together because she had a large fortune and I had none . There 's no doubt in the world about that . And I 'll tell you what ; I believe that old harridan of an aunt of mine is willing to do the same thing now again . Of course she does n't say as much . She would n't dare do that , but I do believe she means it . I wonder where she expects to go to ! "
132364	132372	131926	131926	he	427	" That 's grateful on your part . "
132373	132428	131926	131926	he	427	" Upon my soul I hate her . I do indeed . It is n't love for me now so much as downright malice against Palliser , because he baulked her project before . She is a wicked old woman . Some of us fellows are wicked enough — you and I for instance — "
132429	132452	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" Thank you . I do n't know , however , that I am qualified to run in a curricle with you . "
132453	132486	131926	131926	he	427	" But we are angels to such an old she - devil as that . You may believe me or not , as you like.—I dare say you wo n't believe me . "
132487	132498	131926	131926	he	427	" I 'll say I do , at any rate . "
132499	132530	131926	131926	he	427	" The truth is , I want to get her , partly because I love her ; but chiefly because I do believe in my heart that she loves me . "
132531	132552	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" It 's for her sake then ! You are ready to sacrifice yourself to do her a good turn . "
132553	132619	131926	131926	he	427	" As for sacrificing myself , that 's done . I 'm a man utterly ruined and would cut my throat to - morrow for the sake of my relations , if I cared enough about them . I know my own condition pretty well . I have made a shipwreck of everything , and have now only got to go down among the breakers . "
132620	132632	131926	131926	he	427	" Only you would like to take Lady Glencora with you . "
132633	132678	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" No , by heavens ! But sometimes , when I do think about it at all,—which I do as seldom as I can,—it seems to me that I might still become a different fellow if it were possible for me to marry her . "
132679	132706	131926	131926	he	427	" Had you married her when she was free to marry any one and when her money was her own , it might have been so . "
132707	132761	131926	131926	he	427	" I think it would be quite as much so now . I do , indeed . If I could get her once , say to Italy , or perhaps to Greece , I think I could treat her well , and live with her quietly . I know that I would try . "
132762	132771	132169	132169	Burgo	427	" Without the assistance of brandy and cigars . "
132772	132775	131926	131926	he	427	" Yes . "
132776	132782	131926	131926	he	427	" And without any money . "
132783	132838	131926	131926	he	427	" With only a little . I know you 'll laugh at me ; but I make pictures to myself of a sort of life which I think would suit us , and be very different from this hideous way of living , with which I have become so sick that I loathe it . "
132839	132857	131926	131926	he	427	" Something like Juan and Haidée , with Planty Pall coming after you , like old Lambro . "
132875	132918	131926	131926	he	427	" He 'd get a divorce , of course , and then we should be married . I really do n't think he 'd dislike it , when it was all done . They tell me he does n't care for her . "
132919	132928	131926	131926	he	427	" You have seen her since her marriage ? "
132929	132934	131926	131926	he	427	" Yes ; twice . "
132935	132942	131926	131926	he	427	" And have spoken to her ? "
132943	132974	131926	131926	he	427	" Once only,—so as to be able to do more than ask her if she were well . Once , for about two minutes , I did speak to her . "
132975	132982	131926	131926	he	427	" And what did she say ? "
132983	133039	131926	131926	he	427	" She said it would be better that we should not meet . When she said that , I knew that she was still fond of me . I could have fallen at her feet that moment , only the room was full of people . I do think that she is fond of me . "
133046	133056	133057	133057	he	561	" I dare say she is fond of you , "
133061	133101	133057	133057	he	561	" but whether she has pluck for such a thing as this , is more than I can say . Probably she has not . And if she has , probably you would fail in carrying out your plan . "
133102	133111	133113	133113	Burgo	427	" I must get a little money first , "
133115	133136	133057	133057	he	561	" And that 's an operation which no doubt you find more difficult every day , as you grow older . "
133137	133156	133057	133057	he	561	" It seems to be much the same sort of thing . I went to Magruin this morning . "
133157	133171	133057	133057	he	561	" He 's the fellow that lives out near Gray 's Inn Lane ? "
133172	133212	133057	133057	he	561	" Just beyond the Foundling Hospital . I went to him , and he was quite civil about it . He says I owe him over three thousand pounds , but that does n't seem to make any difference . "
133213	133223	133057	133057	he	561	" How much did you ever have from him ? "
133224	133285	133057	133057	he	561	" I do n't recollect that I ever absolutely had any money . He got a bill of mine from a tailor who went to smash , and he kept on renewing that till it grew to be ever so many bills . I think he did once let me have twenty - four pounds,—but certainly never more than that . "
133286	133307	133057	133057	he	561	" And he says he 'll give you money now ? I suppose you told him why you wanted it . "
133308	133372	133057	133057	he	561	" I did n't name her,—but I told him what would make him understand that I hoped to get off with a lady who had a lot of tin . I asked him for two hundred and fifty . He says he 'll let me have one hundred and fifty on a bill at two months for five hundred,—with your name to it . "
133373	133390	133057	133057	he	561	" With my name to it ! That 's kind on his part,—and on yours too . "
133391	133407	133057	133057	he	561	" Of course I ca n't take it up at the end of two months . "
133408	133414	133416	133416	Vavasor	561	" I dare say not , "
133418	133444	133416	133416	Vavasor	561	" But he wo n't come upon you then,—nor for a year or more afterwards . I did pay you what you lent me before . "
133445	133464	133057	133057	he	561	" Yes , you did . I always thought that to be a special compliment on your part . "
133465	133509	133416	133416	Vavasor	561	" And you 'll find I 'll pull you through now in some way . If I do n't succeed in this I shall go off the hooks altogether soon ; and if I were dead my people would pay my debts then . "
133644	133653	133655	133655	Burgo	427	" I thought you would , old fellow , "
133665	133702	133655	133655	Burgo	427	" Perhaps , you know , I shall pull through in this ; and perhaps , after all , some part of her fortune will come with her . If so you 'll be all right . "
133703	133730	133800	133801	Burgo Fitzgerald	427	" Perhaps I may . But look here , Burgo,—don't you give that fellow up the bill till you 've got the money into your fist . "
133731	133798	133800	133801	Burgo Fitzgerald	427	" You may be quite easy about that . I know their tricks . He and I will go to the bank together , and we shall squabble there at the door about four or five odd sovereigns,—and at last I shall have to give him up two or three . Beastly old robber ! I declare I think he 's worse than I am myself . "
135455	135461	135462	135462	she	3947	" For love of God , "
135465	135486	135462	135462	she	3947	" if it 's only a penny to get a glass of gin ! Feel my hand,—how cold it is . "
135588	135593	135595	135595	he	427	" You are cold ! "
135604	135607	135609	135609	she	3947	" Cold ! "
135627	135658	135626	135626	she	3947	shivered—"Oh God ! if you knew what it was to be as cold as I am ! I have nothing in the world,—not one penny,—not a hole to lie in ! "
135659	135665	135667	135667	Burgo	427	" We are alike then , "
135675	135690	135667	135667	Burgo	427	" I also have nothing . You can not be poorer than I am . "
135691	135695	135696	135696	she	3947	" You poor ! "
135708	135723	135701	135701	she	3947	" Gracious ; how beautiful you are ! Such as you are never poor . "
135743	135755	135756	135756	he	427	" I am a deal poorer than you , my girl , "
135759	135786	135756	135756	he	427	" You have nothing . I have thirty thousand pounds worse than nothing . But come along , and I will get you something to eat . "
135787	135791	135793	135793	she	3947	" Will you ? "
135805	135812	135804	135804	she	3947	exclaimed—"Oh , you are so handsome ! "
135998	136002	136004	136004	he	427	" And now , "
136006	136026	136004	136004	he	427	" what must I do with you ? If I give you a shilling can you get a bed ? "
136039	136049	136051	136051	he	427	" Then keep the other sixpence for your breakfast , "
136053	136069	136051	136051	he	427	" But you must promise me that you will buy no gin to - night . "
136114	136124	136125	136125	she	922	" I wish I might once see you again , "
136128	136138	136125	136125	she	922	" because you are so good and so beautiful . "
136196	136203	136193	136193	herself	922	again—"Gracious , how beautiful he was ! "
136204	136211	136212	136218	the woman at the public - house	3961	" He 's a good un , "
136228	136247	136212	136218	the woman at the public - house	3961	" but , my ! did you ever see a man 's face handsome as that fellow 's ? "
136512	136519	136491	136491	she	337	" He is a desperate spendthrift , "
136527	136537	136520	136521	Kate Vavasor	356	" Then let her teach him to be otherwise , "
136542	136580	136520	136521	Kate Vavasor	356	" That might have been a good reason for refusing his offer when he first made it ; but it can be no excuse for untruth , now that she has told him that she loves him ! "
136581	136586	136587	136587	she	337	" If a woman , "
136592	136611	136587	136587	she	337	" wo n't venture her fortune for the man she loves , her love is not worth having . "
136794	136804	136805	136805	he	561	" It is a thing terrible to think of , "
136819	136896	136805	136805	he	561	" that a man should give permission to a priest to tie him to another human being like a Siamese twin , so that all power of separate and solitary action should be taken from him for ever ! The beasts of the field do not treat each other so badly . They neither drink themselves drunk , nor eat themselves stupid;—nor do they bind themselves together in a union which both would have to hate . "
137521	137532	137533	137533	he	561	" I need n't send it when it 's written , "
137538	137548	137533	137533	he	561	" and the chances are that I wo n't . "
139012	139024	139025	139025	he	0	" I 'll bet two to one that she gives way , "
139042	139053	139025	139025	he	0	" Women are such out - and - out fools . "
139103	139106	139107	139107	he	1249	" Jem , "
139113	139127	139107	139107	he	1249	" there 's half a crown lying there on the looking - glass . "
139140	139151	139153	139154	the boy	2489	" Is it a head or a tail , Jem ? "
139173	139182	139184	139185	George Vavasor	561	" Then take that letter and post it , "
139274	139284	139272	139272	Burgo	427	" This will be brought to you by Stickling , "
139298	139361	139362	139362	Vavasor	561	" I send the bill . Could n't you get the money and send it me , as I do n't want to go up to town again before the thing comes off ? You 're a trump ; and will do the best you can . Do n't let that rogue off for less than a hundred and twenty.—Yours , B. F. "
139382	139388	139390	139390	Magruin	562	" Oh , Mr. Vavasor , "
139392	139401	139390	139390	Magruin	562	" really this is no morning for business ! "
139402	139424	139362	139362	Vavasor	561	" Time and tide wait for no man , Mr. Magruin , and my friend wants his money to - morrow . "
139425	139433	139390	139390	Magruin	562	" Oh , Mr. Vavasor,—to - morrow ! "
139434	139474	139390	139390	Magruin	562	" Yes , to - morrow . If time and tide wo n't wait , neither will love . Come , Mr. Magruin , out with your cheque - book , and do n't let 's have any nonsense . "
139475	139485	139487	139488	Mr. Magruin	562	" But is the lady sure , Mr. Vavasor ? "
139492	139498	139500	139500	Vavasor	357	" Ladies never are sure , "
139502	139534	139500	139500	Vavasor	357	" hardly more sure than bills made over to money - lenders . I 'm not going to wait here all day . Are you going to give him the money ? "
139535	139555	139500	139500	Vavasor	357	" Christmas - day , Mr. Vavasor ! There 's no getting money in the city to - day . "
139588	139596	139598	139599	Mr. Magruin	562	" Do tell him to be punctual , "
139607	139636	139598	139599	Mr. Magruin	562	" I do so like young men to be punctual . But I really think Mr. Fitzgerald is the most unpunctual young man I ever did know yet . "
139637	139643	139645	139646	George Vavasor	357	" I think he is , "
139865	139879	139881	139882	the Squire	1192	" Why did n't your aunt come here to eat her Christmas dinner ? "
139884	139896	139898	139898	Kate	356	" Perhaps , sir , because you did n't ask her , "
139912	139934	139905	139907	the old man	1427	" And why did n't you ask her;—that is , if she stands upon asking to come to her old home ? "
139935	139961	139881	139882	the Squire	1192	" Nay , sir , but I could n't do that without your bidding . We Vavasors are not always fond of meeting each other . "
139962	140034	139905	139907	the old man	1427	" Hold your tongue , Kate . I know what you mean , and you should be the last to speak of it . Alice , my dear , come and sit next to me . I am much obliged to you for coming down all this way to see your old grandfather at Christmas . I am indeed . I only wish you had brought better news about your sweetheart . "
140035	140047	140049	140050	her father	805	" She 'll think better of it before long , sir , "
140052	140073	140049	140050	her father	805	" Papa , you should n't say that . You would not wish me to marry against my own judgement . "
140074	140085	140087	140089	the old man	1427	" I do n't know much about ladies ' judgements , "
140091	140110	140087	140089	the old man	1427	" It does seem to me that when a lady makes a promise she ought to keep it . "
140111	140116	140118	140118	Kate	356	" According to that , "
140120	140144	140118	140118	Kate	356	" if I were engaged to a man , and found that he was a murderer , I still ought to marry him . "
140145	140154	140156	140157	the Squire	1192	" But Mr. Grey is not a murderer , "
140159	140168	140170	140170	Alice	337	" Pray,—pray , do n't talk about it , "
140172	140185	140170	140170	Alice	337	" If you do I really can not sit and hear it . "
140186	140197	140205	140205	he	338	" I have given over saying anything on the subject , "
141311	141317	141319	141321	the old man	1427	" Alice , my dear , "
141334	141341	141319	141321	the old man	1427	" you ought to get married . "
141422	141427	141428	141428	he	1427	" My dear child , "
141431	141449	141428	141428	he	1427	" I have been thinking a great deal about you , and you ought to get married . "
141450	141461	141402	141402	he	1427	" Well , sir , perhaps I shall some day . "
141462	141472	141474	141476	the old man	1427	" Not if you quarrel with all your suitors , "
141478	141512	141474	141476	the old man	1427	" You quarrelled with your cousin George , and now you have quarrelled with Mr. Grey . You 'll never get married , my dear , if you go on in that way . "
141513	141523	141402	141402	he	1427	" Why should I be married more than Kate ? "
141524	141579	141580	141582	The two girls	1292	" Oh , Kate ! I do n't know that anybody wants to marry Kate . I wish you 'd think of what I say . If you do n't get married before long , perhaps you 'll never get married at all . Gentlemen wo n't stand that kind of thing for ever . "
141599	141611	141613	141613	Kate	356	" We sha n't be able to get to the lake , "
141615	141618	141620	141620	Alice	337	" No , "
141622	141646	141620	141620	Alice	337	" but we can go as far as the big stone on Swindale Fell , where we can sit down and see it . "
141647	141658	141660	141660	Kate	356	" Do you remember the last time we sat there ? "
141662	141742	141660	141660	Kate	356	" It is nearly three years ago , and it was then that you told me that all was to be over between you and George . Do you remember what a fool I was , and how I screamed in my sorrow ? I sometimes wonder at myself and my own folly . How is it that I can never get up any interest about my own belongings ? And then we got soaking wet through coming home . "
141743	141750	141620	141620	Alice	337	" I remember that very well . "
141751	141817	141660	141660	Kate	356	" And how dark it was ! That was in September , but we had dined early . If we go as far as Swindale we shall have it very dark coming home to - day;—but I do n't mind that through the Beacon Wood , because I know my way so well . You wo n't be afraid of half an hour 's dark ? "
141818	141823	141825	141825	Alice	337	" Oh , no , "
141827	141859	141825	141825	Alice	337	" Yes ; I do remember that day . Well ; it 's all for the best , I suppose . And now I must read you my aunt 's letter . "
141955	141965	141967	141967	Kate	356	" You must understand all the time , Alice , "
141976	142033	141967	141967	Kate	356	" that the dear man has never given me the slightest ground for the faintest hope , and that I know to a certainty that he makes an offer to her twice a week,—that is , on every market day . You ca n't enjoy half the joke if you wo n't bear that in mind . "
142108	142117	142119	142119	Kate	356	" These are not market days at Norwich , "
142121	142129	142119	142119	Kate	356	" and thus unpleasant meetings are avoided . "
142130	142135	142137	142138	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He comes in , "
142140	142159	142137	142138	Mrs. Greenow	405	" and takes a little tea ; and sometimes I think that he will faint at my feet . "
142160	142169	142171	142171	Kate	356	" That he kneels there on every occasion , "
142173	142193	142171	142171	Kate	356	" and repeats his offer also twice a week , I have not the least doubt in the world . "
142194	142203	142137	142138	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And will she accept him at last ? "
142204	142292	142171	142171	Kate	356	" Really I do n't know what to think of it . Sometimes I fancy that she likes the fun of the thing , but that she is too wide - awake to put herself in any man 's power . I have no doubt she lends him money , because he wants it sadly and she is very generous . She gives him money , I feel sure , but takes his receipt on stamped paper for every shilling . That 's her character all over . "
142335	142345	142321	142321	she	2921	" Come and have one other look at Oileymead , "
142350	142391	142321	142321	she	2921	" and then , if you make up your mind that you do n't like it or him , I wo n't ask you to think of them ever again . I believe him to be a very honest fellow . "
142392	142401	142403	142403	Kate	356	" Did you ever know such a woman ? "
142405	142435	142403	142403	Kate	356	" with all her faults I believe she would go through fire and water to serve me . I think she 'd lend me money without any stamped paper . "
143377	143386	143387	143387	she	337	" At any rate he does me justice , "
143412	143440	143387	143387	she	337	" He is welcome to it all if it will help him in his career , whether he has it as my friend or as my husband . "
143650	143657	143659	143659	Kate	356	" There 's Helvellyn at last , "
143661	143671	143659	143659	Kate	356	" I 'm always happy when I see that . "
143672	143680	143682	143682	Alice	337	" And is n't that Kidsty Pike ? "
143684	143729	143682	143682	Alice	337	" No ; you do n't see Kidsty yet . But you will when you get up to the bank there . That 's Scaw Fell on the left;—the round distant top . I can distinguish it , though I doubt whether you can . "
143757	143776	143659	143659	Kate	356	" And now we are on Swindale , and in five minutes we shall get to the stone . "
144082	144092	144094	144094	Alice	337	" I 'm so glad I 've come here , "
144099	144119	144094	144094	Alice	337	" I can not bear the idea of coming to Vavasor without seeing one of the lakes at least . "
144120	144130	144132	144132	Kate	356	" We 'll get over to Windermere one day , "
144134	144165	144174	144174	her	356	" I do n't think we shall . I do n't think it possible that I should stay long . Kate , I 've got a letter to show you . "
144198	144205	144206	144206	she	356	" Is it from Mr. Grey ? "
144209	144212	144214	144214	Alice	337	" No , "
144216	144224	144214	144214	Alice	337	" it is not from Mr. Grey . "
144261	144267	144268	144268	Kate	356	" Has he offended you ? "
144271	144275	144277	144277	Alice	337	" Read it , "
144279	144292	144277	144277	Alice	337	" and then we 'll talk of it afterwards,—as we go home . "
144328	144331	144332	144332	she	337	" Well ! "
144342	144345	144347	144347	Kate	356	" Well , "
144349	144394	144347	144347	Kate	356	" Alice , Alice , it will , indeed , be well if you listen to him . Oh , Alice , may I hope ? Alice , my own Alice , my darling , my friend ! Say that it shall be so . "
144462	144465	144467	144467	Kate	356	" Alice , "
144469	144549	144467	144467	Kate	356	" I did not think I should be made so happy this Christmas Day . You could not have the heart to bring me here and show me this letter in this way , and bid me read it so calmly , and then tell me that it is all for nothing . No ; you could not do that ? Alice , I am so happy . I will so love this place . I hated it before . "
144612	144710	144606	144606	Kate	356	" But is it not a beautiful letter ? Say , Alice,—is it not a letter of which if you were his brother you would feel proud if another girl had shown it to you ? I do feel proud of him . I know that he is a man with a manly heart and manly courage , who will yet do manly things . Here out on the mountain , with nobody near us , with Nature all round us , I ask you on your solemn word as a woman , do you love him ? "
144711	144715	144717	144717	Alice	337	" Love him ! "
144719	144774	144606	144606	Kate	356	" Yes;—love him : as a woman should love her husband . Is not your heart his ? Alice , there need be no lies now . If it be so , it should be your glory to say so , here , to me , as you hold that letter in your hand . "
144775	144802	144606	144606	Kate	356	" I can have no such glory , Kate . I have ever loved my cousin ; but not so passionately as you seem to think . "
144803	144813	144606	144606	Kate	356	" Then there can be no passion in you . "
144814	144845	144606	144606	Kate	356	" Perhaps not , Kate . I would sometimes hope that it is so . But come ; we shall be late ; and you will be cold sitting there . "
144846	144908	144606	144606	Kate	356	" I would sit here all night to be sure that your answer would be as I would have it . But , Alice , at any rate you shall tell me before I move what your answer is to be . I know you will not refuse him ; but make me happy by saying so with your own lips . "
144909	144921	144606	144606	Kate	356	" I can not tell you before you move , Kate . "
144922	144927	144606	144606	Kate	356	" And why not ? "
144928	144937	144606	144606	Kate	356	" Because I have not as yet resolved . "
144938	144993	144606	144606	Kate	356	" Ah , that is impossible . That is quite impossible . On such a subject and under such circumstances a woman must resolve at the first moment . You had resolved , I know , before you had half read the letter;—though , perhaps , it may not suit you to say so . "
144994	145014	144606	144606	Kate	356	" You are quite mistaken . Come along and let us walk , and I will tell you all . "
145036	145096	145016	145016	Kate	356	" I have not made up my mind as to what answer I will give him ; but I have shown you his letter in order that I might have some one with whom I might speak openly . I knew well how it would be , and that you would strive to hurry me into an immediate promise . "
145097	145107	144606	144606	Kate	356	" No;—no ; I want nothing of the kind . "
145108	145122	144606	144606	Kate	356	" But yet I could not deny myself the comfort of your friendship . "
145123	145322	144606	144606	Kate	356	" No , Alice , I will not hurry you . I will do nothing that you do not wish . But you can not be surprised that I should be very eager . Has it not been the longing of all my life ? Have I not passed my time plotting and planning and thinking of it till I have had time to think of nothing else ? Do you know what I suffered when , through George 's fault , the engagement was broken off ? Was it not martyrdom to me,—that horrid time in which your Crichton from Cambridgeshire was in the ascendant ? Did I not suffer the tortures of purgatory while that went on;—and yet , on the whole , did I not bear them with patience ? And , now , can you be surprised that I am wild with joy when I begin to see that everything will be as I wish;—for it will be as I wish , Alice . It may be that you have not resolved to accept him . But you would have resolved to refuse him instantly had that been your destined answer to his letter . "
145359	145371	145373	145373	Kate	356	" You will not answer him without speaking to me first ? "
145375	145391	145393	145393	Alice	337	" I will , at any rate , not send my answer without telling you , "
145395	145404	145393	145393	Alice	337	" And you will let me see it ? "
145405	145408	145410	145410	Alice	337	" Nay , "
145412	145430	145410	145410	Alice	337	" I will not promise that . But if it is unfavourable I will show it you . "
145431	145439	145441	145441	Kate	356	" Then I shall never see it , "
145445	145495	145441	145441	Kate	356	" But that is quite enough for me . I by no means wish to criticise the love - sweet words in which you tell him that his offences are all forgiven . I know how sweet they will be . Oh , heavens ! how I envy him ! "
145573	145584	145586	145586	Kate	356	" But , grandpapa , you are always too fast , "
145588	145598	145600	145603	the hungry old squire	4223	" And you are always too slow , miss , "
145605	145619	145600	145603	the hungry old squire	4223	" Indeed , it is not five yet . Is it , Alice ? "
145620	145631	145600	145603	the hungry old squire	4223	" And how long are you going to be dressing ? "
145632	145649	145600	145603	the hungry old squire	4223	" Not ten minutes;—are we , Alice ? And , grandpapa , pray do n't wait . "
145650	145662	145663	145663	he	1427	" Do n't wait ! That 's what they always say , "
145668	145687	145663	145663	he	1427	" As if one would be any better waiting for them after the meat is on the table . "
145738	145745	145746	145746	she	356	word—"Pray for him to - night , "
145749	145759	145746	145746	she	356	" as you pray for those you love best . "
145804	145813	145814	145814	she	337	" Why should I keep him in suspense ? "
145817	145837	145814	145814	she	337	" If it is to be so , there can be no good in not saying so at once . "
145938	145945	145946	145946	she	337	" He also is not passionate , "
146018	146027	146029	146029	Kate;—for	573	" But it is n't post - day , "
146040	146053	146055	146055	Alice	337	" I have given a boy sixpence to take it to Shap , "
146059	146066	146068	146068	Kate	356	" And what have you said ? "
146078	146085	146087	146087	Alice	337	" I have kept my promise , "
146089	146101	146087	146087	Alice	337	" and do you keep yours by asking no further questions . "
146102	146108	146110	146110	Kate	356	" My sister,—my own sister , "
146187	146198	146200	146200	Kate	356	" You have not proposed any horrid stipulations to him ? "
146202	146214	146216	146216	Alice	337	" I do n't know what you may call horrid stipulations , "
146220	146240	146216	146216	Alice	337	" My conditions have not been very hard , and I do not think you would have disapproved them . "
146241	146253	146172	146172	Alice	337	" But he!—He is so impetuous ! Will he disapprove them ? "
146254	146276	146216	146216	Alice	337	" I have told him — But , Kate , this is just what I did not mean to tell you . "
146277	146286	146288	146288	Kate	356	" Why should there be secrets between us ? "
146290	146344	146288	146288	Kate	356	" There shall be none , then . I have told him that I can not bring myself to marry him instantly;—that he must allow me twelve months to wear off , if I can in that time , much of sadness and of self - reproach which has fallen to my lot . "
146345	146351	146216	146216	Alice	337	" Twelve months , Alice ? "
146352	146424	146425	146425	she	4232	" Listen to me . I have said so . But I have told him also that if he wishes it still , I will at once tell papa and grandpapa that I hold myself as engaged to him , so that he may know that I bind myself to him as far as it is possible that I should do so . And I have added something else , Kate , "
146432	146493	146425	146425	she	4232	pause,—"something else which I can tell you , though I could tell it to no other person . I can tell you because you would do , and will do the same . I have told him that any portion of my money is at his service which may be needed for his purposes before that twelve months is over . "
146494	146512	146216	146216	Alice	337	" Oh , Alice ! No;—no . You shall not do that . It is too generous . "
146538	146691	146425	146425	she	4232	" But I have done it . Mercury , with sixpence in his pocket , is already posting my generosity at Shap . And , to tell the truth , Kate , it is no more than fair . He has honestly told me that while the old Squire lives he will want my money to assist him in a career of which I do much more than approve . It has been my earnest wish to see him in Parliament . It will now be the most earnest desire of my heart;—the one thing as to which I shall feel an intense anxiety . How then can I have the face to bid him wait twelve months for that which is specially needed in six months ' time ? It would be like the workhouses which are so long in giving bread , that in the mean time the wretches starve . "
146692	146700	146702	146702	Kate	356	" But the wretch sha n't starve , "
146704	146755	146425	146425	she	4232	" My money , small as it is , will carry him over this bout . I have told him that he shall have it , and that I expect him to spend it . Moreover , I have no doubt that Aunt Greenow would lend me what he wants . "
146756	146790	146425	146425	she	4232	" But I should not wish him to borrow from Aunt Greenow . She would advance him the money , as you say , upon stamped paper , and then talk of it . "
146791	146797	146799	146799	Kate	356	" He shall have mine , "
146801	146807	146809	146809	Alice	337	" And who are you ? "
146813	146823	146809	146809	Alice	337	" You are not going to be his wife ? "
146824	146837	146839	146839	Kate	356	" He shall not touch your money till you are his wife , "
146844	146899	146839	146839	Kate	356	" I wish you would consent to change your mind about this stupid tedious year , and then you might do as you pleased . I have no doubt such a settlement might be made as to the property here , when my grandfather hears of it , as would make you ultimately safe . "
146900	146928	146809	146809	Alice	337	" And do you think I care to be ultimately safe , as you call it ? Kate , my dear , you do not understand me . "
146929	146946	146809	146809	Alice	337	" I suppose not . And yet I thought that I had known something about you . "
146947	146989	146839	146839	Kate	356	" It is because I do not care for the safety of which you speak that I am now going to become your brother 's wife . Do you suppose that I do not see that I must run much risk ? "
146990	147008	146809	146809	Alice	337	" You prefer the excitement of London to the tranquillity , may I say , of Cambridgeshire . "
147009	147027	146839	146839	Kate	356	" Exactly;—and therefore I have told George that he shall have my money whenever he wants it . "
147457	147460	147461	147461	she	337	" Grandpapa , "
147572	147574	147576	147576	Alice	337	accounts.—"Grandpapa , "
147589	147606	147576	147576	Alice	337	" you told me the other day that you thought I ought to be — married . "
147607	147632	147576	147576	Alice	337	" Did I , my dear ? Well , yes ; so I did . And so you ought;—I mean to that Mr. Grey . "
147633	147640	147576	147576	Alice	337	" That is impossible , sir . "
147641	147657	147576	147576	Alice	337	" Then what 's the use of your coming and talking to me about it ? "
147674	147688	147694	147694	he	4257	" I am come , grandpapa , to tell you of another engagement . "
147689	147692	147694	147694	he	4257	" Another ! "
147740	147744	147746	147746	she	337	" You know , "
147748	147762	147764	147764	she	337	" that some years ago I was to have been married to my cousin George;"—and
147767	147770	147772	147774	the old man	1427	" Well , "
147776	147790	147764	147764	she	337	" And I remember you told me then that you were much pleased . "
147791	147824	147764	147764	she	337	" So I was . George was doing well then ; or,—which is more likely,—had made us believe that he was doing well . Have you made it up with him again ? "
147825	147830	147772	147774	the old man	1427	" Yes , sir . "
147831	147846	147764	147764	she	337	" And that 's the meaning of your jilting Mr. Grey , is it ? "
147941	147944	147945	147945	she	337	" Grandpapa ! "
147966	148014	147945	147945	she	337	" Well , my dear , I do n't want to be ill - natured . So you are going at last to marry George , are you ? I hope he 'll treat you well ; that 's all . Does your father approve of it ? "
148015	148038	147956	147956	her	337	" I have told you first , sir;—because I wish to obtain your consent to seeing George again here as your grandson . "
148039	148042	148044	148046	the old man	1427	" Never , "
148048	148050	148044	148046	the old man	1427	snarling;—"never ! "
148051	148064	147956	147956	her	337	" If he has been wrong , he will beg your pardon . "
148065	148112	147956	147956	her	337	" If he has been wrong ! Did n't he want to squander every shilling of the property,—property which has never belonged to him;—property which I could give to Tom , Dick , or Harry to - morrow , if I liked?—If he has been wrong ! "
148113	148134	148044	148046	the old man	1427	" I am not defending him , sir;—but I thought that , perhaps , on such an occasion as this — "
148135	148157	147956	147956	her	337	" A Tom Fool 's occasion ! You 've got money of your own . He 'll spend all that now . "
148158	148193	147956	147956	her	337	" He will be less likely to do so if you will recognise him as your heir . Pray believe , sir , that he is not the sort of man that he was . "
148194	148260	148044	148046	the old man	1427	" He must be a very clever sort of man , I think , when he has talked you out of such a husband as John Grey . It 's astounding to me,—with that ugly mug of his ! Well , my dear , if your father approves of it , and if George will ask my pardon,—but I do n't think he ever will — "
148261	148277	147956	147956	her	337	" He will , sir . I am his messenger for as much as that . "
148278	148351	148044	148046	the old man	1427	" Oh , you are , are you ? Then you may also be my messenger to him , and tell him that , for your sake , I will let him come back here . I know he 'll insult me the first day ; but I 'll try and put up with it,—for your sake , my dear . Of course I must know what your father thinks about it . "
148369	148377	148379	148380	John Vavasor	338	" I knew it would be so , "
148399	148409	148391	148391	he	338	" I knew all along how it would be . "
148410	148422	148379	148380	John Vavasor	338	" And why should it not be so , Uncle John ? "
148423	148437	148379	148380	John Vavasor	338	" He is your brother , and I will not tell you why . "
148438	148447	148391	148391	he	338	" You think that he is a spendthrift ? "
148448	148477	148379	148380	John Vavasor	338	" I think that he is as unsafe a man as ever I knew to be intrusted with the happiness of any young woman . That is all . "
148478	148487	148379	148380	John Vavasor	338	" You are hard upon him , uncle . "
148488	148559	148560	148560	Alice	448	" Perhaps so . Tell Alice this from me,—that as I have never yet been able to get her to think anything of my opinion , I do not at all expect that I shall be able to induce her to do so now . I will not even make the attempt . As my son - in - law I will not receive George Vavasor . Tell Alice that . "
148810	148814	148816	148816	he	805	" And now , "
148828	148842	148816	148816	he	805	" let us see what the girl of my heart says to me . "
149721	149725	149727	149727	he	357	" Very well , "
149729	149753	149727	149727	he	357	" so be it . It is probably the best thing that I could do , whatever the effect may be on her . "
149963	149966	149972	149972	him	427	" Burgo , "
149992	150007	149972	149972	him	427	" Burgo , your old flame , Lady Glencora , is not coming here . "
150008	150014	150016	150016	Burgo	427	" Lady Glencora not coming ! "
150068	150088	150100	150100	he	427	" No ; she is not coming . It ca n't be matter of any moment to you now . "
150089	150098	150100	150100	he	427	" But , by heavens , it is , "
150124	150143	150100	150100	he	427	" It is matter of moment to me . I am the most unfortunate devil that ever lived . "
150144	150176	150180	150184	another man booted and spurred	4316	" Fie , Burgo , fie ! You must not speak in that way of a married woman . I begin to think it is better that she should not come . "
150239	150248	150250	150251	his aunt	10621	" Come back into your room , Burgo , "
150293	150312	150268	150269	Lady Monk	552	" If this does annoy you , you should keep it to yourself ! What will people say ? "
150313	150322	150268	150269	Lady Monk	552	" How can I help what they say ? "
150323	150402	150268	150269	Lady Monk	552	" But you would not wish to injure her , I suppose ? I thought it best to tell you , for fear you should show any special sign of surprise if you heard of it first in public . It is very weak in you to allow yourself to feel that sort of regard for a married woman . If you can not constrain yourself I shall be afraid to let you meet her in Brook Street . "
150425	150435	150437	150437	he	427	" You can do as you please about that , "
150439	150458	150437	150437	he	427	" but you know as well as I do what I have made up my mind to do . "
150459	150495	150496	150497	Lady Monk	552	" Nonsense , Burgo ; I know nothing of the kind . But do you go down - stairs to breakfast , and do n't look like that when you go among the people there . "
150944	150951	150952	150952	he	583	" Palliser is coming without her , "
150968	150976	150952	150952	he	583	" She 's ill , she says . "
150977	150984	150986	150987	one man	2915	" I 'm sorry for it , "
150989	151001	150986	150987	one man	2915	" She 's a deal the better fellow of the two . "
151002	151014	151016	151016	another	1506	" She has twice more go in her than Planty Pall , "
151018	151029	151031	151032	Sir Cosmo	583	" Planty is no fool , I can tell you , "
151045	151058	151031	151032	Sir Cosmo	583	" We think he 's about the most rising man we have . "
151110	151124	151126	151142	one man,—a very young man , who hardly knew what had been the circumstances of the case	4359	" Burgo , do you hear that Palliser is coming without his wife ? "
151163	151172	151174	151174	Burgo	427	" I have heard,—and be d––––d to him , "
151252	151262	151264	151265	Sir Cosmo	583	" Burgo , you had better eat your breakfast , "
151267	151275	151276	151276	He	427	" I do n't want any breakfast . "
151317	151334	151336	151337	Sir Cosmo	583	" If you do n't eat any breakfast the less of that you take the better , "
151339	151346	151348	151348	he	427	" I 'm all right now , "
151639	151645	151647	151648	Sir Cosmo	583	" I can do nothing , "
151650	151681	151647	151648	Sir Cosmo	583	" He is a man whom no one 's words will control . Something has ruffled him this morning , and he must run his chance till he becomes quiet . "
152036	152042	152044	152045	Lady Monk	552	" We are so sorry , "
152047	152062	152044	152045	Lady Monk	552	" We have been looking forward to having Lady Glencora with us beyond everything . "
152117	152125	152127	152128	Lady Monk	552	" I hope it is nothing serious , "
152233	152238	152240	152241	Lady Monk	552	" How very wrong ! "
152246	152252	152254	152255	Mr. Palliser	485	" It was very wrong , "
152264	152293	152294	152295	Lady Monk	552	" However , she caught a cold which , unfortunately , has become worse at my uncle 's , and so I was obliged to take her home . "
152539	152542	152543	152543	she	552	" Glencora , "
152553	152571	152543	152543	she	552	" you wo n't be angry , I hope , if I say a word to you ? "
152572	152583	152585	152586	Lady Glencora	488	" That depends very much upon what the word is , "
152717	152731	152733	152734	Miss Palliser	519	" Well,—the word shall be as little unpleasant as I can make it , "
152745	152771	152733	152734	Miss Palliser	519	" But why say anything that is unpleasant ? However , if it is to be said , let us have it over at once . "
152772	152785	152733	152734	Miss Palliser	519	" You are going to Monkshade , I believe , with Plantagenet . "
152786	152792	152733	152734	Miss Palliser	519	" Well;—and what of that ? "
152793	152812	152733	152734	Miss Palliser	519	" Dear Glencora , I think you had better not go . Do you not think so yourself ? "
152813	152821	152823	152824	Lady Glencora	488	" Who has been talking to you ? "
152832	152845	152823	152824	Lady Glencora	488	" Nobody has been talking to me;—not in the sense you mean . "
152846	152853	152733	152734	Miss Palliser	519	" Plantagenet has spoken to you ? "
152854	152859	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" Not a word , "
152864	152908	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" You may be sure that he would not utter a word on such a subject to anyone unless it were to yourself . But , dear Glencora , you should not go there;—I mean it in all kindness and love,—I do indeed . "
152923	152928	152930	152930	she	488	" Perhaps you do , "
152936	152953	152930	152930	she	488	" Indeed I do . The world is so hard and cruel in what it says . "
152954	152967	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" I do not care two straws for what the world says . "
152968	152974	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" But he might care . "
152975	153024	152930	152930	she	488	" It is not my fault . I do not want to go to Monkshade . Lady Monk was my friend once , but I do not care if I never see her again . I did not arrange this visit . It was Plantagenet who did it . "
153025	153042	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" But he will not take you there if you say you do not wish it . "
153043	153111	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" I have said so , and he told me that I must go . You will hardly believe me,—but I condescended even to tell him why I thought it better to remain away . He told me , in answer , that it was a silly folly which I must live down , and that it did not become me to be afraid of any man . "
153112	153122	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" Of course you are not afraid , but — "
153123	153147	152861	152862	Miss Palliser	519	" I am afraid . That is just the truth . I am afraid;—but what can I do more than I have done ? "
153398	153411	153413	153417	one young member of Parliament	4413	" I ca n't see that there 's so much in him , "
153422	153434	153436	153437	the baronet	4414	" I rather think that there is , all the same , "
153439	153526	153436	153437	the baronet	4414	" There 's a good deal in him , I believe ! I dare say he 's not very bright , but I do n't know that we want brightness . A bright financier is the most dangerous man in the world . We 've had enough of that already . Give me sound common sense , with just enough of the gab in a man to enable him to say what he 's got to say ! We do n't want more than that nowadays . "
153622	153639	153641	153641	he	485	" I 'm sorry that we have not the pleasure of seeing Lady Glencora with you , "
153643	153649	153651	153652	Mr. Palliser	485	" She is unfortunately indisposed , "
153654	153661	153651	153652	Mr. Palliser	485	" I am sorry for it , "
153663	153667	153669	153669	he	427	Burgo—"very sorry indeed . "
153876	153883	153884	153884	he	357	" I can not congratulate you , "
153889	153903	153884	153884	he	357	" I hope the time may come , papa , when you will , "
153952	153960	153961	153961	he	357	" I think so badly of him , "
153973	153998	153961	153961	he	357	" that I would rather know that almost any other calamity was to befall her , than that she should be united to him . "
154044	154054	154055	154055	he	1192	" It would do very well for the property , "
154058	154092	154055	154055	he	1192	" I would settle the estate on their eldest son , so that he could not touch it ; and I do n't see why he should n't reform as well as another . "
154178	154184	154186	154186	he	1427	" You may tell him , "
154188	154261	154186	154186	he	1427	" that I will never see him again unless he begs my pardon for his personal bad conduct to me , but that if he marries you , I will take care that the property is properly settled upon his child and yours . I shall always be glad to see you , my dear ; and for your sake , I will see him if he will humble himself to me . "
154356	154366	154367	154367	she	337	" There can not be obedience on one side , "
154372	154381	154367	154367	she	337	" without protection and support on the other . "
154942	154951	154952	154952	he	338	" She will be tired to - night , "
154965	154976	154952	154952	he	338	" and I will speak to her to - morrow . "
155081	155094	155095	155095	he	338	" I want to speak to you after breakfast to - morrow , "
155196	155204	155206	155206	Alice	337	" Will you come up - stairs ? "
155219	155226	155228	155228	he	338	" Perhaps that will be best , "
155248	155251	155253	155253	he	338	" Alice , "
155255	155267	155253	155253	he	338	" I must speak to you about this engagement of yours . "
155268	155292	155293	155293	He	338	" Wo n't you sit down , papa ? It does look so dreadful , your standing up over one in that way . "
155323	155336	155315	155315	he	338	" I was greatly grieved when I heard of this at Vavasor . "
155337	155349	155253	155253	he	338	" I am sorry that you should be grieved , papa . "
155350	155373	155293	155293	He	338	" I was grieved . I must confess that I never could understand why you treated Mr. Grey as you have done . "
155374	155393	155315	155315	he	338	" Oh , papa , that 's done and past . Pray let that be among the bygones . "
155394	155406	155253	155253	he	338	" Does he know yet of your engagement with your cousin ? "
155407	155419	155293	155293	He	338	" He will know it by this time to - morrow . "
155420	155439	155253	155253	he	338	" Then I beg of you , as a great favour , to postpone your letter to him . "
155447	155471	155442	155442	Alice	337	" I have not troubled you with many such requests , Alice . Will you tell me that this one shall be granted ? "
155472	155492	155293	155293	He	338	" I think that I owe it to him as an imperative duty to let him know the truth . "
155493	155502	155503	155503	Alice	337	" But you may change your mind again . "
155544	155556	155557	155557	she	337	" I have no right to say that it is impossible , "
155567	155571	155573	155574	her father	805	" No;—exactly so , "
155576	155591	155573	155574	her father	805	" And therefore it will be better that you should postpone any such communication . "
155592	155600	155573	155574	her father	805	" For how long do you mean ? "
155601	155616	155573	155574	her father	805	" Till you and I shall have agreed together that he should be told . "
155617	155663	155573	155574	her father	805	" No , papa ; I will not consent to that . I consider myself bound to let him know the truth without delay . I have done him a great injury , and I must put an end to that as soon as possible . "
155664	155679	155681	155682	Mr. Vavasor	338	" You have done him an injury certainly , my dear;—a very great injury , "
155694	155717	155681	155682	Mr. Vavasor	338	" and I believe he will feel it as such to the last day of his life , if this goes on . "
155718	155742	155768	155768	Alice	337	" I hope not . I believe that it will not be so . I feel sure that it will not be so . "
155743	155767	155768	155768	Alice	337	" But of course what I am thinking of now is your welfare,—not his . When you simply told me that you intended to—. "
155808	155819	155820	155820	he	805	her—"that you intended to break your engagement with Mr. Grey , "
155823	155906	155907	155907	He	4484	" I said little or nothing to you . I would not ask you to marry any man , even though you had yourself promised to marry him . But when you tell me that you are engaged to your cousin George , the matter is very different . I do not think well of your cousin . Indeed I think anything but well of him . It is my duty to tell you that the world speaks very ill of him . "
155915	155925	155926	155926	he	4484	" When you were about to travel with him , "
155929	155971	155926	155926	he	4484	" I ought perhaps to have told you the same . But I did not wish to pain you or his sister ; and , moreover , I have heard worse of him since then,—much worse than I had heard before . "
155972	155989	155991	155991	Alice	337	" As you did not tell me before , I think you might spare me now , "
155993	156031	155991	155991	Alice	337	" No , my dear ; I can not allow you to sacrifice yourself without telling you that you are doing so . If it were not for your money he would never think of marrying you . "
156032	156040	156042	156042	Alice	337	" Of that I am well aware , "
156044	156054	156042	156042	Alice	337	" He has told me so himself very plainly . "
156055	156063	155926	155926	he	4484	" And yet you will marry him ? "
156064	156146	155991	155991	Alice	337	" Certainly I will . It seems to me , papa , that there is a great deal of false feeling about this matter of money in marriage,—or rather , perhaps , a great deal of pretended feeling . Why should I be angry with a man for wishing to get that for which every man is struggling ? At this point of George 's career the use of money is essential to him . He could not marry without it . "
156147	156159	156161	156162	her father	805	" You had better then give him your money without yourself , "
156168	156180	156182	156182	Alice	337	" That is just what I mean to do , papa , "
156184	156187	156189	156190	Mr. Vavasor	357	" What ! "
156198	156211	156189	156190	Mr. Vavasor	357	" You mean to give him your money before you marry him ? "
156212	156235	156243	156244	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Certainly I do;—if he should want it;—or , I should rather say , as much as he may want of it . "
156236	156241	156243	156244	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Heavens and earth ! "
156246	156254	156243	156244	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Alice , you must be mad . "
156255	156265	156267	156267	she	337	" To part with my money to my friend ? "
156269	156287	156267	156267	she	337	" It is a kind of madness of which I need not at any rate be ashamed . "
156288	156304	156189	156190	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Tell me this , Alice ; has he got any of it as yet ? "
156305	156347	156189	156190	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Not a shilling . Papa , pray do not look at me like that . If I had no thought of marrying him you would not call me mad because I lent to my cousin what money he might need . "
156348	156414	156243	156244	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I should only say that so much of your fortune was thrown away , and if it were not much that would be an end of it . I would sooner see you surrender to him the half of all you have , without any engagement to marry him , than know that he had received a shilling from you under such a promise . "
156415	156424	156189	156190	Mr. Vavasor	357	" You are prejudiced against him , sir . "
156425	156457	156189	156190	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Was it prejudice that made you reject him once before ? Did you condemn him then through prejudice ? Had you not ascertained that he was altogether unworthy of you ? "
156458	156466	156468	156468	Alice	337	" We were both younger , then , "
156478	156540	156468	156468	Alice	337	" We were both much younger then , and looked at life with other eyes than those which we now use . For myself I expected much then , which I now seem hardly to regard at all ; and as for him , he was then attached to pleasures to which I believe he has now learned to be indifferent . "
156541	156544	156546	156547	the father	825	" Psha ! "
156549	156558	156560	156560	Alice	337	" I can only speak as I believe , "
156562	156626	156560	156560	Alice	337	" And I think I may perhaps know more of his manner of life than you do , papa . But I am prepared to run risks now which I feared before . Even though he were all that you think him to be , I would still endeavour to do my duty to him , and to bring him to other things . "
156627	156639	156641	156642	Mr. Vavasor	357	" What is it you expect to get by marrying him ? "
156644	156657	156659	156659	Alice	337	" A husband whose mode of thinking is congenial to my own , "
156661	156710	156659	156659	Alice	337	" A husband who proposes to himself a career in life with which I can sympathize . I think that I may perhaps help my cousin in the career which he has chosen , and that alone is a great reason why I should attempt to do so . "
156711	156716	156718	156719	Mr. Vavasor	357	" With your money ? "
156724	156730	156732	156732	Alice	337	" Partly with my money , "
156740	156755	156732	156732	Alice	337	" Though it were only with my money , even that would be something . "
156756	156893	156896	156896	Alice	337	" Well , Alice , as your father , I can only implore you to pause before you commit yourself to his hands . If he demands money from you , and you are minded to give it to him , let him have it in moderation . Anything will be better than marrying him . I know that I can not hinder you ; you are as much your own mistress as I am my own master,—or rather a great deal more , as my income depends on my going to that horrid place in Chancery Lane . But yet I suppose you must think something of your father 's wishes and your father 's opinion . It will not be pleasant for you to stand at the altar without my being there near you . "
156962	156973	156974	156974	he	805	" Has any day been fixed between you and him ? "
156977	156982	156974	156974	he	805	" No , papa . "
156983	156991	156974	156974	he	805	" Nothing has been said about that ? "
156992	157038	156974	156974	he	805	" Yes ; something has been said . I have told him that it can not be for a year yet . It is because I told him that , that I told him also that he should have my money when he wanted it . "
157039	157045	157047	157048	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Not all of it ? "
157050	157126	157047	157048	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I do n't suppose he will need it all . He intends to stand again for Chelsea , and it is the great expense of the election which makes him want money . You are not to suppose that he has asked me for it . When I made him understand that I did not wish to marry quite yet , I offered him the use of that which would be ultimately his own . "
157127	157134	156974	156974	he	805	" And he has accepted it ? "
157135	157156	156974	156974	he	805	" He answered me just as I had intended,—that when the need came he would take me at my word . "
157157	157240	157047	157048	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Then , Alice , I will tell you what is my belief . He will drain you of every shilling of your money , and when that is gone , there will be no more heard of the marriage . We must take a small house in some cheap part of the town and live on my income as best we may . I shall go and insure my life , so that you may not absolutely starve when I die . "
157874	157881	157882	157882	she	337	" And I did love him , "
158036	158050	158017	158017	she	337	" If I can do him good why should I not marry him ? "
158076	158120	158121	158121	He	883	" For myself , what does it matter ? As to this life of mine and all that belongs to it , why should I regard it otherwise than to make it of some service to some one who is dear to me ? "
158374	158383	158384	158384	she	337	" It may be as my father says , "
158387	158416	158384	158384	she	337	" It may be that he wants my money only ; if so , let him have it . Surely when the year is over I shall know . "
158878	158881	158883	158883	he	4525	" Alice , "
158892	158895	158883	158883	he	4525	hand,—"Dearest Alice ! "
159011	159014	159015	159015	he	4525	" Alice , "
159018	159045	159015	159015	he	4525	" I am a man once again . It is only now that I can tell you what I have suffered during these last few years . "
159096	159099	159100	159100	he	4525	" Alice , "
159103	159138	159100	159100	he	4525	" I feel that I am a strong man again , armed to meet the world at all points . Will you not let me thank you for what you have done for me ? "
159226	159236	159237	159237	she	337	" I have done nothing for you , George , "
159240	159245	159237	159237	she	337	" nothing at all . "
159277	159303	159262	159262	she	337	" That you may do much for yourself is my greatest hope . If I can help you , I will do so most heartily . "
159328	159336	159337	159337	he	4525	" Of course you will help me , "
159340	159402	159337	159337	he	4525	" I am full of plans , all of which you must share with me . But now , at this moment , my one great plan is that in which you have already consented to be my partner . Alice , you are my wife now . Tell me that it will make you happy to call me your husband . "
159552	159561	159562	159562	she	4537	" That must be still distant , George , "
159565	159572	159562	159562	she	4537	" I have suffered so much ! "
159573	159598	159562	159562	she	4537	" And it has been my fault that you have suffered ; I know that . These years of misery have been my doing . "
159617	159624	159625	159625	she	4537	" I do not say that , "
159628	159645	159625	159625	she	4537	" nor have I ever thought it . I have myself and myself only to blame . "
159677	159687	159647	159647	he	4525	" Alice , dear , let bygones be bygones . "
159688	159741	159772	159772	he	4525	" Bygones will not be bygones . It may be well for people to say so , but it is never true . One might as well say so to one 's body as to one 's heart . But the hairs will grow grey , and the heart will grow cold . "
159742	159754	159756	159756	George	357	" I do not see that one follows upon the other , "
159758	159764	159772	159772	he	4525	" My hair is growing very grey;"—and
159795	159828	159772	159772	he	4525	" If grey hairs make an old man , Alice , you will marry an old husband ; but even you shall not be allowed to say that my heart is old . "
159831	159834	159836	159837	her cousin	883	" husband , "
159889	159897	159899	159899	she	337	" I spoke of my own heart , "
159901	159912	159899	159899	she	337	" I sometimes feel that it has grown very old . "
159913	159923	159887	159887	him	10972	" Alice , that is hardly cheering to me . "
159924	159998	160006	160006	she	337	" You have come to me too quickly , George , and do not reflect how much there is that I must remember . You have said that bygones should be bygones . Let them be so , at any rate as far as words are concerned . Give me a few months in which I may learn,—not to forget them , for that will be impossible,—but to abstain from speaking of them . "
160236	160239	160240	160240	he	10972	" Alice , "
160243	160256	160240	160240	he	10972	" your greeting to me is hardly all that I had hoped . "
160257	160262	160264	160264	she	337	" Is it not ? "
160266	160302	160240	160240	he	10972	" Indeed , George , I am sorry that you should be disappointed ; but what can I say ? You would not have me affect a lightness of spirit which I do not feel ? "
160303	160308	160310	160310	he	10972	" If you wish , "
160313	160332	160310	160310	he	10972	slowly,—"if you wish to retract your letter to me , you now have my leave to do so . "
160394	160404	160406	160406	she	337	" I do not wish to retract my letter , "
160416	160493	160406	160406	she	337	" but I wish to be left awhile , that I may recover my strength of mind . Have you not heard doctors say , that muscles which have been strained , should be allowed rest , or they will never entirely renew their tension ? It is so with me now ; if I could be quiet for a few months , I think I could learn to face the future with a better courage . "
160494	160507	160412	160412	he	10972	" And is that all you can say to me , Alice ? "
160508	160516	160412	160412	he	10972	" What would you have me say ? "
160517	160604	160406	160406	she	337	" I would fain hear one word of love from you ; is that unreasonable ? I would wish to know from your own lips that you have satisfaction in the renewed prospect of our union ; is that too ambitious ? It might have been that I was over - bold in pressing my suit upon you again ; but as you accepted it , have I not a right to expect that you should show me that you have been happy in accepting it ? "
160776	160788	160789	160789	he	4549	" And you have not a word to say to me ? "
160853	160881	160882	160882	He	4549	" No other word , at present , George ; I have told you that I am not at ease . Why do you press me now ? "
161169	161179	161180	161180	he	4549	" You wish me then to go from you ? "
161183	161193	161180	161180	he	4549	" Do not be angry with me , George ! "
161194	161252	161150	161150	his	4549	" Angry ! I have no right to be angry . But , by heaven , I am wrong there . I have the right , and I am angry . I think you owed it me to give me some warmer welcome . Is it to be thus with us always for the next accursed year ? "
161253	161258	161180	161180	he	4549	" Oh , George ! "
161259	161371	161180	161180	he	4549	" To me it will be accursed . But is it to be thus between us always ? Alice , I have loved you above all women . I may say that I have never loved any woman but you ; and yet I am sometimes driven to doubt whether you have a heart in you capable of love . After all that has passed , all your old protestations , all my repentance , and your proffer of forgiveness , you should have received me with open arms . I suppose I may go now , and feel that I have been kicked out of your house like a dog . "
161372	161394	161467	161467	she	4558	" If you speak to me like that , and look at me like that , how can I answer you ? "
161395	161449	161450	161450	She	4558	" I want no answer . I wanted you to put your hand in mine , to kiss me , and to tell me that you are once more my own . Alice , think better of it ; kiss me , and let me feel my arm once more round your waist . "
161831	161833	161830	161833	the " Handsome Man,"—and	10981	" Handsome Man,"—and
162393	162400	162402	162403	Mr. Scruby	435	" You can wait , Smithers , "
162409	162417	162402	162403	Mr. Scruby	435	" I sha n't be very long . "
162478	162496	162498	162498	Scruby	435	" You see , when they 're in a small way of business , it ruins them , "
162500	162534	162498	162498	Scruby	435	" Now that poor devil,—he has n't had a shilling of his money yet , and the greater part has been paid out of his pocket to the posters . It is hard . "
162581	162595	162597	162597	he	357	" It is astonishing how much a man may get done for him , "
162599	162606	162597	162597	he	357	" without paying anything for years . "
162607	162656	162597	162597	he	357	" Yes ; that 's true . So he may , if he knows how to go about it . But when he does pay , Mr. Vavasor , he does it through the nose;—cent . per cent . , and worse , for all his former shortcomings . "
162657	162668	162670	162670	George	357	" How many there are who never pay at all , "
162672	162720	162670	162670	George	357	" Yes , Mr. Vavasor;—that 's true , too . But see what a life they lead . It is n't a pleasant thing to be afraid of coming into your agent 's office ; not what you would like , Mr. Vavasor;—not if I know you . "
162721	162731	162733	162733	Vavasor	357	" I never was afraid of meeting anyone yet , "
162735	162747	162733	162733	Vavasor	357	" but I do n't know what I may come to . "
162748	162899	162670	162670	George	357	" Nor never will , I 'll go bail . But , Lord love you , I could tell you such tales ! I 've had Members of Parliament , past , present , and future , almost down on their knees to me in this little room . It 's about a month or six weeks before the elections come on when they 're at their worst . There is so much you see , Mr. Vavasor , for which a gentleman must pay ready money . It is n't like a business in which a lawyer is supposed to find the capital . If I had money enough to pay out of my own pocket all the cost of all the metropolitan gentlemen for whom I act , why , I could live on the interest without any trouble , and go into Parliament myself like a man . "
162943	162948	162950	162950	he	357	" I suppose so , "
162952	162960	162950	162950	he	357	" But you do do it sometimes . "
162961	162967	162969	162970	Mr. Scruby	435	" Never , Mr. Vavasor , "
162975	163040	162969	162970	Mr. Scruby	435	" As a rule , never . I may advance the money , on interest , of course , when I receive a guarantee from the candidate 's father , or from six or seven among the committee , who must all be very substantial,—very substantial indeed . But in a general way I do n't do it . It is n't my place . "
163041	163060	162950	162950	he	357	" I thought you did;—but at any rate I do n't want you to do it for me . "
163061	163070	163072	163073	Mr. Scruby	435	" I 'm quite sure you do n't , "
163089	163119	163072	163073	Mr. Scruby	435	" I never thought you did , Mr. Vavasor . Lord bless you , Mr. Vavasor , I know the difference between gentlemen as soon as I see them . "
163194	163198	163236	163236	he	357	" Handsome Man . "
163313	163320	163326	163326	he	435	" Yes , yes;—a family arrangement , "
163842	163853	163858	163858	she	337	words—"Look here , upon this picture — and on this . "
164391	164400	164401	164401	he	353	" Do n't speak of this as yet , "
164408	164456	164401	164401	he	353	" Of course when the matter is settled , those few people who know me must know it . But perhaps there may be a doubt as yet , and as long as there is a doubt , it is better that it should not be discussed . "
164600	164612	164614	164614	Alice	337	" It is right that I should tell you at once , "
164630	164641	164614	164614	Alice	337	address—"It is right that I should tell you at once that—. "
164659	164838	164651	164651	her	337	this!—"that my cousin , George Vavasor , has repeated to me his offer of marriage , and that I have accepted it . I tell you , chiefly in order that I may save you from the trouble which you purposed to take when I last saw you at Cheltenham . I will not tell you any of the circumstances of this engagement , because I have no right to presume that you will care to hear them . I hardly dare to ask you to believe of me that in all that I have done , I have endeavoured to act with truth and honesty . That I have been very ignorant , foolish,—what you will that is bad , I know well ; otherwise there could not have been so much in the last few years of my life on which I am utterly ashamed to look back . For the injury that I have done you , I can only express deep contrition . I do not dare to ask you to forgive me.—ALICE VAVASOR . "
164871	164885	164886	164886	she	4651	" He 'll know it , and that is all that is necessary , "

165540	165546	165548	165548	Seward	596	" Is there anything wrong ? "
165550	165576	165548	165548	Seward	596	" Well;—yes ; there is something a little wrong . I fear I must leave you , and go up to town to - day . "
165577	165584	165619	165619	Seward	596	" Nobody ill , I hope ? "
165585	165618	165619	165619	Seward	596	" No;—nobody is ill . But I must go up to London . Mrs. Bole will take care of you , and you must not be angry with me for leaving you . "
165719	165725	165727	165727	Grey	353	" Why not stay here ? "
165735	165749	165727	165727	Grey	353	" I wish you would , old fellow ; I do , indeed . "
165766	165785	165786	165786	Grey	353	" If I can be of the slightest service or comfort to you , I will of course . "
165795	165806	165786	165786	Grey	353	" I wish you would ; I do , indeed . "
165807	165812	165758	165758	his	353	" Then I will . "
165820	165832	165834	165834	Grey	353	" I have got a letter here from — Miss Vavasor , "
165836	165842	165834	165834	Grey	353	" May I hope that — "
165843	165901	165786	165786	Grey	353	" No;—it does not bring good news to me . I do not know that I can tell it you all . I would if I could , but the whole story is one not to be told in a hurry . I should leave false impressions . There are things which a man can not tell . "
165902	165907	165909	165909	Seward	596	" Indeed there are , "
165911	165950	165909	165909	Seward	596	" I wish with all my heart that you knew it all as I know it ; but that is impossible . There are things which happen in a day which it would take a lifetime to explain . "
165957	166032	165786	165786	Grey	353	" I have heard bad news this morning , and I must go up to London at once . I shall go into Ely so as to be there by twelve ; and if you will , you shall drive me over . I may be back in a day ; certainly in less than a week ; but it will be a comfort to me to know that I shall find you here . "
166058	166061	166062	166062	Grey	353	" Seward , "
166067	166138	166062	166062	Grey	353	" if I fail in what I am going to attempt , it is probable that you will never hear Alice Vavasor 's name mentioned by me again ; but I want you always to bear this in mind;—that at no moment has my opinion of her ever been changed , nor must you in such case imagine from my silence that it has changed . Do you understand me ? "
166139	166145	165786	165786	Grey	353	" I think I do . "
166146	166222	166223	166223	Seward	596	" To my thinking she is the finest of God 's creatures that I have known . It may be that in her future life she will be severed from me altogether ; but I shall not , therefore , think the less well of her ; and I wish that you , as my friend , should know that I so esteem her , even though her name should never be mentioned between us . "
166332	166339	166340	166340	he	353	" Have you heard from her ? "
166372	166373	166374	166374	Grey	353	" Yes,"—said
166376	166383	166374	166374	Grey	353	" she has written to me . "
166384	166407	166340	166340	he	353	" And told you about her cousin George . I tried to hinder her from writing , but she is very wilful . "
166408	166435	166340	166340	he	353	" Why should you have hindered her ? If the thing was to be told , it is better that it should be done at once . "
166436	166483	166484	166484	he	353	" But I hoped that there might be an escape . I do n't know what you think of all this , Grey , but to me it is the bitterest misfortune that I have known . And I 've had some bitter things , too , "
166509	166518	166520	166520	Grey	353	" What is the escape that you hoped ? "
166522	166564	166566	166567	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I hardly know . The whole thing seems to me to be so mad , that I partly trusted that she would see the madness of it . I am not sure whether you know anything of my nephew George ? "
166569	166573	166575	166575	Grey	353	" Very little , "
166577	166655	166575	166575	Grey	353	" I believe him to be utterly an adventurer,—a man without means and without principle,—upon the whole about as bad a man as you may meet . I give you my word , Grey , that I do n't think I know a worse man . He 's going to marry her for her money ; then he will beggar her , after that he 'll ill - treat her , and yet what can I do ? "
166656	166661	166566	166567	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Prevent the marriage . "
166662	166736	166575	166575	Grey	353	" But how , my dear fellow ? Prevent it ! It 's all very well to say that , and it 's the very thing I want to do . But how am I to prevent it ? She 's as much her own master as you are yours . She can give him every shilling of her fortune to - morrow . How am I to prevent her from marrying him ? "
166737	166751	166753	166753	Grey	353	" Let her give him every shilling of her fortune to - morrow , "
166755	166764	166766	166767	Mr. Vavasor	357	" And what is she to do then ? "
166769	166779	166781	166782	John Grey	353	" Then — then,—then,—then let her come to me , "
166834	166867	166786	166786	he	353	" God bless you ; God bless you , my dear fellow . I heartily wish for her sake that I could look forward to any such an end to this affair . "
166868	166895	166786	166786	he	353	" And why not look forward to it ? You say that he merely wants her money . As he wants it let him have it ! "
166896	166928	166786	166786	he	353	" But Grey , you do not know Alice ; you do not understand my girl . When she had lost her fortune nothing would induce her to become your wife . "
166929	166938	166940	166941	John Grey	353	" Leave that to follow as it may , "
166943	167025	166940	166941	John Grey	353	" Our first object must be to sever her from a man , who is , as you say , himself on the verge of ruin ; and who would certainly make her wretched . I am here now , not because I wish her to be my own wife , but because I wish that she should not become the wife of such a one as your nephew . If I were you I would let him have her money . "
167026	167100	167101	167102	John Grey	353	" If you were I , you would have nothing more to do with it than the man that is as yet unborn . I know that she will give him her money because she has said so ; but I have no power as to her giving it or as to her withholding it . That 's the hardship of my position;—but it is of no use to think of that now . "
167511	167521	167522	167522	she	337	" Of course he must come if he will , "
167532	167558	167522	167522	she	337	" It can make no matter . He will say nothing half so hard to me as what I say to myself all day long . "
167733	167736	167737	167737	he	353	" Alice , "
167864	167867	167868	167868	he	353	" Alice , "
167890	167897	167898	167898	he	353	" You may give it me , "
167901	167908	167898	167898	he	353	" as to an old friend . "
167935	167938	167939	167939	he	353	" Alice , "
167942	167977	167939	167939	he	353	" I do not expect you to say much to me ; but there is a question or two which I think you will answer . Has a day been fixed for this marriage ? "
167978	167981	167982	167982	she	337	" No , "
167985	167993	167939	167939	he	353	" Will it be in a month ? "
167994	168002	168003	168003	she	337	" Oh , no;—not for a year , "
168066	168100	168055	168055	he	353	" And now one other question , Alice;—but if you are silent , I will not ask it again . Can you tell me why you have again accepted your cousin 's offer ? "
168101	168105	168106	168106	she	337	" Because — , "
168126	168134	168135	168135	she	337	" But you would never understand me , "
168136	168158	168159	168159	He	353	said,—"and there can be no reason why I should dare to hope that you should ever think well of me again . "
168297	168300	168301	168301	he	353	" Alice , "
168309	168436	168301	168301	he	353	" nothing has ever yet been done which need to a certainty separate you and me . I am a persistent man , and I do not even yet give up all hope . A year is a long time . As you say yourself , I do not as yet quite understand you . But , Alice,—and I think that the position in which we stood a few months since justifies me in saying so without offence,—I love you now as well as ever , and should things change with you , I can not tell you with how much joy and eagerness I should take you back to my bosom . My heart is yours now as it has been since I knew you . "
168490	168506	168478	168478	he	4698	" My heart is still yours , as it has been since I knew you . "
168584	168603	168564	168564	he	4698	" I can not tell you with how much joy I would take you back to my bosom ! "
169240	169243	169244	169244	she	337	" No , "
169247	169248	169252	169252	she	337	" no,"—speaking
169258	169271	169244	169244	she	337	" no;—it was not in my bargain ; I never meant it . "
169810	169817	169818	169818	She	337	" What am I to do ? "
170331	170334	170335	170336	Mr. Grey	353	" No ; "
170356	170388	170341	170342	Mr. Vavasor	357	" he is not specially an ecclesiastical lawyer . He had a partner at Ely , and was always employed by my father , and by most of the clergy there . "
170536	170548	170549	170549	Grey	353	" I wish you to understand from the lady 's father , "
170555	170572	170549	170549	Grey	353	" that the marriage would be regarded by him with as much dismay as by myself . "
170573	170579	170580	170581	Mr. Vavasor	338	" Certainly;—it would be ruinous , "
170585	170593	170580	170581	Mr. Vavasor	338	" And you see , Mr. Tombe , "
170599	170641	170594	170595	Mr. Grey	353	" we only wish to try the man . If he be not such as we believe him to be , he can prove it by his conduct . If he is worthy of her , he can then take her . "
170642	170654	170656	170660	the mild - eyed lawyer	4748	" You merely wish to open her eyes , Mr. Grey , "
170662	170686	170656	170660	the mild - eyed lawyer	4748	" I wish that he should have what money he wants , and then we shall find what it is he really wishes . "
170687	170696	170698	170699	the lawyer	9538	" Yes ; we shall know our man , "
170701	170711	170698	170699	the lawyer	9538	" He shall have the money , Mr. Grey , "
170739	170747	170724	170724	he	338	" What ; all in the dark ? "
170748	170770	170724	170724	he	338	" Yes , papa . Why should I have candles when I am doing nothing ? I did not expect you . "
170771	170794	170808	170809	her father	805	" No ; I suppose not . I came here because I want to say a few words to you about business . "
170795	170801	170724	170724	he	338	" What business , papa ? "
170843	170862	170833	170833	he	805	" Well ; my love , if I understood you rightly , your cousin George wants some money . "
170863	170889	170724	170724	he	338	" I did not say that he wants it now ; but I think he will want it before the time for the election comes . "
170890	170910	170833	170833	he	805	" If so , he will want it at once . He has not asked you for it yet ? "
170911	170932	170833	170833	he	805	" No ; he has merely said that should he be in need he would take me at my word . "
170933	170961	170724	170724	he	338	" I think there is no doubt that he wants it . Indeed , I believe that he is almost entirely without present means of his own . "
170962	171003	170833	170833	he	805	" I can hardly think so ; but I have no knowledge about it . I can only say that he has not asked me yet , and that I should wish to oblige him whenever he may do so . "
171004	171011	170833	170833	he	805	" To what extent , Alice ? "
171012	171066	170724	170724	he	338	" I do n't know what I have . I get about four hundred a year , but I do not know what it is worth , or how far it can all be turned into money . I should wish to keep a hundred a year and let him have the rest . "
171067	171074	171082	171082	his	4753	" What ; eight thousand pounds ! "
171096	171121	170724	170724	he	338	" I do not imagine that he will want so much ; but if he should , I wish that he should have it . "
171122	171127	171129	171130	John Vavasor	338	" Heaven and earth ! "
171132	171144	171145	171145	He	338	" Of course we should have to give up the house . "
171167	171179	171145	171145	He	338	" But he has asked me for nothing yet , papa . "
171180	171240	170724	170724	he	338	" No , exactly ; and perhaps he may not ; but I wish to know what to do when the demand is made . I am not going to oppose you now ; your money is your own , and you have a right to do with it as you please;—but would you gratify me in one thing ? "
171241	171248	171294	171294	he	4755	" What is it , papa ? "
171249	171263	171145	171145	He	338	" When he does apply , let the amount be raised through me ? "
171264	171269	170724	170724	he	338	" How through you ? "
171270	171292	171294	171294	he	4755	" Come to me ; I mean , so that I may see the lawyer , and have the arrangements made . "
171329	171342	171343	171343	he	4755	" I will promise you that I will not oppose your wishes , "
171426	171436	171658	171659	Lady Glencora	488	" You will see that I am at Matching , "
171441	171656	171658	171659	Lady Glencora	488	" whereas you will remember that I was to have been at Monkshade . I escaped at last by a violent effort , and am now passing my time innocently,—I fear not so profitably as she would induce me to do,—with Iphy Palliser . You remember Iphy . She is a good creature , and would fain turn even me to profit , if it were possible . I own that I am thinking of them all at Monkshade , and am in truth delighted that I am not there . My absence is entirely laid upon your shoulders . That wicked evening amidst the ruins ! Poor ruins . I go there alone sometimes and fancy that I hear such voices from the walls , and see such faces through the broken windows ! All the old Pallisers come and frown at me , and tell me that I am not good enough to belong to them . There is a particular window to which Sir Guy comes and makes faces at me . I told Iphy the other day , and she answered me very gravely , that I might , if I chose , make myself good enough for the Pallisers . Even for the Pallisers ! Is n't that beautiful ? "
171686	171690	171692	171693	Lady Glencora	488	" That is , "
171695	171709	171692	171693	Lady Glencora	488	" if I am still good enough for the Pallisers at that time . "
171951	171959	171960	171960	he	357	" D – – – – it , "
171969	171976	171960	171960	he	357	" I will pay that fellow ; "
172518	172527	172528	172528	he	4797	" What a beastly country to live in , "
172559	172565	172566	172566	he	4797	" What trash it is , "
172569	172596	172566	172566	he	4797	" hanging on to such a place as that without the means of living like a gentleman , simply because one 's ancestors have done so . "
172630	172636	172638	172639	the landlord	2393	" Well , Mr. George , "
172647	172671	172638	172639	the landlord	2393	" a sight of you 's guid for sair een . It 's o'er lang since you 've been doon amang the fells . "
172830	172850	172852	172853	the landlord	2393	" He was always one of them cankery chiels as never have a kindly word for man nor beast , "
172855	172873	172852	172853	the landlord	2393	" Seems as though that raw slash in his face had gone right through into his heart . "
173361	173369	173370	173370	he	796	" Where do you want to go ? "
173465	173472	173452	173452	he	4831	" Only to Shap , grandpapa . "
173473	173493	173452	173452	he	4831	" To Shap ! what on earth can take you to Shap ? There are no shops at Shap . "
173494	173511	173452	173452	he	4831	" I am not going to do shopping . I want to see some one there . "
173512	173522	173452	173452	he	4831	" Whom can you want to see at Shap ? "
173545	173552	173553	173553	she	356	" My brother has come down , "
173556	173590	173553	173553	she	356	" and is at the inn there . I had not intended to tell you , as I did not wish to mention his name till you had consented to receive him here . "
173591	173601	173603	173604	the squire	1192	" And he expects to come here now;—does he ? "
173606	173635	173603	173604	the squire	1192	" Oh , no , sir . I think he has no expectation of the kind . He has come down simply to see me;—about business I believe . "
173636	173653	173553	173553	she	356	" Business ! what business ? I suppose he wants to get your money from you ? "
173654	173683	173553	173553	she	356	" I think it is with reference to his marriage . I think he wants me to use my influence with Alice that it may not be delayed . "
173684	173794	173553	173553	she	356	" Look here , Kate ; if ever you lend him your money , or any of it,—that is , of the principal I mean,—I will never speak to him again under any circumstance . And more than that ! Look here , Kate . In spite of all that has past and gone , the property will become his for his life when I die,—unless I change my will . If he gets your money from you , I will change it , and he shall not be a shilling richer at my death than he is now . You can have the horse to go to Shap . "
174212	174222	174224	174224	Kate	356	" Grandpapa knows that you are here , George , "
174233	174246	174224	174224	Kate	356	" The deuce he does ! and why did you tell him ? "
174247	174266	174179	174179	she	356	" I could not get the car to come in without letting him know why I wanted it . "
174267	174295	174179	174179	she	356	" What nonsense ! as if you could n't have made any excuse ! I was particularly anxious that he should not guess that I am here . "
174296	174310	174224	174224	Kate	356	" I do n't see that it can make any difference , George . "
174311	174346	174179	174179	she	356	" But I see that it can,—a very great difference . It may prevent my ever being able to get near him again before he dies . What did he say about my coming ? "
174347	174354	174179	174179	she	356	" He did n't say much . "
174355	174366	174179	174179	she	356	" He made no offer as to my going there ? "
174367	174370	174224	174224	Kate	356	" No . "
174371	174459	174179	174179	she	356	" I should not have gone if he had . I do n't know now that I ever shall go . To be there to do any good,—so as to make him alter his will , and leave me in the position which I have a right to expect , would take more time than the whole property is worth . And he would endeavour to tie me down in some way I could not stand;—perhaps ask me to give up my notion for going into Parliament . "
174460	174481	174179	174179	she	356	" He might ask you , but he would not make it ground for another quarrel , if you refused . "
174482	174511	174179	174179	she	356	" He is so unreasonable and ignorant that I am better away from him . But , Kate , you have not congratulated me on my matrimonial prospects . "
174512	174525	174224	174224	Kate	356	" Indeed I did , George , when I wrote to you . "
174526	174577	174179	174179	she	356	" Did you ? well ; I had forgotten . I do n't know that any very strong congratulatory tone is necessary . As things go , perhaps it may be as well for all of us , and that 's about the best that can be said for it . "
174578	174583	174179	174179	she	356	" Oh , George ! "
174584	174626	174179	174179	she	356	" You see I 'm not romantic , Kate , as you are . Half a dozen children with a small income do not generally present themselves as being desirable to men who wish to push their way in the world . "
174627	174640	174179	174179	she	356	" You know you have always longed to make her your wife . "
174641	174683	174179	174179	she	356	" I do n't know anything of the kind . You have always been under a match - making hallucination on that point . But in this case you have been so far successful , and are entitled to your triumph . "
174684	174698	174179	174179	she	356	" I do n't want any triumph ; you ought to know that . "
174699	174717	174719	174719	he	4854	" But I 'll tell you what I do want , Kate . I want some money . "
174738	174772	174730	174730	he	4854	" I 'm not at all sure that I have not been wrong in making this attempt to get into Parliament,—that I 'm not struggling to pick fruit which is above my reach . "
174773	174781	174179	174179	she	356	" Do n't say that , George . "
174782	174888	174730	174730	he	4854	" Ah , but I ca n't help feeling it . I need hardly tell you that I am ready to risk anything of my own . If I know myself I would toss up to - morrow , or for the matter of that to - day , between the gallows and a seat in the House . But I can not go on with this contest by risking what is merely my own . Money , for immediate use , I have none left , and my neck , though I were ever so willing to risk it , is of no service . "
174889	174900	174902	174902	Kate	356	" Whatever I have can be yours to - morrow , "
174987	174990	174992	174992	he	1120	" No ; "
174994	175002	174992	174992	he	1120	" I shall not take your money . "
175003	175017	174961	174961	her	356	" You would not scruple , if you knew how welcome you are . "
175018	175073	174992	174992	he	1120	" At any rate , I shall not take it . I should not think it right . All that you have would only just suffice for my present wants , and I should not choose to make you a beggar . There would , moreover , be a difficulty about readjusting the payment . "
175074	175091	174992	174992	he	1120	" There would be no difficulty , because no one need be consulted but us two . "
175092	175110	175112	175112	George	357	" I should not think it right , and therefore let there be an end of it , "
175126	175134	175136	175136	Kate	356	" What is it you wish then ? "
175147	175203	175136	175136	Kate	356	" I will explain to you . When Alice and I are married , of course there will be a settlement made on her , and as we are both the grandchildren of the old squire I shall propose that the Vavasor property shall be hers for life in the event of her outliving me . "
175204	175207	175209	175209	Kate	356	" Well , "
175211	175251	175209	175209	Kate	356	" And if this be done , there can be no harm in my forestalling some of her property , which , under the circumstances of such a settlement , would of course become mine when we are married . "
175252	175265	175136	175136	Kate	356	" But the squire might leave the property to whom he pleases . "
175266	175321	175136	175136	Kate	356	" We know very well that he wo n't , at any rate , leave it out of the family . In fact , he would only be too glad to consent to such an agreement as that I have proposed , because he would thereby rob me of all power in the matter . "
175322	175334	175209	175209	Kate	356	" But that could not be done till you are married . "
175335	175344	175136	175136	Kate	356	" Look here , Kate;—don't you make difficulties . "
175367	175392	175357	175357	his	4858	" If you mean to say that you wo n't help me , do say so , and I will go back to London . "
175393	175408	175209	175209	Kate	356	" I would do anything in my power to help you,—that was not wrong ! "
175409	175462	175209	175209	Kate	356	" Yes ; anybody could say as much as that . That is not much of an offer if you are to keep to yourself the power of deciding what is wrong . Will you write to Alice,—or better still , go to her , and explain that I want the money . "
175463	175472	175209	175209	Kate	356	" How can I go to London now ? "
175473	175614	175616	175616	he	4859	" You can do it very well , if you choose . But if that be too much , then write to her . It will come much better from you than from me ; write to her , and explain that I must pay in advance the expenses of this contest , and that I can not look for success unless I do so . I did not think that the demand would come so quick on me ; but they know that I am not a man of capital , and therefore I can not expect them to carry on the fight for me , unless they know that the money is sure . Scruby has been bitten two or three times by these metropolitan fellows , and he is determined that he will not be bitten again . "
175623	175626	175627	175627	she	356	" George , "
175632	175635	175627	175627	she	356	" Well . "
175636	175648	175209	175209	Kate	356	" I wish you would try any other scheme but that . "
175649	175671	175616	175616	he	4859	" There is no other scheme ! That 's so like a woman;—to quarrel with the only plan that is practicable . "
175672	175685	175616	175616	he	4859	" I do not think you ought to take Alice 's money . "
175686	175744	175209	175209	Kate	356	" My dear Kate , you must allow me to be the best judge of what I ought to do , and what I ought not to do . Alice herself understands the matter perfectly . She knows that I can not obtain this position , which is as desirable for her as it is for me — "
175745	175755	175757	175757	Kate	356	" And for me as much as for either , "
175762	175841	175757	175757	Kate	356	" Very well . Alice , I say , knows that I can not do this without money , and has offered the assistance which I want . I would rather that you should tell her how much I want , and that I want it now , than that I should do so . That is all . If you are half the woman that I take you to be , you will understand this well enough . "
175886	175898	175899	175899	he	1120	" I want you to write to her quite at once , "
175902	175924	175899	175899	he	1120	" since you seem to think that it is not worth while to take the trouble of a journey to London . "
175925	175934	175936	175936	Kate	356	" There is no question about the trouble , "
175938	175956	175936	175936	Kate	356	" I would walk to London to get the money for you , if that were all . "
175957	175970	175972	175972	he	1120	" Do you think that Alice will refuse to lend it me ? "
175979	176022	175972	175972	he	1120	" I am sure that she would not , but I think that you ought not to take it from her . There seems to me to be something sacred about property that belongs to the girl you are going to marry . "
176023	176033	176035	176035	George	357	" If there is anything on earth I hate , "
176042	176180	176035	176035	George	357	" it is romance . If you keep it for reading in your bedroom , it 's all very well for those who like it , but when it comes to be mixed up with one 's business it plays the devil . If you would only sift what you have said , you would see what nonsense it is . Alice and I are to be man and wife . All our interests , and all our money , and our station in life , whatever it may be , are to be joint property . And yet she is the last person in the world to whom I ought to go for money to improve her prospects as well as my own . That 's what you call delicacy . I call it infernal nonsense . "
176181	176208	175972	175972	he	1120	" I tell you what I 'll do , George . I 'll ask Aunt Greenow to lend you the money,—or to lend it to me . "
176209	176272	176273	176273	Kate	356	" I do n't believe she 'd give me a shilling . Moreover , I want it quite immediately , and the time taken up in letter - writing and negotiations would be fatal to me . If you wo n't apply to Alice , I must . I want you to tell me whether you will oblige me in this matter . "
176344	176377	176335	176336	her grandfather	796	" If George wishes to come to the Hall , let him come . If he chooses to tell me that he regrets his conduct to me , I will see him . "
176378	176383	176385	176385	George	357	" What is it ? "
176398	176407	176408	176408	he	357	" I 'll do nothing of the kind , "
176411	176426	176408	176408	he	357	" What good should I get by going to the old man 's house ? "
176427	176431	176433	176433	Kate	356	" Every good , "
176435	176448	176433	176433	Kate	356	" If you do n't go now you never can do so . "
176449	176457	176459	176459	George	357	" Never till it 's my own , "
176461	176516	176517	176517	He	357	" If you show him that you are determined to be at variance with him , it never will be your own;—unless , indeed , it should some day come to you as part of Alice 's fortune . Think of it , George ; you would not like to receive everything from her . "
176547	176555	176557	176557	he	357	" You have n't answered my question , "
176559	176573	176557	176557	he	357	" If I go to the Hall , will you write to Alice ? "
176574	176591	176517	176517	He	357	" No , George ; I can not write to Alice asking her for the money . "
176592	176597	176557	176557	he	357	" You wo n't ? "
176598	176608	176557	176557	he	357	" I could not bring myself to do it . "
176609	176640	176517	176517	He	357	" Then , Kate , you and my grandfather may work together for the future . You may get him to leave you the place if you have skill enough . "
176641	176654	176656	176656	Kate	356	" That is as undeserved a reproach as any woman ever encountered , "
176665	176682	176656	176656	Kate	356	" If you have either heart or conscience , you will feel that it is so . "
176683	176716	176557	176557	he	357	" I 'm not much troubled with either one or the other , I fancy . Things are being brought to such a pass with me that I am better without them . "
176717	176731	176557	176557	he	357	" Will you take my money , George ; just for the present ? "
176732	176748	176656	176656	Kate	356	" No . I have n't much conscience ; but I have a little left . "
176749	176759	176557	176557	he	357	" Will you let me write to Mrs. Greenow ? "
176760	176777	176557	176557	he	357	" I have not the slightest objection ; but it will be of no use whatsoever . "
176778	176797	176656	176656	Kate	356	" I will do so , at any rate . And now will you come to the Hall ? "
176798	176852	176557	176557	he	357	" To beg that old fool 's pardon ? No ; I wo n't . In the mood I am in at present , I could n't do it . I should only anger him worse than ever . Tell him that I 've business which calls me back to London at once . "
176853	176860	176557	176557	he	357	" It is a thousand pities . "
176861	176868	176656	176656	Kate	356	" It ca n't be helped . "
176869	176884	176886	176886	Kate	356	" It may make so great a difference to you for your whole life ! "
176888	176898	176900	176900	George	357	" I 'll tell you what I 'll do , "
176902	176929	176900	176900	George	357	" I 'll go to Vavasor and put up with the old squire 's insolence , if you 'll make this application for me to Alice . "
176983	176995	176997	176997	she	356	" But you 'll let me write to Aunt Greenow first , "
176999	177011	176997	176997	she	356	" It will take only two days,—or at the most three ? "
177093	177122	177069	177069	George	357	" I thank Providence , Kate , that circumstances make it impossible for me to stay above two days . I have not linen to last me longer . "
177123	177134	177051	177051	Alice	337	" We 'll manage that for you at the Hall . "
177135	177204	177069	177069	George	357	" Indeed you wo n't do anything of the kind . And look , Kate , when I make that excuse do n't you offer to do so . I will stay there over to - morrow night , and shall go into Kendal early , so as to catch the express train up on Thursday morning . Do n't you throw me over by any counter proposition . "
177235	177245	177247	177249	the old woman	3707	" Eh , Mr. George ; be that you ? "
177263	177274	177247	177249	the old woman	3707	" A sight of you is good for sair een . "
177309	177322	177324	177324	Kate	356	" I suppose you had better go into the drawing - room , "
177326	177342	177324	177324	Kate	356	" while I go to my grandfather . You wo n't find a fire there . "
177343	177380	177281	177284	the inn - keeper	4879	" Manage it how you please ; but do n't keep me in the cold very long . Heavens , what a country house ! The middle of January , and no fires in the room . "
177381	177418	177324	177324	Kate	356	" And remember , George , when you see him you must say that you regret that you ever displeased him . Now that you are here , do n't let there be any further misunderstanding . "
177419	177430	177432	177432	George	357	" I think it very probable that there will be , "
177434	177478	177432	177432	George	357	" I only hope he 'll let me have the old horse to take me back to Shap if there is . There he is at the front door , so I sha n't have to go into the room without a fire . "
177524	177531	177532	177533	the squire	1192	" So you 've come back , "
177538	177553	177532	177533	the squire	1192	" Yes , sir;—I've come back , like the prodigal son in the parable . "
177554	177567	177501	177501	He	1427	" The prodigal son was contrite . I hope you are so . "
177568	177592	177599	177600	the squire	1192	" Pretty well for that , sir . I 'm sorry there has been any quarrel , and all that , you know . "
177593	177597	177599	177600	the squire	1192	" Go in , "
177605	177626	177627	177627	George	357	" Go in . To expect anything gracious from you would be to expect pearls from swine . Go in . "
177764	177782	177783	177783	he	395	" I 'm – – – – if she has n't been and set up a carriage ! "
177823	177840	177803	177804	Mrs. Greenow	405	" She 's been and set up her carriage as sure as my name 's Cheesacre ! "
178540	178544	178572	178572	I	0	" mahogany - furnitured "
178667	178672	178644	178644	she	387	" don't;—have done now , "
178864	178876	178877	178877	Cheesacre	395	" I 'll mount you with the harriers , old fellow , "
178881	178904	178877	178877	Cheesacre	395	" and give you a little shooting . Only I wo n't have you go out when I 'm not with you . "
179079	179087	179088	179088	she	405	" Going to Oileymead ; are you ? "
179121	179127	179129	179130	the widow	1443	" It 's quite delightful , "
179132	179145	179129	179130	the widow	1443	" to see how fond you two gentlemen are of each other . "
179146	179165	179167	179168	Charlie Fairstairs	413	" I think gentlemen always like to go best to gentlemen 's houses where there are no ladies , "
179183	179188	179190	179190	Bellfield	393	" As for that , "
179192	179243	179190	179190	Bellfield	393	" I wish with all my heart that dear old Cheesy would get a wife . He wants a wife badly , if ever a man did , with all that house full of blankets and crockery . Why do n't you set your cap at him , Miss Fairstairs ? "
179244	179249	179251	179251	Charlie	413	" What;—at a farmer ! "
179279	179286	179288	179289	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Give him my kind love , "
179297	179329	179288	179289	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And look here , Captain Bellfield , suppose you both dine with me next Saturday . He always comes in on Saturday , and you might as well come too . "
179341	179354	179356	179357	the widow	1443	" And Charlie shall come to set her cap at Mr. Cheesacre , "
179369	179375	179356	179357	the widow	1443	" I shall be happy to come,"—said
179381	179398	179376	179376	Charlie	413	" but not with that object . Mr. Cheesacre is very respectable , I 'm sure . "
179561	179568	179569	179569	he	395	" You see , old fellow , "
179572	179611	179569	179569	he	395	" there are the rooms , and of course they 're empty . But it 's such a bore hauling out all the things and putting up the curtains . You 'll be very snug where you are . "
179612	179619	179621	179621	Bellfield	393	" I shall do very well , "
179625	179646	179621	179621	Bellfield	393	" Of course you 'll do very well . It 's the warmest room in the house in one way . "
179824	179836	179838	179838	he	395	" A beggar , you know ; just a regular beggar ! "
179854	179868	179838	179838	he	395	" Poor fellow ! He only wants money to make him almost perfect , "
179975	179988	179989	179989	he	395	" I had to go and just wish her goodbye you know , "
180000	180009	180011	180011	Cheesacre	395	" I do n't see that at all , "
180013	180052	180011	180011	Cheesacre	395	" Why , my dear fellow , how foolishly jealous you are . If I were to be downright uncivil to her , as you would have me be , it would only call attention to the thing . "
180053	180080	179989	179989	he	395	" I 'm not a bit jealous . A man who sits upon his own ground as I do has n't any occasion to be jealous . "
180081	180101	180011	180011	Cheesacre	395	" I do n't know what your own ground has to do with it,—but we 'll let that pass . "
180102	180165	180011	180011	Cheesacre	395	" I think it has a great deal to do with it . If a man does intend to marry he ought to have things comfortable about him ; unless he wants to live on his wife , which I look upon as about the meanest thing a man can do . By George , I 'd sooner break stones than that . "
180187	180197	180199	180199	he	393	" There 's no pleasing you , I know , "
180201	180232	180199	180199	he	393	" But there 's the fact . I went to say goodbye to her , and she asked me to give you that message . Shall we go or not ? "
180253	180264	180265	180265	he	395	" I 'll tell you what it is , Bellfield , "
180270	180311	180265	180265	he	395	" She 's nothing to you , and if you wo n't mind it , I 'll go . Mrs. Jones shall get you anything you like for dinner,—and,—and — I'll stand you a bottle of the ' 34 port ! "
180337	180343	180345	180345	he	393	" No , old fellow , "
180347	180389	180345	180345	he	393	" that cock wo n't fight . She has asked me to dine with her on Saturday , and I mean to go . I do n't intend that she shall think that I 'm afraid of her,—or of you either . "
180390	180395	180405	180406	the Captain	1602	" You don't;—don't you ? "
180396	180403	180405	180406	the Captain	1602	" No , I do n't , "
180409	180424	180426	180426	Cheesacre	395	" I wish you 'd pay me some of that money you owe me , "
180428	180440	180426	180426	Cheesacre	395	" So I will,—when I 've married the widow . Ha,—ha,—ha . "
180499	180509	180511	180511	Cheesacre	395	" She knows a trick worth two of that , "
180515	180538	180511	180511	Cheesacre	395	" I dare say she does ; and if so , why should n't I go and dine with her next Saturday ? "
180539	180615	180625	180626	the Captain	1602	" I 'll tell you why,—because you 're in my way . The deuce is in it if I have n't made the whole thing clear enough . I 've told you all my plans because I thought you were my friend , and I 've paid you well to help me , too ; and yet it seems to me you 'd do anything in your power to throw me over,—only you ca n't . "
180616	180623	180625	180626	the Captain	1602	" What an ass you are , "
180631	180653	180625	180626	the Captain	1602	" just you listen to me . That scraggy young woman , Charlie Fairstairs , is to be there of course . "
180654	180660	180625	180626	the Captain	1602	" How do you know ? "
180661	180719	180625	180626	the Captain	1602	" I tell you that I do know . She was present when the whole thing was arranged , and I heard her asked , and heard her say that she would come;—and for the matter of that I heard her declare that she would n't set her cap at you , because you 're a farmer . "
180720	180734	180736	180736	Cheesacre	395	" Upon my word she 's kind . Upon my word she is , "
180745	180779	180736	180736	Cheesacre	395	" Charlie Fairstairs , indeed ! I would n't pick her out of a gutter with a pair of tongs . She ai n't good enough for my bailiff , let alone me . "
180780	180799	180801	180803	the crafty Bellfield	393	" But somebody must take her in hand on Saturday , if you 're to do any good , "
180805	180818	180820	180820	Cheesacre	395	" What the deuce does she have that nasty creature there for ? "
180839	180865	180820	180820	Cheesacre	395	" She wants a companion , of course . You can get rid of Charlie , you know , when you make her Mrs. Cheesacre . "
180866	180903	180904	180904	Cheesacre	395	" Get rid of her ! You do n't suppose she 'll ever put her foot in this house . Not if I know it . I 've detested that woman for the last ten years . "
180936	180948	180950	180950	Bellfield	393	" You 'll have to dine with her at any rate , "
180952	180968	180950	180950	Bellfield	393	" and I always think that four are better company than three on such occasions . "
181062	181071	181073	181073	he	1602	" We shall be so happy to come , "
181075	181088	181089	181089	he	1602	" Dear old Cheesy is out of his little wits with delight , "
181092	181106	181089	181089	he	1602	" and has already begun to polish off the effects of the farmyard . "
181107	181113	181115	181116	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Effects of the farmyard , "
181130	181147	181115	181116	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It would be well for Captain Bellfield if he had a few such effects himself . "
181148	181157	181159	181159	Jeannette	387	" You can give him enough , ma'am , "
181161	181202	181159	181159	Jeannette	387	" to make him a better man than Mr. Cheesacre any day . And for a gentleman — of course I say nothing , but if I was a lady , I know which should be the man for me . "
181236	181246	181247	181248	Captain Bellfield	393	" You 'll take the dog - cart in ? "
181253	181265	181267	181267	he	393	" I do n't know what I shall do as yet , "
181500	181514	181516	181516	he	393	" What the deuce are you going to do with all this luggage ? "
181524	181541	181543	181543	Bellfield	393	" Put it where I saw you putting yours when I opened my window just now , "
181545	181554	181556	181556	Cheesacre	395	" D – – – – the window , "
181566	181575	181576	181576	he	395	" How you do hack that ham about , "
181579	181595	181576	181576	he	395	" If you ever found hams yourself you 'd be more particular in cutting them . "
181631	181650	181652	181652	Cheesacre	395	" If you did n't mean to eat the meat , why the mischief did you cut it ? "
181654	181670	181672	181672	Bellfield	393	" Upon my word , Cheesacre , you 're too bad;—upon my word you are , "
181677	181684	181686	181687	the other	1088	" What 's the matter now ? "
181689	181695	181686	181687	the other	1088	" Who wants your ham ? "
181696	181710	181576	181576	he	395	" You do , I suppose , or you would n't cut it . "
181711	181769	181686	181687	the other	1088	" No I do n't ; nor anything else either that you 've got . It is n't fair to ask a fellow into your house , and then say such things to him as that . And it is n't what I 've been accustomed to either ; I can tell you that , Mr. Cheesacre . "
181770	181775	181686	181687	the other	1088	" Oh , bother ! "
181776	181826	181576	181576	he	395	" It 's all very well to say bother , but I choose to be treated like a gentleman wherever I go . You and I have known each other a long time , and I 'd put up with more from you than from anyone else ; but — "
181827	181841	181843	181843	Cheesacre	395	" Can you pay me the money that you owe me , Bellfield ? "
181850	181857	181859	181859	Bellfield	393	" No , I ca n't , "
181861	181865	181859	181859	Bellfield	393	" not immediately . "
181866	181877	181843	181843	Cheesacre	395	" Then eat your breakfast , and hold your tongue . "
181962	181965	181967	181967	Cheesacre	395	" Now , "
181977	181989	181967	181967	Cheesacre	395	" what do you mean to do with yourself all day ? "
181990	182005	181967	181967	Cheesacre	395	" I shall go down to the quarters , and look the fellows up . "
182006	182032	181967	181967	Cheesacre	395	" All right . But mind this , Bellfield;—it 's an understood thing , that you 're not to be in the Close before four ? "
182033	182044	181967	181967	Cheesacre	395	" I wo n't be in the Close before four ! "
182045	182070	181967	181967	Cheesacre	395	" Very well . That 's understood . If you deceive me , I 'll not drive you back to Oileymead to - night . "
182226	182234	182236	182237	the Captain	1602	" Have n't you seen her yet ? "
182243	182246	182248	182248	Cheesacre	395	" No , "
182251	182257	182248	182248	Cheesacre	395	" Nor yet Charlie Fairstairs ? "
182258	182264	182266	182266	Cheesacre	395	" I 've seen nobody , "
182295	182307	182309	182309	she	405	" Whoever would have expected two gentlemen to be so punctual , "
182311	182318	182309	182309	she	405	" especially on market - day ! "
182319	182333	182335	182335	Cheesacre	395	" Market - day makes no difference when I come to see you , "
182927	182931	182933	182934	the widow	1443	" Looking well , "
182946	183002	182933	182934	the widow	1443	" Yes , I 'm well enough in health , and I suppose I ought to be thankful that it is so . But if you had buried a wife whom you had loved within the last eighteen months , you would have become as indifferent as I am to all that kind of thing . "
183003	183010	183012	183013	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" I never was married yet , "
183015	183073	183074	183074	Whereupon	393	" And therefore you know nothing about it . Everything in the world is gay and fresh to you . If I were you , Mr. Cheesacre , I would not run the risk . It is hardly worth a woman 's while , and I suppose not a man 's . The sufferings are too great ! "
183083	183093	183095	183095	Cheesacre	395	" But I mean to try all the same , "
183112	183160	183095	183095	Cheesacre	395	" I hope that you may be successful , Mr. Cheesacre , and that she may not be torn away from you early in life . Is dinner ready , Jeannette ? That 's well . Mr. Cheesacre , will you give your arm to Miss Fairstairs ? "
183266	183300	183305	183305	he	395	" I pay my way , and that ought to give a man higher station than being a beggarly captain,—which I do n't believe he is , if all the truth was known . "
183320	183327	183311	183311	himself	395	" Military rank is always recognised , "
183373	183395	183345	183345	He	395	" If you were a magistrate , Mr. Cheesacre , you would have rank ; but I believe you are not . "
183426	183433	183437	183437	himself	395	" Nasty , scraggy old cat , "
183681	183685	183686	183686	she	387	" And now , "
183708	183733	183686	183686	she	387	" We will allow these two gentlemen just half an hour , eh Charlie ? and then we shall expect them up - stairs . "
183734	183744	183746	183746	Cheesacre	395	" Ten minutes will be enough for us here , "
183758	183763	183765	183766	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Half an hour , "
183831	183842	183843	183843	he	393	" I 'll tell you what it is , Bellfield , "
183855	183872	183843	183843	he	393	" I wo n't have you coming here at all , till this matter is settled . "
183873	183880	183882	183882	Bellfield	393	" Till what matter is settled ? "
183888	183896	183882	183882	Bellfield	393	" You know what matter I mean . "
183897	183909	183843	183843	he	393	" You take such a deuce of a time about it . "
183910	183948	183843	183843	he	393	" No , I do n't . I take as little time as anybody could . That other fellow has only been dead about nine months , and I 've got the thing in excellent training already . "
183949	183957	183882	183882	Bellfield	393	" And what harm do I do ? "
183958	184017	183843	183843	he	393	" You disturb me , and you disturb her . You do it on purpose . Do you suppose I ca n't see ? I 'll tell you what , now ; if you 'll go clean out of Norwich for a month , I 'll lend you two hundred pounds on the day she becomes Mrs. Cheesacre . "
184018	184027	183843	183843	he	393	" And where am I to go to ? "
184028	184048	183882	183882	Bellfield	393	" You may stay at Oileymead , if you like;—that is , on condition that you do stay there . "
184049	184077	183843	183843	he	393	" And be told that I hack the ham because it 's not my own . Shall I tell you a piece of my mind , Cheesacre ? "
184078	184084	183843	183843	he	393	" What do you mean ? "
184085	184166	183882	183882	Bellfield	393	" That woman has no more idea of marrying you than she has of marrying the Bishop . Wo n't you fill your glass , old fellow ? I know where the tap is if you want another bottle . You may as well give it up , and spend no more money in pink fronts and polished boots on her account . You 're a podgy man , you see , and Mrs. Greenow does n't like podgy men . "
184226	184234	184235	184235	Bellfield	393	" You are very podgy , Cheesacre , "
184238	184295	184296	184296	Bellfield	393	" and then you so often smell of the farm - yard ; and you talk too much of your money and your property . You 'd have had a better chance if you had openly talked to her of hers,—as I have done . As it is , you have n't any chance at all . "
184464	184481	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" Now I 've told you a bit of my mind , Cheesy , my boy , "
184485	184535	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" and you 'll save yourself a deal of trouble and annoyance if you 'll believe what I say . She does n't mean to marry you . It 's most probable that she 'll marry me ; but , at any rate , she wo n't marry you . "
184536	184548	184550	184550	Cheesacre	395	" Do you mean to pay me my money , sir ? "
184565	184571	184550	184550	Cheesacre	395	" Yes , I do . "
184572	184576	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" But when ? "
184577	184635	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" When I 've married Mrs. Greenow,—and , therefore , I expect your assistance in that little scheme . Let us drink her health . We shall always be delighted to see you at our house , Cheesy , my boy , and you shall be allowed to hack the hams just as much as you please . "
184636	184646	184648	184648	Cheesacre	395	" You shall be made to pay for this , "
184663	184697	184658	184658	he	395	" All right , old fellow ; I 'll pay for it,—with the widow 's money . Come ; our half - hour is nearly over ; shall we go up - stairs ? "
184698	184704	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" I 'll expose you . "
184705	184714	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" Do n't now;—don't be ill - natured . "
184715	184732	184658	184658	he	395	" Will you tell me where you mean to sleep to - night , Captain Bellfield ? "
184733	184756	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" If I sleep at Oileymead it will only be on condition that I have one of the mahogany - furnitured bedrooms . "
184757	184776	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" You 'll never put your foot in that house again . You 're a rascal , sir . "
184777	184831	184658	184658	he	395	" Come , come , Cheesy , it wo n't do for us to quarrel in a lady 's house . It would n't be the thing at all . You 're not drinking your wine . You might as well take another glass , and then we 'll go up - stairs . "
184832	184878	184483	184483	Bellfield	393	" You 've left your traps at Oileymead , and not one of them you shall have till you 've paid me every shilling you owe me . I do n't believe you 've a shirt in the world beyond what you 've got there . "
184879	184934	184936	184936	he	5067	" It 's lucky I brought one in to change ; was n't it , Cheesy ? I should n't have thought of it only for the hint you gave me . I might as well ring the bell for Jeannette to put away the wine , if you wo n't take any more . "
184957	184966	184968	184968	Cheesacre	395	" Was he here before to - day ? "
184982	185008	184971	184971	his	395	" Who ? The Captain ? Oh dear no . The Captain do n't come here much now;—not to say often , by no means . "
185009	185016	184971	184971	his	395	" He 's a confounded rascal . "
185017	185023	185025	185025	Jeannette	387	" Oh , Mr. Cheesacre ! "
185027	185046	185025	185025	Jeannette	387	" He is;—and I ai n't sure that there ai n't others nearly as bad as he is . "
185047	185069	184971	184971	his	395	" If you mean me , Mr. Cheesacre , I do declare you 're a wronging me ; I do indeed . "
185070	185083	184971	184971	his	395	" What 's the meaning of his going on in this way ? "
185084	185113	184971	184971	his	395	" I do n't know nothing of his ways , Mr. Cheesacre ; but I 've been as true to you , sir;—so I have;—as true as true . "
185176	185185	185172	185172	her	922	" Yes , Mr. Cheesacre,—as true as true . "
185203	185213	185217	185217	herself	387	" What game is up now , I wonder , "
185225	185248	185217	185217	herself	387	" They two'll be cutting each other 's throatses before they 've done , and then my missus will take the surwiver . "
185367	185370	185372	185373	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Yes , "
185417	185428	185407	185407	she	405	" Yes,—there he is . It 's so like him . "
185442	185499	185431	185431	she	405	" Dear Greenow ; dear husband ! When my spirit is false to thee , let thine forget to visit me softly in my dreams . Thou wast unmatched among husbands . Whose tender kindness was ever equal to thine ? whose sweet temper was ever so constant ? whose manly care so all - sufficient ? "
185650	185660	185662	185663	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Have you ever seen it , Mr. Cheesacre ? "
185665	185672	185662	185663	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It 's so like him . "
185673	185680	185682	185682	Cheesacre	395	" I saw it at Yarmouth , "
185687	185693	185695	185696	the lady	816	" That you did not , "
185711	185743	185695	185696	the lady	816	" simply because it never was at Yarmouth . A larger one you may have seen , which I always keep , and always shall keep , close by my bedside . "
185744	185751	185756	185756	himself	393	" Not if I know it , "
185866	185883	185885	185886	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" None for me , Captain Bellfield ; many thanks for your politeness all the same , "
186209	186215	186216	186216	he	393	" Good night , Cheesacre , "
186240	186249	186251	186252	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I thought you were staying at Oileymead ? "
186254	186262	186264	186265	the Captain	1602	" I came from there this morning , "
186267	186281	186283	186284	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" But he is n't going back there , I can tell you , "
186286	186291	186293	186294	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Oh , indeed , "
186296	186304	186293	186294	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I hope there is nothing wrong . "
186305	186313	186315	186316	the Captain	1602	" All as right as a trivet , "
186324	186336	186338	186339	Charlie Fairstairs	413	" I promised mamma that I would be home by seven , "
186440	186447	186449	186449	she	816	" I 'm sorry to find , "
186453	186460	186449	186449	she	816	" that you two have quarrelled . "
186461	186465	186467	186467	he	395	" Mrs. Greenow , "
186481	186489	186467	186467	he	395	" that man is a downright swindler . "
186490	186496	186449	186449	she	816	" Oh , Mr. Cheesacre . "
186497	186522	186467	186467	he	395	" He is . He 'll tell you that he was at Inkerman , but I believe he was in prison all the time . "
186543	186554	186555	186555	he	395	" I doubt whether he ever saw a shot fired , "
186558	186567	186555	186555	he	395	" He 's none the worse for that . "
186568	186597	186467	186467	he	395	" But he tells such lies ; and then he has not a penny in the world . How much do you suppose he owes me , now ? "
186598	186617	186555	186555	he	395	" However much it is , I 'm sure you are too much of a gentleman to say . "
186618	186624	186631	186631	himself	395	" Well;—yes , I am , "
186633	186665	186631	186631	himself	395	" But when I asked him how he intended to pay me , what do you think he said ? He said he 'd pay me when he got your money . "
186666	186677	186555	186555	he	395	" My money ! He could n't have said that ! "
186678	186711	186555	186555	he	395	" But he did , Mrs. Greenow ; I give you my word and honour . ' I 'll pay you when I get the widow 's money , ' he said . "
186712	186729	186631	186631	himself	395	" You gentlemen must have a nice way of talking about me when I am absent . "
186730	186754	186555	186555	he	395	" I never said a disrespectful word about you in my life , Mrs. Greenow,—or thought one . He does;—he says horrible things . "
186755	186763	186555	186555	he	395	" What horrible things , Mr. Cheesacre ? "
186764	186846	186555	186555	he	395	" Oh , I ca n't tell you;—but he does . What can you expect from such a man as that , who , to my knowledge , wo n't have a change of clothes to - morrow , except what he brought in on his back this morning . Where he 's to get a bed to - night , I do n't know , for I doubt whether he 's got half - a - crown in the world . "
186847	186851	186631	186631	himself	395	" Poor Bellfield ! "
186852	186859	186555	186555	he	395	" Yes ; he is poor . "
186860	186869	186555	186555	he	395	" But how gracefully he carries his poverty . "
186870	186881	186631	186631	himself	395	" I should call it very disgraceful , Mrs. Greenow . "
186900	186907	186891	186891	he	5111	" Mrs. Greenow,—may I say Arabella ? "
186908	186912	186555	186555	he	395	" Mr. Cheesacre ! "
186913	186946	186555	186555	he	395	" But may n't I ? Come , Mrs. Greenow . You know well enough by this time what it is I mean . What 's the use of shilly - shallying ? "
186947	186991	186992	186992	He	5111	" Shilly - shallying , Mr. Cheesacre ! I never heard such language . If I bid you good night , now , and tell you that it is time for you to go home , shall you call that shilly - shallying ? "
187004	187024	186992	186992	He	5111	" I beg your pardon , Mrs. Greenow ; I do indeed . I did n't mean anything offensive . "
187025	187045	187046	187048	The poor man	5112	" Shilly - shallying , indeed ! There 's very little shall in it , I can assure you . "
187086	187095	187097	187098	the culprit	5116	" I beg your pardon , Mrs. Greenow , "
187102	187107	187109	187110	the widow	1443	" It is granted , "
187112	187151	187109	187110	the widow	1443	" but never tell a lady again that she is shilly - shallying . And look here , Mr. Cheesacre , if it should ever come to pass that you are making love to a lady in earnest — "
187152	187161	187163	187163	he	5112	" I could n't be more in earnest , "
187165	187199	187163	187163	he	5112	" That you are making love to a lady in earnest , talk to her a little more about your passion and a little less about your purse . Now , good night . "
187200	187206	187216	187216	Cheesacre	395	" But we are friends . "
187207	187215	187163	187163	he	5112	" Oh yes;—as good friends as ever . "
187296	187307	187309	187309	Bellfield	613	" It 's only me , Cheesy , my boy , "
187311	187336	187309	187309	Bellfield	613	" I 've just come down by the rail to fetch my things , and I 'm going back to Norwich by the 9.20 . "
187350	187542	187543	187543	He	5123	" roared Cheesacre , as he drove his gig up to his own door . George Vavasor remained about four days beneath his grandfather 's roof ; but he was not happy there himself , nor did he contribute to the happiness of any one else . He remained there in great discomfort so long , being unwilling to leave till an answer had been received to the request made to Aunt Greenow , in order that he might insist on Kate 's performance of her promise with reference to Alice , if that answer should be unfavourable . During these five days Kate did all in her power to induce her brother to be , at any rate , kind in his manner towards his grandfather , but it was in vain . The Squire would not be the first to be gracious ; and George , quite as obstinate as the old man , would take no steps in that direction till encouraged to do so by graciousness from the other side . Poor Kate entreated each of them to begin , but her entreaties were of no avail . "
187551	187557	187545	187549	an ill - mannered cub	5124	" the old man said , "
187579	187622	187623	187623	He	5123	" George argued the matter more at length . Kate spoke to him of his own interest in the matter , urging upon him that he might , by such conduct , drive the Squire to exclude him altogether from the property . "
187630	187636	187623	187623	He	5123	" George said , sulkily . "
187643	187647	187648	187648	Alice	337	" Kate answered . "
187814	187815	187817	187817	he	5123	" "
187827	187831	187833	187833	he	5123	" urged Kate . "
187910	187976	187903	187903	I	0	" The two men said very little to each other . They were never alone together except during that half - hour after dinner in which they were supposed to drink their wine . The old Squire always took three glasses of port during this period , and expected that his grandson would take three with him . But George would drink none at all . "
187986	188000	187977	187977	I	0	" said he , when his grandfather pushed the bottle over to him . "
188012	188028	188003	188003	you	0	" said the Squire , in a tone of voice that was certainly not conciliatory . "
188036	188038	188033	188033	I	0	" said George—"that
188048	188126	188033	188033	I	0	" The old man could not openly quarrel with his heir on such a point as that . Even Mr. Vavasor could not tell his grandson that he was going to the dogs because he had become temperate . But , nevertheless , there was offence in it ; and when George sat perfectly silent , looking at the fire , evidently determined to make no attempt at conversation , the offence grew , and became strong . "
188144	188150	188033	188033	I	0	" said the old man . "
188162	188166	188033	188033	I	0	" said George ; "
188184	188185	188177	188177	you	0	" "
188196	188237	188192	188192	you	0	" said the Squire . From all which it may be seen that George Vavasor 's visit to the hall of his ancestors was not satisfactory . On the fourth day , about noon , came Aunt Greenow 's reply . "
188241	188245	188239	188239	Kate	356	" she said , "
188255	188443	188253	188253	you	356	me,"—thus rushing instantly into the middle of her subject . You see , I do n't know my nephew , and have no reason for being specially anxious that he should be in Parliament . I do n't care two straws about the glory of the Vavasor family . If I had never done anything for myself , the Vavasors would have done very little for me . I do n't care much about what you call ' blood . ' I like those who like me , and whom I know . I am very fond of you , and because you have been good to me I would give you a thousand pounds if you wanted it for yourself ; but I do n't see why I am to give my money to those I do n't know . If it is necessary to tell my nephew of this , pray tell him that I mean no offence . Your friend C. is still waiting — waiting — waiting , patiently ; but his patience may be exhausted . Your affectionate aunt , Arabella Greenow . "
188450	188464	188446	188446	she	5130	" said George , as he threw back the letter to his sister . "
188469	188470	188474	188474	she	5130	" "
188477	188481	188484	188484	she	5130	" said Kate . "

188723	188735	188721	188721	you	0	" said she , thinking of her close attachment to himself . "
188743	188747	188748	188748	You	0	" said George . "
188756	188760	188748	188748	You	0	"—"Oh , George ! "
188761	188794	188823	188823	you	0	" Of course you must ; you have promised . Indeed , it would have been much wiser if you had taken me at my word , and done it at once . "—"I
188800	188821	188748	188748	You	0	" Then the scar on his face opened itself , and his sister stood before him in fear and trembling . "
188829	188833	188823	188823	you	0	" said he , "
188867	188868	188860	188860	you	0	" "

189067	189068	189065	189065	George	357	" "
189180	189589	189171	189171	I	0	" Of course she did not persist in her refusal . With a sorrowful heart , and with fingers that could hardly form the needful letters , she did write a letter to her cousin , which explained the fact — that George Vavasor immediately wanted a thousand pounds for his electioneering purposes . It was a stiff , uncomfortable letter , unnatural in its phraseology , telling its own tale of grief and shame . Alice understood very plainly all the circumstances under which it was written , but she sent back word to Kate at once , undertaking that the money should be forthcoming ; and she wrote again before the end of January , saying that the sum named had been paid to George 's credit at his own bankers . Kate had taken immense pride in the renewal of the match between her brother and her cousin , and had rejoiced in it greatly as being her own work . But all that pride and joy were now over . She could no longer write triumphant notes to Alice , speaking always of George as one who was to be their joint hero , foretelling great things of his career in Parliament , and saying little soft things of his enduring love . It was no longer possible to her now to write of George at all , and it was equally impossible to Alice . Indeed , no letters passed between them , when that monetary correspondence was over , up to the end of the winter . Kate remained down in Westmoreland , wretched and ill at ease , listening to hard words spoken by her grandfather against her brother , and feeling herself unable to take her brother 's part as she had been wo nt to do in other times . George returned to town at the end of those four days , and found that the thousand pounds was duly placed to his credit before the end of the month . It is hardly necessary to tell the reader that this money had come from the stores of Mr. Tombe , and that Mr. Tombe duly debited Mr. Grey with the amount . Alice , in accordance with her promise , had told her father that the money was needed , and her father , in accordance with his promise , had procured it without a word of remonstrance . "
189597	189668	189591	189591	I	0	" Alice had said . But she had been contented when her father told her that the lawyers would manage all that . It was nearly the end of February when George Vavasor made his first payment to Mr. Scruby on behalf of the coming election ; and when he called at Mr. Scruby 's office with this object , he received some intelligence which surprised him not a little . "
189676	189680	189669	189669	You	5142	" said Scruby . "
189684	189688	189689	189690	The Marquis	5143	" said George . "
189703	189747	189748	189749	the Marquis	5143	" Mr. Scruby , as he communicated the tidings , showed clearly by his face and voice that they were supposed to be of very great importance ; but Vavasor did not at first seem to be as much interested in the fate of "
189750	189756	189748	189749	the Marquis	5143	" as Scruby had intended . "
189764	189768	189757	189757	I	0	" said George . "
189789	189790	189757	189757	I	0	" "
189824	189825	189802	189802	It	5143	" "
189837	189868	189802	189802	It	5143	" George , of course , knew well enough that such would be the case , but the effect which this event would have upon himself now struck him suddenly . "
189873	189877	189802	189802	It	5143	" said Scruby . "
189941	189942	189930	189930	We	5148	" "
189953	189957	189930	189930	We	5148	" said George . "
189961	189966	189930	189930	We	5148	" said Mr. Scruby . "
189978	189979	189930	189930	We	5148	" "
189984	189989	189930	189930	We	5148	" said Mr. Scruby ; "
190026	190027	190029	190029	you	5153	" "
190033	190037	190029	190029	you	5153	" asked George . "
190097	190098	190092	190092	he	434	" "
190109	190119	190120	190120	We	5156	" said Vavasor , looking nastily at the attorney . "
190185	190352	190180	190180	I	0	" Vavasor was inclined to doubt the extent of his luck in this respect , and was almost disposed to repent of his Parliamentary ambition . He would now be called upon to spend certainly not less than three thousand pounds of his cousin 's money on the chance of being able to sit in Parliament for a few months . And then , after what a fashion would he be compelled to negotiate that loan ! He might , to be sure , allow the remainder of this Session to run , and stand , as he had intended , at the general election ; but he knew that if he now allowed a Liberal to win the seat , the holder of the seat would be almost sure of subsequent success . He must either fight now , or give up the fight altogether ; and he was a man who did not love to abandon any contest in which he had been engaged . "
190357	190361	190180	190180	I	0	" said Scruby , "
190368	190401	190402	190403	This lord	5159	" And Vavasor felt that he detected in the man 's voice some diminution of that respect with which he had hitherto been treated as a paying candidate for a metropolitan borough . "
190409	190413	190402	190403	This lord	5159	" said Vavasor . "

190679	190712	190670	190670	they	5167	" Vavasor found himself compelled to say that he would stand ; and Scruby undertook to give the initiatory orders at once , not waiting even till the Marquis should be dead . "
190724	190728	190670	190670	they	5167	" said he . "
190736	190744	190670	190670	they	5167	" So George Vavasor gave his orders . "
190753	190759	190760	190760	I	0	" he said to himself , "
190767	191156	191157	191157	You	5170	" As he walked from the attorney 's office to his club he bethought himself that that might not unprobably be the necessary termination of his career . Everything was going wrong with him . His grandfather , who was eighty years of age , would not die,—appeared to have no symptoms of dying;—whereas this Marquis , who was not yet much over fifty , was rushing headlong out of the world , simply because he was the one man whose continued life at the present moment would be serviceable to George Vavasor . As he thought of his grandfather he almost broke his umbrella by the vehemence with which he struck it against the pavement . What right could an ignorant old fool like that have to live for ever , keeping the possession of a property which he could not use , and ruining those who were to come after him ? If now , at this moment , that wretched place down in Westmoreland could become his , he might yet ride triumphantly over his difficulties , and refrain from sullying his hands with more of his cousin 's money till she should become his wife . Even that thousand pounds had not passed through his hands without giving him much bitter suffering . As is always the case in such matters , the thing done was worse than the doing of it . He had taught himself to look at it lightly whilst it was yet unaccomplished ; but he could not think of it lightly now . Kate had been right . It would have been better for him to take her money . Any money would have been better than that upon which he had laid his sacrilegious hands . If he could have cut a purse , after the old fashion , the stain of the deed would hardly have been so deep . In these days,—for more than a month , indeed , after his return from Westmoreland,—he did not go near Queen Anne Street , trying to persuade himself that he stayed away because of her coldness to him . But , in truth , he was afraid of seeing her without speaking of her money , and afraid to see her if he were to speak of it . "
191163	191174	191157	191157	You	5170	" someone said to him as he entered the club . "
191184	191185	191179	191179	I	0	" "
191204	191599	191195	191195	you	5170	" Parliament opened that year on the twelfth of February , and Mr. Palliser was one of the first Members of the Lower House to take his seat . It had been generally asserted through the country , during the last week , that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer had , so to say , ceased to exist as such ; that though he still existed to the outer world , drawing his salary , and doing routine work,—if a man so big can have any routine work to do,—he existed no longer in the inner world of the cabinet . He had differed , men said , with his friend and chief , the Prime Minister , as to the expediency of repealing what were left of the direct taxes of the country , and was prepared to launch himself into opposition with his small bodyguard of followers , with all his energy and with all his venom . There is something very pleasant in the close , bosom friendship , and bitter , uncompromising animosity , of these human gods,—of these human beings who would be gods were they not shorn so short of their divinity in that matter of immortality . If it were so arranged that the same persons were always friends , and the same persons were always enemies , as used to be the case among the dear old heathen gods and goddesses;—if Parliament were an Olympus in which Juno and Venus never kissed , the thing would not be nearly so interesting . But in this Olympus partners are changed , the divine bosom , now rabid with hatred against some opposing deity , suddenly becomes replete with love towards its late enemy , and exciting changes occur which give to the whole thing all the keen interest of a sensational novel . No doubt this is greatly lessened for those who come too near the scene of action . Members of Parliament , and the friends of Members of Parliament , are apt to teach themselves that it means nothing ; that Lord This does not hate Mr. That , or think him a traitor to his country , or wish to crucify him ; and that Sir John of the Treasury is not much in earnest when he speaks of his noble friend at the "
191602	192841	192842	192842	He	5171	" as a god to whom no other god was ever comparable in honesty , discretion , patriotism , and genius . But the outside Briton who takes a delight in politics,—and this description should include ninety - nine educated Englishmen out of every hundred,—should not be desirous of peeping behind the scenes . No beholder at any theatre should do so . It is good to believe in these friendships and these enmities , and very pleasant to watch their changes . It is delightful when Oxford embraces Manchester , finding that it can not live without support in that quarter ; and very delightful when the uncompromising assailant of all men in power receives the legitimate reward of his energy by being taken in among the bosoms of the blessed . But although the outer world was so sure that the existing Chancellor of the Exchequer had ceased to exist , when the House of Commons met that gentleman took his seat on the Treasury Bench . Mr. Palliser , who had by no means given a general support to the Ministry in the last Session , took his seat on the same side of the House indeed , but low down , and near to the cross benches . Mr. Bott sat close behind him , and men knew that Mr. Bott was a distinguished member of Mr. Palliser 's party , whatever that party might be . Lord Cinquebars moved the Address , and I must confess that he did it very lamely . He was once accused by Mr. Maxwell , the brewer , of making a great noise in the hunting - field . The accusation could not be repeated as to his performance on this occasion , as no one could hear a word that he said . The Address was seconded by Mr. Loftus Fitzhoward , a nephew of the Duke of St. Bungay , who spoke as though he were resolved to trump poor Lord Cinquebars in every sentence which he pronounced,—as we so often hear the second clergyman from the Communion Table trumping his weary predecessor , who has just finished the Litany not in the clearest or most audible voice . Every word fell from Mr. Fitzhoward with the elaborate accuracy of a separate pistol - shot ; and as he became pleased with himself in his progress , and warm with his work , he accented his words sharply , made rhetorical pauses , even moved his hands about in action , and quite disgusted his own party , who had been very well satisfied with Lord Cinquebars . There are many rocks which a young speaker in Parliament should avoid , but no rock which requires such careful avoiding as the rock of eloquence . Whatever may be his faults , let him at least avoid eloquence . He should not be inaccurate , which , however , is not much ; he should not be long - winded , which is a good deal ; he should not be ill - tempered , which is more ; but none of these faults are so damnable as eloquence . All Mr. Fitzhoward 's friends and all his enemies knew that he had had his chance , and that he had thrown it away . In the Queen 's Speech there had been some very lukewarm allusion to remission of direct taxation . This remission , which had already been carried so far , should be carried further if such further carrying were found practicable . So had said the Queen . Those words , it was known , could not have been approved of by the energetic and still existing Chancellor of the Exchequer . On this subject the mover of the Address said never a word , and the seconder only a word or two . What they had said had , of course , been laid down for them ; though , unfortunately , the manner of saying could not be so easily prescribed . Then there arose a great enemy , a man fluent of diction , apparently with deep malice at his heart , though at home,—as we used to say at school,—one of the most good - natured fellows in the world ; one ambitious of that godship which a seat on the other side of the House bestowed , and greedy to grasp at the chances which this disagreement in the councils of the gods might give him . He was quite content , he said , to vote for the Address , as , he believed , would be all the gentlemen on his side of the House . No one could suspect them or him of giving a factious opposition to Government . Had they not borne and forborne beyond all precedent known in that House ? Then he touched lightly , and almost with grace to his opponents , on many subjects , promising support , and barely hinting that they were totally and manifestly wrong in all things . But—. Then the tone of his voice changed , and the well - known look of fury was assumed upon his countenance . Then great Jove on the other side pulled his hat over his eyes , and smiled blandly . Then members put away the papers they had been reading for a moment , and men in the gallery began to listen . But—. The long and the short of it was this ; that the existing Government had come into power on the cry of a reduction of taxation , and now they were going to shirk the responsibility of their own measures . They were going to shirk the responsibility of their own election cry , although it was known that their own Chancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to carry it out to the full . He was willing to carry it out to the full were he not restrained by the timidity , falsehood , and treachery of his colleagues , of whom , of course , the most timid , the most false , and the most treacherous was — the great god Jove , who sat blandly smiling on the other side . No one should ever go near the House of Commons who wishes to enjoy all this . It was so manifestly evident that neither Jove nor any of his satellites cared twopence for what the irate gentleman was saying ; nay , it became so evident that , in spite of his assumed fury , the gentleman was not irate . He intended to communicate his look of anger to the newspaper reports of his speech ; and he knew from experience that he could succeed in that . And men walked about the House in the most telling moments,—enemies shaking hands with enemies,—in a way that showed an entire absence of all good , honest hatred among them . But the gentleman went on and finished his speech , demanding at last , in direct terms , that the Treasury Jove should state plainly to the House who was to be , and who was not to be , the bearer of the purse among the gods . Then Treasury Jove got up smiling , and thanked his enemy for the cordiality of his support . "
192846	192850	192842	192842	He	5171	" he said , "
192894	193685	192876	192876	he	5171	" He went on saying a good deal about home matters , and foreign matters , proving that everything was right , just as easily as his enemy had proved that everything was wrong . On all these points he was very full , and very courteous ; but when he came to the subject of taxation , he simply repeated the passage from the Queen 's Speech , expressing a hope that his right honourable friend , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , would be able to satisfy the judgement of the House , and the wishes of the people . That specially personal question which had been asked he did not answer at all . But the House was still all agog , as was the crowded gallery . The energetic and still existing Chancellor of the Exchequer was then present , divided only by one little thin Secretary of State from Jove himself . Would he get up and declare his purposes ? He was a man who almost always did get up when an opportunity offered itself,—or when it did not . Some second little gun was fired off from the Opposition benches , and then there was a pause . Would the purse - bearer of Olympus rise upon his wings and speak his mind , or would he sit in silence upon his cloud ? There was a general call for the purse - bearer , but he floated in silence , and was inexplicable . The purse - bearer was not to be bullied into any sudden reading of the riddle . Then there came on a general debate about money matters , in which the purse - bearer did say a few words , but he said nothing as to the great question at issue . At last up got Mr. Palliser , towards the close of the evening , and occupied a full hour in explaining what taxes the Government might remit with safety , and what they might not,—Mr . Bott , meanwhile , prompting him with figures from behind with an assiduity that was almost too persistent . According to Mr. Palliser , the words used in the Queen 's Speech were not at all too cautious . The Members went out gradually , and the House became very thin during this oration ; but the newspapers declared , next morning , that his speech had been the speech of the night , and that the perspicuity of Mr. Palliser pointed him out as the coming man . He returned home to his house in Park Lane quite triumphant after his success , and found Lady Glencora , at about twelve o'clock , sitting alone . She had arrived in town on that day , having come up at her own request , instead of remaining at Matching Priory till after Easter , as he had proposed . He had wished her to stay , in order , as he had said , that there might be a home for his cousins . But she had expressed herself unwilling to remain without him , explaining that the cousins might have the home in her absence , as well as they could in her presence ; and he had given way . But , in truth , she had learned to hate her cousin Iphy Palliser with a hatred that was unreasonable,—seeing that she did not also hate Alice Vavasor , who had done as much to merit her hatred as had her cousin . Lady Glencora knew by what means her absence from Monkshade had been brought about . Miss Palliser had told her all that had passed in Alice 's bedroom on the last night of Alice 's stay at Matching , and had , by so doing , contrived to prevent the visit . Lady Glencora understood well all that Alice had said : and yet , though she hated Miss Palliser for what had been done , she entertained no anger against Alice . Of course Alice would have prevented that visit to Monkshade if it were in her power to do so . Of course she would save her friend . It is hardly too much to say that Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her . Nevertheless she hated Iphy Palliser for engaging herself in the same business . Lady Glencora looked to Alice to save her , and yet it may be doubted whether she did , in truth , wish to be saved . While she was at Matching , and before Mr. Palliser had returned from Monkshade , a letter reached her , by what means she had never learned . "
193697	193707	192876	192876	he	5171	" she said to her maid , quite openly . "
193713	193732	192876	192876	he	5171	" The maid had declared her ignorance in a manner that had satisfied Lady Glencora of her truth . "
193740	193745	192876	192876	he	5171	" said Lady Glencora , "
193770	193813	193756	193756	I	0	" There , then , had been an end of that , as regarded any steps taken by Lady Glencora . The letter had been from Burgo Fitzgerald , and had contained a direct proposal that she should go off with him . "
193819	193824	193814	193814	I	0	" the letter said , "
193926	194269	193910	193924	the man whom , if you love him , you should regard as your husband	5179	" There had been more of it , but it had been to the same effect . To Lady Glencora it had seemed to convey an assurance of devoted love,—of that love which , in former days , her friends had told her was not within the compass of Burgo 's nature . He had not asked her to meet him then , but saying that he would return to Matching after Parliament was met , begged her to let him have some means of knowing whether her heart was true to him . She told no one of the letter , but she kept it , and read it over and over again in the silence and solitude of her room . She felt that she was guilty in thus reading it,—even in keeping it from her husband 's knowledge ; but though conscious of this guilt , though resolute almost in its commission , still she determined not to remain at Matching after her husband 's departure,—not to undergo the danger of remaining there while Burgo Fitzgerald should be in the vicinity . She could not analyse her own wishes . She often told herself , as she had told Alice , that it would be better for them all that she should go away ; that in throwing herself even to the dogs , if such must be the result , she would do more of good than of harm . She declared to herself , in the most passionate words she could use , that she loved this man with all her heart . She protested that the fault would not be hers , but theirs , who had forced her to marry the man she did not love . She assured herself that her husband had no affection for her , and that their marriage was in every respect prejudicial to him . She recurred over and over again , in her thoughts , to her own childlessness , and to his extreme desire for an heir . "
194276	194281	194271	194271	I	0	" she would say , "
194303	194487	194488	194488	I	0	" But yet she fled to London because she feared to leave herself at Matching when Burgo Fitzgerald should be there . She sent no answer to his letter . She made no preparation for going with him . She longed to see Alice , to whom alone , since her marriage , had she ever spoken of her love , and intended to tell her the whole tale of that letter . She was as one who , in madness , was resolute to throw herself from a precipice , but to whom some remnant of sanity remained which forced her to seek those who would save her from herself . Mr. Palliser had not seen her since her arrival in London , and , of course , he took her by the hand and kissed her . But it was the embrace of a brother rather than of a lover or a husband . Lady Glencora , with her full woman 's nature , understood this thoroughly , and appreciated by instinct the true bearing of every touch from his hand . "
194494	194498	194488	194488	I	0	" she said . "

194731	194787	194788	194788	I	0	" And there were others , Lady Glencora thought , who could love to lie in the sun , and could look up into the eyes of women , and seek their happiness there . She was sure , at any rate , that she knew one such . But she said nothing of this . "
194797	194820	194788	194788	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . Lord Brock was the name by which the present Jove of the Treasury was known among men . "
194828	194829	194830	194830	He	627	" "
194842	194843	194837	194837	he	627	" "

194889	194964	194878	194878	I	0	" He endeavoured , however , to do so on the present occasion , and gave her a somewhat longer lecture on the working of the British Constitution , and the manner in which British politics evolved themselves , than would have been expected from most young husbands to their young wives under similar circumstances . Lady Glencora yawned , and strove lustily , but ineffectually , to hide her yawn in her handkerchief . "
194977	194983	194968	194968	you	484	" said he , peevishly . "
195033	195034	195029	195029	you	484	" "
195095	195113	195114	195115	Mr. Bott	532	" The next day was a Wednesday , and the House would not sit in the evening . "
195117	195137	195114	195115	Mr. Bott	532	" said Lady Glencora , showing by her voice that she anticipated no pleasure from that gentleman 's company . "

195222	195290	195212	195212	she	548	" But this was too much for Lady Glencora . She was disposed to be mild , but she could not endure to have her two duennas thus brought upon her together on the first day of her arrival in London . And Mrs. Marsham would be worse than Mr. Bott . Mr. Bott would be engaged with Mr. Palliser during the greater part of the evening . "
195294	195298	195291	195291	I	0	" said she , "
195314	195315	195304	195305	Alice Vavasor	337	" "
195319	195324	195316	195317	Miss Vavasor	337	" said the husband . "
195334	195356	195329	195329	I	0	" He was going to make some allusion to that unfortunate hour spent among the ruins , but he stopped himself . "
195368	195373	195359	195359	you	0	" said his wife . "
195391	195392	195388	195388	I	0	" "
195431	195513	195422	195422	you	0	" Lady Glencora was standing , waiting to go away to her own room , but it was absolutely necessary that this matter should be decided before she went . She felt that he was hard to her , and unreasonable , and that he was treating her like a child who should not be allowed her own way in anything . She had endeavoured to please him , and , having failed , was not now disposed to give way . "
195576	195577	195567	195568	Mrs. Marsham	548	" "
195588	195592	195581	195582	Mrs. Marsham	548	" said he . "
195602	195606	195593	195593	Friendships	628	" said she . "
195610	195614	195593	195593	Friendships	628	" said he . "
195642	195898	195635	195635	I	0	" Then he left the room , and she went away to bed . But Lady Glencora was not brought to repentance by her husband 's last words . It seemed to her to be so intolerably cruel , this demand of his , that she should be made to pass the whole of her first evening in town with an old woman for whom it was impossible that she should entertain the slightest regard , that she resolved upon rebellion . Had he positively ordered Mrs. Marsham , she would have sent for that lady , and have contented herself with enduring her presence in disdainful silence ; but Mr. Palliser had not given any order . He had made a request , and a request , from its very nature , admits of no obedience . The compliance with a request must be voluntary , and she would not send for Mrs. Marsham , except upon compulsion . Had not she also made a request to him , and had not he refused it ? It was his prerogative , undoubtedly , to command ; but in that matter of requests she had a right to expect that her voice should be as potent as his own . She wrote a line , therefore , to Alice before she went to bed , begging her cousin to come to her early on the following day , so that they might go out together , and then afterwards dine in company with Mr. Bott . "
195909	195914	195899	195899	I	0	" Lady Glencora said , "
195948	196446	195938	195939	Mrs. Marsham	548	" Then she sat herself down to think,—to think especially about the cruelty of husbands . She had been told over and over again , in the days before her marriage , that Burgo would ill - use her if he became her husband . The Marquis of Auld Reekie had gone so far as to suggest that Burgo might probably beat her . But what hard treatment , even what beating , could be so unendurable as this total want of sympathy , as this deadness in life , which her present lot entailed upon her ? As for that matter of beating , she ridiculed the idea in her very soul . She sat smiling at the absurdity of the thing as she thought of the beauty of Burgo 's eyes , of the softness of his touch , of the loving , almost worshipping , tones of his voice . Would it not even be better to be beaten by him than to have politics explained to her at one o'clock at night by such a husband as Plantagenet Palliser ? The British Constitution , indeed ! Had she married Burgo they would have been in sunny Italy , and he would have told her some other tale than that as they sat together under the pale moonlight . She had a little water - coloured drawing called Raphael and Fornarina , and she was infantine enough to tell herself that the so - called Raphael was like her Burgo — no , not her Burgo , but the Burgo that was not hers . At any rate , all the romance of the picture she might have enjoyed had they allowed her to dispose as she had wished of her own hand . She might have sat in marble balconies , while the vines clustered over her head , and he would have been at her knee , hardly speaking to her , but making his presence felt by the halo of its divinity . He would have called upon her for no hard replies . With him near her she would have enjoyed the soft air , and would have sat happy , without trouble , lapped in the delight of loving . It was thus that Fornarina sat . And why should not such a lot have been hers ? Her Raphael would have loved her , let them say what they would about his cruelty . Poor , wretched , overburthened child , to whom the commonest lessons of life had not yet been taught , and who had now fallen into the hands of one who was so ill - fitted to teach them ! Who would not pity her ? Who could say that the fault was hers ? The world had laden her with wealth till she had had no limb free for its ordinary uses , and then had turned her loose to run her race ! "
196454	196481	196448	196448	you	5207	" her husband asked her the next morning . His voice , as he spoke , clearly showed that his anger was either over or suppressed . "
196521	196522	196512	196513	The man	8761	" "
196526	196544	196512	196513	The man	8761	" said Mr. Palliser , mildly . And then , after a short pause , he added , "
196562	196563	196558	196559	Mrs. Marsham	548	" "
196571	196572	196558	196559	Mrs. Marsham	548	" "
196579	196605	196575	196575	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . And then he added , being ashamed of the tinge of falsehood of which he would otherwise have been guilty , "
196613	196614	196615	196615	She	1051	" "
196622	196627	196615	196615	She	1051	" said Lady Glencora . "
196665	196666	196652	196652	I	0	" "
196677	196692	196674	196674	you	5207	" said the wife , who felt that she could hardly refuse any longer . "
196698	197177	197178	197178	I	0	" said the husband . So Lady Glencora did write to Mrs. Marsham , who promised to come,—as did also Alice Vavasor . Lady Glencora would , at any rate , have Alice to herself for some hours before dinner . At first she took comfort in that reflection ; but after a while she bethought herself that she would not know what to tell Alice , or what not to tell . Did she mean to show that letter to her cousin ? If she did show it , then,—so she argued with herself,—she must bring herself to endure the wretchedness of her present lot , and must give up for ever all her dreams about Raphael and Fornarina . If she did not show it,—or , at any rate , tell of it,—then it would come to pass that she would leave her husband under the protection of another man , and she would become — what she did not dare to name even to herself . She declared that so it must be . She knew that she would go with Burgo , should he ever come to her with the means of going at his and her instant command . But should she bring herself to let Alice know that such a letter had been conveyed to her , Burgo would never have such power . I remember the story of a case of abduction in which a man was tried for his life , and was acquitted , because the lady had acquiesced in the carrying away while it was in progress . She had , as she herself declared , armed herself with a sure and certain charm or talisman against such dangers , which she kept suspended round her neck ; but whilst she was in the post - chaise she opened the window and threw the charm from her , no longer desiring , as the learned counsel for the defence efficiently alleged , to be kept under the bonds of such protection . Lady Glencora 's state of mind was , in its nature , nearly the same as that of the lady in the post - chaise . Whether or no she would use her charm , she had not yet decided , but the power of doing so was still hers . Alice came , and the greeting between the cousins was very affectionate . Lady Glencora received her as though they had been playmates from early childhood ; and Alice , though such impulsive love was not natural to her as to the other , could not bring herself to be cold to one who was so warm to her . Indeed , had she not promised her love in that meeting at Matching Priory in which her cousin had told her of all her wretchedness ? "
197183	197245	197178	197178	I	0	" Alice had said ; and though there was much in Lady Glencora that she could not approve,—much even that she could not bring herself to like,—still she would not allow her heart to contradict her words . They sat so long over the fire in the drawing - room that at last they agreed that the driving should be abandoned . "
197253	197258	197178	197178	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
197285	197310	197274	197274	We	5213	" Alice quite acquiesced in this , having no great desire to be driven through the parks in the gloom of a February afternoon . "

198000	198033	197991	197991	I	0	" said Lady Glencora , in a voice which the servant certainly heard , and which Mrs. Marsham would have heard had she not been a little hard of hearing,—in her bonnet . "
198040	198045	198046	198046	I	0	" said Mrs. Marsham . "
198087	199115	199116	199116	I	0	" and she made a salutation to Alice which was nearly as cold as it could be . Mrs. Marsham was a woman who had many good points . She was poor , and bore her poverty without complaint She was connected by blood and friendship with people rich and titled ; but she paid to none of them egregious respect on account of their wealth or titles . She was staunch in her friendships , and staunch in her enmities . She was no fool , and knew well what was going on in the world . She could talk about the last novel , or — if need be — about the Constitution . She had been a true wife , though sometimes too strong - minded , and a painstaking mother , whose children , however , had never loved her as most mothers like to be loved . The catalogue of her faults must be quite as long as that of her virtues . She was one of those women who are ambitious of power , and not very scrupulous as to the manner in which they obtain it . She was hardhearted , and capable of pursuing an object without much regard to the injury she might do . She would not flatter wealth or fawn before a title , but she was not above any artifice by which she might ingratiate herself with those whom it suited her purpose to conciliate . She thought evil rather than good . She was herself untrue in action , if not absolutely in word . I do not say that she would coin lies , but she would willingly leave false impressions . She had been the bosom friend , and in many things the guide in life , of Mr. Palliser 's mother ; and she took a special interest in Mr. Palliser 's welfare . When he married , she heard the story of the loves of Burgo and Lady Glencora ; and though she thought well of the money , she was not disposed to think very well of the bride . She made up her mind that the young lady would want watching , and she was of opinion that no one would be so well able to watch Lady Glencora as herself . She had not plainly opened her mind on this matter to Mr. Palliser ; she had not made any distinct suggestion to him that she would act as Argus to his wife . Mr. Palliser would have rejected any such suggestion , and Mrs. Marsham knew that he would do so ; but she had let a word or two drop , hinting that Lady Glencora was very young,—hinting that Lady Glencora 's manners were charming in their childlike simplicity ; but hinting also that precaution was , for that reason , the more necessary . Mr. Palliser , who suspected nothing as to Burgo or as to any other special peril , whose whole disposition was void of suspicion , whose dry nature realized neither the delights nor the dangers of love , acknowledged that Glencora was young . He especially wished that she should be discreet and matronly ; he feared no lovers , but he feared that she might do silly things,—that she would catch cold,—and not know how to live a life becoming the wife of a Chancellor of the Exchequer . Therefore he submitted Glencora,—and , to a certain extent , himself,—into the hands of Mrs. Marsham . Lady Glencora had not been twenty - four hours in the house with this lady before she recognized in her a duenna . In all such matters no one could be quicker than Lady Glencora . She might be very ignorant about the British Constitution , and , alas ! very ignorant also as to the real elements of right and wrong in a woman 's conduct , but she was no fool . She had an eye that could see , and an ear that could understand , and an abundance of that feminine instinct which teaches a woman to know her friend or her enemy at a glance , at a touch , at a word . In many things Lady Glencora was much quicker , much more clever , than her husband , though he was to be Chancellor of the Exchequer , and though she did know nothing of the Constitution . She knew , too , that he was easily to be deceived,—that though his intelligence was keen , his instincts were dull,—that he was gifted with no fineness of touch , with no subtle appreciation of the characters of men and women ; and , to a certain extent , she looked down upon him for his obtusity . He should have been aware that Burgo was a danger to be avoided ; and he should have been aware also that Mrs. Marsham was a duenna not to be employed . When a woman knows that she is guarded by a watch - dog , she is bound to deceive her Cerberus , if it be possible , and is usually not ill - disposed to deceive also the owner of Cerberus . Lady Glencora felt that Mrs. Marsham was her Cerberus , and she was heartily resolved that if she was to be kept in the proper line at all , she would not be so kept by Mrs. Marsham . Alice rose and accepted Mrs. Marsham 's salutation quite as coldly as it had been given , and from that time forward those two ladies were enemies . Mrs. Marsham , groping quite in the dark , partly guessed that Alice had in some way interfered to prevent Lady Glencora 's visit to Monkshade , and , though such prevention was , no doubt , good in that lady 's eyes , she resented the interference . She had made up her mind that Alice was not the sort of friend that Lady Glencora should have about her . Alice recognized and accepted the feud . "
199125	199130	199118	199118	I	0	" said Mrs. Marsham , "
199151	199214	199217	199217	you	5234	" and Mrs. Marsham shook her head . She was a little woman , with sharp small eyes , with a permanent colour in her face , and two short , crisp , grey curls at each side of her face ; always well dressed , always in good health , and , as Lady Glencora believed , altogether incapable of fatigue . "

199413	199502	199402	199403	Mr. Bott	532	" There was no mistaking the meaning of this . There was no pretending even to mistake it . Now , Mrs. Marsham had accepted the right hand of fellowship from Mr. Bott,—not because she especially liked him , but in compliance with the apparent necessities of Mr. Palliser 's position . Mr. Bott had made good his ground about Mr. Palliser ; and Mrs. Marsham , as she was not strong enough to turn him off from it , had given him the right hand of fellowship . "
199521	199526	199517	199518	Mr. Palliser	485	" said Mrs. Marsham . "

199761	199788	199756	199756	he	5245	" said Mrs. Marsham ; and the words , the tone , and the innuendo together were more than Alice was able to bear with equanimity . "
199791	199800	199789	199789	Glencora	488	" said she , rising from her chair , "
199838	199848	199828	199828	his	5245	" But Lady Glencora would not let her go . "
199853	199857	199851	199851	Alice	337	" she said . "

199982	200084	199973	199973	I	0	" said Mrs. Marsham , looking at her very grimly . Alice merely bowed her head . She had been offended , and she would not deny it . After that , Mrs. Marsham took herself off , saying that she would be back to dinner . She was angry , but not unhappy . She thought that she could put down Miss Vavasor , and she was prepared to bear a good deal from Lady Glencora — for Mr. Palliser 's sake , as she said to herself , with some attempt at a sentimental remembrance of her old friend . "
200092	200140	200141	200141	She	5253	" said Lady Glencora , as soon as the door was closed ; and she said these words with so droll a voice , with such a childlike shaking of her head , with so much comedy in her grimace , that Alice could not but laugh . "
200144	200149	200141	200141	She	5253	" said Lady Glencora . "
200210	200211	200199	200199	her	5253	" "

200494	200624	200481	200481	I	0	" After that , Lady Glencora felt no further inclination to show Burgo 's letter to Alice on that occasion . They sat over the drawing - room fire , talking chiefly of Alice 's affairs , till it was time for them to dress . But Alice , though she spoke much of Mr. Grey , said no word as to her engagement with George Vavasor . How could she speak of it , inasmuch as she had already resolved,—already almost resolved,—that that engagement also should be broken ? Alice , when she came down to the drawing - room , before dinner , found Mr. Bott there alone . She had dressed more quickly than her friend , and Mr. Palliser had not yet made his appearance . "
200639	200670	200625	200625	I	0	" he said , as he came up , offering his hand . She gave him her hand , and then sat down , merely muttering some word of reply . "

200695	200696	200687	200687	I	0	" "

200910	201316	201317	201317	I	0	" Alice was going to protest that she had never seen it at all , when Mr. Palliser entered the room along with Mrs. Marsham . The two gentlemen shook hands , and then Mr. Palliser turned to Alice . She perceived at once by his face that she was unwelcome , and wished herself away from his house . It might be all very well for Lady Glencora to fight with Mrs. Marsham,—and with her husband , too , in regard to the Marsham persecution,—but there could be no reason why she should do so . He just touched her hand , barely closing his thumb upon her fingers , and asked her how she was . Then he turned away from her side of the fire , and began talking to Mrs. Marsham on the other . There was that in his face and in his manner which was positively offensive to her . He made no allusion to his former acquaintance with her,—spoke no word about Matching , no word about his wife , as he would naturally have done to his wife 's friend . Alice felt the blood mount into her face , and regretted greatly that she had ever come among these people . Had she not long since made up her mind that she would avoid her great relations , and did not all this prove that it would have been well for her to have clung to that resolution ? What was Lady Glencora to her that she should submit herself to be treated as though she were a poor companion,—a dependent , who received a salary for her attendance,—an indigent cousin , hanging on to the bounty of her rich connection ? Alice was proud to a fault . She had nursed her pride till it was very faulty . All her troubles and sorrows in life had come from an overfed craving for independence . Why , then , should she submit to be treated with open want of courtesy by any man ; but , of all men , why should she submit to it from such a one as Mr. Palliser,—the heir of a ducal house , rolling in wealth , and magnificent with all the magnificence of British pomp and pride ? No ; she would make Lady Glencora understand that the close intimacies of daily life were not possible to them ! "
201325	201336	201317	201317	I	0	" said Lady Glencora , as she entered the room . "
201364	201945	201359	201360	Mrs. Marsham	548	" Mrs. Marsham was all smiles and forgiveness , and hoped that Lady Glencora would not make a stranger of her . Then dinner was announced , and Alice had to walk down stairs by herself . She did not care a doit for that , but there had been a disagreeable little contest when the moment came . Lady Glencora had wished to give up Mr. Bott to her cousin , but Mr. Bott had stuck manfully to Lady Glencora 's side . He hoped to take Lady Glencora down to dinner very often , and was not at all disposed to abate his privilege . During dinner - time Alice said very little , nor was there given to her opportunity of saying much . She could not but think of the day of her first arrival at Matching Priory , when she had sat between the Duke of St. Bungay and Jeffrey Palliser , and when everybody had been so civil to her ! She now occupied one side of the table by herself , away from the fire , where she felt cold and desolate in the gloom of the large half - lighted room . Mr. Palliser occupied himself with Mrs. Marsham , who talked politics to him ; and Mr. Bott never lost a moment in his endeavours to say some civil word to Lady Glencora . Lady Glencora gave him no encouragement ; but she hardly dared to snub him openly in her husband 's immediate presence . Twenty times during dinner she said some little word to Alice , attempting at first to make the time pleasant , and then , when the matter was too far gone for that , attempting to give some relief . But it was of no avail . There are moments in which conversation seems to be impossible,—in which the very gods interfere to put a seal upon the lips of the unfortunate one . It was such a moment now with Alice . She had never as yet been used to snubbing . Whatever position she had hitherto held , in that she had always stood foremost,—much more so than had been good for her . When she had gone to Matching , she had trembled for her position ; but there all had gone well with her ; there Lady Glencora 's kindness had at first been able to secure for her a reception that had been flattering , and almost better than flattering . Jeffrey Palliser had been her friend , and would , had she so willed it , have been more than her friend . But now she felt that the halls of the Pallisers were too cold for her , and that the sooner she escaped from their gloom and hard discourtesy the better for her . Mrs. Marsham , when the three ladies had returned to the drawing - room together , was a little triumphant . She felt that she had put Alice down ; and with the energetic prudence of a good general who knows that he should follow up a victory , let the cost of doing so be what it may , she determined to keep her down . Alice had resolved that she would come as seldom as might be to Mr. Palliser 's house in Park Lane . That resolution on her part was in close accordance with Mrs. Marsham 's own views . "
201954	201958	201947	201948	Miss Vavasor	337	" she asked . "
201981	201982	201359	201360	Mrs. Marsham	548	" "

202085	202090	202070	202070	she	337	" said Mrs. Marsham ; "

202113	202120	202105	202106	No gentleman	5278	" said Lady Glencora , savagely ; "
202134	202268	202269	202269	I	0	" It was not often that Lady Glencora made any allusion to her own property , or allowed any one near her to suppose that she remembered the fact that her husband 's great wealth was , in truth , her wealth . As to many matters her mind was wrong . In some things her taste was not delicate as should be that of a woman . But , as regarded her money , no woman could have behaved with greater reticence , or a purer delicacy . But now , when she was twitted by her husband 's special friend with ill - usage to her husband 's horses , because she chose to send her own friend home in her own carriage , she did find it hard to bear .

202542	202893	202520	202520	us	5286	" The gentlemen did not return to the drawing - room that evening , having , no doubt , joint work to do in arranging the great financial calculations of the nation ; and , at an early hour , Alice was taken home in Lady Glencora 's brougham , leaving her cousin still in the hands of Mrs. Marsham . March came , and still the Chancellor of the Exchequer held his position . In the early days of March there was given in the House a certain parliamentary explanation on the subject , which , however , did not explain very much to any person . A statement was made which was declared by the persons making it to be altogether satisfactory , but nobody else seemed to find any satisfaction in it . The big wigs of the Cabinet had made an arrangement which , from the language used by them on this occasion , they must be supposed to have regarded as hardly less permanent than the stars ; but everybody else protested that the Government was going to pieces ; and Mr. Bott was heard to declare in clubs and lobbies , and wherever he could get a semi - public , political hearing , that this kind of thing would n't do . Lord Brock must either blow hot or cold . If he chose to lean upon Mr. Palliser , he might lean upon him , and Mr. Palliser would not be found wanting . In such case no opposition could touch Lord Brock or the Government . That was Mr. Bott 's opinion . But if Lord Brock did not so choose , why , in that case , he must expect that Mr. Palliser , and Mr. Palliser 's friends , would—. Mr. Bott did not say what they would do ; but he was supposed by those who understood the matter to hint at an Opposition lobby , and adverse divisions , and to threaten Lord Brock with the open enmity of Mr. Palliser,—and of Mr. Palliser 's great follower . "
202906	202941	202903	202903	you	5288	" repeated Mr. Bott for the second or third time , as he stood upon the rug before the fire at his club , with one or two of his young friends around him . "

203348	203370	203339	203341	men in power	5304	" And Mr. Bott made an action with his hand as though he were drawing up beer from a patent tap . "
203385	203412	203372	203372	you	5298	" said the young Member , who had been presented , and whose mother 's old - world notions about the throne still clung to him . "
203419	203424	203413	203413	I	0	" said Mr. Bott ; "
203430	203448	203425	203425	I	0	" With all his constitutional love , Mr. Bott did not know what the word republican meant . "
203512	203513	203515	203515	you	5298	" "

203578	203613	203576	203576	himself	627	" In the meantime the election came on in the Chelsea districts , and the whole of the south - western part of the metropolis was covered with posters bearing George Vavasor 's name . "
203622	203763	203576	203576	himself	627	" That was the cry with which he went to the electors ; and though it must be presumed that it was understood by some portion of the Chelsea electors , it was perfectly unintelligible to the majority of those who read it . His special acquaintances and his general enemies called him Viscount Riverbank , and he was pestered on all sides by questions as to Father Thames . It was Mr. Scruby who invented the legend , and who gave George Vavasor an infinity of trouble by the invention . There was a question in those days as to embanking the river from the Houses of Parliament up to the remote desolations of further Pimlico , and Mr. Scruby recommended the coming Member to pledge himself that he would have the work carried on even to Battersea Bridge . "
203770	203775	203764	203764	You	5316	" pleaded Mr. Scruby . "

203918	203936	203956	203957	the figures	5324	" and Mr. Scruby almost became eloquent as he explained the nature of a good parliamentary subject . "
204057	204079	204080	204080	Vavasor	357	" Vavasor allowed Mr. Scruby to manage the matter for him , and took up the subject of the River Bank . "
204085	204153	204080	204080	Vavasor	357	" was carried about by an army of men with iron shoulder - straps , and huge pasteboard placards six feet high on the top of them . You would think , as you saw the long rows , that the men were being marshalled to their several routes ; but they always kept together — four - and - twenty at the heels of each other . "
204164	204176	204080	204080	Vavasor	357	" said Mr. Vavasor , counting the expense up to himself . "
204184	204191	204080	204080	Vavasor	357	" said Mr. Scruby in reply . "
204217	204227	204289	204289	he	5329	" And then sides of houses were covered with that shibboleth—"Vavasor
204231	204287	204289	204289	he	5329	Bank"—the same words repeated in columns down the whole sides of houses . Vavasor himself declared that he was ashamed to walk among his future constituents , so conspicuous had his name become . Grimes saw it , and was dismayed . At first , Grimes ridiculed the cry with all his publican 's wit . "
204316	204349	204304	204304	he	5329	" said Grimes , as he canvassed for the other Liberal candidate . But , after a while , Grimes was driven to confess that Mr. Scruby knew what he was about . "
204361	204370	204358	204358	he	5329	" said Grimes in the inside bar of the "
204374	204780	204358	204358	he	5329	" and he almost regretted that he had left the leadership of Mr. Scruby , although he knew that on this occasion he would not have gotten his odd money . George Vavasor , with much labour , actually did get up the subject of the River Bank . He got himself introduced to men belonging to the Metropolitan Board , and went manfully into the matter of pounds , shillings , and pence . He was able even to work himself into an apparent heat when he was told that the thing was out of the question ; and soon found that he had disciples who really believed in him . If he could have brought himself to believe in the thing,—if he could have been induced himself to care whether Chelsea was to be embanked or no , the work would not have been so difficult to him . In that case it would have done good to him , if to no one else . But such belief was beyond him . He had gone too far in life to be capable of believing in , or of caring for , such things . He was ambitious of having a hand in the government of his country , but he was not capable of caring even for that . But he worked . He worked hard , and spoke vehemently , and promised the men of Chelsea , Pimlico , and Brompton that the path of London westwards had hardly commenced as yet . Sloane Street should be the new Cheapside . Squares should arise around the Chelsea barracks , with sides open to the water , for which Belgravia would be deserted . There should be palaces there for the rich , because the rich spend their riches ; but no rich man 's palace should interfere with the poor man 's right to the River Bank . Three millions and a half should be spent on the noble street to be constructed , the grandest pathway that the world should ever yet have seen ; three millions and a half to be drawn from,—to be drawn from anywhere except from Chelsea;—from the bloated money - bags of the City Corporation , Vavasor once ventured to declare , amidst the encouraging shouts of the men of Chelsea . Mr. Scruby was forced to own that his pupil worked the subject well . "
204790	205460	204358	204358	he	5329	" he said , almost patting Vavasor on the back , after a speech in which he had vehemently asserted that his ambition to represent the Chelsea districts had all come of his long - fixed idea that the glory of future London would be brought about by the embankment of the river at Chelsea . But armies of men carrying big boards , and public - houses open at every corner , and placards in which the letters are three feet long , cost money . Those few modest hundreds which Mr. Scruby had already received before the work began , had been paid on the supposition that the election would not take place till September . Mr. Scruby made an early request , a very early request , that a further sum of fifteen hundred pounds should be placed in his hands ; and he did this in a tone which clearly signified that not a man would be sent about through the streets , or a poster put upon a wall , till this request had been conceded . Mr. Scruby was in possession of two very distinct manners of address . In his jovial moods , when he was instigating his clients to fight their battles well , it might almost be thought that he was doing it really for the love of the thing ; and some clients , so thinking , had believed for a few hours that Scruby , in his jolly , passionate eagerness , would pour out his own money like dust , trusting implicitly to future days for its return . But such clients had soon encountered Mr. Scruby 's other manner , and had perceived that they were mistaken . The thing had come so suddenly upon George Vavasor that there was not time for him to carry on his further operations through his sister . Had he written to Kate,—let him have written in what language he would,—she would have first rejoined by a negative , and there would have been a correspondence before he had induced her to comply . He thought of sending for her by telegram , but even in that there would have been too much delay . He resolved , therefore , to make his application to Alice himself , and he wrote to her , explaining his condition . The election had come upon him quite suddenly , as she knew , he said . He wanted two thousand pounds instantly , and felt little scruple in asking her for it , as he was aware that the old Squire would be only too glad to saddle the property with a legacy to Alice for the repayment of this money , though he would not have advanced a shilling himself for the purpose of the election . Then he said a word or two as to his prolonged absence from Queen Anne Street . He had not been there because he had felt , from her manner when they last met , that she would for a while prefer to be left free from the unavoidable excitement of such interviews . But should he be triumphant in his present contest , he should go to her to share his triumph with her ; or , should he fail , he should go to her to console him in his failure . Within three days he heard from her , saying that the money would be at once placed to his credit . She sent him also her candid good wishes for success in his enterprise , but beyond this her letter said nothing . There was no word of love,—no word of welcome,—no expression of a desire to see him . Vavasor , as he perceived all this in the reading of her note , felt a triumph in the possession of her money . She was ill - using him by her coldness , and there was comfort in revenge . "
205466	205472	205473	205473	She	5331	" he said to himself . "
205497	205745	205481	205481	she	5331	" When Mr. Tombe had communicated with John Grey on the matter of this increased demand,—this demand which Mr. Tombe began to regard as carrying a love - affair rather too far,—Grey had telegraphed back that Vavasor 's demand for money , if made through Mr. John Vavasor , was to be honoured to the extent of five thousand pounds . Mr. Tombe raised his eyebrows , and reflected that some men were very foolish . But John Grey 's money matters were of such a nature as to make Mr. Tombe know that he must do as he was bidden ; and the money was paid to George Vavasor 's account . He told Kate nothing of this . Why should he trouble himself to do so ? Indeed , at this time he wrote no letters to his sister , though she twice sent to him , knowing what his exigencies would be , and made further tenders of her own money . He could not reply to these offers without telling her that money had been forthcoming from that other quarter , and so he left them unanswered . In the meantime the battle went on gloriously . Mr. Travers , the other Liberal candidate , spent his money freely,—or else some other person did so on his behalf . When Mr. Scruby mentioned this last alternative to George Vavasor , George cursed his own luck in that he had never found such backers . "
205763	205771	205772	205772	He	813	" said Mr. Scruby , comforting him . "
205821	205984	205817	205817	I	0	" Mr. Grimes went to work strenuously , almost fiercely , in the opposite interest , telling all that he knew , and perhaps more than he knew , of Vavasor 's circumstances . He was at work morning , noon , and night , not only in his own neighbourhood , but among those men on the river bank of whom he had spoken so much in his interview with Vavasor in Cecil Street . The entire Vavasorian army with its placards was entirely upset on more than one occasion , and was once absolutely driven ignominiously into the river mud . And all this was done under the direction of Mr. Grimes . Vavasor himself was pelted with offal from the sinking tide , so that the very name of the River Bank became odious to him . He was a man who did not like to have his person touched , and when they hustled him he became angry . "
205992	205996	205989	205990	Mr. Vavasor	357	" said Scruby , "
206047	206119	206038	206038	I	0	" And Mr. Scruby at last did as much for George Vavasor as he had done for the hero of the Hamlets . At the close of the poll Vavasor 's name stood at the head by a considerable majority , and Scruby comforted him by saying that Travers certainly would n't stand the expense of a petition , as the seat was to be held only for a few months . "
206131	206135	206121	206121	you	5337	" said Scruby , "
206204	207772	206192	206193	the fellows	11187	" A further sum of thirteen hundred pounds was wanted at once , and then the whole thing was to be repeated over again in six months ' time ! This was not consolatory . But , nevertheless , there was a triumph in the thing itself which George Vavasor was man enough to enjoy . It would be something to have sat in the House of Commons , though it should only have been for half a session . George Vavasor 's feeling of triumph was not unjustifiable . It is something to have sat in the House of Commons , though it has been but for one session ! There is on the left - hand side of our great national hall,—on the left - hand side as one enters it , and opposite to the doors leading to the Law Courts,—a pair of gilded lamps , with a door between them , near to which a privileged old dame sells her apples and her oranges solely , as I presume , for the accommodation of the Members of the House and of the great policeman who guards the pass . Between those lamps is the entrance to the House of Commons , and none but Members may go that way ! It is the only gate before which I have ever stood filled with envy,—sorrowing to think that my steps might never pass under it . There are many portals forbidden to me , as there are many forbidden to all men ; and forbidden fruit , they say , is sweet ; but my lips have watered after no other fruit but that which grows so high , within the sweep of that great policeman 's truncheon . Ah , my male friend and reader , who earnest thy bread , perhaps , as a country vicar ; or sittest , may - be , at some weary desk in Somerset House ; or who , perhaps , rulest the yard behind the Cheapside counter , hast thou never stood there and longed,—hast thou never confessed , when standing there , that Fate has been unkind to thee in denying thee the one thing that thou hast wanted ? I have done so ; and as my slow steps have led me up that more than royal staircase , to those passages and halls which require the hallowing breath of centuries to give them the glory in British eyes which they shall one day possess , I have told myself , in anger and in grief , that to die and not to have won that right of way , though but for a session,—not to have passed by the narrow entrance through those lamps,—is to die and not to have done that which it most becomes an Englishman to have achieved . There are , doubtless , some who come out by that road , the loss of whose society is not to be regretted . England does not choose her six hundred and fifty - four best men . One comforts one 's self , sometimes , with remembering that . The George Vavasors , the Calder Joneses , and the Botts are admitted . Dishonesty , ignorance , and vulgarity do not close the gate of that heaven against aspirants ; and it is a consolation to the ambition of the poor to know that the ambition of the rich can attain that glory by the strength of its riches alone . But though England does not send thither none but her best men , the best of her Commoners do find their way there . It is the highest and most legitimate pride of an Englishman to have the letters M.P. written after his name . No selection from the alphabet , no doctorship , no fellowship , be it of ever so learned or royal a society , no knightship,—not though it be of the Garter,—confers so fair an honour . Mr. Bott was right when he declared that this country is governed from between the walls of that House , though the truth was almost defiled by the lips which uttered it . He might have added that from thence flow the waters of the world 's progress,—the fullest fountain of advancing civilization . George Vavasor , as he went in by the lamps and the apple - stall , under the guardianship of Mr. Bott , felt all the pride of which I have been speaking . He was a man quite capable of feeling such pride as it should be felt,—capable , in certain dreamy moments , of looking at the thing with pure and almost noble eyes ; of understanding the ambition of serving with truth so great a nation as that which fate had made his own . Nature , I think , had so fashioned George Vavasor , that he might have been a good , and perhaps a great man ; whereas Mr. Bott had been born small . Vavasor had educated himself to badness with his eyes open . He had known what was wrong , and had done it , having taught himself to think that bad things were best . But poor Mr. Bott had meant to do well , and thought that he had done very well indeed . He was a tuft - hunter and a toady , but he did not know that he was doing amiss in seeking to rise by tuft - hunting and toadying . He was both mean and vain , both a bully and a coward , and in politics , I fear , quite unscrupulous in spite of his grand dogmas ; but he believed that he was progressing in public life by the proper and usual means , and was troubled by no idea that he did wrong . Vavasor , in those dreamy moments of which I have spoken , would sometimes feel tempted to cut his throat and put an end to himself , because he knew that he had taught himself amiss . Again he would sadly ask himself whether it was yet too late ; always , however , answering himself that it was too late . Even now , at this moment , as he went in between the lamps , and felt much of the honest pride of which I have spoken , he told himself that it was too late . What could he do now , hampered by such a debt as that which he owed to his cousin , and with the knowledge that it must be almost indefinitely increased , unless he meant to give up this seat in Parliament , which had cost him so dearly , almost before he had begun to enjoy it ? But his courage was good , and he was able to resolve that he would go on with the business that he had in hand , and play out his game to the end . He had achieved his seat in the House of Commons , and was so far successful . Men who had ever been gracious to him were now more gracious than ever , and they who had not hitherto treated him with courtesy , now began to smile and to be very civil . It was , no doubt , a great thing to have the privilege of that entrance between the lamps . Mr. Bott had the new Member now in hand , not because there had been any old friendship between them , but Mr. Bott was on the look - out for followers , and Vavasor was on the look - out for a party . A man gets no great thanks for attaching himself to existing power . Our friend might have enrolled himself among the general supporters of the Government without attracting much attention . He would in such case have been at the bottom of a long list . But Mr. Palliser was a rising man , round whom , almost without wish of his own , a party was forming itself . If he came into power,—as come he must , according to Mr. Bott and many others,—then they who had acknowledged the new light before its brightness had been declared , might expect their reward . Vavasor , as he passed through the lobby to the door of the House , leaning on Mr. Bott 's arm , was very silent . He had spoken but little since they had left their cab in Palace Yard , and was not very well pleased by the garrulity of his companion . He was going to sit among the first men of his nation , and to take his chance of making himself one of them . He believed in his own ability ; he believed thoroughly in his own courage ; but he did not believe in his own conduct . He feared that he had done,—feared still more strongly that he would be driven to do,—that which would shut men 's ears against his words , and would banish him from high places . No man believes in himself who knows himself to be a rascal , however great may be his talent , or however high his pluck . "
207781	207786	207775	207775	you	5341	" said Mr. Bott . "
207789	207799	207775	207775	you	5341	" answered Vavasor , who wished to remain silent . "
207804	207805	207775	207775	you	5341	" "
207808	207809	207775	207775	you	5341	" "
207995	208019	207986	207986	I	0	" and Bott bowed low to a lord who was hurrying through the lobby as fast as his shuffling feet would carry him . "
208026	208046	208022	208022	you	641	" Vavasor , however , did not know the lord in question , and was obliged to say so . "
208057	208061	208049	208049	you	641	" said Bott . "
208074	208085	208067	208067	I	0	" said Vavasor , with a curl on his lip . "
208199	209352	208188	208189	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Our friend was thus introduced to the doorkeeper , who smiled familiarly , and seemed to wink his eye . Then George Vavasor passed through into the House itself , under the wing of Mr. Bott . Vavasor , as he walked up the House to the Clerk 's table and took the oath and then walked down again , felt himself to be almost taken aback by the little notice which was accorded to him . It was not that he had expected to create a sensation , or that he had for a moment thought on the subject , but the thing which he was doing was so great to him , that the total indifference of those around him was a surprise to him . After he had taken his seat , a few men came up by degrees and shook hands with him ; but it seemed , as they did so , merely because they were passing that way . He was anxious not to sit next to Mr. Bott , but he found himself unable to avoid this contiguity . That gentleman stuck to him pertinaciously , giving him directions which , at the spur of the moment , he hardly knew how not to obey . So he found himself sitting behind Mr. Palliser , a little to the right , while Mr. Bott occupied the ear of the rising man . There was a debate in progress , but it seemed to Vavasor , as soon as he was able to become critical , to be but a dull affair , and yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer was on his legs , and Mr. Palliser was watching him as a cat watches a mouse . The speaker was full of figures , as becomes a Chancellor of the Exchequer ; and as every new budget of them fell from him , Mr. Bott , with audible whispers , poured into the ear of his chief certain calculations of his own , most of which went to prove that the financier in office was altogether wrong . Vavasor thought that he could see that Mr. Palliser was receiving more of his assistance than was palatable to him . He would listen , if he did listen , without making any sign that he heard , and would occasionally shake his head with symptoms of impatience . But Mr. Bott was a man not to be repressed by a trifle . When Mr. Palliser shook his head he became more assiduous than ever , and when Mr. Palliser slightly moved himself to the left , he boldly followed him . No general debate arose on the subject which the Minister had in hand , and when he sat down , Mr. Palliser would not get up , though Mr. Bott counselled him to do so . The matter was over for the night , and the time had arrived for Lord Middlesex . That nobleman got upon his feet , with a roll of papers in his hand , and was proceeding to address the House on certain matters of church reform , with great energy ; but , alas , for him and for his feelings ! before his energy had got itself into full swing , the Members were swarming away through the doors like a flock of sheep . Mr. Palliser got up and went , and was followed at once by Mr. Bott , who succeeded in getting hold of his arm in the lobby . Had not Mr. Palliser been an even - tempered , calculating man , with a mind and spirit well under his command , he must have learned to hate Mr. Bott before this time . Away streamed the Members , but still the noble lord went on speaking , struggling hard to keep up his fire as though no such exodus were in process . There was but little to console him . He knew that the papers would not report one sentence in twenty of those he uttered . He knew that no one would listen to him willingly . He knew that he had worked for weeks and months to get up his facts , and he was beginning to know that he had worked in vain . As he summoned courage to look round , he began to fear that some enemy would count the House , and that all would be over . He had given heart and soul to this affair . His cry was not as Vavasor 's cry about the River Bank . He believed in his own subject with a great faith , thinking that he could make men happier and better , and bring them nearer to their God . I said that he had worked for weeks and months . I might have said that he had been all his life at this work . Though he shuffled with his feet when he walked , and knocked his words together when he talked , he was an earnest man , meaning to do well , seeking no other reward for his work than the appreciation of those whom he desired to serve . But this was never to be his . For him there was in store nothing but disappointment . And yet he will work on to the end , either in this House or in the other , labouring wearily , without visible wages of any kind , and , one may say , very sadly . But when he has been taken to his long rest , men will acknowledge that he has done something , and there will be left on the minds of those who shall remember him a conviction that he served a good cause diligently , and not altogether inefficiently . Invisible are his wages , yet in some coin are they paid . Invisible is the thing he does , and yet it is done . Let us hope that some sense of this tardy appreciation may soothe his spirit beyond the grave . On the present occasion there was nothing to soothe his spirit . The Speaker sat , urbane and courteous , with his eyes turned towards the unfortunate orator ; but no other ears in the House seemed to listen to him . The corps of reporters had dwindled down to two , and they used their pens very listlessly , taking down here a sentence and there a sentence , knowing that their work was naught . Vavasor sat it out to the last , as it taught him a lesson in those forms of the House which Mr. Bott had truly told him it would be well that he should learn . And at last he did learn the form of a "
209357	210488	208188	208189	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Some one from a back seat muttered something , which the Speaker understood ; and that high officer , having had his attention called to a fact of which he would never have taken cognizance without such calling , did count the House , and finding that it contained but twenty - three Members , he put an end to his own labours and to those of poor Lord Middlesex . With what feelings that noble lord must have taken himself home , and sat himself down in his study , vainly opening a book before his eyes , can we not all imagine ? A man he was with ample means , with children who would do honour to his name ; one whose wife believed in him , if no one else would do so ; a man , let us say , with a clear conscience , to whom all good things had been given . But of whom now was he thinking with envy ? Early on that same day Farringcourt had spoken in the House,—a man to whom no one would lend a shilling , whom the privilege of that House kept out of gaol , whose word no man believed ; who was wifeless , childless , and unloved . But three hundred men had hung listening upon his words . When he laughed in his speech , they laughed ; when he was indignant against the Minister , they sat breathless , as the Spaniard sits in the critical moment of the bull - killing . Whichever way he turned himself , he carried them with him . Crowds of Members flocked into the House from libraries and smoking - rooms when it was known that this ne'er - do - well was on his legs . The Strangers ' Gallery was filled to overflowing . The reporters turned their rapid pages , working their fingers wearily till the sweat drops stood upon their brows . And as the Premier was attacked with some special impetus of redoubled irony , men declared that he would be driven to enrol the speaker among his colleagues , in spite of dishonoured bills and evil reports . A man who could shake the thunderbolts like that must be paid to shake them on the right side . It was of this man , and of his success , that Lord Middlesex was envious , as he sat , wretched and respectable , in his solitary study ! Mr. Bott had left the House with Mr. Palliser ; and Vavasor , after the count - out , was able to walk home by himself , and think of the position which he had achieved . He told himself over and over again that he had done a great thing in obtaining that which he now possessed , and he endeavoured to teach himself that the price he was paying for it was not too dear . But already there had come upon him something of that feeling,—that terribly human feeling,—which deprives every prize that is gained of half its value . The mere having it robs the diamond of its purity , and mixes vile alloy with the gold . Lord Middlesex , as he had floundered on into terrible disaster , had not been a subject to envy . There had been nothing of brilliance in the debate , and the Members had loomed no larger than ordinary men at ordinary clubs . The very doorkeepers had hardly treated them with respect . The great men with whose names the papers are filled had sat silent , gloomy , and apparently idle . As soon as a fair opportunity was given them they escaped out of the House , as boys might escape from school . Everybody had rejoiced in the break - up of the evening , except that one poor old lord who had worked so hard . Vavasor had spent everything that he had to become a Member of that House , and now , as he went alone to his lodgings , he could not but ask himself whether the thing purchased was worth the purchase - money . But his courage was still high . Though he was gloomy , and almost sad , he knew that he could trust himself to fight out the battle to the last . On the morrow he would go to Queen Anne Street , and would demand sympathy there from her who had professed to sympathize with him so strongly in his political desires . With her , at any rate , the glory of his Membership would not be dimmed by any untoward knowledge of the realities . She had only seen the play acted from the boxes ; and to her eyes the dresses would still be of silk velvet , and the swords of bright steel . When Alice heard of her cousin 's success , and understood that he was actually Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts , she resolved that she would be triumphant . She had sacrificed nearly everything to her desire for his success in public life , and now that he had achieved the first great step towards that success , it would have been madness on her part to decline her share in the ovation . If she could not rejoice in that , what source of joy would then be left for her ? She had promised to be his wife , and at present she was under the bonds of that promise . She had so promised because she had desired to identify her interests with his,—because she wished to share his risks , to assist his struggles , and to aid him in his public career . She had done all this , and he had been successful . She strove , therefore , to be triumphant on his behalf , but she knew that she was striving ineffectually . She had made a mistake , and the days were coming in which she would have to own to herself that she had done so in sackcloth , and to repent with ashes . But yet she struggled to be triumphant . The tidings were first brought to her by her servant , and then she at once sat down to write him a word or two of congratulation . But she found the task more difficult than she had expected , and she gave it up . She had written no word to him since the day on which he had left her almost in anger , and now she did not know how she was to address him . "
210496	210509	210489	210489	I	0	" she said , putting away from her the paper and pens . "
210520	210655	210656	210656	I	0	" But she wrote to Kate , and contrived to put some note of triumph into her letter . Kate had written to her at length , filling her sheet with a loud pæan of sincere rejoicing . To Kate , down in Westmoreland , it had seemed that her brother had already done everything . He had already tied Fortune to his chariot wheels . He had made the great leap , and had overcome the only obstacle that Fate had placed in his way . In her great joy she almost forgot whence had come the money with which the contest had been won . She was not enthusiastic in many things;—about herself she was never so ; but now she was elated with an enthusiasm which seemed to know no bounds . "
210660	210670	210656	210656	I	0	" she said , in her letter to Alice . "
210733	210745	210770	210770	I	0	wit"—she had , in truth , forgotten Alice 's money as she wrote;—"that
210792	210860	210785	210785	you	337	" Poor girl ! One can not but like her pride , nay , almost love her for it , though it was so sorely misplaced . It must be remembered that she had known nothing of Messrs. Grimes and Scruby , and the River Bank , and that the means had been wanting to her of learning the principles upon which some metropolitan elections are conducted . "
210875	210876	210877	210877	He	11066	" "
210883	210889	210877	210877	He	11066	" Alice said to herself . "
210906	210970	210897	210897	He	11066	" And if not your lover , Alice Vavasor , what is he then to you ? And what are you to him , if not his love ? She was beginning to understand that she had put herself in the way of utter destruction;—that she had walked to the brink of a precipice , and that she must now topple over it . "
210977	211016	210971	210971	He	11066	" she said ; and then she sat silent and moody , and it took her hours to get her answer written to Kate . On the same afternoon she saw her father for a moment or two . "
211024	211032	211035	211035	he	357	" he said , raising his eyebrows . "
211050	211051	211048	211048	papa	8677	" "
211078	211079	211074	211074	he	357	" "
211091	211092	211089	211089	papa	8677	" "
211152	211153	211149	211149	I	0	" "
211170	211171	211175	211176	my dear;—very	5380	" "
211218	211245	211246	211246	I	0	" In answer to this , Alice said nothing . On that point her father 's wishes were fast growing to be identical with her own . "
211258	211262	211246	211246	I	0	" he continued . "
211359	211899	211900	211900	George	357	" Then he left her , and it seemed to Alice that he had been very cruel . There had been little , she thought , nay , nothing of a father 's loving tenderness in his words to her . If he had spoken to her differently , might she not even now have confessed everything to him ? But herein Alice accused him wrongfully . Tenderness from him on this subject had , we may say , become impossible . She had made it impossible . Nor could he tell her the extent of his wishes without damaging his own cause . He could not let her know that all that was done was so done with the view of driving her into John Grey 's arms . But what words were those for a father to speak to a daughter ! Had she brought herself to such a state that her own father desired to see her deserted and thrown aside ? And was it probable that this wish of his should come to pass ? As to that , Alice had already made up her mind . She thought that she had made up her mind that she would never become her cousin 's wife . It needed not her father 's wish to accomplish her salvation , if her salvation lay in being separated from him . On the next morning George went to her . The reader will , perhaps , remember their last interview . He had come to her after her letter to him from Westmoreland , and had asked her to seal their reconciliation with a kiss ; but she had refused him . He had offered to embrace her , and she had shuddered before him , fearing his touch , telling him by signs much more clear than any words , that she felt for him none of the love of a woman . Then he had turned from her in anger , declaring to her honestly that he was angry . Since that he had borrowed her money,—had made two separate assaults upon her purse,—and was now come to tell her of the results . How was he to address her ? I beg that it may be also remembered that he was not a man to forget the treatment he had received . When he entered the room , Alice looked at him , at first , almost furtively . She was afraid of him . It must be confessed that she already feared him . Had there been in the man anything of lofty principle he might still have made her his slave , though I doubt whether he could ever again have forced her to love him . She looked at him furtively , and perceived that the gash on his face was nearly closed . The mark of existing anger was not there . He had come to her intending to be gentle , if it might be possible . He had been careful in his dress , as though he wished to try once again if the rôle of lover might be within his reach . Alice was the first to speak . "
211920	211921	211911	211911	I	0	" "
211954	211955	211958	211958	George	357	" "
211967	211968	211970	211970	me	0	" "
212002	212019	211993	211993	I	0	" He smiled and looked pleasant , as he used to do in those Swiss days . "
212029	212030	211993	211993	I	0	" "
212047	212048	212033	212033	you	357	" "
212053	212054	212033	212033	you	357	" "
212136	212137	212134	212134	Alice	337	" "
212144	212229	212140	212140	I	0	" Anybody , even your father , would tell you that ; though , probably , he regards my ambition to be a Member of Parliament as a sign of downright madness . But I was obliged to stand now , if I intended to go on with it , as that old lord died so inopportunely . Well , about the money ! It is quite upon the cards that I may be forced to ask for another loan when the autumn comes . "
212230	212238	212134	212134	Alice	337	" You shall have it , George . "
212239	212290	212134	212134	Alice	337	" Thanks , Alice . And now I will tell you what I propose . You know that I have been reconciled,—with a sort of reconciliation,—to my grandfather ? Well , when the next affair is over , I propose to tell him exactly how you and I then stand . "
212291	212358	212140	212140	I	0	" Do not go into that now , George . It is enough for you at present to be assured that such assistance as I can give you is at your command . I want you to feel the full joy of your success , and you will do so more thoroughly if you will banish all these money troubles from your mind for a while . "
212359	212375	212377	212377	he	5383	" They shall , at any rate , be banished while I am with you , "
212379	212386	212377	212377	he	5383	" There ; let them go ! "
212404	212409	212411	212411	he	5383	" Let them vanish , "
212413	212428	212411	212411	he	5383	" It is always well to be rid of such troubles for a time . "
212658	212666	212668	212668	he	5383	" I have already taken my seat , "
212670	212722	212668	212668	he	5383	" Yes ; I saw that in the newspapers . My acquaintance among Members of Parliament is very small , but I see that you were introduced , as they call it , by one of the few men that I do know . Is Mr. Bott a friend of yours ? "
212723	212740	212668	212668	he	5383	" No,—certainly not a friend . I may probably have to act with him in public . "
212741	212787	212668	212668	he	5383	" Ah , that 's just what they said of Mr. Palliser when they felt ashamed of his having such a man as his guest . I think if I were in public life I should try to act with people that I could like . "
212788	212795	212668	212668	he	5383	" Then you dislike Mr. Bott ? "
212796	212812	212668	212668	he	5383	" I do not like him , but my feelings about him are not violent . "
212813	212820	212822	212822	George	357	" He is a vulgar ass , "
212824	212838	212668	212668	he	5383	" with no more pretensions to rank himself a gentleman than your footman . "
212839	212845	212668	212668	he	5383	" If I had one . "
212846	212860	212668	212668	he	5383	" But he will get on in Parliament , to a certain extent . "
212861	212898	212668	212668	he	5383	" I 'm afraid I do n't quite understand what are the requisites for Parliamentary success , or indeed of what it consists . Is his ambition , do you suppose , the same as yours ? "
212899	212935	212668	212668	he	5383	" His ambition , I take it , does not go beyond a desire to be Parliamentary flunkey to a big man,—with wages , if possible , but without , if the wages are impossible . "
212936	212940	212668	212668	he	5383	" And yours ? "
212941	212963	212668	212668	he	5383	" Oh , as to mine;—there are some things , Alice , that a man does not tell to any one . "
212964	212975	212668	212668	he	5383	" Are there ? They must be very terrible things . "
212976	213057	212668	212668	he	5383	" The schoolboy , when he sits down to make his rhymes , dares not say , even to his sister , that he hopes to rival Milton ; but he nurses such a hope . The preacher , when he preaches his sermon , does not whisper , even to his wife , his belief that thousands may perhaps be turned to repentance by the strength of his words ; but he thinks that the thousand converts are possible . "
213058	213083	212668	212668	he	5383	" And you , though you will not say so , intend to rival Chatham , and to make your thousand converts in politics . "
213084	213140	213141	213141	Her	5388	" I like to hear you laugh at me,—I do , indeed . It does me good to hear your voice again with some touch of satire in it . It brings back the old days,—the days to which I hope we may soon revert without pain . Shall it not be so , dearest ? "
213160	213166	213167	213167	she	5388	" I do not know , "
213247	213256	213257	213257	he	5389	" Who gave you this paper - cutter ? "
213262	213282	213257	213257	he	5389	" Goodness me , why do you ask ? and especially , why do you ask in that way ? "
213283	213306	213317	213317	He	5389	" I asked simply because if it is a present to you from any one , I will take up something else . "
213307	213316	213317	213317	He	5389	" It was given me by Mr. Grey . "
213354	213357	213358	213358	she	5388	" George , "
213369	213381	213362	213362	she	5388	" your violence is unreasonable ; pray do not repeat it . "
213382	213389	213390	213390	he	5389	" I did not mean it , "
213393	213416	213390	213390	he	5389	" and I beg your pardon . I was simply unfortunate in the article I selected . And who gave you this ? "
213445	213464	213420	213420	he	5389	" It so happens that no one gave me that ; I bought it at a stupid bazaar . "
213465	213487	213362	213362	she	5388	" Then this will do . You shall give it me as a present , on the renewal of our love . "
213488	213498	213500	213500	she	5388	" It is too poor a thing to give , "
213512	213567	213507	213507	she	5388	" By no means ; nothing is too poor , if given in that way . Anything will do ; a ribbon , a glove , a broken sixpence . Will you give me something that I may take , and , taking it , may know that your heart is given with it ? "
213568	213577	213578	213578	she	5388	" Take the rule , if you please , "
213581	213587	213588	213588	he	5389	" And about the heart ? "
213691	213702	213703	213703	he	5389	" Well , Alice , and what about the heart ? "
213707	213719	213721	213721	she	5388	" I would so much rather talk about politics , George , "
213763	213772	213773	213773	he	5389	" Alice , that is not quite fair , "
213776	213785	213773	213773	he	5389	" I do not mean to be unfair . "
213786	213833	213743	213743	He	5389	" I am not so sure of that . I almost think that you do mean it . You have told me that you intend to become my wife . If , after that , you wilfully make me miserable , will not that be unfair ? "
213834	213844	213773	213773	he	5389	" I am not making you miserable,—certainly not wilfully . "
213845	213859	213773	213773	he	5389	" Did that letter which you wrote to me from Westmoreland mean anything ? "
213860	213876	213743	213743	He	5389	" George , do not strive to make me think that it meant too much . "
213877	213890	213773	213773	he	5389	" If it did , you had better say so at once . "
213942	213948	213949	213949	he	5392	" Look here , Alice , "
213952	214006	213949	213949	he	5392	" I find it very hard to understand you . When I look back over all that has passed between us , and to that other episode in your life , summing it all up with your conduct to me at present , I find myself at a loss to read your character . "
214007	214021	213949	213949	he	5392	" I fear I can not help you in the reading of it . "
214022	214156	214189	214189	he	5393	" When you first loved me;—for you did love me . I understood that well enough . There is no young man who in early life does not read with sufficient clearness that sweetest morsel of poetry.—And when you quarrelled with me , judging somewhat harshly of my offences , I understood that also ; for it is the custom of women to be hard in their judgement on such sins . When I heard that you had accepted the offer made to you by that gentleman in Cambridgeshire , I thought that I understood you still,—knowing how natural it was that you should seek some cure for your wound . I understood it , and accused myself , not you , in that I had driven you to so fatal a remedy . "
214193	214307	214189	214189	he	5393	" And I understood it well when I heard that this cure had been too much for you . By heavens , yes ! there was no misunderstanding that . I meant no insult to the man when I upset his little toy just now . I have not a word to say against him . For many women he would make a model husband , but you are not one of them . And when you discovered this yourself , as you did , I understood that without difficulty . Yes , by heavens ! if ever woman had been driven to a mistake , you had been driven to one there . "
214360	214515	214355	214355	he	5395	" And , Alice , I understood it also when you again consented to be my wife . I thought that I still understood you then . I may have been vain to think so , but surely it was natural . I believed that the old love had come back upon you , and again warmed your heart . I thought that it had been cold during our separation , and I was pleased to think so . Was that unnatural ? Put yourself in my place , and say if you would not have thought so . I told myself that I understood you then , and I told myself that in all that you had done you had acted as a true , and good , and loving woman . I thought of you much , and I saw that your conduct , as a whole , was intelligible and becoming . "
214557	214643	214551	214551	he	883	" But now your present behaviour makes all the rest a riddle . You have said that you would be my wife , declaring thereby that you had forgiven my offences , and , as I suppose , reassuring me of your love ; and yet you receive me with all imaginable coldness . What am I to think of it , and in what way would you have me behave to you ? When last I was here I asked you for a kiss . "
214784	214846	214848	214848	he	5397	" I asked you for a kiss . If you are to be my wife you can have no shame in granting me such a request . Within the last two months you have told me that you would marry me . What am I to think of such a promise if you deny me all customary signs of your affection ? "
214869	214877	214878	214878	she	5398	" I wonder you can not understand , "
214881	214888	214878	214878	she	5398	" that I have suffered much . "
214889	214898	214848	214848	he	5397	" And is that to be my answer ? "
214899	214909	214848	214848	he	5397	" I do n't know what answer you want . "
214910	214939	214878	214878	she	5398	" Come , Alice , do not be untrue ; you do know what answer I want , and you know also whether my wanting it is unreasonable . "
214940	214952	214953	214953	she	5398	" No one ever told me that I was untrue before , "
214956	214987	214953	214953	she	5398	" You do know what it is that I desire . I desire to learn that the woman who is to be my wife , in truth , loves me . "
215038	215051	215024	215024	he	5399	" Well , Alice , am I to hear anything from you ? "
215052	215073	215014	215014	she	5398	" Not now , George ; you are angry , and I will not speak to you in your anger . "
215074	215094	215132	215132	he	5399	" Have I not cause to be angry ? Do you not know that you are treating me badly ? "
215095	215117	215024	215024	he	5399	" I know that my head aches , and that I am very wretched . I wish you would leave me . "
215118	215127	215129	215129	he	5399	" There , then , is your gift , "
215144	215163	215132	215132	he	5399	" And there is the trumpery trinket which I had hoped you would have worn for my sake . "
215210	215213	215214	215214	he	5399	" Alice , "
215217	215233	215214	215214	he	5399	" when I am gone , try to think honestly of your conduct to me . "
216392	216395	216396	216396	she	387	" Jeannette , "
216411	216421	216396	216396	she	387	" I 'm afraid those two gentlemen have quarrelled . "
216422	216441	216396	216396	she	387	" Oh , laws , ma'am , in course they have ! How was they to help it ? "
216521	216535	216511	216512	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And why should they quarrel , Jeannette ? It 's very foolish . "
216536	216609	216748	216748	she	5428	" I do n't know about being foolish , ma'am ; but it 's the most natural thing in life . If I had two beaux as was a - courting me together , in course I should expect as they would punch each other 's heads . There 's some girls do it a purpose , because they like to see it . One at a time 's what I say . "
216610	216619	216748	216748	she	5428	" You 're a young thing , Jeannette . "
216620	216652	216511	216512	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Well , ma'am — yes ; I am young , no doubt . But I wo n't say but what I 've had a beau , young as I look . "
216653	216669	216748	216748	she	5428	" But you do n't suppose that I want beaux , as you call them ? "
216670	216746	216748	216748	she	5428	" I do n't know , ma'am , as you wants 'em exactly . That 's as may be . There they are ; and if they was to blow each other 's brains out in the gig to - night , I should n't be a bit surprised for one . There 's nothing wo n't quiet them at Oileymead to - night , if brandy - and - water do n't do it . "
216772	216796	216761	216761	her	387	" Why , you silly child , they 're not going home together at all . Did not the Captain go away first ? "
216797	216822	216748	216748	she	5428	" The Captain did go away first , certainly ; but I thought perhaps it was to get his pistols and fighting things ready . "
216823	216837	216748	216748	she	5428	" They wo n't fight , Jeannette . Gentlemen have given over fighting . "
216838	216913	216761	216761	her	387	" Have they , ma'am ? That makes it much easier for ladies , no doubt . Perhaps them peaceable ways will come down to such as us in time . It 'd be a comfort , I know , to them as are quiet given , like me . I hate to see men knocking each other 's heads about,—I do . So Mr. Cheesacre and the Captain wo n't fight , ma'am ? "
216914	216927	216748	216748	she	5428	" Of course they wo n't , you little fool , you . "
216928	216996	216748	216748	she	5428	" Dear , dear ; I was so sure we should have had the papers all full of it,—and perhaps one of them stretched upon his bloody bier ! I wonder which it would have been ? I always made up my mind that the Captain would n't be wounded in any of his wital parts — unless it was his heart , you know , ma'am . "
216997	217015	216748	216748	she	5428	" But why should they quarrel at all , Jeannette ? It is the most foolish thing . "
217016	217055	216748	216748	she	5428	" Well , ma'am , I do n't know about that . What else is they to do ? There 's some things as you can cry halves about , but there 's no crying halves about this . "
217056	217060	217065	217065	ma'am	9047	" About what , Jeannette?"—"Why
217067	217068	217065	217065	ma'am	9047	" "
217115	217141	217109	217109	you	387	" Whereupon Mrs. Greenow put her handkerchief to her eyes , and Jeannette , probably in token of contrition , put her apron to hers . "
217170	217171	217173	217173	I	0	" "
217178	217179	217176	217176	Jeannette	387	" "

217228	217229	217216	217217	dear friends	8906	" "
217261	217269	217258	217258	you	5429	" Then there was a little pause . "
217300	217301	217286	217286	he	395	" "
217343	217344	217335	217335	he	395	" "
217380	217381	217382	217382	He	1602	" "

217422	217423	217418	217418	you	387	" "
217432	217437	217430	217430	girl	5448	" repeated Mrs. Greenow . "
217443	217452	217439	217439	he	1602	" said Jeannette , plainly asking a question . "
217499	217500	217501	217501	I	0	" "
217512	217520	217503	217503	I	0	" and Jeannette rose from her seat . "
217529	217534	217523	217523	my	0	" said Mrs. Greenow . "
217577	217799	217800	217800	She	5456	" So Jeannette got up and departed , and after some few further thoughts about Captain Bellfield , Mrs. Greenow herself went to her bedroom . Mr. Cheesacre , when he drove back to Oileymead alone from Norwich , after dining with Mrs. Greenow , had kept himself hot , and almost comfortable , with passion against Bellfield ; and his heat , if not his comfort , had been sustained by his seeing the Captain , with his portmanteau , escaping just as he reached his own homestead . But early on the following morning his mind reverted to Mrs. Greenow , and he remembered , with anything but satisfaction , some of the hard things which she had said to him . He had made mistakes in his manner of wooing . He was quite aware of that now , and was determined that they should be rectified for the future . She had rebuked him for having said nothing about his love . He would instantly mend that fault . And she had bidden him not to be so communicative about his wealth . Henceforth he would be dumb on that subject . Nevertheless , he could not but think that the knowledge of his circumstances which the lady already possessed , must be of service to him . "
217816	218209	217800	217800	She	5456	" he said to himself . He was very far from feeling that the battle was already lost . Her last word to him had been an assurance of her friendship ; and then why should she have been at so much trouble to tell him the way in which he ought to address her if she were herself indifferent as to his addresses ? He was , no doubt , becoming tired of his courtship , and heartily wished that the work were over ; but he was not minded to give it up . He therefore prepared himself for another attack , and took himself into Norwich without seeking counsel from any one . He could not trust himself to think that she could really wish to refuse him after all the encouragement she had given him . On this occasion he put on no pink shirt or shiny boots , being deterred from doing so by a remembrance of Captain Bellfield 's ridicule ; but , nevertheless , he dressed himself with considerable care . He clothed his nether person in knickerbockers , with tight , leathern , bright - coloured gaiters round his legs , being conscious of certain manly graces and symmetrical proportions which might , as he thought , stand him in good stead . And he put on a new shooting - coat , the buttons on which were elaborate , and a wonderful waistcoat worked over with foxes ' heads . He completed his toilet with a round , low - crowned hat , with dog's - skin gloves , and a cutting whip . Thus armed he went forth resolved to conquer or to die,—as far as death might result from any wound which Mrs. Greenow might be able to give him . He waited , on this occasion , for the coming of no market - day ; indeed , the journey into the city was altogether special , and he was desirous that she should know that such was the case . He drove at a great pace into the inn - yard , threw his reins to the ostler , took just one glass of cherry - brandy at the bar , and then marched off across the market - place to the Close , with quiet and decisive steps . "
218216	218229	218212	218212	you	5457	" said a friendly voice , in one of the narrow streets . "
218241	218291	217800	217800	She	5456	" It was Grimsby , the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwich , a country gentleman , and one , therefore , to whom Cheesacre would generally pay much respect ; but on this occasion he did not even pull up for an instant , or moderate his pace . "
218299	218313	217800	217800	She	5456	" he said , and marched onwards with his head towards the Close . "
218331	218366	218327	218327	I	0	" he said to himself ; but , nevertheless , at a certain pastrycook 's , of whose shop he had knowledge , he pulled up and had another glass of cherry - brandy . "
218373	218386	218367	218368	Mrs. Greenow	405	" he said to Jeannette , not deigning to ask any question . "
218398	218422	218393	218393	she	405	" said Jeannette , conscious that some occasion had arrived ; and in another second he was in the presence of his angel . "
218437	218530	218423	218424	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" said the lady , as she welcomed him , using almost the same words as his friend had done in the street . Why should not he come into Norwich on a Thursday , as well as any one else ? Did they suppose that he was tied for ever to his ploughs and carts ? He was minded to conduct himself with a little spirit on this occasion , and to improve the opinion which Mrs. Greenow had formed about him . On this account he answered her somewhat boldly . "
218572	218597	218566	218566	I	0	" Then he remembered that he was not to make any more boasts about his money , and he endeavoured to cover the error . "
218623	218624	218612	218612	we	5465	" "
218634	218635	218631	218632	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
218688	218689	218676	218676	I	0	" "
218711	218721	218724	218725	Mrs. Greenow	405	" and Mrs. Greenow looked down at his garments . "
218781	218782	218777	218778	a man	813	" "
218795	218796	218777	218778	a man	813	" "
218808	218809	218805	218806	Mrs. Greenow	405	" "
218835	218836	218824	218824	I	0	" "
218907	218924	218957	218958	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Then he remembered that he was again treading on forbidden ground , and stopped himself . "
218943	218944	218945	218945	I	0	" "
218976	219229	218972	218972	Greenow	405	" Mr. Cheesacre was rather at a loss to know how he should begin . This allusion to the departed one did not at all assist him . He had so often told the widow that care killed a cat , and that a live dog was better than a dead lion ; and had found so little efficacy in the proverbs , that he did not care to revert to them . He was aware that some more decided method of proceeding was now required . Little hints at love - making had been all very well in the earlier days of their acquaintance ; but there must be something more than little hints before he could hope to bring the matter to a favourable conclusion . The widow herself had told him that he ought to talk about love ; and he had taken two glasses of cherry - brandy , hoping that they might enable him to do so . He had put on a coat with brilliant buttons , and new knickerbockers , in order that he might be master of the occasion . He was resolved to call a spade a spade , and to speak boldly of his passion ; but how was he to begin ? There was the difficulty . He was now seated in a chair , and there he remained silent for a minute or two , while she smoothed her eyebrows with her handkerchief after her last slight ebullition of grief . "
219233	219244	219230	219231	Mrs. Greenow	405	" he exclaimed at last , jumping up before her ; "
219407	219408	219393	219393	I	0	" "
219419	219420	219416	219417	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
219459	219460	219456	219457	its mistress	5478	" "
219466	219467	219456	219457	its mistress	5478	" "
219581	219582	219590	219591	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
219593	219594	219590	219591	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
219674	219675	219652	219652	You	405	" "
219686	219687	219678	219679	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
219697	219825	219695	219695	Arabella	500	" At these words he rose from his chair , and coming immediately before her , went down on both knees so close to her as to prevent the possibility of her escaping from him . There could be no doubt as to the efficacy of the cherry - brandy . There he was , well down on his knees ; but he had not got down so low without some little cracking and straining on the part of the gaiters with which his legs were encompassed . He , in his passion , had probably omitted to notice this ; but Mrs. Greenow , who was more cool in her present temperament , was painfully aware that he might not be able to rise with ease . "
219840	219844	219695	219695	Arabella	500	" said she . "
219858	219859	219848	219848	you	395	" "
219894	219912	219887	219887	I	0	" Whereupon his grasp upon her hand was released ; but he made no attempt to rise . "
219928	219932	219916	219917	a man	813	" said she . "
219958	219976	219955	219955	somebody	1543	" But Cheesacre , whose senses were less acute than the lady 's , did not hear . "
219983	219987	219977	219977	I	0	" said he , "
219995	219996	219989	219989	you	0	" "
220021	220061	220062	220062	I	0	" Cheesacre now did hear a sound of steps , and the door was opened while he made his first futile attempt to get back to a standing position . The door was opened , and Captain Bellfield entered . "
220068	220072	220062	220062	I	0	" said he , "
220099	220119	220120	220120	I	0	" In the meantime Cheesacre had risen ; but he had done so slowly , and with evident difficulty . "
220132	220136	220129	220130	Captain Bellfield	393	" said he . "
220152	220153	220142	220143	Mrs. Greenow	405	" "
220167	220172	220164	220165	old fellow	9249	" said the Captain . "

220192	220201	220181	220181	I	0	" said Cheesacre , walking up to him . "
220214	220229	220205	220206	Mrs. Greenow	405	" said the Captain . Then Mrs. Greenow felt herself called upon to speak . "
220293	220294	220295	220295	I	0	" "
220304	220309	220301	220302	Mrs. Greenow	405	" said the Captain . "
220318	220323	220324	220324	Gentlemen	9193	" said Mr. Cheesacre . "
220346	220347	220342	220342	you	9193	" "
220352	220357	220342	220342	you	9193	" said Mr. Cheesacre . "
220377	220378	220367	220368	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
220382	220391	220367	220368	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" said Captain Bellfield , preparing to go . "
220414	220485	220486	220487	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" To this Mrs. Greenow half assented with an uncertain nod , and then the Captain went . As soon as the door was closed behind his back , Mr. Cheesacre again prepared to throw himself into his former position , but to this Mrs. Greenow decidedly objected . If he were allowed to go down again , there was no knowing what force might be necessary to raise him . "
220489	220493	220486	220487	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" she said , "
220506	220507	220486	220487	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" "
220510	220530	220486	220487	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" said he , standing with his hand on his heart , and his legs and knickerbockers well displayed . "
220557	220558	220552	220552	your	395	" "
220570	220571	220563	220564	Mrs. Cheesacre	418	" "

220601	220644	220588	220588	mine	0	" said he , in utter disgust at this further reference to Mr. Greenow . The expression , at such a moment , militated against courtesy ; but even Mrs. Greenow herself felt that the poor man had been subjected to provocation . "
220650	220711	220588	220588	mine	0	" said she , offering him her hand . But he turned his back upon her , for there was something in his eye that he wanted to hide . I believe that he really did love her , and that at this moment he would have taken her , even though he had learned that her fortune was gone . "
220720	220724	220713	220713	you	5509	" said she , "
220735	220736	220713	220713	you	5509	" "
220745	220749	220713	220713	you	5509	" said he . "
220813	220914	220797	220798	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And now , though his back was turned , the whimpering of his voice told plainly that tears were in his eyes . She was a little touched . No woman would feel disposed to marry a man simply because he cried , and perhaps few women would be less likely to give way to such tenderness than Mrs. Greenow . She understood men and women too well , and had seen too much both of the world 's rough side and of its smooth side to fall into such a blunder as that ; but she was touched . "
220918	220929	220797	220798	Mrs. Greenow	405	" she said , putting her hand upon his arm , "
220936	220937	220797	220798	Mrs. Greenow	405	" "
220947	220957	220939	220939	I	0	" said he , almost blubbering in his earnestness . "
220964	220975	220939	220939	I	0	" said she , still touching him with her hand . "
221013	221014	221003	221003	their	5514	" "

221055	221078	221050	221051	Charlie Fairstairs	413	" The very idea of having such a bride palmed off upon him did something to restore him to his manly courage . "
221108	221109	221110	221110	She	9134	" "
221119	221120	221116	221117	Mrs. Greenow	405	" "
221185	221196	221197	221198	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And again she put her hand upon his arm . "

221426	221440	221417	221417	she	405	" You do n't mean to take that man Bellfield , do you ? "
221441	221506	221417	221417	she	405	" Come , Mr. Cheesacre , that 's rank jealousy . What right can you have to ask me whether I shall take any man or no man ? The chances are that I shall remain as I am till I 'm carried to my grave ; but I 'm not going to give any pledge about it to you or to any one . "
221507	221611	221417	221417	she	405	" You do n't know that man , Mrs. Greenow ; you do n't , indeed . I tell it you as your friend . Does not it stand to reason , when he has got nothing in the world , that he must be a beggar ? It 's all very well saying that when a man is courting a lady , he should n't say much about his money ; but you wo n't make me believe that any man will make a good husband who has n't got a shilling . And for lies , there 's no beating him ! "
221612	221626	221417	221417	she	405	" Why , then , has he been such a friend of yours ? "
221627	221650	221417	221417	she	405	" Well , because I 've been foolish . I took up with him just because he looked pleasant , I suppose . "
221651	221664	221417	221417	she	405	" And you want to prevent me from doing the same thing . "
221665	221713	221417	221417	she	405	" If you were to marry him , Mrs. Greenow , it 's my belief I should do him a mischief ; it is , really . I do n't think I could stand it;—a mean , skulking beggar ! I suppose I 'd better go now ? "
221714	221730	221417	221417	she	405	" Certainly , if that 's the way you choose to talk about my friends . "
221731	221763	221417	221417	she	405	" Friends , indeed ! Well , I wo n't say any more at present . I suppose if I was to talk for ever it would n't be any good ? "
221764	221777	221417	221417	she	405	" Come and talk to Kate Vavasor for ever , Mr. Cheesacre . "
221817	221832	221833	221833	he	5529	" I did n't ever think I should ever care so much about anything , "
221870	221880	221881	221881	Jeannette	387	" Her mistress was very bad with a headache , "
222707	222710	222712	222712	she	552	" Burgo , "
222720	222724	222712	222712	she	552	" look here . "
222806	222817	222819	222820	Lady Monk	552	" You see that she is not afraid of coming , "
222822	222833	222835	222835	Burgo	427	" I suppose she does n't think much about it , "
222837	222875	222835	222835	Burgo	427	" If that 's what you really believe , you 'd better give it up . Nothing on earth would justify such a step on your part except a thorough conviction that she is attached to you . "
222894	222897	222898	222898	she	10621	" Well , "
222901	222920	222898	222898	she	10621	" if there 's to be an end of it , let there be an end of it . "
222921	222930	222931	222931	he	427	" I think I 'd better hang myself , "
222934	222979	222931	222931	he	427	" Burgo , I will not have you here if you talk to me in that way . I am trying to help you once again ; but if you look like that , and talk like that , I will give it up . "
222980	222990	222898	222898	she	10621	" I think you 'd better give it up . "
222991	223010	222898	222898	she	10621	" Are you becoming cowardly at last ? With all your faults I never expected that of you . "
223011	223040	222931	222931	he	427	" No ; I am not a coward . I 'd go out and fight him at two paces ' distance with the greatest pleasure in the world . "
223041	223093	222898	222898	she	10621	" You know that 's nonsense , Burgo . It 's downright braggadocio . Men do not fight now ; nor at any time would a man be called upon to fight , because you simply wanted to take his wife from him . If you had done it , indeed ! "
223094	223129	222898	222898	she	10621	" How am I to do it ? I 'd do it to - morrow if it depended on me . No one can say that I 'm afraid of anybody or of anything . "
223130	223141	222931	222931	he	427	" I suppose something in the matter depends on her ? "
223142	223152	222898	222898	she	10621	" I believe she loves me,—if you mean that ? "
223153	223159	222898	222898	she	10621	" Look here , Burgo , "
223187	223435	223436	223436	Burgo	427	" I think you were much wronged in that matter . After what had passed I thought that you had a right to claim Lady Glencora as your wife . Mr. Palliser , in my mind , behaved very wrongly in stepping in between you and — you and such a fortune as hers , in that way . He can not expect that his wife should have any affection for him . There is nobody alive who has a greater horror of anything improper in married women than I have . I have always shown it . When Lady Madeline Madtop left her husband , I would never allow her to come inside my doors again,—though I have no doubt he ill - used her dreadfully , and there was nothing ever proved between her and Colonel Graham . One ca n't be too particular in such matters . But here , if you,—if you can succeed , you know , I shall always regard the Palliser episode in Lady Glencora 's life as a tragical accident . I shall indeed . Poor dear ! It was done exactly as they make nuns of girls in Roman Catholic countries ; and as I should think no harm of helping a nun out of her convent , so I should think no harm of helping her now . If you are to say anything to her , I think you might have an opportunity at the party . "
223459	223471	223473	223474	his aunt	10621	" You can think of what I have said , Burgo , "
223491	223504	223505	223505	she	10621	" Have you anything more that you wish to say to me ? "
223508	223515	223517	223517	Burgo	427	" I 've got no money , "
223582	223589	223729	223730	Lady Monk	552	" I 've got no money . "
223615	223623	223625	223625	she	10621	" You 've never got any money , "
223632	223694	223625	223625	she	10621	" How can I help it ? I ca n't make money . If I had a couple of hundred pounds , so that I could take her , I believe that she would go with me . It should not be my fault if she did not . It would have been all right if she had come to Monkshade . "
223695	223715	223766	223766	he	5583	" I 've got no money for you , Burgo . I have not five pounds belonging to me . "
223716	223723	223625	223625	she	10621	" But you 've got — ? "
223724	223727	223729	223730	Lady Monk	552	" What ? "
223736	223743	223745	223745	he	5583	" Would Cosmo lend it me ? "
223819	223825	223827	223828	Lady Monk	552	" I do not know , "
223830	223839	223827	223828	Lady Monk	552	" I never see him . Probably not . "
223840	223845	223847	223847	Burgo	427	" It is hard , "
223849	223873	223847	223847	Burgo	427	" Fancy that a man should be ruined for two hundred pounds , just at such a moment of his life as this ! "
223889	223915	223883	223883	he	5588	" You have jewels , aunt;—could you not raise it for me ? I would redeem them with the very first money that I got . "
224080	224087	224089	224089	Alice	337	" I do n't know her , "
224091	224095	224097	224098	Lady Glencora	488	" My dear , "
224100	224114	224097	224098	Lady Glencora	488	" that 's absurd . Half the people there wo n't know her . "
224115	224155	224071	224072	Lady Glencora	488	" But they know her set , or know her friends,—or , at any rate , will meet their own friends at her house . I should only bother you , and should not in the least gratify myself . "
224156	224197	224250	224250	she	488	" The fact is , everybody will go who can , and I should have no sort of trouble in getting a card for you . Indeed I should simply write a note and say I meant to bring you . "
224198	224224	224250	224250	she	488	" Pray do n't do any such thing , for I certainly shall not go . I ca n't conceive why you should wish it . "
224225	224232	224234	224235	Lady Glencora	488	" Mr. Fitzgerald will be there , "
224291	224307	224261	224261	She	488	" I 'm sure that he will be there , though nobody has told me . "
224308	224319	224321	224321	Alice	337	" That may be a reason for your staying away , "
224325	224336	224321	224321	Alice	337	" but hardly a reason for my going with you . "
224373	224383	224385	224385	she	488	" Ah ! I thought you would have gone , "
224387	224397	224399	224399	Alice	337	" It would be contrary to all my habits , "
224401	224434	224399	224399	Alice	337	" I never go to people 's houses when I do n't know them . It 's a kind of society which I do n't like . Pray do not ask me . "
224435	224453	224454	224455	Lady Glencora	488	" Oh ! very well . If it must be so , I wo n't press it . "
224495	224502	224503	224503	she	337	" Pray do not ask me , "
224516	224529	224530	224530	she	337	" I suppose he wo n't bite me , at any rate , "
224569	224584	224542	224542	she	337	" He certainly ca n't bite you , if you will not let him . "
224585	224750	224534	224534	she	337	" Do you know , Alice , though they all say that Plantagenet is one of the wisest men in London , I sometimes think that he is one of the greatest fools . Soon after we came to town I told him that we had better not go to that woman 's house . Of course he understood me . He simply said that he wished that I should do so . ' I hate anything out of the way , ' he said . ' There can be no reason why my wife should not go to Lady Monk 's house as well as to any other . ' There was an end of it , you know , as far as anything I could do was concerned . But there was n't an end of it with him . He insists that I shall go , but he sends my duenna with me . Dear Mrs. Marsham is to be there ! "
224751	224762	224534	224534	she	337	" She 'll do you no harm , I suppose ? "
224763	224849	224542	224542	she	337	" I 'm not so sure of that , Alice . In the first place , one does n't like to be followed everywhere by a policeman , even though one is n't going to pick a pocket . And then , the devil is so strong within me , that I should like to dodge the policeman . I can fancy a woman being driven to do wrong simply by a desire to show her policeman that she can be too many for him . "
224850	224864	224534	224534	she	337	" Glencora , you make me so wretched when you talk like that . "
224865	224971	224534	224534	she	337	" Will you go with me , then , so that I may have a policeman of my own choosing ? He asked me if I would mind taking Mrs. Marsham with me in my carriage . So I up and spoke , very boldly , like the proud young porter , and told him I would not ; and when he asked why not , I said that I preferred taking a friend of my own,—a young friend , I said , and I then named you or my cousin , Lady Jane . I told him I should bring one or the other . "
224972	224978	224542	224542	she	337	" And was he angry ? "
224979	225051	224534	224534	she	337	" No ; he took it very quietly,—saying something , in his calm way , about hoping that I should get over a prejudice against one of his earliest and dearest friends . He twits at me because I do n't understand Parliament and the British Constitution , but I know more of them than he does about a woman . You are quite sure you wo n't go , then ? "
225057	225060	225062	225063	Lady Glencora	488	" Do , "
225088	225101	225102	225102	she	488	" It is against the whole tenor of my life 's way , "
225105	225135	225102	225102	she	488	" And , Glencora , I am not happy myself . I am not fit for parties . I sometimes think that I shall never go into society again . "
225136	225144	225073	225073	her	488	" That 's nonsense , you know . "
225145	225165	225174	225175	Lady Glencora	488	" I suppose it is , but I can not go now . I would if I really thought — "
225166	225172	225174	225175	Lady Glencora	488	" Oh , very well , "
225180	225213	225174	225175	Lady Glencora	488	" I suppose I shall get through it . If he asks me to dance , I shall stand up with him , just as though I had never seen him before . "
225279	225289	225291	225292	Lady Glencora	488	" You 'll come to me the morning after , "
226100	226110	226111	226112	Lady Monk	552	" I should n't care a straw about her , "
226119	226141	226111	226112	Lady Monk	552	" if she would talk to anybody . But nobody will talk to her , and then she listens to everything . "
226369	226372	226373	226373	she	552	" Burgo , "
226376	226393	226373	226373	she	552	" if I find that you deceive me now , I will never trust you again . "
226394	226398	226403	226403	he	427	" All right , "
226418	226436	226437	226437	she	552	" It is lent to you for a certain purpose , should you happen to want it , "
226442	226452	226453	226453	he	427	" I do happen to want it very much , "
226545	226554	226556	226556	he	485	" Your cousin is not going , then ? "
226558	226564	226556	226556	he	485	" Alice is not going . "
226565	226578	226636	226636	he	485	" Then you can give Mrs. Marsham a seat in your carriage ? "
226579	226598	226636	226636	he	485	" Impossible , Plantagenet . I thought I had told you that I had promised my cousin Jane . "
226599	226606	226556	226556	he	485	" But you can take three . "
226607	226622	226636	226636	he	485	" Indeed I can't,—unless you would like me to sit out with the coachman . "
226661	226668	226669	226669	she	5656	" You must know , Plantagenet , "
226673	226708	226669	226669	she	5656	" that it is impossible for three women dressed to go out in one carriage . I am sure you would n't like to see me afterwards if I had been one of them . "
226709	226731	226556	226556	he	485	" You need not have said anything to Lady Jane when Miss Vavasor refused . I had asked you before that . "
226732	226762	226669	226669	she	5656	" And I had told you that I liked going with young women , and not with old ones . That 's the long and the short of it . "
226763	226775	226669	226669	she	5656	" Glencora , I wish you would not use such expressions . "
226776	226840	226556	226556	he	485	" What ! not the long and the short ? It 's good English . Quite as good as Mr. Bott 's , when he said in the House the other night that the Government kept their accounts in a higgledy - piggledy way . You see , I have been studying the debates , and you should n't be angry with me . "
226841	226876	226669	226669	she	5656	" I am not angry with you . You speak like a child to say so . Then , I suppose , the carriage must go for Mrs. Marsham after it has taken you ? "
226877	226899	226669	226669	she	5656	" It shall go before . Jane will not be in a hurry , and I am sure I shall not . "
226900	226933	226556	226556	he	485	" She will think you very uncivil ; that is all . I told her that she could go with you when I heard that Miss Vavasor was not to be there . "
226934	227013	226669	226669	she	5656	" Then , Plantagenet , you should n't have told her so , and that 's the long — ; but I must n't say that . The truth is this , if you give me any orders I 'll obey them,—as far as I can . If I ca n't I 'll say so . But if I 'm left to go by my own judgement , it 's not fair that I should be scolded afterwards . "
227014	227021	226669	226669	she	5656	" I have never scolded you . "
227022	227037	226556	226556	he	485	" Yes , you have . You have told me that I was uncivil . "
227038	227048	226669	226669	she	5656	" I said that she would think you so . "
227049	227129	226669	226669	she	5656	" Then , if it 's only what she thinks , I do n't care two straws about it . She may have the carriage to herself if she likes , but she sha n't have me in it,—not unless I 'm ordered to go . I do n't like her , and I wo n't pretend to like her . My belief is that she follows me about to tell you if she thinks that I do wrong . "
227130	227133	227185	227185	she	830	" Glencora ! "
227134	227161	226669	226669	she	5656	" And that odious baboon with the red bristles does the same thing,—only he goes to her because he does n't dare to go to you . "
227369	227372	227373	227373	he	484	" Glencora ! "
227390	227451	227379	227379	he	484	" Well , my dear , it 's better you should know at once what I feel about it . I do n't suppose I 'm very good ; indeed I dare say I 'm bad enough , but these people about me wo n't make me any better . The duennas do n't make the Spanish ladies worth much . "
227452	227455	227479	227479	his	484	" Duennas ! "
227611	227623	227595	227595	she	830	" There 's somebody has mistaken it worse than I have , "
227726	227738	227739	227740	Lady Glencora	488	" I wish he 'd keep a separate carriage for her , "
227757	227763	227765	227766	Lady Jane	354	" That would be expensive , "
227768	227776	227778	227779	Lady Glencora	488	" Yes , it would be expensive , "
228408	228416	228417	228417	she	10621	" Do n't look so dreadfully preoccupied , "
229504	229539	229540	229541	Lady Glencora	488	" Dear Lady Glencora , do come in for a moment to my den . We were so sorry not to have you at Monkshade . We heard such terrible things about your health . "
229552	229618	229540	229541	Lady Glencora	488	" Oh , yes ; we heard,—something about moonlight and ruins . So like you , you know . I love that sort of thing , above all people ; but it does n't do ; does it ? Circumstances are so exacting . I think you know Lady Hartletop;—and there 's the Duchess of St. Bungay . Mr. Palliser was here five minutes since . "
229641	229650	229652	229653	Lady Hartletop	664	" We saw Mr. Palliser just pass through , "
229680	229690	229692	229693	Lady Glencora	488	" Yes ; he said he should be here , "
229695	229702	229704	229705	Lady Hartletop	664	" There 's a great crowd , "
229707	229717	229704	229705	Lady Hartletop	664	" I did n't think London was so full . "
229718	229722	229724	229725	Lady Glencora	488	" Very great . "
229783	229791	229793	229794	the Duchess	3281	" How very well you are looking , "
229796	229806	229793	229794	the Duchess	3281	" And I heard you had been so ill . "
229826	229834	229793	229794	the Duchess	3281	" How d'ye do , Lady Glencowrer ? "
229885	229893	229894	229894	she	488	" How are you , Mr. Bott ? "
229897	229911	229894	229894	she	488	" I think I 'll look for Mr. Palliser in the back room . "
229912	229917	229919	229920	the Duchess	3281	" Dear Lady Glencora , "
229940	229968	229933	229933	her	488	" Do let me go away with you . There 's that woman , Mrs. Conway Sparkes , coming , and you know how I hate her . "
230049	230055	230057	230057	he	1073	" I 'm going away , "
230064	230080	230057	230057	he	1073	" I only just came because I said I would . Shall you be late ? "
230081	230090	230123	230123	he	1073	" Oh , no ; I suppose not . "
230091	230096	230057	230057	he	1073	" Shall you dance ? "
230097	230110	230057	230057	he	1073	" Perhaps once,—just to show that I 'm not an old woman . "
230111	230121	230123	230123	he	1073	" Do n't heat yourself . Good - bye . "
230780	230785	230786	230786	she	10621	" Well , Burgo , "
230794	230800	230786	230786	she	10621	" have you been dancing ? "
230879	230889	230891	230892	Mrs. Sparkes	531	" There 's no knowing who may not reform , "
231089	231105	231106	231106	Burgo	427	" I will go up to her at once , and ask her to waltz , "
231124	231138	231109	231109	himself	427	" Why should I not ask her as well as any other woman ? "
231379	231391	231392	231393	Lady Glencora	488	" That will do very well thank you , Mrs. Marsham , "
231399	231407	231410	231410	she	1170	" Pray , do not trouble yourself , "
231616	231621	231623	231623	Burgo,—asking	668	" Will you waltz ? "
231662	231675	231677	231678	Mrs. Marsham	548	" I do n't think Lady Glencora will waltz to - night , "
231743	231751	231757	231757	her	488	" And why not , Mrs. Marsham ? "
231760	231786	231757	231757	her	488	" Why should n't I waltz to - night ? I rather think I shall , the more especially as Mr. Fitzgerald waltzes very well . "
232153	232159	232161	232161	Burgo	427	" Who is that woman ? "
232235	232243	232244	232244	she	548	" Oh , such an odious woman ! "
232247	232260	232244	232244	she	548	" Her name is Mrs. Marsham ; she is my bête noire . "
232395	232406	232408	232409	Mr. Bott	532	" He should n't have gone away and left her , "
232414	232422	232424	232425	Mrs. Marsham	548	" But who could have thought it ? "
232427	232435	232424	232425	Mrs. Marsham	548	" I 'm sure I did n't . "
232436	232445	232447	232448	Mr. Bott	532	" I suppose you 'd better tell him ? "
232450	232461	232463	232464	Mrs. Marsham	548	" But I do n't know where to find him , "
232466	232475	232477	232478	Mr. Bott;—and	670	" I did n't mean now at once , "
232483	232494	232480	232480	he	532	" Do you think it is as bad as that ? "
232495	232504	232506	232507	Mrs. Marsham	548	" I do n't know what to think , "
232522	232531	232533	232534	Lady Glencora	488	" I am so much out of practice , "
232536	232553	232533	232534	Lady Glencora	488	" I did n't think — I should have been able — to dance at all . "
232588	232595	232597	232597	he	532	" You 'll take another turn , "
232599	232602	232604	232604	she	488	" Presently , "
232639	232650	232652	232652	he	532	" Does it put you in mind of old days ? "
232774	232787	232788	232788	he	532	" Does it put you in mind of ' old days ? ' "
233113	233124	233126	233126	Burgo	427	" Does it put you in mind of old days ? "
233152	233160	233161	233161	she	488	" You must not talk of that , "
233167	233172	233161	233161	she	488	" May I not ? "
233188	233228	233182	233182	he	427	" May I not ? And why not ? They were happy days,—so happy ! Were not you happy when you thought — ? Ah , dear ! I suppose it is best not even to think of them ? "
233229	233234	233161	233161	she	488	" Much the best . "
233235	233266	233182	233182	he	427	" Only it is impossible . I wish I knew the inside of your heart , Cora , so that I could see what it is that you really wish . "
233338	233349	233350	233350	she	488	" You should not have come to me at all , "
233353	233386	233350	233350	she	488	" And why not ? Who has a better right to come to you ? Who has ever loved you as I have done ? Cora , did you get my letter ? "
233387	233392	233393	233393	she	488	" Come and dance , "
233396	233407	233393	233393	she	488	" I see a pair of eyes looking at us . "
233508	233516	233517	233518	Mrs. Marsham	548	" Wo n't it be making mischief ? "
233531	233542	233522	233523	Mr. Bott	532	" There 'll be worse mischief if you do n't , "
233548	233571	233543	233544	Mr. Bott	532	" He can come back , and then he can do as he likes . I 'll keep my eyes upon them . "
233768	233772	233773	233773	she	552	" The fool ! "
233822	233829	233830	233830	Burgo	427	" Did you get my letter ? "
233902	233911	233912	233912	he	427	" Let us go out upon the stairs , "
233915	233946	233912	233912	he	427	" for I must speak to you . Oh , if you could know what I suffered when you did not come to Monkshade ! Why did you not come ? "
233947	233956	233957	233957	she	552	" I wish I had not come here , "
233960	233979	233957	233957	she	552	" Because you have seen me ? That , at any rate , is not kind of you . "
234054	234070	234051	234052	Mr. Bott	532	" A man that can treat me like that deserves that I should leave him . "
234083	234095	234097	234097	Burgo	427	" I 'll get you some champagne with water in it , "
234099	234108	234097	234097	Burgo	427	" I know that is what you like . "
234109	234116	234117	234117	she	488	" Do not get me anything , "
234140	234142	234144	234144	her	488	" Mr. Fitzgerald,"—and
234152	234180	234194	234194	he	532	ear,—"do what I ask you . For the sake of the old days of which you spoke , the dear old days which can never come again — "
234181	234192	234194	234194	he	532	" By G – – – – ! they can , "
234196	234206	234194	234194	he	532	" They can come back , and they shall . "
234207	234250	234194	234194	he	532	" Never . But you can still do me a kindness . Go away , and leave me . Go to the sideboard , and then do not come back . You are doing me an injury while you remain with me . "
234251	234254	234255	234255	he	532	" Cora , "
234295	234305	234306	234306	she	488	" I will not have it , Mr. Fitzgerald , "
234313	234344	234306	234306	she	488	" I will not have it . Do as I bid you . Go and leave me , and do not return . I tell you that we are watched . "
234406	234412	234414	234414	Burgo	427	" Who is watching us ? "
234416	234435	234414	234414	Burgo	427	" and what does it matter ? If you are minded to do as I have asked you — "
234436	234456	234507	234507	her	5867	" But I am not so minded . Do you not know that you insult me by proposing it ? "
234457	234489	234507	234507	her	5867	" Yes;—it is an insult , Cora,—unless such an offer be a joy to you . If you wish to be my wife instead of his , it is no insult . "
234490	234497	234498	234498	Her	5867	" How can I be that ? "
234528	234562	234507	234507	her	5867	" Come with me,—abroad , and you shall yet be my wife . You got my letter ? Do what I asked you , then . Come with me — to - night . "
234584	234588	234589	234589	she	5867	" Mr. Fitzgerald , "
234592	234624	234589	234589	she	5867	" I asked you to go and leave me . If you do not do so , I must get up and leave you . It will be much more difficult . "
234625	234633	234655	234655	you	532	" And is that to be all ? "
234634	234641	234655	234655	you	532	" All;—at any rate , now . "
234660	234662	234655	234655	you	532	" now "
234691	234697	234698	234698	he	532	" I will not go , "
234729	234745	234698	234698	he	532	" I will not go till you tell me that you will see me again . "
234746	234750	234751	234751	she	5867	" I will , "
234764	234767	234768	234768	he	532	" When,—when,—when ? "
234937	234943	234945	234945	she	488	" Here is Mr. Palliser , "
235047	235057	235058	235058	she	488	" I thought you were gone home hours ago , "
235061	235067	235068	235068	he	485	" I did go home , "
235071	235084	235068	235068	he	485	" but I thought I might as well come back for you . "
235085	235132	235039	235040	Lady Glencora	488	" What a model of a husband ! Well ; I am ready . Only , what shall we do about Jane ? Mr. Fitzgerald , I left a scarf in your aunt 's room,—a little black and yellow scarf,—would you mind getting it for me ? "
235133	235139	235141	235142	Mr. Palliser	485	" I will fetch it , "
235144	235160	235141	235142	Mr. Palliser	485	" and I will tell your cousin that the carriage shall come back for her . "
235161	235168	235170	235170	Burgo	427	" If you will allow me — "
235172	235178	235180	235181	Mr. Palliser	485	" I will do it , "
235306	235314	235315	235315	he	427	" I will say good - night , "
235318	235326	235327	235327	she	488	" Good - night , Mr. Fitzgerald , "
235411	235421	235422	235422	she	488	" And what shall we do about Mrs. Marsham ? "
235442	235448	235422	235422	she	488	" I had forgotten her . "
235449	235456	235457	235457	he	427	" Mrs. Marsham has gone home , "
235460	235466	235422	235422	she	488	" Have you seen her ? "
235467	235470	235422	235422	she	488	" Yes . "
235471	235478	235422	235422	she	488	" When did you see her ? "
235479	235486	235502	235502	he	427	" She came to Park Lane . "
235487	235494	235502	235502	he	427	" What made her do that ? "
235546	235564	235565	235565	she	488	" What made Mrs. Marsham go to you at Park Lane after she left Lady Monk 's ? "
235588	235594	235596	235597	Lady Glencora	488	" I suppose she went , "
235599	235615	235596	235597	Lady Glencora	488	" to tell you that I was dancing with Mr. Fitzgerald . Was that it ? "
235616	235630	235569	235570	Mr. Palliser	485	" I think , Glencora , we had better not discuss it now . "
235631	235703	235704	235705	Mr. Palliser	485	" I do n't mean to discuss it now , or ever . If you did not wish me to see Mr. Fitzgerald you should not have sent me to Lady Monk 's . But , Plantagenet , I hope you will forgive me if I say that no consideration shall induce me to receive again as a guest , in my own house , either Mrs. Marsham or Mr. Bott . "
235910	235916	235917	235917	Alice	337	" I will marry you , "
235935	236006	235917	235917	Alice	337	words,—"I will marry you for certain reasons of my own , which in my present condition make it seem that that arrangement will be more convenient to me than any other that I can make ; but pray understand that there is no love mixed up with this . There is another man whom I love;—only , for those reasons above hinted , I do not care to marry him . "
236369	236373	236352	236352	he	357	" accursed place , "
236378	236383	236391	236391	I	0	" obstinate old idiot , "
236509	236514	236515	236515	he	357	" Think of him , "
236521	236562	236515	236515	he	357	" walking into a man 's house , with pistols sufficient to shoot every one there , and doing it as though he were killing rats ! What was Nelson at Trafalgar to that ? Nelson had nothing to fear ! "
236582	236591	236580	236580	He	357	" looked the whole thing in the face , "
236596	236663	236580	236580	He	357	" and told himself that all scruples and squeamishness are bosh,—child 's tales . And so they are . Who lives as though they fear either heaven or hell ? And if we do live without such fear or respect , what is the use of telling lies to ourselves ? To throw it all to the dogs , as Palmer did , is more manly . "
236664	236669	236670	236675	some hearer of George 's doctrine	5907	" And be hanged , "
236678	236709	236710	236710	Vavasor	357	" Yes , and be hanged,—if such is your destiny . But you hear of the one who is hanged , but hear nothing of the twenty who are not . "
236916	236921	236922	236922	he	357	" Beastly old idiot ! "
236927	236941	236922	236922	he	357	" he must have his chance as other men have , I suppose , "
237027	237035	237037	237038	Mr. Scruby	435	" A stitch in time saves nine , "
237054	237122	237037	237038	Mr. Scruby	435	" And I 'll tell you what , Mr. Vavasor,—of course I 've my outstanding bills for the last affair . That 's no fault of yours , for the things came so sharp one on another that my fellows have n't had time to make it out . But if you 'll put me in funds for what I must be out of pocket in June — "
237123	237132	237037	237038	Mr. Scruby	435	" Will it be so soon as June ? "
237133	237157	237037	237038	Mr. Scruby	435	" They are talking of June . Why , then , I 'll lump the two bills together when it 's all over . "
237654	237734	237646	237646	he	9538	" Mr. Vavasor;—oh , yes . He had heard the name . Yes ; he was in the habit of acting for his very old friend Mr. John Grey . He had acted for Mr. John Grey , and for Mr. John Grey 's father,—he or his partner,—he believed he might say , for about half a century . There could not be a nicer gentleman than Mr. John Grey;—and such a pretty child as he used to be ! "
237848	237857	237859	237859	he	601	" The fat had got into the fire , "
238045	238056	238058	238059	Mr. Tombe	601	" The prettiest child I ever saw , Mr. Vavasor ! "
238080	238085	238087	238087	George	357	" I dare say , "
238089	238098	238087	238087	George	357	" Yes , indeed,—ugh — ugh — ugh . "
238099	238133	238087	238087	George	357	" Can you tell me , Mr. Tombe , whether either you or he have anything to do with the payment of certain sums to my credit at Messrs. Hock and Block 's ? "
238134	238148	238150	238151	Mr. Tombe	601	" Messrs. Hock and Block 's , the bankers,—in Lom — bard Street ? "
238159	238166	238168	238168	Vavasor	357	" Yes ; I bank there , "
238172	238178	238168	238168	Vavasor	357	" A most respectable house . "
238179	238196	238087	238087	George	357	" Has any money been paid there to my credit , by you , Mr. Tombe ? "
238197	238213	238087	238087	George	357	" May I ask you why you put the question to me , Mr. Vavasor ? "
238214	238280	238168	238168	Vavasor	357	" Well , I do n't think you may . That is to say , my reason for asking it can have nothing to do with yours for replying to it . If you have had no hand in any such payment , there is an end of it , and I need not take up your time by saying anything more on the subject . "
238281	238303	238087	238087	George	357	" I am not prepared to go that length , Mr. Vavasor,—not altogether to go that length,—ugh — ugh — ugh . "
238304	238319	238087	238087	George	357	" Then , will you tell me what you have done in the matter ? "
238320	238340	238341	238341	Pinkle	680	" Well,—upon my word , you 've taken me a little by surprise . Let me see . Pinkle,—Pinkle . "
238375	238402	238367	238367	Pinkle	680	" Pinkle , did n't we pay some money into Hock and Block 's a few weeks since , to the credit of Mr. George Vavasor ? "
238403	238409	238411	238411	Pinkle	680	" Did we , sir ? "
238438	238483	238484	238484	Vavasor	357	" I think we did . Just look Pinkle;—and , Pinkle,—see the date , and let me know all about it . It 's fine bright weather for this time of year , Mr. Vavasor ; but these easterly winds!—ugh — ugh — ugh ! "
238531	238549	238551	238552	Mr. Tombe	601	" Perhaps you 'll let us write you a line when we have looked into the matter ? "
238554	238562	238564	238564	Vavasor	357	" I 'd rather know at once , "
238566	238607	238564	238564	Vavasor	357	" I do n't suppose it can take you very long to find out whether you have paid money to my account , by order of Mr. Grey . At any rate , I must know before I go away . "
238608	238613	238615	238617	the old man	1427	" Pinkle , Pinkle ! "
238627	238646	238624	238624	Pinkle	680	" Well , Pinkle , was anything of the kind done , or is my memory deceiving me ? "
238684	238691	238693	238693	Pinkle	680	" I was going to look , "
238701	238713	238715	238715	Vavasor	357	" I 'm sorry to give your clerk so much trouble , "
238722	238746	238715	238715	Vavasor	357	" and I think it must be unnecessary . Surely you know whether Mr. Grey has commissioned you to pay money for me ? "
238747	238794	238824	238825	Mr. Tombe	601	" We have so many things to do , Mr. Vavasor ; and so many clients . We have , indeed . You see , it is n't only one gentleman 's affairs . But I think there was something done . I do , indeed . "
238795	238804	238806	238806	Vavasor	357	" What is Mr. John Grey 's address ? "
238811	238822	238824	238825	Mr. Tombe	601	" Number 5 , Suffolk Street , Pall Mall East , "
238919	238926	238928	238928	Vavasor	357	" Number 5 , Suffolk Street , "
238935	238960	238928	238928	Vavasor	357	" Perhaps it will be better that I should go to him , as you do not seem inclined to give me any information . "
239002	239007	239009	239010	Mr. Tombe	601	" Pinkle , Pinkle , "
239012	239019	239009	239010	Mr. Tombe	601	" Never mind ; never mind . "
239967	239971	239972	239972	he	357	" Mr. Grey , "
239979	239993	239972	239972	he	357	" I was this moment going to call on you at your lodgings . "
239994	240008	239976	239976	himself	357	" At my lodgings , were you ? Shall I return with you ? "
240009	240014	240016	240016	Vavasor	356	" If you please , "
240136	240148	240150	240150	Grey	353	" If you will allow me , I have the key , "
240252	240262	240263	240263	he	353	" Will you take a chair , Mr. Vavasor ? "
240266	240269	240271	240271	Vavasor	356	" No , "
240273	240279	240281	240281	he	353	" I will stand up . "
240350	240364	240366	240366	Vavasor	356	" I have come here from Mr. Tombe 's office in the City , "
240368	240388	240366	240366	Vavasor	356	" to ask you of what nature has been the interference which you have taken in my money matters ? "
240462	240474	240475	240475	he	353	" Do you say that you have come from Mr. Tombe ? "
240478	240506	240475	240475	he	353	" I think you heard me say so . I have come here direct from Mr. Tombe 's chambers . He is your lawyer , I believe ? "
240507	240512	240420	240421	Mr. Tombe	601	" He is so . "
240513	240549	240439	240439	he	353	" And I have come from him to ask you what interference you have lately taken in my money matters . When you have answered that , I shall have other questions to ask you . "
240550	240573	240475	240475	he	353	" But , Mr. Vavasor , has it occurred to you that I may not be disposed to answer questions so asked ? "
240574	240632	240439	240439	he	353	" It has not occurred to me to think that you will prevaricate . If there has been no such interference , I will ask your pardon , and go away ; but if there has been such interference on your part , I have a right to demand that you shall explain to me its nature . "
240688	240732	240738	240738	Vavasor	357	" There has been such interference , Mr. Vavasor , if you choose to call it so . Money , to the extent of two thousand pounds , I think , has by my directions been paid to your credit by Mr. Tombe . "
240733	240736	240738	240738	Vavasor	357	" Well , "
240759	240776	240738	240738	Vavasor	357	" I hardly know how to explain all the circumstances under which this has been done . "
240777	240792	240793	240793	Grey	353	" I dare say not ; but , nevertheless , you must explain them . "
240907	240919	240920	240920	he	357	" My difficulty in explaining it comes from consideration for you , "
240923	240984	240920	240920	he	357	" Then I beg that your difficulty will cease , and that you will have no consideration for me . We are so circumstanced towards each other that any consideration must be humbug and nonsense . At any rate , I intend to have none for you . Now , let me know why you have meddled with my matters . "
240985	241000	240874	240874	Vavasor	357	" I think I might , perhaps , better refer you to your uncle . "
241001	241030	240881	240881	he	357	" No , sir ; Mr. Tombe is not my uncle 's lawyer . My uncle never heard his name , unless he heard of it from you . "
241031	241075	241167	241167	he	357	" But it was by agreement with your uncle that I commissioned Mr. Tombe to raise for you the money you were desirous of borrowing from your cousin . We thought it better that her fortune should not be for the moment disturbed . "
241076	241129	241167	241167	he	357	" But what had you to do with it ? Why should you have done it ? In the first place , I do n't believe your story ; it is altogether improbable . But why should he come to you of all men to raise money on his daughter 's behalf ? "
241130	241149	241151	241152	Mr. Grey	353	" Unless you can behave yourself with more discretion , Mr. Vavasor , you must leave the room , "
241171	241199	241167	241167	he	357	" It was I who suggested to your uncle that this arrangement should be made . I did not wish to see Miss Vavasor 's fortune squandered . "
241200	241243	241167	241167	he	357	" And what was her fortune to you , sir ? Are you aware that she is engaged to me as my wife ? I ask you , sir , whether you are aware that Miss Vavasor is to be my wife ? "
241244	241261	241167	241167	he	357	" I must altogether decline to discuss with you Miss Vavasor 's present or future position . "
241262	241349	241167	241167	he	357	" By heavens , then , you shall hear me discuss it ! She was engaged to you , and she has given you your dismissal . If you had understood anything of the conduct which is usual among gentlemen , or if you had had any particle of pride in you , sir , you would have left her and never mentioned her name again . I now find you meddling with her money matters , so as to get a hold upon her fortune . "
241350	241359	241167	241167	he	357	" I have no hold upon her fortune . "
241360	241459	241167	241167	he	357	" Yes , sir , you have . You do not advance two thousand pounds without knowing that you have security . She has rejected you ; and in order that you may be revenged , or that you may have some further hold upon her,—that she may be in some sort within your power , you have contrived this rascally pettifogging way of obtaining power over her income . The money shall be repaid at once , with any interest that can be due ; and if I find you interfering again , I will expose you . "
241460	241464	241466	241466	Grey	353	" Mr. Vavasor , "
241496	241517	241481	241481	his	353	" you have used words in your anger which I can not allow to pass . You must recall them . "
241518	241538	241481	241481	his	353	" What were the words ? I said that you were a pettifogging rascal . I now repeat them . "
241604	241612	241613	241613	he	353	" There is no help for it , "
241904	241908	241910	241910	Grey	353	" Mr. Jones , "
241916	241936	241910	241910	Grey	353	" if that gentleman does not leave the house , I must get you to search for a policeman . "
242048	242057	242059	242059	Jones	459	" What 's it all about , sir ? "
242125	242134	242136	242136	Jones	459	" What 's it all about , sir ? "
242145	242164	242136	242136	Jones	459	" That man has ill - used me , and I 've punished him ; that 's all . "
242165	242174	242176	242177	the tailor	6040	" I do n't know much about punishing , "
242179	242211	242176	242177	the tailor	6040	" It seems to me he pitched you down pretty clean out of the room above . I think the best thing you can do now is to walk yourself off . "
243520	243537	243512	243512	he	357	" Oh , Alice ! that this thing should have come upon me through thy fault ! "
243925	243938	243939	243939	he	459	" Dear , dear , sir — this is a terrible affair ! "
243951	243959	243961	243961	Grey	353	" It was very disagreeable , certainly , "
243963	243971	243973	243974	the tailor	6040	" Was the gentleman known to you ? "
243976	243985	243973	243974	the tailor	6040	" Yes ; I know who he is . "
243986	243992	243939	243939	he	459	" Any quarrel , sir ? "
243993	244013	243939	243939	he	459	" Well , yes . I should not have pushed him down stairs had he not quarrelled with me . "
244014	244029	243973	243974	the tailor	6040	" We can have the police after him if you wish it , sir ? "
244030	244039	243939	243939	he	459	" I do n't wish it at all . "
244040	244057	243973	243974	the tailor	6040	" Or we might manage to polish him off in any other way , you know . "
244463	244471	244472	244474	the old man	1427	" What the mischief does it signify , "
244479	244508	244472	244474	the old man	1427	evening;—"what difference will it make whether I am dead or alive , unless it is that George would turn you out of the house directly he gets it . "
244509	244522	244524	244524	Kate	356	" I was not thinking of any one but yourself , sir , "
244533	244546	244548	244549	the Squire	1192	" You wo n't be troubled to think of me much longer , "
244706	244726	244727	244727	he	1427	" You 'll live to be robbed by him , and turned out as naked as you were born , "
244824	244832	244833	244833	he	1427	" I know you are a fool , "
244836	244851	244833	244833	he	1427	" about all matters of business;—more of a fool than even women generally are . "
244866	244873	244874	244874	he	1427	" I want to see Gogram , "
244877	244906	244874	244874	he	1427	" Do you write to him a line , telling him to come here to - day,—he or one of his men,—and send it at once by Peter . "
244935	244953	244955	244955	Kate	356	" Do n't you think you 'd better put it off till you are a little stronger ? "
245053	245067	245068	245069	the Squire	1192	" What should you do with the estate if I left it you ? "
245139	245150	245151	245151	she	356	" I think I should give it to my brother , "
245154	245171	245173	245173	he	1192	" Then I 'm d – – – – if I 'll leave it to you , "
245204	245212	245213	245213	she	356	" If I were you , grandfather , "
245220	245248	245213	245213	she	356	" I would not trust myself to alter family arrangements whilst I was ill . I 'm sure you would advise any one else against doing so . "
245249	245268	245269	245269	he	1192	" And if I were to leave it to Alice , she 'd give it to him too , "
245278	245330	245269	245269	he	1192	" What it is you see in him , I never could even guess . He 's as ugly as a baboon , with his scarred face . He has never done anything to show himself a clever fellow . Kate , give me some of that bottle the man sent . "
245345	245358	245359	245360	the Squire	1192	" Where did he get the money to pay for his election ? "
245372	245392	245359	245360	the Squire	1192	" They would n't give such a one as him credit a yard further than they could see him . "
245393	245403	245405	245405	Kate	356	" I do n't know where he got it , "
245409	245419	245405	245405	Kate	356	" He has not had yours ; has he ? "
245420	245429	245359	245360	the Squire	1192	" He would not take it , sir . "
245430	245438	245359	245360	the Squire	1192	" And you offered it to him ? "
245439	245444	245405	245405	Kate	356	" Yes , sir . "
245445	245453	245359	245360	the Squire	1192	" And he has not had it ? "
245454	245463	245359	245360	the Squire	1192	" Not a penny of it , sir . "
245464	245480	245405	245405	Kate	356	" And what made you offer it to him after what I said to you ? "
245481	245488	245490	245490	Kate	356	" Because it was my own , "
245494	245527	245490	245490	Kate	356	" You 're the biggest idiot that ever I heard of , and you 'll know it yourself some day . Go away now , and let me know when Gogram comes . "
246470	246492	246493	246493	he	1192	" I ca n't eat , and I suppose it wo n't hurt you if I take my wine at once , "
246538	246560	246522	246522	his	1192	" But you should eat something , sir ; will you have a bit of toast to sop in your wine ? "
246563	246565	246522	246522	his	1192	" sop "
246577	246593	246572	246574	the old Squire	1244	" Sopped toast ! why am I to spoil the only thing I can enjoy ? "
246594	246611	246645	246645	he	1192	" But the wine would do you more good if you would take something with it . "
246612	246643	246645	246645	he	1192	" Good ! Nothing will do me any good any more . As for eating , you know I ca n't eat . What 's the use of bothering me ? "
246804	246825	246788	246788	she	356	" You are a good girl , Kate . I wish you had been a boy , that 's all . "
246826	246846	246847	246847	she	356	" If I had , I should n't , perhaps , have been here to take care of you , "
246852	246881	246847	246847	she	356	" No ; you 'd have been like your brother , no doubt . Not that I think there could have been two so bad as he is . "
246882	246900	246788	246788	she	356	" Oh , grandfather , if he has offended you , you should try to forgive him . "
246901	246948	246788	246788	she	356	" Try to forgive him ! How often have I forgiven him without any trying ? Why did he come down here the other day , and insult me for the last time ? Why did n't he keep away , as I had bidden him ? "
246949	246961	246847	246847	she	356	" But you gave him leave to see you , sir . "
246962	246994	246788	246788	she	356	" I did n't give him leave to treat me like that . Never mind ; he will find that , old as I am , I can punish an insult . "
246995	247008	247010	247010	Kate	356	" You have n't done anything , sir , to injure him ? "
247012	247039	247010	247010	Kate	356	" I have made another will , that 's all . Do you suppose I had that man here all the way from Penrith for nothing ? "
247040	247048	246847	246847	she	356	" But it is n't done yet ? "
247049	247082	246847	246847	she	356	" I tell you it is done . If I left him the whole property it would be gone in two years ' time . What 's the use of doing it ? "
247083	247104	247010	247010	Kate	356	" But for his life , sir ! You had promised him that he should have it for his life . "
247105	247157	246847	246847	she	356	" How dare you tell me that ? I never promised him . As my heir , he would have had it all , if he would have behaved himself with common decency . Even though I disliked him , as I always have done , he should have had it . "
247158	247168	246847	246847	she	356	" And you have taken it from him altogether ? "
247169	247180	246847	246847	she	356	" I shall answer no questions about it , Kate . "
247240	247256	247257	247257	he	1192	" There is n't any good in so much of it , all at once , "
247819	247822	247824	247824	Kate	356	" Grandfather , "
247826	247842	247824	247824	Kate	356	" would you like me to stay in the room with you to - night ? "
247946	247959	247960	247960	she	356	" It will be a great comfort to me in my distress , "
247963	247979	247960	247960	she	356	" and it will be a satisfaction to you to have seen your father again . "
248074	248077	248078	248078	she	356	" not , "
248081	248121	248122	248122	she	356	" that I think her coming will be of material service , but I feel the loneliness of the house will be too much for me at such a time . I must leave it for you to decide , "
248125	248136	248122	248122	she	356	" whether you had better be here . If anything should happen,"—people
248151	248167	248122	248122	she	356	name,—"I will send you a message , and no doubt you would come at once . "
248273	248281	248282	248282	she	356	" I write with a heavy heart , "
248285	248400	248282	248282	she	356	" because I know it will be a great blow to you . He gave me to understand that in this will he left everything away from you . I can not declare that he said so directly . Indeed I can not remember his words ; but that was the impression he left on me . The day before he had asked me what I should do if he gave me the estate ; but of course I treated that as a joke . I have no idea what he put into his will . I have not even attempted to guess . But now I have told you all that I know . "
250029	250042	250043	250043	he	357	" I have a right to look upon you as my wife , "
250046	250066	250043	250043	he	357	" and , as such , I will not allow you to keep that man 's things about you . "
250259	250270	250271	250271	he	357	" That , madam , is a matter of course , "
251936	252179	252182	252182	she	6339	" Dear Alice , to - day I received your letter , and to - day our poor old grandfather died . Tell my uncle John , with my love , of his father 's death . You will understand that I can not write much now about that other matter ; but I must tell you , even at such a moment as this , that there shall be no quarrel between you and me . There shall be none at least on my side . I can not say more till a few days shall have passed by . He is lying up - stairs , a corpse . I have telegraphed to George , and I suppose he will come down . I think my aunt Greenow will come also , as I had written to her before , seeing that I wanted the comfort of having her here . Uncle John will of course come or not as he thinks fitting . I do n't know whether I am in a position to say that I shall be glad to see him ; but I should be very glad . He and you will know that I can , as yet , tell you nothing further . The lawyer is to see the men about the funeral . Nothing , I suppose , will be done till George comes . Your own cousin and friend , Kate Vavasor . "
252188	252213	252182	252182	she	6339	" My own Alice,—If you will let me , you shall be my sister , and be the nearest to me and the dearest . "
252293	252296	252297	252297	she	337	" Papa , "
252300	252316	252297	252297	she	337	" there is news from Westmoreland ; bad news , which you hardly expected yet . "
252317	252323	252325	252326	John Vavasor	338	" My father is dead , "
252342	252350	252351	252351	he	805	" Of course I shall go down , "
252368	252405	252351	252351	he	805	" Does she think I shall not follow my father to the grave , because I dislike her brother ? What does she mean by saying that there shall be no quarrel between you and her ? "
252406	252415	252417	252417	Alice	337	" I will explain that at another time , "
252448	252460	252461	252461	he	805	" I 'll go by the mail train to - night , "
252464	252483	252461	252461	he	805	" It will be very disagreeable , but I ought to be there when the will is opened . "
252656	252659	252660	252660	she	337	" Papa , "
252674	252694	252660	252660	she	337	" I think I ought to tell you before you go that everything is over between me and George . "
252695	252703	252705	252706	her father	805	" Have you quarrelled with him too ? "
252712	252761	252705	252706	her father	805	" I should perhaps say that he has quarrelled with me . But , dear papa , pray do not question me at present . I will tell you all when you come back , but I thought it right that you should know this before you went . "
252762	252770	252660	252660	she	337	" It has been his doing then ? "
252771	252806	252660	252660	she	337	" I can not explain it to you in a hurry like this . Papa , you may understand something of the shame which I feel , and you should not question me now . "
252807	252812	252705	252706	her father	805	" And John Grey ? "
252813	252823	252660	252660	she	337	" There is nothing different in regard to him . "
252824	252885	252887	252887	he	6355	" I 'll be shot if I can understand you . George , you know , has had two thousand pounds of your money,—of yours or somebody else 's . Well , we ca n't talk about it now , as I must be off . Thinking as I do of George , I 'm glad of it,—that 's all . "
253074	253083	253085	253086	the uncle	6371	" So my father has gone , George , "
253122	253125	253127	253127	George	357	" Yes , "
253129	253151	253127	253127	George	357	" he has gone at last . I wonder what we shall find to have been his latest act of injustice . "
253298	253308	253309	253309	he	357	" We sha n't get any conveyance at Shap , "
253312	253325	253309	253309	he	357	" Had n't we better go over in a chaise from Kendal ? "
253496	253502	253504	253505	Mrs. Greenow	405	" So you are George , "
253514	253521	253523	253523	he	357	" Yes ; I 'm George , "
253525	253532	253534	253535	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And a Member of Parliament ! "
253537	253556	253534	253535	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It 's quite an honour to the family . I felt so proud when I heard it ! "
253578	253586	253587	253587	she	405	" Papa 's time was fully come , "
253590	253615	253587	253587	she	405	" though , to tell the truth , I had no idea that he was so weak as Kate describes him to have been . "
253616	253622	253624	253625	John Vavasor	338	" Nor I , either , "
253627	253640	253624	253625	John Vavasor	338	" He went to church with us here on Christmas - day . "
253641	253664	253587	253587	she	405	" Did he , indeed ? Dear , dear ! He seems at last to have gone off just like poor Greenow . "
253675	253686	253666	253666	she	405	" I think you did n't know Greenow , John ? "
253687	253693	253695	253696	her brother	1120	" I met him once , "
253698	253751	253695	253696	her brother	1120	" Ah ! he was n't to be known and understood in that way . I 'm aware there was a little prejudice , because of his being in trade , but we wo n't talk of that now . Where should I have been without him , tradesman or no tradesman ? "
253752	253763	253695	253696	her brother	1120	" I 've no doubt he was an excellent man . "
253764	253787	253695	253696	her brother	1120	" You may say that , John . Ah , well ! we ca n't keep everything in this life for ever . "
253888	253897	253899	253900	Mrs. Greenow	405	" We 're all grass of the field , "
253910	253925	253899	253900	Mrs. Greenow	405	" and must be cut down and put into the oven in our turns . "
254053	254061	254102	254102	he	357	" What has brought that woman here ? "
254070	254077	254079	254079	Kate	356	" I asked her to come , "
254081	254092	254094	254094	George	357	" And why did you ask her to come here ? "
254231	254278	254211	254211	he	357	" I asked her , George , before my poor grandfather 's death , when I thought that he would linger perhaps for weeks . My life here alone with him , without any other woman in the house beside the servants , was very melancholy . "
254279	254291	254211	254211	he	357	" Why did you not ask Alice to come to you ? "
254292	254299	254301	254301	Kate	356	" Alice could not have come , "
254308	254337	254301	254301	Kate	356	" I do n't know why she should n't have come . I wo n't have that woman about the place . She disgraced herself by marrying a blacksmith—. "
254338	254357	254211	254211	he	357	" Why , George , it was you yourself who advised me to go and stay with her . "
254358	254400	254211	254211	he	357	" That 's a very different thing . Now that he 's dead , and she 's got his money , it 's all very well that you should go to her occasionally ; but I wo n't have her here . "
254401	254422	254211	254211	he	357	" It 's natural that she should come to her father 's house at her father 's death - bed . "
254423	254536	254211	254211	he	357	" I hate to be told that things are natural . It always means humbug . I do n't suppose she cared for the old man any more than I did,—or than she cared for the other old man who married her . People are such intense hypocrites . There 's my uncle John , pulling a long face because he has come into this house , and he will pull it as long as the body lies up there ; and yet for the last twenty years there 's nothing on earth he has so much hated as going to see his father . When are they going to bury him ? "
254537	254548	254211	254211	he	357	" On Saturday , the day after to - morrow . "
254549	254569	254211	254211	he	357	" Why could n't they do it to - morrow , so that we could get away before Sunday ? "
254570	254579	254581	254581	Kate	356	" He only died on Monday , George , "
254585	254594	254581	254581	Kate	356	" Psha ! Who has got the will ? "
254595	254628	254211	254211	he	357	" Mr. Gogram . He was here yesterday , and told me to tell you and uncle John that he would have it with him when he came back from the funeral . "
254629	254640	254642	254642	George	357	" What has my uncle John to do with it ? "
254646	254664	254642	254642	George	357	" I shall go over to Penrith this afternoon and make Gogram give it up to me . "
254665	254677	254211	254211	he	357	" I do n't think he 'll do that , George . "
254678	254720	254211	254211	he	357	" What right has he to keep it ? What right has he to it at all ? How do I know that he has really got the old man 's last will ? Where did my grandfather keep his papers ? "
254721	254749	254211	254211	he	357	" In that old secretary , as he used to call it ; the one that stands in the dining - room . It is sealed up . "
254750	254755	254211	254211	he	357	" Who sealed it ? "
254756	254766	254211	254211	he	357	" Mr. Gogram did,—Mr . Gogram and I together . "
254767	254777	254211	254211	he	357	" What the deuce made you meddle with it ? "
254778	254801	254211	254211	he	357	" I merely assisted him . But I believe he was quite right . I think it is usual in such cases . "
254802	254889	254211	254211	he	357	" Balderdash ! You are thinking of some old trumpery of former days . Till I know to the contrary , everything here belongs to me as heir - at - law , and I do not mean to allow of any interference till I know for certain that my rights have been taken from me . And I wo n't accept a death - bed will . What a man chooses to write when his fingers will hardly hold the pen , goes for nothing . "
254890	254904	254211	254211	he	357	" You ca n't suppose that I wish to interfere with your rights ? "
254905	254910	254211	254211	he	357	" I hope not . "
254911	254916	254211	254211	he	357	" Oh , George ! "
254917	255009	254211	254211	he	357	" Well ; I say , I hope not . But I know there are those who would . Do you think my uncle John would not interfere with me if he could ? By – – – – ! if he does , he shall find that he does it to his cost . I 'll lead him such a life through the courts , for the next two or three years , that he 'll wish that he had remained in Chancery Lane , and had never left it . "
255039	255050	255058	255058	George	357	" Would Miss Kate and Mr. George go with them ? "
255051	255055	255058	255058	George	357	" Mr. Vavasor ! "
255076	255085	255086	255086	she	3707	" Yes , sir ; the old Squire , "
255089	255096	255086	255086	she	3707	" Will you come , George ? "
255100	255157	255097	255097	Kate	356	" No ; what should I go there for ? Why should I pretend an interest in the dead body of a man whom I hated and who hated me;—whose very last act , as far as I know as yet , was an attempt to rob me ? I wo n't go and see him . "
255320	255327	255329	255330	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Poor , dear old man ! "
255341	255380	255329	255330	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Do you remember , John , how he used to scold me , and say that I should never come to good . He has said the same thing to you , Kate , I dare say ? "
255381	255390	255392	255392	Kate	356	" He has been very kind to me , "
255415	255423	255425	255426	John Vavasor;—"belonging	338	" He was a fine old gentleman , "
255426	255476	255425	255426	John Vavasor;—"belonging	338	Vavasor;—"belonging to days that are now gone by , but by no means the less of a gentleman on that account . I do n't know that he ever did an unjust or ungenerous act to any one . Come , Kate , we may as well go down . "
255608	255612	255605	255605	She	405	" poor George , "
255793	255806	255807	255807	George	357	" I 'm told that you have got my grandfather 's will , "
255819	255827	255829	255830	Mr. Gogram	684	" I have it in my pocket , "
255832	255846	255829	255830	Mr. Gogram	684	" and purpose to read it as soon as we return from church . "
255847	255865	255866	255866	George	357	" Is it usual to take a will away from a man 's house in that way ? "
255869	255873	255875	255876	the attorney	9528	" Quite usual , "
255878	255894	255875	255876	the attorney	9528	" and in this case it was done at the express desire of the testator . "
255895	255904	255906	255907	John Vavasor	338	" I think it is the common practice , "
256075	256085	256087	256088	the attorney	9528	" Shall we go into the other room now ? "
256241	256249	256251	256252	Mr. Gogram	684	" Gentlemen , will you sit down ? "
256260	256267	256269	256269	George	357	" I prefer to stand here , "
256280	256287	256289	256289	George	357	" Before that paper is read , "
256291	256330	256289	256289	George	357	" I think it right to say a few words . I do n't know what it contains , but I believe it to have been executed by my grandfather only an hour or two before his death . "
256331	256342	256344	256345	the attorney	9528	" On the day before he died,—early in the day , "
256347	256374	256344	256345	the attorney	9528	" Well,—the day before he died ; it is the same thing,—while he was dying , in fact . He never got out of bed afterwards . "
256375	256422	256289	256289	George	357	" He was not in bed at the time , Mr. Vavasor . Not that it would have mattered if he had been . And he came down to dinner on that day . I do n't understand , however , why you make these observations . "
256423	256485	256344	256345	the attorney	9528	" If you 'll listen to me you will understand . I make them because I deny my grandfather 's fitness to make a will in the last moments of his existence , and at such an age . I saw him a few weeks ago , and he was not fit to be trusted with the management of property then . "
256486	256504	256506	256507	the uncle	6371	" I do not think this is the time , George , to put forward such objections , "
256509	256515	256517	256517	George	357	" I think it is , "
256519	256577	256517	256517	George	357	" I believe that that paper purports to be an instrument by which I should be villanously defrauded if it were allowed to be held as good . Therefore I protest against it now , and shall question it at law if action be taken on it . You can read it now , if you please . "
256578	256587	256589	256590	Mr. Gogram	684	" Oh , yes , I shall read , "
256592	256609	256589	256590	Mr. Gogram	684	" and I say that it is as valid a will as ever a man signed . "
256610	256625	256517	256517	George	357	" And I say it 's not . That 's the difference between us . "
256865	256871	256873	256874	the attorney	9528	" And , Mr. Vavasor , "
256882	256958	256873	256874	the attorney	9528	" you will , I fear , get very little by that latter clause . The estate now owes nothing ; but I doubt whether the Squire had fifty pounds in his banker 's hands when he died , and the value of the property about the place is very small . He has been unwilling to spend anything during the last ten years , but has paid off every shilling that the property owed . "
256959	256966	256968	256968	George	357	" It is as I supposed , "
256993	257038	256970	256970	His	357	" The old man has endeavoured in his anger to rob me of everything because I would not obey him in his wickedness when I was here with him a short while before he died . Such a will as that can stand nowhere . "
257039	257051	257053	257054	the attorney	9528	" As to that I have nothing to say at present , "
257056	257068	257053	257054	the attorney	9528	" Where is his other will,—the one he made before that ? "
257069	257080	256970	256970	His	357	" If I remember rightly we executed two before this . "
257081	257087	256970	256970	His	357	" And where are they ? "
257088	257126	257053	257054	the attorney	9528	" It is not my business to know , Mr. Vavasor . I believe that I saw him destroy one , but I have no absolute knowledge . As to the other , I can say nothing . "
257127	257136	257138	257138	George	357	" And what do you mean to do ? "
257145	257208	257138	257138	George	357	" Do ! I shall carry out the will . I have no alternative . Your sister is the person chiefly interested under it . She gets five hundred a year for her life ; and if she marries and you do n't , or if she has a son and you do n't , her son will have the whole property . "
257319	257332	257333	257333	he	357	" It is a piece of d – – – – roguery , "
257336	257346	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" What do you mean by that , sir ? "
257355	257386	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" I mean exactly what I say . It is a piece of d – – – – roguery . Who was in the room when that thing was written ? "
257387	257394	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" The signature was witnessed by — "
257395	257416	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" I do n't ask as to the signature . Who was in the room when the thing was written ? "
257417	257425	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" I was here with your grandfather . "
257426	257432	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" And no one else ? "
257433	257453	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" No one else . The presence of any one else at such a time would be very unusual . "
257454	257465	257348	257348	Gogram	684	" Then I regard the document simply as waste paper . "
257483	257494	257496	257497	the attorney	9528	" I never was insulted in such a way before , "
257506	257518	257520	257521	John Vavasor	338	" He is a disappointed and I fear a ruined man , "
257523	257535	257520	257521	John Vavasor	338	" I do not think you need regard what he says . "
257536	257584	257602	257603	the attorney	9528	" But he should not on that account insult me . I have only done my duty . I did not even advise his grandfather . It is mean on his part and unmanly . If he comes in my way again I shall tell him so . "
257585	257600	257602	257603	the attorney	9528	" He probably will not put himself in your way again , Mr. Gogram . "
257631	257643	257645	257646	Mr. Gogram	684	" It 's as good a will as ever was made , "
257648	257664	257645	257646	Mr. Gogram	684	" If he can set that aside , I 'll give up making wills altogether . "
257927	257932	257934	257934	she	8750	" Well , John , "
257936	257944	257934	257934	she	8750	" well ? How is it left ? "
257945	257950	257951	257951	he	338	" Where is Kate ? "
257954	257963	257934	257934	she	8750	" She has gone out with her brother . "
257964	257971	258010	258010	he	338	" Did he take his hat ? "
257972	257991	257934	257934	she	8750	" Oh , yes . He asked her to walk , and she went with him at once . "
257992	258003	258010	258010	he	338	" Then , I suppose , he will tell her , "
258021	258024	258026	258027	the widow	1443	" Bravo , "
258029	258049	258050	258050	George	357	" I 'm delighted . I love Kate dearly : and now she can marry almost whom she pleases . "
258079	258082	258084	258084	he	357	" Kate , "
258086	258103	258084	258084	he	357	" put on your hat and come and walk with me . That business is over . "
258214	258221	258223	258223	Kate	356	" Which way shall we go ? "
258246	258252	258254	258254	George	357	" Up across the fell , "
258256	258275	258254	258254	George	357	" the day is fine , and I want to get away from my uncle for a time . "
258352	258355	258357	258357	George	357	" Well , "
258379	258396	258357	258357	George	357	" do n't you want to know what that dear old man has done for you ? "
258406	258413	258414	258414	he	357	" But perhaps you know already , "
258546	258553	258555	258555	Kate	356	" I know nothing of it , "
258557	258574	258555	258555	Kate	356	" Had I known I should have told you . Your question is unjust to me . "
258575	258582	258584	258584	he	357	" I am beginning to doubt , "
258586	258612	258555	258555	Kate	356	" whether a man can be safe in trusting any one . My grandfather has done his best to rob me of the property altogether . "
258613	258625	258555	258555	Kate	356	" I told you that I feared he would do so . "
258626	258635	258555	258555	Kate	356	" And he has made you his heir . "
258636	258639	258555	258555	Kate	356	" Me ? "
258640	258645	258555	258555	Kate	356	" Yes ; you . "
258646	258658	258555	258555	Kate	356	" He told me distinctly that he would not do that . "
258659	258668	258555	258555	Kate	356	" But he has , I tell you . "
258669	258727	258555	258555	Kate	356	" Then , George , I shall do that which I told him I should do in the event of his making such a will ; for he asked me the question . I told him I should restore the estate to you , and upon that he swore that he would not leave it to me . "
258728	258736	258738	258738	he	6531	" And what a fool you were , "
258746	258774	258738	258738	he	6531	" What an ass ! Why did you tell him that ? You knew that he would not , on that account , do justice to me . "
258775	258782	258555	258555	Kate	356	" He asked me , George . "
258783	258799	258555	258555	Kate	356	" Psha ! now you have ruined me , and you might have saved me . "
258800	258864	258738	258738	he	6531	" But I will save you still , if he has left the estate to me . I do not desire to take it from you . As God in heaven sees me , I have never ceased to endeavour to protect your interests here at Vavasor . I will sign anything necessary to make over my right in the property to you . "
259050	259070	259079	259079	he	1120	" If the will is as you say , George , I will make over my right to you . "
259071	259078	259079	259079	he	1120	" You can make over nothing , "
259082	259121	259079	259079	he	1120	" The old robber has been too cunning for that ; he has left it all in the hands of my uncle John . D – – – – him . D – – – – them both . "
259122	259132	259079	259079	he	1120	" George ! George ! he is dead now . "
259133	259188	259079	259079	he	1120	" Dead ; of course he is dead . What of that ? I wish he had been dead ten years ago,—or twenty . Do you suppose I am to forgive him because he is dead ? I 'll heap his grave with curses , if that can be of avail to punish him . "
259189	259199	259079	259079	he	1120	" You can only punish the living that way . "
259200	259245	259079	259079	he	1120	" And I will punish them;—but not by cursing them . My uncle John shall have such a life of it for the next year or two that he shall bitterly regret the hour in which he has stepped between me and my rights . "
259246	259257	259079	259079	he	1120	" I do not believe that he has done so . "
259258	259289	259079	259079	he	1120	" Not done so ! What was he down here for at Christmas ? Do you pretend to think that that make - believe will was concocted without his knowledge ? "
259290	259318	259079	259079	he	1120	" I 'm sure that he knew nothing of it . I do n't think my grandfather 's mind was made up a week before he died . "
259319	259377	259079	259079	he	1120	" You 'll have to swear that , remember , in a court . I 'm not going to let the matter rest , I can tell you . You 'll have to prove that . How long is it since he asked you what you would do with the estate if he left it to you ? "
259387	259402	259384	259384	she	356	" It was only two days before he died , if I remember rightly . "
259403	259445	259079	259079	he	1120	" But you must remember rightly . You 'll have to swear to it . And now tell me this honestly ; do you believe , in your heart , that he was in a condition fit for making a will ? "
259446	259455	259079	259079	he	1120	" I advised him not to make it . "
259456	259467	259384	259384	she	356	" Why ? why ? What reason did you give ? "
259468	259487	259079	259079	he	1120	" I told him that I thought no man should alter family arrangements when he was so ill . "
259488	259502	259079	259079	he	1120	" Exactly . You told him that . And what did he say ? "
259503	259517	259384	259384	she	356	" He was very angry , and made me send for Mr. Gogram . "
259518	259575	259576	259576	He	6542	" Now , Kate , think a little before you answer me again . If ever you are to do me a good turn , you must do it now . And remember this , I do n't at all want to take anything away from you . Whatever you think is fair you shall have . "
259589	259594	259595	259595	she	6544	" I want nothing , "
259610	259624	259595	259595	she	6544	" George , you do n't understand what it is to be honest . "
259658	259667	259650	259650	Kate	356	" I ca n't say that I do . "
259676	259684	259686	259686	he	6542	" Well , never mind about that , "
259688	259710	259686	259686	he	6542	" you advised my grandfather not to make his will,—thinking , no doubt , that his mind was not clear enough ? "
259721	259727	259728	259728	she	6544	" His mind was clear , "
259731	259748	259728	259728	she	6544	" but I thought that he should not trust his judgement while he was so weak . "
259749	259812	259717	259717	she	6544	" Look here , Kate ; I do believe that you at any rate have no mind to assist in this robbery . That it is a robbery you ca n't have any doubt . I said he had left the estate to you . That is not what he has done . He has left the estate to my uncle John . "
259813	259824	259717	259717	she	6544	" Why tell me , then , what was untrue ? "
259825	259830	259728	259728	she	6544	" Are you disappointed ? "
259831	259859	259728	259728	she	6544	" Of course I am ; uncle John wo n't give it you . George , I do n't understand you ; I do n't , indeed . "
259860	259927	259717	259717	she	6544	" Never mind about that , but listen to me . The estate is left in the hands of John Vavasor ; but he has left you five hundred a year out of it till somebody is twenty - five years old who is not yet born , and probably never will be born . The will itself shows the old fool to have been mad . "
259928	259940	259717	259717	she	6544	" He was no more mad than you are , George . "
259941	259984	259728	259728	she	6544	" Listen to me , I tell you . I do n't mean that he was a raging maniac . Now , you had advised him not to make any new will because you thought he was not in a fit condition ? "
259985	259991	259717	259717	she	6544	" Yes ; I did . "
259992	259999	259717	259717	she	6544	" You can swear to that ? "
260000	260035	259728	259728	she	6544	" I hope I may not be called on to do so . I hope there may be no swearing about it . But if I am asked the question I must swear it . "
260036	260121	259717	259717	she	6544	" Exactly . Now listen till you understand what it is I mean . That will , if it stands , gives all the power over the estate to John Vavasor . It renders you quite powerless as regards any help or assistance that you might be disposed to give to me . But , nevertheless , your interest under the will is greater than his,—or than that of any one else,—for your son would inherit if I have none . Do you understand ? "
260122	260129	259728	259728	she	6544	" Yes ; I think so . "
260130	260149	259717	259717	she	6544	" And your testimony as to the invalidity of the will would be conclusive against all the world . "
260150	260170	259717	259717	she	6544	" I would say in a court what I have told you , if that will do any good . "
260171	260215	260216	260216	Kate	356	" It will not be enough . Look here , Kate ; you must be steadfast here ; everything depends on you . How often have you told me that you will stick to me throughout life ? Now you will be tried . "
260329	260353	260309	260309	he	6546	" But that was what you meant when you advised him not to make the will because you thought his intellect was impaired ! "
260354	260360	260315	260315	his	6546	" No ; not so . "
260361	260389	260315	260315	his	6546	" Stop , Kate , stop . If you will think of it , It was so . What is the meaning of his judgement being weak ? "
260390	260400	260309	260309	he	6546	" I did n't say his judgement was weak . "
260401	260417	260504	260504	he	6547	" But that was what you meant when you advised him not to trust it ! "
260418	260460	260315	260315	his	6546	" Look here , George ; I think I know now what you mean . If anybody asks me if his mind was gone , or his intellect deranged , I can not say that there was anything of the kind . "
260461	260466	260315	260315	his	6546	" You will not ? "
260467	260476	260504	260504	he	6547	" Certainly not . It would be untrue . "
260477	260493	260504	260504	he	6547	" Then you are determined to throw me over and claim the property for yourself . "
260511	260531	260504	260504	he	6547	" And I am to count you also among my enemies ? You had better take care , Kate . "
260864	260867	260869	260869	he	6547	" Kate , "
260874	260982	260869	260869	he	6547	" we will have this out here , if you please . So much , at any rate , shall be settled to - day . You have made many promises to me , and I have believed them . You can now keep them all , by simply saying what you know to be the truth,—that that old man was a drivelling idiot when he made this will . Are you prepared to do me that justice ? Think before you answer me , for , by G – – – – , if I can not have justice among you , I will have revenge . "
260997	261005	261007	261007	she	337	" Take your hand down , George , "
261009	261025	261007	261007	she	337	" I 'm not such a fool that you can frighten me in that way . "
261026	261030	261031	261031	he	6547	" Answer me ! "
261048	261065	261031	261031	he	6547	" Oh , George , that I should live to be so ashamed of my brother ! "
261066	261070	261071	261071	he	6547	" Answer me , "
261081	261183	261077	261077	he	6547	" I have answered you . I will say nothing of the kind that you want me to say . My grandfather , up to the latest moment that I saw him , knew what he was about . He was not an idiot . He was , I believe , only carrying out a purpose fixed long before . You will not make me change what I say by looking at me like that , nor get it by shaking me . You do n't know me , George , if you think you can frighten me like a child . "
261246	261249	261251	261251	he	6556	" Oh , "
261258	261306	261251	261251	he	6556	" That 's to be it ; is it ? That 's your idea of honesty . The very name of the money being your own has been too much for you . I wonder whether you and my uncle had contrived it all between you beforehand ? "
261307	261322	261324	261324	Kate	356	" You will not dare to ask him , because he is a man , "
261352	261402	261251	261251	he	6556	" Shall I not ? You will see what I dare do . As for you , with all your promises—. Kate , you know that I keep my word . Say that you will do as I desire you , or I will be the death of you . "
261403	261413	261415	261415	she	356	" Do you mean that you will murder me ? "
261417	261464	261415	261415	she	356	" Murder you ! yes ; why not ? Treated as I have been among you , do you suppose that I shall stick at anything ? Why should I not murder you — you and Alice , too , seeing how you have betrayed me ? "
261465	261469	261471	261471	she	356	" Poor Alice ! "
261495	261567	261475	261475	she	356	" Poor Alice , indeed ! D – – – – hypocrite ! There 's a pair of you ; cursed , whining , false , intriguing hypocrites . There ; go down and tell your uncle and that old woman there that I threatened to murder you . Tell the judge so , when you 're brought into court to swear me out of my property . You false liar ! "
262167	262186	262161	262161	she	356	" Here I am ; my arm is broken ; and you had better send for a doctor . "
262630	262635	262637	262638	John Vavasor	338	" Dinner is ready , "
262640	262645	262637	262638	John Vavasor	338	" where is George ? "
262646	262653	262655	262656	aunt Greenow	405	" You are wet , Kate , "
262658	262666	262668	262668	Kate	356	" Yes , I am very wet , "
262670	262687	262668	262668	Kate	356	" I must go up - stairs . Perhaps you 'll come with me , aunt ? "
262688	262696	262697	262698	Aunt Greenow	380	" Come with you,—of course I will . "
262708	262713	262715	262716	John Vavasor	338	" Where 's George ? "
262718	262734	262715	262716	John Vavasor	338	" Has he come back with you , or are we to wait for him ? "
262742	262752	262753	262753	she	356	" I do n't quite know where he is , "
262781	262785	262787	262787	Kate	356	" My arm , "
262792	262796	262787	262787	Kate	356	" my arm ! "
262809	262817	262819	262820	Mrs. Greenow	405	" He has done her a mischief , "
262828	262834	262819	262820	Mrs. Greenow	405	" This is his doing . "
262952	262959	262961	262962	the doctor	6115	" She will do very well , "
262964	262983	262961	262962	the doctor	6115	" It 's only a simple fracture . I 'll see her the day after to - morrow . "
262984	263001	263003	263004	Mr. Vavasor	338	" Is it not odd that such an accident should come from a fall whilst walking ? "
263012	263022	263024	263024	he	6115	" One never can say how anything may occur , "
263026	263049	263024	263024	he	6115	" I know a young woman who broke the os femoris by just kicking her cat;—at least , she said she did . "
263050	263064	263128	263129	the doctor	6115	" Indeed ! I suppose you did n't take any trouble to inquire ? "
263065	263126	263128	263129	the doctor	6115	" Not much . My business was with the injury , not with the way she got it . Somebody did make inquiry , but she stuck to her story and nothing came of it . Good night , Mr. Vavasor . Do n't trouble her with questions till she has had some hours ' sleep , at any rate . "
263559	263566	263568	263568	Kate	356	" I can only tell you , "
263570	263641	263568	263568	Kate	356	" that he went away across the Fell in the direction of Bampton . Perhaps he has gone on to Penrith . He was very angry with us all ; and as the house is not his own , he has probably resolved that he will not stay another night under the roof . But , who can say ? He is not in his senses when he is angered . "
263665	263670	263671	263671	he	338	" I am sure , "
263676	263739	263671	263671	he	338	" that the doctor suspects that there has been violence . I know it from his tone , and I can see it in his eye . But how to prove it ? and would there be good in proving it ? Poor girl ! Will it not be better for her to let it pass as though we believed her story ? "
263943	263960	263961	263962	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Send me my clothes by the bearer . I shall not return to the house . "
264115	264118	264119	264119	she	405	" Kate , "
264128	264154	264119	264119	she	405	" I expect that you will tell me the whole truth as to what occurred between you and your brother when you had this accident . "
264155	264163	264119	264119	she	405	" I have told you the truth . "
264164	264171	264119	264119	she	405	" But not the whole truth . "
264172	264231	264119	264119	she	405	" All the truth I mean to tell , aunt . He has quarrelled with me , as I think , most unnecessarily , but you do n't suppose that I am going to give an exact account of the quarrel ? We were both wrong , probably , and so let there be an end of it . "
264232	264244	264119	264119	she	405	" Was he violent to you when he quarrelled with you ? "
264245	264258	264119	264119	she	405	" When he is angry he is always violent in his language . "
264259	264267	264119	264119	she	405	" But , did he strike you ? "
264268	264309	264119	264119	she	405	" Dear aunt , do n't be angry with me if I say that I wo n't be cross - examined . I would rather answer no more questions about it . I know that questioning can do no good . "
264396	264405	264407	264408	Mrs. Greenow	405	" You must have it your own way , "
264410	264431	264407	264408	Mrs. Greenow	405	" but let me just tell you this , that your brother George had better keep out of my way . "
264432	264440	264442	264442	Kate	356	" It is probable that he will , "
264444	264454	264442	264442	Kate	356	" Especially if you remain here to nurse me . "
265058	265066	265068	265068	Kate	356	" But he does not believe it , "
265072	265093	265068	265068	Kate	356	" He said that because he thought it would vex me ; but I know he does not think it . "
265493	265515	265517	265518	aunt Greenow	380	" A young woman , with six hundred a year , my dear , may do pretty nearly what she pleases , "
265520	265533	265517	265518	aunt Greenow	380	" It 's better than having ten years ' grace given you . "
265534	265542	265544	265544	Kate	356	" And will last longer , certainly , "
265619	265637	265639	265640	Mrs. Greenow	405	" What on earth shall we do if that wild beast shows himself suddenly among us women ? "
265651	265663	265645	265646	The brother	6670	" that he hoped the wild beast would keep his distance . "
265981	265988	265992	265992	himself	6671	" I dare not wait upon I would"—as
266321	266324	266326	266327	the boy	2489	" Baampton , "
266396	266412	266378	266378	he	6671	" John Applethwaite , up at the Craigs yon , had got a mickle cart . "
267740	267750	267751	267751	he	485	" I will breakfast with you to - morrow , "
267765	267788	267751	267751	he	485	" I have work still to do to - night , and I will not disturb you by coming to your room . "
267789	267800	267802	267803	his wife	830	" You wo n't want me to be very early ? "
267805	267808	267810	267810	he	485	" No , "
267825	267851	267810	267810	he	485	" What hour will suit you ? I must say something of what has occurred to - night before I leave you to - morrow . "
267852	267885	267890	267890	he	485	" I do n't know what you can have got to say about to - night , but I 'll be down by half - past eleven , if that will do ? "
268449	268466	268467	268467	she	488	" He looks at me every time he sees me as the cause of his misfortune , "
268952	268960	268961	268961	he	485	" Have you any headache this morning ? "
268964	268969	268970	268970	she	488	" Oh , no , "
269507	269510	269511	269511	she	830	" Plantagenet , "
269514	269540	269511	269511	she	830	" you told me last night , as I was going to bed , that you had something to say about Lady Monk 's party . "
269553	269571	269541	269541	He	485	" Yes , my dear . After what happened , I believe that I must say something . "
269572	269582	269584	269584	Glencora	488	" If you think anything , pray say it , "
269586	269605	269606	269606	he	485	" It is not always easy for a man to show what he thinks by what he says , "
269609	269644	269606	269606	he	485	" My fear is that you should suppose me to think more than I do . And it was for that reason that I determined to sleep on it before I spoke to you . "
269645	269674	269541	269541	He	485	" If anybody is angry with me I 'd much rather they should have it out with me while their anger is hot . I hate cold anger . "
269675	269682	269541	269541	He	485	" But I am not angry . "
269683	269697	269606	269606	he	485	" That 's what husbands always say when they 're going to scold . "
269698	269715	269541	269541	He	485	" But I am not going to scold . I am only going to advise you . "
269716	269735	269541	269541	He	485	" I 'd sooner be scolded . Advice is to anger just what cold anger is to hot . "
269736	269752	269606	269606	he	485	" But , my dear Glencora , surely if I find it necessary to speak — "
269753	269780	269781	269781	He	6833	" I do n't want to stop you , Plantagenet . Pray , go on . Only it will be so nice to have it over . "
269861	269864	269865	269865	he	485	" Glencora , "
269868	269878	269865	269865	he	485	" I wish you to be serious with me . "
269879	269885	269886	269886	she	6836	" I am very serious , "
269944	269966	270035	270035	herself	6836	" You ought to be serious . Do you know why Mrs. Marsham came here from Lady Monk 's last night ? "
269967	270009	270035	270035	herself	6836	" Of course I do . She came to tell you that I was waltzing with Burgo Fitzgerald . You might as well ask me whether I knew why Mr. Bott was standing at all the doors , glaring at me . "
270010	270020	270035	270035	herself	6836	" I do n't know anything about Mr. Bott . "
270021	270029	270030	270030	she	6836	" I know something about him though , "
270040	270049	270030	270030	she	6836	" I am speaking now of Mrs. Marsham . "
270050	270064	270035	270035	herself	6836	" You should speak of them both together as they hunt in couples . "
270065	270094	270116	270116	she	6836	" Glencora , will you listen to me , or will you not ? If you say that you will not , I shall know what to do . "
270095	270105	270035	270035	herself	6836	" I do n't think you would , Plantagenet . "
270119	270156	270107	270107	she	6836	" I 'm sure I do n't know what you would do . But I will listen to you . Only , as I said before , it will be very nice when it 's over . "
270157	270190	270116	270116	she	6836	" Mrs. Marsham came here , not simply to tell me that you were waltzing with Mr. Fitzgerald,—and I wish that when you mention his name you would call him Mr. Fitzgerald . "
270191	270196	270116	270116	she	6836	" So I do . "
270197	270216	270107	270107	she	6836	" You generally prefix his Christian name , which it would be much better that you should omit . "
270217	270222	270223	270223	she	6841	" I will try , "
270229	270255	270223	270223	she	6841	" but it 's hard to drop an old habit . Before you married me you knew that I had learned to call him Burgo . "
270256	270262	270264	270265	Mr. Palliser	485	" Let me go on , "
270267	270272	270264	270265	Mr. Palliser	485	" Oh , certainly . "
270273	270291	270107	270107	she	6836	" It was not simply to tell me that you were waltzing that Mrs. Marsham came here . "
270292	270327	270223	270223	she	6841	" And it was not simply to see me waltzing that Mr. Bott stood in the doorways , for he followed me about , and came down after me to the supper - room . "
270328	270342	270223	270223	she	6841	" Glencora , will you oblige me by not speaking of Mr. Bott ? "
270343	270357	270107	270107	she	6836	" I wish you would oblige me by not speaking of Mrs. Marsham . "
270384	270392	270393	270393	she	6842	" I beg your pardon , Plantagenet , "
270396	270417	270393	270393	she	6842	" I think I know what you want , and I 'll hold my tongue till you bid me speak . "
270418	270438	270107	270107	she	6836	" Mrs. Marsham came here because she saw that every one in the room was regarding you with wonder . "
270453	270477	270449	270449	she	488	" She saw that you were not only dancing with Mr. Fitzgerald , but that you were dancing with him,—what shall I say ? "
270478	270488	270107	270107	she	6836	" Upon my word I ca n't tell you . "
270489	270492	270107	270107	she	6836	" Recklessly . "
270493	270507	270449	270449	she	488	" Oh ! recklessly , was I ? What was I reckless of ? "
270508	270531	270107	270107	she	6836	" Reckless of what people might say ; reckless of what I might feel about it ; reckless of your own position . "
270532	270539	270107	270107	she	6836	" Am I to speak now ? "
270540	270560	270449	270449	she	488	" Perhaps you had better let me go on . I think she was right to come to me . "
270561	270594	270107	270107	she	6836	" That 's of course . What 's the good of having spies , if they do n't run and tell as soon as they see anything , especially anything — reckless . "
270595	270643	270107	270107	she	6836	" Glencora , you are determined to make me angry . I am angry now,—very angry . I have employed no spies . When rumours have reached me , not from spies , as you choose to call them , but through your dearest friends and mine — "
270644	270656	270449	270449	she	488	" What do you mean by rumours from my dearest friends ? "
270657	270666	270107	270107	she	6836	" Never mind . Let me go on . "
270667	270701	270107	270107	she	6836	" No ; not when you say my dear friends have spread rumours about me . Tell me who they are . I have no dear friends . Do you mean Alice Vavasor ? "
270702	270835	270449	270449	she	488	" It does not signify . But when I was warned that you had better not go to any house in which you could meet that man , I would not listen to it . I said that you were my wife , and that as such I could trust you anywhere , everywhere , with any person . Others might distrust you , but I would not do so . When I wished you to go to Monkshade , were there to be any spies there ? When I left you last night at Lady Monk 's , do you believe in your heart that I trusted to Mrs. Marsham 's eyes rather than to your own truth ? Do you think that I have lived in fear of Mr. Fitzgerald ? "
270836	270847	270107	270107	she	6836	" No , Plantagenet ; I do not think so . "
270848	270868	270869	270869	She	6843	" Do you believe that I have commissioned Mr. Bott to watch your conduct ? Answer me , Glencora . "
270885	270893	270894	270894	she	6843	" He does watch me , certainly , "
270897	270917	270894	270894	she	6843	" That does not answer my question . Do you believe that I have commissioned him to do so ? "
270918	270925	270976	270976	his	6844	" No ; I do not . "
270926	270969	270976	270976	his	6844	" Then it is ignoble in you to talk to me of spies . I have employed no spies . If it were ever to come to that , that I thought spies necessary , it would be all over with me . "
271109	271120	271121	271121	she	6843	" I know that I have never made you happy , "
271124	271135	271121	271121	she	6843	" I know that I never can make you happy . "
271158	271167	271168	271168	he	1073	" I do not understand what you mean , "
271171	271184	271168	271168	he	1073	" I have never complained . You have not made me unhappy . "
271284	271365	271264	271264	she	6843	" No , Plantagenet ; I shall never make you happy . You have never loved me , nor I you . We have never loved each other for a single moment . I have been wrong to talk to you about spies ; I was wrong to go to Lady Monk 's ; I have been wrong in everything that I have done ; but never so wrong as when I let them persuade me to be your wife ! "
271366	271369	271264	271264	she	6843	" Glencora ! "
271370	271494	271264	271264	she	6843	" Let me speak now , Plantagenet , It is better that I should tell you everything ; and I will . I will tell you everything;—everything ! I do love Burgo Fitzgerald . I do ! I do ! I do ! How can I help loving him ? Have I not loved him from the first,—before I had seen you ? Did you not know that it was so ? I do love Burgo Fitzgerald , and when I went to Lady Monk 's last night , I had almost made up my mind that I must tell him so , and that I must go away with him and hide myself . But when he came to speak to me — "
271495	271507	271509	271510	the husband	3493	" He has asked you to go with him , then ? "
271570	271593	271552	271552	she	488	" What need is there of asking , do you think , when people have loved each other as we have done ? "
271594	271604	271662	271662	she	6857	" You wanted to go with him , then ? "
271605	271656	271662	271662	she	6857	" Would it not have been the best for you ? Plantagenet , I do not love you;—not as women love their husbands when they do love them . But , before God , my first wish is to free you from the misfortune that I have brought on you . "
271707	271764	271765	271765	He	6858	" What matters it whether I drown myself , or throw myself away by going with such a one as him , so that you might marry again , and have a child ? I 'd die;—I'd die willingly . How I wish I could die ! Plantagenet , I would kill myself if I dared . "
271802	271806	271807	271807	she	6857	" I would , "
271810	271830	271807	271807	she	6857	" I would — I would ! What is there left for me that I should wish to live ? "
271857	271865	271866	271866	he	6858	" You are wrong in one thing , "
271869	271875	271866	271866	he	6858	" I do love you . "
271892	271898	271899	271899	he	6858	" I do love you , "
271902	271931	271899	271899	he	6858	" If you mean that I am not apt at telling you so , it is true , I know . My mind is running on other things . "
271932	271935	271936	271936	she	6857	" Yes , "
271939	271948	271936	271936	she	6857	" your mind is running on other things . "
271949	271996	272000	272000	he	6858	" But I do love you . If you can not love me , it is a great misfortune to us both . But we need not therefore be disgraced . As for that other thing of which you spoke,—of our having , as yet , no child"—and
272007	272038	272000	272000	he	6858	arm—"you allow yourself to think too much of it;—much more of it than I do . I have made no complaints on that head , even within my own breast . "
272039	272049	272006	272006	his	6858	" I know what your thoughts are , Plantagenet . "
272050	272095	272006	272006	his	6858	" Believe me that you wrong my thoughts . Of course I have been anxious , and have , perhaps , shown my anxiety by the struggle I have made to hide it . I have never told you what is false , Glencora . "
272096	272104	272000	272000	he	6858	" No ; you are not false ! "
272105	272141	272142	272142	She	6860	" I would rather have you for my wife , childless,—if you will try to love me,—than any other woman , though another might give me an heir . Will you try to love me ? "
272188	272194	272195	272195	he	6861	" I think , dear , "
272205	272257	272195	272195	he	6861	" that we had better leave England for a while . I will give up politics for this season . Should you like to go to Switzerland for the summer , or perhaps to some of the German baths , and then on to Italy when the weather is cold enough ? "
272263	272276	272259	272259	she	6860	" Perhaps your friend , Miss Vavasor , would go with us ? "
272336	272340	272346	272346	his	485	" Come in , "
272395	272410	272365	272393	the butler who had knocked,—showing that the knock was of more importance than it would have been had it been struck by the knuckles of the footman in livery	6863	" If you please , sir , the Duke of St. Bungay is here . "
272411	272418	272420	272421	Mr. Palliser	485	" The Duke of St. Bungay ! "
272432	272468	272420	272421	Mr. Palliser	485	" Yes , sir , his grace is in the library . He bade me tell you that he particularly wanted to see you ; so I told him that you were with my lady . "
272469	272486	272488	272489	the butler	6865	" Quite right ; tell his grace that I will be with him in two minutes . "
272502	272511	272512	272512	he	485	" I must go now , my dear , "
272515	272528	272512	272512	he	485	" and perhaps I shall not see you again till the evening . "
272529	272541	272542	272542	she	830	" Do n't let me put you out in any way , "
272545	272565	272542	272542	she	830	" Oh no;—you wo n't put me out . You will be dressing , I suppose , about nine . "
272566	272575	272576	272576	she	830	" I did not mean as to that , "
272579	272602	272542	272542	she	830	" You must not think more of Italy . He has come to tell you that you are wanted in the Cabinet . "
272609	272615	272616	272616	he	485	" It may be so , "
272619	272644	272646	272646	he	485	" but though I am wanted , I need not go . But I must not keep the duke waiting . Good - bye . "
272751	272759	272761	272762	Lady Glencora	488	" He says that he loves me , "
272766	272776	272761	272762	Lady Glencora	488	" but he does not know what love means . "
273567	273570	273571	273571	he	1073	" Duke , "
273574	273584	273571	273571	he	1073	" I 'm afraid I have kept you waiting . "
273639	273650	273652	273653	the Duke	2896	" And I suppose you guess why I 'm come ? "
273655	273666	273668	273669	Mr. Palliser	485	" I would rather be told than have to guess , "
273693	273986	273987	273988	The Duke	2896	" He has resigned at last . What was said in the Lords last night made it necessary that he should do so , or that Lord Brock should declare himself able to support him through thick and thin . Of course , I can tell you everything now . He must have gone , or I must have done so . You know that I do n't like him in the Cabinet . I admire his character and his genius , but I think him the most dangerous man in England as a statesman . He has high principles,—the very highest ; but they are so high as to be out of sight to ordinary eyes . They are too exalted to be of any use for everyday purposes . He is honest as the sun , I 'm sure ; but it 's just like the sun 's honesty,—of a kind which we men below ca n't quite understand or appreciate . He has no instinct in politics , but reaches his conclusions by philosophical deduction . Now , in politics , I would a deal sooner trust to instinct than to calculation . I think he may probably know how England ought to be governed three centuries hence better than any man living , but of the proper way to govern it now , I think he knows less . Brock half likes him and half fears him . He likes the support of his eloquence , and he likes the power of the man ; but he fears his restless activity , and thoroughly dislikes his philosophy . At any rate , he has left us , and I am here to ask you to take his place . "
274159	274167	274169	274170	Mr. Palliser	485	" And who goes out with him ? "
274219	274226	274227	274227	he	2896	" But it does not matter , "
274230	274243	274227	274227	he	2896	" I am afraid I must decline the offer you bring me . "
274244	274248	274250	274251	the Duke	2896	" Decline it ! "
274268	274274	274250	274251	the Duke	2896	" I fear I must . "
274370	274375	274376	274376	he	2896	" Nonsense , Palliser , "
274379	274417	274376	274376	he	2896	" You must have got some false notion into your head . There can be no possible reason why you should not join us . Finespun himself will support us , at any rate for a time . "
274437	274445	274447	274448	Mr. Palliser	485	" It is nothing of that kind , "
274472	274489	274465	274466	Mr. Finespun	702	" It is nothing of that kind;—it is no fear of that sort that hinders me . "
274490	274548	274583	274584	Mr. Palliser	485	" Then , for mercy 's sake , what is it ? My dear Palliser , I looked upon you as being as sure in this matter as myself ; and I had a right to do so . You certainly intended to join us a month ago , if the opportunity offered . You certainly did . "
274549	274581	274583	274584	Mr. Palliser	485	" It is true , Duke . I must ask you to listen to me now , and I must tell you what I would not willingly tell to any man . "
274657	274662	274664	274665	the Duke	2896	" Upon my word , "
274667	274688	274664	274665	the Duke	2896	" I ca n't understand that there should be any reason strong enough to make you throw your party over . "
274689	274699	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" I have promised to take my wife abroad . "
274700	274705	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" Is that it ? "
274730	274758	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" Nobody thinks of going abroad at this time of the year . Of course , you can get away for a time when Parliament breaks up . "
274759	274769	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" But I have promised to go at once . "
274770	274801	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" Then , considering your position , you have made a promise which it behoves you to break . I am sure Lady Glencora will see it in that light . "
274802	274839	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" You do not quite understand me , and I am afraid I must trouble you to listen to matters which , under other circumstances , it would be impertinent in me to obtrude upon you . "
274868	274884	274864	274864	he	485	" Of course , Palliser , I do n't want to interfere for a moment . "
274885	274937	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" If you will allow me , Duke . My wife has told me that , this morning , which makes me feel that absence from England is requisite for her present comfort . I was with her when you came , and had just promised her that she should go . "
274938	274996	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" But , Palliser , think of it . If this were a small matter , I would not press you ; but a man in your position has public duties . He owes his services to his country . He has no right to go back , if it be possible that he should so do . "
274997	275019	274864	274864	he	485	" When a man has given his word , it can not be right that he should go back from that . "
275020	275038	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" Of course not . But a man may be absolved from a promise . Lady Glencora — "
275039	275100	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" My wife would , of course , absolve me . It is not that . Her happiness demands it , and it is partly my fault that it is so . I can not explain to you more fully why it is that I must give up the great object for which I have striven with all my strength . "
275101	275106	275108	275109	the Duke	2896	" Oh , no ! "
275111	275121	275108	275109	the Duke	2896	" If you are sure that it is imperative — "
275122	275127	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" It is imperative . "
275128	275141	275108	275109	the Duke	2896	" I could give you twenty - four hours , you know . "
275162	275178	275155	275155	he	485	" I suppose it would not be possible that I should speak to Lady Glencora ? "
275179	275223	274707	274708	the Duke	2896	" It could be of no avail , Duke . She would only declare , at the first word , that she would remain in London ; but it would not be the less my duty on that account to take her abroad . "
275224	275351	275155	275155	he	485	" Well ; I ca n't say . Of course , I ca n't say . Such an opportunity may not come twice in a man 's life . And at your age too ! You are throwing away from you the finest political position that the world can offer to the ambition of any man . No one at your time of life has had such a chance within my memory . That a man under thirty should be thought fit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer , and should refuse it,—because he wants to take his wife abroad ! Palliser , if she were dying , you should remain under such an emergency as this . She might go , but you should remain . "
275378	275386	275387	275387	he	485	" There are things worse than death , "
275444	275451	275453	275454	the Duke	2896	" And must this be final ? "
275456	275556	275453	275454	the Duke	2896	" I think it must . But your visit here has come so quickly on my resolution to go abroad,—which , in truth , was only made ten minutes before your name was brought to me,—that I believe I ought to ask for a portion of those twenty - four hours which you have offered me . A small portion will be enough . Will you see me , if I come to you this evening , say at eight ? If the House is up in the Lords I will go to you in St. James 's Square . "
275557	275568	275411	275411	he	485	" We shall be sitting after eight , I think . "
275569	275611	275411	275411	he	485	" Then I will see you there . And , Duke , I must ask you to think of me in this matter as a friend should think , and not as though we were bound together only by party feeling . "
275612	275617	275453	275454	the Duke	2896	" I will,—I will . "
275618	275633	275411	275411	he	485	" I have told you what I shall never whisper to any one else . "
275634	275646	275411	275411	he	485	" I think you know that you are safe with me . "
275647	275745	275411	275411	he	485	" I am sure of it . And , Duke , I can tell you that the sacrifice to me will be almost more than I can bear . This thing that you have offered me to - day is the only thing that I have ever coveted . I have thought of it and worked for it , have hoped and despaired , have for moments been vain enough to think that it was within my strength , and have been wretched for weeks together because I have told myself that it was utterly beyond me . "
275746	275774	275453	275454	the Duke	2896	" As to that , neither Brock nor I , nor any of us , have any doubt . Finespun himself says that you are the man . "
275775	275811	275411	275411	he	485	" I am much obliged to them . But I say all this simply that you may understand how imperative is the duty which , as I think , requires me to refuse the offer . "
275812	275821	275823	275824	the Duke	2896	" But you have n't refused as yet , "
275826	275901	275823	275824	the Duke	2896	" I shall wait at the House for you , whether they are sitting or not . And endeavour to join us . Do the best you can . I will say nothing as to that duty of which you speak ; but if it can be made compatible with your public service , pray — pray let it be done . Remember how much such a one as you owes to his country . "
275945	275959	275935	275935	she	830	" I do love Burgo Fitzgerald;—I do ! I do ! I do ! "
276426	276434	276435	276435	he	2896	" It has been my own fault , "
276445	276461	276435	276435	he	2896	" and with God 's help I will mend it , if it be possible . "
276646	276653	276654	276654	he	2896	" We will go through Switzerland , "
276659	276705	276654	276654	he	2896	" to Baden , and then we will get on to Florence and to Rome . She has seen nothing of all these things yet , and the new life will make a change in her . She shall have her own friend with her . "
276721	276726	276728	276729	the Duke	2896	" Well , Palliser , "
276738	276775	276728	276729	the Duke	2896	" of course I can not argue it with you any more . I can only say that I am very sorry;—more sorry than perhaps you will believe . Indeed , it half breaks my heart . "
276859	276867	276872	276872	himself	2896	" I never above half liked her , "
276886	276895	276896	276896	he	2896	" I must go to Brock at once , "
276900	276938	276896	276896	he	2896	" and tell him . God knows what we must do now . Goodbye ! good - bye ! No ; I 'm not angry . There shall be no quarrel . But I am very sorry . "
277105	277119	277121	277121	he	485	" We may as well make up our minds to start at once , "
277123	277138	277121	277121	he	485	" At any rate , there is nothing on my side to hinder us . "
277218	277222	277209	277210	Mr. Scruby	435	" Handsome Man , "
277271	277303	277305	277305	he	435	" I 'm a family man , Mr. Vavasor , and therefore I never run any risks . I never go a yard further than I can see my way back . "
277337	277346	277348	277348	George	357	" It is so very hard to realize , "
277350	277365	277348	277348	George	357	" immediately upon a death , when all the property left is real property . "
277366	277371	277373	277374	Mr. Scruby	435	" Very hard indeed , "
277573	277575	277554	277554	she	337	" gentleman "
277608	277622	277598	277598	they	2293	" A gentleman wanting to see me ! What sort of a gentleman ? "
277623	277647	277648	277649	Alice Vavasor	337	" Well , miss , I do n't think he 's just of our sort ; but he 's decent to look at . "
277689	277695	277696	277696	she	337	" Let him come up , "
277699	277714	277696	277696	she	337	" But I think , Jane , you ought to ask him his name . "
277882	277888	277889	277889	Alice	337	" Is papa dressed yet ? "
277894	277909	277889	277889	Alice	337	" Well , miss , I do n't think he is,—not to say dressed . "
277934	277947	277949	277950	Mr. Levy	706	" I 've called about a little bit of business , miss , "
277957	277976	277949	277950	Mr. Levy	706	" Nothing as you need disturb yourself about . You 'll find it all square , I think . "
278019	278026	278028	278029	Mr. Levy	706	" Yes , Mr. George Vavasor , "
278031	278043	278028	278029	Mr. Levy	706	" I dare say you never saw me before , miss ? "
278044	278053	278055	278055	Alice	337	" No , sir ; I think not , "
278057	278065	278055	278055	Alice	337	" I am your cousin 's clerk . "
278066	278088	278028	278029	Mr. Levy	706	" Oh , you 're Mr. Vavasor 's clerk . I 'll read his letter , if you please , sir . "
278089	278096	278055	278055	Alice	337	" If you please , miss . "
278326	278329	278319	278319	Your	337	" accepted , "
278832	278851	278852	278852	he	706	" Mr. Vavasor has explained , I believe , miss , what it is you have to do ? "
278855	278865	278852	278852	he	706	" Yes , sir ; my cousin has explained . "
278866	278902	278903	278904	Mr. Levy	706	" And there is nothing else to trouble you with , I believe . If you will just write your name across them , here , I need not detain you by staying any longer . "
279001	279009	279011	279012	Mr. Levy	706	" It 's all right , miss , "
279014	279025	279027	279027	Alice	337	" Could you not leave them with me , sir ? "
279029	279098	279011	279012	Mr. Levy	706	" Well ; not very well , miss . No doubt Mr. Vavasor has explained it all ; but the fact is , he must have them this afternoon . He has got a heavy sum to put down on the nail about this here election , and if it ai n't down to - day , them on whom he has to depend will be all abroad . "
279099	279124	279162	279162	she	337	" But , sir , the money will not be payable to - day . If I understand it , they are not cheques . "
279125	279156	279157	279157	She	337	" No , miss , no ; they are not cheques . But your name , miss , at fourteen days , is the same as ready money;—just the same . "
279295	279311	279313	279313	he	706	" You insisted on ready money , with your d – – – – suspicions , "
279315	279333	279313	279313	he	706	" and there it is . You 're not afraid of fourteen days , I dare say . "
279334	279343	279345	279346	Mr. Scruby	435	" Fourteen days is neither here nor there , "
279348	279390	279392	279392	he	706	" We can let our payments stand over as long as that , without doing any harm . I 'll send one of my men down to Grimes , and tell him I ca n't see him , till,—let me see , "
279400	279405	279392	279392	he	706	" till the 15th . "
279457	279465	279470	279470	he	435	" We can wait till the 15th , "
279481	279491	279493	279493	George	357	" You will want a thousand , you say ? "
279495	279506	279493	279493	George	357	" A thousand to begin with . Certainly not less . "
279507	279517	279470	279470	he	435	" Then you had better keep two of them . "
279518	279554	279470	279470	he	435	" Well — no ! I do n't see the use of that . You had better collect them through your own banker , and let me have a cheque on the 15th or 16th . "
279555	279564	279493	279493	George	357	" How cursed suspicious you are , Scruby . "
279565	279591	279470	279470	he	435	" No , I ai n't . I 'm not a bit suspicious . I do n't deal in such articles ; that 's all ! "
279592	279620	279470	279470	he	435	" What doubt can there be about such bills as those ? Everybody knows that my cousin has a considerable fortune , altogether at her own disposal . "
279621	279651	279493	279493	George	357	" The truth is , Mr. Vavasor , that bills with ladies ' names on them,—ladies who are no way connected with business,—ain't just the paper that people like . "
279652	279660	279493	279493	George	357	" Nothing on earth can be surer . "
279661	279701	279470	279470	he	435	" You take them into the City for discount , and see if the bankers do n't tell you the same . They may be done , of course , upon your name . I say nothing about that . "
279702	279732	279493	279493	George	357	" I can explain to you the nature of the family arrangement , but I ca n't do that to a stranger . However , I do n't mind . "
279733	279783	279470	279470	he	435	" Of course not . The time is so short that it does not signify . Have them collected through your own bankers , and then , if it do n't suit you to call , send me a cheque for a thousand pounds when the time is up . "
280345	280356	280358	280359	Mr. Bott	532	" You have heard the news ; have n't you ? "
280368	280380	280358	280359	Mr. Bott	532	" News ; no . I have n't heard any news . "
280381	280404	280358	280359	Mr. Bott	532	" Finespun has resigned , and Palliser is at this moment with the Duke of St. Bungay in the Lords ' library . "
280405	280424	280426	280426	Vavasor	338	" They may both be at the bottom of the Lords ' fishpond , for what I care , "
280428	280436	280438	280438	Bott	532	" That 's nonsense , you know , "
280440	280493	280438	280438	Bott	532	" Still , you know Palliser is Chancellor of the Exchequer at this moment . What a lucky fellow you are to have such a chance come to you directly you get in . As soon as he takes his seat down there , of course we shall go up behind him . "
280494	280506	280508	280508	George	357	" We shall have another election in a month 's time , "
280510	280516	280518	280518	Bott	532	" I 'm safe enough , "
280520	280536	280518	280518	Bott	532	" It never hurts a man at elections to be closely connected with the Government . "
280922	280929	280931	280931	Alice	337	" The money must be forthcoming , "
280966	280976	280978	280978	Alice	337	" The money must be made to be forthcoming , "
280980	280991	280978	280978	Alice	337	" Papa , will you see that it is done ? "
281009	281051	281060	281060	he	805	" Papa , if you will not promise , I must go to Mr. Round about it myself , and must find out a broker to sell out for me . You would not wish that my name should be dishonoured . "
281052	281058	281060	281060	he	805	" You will be ruined , "
281062	281071	281060	281060	he	805	" and for such a rascal as that ! "
281072	281098	280978	280978	Alice	337	" Never mind whether he is a rascal or not , papa . You must acknowledge that he has been treated harshly by his grandfather . "
281099	281140	281060	281060	he	805	" I think that will was the wisest thing my father ever did . Had he left the estate to George , there would n't have been an acre of it left in the family in six months ' time . "
281141	281149	281060	281060	he	805	" But the life interest , papa ! "
281150	281170	280978	280978	Alice	337	" He would have raised all he could upon that , and it would have done him no good . "
281171	281192	281060	281060	he	805	" At any rate , papa , he must have this two thousand pounds . You must promise me that . "
281193	281201	281060	281060	he	805	" And then he will want more . "
281202	281235	280978	280978	Alice	337	" No ; I do not think he will ask for more . At any rate , I do not think that I am bound to give him all that I have . "
281236	281257	281060	281060	he	805	" I should think not . I should like to know how you can be bound to give him anything ? "
281258	281277	281060	281060	he	805	" Because I promised it . I have signed the bills now , and it must be done . "
281285	281309	281278	281280	Still Mr. Vavasor	357	" Papa , if you will not say that you will do it , I must go down to Mr. Round at once . "
281310	281339	280978	280978	Alice	337	" I do n't know that I can do it . I do n't know that Mr. Round can do it . Your money is chiefly on mortgage . "
281352	281368	281370	281371	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Upon my word , I never heard of such a thing in my life , "
281373	281409	281370	281371	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I never did . Four thousand pounds given away to such a man as that , in three months ! Four thousand pounds ! And you say you do not intend to marry him . "
281410	281419	280978	280978	Alice	337	" Certainly not ; all that is over . "
281420	281430	281370	281371	Mr. Vavasor	357	" And does he know that it is over ? "
281431	281437	281370	281371	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I suppose he does . "
281438	281454	280978	280978	Alice	337	" You suppose so ! Things of that sort are so often over with you ! "
281506	281515	281516	281516	she	7080	" I know that I have behaved badly , "
281521	281534	281516	281516	she	7080	" but I am punished , and you might spare me now ! "
281535	281544	281545	281545	he	7081	" I did n't want to punish you , "
281559	281579	281545	281545	he	7081	" I do n't want to punish you . But , I do n't want to see you ruined ! "
281580	281591	281592	281593	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I must go to Mr. Round then , myself . "
281739	281747	281748	281749	the father	825	" I do n't want her money , "
281754	281802	281752	281752	himself	825	" and if she had got none of her own , I would make her as comfortable as I could with my own income . But to see her throw her money away in such a fashion as this is enough to break a man 's heart . "

283853	283867	283868	283868	he	353	" One hardly wants a fire at all , such weather as this , "
283871	283878	283880	283883	the signing - clerk	7190	" Oh ; do n't you ? "
283885	283954	283880	283883	the signing - clerk	7190	" If you had to sit here all day , you 'd see if you did n't want a fire . It 's the coldest building I ever put my foot in . Sometimes in winter I have to sit here the whole day in a great - coat . I only wish I could shut old Sugden up here for a week or two , after Christmas . "
283994	283999	284001	284001	Grey	353	" How is Alice ? "
284026	284035	284036	284036	he	338	" She is well enough , I believe , "
284039	284049	284036	284036	he	338	" Is anything the matter in Queen Anne Street ? "
284050	284077	284022	284023	Mr. Vavasor	338	" You 'll hardly believe it when I tell you ; and , indeed , I hardly know whether I ought to tell you or not . "
284078	284103	284036	284036	he	338	" As you and I have gone so far together , I think that you ought to tell me anything that concerns her nearly . "
284104	284145	284036	284036	he	338	" That 's just it . It 's about her money . Do you know , Grey , I 'm beginning to think that I 've been wrong in allowing you to advance what you have done on her account ? "
284146	284150	284022	284023	Mr. Vavasor	338	" Why wrong ? "
284151	284172	284036	284036	he	338	" Because I foresee there 'll be a difficulty about it . How are we to manage about the repayment ? "
284173	284186	284036	284036	he	338	" If she becomes my wife there will be no management wanted . "
284187	284212	284022	284023	Mr. Vavasor	338	" But how if she never becomes your wife ? I 'm beginning to think she 'll never do anything like any other woman . "
284213	284224	284226	284226	Grey	353	" I 'm not quite sure that you understand her , "
284228	284243	284226	284226	Grey	353	" though of course you ought to do so better than any one else . "
284244	284250	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" Nobody can understand her , "
284256	284282	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" She told me the other day , as you know , that she was going to have nothing more to do with her cousin — "
284283	284295	284297	284297	Grey	353	" Has she — has she become friends with him again ? "
284323	284353	284300	284300	he	353	" No ; I believe not;—that is , certainly not in the way you mean . I think that she is beginning to know that he is a rascal . "
284354	284372	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" It is a great blessing that she has learned the truth before it was too late . "
284373	284440	284452	284452	Grey	353	" But would you believe it;—she has given him her name to bills for two thousand pounds , payable at two weeks ' sight ? He sent to her only this morning a fellow that he called his clerk , and she has been fool enough to accept them . Two thousand pounds ! That comes of leaving money at a young woman 's own disposal . "
284441	284450	284452	284452	Grey	353	" But we expected that , you know , "
284464	284468	284452	284452	Grey	353	" Expected it ? "
284469	284491	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" Of course we did . You yourself did not suppose that what he had before would have been the last . "
284492	284501	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" But after she had quarrelled with him ! "
284502	284536	284452	284452	Grey	353	" That would make no difference with her . She had promised him her money , and as it seems that he will be content with that , let her keep her promise . "
284537	284567	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" And give him everything ! Not if I can help it . I 'll expose him . I will indeed . Such a pitiful rascal as he is ! "
284568	284590	284252	284254	the angry father	7206	" You will do nothing , Mr. Vavasor , that will injure your daughter . I 'm very sure of that . "
284591	284610	284452	284452	Grey	353	" But , by heavens—. Such sheer robbery as that ! Two thousand pounds more in fourteen days ! "
284686	284699	284700	284700	he	338	" Mr. Round , you know , has heard nothing about it , "
284703	284751	284700	284700	he	338	" He does n't dream of any such thing . If she would take my advice , she would leave the bills , and let them be dishonoured . As it is , I think I shall call at Drummonds ' , and explain the whole transaction . "
284752	284759	284761	284761	Grey	353	" You must not do that , "
284763	284797	284761	284761	Grey	353	" I will call at Drummonds ' , instead , and see that the money is all right for the bills . As far as they go , let him have his plunder . "
284798	284843	284700	284700	he	338	" And if she wo n't take you , at last , Grey ? Upon my word , I do n't think she ever will . My belief is she 'll never get married . She 'll never do anything like any other woman . "
284844	284859	284861	284861	Grey	353	" The money wo n't be missed by me if I never get married , "
284867	284883	284861	284861	Grey	353	" If she does marry me , of course I shall make her pay me . "
284884	284895	284897	284897	Vavasor	357	" No , by George ! that wo n't do , "
284899	284921	284897	284897	Vavasor	357	" If she were your daughter you 'd know that she could not take a man 's money in that way . "
284922	284983	284861	284861	Grey	353	" And I know it now , though she is not my daughter . I was only joking . As soon as I am certain,—finally certain,—that she can never become my wife , I will take back my money . You need not be afraid . The nature of the arrangement we have made shall then be explained to her . "
285246	285253	285227	285227	she	830	" Do come;—instantly if you can , "
285258	285290	285227	285227	she	830	" I have so much to tell you , and so much to ask of you . If you ca n't come , when shall I find you , and where ? "
285380	285393	285394	285394	she	337	" Oh , dear , what a change it makes in you , "
285397	285407	285394	285394	she	337	" I never thought of your being in black . "
285408	285434	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" I do n't know what it is you want , but sha n't I do in mourning as well as I would in colours ? "
285435	285483	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" You 'll do in anything , dear . But I have so much to tell you , and I do n't know how to begin . And I 've so much to ask of you , and I 'm so afraid you wo n't do it . "
285484	285492	285394	285394	she	337	" You generally find me very complaisant . "
285493	285535	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" No I do n't , dear . It is very seldom you will do anything for me . But I must tell you everything first . Do take your bonnet off , for I shall be hours in doing it . "
285536	285542	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" Hours in telling me ! "
285543	285577	285394	285394	she	337	" Yes ; and in getting your consent to what I want you to do . But I think I 'll tell you that first . I 'm to be taken abroad immediately . "
285578	285585	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" Who is to take you ? "
285586	285645	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" Ah , you may well ask that . If you could know what questions I have asked myself on that head ! I sometimes say things to myself as though they were the most proper and reasonable things in the world , and then within an hour or two I hate myself for having thought of them . "
285646	285662	285394	285394	she	337	" But why do n't you answer me ? Who is going abroad with you ? "
285663	285675	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" Well ; you are to be one of the party . "
285676	285679	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" I ! "
285680	285711	285394	285394	she	337	" Yes ; you . When I have named so very respectable a chaperon for my youth , of course you will understand that my husband is to take us . "
285712	285727	285394	285394	she	337	" But Mr. Palliser ca n't leave London at this time of the year ? "
285728	285875	285365	285366	Lady Glencora	488	" That 's just it . He is to leave London at this time of the year . Do n't look in that way , for it 's all settled . Whether you go with me or not , I 've got to go . To - day is Tuesday . We are to be off next Tuesday night , if you can make yourself ready . We shall breakfast in Paris on Wednesday morning , and then it will be to us all just as if we were in a new world . Mr. Palliser will walk up and down the new court of the Louvre , and you will be on his left arm , and I shall be on his right,—just like English people,—and it will be the most proper thing that ever was seen in life . Then we shall go on to Basle"—Alice
285888	285999	285394	285394	she	337	river—"and so to Lucerne—. But no ; that was the first plan , and Mr. Palliser altered it . He spent a whole day up here with maps and Bradshaw 's and Murray 's guide - books , and he scolded me so because I did n't care whether we went first to Baden or to some other place . How could I care ? I told him I would go anywhere he chose to take me . Then he told me I was heartless;—and I acknowledged that I was heartless . ' I am heartless , ' I said . ' Tell me something I do n't know . ' "
286000	286011	285394	285394	she	337	" Oh , Cora , why did you say that ? "
286012	286100	285394	285394	she	337	" I did n't choose to contradict my husband . Besides , it 's true . Then he threw the Bradshaw away , and all the maps flew about . So I picked them up again , and said we 'd go to Switzerland first . I knew that would settle it , and of course he decided on stopping at Baden . If he had said Jericho , it would have been the same thing to me . Would n't you like to go to Jericho ? "
286101	286111	285394	285394	she	337	" I should have no special objection to Jericho . "
286112	286122	285394	285394	she	337	" But you are to go to Baden instead . "
286123	286157	285394	285394	she	337	" I 've said nothing about that yet . But you have not told me half your story . Why is Mr. Palliser going abroad in the middle of Parliament in this way ? "
286158	286233	285394	285394	she	337	" Ah ; now I must go back to the beginning . And indeed , Alice , I hardly know how to tell you ; not that I mind you knowing it , only there are some things that wo n't get themselves told . You can hardly guess what it is that he is giving up . You must swear that you wo n't repeat what I 'm going to tell you now ? "
286234	286252	285394	285394	she	337	" I 'm not a person apt to tell secrets , but I sha n't swear anything . "
286253	286295	285394	285394	she	337	" What a woman you are for discretion ! it is you that ought to be Chancellor of the Exchequer ; you are so wise . Only you have n't brought your own pigs to the best market , after all . "
286296	286306	285394	285394	she	337	" Never mind my own pigs now , Cora . "
286307	286344	285394	285394	she	337	" I do mind them , very much . But the secret is this . They have asked Mr. Palliser to be Chancellor of the Exchequer , and he has — refused . Think of that ! "
286345	286349	285394	285394	she	337	" But why ? "
286350	286615	285394	285394	she	337	" Because of me,—of me , and my folly , and wickedness , and abominations . Because he has been fool enough to plague himself with a wife — he who of all men ought to have kept himself free from such troubles . Oh , he has been so good ! It is almost impossible to make any one understand it . If you could know how he has longed for this office;—how he has worked for it day and night , wearing his eyes out with figures when everybody else has been asleep , shutting himself up with such creatures as Mr. Bott when other men have been shooting and hunting and flirting and spending their money . He has been a slave to it for years,—all his life I believe,—in order that he might sit in the Cabinet , and be a minister and a Chancellor of the Exchequer . He has hoped and feared , and has been , I believe , sometimes half - mad with expectation . This has been his excitement,—what racing and gambling are to other men . At last , the place was there , ready for him , and they offered it to him . They begged him to take it , almost on their knees . The Duke of St. Bungay was here all one morning about it ; but Mr. Palliser sent him away , and refused the place . It 's all over now , and the other man , whom they all hate so much , is to remain in . "
286616	286624	285394	285394	she	337	" But why did he refuse it ? "
286625	286658	285394	285394	she	337	" I keep on telling you — because of me . He found that I wanted looking after , and that Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott between them could n't do it . "
286659	286672	285394	285394	she	337	" Oh , Cora ! how can you talk in that way ? "
286673	286765	285394	285394	she	337	" If you knew all , you might well ask how I could . You remember about Lady Monk 's ball , that you would not go to,—as you ought to have done . If you had gone , Mr. Palliser would have been Chancellor of the Exchequer at this minute ; he would , indeed . Only think of that ! But though you did not go , other people did who ought to have remained at home . I went for one,—and you know who was there for another . "
286766	286775	286777	286777	Alice	337	" What difference could that make to you ? "
286781	286893	286777	286777	Alice	337	" It might have made a great deal of difference . And , for the matter of that , so it did . Mr. Palliser was there too , but , of course , he went away immediately . I ca n't tell you all the trouble there had been about Mrs. Marsham,—whether I was to take her with me or not . However , I would n't take her , and did n't take her . The carriage went for her first , and there she was when we got there ; and Mr. Bott was there too . I wonder whether I shall ever make you understand it all . "
286894	286906	285394	285394	she	337	" There are some things I do n't want to understand . "
286907	286937	285394	285394	she	337	" There they both were watching me,—looking at me the whole evening ; and , of course , I resolved that I would not be put down by them . "
286938	286962	286777	286777	Alice	337	" I think , if I had been you , I would not have allowed their presence to make any difference to me . "
286963	287019	285394	285394	she	337	" That is very easily said , my dear , but by no means so easily done . You ca n't make yourself unconscious of eyes that are always looking at you . I dared them , at any rate , to do their worst , for I stood up to dance with Burgo Fitzgerald . "
287020	287025	285394	285394	she	337	" Oh , Cora ! "
287026	287199	286777	286777	Alice	337	" Why should n't I ? At any rate I did ; and I waltzed with him for half an hour . Alice , I never will waltz again;—never . I have done with dancing now . I do n't think , even in my maddest days , I ever kept it up so long as I did then . And I knew that everybody was looking at me . It was not only Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott , but everybody there . I felt myself to be desperate,—mad , like a wild woman . There I was , going round and round and round with the only man for whom I ever cared two straws . It seemed as though everything had been a dream since the old days . Ah ! how well I remember the first time I danced with him,—at his aunt 's house in Cavendish Square . They had only just brought me out in London then , and I thought that he was a god . "
287200	287214	285394	285394	she	337	" Cora ! I can not bear to hear you talk like that . "
287215	287256	285394	285394	she	337	" I know well enough that he is no god now ; some people say that he is a devil , but he was like Apollo to me then . Did you ever see anyone so beautiful as he is ? "
287257	287265	285394	285394	she	337	" I never saw him at all . "
287266	287293	285394	285394	she	337	" I wish you could have seen him ; but you will some day . I do n't know whether you care for men being handsome . "
287315	287328	287330	287331	Lady Glencora	488	" I do ; or , rather , I used to do , "
287333	287364	287330	287331	Lady Glencora	488	" I do n't think I care much about anything now ; but I do n't see why handsome men should not be run after as much as handsome women . "
287365	287386	285394	285394	she	337	" But you would n't have a girl run after any man , would you ; whether handsome or ugly ? "
287387	287469	285394	285394	she	337	" But they do , you know . When I saw him the other night he was just as handsome as ever;—the same look , half wild and half tame , like an animal you can not catch , but which you think would love you so if you could catch him . In a little while it was just like the old time , and I had made up my mind to care nothing for the people looking at me . "
287470	287478	287330	287331	Lady Glencora	488	" And you think that was right ? "
287479	287532	287330	287331	Lady Glencora	488	" No , I do n't . Yes , I do ; that is . It was n't right to care about dancing with him , but it was right to disregard all the people gaping round . What was it to them ? Why should they care who I danced with ? "
287533	287582	285394	285394	she	337	" That is nonsense , dear , and you must know that it is so . If you were to see a woman misbehaving herself in public , would not you look on and make your comments ? Could you help doing so if you were to try ? "
287583	287595	287330	287331	Lady Glencora	488	" You are very severe , Alice . Misbehaving in public ! "
287596	287619	287330	287331	Lady Glencora	488	" Yes , Cora . I am only taking your own story . According to that , you were misbehaving in public . "
287650	287668	287670	287670	Alice	337	" What am I to say to you , or how am I to talk to you ? "
287672	287683	287670	287670	Alice	337	" You would not have me tell you a lie ? "
287684	287699	287701	287702	Lady Glencora	488	" Of all things in the world , I hate a prude the most , "
287704	287761	287701	287702	Lady Glencora	488	" Cora , look here . If you consider it prudery on my part to disapprove of your waltzing with Mr. Fitzgerald in the manner you have described,—or , indeed , in any other manner,—you and I must differ so totally about the meaning of words and the nature of things that we had better part . "
287762	287791	287670	287670	Alice	337	" Alice , you are the unkindest creature that ever lived . You are as cold as stone . I sometimes think that you can have no heart . "
287792	287910	287670	287670	Alice	337	" I do n't mind your saying that . Whether I have a heart or not I will leave you to find out for yourself ; but I wo n't be called a prude by you . You know you were wrong to dance with that man . What has come of it ? What have you told me yourself this morning ? In order to preserve you from misery and destruction , Mr. Palliser has given up all his dearest hopes . He has had to sacrifice himself that he might save you . That , I take it , is about the truth of it,—and yet you tell me that you have done no wrong . "
287911	287917	287701	287702	Lady Glencora	488	" I never said so . "
287939	288000	287919	287919	she	7235	" I never said that I was not wrong . Of course I was wrong . I have been so wrong throughout that I have never been right yet . Let me tell it on to the end , and then you can go away if you like , and tell me that I am too wicked for your friendship . "
288001	288012	287670	287670	Alice	337	" Have I ever said anything like that , Cora ? "
288013	288181	287670	287670	Alice	337	" But you will , I dare say , when I have done . Well ; what do you think my senior duenna did,—the female one , I mean ? She took my own carriage , and posted off after Mr. Palliser as hard as ever she could , leaving the male duenna on the watch . I was dancing as hard as I could , but I knew what was going on all the time as well as though I had heard them talking . Of course Mr. Palliser came after me . I do n't know what else he could do , unless , indeed , he had left me to my fate . He came there , and behaved so well,—so much like a perfect gentleman . Of course I went home , and I was prepared to tell him everything , if he spoke a word to me,—that I intended to leave him , and that cart - ropes should not hold me ! "
288182	288189	287919	287919	she	7235	" To leave him , Cora ! "
288190	288244	287670	287670	Alice	337	" Yes , and go with that other man whose name you wo n't let me mention . I had a letter from him in my pocket asking me to go . He asked me a dozen times that night . I can not think how it was that I did not consent . "
288245	288258	287670	287670	Alice	337	" That you did not consent to your own ruin and disgrace ? "
288259	288434	287919	287919	she	7235	" That I did not consent to go off with him,—anywhere . Of course it would have been my own destruction . I 'm not such a fool as not to know that . Do you suppose I have never thought of it;—what it would be to be a man 's mistress instead of his wife . If I had not I should be a thing to be hated and despised . When once I had done it I should hate and despise myself . I should feel myself to be loathsome , and , as it were , a beast among women . But why did they not let me marry him , instead of driving me to this ? And though I might have destroyed myself , I should have saved the man who is still my husband . Do you know , I told him all that,—told him that if I had gone away with Burgo Fitzgerald he would have another wife , and would have children , and would — ? "
288435	288448	287919	287919	she	7235	" You told your husband that you had thought of leaving him ? "
288449	288484	287670	287670	Alice	337	" Yes ; I told him everything . I told him that I dearly loved that poor fellow , for whom , as I believe , nobody else on earth cares a single straw . "
288485	288492	287919	287919	she	7235	" And what did he say ? "
288493	288603	287919	287919	she	7235	" I can not tell you what he said , only that we are all to go to Baden together , and then to Italy . But he did not seem a bit angry ; he very seldom is angry , unless at some trumpery thing , as when he threw the book away . And when I told him that he might have another wife and a child , he put his arm round me and whispered to me that he did not care so much about it as I had imagined . I felt more like loving him at that moment than I had ever done before . "
288604	288614	287670	287670	Alice	337	" He must be fit to be an angel . "
288615	288733	287919	287919	she	7235	" He 's fit to be a cabinet minister , which , I 'm quite sure , he 'd like much better . And now you know everything ; but no,—there is one thing you do n't know yet . When I tell you that , you 'll want to make him an archangel or a prime minister . ' We 'll go abroad , ' he said,—and remember , this was his own proposition , made long before I was able to speak a word;—'We'll go abroad , and you shall get your cousin Alice to go with us . ' That touched me more than anything . Only think if he had proposed Mrs. Marsham ! "
288734	288743	287919	287919	she	7235	" But yet he does not like me . "
288744	288793	287670	287670	Alice	337	" You 're wrong there , Alice . There has been no question of liking or of disliking . He thought you would be a kind of Mrs. Marsham , and when you were not , but went out flirting among the ruins with Jeffrey Palliser , instead — "
288794	288804	287919	287919	she	7235	" I never went out flirting with Jeffrey Palliser . "
288805	288833	287919	287919	she	7235	" He did with you , which is all the same thing . And when Plantagenet knew of that,—for , of course , Mr. Bott told him — "
288834	288842	287670	287670	Alice	337	" Mr. Bott ca n't see everything . "
288843	288915	287919	287919	she	7235	" Those men do . The worst is , they see more than everything . But , at any rate , Mr. Palliser has got over all that now . Come , Alice ; the fact of the offer having come from himself should disarm you of any such objection as that . As he has held out his hand to you , you have no alternative but to take it . "
288916	288924	287919	287919	she	7235	" I will take his hand willingly . "
288925	289009	287919	287919	she	7235	" And for my sake you will go with us ? He understands himself that I am not fit to be his companion , and to have no companion but him . Now there is a spirit of wisdom about you that will do for him , and a spirit of folly that will suit me . I can manage to put myself on a par with a girl who has played such a wild game with her lovers as you have done . "
289041	289047	289049	289049	Alice	337	" And I must go , "
289124	289130	289132	289133	her father	805	" I have no objection ; "
289157	289186	289187	289187	Alice	337	" I can get along in lodgings . I suppose we had better leave the house , as you have given away so much of your own fortune ? "
289374	289385	289368	289369	her father	805	constantly:—"Things of that sort are so often over with you . "
289614	289617	289588	289588	He	485	" But , "
289625	289647	289648	289648	she	488	" he was always looking after me . I believe he thought that Burgo Fitzgerald had hidden himself among the ruins , "
289654	289677	289648	289648	she	488	" He never suspected me , I am sure of that ; but he thought that he ought to look after me . "
290001	290008	290009	290010	Lady Glencora	488	" I saw him yawning sometimes , "
290014	290023	290009	290010	Lady Glencora	488	" as though he would fall in pieces . "
290314	290321	290322	290322	she	337	" To - day , papa ? "
290325	290348	290322	290322	she	337	" Yes , to - day . Why not ? No man is less particular as to what he eats than Grey . "
290349	290359	290360	290360	she	337	" I was not thinking of that , papa , "
290419	290433	290415	290415	Alice	337	" Perhaps , papa , you and Mr. Grey had better dine alone . "
290434	290442	290415	290415	Alice	337	" What do you mean by alone ? "
290443	290455	290415	290415	Alice	337	" I meant without me,—as two men generally like to do . "
290456	290472	290474	290475	Mr. Vavasor	357	" If I wanted that I should have asked him to dine at the club , "
290485	290490	290479	290479	he	357	" But , papa — "
290491	290542	290415	290415	Alice	337	" Well , my dear ! If you mean to say that because of what has passed you object to meet Mr. Grey , I can only tell you it 's nonsense,—confounded nonsense . If he chooses to come there can be no reason why you should n't receive him . "
290543	290550	290415	290415	Alice	337	" It will look as though — "
290551	290555	290415	290415	Alice	337	" Look what ? "
290556	290566	290415	290415	Alice	337	" As though he were asked as my guest . "
290567	290616	290415	290415	Alice	337	" That 's nonsense . I saw him yesterday , and I asked him to come . I saw him again to - day , and he said he would come . He 's not such a fool as to suppose after that , that you asked him . "
290617	290626	290415	290415	Alice	337	" No ; not that I asked him . "
290627	290662	290415	290415	Alice	337	" And if you run away you 'll only make more of the thing than it 's worth . Of course I ca n't make you dine with me if you do n't like . "
291181	291189	291190	291190	he	353	" I hear you are going abroad , "
291193	291202	291190	291190	he	353	" with your cousin , Lady Glencora Palliser . "
291203	291206	291208	291208	Alice	337	" Yes , "
291210	291236	291208	291208	Alice	337	" I am going with them for a long tour . We shall not return , I fancy , till the end of next winter . "
291237	291251	291253	291254	her father	805	" Plans of that sort are as easily broken as they are made , "
291256	291280	291253	291254	her father	805	" You wo n't be your own mistress ; and I advise you not to count too surely upon getting further than Baden . "
291281	291295	291297	291297	Alice	337	" If Mr. Palliser changes his mind of course I shall come home , "
291307	291319	291321	291321	Grey	353	" I should think him a man not prone to changes , "
291323	291374	291321	291321	Grey	353	" But all London is talking about his change of mind at this moment . They say at the clubs that he might have been in the Cabinet if he would , but that he has taken up this idea of going abroad at the moment when he was wanted . "
291375	291387	291389	291390	Mr. Vavasor	357	" It 's his wife 's doing , I take it , "
291392	291402	291404	291404	Grey	353	" That 's the worst of being in Parliament , "
291406	291449	291404	291404	Grey	353	" A man ca n't do anything without giving a reason for it . There must be men for public life , of course ; but , upon my word , I think we ought to be very much obliged to them . "
291634	291644	291645	291645	Alice	337	" Had he deigned to discuss it with me ! "
291651	291681	291645	291645	Alice	337	" But , no ; he will read his books , and I am to go there to fetch him his slippers , and make his tea for him . "
291775	291787	291752	291752	she	337	" Things of that sort are so often over with you ! "
291809	291814	291752	291752	she	337	" things of that sort "
291842	291848	291849	291849	she	337	" It seems to me , "
291864	291890	291849	291849	she	337	" that your pity is hardly needed . I should think that no persons can be happier than those whom you call our public men . "
291891	291894	291896	291896	he	805	" Ah ! "
291898	291905	291896	291896	he	805	" that is our old quarrel . "
291951	292000	292001	292001	She	7302	" It 's the old story of the town mouse and the country mouse,—as old as the hills . Mice may be civil for a while , and compliment each other ; but when they come to speak their minds freely , each likes his own life best . "
292076	292079	292081	292082	her father	805	" Alice , "
292084	292095	292081	292082	her father	805	" I ca n't compliment your cook upon her soup . "
292096	292124	292081	292082	her father	805	" You do n't encourage her , papa , by eating it often enough . And then you only told me at two o'clock to - day . "
292125	292147	292081	292082	her father	805	" If a cook ca n't make soup between two and seven , she ca n't make it in a week . "
292148	292157	292159	292159	Alice	337	" I hope Mr. Grey will excuse it , "
292161	292167	292169	292169	he	805	" Is n't it good ? "
292171	292203	292169	292169	he	805	" I wo n't say that it is , because I should be pretending to have an opinion ; but I should not have found out anything against it of myself . "
292204	292217	292081	292082	her father	805	" Where do you dine usually , now you are in London ? "
292222	292269	292218	292219	Mr. Vavasor	357	" At the old club , at the corner of Suffolk Street . It 's the oldest club in London , I believe . I never belonged to any other , and therefore ca n't compare them ; but I ca n't imagine anything much nicer . "
292270	292279	292281	292281	Alice	337	" They give you better soup than ours ? "
292283	292290	292292	292293	Mr. Vavasor	357	" You 've an excellent cook , "
292299	292331	292292	292293	Mr. Vavasor	357	" one of the best second - class cooks in London . We were very nearly getting him , but you nicked him just in time . I know him well . "
292332	292387	292218	292219	Mr. Vavasor	357	" It 's a great deal more than I do , or hope to do . There 's another branch of public life for which I 'm quite unfitted . I 'd as soon be called on to choose a Prime Minister for the country , as I would a cook for a club . "
292388	292394	292396	292397	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Of course you would , "
292399	292481	292396	292397	Mr. Vavasor	357	" There may be as many as a dozen cooks about London to be looked up , but there are never more than two possible Prime Ministers about . And as one of them must be going out when the other is coming in , I do n't see that there can be any difficulty . Moreover , now - a - days , people do their politics for themselves , but they expect to have their dinners cooked for them . "
292619	292634	292636	292636	Alice	337	" If he can forget all that has passed , so much the better , "
292730	292737	292739	292739	Grey	353	" She does not look well , "
292749	292812	292739	292739	Grey	353	" Well;—no : how can she look well after what she has gone through ? I sometimes think , that of all the people I ever knew , she has been the most foolish . But , of course , it is not for me to say anything against my own child ; and , of all people , not to you . "
292813	292840	292739	292739	Grey	353	" Nothing that you could say against her would make any difference to me . I sometimes fancy that I know her better than you do . "
292841	292853	292739	292739	Grey	353	" And you think that she 'll still come round again ? "
292854	292929	292739	292739	Grey	353	" I can not say that I think so . No one can venture to say whether or not such wounds as hers may be cured . There are hearts and bodies so organized , that in them severe wounds are incurable , whereas in others no injury seems to be fatal . But I can say that if she be not cured it shall not be from want of perseverance on my part . "
292930	292953	292739	292739	Grey	353	" Upon my word , Grey , I do n't know how to thank you enough . I do n't , indeed . "
292954	292968	292739	292739	Grey	353	" It does n't seem to me to be a case for thanking . "
292969	293058	292739	292739	Grey	353	" Of course it is n't . I know that well enough . And in the ordinary way of the world no father would think of thanking a man for wanting to marry his daughter . But things have come to such a pass with us , that , by George ! I do n't feel like any other father . I do n't mind saying anything to you , you know . That claret is n't very good , but you might as well take another glass . "
293059	293079	292739	292739	Grey	353	" Thank you , I will . I should have said that that was rather good wine , now . "
293080	293171	292739	292739	Grey	353	" It 's not just the thing . What 's the use of my having good wine here , when nobody comes to drink it ? But , as I was saying about Alice , of course I 've felt all this thing very much . I feel as though I were responsible , and yet what could I do ? She 's her own mistress through it all . When she told me she was going to marry that horrible miscreant , my nephew , what could I do ? "
293172	293186	292739	292739	Grey	353	" That 's over now , and we need not talk about it . "
293187	293217	292739	292739	Grey	353	" It 's very kind of you to say so,—very . I believe she 's a good girl . I do , indeed , in spite of it all . "
293218	293269	292739	292739	Grey	353	" I 've no doubt of her being what you call a good girl,—none in the least . What she has done to me does not impair her goodness . I do n't think you have ever understood how much all this has been a matter of conscience with her . "
293270	293273	293275	293277	the angry father	7206	" Conscience ! "
293279	293307	293275	293277	the angry father	7206	" I hate such conscience . I like the conscience that makes a girl keep her word , and not bring disgrace upon those she belongs to . "
293308	293318	293320	293320	Grey	353	" I shall not think that I am disgraced , "
293324	293358	293320	293320	Grey	353	" if she will come and be my wife . She has meant to do right , and has endeavoured to take care of the happiness of other people rather than her own . "
293359	293369	293371	293372	Mr. Vavasor	357	" She has taken very little care of mine , "
293374	293407	293371	293372	Mr. Vavasor	357	" I shall not be at all afraid to trust mine to her,—if she will let me do so . But she has been wounded sorely , and it must take time . "
293408	293443	293320	293320	Grey	353	" And , in the meantime , what are we to do when she tells us that Mr. George Vavasor wants another remittance ? Two thousand pounds a quarter comes heavy , you know ! "
293444	293454	293320	293320	Grey	353	" Let us hope that he has had enough . "
293455	293466	293371	293372	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Enough ! Did such a man ever have enough ? "
293467	293489	293320	293320	Grey	353	" Let us hope , then , that she thinks he has had enough . Come;—may I go up - stairs ? "
293490	293513	293371	293372	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Oh , yes . I 'll follow you . She 'll think that I mean something if I leave you together . "
293634	293643	293648	293648	he	353	" And you really start to - morrow ? "
293722	293747	293699	293699	he	357	" I start for Westmoreland to - morrow . We do not leave London for the continent till the latter end of next week . "
293748	293757	293839	293839	himself	7322	" But you will not be here again ? "
293758	293771	293839	293839	himself	7322	" No ; I shall not come back to Queen Anne Street . "
293772	293782	293699	293699	he	357	" And you will be away for many months ? "
293783	293818	293839	293839	himself	7322	" Mr. Palliser talked of next Easter as the term of his return . He mentioned Easter to Lady Glencora . I have not seen him myself since I agreed to go with him . "
293819	293833	293834	293834	He	7322	" What should you say if you met me somewhere in your travels ? "
293873	293884	293885	293885	she	7323	" I do n't think that will be very likely , "
293894	293950	293885	293885	she	7323	" I think it is very likely . For myself , I hate surprises . I could not bring myself to fall in upon your track unawares . I shall go abroad , but it will not be till the late autumn , when the summer heats are gone,—and I shall endeavour to find you . "
293951	293959	293965	293965	her	7323	" To find me , Mr. Grey ! "
293988	293999	293979	293979	she	7323	" I do not think that will be quite fair . "
294000	294030	293885	293885	she	7323	" It will not be unfair , I think , if I give you notice of my approach . I will not fall upon you and your friends unawares . "
294031	294050	293885	293885	she	7323	" I was not thinking of them . They would be glad to know you , of course . "
294051	294082	293979	293979	she	7323	" And equally , of course ! or , rather , much more of course , you will not be glad to see me ? That 's what you mean ? "
294083	294098	293885	293885	she	7323	" I mean that we had better not meet more than we can help . "
294099	294131	294133	294133	he	7324	" I think differently , Alice,—quite differently . The more we meet the better,—that is what I think . But I will not stop to trouble you now . Good night ! "
294259	294279	294280	294281	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And he was violent to you , and broke your arm ? I always knew it was so , "
294298	294301	294303	294303	she	405	" No , "
294305	294347	294303	294303	she	405	" that was an accident . When he went away and left me , he knew nothing about it . And if he had broken both my arms I should not have cared much . I could have forgiven him that . "
294395	294411	294412	294412	Kate	356	" I would give all I have in the world to bring them together again , "
294415	294428	294430	294431	Mrs. Greenow	405	" They 'll come together fast enough if they like each other , "
294433	294478	294430	294431	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Alice is young still , and they tell me she 's as good looking as ever . A girl with her money wo n't have far to seek for a husband , even if this paragon from Cambridgeshire should not turn up again . "
294479	294488	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" You do n't know Alice , aunt . "
294489	294563	294430	294431	Mrs. Greenow	405	" No , I do n't . But I know what young women are , and I know what young men are . All this nonsense about her cousin George,—what difference will it make ? A man like Mr. Grey wo n't care about that,—especially not if she tells him all about it . My belief is that a girl can have anything forgiven her , if she 'll only tell it herself . "
294582	294589	294590	294590	she	405	" Of course , my dear , "
294594	294699	294590	294590	she	405	" marriage with me , if I should marry again , would be a very different thing to your marriage , or that of any other young person . As for love , that has been all over for me since poor Greenow died . I have known nothing of the softness of affection since I laid him in his cold grave , and never can again . ' Captain Bellfield , ' I said to him , ' if you were to kneel at my feet for years , it would not make me care for you in the way of love . ' "
294700	294709	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And what did he say to that ? "
294710	294761	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" How am I to tell you what he said ? He talked nonsense about my beauty , as all the men do . If a woman were hump - backed , and had only one eye , they would n't be ashamed to tell her she was a Venus . "
294762	294776	294590	294590	she	405	" But , aunt , you are a handsome woman , you know . "
294777	294892	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Laws , my dear , as if I did n't understand all about it ; as if I did n't know what makes a woman run after ? It is n't beauty,—and it is n't money altogether . I 've seen women who had plenty of both , and not a man would come nigh them . They did n't dare . There are some of them , a man would as soon think of putting his arm round a poplar tree , they are so hard and so stiff . You know you 're a little that way yourself , Kate , and I 've always told you it wo n't do . "
294893	294906	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm afraid I 'm too old to mend , aunt . "
294907	295052	294590	294590	she	405	" Not at all , if you 'll only set your wits to work and try . You 've plenty of money now , and you 're good - looking enough , too , when you take the trouble to get yourself up . But , as I said before , it is n't that that 's wanted . There 's a stand - off about some women,—what the men call a ' nollimy tangere , ' that a man must be quite a furious Orlando to attempt to get the better of it . They look as though matrimony itself were improper , and as if they believed that little babies were found about in the hedges and ditches . They talk of women being forward ! There are some of them a deal too backward , according to my way of thinking . "
295053	295062	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Yours is a comfortable doctrine , aunt . "
295063	295153	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" That 's just what I want it to be . I want things to be comfortable . Why should n't things be nice about one when one 's got the means ? Nobody can say it 's a pleasant thing to live alone . I always thought that man in the song hit it off properly . You remember what he says ? ' The poker and tongs to each other belongs . ' So they do , and that should be the way with men and women . "
295154	295169	294590	294590	she	405	" But the poker and tongs have but a bad life of it sometimes . "
295170	295318	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Not so often as the people say , my dear . Men and women ai n't like lumps of sugar . They do n't melt because the water is sometimes warm . Now , if I do take Bellfield,—and I really think I shall ; but if I do he 'll give me a deal of trouble . I know he will . He 'll always be wanting my money , and , of course , he 'll get more than he ought . I 'm not a Solomon , nor yet a Queen of Sheba , no more than anybody else . And he 'll smoke too many cigars , and perhaps drink more brandy - and - water than he ought . And he 'll be making eyes , too , at some of the girls who 'll be fools enough to let him . "
295319	295351	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Dear me , aunt , if I thought all that ill of him , I 'm sure I would n't marry him;—especially as you say you do n't love him . "
295352	295365	294578	294579	Mrs. Greenow	405	" As for love , my dear , that 's gone,—clear gone ! "
295377	295400	295371	295371	her	7338	" Some women can love twice , but I am not one of them . I wish I could,—I wish I could ! "
295429	295517	295518	295518	she	7338	" But my dear , marriage is a comfortable thing . And then , though the Captain may be a little free , I do n't doubt but what I shall get the upper hand with him at last . I sha n't stop his cigars and brandy - and - water you know . Why should n't a man smoke and have a glass , if he do n't make a beast of himself ? I like to see a man enjoy himself . And then , "
295528	295541	295518	295518	she	7338	" I do think he 's fond of me,—I do , indeed . "
295542	295553	295371	295371	her	7338	" So is Mr. Cheesacre for the matter of that . "
295554	295615	295518	295518	she	7338	" Poor Cheesy ! I believe he was , though he did talk so much about money . I always like to believe the best I can of them . But then there was no poetry about Cheesy . I do n't care about saying it now , as you 've quite made up your mind not to have him . "
295616	295621	295371	295371	her	7338	" Quite , aunt . "
295622	295732	295518	295518	she	7338	" Your grandfather 's will does make a difference , you know . But , as I was saying , I do like a little romance about them,—just a sniff , as I call it , of the rocks and valleys . One knows that it does n't mean much ; but it 's like artificial flowers,—it gives a little colour , and takes off the dowdiness . Of course , bread - and - cheese is the real thing . The rocks and valleys are no good at all , if you have n't got that , But enough is as good as a feast . Thanks to dear Greenow,"—here
295737	295809	295371	295371	her	7338	used—"Thanks to dear Greenow , I shall never want . Of course I sha n't let any of the money go into his hands,—the Captain 's , I mean . I know a trick worth two of that , my dear . But , lord love you ! I 've enough for him and me . What 's the good of a woman 's wanting to keep it all to herself ? "
295810	295843	295926	295927	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And you think you 'll really take him , aunt , and pay his washerwoman 's bills for him ? You remember what you told me when I first saw him ? "
295844	295913	295371	295371	her	7338	" Oh , yes ; I remember . And if he ca n't pay his own washerwoman , is n't that so much more of a reason that I should do it for him ? Well ; yes ; I think I will take him . That is , if he lets me take him just as I choose . Beggars must n't be choosers , my dear . "
295949	295964	295965	295966	Mrs. Greenow	405	" There would be no harm in offering him a bed , would there ? "
295969	295985	295965	295966	Mrs. Greenow	405	" You see the inn at Shap is a long way off for morning calls . "
296016	296026	296028	296029	the widow	1443	" After all , perhaps he may n't come , "
296031	296057	296028	296029	the widow	1443	" I do n't see where he is to raise the money for such a journey , now that he has quarrelled with Mr. Cheesacre . "
296058	296083	296028	296029	the widow	1443	" If Captain Bellfield must come to Vavasor Hall , at any rate let him not come till Alice 's visit had been completed . "
296113	296154	296159	296159	she	405	" I do n't in the least know where he is , my dear , and as for writing to him , I never did such a thing in my life , and I should n't know how to begin . "
296327	296334	296335	296335	she	356	" It was here I fell , "
296338	296442	296335	296335	she	356	" and the last I saw of him was his back , as he made his way down into the valley , there . When I got upon my legs I could still see him . It was one of those evenings when the clouds are dark , but you can see all objects with a peculiar clearness through the air . I stood here ever so long , holding my arm , and watching him ; but he never once turned to look back at me . Do you know , Alice , I fancy that I shall never see him again . "
296443	296456	296335	296335	she	356	" Do you suppose that he means to quarrel with you altogether ? "
296457	296571	296335	296335	she	356	" I can hardly tell you what I mean ! He seemed to me to be going away from me , as though he went into another world . His figure against the light was quite clear , and he walked quickly , and on he went , till the slope of the hill hid him from me . Of course , I thought that he would return to the Hall . At one time I almost feared that he would come upon me through the woods , as I went back myself . But yet , I had a feeling,—what people call a presentiment , that I should never see him again . "
296572	296578	296335	296335	she	356	" He has never written ? "
296579	296639	296335	296335	she	356	" No ; not a word . You must remember that he did not know that I had hurt myself . I am sure he will not write , and I am sure , also , that I shall not . If he wanted money I would send it to him , but I would not write to him . "
296640	296651	296335	296335	she	356	" I fear he will always want money , Kate . "
296652	296696	296335	296335	she	356	" I fear he will . If you could know what I suffered when he made me write that letter to you ! But , of course , I was a beast . Of course , I ought not to have written it . "
296697	296706	296335	296335	she	356	" I thought it a very proper letter . "
296707	296791	296335	296335	she	356	" It was a mean letter . The whole thing was mean ! He should have starved in the street before he had taken your money . He should have given up Parliament , and everything else ! I had doubted much about him before , but it was that which first turned my heart against him . I had begun to fear that he was not such a man as I had always thought him,—as I had spoken of him to you . "
296792	296801	296803	296803	Alice	337	" I had judged of him for myself , "
296805	296923	296803	296803	Alice	337	" Of course you did . But I had endeavoured to make you judge kindly . Alice , dear ! we have both suffered for him ; you more than I , perhaps ; but I , too , have given up everything for him . My whole life has been at his service . I have been his creature , to do his bidding , just as he might tell me . He made me do things that I knew to be wrong,—things that were foreign to my own nature ; and yet I almost worshipped him . Even now , if he were to come back , I believe that I should forgive him everything . "
296924	296937	296335	296335	she	356	" I should forgive him , but I could never do more . "
296938	296965	296335	296335	she	356	" But he will never come back . He will never ask us to forgive him , or even wish it . He has no heart . "
296966	296980	296982	296982	Alice	337	" He has longed for money till the Devil has hardened his heart , "
296984	297044	296335	296335	she	356	" And yet how tender he could be in his manner when he chose it;—how soft he could make his words and his looks ! Do you remember how he behaved to us in Switzerland ? Do you remember that balcony at Basle , and the night we sat there , when the boys were swimming down the river ? "
297045	297049	296335	296335	she	356	" Yes;—I remember . "
297050	297080	296335	296335	she	356	" So do I ! So do I ! Alice , I would give all I have in the world , if I could recall that journey to Switzerland . "
297081	297091	296335	296335	she	356	" If you mean for my sake , Kate — "
297092	297148	296335	296335	she	356	" I do mean for your sake . It made no difference to me . Whether I stayed in Westmoreland or went abroad , I must have found out that my god was made of bricks and clay instead of gold . But there was no need for you to be crushed in the ruins . "
297149	297157	296335	296335	she	356	" I am not crushed , Kate ! "
297158	297170	296335	296335	she	356	" Of course , you are too proud to own it ? "
297171	297197	296335	296335	she	356	" If you mean about Mr. Grey , that would have happened just the same , whether I had gone abroad or remained at home . "
297198	297204	296335	296335	she	356	" Would it , dear ? "
297205	297210	296335	296335	she	356	" Just the same . "
297349	297360	297361	297361	she	356	" I do not know what may happen to him , "
297371	297398	297361	297361	she	356	" but when he was passing out of my sight into the valley , I felt that I was looking at him for the last time . "
297399	297409	297410	297410	Alice	337	" That is simply what people call a presentiment , "
297413	297426	297428	297428	Kate	356	" Exactly so ; and presentiments , of course , mean nothing , "
297603	297608	297610	297610	Alice	337	" Who is it ? "
297616	297620	297622	297622	Kate	356	" Captain Bellfield , "
297634	297642	297631	297631	her	356	" What ! aunt Greenow 's Captain ? "
297643	297688	297689	297690	The Captain	1602	" Yes ; aunt Greenow 's Captain . I have been fearing this , and now , what on earth are we to do with him ? Look at him . That 's what aunt Greenow calls a sniff of the rocks and valleys . "
297775	297783	297784	297784	he	1602	" Miss Vavasor , I am delighted , "
297787	297845	297784	297784	he	1602	" Miss Alice Vavasor , if I am not mistaken ? I have been commissioned by my dear friend Mrs. Greenow to go out and seek you , but , upon my word , the woods looked so black that I did not dare to venture;—and then , of course , I should n't have found you . "
298018	298021	298023	298023	he	1602	" Well , "
298025	298060	298061	298061	he	1602	" I am a little surprised myself;—I am , indeed ! But I had nothing to do in Norwich,—literally nothing ; and your aunt had so often talked to me of the beauties of this place,"—and
298073	298119	298063	298063	his	1602	trees,—"that I thought I 'd take the liberty of paying you a flying visit . I did n't mean to intrude in the way of sleeping ; I did n't indeed , Miss Vavasor ; only Mrs. Greenow has been so kind as to say — "
298120	298142	298061	298061	he	1602	" We are so very far out of the world , Captain Bellfield , that we always give our visitors beds . "
298143	298157	298063	298063	his	1602	" I did n't intend it ; I did n't indeed , miss ! "
298169	298202	298158	298160	Poor Captain Bellfield	393	" I did just put my bag , with a change of things , into the gig , which brought me over , not knowing quite where I might go on to . "
298203	298219	298221	298221	Kate	356	" We wo n't send you any further to - day , at any rate , "
298223	298244	298221	298221	Kate	356	" Mrs. Greenow has been very kind,—very kind , indeed . She has asked me to stay till — Saturday ! "
298294	298304	298305	298305	she	356	" We shall be very glad to see you , "
298308	298327	298305	298305	she	356	" We are three women together here , and I 'm afraid you will find us rather dull . "
298328	298341	298272	298273	her aunt	912	" Oh dear , no,—dull with you ! That would be impossible ! "
298342	298354	298305	298305	she	356	" And how have you left your friend , Mr. Cheesacre ? "
298355	298390	298305	298305	she	356	" Quite well;—very well , thank you . That is to say , I have n't seen him much lately . He and I did have a bit of a breeze , you know . "
298391	298404	298272	298273	her aunt	912	" I ca n't say that I did know , Captain Bellfield . "
298405	298448	298449	298449	They	7386	" I thought , perhaps , you had heard . He seemed to think that I was too particular in a certain quarter ! Ha — ha — ha — ha ! That 's only my joke , you know , ladies . "
298534	298548	298550	298550	Kate	356	" I suppose you have seen my aunt since you have been here ? "
298552	298591	298550	298550	Kate	356	" Oh dear , yes . I saw her , and she suggested that I had better walk out and find you . I did find you , you know , though I did n't walk very far . "
298592	298600	298633	298635	The poor fellow	7394	" And have you seen your room ? "
298601	298632	298633	298635	The poor fellow	7394	" Yes;—yes . She was kind enough to show me my room . Very nice indeed , thank you;—looking out into the front , and all that kind of thing . "
298656	298688	298644	298644	his	7394	" I sha n't stay long , Miss Vavasor,—only just a night or so ; but I did want to see your aunt again,—and you , too , upon my word . "
298689	298704	298705	298705	He	7394	" My aunt is the attraction , Captain Bellfield . We all know that . "
298788	298798	298800	298800	Kate	356	" I will go to my aunt at once , "
298802	298812	298800	298800	Kate	356	" and find out what is to be done . "
298813	298822	298876	298876	Kate	356	" I suppose she means to marry him ? "
298823	298875	298876	298876	Kate	356	" Oh , yes ; she means to marry him , and the sooner the better now . I knew this was coming , but I did so hope it would not be while you were here . It makes me feel so ashamed of myself that you should see it . "
298895	298904	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I was waiting for you to come , "
298909	298935	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Here I am , aunt ; and , what is more to the purpose , there is Captain Bellfield in the drawing - room . "
298936	298973	298876	298876	Kate	356	" Stupid man ! I told him to take himself away about the place till dinner - time . I 've half a mind to send him back to Shap at once;—upon my word I have . "
298974	298987	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Do n't do that , aunt ; it would be inhospitable . "
298988	299011	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But he is such an oaf . I hope you understand , my dear , that I could n't help it ? "
299012	299029	298876	298876	Kate	356	" But you do mean to — to marry him , aunt ; do n't you ? "
299030	299075	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Well , Kate , I really think I do . Why should n't I ? It 's a lonely sort of life being by myself ; and , upon my word , I do n't think there 's very much harm in him . "
299076	299101	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I am not saying anything against him ; only in that case you ca n't very well turn him out of the house . "
299102	299132	298876	298876	Kate	356	" Could not I , though ? I could in a minute ; and , if you wish it , you shall see if I ca n't do it . "
299133	299145	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" The rocks and valleys would not allow that , aunt . "
299146	299236	298906	298907	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It 's all very well for you to laugh , my dear . If laughing would break my bones I should n't be as whole as I am now . I might have had Cheesacre if I liked , who is a substantial man , and could have kept a carriage for me ; but it was the rocks and valleys that prevented that;—and perhaps a little feeling that I might do some good to a poor fellow who has nobody in the world to look after him . "
299277	299290	299271	299271	Kate	356	" I 'm sure I hope you 'll be happy , aunt . "
299291	299303	299305	299306	Mrs. Greenow	405	" If he makes me unhappy he shall pay for it ; "
299595	299605	299606	299606	he	393	" I suppose I 'd better take a walk , "
299609	299616	299606	299606	he	393	" and perhaps the young ladies — "
299617	299625	299627	299628	Mrs. Greenow	405	" If you mean my two nieces , "
299630	299652	299627	299628	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm afraid you 'll find they are engaged . But if I 'm not too old to walk with — "
299697	299703	299705	299706	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Never mind , Captain , "
299708	299729	299705	299706	Mrs. Greenow	405	" We 'll have our walk all the same , and wo n't mind those young girls . Come along . "
299853	299859	299861	299861	she	1443	" Well , Captain Bellfield , "
299907	299925	299894	299894	he	1602	" Well , Captain Bellfield,—so I suppose I 'm to be good - natured ; am I ? "
299926	299940	299885	299885	her	1443	" Arabella , you 'll make me the happiest man in the world . "
299941	299947	299948	299948	She	1443	" That 's all fudge . "
299953	299959	299948	299948	She	1443	" all rocks and valleys , "
299968	299976	299948	299948	She	1443	" Upon my word , you will . "
299977	299986	299885	299885	her	1443	" I hope I shall make you respectable ? "
299987	299999	299885	299885	her	1443	" Oh , yes ; certainly . I quite intend that . "
300000	300023	299885	299885	her	1443	" It is the great thing that you should intend . Of course I am going to make a fool of myself . "
300024	300034	299885	299885	her	1443	" No , no ; do n't say that . "
300035	300067	299885	299885	her	1443	" If I do n't say it , all my friends will say it for me . It 's lucky for you that I do n't much care what people say . "
300068	300110	299885	299885	her	1443	" It is lucky;—I know that I 'm lucky . The very first day I saw you I thought what a happy fellow I was to meet you . Then , of course , I was only thinking of your beauty . "
300111	300117	300165	300165	she	7424	" Get along with you ! "
300118	300143	299885	299885	her	1443	" Upon my word , yes . Come , Arabella , as we are to be man and wife , you might as well . "
300179	300186	300187	300187	she	7424	" Out in the high road ! "
300190	300200	300187	300187	she	7424	" How can you be so impertinent,—and so foolish ? "
300201	300211	300165	300165	she	7424	" You might as well , you know,—just once . "
300212	300278	300165	300165	she	7424	" Captain Bellfield , I brought you out here not for such fooling as that , but in order that we might have a little chat about business . If we are to be man and wife , as you say , we ought to understand on what footing we are to begin together . I 'm afraid your own private means are not considerable ? "
300279	300291	300187	300187	she	7424	" Well , no ; they are not , Mrs. Greenow . "
300292	300297	300165	300165	she	7424	" Have you anything ? "
300310	300332	300307	300307	his	1602	" Come , Captain Bellfield , let us have the truth at once , and then we shall understand each other . "
300342	300355	300357	300358	the widow	1443	" You must have had something to live upon , I suppose ? "
300564	300577	300579	300581	the ecstatic Captain	7436	" And now you will give a fellow a kiss,—just one kiss , "
300590	300593	300595	300596	the widow	1443	" Hush ! "
300598	300612	300595	300596	the widow	1443	" there 's a carriage coming on the road — close to us . "
300613	300616	300618	300619	the widow	1443	" Hush ! "
300621	300635	300618	300619	the widow	1443	" there 's a carriage coming on the road — close to us . "
301024	301033	301035	301035	Cheesacre	395	" That man 's wanted by the police , "
301046	301057	301062	301062	he	7448	" He 's wanted by the police , Mrs. Greenow , "
301095	301103	301104	301104	he	7448	" He 's wanted by the police , "
301177	301182	301183	301183	she	405	" Oh , my ! "
301199	301204	301206	301206	Bellfield	393	" It 's false , "
301208	301213	301215	301215	Cheesacre	395	" It 's true , "
301217	301228	301230	301230	Bellfield	393	" I 'll indict you for slander , my friend , "
301232	301241	301243	301243	Cheesacre	395	" Pay me the money you owe me , "
301245	301251	301243	301243	Cheesacre	395	" You 're a swindler ! "
301309	301319	301320	301320	she	405	" What is this I hear , Captain Bellfield ? "
301323	301351	301320	301320	she	405	" It 's a lie and a slander . He merely wants to make a quarrel between us . What police are after me , Mr. Cheesacre ? "
301352	301370	301372	301372	Cheesacre	395	" It 's the police , or the sheriff 's officer , or something of the kind , "
301374	301382	301384	301385	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Oh , the sheriff 's officers ! "
301401	301433	301384	301385	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Mr. Cheesacre , you should n't come and say such things;—you should n't , indeed . Sheriff 's officers can be paid , and there 's an end of them . "
301434	301453	301455	301455	Bellfield	393	" I 'll indict him for the libel — I will , as sure as I 'm alive , "
301457	301460	301462	301463	the widow	1443	" Nonsense , "
301465	301503	301462	301463	the widow	1443	" Do n't you make a fool of yourself . When men ca n't pay their way they must put up with having things like that said of them . Mr. Cheesacre , where were you going ? "
301504	301518	301384	301385	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I was going to Vavasor Hall , on purpose to caution you . "
301519	301525	301527	301528	Mrs. Greenow	405	" It 's too late , "
301535	301580	301581	301581	He	7462	" Why , you have n't been and married him since yesterday ? He only had twenty - four hours ' start of me , I know . Or , perhaps , you had it done clandestine in Norwich ? Oh , Mrs. Greenow ! "
301609	301614	301616	301617	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I hardly know , "
301619	301637	301616	301617	Mrs. Greenow	405	" whether we can welcome you . There are other visitors , and the house is full . "
301638	301701	301616	301617	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 'm not one to intrude where I 'm not wanted . You may be sure of that . If I ca n't get my supper for love , I can get at for money . That 's more than some people can say . I wonder when you 're going to pay me what you owe me , Lieutenant Bellfield ? "
301798	301812	301814	301814	Bellfield	725	" You wo n't throw a fellow over , will you , now ? "
301873	301879	301881	301887	the boy who had driven the gig	7474	" He knows ' un , "
301894	301905	301907	301907	Bellfield	725	" It belongs to your old friend , Mr. Cheesacre , "
301911	301918	301920	301920	Kate	356	" And has he come too ? "
301935	301944	301946	301946	he	1602	" And it 's not the slightest use , "
301948	301965	301946	301946	he	1602	" not the least in the world . He never had a chance in that quarter . "
301966	301983	301985	301985	Kate	356	" Not enough of the rocks and valleys about him , was there , Captain Bellfield ? "
302046	302058	302059	302059	he	395	" He was n't going to say anything against the Captain , "
302062	302077	302059	302059	he	395	" if things were really fixed . He never begrudged any man his chance . "
302078	302084	302086	302087	Mrs. Greenow	405	" Things are really fixed , "
302148	302164	302166	302166	Cheesacre	395	" If you look at it in that light , of course it 's true , "
302182	302190	302192	302192	Cheesacre	395	" Then I 've done about that , "
302194	302219	302192	302192	Cheesacre	395	" and as to the little bit of money he owes me , I must give him his time about it , I suppose . "
302460	302473	302475	302476	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" You know you put it into my head your own self , "
302478	302485	302475	302476	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Did n't you , now ? "
302486	302495	302497	302498	the widow	1443	" But things are so different since that , "
302500	302537	302497	302498	the widow	1443	" How different ? I ai n't different . There 's Oileymead just where it always was , and the owner of it do n't owe a shilling to any man . How are things different ? "
302538	302545	302475	302476	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" My niece has inherited property . "
302546	302586	302587	302588	Mrs. Greenow	405	" And is that to make a change ? Oh ! Mrs. Greenow , who would have thought to find you mercenary like that ? Inherited property ! Is she going to fling a man over because of that ? "
302622	302644	302475	302476	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" Why , Mr. Cheesacre , I am quite sure she never gave you a word of encouragement in her life . "
302645	302659	302587	302588	Mrs. Greenow	405	" But you always told me I might have her for the asking . "
302660	302737	302475	302476	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" And now I tell you that you may n't . It 's of no use your going on there to ask her , for she will only send you away with an answer you wo n't like . Look here , Mr. Cheesacre ; you want to get married , and it 's quite time you should . There 's my dear friend Charlie Fairstairs . How could you get a better wife than Charlie ? "
302738	302742	302744	302744	Cheesacre	395	" Charlie Fairstairs ! "
302753	302787	302748	302748	his	395	" She has n't got a penny , nor any one belonging to her . The man who marries her will have to find the money for the smock she stands up in . "
302788	302835	302836	302836	They	7491	" Who 's mercenary now , Mr. Cheesacre ? Do you go home and think of it ; and if you 'll marry Charlie , I 'll go to your wedding . You sha n't be ashamed of her clothing . I 'll see to that . "
302851	302866	302868	302868	he	395	" Do you think there 's no chance at all for me , then ? "
302870	302885	302868	302868	he	395	" I know there 's none . I 've heard her speak about it . "
302886	302897	302748	302748	his	395	" Somebody else , perhaps , is the happy man ? "
302898	302929	302868	302868	he	395	" I ca n't say anything about that , but I know that she would n't take you . I like farming , you know , but she does n't . "
302930	302937	302939	302939	Cheesacre	395	" I might give that up , "
302940	302948	302868	302868	he	395	readily,—"at any rate , for a time . "
302949	302975	302976	302976	He	395	" No , no , no ; it would do no good . Believe me , my friend , that it is of no use . "
302983	302997	302999	302999	he	395	" I do n't see what 's the use of my going in , "
303009	303017	303018	303018	he	395	" There 's a pride about me , "
303021	303035	303018	303018	he	395	" that I do n't choose to go where I 'm not wanted . "
303036	303056	302976	302976	He	395	" I ca n't tell you , Mr. Cheesacre , that you are wanted in that light , certainly . "
303057	303121	303018	303018	he	395	" Then I 'll go . Perhaps you 'll be so good as to tell the boy with the gig to come after me ? That 's six pound ten it will have cost me to come here and go back . Bellfield did it cheaper , of course ; he travelled second class . I heard of him as I came along . "
303122	303134	302976	302976	He	395	" The expense does not matter to you , Mr. Cheesacre . "
303210	303215	303217	303218	the widow	1443	" And Mr. Cheesacre , "
303228	303236	303217	303218	the widow	1443	" do n't forget dear Charlie Fairstairs . "
303271	303276	303277	303277	Kate	356	" Where is he ? "
303294	303299	303301	303302	the widow	1443	" He has gone , "
303339	303345	303347	303347	she	356	" I am so glad , "
303349	303360	303347	303347	she	356	" What on earth should we have done with him ? "
303361	303371	303373	303373	Alice	337	" I never was so disappointed in my life , "
303375	303391	303373	303373	Alice	337	" I have heard so much of Mr. Cheesacre , but have never seen him . "
303406	303417	303419	303420	the boy	2489	" He ai n't a been and took hisself off ? "
303462	303482	303484	303485	Mrs. Greenow	405	" You drive after him , young gentleman , and you 'll find him on the road to Shap , "
303487	303495	303497	303498	the Captain	1602	" Mind you give him my love , "
303503	303516	303497	303498	the Captain	1602	" and say I hope he 'll get his turnips in well . "
303633	303673	303623	303623	he	1602	" Yes , indeed . Old Cheesacre , in spite of his absurdities , is not a bad sort of fellow at bottom;—awfully fond of his money , you know , Miss Vavasor , and always boasting about it . "
303674	303680	303682	303682	Alice	337	" That 's not pleasant , "
303684	303749	303682	303682	Alice	337	" No , the most unpleasant thing in the world . There 's nothing I hate so much , Miss Vavasor , as that kind of talking . My idea is this,—when a man has lots of money , let him make the best use he can of it , and say nothing about it . Nobody ever heard me talking about my money . "
303844	303860	303862	303862	she	3013	" As long as there 's anything kept back , I wo n't have you , "
303864	303890	303862	303862	she	3013	" I wo n't become your wife till I 'm quite sure there 's not a penny owing that is not shown in the list . "
304232	304240	304242	304242	she	405	" I think of taking this house , "
304244	304250	304242	304242	she	405	" and of living here . "
304251	304257	304259	304260	the Captain	1602	" What , in Westmoreland ! "
304286	304319	304267	304267	his	1602	" Yes , in Westmoreland . Why not in Westmoreland as well as anywhere else ? If you do n't like Westmoreland , it 's not too late yet , you know . "
304340	304351	304353	304354	Mrs. Greenow	405	" I 've been talking to my niece about it , "
304356	304394	304353	304354	Mrs. Greenow	405	" and I find that such an arrangement can be made very conveniently . The property is left between her and her uncle,—the father of my other niece , and neither of them want to live here . "
304395	304407	304496	304497	the widow	1443	" But wo n't you be rather dull , my dear ? "
304408	304422	304353	304354	Mrs. Greenow	405	" We could go to Yarmouth , you know , in the autumn . "
304433	304467	304424	304425	the Captain	1602	" And perhaps , if you are not extravagant , we could manage a month or so in London during the winter , just to see the plays and do a little shopping . "
304477	304483	304485	304485	he	1602	" That will be delightful , "
304487	304494	304496	304497	the widow	1443	" And as for being dull , "
304499	304517	304496	304497	the widow	1443	" when people grow old they must be dull . Dancing ca n't go on for ever . "
304566	304572	304574	304574	she	1443	" There goes my cap , "
304576	304588	304574	304574	she	1443	" What a goose you are ! What will Jeannette say ? "
304589	304593	304595	304596	the Captain	1602	" Bother Jeannette , "
304601	304616	304595	304596	the Captain	1602	" She can do another cap , and many more wo n't be wanted . "
304699	304706	304708	304709	the widow	1443	" We 'll have her afterwards , "
304713	304749	304708	304709	the widow	1443	" when you are gone , and we shall want her more . And I 'll get Cheesacre here , and make him marry her . There 's no good in paying for two journeys . "
304833	304849	304850	304850	he	1602	" Captain Bellfield , of Vavasor Hall , Westmoreland . It do n't sound badly , "
305016	305027	305028	305028	she	552	" Perhaps , after all , he has arranged it , "
305051	305055	305043	305043	Burgo	728	" arranged it . "
305404	305411	305413	305414	the man	8761	" All ready , your honour , "
305416	305426	305428	305428	Burgo	728	" I sha n't want you to - night , "
305430	305433	305428	305428	Burgo	728	hoarsely;—"go away . "
305434	305443	305488	305488	he	8761	" And about the things , your honour ? "
305444	305486	305488	305488	he	8761	" Take them to the devil . No ; stop . Take them back with you , and ask somebody to keep them till I send for them . I shall want them and another carriage in a day or two . "
305541	305553	305555	305556	the waterman	7593	" It 's a ' eiress , I 'll go bail , "
305558	305572	305574	305575	the driver	1476	" Pretty dear ! I suppose her parints was too many for her , "
306320	306323	306324	306324	she	8742	" Ah ! "
306327	306334	306324	306324	she	8742	" I saw you once before . "—"Then
306343	306347	306324	306324	she	8742	" said Burgo . "
306354	306359	306348	306348	You	427	" said the girl . "
306371	306376	306378	306378	Burgo	427	"—"I wish I had , "
306380	306388	306390	306391	the girl	922	" And plenty to eat and drink , "
306393	306426	306390	306391	the girl	922	" and you are so handsome ! I remember you . You gave me supper one night when I was starving . I ai n't hungry now . Will you give me a kiss?"—"I'll
306437	306441	306390	306391	the girl	922	" said Burgo . "
306449	306476	306444	306444	me	0	" said the girl . He gave her first the kiss , and then the shilling , and after that he left her and passed on . "
306488	306494	306495	306495	I	0	" he said to himself . "
306503	306508	306509	306509	He	922	" thought the girl . "
306530	306757	306518	306518	I	0	" Burgo went on , and made his way into the house in Grosvenor Square , by some means probably unknown to his aunt , and certainly unknown to his uncle . He emptied his pockets as he got into bed , and counted a roll of notes which he had kept in one of them . There were still a hundred and thirty pounds left . Lady Glencora had promised that she would see him again . She had said as much as that quite distinctly . But what use would there be in that if all his money should then be gone ? He knew that the keeping of money in his pocket was to him quite an impossibility . Then he thought of his aunt . What should he say to his aunt if he saw her in the course of the coming day ? Might it not be as well for him to avoid his aunt altogether ? He breakfasted up - stairs in his bedroom,—in the bed , indeed , eating a small paté de foie gras from the supper - table , as he read a French novel . There he was still reading his French novel in bed when his aunt 's maid came to him , saying that his aunt wished to see him before she went out . "
306763	306767	306518	306518	I	0	" said he , "
306774	306775	306776	306776	She	7624	" "
306811	307063	307064	307066	the old girl	7624	" From which it may be seen that Lucy shared the general feminine feeling in favour of poor Burgo . Thus summoned Burgo applied himself to his toilet ; but as he did so , he recruited his energies from time to time by a few pages of the French novel , and also by small doses from a bottle of curaçoa which he had in his bedroom . He was utterly a pauper . There was no pauper poorer than he in London that day . But , nevertheless , he breakfasted on paté de foie gras and curaçoa , and regarded those dainties very much as other men regard bread and cheese and beer . But though he was dressing at the summons of his aunt , he had by no means made up his mind that he would go to her . Why should he go to her ? What good would it do him ? She would not give him more money . She would only scold him for his misconduct . She might , perhaps , turn him out of the house if he did not obey her,—or attempt to do so ; but she would be much more likely to do this when he had made her angry by contradicting her . In neither case would he leave the house , even though its further use were positively forbidden him , because his remaining there was convenient ; but as he could gain nothing by seeing "
307068	307150	307064	307066	the old girl	7624	" as he had called her , he resolved to escape to his club without attending to her summons . But his aunt , who was a better general than he , out - manœuvred him . He crept down the back stairs ; but as he could not quite condescend to escape through the area , he was forced to emerge upon the hall , and here his aunt pounced upon him , coming out of the breakfast - parlour . "
307163	307265	307157	307157	I	0	" Lady Monk asked , with severity in her voice . Burgo replied , with perfect ease , that he was going out just to have his hair washed and brushed . He would have been back in twenty minutes . There was no energy about the poor fellow , unless , perhaps , when he was hunting ; but he possessed a readiness which enabled him to lie at a moment 's notice with the most perfect ease . Lady Monk did not believe him ; but she could not confute him , and therefore she let the lie pass . "
307272	307276	307277	307277	I	0	" she said . "
307292	307314	307315	307315	Burgo	728	" As there was no way of escape left to him , he followed his aunt into the breakfast - parlour . "
307317	307339	307315	307315	Burgo	728	" she said , when she had seated herself , and had made him sit in a chair opposite to her , "
307351	307352	307340	307340	I	0	" "
307363	307364	307358	307358	I	0	" "

307569	307689	307562	307562	he	583	" said Burgo , opening his eyes , and stretching his nostrils , and looking into his aunt 's face as though he had great ground for indignation . But the turning of Burgo out of the house was not Lady Monk 's immediate purpose . She knew that he would hang on there till the season was over . After that he must not be allowed to return again , unless he should have succeeded in a certain enterprise . She had now caught him in order that she might learn whether there was any possible remaining chance of success as to that enterprise . So she received his indignation in silence , and began upon another subject . "

308096	308115	308084	308084	he	9731	" Lady Monk sat silent for a few moments , and then she said in a low voice , "
308133	308186	308129	308129	her	7641	" She , at any rate , was not deficient in energy . She was anxious enough to see her purpose accomplished . She would have conducted the matter with discretion , if the running away with Mr. Palliser 's wife could , in very fact , have been done by herself . "
308200	308201	308195	308195	She	7641	" "
308207	308208	308195	308195	She	7641	" "
308223	308224	308211	308211	she	7641	" "

308333	308666	308327	308327	She	7641	" Again Lady Monk sat silent . She had a plan in her head,—a plan that might , as she thought , give to her nephew one more chance . But she hesitated before she could bring herself to explain it in detail . At first she had lent a little aid to this desired abduction of Mr. Palliser 's wife , but in lending it had said no word upon the subject . During the last season she had succeeded in getting Lady Glencora to her house in London , and had taken care that Burgo should meet her there . Then a hint or two had been spoken , and Lady Glencora had been asked to Monkshade . Lady Glencora , as we know , did not go to Monkshade , and Lady Monk had then been baffled . But she did not therefore give up the game . Having now thought of it so much , she began to speak of it more boldly , and had procured money for her nephew that he might thereby be enabled to carry off the woman . But though this had been well understood between them , though words had been spoken which were sufficiently explicit , the plan had not been openly discussed . Lady Monk had known nothing of the mode in which Lady Glencora was to have been carried off after her party , nor whither she was to have been taken . But now,—now she must arrange it herself , and have a scheme of her own , or else the thing must fail absolutely . Even she was almost reluctant to speak out plainly to her nephew on such a subject . What if he should be false to her , and tell of her ? But when a woman has made such schemes , nothing distresses her so sadly as their failure . She would risk all rather than that Mr. Palliser should keep his wife . "
308674	308688	308667	308667	I	0	" she said at last , speaking hoarsely , almost in a whisper , "
308699	308700	308667	308667	I	0	" "
308703	308706	308667	308667	I	0	" said he "
308739	308740	308723	308723	him,—or	7653	" "
308820	308821	308806	308806	She	7656	" "
308825	308826	308806	308806	She	7656	" "
308846	308847	308806	308806	She	7656	" "
308854	308855	308806	308806	She	7656	" "
308920	308936	308914	308914	she	7656	" After that , who will say that Lady Monk was not a devoted aunt ? "
308943	308949	308914	308914	she	7656	" said the enraptured Burgo . "
309046	309054	309043	309043	you	0	" Burgo declared that he did understand . "
309087	309161	309043	309043	you	0	" Then she made inquiry about his money , and took from him the notes which he had , promising to return them , with something added , on the Thursday morning ; but he asked , with a little whine , for a five - pound note , and got it . Burgo then told her about the travelling - bags and the stockings , and they were quite pleasant and confidential . "
309172	309177	309043	309043	you	0	" said Lady Monk . "
309205	309389	309197	309197	I	0	" Was there ever such an aunt ? After this , Burgo left his aunt , and went away to his club , in a state of most happy excitement . Alice , on her return from Westmoreland , went direct to Park Lane , whither Lady Glencora and Mr. Palliser had also returned before her . She was to remain with them in London one entire day , and on the morning after that they were to start for Paris . She found Mr. Palliser in close attendance upon his wife . Not that there was anything in his manner which at all implied that he was keeping watch over her , or that he was more with her , or closer to her than a loving husband might wish to be with a young wife ; but the mode of life was very different from that which Alice had seen at Matching Priory ! On her arrival Mr. Palliser himself received her in the hall , and took her up to his wife before she had taken off her travelling hat . "
309401	309405	309398	309399	Miss Vavasor	337	" he said . "
309415	309416	309413	309413	Glencora	488	" "
309421	309425	309413	309413	Glencora	488	" she said ; "
309439	309468	309469	309469	You	7674	" He merely smiled , and shook his head , and then took her up - stairs . On the stairs he said one other word to her : "
309488	309642	309481	309481	she	488	" Alice muttered something,—some little fib of courtesy as to the matter having been forgotten , or never borne in mind ; and then they went on to Lady Glencora 's room . It seemed to Alice that he was not so big or so much to be dreaded as when she had seen him at Matching . His descent from an expectant , or more than an expectant , Chancellor of the Exchequer , down to a simple , attentive husband , seemed to affect his gait , his voice , and all his demeanour . When he received Alice at the Priory he certainly loomed before her as something great , whereas now his greatness seemed to have fallen from him . We must own that this was hard upon him , seeing that the deed by which he had divested himself of his greatness had been so pure and good ! "
309668	309748	309663	309663	Plantagenet	484	" Plantagenet winced a little under this , as the hero of old must have winced when he was found with the distaff . Mr. Palliser had relinquished his sword of state for the distaff which he had assumed , and could take no glory in the change . There was , too , in his wife 's voice the slightest hint of mockery , which , slight as it was , he perhaps thought she might have spared . "
309756	309760	309749	309749	You	337	" continued Glencora , "
309774	309775	309776	309776	I	0	" "
309781	309785	309776	309776	I	0	" said Alice . "
309833	309834	309831	309831	Plantagenet	484	" "
309851	309852	309831	309831	Plantagenet	484	" "
309906	309948	309950	309950	I	0	" Alice , who by this time had followed her friend along the passage to her bedroom , and had seen how widely the packages were spread about , bethought herself that the market - basket should be a large one . "
310005	310006	310001	310001	he	484	" "
310019	310029	310007	310007	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , who had followed them . "
310039	310044	310036	310036	her	337	" said Lady Glencora . "
310064	310065	310062	310062	Alice	337	" "
310075	310079	310066	310066	I	0	" said Alice . "
310126	310127	310128	310128	I	0	" "
310145	310239	310128	310128	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . The notion of Lady Glencora packing anything for herself was as good a joke as that other one of the Kurds and whey . But she went flitting about from room to room , declaring that this thing must be taken , and that other , till the market - basket would have become very large indeed . Alice was astonished at the extent of the preparations , and the sort of equipage with which they were about to travel . Lady Glencora was taking her own carriage . "
310248	310254	310256	310256	he	7688	" she said to Alice , "
310281	310282	310279	310279	he	7688	" "
310286	310290	310279	310279	he	7688	" said Alice . "
310297	310298	310293	310294	no one	1000	" "
310303	310308	310293	310294	no one	1000	" said Lady Glencora . "
310347	310367	310374	310374	them	7694	" Two women and two men servants were to be taken . Alice had received permission to bring her own maid—"or
310376	310382	310372	310372	you	7693	" Lady Glencora had said . "
310429	310457	310422	310422	you	7693	" But as both Lady Glencora 's servants spoke French , and as her own did not , Alice trusted herself in that respect to her cousin . "
310466	310471	310458	310458	You	7693	" said Lady Glencora . "
310507	310532	310502	310502	you	7693	" When Alice asked why it was supposed that Mr. Palliser was so specially devoted to her , the thing was explained to her . "
310661	310662	310663	310663	You	0	" "
310667	310668	310669	310669	I	0	" "
310711	310712	310713	310713	Cora	537	" "
310729	310730	310722	310722	I	0	" "
310835	310866	310868	310868	he	0	" On the following morning they breakfasted early , because Mr. Palliser had got into an early habit . He had said that early hours would be good for them . "
310874	310879	310868	310868	he	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
310890	310894	310880	310880	I	0	" said Alice . "
310900	310905	310880	310880	I	0	" her cousin answered ; "
310952	311082	310940	310940	we	7707	" After breakfast they all three went to work to do nothing . It was ludicrous and almost painful to see Mr. Palliser wandering about and counting the boxes , as though he could do any good by that . At this special crisis of his life he hated his papers and figures and statistics , and could not apply himself to them . He , whose application had been so unremitting , could apply himself now to nothing . His world had been brought to an abrupt end , and he was awkward at making a new beginning . I believe that they all three were reading novels before one o'clock . Lady Glencora and Alice had determined that they would not leave the house throughout the day . "
311120	311469	311112	311112	I	0	" There was , however , no absolute necessity that Mr. Palliser should remain with them ; and , at about three , he prepared himself for a solitary walk . He would not go down to the House . All interest in the House was over with him for the present . He had the Speaker 's leave to absent himself for the season . Nor would he call on anyone . All his friends knew , or believed they knew , that he had left town . His death and burial had been already chronicled , and were he now to reappear , he could reappear only as a ghost . He was being talked of as the departed one;—or rather , such talk on all sides had now come nearly to an end . The poor Duke of St. Bungay still thought of him with regret when more than ordinarily annoyed by some special grievance coming to him from Mr. Finespun ; but even the Duke had become almost reconciled to the present order of things . Mr. Palliser knew better than to disturb all this by showing himself again in public ; and prepared himself , therefore , to take another walk under the elms in Kensington Gardens . He had his hat on his head in the hall , and was in the act of putting on his gloves , when there came a knock at the front door . The hall - porter was there , a stout , plethoric personage , not given to many words , who was at this moment standing with his master 's umbrella in his hand , looking as though he would fain be of some use to somebody , if any such utility were compatible with the purposes of his existence . Now had come this knock at the door , while the umbrella was still in his hand , and the nature of his visage changed , and it was easy to see that he was oppressed by the temporary multiplicity of his duties . "
311477	311502	311475	311475	John	353	" said Mr. Palliser . John gave up the umbrella , and opening the door disclosed Burgo Fitzgerald standing upon the door - step . "
311509	311559	311504	311505	Lady Glencora	488	" asked Burgo , before he had seen the husband . John turned a dismayed face upon his master , as though he knew that the comer ought not to be making a morning call at that house,—as no doubt he did know very well,—and made no instant reply . "
311565	311580	311560	311560	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , making his way out as he had originally purposed . "
311589	311647	311581	311582	The servant	9492	" Then he went on his way across Park Lane and into the Park , never once turning back his face to see whether Burgo had effected an entrance into the house . Nor did he return a minute earlier than he would otherwise have done . After all , there was something chivalrous about the man . "
311656	311791	311792	311792	they	7712	" said the porter , not stirring to make any further inquiry . It was no business of his if Mr. Palliser chose to receive such a guest . He had not been desired to say that her ladyship was not at home . Burgo was therefore admitted and shown direct up into the room in which Lady Glencora was sitting . As chance would have it , she was alone . Alice had left her and was in her own chamber , and Lady Glencora was sitting at the window of the small room up - stairs that overlooked the Park . She was seated on a footstool with her face between her hands when Burgo was admitted , thinking of him , and of what the world might have been to her had "
311797	311827	311792	311792	they	7712	" as she was in the habit of saying to Alice and to herself . She rose quickly , so that he saw her only as she was rising . "
311836	311857	311858	311858	Cora	537	" she said , as the servant left the room ; and then she came forward to greet her lover . "
311860	311889	311890	311890	Cora	537	" he said , dashing at once into his subject — hopelessly , but still with a resolve to do as he had said that he would do . "
311906	311907	311908	311908	I	0	" "
311915	311919	311908	311908	I	0	" said she . "

311946	311950	311951	311952	Mr. Fitzgerald	503	" she said . "
312014	312015	312004	312004	God	431	" "
312026	312046	312004	312004	God	431	" He was standing close to her , but hitherto he had only touched her hand at greeting her . "
312054	312058	312052	312052	Cora	537	" he said . "
312102	312103	312107	312107	you	537	" "
312112	312113	312107	312107	you	537	" "
312137	312138	312139	312139	You	537	" "
312192	312193	312196	312196	Burgo	427	" "
312214	312228	312208	312208	You	537	" As she spoke the door was opened and Alice entered the room . "
312235	312240	312232	312233	Mr. Fitzgerald	503	" said Lady Glencora . "
312265	312372	312259	312259	he	8726	" Alice was dumbfounded , and knew not how to speak either to him or to her ; but she stood with her eyes riveted on the face of the man of whom she had heard so much . Yes ; certainly he was very beautiful . She had never before seen man 's beauty such as that . She found it quite impossible to speak a word to him then — at the spur of the moment , but she acknowledged the introduction with a slight inclination of the head , and then stood silent , as though she were waiting for him to go . "
312385	312504	312505	312505	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . Poor Burgo also found it difficult enough to speak . What could he say ? His cause was one which certainly did not admit of being pleaded in the presence of a strange lady ; and he might have known from the moment in which he heard Glencora 's request that a third person should be summoned to their meeting — and probably did know , that there was no longer any hope for him . It was not on the cards that he should win . But there remained one thing that he must do . He must get himself out of that room ; and how was he to effect that ? "

312607	312611	312585	312585	You	7721	" said Alice , "

312648	312657	312658	312658	Alice	337	" said he , still standing his ground . "
312660	312665	312658	312658	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora , "
312681	312756	312674	312674	he	503	" In such contests , a woman has ever the best of it at all points . The man plays with a button to his foil , while the woman uses a weapon that can really wound . Burgo knew that he must go,—felt that he must skulk away as best he might , and perhaps hear a low titter of half - suppressed laughter as he went . Even that might be possible . "
312762	312766	312759	312760	Lady Glencora	488	" he said , "
312806	312836	312793	312793	you	488	" He then turned to go , bowing again very slightly to Miss Vavasor . He was on the threshold of the door before Glencora 's voice recalled him . "
312841	312845	312793	312793	you	488	" she said , "
312858	312877	312856	312856	Burgo	563	" And he was back with her in a moment , and had taken her by the hand . "
312880	312884	312885	312885	pray,—pray	10775	" said Alice , "
312907	312908	312890	312891	Mr. Fitzgerald	503	" "
312915	312920	312909	312909	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
312934	312960	312929	312929	he	563	" She was holding him by the hand now and turning to him , away from Alice , who had taken her by the arm . "
312963	312983	312961	312961	Burgo	563	" she said , repeating his name twice again , with all the passion that she could throw into the word,—"Burgo
313037	313064	313035	313035	you	563	" She still held him by the hand , and was now gazing up into his face , while the tears were streaming from her eyes . "
313067	313071	313065	313065	Sir	9140	" said Alice , "
313100	313101	313095	313095	you	9140	" "
313117	313118	313109	313109	she	7734	" "
313162	313163	313153	313153	you	9140	" "

313231	313329	313225	313225	Alice	337	" He still held her , but she would have been gone from him had he not stooped over her , and put his arm round her waist . In doing this , I doubt whether he was quicker than she would have been had she chosen to resist him . As it was , he pressed her to his bosom , and , stooping over her , kissed her lips . Then he left her , and making his way out of the room , and down the stairs , got himself out into the street . "
313338	313342	313225	313225	Alice	337	" said Alice . "
313348	313353	313225	313225	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora , "
313360	313361	313355	313355	you	7739	" "
313368	313369	313371	313371	I	0	" "
313457	313458	313463	313463	he	7738	" "

313550	313597	313540	313540	He	7738	" Alice knew that it was useless to argue with her , so she came and sat over her,—for Lady Glencora had again placed herself on the stool by the window,—and tried to sooth her by smoothing her hair , and nursing her like a child . "
313611	313630	313603	313603	I	0	" she said , breaking out , almost with rage , and speaking with quick , eager voice . "
313766	313767	313756	313757	my uncle	8820	" "
313773	313774	313775	313775	I	0	" "

313933	314090	314091	314091	You	7758	" Mr. Palliser did at once as his wife had said , and came up - stairs to the little front room , as soon as he had deposited his hat in the hall . Alice was , in fact , in doubt what she should do , as to mentioning , or omitting to mention , Mr. Fitzgerald 's name . In an ordinary way , it would be natural that she should name any visitor who had called , and she specially disliked the idea of remaining silent because that visitor had come as the lover of her host 's wife . But , on the other hand , she owed much to Lady Glencora ; and there was no imperative reason , as things had gone , why she should make mischief . There was no further danger to be apprehended . But Mr. Palliser at once put an end to her doubts . "
314098	314102	314091	314091	You	7758	" said he . "
314105	314109	314091	314091	You	7758	" said Alice . "
314118	314123	314112	314112	him	9697	" said Mr. Palliser . "
314160	314161	314162	314162	He	9697	" "
314170	314174	314167	314167	I	0	" said Alice . "
314180	314195	314196	314196	I	0	" continued Mr. Palliser , without any apparent notice of what Alice had said , "
314214	314215	314216	314216	She	488	" "
314252	314253	314245	314245	she	488	" "
314262	314263	314245	314245	she	488	" "
314275	314276	314269	314269	I	0	" "
314286	314309	314277	314277	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , after waiting for a few moments . He had probably thought that Alice would say something further . "
314405	314537	314538	314538	I	0	" As he made this little speech I wonder whether his conscience said anything to him about Lady Dumbello , and a certain evening in his own life , on which he had ventured to call that lady , Griselda . The little party of three dined together very quietly , and after dinner they all went to work with their novels . Before long Alice saw that Mr. Palliser was yawning , and she began to understand how much he had given up in order that his wife might be secure . It was then , when he had left the room for a few minutes , in order that he might wake himself by walking about the house , that Glencora told Alice of his yawning down at Matching . "
314557	314558	314597	314597	he	7767	" "
314566	314570	314597	314597	he	7767	" said Alice . "
314577	314582	314597	314597	he	7767	" said the other ; "
314638	314639	314640	314640	You	0	" "
314649	314650	314640	314640	You	0	" "
314690	314841	314676	314676	I	0	" Then Mr. Palliser having walked off his sleep , returned to the room , and the remainder of the evening was passed in absolute tranquillity . Burgo Fitzgerald , when he left the house , turned back into Grosvenor Square , not knowing , at first , whither he was going . He took himself as far as his uncle 's door , and then , having paused there for a moment , hurried on . For half an hour , or thereabouts , something like true feeling was at work within his heart . He had once more pressed to his bosom the woman he had , at any rate , thought that he had loved . He had had his arm round her , and had kissed her , and the tone with which she had called him by his name was still ringing in his ears , "
314844	315287	314676	314676	I	0	" He repeated his own name audibly to himself , as though in this way he could recall her voice . He comforted himself for a minute with the conviction that she loved him . He felt,—for a moment,—that he could live on such consolation as that ! But among mortals there could , in truth , hardly be one with whom such consolation would go a shorter way . He was a man who required to have such comfort backed by patés and curaçoa to a very large extent , and now it might be doubted whether the amount of patés and curaçoa at his command would last him much longer . He would not go in and tell his aunt at once of his failure , as he could gain nothing by doing so . Indeed , he thought that he would not tell his aunt at all . So he turned back from Grosvenor Square , and went down to his club in St. James 's Street , feeling that billiards and brandy - and - water might , for the present , be the best restorative . But , as he went back , he blamed himself very greatly in the matter of those bank - notes which he had allowed Lady Monk to take from him . How had it come to pass that he had been such a dupe in her hands ? When he entered his club in St. James 's Street his mind had left Lady Glencora , and was hard at work considering how he might best contrive to get that spoil out of his aunt 's possession . On the following morning everybody was stirring by times at Mr. Palliser 's house in Park Lane , and the master of that house yawned no more . There is some life in starting for a long journey , and the life is the stronger and the fuller if the things and people to be carried are numerous and troublesome . Lady Glencora was a little troublesome , and would not come down to breakfast in time . When rebuked on account of this manifest breach of engagement , she asserted that the next train would do just as well ; and when Mr. Palliser proved to her , with much trouble , that the next train could not enable them to reach Paris on that day , she declared that it would be much more comfortable to take a week in going than to hurry over the ground in one day . There was nothing she wanted so much as to see Folkestone . "
315303	315313	315297	315297	you	7772	" said Mr. Palliser , in his gravest voice . "
315330	315331	315297	315297	you	7772	" "
315344	315349	315297	315297	you	7772	" said Lady Glencora , "
315403	315630	315633	315633	dear	8889	" All this was trying to Mr. Palliser ; but I think that he enjoyed it , nevertheless , and that he was happy when he found that he did get his freight off from the Pimlico Station in the proper train . Of course Lady Glencora and Alice were very ill crossing the Channel ; of course the two maids were worse than their mistresses ; of course the men kept out of their master 's way when they were wanted , and drank brandy - and - water with the steward down - stairs ; and of course Lady Glencora declared that she would not allow herself to be carried beyond Boulogne that day;—but , nevertheless , they did get on to Paris . Had Mr. Palliser become Chancellor of the Exchequer , as he had once hoped , he could hardly have worked harder than he did work . It was he who found out which carriage had been taken for them , and who put , with his own hands , the ladies ' dressing - cases and cloaks on to the seats,—who laid out the novels , which , of course , were not read by the road,—and made preparations as though this stage of their journey was to take them a week , instead of five hours and a half . "
315640	315652	315633	315633	dear	8889	" said Lady Glencora , as they came near to Paris . "
315661	315668	315653	315653	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , joyfully . "
315701	315702	315695	315695	they	7785	" "
315715	315719	315712	315712	I	0	" said Alice . "
315729	315734	315712	315712	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
315794	315966	315786	315786	One	1066	" Mr. Palliser said nothing , but he sighed as he thought of being absent for a whole year . He had said that such was his intention , and would not at once go back from what he himself had said . But how was he to live for twelve months out of the House of Commons ? What was he to do with himself , with his intellect and his energy , during all these coming dreary days ? And then,—he might have been Chancellor of the Exchequer ! He might even now , at this very moment , have been upon his legs , making a financial statement of six hours ' duration , to the delight of one - half of the House , and bewilderment of the other , instead of dragging cloaks across that dingy , dull , dirty waiting - room at the Paris Station , in which British subjects are kept in prison while their boxes are being tumbled out of the carriages . "
315976	315983	315974	315974	we	7789	" said Lady Glencora , mournfully . "
316001	316002	315994	315994	We	7789	" "
316011	316012	316006	316006	we	7789	" "
316019	316024	316006	316006	we	7789	" pleaded Mr. Palliser . "
316034	316126	316032	316032	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora as she got into the carriage that was waiting for her . Alice thought of the last time in which she had been in that room,—when George and Kate had been with her,—and the two girls had been quite content to wait patiently while their trunks were being examined . But Alice was now travelling with great people,—with people who never spoke of their wealth , or seemed ever to think of it , but who showed their consciousness of it at every turn of their lives . "
316130	316140	316032	316032	Alice	337	" Alice had said to herself more than once , "
316153	316369	316370	316370	I	0	" They stayed in Paris for a week , and during that time Alice found that she became very intimate with Mr. Palliser . At Matching she had , in truth , seen but little of him , and had known nothing . Now she began to understand his character , and learned how to talk to him , She allowed him to tell her of things in which Lady Glencora resolutely persisted in taking no interest . She delighted him by writing down in a little pocket - book the number of eggs that were consumed in Paris every day , whereas Glencora protested that the information was worth nothing unless her husband could tell her how many of the eggs were good , and how many bad . And Alice was glad to find that a hundred and fifty thousand female operatives were employed in Paris , while Lady Glencora said it was a great shame , and that they ought all to have husbands . When Mr. Palliser explained that that was impossible , because of the redundancy of the female population , she angered him very much by asserting that she saw a great many men walking about who , she was quite sure , had not wives of their own . "
316379	316387	316374	316374	you	7791	" Glencora said to Alice that evening . "
316503	316526	316496	316496	My	0	" They went into no society at Paris , and at the end of a week were all glad to leave it . "
316538	316543	316532	316532	Baden	264	" Lady Glencora said ; "
316568	316576	316577	316577	I	0	" To this , Mr. Palliser demurred . "
316593	316594	316577	316577	I	0	" "
316606	316611	316612	316612	I	0	" his wife pleaded . "
316619	316624	316612	316612	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
316630	316633	316628	316628	I	0	" said his wife,—"if
316643	316644	316628	316628	I	0	" "
316659	316892	316648	316648	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . Upon this , Lady Glencora shrugged her shoulders , and made a mock grimace to her cousin . All this her husband bore for a while meekly , and it must be acknowledged that he behaved very well . But , then , he had his own way in everything . Lady Glencora did not behave very well,—contradicting her husband , and not considering , as , perhaps , she ought to have done , the sacrifice he was making on her behalf . But , then , she had her own way in nothing . She had her own way in almost nothing ; but on one point she did conquer her husband . He was minded to go from Paris back to Cologne , and so down the Rhine to Baden . Lady Glencora declared that she hated the Rhine,—that , of all rivers , it was the most distasteful to her ; that , of all scenery , the scenery of the Rhine was the most over - praised ; and that she would be wretched all the time if she were carried that way . Upon this , Mr. Palliser referred the matter to Alice ; and she , who had last been upon the Rhine with her cousins Kate and George Vavasor , voted for going to Baden by way of Strasbourg . "
316901	316908	316893	316893	We	7798	" said Mr. Palliser , gallantly . "
316920	316924	316911	316911	I	0	" said Glencora . "
316935	316940	316932	316932	I	0	" said her husband . "

316967	316972	316941	316941	You	0	" said his wife . "
316979	317050	317051	317051	They	7800	" They got on to Baden,—with very little delay at Strasbourg , and found half an hotel prepared for their reception . Here the carriage was brought into use for the first time , and the mistress of the carriage talked of sending home for Dandy and Flirt . Mr. Palliser , when he heard the proposition , calmly assured his wife that the horses would not bear the journey . "
317059	317063	317051	317051	They	7800	" he said , "
317076	317077	317078	317078	I	0	" "
317093	317123	317124	317124	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora . This angered Mr. Palliser , who had really , for a few minutes , thought of pacifying his wife by sending for the horses . "
317126	317133	317124	317124	Alice	337	" she asked , one morning , "
317147	317175	317124	317124	Alice	337	" Mr. Palliser , who at the moment was in the act of eating one , threw down his spoon , and pushed his plate from him . "
317183	317187	317181	317181	Plantagenet	484	" she asked . "
317191	317195	317181	317181	Plantagenet	484	" he said . "

317224	317229	317230	317230	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora . "
317239	317249	317233	317233	you	337	" Alice said that she did understand very well . "
317255	317260	317252	317252	she	7802	" said Mr. Palliser . "

317355	317410	317350	317350	she	337	" Mr. Palliser , as he wandered that day alone through the gambling - rooms at the great Assembly House , thought that , after all , it might have been better for him to have remained in London , to have become Chancellor of the Exchequer , and to have run all risks . "
317436	317502	317420	317420	I	0	" Lady Glencora said to her cousin , on the evening of the same day , in one of those gambling salons . There had been some music on that evening in one side of the building , and the Pallisers had gone to the rooms . But as neither of the two ladies would dance , they had strayed away into the other apartments . "
317510	317514	317420	317420	I	0	" said Alice ; "

318290	318366	318273	318278	the man to whom I belong	7830	" They were now standing near to one end of the table , and suddenly there came to be an opening through the crowd up to the table itself . Lady Glencora , leaving Alice 's side , at once stepped up and deposited a piece of gold on one of the marked compartments . As soon as she placed it she retreated again with flushed face , and took hold of Alice 's arm . "
318369	318373	318273	318278	the man to whom I belong	7830	" she said , "
318379	318442	318443	318443	I	0	" Alice , in her dismay , did not know what step to take . She could not scold her friend now , as the eyes of many were turned upon them , nor could she , of course , leave her , as she had threatened . Lady Glencora laughed with her peculiar little low laughter , and stood her ground . "
318455	318784	318446	318446	you	7831	" she said . One of the ministers at the table had in the meantime gone on with the cards , and had called the game ; and another minister had gently pushed three or four more pieces of gold up to that which Lady Glencora had flung down , and had then cunningly caught her eye , and , with all the courtesy of which he was master , had pushed them further on towards her . She had supposed herself to be unknown there in the salon , but no doubt all the croupiers and half the company knew well enough who was the new customer at the table . There was still the space open , near to which she stood , and then someone motioned to her to come and take up the money which she had won . She hesitated , and then the croupier asked her , in that low , indifferent voice which these men always use , whether she desired that her money should remain . She nodded her head to him , and he at once drew the money back again to the spot on which she had placed the first napoleon . Again the cards were turned up softly , again the game was called , and again she won . The money was dealt out to her,—on this occasion with a full hand . There were lying there between twenty and thirty napoleons , of which she was the mistress . Her face had flushed before , but now it became very red . She caught hold of Alice , who was literally trembling beside her , and tried to laugh again . But there was that in her eye which told Alice that she was really frightened . Some one then placed a chair for her at the table , and in her confusion , not knowing what she was to do , she seated herself . "
318788	318812	318813	318813	You	7832	" said Alice , taking hold of her , and disregarding everything but her own purpose , in the agony of the moment . "
318824	318825	318818	318818	You	7832	" "
318834	318844	318826	318826	I	0	" said Glencora , trying to whisper her words , "
318852	318955	318847	318847	I	0	" The croupier again asked her if the money was to remain , and she again nodded her head . Everybody at the table was now looking at her . The women especially were staring at her,—those horrid women with vermilion cheeks , and loud bonnets half off their heads , and hard , shameless eyes , and white gloves , which , when taken off in the ardour of the game , disclosed dirty hands . They stared at her with that fixed stare which such women have , and Alice saw it all , and trembled . Again she won . "
318959	318963	318847	318847	I	0	" said Alice , "
318968	318969	318970	318970	I	0	" "
318976	318980	318970	318970	I	0	" said Glencora . "
318998	319223	318991	318991	I	0	" What she said was , of course , in English , and was probably understood by no one near her ; but it was easy to be seen that she was troubled , and , of course , those around her looked at her the more because of her trouble . Again that little question and answer went on between her and the croupier , and on this occasion the money was piled up on the compartment — a heap of gold which made envious the hearts of many who stood around there . Alice had now both her hands on the back of the chair , needing support . If the devil should persist , and increase that stock of gold again , she must go and seek for Mr. Palliser . She knew not what else to do . She understood nothing of the table , or of its laws ; but she supposed all those ministers of the game to be thieves , and believed that all villainous contrivances were within their capacity . She thought that they might go on adding to that heap so long as Lady Glencora would sit there , presuming that they might thus get her into their clutches . Of course , she did not sift her suspicions . Who does at such moments ? "
319233	319237	319239	319239	I	0	" she said , "
319243	319295	319239	319239	I	0	" At that moment the croupier raked it all up , and carried it all away ; but Alice did not see that this had been done . A hand had been placed on her shoulder , and as she turned round her face her eyes met those of Mr. Palliser . "
319301	319319	319239	319239	I	0	" said Glencora , laughing . And now she , turning round , also saw her husband . "
319329	319333	319320	319320	I	0	" said Alice . "
319341	319492	319336	319336	you	7833	" said Mr. Palliser . There was anger in his tone , and anger in his eye . He took his wife 's arm upon his own , and walked away quickly , while Alice followed them alone . He went off at once , down the front steps of the building , towards the hotel . What he said to his wife , Alice did not hear ; but her heart was swelling with the ill - usage to which she herself was subjected . Though she might have to go back alone to England , she would tell him that he was ill - treating her . She followed him on , up into their drawing - room , and there he stood with the door open in his hand for her , while Lady Glencora threw herself upon a sofa , and burst out into affected laughter . "
319500	319504	319336	319336	you	7833	" she said , "
319510	319511	319336	319336	you	7833	" "
319515	319520	319336	319336	you	7833	" said Mr. Palliser . "
319542	319551	319531	319531	I	0	" Whereupon he looked at her with scorn . "
319555	319559	319560	319560	you	485	" said Alice , "
319584	319585	319580	319580	you	485	" "
319596	319597	319586	319586	I	0	" "
319636	319637	319638	319638	Alice	337	" "
319642	319649	319640	319640	Alice	337	" said Glencora , jumping up , "
319674	319675	319666	319666	he	485	" "
319711	319712	319713	319713	You	0	" "
319719	319723	319713	319713	You	0	" said Glencora . "
319742	319743	319740	319740	Alice	337	" "
319754	319758	319759	319759	I	0	" he said . "
319767	319771	319759	319759	I	0	" she answered ; "
319782	319783	319759	319759	I	0	" "
319793	319797	319790	319791	Mr. Palliser	485	" said Alice , "
319820	320219	319818	319818	Glencora	488	" Then Alice took her candle , and marched off to her own room , with all the dignity of which she was mistress . The second week in July saw Mr. Palliser 's party , carriage and all , established at Lucerne , in Switzerland , safe beyond the reach of the German gambling tables . Alice Vavasor was still with them ; and the reader will therefore understand that that quarrel about Lady Glencora 's wickedness had been settled without any rupture . It had been settled amicably , and by the time that they had reached Lucerne , Alice was inclined to acknowledge that the whole thing was not worth notice ; but for many days her anger against Mr. Palliser had not been removed , and her intimacy with him had been much checked . It was now a month since the occurrence of that little scene in the salon at Baden , which was described in the last chapter,—since Mr. Palliser had marched off with his wife , leaving Alice to follow as she best could by herself . After that , as the reader may remember , he had almost told her that she was to be blamed because of his wife 's indiscretion ; and when she had declared her intention of leaving him , and making her way home to England by herself , he had answered her not at all , and had allowed her to go off to her own room under the full ban of his displeasure . Since that he had made no apology to her ; he had not , in so many words , acknowledged that he had wronged her ; but Alice had become aware that he intended to apologize by his conduct , and she had been content so far to indulge his obstinacy as to accept this conduct on his part in lieu of any outspoken petition for pardon . The acknowledgement of a mistake and the asking for grace is almost too much for any woman to expect from such a man as Mr. Palliser . Early on the morning after the scene in question , Lady Glencora had gone into Alice 's bedroom , and had found her cousin in her dressing - gown , packing up her things , or looking as though she intended to do so . "
320227	320231	320224	320225	a fool	2016	" she said , "
320241	320261	320224	320225	a fool	2016	" Alice assured her that , whether fool or not , she did think a great deal of it . "
320267	320271	320224	320225	a fool	2016	" said Alice , "
320321	320370	320312	320312	I	0	" All these positions Lady Glencora contradicted vigorously . Of course , Mr. Palliser had been wrong in walking out of the Assembly Rooms as he had done , leaving Alice behind him . So much Lady Glencora admitted . But this had come of his intense anxiety . "
320380	320383	320375	320376	a man	813	" said his wife—"how
320398	320409	320411	320411	Alice	337	"—"There is no reason why I should bear his unpleasantness , "
320413	320449	320411	320411	Alice	337	" Yes , there is,—great reason . You are to do it for the sake of friendship . And as for my not doing what you tell me , you know that 's not true . "
320450	320463	320375	320376	a man	813	" Did I not beg you to keep away from the table ? "
320464	320511	320512	320512	Alice	337	" Of course you did , and of course I was naughty ; but that was only once . Alice , I want you more than I ever wanted you before . I can not tell you more now , but you must stay with me . "
320682	320695	320696	320697	Lady Glencora	488	" Of course , he understands that it did n't mean anything , "
320701	320712	320696	320697	Lady Glencora	488	" He knows that I do n't want to gamble . "
320987	320996	320997	320997	Alice	337	" It is not that you trouble me , "
321001	321070	320997	320997	Alice	337	" but that you trouble yourself about that which is of no use . It is all done and over ; and though I know that I have behaved badly,—very badly,—yet I believe that everything has been done for the best . I am inclined to think that I can live alone , or perhaps with my cousin Kate , more happily than I could with any husband . "
321071	321077	321131	321131	she	488	" That is such nonsense . "
321078	321104	321131	321131	she	488	" Perhaps so ; but , at any rate , I mean to try . We Vavasors do n't seem to be good at marrying . "
321105	321123	321125	321126	Lady Glencora	488	" You want some one to break your heart for you ; that 's what you want , "
321952	321959	321927	321928	Mr. Palliser	485	" George has lost his election , "
322011	322021	322022	322022	she	337	" It was worth our while to try it , "
322035	322045	322022	322022	she	337	" I and Aunt Greenow are up in London , "
322053	322444	322022	322022	she	337	" and have just heard the news . Though I have been here for three days , and have twice sent word to him to say so , he has not been near me . Perhaps it is best that he should stay away , as I do not know how any words could pass between us that would be pleasant . The poll was finished this afternoon , and he lost his election by a large majority . There were five candidates altogether for the two seats — three Liberals , and two Conservatives . The other two Liberals were seated , and he was the last of the five . I continue to hear tidings about him from day to day,—or rather , my aunt hears them and tells them to me , which fill me full of fears as to his future career . I believe that he has abandoned his business , and that he has now no source of income . I would willingly share what I have with him ; or I would do more than that . After keeping back enough to repay you gradually what he owes you , I would give him all my share of the income out of the estate . But I can not do this while we are presumed to be enemies . I am up here to see a lawyer as to some steps which he is taking to upset grandpapa 's will . The lawyer says that it is all nonsense , and that George 's lawyer is not really in earnest ; but I can not do anything till the matter is settled . Dear Alice , though so much of your money is for a time gone , I am bound to congratulate you on your safety,—on what I may more truly call your escape . You will understand what my own feelings must be in writing this , after all that I did to bring you and him together,—after all my hopes and ambition respecting him . As for the money , it shall be repaid . I do not think I shall ever dare to indulge in any strong desire again . I think you will forgive me the injury I have done you;—and I know that you will pity me . "
322912	323058	323059	323059	She	7894	" Alice was always angered by any assumption that her conduct to Mr. Grey had been affected by the advice or influence of her cousin Kate . But this very feeling seemed to preserve Kate from the worse anger , which might have been aroused against her , had Alice acknowledged the injury which her cousin had in truth done to her . It was undoubtedly true that had Alice neither seen nor heard from Kate during the progress of John Grey 's courtship , John Grey would not have lost his wife . But against this truth Alice was always protesting within her own breast . She had been weak , foolish , irresolute,—and had finally acted with false judgement . So much she now admitted to herself . But she would not admit that any other woman had persuaded her to such weakness . "
323063	323074	323059	323059	She	7894	" Alice thought , as she put up her letter . "
323085	323217	323218	323218	Sophy	741	" Mr. Palliser , who had brought her the letter , was seated in the same balcony , and while Alice had been reading , had almost buried himself in newspapers which conveyed intelligence as to the general elections then in progress . He was now seated with a sheet of The Times in his hand , opened to its full extent,—for he had been too impatient to cut the paper,—and as he held it up in his hands before his eyes , was completely hidden beneath it . Five or six other open papers were around him , and he had not spoken a word since he had commenced his present occupation . Lady Glencora was standing on the other side of him , and she also had received letters . "
323228	323234	323218	323218	Sophy	741	" she said at last . "
323245	323408	323241	323241	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , speaking with something like disdain in his voice as to the possibility of anybody having stood with a chance of success against him in his own family borough . For a full appreciation of the advantages of a private seat in the House of Commons let us always go to those great Whig families who were mainly instrumental in carrying the Reform Bill . The house of Omnium had been very great on that occasion . It had given up much , and had retained for family use simply the single seat at Silverbridge . But that that seat should be seriously disputed hardly suggested itself as possible to the mind of any Palliser . The Pallisers and the other great Whig families have been right in this . They have kept in their hands , as rewards for their own services to the country , no more than the country is manifestly willing to give them . "
323416	323421	323411	323411	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
323440	323441	323432	323433	your cousin	1051	" "
323446	323450	323443	323443	I	0	" said Alice . "

323538	323551	323536	323536	dear	8889	" said Mr. Palliser , who himself knew nothing of such misfortunes . "
323601	323602	323589	323595	Another of my friends in the House	7903	" "
323608	323613	323614	323615	Mr. Bott	532	" asked Lady Glencora . "
323617	323623	323614	323615	Mr. Bott	532	" said the unthinking husband . "
323628	323633	323624	323625	Mr. Bott	532	" exclaimed Lady Glencora . "
323689	323710	323677	323677	he	7906	" A very indiscreet woman was poor Lady Glencora . Mr. Palliser 's face became black beneath The Times newspaper . "
323716	323720	323711	323711	I	0	" said he , "
323732	323733	323734	323734	Enemies	11356	" "
323744	323748	323736	323736	I	0	" said Glencora . "

323772	323780	323764	323764	He	7906	" said Alice , with great courage . "
323815	323816	323804	323804	I	0	" "
323821	323826	323819	323819	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora . "
323842	323849	323829	323829	he	7906	" began Mr. Palliser , apologetically . "
323875	323876	323859	323859	he	7906	" "
323884	323889	323879	323879	he	7906	" said Lady Glencora . "
323900	323904	323907	323907	he	7906	" said Alice . "
323910	323915	323907	323907	he	7906	" said Lady Glencora ; "
323943	323984	323917	323917	he	7906	" Mr. Palliser was effectually talked down , and felt himself constrained to abandon his political ally . Perhaps he did this the easier as the loss which Mr. Bott had just suffered would materially interfere with his political utility . "
323996	324001	323985	323985	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
324008	324011	323985	323985	I	0	" said Lady Glencora,—"and
324024	324176	323985	323985	I	0	" Then there was nothing more said about Mr. Bott . It was evening , and while they were still sitting among their letters and newspapers , there came a shout along the water , and the noise of many voices from the bridge . Suddenly , there shot down before them in the swift running stream the heads of many swimmers in the river , and with the swimmers came boats carrying their clothes . They went by almost like a glance of light upon the waters , so rapid was the course of the current . There was the shout of voices,—the quick passage of the boats,—the uprising , some half a dozen times , of the men 's hands above the surface ; and then they were gone down the river , out of sight,—like morsels of wood thrown into a cataract , which are borne away instantly . "
324187	324192	323985	323985	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
324200	324205	323985	323985	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
324216	324217	324211	324211	they	7921	" "
324226	324231	324220	324220	they	7921	" said Lady Glencora . "
324269	325342	324261	324261	I	0	" As no encouragement was given to this proposition , Lady Glencora did not repeat it ; but stood leaning on the rail of the balcony , and looking enviously down upon the water . Alice was , of course , thinking of that other evening , when perhaps the same swimmers had come down under the bridge and before the balcony , and where George Vavasor was sitting in her presence . It was , I think , on that evening , that she made up her mind to separate herself from Mr. Grey . On the day after that , Mr. Palliser and his party went on to Lucerne , making that journey , as I have said , by slow stages ; taking Schaffhausen and Zurich in their way . At Lucerne , they established themselves for some time , occupying nearly a dozen rooms in the great hotel which overlooks the lake . Here there came to them a visitor , of whose arrival I will speak in the next chapter . I am inclined to think that Mr. Palliser did not much enjoy this part of his tour abroad . When he first reached Lucerne there was no one there with whom he could associate pleasantly , nor had he any occupation capable of making his time run easily . He did not care for scenery . Close at his elbow was the finest to be had in Europe ; but it was nothing to him . Had he been simply journeying through Lucerne at the proper time of the year for such a journey , when the business of the Session was over , and a little change of air needed , he could have enjoyed the thing in a moderate way , looking about him , passing on , and knowing that it was good for him to be there at that moment . But he had none of that passion for mountains and lakes , none of that positive joy in the heather , which would have compensated many another man for the loss of all that Mr. Palliser was losing . His mind was ever at home in the House of Commons , or in that august assembly which men call the Cabinet , and of the meetings of which he read from week to week the simple records . Therein were mentioned the names of those heroes to whom Fortune had been so much kinder than she had been to him ; and he envied them . He took short , solitary walks , about the town , over the bridges , and along the rivers , making to himself the speeches which he would have made to full houses , had not his wife brought ruin upon all his hopes . And as he pictured to himself the glorious successes which probably never would have been his had he remained in London , so did he prophesy to himself an absolute and irremediable downfall from all political power as the result of his absence,—having , in truth , no sufficient cause for such despair . As yet , he was barely thirty , and had he been able to judge his own case as keenly as he could have judged the case of another , he would have known that a short absence might probably raise his value in the estimation of others rather than lower it . But his personal annoyance was too great to allow of his making such calculations aright . So he became fretful and unhappy ; and though he spoke no word of rebuke to his wife , though he never hinted that she had robbed him of his glories , he made her conscious by his manner that she had brought him to this miserable condition . Lady Glencora herself had a love for the mountains and lakes , but it was a love of that kind which requires to be stimulated by society , and which is keenest among cold chickens , picnic - pies , and the flying of champagne corks . When they first entered Switzerland she was very enthusiastic , and declared her intention of climbing up all the mountains , and going through all the passes . She endeavoured to induce her husband to promise that she should be taken up Mont Blanc . And I think she would have carried this on , and would have been taken up Mont Blanc , had Mr. Palliser 's aspirations been congenial . But they were not congenial , and Lady Glencora soon lost all her enthusiasm . By the time that they were settled at Lucerne she had voted the mountains to be bores , and had almost learned to hate the lake , which she declared always made her wet through when she got into a small boat , and sea - sick when she put her foot in a large one . At Lucerne they made no acquaintances , Mr. Palliser being a man not apt to new friendships . They did not even dine at the public table , though Lady Glencora had expressed a wish to do so . Mr. Palliser did not like it , and of course Lady Glencora gave way . There were , moreover , some marital passages which were not pleasant to a third person . They did not scold each other ; but Lady Glencora would make little speeches of which her husband disapproved . She would purposely irritate him by continuing her tone of badinage , and then Mr. Palliser would become fretful , and would look as though the cares of the world were too many for him . I can not , therefore , say that Alice had much to make the first period of her sojourn at Lucerne a period of enjoyment . But when they had been there about a fortnight , a stranger arrived , whose coming at any rate lent the grace of some excitement to their lives . Their custom was to breakfast at nine,—or as near nine as Lady Glencora could be induced to appear,—and then Mr. Palliser would read till three . At that hour he would walk forth by himself , after having handed the two ladies into their carriage , and they would be driven about for two hours . "
325350	325357	325344	325344	I	0	" Lady Glencora said one day . "
325393	325439	325377	325379	the Swiss people	7924	" There were moments , however , which seemed to indicate that Lady Glencora had something to tell her cousin , which , if told , would alter the monotony of their lives . Alice , however , would not press her for her secret . "
325454	325459	325450	325450	you	0	" Alice once said . "
325465	325470	325460	325460	You	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
325478	325482	325472	325472	you	0	" Alice replied ; "
325504	325604	325605	325605	I	0	" Then Lady Glencora said something savage , and the subject was dropped for a while . But we must go back to the stranger . Mr. Palliser had put the ladies into their carriage , and was standing between the front door of the hotel and the lake on a certain day , doubting whether he would walk up the hill to the left or turn into the town on the right , when he was accosted by an English gentleman , who , raising his hat , said that he believed that he spoke to Mr. Palliser . "
325610	325681	325605	325605	I	0	" said our friend , very courteously , returning the salute , and smiling as he spoke . But though he smiled , and though he was courteous , and though he raised his hat , there was something in his look and voice which would not have encouraged any ordinary stranger to persevere . Mr. Palliser was not a man with whom it was easy to open an acquaintance . "
325688	325771	325685	325686	John Grey	353	" said the stranger . Then the smile was dropped , the look of extreme courtesy disappeared , the tone of Mr. Palliser 's voice was altered , and he put out his hand . He knew enough of Mr. John Grey 's history to be aware that Mr. John Grey was a man with whom he might permit himself to become acquainted . After the interchange of a very few words , the two men started off for a walk together . "
325782	325787	325773	325773	you	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
325803	325893	325894	325894	Alice	337	" They went through the town , and up the river , and when Mr. Palliser , on his return , was seen by Alice and Lady Glencora , he was alone . They dined together , and nothing was said . Together they sauntered out in the evening , and together came in and drank their tea ; but still nothing was said . At last , Alice and her cousin took their candles from Mr. Palliser 's hands and left the sitting - room for the night . "
325896	325911	325894	325894	Alice	337	" said Lady Glencora , as soon as they were in the passage together , "
325968	326034	325951	325951	you	337	" Alice knew at once who it was . She knew , immediately , that Mr. Grey had followed her , though no word had been written to her or spoken to her on the subject since that day on which he himself had told her that they would meet abroad . But though she was quite sure , she did not mention his name . "
326041	326048	326039	326039	Glencora	488	" she asked , very calmly . "
326061	326065	326039	326039	Glencora	488	" said Glencora . "
326072	326076	326068	326068	Kate	356	" said Alice . "
326097	326118	326092	326092	you	337	" Alice was accustomed to Lady Glencora 's mode of talking , and therefore did not think much of this . "
326125	326129	326120	326120	I	0	" she said . "
326271	326272	326268	326268	you	337	" "
326279	326286	326275	326275	I	0	" said Alice , very calmly , "
326294	326295	326288	326290	Mr. John Grey	353	" "
326332	326353	326323	326323	he	353	" Then Lady Glencora paused for a moment , waiting that Alice might say something . But Alice said nothing . "
326356	326367	326323	326323	he	353	" said Lady Glencora , rising up from her chair . "
326370	326371	326323	326323	he	353	" "
326374	326378	326323	326323	he	353	" said Alice . "
326398	326399	326393	326394	Mr. Smith	745	" "
326454	326455	326446	326446	I	0	" "

326770	326787	326767	326767	you	337	" Then she left the room , but returned in a moment to ask another question . "
326813	326814	326804	326804	he	485	" "
326839	326840	326826	326826	I	0	" "
326851	326852	326826	326826	I	0	" "
326857	326858	326826	326826	I	0	" "
326899	327838	326889	326889	I	0	" It may be doubted whether Alice understood herself . As soon as her friend was gone , she put out her candle and seated herself at the open window of her room , looking out upon the moonlight as it played upon the lake . Would he be there , thinking of her , looking up , perhaps , as Glencora had hinted , to see if he could distinguish her light among the hundred that would be flickering across the long front of the house . If it were so , at any rate he should not see her , so she drew the curtain , and sat there watching the lake . It was a pity that he should have come , and yet she loved him dearly for coming . It was a pity that he should have come , as his coming could lead to no good result . Of this she assured herself over and over again , and yet she hardly knew why she was so sure of it . Glencora had called her hard ; but her conviction on that matter had not come from hardness . Now that she was alone , her heart was full of love , of the soft romance of love towards this man ; and yet she felt that she ought not to marry him , even though he might still be willing to take her . That he was still willing to take her , that he desired to have her for his wife in spite of all the injury she had done him , there could be no doubt . Why else had he followed her to Switzerland ? And she remembered , now at this moment , how he had told her at Cheltenham that he would never consider her to be lost to him , unless she should , in truth , become the wife of another man . Why , then , should it not be as he wished it ? She asked herself the question , and did not answer it ; but still she felt that it might not be so . She had no right to such happiness after the evil that she had done . She had been driven by a frenzy to do that which she herself could not pardon ; and having done it , she could not bring herself to accept the position which should have been the reward of good conduct . She could not analyse the causes which made her feel that she must still refuse the love that was proffered to her ; she could not clearly read her own thoughts ; but the causes were as I have said , and such was the true reading of her thoughts . Had she simply refused his hand after she had once accepted it,—had she refused it , and then again changed her mind , she could have brought herself to ask him to forgive her . But she had done so much more than this , and so much worse ! She had affianced herself to another man since she had belonged to him,—since she had been his , as his future wife . What must he not think of her , and what not suspect ? Then she remembered those interviews which she had had with her cousin since she had written to him , accepting his offer . When he had been with her in Queen Anne Street she had shrunk from all outward signs of a love which she did not feel . There had been no caress between them . She had not allowed him to touch her with his lips . But it was impossible that the nature of that mad engagement between her and her cousin George should ever be made known to Mr. Grey . She sat there wiping the tears from her eyes as she looked for his figure among the figures by the lake - side ; but , as she sat there , she promised herself no happiness from his coming . Oh ! reader , can you forgive her in that she had sinned against the softness of her feminine nature ? I think that she may be forgiven , in that she had never brought herself to think lightly of her own fault . If he were there , by the lake - side , she did not see him . I think we may say that John Grey was not a man to console himself in his love by looking up at his lady 's candle . He was one who was capable of doing as much as most men in the pursuit of his love,—as he proved to be the case when he followed Alice to Cheltenham , and again to London , and now again to Lucerne ; but I doubt whether a glimmer from her bedroom - window , had it been unmistakably her own glimmer , and not that of some ugly old French woman who might chance to sleep next to her , would have done him much good . He had come to Lucerne with a purpose , which purpose , if it might be possible , he meant to carry out ; but I think he was already in bed , being tired with long travel , before Lady Glencora had left Alice 's room . At breakfast the next morning nothing was said for a while about the new arrival . At last Mr. Palliser ventured to speak . "
327865	327916	327862	327862	I	0	" Alice , keeping her countenance as well as she was able , said Mr. Grey had been , and , indeed , was , a very dear friend of hers . Mr. Palliser knew the whole story , and what was the use of any little attempt at dissimulation ? "
327929	327936	327937	327937	Glencora	488	" she went on to say . "
327947	327999	327937	327937	Glencora	488	" said Mr. Palliser ; and then that matter was settled . But Mr. Grey did not wait till dinner - time to see Alice . Early in the morning his card was brought up , and Lady Glencora , as soon as she saw the name , immediately ran away . "
328006	328010	328001	328001	you	0	" said Alice . "
328016	328021	328012	328012	I	0	" said her ladyship . "
328036	328085	328086	328086	I	0	" So she went , whisking herself along the passages with a little run ; and Mr. Grey , as he was shown into her ladyship 's usual sitting - room , saw the skirt of her ladyship 's dress as she whisked herself off towards her husband . "
328093	328103	328104	328104	I	0	" he said , with his ordinary sweet smile . "
328118	328153	328104	328104	I	0	" He took her hand , and held it , pressing it warmly . She hardly knew with what words first to address him , or how to get her hand back from him . "
328165	328169	328161	328163	an old friend	11026	" she said ; "
328174	328175	328171	328171	I	0	" "
328180	328181	328176	328176	Well;—you	7966	" "
328199	328200	328184	328184	you	7964	" "
328261	328262	328259	328259	you	7964	" "
328265	328280	328259	328259	you	7964	" said she,—not finding at the moment any other word that she could say . "
328335	328336	328317	328317	they	7969	" "
328344	328362	328317	328317	they	7969	" she said , whispering the words as though she were unable to speak them out loud . "
328378	328379	328380	328380	I	0	" "
328389	328390	328380	328380	I	0	" "
328417	328418	328406	328406	your	0	" "
328453	328454	328442	328443	other men	1407	" "
328500	328501	328502	328502	They	1407	" "
328517	328518	328502	328502	They	1407	" "
328551	328552	328545	328545	men	856	" "
328617	328651	328600	328600	I	0	" These words she said , jerking out the different sentences almost in convulsions ; and when she had come to the end of them , the tears were streaming down her cheeks . "
328689	328727	328733	328733	I	0	" Soon after that she left him , not , however , till she had told him that she would meet him again at dinner , and had begged him to treat her simply as a friend . "
328743	328747	328748	328748	I	0	" she said . "
328753	328755	328748	328748	I	0	" he answered;—"the
328759	328855	328748	328748	I	0	" And then he left her . In the afternoon he again encountered Mr. Palliser , and having thought over the matter since his interview with Alice , he resolved to tell his whole story to his new acquaintance,—not in order that he might ask for counsel from him , for in this matter he wanted no man 's advice,—but that he might get some assistance . So the two men walked off together , up the banks of the clear - flowing Reuss , and Mr. Palliser felt the comfort of having a companion . "
328862	328867	328856	328856	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , "
328884	328885	328875	328875	I	0	" "
328894	328899	328886	328886	I	0	" said the lover . "
328957	329030	328949	328949	I	0	" So great had been the desolation of Mr. Palliser 's life since his banishment from London that he almost felt tempted to tell the story of his troubles to this absolute stranger . But he bethought himself of the blood of the Pallisers , and refrained . There are comforts which royalty may never enjoy , and luxuries in which such men as Plantagenet Palliser may not permit themselves to indulge . "
329044	329048	329036	329036	I	0	" said Grey . "
329190	329204	329205	329205	I	0	" Whereupon , Mr. Palliser promised that he would do what he could . "
329211	329720	329205	329205	I	0	" said Mr. Grey . Mr. Palliser said that he was sure she did , though what ground he had for such assurance I am quite unable to surmise . He was probably desirous of saying the most civil thing which occurred to him . The little dinner - party that evening was pleasant enough , and nothing more was said about love . Lady Glencora talked nonsense to Mr. Grey , and Mr. Palliser contradicted all the nonsense which his wife talked . But this was all done in such a way that the evening passed away pleasantly . It was tacitly admitted among them that Mr. Grey was to be allowed to come among them as a friend , and Lady Glencora managed to say one word to him aside , in which she promised to give him her most cordial cooperation . We must go back for a few pages to scenes which happened in London during this summer , so that the reader may understand Mr. Grey 's position when he reached Lucerne . He had undergone another quarrel with George Vavasor , and something of the circumstances of that quarrel must be told . It has been already said that George Vavasor lost his election for the Chelsea Districts , after all the money which he had spent,—money which he had been so ill able to spend , and on which he had laid his hands in a manner so disreputable ! He had received two thousand pounds from the bills which Alice had executed on his behalf,—or rather , had received the full value of three out of the four bills , and a part of the value of the fourth , on which he had been driven to raise what immediate money he had wanted by means of a Jew bill - discounter . One thousand pounds he had paid over at once into the hands of Mr. Scruby , his Parliamentary election agent , towards the expenses of his election ; and when the day of polling arrived had exactly in his hands the sum of five hundred pounds . Where he was to get more when this was gone he did not know . If he were successful,—if the enlightened constituents of the Chelsea Districts , contented with his efforts on behalf of the River Bank , should again send him to Parliament , he thought that he might still carry on the war . A sum of ready money he would have in hand ; and , as to his debts , he would be grandly indifferent to any consideration of them . Then there might be pickings in the way of a Member of Parliament of his calibre . Companies,—mercantile companies,—would be glad to have him as a director , paying him a guinea a day , or perhaps more , for his hour 's attendance . Railways in want of vice - chairmen might bid for his services ; and in the City he might turn that "
329722	329936	329205	329205	I	0	" which belonged to him to good account in various ways . With such a knowledge of the City world as he possessed , he thought that he could pick up a living in London , if only he could retain his seat in Parliament . But what was he to do if he could not retain it ? No sooner had Mr. Scruby got the thousand pounds into his clutches than he pressed for still more money . George Vavasor , with some show of justice on his side , pointed out to this all - devouring agent that the sum demanded had already been paid . This Mr. Scruby admitted , declaring that he was quite prepared to go on without any further immediate remittance , although by doing so might subject himself to considerable risk . But another five hundred pounds , paid at once , would add greatly to the safety of the seat ; whereas eight hundred judiciously thrown in at the present moment would make the thing quite secure . But Vavasor swore to himself that he would not part with another shilling . Never had he felt such love for money as he did for that five hundred pounds which he now held in his pocket . "
329942	329949	329205	329205	I	0	" he said to Mr. Scruby . "
329985	330029	329975	329975	I	0	" Mr. Scruby shrugged his shoulders , and said that he would do his best . But George Vavasor soon knew that the man was not doing his best,—that the man had , in truth , abandoned his cause . The landlord of the "
330032	330041	329975	329975	I	0	" jeered him when he went there canvassing . "
330047	330053	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" said the landlord of the "
330057	330058	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" "
330089	330801	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" George put his hand upon his purse , and acknowledged to himself that he had been afraid to come down with the stumpy . For the last five days of the affair George Vavasor knew that his chance was gone . Mr. Scruby 's face , manner , and words , told the result of the election as plainly as any subsequent figures could do . He would be absent when Vavasor called , or the clerk would say that he was absent . He would answer in very few words , constantly shrugging his shoulders . He would even go away and leave the anxious candidate while he was in the middle of some discussion as to his plans . It was easy to see that Mr. Scruby no longer regarded him as a successful man , and the day of the poll showed very plainly how right Mr. Scruby had been . George Vavasor was rejected , but he still had his five hundred pounds in his pocket . Of course he was subject to that mortification which a man feels when he reflects that some little additional outlay would have secured his object . Whether it might have been so , or not , who can say ? But there he was , with the gateway between the lamps barred against him , ex - Member of Parliament for the Chelsea Districts , with five hundred pounds in his pocket , and little or nothing else that he could call his own . What was he to do with himself ? After trying to make himself heard upon the hustings when he was rejected , and pledging himself to stand again at the next election , he went home to his lodgings in Cecil Street , and endeavoured to consider calmly his position in the world . He had lost his inheritance . He had abandoned one profession after another , and was now beyond the pale of another chance in that direction . His ambition had betrayed him , and there were no longer possible to him any hopes of political activity . He had estranged from himself every friend that he had ever possessed . He had driven from him with violence the devotion even of his sister . He had robbed the girl whom he intended to marry of her money , and had so insulted her that no feeling of amity between them was any longer possible . He had nothing now but himself and that five hundred pounds , which he still held in his pocket . What should he do with himself and his money ? He thought over it all with outer calmness for awhile , as he sat there in his arm - chair . From the moment in which he had first become convinced that the election would go against him , and that he was therefore ruined on all sides , he had resolved that he would be calm amidst his ruin . Sometimes he assumed a little smile , as though he were laughing at his own position . Mr. Bott 's day of rejection had come before his own , and he had written to Mr. Bott a drolling note of consolation and mock sympathy . He had shaken hands with Mr. Scruby , and had poked his fun at the agent , bidding him be sure to send in his little bill soon . To all who accosted him , he replied in a subrisive tone ; and he bantered Calder Jones , whose seat was quite sure , till Calder Jones began to have fears that were quite unnecessary . And now , as he sat himself down , intending to come to some final decision as to what he would do , he maintained the same calmness . He smiled in the same way , though there was no one there to see the smile . He laughed even audibly once or twice , as he vainly endeavoured to persuade himself that he was able to regard the world and all that belonged to it as a bubble . There came to him a moment in which he laughed out very audibly . "
330806	330833	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" he shouted , rising up from his chair , and he walked about the room , holding a large paper - knife in his hand . "
330838	330859	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" Then he threw the knife away from him , and thrusting his hands into his trousers - pockets , laughed again—"Ha
330863	330952	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" He stood still in the centre of the room , and the laughter was very plainly visible on his face , had there been anybody there to see it . But suddenly there was a change upon his face , as he stood there all alone , and his eyes became fierce , and the cicatrice that marred his countenance grew to be red and ghastly , and he grinned with his teeth , and he clenched his fists as he still held them within his pockets . "
330956	330962	330044	330045	Mr. Vavasor	357	" he said out loud . "
330971	331003	330964	330964	him	7994	" He had broken down in his calmness , when he thought of that old man who had opposed him during his life , and had ruined him at his death . "
331021	331215	330964	330964	him	7994	" His laughter was all gone , and his assumed tranquillity had deserted him . Walking across the room , he struck his foot against a chair ; upon this , he took the chair in his hands , and threw it across the room . But he hardly arrested the torrent of his maledictions as he did so . What good was it that he should lie to himself by that mock tranquillity , or that false laughter ? He lied to himself no longer , but uttered a song of despair that was true enough . What should he do ? Where should he go ? From what fountain should he attempt to draw such small draughts of the water of comfort as might support him at the present moment ? Unless a man have some such fountain to which he can turn , the burden of life can not be borne . For the moment , Vavasor tried to find such fountain in a bottle of brandy which stood near him . He half filled a tumbler , and then , dashing some water on it , swallowed it greedily . "
331222	331226	331227	331227	I	0	" he said , "
331239	331323	331227	331227	I	0	" But where was he to go ? to whom was he to turn himself ? He went to a high desk which stood in one corner of the room , and unlocking it , took out a revolving pistol , and for a while carried it about with him in his hand . He turned it up , and looked at it , and tried the lock , and snapped it without caps , to see that the barrel went round fairly . "
331332	331345	331227	331227	I	0	" he said , and then he turned the pistol down again ; "
331362	331438	331353	331353	I	0	" Then he poured out for himself more brandy - and - water , and having drunk it , he threw himself upon the sofa , and seemed to sleep . But he did not sleep , and by - and - by there came a slight single knock at the door , which he instantly answered . But he did not answer it in the usual way by bidding the comer to come in . "
331443	331477	331353	331353	I	0	" he said . Then the comer attempted to enter , turning the handle of the door . But the door had been locked , and the key was on Vavasor 's side . "
331482	331497	331353	331353	I	0	" he asked again , speaking out loudly , but in an angry voice . "
331502	331509	331353	331353	I	0	" said a woman 's voice . "
331512	331953	331954	331954	George	357	" said George Vavasor . The woman heard him , but she made no sign of having heard him . She simply remained standing where she was till something further should be done within . She knew the man well , and knew that she must bide his time . She was very patient,—and for the time was meek , though it might be that there would come an end to her meekness . Vavasor , when he had heard her voice , and knew who was there , had again thrown himself on the sofa . There flashed across his mind another thought or two as to his future career,—another idea about the pistol , which still lay upon the table . Why should he let the intruder in , and undergo the nuisance of a disagreeable interview , if the end of all things might come in time to save him from such trouble ? There he lay for ten minutes thinking , and then the low single knock was heard again . He jumped upon his feet , and his eyes were full of fire . He knew that it was useless to bid her go and leave him . She would sit there , if it were through the whole night . Should he open the door and strangle her , and pass out over her with the pistol in his hand , so that he might make that other reckoning which he desired to accomplish , and then never come back any more ? He took a turn through the room , and then walked gently up to the door , and undid the lock . He did not open the door , nor did he bid his visitor enter , but having made the way easy for her if she chose to come in , he walked back to the sofa and threw himself on it again . As he did so , he passed his hand across the table so as to bring the pistol near to himself at the place where he would be lying . She paused a moment after she had heard the sound of the key , and then she made her way into the room . He did not at first speak to her . She closed the door very gently , and then , looking around , came up to the foot of the sofa . She paused a moment , waiting for him to address her ; but as he said nothing , but lay there looking at her , she was the first to speak . "
331956	331960	331954	331954	George	357	" she said , "
331967	332514	332515	332515	George	357	" She was a woman of about thirty years of age , dressed poorly , in old garments , but still with decency , and with some attempt at feminine prettiness . There were flowers in the bonnet on her head , though the bonnet had that unmistakable look of age which is quite as distressing to bonnets as it is to women , and the flowers themselves were battered and faded . She had long black ringlets on each cheek , hanging down much below her face , and brought forward so as to hide in some degree the hollowness of her jaws . Her eyes had a peculiar brightness , but now they left on those who looked at her cursorily no special impression as to their colour . They had been blue,—that dark violet blue , which is so rare , but is sometimes so lovely . Her forehead was narrow , her mouth was small , and her lips were thin ; but her nose was perfect in its shape , and , by the delicacy of its modelling , had given a peculiar grace to her face in the days when things had gone well with her , when her cheeks had been full with youth and good living , and had been dimpled by the softness of love and mirth . There were no dimples there now , and all the softness which still remained was that softness which sorrow and continual melancholy give to suffering women . On her shoulders she wore a light shawl , which was fastened to her bosom with a large clasp brooch . Her faded dress was supported by a wide crinoline , but the under garment had lost all the grace of its ancient shape , and now told that woman 's tale of poverty and taste for dress which is to be read in the outward garb of so many of Eve 's daughters . The whole story was told so that those who ran might read it . When she had left her home this afternoon , she had struggled hard to dress herself so that something of the charm of apparel might be left to her ; but she had known of her own failure at every twist that she had given to her gown , and at every jerk with which she had settled her shawl . She had despaired at every push she had given to her old flowers , vainly striving to bring them back to their old forms ; but still she had persevered . With long tedious care she had mended the old gloves which would hardly hold her fingers . She had carefully hidden the rags of her sleeves . She had washed her little shrivelled collar , and had smoothed it out painfully . It had been a separate grief to her that she could find no cuffs to put round her wrists;—and yet she knew that no cuffs could have availed her anything . Nothing could avail her now . She expected nothing from her visit ; yet she had come forth anxiously , and would have waited there throughout the whole night had access to his room been debarred to her . "
332517	332529	332668	332668	I	0	" she said , standing at the bottom of the sofa , "
332536	332646	332668	332668	I	0	" As he lay there with his face turned towards her , the windows were at her back , and he could see her very plainly . He saw and appreciated the little struggles she had made to create by her appearance some reminiscence of her former self . He saw the shining coarseness of the long ringlets which had once been softer than silk . He saw the sixpenny brooch on her bosom where he had once placed a jewel , the price of which would now have been important to him . He saw it all , and lay there for a while , silently reading it .

333160	333217	333232	333232	I	0	" and he pointed to the door . Nevertheless , for more than three years of his life this woman had been his closest companion , his nearest friend , the being with whom he was most familiar . He had loved her according to his fashion of loving , and certainly she had loved him . "
333220	333229	333232	333232	I	0	" he said repeating the word very angrily . "

He stood looking at her , with his hands thrust deep into his pockets,—looking at her and thinking what he had better do to rid himself of her presence . If he even quite resolved to take that little final journey of which we have spoken , with the pistol in his hand , why should he not go and leave her there ? Or , for the matter of that , why should he not make her his heir to all remainder of his wealth ? What he still had left was sufficient to place her in a seventh heaven of the earth . He cared but little for her , and was at this moment angry with her ; but there was no one for whom he cared more , and no friend with whom he was less angry . But then his mind was not quite made up as to that final journey . Therefore he desired to rid himself and his room of the nuisance of her presence . "
333620	333638	333639	333639	you	354	" he said , looking at her again with that assumed tranquillity of which I have spoken , "

334412	334691	334406	334406	you	357	" Then she rose and went , and he let her leave the room without giving her a shilling ! His bantering tone , in speaking of his own position , had been successful . It had caused her to take herself off quietly . She knew enough of his usual manner to be aware that his threats of self destruction were probably unreal ; but , nevertheless , what he had said had created some feeling in her heart which had induced her to yield to him , and go away in peace . It was nearly seven o'clock in the evening,—a hot , July evening,—when the woman went from Vavasor 's room , and left him there alone . It was necessary that he should immediately do something . In the first place he must dine , unless he meant to carry out his threat , and shoot himself at once . But he had no such intention as that , although he stood for some minutes with the pistol in his hand . He was thinking then of shooting some one else . But he resolved that , if he did so at all , he would not do it on that evening , and he locked up the pistol again in the standing desk . After that , he took up some papers , referring to steam packets , which were lying on his table . They contained the programmes of different companies , and showed how one vessel went on one day to New York , and another on another day would take out a load of emigrants for New Zealand and Australia . "
334698	334709	334406	334406	you	357	" said he , as he read a certain prospectus . "
334730	334907	334908	334908	You	8026	" Then he dressed himself , putting on his boots and coat , and went out to his club for his dinner . London was still fairly full,—that is to say , the West End was not deserted , although Parliament had been broken up two months earlier than usual , in preparation for the new elections . Many men who had gone down into the country were now back again in town , and the dining - room at the club was crowded . Men came up to him condoling with him , telling him that he was well rid of a great nuisance , that the present Members for the Chelsea Districts would not sit long , or that there would be another general election in a year or two . To all these little speeches he made cheerful replies , and was declared by his acquaintance to bear his disappointment well . Calder Jones came to him and talked hunting talk , and Vavasor expressed his intention of being at Roebury in November . "
334915	335248	334908	334908	You	8026	" said Calder Jones . In answer to which Vavasor said that he thought he would join the club . He remained in the smoking - room till nearly eleven ; then he took himself home , and remained up half the night destroying papers . Every written document on which he could lay his hands he destroyed . All the pigeon - holes of his desk were emptied out , and their contents thrown into the flames . At first he looked at the papers before he burned them ; but the trouble of doing so soon tired him , and he condemned them all , as he came to them , without examination . Then he selected a considerable amount of his clothes , and packed up two portmanteaus , folding his coats with care , and inspecting his boots narrowly , so that he might see which , out of the large number before him , it might be best worth his while to take with him . When that was done , he took from his desk a bag of sovereigns , and , pouring them out upon the table , he counted them out into parcels of twenty - five each , and made them up carefully into rouleaus with paper . These , when complete , he divided among the two portmanteaus and a dressing - bag which he also packed and a travelling desk , which he filled with papers , pens , and the like . But he put into it no written document . He carefully looked through his linen , and anything that had been marked with more than his initials he rejected . Then he took out a bundle of printed cards , and furnished a card - case with them . On these cards was inscribed the name of Gregory Vance . When all was finished , he stood for awhile with his back to the fireplace contemplating his work . "
335252	335258	335259	335259	I	0	" he said to himself , "
335311	335372	335373	335373	He	0	" But still he liked the arrangements which he had made , and when he had looked at them for awhile he went to bed . He was up early the next morning , and had some coffee brought to him by the servant of the house , and as he drank it he had an interview with his landlady . "
335377	335379	335373	335373	He	0	" he said;—"going
335384	335472	335373	335373	He	0	" It might be possible that he would change his mind ; but as he would desire to start without delay , if he did go , he would pay her then what he owed her , and what would be due for her lodgings under a week 's notice . The woman stared , and curtseyed , and took her money . Vavasor , though he had lately been much pressed for money , had never been so foolish as to owe debts where he lived . "
335484	335488	335481	335482	Mrs. Bunsby	752	" he said , "
335503	335627	335490	335490	I	0	" Mrs. Bunsby said that she would , and then looked her last at him . After that interview she never saw him again . When he was left alone he put on a rough morning coat , and taking up the pistol , placed it carefully in his pocket , and sallied forth . It was manifest enough that he had some decided scheme in his head , for he turned quickly towards the West when he reached the Strand , went across Trafalgar Square to Pall Mall East , and then turned up Suffolk Street . Just as he reached the club - house at the corner he paused and looked back , facing first one way and then the other . "
335641	335762	335632	335632	I	0	" he said to himself . Then he laughed in his own silent way , shook his head slightly , and turning again quickly on his heel , walked up the street till he reached the house of Mr. Jones , the pugilistic tailor . The reader , no doubt , has forgotten all he ever knew of Mr. Jones , the pugilistic tailor . It can soon be told again . At Mr. Jones 's house John Grey lodged when he was in London , and he was in London at this moment . Vavasor rang the bell , and as soon as the servant came he went quickly into the house , and passed her in the passage . "
335769	335773	335774	335774	I	0	" he said . "
335781	335891	335774	335774	I	0	" The girl said that Mr. Grey was at home , but suggested that she had better announce the gentleman . But Vavasor was already halfway up the stairs , and before the girl had reached the first landing place , he had entered Mr. Grey 's room and closed the door behind him . Grey was sitting near the open window , in a dressing - gown , and was reading . The breakfast things were on the table , but he had not as yet breakfasted . As soon as he saw George Vavasor , he rose from his chair quickly , and put down his book . "
335895	335899	335892	335893	Mr. Vavasor	357	" he said , "
335911	335912	335905	335905	you	357	" "
335918	335922	335905	335905	you	357	" said Vavasor ; "
335931	335954	335928	335928	I	0	" He kept his right hand in the pocket which held the pistol , and held his left hand under his waistcoat . "
335963	335967	335956	335956	I	0	" said Grey . "
336018	336037	336038	336038	I	0	" As he said this he suited his action to his words , but without any serious result . "

336538	336549	336525	336525	you	357	" And he took the pistol out of his pocket . "
336561	336713	336715	336715	you	8052	" Grey asked . There were two windows in the room , and he had been sitting near to that which was furthest removed from the fireplace , and consequently furthest removed from the bell , and his visitor was now standing immediately between him and the door . He had to think what steps he might best take , and to act upon his decision instantly . He was by no means a timid man , and was one , moreover , very little prone to believe in extravagant action . He did not think , even now , that this disappointed , ruined man had come there with any intention of killing him . But he knew that a pistol in the hands of an angry man is dangerous , and that it behoved him to do his best to rid himself of the nuisance which now encumbered him . "
336725	336730	336715	336715	you	8052	" he had said . "
336753	336765	336742	336742	you	8052	" Upon hearing this , Grey turned himself towards the bell . "
336778	336795	336772	336772	I	0	" said Vavasor . Grey paused a moment , and looked him full in the face . "
336799	336804	336796	336796	I	0	" said Vavasor again . "
336810	336814	336796	336796	I	0	" said Grey . "
336827	336831	336819	336819	you	8052	" said Vavasor . "
336837	337141	336819	336819	you	8052	" Grey had stopped for a moment to fix his eyes on the other man 's face ; but it was only for a moment , and then he went on to the bell . He had seen that the pistol was pointed at himself , and had once thought of rushing across the room at his adversary , calculating that a shot fired at him as he did so might miss him , and that he would then have a fair chance of disarming the madman . But his chief object was to avoid any personal conflict , to escape the indignity of a scramble for the pistol,—and especially to escape the necessity of a consequent appearance at some police - office , where he would have to justify himself , and answer the questions of a lawyer hired to cross - question him . He made , therefore , towards the bell , trusting that Vavasor would not fire at him , but having some little thought also as to the danger of the moment . It might be that everything was over for him now,—that the fatal hour had come , and that eternity was close upon him . Something of the spirit of a prayer flashed across his mind as he moved . Then he heard the click of the pistol 's hammer as it fell , and was aware that his eyes were dazzled , though he was unconscious of seeing any flame . He felt something in the air , and knew that the pistol had been fired;—but he did not know whether the shot had struck him or had missed him . His hand was out for the bell - handle , and he had pulled it , before he was sure that he was unhurt . "
337144	337260	336819	336819	you	8052	" exclaimed the murderer . But he did not pull the trigger again . Though the weapon had of late been so often in his hands , he forgot , in the agitation of the moment , that his missing once was but of small matter if he chose to go on with his purpose . Were there not five other barrels for him , each making itself ready by the discharge of the other ? But he had paused , forgetting , in his excitement , the use of his weapon , and before he had bethought himself that the man was still in his power , he heard the sound of the bell . "
337263	337466	336819	336819	you	8052	" he exclaimed . Then he turned round , left the room , hurried down the stairs , and made his way out into the street , having again passed the girl on his way . Grey , when he perceived that his enemy was gone , turned round to look for the bullet or its mark . He soon found the little hole in the window - shutter , and probing it with the point of his pencil , came upon the morsel of lead which might now just as readily have been within his own brain . There he left it for the time , and then made some not inaccurate calculation as to the narrowness of his own escape . He had been standing directly between Vavasor and the shutter , and he found , from the height of the hole , that the shot must have passed close beneath his ear . He remembered to have heard the click of the hammer , but he could not remember the sound of the report , and when the girl entered the room , he perceived at once from her manner that she was unaware that firearms had been used . "
337474	337488	337468	337469	that gentleman	8912	" Grey asked . The girl said that he had left the house . "
337495	337497	337501	337501	you	8056	" said he;—"that
337516	337701	337506	337506	I	0	" Then he asked for Mr. Jones , his landlord , and in a few minutes the pugilistic tailor was with him . During those few minutes he had been called upon to resolve what he would do now . Would he put the police at once upon the track of the murderer , who was , as he remembered too well , the first cousin of the woman whom he still desired to make his wife ? That cross - examination which he would have to undergo at the police - office , and again probably in an assize court , in which all his relations with the Vavasor family would be made public , was very vivid to his imagination . That he was called upon by duty to do something he felt almost assured . The man who had been allowed to make such an attempt once with impunity , might probably make it again . But he resolved that he need not now say anything about the pistol to the pugilistic tailor , unless the tailor said something to him . "
337705	337709	337702	337703	Mr. Jones	459	" he said , "
337729	337730	337710	337722	that man whom I had to put out of the room once before	8057	" "
337739	337740	337737	337737	sir	9140	" "
337765	338025	338026	338026	she	8062	" Jones promised his aid , and offered to go at once to the police . To this , however , Mr. Grey demurred , saying that he should himself seek assistance from some magistrate . Jones promised to be very vigilant as to watching the door ; and then John Grey sat down to his breakfast . Of course he thought much of what had occurred . It was impossible that he should not think much of so narrow an escape . He had probably been as near death as a man may well be without receiving any injury ; and the more he thought of it , the more strongly he was convinced that he could not allow the thing to pass by without some notice , or some precaution as to the future . At eleven o'clock he went to Scotland Yard , and saw some officer great in power over policemen , and told him all the circumstances,—confidentially . The powerful officer recommended an equally confidential reference to a magistrate ; and towards evening a very confidential policeman in plain clothes paid a visit to Vavasor 's lodgings in Cecil Street . But Vavasor lodged there no longer . Mrs. Bunsby , who was also very confidential,—and at her wits ' end because she could not learn the special business of the stranger who called,—stated that Mr. George Vavasor left her house in a cab at ten o'clock that morning , having taken with him such luggage as he had packed , and having gone , "
338033	338216	338026	338026	she	8062	" as Mrs. Bunsby expressed it . He had gone for good , and at the moment in which the policeman was making the inquiry in Cecil Street , was leaning over the side of an American steamer which had just got up her steam and weighed her anchor in the Mersey . He was on board at six o'clock , and it was not till the next day that the cabman was traced who had carried him to Euston Square Station . Of course , it was soon known that he had gone to America , but it was not thought worth while to take any further steps towards arresting him . Mr. Grey himself was decidedly opposed to any such attempt , declaring his opinion that his own evidence would be insufficient to obtain a conviction . The big men in Scotland Yard were loth to let the matter drop . Their mouths watered after the job , and they had very numerous and very confidential interviews with John Grey . But it was decided that nothing should be done . "
338219	338235	338026	338026	she	8062	" said one enterprising superintendent , in answer to the condolings of a brother superintendent . "
338310	338493	338308	338308	Walker	415	" And that superintendent felt that his profession and his country were alike disgraced . And now George Vavasor vanishes from our pages , and will be heard of no more . Roebury knew him no longer , nor Pall Mall , nor the Chelsea Districts . His disappearance was a nine days ' wonder , but the world at large knew nothing of the circumstances of that attempt in Suffolk Street . Mr. Grey himself told the story to no one , till he told it to Mr. Palliser at Lucerne . Mr. Scruby complained bitterly of the way in which Vavasor had robbed him ; but I doubt whether Scruby , in truth , lost much by the transaction . To Kate , down in Westmoreland , no tidings came of her brother , and her sojourn in London with her aunt had nearly come to an end before she knew that he was gone . Even then the rumour reached her through Captain Bellfield , and she learned what few facts she knew from Mrs. Bunsby in Cecil Street . "
338499	338504	338507	338507	he	8069	" said Mrs. Greenow , "
338536	338665	338667	338667	he	8069	" Perhaps Kate was of the same opinion , but , if so , she kept it to herself . It was not till they had been for a day or two together at Lucerne that Mr. Grey told Mr. Palliser the story of George Vavasor 's visit to him in Suffolk Street . Having begun the history of his connection with Alice , he found himself obliged to go with it to the end , and as he described the way in which the man had vanished from the sight of all who had known him,—that he had in truth gone , so as no longer to be a cause of dread , he could not without dissimulation , keep back the story of that last scene . "
338673	338678	338667	338667	he	8069	" said Mr. Palliser . "
338685	338713	338667	338667	he	8069	" Mr. Palliser hesitated , not liking to say boldly that the first cousin of the lady who was now living with him ought to be hung . "
338721	338725	338667	338667	he	8069	" said Grey . "
338773	338774	338751	338751	He	8069	" "
338780	338885	338751	338751	He	8069	" said Grey . Mr. Palliser began to think that something ought to be done to make life more secure in the metropolis of the world . Had he not known Mr. Grey , or been accustomed to see the other man in Parliament , he would not have thought so much about it . But it was almost too much for him when he reflected that one man whom he now called his friend , had been nearly murdered in daylight , in the heart of his own part of London , by another man whom he had reckoned among his Parliamentary supporters . "
338894	338946	338947	338947	He	8072	" said Palliser , putting all the circumstances of the case together . In answer to this Mr. Grey said that he hoped the loss might eventually be his own ; but that he was bound to regard the money which had been taken as part of Miss Vavasor 's fortune . "
338962	338967	338947	338947	He	8072	" said Mr. Palliser . "
338985	339035	338978	338978	herself	337	" Then Mr. Grey apologized for Alice , explaining that her love for her cousin had come from her early years ; that the man himself was clever and capable of assuming pleasant ways , and that he had not been wholly bad till ruin had come upon him . "
339056	339103	339036	339036	He	8072	" said Grey . This was a statement which Mr. Palliser could not allow to pass without notice . Whereupon the two men got away from George Vavasor and their own individual interests , and went on seriously discussing the merits and demerits of public life . "
339111	339117	339036	339036	He	8072	" said Grey at last , "
339149	339233	339234	339235	Poor George	755	" They continued to live at Lucerne in this way for a fortnight . Mr. Grey , though he was not unfrequently alone with Alice , did not plead his suit in direct words ; but continued to live with her on terms of close and easy friendship . He had told her that her cousin had left England,—that he had gone to America immediately after his disappointment in regard to the seat in Parliament , and that he would probably not return . "
339237	339242	339243	339243	he	755	" Alice had said ; "
339253	339254	339243	339243	he	755	" "
339265	339302	339255	339255	He	755	" Grey had replied . After that , nothing more was said between them about George Vavasor . From Lady Glencora Alice did hear something ; but Lady Glencora herself had not heard the whole story . "
339312	339317	339307	339307	himself	755	" Lady Glencora said ; "
339368	339425	339356	339356	You	8680	" In answer to this Alice made her usual protest , and Lady Glencora , as was customary , told her that she was a fool . I am inclined to think that Mr. Grey knew what he was about . Lady Glencora once scolded him very vehemently for not bringing the affair to an end . "
339438	339442	339426	339426	We	8082	" she said ; "
339459	339476	339448	339448	you	8680	" Mr. Grey protested that he had no intention of going to Italy in either case . "
339503	339504	339490	339490	you	8680	" "
339512	339518	339490	339490	you	8680	" said Grey , laughing . "
339575	339576	339569	339569	she	8085	" "
339585	339586	339587	339587	I	0	" "
339640	340679	340680	340680	Alice	337	" But Lady Glencora was wrong . Alice would , no doubt , have submitted herself patiently to her lover 's rebukes , and would have confessed her own sins towards him with any amount of self - accusation that he might have required ; but she would not , on that account , have been more willing to obey him in that one point , as to which he now required present obedience . He understood that she must be taught to forgive herself for the evil she had done,—to forgive herself , at any rate in part,—before she could be induced to return to her old allegiance to him . Thus they went on together at Lucerne , passing quiet , idle days,—with some pretence of reading , with a considerable amount of letter - writing , with boat excursions and pony excursions,—till the pony excursions came to a sudden end by means of a violent edict , as to which , and the cause of it , a word or two must be said just now . During these days of the boats and the ponies , the carriage which Lady Glencora hated so vehemently was shut up in limbo , and things went very pleasantly with her . Mr. Palliser received political letters from England , which made his mouth water sadly , and was often very fidgety . Parliament was not now sitting , and the Government would , of course , remain intact till next February . Might it not be possible that when the rent came in the Cabinet , he might yet be present at the darning ? He was a constant man , and had once declared his intention of being absent for a year . He continued to speak to Grey of his coming travels , as though it was impossible that they should be over until after the next Easter . But he was sighing for Westminster , and regretting the blue books which were accumulating themselves at Matching;—till on a sudden , there came to him tidings which upset all his plans , which routed the ponies , which made everything impossible , which made the Alps impassable and the railways dangerous , which drove Burgo Fitzgerald out of Mr. Palliser 's head , and so confused him that he could no longer calculate the blunders of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer . All the Palliser world was about to be moved from its lowest depths , to the summits of its highest mountains . Lady Glencora had whispered into her husband 's ear that she thought it probable — ; she was n't sure;—she did n't know . And then she burst out into tears on his bosom as he sat by her on her bedside . He was beside himself when he left her , which he did with the primary intention of telegraphing to London for half a dozen leading physicians . He went out by the lake side , and walked there alone for ten minutes in a state of almost unconscious exaltation . He did not quite remember where he was , or what he was doing . The one thing in the world which he had lacked ; the one joy which he had wanted so much , and which is so common among men , was coming to him also . In a few minutes it was to him as though each hand already rested on the fair head of a little male Palliser , of whom one should rule in the halls at Gatherum , and the other be eloquent among the Commons of England . Hitherto,—for the last eight or nine months , since his first hopes had begun to fade,—he had been a man degraded in his own sight amidst all his honours . What good was all the world to him if he had nothing of his own to come after him ? We must give him his due , too , when we speak of this . He had not had wit enough to hide his grief from his wife ; his knowledge of women and of men in social life had not been sufficient to teach him how this should be done ; but he had wished to do it . He had never willingly rebuked her for his disappointment , either by a glance of his eye , or a tone of his voice ; and now he had already forgiven everything . Burgo Fitzgerald was a myth . Mrs. Marsham should never again come near her . Mr. Bott was , of course , a thing abolished;—he had not even had the sense to keep his seat in Parliament . Dandy and Flirt should feed on gilded corn , and there should be an artificial moon always ready in the ruins . If only those d––––able saddle - ponies of Lucerne had not come across his wife 's path ! He went at once into the yard and ordered that the ponies should be abolished;—sent away , one and all , to the furthest confines of the canton ; and then he himself inspected the cushions of the carriage . Were they dry ? As it was August in those days , and August in Lucerne is a warm month , it may be presumed that they were dry . He then remembered that he had promised to send Alice up to his wife , and he hurried back into the house . She was alone in the breakfast - room , waiting for him and for his wife . In these days , Mr. Grey would usually join them at dinner ; but he seldom saw them before eleven or twelve o'clock in the day . Then he would saunter in and join Mr. Palliser , and they would all be together till the evening . When the expectant father of embryo dukes entered the room , Alice perceived at once that some matter was astir . His manner was altogether changed , and he showed by his eye that he was eager and moved beyond his wo nt . "
340682	340686	340680	340680	Alice	337	" he said , "
340704	340728	340697	340697	She	488	" He had never called her Alice before , and as soon as the word was spoken , he remembered himself and blushed . "
340737	340741	340729	340729	She	488	" said Alice . "
340773	340774	340768	340768	you	0	" "
340783	340788	340775	340775	I	0	" said Alice rising . "
340800	340801	340797	340798	Miss Vavasor	337	" "
340821	340826	340828	340828	I	0	" He blushed again . "
340898	341216	340892	340892	she	488	" Upon this Alice left him , having had no moment of time to guess what had happened , or was about to happen ; and he was again alone , contemplating the future glories of his house . Had he a thought for his poor cousin Jeffrey , whose nose was now so terribly out of joint ? No , indeed . His thoughts were all of himself , and the good things that were coming to him,—of the new world of interest that was being opened for him . It would be better to him , this , than being Chancellor of the Exchequer . He would rather have it in store for him to be father of the next Duke of Omnium , than make half a dozen consecutive annual speeches in Parliament as to the ways and means , and expenditure of the British nation ! Could it be possible that this foreign tour had produced for him this good fortune ? If so , how luckily had things turned out ! He would remember even that ball at Lady Monk 's with gratitude . Perhaps a residence abroad would be best for Lady Glencora at this particular period of her life . If so , abroad she should certainly live . Before resolving , however , on anything permanently on this head , he thought that he might judiciously consult those six first - rate London physicians , whom , in the first moment of his excitement , he had been desirous of summoning to Lucerne . In the meantime Alice had gone up to the bedroom of the lady who was now to be the subject of so much anxious thought . When she entered the room , her friend was up and in her dressing - gown , lying on a sofa which stood at the foot of the bed . "
341229	341234	341221	341221	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
341244	341259	341241	341241	your	337	" Then Alice knelt beside her , and asked her if she were ill . "
341297	341298	341294	341294	he	8091	" "
341346	341347	341334	341334	He	8091	" "
341357	341376	341350	341350	Alice	337	" Then suddenly Alice did guess the secret , and whispered her guess into Lady Glencora 's ear . "
341383	341388	341377	341377	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
341422	341423	341424	341424	I	0	" "
341429	341440	341441	341441	I	0	" she said , some two or three hours afterwards . "
341484	341485	341476	341476	I	0	" "
341497	341501	341502	341502	He	8098	" said Alice . "
341583	341622	341570	341570	he	8098	" On that afternoon , as they were walking together , Mr. Palliser told the important secret to his new friend , Mr. Grey . He could not deny himself the pleasure of talking about this great event . "
341638	341643	341628	341628	you	8102	" Mr. Palliser said . "
341649	341653	341628	341628	you	8102	" said Grey . "
341669	341680	341628	341628	you	8102	" But this did not at all satisfy Mr. Palliser . "
341683	341687	341628	341628	you	8102	" said he . "
341781	341782	341783	341783	Men	856	" "
341792	341796	341797	341797	I	0	" said Grey . "
341856	341888	341850	341850	I	0	" Perhaps , Mr. Palliser was thinking of a certain time when his uncle the Duke had threatened him , and he had not given way to the Duke 's threats . "
341907	341908	341890	341890	I	0	" "
341918	341919	341890	341890	I	0	" "
341974	341975	341949	341949	I	0	" "
342008	342009	342018	342018	one	1066	" "
342037	342038	342018	342018	one	1066	" "
342042	342046	342018	342018	one	1066	" said Grey , "
342065	342066	342057	342058	the Popes	8118	" "
342081	342285	342073	342074	a man	813	" said Mr. Palliser . From all this it may be seen that Mr. Palliser and Mr. Grey had become very intimate . Had chance brought them together in London they might have met a score of times before Mr. Palliser would have thought of doing more than bowing to such an acquaintance . Mr. Grey might have spent weeks at Matching , without having achieved anything like intimacy with its noble owner . But things of that kind progress more quickly abroad than they do at home . The deck of an ocean steamer is perhaps the most prolific hotbed of the growth of sudden friendships ; but an hotel by the side of a Swiss lake does almost as well . For some time after this Lady Glencora 's conduct was frequently so indiscreet as to drive her husband almost to frenzy . On the very day after the news had been communicated to him , she proposed a picnic , and made the proposition not only in the presence of Alice , but in that of Mr. Grey also ! Mr. Palliser , on such an occasion , could not express all that he thought ; but he looked it . "
342295	342300	342293	342293	Plantagenet	484	" said his wife . "
342303	342305	342073	342074	a man	813	" said he;—"nothing
342310	342311	342073	342074	a man	813	" "
342323	342352	342314	342314	we	8121	" The chapel in question was Tell 's chapel — ever so far up the lake . A journey in a steam - boat would have been necessary . "
342355	342366	342314	342314	we	8121	" said he , shouting out his refusal at her . "
342371	342372	342314	342314	we	8121	" "
342381	342424	342373	342373	You	484	" said she;—as though he could have failed to be stirred by such a proposition at such a time . On another occasion she returned from an evening walk , showing on her face some sign of the exercise she had taken . "
342434	342438	342440	342440	you	488	" said he , "
342446	342563	342440	342440	you	488	" He wanted her to eat six or seven times a day ; and always told her that she was eating too much , remembering some ancient proverb about little and often . He watched her now as closely as Mrs. Marsham and Mr. Bott had watched her before ; and she always knew that he was doing so . She made the matter worse by continually proposing to do things which she knew he would not permit , in order that she might enjoy the fun of seeing his agony and amazement . But this , though it was fun to her at the moment , produced anything but fun , as its general result . "
342577	342581	342570	342570	I	0	" she said . "
342606	342607	342601	342601	he	8125	" "

342723	342727	342710	342710	I	0	" said Alice . "
342824	342843	342813	342813	he	8125	" Alice was making some very wise speech in answer to this , when Lady Glencora interrupted her . "
342858	343026	342844	342845	Mr. Grey	353	" Then Alice held her tongue . When the first consternation arising from the news had somewhat subsided,—say in a fortnight from the day in which Mr. Palliser was made so triumphant,—and when tidings had been duly sent to the Duke , and an answer from his Grace had come , arrangements were made for the return of the party to England . The Duke 's reply was very short : — My dear Plantagenet,—Give my kind love to Glencora . If it 's a boy , of course I will be one of the godfathers . The Prince , who is very kind , will perhaps oblige me by being the other . I should advise you to return as soon as convenient . Your affectionate uncle , Omnium . That was the letter ; and short as it was , it was probably the longest that Mr. Palliser had ever received from the Duke . There was great trouble about the mode of their return . "
343032	343036	342844	342845	Mr. Grey	353	" said Glencora . "
343052	343076	342844	342845	Mr. Grey	353	" Mr. Palliser looked at her with a countenance full of rebuke and sorrow . He was always so looking at her now . "
343116	343117	343118	343118	I	0	" "
343130	343137	343120	343120	I	0	" she said afterwards to Alice . "
343154	343267	343268	343268	I	0	" Mr. Palliser did at last consent to take the joint opinion of a Swiss doctor and an English one who was settled at Berne ; and who , on the occasion , was summoned to Lucerne . They suggested the railway ; and as letters arrived for Mr. Palliser,—medical letters,—in which the same opinion was broached , it was agreed , at last , that they should return by railway ; but they were to make various halts on the road , stopping at each halting - place for a day . The first was , of course , Basle , and from Basle they were to go on to Baden . "
343276	343281	343273	343273	Baden	264	" Lady Glencora said ; "
343294	343336	343337	343337	I	0	" These arrangements as to the return of Mr. Palliser 's party to London did not , of course , include Mr. Grey . They were generally discussed in Mr. Grey 's absence , and communicated to him by Mr. Palliser . "
343348	343353	343337	343337	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
343366	343370	343354	343354	I	0	" said Grey . "

343395	343400	343354	343354	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
343453	343522	343442	343442	I	0	" Mr. Palliser added , interrupting the warmth of his invitation , and reflecting that , under the present circumstances , perhaps , it might be improper to have any guests at Matching in December . But he had become very fond of Mr. Grey , and on this occasion , as he had done on some others , pressed him warmly to make an attempt at Parliament . "
343533	343552	343530	343530	you	8144	" said he , when Grey declared that he would not know where to look for a seat . "
343571	343572	343566	343566	he	357	" "

343608	343612	343613	343613	They	8148	" said Grey . "
343645	343856	343635	343635	I	0	" But Mr. Grey still declined . He was not a man prone to be talked out of his own way of life , and the very fact that George Vavasor had been in Parliament would of itself have gone far towards preventing any attempt on his part in that direction . Alice had also wanted him to go into public life , but he had put aside her request as though the thing were quite out of the question,—never giving a moment to its consideration . Had she asked him to settle himself and her in Central Africa , his manner and mode of refusal would have been the same . It was this immobility on his part,—this absolute want of any of the weakness of indecision , which had frightened her , and driven her away from him . He was partly aware of this ; but that which he had declined to do at her solicitation , he certainly would not do at the advice of any one else . So it was that he argued the matter with himself . Had he now allowed himself to be so counselled , with what terrible acknowledgements of his own faults must he not have presented himself before Alice ? "
343870	343875	343635	343635	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
343884	343888	343876	343876	I	0	" Grey answered . "
343940	343941	343942	343942	He	813	" "
343951	344089	343942	343942	He	813	" said Mr. Palliser , who was not ready enough to carry on the argument as he might have done had more time been given to him to consider it . He knew very well that he himself was working for others , and not for himself ; and he was aware , though he had not analysed his own convictions on the matter , that good men struggle as they do in order that others , besides themselves , may live honestly , and , if possible , die fearlessly . The recluse of Nethercoats had thought much more about all this than the rising star of the House of Commons ; but the philosophy of the rising star was the better philosophy of the two , though he was by far the less brilliant man . "
344110	344125	344090	344090	I	0	" continued Mr. Palliser , when he had been silent for a few minutes . "
344130	344134	344135	344135	I	0	" said Grey . "
344174	344775	344778	344778	you	8157	" But though he spoke with an assured tone , he was shaken , and almost regretted that he did not accept the aid which was offered to him . It is astonishing how strong a man may be to those around him,—how impregnable may be his exterior , while within he feels himself to be as weak as water , and as unstable as chaff . But the object which he had now in view was a renewal of his engagement with Alice , and he felt that he must obtain an answer from her before they left Lucerne . If she still persisted in refusing to give him her hand , it would not be consistent with his dignity as a man to continue his immediate pursuit of her any longer . In such case he must leave her , and see what future time might bring forth . He believed himself to be aware that he would never offer his love to another woman ; and if Alice were to remain single , he might try again , after the lapse of a year or two . But if he failed now,—then , for that year or two , he would see her no more . Having so resolved , and being averse to anything like a surprise , he asked her , as he left her one evening , whether she would walk with him on the following morning . That morning would be the morning of her last day at Lucerne ; and as she assented she knew well what was to come . She said nothing to Lady Glencora on the subject , but allowed the coming prospects of the Palliser family to form the sole subject of their conversation that night , as it had done on every night since the great news had become known . They were always together for an hour every evening before Alice was allowed to go to bed , and during this hour the anxieties of the future father and mother were always discussed till Alice Vavasor was almost tired of them . But she was patient with her friend , and on this special night she was patient as ever . But when she was released and was alone , she made a great endeavour to come to some fixed resolution as to what she would do on the morrow,—some resolution which should be absolutely resolute , and from which no eloquence on the part of any one should move her . But such resolutions are not easily reached , and Alice laboured through half the night almost in vain . She knew that she loved the man . She knew that he was as true to her as the sun is true to the earth . She knew that she would be , in all respects , safe in his hands . She knew that Lady Glencora would be delighted , and her father gratified . She knew that the countesses would open their arms to her,—though I doubt whether this knowledge was in itself very persuasive . She knew that by such a marriage she would gain all that women generally look to gain when they give themselves away . But , nevertheless , as far as she could decide at all , she decided against her lover . She had no right of her own to be taken back after the evil that she had done , and she did not choose to be taken back as an object of pity and forgiveness . "
344781	344799	344800	344800	I	0	" said her cousin , when she came in with her hat on , soon after breakfast . "

345118	345151	345152	345152	You	353	" This , and much more of the same kind , she bore before Mr. Grey came to take her , and she answered to it all as little as she could . "
345161	345166	345152	345152	You	353	" she said once . "
345177	345182	345169	345169	I	0	" Lady Glencora answered , "
345198	345235	345185	345185	he	353	" Directly upon that he came in , looking as though he had no business on hand more exciting than his ordinary morning 's tranquil employments . Alice at once got up to start with him . "
345247	345252	345237	345237	you	488	" said Lady Glencora . "
345261	345585	345586	345586	We	8164	" said Mr. Grey ; and then they went off . Those who know Lucerne,—and almost everybody now does know Lucerne,—will remember the big hotel which has been built close to the landing - pier of the steamers , and will remember also the church that stands upon a little hill or rising ground , to the left of you , as you come out of the inn upon the lake . The church is immediately over the lake , and round the church there is a burying - ground , and skirting the burying - ground there are cloisters , through the arches and apertures of which they who walk and sit there look down immediately upon the blue water , and across the water upon the frowning menaces of Mount Pilate . It is one of the prettiest spots in that land of beauty ; and its charm is to my feeling enhanced by the sepulchral monuments over which I walk , and by which I am surrounded , as I stand there . Up here , into these cloisters , Alice and John Grey went together . I doubt whether he had formed any purpose of doing so . She certainly would have gone without question in any direction that he might have led her . The distance from the inn up to the church - gate did not take them ten minutes , and when they were there their walk was over . But the place was solitary , and they were alone ; and it might be as well for Mr. Grey to speak what words he had to say there as elsewhere . They had often been together in those cloisters before , but on such occasions either Mr. Palliser or Lady Glencora had been with them . On their slow passage up the hill very little was spoken , and that little was of no moment . "
345596	345600	345586	345586	We	8164	" he said . "
345621	345644	345237	345237	you	488	" So they went in , and sat down on one of the embrasures that open from the cloisters over the lake . "
345649	345653	345237	345237	you	488	" said Alice . "
345665	345766	345656	345656	I	0	" She shuddered as she remembered that in that former year George Vavasor had been with her . As she thought of it all she hated herself . Over and over again she had told herself that she had so mismanaged the latter years of her life that it was impossible for her not to hate herself . No woman had a clearer idea of feminine constancy than she had , and no woman had sinned against that idea more deeply . He gave her time to think of all this as he sat there looking down upon the water . "
345776	345784	345769	345769	I	0	" were the first words he spoke . "

345950	346019	346020	346020	I	0	" Then he paused for a minute or two , not looking at her , but gazing still on the mountain opposite . She did not speak a word , but looked as he was looking . She knew that the request was coming , and had been thinking about it all night ; but now that it had come she did not know how to bear herself . "
346025	346032	346020	346020	I	0	" he went on to say , "

347274	347275	347266	347266	she	1155	" "
347297	347312	347292	347292	your	350	" He got up , and standing before her , looked down upon her . "
347437	347787	347788	347788	Alice	350	" Then he stopped his speech , and waited for a reply ; but Alice sat silent beneath his gaze , with her eyes turned upon the tombstones beneath her feet . Of course she had no choice but to yield . He , possessed of power and force infinitely greater than hers , had left her no alternative but to be happy . But there still clung to her what I fear we must call a perverseness of obstinacy , a desire to maintain the resolution she had made,—a wish that she might be allowed to undergo the punishment she had deserved . She was as a prisoner who would fain cling to his prison after pardon has reached him , because he is conscious that the pardon is undeserved . And it may be that there was still left within her bosom some remnant of that feeling of rebellion which his masterful spirit had ever produced in her . He was so imperious in his tranquillity , he argued his question of love with such a manifest preponderance of right on his side , that she had always felt that to yield to him would be to confess the omnipotence of his power . She knew now that she must yield to him,—that his power over her was omnipotent . She was pressed by him as in some countries the prisoner is pressed by the judge,—so pressed that she acknowledged to herself silently that any further antagonism to him was impossible . Nevertheless , the word which she had to speak still remained unspoken , and he stood over her , waiting for her answer . Then slowly he sat down beside her , and gradually he put his arm round her waist . She shrank from him , back against the stonework of the embrasure , but she could not shrink away from his grasp . She put up her hand to impede his , but his hand , like his character and his words , was full of power . It would not be impeded . "
347790	347803	347788	347788	Alice	350	" he said , as he pressed her close with his arm , "
347816	347817	347818	347818	You	0	" "
347822	347838	347818	347818	You	0	" she said , whispering to him , as she still shrank from his embrace . "
347847	347902	347818	347818	You	0	" Then he put his face over her and pressed his lips to hers . I wonder whether he was made happier when he knew that no other touch had profaned those lips since last he had pressed them ? Alice insisted on being left up in the churchyard , urging that she wanted to "
347908	348048	347818	347818	You	0	" but , in truth , fearing that she might not be able to carry herself well , if she were to walk down with her lover to the hotel . To this he made no objection , and , on reaching the inn , met Mr. Palliser in the hall . Mr. Palliser was already inspecting the arrangement of certain large trunks which had been brought down - stairs , and was preparing for their departure . He was going about the house , with a nervous solicitude to do something , and was flattering himself that he was of use . As he could not be Chancellor of the Exchequer , and as , by the nature of his disposition , some employment was necessary to him , he was looking to the cording of the boxes . "
348055	348085	348086	348086	I	0	" he said to Grey , hardly looking at him , as though time were too precious with him to allow of his turning his eyes upon his friend . "
348110	348118	348104	348104	you	8205	" To this proposition Mr. Grey assented . "
348124	348129	348104	348104	you	8205	" continued Mr. Palliser , "
348140	348252	348255	348255	she	8207	" Then , in a very few words , Mr. Grey told him what had been his own morning 's work . He hated secrets and secrecy , and as the Pallisers knew well what had brought him upon their track , it was , he thought , well that they should know that he had been successful . Mr. Palliser congratulated him very cordially , and then , running up - stairs for his gloves or his stick , or , more probably , that he might give his wife one other caution as to her care of herself , he told her also that Alice had yielded at last . "
348258	348263	348255	348255	she	8207	" said Lady Glencora . "
348272	348276	348264	348264	I	0	" said he . "
348289	348910	348280	348280	you	0	" said his wife . Then the caution was repeated , the mother of the future duke was kissed , and Mr. Palliser went off on his mission about the carriage , its cushions , and its springs . In the course of their walk Mr. Palliser suggested that , as things were settled so pleasantly , Mr. Grey might as well return with them to England , and to this suggestion Mr. Grey assented . Alice remained alone for nearly an hour , looking out upon the rough sides and gloomy top of Mount Pilate . No one disturbed her in the churchyard,—no steps were heard along the tombstones,—no voice sounded through the cloisters . She was left in perfect solitude to think of the past , and form her plans of the future . Was she happy , now that the manner of her life to come was thus settled for her ; that all further question as to the disposal of herself was taken out of her hands , and that her marriage with a man she loved was so firmly arranged that no further folly of her own could disarrange it ? She was happy , though she was slow to confess her happiness to herself . She was happy , and she was resolute in this,—that she would now do all she could to make him happy also . And there must now , she acknowledged , be an end to her pride,—to that pride which had hitherto taught her to think that she could more wisely follow her own guidance than that of any other who might claim to guide her . She knew now that she must follow his guidance . She had found her master , as we sometimes say , and laughed to herself with a little inward laughter as she confessed that it was so . She was from henceforth altogether in his hands . If he chose to tell her that they were to be married at Michaelmas , or at Christmas , or on Lady Day , they would , of course , be married accordingly . She had taken her fling at having her own will , and she and all her friends had seen what had come of it . She had assumed the command of the ship , and had thrown it upon the rocks , and she felt that she never ought to take the captain 's place again . It was well for her that he who was to be captain was one whom she respected as thoroughly as she loved him . She would write to her father at once,—to her father and Lady Macleod,—and would confess everything . She felt that she owed it to them that they should be told by herself that they had been right and that she had been wrong . Hitherto she had not mentioned to either of them the fact that Mr. Grey was with them in Switzerland . And , then , what must she do as to Lady Midlothian ? As to Lady Midlothian , she would do nothing . Lady Midlothian , of course , would triumph;—would jump upon her , as Lady Glencora had once expressed it , with very triumphant heels,—would try to patronize her , or , which would be almost worse , would make a parade of her forgiveness . But she would have nothing to do with Lady Midlothian , unless , indeed , Mr. Grey should order it . Then she laughed at herself again with that inward laughter , and , rising from her seat , proceeded to walk down the hill to the hotel . "
348915	348926	348280	348280	you	0	" said Lady Glencora , as Alice entered the room . "
348939	348943	348932	348932	you	8208	" said Alice . "
348958	348963	348954	348954	you	8209	" said the other . "

349402	349456	349397	349398	Mr. Bott	532	" They sat together the whole morning,—while Mr. Palliser was seeing to the springs and cushions,—and by degrees Alice began to enjoy her happiness . As she did so her friend enjoyed it with her , and at last they had something of the comfort and excitement which such an occasion should give . "
349511	350162	350163	350163	You	8220	" On the following morning they all started together , a first - class compartment having been taken for the Palliser family , and a second - class compartment close to them for the Palliser servants . Mr. Palliser , as he slowly handed his wife in , was a triumphant man ; as was also Mr. Grey , as he handed in his lady - love , though , in a manner , much less manifest . We may say that both the gentlemen had been very fortunate while at Lucerne . Mr. Palliser had come abroad with a feeling that all the world had been cut from under his feet . A great change was needed for his wife , and he had acknowledged at once that everything must be made to yield to that necessity . He certainly had his reward,—now in his triumphant return . Terrible troubles had afflicted him as he went , which seemed now to have dissipated themselves altogether . When he thought of Burgo Fitzgerald he remembered him only as a poor , unfortunate fellow , for whom he should be glad to do something , if the doing of anything were only in his power ; and he had in his pocket a letter which he had that morning received from the Duke of St. Bungay , marked private and confidential , which was in its nature very private and confidential , and in which he was told that Lord Brock and Mr. Finespun were totally at variance about French wines . Mr. Finespun wanted to do something , now in the recess,—to send some political agent over to France,—to which Lord Brock would not agree ; and no one knew what would be the consequence of this disagreement . Here might be another chance,—if only Mr. Palliser could give up his winter in Italy ! Mr. Palliser , as he took his place opposite his wife , was very triumphant . And Mr. Grey was triumphant , as he placed himself gently in his seat opposite to Alice . He seemed to assume no right , as he took that position apparently because it was the one which came naturally to his lot . No one would have been made aware that Alice was his own simply by seeing his arrangements for her comfort . He made no loud assertion as to his property and his rights , as some men do . He was quiet and subdued in his joy , but not the less was he triumphant . From the day on which Alice had accepted his first offer,—nay , from an earlier day than that ; from the day on which he had first resolved to make it , down to the present hour , he had never been stirred from his purpose . By every word that he had said , and by every act that he had done , he had shown himself to be unmoved by that episode in their joint lives , which Alice 's other friends had regarded as so fatal . When she first rejected him , he would not take his rejection . When she told him that she intended to marry her cousin , he silently declined to believe that such marriage would ever take place . He had never given her up for a day , and now the event proved that he had been right . Alice was happy , very happy ; but she was still disposed to regard her lover as Fate , and her happiness as an enforced necessity . They stopped a night at Basle , and again she stood upon the balcony . He was close to her as she stood there,—so close that , putting out her hand for his , she was able to take it and press it closely . "
350171	350175	350163	350163	You	8220	" he said . "
350180	350181	350163	350163	You	8220	" "
350186	350188	350163	350163	You	8220	" she said—"here
350234	350284	350229	350229	you	8222	" On the following morning they went on to Baden - Baden , and there they stopped for a couple of days . Lady Glencora had positively refused to stop a day at Basle , making so many objections to the place that her husband had at last yielded . "
350296	350303	350285	350285	I	0	" she said , with indignation ; "
350320	350371	350372	350372	I	0	" Mr. Palliser had been afraid to be imperious , and therefore , immediately on his arrival at one of the stations in Basle , he had posted across the town , in the heat and the dust , to look after the cushions and the springs at the other . "
350382	350444	350372	350372	I	0	" Lady Glencora said to her husband , as soon as they were alone together in their rooms at Baden . Mr. Palliser declared that he would grant her any particular favour,—only premising that he was not to be supposed to have thereby committed himself to any engagement under which his wife should have authority to take any exertion upon herself . "
350452	350457	350449	350450	a milkmaid	8224	" said Lady Glencora . "
350478	350609	350468	350468	You	8223	" But what was the favour ? If she would only ask for jewels,—though they were the Grand Duchess 's diamond eardrops , he would endeavour to get them for her . If she would have quaffed molten pearls , like Cleopatra , he would have procured the beverage,—having first fortified himself with a medical opinion as to the fitness of the drink for a lady in her condition . There was no expenditure that he would not willingly incur for her , nothing costly that he would grudge . But when she asked for a favour , he was always afraid of an imprudence . Very possibly she might want to drink beer in an open garden . And her request was , at last , of this nature : "
350623	350627	350612	350612	you	8228	" said she . "
350633	350640	350612	350612	you	8228	" said Mr. Palliser in dismay . "
350703	350866	350889	350889	somebody	1543	" Mr. Palliser was aware that all the world of Baden,—or rather the world of the strangers at Baden,—assembles itself in those salons . It may be also that he himself was curious to see how men looked when they lost their own money , or won that of others . He knew how a Minister looked when he lost or gained a tax . He was familiar with millions and tens of millions in a committee of the whole House . He knew the excitement of a near division upon the estimates . But he had never yet seen a poor man stake his last napoleon , and rake back from off the table a small hatful of gold . A little exercise after an early dinner was , he had been told , good for his wife ; and he agreed therefore that , on their second evening at Baden , they would all walk up and see the play . "
350875	350881	350868	350868	I	0	" said Glencora to Alice . "
350899	350908	350889	350889	somebody	1543	" said Alice , looking at Mr. Palliser . "
350915	350928	350909	350909	She	8234	" said Mr. Palliser , almost fearing the result of the experiment . "
350935	351111	350929	350929	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . They started together , Mr. Palliser with his wife , and Mr. Grey with Alice on his arm , and found all the tables at work . They at first walked through the different rooms , whispering to each other their comments on the people that they saw , and listening to the quick , low , monotonous words of the croupiers as they arranged and presided over the games . Each table was closely surrounded by its own crowd , made up of players , embryo players , and simple lookers - on , so that they could not see much as they walked . But this was not enough for Lady Glencora . She was anxious to know what these men and women were doing,—to see whether the croupiers wore horns on their heads and were devils indeed,—to behold the faces of those who were wretched and of those who were triumphant,—to know how the thing was done , and to learn something of that lesson in life . "
351119	351140	351141	351141	We	8235	" she said to her husband , arresting him at one corner of the table which had the greatest crowd . "
351152	351720	351141	351141	We	8235	" So he stood with her there , giving way to Alice , who went in front with his wife ; and in a minute or two an aperture was made , so that they could all see the marked cloth , and the money lying about , and the rakes on the table , and the croupier skilfully dealing his cards , and,—more interesting than all the rest , the faces of those who were playing . Grey looked on , over Alice 's shoulder , very attentively,—as did Palliser also,—but both of them kept their eyes upon the ministers of the work . Alice and Glencora did the same at first , but as they gained courage they glanced round upon the gamblers . It was a long table , having , of course , four corners , and at the corner appropriated by them they were partly opposite to the man who dealt the cards . The corner answering to theirs at the other end was the part of the table most removed from their sight , and that on which their eyes fell last . As Lady Glencora stood she could hardly see,—indeed , at first she could not see,—one or two who were congregated at this spot . Mr. Palliser , who was behind her , could not see them at all . But to Alice,—and to Mr. Grey , had he cared about it,—every face at the table was visible except the faces of those who were immediately close to them . Before long Alice 's attention was riveted on the action and countenance of one young man who sat at that other corner . He was leaning , at first listlessly , over the table , dressed in a velveteen jacket , and with his round - topped hat brought far over his eyes , so that she could not fully see his face . But she had hardly begun to observe him before he threw back his hat , and taking some pieces of gold from under his left hand , which lay upon the table , pushed three or four of them on to one of the divisions marked on the cloth . He seemed to show no care , as others did , as to the special spot which they should occupy . Many were very particular in this respect , placing their ventures on the lines , so as to share the fortunes of two compartments , or sometimes of four ; or they divided their coins , taking three or four numbers , selecting the numbers with almost grotesque attention to some imagined rule of their own . But this man let his gold go all together , and left it where his half - stretched rake deposited it by chance . Alice could not but look at his face . His eyes she could see were bloodshot , and his hair , when he pushed back his hat , was rough and dishevelled ; but still there was that in his face which no woman could see and not regard . It was a face which at once prepossessed her in his favour,—as it had always prepossessed all others . On this occasion he had won his money , and Alice saw him drag it in as lazily as he had pushed it out . "
351728	351733	351734	351734	He	8238	" said Lady Glencora . "
351762	351955	351754	351754	I	0	" Then she turned round to whisper something to her husband , and Alice 's eyes again fell on the face of the man at the other end of the table . After he had won his money , he had allowed the game to go on for a turn without any action on his part . The gold again went under his hand , and he lounged forward with his hat over his eyes . One of the croupiers had said a word , as though calling his attention to the game , but he had merely shaken his head . But when the fate of the next turn had been decided , he again roused himself , and on this occasion , as far as Alice could see , pushed his whole stock forward with the rake . There was a little mass of gold , and , from his manner of placing it , all might see that he left its position to chance . One piece had got beyond its boundary , and the croupier pushed it back with some half - expressed inquiry as to his correctness . "
351959	352173	351754	351754	I	0	" said a voice in English . Then Lady Glencora started and clutched Alice 's arm with her hand . Mr. Palliser was explaining to Mr. Grey , behind them , something about German finance as connected with gambling - tables , and did not hear the voice , or see his wife 's motion . I need hardly tell the reader that the gambler was Burgo Fitzgerald . But Lady Glencora said not a word,—not as yet . She looked forward very gently , but still with eager eyes , till she could just see the face she knew so well . His hat was now pushed back , and his countenance had lost its listlessness . He watched narrowly the face of the man as he told out the amount of the cards as they were dealt . He did not try to hide his anxiety , and when , after the telling of some six or seven cards , he heard a certain number named , and a certain colour called , he made some exclamation which even Glencora could not hear . And then another croupier put down , close to Burgo 's money , certain rolls of gold done up in paper , and also certain loose napoleons . "
352181	352186	352187	352187	He	8240	" said Lady Glencora . "
352192	352526	352527	352527	Alice	350	" said Alice , not at all knowing the cause of her cousin 's anxiety . Burgo had paused a moment , and then prepared to rake the money to him ; but as he did so , he changed his mind , and pushed it all back again,—now , on this occasion , being very careful to place it on its former spot . Both Alice and Glencora could see that a man at his elbow was dissuading him,—had even attempted to stop the arm which held the rake . But Burgo shook him off , speaking to him some word roughly , and then again he steadied the rolls upon their appointed place . The croupier who had paused for a moment now went on quickly with his cards , and in two minutes the fate of Burgo 's wealth was decided . It was all drawn back by the croupier 's unimpassioned rake , and the rolls of gold were restored to the tray from whence they had been taken . Burgo looked up and smiled at them all round the table . By this time most of those who stood around were looking at him . He was a man who gathered eyes upon him wherever he might be , or whatever he was doing ; and it had been clear that he was very intent upon his fortune , and on the last occasion the amount staked had been considerable . He knew that men and women were looking at him , and therefore he smiled faintly as he turned his eyes round the table . Then he got up , and , putting his hands in his trousers pockets , whistled as he walked away . His companion followed him , and laid a hand upon his shoulder ; but Burgo shook him off , and would not turn round . He shook him off , and walked on whistling , the length of the whole salon . "
352529	352534	352527	352527	Alice	350	" said Lady Glencora , "
352540	352563	352537	352538	Burgo Fitzgerald	427	" Mr. Palliser had gone so deep into that question of German finance that he had not at all noticed the gambler . "
352577	352746	352575	352575	Burgo	427	" said Lady Glencora . Many eyes were now watching him . Used as he was to the world and to misfortune , he was not successful in his attempt to bear his loss with a show of indifference . The motion of his head , the position of his hands , the tone of his whistling , all told the tale . Even the unimpassioned croupiers furtively cast an eye after him , and a very big Guard , in a cocked hat , and uniform , and sword , who hitherto had hardly been awake , seemed evidently to be interested by his movements . If there is to be a tragedy at these places,—and tragedies will sometimes occur,—it is always as well that the tragic scene should be as far removed as possible from the salons , in order that the public eye should not suffer . Lady Glencora and Alice had left their places , and had shrunk back , almost behind a pillar . "
352754	352758	352749	352749	he	8242	" Alice asked . "
352763	352767	352749	352749	he	8242	" said Glencora . "
352797	352872	352793	352793	I	0	" Burgo , conscious that he was the regarded of all eyes , turned round upon his heel and again walked the length of the salon . He knew well that he had not a franc left in his possession , but still he laughed and still he whistled . His companion , whoever he might be , had slunk away from him , not caring to share the notoriety which now attended him . "
352880	352898	352878	352878	Alice	350	" said Lady Glencora , with her eyes still fixed on him who had been her lover . "
352903	352941	352878	352878	Alice	350	" whispered Alice . Lady Glencora immediately ran up to her husband , and took him away from Mr. Grey . Rapidly she told her story,—with such rapidity that Mr. Palliser could hardly get in a word . "
352967	352968	352961	352961	You	485	" "
352974	353000	352969	352969	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . Lady Glencora , as she went on quickly , got hold of her husband 's hand , and caressed it . "
353006	353010	353001	353001	You	485	" said she . "
353097	353098	353086	353086	You	485	" "
353110	353111	353086	353086	You	485	" "
353139	353199	353202	353203	old Buffer	766	" She pushed him forward , and then retreating , put her arm within Mr. Grey 's , still keeping her eye upon her husband . Burgo , when he first got to the door leading out of the salon , had paused a moment , and , turning round , had encountered the big gendarme close to him . "
353210	353381	353202	353203	old Buffer	766	" said he , accosting the man in English . The big gendarme simply walked on through the door , and said nothing . Then Burgo also passed out , and Mr. Palliser quickly went after him . They were now in the large front salon , from whence the chief door of the building opened out upon the steps . Through this door Burgo went without pausing , and Mr. Palliser went after him . They both walked to the end of the row of buildings , and then Burgo , leaving the broad way , turned into a little path which led up through the trees to the hills . That hillside among the trees is a popular resort at Baden , during the day ; but now , at nine in the evening , it was deserted . Palliser did not press on the other man , but followed him , and did not accost Burgo till he had thrown himself on the grass beneath a tree . "
353393	353409	353390	353391	Mr. Fitzgerald	503	" said Mr. Palliser , as soon as he was close at Burgo 's feet . "
353422	353442	353415	353416	Mr. Palliser	485	" said Lady Glencora to Mr. Grey , as soon as the two men had disappeared from her sight . "
353451	353456	353448	353449	Mr. Palliser	485	" said Mr. Grey . "
353511	353525	353498	353498	he	8249	" Then they all went home , and soon separated for the night . "
353535	353542	353528	353528	I	0	" said Lady Glencora to Alice , "
353563	353580	353556	353557	Mr. Grey	353	" But Alice told nothing to Mr. Grey , nor did Mr. Grey ask any questions . "
353592	353649	353586	353587	Mr. Fitzgerald	503	" said Mr. Palliser , standing over Burgo as he lay upon the ground . They were now altogether beyond the gas - lights , and the evening was dark . Burgo , too , was lying with his face to the ground , expecting that the footsteps which he had heard would pass by him . "
353654	353683	353685	353685	I	0	" said he , turning round suddenly ; but still he was not at once able to recognize Mr. Palliser , whose voice was hardly known to him . "
353693	353698	353685	353685	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser , "
353720	353721	353718	353718	Palliser	485	" "
353725	353744	353722	353723	Plantagenet Palliser	484	" said Burgo , jumping up on to his legs and looking close into the other 's face . "
353765	353766	353760	353760	you	485	" "
353795	353796	353781	353781	I	0	" "

353848	353931	353839	353839	I	0	" Mr. Palliser , during the whole interview , felt that he could afford to be generous . He knew that he had no further cause for fear . He had no lingering dread of this poor creature who stood before him . All that feeling was over , though it was as yet hardly four months since he had been sent back by Mrs. Marsham to Lady Monk 's house to save his wife , if saving her were yet possible . "
353967	353968	353994	353994	they	8259	" "
353981	353982	353978	353979	Mr. Fitzgerald	503	" "
353985	353989	353994	353994	they	8259	" said Burgo . "
354007	354008	353994	353994	they	8259	" "

354054	354080	354047	354047	I	0	" I wonder whether Mr. Palliser considered himself to be better entitled to talk of his family than he had been some three or four weeks back—"As
354108	354216	354217	354217	I	0	" There was something pleasant in this , which made Burgo Fitzgerald laugh . Mr. Palliser , the husband of Lady Glencora M'Cluskie , and the heir of the Duke of Omnium happening to have money with him ! As if Mr. Palliser could not bring down showers of money in any quarter of the globe by simply holding up his hand . And then to talk of accommodating him,—Burgo Fitzgerald , as though it were simply a little matter of convenience,—as though Mr. Palliser would of course find the money at his bankers ' when he next examined his book ! Burgo could not but laugh . "
354231	354235	354217	354217	I	0	" said he ; "
354247	354248	354239	354239	you	503	" "
354256	354291	354239	354239	you	503	" said Mr. Palliser , who hardly knew how to put himself on a proper footing with his companion , so that he might offer to do something effectual for the man 's aid . "
354299	354303	354292	354292	I	0	" said Burgo . "

354374	354384	354352	354352	you	503	" said Mr. Palliser , trying a little joke . "
354407	354435	354398	354398	I	0	" They were now walking slowly together up towards the hills , and near to them they heard a step . Upon this , Burgo turned round . "
354442	354464	354465	354465	I	0	" said he . Mr. Palliser , who was somewhat short - sighted , said that he did not see him . "
354526	354527	354507	354507	they	8263	" "
354534	354539	354507	354507	they	8263	" said Mr. Palliser . "

354633	354674	354627	354627	I	0	" The stranger was now standing near to them,—almost so near that he might hear their words . Burgo , perceiving this , walked up to him , and , speaking in bad French , desired him to leave them . "
354687	354688	354682	354683	a friend	9375	" "
354694	354704	354691	354692	a friend	9375	" said the man , answering in bad English . "

354721	354725	354717	354717	he	9375	" said Burgo . "
354737	354800	354726	354726	You	0	" Then the gentleman from the hotel retreated down the hill , but Mr. Palliser , during the rest of the interview , frequently fancied that he heard the man 's footfall at no great distance . They continued to walk on up the hill very slowly , and it was some time before Mr. Palliser knew how to repeat his offer . "
354807	354812	354815	354815	she	488	" Burgo said again . "
354830	354857	354821	354821	she	488	" Mr. Palliser answered . Then they both walked on a few steps in silence , for neither of them knew how to address the other . "
354863	354870	354821	354821	she	488	" said Burgo , at last , "

355281	355362	355197	355197	I	0	" Mr. Palliser had not time to explain to his friend that the orders had been given , in a very peremptory way , by himself , as he was anxious to bring back the conversation to his own point . He wished to give some serviceable , and , if possible , permanent aid to the poor ne'er - do - well ; but he did not wish to talk more than could be helped about his own wife . "

355851	355905	355906	355906	Misther	770	" Mr. Palliser left him and went his way , feeling that he had no further eloquence at his command . He shook Burgo 's hand , and then walked quickly down the hill . As he did so he passed , or would have passed the man who had been dodging them . "
355910	355918	355908	355908	Misther	770	" said the man in a whisper . "
355926	355943	355921	355921	you	8282	" asked Mr. Palliser , in French . Then the man spoke in French , also . "
355957	355958	355951	355951	you	8282	" "
355967	355986	355951	355951	you	8282	" said Mr. Palliser , not quite knowing what he had better do or say under such circumstances . "
355997	356002	355988	355988	he	8282	" said the man . "
356029	356030	356033	356033	he	8282	" "

356061	356066	356055	356055	Fitzgerald	427	" said Mr. Palliser ; "
356072	356073	356070	356070	Fitzgerald	427	" "
356093	356094	356096	356096	he	8282	" "

356255	356396	356397	356397	He	8306	" exactly what they should be , the commissioner intended to explain ; and Mr. Palliser understood him although the words were not quite spoken . The interview was ended by Mr. Palliser taking the name of the hotel , and promising to call before Mr. Fitzgerald should be up in the morning — a purposed visit , which we need not regard as requiring any very early energy on Mr. Palliser 's part , when we remember Burgo 's own programme for the following day . Lady Glencora received her husband that night with infinite anxiety , and was by no means satisfied with what had been done . He described to her as accurately as he could the nature of his interview with Burgo , and he described to her also his other interview with the head commissioner . "
356403	356425	356400	356400	he	8306	" said Lady Glencora ; when she heard from her husband the man 's surmise that perhaps he might destroy himself . "
356447	356488	356442	356442	I	0	" Mr. Palliser tried to soothe her by telling her of his promised visit to the landlord ; and Lady Glencora , accepting this as something , strove to instigate her husband to some lavish expenditure on Burgo 's behalf . "
356501	356505	356442	356442	I	0	" said Glencora . "
356526	356672	356519	356519	he	8306	" The subject was one which Mr. Palliser found it very hard to discuss . He could not tell his wife that Fitzgerald ought to accept his bounty ; but he assured her that his money should be forthcoming , almost to any extent , if it could be made available . On the following morning he went down to the hotel , and saw the real landlord . He found him to be a reasonable , tranquil , and very good - natured man,—who was possessed by a not irrational desire that his customers ' bills should be paid ; but who seemed to be much less eager on the subject than are English landlords in general . His chief anxiety seemed to arise from the great difficulty of doing anything with the gentleman who was now lying in his bed up - stairs . "
356679	356684	356674	356674	he	8308	" Mr. Palliser asked . "
356690	356813	356814	356814	I	0	" and the landlord laughed . He had been very particular in the orders he had given . He had desired his cutlets to be dressed in a particular way,—with a great deal of cayenne pepper , and they had been so dressed . He had ordered a bottle of Sauterne ; but the landlord had thought , or the head - waiter acting for him had thought , that a bottle of ordinary wine of the country would do as well . The bottle of ordinary wine of the country had just that moment been sent up - stairs . Then Mr. Palliser sat down in the landlord 's little room , and had Burgo Fitzgerald 's bill brought to him . "
356823	356828	356814	356814	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
356835	356944	356814	356814	I	0	" said the landlord , with something like a sparkle in his eye . What was Mr. Palliser to do ? He did not know whether , in accordance with the rules of the world in which he lived , he ought to pay it , or ought to leave it ; and certainly the landlord could not tell him . Then he thought of his wife . He could not go back to his wife without having done something ; so , as a first measure , he paid the bill . The landlord 's eyes glittered , and he receipted it in the most becoming manner . "
356953	356960	356814	356814	I	0	Sauterne?"—but to this Mr. Palliser demurred . "
356971	356987	356814	356814	I	0	" Mr. Palliser thought that the landlord had better keep it himself for a while . "
356995	357121	357122	357122	You	8310	" suggested the landlord . Mr. Palliser acknowledged that there was a little difficulty . He knew that he must do something more . He could not simply pay the bill and go away . That would not satisfy his wife . He knew that he must do something more ; but how was he to do it ? So at last he let the landlord into his confidence . He did not tell the whole of Burgo 's past history . He did not tell that little episode in Burgo 's life which referred to Lady Glencora . But he did make the landlord understand that he was willing to administer money to Mr. Fitzgerald , if only it could only be administered judiciously . "
357151	357237	357122	357122	You	8310	" As to that the landlord was very confident . It was at last arranged , that the landlord was to tell Burgo that his bill did not signify at present , and that the use of the hotel was to be at Burgo 's command for the next three months . At the end of that time he was to have notice to quit . No money was to be advanced to him;—but the landlord , even in this respect , had a discretion . "
357255	357269	357243	357243	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . Then he went home and told his wife . "
357277	357439	357440	357440	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . Mr. Palliser said that the judicious landlord would manage that also ; and in that way Lady Glencora was appeased,—appeased , till something final could be done for the young man , on Mr. Palliser 's return home . Poor Burgo ! He must now be made to end his career as far as these pages are concerned . He soon found that something had been done for him at the hotel , and no doubt he must have made some guess near the truth . The discreet landlord told him nothing,—would tell him nothing ; but that his bill did not signify as yet . Burgo , thinking about it , resolved to write about it in an indignant strain to Mr. Palliser ; but the letter did not get itself written . When in England , Mr. Palliser saw Sir Cosmo Monk , and with many apologies , told him what he had done . "
357444	357452	357440	357440	I	0	" said Sir Cosmo , in anger . "
357469	358018	358019	358019	Your	8317	" The amount expended , was however repaid to Mr. Palliser , and an arrangement was made for remitting a weekly sum of fifteen pounds to Burgo , through a member of the diplomatic corps , as long as he should remain at a certain small German town which was indicated , and in which there was no public gambling - table . Lady Glencora expressed herself satisfied for the present ; but I must doubt whether poor Burgo lived long in comfort on the allowance made to him . Here we must say farewell to Burgo Fitzgerald . Mr. Palliser did not remain long in Baden after the payment of Burgo 's bill . Perhaps I shall not throw any undeserved discredit on his courage if I say that he was afraid to do so . What would he have said,—what would he have been able to say , if that young man had come to him demanding an explanation ? So he hurried away to Strasbourg the same day , much to his wife 's satisfaction . The journey home from thence was not marked by any incidents . Gradually Mr. Palliser became a little more lenient to his wife and slightly less oppressive in his caution . If he still inquired about the springs of the carriages , he did so in silence , and he ceased to enjoin the necessity of a day 's rest after each day 's journey . By the time that they reached Dover he had become so used to his wife 's condition that he made but little fluttering as she walked out of the boat by that narrow gangway which is so contrived as to make an arrival there a serious inconvenience to a lady , and a nuisance even to a man . He was somewhat staggered when a big man , in the middle of the night , insisted on opening the little basket which his wife carried , and was uncomfortable when obliged to stop her on the plank while he gave up the tickets which he thought had been already surrendered ; but he was becoming used to his position , and bore himself like a man . During their journey home Mr. Palliser had by no means kept his seat opposite to Lady Glencora with constancy . He had soon found that it was easier to talk to Mr. Grey than to his wife , and , consequently , the two ladies had been much together , as had also the two gentlemen . What the ladies discussed may be imagined . One was about to become a wife and the other a mother , and that was to be their fate after each had made up her mind that no such lot was to be hers . It may , however , be presumed that for every one word that Alice spoke Lady Glencora spoke ten . The two men , throughout these days of close intimacy , were intent upon politics . Mr. Palliser , who may be regarded as the fox who had lost his tail,—the tail being , in this instance , the comfort of domestic privacy,—was eager in recommending his new friend to cut off his tail also . "
358026	358030	358019	358019	Your	8317	" said he , "
358043	358044	358045	358045	Your	8317	" "
358052	358057	358045	358045	Your	8317	" said the other , "
358105	358106	358045	358045	Your	8317	" "
358122	358127	358045	358045	Your	8317	" said Mr. Palliser . "
358132	358137	358045	358045	Your	8317	" said Mr. Grey . "
358161	358162	358165	358165	you	8317	" "
358175	358336	358165	358165	you	8317	" We need not follow the argument any further . We all know its nature , and what between two such men would be said on both sides . We all know that neither of them would put the matter altogether in a true light . Men never can do so in words , let the light within themselves be ever so clear . I do not think that any man yet ever had such a gift of words as to make them a perfect exponent of all the wisdom within him . But the effect was partly that which the weaker man of the two desired,—the weaker in the gifts of nature , though art had in some respects made him stronger . Mr. Grey was shaken in his quiescent philosophy , and startled Alice,—startled her as much as he delighted her,—by a word or two he said as he walked with her in the courts of the Louvre . "
358343	358352	358165	358165	you	8317	" he said , speaking of French politics . "
358356	358374	358165	358165	you	8317	" said Alice , who had no love for the French mode of carrying on public affairs . "
358490	358491	358483	358483	I	0	" "
358502	358538	358483	358483	I	0	" said Alice , laughing . After this he dropped the subject for a while , as though he were ashamed of it , but in a very few minutes he returned to it manfully . "
358548	358624	358539	358540	Mr. Palliser	485	" Upon hearing this Alice said nothing . She was afraid to speak . After all that had passed she felt that it would not become her to show much outward joy on hearing such a proposition , so spoken by him , and yet she could say nothing without some sign of exultation in her voice . So she walked on without speaking , and was conscious that her fingers trembled on his arm . "
358632	358636	358627	358627	you	0	" he asked . "
358655	358656	358657	358659	No one else	8836	" "
358740	358741	358734	358734	He	485	" "
358755	358756	358749	358749	I	0	" "
358796	359002	359057	359057	you	353	" Then Alice was unable to hold her tongue longer , and spoke out her thoughts with more vehemence than discretion . No doubt he combated them with some amount of opposition . He seldom allowed out - spoken enthusiasm to pass by him without some amount of hostility . But he was not so perverse as to be driven from his new views by the fact that Alice approved them , and she , as she drew near home , was able to think that the only flaw in his character was in process of being cured . When they reached London they all separated . It was Mr. Palliser 's purpose to take his wife down to Matching with as little delay as possible . London was at this time nearly empty , and all the doings of the season were over . It was now the first week of August , and as Parliament had not been sitting for nearly two months , the town looked as it usually looks in September . Lady Glencora was to stay but one day in Park Lane , and it had been understood between her and Alice that they were not to see each other . "
359020	359025	359057	359057	you	353	" said Lady Glencora . "
359077	359078	359079	359079	I	0	" "
359088	359093	359079	359079	I	0	" said Mr. Grey . "
359128	359129	359132	359132	my	0	" "
359135	359153	359154	359154	Alice	350	" said Mr. Grey . But Alice said nothing . Then Mr. Palliser made his little speech . "
359156	359169	359132	359132	my	0	" he said , as he gave his hand to Miss Vavasor , "
359241	359438	359439	359439	I	0	" Lady Glencora thought that this was very pretty as coming from her husband , and so she told him on their way home . Alice insisted on going to Queen Anne Street in a cab by herself . Mr. Palliser had offered a carriage , and Mr. Grey , of course , offered himself as a protector ; but she would have neither the one nor the other . If he had gone with her he might by chance have met her father , and she was most anxious that she should not be encumbered by her lover 's presence when she first received her father 's congratulations . They had slept at Dover , and had come up by a mid - day train . When she reached Queen Anne Street , the house was desolate , and she might therefore have allowed Mr. Grey to attend her . But she found a letter waiting for her which made her for the moment forget both him and her father . Lady Macleod , at Cheltenham , was very ill , and wished to see her niece , as she said , before she died . "
359445	359452	359442	359442	your	8332	" said the kind old woman , "
359497	359513	359485	359485	she	10043	" The letter then went on to beg Alice to come to Cheltenham at once . "
359523	359528	359530	359530	you	8332	" said Lady Macleod , "
359626	359652	359617	359617	I	0	" There was another letter for her from Kate , full , of course , of congratulations , and promising to be at the wedding ; "
359656	359660	359617	359617	I	0	" said Kate , "
359677	359703	359704	359704	You	8680	" and telling her that aunt Greenow was to be married in a fortnight;—telling her of this , and begging her to attend that wedding . "
359711	359715	359704	359704	You	8680	" said Kate . "
359804	359961	359785	359785	I	0	" Alice began to think that her hands were almost too full . If she herself were to be married in September , even by the end of September , her hands were very full indeed . Yet she did not know how to refuse any of the requests made to her . As to Lady Macleod , her visit to her was a duty which must of course be performed at once . She would stay but one day in London , and then go down to Cheltenham . Having resolved upon this she at once wrote to her aunt to that effect . As to that other affair down in Westmoreland , she sighed as she thought of it , but she feared that she must go there also . Kate had suffered too much on her behalf to allow of her feeling indifferent to such a request . Then her father came in . "
359974	359986	359785	359785	I	0	" said he , beginning with an apology for his absence . "
359994	360017	359989	359989	I	0	" Alice scorned to remind him that she herself had named the precise hour of the train by which they had arrived . "
360025	360029	360023	360023	papa	8677	" said she . "
360064	360065	360052	360052	I	0	" "
360104	360105	360099	360100	Mr. Grey	353	" "

360218	360265	360208	360208	papa	8677	" As the reader is aware , Alice had heard nothing special about this money . She only knew , or supposed she knew , that she had given three thousand pounds to her cousin . But now her father explained to her the whole transaction . "
360278	360282	360266	360266	We	8355	" said he ; "
360299	360335	360284	360284	Grey	353	" Alice was unable to say anything on this subject to her father , but to herself she did declare that not in that way or with that hope had John Grey produced his money . "
360343	360347	360341	360341	papa	8677	" she said . "
360350	360354	360341	360341	papa	8677	" he answered ; "
360408	360430	360395	360395	you	8360	" Alice in a penitential tone expressed her sorrow , and then he too assured her that he had forgiven her . "
360437	360441	360395	360395	you	8360	" he said , "
360458	360489	360395	360395	you	8360	" After that he went back to his club . Alice made her journey down to Cheltenham without any adventure , and was received by Lady Macleod with open arms . "
360500	360501	360498	360498	you	8360	" "
360504	360508	360510	360510	I	0	" said Alice , "

360775	360870	360871	360871	I	0	" said Alice . There was something said then as to the necessity of looking for pardon beyond this world , which I need not here repeat . To all her old friend 's little sermons Alice was infinitely more attentive than had been her wo nt , so that Lady Macleod was comforted and took heart of grace , and at last brought forth from under her pillow a letter from the Countess of Midlothian , which she had received a day or two since , and which bore upon Alice 's case . "
360883	360888	360877	360877	I	0	" said Lady Macleod , "
360938	361228	360936	360936	Alice	362	" But here Alice became impatient for the letter . Her aunt handed it to her , and she read as follows : — Castle Reekie , July , 186––. Dear Lady Macleod , — I am sorry to hear of the symptoms you speak about . I strongly advise you to depend chiefly on beef - tea . They should be very careful to send it up quite free from grease , and it should not be too strong of the meat . There should be no vegetables in it . Not soup , you know , but beef - tea . If any thing acts upon your strength , that will . I need not tell one who has lived as you have done where to look for that other strength which alone can support you at such a time as this . I would go to you if I thought that my presence would be any comfort to you , but I know how sensitive you are , and the shock might be too much for you . If you see Alice Vavasor on her return to England , as you probably will , pray tell her from me that I give her my warmest congratulations , and that I am heartily glad that matters are arranged . I think she treated my attempts to heal the wound in a manner that they did not deserve ; but all that shall be forgiven , as shall also her original bad behaviour to poor Mr. Grey . Alice was becoming weary of so much forgiveness , and told herself , as she was reading the letter , that that of Lady Midlothian was at any rate unnecessary . "
361240	361245	361246	361246	I	0	" continued Lady Midlothian . "
361316	361317	361318	361318	I	0	" "
361335	361352	361326	361326	I	0	" exclaimed Alice , who was unable to repress the anger occasioned by the last paragraph . "
361363	361364	361365	361366	Mr. Palliser	485	" "
361386	361522	361523	361523	I	0	" Poor Lady Macleod could not argue the matter in her present state . She merely sighed , and moved her shrivelled old hand up and down upon the counterpane . Alice finished the letter without further remarks . It merely went on to say how happy the writer would be to know something of her cousin as Mrs. Grey , as also to know something of Mr. Grey , and then gave a general invitation to both Mr. and Mrs. Grey , asking them to come to Castle Reekie whenever they might be able . The Marchioness , with whom Lady Midlothian was staying , had expressly desired her to give this message . Alice , however , could not but observe that Lady Midlothian 's invitation applied only to another person 's house . "
361530	361534	361523	361523	I	0	" said Alice . "
361539	361544	361536	361536	she	8384	" said Lady Macleod , "
361581	361815	361571	361571	You	0	" Alice remained a week with her aunt , and went from thence direct to Westmoreland . Some order as to bridal preparations we must presume she gave on that single day which she passed in London . Much advice she had received on this head from Lady Glencora , and no inconsiderable amount of assistance was to be rendered to her at Matching during the fortnight she would remain there before her marriage . Something also , let us hope , she might do at Cheltenham . Something no doubt she did do . Something also might probably be achieved among the wilds in Westmoreland , but that something would necessarily be of a nature not requiring fashionable tradespeople . While at Cheltenham , she determined that she would not again return to London before her marriage . This resolve was caused by a very urgent letter from Mr. Grey , and by another , almost equally urgent , from Lady Glencora . If the marriage did not take place in September she would not be present at it . The gods of the world,—of Lady Glencora 's world,—had met together and come to a great decision . Lady Glencora was to be removed in October to Gatherum Castle , and remain there till the following spring , so that the heir might , in truth , be born in the purple . "

361852	361878	361838	361839	the Duke	2896	" An invitation for the ceremony at Matching had been sent from Mr. Palliser to Mr. Vavasor , and another from Lady Glencora to Kate , "
361885	361890	361838	361839	the Duke	2896	" said her ladyship , "
361916	362316	361910	361910	she	8390	" It must be acknowledged that Mrs. Greenow was a woman of great resources , and that she would be very prudent for others , though I fear the verdict of those who know her must go against her in regard to prudence in herself . Her marriage with Captain Bellfield was a rash act,—certainly a rash act , although she did take so much care in securing the payment of her own income into her own hands ; but the manner in which she made him live discreetly for some months previous to his marriage , the tact with which she renewed the friendship which had existed between him and Mr. Cheesacre , and the skill she used in at last providing Mr. Cheesacre with a wife , oblige us all to admit that , as a general , she had great powers . When Alice reached Vavasor Hall she found Charlie Fairstairs established there on a long visit . Charlie and Kate were to be the two bridesmaids , and , as Kate told her cousin in their first confidential intercourse on the evening of Alice 's arrival , there were already great hopes in the household that the master of Oileymead might be brought to surrender . It was true that Charlie had not a shilling , and that Mr. Cheesacre had set his heart on marrying an heiress . It was true that Miss Fairstairs had always stood low in the gentleman 's estimation , as being connected with people who were as much without rank and fashion as they were without money , and that the gentleman loved rank and fashion dearly . It was true that Charlie was no beauty , and that Cheesacre had an eye for feminine charms . It was true that he had despised Charlie , and had spoken his contempt openly;—that he had seen the girl on the sands at Yarmouth every summer for the last ten years , and about the streets of Norwich every winter , and had learned to regard her as a thing poor and despicable , because she was common in his eyes . It is thus that the Cheesacres judge of people . But in spite of all these difficulties Mrs. Greenow had taken up poor Charlie 's case , and Kate Vavasor expressed a strong opinion that her aunt would win . "
362325	362329	362319	362319	she	8391	" Alice asked . "
362413	362414	362407	362407	he	8761	" "
362431	362432	362429	362429	her	8391	" "
362536	362595	362512	362512	She	8391	" Mr. Cheesacre and Captain Bellfield were at this time living in lodgings together , at Penrith , but came over and spent every other day at Vavasor , returning always to their lodgings in the evening . It wanted but eight days to the marriage when Alice arrived , and preparations for that event were in progress . "
362605	362610	362603	362603	Alice	350	" said her aunt ; "
362690	362719	362653	362653	he	8761	" She took Alice up to see her trousseau , and gave the other expectant bride some little hints which , under present circumstances , might be useful . "
362753	362773	362742	362742	You	0	" Alice did feel them , and wondered whether her aunt could have saved the half - crown honestly . "
362889	362934	362935	362935	He	8407	" Saying this , Mrs. Greenow folded up , among her present bridal belongings , sundries of the wealth which had accrued to her in an earlier stage of her career . And then Mrs. Greenow opened her mind to Alice about the Captain . "
362989	363045	363046	363046	Bellfield	393	" As this remembrance came upon Mrs. Greenow she put her handkerchief to her eyes , and Alice observed that that which she held still bore the deepest hem of widowhood . They would be used , no doubt , till the last day , and then put by in lavender for future possible occasions . "

363385	363625	363626	363626	I	0	" Alice knew the story of Charlie Fairstairs and her hopes ; knew of the quarrels between Bellfield and Cheesacre ; knew almost as much of Bellfield 's past life as Mrs. Greenow did herself ; and Mrs. Greenow was no doubt aware that such was the case . Nevertheless , she had a pleasure in telling her own story , and told it as though she believed every word that she spoke . On the following day the two gentlemen came over , according to custom , and Alice observed that Miss Fairstairs hardly spoke to Mr. Cheesacre . Indeed her manner of avoiding that gentleman was so very marked , that it was impossible not to observe it . They drank tea out of doors , and when Mr. Cheesacre on one occasion sauntered across towards the end of the bench on which Charlie was sitting , Charlie got up and walked away . And in strolling about the place afterwards , and in going up through the wood , she was at great pains to attach herself to some other person , so that there should be no such attaching between her and the owner of Oileymead . At one time Mr. Cheesacre did get close up to her and spoke some word , some very indifferent word . He knew that he was being cut and he wanted to avoid the appearance of a scene . "
363633	363657	363626	363626	I	0	" said Charlie , again moving away with excellent dignity , and she at once attached herself to Alice who was close by . "
363668	363672	363660	363660	you	8430	" said Charlie . "
363689	363824	363825	363825	I	0	" Mr. Cheesacre had heard that Alice was the dear friend of a lady who would probably some day become a duchess . He therefore naturally held her in awe , and slunk away . On this occasion Mrs. Greenow clung lovingly to her future husband , and the effect was that Mr. Cheesacre found himself to be very much alone and unhappy . He had generally enjoyed these days at Vavasor Hall , having found himself , or fancied himself , to be the dominant spirit there . That Mrs. Greenow was always in truth the dominant spirit I need hardly say ; but she knew how to make a companion happy , and well also how to make him wretched . On the whole of this day poor Cheesacre was very wretched . "
363836	363853	363829	363829	I	0	" he said to Bellfield , as he drove the gig back to Penrith that evening . "
363862	363866	363860	363860	Cheesy	497	" said Bellfield ; "

364060	364122	364123	364123	You	0	" said Mrs. Greenow that night to Charlie Fairstairs . The widow was now on terms almost more confidential with Miss Fairstairs than with her own niece , Kate Vavasor . She loved a little bit of intrigue ; and though Kate could intrigue , as we have seen in this story , Kate would not join her aunt 's intrigues . "
364140	364141	364128	364128	I	0	" "
364149	364158	364144	364144	I	0	" said Charlie , blushing at the praise . "

364277	364281	364270	364270	he	12536	" began Charlie . "
364291	364296	364289	364289	Charlie	413	" said Mrs. Greenow , "
364443	364475	364439	364440	the gentlemen	1815	" To this little lecture Miss Fairstairs listened with dutiful patience , and when it was over she said nothing more of her outraged affections or of her disregard for money . "
364518	364636	364637	364637	We	8450	" The next day was what Kate called the blank day at the Hall . The ladies were all alone , and devoted themselves , as was always the case on the blank days , to millinery and household cares . Mrs. Greenow , as has before been stated , had taken a lease of the place , and her troubles extended beyond her mere bridal wardrobe . Large trunks of household linen had arrived , and all this linen was marked with the name of Greenow ; Greenow , 5.58 ; Greenow , 7.52 ; and a good deal had to be done before this ancient wealth of housewifery could probably be converted to Bellfield purposes . "
364655	364665	364648	364648	'em	8451	" said the widow , after some painful consideration . "
364671	364679	364648	364648	'em	8451	" said Jeannette , shaking her head . "
364687	364692	364695	364695	you	413	" said the widow ; "
364724	364915	364708	364708	We	8450	" It was not quite true that Cheesacre had bespoke the dinner out in the field , although no doubt he thought he had done so . The little treat , if treat it was , had all been arranged by Mrs. Greenow , who was ever ready to create festivities . There was not much scope for a picnic here . Besides their own party , which , of course , included the Captain and Mr. Cheesacre , no guest could be caught except the clergyman;—that low - church clergyman , who was so anxious about his income , and with whom the old Squire had quarrelled . Mrs. Greenow had quickly obtained the advantage of his alliance , and he , who was soon to perform on her behalf the marriage ceremony , had promised to grace this little festival . The affair simply amounted to this , that they were to eat their dinner uncomfortably in the field instead of comfortably in the dining - room . But Mrs. Greenow knew that Charlie 's charms would be much strengthened by a dinner out - of - doors . "
364918	364924	364708	364708	We	8450	" she said to Kate , "
364981	365028	365030	365030	me	0	" At two o'clock the gig from Penrith arrived at the Hall , and for the next hour both Cheesacre and the Captain were engaged in preparing the tables and carrying out the viands . The Captain and Charlie Fairstairs were going to lay the cloth . "
365034	365046	365030	365030	me	0	" said Cheesacre taking it out of the Captain 's hands . "
365051	365061	365030	365030	me	0	" said the Captain , giving up his prize . "
365070	365082	365030	365030	me	0	" said Charlie , with a little toss of her head ; "
365100	365288	365093	365093	they	8459	" The day was fine , and although the shade was not perfect , and the midges were troublesome , the dinner went off very nicely . It was beautiful to see how well Mrs. Greenow remembered herself about the grace , seeing that the clergyman was there . She was just in time , and would have been very angry with herself , and have thought herself awkward , had she forgotten it . Mr. Cheesacre sat on her right hand , and the clergyman on her left , and she hardly spoke a word to Bellfield . Her sweetest smiles were all given to Cheesacre . She was specially anxious to keep her neighbour , the parson , in good - humour , and therefore illuminated him once in every five minutes with a passing ray , but the full splendour of her light was poured out upon Cheesacre , as it never had before been poured . How she did flatter him , and with what a capacious gullet did he swallow her flatteries ! Oileymead was the only paradise she had ever seen . "
365302	365343	365344	365344	I	0	" A moment came to him when he thought that even yet he might win the race , and send Bellfield away howling into outer darkness . A moment came to him , and the widow saw the moment well . "
365353	365357	365346	365346	I	0	" said she , "
365375	365376	365410	365417	a wife younger than yourself,—a good deal younger	8463	" "
365381	365386	365410	365417	a wife younger than yourself,—a good deal younger	8463	" said he plaintively . "
365419	365574	365575	365575	You	8465	" Cheesacre did not understand the argument , but he liked the allusion to his position in the county , and he perceived that it was too late for any changes in the present arrangements . But he was happy ; and all that feeling of animosity to Alice had vanished from his breast . Poor Alice ! she , at any rate , was innocent . With so much of her own to fill her mind , she had been but little able to take her share in the Greenow festivities ; and we may safely say , that if Mr. Cheesacre 's supremacy was on any occasion attacked , it was not attacked by her . His supremacy on this occasion was paramount , and during the dinner , and after the dinner , he was allowed to give his orders to Bellfield in a manner that must have gratified him much . "
365588	365716	365575	365575	You	8465	" said Mrs. Greenow ; and Mr. Cheesacre drank the other glass of champagne . It was not the second nor the third that he had taken . After dinner they started off for a ramble through the fields , and Mrs. Greenow and Mr. Cheesacre were together . I think that Charlie Fairstairs did not go with them at all . I think she went into the house and washed her face , and brushed her hair , and settled her muslin . I should not wonder if she took off her frock and ironed it again . Captain Bellfield , I know , went with Alice , and created some astonishment by assuring her that he fully meant to correct the error of his ways . "
365723	365727	365575	365575	You	8465	" he said , "
365741	365769	365738	365739	Miss Vavasor	337	" He too had heard about the future duchess , and wished to be on his best behaviour . Kate fell to the lot of the parson . "
365784	365792	365738	365739	Miss Vavasor	337	" said the widow to her friend . "

366704	366724	366728	366728	him	395	" said Mrs. Greenow . Charlie did not quite understand this , but replied that she preferred being alone . "

366757	366761	366744	366744	He	395	" said Charlie . "

366781	366997	366763	366763	you	395	" It had been necessary to put the bait very close before Cheesacre 's eyes , or there would have been no hope that he might take it . The bait had been put so very close that we must feel sure that he saw the hook . But there are fish so silly that they will take the bait although they know the hook is there . Cheesacre understood it all . Many things he could not see , but he could see that Mrs. Greenow was trying to catch him as a husband for Charlie Fairstairs ; and he knew also that he had always despised Charlie , and that no worldly advantage whatever would accrue to him by a marriage with such a girl . But there she was , and he did n't quite know how to avoid it . She did look rather nice in her clear - starched muslin frock , and he felt that he should like to kiss her . He need n't marry her because he kissed her . The champagne which had created the desire also gave him the audacity . He gave one glance around him to see that he was not observed , and then he did kiss Charlie Fairstairs under the trees . "
367003	367007	367000	367001	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" said Charlie . "
367013	367065	367010	367011	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" echoed a laughing voice ; and poor Cheesacre , looking round , saw that Mrs. Greenow , who ought to have been inside the house looking after the boiling water , was moving about for some unknown reason within sight of the spot which he had chosen for his dalliance . "
367069	367074	367066	367067	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" said Charlie sobbing , "

367148	367312	367316	367316	Sam	499	" Whereupon Charlie got up from her seat under the trees and began to move away slowly . Cheesacre thought about it for a moment or two . Should he follow her or should he not ? He knew that he had better not follow her . He knew that she was bait with a very visible hook . He knew that he was a big fish for whom these two women were angling . But after all , perhaps it would n't do him much harm to be caught . So he got up and followed her . I do n't suppose she meant to take the way towards the woods,—towards the little path leading to the old summer - house up in the trees . She was too much beside herself to know where she was going , no doubt . But that was the path she did take , and before long she and Cheesacre were in the summerhouse together . "
367341	367528	367334	367334	I	0	" ' Twas thus she spoke when the last kiss was given on this occasion;—unless there may have been one or two later in the evening , to which it is not necessary more especially to allude here . But on the occasion of that last kiss in the summer - house Miss Fairstairs was perfectly justified by circumstances , for she was then the promised bride of Mr. Cheesacre . But how was he to get down again among his friends ? That consideration troubled Mr. Cheesacre as he rose from his happy seat after that last embrace . He had promised Charlie , and perhaps he would keep his promise , but it might be as well not to make it all too public at once . But Charlie was n't going to be thrown over;—not if she knew it , as she said to herself . She returned therefore triumphantly among them all,—blushing indeed , and with her eyes turned away , and her hand now remained upon her lover 's arm;—but still so close to him that there could be no mistake . "
367543	367548	367539	367540	Mr. Cheesacre	395	" said Mrs. Greenow . "
367559	367563	367549	367549	We	8504	" said Charlie . "
367568	367678	367549	367549	We	8504	" said Mrs. Greenow . It would be too long to tell now , in these last pages of our story , how Cheesacre strove to escape , and with what skill Mrs. Greenow kept him to his bargain . I hope that Charlie Fairstairs was duly grateful . Before that evening was over , under the comfortable influence of a glass of hot brandy - and - water,—the widow had , I think , herself mixed the second glass for Mr. Cheesacre , before the influence became sufficiently comfortable,—he was forced to own that he had made himself the happy possessor of Charlie Fairstairs ' heart and hand . "
367686	367693	367680	367680	you	8506	" said the widow with enthusiasm ; "
367723	367750	367751	367752	A fellow	9731	" And indeed , before that night was over , Mrs. Greenow had the pair together in her own presence , and then fixed the day . "
367761	367840	367751	367752	A fellow	9731	" Cheesacre said to her , pleading for himself in a whisper . But no ; Mrs. Greenow would give him no such mercy . She knew to what a man turning himself might probably lead . She was a woman who was quite in earnest when she went to work , and I hope that Miss Fairstairs was grateful . Then , in that presence , was in truth the last kiss given on that eventful evening . "
367861	367873	367852	367852	He	9731	" said the widow . And Charlie was good - natured . "
367889	367900	367902	367902	I	0	" said Mrs. Greenow to Kate , the next day , "
367961	367962	367939	367939	He	9731	" "
367977	368297	367964	367964	I	0	" said Kate to her cousin . That event , however , can not be absolutely concluded in these pages . I can only say that , when I think of Mrs. Greenow 's force of character and warmth of friendship , I feel that Miss Fairstairs ' prospects stand on good ground . Mrs. Greenow 's own marriage was completed with perfect success . She took Captain Bellfield for better or for worse , with a thorough determination to make the best of his worst , and to put him on his legs , if any such putting might be possible . He , at any rate , had been in luck . If any possible stroke of fortune could do him good , he had found that stroke . He had found a wife who could forgive all his past offences,—and also , if necessary , some future offences ; who had money enough for all his wants , and kindness enough to gratify them , and who had , moreover,—which for the Captain was the most important,—strength enough to keep from him the power of ruining them both . Reader , let us wish a happy married life to Captain and Mrs. Bellfield ! The day after the ceremony Alice Vavasor and Kate Vavasor started for Matching Priory . Kate and Alice , as they drew near to their journey 's end , were both a little flurried , and I can not but own that there was cause for nervousness . Kate Vavasor was to meet Mr. Grey for the first time . Mr. Grey was now staying at Matching and was to remain there until a week of his marriage . He was then to return to Cambridgeshire for a day or two , and after that was to become a guest at the rector 's house at Matching the evening before the ceremony . "
368307	368316	368301	368301	him	8512	" Lady Glencora had said to her husband . "
368325	368570	368301	368301	him	8512	" But Mr. Palliser would not hear of it . Mr. Palliser , though a Radical in public life , would not for worlds transgress the social laws of his ancestors ; and so the matter was settled . Kate on this very day of her arrival at Matching would thus see Mr. Grey for the first time , and she could not but feel that she had been the means of doing Mr. Grey much injury . She had moreover something,—not much indeed , but still something,—of that feeling which made the Pallisers terrible to the imagination , because of their rank and wealth . She was a little afraid of the Pallisers , but of Mr. Grey she was very much afraid . And Alice also was not at her ease . She would fain have prevented so very quick a marriage had she not felt that now,—after all the trouble that she had caused,—there was nothing left for her but to do as others wished . When a day had been named she had hardly dared to demur , and had allowed Lady Glencora to settle everything as she had wished . But it was not only the suddenness of her marriage which dismayed her . Its nature and attributes were terrible to her . Both Lady Midlothian and the Marchioness of Auld Reekie were coming . When this was told to her by letter she had no means of escape . "
368582	368590	368579	368579	she	774	" Lady Glencora had written to her . "
368628	368791	368619	368619	You	8514	" Lady Glencora , moreover , had settled for her the list of bridesmaids . Alice had made a petition that she might be allowed to go through the ceremony with only one,—with none but Kate to back her . But she ought to have known that when she consented to be married at Matching,—and indeed she had had very little power of resisting that proposition,—all such questions would be decided for her . Two daughters therefore of Lady Midlothian were to act , Lady Jane and Lady Mary , and the one daughter of the Marchioness , who was also a Lady Jane , and there were to be two Miss Howards down from London,—girls who were known both to Alice and to Lady Glencora , and who were in some distant way connected with them both . A great attempt was made to induce the two Miss Pallisers to join the bevy , but they had frankly pleaded their age . "
368801	368809	368619	368619	You	8514	" said the strong - minded Sophy , "
368841	368889	368890	368890	She	8520	" Lady Glencora was therefore obliged to submit to do the work with only six . But she swore that they should be very smart . She was to give all the dresses , and Mr. Palliser was to give a brooch and an armlet to each . "
368906	369042	368904	368904	yourself	8522	" Lady Glencora had said to her husband , and he had answered by giving her carte blanche as regards expense . All this was very terrible to Kate , who had not much feminine taste for finery . Of the dress she had heard,—of the dress which was waiting at Matching to be made up after her arrival,—though as yet she knew nothing of the trinkets . There are many girls who could submit themselves at a moment to the kindness of such a woman as Lady Glencora . Perhaps most girls would do so , for of all such women in the world , Lady Glencora was the least inclined to patronize or to be condescending in her kindnesses . But Kate Vavasor was one to whom such submission would not come easily . "
369052	369061	369045	369045	I	0	" she said to Alice in the train . "
369070	369071	368904	368904	yourself	8522	" "
369111	369112	369105	369105	they	8524	" "
369132	369133	369123	369123	You	0	" "
369161	369162	369164	369164	mine	0	" "
369166	369167	369173	369173	yours	0	" "
369206	369207	369195	369195	them,—one	8532	" "
369219	369220	369209	369209	you	0	" "
369275	369335	369336	369336	She	8534	" She talked even of getting out at some station and returning , and would have done so had not Alice made it impossible . As it was , the evening found her and Alice together entering the park - gate at Matching , in Lady Glencora 's carriage . Lady Glencora had sent a note to the station . "
369342	369346	369340	369340	herself	8534	" she said , "
369368	369461	369355	369355	You	350	" Alice did n't say a word , having been very anxious not to lower Mr. Palliser in her cousin 's respect . None of the Lady Janes and Lady Marys were at Matching when they arrived . Indeed , there was no guest there but Mr. Grey , for which Kate felt herself to be extremely grateful . Mr. Grey came into the hall , standing behind Mr. Palliser , who stood behind his wife . Alice passed by them both , and was at once in her lover 's arms . "
369468	369475	369466	369466	myself	0	" said Lady Glencora to Kate , "
369481	369502	369477	369478	my husband	2978	" This she did , and no woman in England could have excelled her in the manner of doing it . "
369511	369521	369503	369503	I	0	" said she , still keeping Kate 's hand , "
369536	369614	369532	369532	you	8537	" she added in a whisper . Then Mr. Grey was brought up to her , and they were introduced . It was not till some days had passed over them that she felt herself at all at her ease with Mr. Grey , and I doubt whether she ever reached that point with Mr. Palliser ; but Lady Glencora she knew , and liked , and almost loved , from the first moment of their meeting . "
369621	369647	369616	369616	you	8537	" said Lady Glencora to Alice , the first minute that they were alone . Alice , of course , had not heard the news . "
369718	369746	369747	369747	She	548	" Alice , who had personally known more of Mr. Bott than of Mrs. Marsham , said that she could n't but be sorry for the lady . "
369756	369761	369747	369747	She	548	" said Lady Glencora , "
369816	369817	369809	369809	Alice	350	" "
369822	369823	369809	369809	Alice	350	" "
369862	369863	369864	369864	He	353	" "
369872	369873	369874	369874	He	353	" "
369921	369922	369912	369912	he	485	" "
369934	369935	369931	369931	he	485	" "

370028	370041	370023	370023	I	0	" said Alice . Though , of course , she did guess . "
370164	370165	370161	370162	Mr. Grey	353	" "
370170	370171	370168	370168	Glencora	488	" "
370266	370570	370258	370258	he	353	" Lady Glencora , as she said all this , knew well that the news she was giving would please her cousin better than any other tidings that could be told . By degrees the guests came . The two Miss Howards were the first , and they expressed themselves as delighted with Lady Glencora 's taste and with Mr. Palliser 's munificence,—for at that time the brooches and armlets had been produced . Kate had said very little about these matters , but the Miss Howards were loud in their thanks . But they were good - humoured , merry girls , and the house was pleasanter after their arrival than it had been before . Then came the dreaded personage,—the guest,—Lady Midlothian ! On the subject of Lady Midlothian Kate had really become curious . She had a real desire to see the face and gait of the woman , and to hear her voice . Lady Midlothian came , and with her came Lady Jane and Lady Mary . I am by no means sure that Lady Jane and Lady Mary were not nearly as old as the two Miss Pallisers ; but they were not probably so fully resolved as to the condition of their future modes of living as were those two ladies , and if so , they were not wrong to shine as bridesmaids . With them Alice had made some slight acquaintance during the last spring in London , and as they were now to attend upon her as the bride they were sufficiently gracious . To Kate , too , they were civil enough , and things , in public , went on very pleasantly at Matching . A scene there was , of course , between Alice and Lady Midlothian;—a scene in private . "
370577	370587	370571	370571	You	8559	" Lady Glencora had said , with jocose mournfulness ; "
370608	370609	370594	370594	her	8560	" "
370621	370625	370615	370615	people	8774	" Alice said . "
370763	370785	370805	370805	she	774	" Alice could not escape altogether , and therefore was closeted with Lady Midlothian for the best part of an hour . "
370796	370801	370787	370788	Lady Macleod	774	" the Countess asked . "
370813	370814	370805	370805	she	774	" "
370824	370825	370822	370822	Alice	350	" "
370834	370835	370830	370830	I	0	" "
370895	370980	370883	370883	I	0	" The Countess paused , but Alice said nothing . Her tongue was itching to tell the old woman that she cared nothing for this expression of satisfaction ; but she was aware that she had done much that was deserving of punishment , and resolved to take this as part of her penance . She was being jumped upon , and it was unpleasant ; but , after all that had happened , it was only fitting that she should undergo much unpleasantness . "
370984	370989	370883	370883	I	0	" continued the Countess ; "
371023	371024	370993	370993	I	0	" "
371035	371036	371032	371033	Lady Midlothian	350	" "

371106	371107	371108	371108	I	0	" "
371147	371161	371162	371162	I	0	" Alice thought that she knew very well , but she said nothing . "
371256	371272	371236	371236	I	0	" Here Lady Midlothian held up one hand in a manner that was truly imposing ; "
371309	371330	371300	371300	I	0	" Here Lady Midlothian put up both her hands gently , as though wafting the injury away into the air . "
371350	371438	371440	371440	her	8570	" Here she paused again , and Alice winced . Who was this dreadful old Countess;—what was the Countess to her , that she should be thus tormented with the old woman 's forgiveness ? John Grey had forgiven her , and of external forgiveness that was enough . She had not forgiven herself,—would never forgive herself altogether ; and the pardon of no old woman in England could assist her in doing so . She had sinned , but she had not sinned against Lady Midlothian . "
371451	371476	371440	371440	her	8570	" Lady Glencora had said . She had resolved that it should be so , but it was very hard to keep her resolution . "
371486	371491	371493	371493	she	8687	" continued Lady Midlothian , "
371505	371526	371493	371493	she	8687	" There is comfort at any rate in that , thought Alice , who had never yet seen the Marchioness . "
371604	371605	371611	371611	him	9144	" "
371620	371624	371611	371611	him	9144	" said Alice . "
371656	371688	371651	371651	me	0	" Alice did as she was bidden , and accepted the kiss and the congratulations , and a little box of jewellery which Lady Midlothian produced from out of her pocket . "
371730	371937	371719	371719	I	0	" I hardly know which was the worst , the lecture , the kiss , or the present . The latter she would have declined , had it been possible ; but it was not possible . When she had agreed to be married at Matching she had not calculated the amount of punishment which would thereby be inflicted on her . But I think that , though she bore it impatiently , she was aware that she had deserved it . Although she fretted herself greatly under the infliction of Lady Midlothian , she acknowledged to herself , even at the time , that she deserved all the lashes she received . She had made a fool of herself in her vain attempt to be greater and grander than other girls , and it was only fair that her folly should be in some sort punished before it was fully pardoned . John Grey punished it after one fashion ; by declining to allude to it , or to think of it , or to take any account of it . And now Lady Midlothian had punished it after another fashion , and Alice went out of the Countess 's presence with sundry inward exclamations of "
371941	372204	371719	371719	I	0	" and with many unseen beatings of the breast . Two days before the ceremony came the Marchioness and her august daughter . Her Lady Jane was much more august than the other Lady Jane;—very much more august indeed . She had very long flaxen hair , and very light blue eyes , which she did not move frequently , and she spoke very little,—one may almost say not at all , and she never seemed to do anything . But she was very august , and was , as all the world knew , engaged to marry the Duke of Dumfriesshire , who , though twice her own age , was as yet childless , as soon as he should have completed his mourning for his first wife . Kate told her cousin that she did not at all know how she should ever stand up as one in a group with so august a person as this Lady Jane , and Alice herself felt that such an attendant would quite obliterate her . But Lady Jane and her mother were both harmless . The Marchioness never spoke to Kate and hardly spoke to Alice , and the Marchioness 's Lady Jane was quite as silent as her mother . On the morning of this day,—the day on which these very august people came,—a telegram arrived at the Priory calling for Mr. Palliser 's immediate presence in London . He came to Alice full of regret , and behaved himself very nicely . Alice now regarded him quite as a friend . "
372210	372214	372207	372207	I	0	" she said , "

372385	372401	372381	372381	I	0	" said she , with her face brighter than he had ever yet seen it . "
372410	372460	372402	372402	I	0	" said he . Alice looking up at him with her eyes full of tears told him that she did like them best ; and then , as he wished her all happiness , and as he was stooping over her to kiss her , Lady Glencora came in . "
372465	372469	372402	372402	I	0	" said she , "

372582	372587	372571	372572	her ladyship	8703	" said Lady Glencora . "
372595	372633	372588	372588	I	0	" said Alice . Then Lady Glencora took up the Countess 's trinkets , and shook her head and turned up her nose . There was a wonderfully comic expression on her face as she did so . "
372645	372649	372635	372635	me	0	" said Alice . "
372658	372663	372651	372651	me	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
372686	372778	372681	372681	I	0	" On the evening before the marriage Alice and Lady Glencora walked for the last time through the Priory ruins . It was now September , and the evenings were still long , so that the ladies could get out upon the lawn after dinner . Whether Lady Glencora would have been allowed to walk through the ruins so late as half - past eight in the evening if her husband had been there may be doubtful , but her husband was away and she took this advantage of his absence . "
372788	372793	372780	372780	you	0	" said Lady Glencora . "

373059	373091	373092	373093	Poor fellow	8880	" Then she told Alice what had been done for Burgo ; how his uncle had paid his bills once again , and had agreed to give him a small income . "
373095	373100	373092	373093	Poor fellow	8880	" said Lady Glencora , "
373114	373194	373111	373111	you	350	" The marriage was magnificent , greatly to the dismay of Alice and to the discomfort of Mr. Vavasor , who came down on the eve of the ceremony,—arriving while his daughter and Lady Glencora were in the ruins . Mr. Grey seemed to take it all very easily , and , as Lady Glencora said , played his part exactly as though he were in the habit of being married , at any rate , once a year . "
373213	373237	373205	373205	you	350	" she said , as Alice stood with her a moment alone in the dressing - room up - stairs before her departure . "
373242	373246	373238	373238	I	0	" said Alice , "
373254	373398	373249	373249	I	0	" Mr. Grey and wife were duly carried away from Matching Priory by post horses , and did their honeymoon , we may be quite sure , with much satisfaction . When Alice was first asked where she would go , she simply suggested that it should not be to Switzerland . They did , in truth , go by slow stages to Italy , to Venice , Florence , and on to Rome ; but such had not been their intention when they first started on their journey . At that time Mr. Grey believed that he would be wanted again in England , down at Silverbridge in Barsetshire , very shortly . But before he had married a week he learned that all that was to be postponed . The cup of fruition had not yet reached Mr. Palliser 's lips . "
373416	373519	373520	373520	You	8598	" That had been the message sent by Mr. Palliser to Mr. Grey . Lady Glencora 's message to Alice had been rather more full , having occupied three pages of note paper , the last of which had been crossed , but I do not know that it was more explicit . She had abused Lord Brock , had abused Mr. Finespun , and had abused all public things and institutions , because the arrangements as now proposed would be very comfortable to Alice , but would not , as she was pleased to think , be very comfortable to herself . "
373570	373632	373633	373633	He	8599	" There were many very long letters came from Lady Glencora to Rome during the winter,—letters which Alice enjoyed thoroughly , but which she could not but regard as being very indiscreet . The Duke was at the Castle during the Christmas week , and the descriptions of the Duke and of his solicitude as to his heir were very comic . "
373772	373945	373952	373952	he	8611	" This was very indiscreet . Lady Glencora would write indiscreet letters like this , which Alice could not show to her husband . It was a thousand pities . But December and January wore themselves away , and the time came in which the Greys were bound to return to England . The husband had very fully discussed with his wife that matter of his parliamentary ambition , and found in her a very ready listener . Having made up his mind to do this thing , he was resolved to do it thoroughly , and was becoming almost as full of politics , almost as much devoted to sugar , as Mr. Palliser himself . He at any rate could not complain that his wife would not interest herself in his pursuits . Then , as they returned , came letters from Lady Glencora , written as her troubles grew nigh . The Duke had gone , of course ; but he was to be there at the appointed time . "
373965	373995	373996	373997	The Duke	464	" said Lady Glencora . When they reached London they first heard the news from Mr. Vavasor , who on this occasion condescended to meet them at the railway . "
374003	374013	374000	374001	an heir	3791	" he said , before the carriage - door was open;—"born
374017	374052	374000	374001	an heir	3791	" One might have supposed that it was the Duke 's baby , and not the baby of Lady Glencora and Mr. Palliser . There was a note from Mr. Palliser to Mr. Grey . "
374056	374061	374000	374001	an heir	3791	" said the note , "
374066	374075	374076	374076	Glencora	488	boy"—Mr . Palliser had scorned to use the word child—"Lady
374099	374474	374503	374503	Alice,—if	787	" Mr. Palliser 's honours , as will be seen , came rushing upon him all at once . Wondrous little baby,—purpureo genitus ! What have the gods not done for thee , if thou canst only manage to live till thy good things are all thine own,—to live through all the terrible solicitude with which they will envelope thee ! Better than royal rank will be thine , with influence more than royal , and power of action fettered by no royalty . Royal wealth which will be really thine own , to do with it as it beseemeth thee . Thou wilt be at the top of an aristocracy in a country where aristocrats need gird themselves with no buckram . All that the world can give will be thine ; and yet when we talk of thee religiously , philosophically , or politico - economically , we are wo nt to declare that thy chances of happiness are no better,—no better , if they be no worse,—than are those of thine infant neighbour just born , in that farmyard cradle . Who shall say that they are better or that they are worse ? Or if they be better , or if they be worse , how shall we reconcile to ourselves that seeming injustice ? And now we will pay a little visit to the small one born in the purple , and the story of that visit shall be the end of our history . It was early in April , quite early in April , and Mr. and Mrs. Grey were both at Gatherum Castle . Mrs. Grey was there at the moment of which we write , but Mr. Grey was absent at Silverbridge with Mr. Palliser . This was the day of the Silverbridge election , and Mr. Grey had gone to that ancient borough , to offer himself as a candidate to the electors , backed by the presence and aid of a very powerful member of the Cabinet . Lady Glencora and Alice were sitting up - stairs with the small , purple - born one in their presence , and the small , purple - born one was lying in Alice 's lap . "

In the course of that afternoon Lady Glencora took Alice all over the house . It was a castle of enormous size , quite new,—having been built by the present proprietor,—very cold , very handsome , and very dull . "
374871	374899	374786	374786	he	2896	" said Alice , as she stood looking round her in the grand hall , which was never used as an entrance except on very grand occasions . "

The latter was then a Member of Parliament , but the former at that moment was the possessor of no such dignity . The election for the borough was now over , whereas that for the county had not yet taken place . But there was no rival candidate for the position , and Mr. Palliser was thoroughly contented with his fate . He was at this moment actually Chancellor of the Exchequer , and in about ten days ' time would be on his legs in the House proposing for his country 's use his scheme of finance . The two men were seated together in an open carriage , and were being whirled along by four horses . They were both no doubt happy in their ambition , but I think that of the two , Mr. Palliser showed his triumph the most . Not that he spoke even to his friend a word that was triumphant in its tone . It was not thus that he rejoiced . He was by nature too placid for that . But there was a nervousness in his contentment which told the tale to any observer who might know how to read it . "
