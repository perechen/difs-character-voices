1405	1416	1424	1424	he	419	" Well , John , how goes it with you ? "
1427	1435	1424	1424	he	419	" Any news of Esther , yet ? "
1468	1473	1475	1476	John Barton	110	" Come , women , "
1478	1522	1475	1476	John Barton	110	" you 've both walked far enough . My Mary expects to have her bed in three weeks ; and as for you , Mrs. Wilson , you know you 're but a cranky sort of a body at the best of times . "
1536	1569	1570	1570	he	110	" Sit you down here ; the grass is well nigh dry by this time ; and you 're neither of you nesh [ 1 ] folk about taking cold . Stay , "
1577	1636	1570	1570	he	110	" here 's my pocket - handkerchief to spread under you , to save the gowns women always think so much of ; and now , Mrs. Wilson , give me the baby , I may as well carry him , while you talk and comfort my wife ; poor thing , she takes on sadly about Esther . "
1696	1708	1710	1710	Wilson	114	" Then you 've heard nothing of Esther , poor lass ? "
1712	1827	1710	1710	Wilson	114	" No , nor sha n't , as I take it . My mind is , she 's gone off with somebody . My wife frets , and thinks she 's drowned herself , but I tell her , folks do n't care to put on their best clothes to drown themselves ; and Mrs. Bradshaw ( where she lodged , you know ) says the last time she set eyes on her was last Tuesday , when she came down stairs , dressed in her Sunday gown , and with a new ribbon in her bonnet , and gloves on her hands , like the lady she was so fond of thinking herself . "
1828	1842	1710	1710	Wilson	114	" She was as pretty a creature as ever the sun shone on . "
1843	1861	1863	1863	Barton	110	" Ay , she was a farrantly [ 2 ] lass ; more 's the pity now , "
1869	2019	1863	1863	Barton	110	" You see them Buckinghamshire people as comes to work in Manchester , has quite a different look with them to us Manchester folk . You 'll not see among the Manchester wenches such fresh rosy cheeks , or such black lashes to gray eyes ( making them look like black ) , as my wife and Esther had . I never seed two such pretty women for sisters ; never . Not but what beauty is a sad snare . Here was Esther so puffed up , that there was no holding her in . Her spirit was always up , if I spoke ever so little in the way of advice to her ; my wife spoiled her , it is true , for you see she was so much older than Esther she was more like a mother to her , doing every thing for her . "
2020	2028	2030	2031	his friend	438	" I wonder she ever left you , "
2033	2371	1863	1863	Barton	110	" That 's the worst of factory work , for girls . They can earn so much when work is plenty , that they can maintain themselves any how . My Mary shall never work in a factory , that I 'm determined on . You see Esther spent her money in dress , thinking to set off her pretty face ; and got to come home so late at night , that at last I told her my mind : my missis thinks I spoke crossly , but I meant right , for I loved Esther , if it was only for Mary 's sake . Says I , ' Esther , I see what you 'll end at with your artificials , and your fly - away veils , and stopping out when honest women are in their beds ; you 'll be a street - walker , Esther , and then , do n't you go to think I 'll have you darken my door , though my wife is your sister . ' So says she , ' Do n't trouble yourself , John . I 'll pack up and be off now , for I 'll never stay to hear myself called as you call me . ' She flushed up like a turkey - cock , and I thought fire would come out of her eyes ; but when she saw Mary cry ( for Mary ca n't abide words in a house ) , she went and kissed her , and said she was not so bad as I thought her . So we talked more friendly , for , as I said , I liked the lass well enough , and her pretty looks , and her cheery ways . But she said ( and at the time I thought there was sense in what she said ) we should be much better friends if she went into lodgings , and only came to see us now and then . "
2372	2397	1863	1863	Barton	110	" Then you still were friendly . Folks said you 'd cast her off , and said you 'd never speak to her again . "
2398	2410	2412	2413	John Barton	110	" Folks always make one a deal worse than one is , "
2417	2470	2412	2413	John Barton	110	" She came many a time to our house after she left off living with us . Last Sunday se'nnight — no ! it was this very last Sunday , she came to drink a cup of tea with Mary ; and that was the last time we set eyes on her . "
2471	2481	2483	2483	Wilson	114	" Was she any ways different in her manner ? "
2485	2659	2483	2483	Wilson	114	" Well , I do n't know . I have thought several times since , that she was a bit quieter , and more womanly - like ; more gentle , and more blushing , and not so riotous and noisy . She comes in , toward four o'clock , when afternoon church was loosing , and she goes and hangs her bonnet up on the old nail we used to call hers , while she lived with us . I remember thinking what a pretty lass she was , as she sat on a low stool by Mary , who was rocking herself , and in rather a poor way . She laughed and cried by turns , but all so softly and gently , like a child , that I could n't find in my heart to scold her , especially as Mary was fretting already . One thing I do remember I did say , and pretty sharply too . She took our little Mary by the waist , and — "
2660	2700	2702	2702	Wilson	114	" Thou must leave off calling her ' little ' Mary , she 's growing up into as fine a lass as one can see on a summer 's day ; more of her mother 's stock than thine , "
2704	2883	2702	2702	Wilson	114	" Well , well , I call her ' little , ' because her mother 's name is Mary . But , as I was saying , she takes Mary in a coaxing sort of way , and , ' Mary , ' says she , ' what should you think if I sent for you some day and made a lady of you ? ' So I could not stand such talk as that to my girl , and I said , ' Thou'd best not put that nonsense i ' the girl 's head I can tell thee ; I 'd rather see her earning her bread by the sweat of her brow , as the Bible tells her she should do , ay , though she never got butter to her bread , than be like a do - nothing lady , worrying shopmen all morning , and screeching at her pianny all afternoon , and going to bed without having done a good turn to any one of God 's creatures but herself . ' "
2884	2892	2894	2894	Wilson	114	" Thou never could abide the gentlefolk , "
2904	2919	2921	2921	Barton	110	" And what good have they ever done me that I should like them ? "
2938	3098	2935	2935	he	110	" If I am sick , do they come and nurse me ? If my child lies dying ( as poor Tom lay , with his white wan lips quivering , for want of better food than I could give him ) , does the rich man bring the wine or broth that might save his life ? If I am out of work for weeks in the bad times , and winter comes , with black frost , and keen east wind , and there is no coal for the grate , and no clothes for the bed , and the thin bones are seen through the ragged clothes , does the rich man share his plenty with me , as he ought to do , if his religion was n't a humbug ? When I lie on my death - bed , and Mary ( bless her ) stands fretting , as I know she will fret , "
3107	3264	3101	3101	his	441	" will a rich lady come and take her to her own home if need be , till she can look round , and see what best to do ? No , I tell you , it 's the poor , and the poor only , as does such things for the poor . Do n't think to come over me with th ' old tale , that the rich know nothing of the trials of the poor . I say , if they do n't know , they ought to know . We 're their slaves as long as we can work ; we pile up their fortunes with the sweat of our brows ; and yet we are to live as separate as if we were in two worlds ; ay , as separate as Dives and Lazarus , with a great gulf betwixt us : but I know who was best off then , "
3282	3287	3289	3289	Wilson	114	" Well , neighbour , "
3291	3318	3289	3289	Wilson	114	" all that may be very true , but what I want to know now is about Esther — when did you last hear of her ? "
3319	3757	3266	3266	he	442	" Why , she took leave of us that Sunday night in a very loving way , kissing both wife Mary , and daughter Mary ( if I must not call her little ) , and shaking hands with me ; but all in a cheerful sort of manner , so we thought nothing about her kisses and shakes . But on Wednesday night comes Mrs. Bradshaw 's son with Esther 's box , and presently Mrs. Bradshaw follows with the key ; and when we began to talk , we found Esther told her she was coming back to live with us , and would pay her week 's money for not giving notice ; and on Tuesday night she carried off a little bundle ( her best clothes were on her back , as I said before ) , and told Mrs. Bradshaw not to hurry herself about the big box , but bring it when she had time . So of course she thought she should find Esther with us ; and when she told her story , my missis set up such a screech , and fell down in a dead swoon . Mary ran up with water for her mother , and I thought so much about my wife , I did not seem to care at all for Esther . But the next day I asked all the neighbours ( both our own and Bradshaw 's ) , and they 'd none of 'em heard or seen nothing of her . I even went to a policeman , a good enough sort of man , but a fellow I 'd never spoke to before because of his livery , and I asks him if his ' cuteness could find any thing out for us . So I believe he asks other policemen ; and one on 'em had seen a wench , like our Esther , walking very quickly , with a bundle under her arm , on Tuesday night , toward eight o'clock , and get into a hackney coach , near Hulme Church , and we do n't know th ' number , and ca n't trace it no further . I 'm sorry enough for the girl , for bad 's come over her , one way or another , but I 'm sorrier for my wife . She loved her next to me and Mary , and she 's never been the same body since poor Tom 's death . However , let 's go back to them ; your old woman may have done her good . "
3783	3910	3767	3767	Wilson	114	" Still our Alice lives in the cellar under No . 14 , in Barber Street , and if you 'd only speak the word she 'd be with you in five minutes , to keep your wife company when she 's lonesome . Though I 'm Alice 's brother , and perhaps ought not to say it , I will say there 's none more ready to help with heart or hand than she is . Though she may have done a hard day 's wash , there 's not a child ill within the street but Alice goes to offer to sit up , and does sit up too , though may be she 's to be at her work by six next morning . "
3911	3927	3929	3929	Barton	110	" She 's a poor woman , and can feel for the poor , Wilson , "
3938	3987	3935	3935	he	110	" Thank you kindly for your offer , and mayhap I may trouble her to be a bit with my wife , for while I 'm at work , and Mary 's at school , I know she frets above a bit . See , there 's Mary ! "
4087	4095	4071	4075	an over - grown lad	453	" For old acquaintance sake , Mary . "
4096	4106	4108	4109	the girl	4720	" Take that for old acquaintance sake , then , "
4163	4195	4196	4196	Mary	124	" Here , children , instead o ' kissing and quarrelling , do ye each take a baby , for if Wilson 's arms be like mine they are heartily tired . "
4249	4263	4276	4276	he	467	" Twins is a great trial to a poor man , bless 'em , "
4290	4304	4276	4276	he	467	" Here we are , wife ; didst thou think thou'd lost us ? "
4413	4425	4427	4428	her husband	470	" Now , hold your tongue , missis , will you , "
4434	4504	4427	4428	her husband	470	" Do n't you know them brats never goes to sleep till long past ten ? and have n't you a shawl , under which you can tuck one lad 's head , as safe as a bird 's under its wing ? And as for t'other one , I 'll put it in my pocket rather than not stay , now we are this far away from Ancoats . "
4505	4514	4516	4517	Mrs. Barton	112	" Or I can lend you another shawl , "
4519	4529	4516	4517	Mrs. Barton	112	" Ay , any thing rather than not stay . "
4786	4798	4778	4779	Mary Barton	124	" Eh , look ! Polly Barton 's gotten a sweetheart . "
5600	5656	5593	5594	Mrs. Barton	112	" Run , Mary dear , just round the corner , and get some fresh eggs at Tipping 's ( you may get one a - piece , that will be five - pence ) , and see if he has any nice ham cut , that he would let us have a pound of . "
5657	5670	5673	5674	the husband	520	" Say two pounds , missis , and do n't be stingy , "
5676	5717	5673	5674	the husband	520	" Well , a pound and a half , Mary . And get it Cumberland ham , for Wilson comes from there - away , and it will have a sort of relish of home with it he 'll like,—and Mary "
5728	5760	5673	5674	the husband	520	" you must get a pennyworth of milk and a loaf of bread — mind you get it fresh and new — and , and — that 's all , Mary . "
5761	5769	5771	5772	her husband	470	" No , it 's not all , "
5774	5819	5771	5772	her husband	470	" Thou must get sixpennyworth of rum , to warm the tea ; thou'll get it at the ' Grapes . ' And thou just go to Alice Wilson ; he says she lives just right round the corner , under 14 , Barber Street "
5829	5862	5771	5772	her husband	470	" and tell her to come and take her tea with us ; she 'll like to see her brother , I 'll be bound , let alone Jane and the twins . "
5863	5894	5896	5897	Mrs. Barton	112	" If she comes she must bring a tea - cup and saucer , for we have but half - a - dozen , and here 's six of us , "
5899	5915	5896	5897	Mrs. Barton	112	" Pooh ! pooh ! Jem and Mary can drink out of one , surely . "
6376	6380	6389	6389	she	126	" Come in , "
6411	6419	6421	6421	she	124	" Is that you , Mary Barton ? "
6436	6460	6421	6421	she	124	" How you are grown since I used to see you at my brother 's ! Come in , lass , come in . "
6461	6464	6466	6466	Mary	124	" Please , "
6471	6513	6466	6466	Mary	124	" mother says you 're to come to tea , and bring your cup and saucer , for George and Jane Wilson is with us , and the twins , and Jem . And you 're to make haste , please . "
6514	6561	6421	6421	she	124	" I 'm sure it 's very neighbourly and kind in your mother , and I 'll come , with many thanks . Stay , Mary , has your mother got any nettles for spring drink ? If she has n't I 'll take her some . "
6562	6572	6573	6573	Mary	124	" No , I do n't think she has . "
7071	7086	7068	7068	she	126	" Here 's to absent friends . Friends may meet , but mountains never . "
7268	7280	7282	7283	poor Alice	126	" I will take care not to come and spoil it , "
7301	7314	7291	7291	she	126	" You do n't know how sorry I am I said it . "
7347	7401	7419	7419	she	126	" You did n't mean any harm , and it was me as was so foolish ; only this work about Esther , and not knowing where she is , lies so heavy on my heart . Good night , and never think no more about it . God bless you , Alice . "
7439	7451	7434	7434	she	126	" Good night , Mary , and may God bless you . "
7514	7520	7522	7522	he	562	" Me , John Barton , "
7531	7562	7503	7503	she	561	" My missis is in labour , and , for the love of God , step in while I run for th ' doctor , for she 's fearful bad . "
7756	7763	7765	7765	he	110	" Is she so very bad ? "
7767	7779	7781	7781	John	110	" Worse , much worser than ever I saw her before , "
7980	8003	7976	7976	Barton	110	" You must go down stairs . This is a great shock , but bear it like a man . Go down . "
8111	8127	8130	8130	he	566	" Nothing could have saved her — there has been some shock to the system — "
8342	8345	8316	8316	she	576	" Mary , "
8699	8717	8674	8674	She	124	" Oh , mother ! mother , are you really dead ! Oh , mother , mother ! "
8868	8884	8886	8886	he	450	" Child , we must be all to one another , now she is gone , "
8888	8910	8886	8886	he	450	" Oh , father , what can I do for you ? Do tell me ! I 'll do any thing . "
8911	8951	9006	9007	her father	450	" I know thou wilt . Thou must not fret thyself ill , that 's the first thing I ask . Thou must leave me , and go to bed now , like a good girl as thou art . "
8952	8965	8886	8886	he	450	" Leave you , father ! oh , do n't say so . "
8966	9000	9001	9001	Mary	124	" Ay , but thou must ! thou must go to bed , and try and sleep ; thou'lt have enough to do and to bear , poor wench , to - morrow . "
9781	9783	9766	9766	he	629	" aggravated "
11526	11531	11522	11523	the workwomen	749	" her young ladies ; "
11787	11796	11783	11783	she	124	" in the days of long - ago ; "
11860	11873	11857	11857	she	124	" If mother had but lived , she would have helped me . "
12328	12427	12309	12309	Alice	126	" You 'll think it dull enough to come just to sit with an old woman like me , but there 's a tidy young lass as lives in the floor above , who does plain work , and now and then a bit in your own line , Mary ; she 's grand - daughter to old Job Legh , a spinner , and a good girl she is . Do come , Mary ! I 've a terrible wish to make you known to each other . She 's a genteel - looking lass , too . "
13189	13208	13210	13210	Alice	126	" I can not think what keeps Mary Barton . She 's quite grand with her late hours , "
13482	13552	13564	13564	Margaret	136	" My mother used to send me some clap - bread by any north - country person — bless her ! She knew how good such things taste when far away from home . Not but what every one likes it . When I was in service my fellow - servants were always glad to share with me . Eh , it 's a long time ago , yon . "
13553	13562	13564	13564	Margaret	136	" Do tell us about it , Alice , "
13566	13936	13564	13564	Margaret	136	" Why , lass , there 's nothing to tell . There was more mouths at home than could be fed . Tom , that 's Will 's father ( you do n't know Will , but he 's a sailor to foreign parts ) , had come to Manchester , and sent word what terrible lots of work was to be had , both for lads and lasses . So father sent George first ( you know George , well enough , Mary ) , and then work was scarce out toward Burton , where we lived , and father said I maun try and get a place . And George wrote as how wages were far higher in Manchester than Milnthorpe or Lancaster ; and , lasses , I was young and thoughtless , and thought it was a fine thing to go so far from home . So , one day , th ' butcher he brings us a letter fra George , to say he 'd heard on a place — and I was all agog to go , and father was pleased , like ; but mother said little , and that little was very quiet . I 've often thought she was a bit hurt to see me so ready to go — God forgive me ! But she packed up my clothes , and some o ' the better end of her own as would fit me , in yon little paper box up there — it 's good for nought now , but I would liefer live without fire than break it up to be burnt ; and yet it 's going on for eighty years old , for she had it when she was a girl , and brought all her clothes in it to father 's , when they were married . But , as I was saying , she did not cry , though the tears was often in her eyes ; and I seen her looking after me down the lane as long as I were in sight , with her hand shading her eyes — and that were the last look I ever had on her . "
13998	14018	14020	14020	Mary	124	" Did you never see her again , Alice ? Did you never go home while she was alive ? "
14022	14180	14020	14020	Mary	124	" No , nor since . Many a time and oft have I planned to go . I plan it yet , and hope to go home again before it please God to take me . I used to try and save money enough to go for a week when I was in service ; but first one thing came , and then another . First , missis 's children fell ill of the measles , just when th ' week I 'd ask'd for came , and I could n't leave them , for one and all cried for me to nurse them . Then missis herself fell sick , and I could go less than ever . For , you see , they kept a little shop , and he drank , and missis and me was all there was to mind children , and shop , and all , and cook and wash besides . "
14195	14304	14020	14020	Mary	124	" Eh , lass ! thou little knows the pleasure o ' helping others ; I was as happy there as could be ; almost as happy as I was at home . Well , but next year I thought I could go at a leisure time , and missis telled me I should have a fortnight then , and I used to sit up all that winter working hard at patchwork , to have a quilt of my own making to take to my mother . But master died , and missis went away fra Manchester , and I 'd to look out for a place again . "
14305	14310	14312	14312	Mary	124	" Well , but , "
14314	14328	14020	14020	Mary	124	" I should have thought that was the best time to go home . "
14329	14417	14419	14422	the poor old woman	827	" No , I thought not . You see it was a different thing going home for a week on a visit , may be with money in my pocket to give father a lift , to going home to be a burden to him . Besides , how could I hear o ' a place there ? Anyways I thought it best to stay , though perhaps it might have been better to ha ' gone , for then I should ha ' seen mother again ; "
14426	14437	14439	14439	Margaret	136	" I 'm sure you did what you thought right , "
14443	14452	14454	14454	Alice	126	" Ay , lass , that 's it , "
14464	14634	14454	14454	Alice	126	" That 's the thing , and then let the Lord send what He sees fit ; not but that I grieved sore , oh , sore and sad , when toward spring next year , when my quilt were all done to th ' lining , George came in one evening to tell me mother was dead . I cried many a night at after ; [ 3 ] I 'd no time for crying by day , for that missis was terrible strict ; she would not hearken to my going to th ' funeral ; and indeed I would have been too late , for George set off that very night by th ' coach , and th ' letter had been kept or summut ( posts were not like th ' posts now - a - days ) , and he found the burial all over , and father talking o ' flitting ; for he could n't abide the cottage after mother was gone . "
14635	14642	14644	14644	Mary	124	" Was it a pretty place ? "
14646	14997	14644	14644	Mary	124	" Pretty , lass ! I never seed such a bonny bit anywhere . You see there are hills there as seem to go up into th ' skies , not near may be , but that makes them all the bonnier . I used to think they were the golden hills of heaven , about which my mother sang when I was a child , Something about a ship and a lover that should hae been na lover , the ballad was . Well , and near our cottage were rocks . Eh , lasses ! ye do n't know what rocks are in Manchester ! Gray pieces o ' stone as large as a house , all covered over wi ' moss of different colours , some yellow , some brown ; and the ground beneath them knee - deep in purple heather , smelling sae sweet and fragrant , and the low music of the humming - bee for ever sounding among it . Mother used to send Sally and me out to gather ling and heather for besoms , and it was such pleasant work ! We used to come home of an evening loaded so as you could not see us , for all that it was so light to carry . And then mother would make us sit down under the old hawthorn tree ( where we used to make our house among the great roots as stood above th ' ground ) , to pick and tie up the heather . It seems all like yesterday , and yet it 's a long long time agone . Poor sister Sally has been in her grave this forty year and more . But I often wonder if the hawthorn is standing yet , and if the lasses still go to gather heather , as we did many and many a year past and gone . I sicken at heart to see the old spot once again . May be next summer I may set off , if God spares me to see next summer . "
14998	15010	15012	15012	Mary	124	" Why have you never been in all these many years ? "
15014	15416	15012	15012	Mary	124	" Why , lass ! first one wanted me and then another ; and I could n't go without money either , and I got very poor at times . Tom was a scapegrace , poor fellow , and always wanted help of one kind or another ; and his wife ( for I think scapegraces are always married long before steady folk ) was but a helpless kind of body . She were always ailing , and he were always in trouble ; so I had enough to do with my hands and my money too , for that matter . They died within twelvemonth of each other , leaving one lad ( they had had seven , but the Lord had taken six to Himself ) , Will , as I was telling you on ; and I took him myself , and left service to make a bit on a home - place for him , and a fine lad he was , the very spit of his father as to looks , only steadier . For he was steady , although nought would serve him but going to sea . I tried all I could to set him again a sailor 's life . Says I , ' Folks is as sick as dogs all the time they 're at sea . Your own mother telled me ( for she came from foreign parts , being a Manx woman ) that she 'd ha thanked any one for throwing her into the water . ' Nay , I sent him a ' the way to Runcorn by th ' Duke 's canal , that he might know what th ' sea were ; and I looked to see him come back as white as a sheet wi ' vomiting . But the lad went on to Liverpool and saw real ships , and came back more set than ever on being a sailor , and he said as how he had never been sick at all , and thought he could stand the sea pretty well . So I telled him he mun do as he liked ; and he thanked me and kissed me , for all I was very frabbit [ 4 ] with him ; and now he 's gone to South America , at t'other side of the sun , they tell me . "
15544	15605	15524	15524	she	126	" Margaret , thou must let Mary hear thee sing . I do n't know about fine music myself , but folks say Margaret is a rare singer , and I know she can make me cry at any time by singing ' Th ' Owdham Weaver . ' Do sing that , Margaret , there 's a good lass . "
15628	15633	15622	15622	Margaret	136	" The Oldham Weaver ? "
15857	15863	15825	15825	she	136	" Lord , remember David . "
16046	16051	16053	16053	she	126	" That 's grandfather ! "
16055	16074	16053	16053	she	126	" I must be going , for he said he should not be at home till past nine . "
16075	16128	16139	16139	Margaret	136	" Well , I 'll not say nay , for I 've to be up by four for a very heavy wash at Mrs. Simpson 's ; but I shall be terrible glad to see you again at any time , lasses ; and I hope you 'll take to one another . "
16142	16158	16139	16139	Margaret	136	" Just step in and see grandfather . I should like him to see you . "

16706	16711	16713	16714	the man	588	" Oh , yes , "
16716	16725	16713	16714	the man	588	" He does a bit in my way ; "
17038	17047	17049	17049	she	124	" Is your grandfather a fortune - teller ? "
17055	17058	17060	17060	Margaret	136	" No , "
17067	17095	17060	17060	Margaret	136	" but you 're not the first as has taken him for such . He is only fond of such things as most folks know nothing about . "
17096	17107	17060	17060	Margaret	136	" And do you know aught about them , too ? "
17108	17137	17060	17060	Margaret	136	" I know a bit about some of the things grandfather is fond on ; just because he 's fond on 'em I tried to learn about them . "
17138	17144	17146	17146	Mary	124	" What things are these ? "
17220	17471	17206	17206	Margaret	136	" Look , Mary , at this horrid scorpion . He gave me such a fright : I 'm all of a twitter yet when I think of it . Grandfather went to Liverpool one Whitsun - week to go strolling about the docks and pick up what he could from the sailors , who often bring some queer thing or another from the hot countries they go to ; and so he sees a chap with a bottle in his hand , like a druggist 's physic - bottle ; and says grandfather , ' What have ye gotten there ? ' So the sailor holds it up , and grandfather knew it was a rare kind o ' scorpion , not common even in the East Indies where the man came from ; and says he , ' How did ye catch this fine fellow , for he would n't be taken for nothing I 'm thinking ? ' And the man said as how when they were unloading the ship he 'd found him lying behind a bag of rice , and he thought the cold had killed him , for he was not squashed nor injured a bit . He did not like to part with any of the spirit out of his grog to put the scorpion in , but slipped him into the bottle , knowing there were folks enow who would give him something for him . So grandfather gives him a shilling . "
17472	17476	17478	17479	Job Legh	135	" Two shilling , "
17481	17489	17478	17479	Job Legh	135	" and a good bargain it was . "
17490	17695	17206	17206	Margaret	136	" Well ! grandfather came home as proud as Punch , and pulled the bottle out of his pocket . But you see th ' scorpion were doubled up , and grandfather thought I could n't fairly see how big he was . So he shakes him out right before the fire ; and a good warm one it was , for I was ironing , I remember . I left off ironing , and stooped down over him , to look at him better , and grandfather got a book , and began to read how this very kind were the most poisonous and vicious species , how their bite were often fatal , and then went on to read how people who were bitten got swelled , and screamed with pain . I was listening hard , but as it fell out , I never took my eyes off the creature , though I could not ha ' told I was watching it . Suddenly it seemed to give a jerk , and before I could speak , it gave another , and in a minute it was as wild as could be , running at me just like a mad dog . "
17696	17702	17704	17704	Mary	124	" What did you do ? "
17706	17751	17704	17704	Mary	124	" Me ! why , I jumped first on a chair , and then on all the things I 'd been ironing on the dresser , and I screamed for grandfather to come up by me , but he did not hearken to me . "
17752	17777	17206	17206	Margaret	136	" Why , if I 'd come up by thee , who 'd ha ' caught the creature , I should like to know ? "
17778	17933	17206	17206	Margaret	136	" Well , I begged grandfather to crush it , and I had the iron right over it once , ready to drop , but grandfather begged me not to hurt it in that way . So I could n't think what he 'd have , for he hopped round the room as if he were sore afraid , for all he begged me not to injure it . At last he goes to th ' kettle , and lifts up the lid , and peeps in . What on earth is he doing that for , thinks I ; he 'll never drink his tea with a scorpion running free and easy about the room . Then he takes the tongs , and he settles his spectacles on his nose , and in a minute he had lifted the creature up by th ' leg , and dropped him into the boiling water . "
17934	17941	17943	17943	Mary	124	" And did that kill him ? "
17945	18020	17943	17943	Mary	124	" Ay , sure enough ; he boiled for longer time than grandfather liked though . But I was so afeard of his coming round again . I ran to the public - house for some gin , and grandfather filled the bottle , and then we poured off the water , and picked him out of the kettle , and dropped him into the bottle , and he were there above a twelvemonth . "
18021	18030	18032	18032	Mary	124	" What brought him to life at first ? "
18034	18066	18032	18032	Mary	124	" Why , you see , he were never really dead , only torpid — that is , dead asleep with the cold , and our good fire brought him round . "
18067	18079	18081	18081	Mary	124	" I 'm glad father does not care for such things , "
18083	18238	18081	18081	Mary	124	" Are you ! Well , I 'm often downright glad grandfather is so fond of his books , and his creatures , and his plants . It does my heart good to see him so happy , sorting them all at home , and so ready to go in search of more , whenever he 's a spare day . Look at him now ! he 's gone back to his books , and he 'll be as happy as a king , working away till I make him go to bed . It keeps him silent , to be sure ; but so long as I see him earnest , and pleased , and eager , what does that matter ? Then , when he has his talking bouts , you ca n't think how much he has to say . Dear grandfather ! you do n't know how happy we are ! "
18627	18632	18620	18644	who is so convinced of what is " wisest , best , " that in consideration of the end , all difficulties in the way	907	" wisest , best , "
19056	19069	19053	19053	she	136	" For shame of yourself , Jem ! What would Mary say ? "
19076	19086	19070	19070	Lightly	151	" She 'd nobbut say , practice makes perfect . "
19322	19324	19319	19320	John Barton	110	" spunk "
19600	19616	19587	19587	she	136	" Bless me , Margaret ! is that you ? Where are you bound to ? "
19617	19679	19587	19587	she	136	" To nowhere but your own house ( that is , if you 'll take me in ) . I 've a job of work to finish to - night ; mourning , as must be in time for the funeral to - morrow ; and grandfather has been out moss - hunting , and will not be home till late . "
19680	19704	19587	19587	she	136	" Oh , how charming it will be . I 'll help you if you 're backward . Have you much to do ? "
19705	19847	19587	19587	she	136	" Yes , I only got the order yesterday at noon ; and there 's three girls beside the mother ; and what with trying on and matching the stuff ( for there was not enough in the piece they chose first ) , I 'm above a bit behindhand . I 've the skirts all to make . I kept that work till candlelight ; and the sleeves , to say nothing of little bits to the bodies ; for the missis is very particular , and I could scarce keep from smiling while they were crying so , really taking on sadly I 'm sure , to hear first one and then t'other clear up to notice the sit of her gown . They were n't to be misfits I promise you , though they were in such trouble . "
19848	19887	19587	19587	she	136	" Well , Margaret , you 're right welcome as you know , and I 'll sit down and help you with pleasure , though I was tired enough of sewing to - night at Miss Simmonds ' . "
19968	19984	19956	19956	Mary	124	" Who 's it all for , for if you told me I 've forgotten ? "
19985	20034	19956	19956	Mary	124	" Why for Mrs. Ogden as keeps the greengrocer 's shop in Oxford Road . Her husband drank himself to death , and though she cried over him and his ways all the time he was alive , she 's fretted sadly for him now he 's dead . "
20035	20045	20047	20047	Mary	124	" Has he left her much to go upon ? "
20056	20064	20047	20047	Mary	124	" This is beautifully fine soft bombazine . "
20065	20090	19956	19956	Mary	124	" No , I 'm much afeared there 's but little , and there 's several young children , besides the three Miss Ogdens . "
20091	20107	20109	20109	Mary	124	" I should have thought girls like them would ha ' made their own gowns , "
20111	20235	20109	20109	Mary	124	" So I dare say they do , many a one , but now they seem all so busy getting ready for the funeral ; for it 's to be quite a grand affair , well - nigh twenty people to breakfast , as one of the little ones told me ; the little thing seemed to like the fuss , and I do believe it comforted poor Mrs. Ogden to make all the piece o ' work . Such a smell of ham boiling and fowls roasting while I waited in the kitchen ; it seemed more like a wedding nor [ 7 ] a funeral . They said she 'd spend a matter o ' sixty pound on th ' burial . "
20236	20247	20249	20249	Mary	124	" I thought you said she was but badly off , "
20251	20412	20249	20249	Mary	124	" Ay , I know she 's asked for credit at several places , saying her husband laid hands on every farthing he could get for drink . But th ' undertakers urge her on you see , and tell her this thing 's usual , and that thing 's only a common mark of respect , and that every body has t'other thing , till the poor woman has no will o ' her own . I dare say , too , her heart strikes her ( it always does when a person 's gone ) for many a word and many a slighting deed to him , who 's stiff and cold ; and she thinks to make up matters , as it were , by a grand funeral , though she and all her children , too , may have to pinch many a year to pay the expenses , if ever they pay them at all . "
20413	20425	20427	20427	Mary	124	" This mourning , too , will cost a pretty penny , "
20429	20523	20427	20427	Mary	124	" I often wonder why folks wear mourning ; it 's not pretty or becoming ; and it costs a deal of money just when people can spare it least ; and if what the Bible tells us be true , we ought not to be sorry when a friend , who 's been good , goes to his rest ; and as for a bad man , one 's glad enough to get shut [ 8 ] on him . I can not see what good comes out o ' wearing mourning . "
20524	20687	20249	20249	Mary	124	" I 'll tell you what I think th ' fancy was sent for ( Old Alice calls every thing ' sent for , ' and I believe she 's right ) . It does do good , though not as much as it costs , that I do believe , in setting people ( as is cast down by sorrow and feels themselves unable to settle to any thing but crying ) something to do . Why now I told you how they were grieving ; for , perhaps , he was a kind husband and father , in his thoughtless way , when he was n't in liquor . But they cheered up wonderful while I was there , and I asked 'em for more directions than usual , that they might have something to talk over and fix about ; and I left 'em my fashion - book ( though it were two months old ) just a purpose . "
20688	20706	20249	20249	Mary	124	" I do n't think every one would grieve a that way . Old Alice would n't . "
20707	20786	20427	20427	Mary	124	" Old Alice is one in a thousand . I doubt , too , if she would fret much , however sorry she might be . She would say it were sent , and fall to trying to find out what good it were to do . Every sorrow in her mind is sent for good . Did I ever tell you , Mary , what she said one day when she found me taking on about something ? "
20787	20803	20249	20249	Mary	124	" No ; do tell me . What were you fretting about , first place ? "
20804	20818	20249	20249	Mary	124	" I ca n't tell you just now ; perhaps I may sometime . "
20819	20822	20427	20427	Mary	124	" When ? "
20823	20928	20249	20249	Mary	124	" Perhaps this very evening , if it rises in my heart ; perhaps never . It 's a fear that sometimes I ca n't abide to think about , and sometimes I do n't like to think on any thing else . Well , I was fretting about this fear , and Alice comes in for something , and finds me crying . I would not tell her no more than I would you , Mary ; so she says , ' Well , dear , you must mind this , when you 're going to fret and be low about any thing , "
20938	20960	20427	20427	Mary	124	" ' Oh , Mary , I have so often checked my grumbling sin ' [ 9 ] she said that . "
20980	20991	20977	20977	Mary	124	" Do you expect to get paid for this mourning ? "
20992	21080	21081	21081	Margaret	136	" Why I do not much think I shall . I 've thought it over once or twice , and I mean to bring myself to think I sha n't , and to like to do it as my bit towards comforting them . I do n't think they can pay , and yet they 're just the sort of folk to have their minds easier for wearing mourning . There 's only one thing I dislike making black for , it does so hurt the eyes . "
21105	21162	21096	21096	she	136	" You 'll not have to wait long , Mary , for my secret 's on the tip of my tongue . Mary ! do you know I sometimes think I 'm growing a little blind , and then what would become of grandfather and me ? Oh , God help me , Lord help me ! "
21213	21216	21218	21218	Margaret	136	" No , "
21228	21500	21502	21502	she	947	" I know I 'm not mistaken . I have felt one going some time , long before I ever thought what it would lead to ; and last autumn I went to a doctor ; and he did not mince the matter , but said unless I sat in a darkened room , with my hands before me , my sight would not last me many years longer . But how could I do that , Mary ? For one thing , grandfather would have known there was somewhat the matter ; and , oh ! it will grieve him sore whenever he 's told , so the later the better ; and besides , Mary , we 've sometimes little enough to go upon , and what I earn is a great help . For grandfather takes a day here , and a day there , for botanising or going after insects , and he 'll think little enough of four or five shillings for a specimen ; dear grandfather ! and I 'm so loath to think he should be stinted of what gives him such pleasure . So I went to another doctor to try and get him to say something different , and he said , ' Oh , it was only weakness , ' and gived me a bottle of lotion ; but I 've used three bottles ( and each of 'em cost two shillings ) , and my eye is so much worse , not hurting so much , but I ca n't see a bit with it . There now , Mary , "
21508	21526	21502	21502	she	947	" now you only look like a great black shadow , with the edges dancing and sparkling . "
21527	21539	21222	21222	her	136	" And can you see pretty well with th ' other ? "
21540	21660	21502	21502	she	947	" Yes , pretty near as well as ever . Th ' only difference is , that if I sew a long time together , a bright spot like th ' sun comes right where I 'm looking ; all the rest is quite clear but just where I want to see . I 've been to both doctors again , and now they 're both o ' the same story ; and I suppose I 'm going dark as fast as may be . Plain work pays so bad , and mourning has been so plentiful this winter , I were tempted to take in any black work I could ; and now I 'm suffering from it . "
21661	21685	21502	21502	she	947	" And yet , Margaret , you 're going on taking it in ; that 's what you 'd call foolish in another . "
21686	21732	21733	21733	Margaret	136	" It is , Mary ! and yet what can I do ? Folk mun live ; and I think I should go blind any way , and I darn't tell grandfather , else I would leave it off , but he will so fret . "
21744	21748	21749	21749	she	136	" Oh Mary ! "
21752	21960	21749	21749	she	136	" I try to get his face off by heart , and I stare at him so when he 's not looking , and then shut my eyes to see if I can remember his dear face . There 's one thing , Mary , that serves a bit to comfort me . You 'll have heard of old Jacob Butterworth , the singing weaver ? Well , I know'd him a bit , so I went to him , and said how I wished he 'd teach me the right way o ' singing ; and he says I 've a rare fine voice , and I go once a week , and take a lesson fra ' him . He 's been a grand singer in his day . He 's led th ' chorusses at the Festivals , and got thanked many a time by London folk ; and one foreign singer , Madame Catalani , turned round and shook him by th ' hand before the Oud Church [ 10 ] full o ' people . He says I may gain ever so much money by singing ; but I do n't know . Any rate it 's sad work , being blind . "
22004	22009	22011	22011	Mary	124	" Something 's up , "
22033	22055	22013	22013	She	124	" Eh , wench ! donna ye see the fire - light ? Carsons ' mill is blazing away like fun ; "
22062	22104	22058	22059	her informant	953	" Come , Margaret , on wi ' your bonnet , and let 's go to see Carsons ' mill ; it 's afire , and they say a burning mill is such a grand sight . I never saw one . "
22105	22125	22127	22127	Mary	124	" Well , I think it 's a fearful sight . Besides I 've all this work to do . "
22246	22339	22340	22340	He	110	" Carsons ' mill ! Ay , there is a mill on fire somewhere , sure enough , by the light , and it will be a rare blaze , for there 's not a drop o ' water to be got . And much Carsons will care , for they 're well insured , and the machines are a ' th ' oud - fashioned kind . See if they do n't think it a fine thing for themselves . They 'll not thank them as tries to put it out . "
22682	22688	22690	22690	Margaret	136	" What do they say ? "
22715	22726	22728	22728	Mary	124	" There never is anyone in the mill , surely ! "
23061	23067	23069	23069	Margaret	136	" Where are the engines ? "
23074	23118	23069	23069	Margaret	136	" They 're coming , no doubt ; but , bless you , I think it 's bare ten minutes since we first found out th ' fire ; it rages so wi ' this wind , and all so dry - like . "
23119	23128	23130	23130	Mary	124	" Is no one gone for a ladder ? "
23150	23194	23195	23195	Wilson	128	" Ay , Wilson 's son and another man were off like a shot , well nigh five minute agone . But th ' masons , and slaters , and such like , have left their work , and locked up the yards . "
23283	23298	23333	23335	the hushed crowd	1009	" Oh ! let us go home , Margaret ; I can not stay . "
23299	23330	23333	23335	the hushed crowd	1009	" We can not go ! See how we are wedged in by folks . Poor Mary ! ye wo n't hanker after a fire again . Hark ! listen ! "
23369	23373	23375	23375	Margaret	136	" Thank God ! "
23379	23385	23375	23375	Margaret	136	" the engine 's come . "
23441	23454	23456	23456	Margaret	136	" ' Twas young Wilson and a fireman wi ' a ladder , "
23469	23478	23480	23480	Mary	124	" Oh , tell us what you see ? "
23482	23529	23531	23531	he	1012	" They 've gotten it fixed again the gin - shop wall . One o ' the men i ' th ' factory has fell back ; dazed wi ' the smoke , I 'll warrant . The floor 's not given way there . God ! "
23539	23597	23531	23531	he	1012	" th ' ladder 's too short ! It 's a ' over wi ' them , poor chaps . Th ' fire 's coming slow and sure to that end , and afore they 've either gotten water , or another ladder , they 'll be dead out and out . Lord have mercy on them ! "
23657	23684	23613	23614	the crowd	990	" They 've taken th ' ladder into th ' Temple of Apollor . Ca n't press back with it to the yard it came from . "
24026	24032	24041	24041	they	1038	" There he is again ! "
24079	24088	24090	24090	Margaret	136	" It 's Jem Wilson and his father , "
24236	24248	24256	24257	the firemen	1042	" Is the oud man alive , and likely to do ? "

25091	25116	25117	25118	The fireman	1073	" Ask yon fireman , and he 'll tell you more about it than I can . But I know they 're all safe . "
25125	25135	25137	25137	Margaret	136	" Why did you let Jem Wilson go twice ? "
25139	25220	25224	25224	he	1073	" Let!—why we could not hinder him . As soon as ever he 'd heard his father speak ( which he was na long a doing ) , Jem were off like a shot ; only saying he knowed better nor us where to find t'other man . We 'd all ha ' gone , if he had na been in such a hurry , for no one can say as Manchester firemen is ever backward when there 's danger . "
25349	25384	25346	25346	he	1073	" Mary , if my boy comes across you to - night , give him a kind word or two for my sake . Do ! bless you , there 's a good wench . "

26473	26528	26542	26542	Barton	110	" I donnot want it for mysel , tho ' we 've none to spare . But don ye know Ben Davenport as worked at Carsons ' ? He 's down wi ' the fever , and ne'er a stick o ' fire , nor a cowd [ 12 ] potato in the house . "
26529	26540	26542	26542	Barton	110	" I han got no money , I tell ye , "

29308	29322	29225	29225	he	128	" Han [ 16 ] ye had no money fra th ' town ? "
29323	29378	29384	29384	her	4987	" No ; my master is Buckinghamshire born ; and he 's feared the town would send him back to his parish , if he went to th ' board ; so we 've just borne on in hope o ' better times . But I think they 'll never come in my day ; "

29647	29849	29645	29645	Barton	110	" Better nor three year . He 's worked wi ' Carsons that long , and were alway a steady , civil - spoken fellow , though , as I said afore , somewhat of a Methodee . I wish I 'd gotten a letter he sent his missis , a week or two agone , when he were on tramp for work . It did my heart good to read it ; for , yo see , I were a bit grumbling mysel ; it seemed hard to be spunging on Jem , and taking a ' his flesh - meat money to buy bread for me and them as I ought to be keeping . But , yo know , though I can earn nought , I mun eat summut . Well , as I telled ye , I were grumbling , when she ( indicating the sleeping woman by a nod ) brought me Ben 's letter , for she could na read hersel . It were as good as Bible - words ; ne'er a word o ' repining ; a ' about God being our Father , and that we mun bear patiently whate'er He sends . "
29850	29874	29951	29951	he	128	" Don ye think He 's th ' masters ' Father , too ? I 'd be loath to have 'em for brothers . "
29875	29899	29951	29951	he	128	" Eh , John ! donna talk so ; sure there 's many and many a master as good or better nor us . "
29900	29941	29645	29645	Barton	110	" If you think so , tell me this . How comes it they 're rich , and we 're poor ? I 'd like to know that . Han they done as they 'd be done by for us ? "
29974	30205	29957	29958	So Barton	110	" You 'll say ( at least many a one does ) , they'n [ 18 ] getten capital an ' we'n getten none . I say , our labour 's our capital and we ought to draw interest on that . They get interest on their capital somehow a ' this time , while ourn is lying idle , else how could they all live as they do ? Besides , there 's many on 'em as had nought to begin wi ' ; there 's Carsons , and Duncombes , and Mengies , and many another , as comed into Manchester with clothes to their back , and that were all , and now they 're worth their tens of thousands , a ' getten out of our labour ; why the very land as fetched but sixty pound twenty year agone is now worth six hundred , and that , too , is owing to our labour : but look at yo , and see me , and poor Davenport yonder ; whatten better are we ? They'n screwed us down to th ' lowest peg , in order to make their great big fortunes , and build their great big houses , and we , why we 're just clemming , many and many of us . Can you say there 's nought wrong in this ? "
30206	30266	29951	29951	he	128	" Well , Barton , I 'll not gainsay ye . But Mr. Carson spoke to me after th ' fire , and says he , ' I shall ha ' to retrench , and be very careful in my expenditure during these bad times , I assure ye ; ' so yo see th ' masters suffer too . "
30267	30284	30286	30286	Barton	110	" Han they ever seen a child o ' their'n die for want o ' food ? "
30295	30300	30302	30302	he	110	" I donnot mean , "
30304	30376	30302	30302	he	110	" to say as I 'm so badly off . I 'd scorn to speak for mysel ; but when I see such men as Davenport there dying away , for very clemming , I can not stand it . I 've but gotten Mary , and she keeps hersel pretty much . I think we 'll ha ' to give up house - keeping ; but that I donnot mind . "
30943	30953	30927	30927	they	1264	" How late you were last night , Thomas ! "
30954	30990	31005	31006	the housemaid	1276	" Yes , I was right weary of waiting ; they told me to be at the rooms by twelve ; and there I was . But it was two o'clock before they called me . "
30991	31003	31005	31006	the housemaid	1276	" And did you wait all that time in the street ? "
31028	31145	31011	31011	her	1276	" My eye as like ! you do n't think I 'm such a fool as to catch my death of cold , and let the horses catch their death too , as we should ha ' done if we 'd stopped there . No ! I put th ' horses up in th ' stables at th ' Spread Eagle , and went mysel , and got a glass or two by th ' fire . They 're driving a good custom , them , wi ' coachmen . There were five on us , and we 'd many a quart o ' ale , and gin wi ' it , to keep out cold . "
31146	31161	31005	31006	the housemaid	1276	" Mercy on us , Thomas ; you 'll get a drunkard at last ! "
31162	31213	31011	31011	her	1276	" If I do , I know whose blame it will be . It will be missis 's , and not mine . Flesh and blood ca n't sit to be starved to death on a coach - box , waiting for folks as do n't know their own mind . "
31238	31301	31214	31215	A servant	727	" Thomas , you must ride to the fishmonger 's , and say missis ca n't give above half - a - crown a pound for salmon for Tuesday ; she 's grumbling because trade 's so bad . And she 'll want the carriage at three to go to the lecture , Thomas ; at the Royal Execution , you know . "
31302	31310	31005	31006	the housemaid	1276	" Ay , ay , I know . "
31311	31342	31011	31011	her	1276	" And you 'd better all of you mind your P 's and Q 's , for she 's very black this morning . She 's got a bad headache . "
31343	31402	31214	31215	A servant	727	" It 's a pity Miss Jenkins is not here to match her . Lord ! how she and missis did quarrel which had got the worst headaches ; it was that Miss Jenkins left for ; she would not give up having bad headaches , and missis could not abide any one to have 'em but herself . "
31403	31450	31011	31011	her	1276	" Missis will have her breakfast up - stairs , cook , and the cold partridge as was left yesterday , and put plenty of cream in her coffee , and she thinks there 's a roll left , and she would like it well buttered . "
31765	31788	31740	31740	She	170	" I 'm the only lady this morning , papa , so you know you must make a great deal of me . "
31789	31811	31740	31740	She	170	" My darling , I think you have your own way always , whether you 're the only lady or not . "
31812	31854	31740	31740	She	170	" Yes , papa , you 're pretty good and obedient , I must say that ; but I 'm sorry to say Harry is very naughty , and does not do what I tell him ; do you , Harry ? "
31855	31908	31740	31740	She	170	" I 'm sure I do n't know what you mean to accuse me of , Amy ; I expected praise and not blame ; for did not I get you that eau de Portugal from town , that you could not meet with at Hughes ' , you little ungrateful puss ? "
31909	31961	31740	31740	She	170	" Did you ! Oh , sweet Harry ; you 're as sweet as eau de Portugal yourself ; you 're almost as good as papa ; but still you know you did go and forget to ask Bigland for that rose , that new rose they say he has got . "
31962	32006	32051	32051	she	1309	" No , Amy , I did not forget . I asked him , and he has got the Rose , sans reproche ; but do you know , little Miss Extravagance , a very small one is half - a - guinea ? "
32007	32041	32042	32043	Mr. Carson	167	" Oh , I do n't mind . Papa will give it me , wo n't you , dear father ? He knows his little daughter ca n't live without flowers and scents . "
32078	32083	32085	32086	her brother	4783	" Then , Amy , "
32088	32098	32085	32086	her brother	4783	" try and be content with peonies and dandelions . "
32099	32173	32085	32085	her	1309	" Oh , you wretch ! I do n't call them flowers . Besides , you 're every bit as extravagant . Who gave half - a - crown for a bunch of lilies of the valley at Yates ' , a month ago , and then would not let his poor little sister have them , though she went on her knees to beg them ? Answer me that , Master Hal . "
32174	32179	32186	32186	his	4783	" Not on compulsion , "
32210	32217	32219	32220	a servant	727	" If you please , sir , "
32226	32247	32219	32220	a servant	727	" here 's one of the mill people wanting to see you ; his name is Wilson , he says . "
32248	32265	32266	32266	Amy	170	" I 'll come to him directly ; stay , tell him to come in here . "
32324	32340	32294	32294	he	1316	" Well , Wilson , and what do you want to - day , man ? "
32341	32369	32294	32294	he	1316	" Please , sir , Davenport 's ill of the fever , and I 'm come to know if you 've got an Infirmary order for him ? "
32370	32387	32294	32294	he	1316	" Davenport — Davenport ; who is the fellow ? I do n't know the name . "
32388	32402	32294	32294	he	1316	" He 's worked in your factory better nor three year , sir . "
32403	32435	32294	32294	he	1316	" Very likely ; I do n't pretend to know the names of the men I employ ; that I leave to the overlooker . So he 's ill , eh ? "
32436	32457	32294	32294	he	1316	" Ay , sir , he 's very bad ; we want to get him in at the fever wards . "
32496	32589	32483	32483	I	0	" So saying , he rose up , unlocked a drawer , pondered a minute , and then gave Wilson an out - patient 's order to be presented the following Monday . Monday ! How many days there were before Monday ! Meanwhile , the younger Mr. Carson had ended his review , and began to listen to what was going on . He finished his breakfast , got up , and pulled five shillings out of his pocket , which he gave to Wilson as he passed him , for the "
32593	32808	32483	32483	I	0	" He went past quickly , and calling for his horse , mounted gaily , and rode away . He was anxious to be in time to have a look and a smile from lovely Mary Barton , as she went to Miss Simmonds ' . But to - day he was to be disappointed . Wilson left the house , not knowing whether to be pleased or grieved . It was long to Monday , but they had all spoken kindly to him , and who could tell if they might not remember this , and do something before Monday . Besides , the cook , who , when she had had time to think , after breakfast was sent in , had noticed his paleness , had had meat and bread ready to put in his hand when he came out of the parlour ; and a full stomach makes every one of us more hopeful . When he reached Berry Street , he had persuaded himself he bore good news , and felt almost elated in his heart . But it fell when he opened the cellar - door , and saw Barton and the wife both bending over the sick man 's couch with awe - struck , saddened look . "
32812	32816	32889	32889	yo	1322	" said Barton . "
32833	32881	32882	32882	He	1321	" Wilson looked . The flesh was sunk , the features prominent , bony , and rigid . The fearful clay - colour of death was over all . But the eyes were open and sensible , though the films of the grave were settling upon them . "
32935	33058	32923	32923	she	413	" Most probably , as they all felt , he could not speak , for his strength was fast ebbing . They stood round him still and silent ; even the wife checked her sobs , though her heart was like to break . She held her child to her breast , to try and keep him quiet . Their eyes were all fixed on the yet living one , whose moments of life were passing so rapidly away . At length he brought ( with jerking , convulsive effort ) his two hands into the attitude of prayer . They saw his lips move , and bent to catch the words , which came in gasps , and not in tones . "
33076	33077	33080	33080	Ben	160	" "
33084	33090	33100	33100	Ben	160	" wailed forth his wife , "
33114	33351	33102	33102	Ben	160	" He could not speak again . The trump of the archangel would set his tongue free ; but not a word more would it utter till then . Yet he heard , he understood , and though sight failed , he moved his hand gropingly over the covering . They knew what he meant , and guided it to her head , bowed and hidden in her hands , when she had sunk in her woe . It rested there , with a feeble pressure of endearment . The face grew beautiful , as the soul neared God . A peace beyond understanding came over it . The hand was a heavy , stiff weight on the wife 's head . No more grief or sorrow for him . They reverently laid out the corpse — Wilson fetching his only spare shirt to array it in . The wife still lay hidden in the clothes , in a stupor of agony . There was a knock at the door , and Barton went to open it . It was Mary , who had received a message from her father , through a neighbour , telling her where he was ; and she had set out early to come and have a word with him before her day 's work ; but some errands she had to do for Miss Simmonds had detained her until now . "
33357	33362	33355	33355	wench	5030	" said her father . "
33382	33510	33380	33380	her	1328	" Mary did not know what to say , or how to comfort ; but she knelt down by her , and put her arm round her neck , and in a little while fell to crying herself so bitterly , that the source of tears was opened by sympathy in the widow , and her full heart was , for a time , relieved . And Mary forgot all purposed meeting with her gay lover , Harry Carson ; forgot Miss Simmonds ' errands , and her anger , in the anxious desire to comfort the poor lone woman . Never had her sweet face looked more angelic , never had her gentle voice seemed so musical as when she murmured her broken sentences of comfort . "
33592	34039	33572	33572	he	1329	" And she ended by crying herself , as passionately as the poor widow . It was agreed that the town must bury him ; he had paid to a burial club as long as he could ; but by a few weeks ' omission , he had forfeited his claim to a sum of money now . Would Mrs. Davenport and the little child go home with Mary ? The latter brightened up as she urged this plan ; but no ! where the poor , fondly loved remains were , there would the mourner be ; and all that they could do was to make her as comfortable as their funds would allow , and to beg a neighbour to look in and say a word at times . So she was left alone with her dead , and they went to work that had work , and he who had none , took upon him the arrangements for the funeral . Mary had many a scolding from Miss Simmonds that day for her absence of mind . To be sure Miss Simmonds was much put out by Mary 's non - appearance in the morning with certain bits of muslin , and shades of silk which were wanted to complete a dress to be worn that night ; but it was true enough that Mary did not mind what she was about ; she was too busy planning how her old black gown ( her best when her mother died ) might be spunged , and turned , and lengthened into something like decent mourning for the widow . And when she went home at night ( though it was very late , as a sort of retribution for her morning 's negligence ) , she set to work at once , and was so busy , and so glad over her task , that she had , every now and then , to check herself in singing merry ditties , that she felt little accorded with the sewing on which she was engaged . So when the funeral day came , Mrs. Davenport was neatly arrayed in black , a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst of her sorrow . Barton and Wilson both accompanied her , as she led her two elder boys , and followed the coffin . It was a simple walking funeral , with nothing to grate on the feelings of any ; far more in accordance with its purpose , to my mind , than the gorgeous hearses , and nodding plumes , which form the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people . There was no "
34047	34441	33572	33572	he	1329	" of the pauper 's funeral . Decently and quietly was he followed to the grave by one determined to endure her woe meekly for his sake . The only mark of pauperism attendant on the burial concerned the living and joyous , far more than the dead , or the sorrowful . When they arrived in the churchyard , they halted before a raised and handsome tombstone ; in reality a wooden mockery of stone respectabilities which adorned the burial - ground . It was easily raised in a very few minutes , and below was the grave in which pauper bodies were piled until within a foot or two of the surface ; when the soil was shovelled over , and stamped down , and the wooden cover went to do temporary duty over another hole . [ 19 ] But little they recked of this who now gave up their dead . The ghoul - like fever was not to be braved with impunity , and baulked of its prey . The widow had reclaimed her children ; her neighbours , in the good Samaritan sense of the word , had paid her little arrears of rent , and made her a few shillings beforehand with the world . She determined to flit from that cellar to another less full of painful associations , less haunted by mournful memories . The board , not so formidable as she had imagined , had inquired into her case ; and , instead of sending her to Stoke Claypole , her husband 's Buckinghamshire parish , as she had dreaded , had agreed to pay her rent . So food for four mouths was all she was now required to find ; only for three she would have said ; for herself and the unweaned child were but reckoned as one in her calculation . She had a strong heart , now her bodily strength had been recruited by a week or two of food , and she would not despair . So she took in some little children to nurse , who brought their daily food with them , which she cooked for them , without wronging their helplessness of a crumb ; and when she had restored them to their mothers at night , she set to work at plain sewing , "
34450	35155	33572	33572	he	1329	" and sat thinking how she might best cheat the factory inspector , and persuade him that her strong , big , hungry Ben was above thirteen . Her plan of living was so far arranged , when she heard , with keen sorrow , that Wilson 's twin lads were ill of the fever . They had never been strong . They were like many a pair of twins , and seemed to have but one life divided between them . One life , one strength , and in this instance , I might almost say , one brain ; for they were helpless , gentle , silly children , but not the less dear to their parents and to their strong , active , manly , elder brother . They were late on their feet , late in talking , late every way ; had to be nursed and cared for when other lads of their age were tumbling about in the street , and losing themselves , and being taken to the police - office miles away from home . Still want had never yet come in at the door to make love for these innocents fly out at the window . Nor was this the case even now , when Jem Wilson 's earnings , and his mother 's occasional charrings were barely sufficient to give all the family their fill of food . But when the twins , after ailing many days , and caring little for their meat , fell sick on the same afternoon , with the same heavy stupor of suffering , the three hearts that loved them so , each felt , though none acknowledged to the other , that they had little chance for life . It was nearly a week before the tale of their illness spread as far as the court where the Wilsons had once dwelt , and the Bartons yet lived . Alice had heard of the illness of her little nephews several days before , and had locked her cellar door , and gone off straight to her brother 's house , in Ancoats ; but she was often absent for days , sent for , as her neighbours knew , to help in some sudden emergency of illness or distress , so that occasioned no surprise . Margaret met Jem Wilson several days after his brothers were seriously ill , and heard from him the state of things at his home . She told Mary of it as she entered the court late that evening ; and Mary listened with saddened heart to the strange contrast which such woeful tidings presented to the gay and loving words she had been hearing on her walk home . She blamed herself for being so much taken up with visions of the golden future , that she had lately gone but seldom on Sunday afternoons , or other leisure time , to see Mrs. Wilson , her mother 's friend ; and with hasty purpose of amendment she only stayed to leave a message for her father with the next - door neighbour , and then went off at a brisk pace on her way to the house of mourning . She stopped with her hand on the latch of the Wilsons ' door , to still her beating heart , and listened to the hushed quiet within . She opened the door softly : there sat Mrs. Wilson in the old rocking - chair , with one sick , death - like boy lying on her knee , crying without let or pause , but softly , gently , as fearing to disturb the troubled , gasping child ; while behind her , old Alice let her fast - dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin , which she was laying out on a board , placed on a sort of sofa - settee in a corner of the room . Over the child , which yet breathed , the father bent , watching anxiously for some ground of hope , where hope there was none . Mary stepped slowly and lightly across to Alice . "
35169	35199	35161	35161	God	116	" Mary could not speak ; she did not know what to say ; it was so much worse than she expected . At last she ventured to whisper , "
35212	35323	35324	35324	We	1334	" Alice shook her head , and told with a look that she believed there was none . She next endeavoured to lift the little body , and carry it to its old accustomed bed in its parents ' room . But earnest as the father was in watching the yet - living , he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead , and sprang gently up , and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength , and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him . The other child gasped longer , louder , with more of effort . "
35343	35344	35338	35338	she	666	" "
35348	35358	35338	35338	she	666	" said Mary , in a tone of inquiry . "
35442	35530	35541	35541	Alice	126	" So without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking child . But the mother would not let him go , and looking in Alice 's face with brimming and imploring eyes , declared in earnest whispers , that she was not wishing him , that she would fain have him released from his suffering . Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child , whose struggles seemed to increase , till at last his mother said with a choking voice , "
35595	35732	35753	35753	he	128	" She bent down , and fondly , oh ! with what passionate fondness , kissed her child , and then gave him up to Alice , who took him with tender care . Nature 's struggles were soon exhausted , and he breathed his little life away in peace . Then the mother lifted up her voice and wept . Her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers . Again Alice laid out the dead , Mary helping with reverent fear . The father and mother carried him up - stairs to the bed , where his little brother lay in calm repose . Mary and Alice drew near the fire , and stood in quiet sorrow for some time . Then Alice broke the silence by saying , "
35749	35750	35739	35739	Jem	128	" "
35755	35759	35753	35753	he	128	" asked Mary . "
35801	35815	35816	35816	I	0	" Again they were silent in thought , and again Alice spoke first . "
36127	36366	36367	36367	They	1359	" So saying , she fell to tidying the room , removing as much as she could every vestige of sickness ; making up the fire , and setting on the kettle for a cup of tea for her sister - in - law , whose low moans and sobs were occasionally heard in the room below . Mary helped her in all these little offices . They were busy in this way when the door was softly opened , and Jem came in , all grimed and dirty from his night - work , his soiled apron wrapped round his middle , in guise and apparel in which he would have been sorry at another time to have been seen by Mary . But just now he hardly saw her ; he went straight up to Alice , and asked how the little chaps were . They had been a shade better at dinner - time , and he had been working away through the long afternoon , and far into the night , in the belief that they had taken the turn . He had stolen out during the half - hour allowed at the works for tea , to buy them an orange or two , which now puffed out his jacket - pocket . He would make his aunt speak ; he would not understand her shakes of the head and fast coursing tears . "
36372	36376	36367	36367	They	1359	" said she . "
36379	36380	36367	36367	They	1359	" "
36409	36410	36404	36404	Will	128	" "
36413	36414	36417	36417	lad	1361	" "
36452	36557	36444	36444	Ye	1361	" Jem went to the cupboard , and quietly extricated from his pocket the oranges he had bought . But he stayed long there , and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony . The two women were frightened , as women always are , on witnessing a man 's overpowering grief . They cried afresh in company . Mary 's heart melted within her as she witnessed Jem 's sorrow , and she stepped gently up to the corner where he stood , with his back turned to them , and putting her hand softly on his arm , said , "
36576	36680	36568	36568	I	0	" Jem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart , and knew the power she had of comforting him . He did not speak , as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment , when her soft hand 's touch thrilled through his frame , and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear . Yes ! it might be very wrong ; he could almost hate himself for it ; with death and woe so surrounding him , it yet was happiness , was bliss , to be so spoken to by Mary . "
36690	36737	36738	36738	Mary	124	" whispered she again , believing that his silence was only another form of grief . He could not contain himself . He took her hand in his firm yet trembling grasp , and said , in tones that instantly produced a revulsion in her mood , "
36802	36866	36782	36782	Mary	124	" She did know — he was right there . But as he turned to catch a look at her sweet face , he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress , almost amounting to vexation ; a dread of him , that he thought was almost repugnance . He let her hand go , and she quickly went away to Alice 's side . "
36907	37159	36898	36898	she	1366	" Partly to relieve her from his presence , and partly from natural desire , and partly , perhaps , from a penitent wish to share to the utmost his parents ' sorrow , he soon went up - stairs to the chamber of death . Mary mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she performed through the remainder of that long night , but she did not see Jem again . He remained up - stairs until after the early dawn showed Mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet streets , to try and get a little sleep before work hour . So leaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson , and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem , and deciding that she had better not , she stepped out into the bright morning light , so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been . Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes ; and whether it was this , or the broad daylight that poured in through the sky - window , or whether it was over - excitement , it was long before she could catch a wink of sleep . Her thoughts ran on Jem 's manner and words ; not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day ; but still she wished he had not put it so plainly . "
37163	37169	36898	36898	she	1366	" said she to herself , "
37469	38386	37465	37465	I	0	" So she turned on her pillow , and fell asleep , and dreamt of what was often in her waking thoughts ; of the day when she should ride from church in her carriage , with wedding - bells ringing , and take up her astonished father , and drive away from the old dim work - a - day court for ever , to live in a grand house , where her father should have newspapers , and pamphlets , and pipes , and meat dinners every day,—and all day long if he liked . Such thoughts mingled in her predilection for the handsome young Mr. Carson , who , unfettered by work - hours , let scarcely a day pass without contriving a meeting with the beautiful little milliner he had first seen while lounging in a shop where his sisters were making some purchases , and afterwards never rested till he had freely , though respectfully , made her acquaintance in her daily walks . He was , to use his own expression to himself , quite infatuated by her , and was restless each day till the time came when he had a chance , and , of late , more than a chance of meeting her . There was something of keen practical shrewdness about her , which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple , foolish , unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which Miss Simmonds ' young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other . Yes ! Mary was ambitious , and did not favour Mr. Carson the less because he was rich and a gentleman . The old leaven , infused years ago by her aunt Esther , fermented in her little bosom , and perhaps all the more , for her father 's aversion to the rich and the gentle . Such is the contrariness of the human heart , from Eve downwards , that we all , in our old - Adam state , fancy things forbidden sweetest . So Mary dwelt upon and enjoyed the idea of some day becoming a lady , and doing all the elegant nothings appertaining to ladyhood . It was a comfort to her , when scolded by Miss Simmonds , to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage , to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker . It was a pleasure to her to hear the general admiration of the two elder Miss Carsons , acknowledged beauties in ball - room and street , on horseback and on foot , and to think of the time when she should ride and walk with them in loving sisterhood . But the best of her plans , the holiest , that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest , were those relating to her father ; her dear father , now oppressed with care , and always a disheartened , gloomy person . How she would surround him with every comfort she could devise ( of course , he was to live with them ) , till he should acknowledge riches to be very pleasant things , and bless his lady - daughter ! Every one who had shown her kindness in her low estate should then be repaid a hundred - fold . Such were the castles in air , the Alnaschar - visions in which Mary indulged , and which she was doomed in after days to expiate with many tears . Meanwhile , her words — or , even more , her tones — would maintain their hold on Jem Wilson 's memory . A thrill would yet come over him when he remembered how her hand had rested on his arm . The thought of her mingled with all his grief , and it was profound , for the loss of his brothers . One Sunday afternoon , about three weeks after that mournful night , Jem Wilson set out with the ostensible purpose of calling on John Barton . He was dressed in his best , his Sunday suit of course ; while his face glittered with the scrubbing he had bestowed on it . His dark black hair had been arranged and re - arranged before the household looking - glass , and in his button - hole he stuck a narcissus ( a sweet Nancy is its pretty Lancashire name ) , hoping it would attract Mary 's notice , so that he might have the delight of giving it her . It was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that Mary saw him some minutes before he came into her father 's house . She was sitting at the end of the dresser , with the little window - blind drawn on one side , in order that she might see the passers - by , in the intervals of reading her Bible , which lay open before her . So she watched all the greeting a friend gave Jem ; she saw the face of condolence , the sympathetic shake of the hand , and had time to arrange her own face and manner before Jem came in , which he did , as if he had eyes for no one but her father , who sat smoking his pipe by the fire , while he read an old "
38390	38681	37465	37465	I	0	" borrowed from a neighbouring public - house . Then he turned to Mary , who , he felt by the sure instinct of love , by which almost his body thought , was present . Her hands were busy adjusting her dress ; a forced and unnecessary movement Jem could not help thinking . Her accost was quiet and friendly , if grave ; she felt that she reddened like a rose , and wished she could prevent it , while Jem wondered if her blushes arose from fear , or anger , or love . She was very cunning , I am afraid . She pretended to read diligently , and not to listen to a word that was said , while , in fact , she heard all sounds , even to Jem 's long , deep sighs , which wrung her heart . At last she took up her Bible , and as if their conversation disturbed her , went up - stairs to her little room . And she had scarcely spoken a word to Jem ; scarcely looked at him ; never noticed his beautiful sweet Nancy , which only awaited her least word of praise to be hers ! He did not know — that pang was spared — that in her little dingy bed - room , stood a white jug , filled with a luxuriant bunch of early spring roses , making the whole room fragrant and bright . They were the gift of her richer lover . So Jem had to go on sitting with John Barton , fairly caught in his own trap , and had to listen to his talk , and answer him as best he might . "
38708	38709	37465	37465	I	0	" "
38719	38723	37465	37465	I	0	" asked Jem . "
38770	38771	38752	38752	I	0	" "
38774	38780	38752	38752	I	0	" said Jem , listlessly . "
39071	39097	39061	39061	he	1388	" Jem was pondering Mary 's conduct ; but the pause made him aware he ought to utter some civil listening noise ; so he said "
39101	39102	39061	39061	he	1388	" "
39182	39214	39180	39180	Jem	128	" Jem was very willing to take it , but did not express the curiosity he should have done . So John Barton thought he 'd try another hint or two . "
39267	40444	39264	39265	higher folk	1395	" Still Jem was not curious . He gave up hope of seeing Mary again by her own good free will ; and the next best thing would be , to be alone to think of her . So , muttering something which he meant to serve as an excuse for his sudden departure , he hastily wished John good afternoon , and left him to resume his pipe and his politics . For three years past , trade had been getting worse and worse , and the price of provisions higher and higher . This disparity between the amount of the earnings of the working classes and the price of their food , occasioned , in more cases than could well be imagined , disease and death . Whole families went through a gradual starvation . They only wanted a Dante to record their sufferings . And yet even his words would fall short of the awful truth ; they could only present an outline of the tremendous facts of the destitution that surrounded thousands upon thousands in the terrible years 1839 , 1840 , and 1841 . Even philanthropists who had studied the subject , were forced to own themselves perplexed in their endeavour to ascertain the real causes of the misery ; the whole matter was of so complicated a nature , that it became next to impossible to understand it thoroughly . It need excite no surprise then to learn that a bad feeling between working - men and the upper classes became very strong in this season of privation . The indigence and sufferings of the operatives induced a suspicion in the minds of many of them , that their legislators , their magistrates , their employers , and even the ministers of religion , were , in general , their oppressors and enemies ; and were in league for their prostration and enthralment . The most deplorable and enduring evil that arose out of the period of commercial depression to which I refer , was this feeling of alienation between the different classes of society . It is so impossible to describe , or even faintly to picture , the state of distress which prevailed in the town at that time , that I will not attempt it ; and yet I think again that surely , in a Christian land , it was not known even so feebly as words could tell it , or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged with their sympathy and their aid . In many instances the sufferers wept first , and then they cursed . Their vindictive feelings exhibited themselves in rabid politics . And when I hear , as I have heard , of the sufferings and privations of the poor , of provision shops where ha'porths of tea , sugar , butter , and even flour , were sold to accommodate the indigent,—of parents sitting in their clothes by the fire - side during the whole night for seven weeks together , in order that their only bed and bedding might be reserved for the use of their large family,—of others sleeping upon the cold hearth - stone for weeks in succession , without adequate means of providing themselves with food or fuel ( and this in the depth of winter),—of others being compelled to fast for days together , uncheered by any hope of better fortune , living , moreover , or rather starving , in a crowded garret , or damp cellar , and gradually sinking under the pressure of want and despair into a premature grave ; and when this has been confirmed by the evidence of their care - worn looks , their excited feelings , and their desolate homes,—can I wonder that many of them , in such times of misery and destitution , spoke and acted with ferocious precipitation ? An idea was now springing up among the operatives , that originated with the Chartists , but which came at last to be cherished as a darling child by many and many a one . They could not believe that government knew of their misery ; they rather chose to think it possible that men could voluntarily assume the office of legislators for a nation , ignorant of its real state ; as who should make domestic rules for the pretty behaviour of children , without caring to know that those children had been kept for days without food . Besides , the starving multitudes had heard , that the very existence of their distress had been denied in Parliament ; and though they felt this strange and inexplicable , yet the idea that their misery had still to be revealed in all its depths , and that then some remedy would be found , soothed their aching hearts , and kept down their rising fury . So a petition was framed , and signed by thousands in the bright spring days of 1839 , imploring Parliament to hear witnesses who could testify to the unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing districts . Nottingham , Sheffield , Glasgow , Manchester , and many other towns , were busy appointing delegates to convey this petition , who might speak , not merely of what they had seen , and had heard , but from what they had borne and suffered . Life - worn , gaunt , anxious , hunger - stamped men , were those delegates . One of them was John Barton . He would have been ashamed to own the flutter of spirits his appointment gave him . There was the childish delight of seeing London — that went a little way , and but a little way . There was the vain idea of speaking out his notions before so many grand folk — that went a little further ; and last , there was the really pure gladness of heart , arising from the idea that he was one of those chosen to be instruments in making known the distresses of the people , and consequently in procuring them some grand relief , by means of which they should never suffer want or care any more . He hoped largely , but vaguely , of the results of his expedition . An argosy of the precious hopes of many otherwise despairing creatures , was that petition to be heard concerning their sufferings . The night before the morning on which the Manchester delegates were to leave for London , Barton might be said to hold a levée , so many neighbours came dropping in . Job Legh had early established himself and his pipe by John Barton 's fire , not saying much , but puffing away , and imagining himself of use in adjusting the smoothing - irons that hung before the fire , ready for Mary when she should want them . As for Mary , her employment was the same as that of Beau Tibbs ' wife , "
40453	40514	39264	39265	higher folk	1395	" in the pantry back - kitchen ; for she was anxious about his appearance in London . ( The coat had been redeemed , though the silk handkerchief was forfeited . ) The door stood open , as usual , between the houseplace and back - kitchen , so she gave her greeting to their friends as they entered . "
40527	40531	40525	40525	yo	110	" said one . "
40540	40551	40536	40536	I	0	" answered John , yielding to necessity as it were . "
40627	40628	40608	40608	they	1398	" "
40665	40666	40657	40657	many	1038	" "
40706	40707	40708	40708	Machines	186	" "
40717	40723	40708	40708	Machines	186	" chimed in several voices . "
40728	40750	40725	40725	my	0	" said a shivering , half - clad man , who crept near the fire , as if ague - stricken , "
40800	40874	40798	40798	ye	110	" Barton was saved the necessity of answering , by the entrance of Mrs. Davenport , the poor widow he had been so kind to ; she looked half - fed , and eager , but was decently clad . In her hand she brought a little newspaper parcel , which she took to Mary , who opened it , and then called out , dangling a shirt collar from her soapy fingers : "
40909	40910	40888	40889	Mrs. Davenport	175	" "
40915	40925	40913	40913	Mary	124	" said Mrs. Davenport , in a low voice . "
40963	40964	40948	40948	I	0	" "
40983	41001	40974	40974	I	0	" So Mrs. Davenport became a listener to the conversation ; and after a while joined in . "
41183	41184	41185	41185	I	0	" "
41196	41206	41211	41211	him	160	" said a pompous , careful - speaking man , "
41354	41380	41381	41381	I	0	" Job Legh now put in his word . Taking the pipe out of his mouth , and addressing the last speaker , he said : "
41528	41549	41550	41550	I	0	" He put his pipe in his mouth again , and redoubled his puffing to make up for lost time . "
41556	41561	41550	41550	I	0	" said John Barton , "
41735	41761	41731	41731	Parliament	184	" Some shook their heads , but more looked cheery ; and then one by one dropped off , leaving John and his daughter alone . "
41771	41806	41763	41763	thou	1453	" asked he , as they wound up their hard day 's work by a supper eaten over the fire , which glowed and glimmered through the room , and formed their only light . "
41842	41843	41834	41834	she	127	" "
41869	41870	41860	41867	a girl as e'er a one in Manchester	1456	" "
41876	41877	41878	41878	She	127	" "
42084	43276	42074	42074	I	0	" And so he went to bed , the fear of forthcoming sorrow to his friend mingling with his thoughts of to - morrow , and his hopes for the future . Mary watched him set off , with her hands over her eyes to shade them from the bright slanting rays of the morning sun , and then she turned into the house to arrange its disorder before going to her work . She wondered if she should like or dislike the evening and morning solitude ; for several hours when the clock struck she thought of her father , and wondered where he was ; she made good resolutions according to her lights ; and by - and - bye came the distractions and events of the broad full day to occupy her with the present , and to deaden the memory of the absent . One of Mary 's resolutions was , that she would not be persuaded or induced to see Mr. Harry Carson during her father 's absence . There was something crooked in her conscience after all ; for this very resolution seemed an acknowledgment that it was wrong to meet him at any time ; and yet she had brought herself to think her conduct quite innocent and proper , for although unknown to her father , and certain , even did he know it , to fail of obtaining his sanction , she esteemed her love - meetings with Mr. Carson as sure to end in her father 's good and happiness . But now that he was away , she would do nothing that he would disapprove of ; no , not even though it was for his own good in the end . Now , amongst Miss Simmonds ' young ladies was one who had been from the beginning a confidant in Mary 's love affair , made so by Mr. Carson himself . He had felt the necessity of some third person to carry letters and messages , and to plead his cause when he was absent . In a girl named Sally Leadbitter he had found a willing advocate . She would have been willing to have embarked in a love - affair herself ( especially a clandestine one ) , for the mere excitement of the thing ; but her willingness was strengthened by sundry half - sovereigns , which from time to time Mr. Carson bestowed upon her . Sally Leadbitter was vulgar - minded to the last degree ; never easy unless her talk was of love and lovers ; in her eyes it was an honour to have had a long list of wooers . So constituted , it was a pity that Sally herself was but a plain , red - haired , freckled girl ; never likely , one would have thought , to become a heroine on her own account . But what she lacked in beauty she tried to make up for by a kind of witty boldness , which gave her what her betters would have called piquancy . Considerations of modesty or propriety never checked her utterance of a good thing . She had just talent enough to corrupt others . Her very good - nature was an evil influence . They could not hate one who was so kind ; they could not avoid one who was so willing to shield them from scrapes by any exertion of her own ; whose ready fingers would at any time make up for their deficiencies , and whose still more convenient tongue would at any time invent for them . The Jews , or Mohammedans ( I forget which ) , believe that there is one little bone of our body , one of the vertebræ , if I remember rightly , which will never decay and turn to dust , but will lie incorrupt and indestructible in the ground until the Last Day : this is the Seed of the Soul . The most depraved have also their Seed of the Holiness that shall one day overcome their evil , their one good quality , lurking hidden , but safe , among all the corrupt and bad . Sally 's seed of the future soul was her love for her mother , an aged bedridden woman . For her she had self - denial ; for her , her good - nature rose into tenderness ; to cheer her lonely bed , her spirits , in the evenings when her body was often woefully tired , never flagged , but were ready to recount the events of the day , to turn them into ridicule , and to mimic , with admirable fidelity , any person gifted with an absurdity who had fallen under her keen eye . But the mother was lightly principled like Sally herself ; nor was there need to conceal from her the reason why Mr. Carson gave her so much money . She chuckled with pleasure , and only hoped that the wooing would be long a - doing . Still neither she , nor her daughter , nor Harry Carson liked this resolution of Mary , not to see him during her father 's absence . One evening ( and the early summer evenings were long and bright now ) , Sally met Mr. Carson by appointment , to be charged with a letter for Mary , imploring her to see him , which Sally was to back with all her powers of persuasion . After parting from him she determined , as it was not so very late , to go at once to Mary 's , and deliver the message and letter . She found Mary in great sorrow . She had just heard of George Wilson 's sudden death : her old friend , her father 's friend , Jem 's father — all his claims came rushing upon her . Though not guarded from unnecessary sight or sound of death , as the children of the rich are , yet it had so often been brought home to her this last three or four months . It was so terrible thus to see friend after friend depart . Her father , too , who had dreaded Jane Wilson 's death the evening before he set off . And she , the weakly , was left behind while the strong man was taken . At any rate the sorrow her father had so feared for him was spared . Such were the thoughts which came over her . She could not go to comfort the bereaved , even if comfort were in her power to give ; for she had resolved to avoid Jem ; and she felt that this of all others was not the occasion on which she could keep up a studiously cold manner . And in this shock of grief , Sally Leadbitter was the last person she wished to see . However , she rose to welcome her , betraying her tear - swollen face . "
43310	43311	43299	43299	he	167	" "
43317	43329	43299	43299	he	167	" said Mary , with a toss of her pretty head . "
43399	43408	43396	43397	the children	519	" ( opening her arms very wide ) . "
43411	43417	43396	43397	the children	519	" said Mary , pouting ; "
43429	43430	43421	43421	I	0	" "
43448	43452	43432	43432	I	0	" asked Sally . "
43457	43461	43454	43454	you	0	" replied Mary . "
43477	43544	43465	43465	I	0	" weeping afresh . But Sally did not like to be the bearer of any such news . She saw she had gone on the wrong tack , and that Mary 's heart was too full to value either message or letter as she ought . So she wisely paused in their delivery , and said in a more sympathetic tone than she had heretofore used , "
43568	43569	43565	43565	you	124	" "
43579	43606	43570	43571	George Wilson	129	" said Mary , fixing her eyes for one minute on Sally , and the next hiding her face in her apron as she sobbed anew . "
43666	43667	43668	43668	I	0	" "
43676	43702	43668	43668	I	0	" said Mary , sharply ; for she did know , and did not like to have her dear , simple Alice so spoken of . "

43805	43806	43793	43793	she	126	" "

43897	43905	43906	43906	My	0	" said Mary , turning very red . "
43922	43923	43911	43911	I	0	" "
43930	43984	43928	43928	me	0	" said Mary , impatiently , and anxious in her present mood for her visitor 's departure . Sally relinquished it unwillingly . She had , however , the pleasure of seeing Mary dimple and blush as she read the letter , which seemed to say the writer was not indifferent to her . "
43994	44004	44005	44005	I	0	" said Mary , raising her eyes at last . "
44023	44024	44019	44019	I	0	" "

44223	44270	44217	44218	Margaret Jennings	136	" And in an instant Margaret was in the room . Mary had begged Job Legh to let her come and sleep with her . In the uncertain fire - light you could not help noticing that she had the groping walk of a blind person . "
44279	44283	44277	44277	Mary	124	" said Sally . "
44291	44292	44287	44287	your	0	" "
44301	44319	44287	44287	your	0	" She shut the door gladly on her unwelcome visitor — unwelcome at that time at least . "

44458	44459	44450	44450	ye	136	" "

44626	44630	44622	44622	you	0	" asked Mary . "

45115	45122	45113	45113	Mary	124	" said Margaret , half smiling , "
45331	45402	45313	45313	he	4937	" Margaret sighed , in spite of her cheerful and relieved tone . Though Mary caught the sigh , she felt it was better to let it pass without notice , and began , with the tact which true sympathy rarely fails to supply , to ask a variety of questions respecting her friend 's musical debut , which tended to bring out more distinctly how successful it had been . "
45407	45413	45405	45405	Margaret	136	" at length she exclaimed , "
45447	45448	45444	45444	her	1527	" "
45455	45463	45444	45444	her	1527	" said Margaret , with a smile . "
45535	45567	45517	45517	I	0	" Nay , do n't stop ; or else give me something a bit more new , for somehow I never quite liked that part about thinking o ' Donald mair . "
45568	45819	45820	45820	She	1534	" Well , though I 'm a bit tir'd , I do n't care if I do . Before I come , I were practising well nigh upon two hours this one which I 'm to sing o ' Thursday . Th ' lecturer said he were sure it would just suit me , and I should do justice to it ; and I should be right sorry to disappoint him , he were so nice and encouraging like to me . Eh ! Mary , what a pity there is n't more o ' that way , and less scolding and rating i ' th ' world ! It would go a vast deal further . Beside , some o ' th ' singers said they were a'most certain it were a song o ' his own , because he were so fidgetty and particular about it , and so anxious I should give it th ' proper expression . And that makes me care still more . Th ' first verse , he said , were to be sung ' tenderly , but joyously ! ' I 'm afraid I do n't quite hit that , but I 'll try . Now it falls into th ' minor key , and must be very sad like . I feel as if I could do that better than t'other . Margaret certainly made the most of this little song . As a factory worker , listening outside , observed , "
45829	45917	45820	45820	She	1534	" And if she only sang it at the Mechanics ' with half the feeling she put into it that night , the lecturer must have been hard to please , if he did not admit that his expectations were more than fulfilled . When it was ended , Mary 's looks told more than words could have done what she thought of it ; and partly to keep in a tear which would fain have rolled out , she brightened into a laugh , and said , "
45936	46410	46440	46440	man	5158	" The next evening it was a warm , pattering , incessant rain , just the rain to waken up the flowers . But in Manchester , where , alas ! there are no flowers , the rain had only a disheartening and gloomy effect ; the streets were wet and dirty , the drippings from the houses were wet and dirty , and the people were wet and dirty . Indeed , most kept within - doors ; and there was an unusual silence of footsteps in the little paved courts . Mary had to change her clothes after her walk home ; and had hardly settled herself before she heard some one fumbling at the door . The noise continued long enough to allow her to get up , and go and open it . There stood — could it be ? yes it was , her father ! Drenched and way - worn , there he stood ! He came in with no word to Mary in return for her cheery and astonished greeting . He sat down by the fire in his wet things , unheeding . But Mary would not let him so rest . She ran up and brought down his working - day clothes , and went into the pantry to rummage up their little bit of provision while he changed by the fire , talking all the while as gaily as she could , though her father 's depression hung like lead on her heart . For Mary , in her seclusion at Miss Simmonds',—where the chief talk was of fashions , and dress , and parties to be given , for which such and such gowns would be wanted , varied with a slight whispered interlude occasionally about love and lovers,—had not heard the political news of the day : that Parliament had refused to listen to the working - men , when they petitioned with all the force of their rough , untutored words to be heard concerning the distress which was riding , like the Conqueror on his Pale Horse , among the people ; which was crushing their lives out of them , and stamping woe - marks over the land . When he had eaten and was refreshed , they sat in silence for some time ; for Mary wished him to tell her what oppressed him so , yet durst not ask . In this she was wise ; for when we are heavy laden in our hearts , it falls in better with our humour to reveal our case in our own way , and our own time . Mary sat on a stool at her father 's feet in old childish guise , and stole her hand into his , while his sadness infected her , and she "
46420	46426	46440	46440	man	5158	" she knew not why . "
46458	46583	46584	46584	Father	192	" In an instant Mary understood the fact , if not the details , that so weighed down her father 's heart . She pressed his hand with silent sympathy . She did not know what to say , and was so afraid of speaking wrongly , that she was silent . But when his attitude had remained unchanged for more than half - an - hour , his eyes gazing vacantly and fixedly at the fire , no sound but now and then a deep drawn sigh to break the weary ticking of the clock , and the drip - drop from the roof without , Mary could bear it no longer . Any thing to rouse her father . Even bad news . "
46594	46606	46607	46607	He	129	" ( Her hand was suddenly and almost violently compressed . ) "
46628	46663	46626	46626	father	4805	" Her tears were ready to flow as she looked up in her father 's face for sympathy . Still the same fixed look of despair , not varied by grief for the dead . "
46670	46747	46626	46626	father	4805	" he said , in a low voice . This was unbearable . Mary got up under pretence of going to tell Margaret that she need not come to sleep with her to - night , but really to ask Job Legh to come and cheer her father . She stopped outside their door . Margaret was practising her singing , and through the still night air her voice rang out like that of an angel . "
46761	46784	46758	46759	your God	1543	" The old Hebrew prophetic words fell like dew on Mary 's heart . She could not interrupt . She stood listening and "
46787	46818	46758	46759	your God	1543	" till the little buzz of conversation again began , and then entered and told her errand . Both grandfather and grand - daughter rose instantly to fulfil her request . "
46827	46832	46825	46825	Mary	124	" said old Job . "
46843	46904	46833	46833	He	1544	" There is no describing the looks and tones that have power over an aching , heavy laden heart ; but in an hour or so John Barton was talking away as freely as ever , though all his talk ran , as was natural , on the disappointment of his fond hope , of the forlorn hope of many . "
46913	46917	46833	46833	He	1544	" said he , "
46958	46985	46993	46994	dear father	5149	" Still at the old parable of Dives and Lazarus ! Does it haunt the minds of the rich as it does those of the poor ? "
46996	47013	46993	46994	dear father	5149	" asked Mary , who was sitting at her old post by her father 's knee . "
47093	47094	47087	47087	I	0	" "
47107	47108	47103	47105	th ' Queen	1555	" "
47131	47140	47128	47128	You	1556	" said he , turning to Job Legh , "
47360	47361	47362	47362	Yourself	1571	" "
47369	47370	47362	47362	Yourself	1571	" "
47687	47691	47685	47685	Job	135	" Job assented . "
47988	48052	47987	47987	I.	0	" ' You 're frightening them horses , ' says he , in his mincing way ( for Londoners are mostly all tongue - tied , and ca n't say their a 's and i 's properly ) , ' and it 's our business to keep you from molesting the ladies and gentlemen going to her Majesty 's Drawing - room . ' "
48124	48141	48142	48142	John	110	" But I might as well ha ' held my peace , for he only laughed . "
48162	48189	48159	48159	Job	135	" Well , but that 's not a ' your story , man . Tell us what happened when yo got to th ' Parliament House . "
48197	48291	48194	48194	John	110	" If yo please , neighbour , I 'd rather say nought about that . It 's not to be forgotten or forgiven either by me or many another ; but I canna tell of our down - casting just as a piece of London news . As long as I live , our rejection that day will bide in my heart ; and as long as I live I shall curse them as so cruelly refused to hear us ; but I 'll not speak of it no [ 29 ] more . "
48373	48380	48382	48382	he	196	" Did you ever hear tell , "
48386	48394	48382	48382	he	196	" that I were in London once ? "
48395	48398	48400	48400	she	124	" No ! "
48413	48646	48400	48400	she	124	" Ay , but I were though , and Peg there too , though she minds nought about it , poor wench ! You must know I had but one child , and she were Margaret 's mother . I loved her above a bit , and one day when she came ( standing behind me for that I should not see her blushes , and stroking my cheeks in her own coaxing way ) , and told me she and Frank Jennings ( as was a joiner lodging near us ) should be so happy if they were married , I could not find in my heart t ' say her nay , though I went sick at the thought of losing her away from my home . Howe'er , she were my only child , and I never said nought of what I felt , for fear o ' grieving her young heart . But I tried to think o ' the time when I 'd been young mysel , and had loved her blessed mother , and how we 'd left father and mother and gone out into th ' world together , and I 'm now right thankful I held my peace , and didna fret her wi ' telling her how sore I was at parting wi ' her that were the light o ' my eyes . "
48647	48650	48652	48652	Mary	124	" But , "
48654	48664	48652	48652	Mary	124	" you said the young man were a neighbour . "
48665	48858	48382	48382	he	196	" Ay , so he were ; and his father afore him . But work were rather slack in Manchester , and Frank 's uncle sent him word o ' London work and London wages , so he were to go there ; and it were there Margaret was to follow him . Well , my heart aches yet at thought of those days . She so happy , and he so happy ; only the poor father as fretted sadly behind their backs . They were married , and stayed some days wi ' me afore setting off ; and I 've often thought sin ' Margaret 's heart failed her many a time those few days , and she would fain ha ' spoken ; but I knew fra ' mysel it were better to keep it pent up , and I never let on what I were feeling . I knew what she meant when she came kissing , and holding my hand , and all her old childish ways o ' loving me . Well , they went at last . You know them two letters , Margaret ? "
48859	48864	48866	48869	his grand - daughter	879	" Yes , sure , "
48871	49178	48866	48869	his grand - daughter	879	" Well , them two were the only letters I ever had fra ' her , poor lass . She said in them she were very happy , and I believe she were . And Frank 's family heard he were in good work . In one o ' her letters , poor thing , she ends wi ' saying , ' Farewell , Grandad ! ' wi ' a line drawn under grandad , and fra ' that an ' other hints I knew she were in th ' family way ; and I said nought , but I screwed up a little money , thinking come Whitsuntide I 'd take a holiday and go and see her an ' th ' little one . But one day towards Whitsuntide comed Jennings wi ' a grave face , and says he , ' I hear our Frank and your Margaret 's both getten the fever . ' You might ha ' knocked me down wi ' a straw , for it seemed as if God told me what th ' upshot would be . Old Jennings had gotten a letter , yo see , fra ' the landlady they lodged wi ' ; a well - penned letter , asking if they 'd no friends to come and nurse them . She 'd caught it first , and Frank , who was as tender o ' her as her own mother could ha ' been , had nursed her till he 'd caught it himsel ; and she expecting her down - lying [ 30 ] every day . Well , t ' make a long story short , Old Jennings and I went up by that night 's coach . So you see , Mary , that was the way I got to London . "
49179	49190	49192	49192	Mary	124	" But how was your daughter when you got there ? "
49196	49311	49192	49192	Mary	124	" She were at rest , poor wench , and so were Frank . I guessed as much when I see'd th ' landlady 's face , all swelled wi ' crying , when she opened th ' door to us . We said , ' Where are they ? ' and I knew they were dead , fra ' her look ; but Jennings did n't , as I take it ; for when she showed us into a room wi ' a white sheet on th ' bed , and underneath it , plain to be seen , two still figures , he screeched out as if he 'd been a woman . "
49375	49670	49368	49368	my	0	" Jennings could na ' stand being in th ' room at all , so th ' landlady took him down , and I were glad to be alone . It grew dark while I sat there ; and at last th ' landlady come up again , and said , ' Come here . ' So I got up and walked into th ' light , but I had to hold by th ' stair - rails , I were so weak and dizzy . She led me into a room , where Jennings lay on a sofa fast asleep , wi ' his pocket handkercher over his head for a night - cap . She said he 'd cried himself fairly off to sleep . There were tea on th ' table all ready ; for she were a kind - hearted body . But she still said , ' Come here , ' and took hold o ' my arm . So I went round the table , and there were a clothes - basket by th ' fire , wi ' a shawl put o'er it . ' Lift that up , ' says she , and I did ; and there lay a little wee babby fast asleep . My heart gave a leap , and th ' tears comed rushing into my eyes first time that day . ' Is it hers ? ' said I , though I knew it were . ' Yes , ' said she . ' She were getting a bit better o ' the fever , and th ' babby were born ; and then the poor young man took worse and died , and she were not many hours behind . ' "
49974	50627	50629	50630	Young woman	1665	" The babby had been fed afore we set out , and th ' coach moving kept it asleep , bless its little heart . But when th ' coach stopped for dinner it were awake , and crying for its pobbies . So we asked for some bread and milk , and Jennings took it first for to feed it ; but it made its mouth like a square , and let it run out at each o ' th ' four corners . ' Shake it , Jennings , ' says I ; ' that 's the way they make water run through a funnel , when it 's o'er full ; and a child 's mouth is broad end o ' th ' funnel , and th ' gullet the narrow one . ' So he shook it , but it only cried th ' more . ' Let me have it , ' says I , thinking he were an awkward oud chap . But it were just as bad wi ' me . By shaking th ' babby we got better nor a gill into its mouth , but more nor that came up again , wetting a ' th ' nice dry clothes landlady had put on . Well , just as we 'd gotten to th ' dinner - table , and helped oursels , and eaten two mouthful , came in th ' guard , and a fine chap wi ' a sample o ' calico flourishing in his hand . ' Coach is ready ! ' says one ; ' Half - a - crown your dinner ! ' says th ' other . Well , we thought it a deal for both our dinners , when we 'd hardly tasted 'em ; but , bless your life , it were half - a - crown apiece , and a shilling for th ' bread and milk as were possetted all over babby 's clothes . We spoke up again [ 33 ] it ; but every body said it were the rule , so what could two poor oud chaps like us do again it ? Well , poor babby cried without stopping to take breath , fra ' that time till we got to Brummagem for the night . My heart ached for th ' little thing . It caught wi ' its wee mouth at our coat sleeves and at our mouths , when we tried t ' comfort it by talking to it . Poor little wench ! It wanted its mammy , as were lying cold in th ' grave . ' Well , ' says I , ' it 'll be clemmed to death , if it lets out its supper as it did its dinner . Let 's get some woman to feed it ; it comes natural to women to do for babbies . ' So we asked th ' chamber - maid at the inn , and she took quite kindly to it ; and we got a good supper , and grew rare and sleepy , what wi ' th ' warmth , and wi ' our long ride i ' th ' open air . Th ' chamber - maid said she would like t ' have it t ' sleep wi ' her , only missis would scold so ; but it looked so quiet and smiling like , as it lay in her arms , that we thought ' twould be no trouble to have it wi ' us . I says : ' See , Jennings , how women - folk do quieten babbies ; it 's just as I said . ' He looked grave ; he were always thoughtful - looking , though I never heard him say any thing very deep . At last says he — "
50642	50666	50633	50633	you	1665	" ' Missis always keeps night - caps for gentlemen as does not like to unpack , ' says she , rather quick . "
50721	51109	50711	50711	I	0	" The chambermaid smirked and went for a cap , but I laughed outright at th ' oud bearded chap thinking he 'd make hissel like a woman just by putting on a woman 's cap . Howe'er he 'd not be laughed out on't , so I held th ' babby till he were in bed . Such a night as we had on it ! Babby began to scream o ' th ' oud fashion , and we took it turn and turn about to sit up and rock it . My heart were very sore for th ' little one , as it groped about wi ' its mouth ; but for a ' that I could scarce keep fra ' smiling at th ' thought o ' us two oud chaps , th ' one wi ' a woman 's night - cap on , sitting on our hinder ends for half th ' night , hushabying a babby as would n't be hushabied . Toward morning , poor little wench ! it fell asleep , fairly tired out wi ' crying , but even in its sleep it gave such pitiful sobs , quivering up fra ' the very bottom of its little heart , that once or twice I almost wished it lay on its mother 's breast , at peace for ever . Jennings fell asleep too ; but I began for to reckon up our money . It were little enough we had left , our dinner the day afore had ta'en so much . I did n't know what our reckoning would be for that night lodging , and supper , and breakfast . Doing a sum alway sent me asleep ever sin ' I were a lad ; so I fell sound in a short time , and were only wakened by chambermaid tapping at th ' door , to say she 'd dress the babby afore her missis were up if we liked . But bless yo ' , we 'd never thought o ' undressing it th ' night afore , and now it were sleeping so sound , and we were so glad o ' the peace and quietness , that we thought it were no good to waken it up to screech again . "
51382	51403	51377	51377	Jennings	136	" ' We should na ha ' set out so like gentlefolk a top o ' the coach yesterday . ' "
51441	51509	51511	51511	I	0	" So he were quiet a bit . But he were one o ' them as were sure to find out somewhat had been done amiss , when there were no going back to undo it . So presently he coughs , as if he were going to speak , and I says to mysel , ' At it again , my lad . ' Says he , "
51544	51590	51603	51603	God	116	" Well ! that put me up , and my heart got very full , and but that I were carrying her babby , I think I should ha ' struck him . At last I could hold in no longer , and says I , "
51636	51704	51603	51603	God	116	" Well ! he said that were rank blasphemy ; but I thought his way of casting up again th ' events God had pleased to send , were worse blasphemy . Howe'er , I said nought more angry , for th ' little babby 's sake , as were th ' child o ' his dead son , as well as o ' my dead daughter . "
52442	52488	52490	52490	I	0	" The man had nodded cross enough to us , and had gone to th ' door , and stood there whistling wi ' his hands in his breeches - pockets , looking abroad . But at last he turns and says , quite sharp , "
52509	53005	53006	53006	He	1724	" So wi ' that she kissed th ' child , a long , soft kiss ; and looking in my face to see if I could take her meaning , gave me th ' babby without a word . I were loath to stir , but I saw it were better to go . So giving Jennings a sharp nudge ( for he 'd fallen asleep ) , I says , ' Missis , what 's to pay ? ' pulling out my money wi ' a jingle that she might na guess we were at all bare o ' cash . So she looks at her husband , who said ne'er a word , but were listening wi ' all his ears nevertheless ; and when she saw he would na say , she said , hesitating , as if pulled two ways , by her fear o ' him , ' Should you think sixpence over much ? ' It were so different to public - house reckoning , for we 'd eaten a main deal afore the chap came down . So says I , ' And , missis , what should we gie you for the babby 's bread and milk ? ' ( I had it once in my mind to say ' and for a ' your trouble with it , ' but my heart would na let me say it , for I could read in her ways how it had been a work o ' love . ) So says she , quite quick , and stealing a look at her husband 's back , as looked all ear , if ever a back did , ' Oh , we could take nought for the little babby 's food , if it had eaten twice as much , bless it . ' Wi ' that he looked at her ; such a scowling look ! She knew what he meant , and stepped softly across the floor to him , and put her hand on his arm . He seem'd as though he 'd shake it off by a jerk on his elbow , but she said quite low , ' For poor little Johnnie 's sake , Richard . ' He did not move or speak again , and after looking in his face for a minute , she turned away , swallowing deep in her throat . She kissed th ' sleeping babby as she passed , when I paid her . To quieten th ' gruff husband , and stop him if he rated her , I could na help slipping another sixpence under th ' loaf , and then we set off again . Last look I had o ' that woman she were quietly wiping her eyes wi ' the corner of her apron , as she went about her husband 's breakfast . But I shall know her in heaven . "
53038	53048	53050	53050	he	1724	" There 's nought more to say , wench , "
53062	53104	53055	53055	she	136	" That night we reached Manchester , and I 'd found out that Jennings would be glad enough to give up babby to me , so I took her home at once , and a blessing she 's been to me . "
53306	53320	53295	53295	she	124	" I 'm not asleep . I 've been awake all the time . "
53338	53343	53345	53345	Job	135	" Come , wench , "
53347	53425	53345	53345	Job	135	" do n't look so gloppened [ 37 ] because thou'st fallen asleep while an oud chap like me was talking on oud times . It were like enough to send thee to sleep . Try if thou canst keep thine eyes open while I read thy father a bit on a poem as is written by a weaver like oursel . A rare chap I 'll be bound is he who could weave verse like this . "
53467	53470	53472	53472	Barton	124	" Amen ! "
53479	53504	53472	53472	Barton	124	" Mary ! wench , couldst thou copy me them lines , dost think?—that 's to say , if Job there has no objection . "
53505	53520	53522	53522	Mary	124	" Not I. More they 're heard and read and the better , say I. "

56578	56586	56587	56587	she	114	" Dear Mary , is that you ? "
56590	56629	56587	56587	she	114	" Why , who would ha ' dreamt of seeing you ! We thought you 'd clean forgotten us ; and Jem has often wondered if he should know you , if he met you in the street . "
56776	56825	56855	56855	her	126	" You mun speak louder than that , if you mean her to hear ; she become as deaf as a post this last few weeks . I 'd ha ' told you , if I 'd remembered how long it were sin ' you 'd seen her . "
56826	56843	56845	56845	Alice	126	" Yes , my dear , I 'm getting very hard o ' hearing of late , "
56861	56873	56845	56845	Alice	126	" I suppose it 's the beginning of th ' end . "
56874	56883	56885	56890	her sister - in - law	5277	" Do n't talk o ' that way , "
56892	56905	56885	56890	her sister - in - law	5277	" We 've had enow of ends and deaths without forecasting more . "
56920	56928	56930	56930	she	5277	" He was such a good husband , "
56955	56976	56942	56942	she	5277	" No one can tell what I 've lost in him , for no one knew his worth like me . "
56995	57064	56985	56985	she	124	" Eh , dear , dear ! No one knows what I 've lost . When my poor boys went , I thought th ' Almighty had crushed me to th ' ground , but I never thought o ' losing George ; I did na think I could ha ' borne to ha ' lived without him . And yet I 'm here , and he 's — "
57074	57075	56985	56985	she	124	" Mary,"—beginning
57078	57112	56985	56985	she	124	again,—"did you ever hear what a poor creature I were when he married me ? And he such a handsome fellow ! Jem 's nothing to what his father were at his age . "
57159	57243	57138	57138	her	4987	" There were nought about me for him to choose me . I were just well enough afore that accident , but at after I were downright plain . And there was Bessy Witter as would ha ' given her eyes for him ; she as is Mrs. Carson now , for she were a handsome lass , although I never could see her beauty then ; and Carson warn't so much above her , as they 're both above us all now . "
57299	57475	57283	57284	Mrs. Wilson	114	" If you 'll believe me , Mary , there never was such a born goose at house - keeping as I were ; and yet he married me ! I had been in a factory sin ' five years old a'most , and I knew nought about cleaning , or cooking , let alone washing and such - like work . The day after we were married he goes to his work at after breakfast , and says he , ' Jenny , we 'll ha ' th ' cold beef , and potatoes , and that 's a dinner fit for a prince . ' I were anxious to make him comfortable , God knows how anxious . And yet I 'd no notion how to cook a potato . I know'd they were boiled , and I know'd their skins were taken off , and that were all . So I tidyed my house in a rough kind o ' way , and then I looked at that very clock up yonder , "
57485	57664	57283	57284	Mrs. Wilson	114	" and I seed it were nine o'clock , so , thinks I , th ' potatoes shall be well boiled at any rate , and I gets 'em on th ' fire in a jiffy ( that 's to say , as soon as I could peel 'em , which were a tough job at first ) , and then I fell to unpacking my boxes ! and at twenty minutes past twelve he comes home , and I had th ' beef ready on th ' table , and I went to take the potatoes out o ' th ' pot ; but oh ! Mary , th ' water had boiled away , and they were all a nasty brown mass , as smelt through all the house . He said nought , and were very gentle ; but , oh , Mary , I cried so that afternoon . I shall ne'er forget it ; no , never . I made many a blunder at after , but none that fretted me like that . "
57665	57676	57678	57678	Mary	124	" Father does not like girls to work in factories , "
57680	57715	57678	57678	Mary	124	" No , I know he does n't ; and reason good . They ought n't to go at after they 're married , that I 'm very clear about . I could reckon up "
57722	57833	57834	57834	Alice	126	" ay , nine men I know , as has been driven to th ' public - house by having wives as worked in factories ; good folk , too , as thought there was no harm in putting their little ones out at nurse , and letting their house go all dirty , and their fires all out ; and that was a place as was tempting for a husband to stay in , was it ? He soon finds out gin - shops , where all is clean and bright , and where th ' fire blazes cheerily , and gives a man a welcome as it were . "
57872	57922	57868	57868	she	126	" I wish our Jem could speak a word to th ' Queen about factory work for married women . Eh ! but he comes it strong , when once yo get him to speak about it . Wife o ' his'n will never work away fra ' home . "
57923	58081	58087	58087	she	124	" I say it 's Prince Albert as ought to be asked how he 'd like his missis to be from home when he comes in , tired and worn , and wanting some one to cheer him ; and may be , her to come in by - and - bye , just as tired and down in th ' mouth ; and how he 'd like for her never to be at home to see to th ' cleaning of his house , or to keep a bright fire in his grate . Let alone his meals being all hugger - mugger and comfortless . I 'd be bound , prince as he is , if his missis served him so , he 'd be off to a gin - palace , or summut o ' that kind . So why ca n't he make a law again poor folks ' wives working in factories ? "
58104	58166	58087	58087	she	124	" Pooh ! do n't tell me it 's not the Queen as makes laws ; and is n't she bound to obey Prince Albert ? And if he said they must n't , why she 'd say they must n't , and then all folk would say , oh no , we never shall do any such thing no more . "
58167	58174	58176	58176	Alice	126	" Jem 's getten on rarely , "
58205	58286	58287	58287	Mary	124	" He 's found out summut about a crank or a tank , I forget rightly which it is , but th ' master 's made him foreman , and he all the while turning off hands ; but he said he could na part wi ' Jem , nohow . He 's good wage now : I tell him he 'll be thinking of marrying soon , and he deserves a right down good wife , that he does . "
58456	58463	58432	58432	she	666	" his right down good wife , "
58470	58482	58512	58512	she	666	" Ay , he 'll be for taking a wife soon , "
58515	58624	58512	58512	she	666	" It 'll not be long afore Molly Gibson ( that 's her at th ' provision - shop round the corner ) will hear a secret as will not displease her , I 'm thinking . She 's been casting sheep 's eyes at our Jem this many a day , but he thought her father would not give her to a common working man ; but now he 's as good as her , every bit . I thought once he 'd a fancy for thee , Mary , but I donnot think yo'd ever ha ' suited , so it 's best as it is . "
58640	58659	58633	58633	her	210	" She hoped he 'd be happy with Molly Gibson . She was very handsome , for certain . "
58660	58689	58690	58690	Mary	210	" Ay , and a notable body , too . I 'll just step up stairs and show you the patchwork quilt she gave me but last Saturday . "
58746	58750	58752	58752	Mary	210	" Dear Alice , "
58754	58773	58752	58752	Mary	210	" I 'm so grieved to find you so deaf ; it must have come on very rapid . "
58774	58953	58727	58728	Mrs. Wilson	114	" Yes , dear , it 's a trial ; I 'll not deny it . Pray God give me strength to find out its teaching . I felt it sore one fine day when I thought I 'd go gather some meadow - sweet to make tea for Jane 's cough ; and the fields seemed so dree and still , and at first I could na make out what was wanting ; and then it struck me it were th ' song o ' the birds , and that I never should hear their sweet music no more , and I could na help crying a bit . But I 've much to be thankful for . I think I 'm a comfort to Jane , if I 'm only some one to scold now and then ; poor body ! It takes off her thoughts from her sore losses when she can scold a bit . If my eyes are left I can do well enough ; I can guess at what folk are saying . "

59578	59586	59574	59575	the woman	563	" I want to speak to you . "
59597	59626	59627	59627	She	563	" I really do . Do n't send me away . I 'm so out of breath , I can not say what I would all at once . "
59643	59655	59637	59637	her	563	" I tell thee I 'm not the man for thee , "
59661	59664	59666	59666	he	110	" Stay , "
59843	59856	59858	59858	John	110	" So it 's thee , is it ! It 's thee ! "
59872	59959	59861	59861	he	110	" I 've looked for thee long at corners o ' streets , and such like places . I knew I should find thee at last . Thee'll may be bethink thee o ' some words I spoke , which put thee up at th ' time ; summut about street - walkers ; but oh no ! thou art none o ' them naughts ; no one thinks thou art , who sees thy fine draggle - tailed dress , and thy pretty pink cheeks ! "
59967	59984	59985	59985	She	1881	" Oh , mercy ! John , mercy ! listen to me for Mary 's sake ! "
60039	60141	60142	60142	He	1885	" And thou names that name to me ! and thou thinks the thought of her will bring thee mercy ! Dost thou know it was thee who killed her , as sure as ever Cain killed Abel . She 'd loved thee as her own , and she trusted thee as her own , and when thou wert gone she never held up head again , but died in less than a three week ; and at the judgment day she 'll rise , and point to thee as her murderer ; or if she do n't , I will . "
60292	60466	60258	60258	he	4749	" He would not listen to me ; what can I do ? He would not listen to me , and I wanted to warn him ! Oh , what shall I do to save Mary 's child ? What shall I do ? How can I keep her from being such a one as I am ; such a wretched , loathsome creature ! She was listening just as I listened , and loving just as I loved , and the end will be just like my end . How shall I save her ? She wo n't hearken to warning , or heed it more than I did ; and who loves her well enough to watch over her as she should be watched ? God keep her from harm ! And yet I wo n't pray for her ; sinner that I am ! Can my prayers be heard ? No ! they 'll only do harm . How shall I save her ? He would not listen to me . "
61221	61241	61216	61216	He	450	" Mary , what 's come o'er thee and Jem Wilson ? Yo were great friends at one time . "
61242	61269	61271	61271	Mary	210	" Oh , folk say he 's going to be married to Molly Gibson , and of course courting takes up a deal o ' time , "
61279	61288	61290	61291	her father	450	" Thou'st played thy cards badly , then , "
61298	61324	61290	61291	her father	450	" At one time he were desperate fond o ' thee , or I 'm much mistaken . Much fonder of thee than thou deservedst . "
61325	61332	61334	61334	Mary	210	" That 's as people think , "
61532	61547	61548	61548	He	128	" put his fate to the touch , to win or lose it all . "
61743	61747	61749	61749	Mary	210	" Come in , "
61835	61844	61846	61846	he	128	" Is your father at home , Mary ? "
61869	61882	61856	61856	she	210	" No , he 's gone to his Union , I suppose . "
61922	61925	61927	61927	he	128	" Mary ! "
62027	62170	62015	62015	her	210	" Dear Mary ! ( for how dear you are , I can not rightly tell you in words ) . It 's no new story I 'm going to speak about . You must ha ' seen and known it long ; for since we were boy and girl , I ha ' loved you above father and mother and all ; and all I 've thought on by day and dreamt on by night , has been something in which you 've had a share . I 'd no way of keeping you for long , and I scorned to try and tie you down ; and I lived in terror lest some one else should take you to himself . But now , Mary , I 'm foreman in th ' works , and , dear Mary ! listen , "
62226	62329	62330	62330	She	1935	" And now , Mary , I 've a home to offer you , and a heart as true as ever man had to love you and cherish you ; we shall never be rich folk , I dare say ; but if a loving heart and a strong right arm can shield you from sorrow , or from want , mine shall do it . I can not speak as I would like ; my love wo n't let itself be put in words . But oh ! darling , say you believe me , and that you 'll be mine . "
62343	62356	62357	62357	he	1936	" Mary , they say silence gives consent ; is it so ? "
62369	62378	62379	62379	Her	1935	" No ! it does not with me . "
62392	62410	62379	62379	Her	1935	" I will always be your friend , Jem , but I can never be your wife . "
62411	62416	62418	62418	he	1936	" Not my wife ! "
62422	62545	62418	62418	he	1936	" Oh Mary , think awhile ! you can not be my friend if you will not be my wife . At least I can never be content to be only your friend . Do think awhile ! If you say No you will make me hopeless , desperate . It 's no love of yesterday . It has made the very groundwork of all that people call good in me . I do n't know what I shall be if you wo n't have me . And , Mary ! think how glad your father would be ! it may sound vain , but he 's told me more than once how much he should like to see us two married ! "
62607	62629	62579	62580	her father	450	" I tell you , Jem , it can not be . Once for all , I will never marry you . "
62630	62664	62665	62665	His	128	" And is this the end of all my hopes and fears ? the end of my life , I may say , for it is the end of all worth living for ! "
62674	62757	62759	62759	he	128	" Mary ! you 'll hear , may be , of me as a drunkard , and may be as a thief , and may be as a murderer . Remember ! when all are speaking ill of me , you will have no right to blame me , for it 's your cruelty that will have made me what I feel I shall become . You wo n't even say you 'll try and like me ; will you , Mary ? "
62864	62869	62871	62871	she	1938	" Jem ! Jem ! "
64547	64553	64544	64544	she	124	" Well , Mary , dear "
64559	64561	64544	64544	she	124	" dear "
64569	64597	64544	64544	she	124	" i 's so difficult to get any comfortable talk at Miss Simmonds ' , I thought I 'd just step up and see you at home . "
64598	64619	64621	64621	Mary	124	" I understood from what you said your mother was ailing , and that you wanted to be with her , "
64628	64637	64639	64641	the unabashed Sally	1975	" Ay , but mother 's better now , "
64643	64651	64657	64657	she	124	" Your father 's out I suppose ? "
64680	64687	64689	64689	Mary	124	" Yes , he 's out , "
64711	64717	64719	64719	Sally	139	" So much the better , "
64721	64778	64719	64719	Sally	139	" for to tell you the truth , Mary , I 've a friend at th ' end of the street , as is anxious to come and see you at home , since you 're grown so particular as not to like to speak to him in the street . He 'll be here directly . "
64779	64789	64791	64791	Mary	124	" Oh , Sally , do n't let him , "
64821	64828	64810	64810	Sally	139	" Oh , please , Sally , "
64831	64884	64906	64906	she	124	" dear Sally ! do n't let him come here , the neighbours will so talk , and father'll go mad if he hears ; he 'll kill me , Sally , he will . Besides , I do n't love him — I never did . Oh , let me go , "
64909	65008	64906	64906	she	124	" Do , Sally , dear Sally , go and tell him I do n't love him , and that I do n't want to have any thing more to do with him . It was very wrong , I dare say , keeping company with him at all , but I 'm very sorry , if I 've led him to think too much of me ; and I do n't want him to think any more . Will you tell him this , Sally ? and I 'll do any thing for you if you will . "
65009	65019	65021	65021	Sally	139	" I 'll tell you what I 'll do , "
65029	65103	65021	65021	Sally	139	" I 'll go back with you to where he 's waiting for us ; or rather , I should say , where I told him to wait for a quarter of an hour , till I seed if your father was at home ; and if I did n't come back in that time , he said he 'd come here , and break the door open but he 'd see you . "
65104	65115	65117	65117	Mary	124	" Oh , let us go , let us go , "
65624	65670	65609	65609	his	167	" Nay , nay ! you little witch ! Now I have caught you , I shall keep you prisoner . Tell me now what has made you run away from me so fast these few days — tell me , you sweet little coquette ! "
65694	65781	65687	65687	she	124	" Mr. Carson ! I want to speak to you for once and for all . Since I met you last Monday evening , I have made up my mind to have nothing more to do with you . I know I 've been wrong in leading you to think I liked you ; but I believe I did n't rightly know my own mind ; and I humbly beg your pardon , sir , if I 've led you to think too much of me . "
65831	65891	65820	65820	she	1993	" You 're a darling little rascal to go on in this way ! ' Humbly begging my pardon if you 've made me think too much of you . ' As if you did n't know I think of you from morning to night . But you want to be told it again and again , do you ? "
65892	65965	65802	65802	she	1993	" No , indeed , sir , I do n't . I would far liefer [ 40 ] that you should say you will never think of me again , than that you should speak of me in this way . For indeed , sir , I never was more in earnest than I am , when I say to - night is the last night I will ever speak to you . "
65966	65992	65994	65994	she	1994	" Last night , you sweet little equivocator , but not last day . Ha , Mary ! I 've caught you , have I ? "
66016	66022	66023	66023	she	1994	" I mean , sir , "
66028	66046	66023	66023	she	1994	" that I will never speak to you again at any time , after to - night . "
66047	66057	66059	66059	he	1995	" And what 's made this change , Mary ? "
66065	66075	66077	66077	he	1995	" Have I done any thing to offend you ? "
66081	66086	66087	66087	she	1994	" No , sir , "
66095	66147	66087	66087	she	1994	" I can not tell you exactly why I 've changed my mind ; but I shall not alter it again ; and as I said before , I beg your pardon if I 've done wrong by you . And now , sir , if you please , good night . "
66148	66190	66059	66059	he	1995	" But I do not please . You shall not go . What have I done , Mary ? Tell me . You must not go without telling me how I have vexed you . What would you have me do ? "
66191	66270	66087	66087	she	1994	" Nothing , sir ! but ( in an agitated tone ) oh ! let me go ! You can not change my mind ; it 's quite made up . Oh , sir ! why do you hold me so tight ? If you will know why I wo n't have any thing more to do with you , it is that I can not love you . I have tried , and I really can not . "
66315	66459	66461	66461	Deep	217	" Listen ! Mary . Nay , I can not let you go till you have heard me . I do love you dearly ; and I wo n't believe but what you love me a very little , just a very little . Well , if you do n't like to own it , never mind ! I only want now to tell you how much I love you , by what I am ready to give up for you . You know ( or perhaps you are not fully aware ) how little my father and mother would like me to marry you . So angry would they be , and so much ridicule should I have to brave , that of course I have never thought of it till now . I thought we could be happy enough without marriage . "
66471	66559	66566	66566	himself	217	" But now , if you like , I 'll get a licence to - morrow morning — nay , to - night , and I 'll marry you in defiance of all the world , rather than give you up . In a year or two my father will forgive me , and meanwhile you shall have every luxury money can purchase , and every charm that love can devise to make your life happy . After all , my mother was but a factory girl . "
66579	66631	66632	66632	He	217	" Now , Mary , you see how willing I am to — to sacrifice a good deal for you ; I even offer you marriage , to satisfy your little ambitious heart ; so , now , wo n't you say you can love me a little , little bit ? "
66815	66971	66986	66986	she	2003	" I am obliged to you , sir , for telling me what you have . You may think I am a fool ; but I did think you meant to marry me all along ; and yet , thinking so , I felt I could not love you . Still I felt sorry I had gone so far in keeping company with you . Now , sir , I tell you , if I had loved you before , I do n't think I should have loved you now you have told me you meant to ruin me ; for that 's the plain English of not meaning to marry me till just this minute . I said I was sorry , and humbly begged your pardon ; that was before I knew what you were . Now I scorn you , sir , for plotting to ruin a poor girl . Good night . "
67025	67036	67038	67038	he	167	" And what do you find so amusing , Sally ? "
67040	67075	67077	67077	She	139	" Oh , sir , I beg your pardon . I humbly beg your pardon , as Mary says , but I ca n't help laughing , to think how she 's outwitted us . "
67084	67088	67077	67077	She	139	" outwitted you , "
67095	67114	67077	67077	She	139	" Why , Sally , had you any idea she was going to fly out in this style ? "
67115	67172	67008	67008	Sally	139	" No , I had n't , to be sure . But if you did think of marrying her , why ( if I may be so bold as to ask ) did you go and tell her you had no thought of doing otherwise by her ? That was what put her up at last ! "
67173	67311	67312	67312	Sally	139	" Why I had repeatedly before led her to infer that marriage was not my object . I never dreamed she could have been so foolish as to have mistaken me , little provoking romancer though she be ! So I naturally wished her to know what a sacrifice of prejudice , of — of myself , in short , I was willing to make for her sake ; yet I do n't think she was aware of it after all . I believe I might have any lady in Manchester if I liked , and yet I was willing and ready to marry a poor dress - maker . Do n't you understand me now ? and do n't you see what a sacrifice I was making to humour her ? and all to no avail . "
67321	67344	67317	67317	he	2006	" My father would have forgiven any temporary connexion , far sooner than my marrying one so far beneath me in rank . "
67345	67360	67362	67362	Sally	139	" I thought you said , sir , your mother was a factory girl , "
67367	67397	67362	67362	Sally	139	" Yes , yes!—but then my father was in much such a station ; at any rate , there was not the disparity there is between Mary and me . "
67401	67423	67362	67362	Sally	139	" Then you mean to give her up , sir ? She made no bones of saying she gave you up . "
67424	67513	67552	67552	He	2009	" No , I do not mean to give her up , whatever you and she may please to think . I am more in love with her than ever ; even for this charming capricious ebullition of hers . She 'll come round , you may depend upon it . Women always do . They always have second thoughts , and find out that they are best in casting off a lover . Mind ! I do n't say I shall offer her the same terms again . "
67635	67641	67630	67630	He	2009	" hit Mary 's fancy ; "
67715	67731	67698	67708	an angel with a drawn sword in the way to sin	2014	" he was the only son of his mother , and she was a widow ; "
67805	67809	67804	67807	a " charming caprice	5800	" charming caprice . "
68159	68163	68146	68146	her	124	" Barbara Allen , "
68425	68428	68414	68414	She	124	" clemming . "
68521	68557	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" Oh ! Margaret , Margaret ! how glad I am to see you . Take care . There , now , you 're all right , that 's father 's chair . Sit down . "—She
68565	68592	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" It seems like the beginning o ' brighter times , to see you again , Margaret . Bless you ! And how well you look ! "
68593	68617	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" Doctors always send ailing folk for change of air ! and you know I 've had plenty o ' that same lately . "
68618	68647	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" You 've been quite a traveller for sure ! Tell us all about it , do , Margaret . Where have you been to , first place ? "
68648	68705	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" Eh , lass , that would take a long time to tell . Half o'er the world I sometimes think . Bolton , and Bury , and Owdham , and Halifax , and — but Mary , guess who I saw there ! May be you know though , so it 's not fair guessing . "
68706	68726	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" No , I donnot . Tell me , Margaret , for I can not abide waiting and guessing . "
68727	68877	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" Well , one night as I were going fra ' my lodgings wi ' the help on a lad as belonged to th ' landlady , to find the room where I were to sing , I heard a cough before me , walking along . Thinks I , that 's Jem Wilson 's cough , or I 'm much mistaken . Next time came a sneeze and a cough , and then I were certain . First I hesitated whether I should speak , thinking if it were a stranger he 'd may be think me forrard . [ 41 ] But I knew blind folks must not be nesh about using their tongues , so says I , ' Jem Wilson , is that you ? ' And sure enough it was , and nobody else . Did you know he were in Halifax , Mary ? "
68878	68881	68882	68882	she	2039	" No ; "
68914	69021	68489	68490	Her grandfather	890	" Well , he 's there , however ; he 's putting up an engine for some folks there , for his master . He 's doing well , for he 's getten four or five men under him ; we 'd two or three meetings , and he telled me all about his invention for doing away wi ' the crank , or somewhat . His master 's bought it from him , and ta'en out a patent , and Jem 's a gentleman for life wi ' the money his master gied him . But you 'll ha ' heard all this , Mary ? "
69028	69106	69024	69024	she	2040	" Well , I thought it all happened afore he left Manchester , and then in course you 'd ha ' known . But may be it were all settled after he got to Halifax ; however , he 's gotten two or three hunder pounds for his invention . But what 's up with you , Mary ? you 're sadly out o ' sorts . You 've never been quarrelling wi ' Jem , surely ? "
69179	69272	69273	69273	her	2041	" Oh , Margaret ; do you know Jem came here one night when I were put out , and cross . Oh , dear ! dear ! I could bite my tongue out when I think on it . And he told me how he loved me , and I thought I did not love him , and I told him I did n't ; and , Margaret,—he believed me , and went away so sad , and so angry ; and now I 'd do any thing,—I would , indeed , "
69311	69317	69319	69319	Mary	124	" Tell me , Margaret , "
69337	69355	69319	69319	Mary	124	" what can I do to bring him back to me ? Should I write to him ? "
69356	69359	69361	69362	her friend	469	" No , "
69364	69386	69361	69362	her friend	469	" that would not do . Men are so queer , they like to have a ' the courting to themselves . "
69387	69400	69402	69402	Mary	124	" But I did not mean to write him a courting letter , "
69407	69449	69402	69402	Mary	124	" If you wrote at all , it would be to give him a hint you 'd taken the rue , and would be very glad to have him now . I believe now he 'd rather find that out himself . "
69450	69457	69459	69459	Mary	124	" But he wo n't try , "
69463	69476	69459	69459	Mary	124	" How can he find it out when he 's at Halifax ? "
69477	69513	69515	69515	her	124	" If he 's a will he 's a way , depend upon it . And you would not have him if he 's not a will to you , Mary ! No , dear ! "
69545	69575	69459	69459	Mary	124	" you must just wait and be patient . You may depend upon it , all will end well , and better than if you meddled in it now . "
69576	69586	69588	69588	Mary	124	" But it 's so hard to be patient , "
69590	69663	69588	69588	Mary	124	" Ay , dear ; being patient is the hardest work we , any on us , have to do through life , I take it . Waiting is far more difficult than doing . I 've known that about my sight , and many a one has known it in watching the sick ; but it 's one of God 's lessons we all must learn , one way or another . "
69668	69679	69588	69588	Mary	124	" Have ye been to see his mother of late ? "
69680	69713	69459	69459	Mary	124	" No ; not for some weeks . When last I went she was so frabbit [ 42 ] with me , that I really thought she wished I 'd keep away . "
69714	69810	69811	69811	She	2044	" Well ! if I were you I 'd go . Jem will hear on't , and it will do you far more good in his mind than writing a letter , which , after all , you would find a tough piece of work when you came to settle to it . ' Twould be hard to say neither too much nor too little . But I must be going , grandfather is at home , and it 's our first night together , and he must not be sitting wanting me any longer . "
69823	69904	69811	69811	She	2044	" Mary ! I 've somewhat else I want to say to you , and I do n't rightly know how to begin . You see , grandfather and I know what bad times is , and we know your father is out o ' work , and I 'm getting more money than I can well manage ; and , dear , would you just take this bit o ' gold , and pay me back in good times ? "
69916	69929	69913	69913	she	2044	" Dear Margaret , we 're not so bad pressed as that . "
69954	69987	69913	69913	she	2044	" And yet , dear , if it would not put you out o ' your way,—I would work hard to make it up to you;—but would not your grandfather be vexed ? "
69988	70062	69913	69913	she	2044	" Not he , wench ! It were more his thought than mine , and we have gotten ever so many more at home , so do n't hurry yoursel about paying . It 's hard to be blind , to be sure , else money comes in so easily now to what it used to do ; and it 's downright pleasure to earn it , for I do so like singing . "
70063	70070	70072	70072	Mary	124	" I wish I could sing , "
70079	70161	70072	70072	Mary	124	" Some has one kind o ' gifts , and some another . Many 's the time when I could see , that I longed for your beauty , Mary ! We 're like childer , ever wanting what we han not got . But now I must say just one more word . Remember , if you 're sore pressed for money , we shall take it very unkind if you donnot let us know . Good bye to ye . "
70364	70369	70371	70373	the Lancashire people	2054	" Food gives heart , "
70425	70470	70422	70422	she	124	" She would just step to the post - office , all for no earthly use . For it were to ask if they had n't a letter lying there for her from her foster - son Will Wilson , the sailor - lad . "
70471	70481	70483	70483	Mary	124	" What made her think there were a letter ? "
70485	70660	70483	70483	Mary	124	" Why , yo see , a neighbour as has been in Liverpool , telled us Will 's ship were come in . Now he said last time he were in Liverpool he 'd ha ' come to ha ' seen Alice , but his ship had but a week holiday , and hard work for the men in that time too . So Alice makes sure he 'll come this , and has had her hand behind her ear at every noise in th ' street , thinking it were him . And to - day she were neither to have nor to hold , but off she would go to th ' post , and see if he had na sent her a line to th ' old house near yo . I tried to get her to give up going , for let alone her deafness she 's getten so dark , she can not see five yards afore her ; but no , she would go , poor old body . "
70661	70685	70779	70779	she	124	" I did not know her sight had failed her ; she used to have good eyes enough when she lived near us . "
70686	70705	70483	70483	Mary	124	" Ay , but it 's gone lately a good deal . But you never ask after Jem — "
70719	70722	70724	70724	Mary	124	" No , "
70729	70734	70724	70724	Mary	124	" How is he ? "
70735	70771	70777	70777	Mary	124	" I can not justly say how he is , seeing he 's at Halifax ; but he were very well when he wrote last Tuesday . Han ye heard o ' his good luck ? "
70794	70928	70930	70930	she	2058	" Well ! and did not Margaret tell yo what he 'd done wi ' it ? It 's just like him though , ne'er to say a word about it . Why , when it were paid what does he do , but get his master to help him to buy an income for me and Alice . He had her name put down for her life ; but , poor thing , she 'll not be long to the fore , I 'm thinking . She 's sadly failed of late . And so , Mary , yo see , we 're two ladies o ' property . It 's a matter o ' twenty pound a year they tell me . I wish the twins had lived , bless 'em , "
70937	70976	70930	70930	she	2058	" They should ha ' had the best o ' schooling , and their belly - fulls o ' food . I suppose they 're better off in heaven , only I should so like to see 'em . "
71058	71132	71041	71041	she	127	" He 's been in Africa and that neighbourhood , I believe . He 's a fine chap , but he 's not gotten Jem 's hair . His has too much o ' the red in it . He sent Alice ( but , maybe , she telled you ) a matter o ' five pound when he were over before ; but that were nought to an income , yo know . "
71133	71150	71152	71152	Mary	124	" It 's not every one that can get a hundred or two at a time , "
71154	71179	71181	71181	she	124	" No ! no ! that 's true enough . There 's not many a one like Jem . That 's Alice 's step , "
71233	71237	71239	71240	Mrs. Wilson	114	" No letters ! "
71242	71267	71269	71269	Alice	126	" No , none ! I must just wait another day to hear fra my lad . It 's very dree work , waiting ! "
71290	71303	71305	71305	Alice	126	" If I but knew he were safe , and not drowned ! "
71307	71333	71305	71305	Alice	126	" If I but knew he were drowned , I would ask grace to say , Thy will be done . It 's the waiting . "
71334	71347	71349	71349	Mary	124	" It 's hard work to be patient to all of us , "
71351	71398	71349	71349	Mary	124	" I know I find it so , but I did not know one so good as you did , Alice ; I shall not think so badly of myself for being a bit impatient , now I 've heard you say you find it difficult . "
71424	71498	71421	71421	she	126	" Then , my dear , I ask your pardon , and God 's pardon , too , if I 've weakened your faith , by showing you how feeble mine was . Half our life 's spent in waiting , and it ill becomes one like me , wi ' so many mercies , to grumble . I 'll try and put a bridle o'er my tongue , and my thoughts too . "
71513	71518	71499	71499	She	126	" Come , Alice , "
71523	71564	71520	71521	Mrs. Wilson	114	" do n't fret yoursel for e'er a trifle wrong said here or there . See ! I 've put th ' kettle on , and you and Mary shall ha ' a dish o ' tea in no time . "
71721	71728	71729	71729	she	126	" My bairn!—my own dear bairn ! "
72043	72110	72020	72020	she	126	" My dear ! I shall never forgive mysel , if my wicked words to - night are any stumbling - block in your path . See how the Lord has put coals of fire on my head ! Oh ! Mary , do n't let my being an unbelieving Thomas weaken your faith . Wait patiently on the Lord , whatever your trouble may be . "
72208	72249	72203	72203	she	124	" Come , Mary ! on with bonnet and shawl , or whatever rigging you women require before leaving the house . I 'm sent to fetch you , and I ca n't lose time when I 'm under orders . "
72250	72258	72260	72260	Mary	124	" Where am I to go to ? "
72278	72283	72285	72285	he	2078	" Not very far , "
72287	72364	72285	72285	he	2078	" Only to old Job Legh 's round the corner here . Aunt would have me come and see these new friends of hers , and then we meant to ha ' come on here to see you and your father , but the old gentleman seems inclined to make a night of it , and have you all there . Where 's your father ? I want to see him . He must come too . "
72365	72395	72396	72396	She	2080	" He 's out , but I 'll leave word next door for him to follow me ; that 's to say , if he comes home afore long . "
72401	72410	72396	72396	She	2080	" Is any one else at Job 's ? "
72411	72493	72285	72285	he	2078	" No ! My aunt Jane would not come for some maggot or other ; and as for Jem ! I do n't know what you 've all been doing to him , but he 's as down - hearted a chap as I 'd wish to see . He 's had his sorrows sure enough , poor lad ! But it 's time for him to be shaking off his dull looks , and not go moping like a girl . "
72494	72505	72507	72507	Mary	124	" Then he 's come fra Halifax , is he ? "
72509	72747	72507	72507	Mary	124	" Yes ! his body 's come , but I think he 's left his heart behind him . His tongue I 'm sure he has , as we used to say to childer , when they would not speak . I try to rouse him up a bit , and I think he likes having me with him , but still he 's as gloomy and as dull as can be . ' Twas only yesterday he took me to the works , and you 'd ha ' thought us two Quakers as the spirit had n't moved , all the way down we were so mum . It 's a place to craze a man , certainly ; such a noisy black hole ! There were one or two things worth looking at , the bellows for instance , or the gale they called a bellows . I could ha ' stood near it a whole day ; and if I 'd a berth in that place , I should like to be bellows - man , if there is such a one . But Jem were n't diverted even with that ; he stood as grave as a judge while it blew my hat out o ' my hand . He 's lost all relish for his food , too , which frets my aunt sadly . Come ! Mary , ar'n't you ready ? "
72997	73116	72967	72967	he	135	" Oh ! if you are fond of grubs , and flies , and beetles , there 's no place for 'em like Sierra Leone . I wish you 'd had some of ours ; we had rather too much of a good thing ; we drank them with our drink , and could scarcely keep from eating them with our food . I never thought any folk could care for such fat green beasts as those , or I would ha ' brought you them by the thousand . A plate full o ' peas - soup would ha ' been full enough for you , I dare say ; it were often too full for us . "
73117	73131	73133	73133	Job	135	" I would ha ' given a good deal for some on 'em , "
73135	73188	73133	73133	Job	135	" Well , I knew folk at home liked some o ' the queer things one meets with abroad ; but I never thought they 'd care for them nasty slimy things . I were always on the look - out for a mermaid , for that I knew were a curiosity . "
73189	73198	73200	73200	Job	135	" You might ha ' looked long enough , "
73222	73315	73200	73200	Job	135	" Not so long , master , in some latitudes , as you think . It stands to reason th ' sea hereabouts is too cold for mermaids ; for women here do n't go half - naked on account o ' climate . But I 've been in lands where muslin were too hot to wear on land , and where the sea were more than milk - warm ; and though I 'd never the good luck to see a mermaid in that latitude , I know them that has . "
73316	73323	73325	73325	Mary	124	" Do tell us about it , "
73327	73332	73334	73334	Job	135	" Pooh , pooh ! "
73379	73566	73579	73579	Job	135	" Well , it were Jack Harris , our third mate last voyage , as many and many a time telled us all about it . You see he were becalmed off Chatham Island ( that 's in the Great Pacific , and a warm enough latitude for mermaids , and sharks , and such like perils ) . So some of the men took the long boat , and pulled for the island to see what it were like ; and when they got near , they heard a puffing , like a creature come up to take breath ; you 've never heard a diver ? No ! Well ! you 've heard folks in th ' asthma , and it were for all the world like that . So they looked around , and what should they see but a mermaid , sitting on a rock , and sunning herself . The water is always warmer when it 's rough , you know , so I suppose in the calm she felt it rather chilly , and had come up to warm herself . "
73567	73573	73575	73575	Mary	124	" What was she like ? "
73607	73651	73579	73579	Job	135	" Oh ! Jack used to say she was for all the world as beautiful as any of the wax ladies in the barbers ' shops ; only , Mary , there were one little difference : her hair was bright grass green . "
73652	73661	73663	73663	Mary	124	" I should not think that was pretty , "
73685	73796	73579	73579	Job	135	" Oh ! but it is when you 're used to it . I always think when first we get sight of land , there 's no colour so lovely as grass green . However , she had green hair sure enough ; and were proud enough of it , too ; for she were combing it out full - length when first they saw her . They all thought she were a fair prize , and may be as good as a whale in ready money ( they were whale - fishers you know ) . For some folk think a deal of mermaids , whatever other folk do . "
73815	73860	73802	73802	Job	135	" So , as I were saying , they pulled towards her , thinking to catch her . She were all the while combing her beautiful hair , and beckoning to them , while with the other hand she held a looking - glass . "
73861	73868	73870	73870	Job	135	" How many hands had she ? "
73872	73885	73887	73887	Will	128	" Two , to be sure , just like any other woman , "
73891	73921	73923	73923	Job	135	" Oh ! I thought you said she beckoned with one hand , and combed her hair with another , and held a looking - glass with a third , "
73929	73955	73958	73958	he	135	" No ! I did n't ! at least if I did , I meant she did one thing after another , as any one but "
73965	73973	73802	73802	Job	135	" could understand . Well , Mary , "
73980	74099	73802	73802	Job	135	" when she saw them coming near , whether it were she grew frightened at their fowling - pieces , as they had on board , for a bit o ' shooting on the island , or whether it were she were just a fickle jade as did not rightly know her own mind ( which , seeing one half of her was woman , I think myself was most probable ) , but when they were only about two oars ' length from the rock where she sat , down she plopped into the water , leaving nothing but her hinder end of a fish tail sticking up for a minute , and then that disappeared too . "
74100	74109	74111	74111	Mary	124	" And did they never see her again ? "
74113	74226	74111	74111	Mary	124	" Never so plain ; the man who had the second watch one night declared he saw her swimming round the ship , and holding up her glass for him to look in ; and then he saw the little cottage near Aber in Wales ( where his wife lived ) as plain as ever he saw it in life , and his wife standing outside , shading her eyes as if she were looking for him . But Jack Harris gave him no credit , for he said he were always a bit of a romancer , and beside that , were a home - sick , down - hearted chap . "
74227	74235	74237	74237	Mary	124	" I wish they had caught her , "
74241	74251	74253	74253	Will	128	" They got one thing as belonged to her , "
74255	74288	74253	74253	Will	128	" and that I 've often seen with my own eyes , and I reckon it 's a sure proof of the truth of their story ; for them that wants proof . "
74289	74294	74296	74296	Margaret	136	" What was it ? "
74306	74370	74296	74296	Margaret	136	" Why , in her hurry she left her comb on the rock , and one o ' the men spied it ; so they thought that were better than nothing , and they rowed there and took it , and Jack Harris had it on board the John Cropper , and I saw him comb his hair with it every Sunday morning . "
74371	74377	74379	74379	Mary	124	" What was it like ? "
74394	74425	74379	74379	Mary	124	" Why , if it had not had such a strange yarn belonging to it , you 'd never ha ' noticed it from any other small - tooth comb . "
74426	74433	74435	74436	Job Legh	135	" I should rather think not , "
74539	74560	74535	74535	she	124	" Oh do tell us something more of what you hear and see on board ship . Do , Will ! "
74561	74617	74535	74535	she	124	" What 's the use , Mary , if folk wo n't believe one . There are things I saw with my own eyes , that some people would pish and pshaw at , as if I were a baby to be put down by cross noises . But I 'll tell you , Mary , "
74624	74652	74535	74535	she	124	" some more of the wonders of the sea , sin ' you 're not too wise to believe me . I have seen a fish fly . "
74702	74716	74700	74700	he	135	" Ay , ay ! young man . Now you 're speaking truth . "
74717	74780	74700	74700	he	135	" Well now ! you 'll swallow that , old gentleman . You 'll credit me when I say I 've seen a crittur half fish , half bird , and you wo n't credit me when I say there be such beasts as mermaids , half fish , half woman . To me , one 's just as strange as t'other . "
74781	74789	74791	74791	Margaret	136	" You never saw the mermaid yoursel , "
74796	74804	74806	74807	Will Wilson	2106	" love me , love my dog , "
74815	74823	74812	74812	his	2106	" believe me , believe Jack Harris ; "
74841	74853	74855	74855	Job	135	" It 's the Exocetus ; one of the Malacopterygii Abdominales , "
74860	74979	74981	74981	Will	128	" Ay , there you go ! You 're one o ' them folks as never knows beasts unless they 're called out o ' their names . Put 'em in Sunday clothes and you know 'em , but in their work - a - day English you never know nought about 'em . I 've met wi ' many o ' your kidney ; and if I 'd ha ' known it , I 'd ha ' christened poor Jack 's mermaid wi ' some grand gibberish of a name . Mermaidicus Jack Harrisensis ; that 's just like their new - fangled words . D'ye believe there 's such a thing as the Mermaidicus , master ? "
74994	75003	74984	74984	his	128	" Not I ! Tell me about the — "
75004	75007	75009	75009	Will	128	" Well ! "
75025	75047	74984	74984	his	128	" It were on this last voyage , about a day 's sail from Madeira , that one of our men — "
75048	75056	75058	75058	Job	135	" Not Jack Harris , I hope , "
75060	75064	75066	75066	Will	128	" Called me , "
75073	75139	75140	75140	he	128	" to see the what d'ye call it — flying fish I say it is . It were twenty feet out o ' water , and it flew near on to a hundred yards . But I say , old gentleman , I ha ' gotten one dried , and if you 'll take it , why , I 'll give it you ; only , "
75148	75161	75140	75140	he	128	" I wish you 'd just gie me credit for the Mermaidicus . "
75599	75614	75561	75561	Will	128	" You would n't like a live Manx cat , would ye , master ? "
75615	75619	75621	75621	Job	135	" A what ? "
75623	75632	75634	75634	Will	128	" I do n't know its best name , "
75638	75653	75634	75634	Will	128	" But we call 'em just Manx cats . They 're cats without tails . "
75674	75724	75671	75671	Will	128	" Because I 'm going , afore joining my ship , to see mother 's friends in the island , and would gladly bring you one , if so be you 'd like to have it . They look as queer and out o ' nature as flying fish , or"—he
75734	75813	75815	75815	his	2126	" Especially when you see 'em walking a roof - top , right again the sky , when a cat , as is a proper cat , is sure to stick her tail stiff out behind , like a slack - rope dancer a - balancing ; but these cats having no tail , can not stick it out , which captivates some people uncommonly . If yo'll allow me , I 'll bring one for Miss there , "
75836	75844	75846	75846	Mary	124	" When are you going to sail ? "
75848	75938	75939	75939	Job	226	" I can not justly say ; our ship 's bound for America next voyage , they tell me . A mess - mate will let me know when her sailing - day is fixed ; but I 've got to go to th ' Isle o ' Man first . I promised uncle last time I were in England to go this next time . I may have to hoist the blue Peter any day ; so , make much of me while you have me , Mary . "
75950	75982	75939	75939	Job	226	" Have n't I ? North and South both ! This time we 're bound to North . Yankee - Land , as we call it , where Uncle Sam lives . "
75983	75987	75989	75989	Mary	124	" Uncle who ? "
75991	76020	75989	75989	Mary	124	" Oh , it 's a way sailors have of speaking . I only mean I 'm going to Boston , U. S. , that 's Uncle Sam . "
76069	76075	76077	76077	she	126	" Where 's yo'r father ? "
76079	76094	76095	76095	Alice	126	" I guess he 's at his Union ; he 's there most evenings . "
76176	76316	76165	76165	she	126	" Yo're mourning for me , my dear ; and there 's no need , Mary . I 'm as happy as a child . I sometimes think I am a child , whom the Lord is hushabying to my long sleep . For when I were a nurse - girl , my missis alway telled me to speak very soft and low , and to darken the room that her little one might go to sleep ; and now all noises are hushed and still to me , and the bonny earth seems dim and dark , and I know it 's my Father lulling me away to my long sleep . I 'm very well content , and yo must n't fret for me . I 've had well nigh every blessing in life I could desire . "

76867	76879	76881	76881	you	128	" Sick , and in prison , and ye visited me . "
77770	77780	77781	77781	she	232	" You must listen to me , Jem Wilson , "
77791	77812	77781	77781	she	232	" Go away , missis ; I 've nought to do with you , either in hearkening , or talking . "
77818	77823	77824	77824	she	232	" You must listen , "
77830	77837	77824	77824	she	232	" for Mary Barton 's sake . "
77855	77865	77824	77824	she	232	" He listened like a three - year child . "
77866	77882	77883	77883	He	128	" I know you care enough for her to wish to save her from harm . "
77896	77917	77885	77885	his	128	" And who can yo be to know Mary Barton , or to know that she 's ought to me ? "
77955	77985	77952	77952	she	232	" Do you remember Esther , the sister of John Barton 's wife ? the aunt to Mary ? And the Valentine I sent you last February ten years ? "
77986	78003	78004	78004	He	2183	" Yes , I mind her well ! But yo are not Esther , are you ? "
78041	78070	78022	78022	he	2183	" Why , Esther ! Where han ye been this many a year ? Where han ye been wandering that we none of us could find you out ? "
78083	78196	78197	78197	She	2185	" Where have I been ? What have I been doing ? Why do you torment me with questions like these ? Can you not guess ? But the story of my life is wanted to give force to my speech , afterwards I will tell it you . Nay ! do n't change your fickle mind now , and say you do n't want to hear it . You must hear it , and I must tell it ; and then see after Mary , and take care she does not become like me . As she is loving now , so did I love once ; one above me far . "
78232	78374	78376	78376	her	2186	" He was so handsome , so kind ! Well , the regiment was ordered to Chester ( did I tell you he was an officer ? ) , and he could not bear to part from me , nor I from him , so he took me with him . I never thought poor Mary would have taken it so to heart ! I always meant to send for her to pay me a visit when I was married ; for , mark you ! he promised me marriage . They all do . Then came three years of happiness . I suppose I ought not to have been happy , but I was . I had a little girl , too . Oh ! the sweetest darling that ever was seen ! But I must not think of her , "
78384	78394	78376	78376	her	2186	" or I shall go mad ; I shall . "
78395	78405	78407	78407	Jem	128	" Do n't tell me any more about yoursel , "
78411	78466	78467	78467	her	2186	" What ! you 're tired already , are you ? but I 'll tell you ; as you 've asked for it , you shall hear it . I wo n't recall the agony of the past for nothing . I will have the relief of telling it . Oh , how happy I was!"—sinking
78477	78513	78467	78467	her	2186	" It came like a shot on me when one day he came to me and told me he was ordered to Ireland , and must leave me behind ; at Bristol we then were . "
78531	78600	78519	78519	she	2186	" Oh , do n't abuse him ; do n't speak a word against him ! You do n't know how I love him yet ; yet , when I am sunk so low . You do n't guess how kind he was . He gave me fifty pound before we parted , and I knew he could ill spare it . Do n't , Jem , please , "
78614	78940	78941	78941	she	2187	" I might have done better with the money ; I see now . But I did not know the value of money . Formerly I had earned it easily enough at the factory , and as I had no more sensible wants , I spent it on dress and on eating . While I lived with him , I had it for asking ; and fifty pounds would , I thought , go a long way . So I went back to Chester , where I 'd been so happy , and set up a small - ware shop , and hired a room near . We should have done well , but alas ! alas ! my little girl fell ill , and I could not mind my shop and her too ; and things grew worse and worse . I sold my goods any how to get money to buy her food and medicine ; I wrote over and over again to her father for help , but he must have changed his quarters , for I never got an answer . The landlord seized the few bobbins and tapes I had left , for shop - rent ; and the person to whom the mean little room , to which we had been forced to remove , belonged , threatened to turn us out unless his rent was paid ; it had run on many weeks , and it was winter , cold bleak winter ; and my child was so ill , so ill , and I was starving . And I could not bear to see her suffer , and forgot how much better it would be for us to die together;—oh her moans , her moans , which money would give me the means of relieving ! So I went out into the street , one January night — Do you think God will punish me for that ? "
78994	79020	78986	78986	she	2187	" But it 's no matter ! I 've done that since , which separates us as far asunder as heaven and hell can be . "
79032	79096	79021	79021	Her	2187	" My darling ! my darling ! even after death I may not see thee , my own sweet one ! She was so good — like a little angel . What is that text , I do n't remember,—that text mother used to teach me when I sat on her knee long ago ; it begins , ' Blessed are the pure ' "
79098	79112	79021	79021	Her	2187	" Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God . "
79113	79171	79173	79173	she	2188	" Ay , that 's it ! It would break mother 's heart if she knew what I am now — it did break Mary 's heart , you see . And now I recollect it was about her child I wanted so to see you , Jem . You know Mary Barton , do n't you ? "
79196	79223	79225	79225	she	2188	" Well , there 's something to do for her ; I forget what ; wait a minute ! She is so like my little girl ; "
79305	79776	79295	79295	she	2188	" When I came to Manchester ( for I could not stay in Chester after her death ) , I found you all out very soon . And yet I never thought my poor sister was dead . I suppose I would not think so . I used to watch about the court where John lived , for many and many a night , and gather all I could about them from the neighbours ' talk ; for I never asked a question . I put this and that together , and followed one , and listened to the other ; many 's the time I 've watched the policeman off his beat , and peeped through the chink of the window - shutter to see the old room , and sometimes Mary or her father sitting up late for some reason or another . I found out Mary went to learn dress - making , and I began to be frightened for her ; for it 's a bad life for a girl to be out late at night in the streets , and after many an hour of weary work , they 're ready to follow after any novelty that makes a little change . But I made up my mind , that bad as I was , I could watch over Mary and perhaps keep her from harm . So I used to wait for her at nights , and follow her home , often when she little knew any one was near her . There was one of her companions I never could abide , and I 'm sure that girl is at the bottom of some mischief . By - and - bye , Mary 's walks homewards were not alone . She was joined soon after she came out , by a man ; a gentleman . I began to fear for her , for I saw she was light - hearted , and pleased with his attentions ; and I thought worse of him for having such long talks with that bold girl I told you of . But I was laid up for a long time with spitting of blood ; and could do nothing . I 'm sure it made me worse , thinking about what might be happening to Mary . And when I came out , all was going on as before , only she seemed fonder of him than ever ; and oh Jem ! her father wo n't listen to me , and it 's you must save Mary ! You 're like a brother to her , and maybe could give her advice and watch over her , and at any rate John will hearken to you ; only he 's so stern and so cruel . "
79803	79817	79797	79797	his	128	" Who is this spark that Mary loves ? Tell me his name ! "
79818	79835	79797	79797	his	128	" It 's young Carson , old Carson 's son , that your father worked for . "
79846	79898	79841	79841	She	2190	" Oh ! Jem , I charge you with the care of her ! I suppose it would be murder to kill her , but it would be better for her to die than to live to lead such a life as I do . Do you hear me , Jem ? "
79899	79917	79927	79927	he	2192	" Yes ! I hear you . It would be better . Better we were all dead . "
79936	80034	79927	79927	he	2192	" Esther , you may trust to my doing all I can for Mary . That I have determined on . And now listen to me ! you loathe the life you lead , else you would not speak of it as you do . Come home with me . Come to my mother . She and my aunt Alice live together . I will see that they give you a welcome . And to - morrow I will see if some honest way of living can not be found for you . Come home with me . "
80055	80098	80099	80099	she	2193	" God bless you , Jem , for the words you have just spoken . Some years ago you might have saved me , as I hope and trust you will yet save Mary . But it is too late now;—too late , "
80116	80120	80121	80121	he	2194	" Come home , "
80124	80156	80158	80158	she	2193	" I tell you , I can not . I could not lead a virtuous life if I would . I should only disgrace you . If you will know all , "
80169	80266	80268	80268	she	2193	" I must have drink . Such as live like me could not bear life if they did not drink . It 's the only thing to keep us from suicide . If we did not drink , we could not stand the memory of what we have been , and the thought of what we are , for a day . If I go without food , and without shelter , I must have my dram . Oh ! you do n't know the awful nights I have had in prison for want of it ! "
80295	80304	80268	80268	she	2193	" It is so frightful to see them , "
80316	80408	80268	80268	she	2193	" There they go round and round my bed the whole night through . My mother , carrying little Annie ( I wonder how they got together ) and Mary — and all looking at me with their sad , stony eyes ; oh Jem ! it is so terrible ! They do n't turn back either , but pass behind the head of the bed , and I feel their eyes on me everywhere . If I creep under the clothes I still see them ; and what is worse , "
80416	80452	80268	80268	she	2193	" they see me . Do n't speak to me of leading a better life — I must have drink . I can not pass to - night without a dram ; I dare not . "
80489	80554	80472	80472	She	2193	" You are grieved for me ! I know it better than if you told me in words . But you can do nothing for me . I am past hope . You can yet save Mary . You must . She is innocent , except for the great error of loving one above her in station . Jem ! you will save her ? "
80594	80599	80601	80601	he	128	" Stay a minute , "
80612	80635	80636	80636	She	2193	" I may want to speak to you again . I mun know where to find you — where do you live ? "
80640	80714	80715	80715	she	2193	" And do you think one sunk so low as I am has a home ? Decent , good people have homes . We have none . No , if you want me , come at night , and look at the corners of the streets about here . The colder , the bleaker , the more stormy the night , the more certain you will be to find me . For then , "
80726	80750	80715	80715	she	2193	" it is so cold sleeping in entries , and on door - steps , and I want a dram more than ever . "
81806	81817	81819	81819	he	128	" Rest that is reserved for the people of God . "

86666	86678	86664	86664	he	167	" That a man 's a man for a ' that . "
86723	86762	86718	86718	He	167	" Mary Barton ! let me see . Ay , that is the name of the girl . An arrant flirt , the little hussy is ; but very pretty . Ay , Mary Barton is her name . "
86833	86866	86867	86867	he	128	" She 's a good girl , sir , though may be a bit set up with her beauty ; but she 's her father 's only child , sir , and — "
86898	86948	86949	86949	He	128	" Well , my fine fellow , and what have I to do with that ? It 's but loss of my time , and yours , too , if you 've only stopped me to tell me Mary Barton is very pretty ; I know that well enough . "
87013	87272	87273	87273	Jem	128	" I will tell you in plain words what I have got to say to you , young man . It 's been telled me by one as knows , and has seen , that you walk with this same Mary Barton , and are known to be courting her ; and her as spoke to me about it , thinks as how Mary loves you . That may be , or may not . But I 'm an old friend of hers , and her father 's ; and I just wished to know if you mean to marry the girl . Spite of what you said of her lightness , I ha ' known her long enough to be sure she 'll make a noble wife for any one , let him be what he may ; and I mean to stand by her like a brother ; and if you mean rightly , you 'll not think the worse on me for what I 've now said ; and if — but no , I 'll not say what I 'll do to the man who wrongs a hair of her head . He shall rue it the longest day he lives , that 's all . Now , sir , what I ask of you is this . If you mean fair and honourable by her , well and good ; but if not , for your own sake as well as hers , leave her alone , and never speak to her more . "
87494	87507	87509	87510	Mr. Carson	167	" Before I make you into my confidant , my good man , "
87517	87551	87509	87510	Mr. Carson	167	" I think it might be as well to inquire your right to meddle with our affairs . Neither Mary nor I , as I conceive , called you in as a mediator . "
87588	87648	87583	87583	his	167	" And so , my fine fellow , you will have the kindness to leave us to ourselves , and not meddle with what does not concern you . If you were a brother , or father of hers , the case might have been different . As it is , I can only consider you an impertinent meddler . "
87668	87773	87657	87657	Jem	128	" You say if I had been her brother , or her father , you 'd have answered me what I ask . Now , neither father nor brother could love her as I have loved her , ay , and as I love her still ; if love gives a right to satisfaction , it 's next to impossible any one breathing can come up to my right . Now , sir , tell me ! do you mean fair by Mary or not ? I 've proved my claim to know , and , by G — — , I will know . "
87774	87782	87784	87785	Mr. Carson	167	" Come , come , no impudence , "
87823	87831	87810	87810	she	124	" Father , brother , or rejected lover "
87842	87878	87810	87810	she	124	" no one has a right to interfere between my little girl and me . No one shall . Confound you , man ! get out of my way , or I 'll make you , "
87889	87906	87908	87909	the mechanic	2442	" I wo n't , then , till you 've given me your word about Mary , "
87940	87945	87936	87936	he	2442	" Wo n't you ? "
87953	87960	87936	87936	he	2442	" then I 'll make you . "
88099	88114	88116	88117	the policeman	6054	" Shall I take him to the lock - ups for assault , sir ? "
88119	88124	88126	88127	Mr. Carson	167	" No , no , "
88129	88145	88146	88146	he	167	" I struck him first . It was no assault on his side ; though , "
88174	88187	88188	88188	he	167	" I will never forgive or forget your insult . Trust me , "
88197	88208	88209	88209	He	167	" Mary shall fare no better for your insolent interference . "
88224	88255	88220	88220	Jem	128	excitement—"And if you dare to injure her in the least , I will await you where no policeman can step in between . And God shall judge between us two . "
88311	88338	88305	88306	The policeman	6054	" Take care , my man ! there 's no girl on earth worth what you 'll be bringing on yourself if you do n't mind . "
88923	88981	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" Poor devils ! they 're near enough to starving , I 'm afraid . Mrs. Aldred makes two cows ' heads into soup every week , and people come several miles to fetch it ; and if these times last we must try and do more . But we must not be bullied into any thing ! "
88982	89008	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" A rise of a shilling or so wo n't make much difference , and they will go away thinking they 've gained their point . "
89009	89043	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" That 's the very thing I object to . They 'll think so , and whenever they 've a point to gain , no matter how unreasonable , they 'll strike work . "
89044	89053	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" It really injures them more than us . "
89054	89066	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" I do n't see how our interests can be separated . "
89067	89140	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" The d —— d brute had thrown vitriol on the poor fellow 's ankles , and you know what a bad part that is to heal . He had to stand still with the pain , and that left him at the mercy of the cruel wretch , who beat him about the head till you 'd hardly have known he was a man . They doubt if he 'll live . "
89141	89166	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" If it were only for that , I 'll stand out against them , even if it were the cause of my ruin . "
89167	89193	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" Ay , I for one wo n't yield one farthing to the cruel brutes ; they 're more like wild beasts than human beings . "
89205	89237	89245	89246	a waiter	2492	" I say , Carson , just go and tell Duncombe of this fresh instance of their abominable conduct . He 's wavering , but I think this will decide him . "
90362	90405	90406	90407	The waiter	2562	" There 's a bit on a picture up yonder , as one o ' the gentlemen threw away ; I 've a little lad at home as dearly loves a picture ; by your leave I 'll go up for it . "
90453	90460	90461	90461	he	588	" a bit of a picture , "

91364	91376	91358	91358	his	406	" He 's gotten the gift of the gab , anyhow ! "
91377	91414	91358	91358	his	406	" Ay ! ay ! he knows what he 's about . See how he poured it into us about that there Brutus . He were pretty hard , too , to kill his own son ! "
91415	91447	91449	91449	another	1374	" I could kill mine if he took part wi ' the masters ; to be sure , he 's but a step - son , but that makes no odds , "
91502	91570	91489	91492	The heads clustered together	2631	" That 's John Slater ! I 'd ha ' known him anywhere , by his big nose . Lord ! how like ; that 's me , by G — — , it 's the very way I 'm obligated to pin my waistcoat up , to hide that I 've gotten no shirt . That is a shame , and I 'll not stand it . "
91571	91574	91576	91577	John Slater	247	" Well ! "
91588	91616	91576	91577	John Slater	247	" I could laugh at a jest as well as e'er the best on 'em , though it did tell again mysel , if I were not clemming "
91646	91769	91576	91577	John Slater	247	" and if I could keep from thinking of them at home , as is clemming ; but with their cries for food ringing in my ears , and making me afeard of going home , and wonder if I should hear 'em wailing out , if I lay cold and drowned at th ' bottom o ' th ' canal , there,—why , man , I can not laugh at ought . It seems to make me sad that there is any as can make game on what they 've never knowed ; as can make such laughable pictures on men , whose very hearts within 'em are so raw and sore as ours were and are , God help us . "
91784	92009	92010	92010	He	2634	" It makes me more than sad , it makes my heart burn within me , to see that folk can make a jest of earnest men ; of chaps who comed to ask for a bit o ' fire for th ' old granny , as shivers in th ' cold ; for a bit o ' bedding , and some warm clothing to the poor wife as lies in labour on th ' damp flags ; and for victuals for the childer , whose little voices are getting too faint and weak to cry aloud wi ' hunger . For , brothers , is not them the things we ask for when we ask for more wage ? We donnot want dainties , we want bellyfuls ; we donnot want gimcrack coats and waistcoats , we want warm clothes , and so that we get 'em we 'd not quarrel wi ' what they 're made on . We donnot want their grand houses , we want a roof to cover us from the rain , and the snow , and the storm ; ay , and not alone to cover us , but the helpless ones that cling to us in the keen wind , and ask us with their eyes why we brought 'em into th ' world to suffer ? "
92020	92049	92050	92050	He	2634	" I 've seen a father who had killed his child rather than let it clem before his eyes ; and he were a tender - hearted man . "
92058	92397	92050	92050	He	2634	" We come to th ' masters wi ' full hearts , to ask for them things I named afore . We know that they 've gotten money , as we 've earned for 'em ; we know trade is mending , and that they 've large orders , for which they 'll be well paid ; we ask for our share o ' th ' payment ; for , say we , if th ' masters get our share of payment it will only go to keep servants and horses , to more dress and pomp . Well and good , if yo choose to be fools we 'll not hinder you , so long as you 're just ; but our share we must and will have ; we 'll not be cheated . We want it for daily bread , for life itself ; and not for our own lives neither ( for there 's many a one here , I know by mysel , as would be glad and thankful to lie down and die out o ' this weary world ) , but for the lives of them little ones , who do n't yet know what life is , and are afeard of death . Well , we come before th ' masters to state what we want , and what we must have , afore we 'll set shoulder to their work ; and they say , ' No . ' One would think that would be enough of hard - heartedness , but it is n't . They go and make jesting pictures of us ! I could laugh at mysel , as well as poor John Slater there ; but then I must be easy in my mind to laugh . Now I only know that I would give the last drop o ' my blood to avenge us on yon chap , who had so little feeling in him as to make game on earnest , suffering men ! "
92421	92986	92418	92418	John	247	" You 'll wonder , chaps , how I came to miss the time this morning ; I 'll just tell you what I was a - doing . Th ' chaplain at the New Bailey sent and gived me an order to see Jonas Higginbotham ; him as was taken up last week for throwing vitriol in a knob - stick 's face . Well , I could n't help but go ; and I did n't reckon it would ha ' kept me so late . Jonas were like one crazy when I got to him ; he said he could na get rest night or day for th ' face of the poor fellow he had damaged ; then he thought on his weak , clemmed look , as he tramped , foot - sore , into town ; and Jonas thought , may be , he had left them at home as would look for news , and hope and get none , but , haply , tidings of his death . Well , Jonas had thought on these things till he could not rest , but walked up and down continually like a wild beast in his cage . At last he bethought him on a way to help a bit , and he got th ' chaplain to send for me ; and he telled me this ; and that th ' man were lying in th ' Infirmary , and he bade me go ( to - day 's the day as folk may be admitted into th ' Infirmary ) and get his silver watch , as was his mother 's , and sell it as well as I could , and take the money , and bid the poor knob - stick send it to his friends beyond Burnley ; and I were to take him Jonas 's kind regards , and he humbly axed him to forgive him . So I did what Jonas wished . But bless your life , none on us would ever throw vitriol again ( at least at a knob - stick ) if they could see the sight I saw to - day . The man lay , his face all wrapped in cloths , so I did n't see that ; but not a limb , nor a bit of a limb , could keep from quivering with pain . He would ha ' bitten his hand to keep down his moans , but could n't , his face hurt him so if he moved it e'er so little . He could scarce mind me when I telled him about Jonas ; he did squeeze my hand when I jingled the money , but when I axed his wife 's name he shrieked out , ' Mary , Mary , shall I never see you again ? Mary , my darling , they 've made me blind because I wanted to work for you and our own baby ; oh , Mary , Mary ! ' Then the nurse came , and said he were raving , and that I had made him worse . And I 'm afeard it was true ; yet I were loth to go without knowing where to send the money . … So that kept me beyond my time , chaps . "
92987	92998	92418	92418	John	247	" Did yo hear where the wife lived at last ? "
93004	93110	92418	92418	John	247	" No ! he went on talking to her , till his words cut my heart like a knife . I axed th ' nurse to find out who she was , and where she lived . But what I 'm more especial naming it now for is this,—for one thing I wanted yo all to know why I were n't at my post this morning ; for another , I wish to say , that I , for one , ha ' seen enough of what comes of attacking knob - sticks , and I 'll ha nought to do with it no more . "
93125	93133	93134	93134	he	247	" Nay ! I 'm no coward , "
93137	93262	93134	93134	he	247	" and I 'm true to th ' backbone . What I would like , and what I would do , would be to fight the masters . There 's one among yo called me a coward . Well ! every man has a right to his opinion ; but since I 've thought on th ' matter to - day , I 've thought we han all on us been more like cowards in attacking the poor like ourselves ; them as has none to help , but mun choose between vitriol and starvation . I say we 're more cowardly in doing that than in leaving them alone . No ! what I would do is this . Have at the masters ! "
93267	93273	93264	93264	he	2636	" Have at the masters ! "
93284	93341	93369	93369	one	406	" It 's the masters as has wrought this woe ; it 's the masters as should pay for it . Him as called me coward just now , may try if I am one or not . Set me to serve out the masters , and see if there 's ought I 'll stick at . "
93342	93367	93369	93369	one	406	" It would give th ' masters a bit on a fright if one on them were beaten within an inch of his life , "
93371	93384	93386	93386	another	1374	" Ay ! or beaten till no life were left in him , "
93789	93809	93776	93776	He	2653	" Why , Will ! what 's the matter with you ? You seem quite cut up about something ! "
93810	93840	93776	93776	He	2653	" And I am , Mary ! I 'm come to say good - bye ; and few folk like to say good - bye to them they love . "
93841	93859	93860	93860	Mary	124	" Good - bye ! Bless me , Will , that 's sudden , is n't it ? "
93912	93922	93924	93924	she	124	" It 's very sudden , is n't it ? "
93930	93938	93940	93940	he	128	" Yes ! it 's very sudden , "
93944	93951	93953	93953	himself	128	" No , it is n't ; "
93963	93996	93959	93959	he	128	" The captain told me in a fortnight he would be ready to sail again ; but it comes very sudden on me , I had got so fond of you all . "
94011	94047	94007	94007	She	124	" But it 's not a fortnight since you came . Not a fortnight since you knocked at Jane Wilson 's door , and I was there , you remember . Nothing like a fortnight ! "
94048	94160	94162	94162	he	2655	" No ; I know it 's not . But , you see , I got a letter this afternoon from Jack Harris , to tell me our ship sails on Tuesday next ; and it 's long since I promised my uncle ( my mother 's brother , him that lives at Kirk - Christ , beyond Ramsay , in the Isle of Man ) that I 'd go and see him and his , this time of coming ashore . I must go . I 'm sorry enough ; but I must n't slight poor mother 's friends . I must go . Do n't try to keep me , "
94179	94222	94162	94162	he	2655	" I 'm not a - going , Will . I dare say you 're right ; only I ca n't help feeling sorry you 're going away . It seems so flat to be left behind . When do you go ? "
94223	94235	94007	94007	She	124	" To - night . I sha n't see you again . "
94236	94267	94007	94007	She	124	" To - night ! and you go to Liverpool ! May be you and father will go together . He 's going to Glasgow , by way of Liverpool . "
94268	94288	94162	94162	he	2655	" No ! I 'm walking ; and I do n't think your father will be up to walking . "
94289	94312	94007	94007	She	124	" Well ! and why on earth are you walking ? You can get by railway for three - and - sixpence . "
94313	94395	94007	94007	She	124	" Ay , but Mary ! ( thou must n't let out what I 'm going to tell thee ) I have n't got three shillings , no , nor even a sixpence left , at least not here ; before I came here I gave my landlady enough to carry me to the island and back , and may be a trifle for presents , and I brought all the rest here ; and it 's all gone but this , "
94404	94418	94420	94420	he	2656	" Nay , never fret over my walking a matter of thirty mile , "
94431	94526	94420	94420	he	2656	" It 's a fine clear night , and I shall set off betimes , and get in afore the Manx packet sails . Where 's your father going ? To Glasgow , did you say ? Perhaps he and I may have a bit of a trip together then , for , if the Manx boat has sailed when I get into Liverpool , I shall go by a Scotch packet . What 's he going to do in Glasgow?—Seek for work ? Trade is as bad there as here , folk say . "
94527	94534	94536	94536	Mary	124	" No ; he knows that , "
94540	94645	94646	94646	Mary	124	" I sometimes think he 'll never get work again , and that trade will never mend . It 's very hard to keep up one 's heart . I wish I were a boy , I 'd go to sea with you . It would be getting away from bad news at any rate ; and now , there 's hardly a creature that crosses the door - step , but has something sad and unhappy to tell one . Father is going as a delegate from his Union , to ask help from the Glasgow folk . He 's starting this evening . "
94666	94692	94694	94696	the young sailor	2088	" You say no one crosses the threshold but has something sad to say ; you do n't mean that Margaret Jennings has any trouble ? "
94700	94703	94705	94705	Mary	124	" No ! "
94711	94770	94705	94705	Mary	124	" she 's the only one I know , I believe , who seems free from care . Her blindness almost appears a blessing sometimes ; she was so downhearted when she dreaded it , and now she seems so calm and happy when it 's downright come . No ! Margaret 's happy , I do think . "
94771	94781	94783	94783	Will	127	" I could almost wish it had been otherwise , "
94787	94809	94783	94783	Will	127	" I could have been so glad to comfort her , and cherish her , if she had been in trouble . "
94810	94825	94827	94827	Mary	124	" And why ca n't you cherish her , even though she is happy ? "
94829	94892	94827	94827	Mary	124	" Oh ! I do n't know . She seems so much better than I am ! And her voice ! When I hear it , and think of the wishes that are in my heart , it seems as much out of place to ask her to be my wife , as it would be to ask an angel from heaven . "
94975	94994	94972	94972	he	2660	" Ay , you may laugh , Mary ; it only shows you 've never been in love . "
95055	95166	95168	95168	he	2661	" I thought — I think , that when I come back from this voyage , I will speak . It 's my fourth voyage in the same ship , and with the same captain , and he 's promised he 'll make me second mate after this trip ; then I shall have something to offer Margaret ; and her grandfather , and aunt Alice , shall live with her , to keep her from being lonesome while I 'm at sea . I 'm speaking as if she cared for me , and would marry me ; d'ye think she does care at all for me , Mary ? "
95204	95224	95201	95201	she	124	" You must ask Margaret , not me , Will ; she 's never named your name to me . "
95229	95271	95201	95201	she	124	" But I should say that was a good sign from a girl like her . I 've no right to say what I think ; but , if I was you , I would not leave her now without speaking . "
95272	95350	95352	95352	he	2662	" No ! I can not speak ! I have tried . I 've been in to wish them good - bye , and my voice stuck in my throat . I could say nought of what I 'd planned to say ; and I never thought of being so bold as to offer her marriage till I 'd been my next trip , and been made mate . I could not even offer her this box , "
95365	95438	95352	95352	he	2662	" I longed to buy her something , and I thought , if it were something in the music line , she would may - be fancy it more . So , will you give it to her , Mary , when I 'm gone ? and , if you can slip in something tender,—something , you know , of what I feel,—may - be she would listen to you , Mary . "
95450	95838	95352	95352	he	2662	" I shall be thinking on her many and many a night , when I 'm keeping my watch in mid - sea ; I wonder if she will ever think on me when the wind is whistling , and the gale rising . You 'll often speak of me to her , Mary ? And if I should meet with any mischance , tell her how dear , how very dear , she was to me , and bid her , for the sake of one who loved her well , try and comfort my poor aunt Alice . Dear old aunt ! you and Margaret will often go and see her , wo n't you ? She 's sadly failed since I was last ashore . And so good as she has been ! When I lived with her , a little wee chap , I used to be wakened by the neighbours knocking her up ; this one was ill , or that body 's child was restless ; and , for as tired as ever she might be , she would be up and dressed in a twinkling , never thinking of the hard day 's wash afore her next morning . Them were happy times ! How pleased I used to be when she would take me into the fields with her to gather herbs ! I 've tasted tea in China since then , but it was n't half so good as the herb tea she used to make for me o ' Sunday nights . And she knew such a deal about plants and birds , and their ways ! She used to tell me long stories about her childhood , and we used to plan how we would go sometime , please God ( that was always her word ) , and live near her old home beyond Lancaster ; in the very cottage where she was born if we could get it . Dear ! and how different it is ! Here is she still in a back street o ' Manchester , never likely to see her own home again ; and I , a sailor , off for America next week . I wish she had been able to go to Burton once afore she died . "
95839	95850	95852	95852	Mary	124	" She would may be have found all sadly changed , "
95862	95954	95852	95852	Mary	124	" Ay ! ay ! I dare say it 's best . One thing I do wish though , and I have often wished it when out alone on the deep sea , when even the most thoughtless ca n't choose but think on th ' past and th ' future ; and that is , that I 'd never grieved her . Oh Mary ! many a hasty word comes sorely back on the heart , when one thinks one shall never see the person whom one has grieved again ! "
95964	95978	95961	95961	Mary	124	" That 's father 's step . And his shirt 's not ready ! "
96029	96039	96041	96042	the sailor	4943	" I 'm come to bid you good bye , "
96061	96069	96057	96057	John	110	" Good bye to ye , then . "
96142	96168	96127	96127	he	110	" You 'll think on me on Tuesday , Mary . That 's the day we shall hoist our blue Peter , Jack Harris says . "
96290	96309	96286	96286	She	124	" When are you going , father ? I do n't know the time o ' the trains . "
96310	96317	96319	96319	he	450	" And why shouldst thou know ? "
96323	96341	96319	96319	he	450	" Meddle with thy ironing , but donnot be asking questions about what does n't concern thee . "
96342	96353	96355	96355	she	124	" I wanted to get you something to eat first , "
96359	96373	96375	96375	he	450	" Thou dost not know that I 'm larning to do without food , "
96501	96526	96560	96560	he	450	" If thou'rt doing that for me , Mary , thou may'st spare thy labour . I telled thee I were not for eating . "
96527	96538	96540	96540	Mary	124	" Just a little bit , father , before starting , "
96703	96713	96714	96714	he	450	" So thou'rt off to Glasgow , art thou ? "
96719	96722	96714	96714	he	450	" Ay . "
96723	96728	96758	96758	her	124	" When art starting ? "
96729	96734	96714	96714	he	450	" To - night . "
96735	96745	96714	96714	he	450	" That I knowed . But by what train ? "
96874	96883	96865	96865	she	124	" When does thy father start , Mary ? "
96889	96910	96865	96865	she	124	" Oh ! very soon . I 'm just getting him a bit of supper . Is Margaret very well ? "
96911	96974	97121	97122	her father	450	" Yes , she 's well enough . She 's meaning to go and keep Alice Wilson company for an hour or so this evening ; as soon as she thinks her nephew will have started for Liverpool ; for she fancies the old woman will feel a bit lonesome . Th ' Union is paying for your father , I suppose ? "
96975	96995	97121	97122	her father	450	" Yes , they 've given him a sovereign . You 're one of th ' Union , Job ? "
96996	97118	96865	96865	she	124	" Ay ! I 'm one , sure enough ; but I 'm but a sleeping partner in the concern . I were obliged to become a member for peace , else I do n't go along with 'em . Yo see they think themselves wise , and me silly , for differing with them ; well ! there 's no harm in that . But then they wo n't let me be silly in peace and quietness , but will force me to be as wise as they are ; now that 's not British liberty , I say . I 'm forced to be wise according to their notions , else they parsecute me , and sarve me out . "
97162	97286	97155	97155	Job	135	" You see my folly is this , Mary . I would take what I could get ; I think half a loaf is better than no bread . I would work for low wages rather than sit idle and starve . But , comes the Trades ' Union , and says , ' Well , if you take the half - loaf , we 'll worry you out of your life . Will you be clemmed , or will you be worried ? ' Now clemming is a quiet death , and worrying is n't , so I choose clemming , and come into th ' Union . But I wish they 'd leave me free , if I am a fool . "
97370	97390	97353	97353	He	450	" Oh ! father , do n't go yet . Your supper is all ready . Stay one moment ! "
97463	97477	97478	97478	She	124	" God bless thee , Mary!—God in heaven bless thee , poor child ! "
97486	97521	97478	97478	She	124	" Do n't go yet , father ; I ca n't bear you to go yet . Come in , and eat some supper ; you look so ghastly ; dear father , do ! "
97522	97525	97526	97526	he	450	" No , "
97533	97567	97526	97526	he	450	" It 's best as it is . I could n't eat , and it 's best to be off . I can not be still at home . I must be moving . "
97748	97753	97769	97769	he	110	" Mammy , mammy . "
98023	98028	98032	98032	him	681	" Well , Mary , "
98035	98096	98032	98032	him	681	" I thought you 'd be a bit lonely to - night ; and as Margaret were going to cheer th ' old woman , I said I 'd go and keep th ' young un company ; and a very pleasant , chatty evening we 've had ; very . Only I wonder as Margaret is not come back . "
98097	98103	98105	98105	Mary	124	" But perhaps she is , "
98107	98123	98125	98125	he	681	" No , no , I took care o ' that . Look ye here ! "
98134	98165	98125	98125	he	681	" She 'll have to stand waiting i ' th ' street , and that I 'm sure she would n't do , when she knew where to find me . "
98166	98174	98176	98176	Mary	124	" Will she come back by hersel ? "
98178	98313	98176	98176	Mary	124	" Ay . At first I were afraid o ' trusting her , and I used to follow her a bit behind ; never letting on , of course . But , bless you ! she goes along as steadily as can be ; rather slow , to be sure , and her head a bit on one side as if she were listening . And it 's real beautiful to see her cross the road . She 'll wait above a bit to hear that all is still ; not that she 's so dark as not to see a coach or a cart like a big black thing , but she ca n't rightly judge how far off it is by sight , so she listens . Hark ! that 's her ! "
98333	98342	98344	98344	Job	135	" What 's the matter , my wench ? "
98348	98359	98344	98344	Job	135	" Oh ! grandfather ! Alice Wilson 's so bad ! "
98390	98401	98403	98403	Mary	124	" What is it ? Do tell us , Margaret ! "
98418	98441	98403	98403	Mary	124	" I think it 's a stroke o ' the palsy . Any rate she has lost the use of one side . "
98442	98451	98453	98453	Mary	124	" Was it afore Will had set off ? "
98455	98466	98468	98468	Margaret	136	" No ; he were gone before I got there , "
98470	98583	98468	98468	Margaret	136	" and she were much about as well as she has been this many a day . She spoke a bit , but not much ; but that were only natural , for Mrs. Wilson likes to have the talk to hersel , you know . She got up to go across the room , and then I heard a drag wi ' her leg , and presently a fall , and Mrs. Wilson came running , and set up such a cry ! I stopped wi ' Alice , while she fetched a doctor ; but she could not speak , to answer me , though she tried , I think . "
98584	98598	98719	98719	she	136	" Where was Jem ? Why did n't he go for the doctor ? "
98599	98617	98719	98719	she	136	" He were out when I got there , and he never came home while I stopped . "
98618	98630	98632	98632	Job	135	" Thou'st never left Mrs. Wilson alone wi ' poor Alice ? "
98636	98641	98643	98643	Margaret	136	" No , no , "
98645	98701	98643	98643	Margaret	136	" But , oh ! grandfather ; it 's now I feel how hard it is to have lost my sight . I should have so loved to nurse her ; and I did try , until I found I did more harm than good . Oh ! grandfather ; if I could but see ! "
98723	98769	98719	98719	she	136	" No ! I went round by Mrs. Davenport 's , and she were hard at work ; but , the minute I told my errand , she were ready and willing to go to Jane Wilson , and stop up all night with Alice . "
98770	98778	98780	98780	Mary	124	" And what does the doctor say ? "
98782	98865	98866	98866	Margaret	136	" Oh ! much what all doctors say : he puts a fence on this side , and a fence on that , for fear he should be caught tripping in his judgment . One moment he does not think there 's much hope — but while there is life there is hope ; th ' next he says he should think she might recover partial , but her age is again her . He 's ordered her leeches to her head . "
98907	98936	98938	98938	Mary	124	" I 'll go first thing to - morrow morning , and learn how she is ; and I 'll bring word back before I go to work , "
98940	98950	98952	98952	Job	135	" It 's a bad job Will 's gone , "
98954	98964	98966	98966	Margaret	136	" Jane does not think she knows any one , "
98968	99008	98966	98966	Margaret	136	" It 's perhaps as well he should n't see her now , for they say her face is sadly drawn . He 'll remember her with her own face better , if he does not see her again . "

99590	99596	99597	99597	she	171	" What o'clock is that ? "
99600	99603	99605	99605	Amy	170	" Eight , "
99607	99637	99605	99605	Amy	170	" Oh dear ! how tired I am ! Is Harry come in ? Tea would rouse one up a little . Are not you worn out , Helen ? "
99638	99677	99580	99582	the sleeping sister	2722	" Yes ; I am tired enough . One is good for nothing the day after a dance . Yet I do n't feel weary at the time ; I suppose it is the lateness of the hours . "
99678	99735	99605	99605	Amy	170	" And yet , how could it be managed otherwise ? So many do n't dine till five or six , that one can not begin before eight or nine ; and then it takes a long time to get into the spirit of the evening . It is always more pleasant after supper than before . "
99736	99765	99605	99605	Amy	170	" Well , I 'm too tired to - night to reform the world in the matter of dances or balls . What are you copying , Amy ? "
99766	99777	99580	99582	the sleeping sister	2722	" Only that little Spanish air you sing—'Quien quiera . ' "
99778	99786	99788	99788	Helen	172	" What are you copying it for ? "
99790	99811	99788	99788	Helen	172	" Harry asked me to do it for him this morning at breakfast - time,—for Miss Richardson , he said . "
99812	99817	99819	99819	Sophy	171	" For Jane Richardson ! "
99833	99847	99849	99849	Helen	172	" Do you think Harry means any thing by his attention to her ? "
99851	99879	99849	99849	Helen	172	" Nay , I do not know any thing more than you do ; I can only observe and conjecture . What do you think , Helen ? "
99880	99942	99788	99788	Helen	172	" Harry always likes to be of consequence to the belle of the room . If one girl is more admired than another , he likes to flutter about her , and seem to be on intimate terms with her . That is his way , and I have not noticed any thing beyond that in his manner to Jane Richardson . "
99943	100008	99788	99788	Helen	172	" But I do n't think she knows it 's only his way . Just watch her the next time we meet her when Harry is there , and see how she crimsons , and looks another way when she feels he is coming up to her . I think he sees it , too , and I think he is pleased with it . "
100009	100047	99849	99849	Helen	172	" I dare say Harry would like well enough to turn the head of such a lovely girl as Jane Richardson . But I 'm not convinced that he is in love , whatever she may be . "
100048	100053	100055	100055	Sophy	171	" Well , then ! "
100059	100114	100055	100055	Sophy	171	" though it is our own brother , I do think he is behaving very wrongly . The more I think of it the more sure I am that she thinks he means something , and that he intends her to think so . And then , when he leaves off paying her attention — "
100115	100129	100131	100131	Helen	172	" Which will be as soon as a prettier girl makes her appearance , "
100133	100144	100146	100146	Sophy	171	" As soon as he leaves off paying her attention , "
100148	100185	100146	100146	Sophy	171	" she will have many and many a heart - ache , and then she will harden herself into being a flirt , a feminine flirt , as he is a masculine flirt . Poor girl ! "
100186	100199	100201	100201	Amy	170	" I do n't like to hear you speak so of Harry , "
100208	100263	100264	100264	Helen	172	" And I do n't like to have to speak so , Amy , for I love him dearly . He is a good , kind brother , but I do think him vain , and I think he hardly knows the misery , the crimes , to which indulged vanity may lead him . "
100267	100288	100264	100264	Helen	172	" Oh ! do you think we may ring for tea ? Sleeping after dinner always makes me so feverish . "
100289	100299	100301	100304	the more energetic Sophy	2723	" Yes , surely . Why should not we ? "
100313	100319	100321	100321	she	172	" Tea directly , Parker , "
100468	100470	100473	100473	her	2728	" Nurse "
100601	100610	100612	100612	Amy	170	" Dear nurse , what is the matter ? "
100614	100620	100612	100612	Amy	170	" Are not you well ? "

100731	100756	100814	100814	she	2728	" My children ! I do n't know how to break it to you . My dears , poor Mr. Harry is brought home — "
100757	100766	100814	100814	she	2728	" Brought home — brought home — how ? "
100817	100820	100814	100814	she	2728	" Dead ! "
100938	100942	100944	100944	Sophy	171	" Tell me , "
100963	100994	100996	100996	she	171	" tell me , nurse ! Is he dead , did you say ? Have you sent for a doctor ? Oh ! send for one , send for one , "
101025	101048	101010	101010	Helen	172	" My dears , he is dead ! But I have sent for a doctor . I have done all I could . "
101049	101061	101063	101063	Sophy	171	" When did he — when did they bring him home ? "
101065	101077	101063	101063	Sophy	171	" Perhaps ten minutes ago . Before you rang for Parker . "
101078	101110	101111	101111	She	171	" How did he die ? Where did they find him ? He looked so well . He always seemed so strong . Oh ! are you sure he is dead ? "
101125	101182	101183	101183	She	256	" Miss Sophy , I have not told you all . Can you bear to hear it ? Remember , master is in the next room , and he knows nothing yet . Come , you must help me to tell him . Now be quiet , dear ! It was no common death he died ! "
101211	101229	101230	101230	Sophy	171	" He has been shot as he was coming home along Turner Street , to - night . "
101245	101271	101230	101230	Sophy	171	" My dear , you must rouse yourself , and remember your father and mother have yet to be told . Speak ! Miss Sophy ! "
101323	101347	101315	101315	she	171	" What do you want me to do , nurse ? Go to Helen and poor Amy . See , they want help . "
101348	101411	101412	101412	Sophy	171	" Poor creatures ! we must let them alone for a bit . You must go to master ; that 's what I want you to do , Miss Sophy . You must break it to him , poor old gentleman . Come , he 's asleep in the dining - room , and the men are waiting to speak to him . "
101422	101442	101315	101315	she	171	" Oh ! I can not go in . I can not tell him . What must I say ? "
101443	101460	101315	101315	she	171	" I 'll come with you , Miss Sophy . Break it to him by degrees . "
101461	101483	101486	101486	she	171	" I ca n't , nurse . My head throbs so , I shall be sure to say the wrong thing . "
101586	101589	101591	101591	she	171	" Papa , "
101600	101603	101604	101604	she	171	" Papa ! "

101630	101646	101627	101627	he	450	" No ! papa , but something very dreadful — very sad , has happened ! "
101672	101680	101682	101682	nurse	5662	" Master Henry is not come back , "
101709	101750	101684	101684	Her	5662	" Harry ! oh no ! he had to attend a meeting of the masters about these cursed turn - outs . I do n't expect him yet . What are you looking at me so strangely for , Sophy ? "
101751	101761	101763	101763	she	171	" Oh , papa , Harry is come back , "
101769	101775	101777	101777	he	450	" What do you mean ? "
101789	101841	101777	101777	he	450	" One of you says he is not come home , and the other says he is . Now that 's nonsense ! Tell me at once what 's the matter . Did he go on horseback to town ? Is he thrown ? Speak , child , ca n't you ? "
101842	101853	101855	101855	Sophy	171	" No ! he 's not been thrown , papa , "
101859	101866	101869	101870	the nurse	6231	" But he 's badly hurt , "
101882	101896	101898	101898	he	450	" Hurt ? Where ? How ? Have you sent for a doctor ? "
101910	101935	101898	101898	he	450	" Yes , papa , we 've sent for a doctor — but I 'm afraid — I believe it 's of no use . "
102010	102018	102020	102020	he	450	" Go ! you are not Harry , "
102028	102037	102039	102039	he	450	" Where is he ? where is the — "
102060	102067	102069	102069	nurse	5662	" In the servants ' hall , "
102071	102096	102069	102069	nurse	5662	" Two policemen and another man brought him home . They would be glad to speak to you when you are able , sir . "
102097	102103	102105	102105	he	450	" I am able now , "
102193	102206	102208	102208	nurse	5662	" You had better go back to your sisters , Miss Sophy , "
102392	102398	102399	102399	he	167	" How did he die ? "
102660	102666	102657	102657	he	167	" Where was he shot ? "
102718	102727	102729	102730	one policeman	2789	" He must have been close upon him , "
102732	102743	102745	102746	the other	902	" And have had him between him and the sky , "
102860	102883	102884	102884	His	167	" Take her away , nurse . It is no sight for her . Tell Miss Sophy to go to her mother . "
102999	103012	103014	103014	he	167	" It was just what I was going to request of you , "
103063	103075	103059	103060	Mr. Carson	167	" You probably have heard that I am a rich man . "
103082	103111	103076	103077	The superintendent	2784	" Well , sir , half — nay , if necessary , the whole of my fortune I will give to have the murderer brought to the gallows . "
103112	103219	103410	103411	the father	402	" Every exertion , you may be sure , sir , shall be used on our part ; but probably offering a handsome reward might accelerate the discovery of the murderer . But what I wanted particularly to tell you , sir , is that one of my men has already got some clue , and that another ( who accompanied me here ) has within this quarter of an hour found a gun in the field which the murderer crossed , and which he probably threw away when pursued , as encumbering his flight . I have not the smallest doubt of discovering the murderer . "
103220	103229	103231	103232	Mr. Carson	167	" What do you call a handsome reward ? "
103234	103263	103231	103232	Mr. Carson	167	" Well , sir , three , or five hundred pounds is a munificent reward : more than will probably be required as a temptation to any accomplice . "
103264	103270	103272	103273	Mr. Carson	167	" Make it a thousand , "
103277	103289	103272	103273	Mr. Carson	167	" It 's the doing of those damned turn - outs . "
103290	103295	103297	103298	the superintendent	2784	" I imagine not , "
103300	103401	103297	103298	the superintendent	2784	" Some days ago the man I was naming to you before , reported to the inspector when he came on his beat , that he had had to separate your son from a young man , who by his dress he believed to be employed in a foundry ; that the man had thrown Mr. Carson down , and seemed inclined to proceed to more violence , when the policeman came up and interfered . Indeed , my man wished to give him in charge for an assault , but Mr. Carson would not allow that to be done . "
103402	103408	103410	103411	the father	402	" Just like him!—noble fellow ! "
103413	103458	103410	103411	the father	402	" But after your son had left , the man made use of some pretty strong threats . And it 's rather a curious coincidence that this scuffle took place in the very same spot where the murder was committed ; in Turner Street . "
103504	103530	103473	103473	Sophy	171	" She will not leave Harry , and talks so strangely . Indeed — indeed — papa , I think she has lost her senses . "
103538	103543	103545	103546	Mr. Carson	167	" Where is she ? "
103548	103553	103545	103546	Mr. Carson	167	" In his room . "
103764	103772	103774	103774	she	2827	" I am glad you are come , "
103786	103837	103774	103774	she	2827	" Harry is so full of fun , he always has something new to amuse us with ; and now he pretends he is asleep , and that we ca n't waken him . Look ! he is smiling now ; he hears I have found him out . Look ! "
103876	103881	103883	103883	she	2827	" Look , Amy , "
103905	103954	103966	103966	nurse	5662	" Oh , he was always a rogue ! You remember , do n't you , love ? how full of play he was as a baby ; hiding his face under my arm , when you wanted to play with him . Always a rogue , Harry ! "
103955	103964	103966	103966	nurse	5662	" We must get her away , sir , "
103968	103979	103966	103966	nurse	5662	" you know there is much to be done before — "
103980	103986	103988	103989	the father	402	" I understand , nurse , "
104009	104014	104016	104016	he	402	" Come , love , "
104021	104040	104016	104016	he	402	" I want you to come with me . I want to speak to you down - stairs . "
104041	104046	104048	104048	she	5662	" I 'm coming , "
104052	104084	104086	104086	she	5662	" perhaps , after all , nurse , he 's really tired , and would be glad to sleep . Do n't let him get cold , though,—he feels rather chilly , "
104177	104180	104182	104182	she	5662	" Come , "
104187	104229	104182	104182	she	5662	" nurse wants us to go ; and besides , we ought to be with mamma . Papa told the man he was talking to , when I went for him , to wait , and she must not be left . "
104369	104381	104382	104383	The superintendent	2784	" I beg your pardon , sir , for leaving you . "
104535	104541	104543	104543	he	167	" You will not forget , "
104545	104551	104552	104553	The policeman	6054	" I trust to you . "
104556	104670	104552	104553	The policeman	6054	" Spare no money . The only purpose for which I now value wealth is to have the murderer arrested , and brought to justice . My hope in life now is to see him sentenced to death . Offer any rewards . Name a thousand pounds in the placards . Come to me at any hour , night or day , if that be required . All I ask of you is , to get the murderer hanged . Next week , if possible — to - day is Friday . Surely , with the clues you already possess , you can muster up evidence sufficient to have him tried next week . "
104671	104692	104694	104695	the superintendent	2784	" He may easily request an adjournment of his trial , on the ground of the shortness of the notice , "
104697	104723	104694	104695	the superintendent	2784	" Oppose it , if possible . I will see that the first lawyers are employed . I shall know no rest while he lives . "
104724	104733	104552	104553	The policeman	6054	" Every thing shall be done , sir . "
104734	104748	104749	104750	The superintendent	2784	" You will arrange with the coroner . Ten o'clock , if convenient . "
104779	104786	104787	104787	he	167	" My son ! my son ! "
104793	104805	104787	104787	he	167	" But you shall be avenged , my poor murdered boy . "
105089	105135	105081	105081	She	124	" Margaret , wench ! why she 's been gone to Wilson 's these two hours . Ay ! sure , you did say last night you would go ; but she could na rest in her bed , so was off betimes this morning . "
105545	105624	105528	105528	her	124	" I mun be hastening home , but I 'll come again to - night , time enough to iron her cap ; ' twould be a sin and a shame if we let her go dirty now she 's ill , when she 's been so rare and clean all her life - long . But she 's sadly forsaken , poor thing ! She 'll not know you , Mary ; she knows none on us . "
105683	105690	105691	105691	she	126	" stricken of God and afflicted , "
105879	105882	105884	105884	Margaret	136	" Listen ! "
105900	106015	105887	105887	she	136	" What will mother say ? The bees are turning homeward for th ' last time , and we 've a terrible long bit to go yet . See ! here 's a linnet 's nest in this gorse - bush . Th ' hen - bird is on it . Look at her bright eyes , she wo n't stir ! Ay ! we mun hurry home . Wo n't mother be pleased with the bonny lot of heather we 've got ! Make haste , Sally , may be we shall have cockles for supper . I saw th ' cockle - man 's donkey turn up our way fra ' Arnside . "
106129	106258	106259	106259	She	2895	" Oh , Sally ! I wish we 'd told her . She thinks we were in church all morning , and we 've gone on deceiving her . If we 'd told her at first how it was — how sweet th ' hawthorn smelt through the open church - door , and how we were on th ' last bench in the aisle , and how it were the first butterfly we 'd seen this spring , and how it flew into th ' very church itself ; oh ! mother is so gentle , I wish we 'd told her . I 'll go to her next time she comes in sight , and say , ' Mother , we were naughty last Sabbath . ' "
106338	106344	106345	106345	Mary	124	" Thank you , mother . "
106353	106364	106345	106345	Mary	124	" Do n't you think she 's happy , Margaret ? "
106365	106455	106345	106345	Mary	124	" Ay ! that I do , bless her . She feels no pain , and knows nought of her present state . Oh ! that I could see , Mary ! I try and be patient with her afore me , but I 'd give aught I have to see her , and see what she wants . I am so useless ! I mean to stay here as long as Jane Wilson is alone ; and I would fain be here all to - night , but — "
106456	106461	106463	106463	Mary	124	" I 'll come , "
106467	106485	106463	106463	Mary	124	" Mrs. Davenport said she 'd come again , but she 's hard - worked all day — "
106486	106491	106493	106493	Mary	124	" I 'll come , "
106495	106498	106500	106500	Margaret	136	" Do ! "
106502	106588	106500	106500	Margaret	136	" and I 'll be here till you come . May be , Jem and you could take th ' night between you , and Jane Wilson might get a bit of sound sleep in his bed ; for she were up and down the better part of last night , and just when she were in a sound sleep this morning , between two and three , Jem came home , and th ' sound o ' his voice roused her in a minute . "
106589	106601	106603	106603	Mary	124	" Where had he been till that time o ' night ? "
106605	106661	106663	106663	Margaret	136	" Nay ! it were none of my business ; and , indeed , I never saw him till he came in here to see Alice . He were in again this morning , and seemed sadly downcast . But you 'll , may be , manage to comfort him to - night , Mary , "
106929	106935	106937	106937	she	139	" No ! What news ? "
106953	106967	106949	106949	Sally	139	" Have you not heard that young Mr. Carson was murdered last night ? "
107153	107167	107169	107169	she	133	" Have you heard any more of this horrid affair , Miss Barton ? "
107211	107225	107282	107285	One of the girls	2908	" No , ma'am , I never heard of it till this minute . "
107226	107281	107282	107285	One of the girls	2908	" Dear ! that 's strange , for every one is up about it . I hope the murderer will be found out , that I do . Such a handsome young man to be killed as he was . I hope the wretch that did it may be hanged as high as Haman . "
107296	107299	107301	107302	Miss Simmonds	133	" Ay , "
107304	107347	107301	107302	Miss Simmonds	133	" and the milk - man told me they will catch the wretch , and have him tried and hung in less than a week . Serve him right , whoever he is . Such a handsome young man as he was . "
107368	107442	107364	107364	she	133	" Miss Barton ! as I live , dropping tears on that new silk gown of Mrs. Hawkes ' ! Do n't you know they will stain , and make it shabby for ever ? Crying like a baby , because a handsome young man meets with an untimely end . For shame of yourself , miss . Mind your character and your work if you please . Or , if you must cry "
107460	107478	107364	107364	she	133	" take this print to cry over . That wo n't be marked like this beautiful silk , "
107680	107685	107690	107690	Sally	139	" Poor young gentleman , "
107700	107705	107707	107707	another	1374	" What a shame ! "
107714	107723	107725	107726	a third	2918	" That 's what I call regular jilting , "
107728	107740	107725	107726	a third	2918	" And he lying cold and bloody in his coffin now ! "
107902	107917	107877	107878	her mother	4715	" Where the wicked cease from troubling , and the weary are at rest . "
107918	107929	107877	107878	her mother	4715	" The tears shall be wiped away from all eyes , "
108217	108225	108231	108231	he	2935	" Wilful murder against some person unknown . "
108525	108530	108494	108528	a man speaking in the house - place below , who , wearied of knocking at the door , without obtaining any answer , had entered and was calling lustily for " Missis ! missis	6513	" Missis ! missis ! "
108589	108604	108581	108581	He	2954	" May I make bold to ask if this gun belongs to your son ? "
108652	108755	108770	108770	she	127	" It looks like his ; ay , it 's his , sure enough . I could speak to it anywhere by these marks . You see it were his grandfather 's , as were gamekeeper to some one up in th ' north ; and they do n't make guns so smart now - a - days . But , how comed you by it ? He sets great store on it . Is he bound for th ' shooting gallery ? He is not , for sure , now his aunt is so ill , and me left all alone ; "
109167	109169	109185	109185	he	268	" softness "
109575	109580	109581	109582	some one	1636	" Missis ! missis ! "
109605	109611	109613	109613	she	666	" What don ye want ? "
109617	109622	109624	109625	the man	588	" Only nothing but — "
109649	109666	109675	109675	he	588	" Well ! speak out , ca n't ye , and ha ' done with it ? "
109667	109673	109675	109675	he	588	" Jem 's in trouble , "
109691	109694	109696	109697	the mother	4974	" Trouble ! "
109708	109752	109696	109697	the mother	4974	" Trouble ! God help me , trouble will never end , I think . What d'ye mean by trouble ? Speak out , man , ca n't ye ? Is he ill ? My boy ! tell me , is he ill ? "
109760	109800	109696	109697	the mother	4974	" Na , na , that 's not it . He 's well enough . All he bade me say was , ' Tell mother I 'm in trouble , and ca n't come home to - night . ' "
109801	109839	109918	109918	she	3003	" Not come home to - night ! And what am I to do with Alice ? I ca n't go on , wearing my life out wi ' watching . He might come and help me . "
109840	109848	109850	109851	the man	588	" I tell you he ca n't , "
109853	109898	109850	109851	the man	588	" Ca n't ; and he is well , you say ? Stuff ! It 's just that he 's getten like other young men , and wants to go a - larking . But I 'll give it him when he comes back . "
109937	109971	109934	109934	she	3003	" Yo shall not go , till yo've told me what he 's after . I can see plain enough you know , and I 'll know too , before I 've done . "
109972	109981	109934	109934	she	3003	" You 'll know soon enough , missis ! "
109982	110022	109934	109934	she	3003	" I 'll know now , I tell ye . What 's up that he ca n't come home and help me nurse ? Me , as never got a wink o ' sleep last night wi ' watching . "
110023	110033	110035	110038	the poor badgered man	3004	" Well , if you will have it out , "
110040	110049	110035	110038	the poor badgered man	3004	" the police have got hold on him . "
110050	110055	110057	110059	the enraged mother	3005	" On my Jem ! "
110061	110100	110057	110059	the enraged mother	3005	" You 're a downright liar , and that 's what you are . My Jem , as never did harm to any one in his life . You 're a liar , that 's what you are . "
110101	110109	110111	110112	the man	588	" He 's done harm enough now , "
110119	110136	110111	110112	the man	588	" for there 's good evidence he murdered young Carson , as was shot last night . "
110201	110240	110185	110185	she	3005	" Oh , master , say you 're only joking . I ax your pardon if I have vexed ye , but please say you 're only joking . You do n't know what Jem is to me . "
110250	110312	110241	110241	She	3005	" I wish I were only joking , missis ; but it 's true as I say . They 've taken him up on charge o ' murder . It were his gun as were found near th ' place ; and one o ' the police heard him quarrelling with Mr. Carson a few days back , about a girl . "
110313	110318	110321	110322	the mother	4974	" About a girl ! "
110337	110345	110346	110346	she	3005	" My Jem was as steady as — "
110359	110385	110346	110346	she	3005	" as steady as Lucifer , and he were an angel , you know . My Jem was not one to quarrel about a girl . "
110386	110423	110241	110241	She	3005	" Ay , but it was that , though . They 'd got her name quite pat . The man had heard all they said . Mary Barton was her name , whoever she may be . "
110424	110463	110321	110322	the mother	4974	" Mary Barton ! the dirty hussey ! to bring my Jem into trouble of this kind . I 'll give it her well when I see her : that I will . Oh ! my poor Jem ! "
110470	110484	110346	110346	she	3005	" And what about the gun ? What did ye say about that ? "
110485	110500	110241	110241	She	3005	" His gun were found on th ' spot where the murder were done . "
110501	110531	110532	110533	The man	588	" That 's a lie for one , then . A man has got the gun now , safe and sound ; I saw it not an hour ago . "
110538	110559	110532	110533	The man	588	" Yes , he has indeed . A friend o ' Jem 's , as he 'd lent it to . "
110560	110567	110569	110570	the man	588	" Did you know the chap ? "
110592	110612	110532	110533	The man	588	" No ! I ca n't say as I did . But he were put on as a workman . "
110613	110626	110532	110533	The man	588	" It 's may be only one of them policemen , disguised . "
110627	110669	110532	110533	The man	588	" Nay ; they 'd never go for to do that , and trick me into telling on my own son . It would be like seething a kid in its mother 's milk ; and that th ' Bible forbids . "
110670	110676	110678	110679	the man	588	" I do n't know , "
111174	111190	111164	111165	Mrs. Wilson	114	" Let me do that for you . I 'm sure you mun be tired . "
111217	111322	111212	111212	she	114	" And is it thee that dares set foot in this house , after what has come to pass ? Is it not enough to have robbed me of my boy with thy arts and thy profligacy , but thou must come here to crow over me — me — his mother ? Dost thou know where he is , thou bad hussy , with thy great blue eyes and yellow hair , to lead men on to ruin ? Out upon thee , with thy angel 's face , thou whited sepulchre ! Dost thou know where Jem is , all through thee ? "
111323	111326	111330	111330	Mary	124	" No ! "
111352	111362	111367	111368	the mother	4974	" He 's lying in th ' New Bailey , "
111387	111403	111367	111368	the mother	4974	" There he lies , waiting to take his trial for murdering young Mr. Carson . "
111429	111440	111442	111444	the merciless woman	3031	" Did you know Mr. Carson as now lies dead ? "
111446	111506	111507	111507	She	3031	" Folk say you did , and knew him but too well . And that for the sake of such as you , my precious child shot yon chap . But he did not . I know he did not . They may hang him , but his mother will speak to his innocence with her last dying breath . "
111556	111580	111539	111541	some third person	5404	" Please , say it again . I do n't quite understand you . What has Jem done ? Please to tell me . "
111581	111667	111671	111672	the mother	4974	" I never said he had done it . I said , and I 'll swear that he never did do it . I do n't care who heard 'em quarrel , or if it is his gun as were found near the body . It 's not my own Jem as would go for to kill any man , choose how a girl had jilted him . My own good Jem , as was a blessing sent upon the house where he was born . "
111691	111696	111684	111684	she	4974	" first - born ; "
111751	111823	111741	111741	she	4974	" I told him , and told him to leave off thinking on thee ; but he would n't be led by me . Thee ! wench ! thou were not good enough to wipe the dust off his feet . A vile , flirting quean as thou art . It 's well thy mother does not know ( poor body ) what a good - for - nothing thou art . "
111824	111830	111832	111832	Mary	124	" Mother ! oh mother ! "
111842	111858	111860	111860	she	124	" But I was not good enough for him ! I know I was not , "
111891	111955	111880	111880	he	3038	" Mary ! you 'll may be hear of me as a drunkard , and may be as a thief , and may be as a murderer . Remember ! when all are speaking ill of me , yo will have no right to blame me , for it 's your cruelty that will have made me what I feel I shall become . "
112071	112122	112064	112064	she	124	" Thou seest what comes of light conduct , Mary ! It 's thy doing that suspicion has lighted on him , who is as innocent as the babe unborn . Thou'lt have much to answer for if he 's hung . Thou'lt have my death too at thy door ! "
112206	112212	112214	112214	she	124	" My heart is breaking , "
112218	112224	112214	112214	she	124	" My heart is breaking . "
112225	112228	112230	112231	Mrs. Wilson	114	" Nonsense ! "
112233	112270	112230	112231	Mrs. Wilson	114	" Do n't talk in that silly way . My heart has a better right to break than yours , and yet I hold up , you see . But , oh dear ! oh dear ! "
112294	112340	112341	112341	She	124	" What am I saying ? How could I hold up if thou wert gone , Jem ? Though I 'm as sure as I stand here of thy innocence , if they hang thee , my lad , I will lie down and die ! "
112366	112394	112363	112363	herself	124	" Oh , let me stay with you , at any rate , till we know the end . Dearest Mrs. Wilson , may n't I stay ? "
112418	112425	112406	112406	Mary	124	" Let me stay with you . "
112466	112558	112461	112462	Mrs. Wilson	114	" I 've may be been a bit hard on you , Mary , I 'll own that . But I can not abide you yet with me . I can not but remember it 's your giddiness as has wrought this woe . I 'll stay wi ' Alice , and perhaps Mrs. Davenport may come help a bit . I can not put up with you about me . Good - night . To - morrow I may look on you different , may be . Good - night . "
112824	112830	112813	112813	he	3054	" Hungry ! so hungry . "
112863	112874	112858	112858	Mary	124	" Oh , lad , hunger is nothing — nothing ! "
112956	112960	112942	112942	he	3055	" Mamma mia ! "
114109	114118	114098	114098	she	4720	" Mary ! Mary ! open the door ! "
114243	114256	114257	114257	She	124	" Oh ! mother ! mother ! You are come at last ! "
115499	115503	115493	115494	no one	1057	" ry Barton , "
116811	116822	116823	116823	she	232	" You do n't remember me I see , Mary ! "
116826	116895	116823	116823	she	232	" It 's a long while since I left you all , to be sure ; and I , many a time , thought of coming to see you , and — and your father . But I live so far off , and am always so busy , I can not do just what I wish . You recollect aunt Esther , do n't you , Mary ? "
116896	116902	116904	116904	Mary	124	" Are you aunt Hetty ? "
116929	116949	116972	116972	she	124	" Yes ! I am aunt Hetty . Oh ! it 's so long since I heard that name , "
116975	117021	116972	116972	she	124	" And to - day I heard a friend of yours , and of mine too , long ago , was in trouble , and I guessed you would be in sorrow , so I thought I would just step this far and see you . "
117111	117135	117137	117137	she	124	" Thank you . I dare say you mean very kind . Have you had a long walk ? I 'm so sorry , "
117154	117178	117137	117137	she	124	" but I 've nothing to eat in the house , and I 'm sure you must be hungry , after your walk . "
117311	117367	117308	117308	she	232	" Oh ! Mary , my dear ! do n't talk about eating . We 've the best of every thing , and plenty of it , for my husband is in good work . I 'd such a supper before I came out . I could n't touch a morsel if you had it . "
117633	117651	117630	117630	she	232	" It 's a bad business , I 'm afraid , this of Mr. Carson 's murder . "
117657	117668	117630	117630	she	232	" I hear Jem Wilson is taken up for it . "
117708	117726	117728	117728	Esther	232	" I was taking a walk near Turner Street , and I went to see the spot , "
117730	117749	117728	117728	Esther	232	" and , as luck would have it , I spied this bit of paper in the hedge , "
117760	117865	117728	117728	Esther	232	" It has been used as wadding for the gun , I reckon ; indeed , that 's clear enough , from the shape it 's crammed into . I was sorry for the murderer , whoever he might be ( I did n't then know of Jem 's being suspected ) , and I thought I would never leave a thing about as might help , if ever so little , to convict him ; the police are so ' cute about straws . So I carried it a little way , and then I opened it and saw your name , Mary . "
118023	118068	118071	118071	she	124	" There could be no mistake if they had found it . Look at your name , together with the very name of this court ! And in Jem 's hand - writing too , or I 'm much mistaken . Look , Mary ! "
118148	118159	118161	118161	Esther	232	" It is his hand - writing — isn't it ? "
118172	118183	118185	118185	Mary	124	" You will not tell . You never will tell , "
118200	118205	118207	118207	Esther	232	" Nay , Mary , "
118212	118239	118207	118207	Esther	232	" I am not so bad as that . Oh ! Mary , you can not think I would do that , whatever I may be . "
118274	118308	118266	118266	Mary	124	" No ! I know you would not tell , aunt . I do n't know what I say , I am so shocked . But say you will not tell . Do . "
118309	118322	118323	118323	Mary	124	" No , indeed I will not tell , come what may . "
118353	118366	118368	118368	Esther	232	" I thought you cared for the young man that 's murdered , "
118567	118578	118580	118580	Esther	232	" You are so like my little girl , Mary ! "
118918	118964	118911	118911	She	124	" Well , good - night , Mary . That bit of paper is safe enough with you , I see . But you made me promise I would not tell about it , and you must promise me to destroy it before you sleep . "
118965	118969	118971	118971	Mary	124	" I promise , "
118978	118984	118971	118971	Mary	124	" Then you are going ? "
118985	119009	118911	118911	She	124	" Yes . Not if you wish me to stay . Not if I could be of any comfort to you , Mary ; "
119016	119021	119023	119023	Mary	124	" Oh , no , "
119030	119057	119023	119023	Mary	124	" Your husband will be wondering where you are . Some day you must tell me all about yourself . I forget what your name is ? "
119058	119061	119063	119063	Esther	232	" Fergusson , "
119067	119071	119073	119073	Mary	124	" Mrs. Fergusson , "
119078	119087	119073	119073	Mary	124	" And where did you say you lived ? "
119088	119094	119096	119096	Esther	232	" I never did say , "
119101	119112	119096	119096	Esther	232	" In Angel 's Meadow , 145 , Nicholas Street . "
119113	119126	119073	119073	Mary	124	" 145 , Nicholas Street , Angel Meadow . I shall remember . "
119246	119258	119259	119259	She	124	" Not me . You must never kiss me . You ! "
119781	119786	119759	119759	she	124	" Oh ! Father ! "
120458	120466	120468	120468	you	3242	" for it can not be helped . "
120577	120594	120569	120571	any other mourner	3244	" Do not grieve , for it can not be helped . It is past remedy . "
121925	121940	121921	121921	Margaret	136	" I 'm come to speak to you about this — about Jem Wilson . "
121941	121952	121954	121954	Job	135	" It 's a bad business , I 'm afeared , "
121958	121985	121954	121954	Job	135	" Ay , it 's bad enough anyhow . But Jem 's innocent . Indeed he is ; I 'm as sure as sure can be . "
121986	122035	121921	121921	Margaret	136	" How can you know , wench ? Facts bear strong again him , poor fellow , though he 'd a deal to put him up , and aggravate him , they say . Ay , poor lad , he 's done for himself , I 'm afeared . "
122036	122039	122041	122041	Mary	124	" Job ! "
122051	122109	122041	122041	Mary	124	" you must not say he did it . He did n't ; I 'm sure and certain he did n't . Oh ! why do you shake your head ? Who is to believe me,—who is to think him innocent , if you , who know'd him so well , stick to it he 's guilty ? "
122110	122121	122123	122123	Job	135	" I 'm loth enough to do it , lass , "
122125	122173	122123	122123	Job	135	" but I think he 's been ill used , and — jilted ( that 's plain truth , Mary , hard as it may seem ) , and his blood has been up — many a man has done the like afore , from like causes . "
122174	122210	122041	122041	Mary	124	" Oh , God ! Then you wo n't help me , Job , to prove him innocent ? Oh ! Job , Job ; believe me , Jem never did harm to no one . "
122211	122228	122229	122229	Job	135	" Not afore;—and mind , wench ! I do n't over - blame him for this . "
122239	122321	122234	122234	Mary	124	" Well , Job , you 'll not refuse me this , I know . I wo n't mind what you think , if you 'll help me as if he was innocent . Now suppose I know — I knew he was innocent,—it 's only supposing , Job,—what must I do to prove it ? Tell me , Job ! Is n't it called an alibi , the getting folk to swear to where he really was at the time ? "
122322	122361	122229	122229	Job	135	" Best way , if you know'd him innocent , would be to find out the real murderer . Some one did it , that 's clear enough . If it was n't Jem , who was it ? "
122362	122368	122370	122370	Mary	124	" How can I tell ? "
122491	122548	122465	122465	she	124	" If Jem 's not done it , I do n't see as any on us can tell who did . We might find out something if we 'd time ; but they say he 's to be tried on Tuesday . It 's no use hiding it , Mary ; things looks strong against him . "
122549	122593	122636	122636	he	3281	" I know they do ! I know they do ! But , oh ! Job ! is n't an alibi a proving where he really was at th ' time of the murder ; and how must I set about an alibi ? "
122594	122603	122604	122604	He	3281	" An alibi is that , sure enough . "
122609	122634	122604	122604	He	3281	" You mun ask his mother his doings , and his whereabouts that night ; the knowledge of that will guide you a bit . "
123032	123111	123025	123025	She	0	" Oh ! Margaret , you can tell me ; you were there when he came back that night ; were you not ? No ! you were not ; but you were there not many hours after . Did not you hear where he 'd been ? He was away the night before , too , when Alice was first taken ; when you were there for your tea . Oh ! where was he , Margaret ? "
123112	123118	123119	123119	she	136	" I do n't know , "
123122	123156	123119	123119	she	136	" Stay ! I do remember something about his keeping Will company , in his walk to Liverpool . I ca n't justly say what it was , so much happened that night . "
123157	123166	123168	123168	Mary	124	" I 'll go to his mother 's , "
123370	123393	123394	123394	She	124	" So , Mary , you 're here ! Oh ! Mary , lass ! He 's to be tried on Tuesday . "
123414	123447	123470	123470	she	114	" Oh ! Mrs. Wilson , do n't take on so ! We 'll get him off , you 'll see . Do n't fret ; they ca n't prove him guilty ! "
123448	123456	123458	123459	Mrs. Wilson	114	" But I tell thee they will , "
123499	123506	123508	123508	she	124	" It may suit thee well , "
123510	123564	123508	123508	she	124	" to make light o ' the misery thou hast caused ; but I shall lay his death at thy door , as long as I live , and die I know he will ; and all for what he never did — no , he never did ; my own blessed boy ! "
123711	123766	124197	124197	She	127	" And now , dear Mrs. Wilson , can you remember where he said he was going on Thursday night ? He was out when Alice was taken ill ; and he did not come home till early in the morning , or , to speak true , in the night : did he ? "
123767	123895	124197	124197	She	127	" Ay ! he went out near upon five ; he went out with Will ; he said he were going to set [ 45 ] him a part of the way , for Will were hot upon walking to Liverpool , and would n't hearken to Jem 's offer of lending him five shilling for his fare . So the two lads set off together . I mind it all now ; but , thou seest , Alice 's illness , and this business of poor Jem 's , drove it out of my head ; they went off together , to walk to Liverpool ; that 's to say , Jem were to go a part o ' th ' way . But , who knows "
123905	123937	124197	124197	She	127	" if he really went ? He might be led off on the road . Oh ! Mary , wench ! they 'll hang him for what he 's never done . "
123938	123981	124197	124197	She	127	" No , they won't — they sha n't ! I see my way a bit now . We mun get Will to help ; there 'll be time . He can swear that Jem were with him . Where is Jem ? "
123982	124026	124197	124197	She	127	" Folk said he were taken to Kirkdale , i ' th ' prison - van , this morning ; without my seeing him , poor chap ! Oh ! wench ! but they 've hurried on the business at a cruel rate . "
124027	124049	124051	124051	Mary	124	" Ay ! they 've not let grass grow under their feet , in hunting out the man that did it , "
124057	124092	124051	124051	Mary	124	" But keep up your heart . They got on the wrong scent when they took to suspecting Jem . Do n't be afeard . You 'll see it will end right for Jem . "
124093	124105	124107	124108	Jane Wilson	127	" I should mind it less if I could do aught , "
124110	124196	124197	124197	She	127	" but I 'm such a poor weak old body , and my head 's so gone , and I 'm so dazed - like , what with Alice and all , that I think and think , and can do nought to help my child . I might ha ' gone and seen him last night , they tell me now , and then I missed it . Oh ! Mary , I missed it ; and I may never see the lad again . "
124266	124310	124246	124246	Jane	127	" She keeps on much the same , thank you . She 's happy , for she knows nought of what 's going on ; but th ' doctor says she grows weaker and weaker . Thou'lt may be like to see her ? "
125189	125192	125178	125178	her	127	" dazed , "
125688	125702	125708	125709	Many people	3334	" Here 's somewhat for you , Mary ! A policeman left it . "
125789	125794	125796	125796	she	124	" What is it ? "
125813	125866	125796	125796	she	124	" Nay ! how should I know ? Policeman said he 'd call again towards evening , and see if you 'd getten it . He were loth to leave it , though I telled him who I was , and all about my keeping th ' key , and taking messages . "
125867	125873	125875	125875	Mary	124	" What is it about ? "
125905	125955	125896	125896	she	124	" Well ! yo can read word of writing and I can not , so it 's queer I should have to tell you . But my master says it 's a summons for yo to bear witness again Jem Wilson , at th ' trial at Liverpool Assize . "
125956	125961	125963	125963	Mary	124	" God pity me ! "
125973	126020	125963	125963	Mary	124	" Nay , wench , never take on so . What yo can say will go little way either to help or to hinder , for folk say he 's certain to be hung ; and sure enough it was t'other one as was your sweetheart . "
126060	126063	126065	126066	the neighbour	576	" Well ! "
126085	126129	126130	126130	She	124	" thou'lt tell policeman thou'st getten his precious bit of paper . He seemed to think I should be keeping it for mysel ; he 's th ' first as has ever misdoubted me about giving messages , or notes . Good day . "
126195	126203	126204	126204	he	135	" It 's a sub - pœna , "
126266	126276	126278	126278	Mary	124	" A sub - pœna — what is that ? "
126307	126422	126284	126284	Job	135	" A sub - pœna is neither more nor less than this , my dear . It 's a summonsing you to attend , and answer such questions as may be asked of you regarding the trial of James Wilson , for the murder of Henry Carson ; that 's the long and short of it , only more elegantly put , for the benefit of them who knows how to value the gift of language . I 've been a witness before - time myself ; there 's nothing much to be afeared on ; if they are impudent , why , just you be impudent , and give 'em tit for tat . "
126423	126431	126433	126433	Mary	124	" Nothing much to be afeared on ! "
126442	126569	126433	126433	Mary	124	" Ay , poor wench , I see how it is . It 'll go hard with thee a bit , I dare say ; but keep up thy heart . Yo can not have much to tell 'em , that can go either one way or th ' other . Nay ! may be thou may do him a bit o ' good , for when they set eyes on thee , they 'll see fast enough how he came to be so led away by jealousy ; for thou'rt a pretty creature , Mary , and one look at thy face will let 'em into th ' secret of a young man 's madness , and make 'em more ready to pass it over . "
126570	126614	126284	126284	Job	135	" Oh ! Job , and wo n't you ever believe me when I tell you he 's innocent ? Indeed , and indeed I can prove it ; he was with Will all that night ; he was , indeed , Job ! "
126615	126626	126628	126628	Job	135	" My wench ! whose word hast thou for that ? "
126632	126656	126628	126628	Job	135	" Why ! his mother told me , and I 'll get Will to bear witness to it . But , oh ! Job "
126663	126702	126628	126628	Job	135	" it is hard if you wo n't believe me . How shall I clear him to strangers , when those who know him , and ought to love him , are so set against his being innocent ? "
126703	126715	126717	126717	Job	135	" God knows , I 'm not against his being innocent , "
126721	126797	126798	126798	he	135	" I 'd give half my remaining days on earth,—I'd give them all , Mary ( and but for the love I bear to my poor blind girl , they 'd be no great gift ) , if I could save him . You 've thought me hard , Mary , but I 'm not hard at bottom , and I 'll help you if I can ; that I will , right or wrong , "
126817	126828	126830	126830	Mary	124	" Oh , Job ! if you will help me , "

126876	126944	127094	127094	Job	135	" Thou canst do nought better than tell the truth . Truth 's best at all times , they say ; and for sure it is when folk have to do with lawyers ; for they 're ' cute and cunning enough to get it out sooner or later , and it makes folk look like Tom Noddies , when truth follows falsehood , against their will . "
126945	127040	126830	126830	Mary	124	" But I do n't know the truth ; I mean — I ca n't say rightly what I mean ; but I 'm sure , if I were pent up , and stared at by hundreds of folk , and asked ever so simple a question , I should be for answering it wrong ; if they asked me if I had seen you on a Saturday , or a Tuesday , or any day , I should have clean forgotten all about it , and say the very thing I should not . "
127041	127093	127094	127094	Job	135	" Well , well , do n't go for to get such notions into your head ; they 're what they call ' narvous , ' and talking on 'em does no good . Here 's Margaret ! bless the wench ! Look , Mary , how well she guides hersel . "
127233	127238	127240	127240	Job	135	" Here 's Mary , "
127254	127293	127240	127240	Job	135	" come to take a bit of dinner with us , for I 'll warrant she 's never thought of cooking any for herself to - day ; and she looks as wan and pale as a ghost . "
127351	127364	127366	127366	Job	135	" Nay , Mary , thou know'st thou'st getten nought at home , "
127441	127470	127429	127429	Job	135	" Yon poor lad at Kirkdale will want a lawyer to see they do n't put on him , but do him justice . Hast thought of that ? "
127489	127588	127483	127483	Margaret	136	" I 've but just been there , and poor Jane is like one dateless ; so many griefs come on her at once . One time she seems to make sure he 'll be hung ; and if I took her in that way , she flew out ( poor body ! ) and said , that in spite of what folk said , there were them as could , and would prove him guiltless . So I never knew where to have her . The only thing she was constant in , was declaring him innocent . "
127589	127594	127596	127596	Job	135	" Mother - like ! "
127598	127649	127596	127596	Job	135	" She meant Will , when she spoke of them that could prove him innocent . He was with Will on Thursday night , walking a part of the way with him to Liverpool ; now the thing is to lay hold on Will and get him to prove this . "
127663	127675	127677	127677	Job	135	" Do n't build too much on it , my dear , "
127679	127686	127688	127688	Mary	124	" I do build on it , "
127690	127747	127688	127688	Mary	124	" because I know it 's the truth , and I mean to try and prove it , come what may . Nothing you can say will daunt me , Job , so do n't you go and try . You may help , but you can not hinder me doing what I 'm resolved on . "
127853	127862	127863	127863	she	124	" Now I 'm clear about this much , "
127866	128082	127863	127863	she	124	" he was with Will when the — shot was fired ( she could not bring herself to say , when the murder was committed , when she remembered who it was that , she had every reason to believe , was the taker - away of life ) . Will can prove this . I must find Will . He was n't to sail till Tuesday . There 's time enough . He was to come back from his uncle 's , in the Isle of Man , on Monday . I must meet him in Liverpool , on that day , and tell him what has happened , and how poor Jem is in trouble , and that he must prove an alibi , come Tuesday . All this I can and will do , though perhaps I do n't clearly know how , just at present . But surely God will help me . When I know I 'm doing right , I will have no fear , but put my trust in Him ; for I 'm acting for the innocent and good , and not for my own self , who have done so wrong . I have no fear when I think of Jem , who is so good . "
128141	128220	128221	128221	She	3356	" Now I know the name of Will 's vessel — the John Cropper ; and I know that she is bound to America . That is something to know . But I forget , if I ever heard , where he lodges in Liverpool . He spoke of his landlady , as a good , trustworthy woman ; but if he named her name , it has slipped my memory . Can you help me , Margaret ? "
128292	128336	128269	128269	Margaret	136	" He lodges at a Mrs. Jones 's , Milk - House Yard , out of Nicholas Street . He has lodged there ever since he began to go to sea ; she is a very decent kind of woman , I believe . "
128337	128349	128351	128351	Job	135	" Well , Mary ! I 'll give you my prayers , "
128353	128528	128351	128351	Job	135	" It 's not often I pray regular , though I often speak a word to God , when I 'm either very happy or very sorry ; I 've catched myself thanking Him at odd hours when I 've found a rare insect , or had a fine day for an out ; but I can not help it , no more than I can talking to a friend . But this time I 'll pray regular for Jem , and for you . And so will Margaret , I 'll be bound . Still , wench ! what think yo of a lawyer ? I know one , Mr. Cheshire , who 's rather given to th ' insect line — and a good kind o ' chap . He and I have swopped specimens many 's the time , when either of us had a duplicate . He 'll do me a kind turn , I 'm sure . I 'll just take my hat , and pay him a visit . "
128577	128582	128584	128584	she	136	" Oh , Margaret ! "
128586	128617	128584	128584	she	136	" I see — I feel how wrong you think I have acted ; you can not think me worse than I think myself , now my eyes are opened . "
128627	128630	128631	128631	Margaret	136	" Nay , "
128634	128641	128631	128631	Margaret	136	" I have no right to — "
128642	128739	128740	128740	She	136	" Yes , Margaret , you have a right to judge ; you can not help it ; only in your judgment remember mercy , as the Bible says . You , who have been always good , can not tell how easy it is at first to go a little wrong , and then how hard it is to go back . Oh ! I little thought when I was first pleased with Mr. Carson 's speeches , how it would all end ; perhaps in the death of him I love better than life . "
128790	128882	128787	128787	she	136	" I must not cry ; I must not give way ; there will be time enough for that hereafter , if — I only wanted you to speak kindly to me , Margaret , for I am very , very wretched ; more wretched than any one can ever know ; more wretched , I sometimes fancy , than I have deserved,—but that 's wrong , is n't it , Margaret ? Oh ! I have done wrong , and I am punished ; you can not tell how much . "
128929	128966	128967	128967	Margaret	136	" Oh ! Margaret , do you think he can be saved ; do you think they can find him guilty if Will comes forward as a witness ? Wo n't that be a good alibi ? "
128975	128982	128984	128984	Mary	124	" Oh , speak ! Margaret , "
128990	129000	129002	129002	Margaret	136	" I know nought about law , or alibis , "
129006	129078	129002	129002	Margaret	136	" but , Mary , as grandfather says , are n't you building too much on what Jane Wilson has told you about his going with Will ? Poor soul , she 's gone dateless , I think , with care , and watching , and over - much trouble ; and who can wonder ? Or Jem may have told her he was going , by way of a blind . "
129079	129086	129088	129088	Mary	124	" You do n't know Jem , "
129099	129107	129088	129088	Mary	124	" or you would not say so . "
129108	129191	129192	129192	Mary	124	" I hope I may be wrong ; but think , Mary , how much there is against him . The shot was fired with his gun ; he it was as threatened Mr. Carson not many days before ; he was absent from home at that very time , as we know , and , as I 'm much afeared , some one will be called on to prove ; and there 's no one else to share suspicion with him . "
129198	129209	129210	129210	Mary	124	" But , Margaret , he did not do it , "
129218	129298	129214	129214	Margaret	136	" I can do no good , I see , by saying so , for none on you believe me , and I wo n't say so again till I can prove it . Monday morning I 'll go to Liverpool . I shall be at hand for the trial . Oh dear ! dear ! And I will find Will ; and then , Margaret , I think you 'll be sorry for being so stubborn about Jem . "
129299	129410	129192	129192	Mary	124	" Do n't fly off , dear Mary ; I 'd give a deal to be wrong . And now I 'm going to be plain spoken . You 'll want money . Them lawyers is no better than a spunge for sucking up money ; let alone your hunting out Will , and your keep in Liverpool , and what not . You must take some of the mint I 've got laid by in the old tea - pot . You have no right to refuse , for I offer it to Jem , not to you ; it 's for his purposes you 're to use it . "
129411	129477	129214	129214	Margaret	136	" I know — I see . Thank you , Margaret ; you 're a kind one , at any rate . I take it for Jem ; and I 'll do my very best with it for him . Not all , though ; do n't think I 'll take all . They 'll pay me for my keep . I 'll take this , "
129496	129513	129485	129485	Margaret	136	" Your grandfather will pay the lawyer . I 'll have nought to do with him , "
129547	129559	129561	129561	Margaret	136	" Bless you ! do n't make such ado about it , "
129569	129724	129561	129561	Margaret	136	" I sometimes think there 's two sides to the commandment ; and that we may say , ' Let others do unto you , as you would do unto them , ' for pride often prevents our giving others a great deal of pleasure , in not letting them be kind , when their hearts are longing to help ; and when we ourselves should wish to do just the same , if we were in their place . Oh ! how often I 've been hurt , by being coldly told by persons not to trouble myself about their care , or sorrow , when I saw them in great grief , and wanted to be of comfort . Our Lord Jesus was not above letting folk minister to Him , for He knew how happy it makes one to do aught for another . It 's the happiest work on earth . "

129997	130002	130004	130004	he	135	" Well ! Mary , "
130008	130206	130004	130004	he	135	" I 've seen the lawyer , not Mr. Cheshire though ; trials for murder , it seems , are not his line o ' business . But he gived me a note to another ' torney ; a fine fellow enough , only too much of a talker ; I could hardly get a word in , he cut me so short . However , I 've just been going over the principal points again to him ; may be you saw us ? I wanted him just to come over and speak to you himsel , Mary , but he was pressed for time ; and he said your evidence would not be much either here or there . He 's going to the ' sizes first train on Monday morning , and will see Jem , and hear the ins and outs from him , and he 's gived me his address , Mary , and you and Will are to call on him ( Will ' special ) on Monday at two o'clock . Thou'rt taking it in , Mary ; thou'rt to call on him in Liverpool at two , Monday afternoon ? "
130378	130411	130369	130369	Job	135	" Monday ; at two o'clock , mind ; and here 's his card . ' Mr. Bridgenorth , 41 , Renshaw Street , Liverpool . ' He 'll be lodging there . "
130426	130448	130412	130412	Job	135	" You 're very kind , Job ; very . You and Margaret wo n't desert me , come what will . "
130449	130495	130369	130369	Job	135	" Pooh ! pooh ! wench ; do n't lose heart , just as I 'm beginning to get it . He seems to think a deal on Will 's evidence . You 're sure , girls , you 're under no mistake about Will ? "
130496	130501	130503	130503	Mary	124	" I 'm sure , "
130505	130538	130503	130503	Mary	124	" he went straight from here , purposing to go see his uncle at the Isle of Man , and be back Sunday night , ready for the ship sailing on Tuesday . "
130539	130544	130546	130546	Margaret	136	" So am I , "
130548	130576	130546	130546	Margaret	136	" And the ship 's name was the John Cropper , and he lodged where I told Mary before . Have you got it down , Mary ? "
130589	130599	130601	130601	she	124	" He was not over - willing to go , "
130607	130657	130601	130601	she	124	" for he knew little about his uncle , and said he did n't care if he never knowed more . But he said kinsfolk was kinsfolk , and promises was promises , so he 'd go for a day or so , and then it would be over . "
130974	131001	130958	130959	Mrs. Davenport	175	" Never heed her ; she 's worn out , and best let alone . I 'll tell you all about it , up - stairs . "
131039	131049	131034	131034	she	114	" What is this ? will you tell me ? "
131094	131099	131100	131100	she	124	" What is it ? "
131103	131109	131100	131100	she	124	" Will you tell me ? "
131134	131143	131145	131146	Mrs. Davenport	175	" I telled ye not to heed her , "
131152	131281	131145	131146	Mrs. Davenport	175	" She knows well enough what it is,—too well , belike . I was not in when they sarved it ; but Mrs. Heming ( her as lives next door ) was , and she spelled out the meaning , and made it all clear to Mrs. Wilson . It 's a summons to be a witness on Jem 's trial — Mrs. Heming thinks , to swear to the gun ; for , yo see , there 's nobbut [ 47 ] her as can testify to its being his , and she let on so easily to the policeman that it was his , that there 's no getting off her word now . Poor body ; she takes it very hard , I dare say ! "
131393	131403	131385	131385	she	114	" What is this ? Will you tell me ? "
131404	131476	131385	131385	she	114	" Yo'd better give it me at once , Mrs. Wilson , and let me put it out of your sight.—Speak to her , Mary , wench , and ask for a sight on it ; I 've tried , and better - tried to get it from her , and she takes no heed of words , and I 'm loth to pull it by force out of her hands .

131617	131628	131611	131612	the girl	4720	" and all this woe and sorrow,—it 's no wonder . "
131629	131634	131635	131636	Mrs. Davenport	175	" No , indeed ! "
131639	131676	131635	131636	Mrs. Davenport	175	" We must get her fairly to bed ; we must get her undressed , and all ; and trust to God , in His mercy , to send her to sleep , or else , — "
131881	131895	131872	131872	she	3392	" You have n't told me what it is . What is it ? "
132547	132550	132531	132532	some father	3420	" Daddy , "
132851	132857	132858	132859	the mother	4974	" Is it a dream ? "

132981	132987	132989	132989	she	124	" How happy she is ! "
133137	133216	133132	133132	she	124	" Oh wench ! I am his mother , and yet I do so little , I can do so little ! That 's what frets me ! I seem like a child as sees its mammy ill , and moans and cries its little heart out , yet does nought to help . I think my sense has left me all at once , and I ca n't even find strength to cry like the little child . "
133708	133720	133722	133722	he	3443	" Well , my girl ! and what brings you here ? "
133730	133740	133722	133722	he	3443	" Not on your own account , I hope . "
133741	133765	133766	133766	He	3443	" I wanted you to come and see Alice Wilson,—and then I thought you would may be take a look at Mrs. Wilson . "
133868	133875	133877	133877	Mary	124	" How do you think her ? "
133881	133886	133888	133888	he	3443	" Why — a , "
133935	133983	133932	133932	he	3443	" She is weak , certainly ; the natural result of such a shock as the arrest of her son would be,—for I understand this James Wilson , who murdered Mr. Carson , was her son . Sad thing to have such a reprobate in the family . "
133984	133994	133996	133996	Mary	124	" You say ' who murdered , ' sir ! "
134000	134025	133996	133996	Mary	124	" He is only taken up on suspicion , and many have no doubt of his innocence — those who know him , sir . "
134026	134153	133932	133932	he	3443	" Ah , well , well ! doctors have seldom time to read newspapers , and I dare say I 'm not very correct in my story . I dare say he 's innocent ; I 'm sure I had no right to say otherwise,—only words slip out.—No ! indeed , young woman , I see no cause for apprehension about this poor creature in the next room;—weak — certainly ; but a day or two 's good nursing will set her up , and I 'm sure you 're a good nurse , my dear , from your pretty , kind - hearted face,—I'll send a couple of pills and a draught , but do n't alarm yourself,—there 's no occasion , I assure you . "
134154	134167	134169	134169	Mary	124	" But you do n't think her fit to go to Liverpool ? "
134186	134192	134194	134194	he	3455	" To Liverpool — yes , "
134196	134226	134194	134194	he	3455	" A short journey like that could not fatigue , and might distract her thoughts . Let her go by all means,—it would be the very thing for her . "
134227	134232	134235	134235	Mary	124	" Oh , sir ! "
134240	134255	134235	134235	Mary	124	" I did so hope you would say she was too ill to go . "
134256	134259	134261	134261	he	3455	" Whew — "
134300	134390	134278	134278	he	3455	wish,—"Why did you not tell me so sooner ? It might certainly do her harm in her weak state ; there is always some risk attending journeys — draughts , and what not . To her , they might prove very injurious,—very . I disapprove of journeys , or excitement , in all cases where the patient is in the low , fluttered state in which Mrs. Wilson is . If you take my advice , you will certainly put a stop to all thoughts of going to Liverpool . "
134415	134452	134454	134454	she	3458	" Oh , sir , thank you ! And will you give me a certificate of her being unable to go , if the lawyer says we must have one ? The lawyer , you know , "
134461	134474	134454	134454	she	3458	" who is to defend Jem,—it was as a witness against him — "
134475	134480	134482	134482	he	3455	" My dear girl ! "
134487	134583	134482	134482	he	3455	" why did you not state the case fully at first ? one minute would have done it,—and my dinner waiting all this time . To be sure she ca n't go,—it would be madness to think of it ; if her evidence could have done good , it would have been a different thing . Come to me for the certificate any time ; that is to say , if the lawyer advises you . I second the lawyer ; take counsel with both the learned professions — ha , ha , ha , — "
134689	134709	134685	134685	his	3455	" It may have an awkward look , if we keep her back . Lawyers is up to tricks . "
134710	134717	134719	134719	Mary	124	" But it 's no trick , "
134721	134746	134719	134719	Mary	124	" She is so poorly , she was last night , at least ; and to - day she 's so faded and weak . "
134747	134817	134818	134818	Mary	124	" Poor soul ! I dare say . I only mean for Jem 's sake ; as so much is known , it wo n't do now to hang back . But I 'll ask Mr. Bridgenorth . I 'll e'en take your doctor 's advice . Yo tarry at home , and I 'll come to yo in an hour 's time . Go thy ways , wench . "

"
135142	135147	135148	135148	she	139	" Why , Mary ! "
135151	135251	135148	135148	she	139	" Where have you hidden yourself ? You never showed your face all yesterday at Miss Simmonds ' . You do n't fancy we think any the worse of you for what 's come and gone . Some on us , indeed , were a bit sorry for the poor young man , as lies stiff and cold for your sake , Mary ; but we shall ne'er cast it up against you . Miss Simmonds , too , will be mighty put out if you do n't come , for there 's a deal of mourning , agait . "
135252	135257	135258	135258	Mary	124	" I ca n't , "
135266	135276	135258	135258	Mary	124	" I do n't mean ever to come again . "

135290	135441	135284	135284	Sally	139	" To be sure you 'll have to be in Liverpool , Tuesday , and may be Wednesday ; but after that you 'll surely come , and tell us all about it . Miss Simmonds knows you 'll have to be off those two days . But between you and me , she 's a bit of a gossip , and will like hearing all how and about the trial , well enough to let you off very easy for your being absent a day or two . Besides , Betsy Morgan was saying yesterday , she should n't wonder but you 'd prove quite an attraction to customers . Many a one would come and have their gowns made by Miss Simmonds just to catch a glimpse at you , at after the trial 's over . Really , Mary , you 'll turn out quite a heroine . "
135536	135548	135523	135523	she	124	" How shall you like being cross - examined , Mary ? "
135549	135554	135556	135556	Mary	124	" Not at all , "
135565	135590	135556	135556	Mary	124	" La ! what impudent fellows those lawyers are ! And their clerks , too , not a bit better . I should n't wonder "
135605	135625	135556	135556	Mary	124	" if you picked up a new sweetheart in Liverpool . What gown are you going in , Mary ? "
135626	135638	135640	135640	Mary	124	" Oh , I do n't know and do n't care , "
135649	135708	135710	135710	she	124	" Well , then ! take my advice , and go in that blue merino . It 's old to be sure , and a bit worn at elbows , but folk wo n't notice that , and th ' colour suits you . Now mind , Mary . And I 'll lend you my black watered scarf , "
135754	135766	135710	135710	she	124	" I 'll bring it to - morrow before you start . "
135767	135773	135775	135775	Mary	124	" No , do n't ! "
135777	135788	135775	135775	Mary	124	" thank you , but I do n't want it . "
135789	135845	135847	135847	she	124	" Why , what can you wear ? I know all your clothes as well as I do my own , and what is there you can wear ? Not your old plaid shawl , I do hope ? You would not fancy this I have on , more nor the scarf , would you ? "
135866	135904	135847	135847	she	124	" Oh Sally ! do n't go on talking a - that - ns ; how can I think on dress at such a time ? When it 's a matter of life and death to Jem ? "
135905	135975	135847	135847	she	124	" Bless the girl ! It 's Jem , is it ? Well now , I thought there was some sweetheart in the back - ground , when you flew off so with Mr. Carson . Then what in the name of goodness made him shoot Mr. Harry ? After you had given up going with him , I mean ? Was he afraid you 'd be on again ? "
135976	135986	135988	135988	Mary	124	" How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry ? "
136012	136045	136046	136046	she	124	" But it 's no matter what you think as did not know him . What grieves me is , that people should go on thinking him guilty as did know him , "
136059	136069	136071	136071	Sally	139	" And do n't you think he did it ? "
136260	136320	136252	136252	Sally	139	" There 's that old fogey coming in here , as I 'm alive ! Did your father set him to look after you while he was away ? or what brings the old chap here ? However , I 'm off ; I never could abide either him or his prim grand - daughter . Goodbye , Mary . "
136330	136361	136252	136252	Sally	139	" If you think better of my offer about the scarf , Mary , just step in to - morrow before nine , and you 're quite welcome to it . "
136386	136395	136397	136397	Job	135	" Yon 's a bold , bad girl , "
136401	136409	136411	136411	Mary	124	" She 's very good - natured , "
136442	136565	136411	136411	Mary	124	" Ay , ay ! good - natured , generous , jolly , full of fun ; there are a number of other names for the good qualities the devil leaves his childer , as baits to catch gudgeons with . D'ye think folk could be led astray by one who was every way bad ? Howe'er , that 's not what I came to talk about . I 've seen Mr. Bridgenorth , and he is in a manner of the same mind as me ; he thinks it would have an awkward look , and might tell against the poor lad on his trial ; still if she 's ill she 's ill , and it ca n't be helped . "
136566	136580	136582	136582	Mary	124	" I do n't know if she 's so bad as all that , "
136602	136626	136582	136582	Mary	124	" Will you come and see her , Job ? The doctor seemed to say as I liked , not as he thought . "
136627	136646	136648	136648	Job	135	" That 's because he had no great thought on the subject , either one way or t'other , "
136663	136698	136648	136648	Job	135	" But I 'll go and welcome . I han not seen th ' oud ladies since their sorrows , and it 's but manners to go and ax after them . Come along . "
136941	136944	136945	136945	I	0	" unseen , "
136951	136954	136945	136945	I	0	" fancied , "
137088	137168	137076	137077	Mrs. Wilson	114	" Yo're right , Mary ! She 's no ways fit to go to Liverpool , poor soul . Now I 've seen her , I only wonder the doctor could ha ' been unsettled in his mind at th ' first . Choose how it goes wi ' poor Jem , she can not go . One way or another it will soon be over , and best to leave her in the state she is till then . "
137169	137178	137180	137180	Mary	124	" I was sure you would think so , "
137298	137683	137278	137278	she	124	decidedly—"I go to Liverpool . I hear you and your plans ; and I tell you I shall go to Liverpool . If my words are to kill my son , they have already gone forth out of my mouth , and nought can bring them back . But I will have faith . Alice ( up above ) has often telled me I wanted faith , and now I will have it . They cannot — they will not kill my child , my only child . I will not be afeared . Yet , oh ! I am so sick with terror . But if he is to die , think ye not that I will see him again ; ay ! see him at his trial ? When all are hating him , he shall have his poor mother near him , to give him all the comfort , eyes , and looks , and tears , and a heart that is dead to all but him , can give ; his poor old mother , who knows how free he is from sin — in the sight of man at least . They 'll let me go to him , maybe , the very minute it 's over ; and I know many Scripture texts ( though you would not think it ) , that may keep up his heart . I missed seeing him ere he went to yon prison , but nought shall keep me away again one minute when I can see his face ; for maybe the minutes are numbered , and the count but small . I know I can be a comfort to him , poor lad . You would not think it , now , but he 'd alway speak as kind and soft to me as if he were courting me , like . He loved me above a bit ; and am I to leave him now to dree all the cruel slander they 'll put upon him ? I can pray for him at each hard word they say against him , if I can do nought else ; and he 'll know what his mother is doing for him , poor lad , by the look on my face . "
137716	137808	137698	137698	She	3499	" Now , wench ! once for all ! I tell yo this . He could never guide me ; and he 'd sense enough not to try . What he could na do , do n't you try . I shall go to Liverpool to - morrow , and find my lad , and stay with him through thick and thin ; and if he dies , why , perhaps , God of His mercy will take me too . The grave is a sure cure for an aching heart . "
137854	137861	137834	137834	she	124	" I shall go to Liverpool . "
137918	137924	137926	137926	Job	135	" Best way will be , "
137928	138019	137926	137926	Job	135	" for me to hunt out Will , early to - morrow morning , and yo , Mary , come at after with Jane Wilson . I know a decent woman where yo two can have a bed , and where we may meet together when I 've found Will , afore going to Mr. Bridgenorth 's at two o'clock ; for , I can tell him , I 'll not trust none of his clerks for hunting up Will , if Jem 's life is to depend on it . "
138334	138340	138342	138342	Margaret	136	" Mary had better go , "
138352	138399	138342	138342	Margaret	136	" I know what she 's feeling , and it will be a comfort to her soon , may be , to think she did all she could herself . She would perhaps fancy it might have been different ; do , grandfather , let her . "
138457	138491	138493	138493	she	136	" Let me lock up house , grandfather , for a couple of days , and go and stay with Alice . It 's but little one like me can do , I know "
138498	138611	138493	138493	she	136	" but , by the blessing o ' God , I 'll do it and welcome ; and here comes one kindly use o ' money , I can hire them as will do for her what I can not . Mrs. Davenport is a willing body , and one who knows sorrow and sickness , and I can pay her for her time , and keep her there pretty near altogether . So let that be settled . And you take Mrs. Wilson , dear grandad , and let Mary go find Will , and you can all meet together at after , and I 'm sure I wish you luck . "
138952	138955	138956	138956	She	124	" Heimweh . "
139087	139093	139070	139073	Two lawyers ' clerks	3531	" the murder - case , "
139118	139134	139136	139136	one	406	" Juries are always very unwilling to convict on circumstantial evidence , it is true , "
139138	139148	139136	139136	one	406	" but here there can hardly be any doubt . "
139149	139160	139162	139163	the other	902	" If it had not been so clear a case , "
139165	139190	139162	139163	the other	902	" I should have said they were injudicious in hurrying on the trial so much . Still , more evidence might have been collected . "
139191	139196	139198	139205	the first speaker,—"the people in Gardener 's office	6827	" They tell me , "
139200	139266	139198	139205	the first speaker,—"the people in Gardener 's office	6827	speaker,—"the people in Gardener 's office I mean,—that it was really feared the old gentleman would have gone out of his mind , if the trial had been delayed . He was with Mr. Gardener as many as seven times on Saturday , and called him up at night to suggest that some letter should be written , or something done to secure the verdict . "
139267	139272	139274	139275	his companion	571	" Poor old man , "
139277	139313	139274	139275	his companion	571	" who can wonder?—an only son,—such a death,—the disagreeable circumstances attending it ; I had not time to read the Guardian on Saturday , but I understand it was some dispute about a factory girl . "
139314	139355	139198	139205	the first speaker,—"the people in Gardener 's office	6827	" Yes , some such person . Of course she 'll be examined , and Williams will do it in style . I shall slip out from our court to hear him if I can hit the nick of time . "
139356	139378	139198	139205	the first speaker,—"the people in Gardener 's office	6827	" And if you can get a place , you mean , for depend upon it the court will be crowded . "
139379	139416	139274	139275	his companion	571	" Ay , ay , the ladies ( sweet souls ) will come in shoals to hear a trial for murder , and see the murderer , and watch the judge put on his black cap . "
139417	139439	139198	139205	the first speaker,—"the people in Gardener 's office	6827	" And then go home and groan over the Spanish ladies who take delight in bull - fights—'such unfeminine creatures ! ' "
139706	139713	139714	139714	she	124	" Is this Mrs. Jones 's ? "
139717	139723	139714	139714	she	124	" Next door but one , "
139887	139897	139877	139877	Mary	124	" Pray what do you want , young woman ? "
139905	139916	139900	139901	Mrs. Jones	282	" I want — Oh ! is Will Wilson here ? "
139917	139924	139926	139927	Mrs. Jones	282	" No , he is not , "
139938	139950	139952	139952	Mary	124	" Is he not come back from the Isle of Man ? "
139956	139975	139952	139952	Mary	124	" He never went ; he stayed in Manchester too long ; as perhaps you know , already . "
140011	140022	139984	139984	Mary	124	" Tell me — tell me — where is he ? "
140078	140101	140066	140067	Mrs. Jones	282	" He 's gone this very morning , my poor girl . Step in , and I 'll tell you about it . "
140102	140105	140107	140107	Mary	124	" Gone ! "
140109	140139	140066	140067	Mrs. Jones	282	" How gone ? I must see him,—it 's a matter of life and death : he can save the innocent from being hanged,—he can not be gone,—how gone ? "
140140	140156	140066	140067	Mrs. Jones	282	" Sailed , my dear ! sailed in the John Cropper this very blessed morning . "
140157	140160	140066	140067	Mrs. Jones	282	" Sailed ! "
140184	140191	140193	140193	she	124	" Oh , father ! father ! "
140195	140224	140226	140226	she	124	" what have you done?—What must I do ? must the innocent die?—or he — whom I fear — I fear — oh ! what am I saying ? "
140241	140291	140226	140226	she	124	" I am so helpless , so weak,—but a poor girl after all . How can I tell what is right ? Father ! you have always been so kind to me,—and you to be — never mind — never mind , all will come right in the grave . "
140292	140300	140302	140303	Mrs. Jones	282	" Save us , and bless us ! "
140305	140319	140302	140303	Mrs. Jones	282	" if I do n't think she 's gone out of her wits ! "
140320	140327	140329	140329	Mary	124	" No , I 'm not ! "
140362	140402	140302	140303	Mrs. Jones	282	" I 'm not out of my senses ; there is so much to be done — so much — and no one but me to do it , you know,—though I ca n't rightly tell what it is , "
140413	140429	140302	140303	Mrs. Jones	282	" I must not go mad whatever comes — at least not yet . No ! "
140435	140460	140302	140303	Mrs. Jones	282	" something may yet be done , and I must do it . Sailed ! did you say ? The John Cropper ? Sailed ? "
140461	140481	140302	140303	Mrs. Jones	282	" Ay ! she went out of dock last night , to be ready for the morning 's tide . "
140482	140495	140497	140497	Mary	124	" I thought she was not to sail till to - morrow , "
140499	140520	140522	140523	Mrs. Jones	282	" So did Will ( he 's lodged here long , so we all call him ' Will ' ) , "
140525	140614	140522	140523	Mrs. Jones	282	" The mate had told him so , I believe , and he never knew different till he got to Liverpool on Friday morning ; but as soon as he heard , he gave up going to the Isle o ' Man , and just ran over to Rhyl with the mate , one John Harris , as has friends a bit beyond Abergele ; you may have heard him speak on him , for they are great chums , though I 've my own opinion of Harris . "
140615	140621	140623	140623	Mary	124	" And he 's sailed ? "
140635	140686	140687	140687	She	124	" Ay , he went on board last night to be ready for the morning 's tide , as I said afore , and my boy went to see the ship go down the river , and came back all agog with the sight . Here , Charley , Charley ! "
140705	140710	140687	140687	She	124	" far to seek , "
140780	140782	140763	140765	spectator and auditor	3560	" dollying "
140816	140854	140877	140877	he	297	" Oh , Charley ! there you are ! Did you not see the John Cropper sail down the river this morning ? Tell the young woman about it , for I think she hardly credits me . "
140855	140875	140877	140877	he	297	" I saw her tugged down the river by a steam - boat , which comes to same thing , "
140879	140890	140877	140877	he	297	" Oh ! if I had but come last night ! "
140894	140940	140877	140877	he	297	" But I never thought of it . I never thought but what he knew right when he said he would be back from the Isle of Man on Monday morning , and not afore — and now some one must die for my negligence ! "
140941	140944	140946	140947	the lad	4919	" Die ! "
140949	140952	140946	140947	the lad	4919	" How ? "
140953	140971	140877	140877	he	297	" Oh ! Will would have proved an alibi,—but he 's gone,—and what am I to do ? "
140972	140980	140982	140984	the energetic boy	3564	" Do n't give it up yet , "
140993	141012	140982	140984	the energetic boy	3564	" let 's have a try for him . We are but where we were if we fail . "
141019	141021	140877	140877	he	297	" we "
141028	141046	140877	140877	he	297	" But what can be done ? You say he 's sailed ; what can be done ? "
141061	141086	141048	141048	she	124	" No ! I did not say he 'd sailed ; mother said that , and women know nought about such matters . You see "
141115	141206	141048	141048	she	124	" there 's sand - banks at the mouth of the river , and ships ca n't get over them but at high - water ; especially ships of heavy burden , like the John Cropper . Now , she was tugged down the river at low water , or pretty near , and will have to lie some time before the water will be high enough to float her over the banks . So hold up your head,—you've a chance yet , though may be but a poor one . "
141207	141214	141216	141216	Mary	124	" But what must I do ? "
141229	141232	141234	141235	the boy	3566	" Do ! "
141239	141322	141234	141235	the boy	3566	" why , have not I told you ? Only women ( begging your pardon ) are so stupid at understanding about any thing belonging to the sea;—you must get a boat , and make all haste , and sail after him,—after the John Cropper . You may overtake her , or you may not . It 's just a chance ; but she 's heavy laden , and that 's in your favour . She 'll draw many feet of water . "
141365	141371	141350	141350	she	124	" I beg your pardon , "
141396	141402	141404	141404	she	124	" I beg your pardon , "
141406	141424	141404	141404	she	124	" but I do n't know where to get a boat . Are there boat - stands ? "
141430	141474	141425	141426	The lad	4919	" You 're not long in Liverpool , I guess . Boat - stands ! No ; go down to the pier,—any pier will do , and hire a boat,—you'll be at no loss when once you are there . Only make haste . "
141475	141491	141493	141493	Mary	124	" Oh , you need not tell me that , if I but knew how , "
141499	141535	141493	141493	Mary	124	" But you say right,—I never was here before , and I do n't know my way to the place you speak on ; only tell me , and I 'll not lose a minute . "
141536	141539	141541	141543	the wilful lad	3571	" Mother ! "
141545	141568	141569	141569	he	3571	" I 'm going to show her the way to the pier ; I 'll be back in an hour,—or so , — "
141654	141671	141644	141644	he	3571	" Ahem!—What 's your name ? It 's so awkward to be calling you young woman . "
141672	141679	141681	141681	she	124	" My name is Mary,—Mary Barton , "
141733	141748	141700	141700	she	124	" And you want Will Wilson to prove an alibi — is that it ? "
141749	141762	141700	141700	she	124	" Yes — oh , yes — can we not cross now ? "
141763	141791	141700	141700	she	124	" No , wait a minute ; it 's the teagle hoisting above your head I 'm afraid of;—and who is it that 's to be tried ? "
141792	141805	141700	141700	she	124	" Jem ; oh , lad ! ca n't we get past ? "
141846	141867	141828	141829	Master Charley	299	" Mary , is Jem your brother , or your sweetheart , that you 're so set upon saving him ? "
141868	141873	141875	141875	she	3576	" No — no , "
141897	141918	141944	141944	she	3576	" Perhaps he 's your cousin , then ? Many a girl has a cousin who has not a sweetheart . "
141919	141942	141944	141944	she	3576	" No , he 's neither kith nor kin to me . What 's the matter ? What are you stopping for ? "
141965	142046	141944	141944	she	3576	" Oh , nothing to flurry you so , Mary . I heard you say to mother you had never been in Liverpool before , and if you 'll only look up this street you may see the back windows of our Exchange . Such a building as yon is ! with ' natomy hiding under a blanket , and Lord Admiral Nelson , and a few more people in the middle of the court ! No ! come here , "
142070	142093	141944	141944	she	3576	" Here , then , now you can see it . You can say , now , you 've seen Liverpool Exchange . "
142094	142139	141944	141944	she	3576	" Yes , to be sure — it 's a beautiful window , I 'm sure . But are we near the boats ? I 'll stop as I come back , you know ; only I think we 'd better get on now . "
142140	142198	141944	141944	she	3576	" Oh ! if the wind 's in your favour , you 'll be down the river in no time , and catch Will , I 'll be bound ; and if it 's not , why , you know , the minute it took you to look at the Exchange will be neither here nor there . "
142231	142241	142224	142224	Charley	299	" You 've never said where you come from ? "
142242	142245	142247	142247	she	124	" Manchester , "
142249	142287	142247	142247	she	124	" Eh , then ! you 've a power of things to see . Liverpool beats Manchester hollow , they say . A nasty , smoky hole , bean't it ? Are you bound to live there ? "
142288	142298	141944	141944	she	3576	" Oh , yes ! it 's my home . "
142299	142341	142247	142247	she	124	" Well , I do n't think I could abide a home in the middle of smoke . Look there ! now you see the river ! That 's something now you 'd give a deal for in Manchester . Look ! "
142385	142390	141944	141944	she	3576	" braving the battle , "
142632	142638	142640	142640	she	124	" Why are we here ? "
142644	142676	142640	142640	she	124	" There are no little boats about , and I thought I was to go in a little boat ; those ships are never meant for short distances , are they ? "
142677	142683	142685	142685	he	299	" To be sure not , "
142690	142756	142757	142757	Mary	124	" But the John Cropper lay in this dock , and I know many of the sailors ; and if I could see one I knew , I 'd ask him to run up the mast , and see if he could catch a sight of her in the offing . If she 's weighed her anchor no use for your going , you know . "
142838	142844	142846	142846	Charley	299	" Here 's Tom Bourne ! "
143055	143060	143062	143062	she	124	" He 'll fall ! "
143099	143103	143105	143105	Charley	299	" Not he ! "
143107	143200	143105	143105	Charley	299	" He 's at the mast - head now . See ! he 's looking through his glass , and using his arms as steady as if he were on dry land . Why , I 've been up the mast , many and many a time ; only do n't tell mother . She thinks I 'm to be a shoemaker , but I 've made up my mind to be a sailor ; only there 's no good arguing with a woman . You 'll not tell her , Mary ? "
143201	143206	143208	143208	she	3619	" Oh , see ! "
143230	143248	143208	143208	she	3619	" See ! he 's coming down ; he 's down . Speak to him , Charley . "
143260	143273	143255	143255	she	3619	" Can you see the John Cropper ? Is she there yet ? "
143274	143279	143280	143280	he	299	" Ay , ay , "
143321	143340	143341	143341	They	3620	" You 've the wind right against you , and must use oars . No time to lose . "
143424	143431	143433	143433	Mary	124	" Oh , pray make haste , "
143435	143466	143433	143433	Mary	124	" I want you to take me to the John Cropper . Where is she , Charley ? Tell them — I do n't rightly know the words,—only make haste ! "
143467	143479	143483	143484	the men	1005	" In the offing she is , sure enough , miss , "
143505	143516	143518	143518	he	299	" I do n't think we can go , Dick , "
143527	143540	143518	143518	he	299	" there 's the gentleman over at New Brighton as wants us . "
143541	143563	143565	143566	the other	902	" But , mayhap , the young woman will pay us handsome for giving her a last look at her sweetheart , "
143568	143593	143595	143595	Mary	124	" Oh , how much do you want ? Only make haste — I've enough to pay you , but every moment is precious , "
143597	143628	143595	143595	Mary	124	" Ay , that it is . Less than an hour wo n't take us to the mouth of the river , and she 'll be off by two o'clock ! "
143634	143639	143629	143630	Poor Mary	124	" plenty of money , "
143671	143673	143667	143668	the boatmen	3630	" plenty "
143726	143756	143708	143708	Charley	299	" Give it 'em , Mary ; they 'll none of them take you for less . It 's your only chance . There 's St. Nicholas ringing one ! "
143757	143766	143768	143768	she	124	" I 've only got fourteen and ninepence , "
143779	143805	143807	143807	she	124	" but I 'll give you my shawl , and you can sell it for four or five shillings,—oh ! wo n't that much do ? "
144487	144513	144514	144514	He	3656	" Yon second to the norrard is the John Cropper . Wind 's right now , and sails will soon carry us alongside of her . "
144622	144628	144630	144633	one of the boatmen	3663	" They 're heaving anchor ! "
144742	144744	144733	144733	They	1005	" ahoy "
145139	145191	145193	145198	the boat - man of Mary	3692	" We 're come for one William Wilson , who is wanted to prove an alibi in Liverpool Assize Courts to - morrow . James Wilson is to be tried for a murder , done on Thursday night , when he was with William Wilson . Any thing more , missis ? "
145214	145242	145243	145244	The boatman	3693	" Say I 'm Mary Barton . Oh , the ship is going on ! Oh , for the love of Heaven , ask them to stop . "
145419	145427	145408	145408	she	124	" Hark ! yon sailor hails us . "
145475	145504	145471	145471	his	306	" So help me God , Mary Barton , I 'll come back in the pilot - boat , time enough to save the life of the innocent . "
145505	145511	145513	145513	Mary	124	" What does he say ? "
145539	145545	145547	145547	she	124	" What does he say ? "
145549	145558	145547	145547	she	124	" Tell me . I could not hear . "
145604	145613	145615	145615	she	124	" I do n't rightly know about it , "
145619	145627	145628	145628	They	3630	" What is the pilot - boat ? "
145659	145670	145674	145674	they	3630	" How far does the pilot go with the ship ? "
145744	145752	145730	145735	the pilot aboard the John Cropper	3716	" How soon would he come back ? "
146269	146281	146283	146286	the gray old man	3728	" Now tell me where you are bound to , missis , "
146288	146299	146283	146286	the gray old man	3728	" and maybe I can put you in the way . "
146366	146371	146373	146381	the older man , who lingered on the step	3730	" No , no ! "
146397	146431	146373	146381	the older man , who lingered on the step	3730	" Keep it ! we donnot want it . It were only for to try you,—some folks say they 've no more blunt , when all the while they 've getten a mint . "
146432	146436	146438	146438	she	124	" Thank you , "
146447	146460	146462	146465	the gruff old fellow	3732	" Where are you bound to ? I axed that question afore , "
146467	146478	146480	146480	she	124	" I do n't know . I 'm a stranger , "
146494	146502	146504	146504	he	3732	" But you mun find out then , "
146508	146528	146504	146504	he	3732	" pier - head 's no place for a young woman to be standing on , gape - saying . "
146529	146540	146541	146541	she	124	" I 've a card somewhere as will tell me , "
146963	146992	146956	146956	He	3742	" D — — you , I ask you again where you 're bound to ? Do n't sit there , stupid . Where are you going to ? "
146993	146999	147001	147001	Mary	124	" I do n't know , "
147003	147032	147001	147001	Mary	124	" Come , come ; avast with that story . You said a bit ago you 'd a card , which was to tell you where to go . "
147033	147046	147047	147047	She	124	" I had , but I 've lost it . Never mind . "
147091	147097	147099	147099	she	124	" What do you want ? "
147103	147116	147118	147118	he	3742	" Come with me , and be d —— d to you ! "
147326	147331	147333	147334	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" Why , yes , "
147341	147405	147333	147334	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" I have seen him , but to little purpose , I 'm afraid . He 's very impracticable — very . I told him , of course , that he must be perfectly open with me , or else I could not be prepared for the weak points . I named your name with the view of unlocking his confidence , but — "
147406	147412	147414	147414	Job	135	" What did he say ? "
147418	147452	147414	147414	Job	135	" Why , very little . He barely answered me . Indeed , he refused to answer some questions — positively refused . I do n't know what I can do for him . "
147453	147462	147464	147464	Job	135	" Then you think him guilty , sir ? "
147468	147475	147477	147478	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" No , I do n't , "
147484	147519	147477	147478	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" Much less than I did before I saw him . The impression ( mind , ' tis only impression ; I rely upon your caution , not to take it for fact)—the impression , "
147527	147571	147572	147572	He	285	" he gave me is , that he knows something about the affair , but what , he will not say ; and so the chances are , if he persists in his obstinacy , he 'll be hung . That 's all . "
147586	147594	147596	147596	Job	135	" But he must not be hung , "
147615	147633	147635	147635	Job	135	" What did he say , sir , if I may be so bold as to ask ? "
147637	147869	147635	147635	Job	135	" His words were few enough , and he was so reserved and short , that as I said before , I can only give you the impression they conveyed to me . I told him of course who I was , and for what I was sent . He looked pleased , I thought,—at least his face ( sad enough when I went in , I assure ye ) brightened a little ; but he said he had nothing to say , no defence to make . I asked him if he was guilty , then ; and by way of opening his heart I said I understood he had had provocation enough , inasmuch as I heard that the girl was very lovely , and had jilted him to fall desperately in love with that handsome young Carson ( poor fellow ! ) . But James Wilson did not speak one way or another . I then went to particulars . I asked him if the gun was his , as his mother had declared . He had not heard of her admission it was evident , from his quick way of looking up , and the glance of his eye ; but when he saw I was observing him , he hung down his head again , and merely said she was right ; it was his gun . "
147870	147873	147875	147875	Job	135	" Well ! "
147884	147895	147897	147898	that gentleman	3757	" Nay ! I have little more to tell you , "
147900	148008	147897	147898	that gentleman	3757	" I asked him to inform me in all confidence , how it came to be found there . He was silent for a time , and then refused . Not only refused to answer that question , but candidly told me he would not say another word on the subject , and , thanking me for my trouble and interest in his behalf , he all but dismissed me . Ungracious enough on the whole , was it not , Mr. Legh ? And yet , I assure ye , I am twenty times more inclined to think him innocent than before I had the interview . "
148009	148017	148019	148019	Job	135	" I wish Mary Barton would come , "
148023	148034	148019	148019	Job	135	" She and Will are a long time about it . "
148035	148047	148049	148050	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" Ay , that 's our only chance , I believe , "
148057	148094	148049	148050	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" I sent Johnson off before twelve to serve him with his sub - pœna , and to say I wanted to speak with him ; he 'll be here soon , I 've no doubt . "
148109	148178	148100	148101	Mr. Bridgenorth	285	" Mr. Duncombe promised to be here to speak to his character . I sent him a subpœna on Saturday night . Though after all , juries go very little by such general and vague testimony as that to character . It is very right that they should not often ; but in this instance unfortunate for us , as we must rest our case on the alibi . "
148288	148295	148275	148275	He	135	" Of course we expected this , "
148594	148602	148604	148604	Job	135	" But Will Wilson is not come , "
148609	148652	148604	148604	Job	135	" Just wait while I run to his lodgings . I would have done it before , but I thought they 'd be here every minute , and I were afraid of missing them . I 'll be back in no time . "
148653	148782	148793	148793	his	3769	" No , my good fellow , I really must go . Besides , I begin to think Johnson must have made a mistake , and have fixed with this William Wilson to meet me at the courts . If you like to wait for him here , pray make use of my room ; but I 've a notion I shall find him there : in which case , I 'll send him to your lodgings ; shall I ? You know where to find me . I shall be here again by eight o'clock , and with the evidence of this witness that 's to prove the alibi , I 'll have the brief drawn out , and in the hands of counsel to - night . "
148901	148904	148895	148895	she	6953	" No ! "
148905	148909	148881	148881	He	2773	" Why not ? "
148910	148929	148895	148895	she	6953	" Why , bless you , 'cause he had sailed some hours before she came asking for him . "
148950	148958	148960	148960	Job	135	" Where is the young woman now ? "
148962	148969	148970	148970	she	282	" Somewhere down at the docks , "
148973	149017	148970	148970	she	282	" Charley would know , if he was in , but he was n't . He was in mischief , somewhere or other , she had no doubt . Boys always were . He would break his neck some day , she knew ; "
149100	149122	149128	149128	she	666	" Here 's an old man come to know where the young woman is who went out with thee this morning , "
149138	149196	149128	149128	she	666	" Where she is now , I do n't know . I saw her last sailing down the river after the John Cropper . I 'm afeared she wo n't reach her ; wind changed and she would be under weigh , and over the bar in no time . She should have been back by now . "
149226	149236	149238	149239	the boy	3566	" I 'll run down again to the pier , "
149241	149250	149238	149239	the boy	3566	" I 'll warrant I 'll find her . "
149251	149260	149266	149266	her	124	" Thou shalt do no such a thing , "
149338	149354	149324	149336	poor Mrs. Wilson , who would be wondering what had become of him	114	" How can I best find her ? Who did she go with , lad ? "
149386	149396	149398	149398	he	299	" They were river boatmen;—that 's all I know , "
149400	149410	149398	149398	he	299	" But what was the name of their boat ? "
149414	149435	149412	149412	Job	135	" I never took no notice;—the Anne , or William,—or some of them common names , I 'll be bound . "
149436	149444	149446	149446	Job	135	" What pier did she start from ? "
149450	149519	149520	149520	he	135	" Oh , as for that matter , it were the stairs on the Prince 's Pier she started from ; but she 'll not come back to the same , for the American steamer came up with the tide , and anchored close to it , blocking up the way for all the smaller craft . It 's a rough evening too , to be out on , "
149524	149543	149545	149545	Job	135	" Well , God 's will be done ! I did hope we could have saved the lad , "
149549	149573	149545	149545	Job	135	" but I 'm getten very doubtful again . I 'm uneasy about Mary , too,—very . She 's a stranger in Liverpool . "
149574	149580	149582	149582	Charley	299	" So she told me , "
149584	149611	149582	149582	Charley	299	" There 's traps about for young women at every corner . It 's a pity she 's no one to meet her when she lands . "
149612	149617	149619	149619	Job	135	" As for that , "
149621	149730	149619	149619	Job	135	" I do n't see how any one could meet her when we ca n't tell where she would come to . I must trust to her coming right . She 's getten spirit and sense . She 'll most likely be for coming here again . Indeed , I do n't know what else she can do , for she knows no other place in Liverpool . Missus , if she comes , will you give your son leave to bring her to No . 8 , Back Garden Court , where there 's friends waiting for her ? I 'll give him sixpence for his trouble . "
149833	149836	149838	149838	she	114	" Well ! "
149856	149861	149863	149863	she	114	" Well , speak ! "
149918	149938	149939	149939	She	114	" Will 's not to the fore . But he 'll may be turn up yet , time enough . "
149991	150055	150056	150056	She	114	" Do n't go for to say that ! Thou dost not think it . Thou'rt well - nigh hopeless , like me . I seed all along my lad would be hung for what he never did . And better he were , and were shut [ 49 ] of this weary world , where there 's neither justice nor mercy left . "
150078	150088	150090	150090	Job	135	" Nay , now thou'rt off at a gallop , "
150092	150154	150164	150164	she	114	" Will has sailed this morning for sure , but that brave wench , Mary Barton , is after him , and will bring him back , I 'll be bound , if she can but get speech on him . She 's not back yet . Come , come , hold up thy head . It will all end right . "
150155	150162	150164	150164	she	114	" It will all end right , "
150166	150290	150164	150164	she	114	" but not as thou tak'st it . Jem will be hung , and will go to his father and the little lads , where the Lord God wipes away all tears , and where the Lord Jesus speaks kindly to the little ones , who look about for the mothers they left upon earth . Eh , Job , yon 's a blessed land , and I long to go to it , and yet I fret because Jem is hastening there . I would not fret if he and I could lie down to - night to sleep our last sleep ; not a bit would I fret if folk would but know him to be innocent — as I do . "

150383	150390	150392	150392	he	135	" You just go to bed , "
150397	150466	150392	150392	he	135	" You 'll want your strength for to - morrow . Jem will be sadly off , if he sees you so cut up as you look to - night . I 'll step down again and find Mary . She 'll be back by this time . I 'll come and tell you every thing , never fear . But , now , you go to bed . "
150467	150509	150510	150510	She	3789	" Thou'rt a kind friend , Job Legh , and I 'll go , as thou wishest me . But , oh ! mind thou com'st straight off to me , and bring Mary as soon as thou'st lit on her . "
150518	150523	150525	150525	Job	135	" Ay , ay ! "
150592	150599	150601	150602	the lawyer	6709	" It 's a bad job , "
150614	150758	150601	150602	the lawyer	6709	" Johnson told me how it was ; the woman that Wilson lodged with told him . I doubt it 's but a wild - goose chase of the girl Barton . Our case must rest on the uncertainty of circumstantial evidence , and the goodness of the prisoner 's previous character . A very vague and weak defence . However , I 've engaged Mr. Clinton as counsel , and he 'll make the best of it . And now , my good fellow , I must wish you good - night , and turn you out of doors . As it is , I shall have to sit up into the small hours . Did you see my clerk as you came up - stairs ? You did ! Then may I trouble you to ask him to step up immediately ? "
150994	151006	151008	151008	he	299	" Yon Mary Barton has getten into some scrape or another , "
151015	151059	151008	151008	he	299	" She 's not to be heard of at any of the piers ; and Bourne says it were a boat from the Cheshire side as she went aboard of . So there 's no hearing of her till to - morrow morning . "
151060	151083	151085	151085	Job	135	" To - morrow morning she 'll have to be in court at nine o'clock , to bear witness on a trial , "

151317	151322	151323	151323	Job	135	" Who 's there ? "
151375	151381	151382	151382	she	114	" Job ! Job Legh ! "
151388	151393	151397	151397	himself	135	" Eh , dear ! "
151408	151465	151397	151397	himself	135	" I wonder if one little lie would be a sin as things stand ? It would happen give her sleep , and she wo n't have sleep for many and many a night ( not to call sleep ) , if things goes wrong to - morrow . I 'll chance it , any way . "
151466	151473	151475	151475	she	114	" Job ! art thou there ? "
151490	151506	151475	151475	she	114	" Ay ! sure ! I thought thou'd ha ' been asleep by this time . "
151507	151522	151532	151532	himself	135	" Asleep ! How could I sleep till I knowed if Will were found ? "
151523	151528	151532	151532	himself	135	" Now for it , "

151639	151659	151633	151633	he	135	" He can prove all ; and Jem will come off as clear as a new - born babe . "
151761	151775	151777	151777	she	114	" And Mary ? Thou'st found her at Mrs. Jones 's , Job ? "
151789	151806	151808	151808	he	135	" Yes , she was there , safe enough , second time of going.—God forgive me ! "
151810	151829	151808	151808	he	135	" who 'd ha ' thought of my turning out such an arrant liar in my old days ? "

151867	151911	151855	151855	Job	135	" She was a bit weary , and o'er done with her sail ; and Mrs. Jones axed her to stay there all night . It was nigh at hand to the courts , where she will have to be in the morning . "

152688	152695	152684	152685	her husband	470	" Well - a - well ! "
152718	152794	152716	152716	herself	563	" I only thought you might , you know , as you brought her home . Poor thing ! we must not ask aught about her , but that she needs help . I wish I 'd my salts at home , but I lent 'em to Mrs. Burton , last Sunday in church , for she could not keep awake through the sermon . Dear - a - me , how white she is ! "
152795	152805	152810	152810	She	3850	" Here ! you hold her up a bit , "

152937	153026	153028	153028	she	3850	" Taking my pen , as I 've had better nor five year . Bless us , and save us ! he 's burning it ! Ay , I see now , he 's his wits about him ; burnt feathers is always good for a faint . But they do n't bring her round , poor wench ! Now what 's he after next ? Well ! he is a bright one , my old man ! That I never thought of that , to be sure ! "

153080	153097	153062	153062	she	3850	" Bless the man ! It 's just like him to be so tender and thoughtful ! "
153098	153103	153105	153105	he	3853	" Not a bit ! "
153127	153140	153105	153105	he	3853	" not a bit ! I never was such a fool afore . "

153171	153196	153198	153198	Mary	124	" Yes , sir , and thank you . I 'm sure , sir , I do n't know rightly how to thank you , "
153203	153212	153198	153198	Mary	124	" Be hanged to you and your thanks . "
153286	153307	153270	153270	she	124	" Nay ! nay ! who e'er thou be'st , thou'rt not fit to go out into the street . Perhaps "
153315	153439	153440	153440	Mary	124	" thou'rt a bad one ; I almost misdoubt thee , thou'rt so pretty . Well - a - well ! it 's the bad ones as have the broken hearts , sure enough ; good folk never get utterly cast down , they 've always getten hope in the Lord : it 's the sinful as bear the bitter , bitter grief in their crushed hearts , poor souls ; it 's them we ought , most of all , to pity and to help . She shanna leave the house to - night , choose who she is,—worst woman in Liverpool , she shanna . I wished I knew where th ' old man picked her up , that I do . "
153461	153526	153527	153527	She	124	" I 'm not a bad one , missis , indeed . Your master took me out to sea after a ship as had sailed . There was a man in it as might save a life at the trial to - morrow . The captain would not let him come , but he says he 'll come back in the pilot - boat . "
153553	153594	153540	153542	the old woman	814	" Well - a - well ! and he 'll come back , I 'm sure . I know he will ; so keep up your heart . Do n't fret about it . He 's sure to be back . "
153595	153610	153612	153612	Mary	124	" Oh ! I 'm afraid ! I 'm sore afraid he wo n't , "

153928	153959	153960	153960	She	413	" Well - a - well , wind changes often at night . Time enough before morning . I 'd bet a penny it has changed sin ' thou looked . "
154029	154051	154053	154053	she	413	" There 's no one else who can prove what you want at the trial to - morrow , is there ? "
154055	154059	154061	154061	Mary	124	" No one ! "
154063	154082	154083	154083	Mary	124	" And you 've no clue to the one as is really guilty , if t'other is not ? "
154097	154106	154108	154108	he	3877	" Do n't bother her with thy questions , "
154113	154158	154159	154159	Mary	124	" She mun go to bed , for she 's all in a shiver with the sea air . I 'll see after the wind , hang it , and the weather - cock , too . Tide will help 'em when it turns . "
154303	154321	154323	154323	Mary	124	" I can not sleep , thank you . I will sit here , if you please , "
154333	154338	154340	154341	Mrs. Sturgis	316	" Come , now , "
154343	154440	154340	154341	Mrs. Sturgis	316	" my master told me to see you to bed , and I mun . What 's the use of watching ? A watched pot never boils , and I see you are after watching that weather - cock . Why now , I try never to look at it , else I could do nought else . My heart many a time goes sick when the wind rises , but I turn away and work away , and try never to think on the wind , but on what I ha ' getten to do . "
154441	154449	154451	154451	Mary	124	" Let me stay up a little , "
154471	154519	154465	154465	Her	124	" Well , I suppose I mun . I shall catch it down stairs , I know . He 'll be in a fidget till you 're getten to bed , I know ; so you mun be quiet if you are so bent upon staying up . "
155174	155185	155186	155186	Job	135	" Here 's a letter for you from our client ! "
156029	156040	156009	156010	The clerk	3938	" How say you , Guilty , or Not Guilty ? "
156208	156215	156195	156195	his	3939	" Not guilty , my lord . "
156276	156290	156271	156271	his	3939	" That 's Mr. Carson , the father , sitting behind Serjeant Wilkinson ! "
156291	156325	156568	156568	His	128	" What a noble - looking old man he is ! so stern and inflexible , with such classical features ! Does he not remind you of some of the busts of Jupiter ? "
156326	156399	156271	156271	his	3939	" I am more interested by watching the prisoner . Criminals always interest me . I try to trace in the features common to humanity some expression of the crimes by which they have distinguished themselves from their kind . I have seen a good number of murderers in my day , but I have seldom seen one with such marks of Cain on his countenance as the man at the bar . "
156400	156436	156271	156271	his	3939	" Well , I am no physiognomist , but I do n't think his face strikes me as bad . It certainly is gloomy and depressed , and not unnaturally so , considering his situation . "
156437	156463	156568	156568	His	128	" Only look at his low , resolute brow , his downcast eye , his white compressed lips . He never looks up,—just watch him . "
156464	156564	156271	156271	his	3939	" His forehead is not so low if he had that mass of black hair removed , and is very square , which some people say is a good sign . If others are to be influenced by such trifles as you are , it would have been much better if the prison barber had cut his hair a little previous to the trial ; and as for down - cast eye , and compressed lip , it is all part and parcel of his inward agitation just now ; nothing to do with character , my good fellow . "

156665	156673	156675	156676	his friend	438	" Black as night , you mean , "

156770	156775	156762	156762	her	114	" an old woman , "
156959	156969	156953	156954	The counsel	3963	" Your name is Jane Wilson , I believe . "
156970	156975	157025	157025	her	114	" Yes , sir . "
156976	156986	157025	157025	her	114	" The mother of the prisoner at the bar ? "
156987	156992	156953	156954	The counsel	3963	" Yes , sir ; "
157109	157121	157122	157122	She	114	" That gun belongs to your son , does it not ? "
157148	157160	157144	157144	she	114	" Oh ! Jem , Jem ! what mun I say ? "
157214	157221	157189	157189	He	7024	" Tell the truth , mother ! "
157373	157477	157364	157364	she	114	" And now , sir , I 've telled you the truth , and the whole truth , as he bid me ; but do n't ye let what I have said go for to hang him ; oh , my lord judge , take my word for it , he 's as innocent as the child as has yet to be born . For sure , I , who am his mother , and have nursed him on my knee , and been gladdened by the sight of him every day since , ought to know him better than yon pack of fellows "
157503	157658	157484	157484	she	3986	" who , I 'll go bail , never saw him before this morning in all their born days . My lord judge , he 's so good I often wondered what harm there was in him ; many is the time when I 've been fretted ( for I 'm frabbit enough at times ) , when I 've scold't myself , and said , ' You ungrateful thing , the Lord God has given you Jem , and is n't that blessing enough for you ? ' But He has seen fit to punish me . If Jem is — if Jem is — taken from me , I shall be a childless woman ; and very poor , having nought left to love on earth , and I can not say ' His will be done . ' I can not , my lord judge , oh , I can not . "
158446	158449	158462	158462	He	4013	" Beatrice Cenci "
158716	158750	158700	158703	the pert young barrister	4016	" And pray , may I ask , which was the favoured lover ? You say you knew both these young men . Which was the favoured lover ? Which did you prefer ? "
158992	159302	159304	159304	she	4025	" He asks me which of them two I liked the best . Perhaps I liked Mr. Harry Carson once — I do n't know — I've forgotten ; but I loved James Wilson , that 's now on trial , above what tongue can tell — above all else on earth put together ; and I love him now better than ever , though he has never known a word of it till this minute . For you see , sir , mother died before I was thirteen , before I could know right from wrong about some things ; and I was giddy and vain , and ready to listen to any praise of my good looks ; and this poor young Mr. Carson fell in with me , and told me he loved me ; and I was foolish enough to think he meant me marriage : a mother is a pitiful loss to a girl , sir ; and so I used to fancy I could like to be a lady , and rich , and never know want any more . I never found out how dearly I loved another till one day , when James Wilson asked me to marry him , and I was very hard and sharp in my answer ( for indeed , sir , I 'd a deal to bear just then ) , and he took me at my word and left me ; and from that day to this I 've never spoken a word to him , or set eyes on him ; though I 'd fain have done so , to try and show him we had both been too hasty ; for he 'd not been gone out of my sight above a minute before I knew I loved — far above my life , "
159323	159359	159360	159360	She	4025	" But , if the gentleman asks me which I loved the best , I make answer , I was flattered by Mr. Carson , and pleased with his flattery ; but James Wilson I — "
159417	159432	159409	159410	the counsellor	4027	" But you have seen young Mr. Carson since your rejection of the prisoner ? "
159433	159438	159390	159390	her	4025	" Yes , often . "
159439	159453	159390	159390	her	4025	" You have spoken to him , I conclude , at these times . "
159454	159461	159390	159390	her	4025	" Only once to call speaking . "
159462	159483	159390	159390	her	4025	" And what was the substance of your conversation ? Did you tell him you found you preferred his rival ? "
159484	159541	159390	159390	her	4025	" No , sir . I do n't think as I 've done wrong in saying , now as things stand , what my feelings are ; but I never would be so bold as to tell one young man I cared for another . I never named Jem 's name to Mr. Carson . Never . "
159542	159575	159390	159390	her	4025	" Then what did you say when you had this final conversation with Mr. Carson ? You can give me the substance of it , if you do n't remember the words . "
159576	159632	159390	159390	her	4025	" I 'll try , sir ; but I 'm not very clear . I told him I could not love him , and wished to have nothing more to do with him . He did his best to over - persuade me , but I kept steady , and at last I ran off . "
159633	159642	159390	159390	her	4025	" And you never spoke to him again ? "
159643	159646	159390	159390	her	4025	" Never ! "
159647	159705	159390	159390	her	4025	" Now , young woman , remember you are upon your oath . Did you ever tell the prisoner at the bar of Mr. Henry Carson 's attentions to you ? of your acquaintance , in short ? Did you ever try to excite his jealousy by boasting of a lover so far above you in station ? "
159706	159713	159715	159715	she	4028	" Never . I never did , "
159730	159753	159715	159715	she	4028	" Were you aware that he knew of Mr. Henry Carson 's regard for you ? Remember you are on your oath ! "
159754	159810	159390	159390	her	4025	" Never , sir . I was not aware until I heard of the quarrel between them , and what Jem had said to the policeman , and that was after the murder . To this day I ca n't make out who told Jem . Oh , sir , may not I go down ? "
160042	160047	160049	160049	Mary	124	" No ! no ! "
160055	160076	160049	160049	Mary	124	" I must be here , I must watch that they do n't hang him , you know I must . "
160077	160128	160175	160176	Mrs. Sturgis	316	" Oh ! they 'll not hang him ! never fear ! Besides the wind has changed , and that 's in his favour . Come away . You 're so hot , and first white and then red ; I 'm sure you 're ill . Just come away . "
160129	160145	160147	160147	Mary	124	" Oh ! I do n't know about any thing but that I must stay , "

160912	160970	160972	160972	she	124	" I must not go mad . I must not , indeed . They say people tell the truth when they 're mad ; but I do n't . I was always a liar . I was , indeed ; but I 'm not mad . I must not go mad . I must not , indeed . "
161042	161058	161038	161038	she	124	" Oh , Jem ! Jem ! you 're saved ; and I am mad — "
161256	161269	161271	161271	he	135	" She 'll keep ! I 'll not trouble myself about her , "
161494	161511	161477	161477	he	4079	" a gallant tar brought back from the pathless ocean by a girl 's noble daring , "
161512	161523	161477	161477	he	4079	" the dangers of too hastily judging from circumstantial evidence , "
161616	161619	161570	161572	a suborned witness	4083	" perjury , "

162173	162318	162160	162160	he	128	" And now , my man , you 've told the court a very good and very convincing story ; no reasonable man ought to doubt the unstained innocence of your relation at the bar . Still there is one circumstance you have forgotten to name ; and I feel that without it your evidence is rather incomplete . Will you have the kindness to inform the gentlemen of the jury what has been your charge for repeating this very plausible story ? How much good coin of Her Majesty 's realm have you received , or are you to receive , for walking up from the docks , or some less creditable place , and uttering the tale you have just now repeated,—very much to the credit of your instructor , I must say ? Remember , sir , you are upon oath . "
162396	162523	162392	162392	Will	128	" Will you tell the judge and jury how much money you 've been paid for your impudence towards one who has told God 's blessed truth , and who would scorn to tell a lie , or blackguard any one , for the biggest fee as ever lawyer got for doing dirty work ? Will you tell , sir ? — But I 'm ready , my lord judge , to take my oath as many times as your lordship or the jury would like , to testify to things having happened just as I said . There 's O'Brien , the pilot , in court now . Would somebody with a wig on please to ask him how much he can say for me ? "
162925	162928	162961	162961	Jem	128	" Not Guilty "
163297	163317	163323	163323	he	135	" Here ! make yourself scarce ! I should think you 'd be glad to get out of that ! "
163565	163570	163571	163571	They	4147	" Where is she ? "
163672	163677	163679	163679	she	666	" Eh , lad ! "
163688	163772	163679	163679	she	666	" See what it is to have behaved thysel ! I could put in a good word for thee , and the jury could na go and hang thee in the face of th ' character I gave thee . Was na it a good thing they did na keep me from Liverpool ? But I would come ; I knew I could do thee good , bless thee , my lad . But thou'rt very white , and all of a tremble . "
163802	163807	163797	163797	he	4156	" Where is she ? "
164454	164514	164439	164440	Job Legh	135	" How is she ? Eh ! poor soul ! is that her ! no need to ask ! How strange her voice sounds ! Screech ! screech ! and she so low , sweet - spoken , when she 's well ! Thou must keep up heart , old boy , and not look so dismal , thysel . "
164515	164584	164586	164586	Jem	128	" I ca n't help it , Job ; it 's past a man 's bearing to hear such a one as she is , going on as she is doing ; even if I did not care for her , it would cut me sore to see one so young , and — I ca n't speak of it , Job , as a man should do , "
164593	164601	164603	164603	Job	135	" Let me in , will you ? "
164644	164753	164754	164754	Jem	128	" I 'd more than one reason for coming betimes . I wanted to hear how yon poor wench was;—that stood first . Late last night I got a letter from Margaret , very anxious - like . The doctor says the old lady yonder ca n't last many days longer , and it seems so lonesome for her to die with no one but Margaret and Mrs. Davenport about her . So I thought I 'd just come and stay with Mary Barton , and see as she 's well done to , and you and your mother and Will go and take leave of old Alice . "
164777	164818	164770	164770	Job	135	" She still wanders , Margaret says , and thinks she 's with her mother at home ; but for all that , she should have some kith and kin near her to close her eyes , to my thinking . "
164819	164834	164835	164835	Jem	128	" Could not you and Will take mother home ? I 'd follow when — "
164845	165125	164842	164842	Job	135	" Lad ! if thou knew what thy mother has suffered for thee , thou'd not speak of leaving her just when she 's got thee from the grave as it were . Why , this very night she roused me up , and ' Job , ' says she , ' I ask your pardon for wakening you , but tell me , am I awake or dreaming ? Is Jem proved innocent ? Oh , Job Legh ! God send I 've not been only dreaming it ! ' For thou see'st she ca n't rightly understand why thou'rt with Mary , and not with her . Ay , ay ! I know why ; but a mother only gives up her son 's heart inch by inch to his wife , and then she gives it up with a grudge . No , Jem ! thou must go with thy mother just now , if ever thou hopest for God 's blessing . She 's a widow , and has none but thee . Never fear for Mary ! She 's young and will struggle through . They are decent people , these folk she is with , and I 'll watch o'er her as though she was my own poor girl , that lies cold enough in London - town . I grant ye , it 's hard enough for her to be left among strangers . To my mind John Barton would be more in the way of his duty , looking after his daughter , than delegating it up and down the country , looking after every one 's business but his own . "
165147	165152	165154	165154	he	128	" She raves terribly , "
165156	165198	165154	165154	he	128	" All night long she 's been speaking of her father , and mixing up thoughts of him with the trial she saw yesterday . I should not wonder if she 'll speak of him as being in court next thing . "
165199	165207	165209	165209	Job	135	" I should na wonder , either , "
165211	165262	165209	165209	Job	135	" Folk in her way say many and many a strange thing ; and th ' best way is never to mind them . Now you take your mother home , Jem , and stay by her till old Alice is gone , and trust me for seeing after Mary . "
165482	165485	165487	165487	Job	135	" Jem ! "
165499	165502	165504	165504	he	135	" Jem ! "
165531	165545	165546	165546	He	128	" Thou must trust in God , and leave her in His hands . "
166094	166096	166091	166091	she	666	" Nunc Dimittis,"—the
166103	166129	166091	166091	she	666	" Mother , good night ! Dear mother ! bless me once more ! I 'm very tired , and would fain go to sleep . "
166485	166509	166479	166479	Jem	128	" Margaret , I 'm bound for Liverpool by the first train to - morrow ; I must set your grandfather at liberty . "
166510	166591	166593	166593	Margaret	136	" I 'm sure he likes nothing better than watching over poor Mary ; he loves her nearly as well as me . But let me go ! I have been so full of poor Alice , I 've never thought of it before ; I ca n't do so much as many a one , but Mary will like to have a woman about her that she knows . I 'm sorry I waited to be reminded , Jem . "
166652	166738	166745	166745	Margaret	136	" To tell truth , Margaret , it 's I that must go , and that for my own sake , not your grandfather 's . I can rest neither by night nor day for thinking on Mary . Whether she lives or dies I look on her as my wife before God , as surely and solemnly as if we were married . So being , I have the greatest right to look after her , and I can not yield it even to — "
166739	166743	166745	166745	Margaret	136	" Her father , "
166752	166812	166745	166745	Margaret	136	" It seems strange that a girl like her should be thrown on the bare world to struggle through so bad an illness . No one seems to know where John Barton is , else I thought of getting Morris to write him a letter telling him about Mary . I wish he was home , that I do ! "
166820	166832	166834	166834	he	128	" Mary 's not bad off for friends where she is , "
166836	167015	166834	166834	he	128	" I call them friends , though a week ago we none of us knew there were such folks in the world . But being anxious and sorrowful about the same thing makes people friends quicker than any thing , I think . She 's like a mother to Mary in her ways ; and he bears a good character , as far as I could learn just in that hurry . We 're drawing near home , and I 've not said my say , Margaret . I want you to look after mother a bit . She 'll not like my going , and I 've got to break it to her yet . If she takes it very badly , I 'll come back to - morrow night ; but if she 's not against it very much , I mean to stay till it 's settled about Mary , one way or the other . Will , you know , will be there , Margaret , to help a bit in doing for mother . "
167086	167149	167080	167080	Margaret	136	" If you can just step up to our house to - night , Jem , I 'll put up a few things as may be useful to Mary , and then you can say when you 'll likely be back . If you come home to - morrow night , and Will 's there , perhaps I need not step up ? "
167150	167217	167221	167221	Margaret	136	" Yes , Margaret , do ! I sha n't leave easy unless you go some time in the day to see mother . I 'll come to - night , though ; and now good - bye . Stay ! do you think you could just coax poor Will to walk a bit home with you , that I might speak to mother by myself ? "
167286	167289	167276	167276	he	128	" Mother ! "
167332	167352	167324	167324	he	128	" Mother ! I am going back to Liverpool to - morrow morning to see how Mary Barton is . "
167353	167376	167425	167425	his	128	" And what 's Mary Barton to thee , that thou shouldst be running after her in that - a - way ? "
167377	167408	167409	167409	His	128	" If she lives , she shall be my wedded wife . If she dies — mother , I ca n't speak of what I shall feel if she dies . "
167537	167618	167515	167515	she	666	" Thou'rt old enough to please thysel . Old mothers are cast aside , and what they 've borne forgotten , as soon as a pretty face comes across . I might have thought of that last Tuesday , when I felt as if thou wert all my own , and the judge were some wild animal trying to rend thee from me . I spoke up for thee then ; but it 's all forgotten now , I suppose . "
167619	167685	167686	167686	He	4227	" Mother ! you know all this while , you know I can never forget any kindness you 've ever done for me ; and they 've been many . Why should you think I 've only room for one love in my heart ? I can love you as dearly as ever , and Mary too , as much as man ever loved woman . "
167695	167701	167703	167703	he	4227	" Mother , answer me ! "
167708	167720	167703	167703	he	4227	" What mun I answer ? You asked me no question . "
167721	167778	167779	167779	She	4228	" Well ! I ask you this now . To - morrow morning I go to Liverpool to see her , who is as my wife . Dear mother ! will you bless me on my errand ? If it please God she recovers , will you take her to you as you would a daughter ? "
167786	167792	167794	167794	she	4228	" Why need you go ? "
167800	167822	167794	167794	she	4228	" You 'll be getting in some mischief or another again . Ca n't you stop at home quiet with me ? "
167866	167910	167845	167845	he	128	" Mother ! I often think what a good man father was ! I 've often heard you tell of your courting days ; and of the accident that befell you , and how ill you were . How long is it ago ? "
167911	167921	167923	167923	she	4228	" Near upon five - and - twenty years , "
167929	167956	167923	167923	she	4228	" You little thought when you were so ill you should live to have such a fine strapping son as I am , did you now ? "
167975	167991	167993	167993	she	4228	" Thou'rt not so fine a man as thy father was , by a deal ! "
168031	168041	168019	168019	He	128	" Those were happy days when father was alive ! "
168042	168064	168065	168065	She	4228	" You may say so , lad ! Such days as will never come again to me , at any rate . "
168069	168072	168074	168074	he	128	" Mother ! "
168091	168140	168074	168074	he	128	" you 'd like me to be as happy a man as my father was before me , would not you ? You 'd like me to have some one to make me as happy as you made father ? Now , would you not , dear mother ? "
168141	168156	168158	168158	she	4228	" I did not make him as happy as I might ha ' done , "
168171	168210	168158	168158	she	4228	" Th ' accident gave a jar to my temper it 's never got the better of ; and now he 's gone where he can never know how I grieve for having frabbed him as I did . "
168211	168222	168224	168224	Jem	128	" Nay , mother , we do n't know that ! "
168230	168339	168224	168224	Jem	128	" Any how , you and father got along with as few rubs as most people . But for his sake , dear mother , do n't say me nay , now that I come to you to ask your blessing before setting out to see her , who is to be my wife , if ever woman is ; for his sake , if not for mine , love her who I shall bring home to be to me all you were to him : and mother ! I do not ask for a truer or a tenderer heart than yours is , in the long run . "
168422	168444	168416	168416	she	4231	" God bless thee , Jem , my own dear lad . And may He bless Mary Barton for thy sake . "
168469	168492	168416	168416	she	4231	" Mother ! you show your own true self to Mary , and she 'll love you as dearly as I do . "
168514	168571	168572	168572	Margaret	136	" I must be off to see Margaret . Why , it 's near ten o'clock ! Could you have thought it ? Now do n't you stop up for me , mother . You and Will go to bed , for you 've both need of it . I shall be home in an hour . "
168631	168671	168615	168615	he	128	" To think how sorrow and joy are mixed up together . You 'll date your start in life as Mary 's acknowledged lover from poor Alice Wilson 's burial day . Well ! the dead are soon forgotten ! "
168672	168742	168605	168605	He	128	" Dear Margaret!—But you 're worn out with your long evening waiting for me . I do n't wonder . But never you , nor any one else , think because God sees fit to call up new interests , perhaps right out of the grave , that therefore the dead are forgotten . Margaret , you yourself can remember our looks , and fancy what we 're like . "
168743	168756	168615	168615	he	128	" Yes ! but what has that to do with remembering Alice ? "
168757	168971	168615	168615	he	128	" Why , just this . You 're not always trying to think on our faces , and making a labour of remembering ; but often , I 'll be bound , when you 're sinking off to sleep , or when you 're very quiet and still , the faces you knew so well when you could see , come smiling before you with loving looks . Or you remember them , without striving after it , and without thinking it 's your duty to keep recalling them . And so it is with them that are hidden from our sight . If they 've been worthy to be heartily loved while alive , they 'll not be forgotten when dead ; it 's against nature . And we need no more be upbraiding ourselves for letting in God 's rays of light upon our sorrow , and no more be fearful of forgetting them , because their memory is not always haunting and taking up our minds , than you need to trouble yourself about remembering your grandfather 's face , or what the stars were like,—you ca n't forget if you would , what it 's such a pleasure to think about . Do n't fear my forgetting Aunt Alice . "
168972	168993	168605	168605	He	128	" I 'm not , Jem ; not now , at least ; only you seemed so full about Mary . "
168994	169035	168605	168605	He	128	" I 've kept it down so long , remember . How glad Aunt Alice would have been to know that I might hope to have her for my wife ! that 's to say , if God spares her ! "
169036	169112	168615	168615	he	128	" She would not have known it , even if you could have told her this last fortnight,—ever since you went away she 's been thinking always that she was a little child at her mother 's apron - string . She must have been a happy little thing ; it was such a pleasure to her to think about those early days , when she lay old and gray on her death - bed . "
169113	169127	168615	168615	he	128	" I never knew any one seem more happy all her life long . "
169128	169148	169149	169149	They	4234	" Ay ! and how gentle and easy her death was ! She thought her mother was near her . "
169169	169195	169196	169196	She	4235	" I should have been gone long ago . Give me the bundle . You 'll not forget my mother . Good night , Margaret . "
171104	171107	171100	171100	I	0	" but one "
171447	171480	171444	171444	Mary	124	" Oh , Jem ! take me home . Yon river seems all made of glittering , heaving , dazzling metal , just as it did when I began to be ill . "
171498	171501	171488	171488	her	124	" Jem ! "
171513	171542	171543	171543	She	124	" When may I go home ? To Manchester , I mean . I am so weary of this place ; and I would fain be at home . "
171583	171640	171675	171675	her	4296	" Darling ! we will go whenever you wish ; whenever you feel strong enough . I asked Job to tell Margaret to get all in readiness for you to go there at first . She 'll tend you and nurse you . You must not go home . Job proffered for you to go there . "
171641	171672	171675	171675	her	4296	" Ah ! but I must go home , Jem . I 'll try and not fail now in what 's right . There are things we must not speak on "
171679	171718	171675	171675	her	4296	" but you 'll be really kind if you 'll not speak against my going home . Let us say no more about it , dear Jem . I must go home , and I must go alone . "
171719	171725	171675	171675	her	4296	" Not alone , Mary ! "
171726	171781	171782	171782	He	4297	" Yes , alone ! I can not tell you why I ask it . And if you guess , I know you well enough to be sure you 'll understand why I ask you never to speak on that again to me , till I begin . Promise , dear Jem , promise ! "
172210	172230	172234	172234	he	317	" I can not abide waste . What 's poured out mun be drunk . That 's my maxim . "
172302	172314	172316	172316	she	316	" Perhaps they 'll be too late for th ' train ! "
172330	172415	172316	172316	she	316	" What ! and come back again ! No ! no ! that would never do . We 've done our part , and cried our cry ; it 's no use going o'er the same ground again . I should ha ' to give 'em more out of yon bottle when next parting time came , and them three glasses they had made a hole in the stuff , I can tell you . Time Jack was back from Hamburg with some more . "
172787	172790	172792	172792	she	124	" Jem ! "
172811	172864	172865	172865	She	124	" you must go in there and wait half - an - hour . Not less . If in that time I do n't come back , you go your ways to your mother . Give her my dear love . I will send by Margaret when I want to see you . "
172869	172915	172916	172916	She	124	" Mary ! Mary ! I can not leave you . You speak as coldly as if we were to be nought to each other . And my heart 's bound up in you . I know why you bid me keep away , but — "
172963	173080	172947	172947	she	124	" Dear Jem ! I often could have told you more of love , if I had not once spoken out so free . Remember that time , Jem , if ever you think me cold . Then , the love that 's in my heart would out in words ; but now , though I 'm silent on the pain I 'm feeling in quitting you , the love is in my heart all the same . But this is not the time to speak on such things . If I do not do what I feel to be right now , I may blame myself all my life long ! Jem , you promised — "
173701	173721	173688	173688	she	602	" It 's Mary Barton ! I know her by her breathing ! Grandfather , it 's Mary Barton ! "
173761	173835	173836	173836	Margaret	136	" Ay , ay , Mary ! thou'rt looking a bit different to when I saw thee last . Thou'lt give Jem and me good characters for sick nurses , I trust . If all trades fail , I 'll turn to that . Jem 's place is for life , I reckon . Nay , never redden so , lass . You and he know each other 's minds by this time ! "
173861	173925	173848	173849	Job Legh	135	" Thou hast getten a bit of pink in thy cheeks,—not much ; but when last I saw thee , thy lips were as white as a sheet . Thy nose is sharpish at th ' end ; thou'rt more like thy father than ever thou wert before . Lord ! child , what 's the matter ? Art thou going to faint ? "
173950	173956	173957	173957	she	124	" Father 's come home ! "
173960	173993	173957	173957	she	124	" but he 's very poorly ; I never saw him as he is now , before . I asked Jem not to come near him for fear it might fidget him . "
174055	174099	174043	174043	he	135	" Thy father come home ! Why , Jem never said a word of it ! And ailing too ! I 'll go in , and cheer him with a bit of talk . I ne'er knew any good come of delegating it . "
174100	174136	174138	174138	she	124	" Oh , Job ! father can not stand — father is too ill . Do n't come ; not but that you 're very kind and good ; but to - night — indeed , "
174155	174236	174138	174138	she	124	" you must not come till I send or come for you . Father 's in that strange way , I ca n't answer for it if he sees strangers . Please do n't come . I 'll come and tell you every day how he goes on . I must be off now to see after him . Dear Job ! kind Job ! do n't be angry with me . If you knew all you 'd pity me . "
174971	174980	174982	174982	he	128	" Mother does so want to see you , "
174984	174998	174982	174982	he	128	" Can you come to see her to - morrow ? or when ? "
174999	175005	175007	175007	she	124	" I can not tell , "
175011	175034	175007	175007	she	124	" Not yet . Wait awhile ; perhaps only a little while . Dear Jem , I must go to him,—dearest Jem . "
175168	175200	175201	175201	She	124	" Well , Mary Barton ! You 're home at last ! I heard you 'd getten home ; so I thought I 'd just step over and hear the news . "
175288	175335	175336	175336	Mary	124	" So the old governor is back again , eh ? And what does he say to all your fine doings at Liverpool , and before?—you and I know where . You ca n't hide it now , Mary , for it 's all in print . "
175463	175558	175431	175431	She	139	" Nay ! there 's no use shunning talking it over . Why ! it was in the Guardian,—and the Courier,—and some one told Jane Hodson it was even copied into a London paper . You 've set up heroine on your own account , Mary Barton . How did you like standing witness ? Ar'n't them lawyers impudent things ? staring at one so . I 'll be bound you wished you 'd taken my offer , and borrowed my black watered scarf ! Now did n't you , Mary ? Speak truth ! "
175559	175577	175579	175579	she	4375	" To tell truth , I never thought about it then , Sally . How could I ? "
175583	175646	175579	175579	she	4375	" Oh — I forgot . You were all for that stupid James Wilson . Well ! if I 've ever the luck to go witness on a trial , see if I do n't pick up a better beau than the prisoner . I 'll aim at a lawyer 's clerk , but I 'll not take less than a turnkey . "
175685	175730	175431	175431	She	139	" I 'd no thought to be looking out for beaux , I can assure you , Sally.—But do n't let us talk any more about it ; I ca n't bear to think on it . How is Miss Simmonds ? and everybody ? "
175731	175815	175653	175653	she	124	" Oh , very well ; and by the way she gave me a bit of a message for you . You may come back to work if you 'll behave yourself , she says . I told you she 'd be glad to have you back , after all this piece of business , by way of tempting people to come to her shop . They 'd come from Salford to have a peep at you , for six months at least . "
175816	175841	175842	175842	she	4377	" Do n't talk so ; I can not come , I can never face Miss Simmonds again . And even if I could — "
175848	175886	175842	175842	she	4377	" Ay ! I know what you 're thinking on . But that will not be this some time , as he 's turned off from the foundry,—you'd better think twice afore refusing Miss Simmonds ' offer . "
175887	175896	175898	175898	Mary	124	" Turned off from the foundry ! Jem ? "
175900	175968	175898	175898	Mary	124	" To be sure ! did n't you know it ? Decent men were not going to work with a — no ! I suppose I must n't say it , seeing you went to such trouble to get up an alibi ; not that I should think much the worse of a spirited young fellow for falling foul of a rival,—they always do at the theatre . "
176001	176008	176009	176009	she	124	" Tell me all about it , "
176013	176029	176031	176031	Sally	139	" Why , you see , they 've always swords quite handy at them plays , "
176046	176056	176034	176034	Mary	124	" About Jem,—about Jem , I want to know . "
176057	176126	176041	176041	her	124	" Oh ! I do n't pretend to know more than is in every one 's mouth : he 's turned away from the foundry , because folks do n't think you 've cleared him outright of the murder ; though perhaps the jury were loth to hang him . Old Mr. Carson is savage against judge and jury , and lawyers and all , as I heard . "
176127	176140	176142	176142	Mary	124	" I must go to him , I must go to him , "
176149	176168	176170	176170	Sally	139	" He 'll tell you all I 've said is true , and not a word of lie , "
176172	176196	176197	176197	Mary	124	" So I 'll not give your answer to Miss Simmonds , but leave you to think twice about it . Good afternoon ! "
176315	176329	176310	176310	he	450	" Tell Jem Wilson to come here at eight o'clock to - night . "
176387	176395	176396	176396	he	128	" You 're going to see mother ? "
176411	176429	176396	176396	he	128	" Yes , and you too . Oh , Jem , is it true ? tell me . "
176455	176522	176446	176446	He	128	" Darling , it is ; it 's no use hiding it — if you mean that I 'm no longer to work at Duncombe 's foundry . It 's no time ( to my mind ) to have secrets from each other , though I did not name it yesterday , thinking you might fret . I shall soon get work again , never fear . "
176523	176541	176434	176434	he	128	" But why did they turn you off , when the jury had said you were innocent ? "
176542	176621	176434	176434	he	128	" It was not just to say turned off , though I do n't think I could have well stayed on . A good number of the men managed to let out they should not like to work under me again ; there were some few who knew me well enough to feel I could not have done it , but more were doubtful ; and one spoke to young Mr. Duncombe , hinting at what they thought . "
176622	176630	176632	176632	Mary	124	" Oh Jem ! what a shame ! "
176638	176687	176632	176632	Mary	124	" Nay , darling ! I 'm not for blaming them . Poor fellows like them have nought to stand upon and be proud of but their character , and it 's fitting they should take care of that , and keep that free from soil and taint . "
176688	176708	176434	176434	he	128	" But you,—what could they get but good from you ? They might have known you by this time . "
176709	176774	176632	176632	Mary	124	" So some do ; the overlooker , I 'm sure , would know I 'm innocent . Indeed , he said as much to - day ; and he said he had had some talk with old Mr. Duncombe , and they thought it might be better if I left Manchester for a bit ; they 'd recommend me to some other place . "
176792	176802	176780	176780	her	124	" They might have known thee better , Jem . "
176827	176850	176824	176824	he	128	" Mary , art thou much bound to Manchester ? Would it grieve thee sore to quit the old smoke - jack ? "
176851	176855	176856	176856	she	124	" With thee ? "
176866	176915	176856	176856	she	124	" Ay , lass ! Trust me , I 'll ne'er ask thee to leave Manchester while I 'm in it . Because I 've heard fine things of Canada ; and our overlooker has a cousin in the foundry line there.—Thou knowest where Canada is , Mary ? "
176916	176931	176932	176932	her	124	" Not rightly — not now , at any rate;—but with thee , Jem , "
176942	176945	176932	176932	her	124	" anywhere — "
176955	176959	176961	176961	Mary	124	" But father ! "
177001	177040	177049	177049	he	450	" Oh , Jem , did I tell you?—Father sent word he wished to speak with you . I was to bid you come to him at eight to - night . What can he want , Jem ? "
177041	177047	177049	177049	he	450	" I can not tell , "
177051	177068	177069	177069	he	450	" At any rate I 'll go . It 's no use troubling ourselves to guess , "
177106	177146	177148	177148	he	450	" Come and see mother , and then I 'll take thee home , Mary . Thou wert all in a tremble when first I came up with thee ; thou'rt not fit to be trusted home by thyself , "
177231	177251	177253	177253	they	4386	" Come and speak to mother ; she knows you 're to be her daughter , Mary , darling . "
177383	177387	177408	177409	Mrs. Wilson	114	" stalled ox , "
177560	177581	177554	177554	she	127	" Bless thee , Mary , bless thee ! Only make him happy , and God bless thee for ever ! "
177849	177857	177859	177860	Mr. Carson	167	" And have I heard you aright ? "
177868	177890	177905	177905	he	167	" Man ! have I heard you aright ? Was it you , then , that killed my boy ? my only son?"—(he
177917	177973	177905	177905	he	167	" Do n't dare to think that I shall be merciful , and spare you , because you have come forward to accuse yourself . I tell you I will not spare you the least pang the law can inflict,—you , who did not show pity on my boy , shall have none from me . "
177974	177982	177984	177985	John Barton	110	" I did not ask for any , "
177992	178012	178014	178014	he	167	" Ask , or not ask , what care I ? You shall be hanged — hanged — man ! "
178081	178114	178057	178057	he	110	" As for being hanged , sir , I know it 's all right and proper . I dare say it 's bad enough ; but I tell you what , sir , "
178122	178193	178194	178194	he	167	" if you 'd hanged me the day after I 'd done the deed , I would have gone down on my knees and blessed you . Death ! Lord , what is it to Life ? To such a life as I 've been leading this fortnight past . Life at best is no great thing ; but such a life as I have dragged through since that night , "
178200	178306	178307	178307	He	167	" Why , sir , I 've been on the point of killing myself this many a time to get away from my own thoughts . I did n't ! and I 'll tell you why . I did n't know but that I should be more haunted than ever with the recollection of my sin . Oh ! God above only can tell the agony with which I 've repented me of it , and part perhaps because I feared He would think I were impatient of the misery He sent as punishment — far , far worse misery than any hanging , sir . "
178319	178421	178315	178315	he	167	" Sin ' that day ( it may be very wicked , sir , but it 's the truth ) I 've kept thinking and thinking if I were but in that world where they say God is , He would , may be , teach me right from wrong , even if it were with many stripes . I 've been sore puzzled here . I would go through Hell - fire if I could but get free from sin at last , it 's such an awful thing . As for hanging , that 's just nought at all . "
178449	178456	178458	178458	he	167	" Ay , ay , wench ! "
178461	178471	178458	178458	he	167	" is it thee ? Where 's Jem Wilson ? "
178489	178562	178563	178563	He	110	" Lad ! thou hast borne a deal for me . It 's the meanest thing I ever did to leave thee to bear the brunt . Thou , who wert as innocent of any knowledge of it as the babe unborn . I 'll not bless thee for it . Blessing from such as me would not bring thee any good . Thou'lt love Mary , though she is my child . "
178600	178668	178594	178594	he	167	" You can have no doubt for what purpose I go . Straight to the police - office , to send men to take care of you , wretched man , and your accomplice . To - morrow morning your tale shall be repeated to those who can commit you to gaol , and before long you shall have the opportunity of trying how desirable hanging is . "
178669	178674	178676	178676	Mary	124	" Oh , sir ! "
178690	178761	178685	178686	Mr. Carson	167	" my father is dying . Look at him , sir . If you want Death for Death , you have it . Do n't take him away from me these last hours . He must go alone through Death , but let me be with him as long as I can . Oh , sir ! if you have any mercy in you , leave him here to die . "
178774	178860	178763	178763	himself	110	" Mary , wench ! I owe him summut . I will go die , where , and as he wishes me . Thou hast said true , I am standing side by side with Death ; and it matters little where I spend the bit of time left of Life . That time I must pass in wrestling with my soul for a character to take into the other world . I 'll go where you see fit , sir . He 's innocent , "
178873	178883	178885	178886	Job Legh	135	" Never fear ! They can not touch him , "
178941	178959	178918	178919	John Barton	110	" Sir , one word ! My hairs are gray with suffering , and yours with years — "
178960	178968	178970	178971	Mr. Carson	167	" And have I had no suffering ? "
179009	179154	179156	179158	the old man	2773	" Have I had no inward suffering to blanch these hairs ? Have not I toiled and struggled even to these years with hopes in my heart that all centered in my boy ? I did not speak of them , but were they not there ? I seemed hard and cold ; and so I might be to others , but not to him!—who shall ever imagine the love I bore to him ? Even he never dreamed how my heart leapt up at the sound of his footstep , and how precious he was to his poor old father.—And he is gone — killed — out of the hearing of all loving words — out of my sight for ever . He was my sunshine , and now it is night ! Oh , my God ! comfort me , comfort me ! "
179664	179687	179689	179689	he	110	" I did not know what I was doing , Job Legh ; God knows I did n't ! Oh , sir ! "
179701	179744	179660	179660	he	110	" say you forgive me the anguish I now see I have caused you . I care not for pain , or death , you know I do n't ; but oh , man ! forgive me the trespass I have done ! "
179745	179759	179761	179761	Job	135	" Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us , "
179809	179828	179785	179786	Mr. Carson	167	" Let my trespasses be unforgiven , so that I may have vengeance for my son 's murder . "
180046	180065	180066	180066	He	167	" Let my trespasses be unforgiven , so that I may have vengeance for my son 's murder . "
180415	180447	180402	180403	Mr. Carson	167	" You naughty little rascal ! I 'll give you to a policeman , that I will ! Do you see how you 've hurt the little girl ? Do you ? "
180506	180511	180504	180504	she	6231	" a wholesome impression . "
180541	180599	180523	180526	the little sweet face	4473	" Please , dear nurse , I 'm not much hurt ; it was very silly to cry , you know . He did not mean to do it . He did not know what he was doing , did you , little boy ? Nurse wo n't call a policeman , so do n't be frightened . "
180625	180629	180659	180662	a passer - by	389	" make peace . "
180630	180657	180659	180662	a passer - by	389	" That lad will mind , and be more gentle for the time to come , I 'll be bound , thanks to that little lady , "
180728	180738	180739	180739	He	167	" I did not know what I was doing . "
181158	181166	181123	181126	the brethren of mankind	4492	" They know not what they do . "
181362	181664	181354	181354	he	110	" You see I 've so often been hankering after the right way ; and it 's a hard one for a poor man to find . At least it 's been so to me . No one learned me , and no one telled me . When I was a little chap they taught me to read , and then they ne'er gave me no books ; only I heard say the Bible was a good book . So when I grew thoughtful , and puzzled , I took to it . But you 'd never believe black was black , or night was night , when you saw all about you acting as if black was white , and night was day . It 's not much I can say for myself in t'other world , God forgive me ; but I can say this , I would fain have gone after the Bible rules if I 'd seen folk credit it ; they all spoke up for it , and went and did clean contrary . In those days I would ha ' gone about wi ' my Bible , like a little child , my finger in th ' place , and asking the meaning of this or that text , and no one told me . Then I took out two or three texts as clear as glass , and I tried to do what they bid me do . But I do n't know how it was ; masters and men , all alike cared no more for minding those texts , than I did for th ' Lord Mayor of London ; so I grew to think it must be a sham put upon poor ignorant folk , women , and such - like . "
181763	181776	181751	181751	I'm	0	" Then again he spoke , after some minutes of hushed silence . "
181862	181921	181924	181924	he	4511	" At last I gave it up in despair , trying to make folks ' actions square wi ' th ' Bible ; and I thought I 'd no longer labour at following th ' Bible mysel . I 've said all this afore , may be . But from that time I 've dropped down , down,—down . "
181931	181949	181924	181924	he	4511	" I did not think he 'd been such an old man,—Oh ! that he had but forgiven me,"—and
182165	182170	182172	182172	Mary	124	" Pray for us , "
182214	182233	182241	182242	John Barton	110	" God be merciful to us sinners.—Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us . "
182284	182286	182293	182293	Job	135	" settle "
182328	182342	182317	182317	Job	135	" God has heard that man 's prayer . He has comforted him . "
182930	182944	182919	182919	he	128	" Well , Jem , he 's gone at last , is he ? "
182945	182955	182987	182987	she	666	" Yes . How did you hear , mother ? "
182956	182982	182919	182919	he	128	" Oh , Job came over here and telled me , on his way to the undertaker 's . Did he make a fine end ? "
183212	183215	183216	183216	she	666	" Jem ! "
183220	183334	183216	183216	she	666	" thou might'st just as well never be at a death - bed again , if thou can not bring off more news about it ; here have I been by mysel all day ( except when oud Job came in ) , but thinks I , when Jem comes he 'll be sure to be good company , seeing he was in the house at the very time of the death ; and here thou art , without a word to throw at a dog , much less thy mother : it 's no use thy going to a death - bed if thou can not carry away any of the sayings ! "
183335	183344	183346	183346	Jem	128	" He did not make any , mother , "
183348	183383	183346	183346	Jem	128	" Well , to be sure ! So fond as he used to be of holding forth , to miss such a fine opportunity that will never come again ! Did he die easy ? "
183384	183393	183395	183395	Jem	128	" He was very restless all night long , "
183406	183490	183395	183395	Jem	128	" And in course thou plucked the pillow away ? Thou didst not ! Well ! with thy bringing up , and thy learning , thou might'st have known that were the only help in such a case . There were pigeons ' feathers in the pillow , depend on't . To think of two grown - up folk like you and Mary , not knowing death could never come easy to a person lying on a pillow with pigeons ' feathers in ! "
183683	183688	183690	183690	Jem	128	" It is hard , "
183705	183797	183692	183692	himself	128	" that let a man 's life be what it may , folk are so ready to credit the first word against him . I could live it down if I stayed in England ; but then what would not Mary have to bear ? Sooner or later the truth would out ; and then she would be a show to folk for many a day as John Barton 's daughter . Well ! God does not judge as hardly as man , that 's one comfort for all of us ! "
183841	183927	183826	183826	he	241	" We have been written to by government , as I think I told you before , to recommend an intelligent man , well acquainted with mechanics , as instrument - maker to the Agricultural College they are establishing at Toronto , in Canada . It is a comfortable appointment,—house,—land,—and a good per - centage on the instruments made . I will show you the particulars if I can lay my hand on the letter , which I believe I must have left at home . "
183928	183967	183692	183692	himself	128	" Thank you , sir . No need for seeing the letter to say I 'll accept it . I must leave Manchester ; and I 'd as lief quit England at once when I 'm about it . "
183968	184006	183826	183826	he	241	" Of course government will give you your passage ; indeed , I believe an allowance would be made for a family if you had one ; but you are not a married man , I believe ? "
184007	184014	183692	183692	himself	128	" No , sir , but — "
184028	184031	184033	184034	Mr. Duncombe	241	" But — "
184038	184058	184033	184034	Mr. Duncombe	241	" you would like to be a married man before you go , I suppose ; eh , Wilson ? "
184059	184095	183826	183826	he	241	" If you please , sir . And there 's my mother , too . I hope she 'll go with us . But I can pay her passage ; no need to trouble government . "
184096	184188	184189	184189	Jem	128	" Nay , nay ! I 'll write to - day and recommend you ; and say that you have a family of two . They 'll never ask if the family goes upwards or downwards . I shall see you again before you sail , I hope , Wilson ; though I believe they 'll not allow you long to wait . Come to my house next time ; you 'll find it pleasanter , I daresay . These men are so wrong - headed . Keep up your heart ! "
184260	184267	184269	184269	she	136	" Grandfather wants to see you ! "
184276	184284	184286	184286	Jem	128	" And I want to see him , "
184336	184346	184348	184348	Job	135	" I 've getten a note from Mr. Carson , "
184355	184382	184384	184384	he	2773	" and man - alive , he wants to see thee and me ! For sure , there 's no more mischief up , is there ? "
184426	184440	184442	184442	he	2773	" I ca n't guess what he 's wanting , poor old chap , "
184444	184473	184442	184442	he	2773	" May be there 's some point he 's not yet satisfied on ; may be — but it 's no use guessing ; let 's be off . "
184474	184526	184384	184384	he	2773	" It would n't be better for thee to be scarce a bit , would it , and leave me to go and find out what 's up ? He has , perhaps , getten some crotchet into his head thou'rt an accomplice , and is laying a trap for thee . "
184527	184533	184535	184535	Jem	128	" I 'm not afeared ! "
184537	184626	184535	184535	Jem	128	" I 've done nought wrong , and know nought wrong , about yon poor dead lad ; though I 'll own I had evil thoughts once on a time . Folk ca n't mistake long if once they 'll search into the truth . I 'll go and give the old gentleman all the satisfaction in my power , now it can injure no one . I 'd my own reasons for wanting to see him besides , and it all falls in right enough for me . "
184790	184813	184764	184771	many a little want in days of childhood,—and	4564	" Oh , he 's gone — he 's dead — all gone — all dead , and I am left alone ! "
184814	184823	184825	184826	Jane Wilson	127	" Poor wench ! poor , poor wench ! "
184832	184970	184825	184826	Jane Wilson	127	" Thou'rt not alone , so donnot take on so . I 'll say nought of Him who 's above , for thou know'st He is ever the orphan 's friend ; but think on Jem ! nay , Mary , dear , think on me ! I 'm but a frabbit woman at times , but I 've a heart within me through all my temper , and thou shalt be as a daughter henceforward,—as mine own ewe - lamb . Jem shall not love thee better in his way , than I will in mine ; and thou'lt bear with my turns , Mary , knowing that in my soul God sees the love that shall ever be thine , if thou'lt take me for thy mother , and speak no more of being alone . "
186414	186425	186427	186427	he	167	" I have been calling on Mr. Bridgenorth this morning , "
186432	186536	186427	186427	he	167	" as I expected , he can give me but little satisfaction on some points respecting the occurrence on the 18th of last month which I desire to have cleared up . Perhaps you two can tell me what I want to know . As intimate friends of Barton 's you probably know , or can conjecture a good deal . Have no scruple as to speaking the truth . What you say in this room shall never be named again by me . Besides , you are aware that the law allows no one to be tried twice for the same offence . "
186570	186649	186562	186563	Job Legh	135	" I 'm not going to be affronted either for myself or Jem at what you 've just now been saying about the truth . You do n't know us , and there 's an end on't ; only it 's as well for folk to think others good and true until they 're proved contrary . Ask what you like , sir , I 'll answer for it we 'll either tell truth or hold our tongues . "
186650	186656	186658	186659	Mr. Carson	167	" I beg your pardon , "
186666	186674	186663	186663	his	167	" What I wished to know was , "
186701	186727	186663	186663	his	167	" whether you , Wilson , can explain how Barton came possessed of your gun . I believe you refused this explanation to Mr. Bridgenorth . "
186728	186827	186828	186828	Jem	128	" I did , sir ! If I had said what I knew then , I saw it would criminate Barton , and so I refused telling aught . To you , sir , now I will tell every thing and any thing ; only it is but little . The gun was my father 's before it was mine , and long ago he and John Barton had a fancy for shooting at the gallery ; and they used always to take this gun , and brag that though it was old - fashioned it was sure . "
186869	187008	186864	186864	Jem	128	" One day in the week — I think it was on the Wednesday,—yes , it was,—it was on St. Patrick 's day , I met John just coming out of our house , as I were going to my dinner . Mother was out , and he 'd found no one in . He said he 'd come to borrow the old gun , and that he 'd have made bold , and taken it , but it was not to be seen . Mother was afraid of it , so after father 's death ( for while he were alive , she seemed to think he could manage it ) I had carried it to my own room . I went up and fetched it for John , who stood outside the door all the time . "
187009	187019	187021	187022	Mr. Carson	167	" What did he say he wanted it for ? "
187026	187071	187021	187022	Mr. Carson	167	" I do n't think he spoke when I gave it him . At first he muttered something about the shooting - gallery , and I never doubted but that it were for practice there , as I knew he had done years before . "
187131	187209	187210	187210	Jem	128	" I never knew for what he wanted the gun till I was taken up,—I do not know yet why he wanted it . No one would have had me get out of the scrape by implicating an old friend,—my father 's old friend , and the father of the girl I loved . So I refused to tell Mr. Bridgenorth aught about it , and would not have named it now to any one but you . "
187270	187289	187264	187264	he	167	" You were in the room the whole time while Barton was speaking to me , I think ? "
187290	187295	187297	187297	Job	135	" Yes , sir , "
187299	187349	187297	187297	Job	135	" You 'll excuse my asking plain and direct questions ; the information I am gaining is really a relief to my mind , I do n't know how , but it is,—will you tell me if you had any idea of Barton 's guilt in this matter before ? "
187350	187359	187361	187361	Job	135	" None whatever , so help me God ! "
187365	187439	187361	187361	Job	135	" To tell truth ( and axing your forgiveness , Jem ) , I had never got quite shut of the notion that Jem here had done it . At times I was as clear of his innocence as I was of my own ; and whenever I took to reasoning about it , I saw he could not have been the man that did it . Still I never thought of Barton . "
187440	187455	187457	187458	Mr. Carson	167	" And yet by his confession he must have been absent at the time , "
187467	187562	187457	187458	Mr. Carson	167	" Ay , and for many a day after,—I ca n't rightly say how long . But still , you see , one 's often blind to many a thing that lies right under one 's nose , till it 's pointed out . And till I heard what John Barton had to say yon night , I could not have seen what reason he had for doing it ; while in the case of Jem , any one who looked at Mary Barton might have seen a cause for jealousy , clear enough . "
187563	187579	187580	187580	he	167	" Then you believe that Barton had no knowledge of my son 's unfortunate , — "
187585	187607	187580	187580	he	167	" of his attentions to Mary Barton . This young man , Wilson , had heard of them , you see . "
187608	187627	187629	187629	Jem	128	" The person who told me said clearly she neither had , nor would tell Mary 's father , "
187631	187660	187629	187629	Jem	128	" I do n't believe he 'd ever heard of it ; he were n't a man to keep still in such a matter , if he had . "
187661	187664	187666	187666	Job	135	" Besides , "
187668	187694	187666	187666	Job	135	" the reason he gave on his death - bed , so to speak , was enough ; ' specially to those who knew him . "
187695	187734	187629	187629	Jem	128	" You mean his feelings regarding the treatment of the workmen by the masters ; you think he acted from motives of revenge , in consequence of the part my son had taken in putting down the strike ? "
187735	187740	187742	187742	Job	135	" Well , sir , "
187744	187819	187742	187742	Job	135	" it 's hard to say : John Barton was not a man to take counsel with people ; nor did he make many words about his doings . So I can only judge from his way of thinking and talking in general , never having heard him breathe a syllable concerning this matter in particular . You see he were sadly put about to make great riches and great poverty square with Christ 's Gospel"—Job
187874	187896	187870	187871	Mr. Carson	167	" You mean he was an Owenite ; all for equality and community of goods , and that kind of absurdity . "
187897	188168	187870	187871	Mr. Carson	167	" No , no ! John Barton was no fool . No need to tell him that were all men equal to - night , some would get the start by rising an hour earlier to - morrow . Nor yet did he care for goods , nor wealth — no man less , so that he could get daily bread for him and his ; but what hurt him sore , and rankled in him as long as I knew him ( and , sir , it rankles in many a poor man 's heart far more than the want of any creature - comforts , and puts a sting into starvation itself ) , was that those who wore finer clothes , and eat better food , and had more money in their pockets , kept him at arm 's length , and cared not whether his heart was sorry or glad ; whether he lived or died,—whether he was bound for heaven or hell . It seemed hard to him that a heap of gold should part him and his brother so far asunder . For he was a loving man before he grew mad with seeing such as he was slighted , as if Christ Himself had not been poor . At one time , I 've heard him say , he felt kindly towards every man , rich or poor , because he thought they were all men alike . But latterly he grew aggravated with the sorrows and suffering that he saw , and which he thought the masters might help if they would . "
188169	188181	188183	188184	Mr. Carson	167	" That 's the notion you 've all of you got , "
188186	188246	188183	188184	Mr. Carson	167	" Now , how in the world can we help it ? We can not regulate the demand for labour . No man or set of men can do it . It depends on events which God alone can control . When there is no market for our goods , we suffer just as much as you can do . "
188247	188432	187870	187871	Mr. Carson	167	" Not as much , I 'm sure , sir ; though I 'm not given to Political Economy , I know that much . I 'm wanting in learning , I 'm aware ; but I can use my eyes . I never see the masters getting thin and haggard for want of food ; I hardly ever see them making much change in their way of living , though I do n't doubt they 've got to do it in bad times . But it 's in things for show they cut short ; while for such as me , it 's in things for life we 've to stint . For sure , sir , you 'll own it 's come to a hard pass when a man would give aught in the world for work to keep his children from starving , and ca n't get a bit , if he 's ever so willing to labour . I 'm not up to talking as John Barton would have done , but that 's clear to me at any rate . "
188433	188545	188183	188184	Mr. Carson	167	" My good man , just listen to me . Two men live in solitude ; one produces loaves of bread , the other coats,—or what you will . Now , would it not be hard if the bread - producer were forced to give bread for the coats , whether he wanted them or not , in order to furnish employment to the other ? That is the simple form of the case ; you 've only to multiply the numbers . There will come times of great changes in the occupation of thousands , when improvements in manufactures and machinery are made.—It 's all nonsense talking,—it must be so ! "
188553	188759	188546	188547	Job Legh	135	" It 's true it was a sore time for the hand - loom weavers when power - looms came in : them new - fangled things make a man 's life like a lottery ; and yet I 'll never misdoubt that power - looms , and railways , and all such - like inventions , are the gifts of God . I have lived long enough , too , to see that it is part of His plan to send suffering to bring out a higher good ; but surely it 's also part of His plan that as much of the burden of the suffering as can be , should be lightened by those whom it is His pleasure to make happy , and content in their own circumstances . Of course it would take a deal more thought and wisdom than me , or any other man has , to settle out of hand how this should be done . But I 'm clear about this , when God gives a blessing to be enjoyed , He gives it with a duty to be done ; and the duty of the happy is to help the suffering to bear their woe . "
188760	188789	188791	188792	Mr. Carson	167	" Still , facts have proved and are daily proving how much better it is for every man to be independent of help , and self - reliant , "
188796	188988	188791	188792	Mr. Carson	167	" You can never work facts as you would fixed quantities , and say , given two facts , and the product is so and so . God has given men feelings and passions which can not be worked into the problem , because they are for ever changing and uncertain . God has also made some weak ; not in any one way , but in all . One is weak in body , another in mind , another in steadiness of purpose , a fourth ca n't tell right from wrong , and so on ; or if he can tell the right , he wants strength to hold by it . Now to my thinking , them that is strong in any of God 's gifts is meant to help the weak,—be hanged to the facts ! I ask your pardon , sir ; I ca n't rightly explain the meaning that is in me . I 'm like a tap as wo n't run , but keeps letting it out drop by drop , so that you 've no notion of the force of what 's within . "
189015	189026	189028	189029	Mr. Carson	167	" What you say is very true , no doubt , "
189031	189049	189051	189051	he	167	" but how would you bring it to bear upon the masters ' conduct,—on my particular case ? "
189055	189240	189051	189051	he	167	" I 'm not learned enough to argue . Thoughts come into my head that I 'm sure are as true as Gospel , though may be they do n't follow each other like the Q. E. D. of a Proposition . The masters has it on their own conscience,—you have it on yours , sir , to answer for to God whether you 've done , and are doing all in your power to lighten the evils that seem always to hang on the trades by which you make your fortunes . It 's no business of mine , thank God . John Barton took the question in hand , and his answer to it was no ! Then he grew bitter , and angry , and mad ; and in his madness he did a great sin , and wrought a great woe ; and repented him with tears as of blood ; and will go through his penance humbly and meekly in t'other place , I 'll be bound . I never seed such bitter repentance as his that last night . "
189291	189339	189282	189282	he	167	" Thank you both for coming,—and for speaking candidly to me . I fear , Legh , neither you nor I have convinced each other , as to the power , or want of power , in the masters to remedy the evils the men complain of . "
189340	189689	189690	189690	Jem	128	" I 'm loth to vex you , sir , just now ; but it was not the want of power I was talking on ; what we all feel sharpest is the want of inclination to try and help the evils which come like blights at times over the manufacturing places , while we see the masters can stop work and not suffer . If we saw the masters try for our sakes to find a remedy,—even if they were long about it,—even if they could find no help , and at the end of all could only say , ' Poor fellows , our hearts are sore for ye ; we 've done all we could , and ca n't find a cure,'—we'd bear up like men through bad times . No one knows till they 've tried , what power of bearing lies in them , if once they believe that men are caring for their sorrows and will help if they can . If fellow - creatures can give nought but tears and brave words , we take our trials straight from God , and we know enough of His love to put ourselves blind into His hands . You say our talk has done no good . I say it has . I see the view you take of things from the place where you stand . I can remember that , when the time comes for judging you ; I sha'n't think any longer , does he act right on my views of a thing , but does he act right on his own . It has done me good in that way . I 'm an old man , and may never see you again ; but I 'll pray for you , and think on you and your trials , both of your great wealth , and of your son 's cruel death , many and many a day to come ; and I 'll ask God to bless both to you now and for evermore . Amen . Farewell ! "
190431	190529	190417	190417	she	114	" To be sure ' Merica is a long way to flit to ; beyond London a good bit I reckon ; and quite in foreign parts ; but I 've never had no opinion of England , ever since they could be such fools as take up a quiet chap like thee , and clap thee in prison . Where you go , I 'll go . Perhaps in them Indian countries they 'll know a well - behaved lad when they see him ; ne'er speak a word more , lad , I 'll go . "
190563	190566	190568	190568	Mary	124	" Jem ! "
190599	190623	190624	190624	She	124	" Jem ! you 've never yet told me how you came to know about my naughty ways with poor young Mr. Carson . "
190647	190664	190624	190624	She	124	" Darling , I 'm almost loth to tell you ; your aunt Esther told me . "
190665	190705	190706	190706	Mary	124	" Ah , I remember ! but how did she know ? I was so put about that night I did not think of asking her . Where did you see her ? I 've forgotten where she lives . "
190743	190774	190740	190740	he	128	" Where did you see Esther lately ? When ? Tell me , love , for you 've never named it before , and I ca n't make it out . "
190775	190789	190791	190791	she	124	" Oh ! it was that horrible night which is like a dream . "
190803	190825	190791	190791	she	124	" We must go and see her before we leave , though I do n't rightly know where to find her . "
190826	190831	190869	190869	his	128	" Dearest Mary , — "
190832	190837	190839	190839	she	124	" What , Jem ? "
190846	190865	190839	190839	she	124	" Your poor aunt Esther has no home:—she 's one of them miserable creatures that walk the streets . "
190898	190903	190905	190905	she	124	" Jem , lad ! "
190909	190920	190905	190905	she	124	" we must find her out,—we must hunt her up ! "
190935	190943	190945	190945	he	128	" What could we do , darling ? "
190951	191032	190945	190945	he	128	" Do ! Why ! what could we not do , if we could but find her ? She 's none so happy in her ways , think ye , but what she 'd turn from them , if any one would lend her a helping hand . Do n't hold me , Jem ; this is just the time for such as her to be out , and who knows but what I might find her close at hand . "
191033	191116	190905	190905	she	124	" Stay , Mary , for a minute ; I 'll go out now and search for her if you wish , though it 's but a wild chase . You must not go . It would be better to ask the police to - morrow . But if I should find her , how can I make her come with me ? Once before she refused , and said she could not break off her drinking ways , come what might ? "
191117	191129	191131	191131	Mary	124	" You never will persuade her if you fear and doubt , "
191136	191177	191131	191131	Mary	124	" Hope yourself , and trust to the good that must be in her . Speak to that,—she has it in her yet,—oh , bring her home , and we will love her so , we 'll make her good . "
191178	191181	191183	191183	Jem	128	" Yes ! "
191191	191249	191251	191251	he	128	" she shall go to America with us ; and we 'll help her to get rid of her sins . I 'll go now , my precious darling , and if I ca n't find her , it 's but trying the police to - morrow . Take care of your own sweet self , Mary , "
191310	191313	191286	191287	the police	2352	" Butterfly , "
191408	191416	191418	191418	she	5520	" I know the Butterfly was here , "
191423	191569	191418	191418	she	5520	" She came in , the night before last , and said she had not a penny to get a place for shelter ; and that if she was far away in the country she could steal aside and die in a copse , or a clough , like the wild animals ; but here the police would let no one alone in the streets , and she wanted a spot to die in , in peace . It 's a queer sort of peace we have here , but that night the room was uncommon empty , and I 'm not a hard - hearted woman ( I wish I were , I could ha ' made a good thing out of it afore this if I were harder ) , so I sent her up,—but she 's not here now , I think . "
191570	191576	191578	191578	Jem	128	" Was she very bad ? "
191580	191598	191599	191599	They	4639	" Ay ! nought but skin and bone , with a cough to tear her in two . "
191928	191933	191935	191935	they	753	" It is Esther ! "
192146	192154	192156	192156	she	4650	" Has it been a dream then ? "

192516	192532	192460	192461	his grandmother	4665	" Why , some good news . Come , give a guess what it is . "
192533	192544	192546	192546	Mary	124	" Oh , tell me ! I can not guess , "
