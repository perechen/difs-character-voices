2650	2663	2668	2669	the coachman	563	" Why , every inn on the road would be shut up ! "
2833	2836	2817	2817	he	563	" turned up "
6018	6026	6027	6027	she	145	" Of course he will be altered ! "
6164	6167	6162	6162	herself	145	" Mother ! "
6304	6316	6295	6295	he	878	" You would not have known me , eh , mother ? "
6414	6430	6411	6411	she	145	" Everything is changed , Harold . I am an old woman , you see . "
6431	6444	6446	6446	Harold	145	" But straighter and more upright than some of the young ones ! "
6466	6495	6411	6411	she	145	" The old women at Smyrna are like sacks . You 've not got clumsy and shapeless . How is it I have the trick of getting fat ? "
6510	6531	6411	6411	she	145	" I remember my father was as thin as a herring . How is my father ? Where is he ? "
6859	6913	6856	6856	he	853	" Gad ! what a wreck poor father is ! Paralysis , eh ? Terribly shrunk and shaken — crawls about among his books and beetles as usual , though . Well , it 's a slow and easy death . But he 's not much over sixty - five , is he ? "
6914	6933	6935	6936	Mrs Transome	145	" Sixty - seven , counting by birthdays ; but your father was born old , I think , "
6979	7001	6967	6967	his	853	" But your little boy , Harold — where is he ? How is it he has not come with you ? "
7002	7013	7015	7015	Harold	145	" O , I left him behind , in town , "
7023	7065	7015	7015	Harold	145	" My man Dominic will bring him , with the rest of the luggage . Ah , I see it is young Debarry , and not my old friend Sir Maximus , who is offering himself as candidate for North Loamshire . "
7066	7103	6967	6967	his	853	" Yes . You did not answer me when I wrote to you to London about your standing . There is no other Tory candidate spoken of , and you would have all the Debarry interest . "
7104	7110	7112	7112	Harold	145	" I hardly think that , "
7116	7132	7112	7112	Harold	145	" Why ? Jermyn says a Tory candidate can never be got in without it . "
7133	7143	6967	6967	his	853	" But I shall not be a Tory candidate . "
7153	7157	7158	7158	she	145	" What then ? "
7164	7173	7158	7158	she	145	" You will not call yourself a Whig ? "
7174	7183	6967	6967	his	853	" God forbid ! I 'm a Radical . "
7384	7407	7435	7435	his	151	" Will you go to your rooms , Harold , and see if there is anything you would like to have altered ? "
7408	7415	7417	7417	Harold	145	" Yes , let us go , "
7446	7458	7459	7459	he	151	" Uncle Lingon is on the bench still , I see , "
7471	7484	7459	7459	he	151	" is he at home — will he be here this evening ? "
7485	7548	7459	7459	he	151	" He says you must go to the Rectory when you want to see him . You must remember you have come back to a family who have old - fashioned notions . Your uncle thought I ought to have you to myself in the first hour or two . He remembered that I had not seen my son for fifteen years . "
7549	7562	7564	7564	Harold	145	" Ah , by Jove ! fifteen years — so it is ! "
7591	7616	7579	7579	he	919	" And you are as straight as an arrow still ; you will carry the shawls I have brought you as well as ever . "
7734	7745	7747	7748	Mrs Transome	145	" I have given you the south rooms , Harold , "
7767	7798	7747	7748	Mrs Transome	145	" I thought they would suit you best , as they all open into each other , and this middle one will make a pleasant sitting - room for you . "
7799	7810	7812	7812	Harold	145	" Gad ! the furniture is in a bad state , "
7826	7839	7812	7812	Harold	145	" the moths seem to have got into the carpets and hangings . "
7840	7854	7856	7857	Mrs Transome	145	" I had no choice except moths or tenants who would pay rent , "
7859	7872	7856	7857	Mrs Transome	145	" We have been too poor to keep servants for uninhabited rooms . "
7873	7884	7812	7812	Harold	145	" What ! you 've been rather pinched , eh ? "
7885	7899	7812	7812	Harold	145	" You find us living as we have been living these twelve years . "
7900	7981	7856	7857	Mrs Transome	145	" Ah , you 've had Durfey 's debts as well as the lawsuits — confound them ! It will make a hole in sixty thousand pounds to pay off the mortgages . However , he 's gone now , poor fellow ; and I suppose I should have spent more in buying an English estate some time or other . I always meant to be an Englishman , and thrash a lord or two who thrashed me at Eton . "
7982	8004	7812	7812	Harold	145	" I hardly thought you could have meant that , Harold , when I found you had married a foreign wife . "
8005	8057	7856	7857	Mrs Transome	145	" Would you have had me wait for a consumptive lackadaisical Englishwoman , who would have hung all her relations round my neck ? I hate English wives ; they want to give their opinion about everything . They interfere with a man 's life . I shall not marry again . "
8107	8135	8104	8104	she	145	" I suppose you have been used to great luxury ; these rooms look miserable to you , but you can soon make any alteration you like . "
8136	8164	8165	8165	he	853	" O , I must have a private sitting - room fitted up for myself down - stairs . And the rest are bedrooms , I suppose , "
8175	8222	8104	8104	she	145	" Ah , I can sleep here a night or two . But there 's a bedroom down - stairs , with an anteroom , I remember , that would do for my man Dominic and the little boy . I should like to have that . "
8223	8258	8104	8104	she	145	" Your father has slept there for years . He will be like a distracted insect , and never know where to go , if you alter the track he has to walk in . "
8259	8272	8104	8104	she	145	" That 's a pity . I hate going up - stairs . "
8273	8309	8104	8104	she	145	" There is the steward 's room : it is not used , and might be turned into a bedroom . I ca n't offer you my room , for I sleep up - stairs . "
8334	8453	8104	8104	she	145	" No ; I 'm determined not to sleep up - stairs . We 'll see about the steward 's room to - morrow , and I daresay I shall find a closet of some sort for Dominic . It 's a nuisance he had to stay behind , for I shall have nobody to cook for me . Ah , there 's the old river I used to fish in . I often thought , when I was at Smyrna , that I would buy a park with a river through it as much like the Lapp as possible . Gad , what fine oaks those are opposite ! Some of them must come down , though . "
8454	8511	8104	8104	she	145	" I 've held every tree sacred on the demesne , as I told you , Harold . I trusted to your getting the estate some time , and releasing it ; and I determined to keep it worth releasing . A park without fine timber is no better than a beauty without teeth and hair . "
8512	8517	8519	8519	Harold	145	" Bravo , mother ! "
8528	8575	8519	8519	Harold	145	" Ah , you 've had to worry yourself about things that do n't properly belong to a woman — my father being weakly . We 'll set all that right . You shall have nothing to do now but to be grandmamma on satin cushions . "
8576	8635	8522	8522	his	929	" You must excuse me from the satin cushions . That is a part of the old woman 's duty I am not prepared for . I am used to be chief bailiff , and to sit in the saddle two or three hours every day . There are two farms on our hands besides the Home Farm . "
8636	8656	8658	8658	Harold	145	" Phew - ew ! Jermyn manages the estate badly then . That will not last under my reign , "
8682	8694	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" Perhaps when you 've been in England a little longer , "
8708	8724	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" you will understand better the difficulty there is in letting farms in these times . "
8725	8793	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" I understand the difficulty perfectly , mother . To let farms , a man must have the sense to see what will make them inviting to farmers , and to get sense supplied on demand is just the most difficult transaction I know of . I suppose if I ring there 's some fellow who can act as valet and learn to attend to my hookah ? "
8794	8824	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" There is Hickes the butler , and there is Jabez the footman ; those are all the men in the house . They were here when you left . "
8825	8875	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" O , I remember Jabez — he was a dolt . I 'll have old Hickes . He was a neat little machine of a butler ; his words used to come like the clicks of an engine . He must be an old machine now , though . "
8876	8890	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" You seem to remember some things about home wonderfully well , Harold . "
8891	8950	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" Never forget places and people — how they look and what can be done with them . All the country round here lies like a map in my brain . A deuced pretty country too ; but the people were a stupid set of old Whigs and Tories . I suppose they are much as they were . "
8951	9008	8696	8697	Mrs Transome	145	" I am , at least , Harold . You are the first of your family that ever talked of being a Radical . I did not think I was taking care of our old oaks for that . I always thought Radicals ' houses stood staring above poor sticks of young trees and iron hurdles . "
9009	9029	9031	9031	Harold	145	" Yes , but the Radical sticks are growing , mother , and half the Tory oaks are rotting , "
9037	9050	9031	9031	Harold	145	" You 've arranged for Jermyn to be early to - morrow ? "
9051	9075	9076	9077	Mrs Transome	145	" He will be here to breakfast at nine . But I leave you to Hickes now ; we dine in an hour . "
9315	9321	9322	9322	she	145	" I am a hag ! "
9340	9382	9322	9322	she	145	" an ugly old woman who happens to be his mother . That is what he sees in me , as I see a stranger in him . I shall count for nothing . I was foolish to expect anything else . "
9397	9402	9403	9403	she	145	" What a likeness ! "
9411	9424	9403	9403	she	145	" yet , perhaps , no one will see it besides me . "
10386	10388	10372	10372	she	145	" ways "
11284	11299	11301	11302	Mrs Transome	145	" The bell has rung , then , Denner , without my hearing it ? "
11306	11311	11313	11313	Denner	159	" Yes , madam , "
11658	11679	11642	11642	She	145	" Mr Harold is drest ; he shook me by the hand in the corridor , and was very pleasant . "
11680	11693	11642	11642	She	145	" What an alteration , Denner ! No likeness to me now . "
11694	11785	11786	11787	Mrs Transome	145	" Handsome , though , spite of his being so browned and stout . There 's a fine presence about Mr Harold . I remember you used to say , madam , there were some people you would always know were in the room though they stood round a corner , and others you might never see till you ran against them . That 's as true as truth . And as for likenesses , thirty - five and sixty are not much alike , only to people 's memories . "
11797	11834	11791	11791	Denner	159	" I do n't know how things will go on now ; but it seems something too good to happen that they will go on well . I am afraid of ever expecting anything good again . "
11835	11895	11642	11642	She	145	" That 's weakness , madam . Things do n't happen because they 're bad or good , else all eggs would be addled or none at all , and at the most it is but six to the dozen . There 's good chances and bad chances , and nobody 's luck is pulled only by one string . "
11896	11948	11642	11642	She	145	" What a woman you are , Denner ! You talk like a French infidel . It seems to me you are afraid of nothing . I have been full of fears all my life — always seeing something for other hanging over me that I could n't bear to happen . "
11949	12067	11791	11791	Denner	159	" Well , madam , put a good face on it , and do n't seem to be on the look - out for crows , else you 'll set other people watching . Here you have a rich son come home , and the debts will all be paid , and you have your health and can ride about , and you 've such a face and figure , and will have if you live to be eighty , that everybody is cap in hand to you before they know who you are — let me fasten up your veil a little higher : there 's a good deal of pleasure in life for you yet . "
12068	12103	11642	11642	She	145	" Nonsense ! there 's no pleasure for old women , unless they get it out of tormenting other people . What are your pleasures , Denner — besides being a slave to me ? "
12104	12288	11791	11791	Denner	159	" Oh , there 's pleasure in knowing one 's not a fool , like half the people one sees about . And managing one 's husband is some pleasure ; and doing all one 's business well . Why , if I 've only got some orange flowers to candy , I should n't like to die till I see them all right . Then there 's the sunshine now and then ; I like that , as the cats do . I look upon it , life is like our game at whist , when Banks and his wife come to the still - room of an evening . I do n't enjoy the game much , but I like to play my cards well , and see what will be the end of it ; and I want to see you make the best of your hand , madam , for your luck has been mine these forty years now . But I must go and see how Kitty dishes up the dinner , unless you have any more commands . "
12289	12300	11642	11642	She	145	" No , Denner ; I am going down immediately . "
13479	13505	13469	13469	she	145	" It is a lucky eel that escapes skinning . The best happiness I shall ever know , will be to escape the worst misery . "
13754	13770	13734	13734	Harold	145	" I shall just cross the park to the parsonage to see my uncle Lingon . "
13771	13783	13734	13734	Harold	145	" Very well . He can answer more questions for you . "
13784	13787	13789	13789	Harold	145	" Yes , "
13809	13847	13789	13789	Harold	145	" I want to hear all about the game and the North Loamshire hunt . I 'm fond of sport ; we had a great deal of it at Smyrna , and it keeps down my fat . "
14080	14144	14076	14078	Mr Matthew Jermyn	169	" A fat - handed , glib - tongued fellow , with a scented cambric handkerchief ; one of your educated lowbred fellows ; a foundling who got his Latin for nothing at Christ 's Hospital ; one of your middle - class upstarts who want to rank with gentlemen , and think they 'll do it with kid gloves and new furniture . "
14501	14529	14458	14459	a Tory	1104	" Why , lad , if the world was turned into a swamp , I suppose we should leave off shoes and stockings , and walk about like cranes"—whence
14611	14887	14601	14601	he	1088	" If the mob ca n't be turned back , a man of family must try and head the mob , and save a few homes and hearths , and keep the country up on its last legs as long as he can . And you 're a man of family , my lad — dash it ! you 're a Lingon , whatever else you may be , and I 'll stand by you . I 've no great interest ; I 'm a poor parson . I 've been forced to give up hunting ; my pointers and a glass of good wine are the only decencies becoming my station that I can allow myself . But I 'll give you my countenance — I'll stick to you as my nephew . There 's no need for me to change sides exactly . I was born a Tory , and I shall never be a bishop . But if anybody says you 're in the wrong , I shall say , ' My nephew is in the right ; he has turned Radical to save his country . If William Pitt had been living now , he 'd have done the same ; for what did he say when he was dying ? Not ' O save my party ! ' but ' O save my country , heaven ! ' That was what they dinned in our ears about Peel and the Duke ; and now I 'll turn it round upon them . They shall be hoist with their own petrad . Yes , yes , I 'll stand by you . "
15642	15650	15652	15652	Jermyn	169	" I congratulate you , Mrs Transome , "
15661	15666	15667	15667	he	169	" all the more , "
15674	15702	15667	15667	he	169	" now I have the pleasure of actually seeing your son . I am glad to perceive that an Eastern climate has not been unfavourable to him . "
15703	15706	15708	15708	Harold	145	" No , "
15726	15789	15708	15708	Harold	145	" the question is , whether the English climate will agree with me . It 's deuced shifting and damp ; and as for food , it would be the finest thing in the world for this country if the southern cooks would change their religion , get persecuted , and fly to England , as the old silk - weavers did . "
15790	15811	15813	15814	Mrs Transome	145	" There are plenty of foreign cooks for those who are rich enough to pay for them , I suppose , "
15816	15829	15813	15814	Mrs Transome	145	" but they are unpleasant people to have about one 's house . "
15830	15839	15841	15841	Harold	145	" Gad ! I do n't think so , "
15843	15854	15841	15841	Harold	145	" The old servants are sure to quarrel with them . "
15855	15897	15813	15814	Mrs Transome	145	" That 's no concern of mine . The old servants will have to put up with my man Dominic , who will show them how to cook and do everything else , in a way that will rather astonish them . "
15898	15914	15966	15966	Jermyn	169	" Old people are not so easily taught to change all their ways , Harold . "
15915	15928	15930	15930	Harold	145	" Well , they can give up and watch the young ones , "
15954	15964	15966	15966	Jermyn	169	" You have a valuable servant , it seems , "
15988	16113	15966	15966	Jermyn	169	" O ! one of those wonderful southern fellows that make one 's life easy . He 's of no country in particular . I do n't know whether he 's most of a Jew , a Greek , an Italian , or a Spaniard . He speaks five or six languages , one as well as another . He 's cook , valet , major - domo , and secretary all in one ; and what 's more , he 's an affectionate fellow — I can trust to his attachment . That 's a sort of human specimen that does n't grow here in England , I fancy . I should have been badly off if I could not have brought Dominic . "
16368	16379	16381	16381	Harold	145	" Well , what are the prospects about the election ? "
16389	16415	16381	16381	Harold	145	" There are two Whigs and one Conservative likely to be in the field , I know . What is your opinion of the chances ? "
16495	16499	16500	16500	he	169	" My opinion , "
16503	16622	16500	16500	he	169	" is in a state of balance at present . This division of the county , you are aware , contains one manufacturing town of the first magnitude , and several smaller ones . The manufacturing interest is widely dispersed . So far — a — there is a presumption — a — in favour of the two Liberal candidates . Still with a careful canvass of the agricultural districts , such as those we have round us at Treby Magna , I think — a — the auguries — a — would not be unfavourable to the return of a Conservative . A fourth candidate of good position , who should coalesce with Mr Debarry — a — "
16637	16696	16633	16633	Harold	145	" That will not be my line of action , so we need not discuss it . If I put up it will be as a Radical ; and I fancy , in any county that would return Whigs there would be plenty of voters to be combed off by a Radical who offered himself with good pretensions . "
16758	16776	16751	16751	he	169	" I 'm delighted to perceive that you have kept yourself so thoroughly acquainted with English politics . "
16777	16783	16785	16785	Harold	145	" O , of course , "
16789	16865	16785	16785	Harold	145	" I 'm aware how things have been going on in England . I always meant to come back ultimately . I suppose I know the state of Europe as well as if I 'd been stationary at Little Treby for the last fifteen years . If a man goes to the East , people seem to think he gets turned into something like the one - eyed calender in the ' Arabian Nights . ' "
16866	16890	16892	16893	Mrs Transome	145	" Yet I should think there are some things which people who have been stationary at Little Treby could tell you , Harold , "
16895	16986	16892	16893	Mrs Transome	145	" It did not signify about your holding Radical opinions at Smyrna ; but you seem not to imagine how your putting up as a Radical will affect your position here , and the position of your family . No one will visit you . And then — the sort of people who will support you ! You really have no idea what an impression it conveys when you say you are a Radical . There are none of our equals who will not feel that you have disgraced yourself . "
16987	16990	16992	16992	Harold	145	" Pooh ! "
17011	17165	17010	17010	her	145	voice—"It seems to me that a man owes something to his birth and station , and has no right to take up this notion or the other , just as it suits his fancy ; still less to work at the overthrow of his class . That was what every one said of Lord Grey , and my family at least is as good as Lord Grey 's . You have wealth now , and might distinguish yourself in the county ; and if you had been true to your colours as a gentleman , you would have had all the greater opportunity because the times are so bad . The Debarrys and Lord Wyvern would have set all the more store by you . For my part , I ca n't conceive what good you propose to yourself . I only entreat you to think again before you take any decided step . "
17166	17169	17171	17171	Harold	145	" Mother , "
17204	17354	17180	17180	his	1167	" it is natural that you should think in this way . Women , very properly , do n't change their views , but keep to the notions in which they have been brought up . It does n't signify what they think — they are not called upon to judge or to act . You must really leave me to take my own course in these matters , which properly belong to men . Beyond that , I will gratify any wish you choose to mention . You shall have a new carriage and a pair of bays all to yourself ; you shall have the house done up in first - rate style , and I am not thinking of marrying . But let us understand that there shall be no further collision between us on subjects in which I must be master of my own actions . "
17355	17399	17400	17402	Mrs Transome here	145	" And you will put the crown to the mortifications of my life , Harold . I do n't know who would be a mother if she could foresee what a slight thing she will be to her son when she is old . "
17551	17555	17537	17537	Harold	145	" You smoke ? "
17556	17581	17582	17582	Harold	145	" No , I always defer to the ladies . Mrs Jermyn is peculiarly sensitive in such matters , and does n't like tobacco . "
17604	17631	17582	17582	Harold	145	" Confound the fellow — with his Mrs Jermyn ! Does he think we are on a footing for me to know anything about his wife ? "
17632	17642	17643	17643	he	169	" Well , I took my hookah before breakfast , "
17647	17674	17643	17643	he	169	" so , if you like , we 'll go into the library . My father never gets up till mid - day , I find . "
17675	17682	17684	17684	Harold	145	" Sit down , sit down , "
17725	17789	17790	17790	he	169	" The first question , Mr Jermyn , now you know my intentions , is , whether you will undertake to be my agent in this election , and help me through ? There 's no time to be lost , and I do n't want to lose my chance , as I may not have another for seven years . I understand , "
17801	17824	17790	17790	he	169	" that you have not taken any conspicuous course in politics ; and I know that Labron is agent for the Debarrys . "
17825	17995	17790	17790	he	169	" O — a — my dear sir — a man necessarily has his political convictions , but of what use is it for a professional man — a — of some education , to talk of them in a little country town ? There really is no comprehension of public questions in such places . Party feeling , indeed , was quite asleep here before the agitation about the Catholic Relief Bill . It is true that I concurred with our incumbent in getting up a petition against the Reform Bill , but I did not state my reasons . The weak points in that Bill are — a — too palpable , and I fancy you and I should not differ much on that head . The fact is , when I knew that you were to come back to us , I kept myself in reserve , though I was much pressed by the friends of Sir James Clement , the Ministerial candidate , who is — "
17996	18009	18011	18011	Harold	145	" However , you will act for me — that 's settled ? "
18013	18016	18018	18018	Jermyn	169	" Certainly , "
18032	18051	18018	18018	Jermyn	169	" Which of the Liberal candidates , as they call themselves , has the better chance , eh ? "
18052	18091	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	" I was going to observe that Sir James Clement has not so good a chance as Mr Garstin , supposing that a third Liberal candidate presents himself . There are two senses in which a politician can be liberal"—here
18094	18123	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	smiled—"Sir James Clement is a poor baronet , hoping for an appointment , and ca n't be expected to be liberal in that wider sense which commands majorities . "
18124	18137	18139	18139	Harold	145	" I wish this man were not so much of a talker , "
18141	18151	18152	18152	he	169	" he 'll bore me . We shall see , "
18156	18184	18152	18152	he	169	" what can be done in the way of combination . I 'll come down to your office after one o'clock , if it will suit you ? "
18185	18188	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	" Perfectly . "
18189	18270	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	" Ah , and you 'll have all the lists and papers and necessary information ready for me there . I must get up a dinner for the tenants , and we can invite whom we like besides the tenants . Just now , I 'm going over one of the farms on hand with the bailiff . By the way , that 's a desperately bad business , having three farms unlet — how comes that about , eh ? "
18271	18327	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	" That is precisely what I wanted to say a few words about to you . You have observed already how strongly Mrs Transome takes certain things to heart . You can imagine that she has been severely tried in many ways . Mr Transome 's want of health ; Mr Durfey 's habits — a—. "
18328	18333	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	" Yes , yes . "
18334	18529	18092	18093	Mr Jermyn	169	" She is a woman for whom I naturally entertain the highest respect , and she has had hardly any gratification for many years , except the sense of having affairs to a certain extent in her own hands . She objects to changes ; she will not have a new style of tenants ; she likes the old stock of farmers who milk their own cows , and send their younger daughters out to service : all this makes it difficult to do the best with the estate . I am aware things are not as they ought to be , for , in point of fact , an improved agricultural management is a matter in which I take considerable interest , and the farm which I myself hold on the estate you will see , I think , to be in a superior condition . But Mrs Transome is a woman of strong feeling , and I would urge you , my dear sir , to make the changes which you have , but which I had not , the right to insist on , as little painful to her as possible . "
18530	18543	18545	18545	Harold	145	" I shall know what to do , sir , never fear , "
18550	18602	18545	18545	Harold	145	" You will pardon , I hope , a perhaps undue freedom of suggestion from a man of my age , who has been so long in a close connection with the family affairs — a — I have never considered that connection simply in the light of business — a — "
18604	18618	18620	18620	Harold	145	" Damn him , I 'll soon let him know that I do , "
18657	18664	18665	18665	he	1175	" I understand , I understand , "
18669	18752	18665	18665	he	1175	" You 've had more awkward business on your hands than usually falls to the share of a family lawyer . We shall set everything right by degrees . But now as to the canvassing . I 've made arrangements with a first - rate man in London , who understands these matters thoroughly — a solicitor of course — he has carried no end of men into Parliament . I 'll engage him to meet us at Duffield — say when ? "
18827	18840	18820	18821	Mr Lingon	170	" Well , lad , how have you got on with Jermyn ? "
18841	18900	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" O , I do n't think I shall like the fellow . He 's a sort of amateur gentleman . But I must make use of him . I expect whatever I get out of him will only be something short of fair pay for what he has got out of us . But I shall see . "
18901	19049	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Ay , ay , use his gun to bring down your game , and after that beat the thief with the butt - end . That 's wisdom and justice and pleasure all in one — talking between ourselves , as uncle and nephew . But I say , Harold , I was going to tell you , now I come to think of it , this is rather a nasty business , your calling yourself a Radical . I 've been turning it over in after - dinner speeches , but it looks awkward — it 's not what people are used to — it wants a good deal of Latin to make it go down . I shall be worried about it at the sessions , and I can think of nothing neat enough to carry about in my pocket by way of answer . "
19050	19085	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Nonsense , uncle ; I remember what a good speechifier you always were : you 'll never be at a loss . You only want a few more evenings to think of it . "
19086	19122	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" But you 'll not be attacking the Church and the institutions of the country — you'll not be going those lengths ; you 'll keep up the bulwarks , and so on , eh ? "
19123	19154	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" No , I sha n't attack the Church — only the incomes of the bishops , perhaps , to make them eke out the incomes of the poor clergy . "
19155	19229	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Well , well , I have no objection to that . Nobody likes our Bishop : he 's all Greek and greediness ; too proud to dine with his own father . You may pepper the bishops a little . But you 'll respect the constitution handed down , & c.—and you 'll rally round the throne — and the King , God bless him , and the usual toasts , eh ? "
19230	19247	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Of course , of course . I am a Radical only in rooting out abuses . "
19248	19259	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" That 's the word I wanted , my lad ! "
19269	19302	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" That 's a spool to wind a speech on . Abuses is the very word ; and if anybody shows himself offended , he 'll put the cap on for himself . "
19303	19310	19312	19312	Harold	145	" I remove the rotten timbers , "
19317	19327	19312	19312	Harold	145	" and substitute fresh oak , that 's all . "
19328	19398	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Well done , my boy ! By George , you 'll be a speaker . But , I say , Harold , I hope you 've got a little Latin left . This young Debarry is a tremendous fellow at the classics , and walks on stilts to any length . He 's one of the new Conservatives . Old Sir Maximus does n't understand him at all . "
19399	19408	19410	19410	Harold	145	" That wo n't do at the hustings , "
19412	19424	19410	19410	Harold	145	" He 'll get knocked off his stilts pretty quickly there . "
19425	19487	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Bless me ! it 's astonishing how well you 're up in the affairs of the country , my boy . But rub up a few quotations — ' Quod turpe bonis decebat Crispinum ' — and that sort of thing — just to show Debarry what you could do if you liked . But you want to ride on ? "
19488	19500	19261	19262	the Vicar	1179	" Yes ; I have an appointment at Treby . Goodbye . "
19501	19508	19510	19511	the Vicar	1179	" He 's a cleverish chap , "
19518	19634	19510	19511	the Vicar	1179	" When he 's had plenty of English exercise , and brought out his knuckle a bit , he 'll be a Lingon again as he used to be . I must go and see how Arabella takes his being a Radical . It 's a little awkward ; but a clergyman must keep peace in a family . Confound it ! I 'm not bound to love Toryism better than my own flesh and blood , and the manor I shoot over . That 's a heathenish , Brutus - like sort of thing , as if Providence could n't take care of the country without my quarrelling with my own sister 's son ! "

Do you think there will ever be a great shout for the right — the shout of a nation as of one man , rounded and whole , like the voice of the archangel that bound together all the listeners of earth and heaven — if every Christian of you peeps round to see what his neighbours in good coats are doing , or else puts his hat before his face that he may shout and never be heard ? But this is what you do : when the servant of God stands up to deliver his message , do you lay your souls beneath the Word as you set out your plants beneath the falling rain ? No ; one of you sends his eyes to all corners , he smothers his soul with small questions , ' What does brother Y. think ? ' ' Is this doctrine high enough for brother Z. ? ' ' Will the church members be pleased ? ' And another — "
23626	23651	23610	23610	her	206	" Here is Mrs Holt wanting to speak to you ; she says she comes out of season , but she 's in trouble . "

23669	23770	23657	23658	Mr Lyon	201	" if you are wrestling with the enemy , let me refer you to Ezekiel the thirteenth and twenty - second , and beg of you not to groan . It is a stumbling - block and offence to my daughter ; she would take no broth yesterday , because she said you had cried into it . Thus you cause the truth to be lightly spoken of , and make the enemy rejoice . If your face - ache gives him an advantage , take a little warm ale with your meat — I do not grudge the money . "
23771	23797	23610	23610	her	206	" If I thought my drinking warm ale would hinder poor dear Miss Esther from speaking light — but she hates the smell of it . "
23798	23813	23814	23814	Lyddy	206	" Answer not again , Lyddy , but send up Mistress Holt to me . "
23820	23831	23833	23834	the minister	1401	" I lack grace to deal with these weak sisters , "
23843	23911	23912	23912	He	1401	" Their needs lie too much out of the track of my meditations , and take me often unawares . Mistress Holt is another who darkens counsel by words without knowledge , and angers the reason of the natural man . Lord , give me patience . My sins were heavier to bear than this woman 's folly . Come in , Mistress Holt , come in . "
24021	24032	24033	24033	he	1401	" You have something on your mind , Mistress Holt ? "
24039	24053	24033	24033	he	1401	" Indeed I have , sir , else I should n't be here . "
24054	24058	24223	24224	the minister	1401	" Speak freely . "
24059	24133	24033	24033	he	1401	" It 's well known to you , Mr Lyon , that my husband , Mr Holt , came from the north , and was a member in Malthouse Yard long before you began to be pastor of it , which was seven year ago last Michaelmas . It 's the truth , Mr Lyon , and I 'm not that woman to sit here and say it if it was n't true . "
24134	24141	24033	24033	he	1401	" Certainly , it is true . "
24142	24209	24223	24224	the minister	1401	" And if my husband had been alive when you 'd come to preach upon trial , he 'd have been as good a judge of your gifts as Mr Nuttwood or Mr Muscat , though whether he 'd have agreed with some that your doctrine was n't high enough , I ca n't say . For myself , I 've my opinion about high doctrine . "
24210	24221	24223	24224	the minister	1401	" Was it my preaching you came to speak about ? "
24231	24355	24223	24224	the minister	1401	" No , Mr Lyon , I 'm not that woman . But this I will say , for my husband died before your time , that he had a wonderful gift in prayer , as the old members well know , if anybody likes to ask 'em , not believing my words ; and he believed himself that the receipt for the Cancer Cure , which I 've sent out in bottles till this very last April before September as now is , and have bottles standing by me , — he believed it was sent him in answer to prayer ; and nobody can deny it , for he prayed most regular , and read out of the green baize Bible . "
24377	24388	24390	24391	Mr Lyon	201	" Has any one been aspersing your husband 's character ? "
24409	24573	24390	24391	Mr Lyon	201	" Sir , they daredn't . For though he was a man of prayer , he did n't want skill and knowledge to find things out for himself ; and that was what I used to say to my friends when they wondered at my marrying a man from Lancashire , with no trade nor fortune but what he 'd got in his head . But my husband 's tongue ' ud have been a fortune to anybody , and there was many a one said it was as good as a dose of physic to hear him talk ; not but what that got him into trouble in Lancashire , but he always said , if the worst came to the worst , he could go and preach to the blacks . But he did better than that , Mr Lyon , for he married me ; and this I will say , that for age , and conduct , and managing — "
24574	24578	24580	24581	the minister	1401	" Mistress Holt , "
24583	24616	24580	24581	the minister	1401	" these are not the things whereby we may edify one another . Let me beg of you to be as brief as you can . My time is not my own . "
24617	24946	24390	24391	Mr Lyon	201	" Well , Mr Lyon , I 've a right to speak to my own character ; and I 'm one of your congregation , though I 'm not a church member , for I was born in the general Baptist connection : and as for being saved without works , there 's a many , I daresay , ca n't do without that doctrine ; but I thank the Lord I never needed to put my self on a level with the thief on the cross . I 've done my duty , and more , if anybody comes to that ; for I 've gone without my bit of meat to make broth for a sick neighbour : and if there 's any of the church members say they 've done the same , I 'd ask them if they had the sinking at the stomach as I have ; for I 've ever strove to do the right thing , and more , for good - natured I always was ; and I little thought , after being respected by everybody , I should come to be reproached by my own son . And my husband said , when he was a - dying—'Mary , ' he said , ' the Elixir , and the Pills , and the Cure will support you , for they 've a great name in all the country round , and you 'll pray for a blessing on them . ' And so I have done , Mr Lyon ; and to say they 're not good medicines , when they 've been taken for fifty miles round by high and low , and rich and poor , and nobody speaking against 'em but Dr Lukin , it seems to me it 's a flying in the face of Heaven ; for if it was wrong to take the medicines , could n't the blessed Lord have stopped it ? "
25039	25071	25019	25020	Mr Lyon	201	" Am I wrong in gathering from what you say , Mistress Holt , that your son has objected in some way to your sale of your late husband 's medicines ? "
25072	25284	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" Mr Lyon , he 's masterful beyond everything , and he talks more than his father did . I 've got my reason , Mr Lyon , and if anybody talks sense I can follow him ; but Felix talks so wild , and contradicts his mother . And what do you think he says , after giving up his ' prenticeship , and going off to study at Glasgow , and getting through all the bit of money his father saved for his bringing - up — what has all his learning come to ? He says I 'd better never open my Bible , for it 's as bad poison to me as the pills are to half the people as swallow 'em . You 'll not speak of this again , Mr Lyon — I do n't think ill enough of you to believe that . For I suppose a Christian can understand the word o ' God without going to Glasgow , and there 's texts upon texts about ointment and medicine , and there 's one as might have been made for a receipt of my husband's — it 's just as if it was a riddle , and Holt 's Elixir was the answer . "
25285	25295	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" Your son uses rash words , Mistress Holt , "
25300	25397	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" but it is quite true that we may err in giving a too private interpretation to the Scripture . The word of God has to satisfy the larger needs of His people , like the rain and the sunshine — which no man must think to be meant for his own patch of seed - ground solely . Will it not be well that I should see your son , and talk with him on these matters ? He was at chapel , I observed , and I suppose I am to be his pastor . "
25398	25589	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" That was what I wanted to ask you , Mr Lyon . For perhaps he 'll listen to you , and not talk you down as he does his poor mother . For after we 'd been to chapel , he spoke better of you than he does of most : he said you was a fine old fellow , and an old - fashioned Puritan — he uses dreadful language , Mr Lyon ; but I saw he did n't mean you ill , for all that . He calls most folks ' religion rottenness ; and yet another time he 'll tell me I ought to feel myself a sinner , and do God 's will and not my own . But it 's my belief he says first one thing and then another only to abuse his mother . Or else he 's going off his head , and must be sent to a ' sylum . But if he writes to the North Loamshire Herald first , to tell everybody the medicines are good for nothing , how can I ever keep him and myself ? "
25590	25607	25609	25610	Mr Lyon	201	" Tell him I shall feel favoured if he will come and see me this evening , "
25642	25714	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" Meanwhile , my friend , I counsel you to send up a supplication , which I shall not fail to offer also , that you may receive a spirit of humility and submission , so that you may not be hindered from seeing and following the Divine guidance in this matter by any false lights of pride and obstinacy . Of this more when I have spoken with your son . "
25715	25837	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" I 'm not proud or obstinate , Mr Lyon . I never did say I was everything that was bad , and I never will . And why this trouble should be sent on me above everybody else — for I have n't told you all . He 's made himself a journeyman to Mr Prowd the watchmaker — after all this learning — and he says he 'll go with patches on his knees , and he shall like himself the better . And as for his having little boys to teach , they 'll come in all weathers with dirty shoes . If it 's madness , Mr Lyon , it 's no use your talking to him . "
25838	25875	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" We shall see . Perhaps it may even be the disguised working of grace within him . We must not judge rashly . Many eminent servants of God have been led by ways as strange . "
25876	26150	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" Then I 'm sorry for their mothers , that 's all , Mr Lyon ; and all the more if they 'd been well - spoken - on women . For not my biggest enemy , whether it 's he or she , if they 'll speak the truth , can turn round and say I 've deserved this trouble . And when everybody gets their due , and people 's doing are spoke of on the house - tops , as the Bible says they will be , it 'll be known what I 've gone through with those medicines — the pounding , and the pouring , and the letting stand , and the weighing — up early and down late — there 's nobody knows yet but One that 's worthy to know ; and the pasting o ' the printed labels right side upwards . There 's few women would have gone through with it ; and it 's reasonable to think it 'll be made up to me ; for if there 's promised and purchased blessings , I should think this trouble is purchasing 'em . For if my son Felix does n't have a strait - waistcoat put on him , he 'll have his way . But I say no more . I wish you good morning , Mr Lyon , and thank you , though I well know it 's your duty to act as you 're doing . And I never troubled you about my own soul , as some do who look down on me for not being a church member . "
26151	26173	25297	25298	the minister	1401	" Farewell , Mistress Holt , farewell . I pray that a more powerful teacher than I am may instruct you . "
26194	26307	26180	26184	the much - tried Rufus	1431	" This woman has sat under the Gospel all her life , and she is as blind as a heathen , and as proud and stiff - necked as a Pharisee ; yet she is one of the souls I watch for . ' Tis true that even Sara , the chosen mother of God 's people , showed a spirit of unbelief , and perhaps of selfish anger ; and it is a passage that bears the unmistakable signet , ' doing honour to the wife or woman , as unto the weaker vessel . ' For therein is the greatest check put on the ready scorn of the natural man . "
26371	26375	26328	26328	he	201	" Hm - m "
26624	26671	26619	26619	he	1401	" You are doubtless amazed to see me with a wax - light , my young friend ; but this undue luxury is paid for with the earnings of my daughter , who is so delicately framed that the smell of tallow is loathsome to her . "
26672	26701	26619	26619	he	1401	" I heeded not the candle , sir . I thank Heaven I am not a mouse to have a nose that takes note of wax or tallow . "
26777	26789	26790	26790	he	1438	" And I myself , in fact , am equally indifferent , "
26801	26813	26790	26790	he	1438	" so that I have a sufficient light on my book . "
26824	26841	26843	26843	Felix	198	" ' Tis the quality of the page you care about , not of the candle , "
26852	26868	26843	26843	Felix	198	" You 're thinking that you have a roughly - written page before you now . "
26974	26985	26986	26986	he	1401	" I abstain from judging by the outward appearance only , "
26994	27101	26990	26990	his	1401	" I myself have experienced that when the spirit is much exercised it is difficult to remember neckbands and strings and such small accidents of our vesture , which are nevertheless decent and needful so long as we sojourn in the flesh . And you too , my young friend , as I gather from your mother 's troubled and confused report , are undergoing some travail of mind . You will not , I trust , object to open yourself fully to me , as to an aged pastor who has himself had much inward wrestling , and has especially known much temptation from doubt . "
27102	27107	27109	27109	Felix	198	" As to doubt , "
27117	27244	27109	27109	Felix	198	" if it is those absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my mother has been talking of to you — and I suppose it is — I've no more doubt about them than I have about pocket - picking . I know there 's a stage of speculation in which a man may doubt whether a pickpocket is blameworthy — but I 'm not one of your subtle fellows who keep looking at the world through their own legs . If I allowed the sale of those medicines to go on , and my mother to live out of the proceeds when I can keep her by the honest labour of my hands , I 've not the least doubt that I should be a rascal . "
27245	27259	27261	27262	Mr Lyon	201	" I would fain inquire more particularly into your objection to these medicines , "
27307	27435	27109	27109	Felix	198	" I know they have been well reported of , and many wise persons have tried remedies providentially discovered by those who are not regular physicians , and have found a blessing in the use of them . I may mention the eminent Mr Wesley , who , though I hold not altogether with his Arminian doctrine , nor with the usages of his institution , was nevertheless a man of God ; and the journals of various Christians whose names have left a sweet savour might be cited in the same sense . Moreover , your father , who originally concocted these medicines and left them as a provision for your mother , was , as I understand , a man whose walk was not unfaithful . "
27436	27442	27444	27444	Felix	198	" My father was ignorant , "
27448	27586	27444	27444	Felix	198	" He knew neither the complication of the human system , nor the way in which drugs counteract each other . Ignorance is not so damnable as humbug , but when it prescribes pills it may happen to do more harm . I know something about these things . I was ' prentice for five miserable years to a stupid brute of a country apothecary — my poor father left money for that — he thought nothing could be finer for me . No matter : I know that the Cathartic Pills are a drastic compound which may be as bad as poison to half the people who swallow them ; that the Elixir is an absurd farrago of a dozen incompatible things ; and that the Cancer Cure might as well be bottled ditch - water . "
27642	27653	27634	27634	he	201	" How long have you known this , young man ? "
27654	27660	27662	27662	Felix	198	" Well put , sir , "
27664	27692	27634	27634	he	201	" I 've known it a good deal longer than I 've acted on it , like plenty of other things . But you believe in conversion ? "
27693	27698	27634	27634	he	201	" Yea , verily . "
27699	27712	27713	27714	The minister	1401	" So do I. I was converted by six weeks ' debauchery . "
27717	27721	27722	27722	he	201	" Young man , "
27740	27754	27722	27722	he	201	" speak not lightly of the Divine operations , and restrain unseemly words . "
27755	27762	27764	27764	Felix	198	" I 'm not speaking lightly , "
27766	28020	27764	27764	Felix	198	" If I had not seen that I was making a hog of myself very fast , and that pig - wash , even if I could have got plenty of it , was a poor sort of thing , I should never have looked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it . I laughed out loud at last to think of a poor devil like me , in a Scotch garret , with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be dissipated upon , with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below , and old women breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs — wanting to turn my life into easy pleasure . Then I began to see what else it could be turned into . Not much , perhaps . This world is not a very fine place for a good many of the people in it . But I 've made up my mind it sha n't be the worse for me , if I can help it . They may tell me I ca n't alter the world — that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it , and if I do n't lie and filch somebody else will . Well , then , somebody else shall , for I wo n't . That 's the upshot of my conversion , Mr Lyon , if you want to know it . "
28035	28048	28021	28022	Mr Lyon	201	" Did you sit under any preacher at Glasgow , young man ? "
28049	28069	27764	27764	Felix	198	" No : I heard most of the preachers once , but I never wanted to hear them twice . "
28128	28136	28137	28137	he	199	" And now , may I ask , "
28140	28298	28137	28137	he	199	" what course you mean to take , after hindering your mother from making and selling these drugs ? I speak no more in their favour after what you have said . God forbid that I should strive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and honourable . But your mother is advanced in years ; she needs comfortable sustenance ; you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends ? ' He that provideth not for his own — ' I trust you respect the authority that so speaks . And I will not suppose that , after being tender of conscience towards strangers , you will be careless towards your mother . There be indeed some who , taking a mighty charge on their shoulders , must perforce leave their households to Providence , and to the care of humbler brethren , but in such a case the call must be clear . "
28299	28371	28689	28690	Mr Lyon	201	" I shall keep my mother as well — nay , better — than she has kept herself . She has always been frugal . With my watch and clock cleaning , and teaching one or two little chaps that I 've got to come to me , I can earn enough . As for me , I can live on bran porridge . I have the stomach of a rhinoceros . "
28372	28508	28137	28137	he	199	" But for a young man so well furnished as you , who can questionless write a good hand and keep books , were it not well to seek some higher situation as clerk or assistant ? I could speak to Brother Muscat , who is well acquainted with all such openings . Any place in Pendrell 's Bank , I fear , is now closed against such as are not Churchmen . It used not to be so , but a year ago he discharged Brother Bodkin , although he was a valuable servant . Still , something might be found . There are ranks and degrees — and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly change what seems to be a providential appointment . Your poor mother is not altogether — "
28509	28688	28137	28137	he	199	" Excuse me , Mr Lyon ; I 've had all that out with my mother , and I may as well save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up about that a long while ago . I 'll take no employment that obliges me to prop up my chin with a high cravat , and wear straps , and pass the live - long day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt - pins . That sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts ; it only happens to be paid out of proportion . That 's why I set myself to learn the watchmaking trade . My father was a weaver first of all . It would have been better for him if he had remained a weaver . I came home through Lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still . I mean to stick to the class I belong to — people who do n't follow the fashions . "
28742	28747	28748	28748	he	201	" Well , well , "
28753	28780	28748	28748	he	201	" it is true that St Paul exercised the trade of tent - making , though he was learned in all the wisdom of the Rabbis . "
28781	28789	28791	28791	Felix	198	" St Paul was a wise man , "
28793	28878	28748	28748	he	201	" Why should I want to get into the middle class because I have some learning ? The most of the middle class are as ignorant as the working people about everything that does n't belong to their own Brummagem life . That 's how the working men are left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves : the best heads among them forsake their born comrades , and go in for a house with a high door - step and a brass knocker . "
28936	28939	28940	28940	he	201	" Nevertheless , "
28945	29021	28940	28940	he	201	" it is by such self - advancement that many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty and to the public wellbeing . The ring and the robe of Joseph were no objects for a good man 's ambition , but they were the signs of that credit which he won by his divinely - inspired skil , and which enabled him to act as a saviour to his brethren . "
29022	29160	29161	29161	Felix	198	" O yes , your ringed and scented men of the people!—I wo n't be one of them . Let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock , and he 'll get new wants and new motives . Metamorphosis will have begun at his neck - joint , and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and then his reasoning , which will follow his likings as the feet of a hungry dog follow his nose . I 'll have none of your clerkly gentility . I might end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine coat and a glutton 's dinner , on pretence of serving the poor men . I 'd sooner be Paley 's fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach , though"—here
29166	29182	29163	29163	his	1454	little—"I should like well enough to be another sort of demagogue , if I could . "
29183	29199	29201	29202	Mr Lyon	201	" Then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of these times ? "
29212	29241	29201	29202	Mr Lyon	201	" I should think so . I despise every man who has not — or , having it , does n't try to rouse it in other men . "
29242	29251	29253	29254	the minister	1401	" Right , my young friend , right , "
29318	29455	29470	29470	his	1456	" That is my own view , which I maintain in the face of some opposition from brethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to the closer walk , and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their duties as members of the commonwealth . I have had much puerile blame cast upon me because I have uttered such names as Brougham and Wellington in the pulpit . Why not Wellington as well as Rabshakeh ? and why not Brougham as well as Balaam ? Does God know less of men than He did in the days of Hezekiah and Moses?—is His arm shortened , and is the world become too wide for His providence ? But , they say , there are no politics in the New Testament — "
29456	29465	29467	29467	Felix	198	" Well , they 're right enough there , "
29474	29497	29499	29500	Mr Lyon	201	" What ! you are of those who hold that a Christian minister should not meddle with public matters in the pulpit ? "
29504	29515	29499	29500	Mr Lyon	201	" I am ready to join issue on that point . "
29516	29522	29524	29524	Felix	198	" Not I , sir , "
29526	29586	29524	29524	Felix	198	" I should say , teach any truth you can , whether it 's in the Testament or out of it . It 's little enough anybody can get hold of , and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a pence - counting , parcel - tying generation , such as mostly fill your chapels . "
29587	29591	29593	29594	Mr Lyon	201	" Young man , "
29638	29955	29621	29621	he	201	" I speak not on my own behalf , for not only have I no desire that any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , but I am aware of much that should make me patient under a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction . I speak not as claiming reverence for my own age and office — not to shame you , but to warn you . It is good that you should use plainness of speech , and I am not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young , that they themselves , being elders , may be heard at large ; for Elihu was the youngest of Job 's friends , yet was there a wise rebuke in his words ; and the aged Eli was taught by a revelation to the boy Samuel . I have to keep a special watch over myself in this matter , inasmuch as I have a need of utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent - up fire , until I have shot it forth , as it were , in arrowy words , each one hitting its mark . Therefore I pray for a listening spirit , which is a great mark of grace . Nevertheless , my young friend , I am bound , as I said , to warn you . The temptations that most beset those who have great natural gifts , and are wise after the flesh , are pride and scorn , more particularly towards those weak things of the world which have been chosen to confound the things which are mighty . The scornful nostril and the high head gather not the odours that lie on the track of truth . The mind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is — "
29984	30019	29979	29979	he	201	" Is , I may say , as a clenched fist that can give blows , but is shut up from receiving and holding ought that is precious — though it were heavensent manna . "
30020	30027	30029	30029	Felix	198	" I understand you , sir , "
30062	30075	30051	30051	he	201	" But I 'm not inclined to clench my fist at you . "
30076	30081	30083	30084	Mr Lyon	201	" Well , well , "
30091	30161	30083	30084	Mr Lyon	201	" we shall see more of each other , and I trust shall have much profitable communing . You will stay and have a dish of tea with us : we take the meal late on Thursdays , because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the French tongue . But she is doubtless returned now , and will presently come and pour out tea for us . "
30162	30170	30172	30172	Felix	198	" Thank you ; I 'll stay , "
30273	30286	30287	30287	he	1401	" I 'm perhaps a little too fond of banging and smashing , "
30291	30367	30287	30287	he	1401	" a phrenologist at Glasgow told me I had large veneration ; another man there , who knew me , laughed out and said I was the most blasphemous iconoclast living . ' That , ' says my phrenologist , ' is because of his large Ideality , which prevents him from finding anything perfect enough to be venerated . ' Of course I put my ears down and wagged my tail at that stroking . "
30368	30469	30470	30470	Esther	208	" Yes , yes ; I have had my own head explored with somewhat similar results . It is , I fear , but a vain show of fulfilling the heathen precept , ' Know thyself , ' and too often leads to a self - estimate which will subsist in the absence of that fruit by which alone the quality of the tree is made evident . Nevertheless — Esther , my dear , this is Mr Holt , whose acquaintance I have even now been making with more than ordinary interest . He will take tea with us . "
30678	30681	30683	30684	Mr Lyon	201	" Nevertheless , "
30695	30759	30683	30684	Mr Lyon	201	" that phrenological science is not irreconcilable with the revealed dispensations . And it is undeniable that we have our varying native dispositions which even grace will not obliterate . I myself , from my youth up , have been given to question too curiously concerning the truth — to examine and sift the medicine of the soul rather than to apply it . "
30760	30785	30787	30787	Felix	198	" If your truth happens to be such medicine as Holt 's Pills and Elixir , the less you swallow of it the better , "
30789	30829	30787	30787	Felix	198	" But truth - vendors and medicine - vendors usually recommend swallowing . When a man sees his livelihood in a pill or a proposition , he likes to have orders for the dose , and not curious inquiries . "
30893	30902	30881	30881	she	1459	" The tea is poured out , father . "
31006	31018	31020	31021	the minister	1401	" Will you draw up to the table , Mr Holt ? "
31100	31105	31107	31107	Felix	198	" O my stars ! "
31109	31115	31107	31107	Felix	198	" I beg your pardon . "
31184	31189	31190	31190	he	1479	" Byron 's Poems ! "
31208	31232	31190	31190	he	1479	" ' The Dream'—he'd better have been asleep and snoring . What ! do you stuff your memory with Byron , Miss Lyon ? "
31295	31304	31288	31288	she	208	" I have a great admiration for Byron . "
31366	31378	31380	31381	Mr Lyon	201	" He is a worldly and vain writer , I fear , "
31405	31410	31412	31412	Felix	198	" A misanthropic debauchee , "
31430	31474	31412	31412	Felix	198	" whose notion of a hero was that he should disorder his stomach and despise mankind . His corsairs and renegades , his Alps and Manfreds , are the most paltry puppets that were ever pulled by the strings of lust and pride . "
31475	31482	31484	31485	Mr Lyon	201	" Hand the book to me , "
31487	31503	31505	31505	Esther	208	" Let me beg of you to put it aside till after tea , father , "
31507	31533	31505	31505	Esther	208	" However objectionable Mr Holt may find its pages , they would certainly be made worse by being greased with bread - and - butter . "
31534	31542	31544	31545	Mr Lyon	201	" That is true , my dear , "
31566	31571	31573	31573	Felix	198	" Ho , ho ! "
31575	31612	31573	31573	Felix	198	" her father is frightened at her . How came he to have such a nice - stepping , long - necked peacock for his daughter ? but she shall see that I am not frightened . "
31618	31638	31614	31614	he	201	" I should like to know how you will justify your admiration for such a writer , Miss Lyon . "
31639	31651	31653	31653	Esther	208	" I should not attempt it with you , Mr Holt , "
31655	31697	31653	31653	Esther	208	" You have such strong words at command , that they make the smallest argument seem formidable . If I had ever met the giant Cormoran , I should have made a point of agreeing with him in his literary opinions . "
31747	31759	31761	31762	the minister	1401	" My daughter is a critic of words , Mr Holt , "
31767	31856	31761	31762	the minister	1401	" and often corrects mine on the ground of niceties , which I profess are as dark to me as if they were the reports of a sixth sense which I possess not . I am an eager seeker for precision , and would fain find language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the soul 's pathways , but I see not why a round word that means some object , made and blessed by the Creator , should be branded and banished as a malefactor . "
31857	31869	31871	31871	Felix	198	" O , your niceties — I know what they are , "
31878	31961	31871	31871	Felix	198	" They all go on your system of make - believe . ' Rottenness ' may suggest what is unpleasant , so you 'd better say ' sugar - plums , ' or something else such a long way off the fact that nobody is obliged to think of it . Those are your roundabout euphuisms that dress up swindling till it looks as well as honesty , and shoot with boiled pease instead of bullets . I hate your gentlemanly speakers . "
31962	31974	31976	31976	Esther	208	" Then you would not like Mr Jermyn , I think , "
31978	32062	31976	31976	Esther	208	" That reminds me , father , that to - day , when I was giving Miss Louisa Jermyn her lesson , Mr Jermyn came in and spoke to me with grand politeness , and asked me at what times you were likely to be disengaged , because he wished to make your better acquaintance , and consult you on matters of importance . He never took the least notice of me before . Can you guess the reason of his sudden ceremoniousness ? "
32063	32068	32070	32071	the minister	1401	" Nay , child , "
32075	32081	32083	32083	Felix	198	" Politics , of course , "
32085	32127	32083	32083	Felix	198	" He 's on some committee . An election is coming . Universal peace is declared , and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry . Eh , Mr Lyon ? Is n't that it ? "
32128	32217	31976	31976	Esther	208	" Nay , not so . He is the close ally of the Transome family , who are blind hereditary Tories like the Debarrys , and will drive their tenants to the poll as if they were sheep . And it has even been hinted that the heir who is coming from the East may be another Tory candidate , and coalesce with the younger Debarry . It is said that he has enormous wealth , and could purchase every vote in the county that has a price . "
32218	32223	32225	32225	Esther	208	" He is come , "
32227	32248	32225	32225	Esther	208	" I heard Miss Jermyn tell her sister that she had seen him going out of her father 's room . "
32249	32254	32256	32257	Mr Lyon	201	" ' Tis strange , "
32259	32266	32268	32268	Esther	208	" Something extraordinary must have happened , "
32270	32375	32268	32268	Esther	208	" for Mr Jermyn to intend courting us . Miss Jermyn said to me only the other day that she could not think how I came to be so well educated and ladylike . She always thought Dissenters were ignorant , vulgar people . I said , so they were , usually , and Church people also in small towns . She considers herself a judge of what is ladylike , and she is vulgarity personified — with large feet , and the most odious scent on her handkerchief , and a bonnet that looks like ' The Fashion ' printed in capital letters . "
32376	32389	32391	32391	Felix	198	" One sort of fine - ladyism is as good as another , "
32393	32401	32403	32403	Esther	208	" No , indeed . Pardon me , "
32405	32450	32403	32403	Esther	208	" A real fine - lady does not wear clothes that flare in people 's eyes , or use importunate scents , or make a noise as she moves : she is something refined , and graceful , and charming , and never obtrusive . "
32451	32455	32457	32457	Felix	198	" O yes , "
32461	32492	32457	32457	Felix	198	" And she reads Byron also , and admires Childe Harold — gentlemen of unspeakable woes , who employ a hairdresser , and look seriously at themselves in the glass . "
32507	32565	32502	32502	Felix	198	" A fine lady is a squirrel - headed thing , with small airs and small notions , about as applicable to the business of life as a pair of tweezers to the clearing of a forest . Ask your father what those old persecuted emigrant Puritans would have done with fine - lady wives and daughters . "
32566	32576	32578	32578	Esther	208	" O there is no danger of such misalliances , "
32580	32603	32578	32578	Esther	208	" Men who are unpleasant companions and make frights of themselves , are sure to get wives tasteless enough to suit them . "
32604	32610	32612	32613	Mr Lyon	201	" Esther , my dear , "
32615	32651	32612	32613	Mr Lyon	201	" let not your playfulness betray you into disrespect towards those venerable pilgrims . They struggled and endured in order to cherish and plant anew the seeds of scriptural doctrine and of a pure discipline . "
32652	32658	32660	32660	Esther	208	" Yes , I know , "
32672	32680	32681	32681	Felix	198	" O they were an ugly lot ! "
32690	32739	32681	32681	Felix	198	" Miss Medora would n't have minded if they had all been put into the pillory and lost their ears . She would have said , ' Their ears did stick out so . ' I should n't wonder if that 's a bust of one of them . "
32762	32765	32767	32768	Mr Lyon	201	" No , "
32770	32866	32767	32768	Mr Lyon	201	" that is the eminent George Whitfield , who , you well know , had a gift of oratory as of one on whom the tongue of flame had rested visibly . But Providence — doubtless for wise ends in relation to the inner man , for I would not inquire too closely into minutiæ which carry too many plausible interpretations for any one of them to be stable — Providence , I say , ordained that the good man should squint ; and my daughter has not yet learned to bear with this infirmity . "
32867	32883	32885	32885	Felix	198	" So she has put a veil over it . Suppose you had squinted yourself ? "
32891	32908	32910	32910	Esther	208	" Then , doubtless , you could have been more polite to me , Mr Holt , "
32922	32933	32910	32910	Esther	208	" You seem to prefer what is unusual and ugly . "
32934	32938	32940	32940	Felix	198	" A peacock ! "
32942	32965	32940	32940	Felix	198	" I should like to come and scold her every day , and make her cry and cut her fine hair off . "
32974	32999	32966	32966	Felix	198	" I will not take up more of your valuable time , Mr Lyon . I know that you have not many spare evenings . "
33000	33092	32910	32910	Esther	208	" That is true , my young friend ; for I now go to Sproxton one evening in the week . I do not despair that we may some day need a chapel there , though the hearers do not multiply save among the women , and there is no work as yet begun among the miners themselves . I shall be glad of your company in my walk thither to - morrow at five o'clock , if you would like to see how that population has grown of late years . "
33093	33117	32910	32910	Esther	208	" O , I 've been to Sproxton already several times . I had a congregation of my own there last Sunday evening . "
33118	33125	33127	33128	Mr Lyon	201	" What ! do you preach ? "
33135	33147	33127	33128	Mr Lyon	201	" Not exactly . I went to the ale - house . "
33152	33195	33127	33128	Mr Lyon	201	" I trust you are putting a riddle to me , young man , even as Samson did to his companions . From what you said but lately , it can not be that you are given to tippling and to taverns . "
33196	33289	33359	33360	the minister	1401	" O , I do n't drink much . I order a pint of beer , and I get into talk with the fellows over their pots and pipes . Somebody must take a little knowledge and common sense to them in this way , else how are they to get it ? I go for educating the non - electors , so I put myself in the way of my pupils — my academy is the beer - house . I 'll walk with you to - morrow with great pleasure . "
33290	33297	33299	33300	Mr Lyon	201	" Do so , do so , "
33309	33326	33299	33300	Mr Lyon	201	" We shall understand each other better by - and - by , I doubt not . "
33327	33338	33339	33339	Esther	208	" I wish you good - evening , Miss Lyon . "
33347	33357	33359	33360	the minister	1401	" That is a singular young man , Esther , "
33369	33521	33359	33360	the minister	1401	" I discern in him a love for whatsoever things are honest and true , which I would fain believe to be an earnest of further endowment with the wisdom that is from on high . It is true that , as the traveller in the desert is often lured , by a false vision of water and freshness , to turn aside from the track which leads to the tried and established fountains , so the Evil One will take advantage of a natural yearning towards the better , to delude the soul with a self - flattering belief in a visionary virtue , higher than the ordinary fruits of the Spirit . But I trust it is not so here . I feel a great enlargement in this young man 's presence , notwithstanding a certain licence in his language , which I shall use my efforts to correct . "
33522	33532	33534	33534	Esther	208	" I think he is very coarse and rude , "
33545	33562	33534	33534	Esther	208	" But he speaks better English than most of our visitors . What is his occupation ? "
33563	33613	33542	33542	her	208	" Watch and clock making , by which , together with a little teaching , as I understand , he hopes to maintain his mother , not thinking it right that she should live by the sale of medicines whose virtues he distrusts . It is no common scruple . "
33614	33618	33620	33620	Esther	208	" Dear me , "
33622	33632	33633	33633	She	208	" I thought he was something higher than that . "
33656	33915	33637	33637	Felix	198	" Now by what fine meshes of circumstance did that queer devout old man , with his awful creed , which makes this world a vestibule with double doors to hell , and a narrow stair on one side whereby the thinner sort may mount to heaven — by what subtle play of flesh and spirit did he come to have a daughter so little in his own likeness ? Married foolishly , I suppose . I 'll never marry , though I should have to live on raw turnips to subdue my flesh . I 'll never look back and say , ' I had a fine purpose once — I meant to keep my hands clean , and my soul upright , and to look truth in the face ; but pray excuse me , I have a wife and children — I must lie and simper a little , else they 'll starve ; ' or , ' My wife is nice , she must have her bread well buttered , and her feelings will be hurt if she is not thought genteel . ' That is the lot Miss Esther is preparing for some man or other . I could grind my teeth at such self - satisfied minxes , who think they can tell everybody what is the correct thing , and the utmost stretch of their ideas will not place them on a level with the intelligent fleas . I should like to see if she could be made ashamed of herself . "
34276	34278	34272	34272	she	208	" undeniable "
35706	35709	35722	35722	she	208	" Mamma ; "
35867	35942	35863	35863	he	1479	" My Esther , until you are a woman , we will only think of your mother : when you are about to be married and leave me , we will speak of her , and I will deliver to you her ring and all that was hers ; but , without a great command laid upon me , I can not pierce my heart by speaking of that which was and is not . "
36268	36271	36252	36252	congregation	1502	" deputation , "
36818	36826	36858	36858	She	1623	" Have pity on me , sir . "
36867	36885	36858	36858	She	1623	" Sir , I die with hunger ; in the name of God take the little one . "
36913	36924	36902	36903	Mr Lyon	201	" Can you walk by my side , young woman ? "
36932	36937	36939	36940	Mr Lyon	201	" Lean on me , "
37211	37241	37206	37206	her	1630	" I knew you had a good heart when you took your hat off . You seemed to me as the image of the bien - aimé Saint Jean . "
37372	37379	37381	37381	she	1630	" O , you are good ! "
37391	37401	37381	37381	she	1630	" Is there in the world a prettier marmot ? "
39904	39911	39913	39913	Annette	253	" You do nurse baby well , "
39917	39926	39913	39913	Annette	253	" Yet you never nursed before I came ? "
39927	39930	39932	39933	Mr Lyon	201	" No , "
39935	39943	39932	39933	Mr Lyon	201	" I had no brothers and sisters . "
39944	39951	39952	39952	Annette	253	" Why were you not married ? "
39962	39986	39987	39987	Annette	253	" Because I never loved any woman — till now . I thought I should never marry . Now I wish to marry . "
40043	40059	40134	40135	Mr Lyon	201	" Do you think it foolish , Annette , that I should wish to marry ? "
40060	40067	40068	40068	she	253	" I did not expect it , "
40073	40083	40068	40068	she	253	" I did not know you thought about it . "
40084	40095	40134	40135	Mr Lyon	201	" You know the woman I should like to marry ? "
40096	40101	40102	40102	she	253	" I know her ? "
40110	40133	40102	40102	she	253	" It is you , Annette — you whom I have loved better than my duty . I forsook everything for you . "
40158	40172	40138	40138	he	201	" Can you love me , Annette ? Will you be my wife ? "
40179	40187	40189	40190	Mr Lyon	201	" Do not speak — forget it , "
40200	40217	40189	40190	Mr Lyon	201	" No , no — I do not want it — I do not wish it . "
40412	40418	40420	40420	Annette	253	" No — no relation , "
40426	40434	40420	40420	Annette	253	" He has been good to me . "
40435	40444	40401	40405	the sick man 's wife	1747	" How long have you lived with him ? "
40445	40451	40420	40420	Annette	253	" More than a year . "
40452	40459	40420	40420	Annette	253	" Was he a preacher once ? "
40460	40463	40401	40405	the sick man 's wife	1747	" Yes . "
40464	40474	40420	40420	Annette	253	" When did he leave off being a preacher ? "
40475	40484	40420	40420	Annette	253	" Soon after he took care of me . "
40485	40491	40401	40405	the sick man 's wife	1747	" Is that his child ? "
40492	40495	40497	40497	Annette	253	" Sir , "
40502	40508	40497	40497	Annette	253	" I am a widow . "
40611	40716	40596	40596	her	253	" I am getting very wise ; I have sold some of the books to make money — the doctor told me where ; and I have looked into the shops where they sell caps and bonnets and pretty things , and I can do all that , and get more money to keep us . And when you are well enough to get up , we will go out and be married — shall we not ? See ! and la petite ( the baby had never been named anything else ) shall call you Papa — and then we shall never part . "
40791	40878	40783	40783	her	253	" No : in France , in other days , I would have minded ; but all is changed . I never was fond of religion , but I knew it was right . J'aimais les fleurs , les bals , la musique , et mon mari qui était beau . But all that is gone away . There is nothing of my religion in this country . But the good God must be here , for you are good ; I leave all to you . "
41451	41476	41447	41447	his	199	" Though she be dead , yet let me think she lives , And feed my mind , that dies for want of her . "
41667	41678	41657	41657	he	1780	" Sir Maximus and his lady — did you see ? "
41687	41697	41698	41699	Lady Debarry	149	" We shall find her greatly elated , doubtless , "
41703	41713	41698	41699	Lady Debarry	149	" She has been in the shade so long . "
41714	41720	41722	41723	Sir Maximus	150	" Ah , poor thing ! "
41725	41774	41722	41723	Sir Maximus	150	" A fine woman she was in her bloom . I remember the first county ball she attended we were all ready to fight for the sake of dancing with her . I always liked her from that time — I never swallowed the scandal about her myself . "
41775	41785	41787	41788	Lady Debarry	149	" If we are to be intimate with her , "
41790	41814	41787	41788	Lady Debarry	149	" I wish you would avoid making such allusions , Sir Maximus . I should not like Selina and Harriet to hear them . "
41815	41836	41838	41839	the Baronet	1786	" My dear , I should have forgotten all about the scandal , only you remind me of it sometimes , "
41850	41864	41866	41867	Lady Debarry	149	" These sudden turns of fortune are often dangerous to an excitable constitution , "
41878	41967	41866	41867	Lady Debarry	149	" Poor Lady Alicia Methurst got heart - disease from a sudden piece of luck — the death of her uncle , you know . If Mrs Transome were wise she would go to town — she can afford it now — and consult Dr Truncheon . I should say myself he would order her digitalis : I have often guessed exactly what a prescription would be . But it certainly was always one of her weak points to think that she understood medicine better than other people . "
41968	41994	41873	41873	her	149	" She 's a healthy woman enough , surely : see how upright she is , and she rides about like a girl of twenty . "
41995	42006	41866	41867	Lady Debarry	149	" She is so thin that she makes me shudder . "
42007	42025	41866	41867	Lady Debarry	149	" Pooh ! she 's slim and active ; women are not bid for by the pound . "
42026	42034	42035	42036	Sir Maximus	150	" Pray do n't be so coarse . "
42165	42179	42181	42182	Sir Maximus	150	" Well , our lucky youngster is come in the nick of time , "
42184	42205	42181	42182	Sir Maximus	150	" if he 'll stand , he and Philip can run in harness together and keep out both the Whigs . "
42206	42220	42222	42223	Lady Debarry	149	" It is really quite a providential thing — his returning just now , "
42225	42250	42222	42223	Lady Debarry	149	" I could n't help thinking that something would occur to prevent Philip from having such a man as Peter Garstin for his colleague . "
42251	42260	42262	42263	Sir Maximus	150	" I call my friend Harold a youngster , "
42265	42284	42262	42263	Sir Maximus	150	" for , you know , I remember him only as he was when that portrait was taken . "
42285	42293	42295	42296	Mrs Transome	145	" That is a long while ago , "
42298	42310	42295	42296	Mrs Transome	145	" My son is much altered , as you may imagine . "
42350	42445	42337	42337	her	145	" Yes , yes , on the outside , I daresay . But he was a fine fellow — I always liked him . And if anybody had asked me what I should choose for the good of the country , I could n't have thought of anything better than having a young Transome for a neighbour who will take an active part . The Transomes and the Debarrys were always on the right side together in old days . Of course he 'll stand — he has made up his mind to it ? "
42621	42655	42611	42611	he	4894	" Dear me , what a splendid little boy , Mrs Transome ! why — it can not be — can it be — that you have the happiness to be a grandmamma ? "
42656	42667	42611	42611	he	4894	" Yes ' that is my son 's little boy . "
42668	42671	42673	42674	Lady Debarry	149	" Indeed ! "
42679	42703	42673	42674	Lady Debarry	149	" I never heard you speak of his marriage . He has brought you home a daughter - in - law , then ? "
42704	42707	42709	42710	Mrs Transome	145	" No , "
42714	42719	42709	42710	Mrs Transome	145	" she is dead . "
42720	42727	42729	42730	Lady Debarry	149	" O — o — oh ! "
42746	42783	42729	42730	Lady Debarry	149	" How very singular — I mean that we should not have heard of Mr Harold 's marriage . But he 's a charming little fellow : come to me , you round - cheeked cherub . "
42831	42838	42844	42844	they	1803	" Nau - o - oom , "
42858	42863	42844	42844	they	1803	" naughty old woman , "
42898	42914	42916	42917	Mrs Transome	145	" Go , go , Harry ; let poor Puff alone — he'll bite you , "
43000	43007	43009	43010	Lady Debarry	149	" I fear you are hurt , "
43016	43041	43009	43010	Lady Debarry	149	" What a little savage ! Do have your arm attended to , my dear — I recommend fomentation — don't think of me . "
43042	43051	43053	43054	Mrs Transome	145	" O thank you , it is nothing , "
43063	43106	43053	43054	Mrs Transome	145	" it will soon go off . The pleasures of being a grandmamma , you perceive . The child has taken a dislike to me ; but he makes quite a new life for Mr Transome ; they were playfellows at once . "
43107	43112	43114	43115	Sir Maximus	150	" Bless my heart ! "
43117	43175	43114	43115	Sir Maximus	150	" it is odd to think of Harold having been a family man so long . I made up my mind he was a young bachelor . What an old stager I am , to be sure ! And whom has he married ? I hope we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing Mrs Harold Transome . "
43195	43202	43203	43204	Lady Debarry	149	" She is no longer living , "
43208	43285	43203	43204	Lady Debarry	149	" but now , my dear Sir Maximus , we must not hinder Mrs Transome from attending to her arm . I am sure she is in pain . Do n't say another word , my dear — we shall see you again — you and Mr Harold will come and dine with us on Thursday — say yes , only yes . Sir Maximus is longing to see him ; and Philip will be down . "
43286	43291	43293	43294	Sir Maximus	150	" Yes , yes ! "
43296	43343	43293	43294	Sir Maximus	150	" he must lose no time in making Philip 's acquaintance . Tell him Philip is a fine fellow — carried everything before him at Oxford . And your son must be returned along with him for North Loamshire . You said he meant to stand ? "
43344	43368	43370	43371	Mrs Transome	145	" I will write and let you know if Harold has any engagement for Thursday ; he would of course be happy otherwise , "
43377	43393	43370	43371	Mrs Transome	145	" If not Thursday , the next day — the very first day he can . "
43421	43433	43434	43434	she	145	" This is the last visit I shall receive from them , "
43451	43462	43464	43465	Lady Debarry	149	" That poor creature is not happy , Sir Maximus , "
43471	43556	43464	43465	Lady Debarry	149	" Something annoys her about her son . I hope there is nothing unpleasant in his character . Either he kept his marriage a secret from her , or she was ashamed of it . He is thirty - four at least by this time . After living in the East so long he may have become a sort of person one would not care to be intimate with ; and that savage boy — he does n't look like a lady 's child . "
43557	43563	43565	43566	Sir Maximus	150	" Pooh , my dear , "
43568	43786	43565	43566	Sir Maximus	150	" women think so much of those minutiæ . In the present state of the country it is our duty to look at man 's position and politics . Philip and my brother are both of that opinion , and I think they know what 's right , if any man does . We are bound to regard every man of our party as a public instrument , and to pull all together . The Transomes have always been a good Tory family , but it has been a cipher of late years . This young fellow coming back with a fortune to give the family a head and a position is a clear gain to the county ; and with Philip he 'll get into the right hands — of course he wants guiding , having been out of the country so long . All we have to ask is , whether a man 's a Tory , and will make a stand for the good of the country?—that 's the plain English of the matter . And I do beg of you , my dear , to set aside all these gossiping niceties , and exert yourself , like a woman of sense and spirit as you are , to bring the right people together . "
43925	43933	43934	43935	Lady Debarry	149	" I am sure , Sir Maximus , "
43938	43955	43934	43935	Lady Debarry	149	" you could not have observed that anything was wanting in my manners of Mrs Transome . "
43956	44065	44066	44068	Good Sir Maximus	150	" No , no , my dear ; but I say this by way of caution . Never mind what was done at Smyrna , or whether Transome , likes to sit with his heels tucked up . We may surely wink at a few things for the sake of the public interest , if God Almighty does ; and if He did n't , I do n't know what would have become of the country — Government could never have been carried on , and many a good battle would have been lost . That 's the philosophy of the matter , and the common sense too . "
44145	44152	44154	44161	this personage , standing uncovered at the carriage	1817	" Excuse me , Sir Maximus , "
44165	44189	44154	44161	this personage , standing uncovered at the carriage	1817	" but I have just learned something of importance at Treby which I thought you would like to know as soon as possible . "
44190	44203	44205	44206	Sir Maximus	150	" Ah ! what 's that ? Something about Garstin or Clement ? "
44218	44253	44154	44161	this personage , standing uncovered at the carriage	1817	" No ; rather worse , I fear you will think . A new Radical candidate . I got this by a stratagem from the printer 's boy . They 're not posted yet . "
44254	44258	44260	44261	Sir Maximus	150	" A Radical ! "
44277	44286	44271	44271	he	150	" What fool is he?—he'll have no chance . "
44287	44296	44154	44161	this personage , standing uncovered at the carriage	1817	" They say he 's richer than Garstin . "
44297	44301	44303	44304	Sir Maximus	150	" Harold Transome ! "
44317	44377	44307	44307	he	150	" I do n't believe it — it 's a trick — it 's a squib : why — why — we've just been to his place — eh ? do you know any more ? Speak , sir — speak ; do n't deal out your story like a damned mountebank , who wants to keep people gaping . "
44378	44389	44391	44392	Lady Debarry	149	" Sir Maximus , pray do n't give way so , "
44394	44407	44409	44409	Christian	264	" I 'm afraid there 's no doubt about it , sir , "
44411	44479	44409	44409	Christian	264	" After getting the bill , I met Mr Labron 's clerk , and he said he had just had the whole story from Jermyn 's clerk . The Ram Inn is engaged already , and a committee is being made up . He says Jermyn goes like a steam - engine , when he has a mind , although he makes such long - winded speeches . "
44480	44523	44307	44307	he	150	" Jermyn be hanged for a two - faced rascal ! Tell Mitchell to drive on . It 's of no use to stay chattering here . Jump up on the box and go home with us . I may want you . "
44524	44534	44536	44537	the Baronet	1786	" You see I was right , Sir Maximus , "
44541	44555	44536	44537	the Baronet	1786	" I had an instinct that we should find him an unpleasant person . "
44556	44582	44307	44307	he	150	" Fudge ! if you had such a fine instinct , why did you let us go to Transome Court and make fools of ourselves ? "
44583	44604	44307	44307	he	150	" Would you have listened to me ? But of course you will not have him to dine with you ? "
44605	44692	44307	44307	he	150	" Dine with me ? I should think not . I 'd sooner he should dine off me . I see how it is clearly enough . He has become a regular beast among those Mahometans — he 's got neither religion nor morals left . He ca n't know anything about English politics . He 'll go and cut his own nose off as a landholder , and never know . However , he wo n't get in — he'll spend his money for nothing . "
44693	44703	44705	44706	Lady Debarry	149	" I fear he is a very licentious man , "
44708	44730	44705	44706	Lady Debarry	149	" We know now why his mother seemed so uneasy . I should think she reflects a little , poor creature . "
44731	44800	44802	44803	Sir Maximus	150	" It 's a confounded nuisance we did n't meet Christian on our way , instead of coming back ; but better now than later . He 's an uncommonly adroit , useful fellow , that factotum of Philip 's . I wish Phil would take my man and give me Christian . I 'd make him house - steward ; he might reduce the accounts a little . "
45118	45124	45143	45143	he	150	" good evening , gentlemen , "
45529	45532	45534	45535	Mr Crowder	272	" Why , "
45568	45588	45589	45589	he	272	" why , I suppose they get money so fast in the East — it 's wonderful . Why , "
45601	45614	45589	45589	he	272	" this Transome has p'raps got a matter of a hundred thousand . "
45615	45634	45636	45637	Mr Scales	270	" A hundred thousand , my dear sir ! fiddle - stick 's end of a hundred thousand , "
45652	45655	45657	45658	Mr Crowder	272	" Well , "
45677	45685	45666	45670	the all - knowing butler	1874	" perhaps not so much as that . "
45686	45705	45666	45670	the all - knowing butler	1874	" Not so much , sir ! I tell you that a hundred thousand pounds is a bagatelle . "
45706	45717	45719	45720	Mr Crowder	272	" Well , I know it 's a big sum , "
45744	45755	45757	45758	Mr Christian	264	" Bagatelle is the French for trifle , my friend , "
45760	45783	45757	45758	Mr Christian	264	" Do n't talk over people 's heads so , Scales . I shall have hard work to understand you myself soon . "
45784	45792	45794	45797	the head - gardener	1876	" Come , that 's good one , "
45805	45820	45757	45758	Mr Christian	264	" I should like to hear the thing you do n't understand , Christian . "
45821	45832	45834	45835	Mr Scales	270	" He 's a first - rate hand at sneering , "
45840	45874	45876	45877	Mr Christian	264	" Do n't be waspish , man . I 'll ring the bell for lemons , and make some punch . That 's the thing for putting people up to the unknown tongues , "
45892	45903	45876	45877	Mr Christian	264	" What I mean , Mr Crowder , is this . "
45939	45954	45956	45958	the reasonable Crowder	1879	" Come , then , speak English ; I 'm not against being taught , "
45960	46003	45956	45958	the reasonable Crowder	1879	" What I mean is , that in a large way of trade a man turns his capital over almost as soon as he can turn himself . Bless your soul ! I know something about these matters , eh , Brent ? "
46004	46015	46017	46018	the gardener	1880	" To be sure you do — few men more , "
46027	46131	46017	46018	the gardener	1880	" Not that I 've had anything to do with commercial families myself . I 've those feelings that I look to other things besides lucre . But I ca n't say that I 've not been intimate with parties who have been less nice than I am myself ; and knowing what I know , I should n't wonder if Transome had as much as five hundred thousand . Bless your soul , sir ! people who get their money out of land are as long scraping five pounds together as your trading men are in turning five pounds into a hundred . "
46132	46141	46143	46144	Mr Crowder	272	" That 's a wicked thing , though , "
46148	46151	46152	46152	he	272	" However , "
46162	46200	46152	46152	he	272	" trade or no trade , the Transomes have been poor enough this many a long year . I 've a brother a tenant on their estate — I ought to know a little bit about that . "
46201	46211	46213	46214	Mr Scales	270	" They 've kept up no establishment at all , "
46219	46268	46213	46214	Mr Scales	270	" They 've even let their kitchen gardens . I suppose it was the eldest son 's gambling . I 've seen something of that . A man who has always lived in first - rate families is likely to know a thing or two on that subject . "
46269	46282	46284	46285	Mr Crowder	272	" Ah , but it was n't gambling did the first mischief , "
46303	46361	46284	46285	Mr Crowder	272	" New - comers do n't know what happened in this country twenty and thirty year ago . I 'm turned fifty myself , and my father lived under Sir Maxum 's father . But if anybody from London can tell me more than I know about this country - side , I 'm willing to listen . "
46362	46375	46377	46378	Mr Scales	270	" What was it , then , if it was n't gambling ? "
46384	46392	46377	46378	Mr Scales	270	" I do n't pretend to know . "
46393	46414	46284	46285	Mr Crowder	272	" It was law — law — that 's what it was . Not but what the Transomes always won . "
46415	46420	46422	46426	the too - ready Scales	1882	" And always lost , "
46428	46443	46422	46426	the too - ready Scales	1882	" Yes , yes ; I think we all know the nature of law . "
46444	46461	46463	46464	Mr Crowder	272	" There was the last suit of all made the most noise , as I understood , "
46466	46566	46463	46464	Mr Crowder	272	" but it was n't tried hereabout . They said there was a deal o'false swearing . Some young man pretended to be the true heir — let me see — I ca n't justly remember the names — he'd got two . He swore he was one man , and they swore he was another . However , Lawyer Jermyn won it — they say he 'd win a game against the Old One himself — and the young fellow turned out to be a scamp . Stop a bit — his name was Scaddon — Henry Scaddon . "
46597	46606	46607	46607	he	264	" Hallo ! What a bungler I am ! "
46624	46640	46607	46607	he	264	" Go on with your tale , Mr Crowder — a scamp named Harry Scaddon . "
46641	46649	46651	46652	Mr Crowder	272	" Well , that 's the tale , "
46654	46765	46651	46652	Mr Crowder	272	" He was never seen nothing of any more . It was a deal talked of at the time — and I 've sat by ; and my father used to shake his head ; and always when this Mrs Transome was talked of , he used to shake his head , and say she carried things with a high hand once . But , Lord ! it was before the battle of Waterloo , and I 'm a poor hand at tales ; I do n't see much good in 'em myself — but if anybody'll tell me a cure for the sheep - rot I 'll thank him . "
46798	46816	46818	46819	Mr Scales	270	" Well , well , bygones should be bygones ; there are secrets in most good families , "
46823	46901	46818	46819	Mr Scales	270	" and this young Transome , coming back with a fortune to keep up the establishment , and have things done in a decent and gentlemanly way — it would all have been right if he 'd not been this sort of Radical madman . But now he 's done for himself . I heard Sir Maximus say at dinner that he would be excommunicated ; and that 's a pretty strong word , I take it . "
46902	46910	46912	46913	Mr Christian	264	" What does it mean , Scales ? "
46919	46927	46929	46930	Mr Crowder	272	" Ay , what 's the meaning ? "
46943	46968	46929	46930	Mr Crowder	272	" Well , it 's a law term — speaking in a figurative sort of way — meaning that a Radical was no gentleman . "
46969	46989	46991	46992	Mr Crowder	272	" Perhaps it 's partly accounted for by his getting his money so fast , and in foreign countries , "
46996	47016	46991	46992	Mr Crowder	272	" It 's reasonable to think he 'd be against the land and this country — eh , Sircome ? "
47089	47131	47081	47081	He	278	" I say nothing . Before I bring words to market , I should like to see 'em a bit scarcer . There 's the land and there 's trade — I hold with both . I swim with the stream . "
47132	47146	47148	47149	Mr Christian	264	" Hey - day , Mr Sircome ! that 's a Radical maxim , "
47164	47183	47081	47081	He	278	" I advise you to give it up , else it will injure the quality of your flour . "
47184	47189	47191	47192	Mr Sircome	278	" A Radical maxim ! "
47201	47221	47191	47192	Mr Sircome	278	" I should like to hear you prove that . It 's as old as my grandfather , anyhow . "
47222	47231	47233	47235	the glib Christian	1891	" I 'll prove it in one minute , "
47237	47333	47233	47235	the glib Christian	1891	" Reform has set in by the will of the majority — that 's the rabble , you know ; and the respectability and good sense of the country , which are in the minority , are afraid of Reform running on too fast . So the stream must be running towards Reform and Radicalism ; and if you swim with it , Mr Sircome , you 're a Reformer and a Radical , and your flour is objectionable , and not full weight — and being tried by Scales , will be found wanting . "
47392	47403	47405	47406	the gardener	1880	" What a fellow your are for fence , Christian , "
47408	47423	47405	47406	the gardener	1880	" Hang me , if I do n't think you 're up to everything . "
47424	47441	47443	47444	Mr Sircome	278	" That 's a compliment you might pay Old Nick , if you come to that , "
47460	47465	47467	47468	Mr Scales	270	" Yes , yes , "
47513	47514	47503	47503	I	0	" "
47519	47528	47503	47503	I	0	" said Christian , ladling out the punch . "
47536	47557	47534	47534	Scales	270	" The laughter was not quite so full - throated as before . Such excessive cleverness was a little Satanic . "
47566	47574	47575	47575	I	0	" said the butler , getting exasperated ; "
47615	47616	47600	47601	a party	1899	" "
47625	47645	47650	47650	Scales	270	" said the surgeon 's assistant , a fast man , whose chief scene of dissipation was the Manor . "
47652	47653	47650	47650	Scales	270	" "
47731	47867	47868	47868	I	0	" There was a stricter sequence in Mr Scales 's angry eloquence than was apparent — some chief links being confined to his own breast , as is often the case in energetic discourse . The company were in a state of expectation . There was something behind worth knowing , and something before them worth seeing . In the general decay of other fine British pugnacious sports , a quarrel between gentlemen was all the more exciting , and though no one would himself have liked to turn on Scales , no one was sorry for the chance of seeing him put down . But the amazing Christian was unmoved . He had taken out his handkerchief and was rubbing his lips carefully . After a slight pause , he spoke with perfect coolness . "
47955	47983	47952	47953	the ladies	5084	" As the door closed behind the questionable Christian , Mr Scales was in a state of frustration that prevented speech . Every one was rather embarrassed . "
47994	48013	47986	47992	a most uncommon sort o ' fellow	1911	" said Mr Crowder , in an under - tone , to his next neighbour , the gardener . "
48029	48030	48027	48027	he	175	" "
48036	48041	48033	48034	a courier	1912	" said the gardener . "
48089	48090	48084	48084	he	175	" "
48101	48106	48097	48099	a cool chap	1913	" said Mr Crowder . "
48116	48138	48139	48139	He	175	" said Mr Sircome , also sotto voce , to his next neighbour , Mr Filmore , the surgeon 's assistant . "
48169	48170	48155	48155	He	175	" "
48184	48201	48176	48176	he	175	" said Mr Filmore , whose whiskers and shirt - pin were quite above the average . "
48238	48239	48244	48244	his	175	" "
48247	48672	48673	48673	folks	5764	" said Mr Sircome . The conversation had in this way broken up into tête - à - tête , and the hilarity of the evening might be considered a failure . Still the punch was drunk , the accounts were duly swelled , and , notwithstanding the innovating spirit of the time , Sir Maximus Debarry 's establishment was kept up in a sound hereditary British manner . Shakespeare . The mind of a man is as a country which was once open to squatters , who have bred and multiplied and become masters of the land . But then happeneth a time when new and hungry comers dispute the land ; and there is trial of strength , and the stronger wins . Nevertheless the first squatters be they who have prepared the ground , and the crops to the end will be sequent ( though chiefly on the nature of the soil , as of light sand , mixed loam , or heavy clay , yet ) somewhat on the primal labour and sowing . That talkative maiden , Rumour , though in the interest of art she is figured as a youthful winged beauty with flowing garments , soaring above the heads of men , and breathing world - thrilling news through a gracefully - curved trumpet , is in fact a very old maid , who puckers her silly face by the fireside , and really does no more than chirp a wrong guess or a lame story into the ear of a fellow - gossip ; all the rest of the work attributed to her is done by the ordinary working of those passions against which men pray in the Litany , with the help of a plentiful stuipidity against which we have never yet had any authorised form of prayer . When Mr Scales 's strong need to make an impressive figure in conversation , together with his very slight need of any other premise than his own sense of his wide general knowledge and probable infallibility , led him to specify five hundred thousand as the lowest admissible amount of Harold Transome 's commercially - acquired fortune , it was not fair to put this down to poor old Miss Rumour , who had only told Scales that the fortune was considerable . And again , when the curt Mr Sircome found occasion at Treby to mention the five hundred thousand as a fact that folks seemed pretty sure about , this expansion of the butler into "
48674	49108	48244	48244	his	175	" was entirely due to Mr Sircome 's habitual preference for words which could not be laid hold of or give people a handle over him . It was in this simple way that the report of Harold Transome 's fortune spread and was manified , adding much lustre to his opinions in the eyes of Liberals , and compelling even men of the opposite party to admit that it increased his eligibility as a member for North Loamshire . It was observed by a sound thinker in these parts that property was ballast ; and when once the aptness of that metaphor had been perceived , it followed that a man was not fit to navigate the sea of politics without a great deal of such ballast ; and that , rightly understood , whatever increased the expense of election , inasmuch as it virtually raised the property qualification , was an unspeakable boon to the country . Meanwhile the fortune that was getting larger in the imagination of constituents was shrinking a little in the imagination of its owner . It was hardly more than a hundred and fifty thousand ; and there were not only the heavy mortgages to be paid off , but also a large amount of capital was needed in order to repair the farm - buildings all over the estate , to carry out extensive draining , and make allowances to incoming tenants , which might remove the difficulty of newly letting the farms in a time of agricultural depression . The farms actually tenanted were held by men who had begged hard to succeed their fathers in getting a little poorer every year , on land which was also getting poorer , where the highest rate of increase was in the arrears of rent , and where the master , in crushed hat and corduroys , looked pitiably lean and care - worn by the side of pauper labourers , who showed that superior assimilating power often observed to attend nourishment by the public money . Mr Goffe , of Rabbit 's End , had never had it explained to him that , according to the true theory of rent , land must inevitably be given up when it would not yield a profit equal to the ordinary rate of interest ; so that from want of knowing what was inevitable , and not from a Titanic spirit of opposition , he kept on his land . He often said of himself , with a melancholy wipe of his sleeve across his brow , that he "
49120	49345	48244	48244	his	175	" and he would have been still more at a loss on the subject if he had quitted Rabbit 's End with a waggonful of furniture and utensils , a file of receipts , a wife with five children , and a shepherd - dog in low spirits . It took no long time for Harold Transome to discover this state of things , and to see , moreover , that , except on the demesne immediately around the house , the timber had been mismanaged . The woods had been recklessly thinned , and there had been insufficient planting . He had not yet thoroughly investigated the various accounts kept by his mother , by Jermyn , and by Banks the bailiff ; but what had been done with the large sums which had been received for timber was a suspicious mystery to him . He observed that the farm held by Jermyn was in first - rate order , that a good deal had been spent on the buildings , and that the rent had stood unpaid . Mrs Transome had taken an opportunity of saying that Jermyn had had some of the mortgage - deeds transferred to him , and that his rent was set against so much interest . Harold had only said , in his careless yet decisive way , "
49422	49599	49639	49639	Harold	145	" Mrs Transome said no more . Harold did not care to enter fully into the subject with his mother . The fact that she had been active in the management of the estate — had ridden about it continually , had busied herself with accounts , had been head - bailiff of the vacant farms , and had yet allowed things to go wrong — was set down by him simply to the general futility of women 's attempts to transact men 's business . He did not want to say anything to annoy her : he was only determined to let her understand , as quietly as possible , that she had better cease all interference . Mrs Transome did understand this ; and it was very little that she dared to say on business , though there was a fierce struggle of her anger and pride with a dread which was nevertheless supreme . As to the old tenants , she only observed , on hearing Harold burst forth about their wretched condition , "
49630	49631	49632	49632	I	0	" "
49641	49651	49639	49639	Harold	145	" she ended , with a touch of bitterness . "
49729	49730	49723	49723	I	0	" "
49791	49807	49808	49809	a woman	4915	" Harold added , smiling and handing her a ball of worsted which had fallen , "
49875	50706	49865	49865	I	0	" Harold thought it was only natural that his mother should have been in a sort of subjection to Jermyn throughout the awkward circumstances of the family . It was the way of women , and all weak minds , to think that what they had been used to was inalterable , and any quarrel with a man who managed private affairs was necessarily a formidable thing . He himself was proceeding very cautiously , and preferred not even to know too much just at present , lest a certain personal antipathy he was conscious of towards Jermyn , and an occasional liability to exasperation , should get the better of a calm and clear - sighted resolve not to quarrel with the man while he could be of use . Harold would have been disgusted with himself if he had helped to frustrate his own purpose . And his strongest purpose now was to get returned for Parliament , to make a figure there as a Liberal member , and to become on all grounds a personage of weight in North Loamshire . How Harold Transome came to be a Liberal in opposition to all the traditions of his family , was a more subtle inquiry than he had ever cared to follow out . The newspapers undertook to explain it . The North Loamshire Herald witnessed with a grief and disgust certain to be shared by all persons who were actuated by whole - some British feeling , an example of defection in the inheritor of a family name which in times past had been associated with attachment to right principle , and with the maintenance of our constitution in Church and State ; and pointed to it as an additional proof that men who had passed any large portion of their lives beyond the limits of our favoured country , usually contracted not only a laxity of feeling towards Protestantism , nay , towards religion itself — a latitudinarian spirit hardly distinguishable from atheism — but also a levity of disposition , inducing them to tamper with those institutions by which alone Great Britain had risen to her pre - eminence among the nations . Such men , infected with outlandish habits , intoxicated with vanity , grasping at momentary power by flattery of the multitude , fearless because godless , liberal because un - English , were ready to pull one stone from under another in the national edifice , till the great structure tottered to its fall . On the other hand , the Duffield Watchman saw in this signal instance of self - liberation from the trammels of prejudice , a decisive guarantee of intellectual pre eminence , united with a generous sensibility to the claims of man as man , which had burst asunder , and cast off , by a spontaneous exertion of energy , the cramping out - worn shell of hereditary bias and class interest . But these large - minded guides of public opinion argued from wider data than could be furnished by any knowledge of the particular case concerned . Harold Transome was neither the dissolute cosmopolitan so vigorously sketched by the Tory Herald , nor the intellectual giant and moral lobster suggested by the liberal imagination of the Watchman . Twenty years ago he had been a bright , active , good - tempered lad , with sharp eyes and a good aim ; he delighted in success and in predominance ; but he did not long for an impossible predominance , and become sour and sulky because it was impossible . He played at the games he was clever in , and usually won ; all other games he let alone , and thought them of little worth . At home and at Eton he had been side by side with his stupid elder brother Durfey , whom he despised ; and he very early began to reflect that since this Caliban in miniature was older than himself , he must carve out his own fortune . That was a nuisance ; and on the whole the world seemed rather ill - arranged , at Eton especially , where there were many reasons why Harold made no great figure . He was not sorry the money was wanting to send him to Oxford ; he did not see the good of Oxford ; he had been surrounded by many things during his short life , of which he had distinctly said to himself that he did not see the good , and he was not disposed to venerate on the strength of any good that others saw . He turned his back on home very cheerfully , though he was rather fond of his mother , and very fond of Transome Court , and the river where he had been used to fish ; but he said to himself as he passed the lodge - gates , "
50729	52121	52122	52122	You	1940	" This determined aiming at something not easy but clearly possible , marked the direction in which Harold 's nature was strong ; he had the energetic will and muscle , the self - confidence , the quick perception , and the narrow imagination which make what is admiringly called the practical mind . Since then his character had been ripened by a various experience , and also by much knowledge which he had set himself deliberately to gain . But the man was no more than the boy writ large , with an extensive commentary . The years had nourished an inclination to as much opposition as would enable him to assert his own independence and power without throwing himself into that tabooed condition which robs power of its triumph . And this inclination had helped his shrewdness in forming judgments which were at once innovating and moderate . He was addicted at once to rebellion and to conformity , and only an intimate personal knowledge could enable any one to predict where his conformity would begin . The limit was not defined by theory , but was drawn in an irregular zigzag by early disposition and association ; and his resolution , of which he had never lost hold , to be a thorough Englishman again some day , had kept up the habit of considering all his conclusions with reference to English politics and English social conditions . He meant to stand up for every change that the economical condition of the country required , and he had an angry contempt for men with coronets on their coaches , but too small a share of brains to see when they had better make a virtue of necessity . His respect was rather for men who had no coronets , but who achieved a just influence by furthering all measures which the common sense of the country , and the increasing self - assertion of the majority , peremptorily demanded . He could be such a man himself . In fact Harold Transome was a clever , frank , good - natured egoist ; not stringently consistent , but without any disposition to falsity ; proud , but with a pride that was moulded in an individual rather than an hereditary form ; unspeculative , unsentimental , unsympathetic ; fond of sensual pleasures , but disinclined to all vice , and attached as a healthy , clear - sighted person , to all conventional morality , construed with a certain freedom , like doctrinal articles to which the public order may require subscription . A character is apt to look but indifferently , written out in this way . Reduced to a map , our premises seem insignificant , but they make , nevertheless , a very pretty freehold to live in and walk over ; and so , if Harold Transome had been among your acquaintances , and you had observed his qualities through the medium of his agreeable person , bright smile , and a certain easy charm which accompanies sensuousness when unsullied by coarseness — through the medium also of the many opportunities in which he would have made himself useful or pleasant to you — you would have thought him a good fellow , highly acceptable as a guest , a colleague , or a brother - in - law . Whether all mothers would have liked him as a son , is another question . It is a fact perhaps kept a little too much in the background , that mothers have a self larger than their maternity , and that when their sons have become taller than themselves , and are gone from them to college or into the world , there are wide spaces of their time which are not filled with praying for their boys , reading old letters , and envying yet blessing those who are attending to their shirtbuttons . Mrs Transome was certainly not one of those bland , adoring , and gently tearful women . After sharing the common dream that when a beautiful man - child was born to her , her cup of happiness would be full , she had travelled through long years apart from that child to find herself at last in the presence of a son of whom she was afraid , who was utterly unmanageable by her , and to whose sentiments in any given case she possessed no key . Yet Harold was a kind son : he kissed his mother 's brow , offered her his arm , let her choose what she liked for the house and garden , asked her whether she would have bays or greys for her new carriage , and was bent on seeing her make as good a figure in the neighbourhood as any other woman of her rank . She trembled under this kindness : it was not enough to satisfy her ; still , if it should ever cease and give place to something else — she was too uncertain about Harold 's feelings to imagine clearly what that something would be . The finest threads , such as no eye sees , if bound cunningly about the sensitive flesh , so that the movement to break them would bring torture , may make a worse bondage than any fetters . Mrs Transome felt the fatal threads about her , and the bitterness of this helpless bondage mingled itself with the new elegancies of the dining and drawing rooms , and all the household changes which Harold had ordered to be brought about with magical quickness . Nothing was as she had once expected it would be . If Harold had shown the least care to have her stay in the room with him — if he had really cared for her opinion — if he had been what she had dreamed he would be in the eyes of those people who had made her world — if all the past could be dissolved , and leave no solid trace of itself — mighty ifs that were all impossible — she would have tasted some joy ; but now she began to look back with regret to the days when she sat in loneliness among the old drapery , and still longed for something that might happen . Yet , save in a bitter little speech , or in deep sigh heard by no one besides Denner , she kept all these things hidden in her heart , and went out in the autumn sunshine to overlook the alterations in the pleasure - grounds very much as a happy woman might have done . One day , however , when she was occupied in this way , an occasion came on which she chose to express indirectly a part of her inward care . She was standing on the broad gravel in the afternoon ; the long shadows lay on the grass ; the light seemed the more glorious because of the reddened and golden trees . The gardeners were busy at their pleasant work ; the newly - turned soil gave out an agreeable fragrance ; and little Harry was playing with Nimrod round old Mr Transome , who sat placidly on a low garden - chair . The scene would have made a charming picture of English domestic life , and the handsome , majestic , grey - haired woman ( obviously grandmamma ) would have been especially admired . But the artist would have felt it requisite to turn her face towards her husband and little grandson , and to have given her an elderly amiability of expression which would have divided remark with his exquisite rendering of her Indian shawl . Mrs Transome 's face was turned the other way , and for this reason she only heard an approaching step , and did not see whose it was ; yet it startled her : it was not quick enough to be her son 's step , and besides , Harold was away at Duffield . It was Mr Jermyn 's . King John . King Richard II Matthew Jermyn approached Mrs Transome taking off his hat and smiling . She did not smile , but said , "
52130	52131	52122	52122	You	1940	" "
52167	52168	52153	52153	I	0	" "
52178	52370	52153	52153	I	0	" They turned together , Mr Jermyn still keeping his hat off and holding it behind him ; the air was so soft and agreeable that Mrs Transome herself had nothing but a large veil over her head . They walked for a little while in silence till they were out of sight , under tall trees , and treading noiselessly on fallen leaves . What Jermyn was really most anxious about , was to learn from Mrs Transome whether anything had transpired that was significant of Harold 's disposition towards him , which he suspected to be very far from friendly . Jermyn was not naturally flinty - hearted : at five - and - twenty he had written verses , and had got himself wet through in order not to disappoint a darkeyed woman whom he was proud to believe in love with him ; but a family man with grown - up sons and daughters , a man with a professional position and complicated affairs that make it hard to ascertain the exact relation between property and liabilities , necessarily thinks of himself and what may be impending . "
52378	52391	52371	52371	Harold	145	" he began at last , since Mrs Transome did not speak . "
52418	52419	52407	52407	He	1946	" "
52427	52532	52407	52407	He	1946	" said Mrs Transome . To - day she was more conscious than usual of that bitterness which was always in her mind in Jermyn 's presence , but which was carefully suppressed : — suppressed because she could not endure that the degradation she inwardly felt should ever become visible or audible in acts or words of her own — should ever be reflected in any word or look of his . For years there had been a deep silence about the past between them : on her side , because she remembered ; on his , because he more and more forgot . "
52568	52569	52555	52555	you	0	" "
52623	52655	52657	52657	he	1946	" Jermyn turned to look in Mrs Transome 's face : it was long since he had heard her speak to him as if she were losing her self - command . "
52669	52670	52657	52657	he	1946	" "
52677	52856	52857	52857	My	0	" Mrs Transome said , with concentrated rage , flashing a fierce look at Jermyn . She checked herself : she felt as if she were lighting a torch to flare on her own past folly and misery . It was a resolve which had become a habit , that she would never quarrel with this man — never tell him what she saw him to be . She had kept her woman 's pride and sensibility intact : through all her life there had vibrated the maiden need to have her hand kissed and be the object of chivalry . And so she sank into silence again , trembling . Jermyn felt annoyed — nothing more . There was nothing in his mind corresponding to the intricate meshes of sensitiveness in Mrs Transome 's . He was anything but stupid ; yet he always blundered when he wanted to be delicate or magnanimous ; he constantly sought to soothe others by praising himself . Moral vulgarity cleaved to him like an hereditary odour . He blundered now . "
52862	52873	52857	52857	My	0	" he said , in a tone of bland kindness , "
52947	53234	53235	53235	You	1952	" Every sentence was as pleasant to her as if it had been cut in her bared arm . Some men 's kindness and love - making are more exasperating , more humiliating than others ' derision ; but the pitiable woman who has once made herself secretly dependent on a man who is beneath her in feeling , must bear that humiliation for fear of worse . Coarse kindness is at least better than coarse anger ; and in all private quarrels the duller nature is triumphant by reason of its dulness . Mrs Transome knew in her inmost soul that those relations which had sealed her lips on Jermyn 's conduct in business matters , had been with him a ground for presuming that he should have impunity in any lax dealing into which circumstances had led him . She knew that she herself had endured all the more privation because of his dishonest selfishness . And now , Harold 's long - deferred heirship , and his return with startlingly unexpected penetration , activity , and assertion of mastery , had placed them both in the full presence of a difficulty which had been prepared by the years of vague uncertainty as to issues . In this position , with a great dread hanging over her , which Jermyn knew , and ought to have felt that he had caused her , she was inclined to lash him with indignation , to scorch him with the words that were just the fit names for his doings — inclined all the more when he spoke with an insolent blandness , ignoring all that was truly in her heart . But no sooner did the words "
53241	53253	53254	53254	You	1952	" rise within her than she heard within also the retort , "
53260	53309	53254	53254	You	1952	" Not for all the world beside could she bear to hear that retort uttered from without . What did she do ? With strange sequence to all that rapid tumult , after a few moments ' silence she said , in a gentle and almost tremulous voice , "
53316	53344	53311	53311	me	0	" He gave it immediately , putting on his hat and wondering . For more than twenty years Mrs Transome had never chosen to take his arm . "
53359	53360	53355	53355	me	0	" "
53365	53366	53355	53355	me	0	" "

53421	53422	53423	53424	A man	4886	" "
53434	53457	53423	53424	A man	4886	" said Jermyn , who was already a little irritated by the implication that Harold might be disposed to use him roughly . "
53480	53481	53472	53472	I	0	" "
53485	53497	53482	53483	Good God	1955	" said Mrs Transome , taking her hand from his arm , "
53511	53539	53501	53501	you	1952	" As she took away her hand , Jermyn let his arm fall , put both his hands in his pockets , and shrugging his shoulders said , "
53549	53675	53540	53540	I	0	" Jermyn had turned round his savage side , and the blandness was out of sight . It was this that had always frightened Mrs Transome : there was a possibility of fierce insolence in this man who was to pass with those nearest to her as her indebted servant , but whose brand she secretly bore . She was as powerless with him as she was with her son . This woman , who loved rule , dared not speak another word of attempted persuasion . They were both silent , taking the nearest way into the sunshine again . There was a half - formed wish in both their minds — even in the mother's — that Harold Transome had never been born . "
53684	53699	53700	53700	I	0	" said Jermyn , recovering himself , as they turned into the sunshine again . "
53738	53746	53736	53736	yourself	1958	" he added , smiling at her , "
53772	53773	53736	53736	yourself	1958	" "
53776	53781	53736	53736	yourself	1958	" said Mrs Transome . "
53818	54473	53809	53809	I	0	" And in this way they parted on the gravel , in that pretty scene where they had met . Mrs Transome shivered as she stood alone : all around her , where there had once been brightness and warmth , there were white ashes , and the sunshine looked dreary as it fell on them . Mr Jermyn 's heaviest reflections in riding homeward turned on the possibility of incidents between himself and Harold Transome which would have disagreeable results , requiring him to raise money , and perhaps causing scandal , which in its way might also help to create a monetary deficit . A man of sixty , with a wife whose Duffield connections were of the highest respectability , with a family of tall daughters , an expensive establishment , and a large professional business , owed a great deal more to himself as the mainstay of all those solidities , than to feelings and ideas which were quite unsubstantial . There were many unfortunate coincidences which placed Mr Jermyn in an uncomfortable position just now ; he had not been much to blame , he considered ; if it had not been for a sudden turn of affairs no one would have complained . He defied any man to say that he had intended to wrong people ; he was able to refund , to make reprisals , if they could be fairly demanded . Only he would certainly have preferred that they should not be demanded . A German poet was intrusted with a particularly fine sausage , which he was to convey to the donor 's friend at Paris . In the course of a long journey he smelt the sausage ; he got hungry , and desired to taste it ; he pared a morsel off , then another , and another , in successive moments of temptation , till at last the sausage was , humanly speaking , at an end . The offence had not been premeditated . The poet had never loved meanness , but he loved sausage ; and the result was undeniably awkward . So it was with Matthew Jermyn . He was far from liking that ugly abstraction rascality , but he had liked other things which had suggested nibbling . He had had to do many things in law and in daily life which , in the abstract , he would have condemned ; and indeed he had never been tempted by them in the abstract . Here , in fact , was the inconvenience ; he had sinned for the sake of particular concrete things , and particular concrete consequences were likely to follow . But he was a man of resolution , who , having made out what was the best course to take under a difficulty , went straight to his work . The election must be won : that would put Harold in good - humour , give him something to do , and leave himself more time to prepare for any crisis . He was in anything but low spirits that evening . It was his eldest daughter 's birthday , and the young people had a dance . Papa was delightful — stood up for a quadrille and a country - dance , told stories at supper , and made humorous quotations from his early readings : if these were Latin , he apologised , and translated to the ladies ; so that a deaf lady - visitor from Duffield kept her trumpet up continually , lest she should lose any of Mr Jermyn 's conversation , and wished that her niece Maria had been present , who was young and had a good memory . Still the party was smaller than usual , for some families in Treby refused to visit Jermyn , now that he was concerned for a Radical candidate . "
54491	54563	54474	54474	He	1960	" — Theocritus . One Sunday afternoon Felix Holt rapped at the door of Mr Lyon 's house , although he could hear the voice of the minister preaching in the chapel . He stood with a book under his arm , apparently confident that there was some one in the house to open the door for him . In fact , Esther never went to chapel in the afternoon : that "
54565	54622	53809	53809	I	0	" made her head ache . In these September weeks Felix had got rather intimate with Mr Lyon . They shared the same political sympathies ; and though , to Liberals who had neither freehold nor copyhold , nor leasehold the share in a county election consisted chiefly of that prescriptive amusement of the majority known as "
54626	54728	53809	53809	I	0	" there was still something to be said on the occasion , if not to be done . Perhaps the most delightful friendships are those in which there is much agreement , much disputation , and yet more personal liking ; and the advent of the public - spirited , contradictory , yet affectionate Felix , into Treby life , had made a welcome epoch to the minister . To talk with this young man , who , though hopeful , had a singularity which some might at once have pronounced heresy , but which Mr Lyon persisted in regarding as orthodoxy "
54733	55127	53809	53809	I	0	" was like a good bite to strong teeth after a too plentiful allowance of spoon meat . To cultivate his society with a view to checking his erratic tendencies was a laudable purpose ; but perhaps if Felix had been rapidly subdued and reduced to conformity , little Mr Lyon would have found the conversation much flatter . Esther had not seen so much of their new acquaintance as her father had . But she had begun to find him amusing , and also rather irritating to her woman 's love of conquest . He always opposed and criticised her ; and besides that , he looked at her as if he never saw a single detail about her person — quite as if she were a middle - aged woman in a cap . She did not believe that he had ever admired her hands , or her long neck , or her graceful movements , which had made all the girls at school call her Calypso ( doubtless from their familiarity with ' Telémaque ' ) . Felix ought properly to have been a little in love with her — never mentioning it , of course , because that would have been disagreeable , and his being a regular lover was out of the question . But it was quite clear that , instead of feeling any disadvantage on his own side , he held himself to be immeasurably her superior : and , what was worse , Esther had a secret consciousness that he was her superior . She was all the more vexed at the suspicion that he thought slightly of her ; and wished in her vexation that she could have found more fault with him — that she had not been obliged to admire more and more the varying expressions of his open face and his deliciously good - humoured laugh , always loud at a joke against himself . Besides , she could not help having her curiosity roused by the unusual combinations both in his mind and in his outward position , and she had surprised herself as well as her father one day by suddenly starting up and proposing to walk with him when he was going to pay an afternoon visit to Mrs Holt , to try and soothe her concerning Felix . "
55134	55145	55152	55152	he	1962	" she said to herself when they came away again ; "
55185	55415	55174	55174	I	0	" Esther wished that finished gentleman were among her acquaintances : he would certainly admire her , and make her aware of Felix 's inferiority . On this particular Sunday afternoon , when she heard the knock at the door , she was seated in the kitchen corner between the fire and the window reading ' Réné . ' Certainly , in her well - fitting light - blue dress — she almost always wore some shade of blue — with her delicate sandalled slipper stretched towards the fire , her little gold watch , which had cost her nearly a quarter 's earnings , visible at her side , her slender fingers playing with a shower of brown curls , and a coronet of shining plaits at the summit of her head , she was a remarkable Cinderella . When the rap came , she coloured , and was going to shut her book and put it out of the way on the window - ledge behind her ; but she desisted with a little toss , laid it open on the table beside her , and walked to the outer door , which opened into the kitchen . There was rather a mischievous gleam in her face : the rap was not a small one ; it came probably from a large personage with a vigorous arm . "
55422	55482	55419	55420	Miss Lyon	235	" said Felix , taking off his cloth cap : he resolutely declined the expensive ugliness of a hat , and in a poked cap and without a cravat , made a figure at which his mother cried every Sunday , and thought of with a slow shake of the head at several passages in the minister 's prayer .

If it had been any one but Felix who was near her , it might have occurred to her that this attitude showed her to advantage ; but she had only a mortified sense that he was quite indifferent to what others praised her for .

56919	57037	57042	57043	Mr Holt	211	" Esther felt her heart swelling with mingled indignation at this liberty , wounded pride at this depreciation , and acute consciousness that she could not contradict what Felix said . He was outrageously ill - bred ; but she felt that she should be lowering herself by telling him so , and manifesting her anger : in that way she would be confirming his accusation of a littleness that shrank from severe truth ; and , besides , through all her mortification there pierced a sense that this exasperation of Felix against her was more complimentary than anything in his previous behaviour . She had self - command enough to speak with her usual silvery voice . "

She felt her lips quivering ; but her pride , which feared nothing so much as the betrayal of her emotion , helped her to a desperate effort . She pinched her own hand hard to overcome her tremor , and said , in a tone of scorn , "
57327	57328	57318	57318	you	0	" "
57363	57364	57365	57365	I	0	" "

57540	58052	57526	57526	I	0	" said Esther , not looking at him . He did not open the door immediately . He seemed to be adjusting his cap and pulling it down . Esther longed to be able to throw a lasso round him and compel him to stay , that she might say what she chose to him ; her very anger made this departure irritating , especially as he had the last word , and that a very bitter one . But soon the latch was lifted and the door closed behind him . She ran up to her bedroom and burst into tears . Poor maiden ! There was a strange contradiction of impulses in her mind in those first moments . She could not bear that Felix should not respect her , yet she could not bear that he should see her bend before his denunciation . She revolted against his assumption of superiority , yet she felt herself in a new kind of subjection to him . He was ill - bred , he was rude , he had taken an unwarrantable liberty ; yet his indignant words were a tribute to her : he thought she was worth more pains than the women of whom he took no notice . It was excessively impertinent in him to tell her of his resolving not to love — not to marry — as if she cared about that ; as if he thought himself likely to inspire an affection that would incline any woman to marry him after such eccentric steps as he had taken . Had he ever for a moment imagined that she had thought of him in the light of a man who would make love to her ? ... But did he love her one little bit , and was that the reason why he wanted her to change ? Esther felt less angry at that form of freedom ; though she was quite sure that she did not love him , and that she could never love any one who was so much of a pedagogue and a master , to say nothing of his oddities . But he wanted her to change . For the first time in her life Esther felt herself seriously shaken in her self - contentment . She knew there was a mind to which she appeared trivial , narrow , selfish . Every word Felix had said to her seemed to have burnt itself into her memory . She felt as if she should for evermore be haunted by self - criticism , and never do anything to satisfy those fancies on which she had simply piqued herself before without being dogged by inward questions . Her father 's desire for her conversion had never moved her ; she saw that he adored her all the while , and he never checked her unregenerate acts as if they degraded her on earth , but only mourned over them as unfitting her for heaven . Unfitness for heaven ( spoken of as "
58054	58056	57526	57526	I	0	" and "
58058	58187	58188	58188	You	2011	" ) , the prayers of a good little father , whose thoughts and motives seemed to her like the ' Life of Dr Doddridge , ' which she was content to leave unread , did not attack her self - respect and self - satisfaction . But now she had been stung — stung even into a new consciousness concerning her father . Was it true that his life was so much wortheir than her own ? She could not change for anything Felix said , but she told herself he was mistaken if he supposed her incapable of generous thoughts . She heard her father coming into the house . She dried her tears , tried to recover herself hurriedly , and went down to him . "
58200	58242	58243	58243	My	0	" she said gently , kissing his brow , and then putting her cool hand on it . Mr Lyon felt a little surprise ; such spontaneous tenderness was not quite common with her ; it reminded him of her mother . "
58247	58547	58243	58243	My	0	" he said gratefully , thinking with wonder of the treasures still left in our fallen nature . Felix was going to Sproxton that Sunday afternoon . He always enjoyed his walk to that outlying hamlet ; it took him ( by a short cut ) through a corner of Sir Maximus Debarry 's park ; then across a piece of common , broken here and there into red ridges below dark masses of furze ; and for the rest of the way alongside the canal , where the Sunday peacefulness that seemed to rest on the bordering meadows and pastures was hardly broken if a horse pulled into sight along the towing - path , and a boat , with a little curl of blue smoke issuing from its tin chimney , came slowly gliding behind . Felix retained something of his boyish impression that the days in a canal - boat were all like Sundays ; but the horse , if it had been put to him , would probably have preferred a more Judaic or Scotch rigour with regard to canal - boats , or at least that the Sunday towing should be done by asses , as a lower order . This canal was only a branch of the grand trunk , and ended among the coal - pits , where Felix , crossing a network of black tram - roads , soon came to his destination — that public institute of Sproxton , known to its frequenters chiefly as Chubb 's , but less familiarly as the Sugar Loaf , or the New Pits ; this last being the name for the more modern and lively nucleus of the Sproxton hamlet . The other nucleus , known as the Old Pits , also supported its "
58550	58856	58243	58243	My	0	" but it had something of the forlorn air of an abandoned capital ; and the company at the Blue Cow was of an inferior kind — equal , of course , in the fundamental attributes of humanity , such as desire for beer , but not equal in ability to pay for it . When Felix arrived , the great Chubb was standing at the door . Mr Chubb was a remarkable publican ; none of your stock Bonifaces , red , bloated , jolly , and joking . He was thin and sallow , and was never , as his constant guests observed , seen to be the worse ( or the better ) for liquor ; indeed , as among soldiers an eminent general was held to have a charmed life , Chubb was held by the members of the Benefit Club to have a charmed sobriety , a vigilance over his own interest that resisted all narcotics . His very dreams , as stated by himself , had a method in them beyond the waking thoughts of other men . Pharaoh 's dream , he observed , was nothing to them ; and , as lying so much out of ordinary experience , they were held particularly suitable for narration on Sunday evenings , when the listening colliers , well washed and in their best coats , shook their heads with a sense of that peculiar edification which belongs to the inexplicable . Mr Chubb 's reasons for becoming landlord of the Sugar Loaf were founded on the severest calculation . Having an active mind , and being averse to bodily labour , he had thoroughly considered what calling would yield him the best livelihood with the least possible exertion , and in that sort of line he had seen that a "
58858	58972	58243	58243	My	0	" amongst miners who earned high wages was a fine opening . He had prospered according to the merits of such judicious calculation , was already a forty - shilling freeholder , and was conscious of a vote for the county . He was not one of those mean - spirited men who found the franchise embarrassing , and would rather have been without it : he regarded his vote as part of his investment , and meant to make the best of it . He called himself a straightforward man , and at suitable moments expressed his views freely ; in fact , he was known to have one fundamental division for all opinion—"my
58974	58976	58243	58243	My	0	" and "
58979	59074	58243	58243	My	0	" When Felix approached , Mr Chubb was standing , as usual , with his hands nervously busy in his pockets , his eyes glancing round with a detective expression at the black landscape , and his lipless mouth compressed yet in constant movement . On a superficial view it might be supposed that so eager - seeming a personality was unsuited to the publican 's business ; but in fact it was a great provocative to drinking . Like the shrill biting talk of a vixenish wife , it would have compelled you to "
59079	59116	58243	58243	My	0	" by way of dulling your sensibility . Hitherto , notwithstanding Felix drank so little ale , the publican had treated him with high civility . The coming election was a great opportunity for applying his political "
59119	59537	58243	58243	My	0	" which was , that society existed for the sake of the individual , and that the name of that individual was Chubb . Now , from a conjunction of absurd circumstances inconsistent with that idea , it happened that Sproxton had been hitherto somewhat neglected in the canvass . The head member of the Company that worked the mines was Mr Peter Garstin , and the same company received the rent for the Sugar Loaf . Hence , as the person who had the most power of annoying Mr Chubb , and being of detriment to him , Mr Garstin was naturally the candidate for whom he had reserved his vote . But where there is this intention of ultimately gratifying a gentleman by voting for him in an open British manner on the day of the poll , a man , whether Publican or Pharisee ( Mr Chubb used this generic classification of mankind as one that was sanctioned by Scripture ) , is all the freer in his relations with those deluded persons who take him for what he is not , and imagine him to be a waverer . But for some time opportunity had seemed barren . There were but three dubious votes besides Mr Chubb 's in the small district of which the Sugar Loaf could be regarded as the centre of intelligence and inspiration : the colliers , of course , had no votes , and did not need political conversion ; consequently , the interests of Sproxton had only been tacitly cherished in the breasts of candidates . But ever since it had been known that a Radical candidate was in the field , that in consequences of this Mr Debarry had coalesced with Mr Garstin , and that Sir James Clement , the poor baronet , had retired , Mr Chubb had been occupied with the most ingenious mental combinations in order to ascertain what possibilities of profit to the Sugar Loaf might lie in this altered state of the canvass . He had a cousin in another county , also a publican , but in a larger way , and resident in a borough , and from him Mr Chubb had gathered more detailed political information than he could find in the Loamshire newspapers . He was now enlightened enough to know that there was a way of using voteless miners and navvies at Nominations and Elections . He approved of that ; it entered into his political "
59540	59997	58243	58243	My	0	" and indeed he would have been for extending the franchise to this class — at least in Sproxton . If any one had observed that you must draw a line somewhere , Mr Chubb would have concurred at once , and would have given permission to draw it at a radius of two miles from his own tap . From the first Sunday evening when Felix had appeared at the Sugar Loaf , Mr Chubb had made up his mind that this ' cute man who kept himself sober was an electioneering agent . That he was hired for some purpose or other there was not a doubt ; a man did n't come and drink nothing without a good reason . In proportion as Felix 's purpose was not obvious to Chubb 's mind , it must be deep ; and this growing conviction had even led the publican on the last Sunday evening privately to urge his mysterious visitor to let a little ale be chalked up for him — it was of no consequence . Felix knew his man , and had taken care not to betray too soon that his real object was so to win the ear of the best fellows about him as to induce them to meet him on a Saturday evening in the room where Mr Lyon , or one of his deacons , habitually held his Wednesday preachings . Only women and children , three old men , a journeyman tailor , and a consumptive youth , attended those preachings ; not a collier had been won from the strong ale of the Sugar Loaf , not even a navvy from the muddier drink of the Blue Cow . Felix was sanguine ; he saw some pleasant faces among the miners when they were washed on Sundays ; they might be taught to spend their wages better . At all events , he was going to try : he had great confidence in his powers of appeal , and it was quite true that he never spoke without arresting attention . There was nothing better than a dame school in the hamlet ; he thought that if he could move the fathers , whose blackened week - day persons and flannel caps , ornamented with tallow candles by way of plume , were a badge of hard labour for which he had a more sympathetic fibre than for any ribbon in the button - hole — if he could move these men to save something from their drink and pay a schoolmaster for their boys , a greater service would be done them than if Mr Garstin and his company were persuaded to establish a school . "

60109	60285	60314	60316	a working man	2020	" Felix Holt had his illusions , like other young men , though they were not of a fashionable sort ; referring neither to the impression his costume and horsemanship might make on beholders , nor to the ease with which he would pay the Jews when he gave a loose to his talents and applied himself to work . He had fixed his choice on a certain Mike Brindle ( not that Brindle was his real name — each collier had his sobriquet ) as the man whom he would induce to walk part of the way home with him this very evening , and get to invite some of his comrades for the next Saturday . Brindle was one of the head miners ; he had a bright good - natured face , and had given especial attention to certain performances with a magnet which Felix carried in his pocket . Mr Chubb , who had also his illusions , smiled graciously as the enigmatic customer came up to the door - step . "

60535	60550	60533	60533	I	0	" said Felix , rubbing the back of his head , with a grimace . "

60815	60889	60806	60806	them	2038	" We mortals sometimes cut a pitiable figure in our attempts at display . We may be sure of our own merits , yet fatally ignorant of the point of view from which we are regarded by our neighbour . Our fine patterns in tattooing may be far from throwing him into a swoon of admiration , though we turn ourselves all round to show them . Thus it was with Mr Chubb . "
60892	60898	60806	60806	them	2038	" said Felix , dryly ; "

61017	61252	61006	61006	nobody	4907	" Mr Chubb was hindered from further explaining his views as to the historical element in society by the arrival of new guests , who approached in two groups . The foremost group consisted of well - known colliers , in their good Sunday beavers and coloured handkerchiefs serving as cravats , with the long ends floating . The second group was a more unusual one , and caused Mr Chubb to compress his mouth and agitate the muscles about it in rather an excited manner . First came a smartly - dressed personage on horseback , with a conspicuous expansive shirt - front and figured satin stock . He was a stout man , and gave a strong sense of broadcloth . A wild idea shot through Mr Chubb 's brain : could this grand visitor be Harold Transome ? Excuse him : he had been given to understand by his cousin from the distant borough that a Radical candidate in the condescension of canvassing had even gone the length of eating bread - and - treacle with the children of an honest freeman , and declaring his preference for that simple fare . Mr Chubb 's notion of a Radical was that he was a new and agreeable kind of lick - spittle who fawned on the poor instead of on the rich , and so was likely to send customers to a "
61255	61364	61006	61006	nobody	4907	" so that he argued well enough from the premises at his command . The mounted man of broadcloth had followers : several shabby - looking men , and Sproxton boys of all sizes , whose curiosity had been stimulated by unexpected largesse . A stranger on horseback scattering halfpence on a Sunday was so unprecedented that there was no knowing what he might do next ; and the smallest hindmost fellows in sealskin caps were not without hope that an entirely new order of things had set in . Every one waited outside for the stranger to dismount , and Mr Chubb advanced to take the bridle . "
61370	61386	61367	61368	Mr Chubb	291	" were the first words when the great man was safely out of the saddle , "

61487	61493	61446	61446	I	0	" said Chubb , obsequiously . "
61512	61527	61507	61507	I	0	" said the stranger , looking round at the colliers , who eyed him rather shyly—"a
61562	61590	61539	61539	I	0	" Mr Chubb threw open the parlour door , and then stepping back , took the opportunity of saying , in a low tone , to Felix , "
61597	61598	61600	61600	I	0	" "
61604	61632	61633	61633	I	0	" Mr Chubb 's opinion of Felix Holt sank from that moment . The parlour door was closed , but no one sat down or ordered beer . "
61638	61648	61633	61633	I	0	" said Mike Brindle , going up to Felix , "

61716	61729	61693	61693	they	2059	" said a big , red - whiskered man , called Dredge . "

61904	61912	61914	61914	you	760	" said Felix , using his opportunity . "
61922	61923	61917	61917	I	0	" "
61939	61946	61934	61934	I	0	" said several voices at once . "

62149	62157	62143	62143	you	0	" said Brindle , with some disgust . "

62190	62197	62185	62185	she	1630	" said Dredge , in vindication ; "

62263	62312	62259	62259	you	2087	" , said Brindle , intending a mild rebuke . This dialogue , which was in danger of becoming too personal , was interrupted by the reopening of the parlour door , and the reappearance of the impressive stranger with Mr Chubb , whose countenance seemed unusually radiant . "
62321	62331	62318	62319	Mr Johnson	302	" said Chubb , moving an arm - chair . "
62342	62349	62332	62333	This gentleman	2057	" he added , looking round , "
62379	62387	62368	62369	no man	5249	" The company had nothing equivalent to a "
62392	62465	62368	62369	no man	5249	" at command , but they perhaps felt the more , as they seated themselves with an expectation unvented by utterance . There was a general satisfactory sense that the hitherto shadowy Reform had at length come to Sproxton in a good round shape , with broadcloth and pockets . Felix did not intend to accept the treating , but he chose to stay and hear , taking his pint as usual . "
62472	62492	62368	62369	no man	5249	" said Mr Johnson , as he set down his glass , speaking in a quick , smooth treble . "
62495	62517	62368	62369	no man	5249	" he went on , with a certain pathos in his voice , looking at Mr Chubb , who sat opposite , "
62559	62564	62558	62558	gentlemen	4996	" — here he looked round—"I've
62606	62630	62631	62631	Aw	303	" Here Mr Johnson leaned forward with squared elbows , hands placed on his knees , and a defiant shake of the head . "
62639	62661	62631	62631	Aw	303	" fell in the irrepressible Dredge , in a deep bass ; but he was rebuked by a severe nudge from Brindle "
62675	62691	62666	62666	you	4996	" said Mr Johnson , looking at Dredge , and restoring his self - satisfaction . "
62754	62758	62809	62809	you	4996	" A brief loud "
62763	62771	62809	62809	you	4996	" showed that this fact was appreciated . "
62777	62804	62809	62809	you	4996	" said a wide - mouthed wiry man called Gills , who wished for an exhaustive treatment of the subject , being a stone - cutter . "
62979	62989	62955	62959	the right men to Parliament	2118	" ( Mr Johnson waved his hand liberally ) , "
63039	63108	63029	63029	I	0	" Mr Johnson threw himself back as if from the concussion of that great noun . He did not suppose that one of his audience knew what a crisis meant ; but he had large experience in the effect of uncomprehended words ; and in this case the colliers were thrown into a state of conviction concerning they did not know what , which was a fine preparation for "
63112	63219	63029	63029	I	0	" or any other act carrying a due sequence to such a conviction . Felix felt himself in danger of getting into a rage . There is hardly any mental misery worse than that of having our own serious phrases , our own rooted beliefs , caricatured by a charlatan or a hireling . He began to feel the sharp lower edge of his tin pint - measure , and to think it a tempting missile . Mr Johnson certainly had some qualifications as an orator . After this impressive pause he leaned forward again , and said , in a lowered tone , looking round , "
63229	63256	63029	63029	I	0	" There was a movement of shoe - soles on the quarried floor , and a scrape of some chair legs , but no other answer . "
63513	63514	63502	63502	Jack	297	" "
63522	63542	63502	63502	Jack	297	" Felix burst in , with his loud abrupt voice , in odd contrast with glib Mr Johnson 's . "
63583	63644	63502	63502	Jack	297	" Every one was startled . The audience was much impressed with the grandeur , the knowledge , and the power of Mr Johnson . His brilliant promises confirmed the impression that Reform had at length reached the New Pits ; and Reform , if it were good for anything , must at last resolve itself into spare money — meaning "
63646	63663	63502	63502	Jack	297	" and drink , and keeping away from work for several days in the week . These "
63665	63762	63763	63763	I	0	" men of Sproxton liked Felix as one of themselves , only much more knowing — as a working man who had seen many distant parts , but who must be very poor , since he never drank more than a pint or so . They were quite inclined to hear what he had got to say on another occasion , but they were rather irritated by his interruption at the present moment . Mr Johnson was annoyed , but he spoke with the same glib quietness as before , though with an expression of contempt . "
63818	63824	63807	63807	I	0	" There was again an approving "
63829	63872	63807	63807	I	0	" To hear anything said , and understand it , was a stimulus that had the effect of wit . Mr Chubb cast a suspicious and viperous glance at Felix , who felt that he had been a simpleton for his pains . "
63877	63882	63807	63807	I	0	" continued Mr Johnson , "

64035	64048	64017	64021	Folks of a different mind	2148	" said Felix , laying down his money and taking his cap , "
64053	64088	64049	64049	I	0	" He saw clearly enough that if he said more , there would be a disturbance which could have no desirable end . When the door had closed behind him , Mr Johnson said , "

64103	64114	64118	64118	him	2150	" said Mr Chubb . A few noes were heard . "

64460	64473	64455	64455	Spratt	308	" was rolled forth to an accompaniment of scraping shoe - soles . "

In this he was quite successful . A man known among the "

65885	66428	67533	67534	My uncle	4988	" This Sunday evening , which promised to be so memorable in the experience of the Sproxton miners , had its drama also for those unsatisfactory objects to Mr Johnson 's moral sense , the Debarrys . Certain incidents occurring at Treby Manor caused an excitement there which spread from the dining - room to the stables ; but no one underwent such agitating transitions of feeling as Mr Scales . At six o'clock that superior butler was chuckling in triumph at having played a fine and original practical joke on his rival Mr Christian . Some two hours after that time , he was frightened , sorry , and even meek ; he was on the brink of a humiliating confession ; his cheeks were almost livid ; his hair was flatteued for want of due attention from his fingers ; and the fine roll of his whiskers , which was too firm to give way , seemed only a sad reminiscence of past splendour and felicity . His sorrow came about in this wise . After service on that Sunday morning , Mr Philip Debarry had left the rest of the family to go home in the carriage , and had remained at the Rectory to lunch with his uncle Augustus , that he might consult him touching some letters of importance . He had returned the letters to his pocket - book but had not returned the book to his pocket , and he finally walked away leaving the enclosure of private papers and bank - notes on his uncle 's escritoire . After his arrival at home he was reminded of his omission , and immediately despatched Christian with a note begging his uncle to seal up the pocket - book and send it by the bearer . This commission , which was given between three and four o'clock , happened to be very unwelcome to the courier . The fact was that Mr Christian , who had been remarkable through life for that power of adapting himself to circumstances which enables a man to fall safely on all - fours in the most hurried expulsions and escapes , was not exempt from bodily suffering — a circumstance to which there is no known way of adapting one 's self so as to be perfectly comfortable under it , or to push it off on to other people 's shoulders . He did what he could : he took doses of opium when he had an access of nervous pains , and he consoled himself as to future possibilities by thinking that if the pains ever became intolerably frequent a considerable increase in the dose might put an end to them altogether . He was neither Cato nor Hamlet , and though he had learned their soliloquies at his first boarding - school , he would probably have increased his dose without reciting those masterpieces . Next to the pain itself he disliked that any one should know of it : defective health diminished a man 's market value ; he did not like to be the object of the sort of pity he himself gave to a poor devil who was forced to make a wry face or "
66431	66800	67533	67534	My uncle	4988	" altogether . He had felt it expedient to take a slight dose this afternoon , and still he was not altogether relieved at the time he set off to the Rectory . On returning with the valuable case safely deposited in his hind pocket he felt increasing bodily uneasiness , and took another dose . Thinking it likely that he looked rather pitiable , he chose not to proceed to the house by the carriage - road . The servants often walked in the park on a Sunday , and he wished to avoid any meeting . He would make a circuit , get into the house privately , and after delivering his packet to Mr Debarry , shut himself up till the ringing of the half - hour bell . But when he reached an elbowed seat under some sycamores , he felt so ill at ease that he yielded to the temptation of throwing himself on it to rest a little . He looked at his watch : it was but five ; he had done his errand quickly hitherto , and Mr Debarry had not urged haste . But in less than ten minutes he was in a sound sleep . Certain conditions of his system had determined a stronger effect than usual from the opium . As he had expected , there were servants strolling in the park , but they did not all choose the most frequented part . Mr Scales , in pursuit of a slight flirtation with the younger lady's - maid , had preferred a more sequestered walk in the company of that aggreable nymph . And it happened to be this pair , of all others , who alighted on the sleeping Christian — a sight which at the very first moment caused Mr Scales a vague pleasure as at an incident that must lead to something clever on his part . To play a trick , and make some one or other look foolish , was held the most pointed form of wit throughout the back regions of the Manor , and served as a constant substitute for theatrical entertainment : what the farce wanted in costume or "
66803	66891	67533	67534	My uncle	4988	" it gained in the reality of the mortification which excited the general laughter . And lo ! here was the offensive , the exasperatingly cool and superior , Christian caught comparatively helpless , with his head hanging on his shoulder , and one coat - tail hanging out heavily below the elbow of the rustic seat . It was this coat - tail which served as a suggestion to Mr Scales 's genius . Putting his finger up in warning to Mrs Cherry , and saying , "
66903	67056	66897	66897	I	0	fun"—he took a knife from his pocket , stepped behind the unconscious Christian , and quickly cut off the pendant coat - tail . Scales knew nothing of the errand to the Rectory ; and as he noticed that there was something in the pocket , thought it was probably a large cigar - case . So much the better — he had no time to pause . He threw the coat - tail as far as he could , and noticed that it fell among the elms under which they had been walking . Then , beckoning to Mrs Cherry , he hurried away with her towards the more open part of the park , not daring to explode in laughter until it was safe from the chance of waking the sleeper . And then the vision of the graceful well - appointed Mr Christian , who sneered at Scales about his "
67060	67161	66897	66897	I	0	" having to walk back to the house with only one tail to his coat , was a source of so much enjoyment to the butler , that the fair Cherry began to be quite jealous of the joke . Still she admitted that it really was funny , tittered intermittently , and pledged herself to secrecy . Mr Scales explained to her that Christian would try to creep in unobserved , but that this must be made impossible ; and he requested her to imagine the figure this interloping fellow would cut when everybody was asking what had happened . "
67173	67532	67533	67533	My	0	" would become a proverb at the Manor , where jokes kept remarkably well without the aid of salt ; and Mr Christian 's comb would be cut so effectually that it would take a long time to grow again . Exit Scales , laughing , and presenting a fine example of dramatic irony to any one in the secret of Fate . When Christian awoke , he was shocked to find himself in the twilight . He started up , shook himself , missed something , and soon became aware what it was he missed . He did not doubt that he had been robbed , and he at once foresaw that the consequences would be highly unpleasant . In no way could the cause of the accident be so represented to Mr Philip Debarry as to prevent him from viewing his hitherto unimpeachable factotum in a new and unfavourable light . And though Mr Christian did not regard his present position as brilliant , he did not see his way to anything better . A man nearly fifty who is not always quite well is seldom ardently hopeful : he is aware that this is a world in which merit is often overlooked . With the idea of robbery in full possession of his mind , to peer about and search in the dimness , even if it had occurred to him , would have seemed a preposterous waste of time and energy . He knew it was likely that Mr Debarry 's pocket - book had important and valuable contents , and that he should deepen his offence by deferring his announcement of the unfortunate fact . He hastened back to the house , relieved by the obscurity from that mortification of his vanity on which the butler had counted . Indeed , to Scales himself the affair had already begun to appear less thoroughly jocose than he had anticipated . For he observed that Christian 's non - appearance before dinner had caused Mr Debarry some consternation ; and he had gathered that the courier had been sent on a commission to the Rectory . "
67545	67552	67533	67534	My uncle	4988	" he heard Mr Philip say ; "
67580	68062	67559	67559	he	4988	" Altogether the affair was not taking the turn Mr Scales had intended . At last , when dinner had been removed , and the butler 's chief duties were at an end , it was understood that Christian had entered without his coat - tail , looking serious and even agitated ; that he had asked leave at once to speak to Mr Debarry ; and that he was even then in parley with the gentlemen in the dining - room . Scales was in alarm ; it must have been some property of Mr Debarry 's that had weighted the pocket . He took a lantern , got a groom to accompany him with another lantern , and with the utmost practicable speed reached the fatal spot in the park . He searched under the elms — he was certain that the pocket had fallen there — and he found the pocket ; but he found it empty , and , in spite of further search , did not find the contents , though he had at first consoled himself with thinking that they had fallen out , and would be lying not far off . He returned with the lanterns and the coat - tail and a most uncomfortable consciousness in that great seat of a butler 's emotion , the stomach . He had no sooner re - entered than he was met by Mrs Cherry , pale and anxious who drew him aside to say that if he did n't tell everything , she would ; that the constables were to be sent for ; that there had been no end of banknotes and letters and things in Mr Debarry 's pocket - book , which Christian was carrying in that very pocket Scales had cut off ; that the Rector was sent for , the constable was coming , and they should all be hanged . Mr Scales 's own intellect was anything but clear as to the possible issues . Crest - fallen , and with the coat - tail in his hands as an attestation that he was innocent of anything more than a joke , he went and made his confession . His story relieved Christian a little , but did not relieve Mr Debarry , who was more annoyed at the loss of the letters , and the chance of their getting into hands that might make use of them , than at the loss of the bank - notes . Nothing could be done for the present , but that the Rector , who was a magistrate , should instruct the constables , and that the spot in the park indicated by Scales should again be carefully searched . This was done , but in vain ; and many of the family at the Manor had disturbed sleep that night . "
68075	68183	67559	67559	he	4988	" Richard II . Meanwhile Felix Holt had been making his way back from Sproxton to Treby in some irritation and bitterness of spirit . For a little while he walked slowly along the direct road , hoping that Mr Johnson would overtake him , in which case he would have the pleasure of quarrelling with him , and telling him what he thought of his intentions in coming to ca nt at the Sugar Loaf . But he presently checked himself in this folly and turned off again towards the canal , that he might avoid the temptation of getting into a passion to no purpose . "
68189	68193	67559	67559	he	4988	" he thought , "
68482	68579	68479	68480	a Tory	1104	" Felix went along in the twilight struggling in this way with the intricacies of life , which would certainly be greatly simplified if corrupt practices were the invariable mark of wrong opinions . When he had crossed the common and had entered the park , the overshadowing trees deepened the grey gloom of the evening ; it was useless to try and keep the blind path , and he could only be careful that his steps should be bent in the direction of the park - gate . He was striding along rapidly now , whistling "
68581	69085	68479	68480	a Tory	1104	" in a subdued way as an accompaniment to his inward discussion , when something smooth and soft on which his foot alighted arrested him with an unpleasant startling sensation , and made him stoop to examine the object he was treading on . He found it to be a large leather pocket - book swelled by its contents , and fastened with a sealed ribbon as well as a clasp . In stooping he saw about a yard off something whitish and square lying on the dark grass . This was an ornamental note - book of pale leather stamped with gold . Apparently it had burst open in falling , and out of the pocket , formed by the cover , there protruded a small gold chain about four inches long , with various seals and other trifles attached to it by a ring at the end . Felix thrust the chain back , and finding that the clasp of the note - book was broken , he closed it and thrust it into his side - pocket , walking along under some annoyance that fortune had made him the finder of articles belonging most probably to one of the family at Treby Manor . He was much too proud a man to like any contact with the aristocracy , and he could still less endure coming within speech of their servants . Some plan must be devised by which he could avoid carrying these things up to the Manor himself : he thought at first of leaving them at the lodge , but he had a scruple against placing property , of which the ownership was after all uncertain , in the hands of persons unknown to him . It was possible that the large pocket - book contained papers of high importance , and that it did not belong to any of the Debarry family . He resolved at last to carry his findings to Mr Lyon , who would perhaps be good - natured enough to save him from the necessary transactions with the people at the Manor by undertaking those transactions himself . With this determination he walked straight to Malthouse Yard , and waited outside the chapel until the congregation was dispersing , when he passed along the aisle to the vestry in order to speak to the minister in private . But Mr Lyon was not alone when Felix entered . Mr Nuttwood , the grocer , who was one of the deacons , was complaining to him about the obstinate demeanour of the singers , who had declined to change the tunes in accordance with a change in the selection of hymns , and had stretched short metre into long out of pure wilfulness and defiance , irreverently adapting the most sacred monosyllables to a multitude of wandering quavers , arranged , it was to be feared , by some musician who was inspired by conceit rather than by the true spirit of psalmody . "
69092	69121	68479	68480	a Tory	1104	" said Mr Lyon , smiling at Felix , and then continuing in a faint voice , while he wiped the perspiration from his brow and bald crown , "
69276	69277	69278	69278	They	2268	" "
69283	69295	69278	69278	They	2268	" said Mr Nuttwood , in a tone of sad perplexity , "
69389	69390	69392	69392	you	2276	" "
69413	69488	69392	69392	you	2276	" said Felix , with unwarrantable bluntness . The civil grocer was prepared to be scandalised by anything that came from Felix . In common with many hearers in Malthouse Yard , he already felt an objection to a young man who was notorious for having interfered in a question of wholesale and retail , which should have been left to Providence . Old Mr Holt , being a church member , had probably had "
69490	69542	69392	69392	you	2276	" which were more to be relied on than his son 's boasted knowledge . In any case , a little visceral disturbance and inward chastisement to the consumers of questionable medicines would tend less to obscure the divine glory than a show of punctilious morality in one who was not a "
69545	69608	69392	69392	you	2276	" Besides , how was it to be known that the medicines would not be blessed , if taken with due trust in a higher influence ? A Christian must consider not the medicines alone in their relation to our frail bodies ( which are dust ) , but the medicines with Omnipotence behind them . Hence a pious vendor will look for "
69611	69644	69392	69392	you	2276	" and he is likely to find them in the cessation of demand and the disproportion of expenses and returns . The grocer was thus on his guard against the presumptuous disputant . "
69653	69657	69658	69658	He	201	" he replied . "
69687	69688	69691	69693	an old one	2279	" "
69695	69706	69691	69693	an old one	2279	" said Felix , mischievously disposed towards a sleek tradesman . "
69774	69775	69724	69725	The preacher	1418	" "
69784	69805	69724	69725	The preacher	1418	" said Mr Lyon , hurt by this levity , which glanced at himself as well as at the deacon . "
70155	70298	70299	70299	God	137	" Tired , even exhausted , as the minister had been when Felix Holt entered , the gathering excitement of speech gave more and more energy to his voice and manner ; he walked away from the vestry table , he paused , and came back to it ; he walked away again , then came back , and ended with his deepesttoned largo , keeping his hands clasped behind him , while his brown eyes were bright with the lasting youthfulness of enthusiastic thought and love . But to any one who had no share in the energies that were thrilling his little body , he would have looked queer enough . No sooner had he finished his eager speech , than he held out his hand to the deacon , and said , in his former faint tone of fatigue , "
70325	70335	70339	70340	Mr Lyon	201	" When the deacon was gone , Felix said , "
70351	70352	70347	70347	you	201	" "
70394	70428	70384	70384	you	5265	" They sat down at a corner of the small table , and Felix drew the note - book from his pocket to lay it down with the pocket - book , saying , "
70563	70564	70537	70537	I	0	" "
70567	70572	70537	70537	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , "
70613	70773	70774	70774	You	2314	" As he lifted the note - book close to his eyes , the chain again slipped out . He arrested it and held it in his hand , while he examined some writing , which appeared to be a name on the inner leather . He looked long , as if he were trying to decipher something that was partly rubbed out ; and his hands began to tremble noticeably . He made a movement in an agitated manner , as if he were going to examine the chain and seals , which he held in his hand . But he checked himself , closed his hand again , and rested it on the table , while with the other hand he pressed the sides of the note - book together . Felix observed his agitation , and was much surprised ; but with a delicacy of which he was capable under all his abruptness , he said , "
70805	70822	70798	70798	you	2314	" Mr Lyon did not speak for a few moments , but at last he said , "
70867	70920	70860	70860	You	2314	" With trembling fingers he replaced the chain , and tied both the large pocket - book and the note - book in his handkerchief . He was evidently making a great effort over himself . But when he had gathered the knot of the handkerchief in his hand , he said , "
70943	71156	70937	70937	I	0	" The door was already open , and Lyddy was watching for her master 's return . Felix therefore said Good - night and passed on , sure that this was what Mr Lyon would prefer . The minister 's supper of warm porridge was ready by the kitchen - fire , where he always took it on a Sunday evening , and afterwards smoked his weekly pipe up the broad chimney — the one great relaxation he allowed himself . Smoking , he considered , was a recreation of the travailed spirit , which , if indulged in , might endear this world to us by the ignoble bonds of mere sensuous ease . Daily smoking might be lawful , but it was not expedient . And in this Esther concurred with a doctrinal eagerness that was unusual in her . It was her habit to go to her own room , professedly to bed , very early on Sundays — immediately on her return from chapel — that she might avoid her father 's pipe . But this evening she had remained at home , under a true plea of not feeling well ; and when she heard him enter , she ran out of the parlour to meet him . "
71163	71188	71159	71159	you	318	" she said , as he tottered to the wicker - bottomed arm - chair , while Lyddy stood by , shaking her head . "
71194	71212	71213	71213	I	0	" he answered feebly , as she took off his hat and looked in his face inquiringly ; "
71217	71218	71213	71213	I	0	" "
71228	71239	71220	71220	me	0	" said Esther , touching the bundle in the handkerchief . "
71251	71268	71246	71246	I	0	" he said , laying them on the table , and putting his arm across them . "
71276	71277	71279	71279	me	0	" "
71307	71308	71298	71298	you	0	" "
71313	71319	71311	71311	Lyddy	206	" said Esther , angrily . "
71335	71358	71329	71329	I	0	" Lyddy was electrified by surprise at this new behaviour of Miss Esther 's . She took her candle silently and went . "
71366	71384	71360	71360	you	5426	" said Mr Lyon , tenderly , giving his hand to Esther , when Lyddy was gone . "
71399	71400	71396	71396	you	5426	" "
71434	71444	71425	71425	I	0	" said Esther , smiling rather sadly at him . "
71463	71504	71505	71505	She	5306	" said the minister , in a loud whisper . The tears came and relieved him , while Esther , who had stooped to lift the porridge from the fender , paused on one knee and looked up at him . "
71512	71518	71505	71505	She	5306	" asked Esther , softly . "
71562	71563	71556	71556	you	5432	" "
71583	71599	71575	71575	I	0	" said Esther , laying her head on his knee . He kissed her head . "
71612	71867	71575	71575	I	0	" When Esther was lying down that night , she felt as if the little incidents between herself and her father on this Sunday had made it an epoch . Very slight words and deeds may have a sacramental efficacy , if we can cast our self - love behind us , in order to say or do them . And it has been well believed through many ages that the beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life ; that the mind which sees itself blameless may be called dead in trespasses — in trespasses on the love of others , in trespasses on their weakness , in trespasses on all those great claims which are the image of our own need . But Esther persisted in assuring herself that she was not bending to any criticism from Felix . She was full of resentment against his rudeness , and yet more against his too harsh conception of her character . She was determined to keep as much at a distance from him as possible . The next morning , when the Debarrys , including the Rector , who had ridden over to the Manor early , were still seated at breakfast , Christian came in with a letter , saying that it had been brought by a man employed at the chapel in Malthouse Yard , who had been ordered by the minister to use all speed and care in the delivery . The letter was addressed to Sir Maximus . "
71883	71923	71870	71870	Christian	264	" said Philip Debarry , who was beginning to feel rather sorry for his factotum , as a reaction from previous suspicions and indignation . Sir Maximus opened the letter and felt for his glasses , but then said , "
71941	72210	71932	71933	the man	1138	" Philip cast his eyes over it , and then read aloud in a tone of satisfaction : — Sir,—I send this letter to apprise you that I have now in my possession certain articles , which , last evening , at about half - past seven o'clock , were found lying on the grass at the western extremity of your park . The articles are — 1 ° , a well - filled pocket - book , of brown leather , fastened with a black ribbon and with a seal of red wax ; 2 ° , a small note - book , covered with gilded vellum , whereof the clasp was burst , and from out whereof had partly escaped a small gold chain , with seals and a locket attached , the locket bearing on the back a device , and round the face a female name . Wherefore I request that you will further my effort to place these articles in the right hands , by ascertaining whether any person within your walls claims them as his property , and by sending that person to me ( if such be found ) ; for I will on no account let them pass from my care save into that of one who , declaring himself to be the owner , can state to me what is the impression on the seal , and what the device and name upon the locket . I am , Sir , Yours to command in all right dealing , RUFUS LYON . Malthouse Yard , Oct. 3 , 1832 . "

72285	72319	72279	72279	he	201	" said the Rector , a refined and rather severe likeness of his brother , with a ring of fearlessness and decision in his voice which startled all flaccid men and unruly boys . "
72329	72338	72322	72322	you	319	" he added , seeing his nephew rise . "

72635	72657	72658	72658	Phil	175	" said Selina , looking up at the face which was smiling down on her with a sort of severe benignity . "

72811	73169	72804	72804	I	0	" said Philip , turning and leaning over the back of his chair with the letter in his hand . There is a portrait of Mr Philip Debarry still to be seen at Treby Manor , and a very fine bust of him at Rome , where he died fifteen years later , a convert to Catholicism . His face would have been plain but for the exquisite setting of his hazel eyes , which fascinated even the dogs of the household . The other features , though slight and irregular , were redeemed from triviality by the stamp of gravity and intellectual preoccupation in his face and bearing . As he read aloud , his voice was what his uncle 's might have been if it had been modulated by delicate health and a visitation of self - doubt . Sir,—In reply to the letter with which you have favoured me this morning , I beg to state that the articles you describe were lost from the pocket of myservant , who is the bearer of this letter to you , and is the claimant of the vellum note - book and the gold chain . The large leathern pocket - book is my own property , and the impression on the wax , a helmeted head of Achilles , was made by my uncle , the Rev. Augustus Debarry , who allows me to forward his seal to you in proof that I am not making a mistaken claim . I feel myself under deep obligation to you , sir , for the care and trouble you have taken in order to restore to its right owner a piece of property which happens to be of particular importance to me . And I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling , in that full and speedy relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct . I remain , Sir , your obliged and faithful servant , PHILIP DEBARRY . "
73179	73195	73174	73174	Phil	175	" said Sir Maximus , pushing his plate from him , by way of interjection . "
73276	73277	73259	73259	you	2352	" "
73296	73310	73278	73278	You	2352	" said Philip , smiling , as he turned to fold his letter . "
73359	73360	73365	73365	you	2352	" "
73382	73390	73376	73377	Dissenting preachers	2355	" said Sir Maximus , rather wrathfully . "
73398	73399	73393	73393	you	2352	" "
73404	73414	73400	73400	Phil	175	" said the Rector , in an absolute tone . "
73478	73479	73474	73474	you	2352	" "
73495	74010	73482	73482	I	0	" said Sir Maximus , in some vexation . He had great pride in his son 's superiority even to himself ; but he did not enjoy having his own opinion argued down as it always was , and did not quite trust the dim vision opened by Phil 's new words and new notions . He could only submit in silence while the letter was delivered to Christian , with the order to start for Malthouse Yard immediately . Meanwhile , in that somewhat dim locality the possible claimant of the note - book and the chain was thought of and expected with palpitating agitation . Mr Lyon was seated in his study , looking haggard and already aged from a sleepless night . He was so afraid lest his emotion should deprive him of the presence of mind necessary to the due attention to particulars in the coming interview , that he continued to occupy his sight and touch with the objects which had stirred the depths , not only of memory , but of dread . Once again he unlocked a small box which stood beside his desk , and took from it a little oval locket , and compared this with one which hung with the seals on the stray gold chain . There was the same device in enamel on the back of both : clasped hands surrounded with blue flowers . Both had round the face a name in gold italics on a blue ground : the name on the locket taken from the drawer was Maurice ; the name on the locket which hung with the seals was Annette , and within the circle of this name there was a lover 's knot of light - brown hair , which matched a curl that lay in the box . The hair in the locket which bore the name of Maurice was of a very dark brown , and before returning it to the drawer Mr Lyon noted the colour and quality of this hair more carefully than ever . Then he recurred to the note - book : undoubtedly there had been something , probably a third name , beyond the names Maurice Christian , which had themselves been rubbed and slightly smeared as if by accident ; and from the very first examination in the vestry , Mr Lyon could not prevent himself from transferring the mental image of the third name in faint lines to the rubbed leather . The leaves of the note - book seemed to have been recently inserted ; they were of fresh white paper , and only bore some abbreviations in pencil with a notation of small sums . Nothing could be gathered from the comparison of the writing in the book with that of the yellow letters which lay in the box : the smeared name had been carefully printed , and so bore no resemblance to the signature of those letters ; and the pencil abbreviations and figures had been made too hurriedly to bear any decisive witness . "
74026	74127	74014	74014	him	2363	" had been one of Mr Lyon 's thoughts ; but he faltered in that intention . His power of fulfilling it must depend on what he saw in this visitor , of whose coming he had a horrible dread , at the very time he was writing to demand it . In that demand he was obeying the voice of his rigid conscience , which had never left him perfectly at rest under his one act of deception — the concealment from Esther that he was not her natural father , the assertion of a false claim upon her . "
74135	74148	74150	74150	me	0	" he had said to himself in the anguish of that night ; "
74164	74485	74150	74150	me	0	" If he was really going to find himself face to face with the man who had been Annette 's husband , and who was Esther 's father — if that wandering of his from the light had brought the punishment of a blind sacrilege as the issue of a conscious transgression , — he prayed that he might be able to accept all consequences of pain to himself . But he saw other possibilities concerning the claimant of the book and chain . His ignorance and suspicions as to the history and character of Annette 's husband made it credible that he had laid a plan for convincing her of his death as a means of freeing himself from a burthensome tie ; but it seemed equally probable that he was really dead , and that these articles of property had been a bequest , or a payment , or even a sale , to their present owner . Indeed , in all these years there was no knowing into how many hands such pretty trifles might have passed . And the claimant might , after all , have no connection with the Debarrys ; he might not come on this day or the next . There might be more time left for reflection and prayer . All these possibilities , which would remove the pressing need for difficult action , Mr Lyon represented to himself , but he had no effective belief in them ; his belief went with his strongest feeling , and in these moments his strongest feeling was dread . He trembled under the weight that seemed already added to his own sin ; he felt himself already confronted by Annette 's husband and Esther 's father . Perhaps the father was a gentleman on a visit to the Debarrys . There was no hindering the pang with which the old man said to himself , "
74507	74548	74499	74499	I	0	" He was walking about among the rows of books when there came a loud rap at the outer door . The rap shook him so that he sank into his chair , feeling almost powerless . Lyddy presented herself . "
74584	74585	74573	74573	I	0	" "
74590	74621	74573	74573	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , making an effort to rally . When Christian appeared , the minister half rose , leaning on an arm of his chair , and said , "
74627	74638	74625	74625	sir	5093	" seeing nothing but that a tall man was entering . "
74649	74807	74808	74808	servant	2371	" said Christian , in an off - hand manner . This rusty little man , in his dismal chamber , seemed to the Ulysses of the steward 's room a pitiable sort of human curiosity , to whom a man of the world would speak rather loudly , in accommodation to an eccentricity which was likely to be accompanied with deafness . One can not be eminent in everything ; and if Mr Christian had dispersed his faculties in study that would have enabled him to share unconventional points of view , he might have worn a mistaken kind of boot , and been less competent to win at écarté , or at betting , or in any other contest suitable to a person of figure . As he seated himself , Mr Lyon opened the letter , and held it close to his eyes , so that his face was hidden . But at the word "
74809	74918	74919	74919	servant	2371	" he could not avoid starting , and looking off the letter towards the bearer . Christian , knowing what was in the letter , conjectured that the old man was amazed to learn that so distinguished - looking a personage was a servant ; he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees , balanced his cane on his fingers , and began a whispering whistle . The minister checked himself , finished the reading of the letter , and then slowly and nervously put on his spectacles to survey this man , between whose fate and his own there might be a terrible collision . The word "
74920	74942	74808	74808	servant	2371	" had been a fresh caution to him . He must do nothing rashly . Esther 's lot was deeply concerned . "
74952	74979	74919	74919	servant	2371	" said Christian . Mr Lyon drew the pocket - book from his desk , and , after comparing the seal with the impression , said , "
74995	75015	74986	74986	I	0	" He held it out with the seal , and Christian rose to take them , saying , carelessly , "
75030	75031	74986	74986	I	0	" "
75037	75038	75032	75032	Your	5093	" "
75042	75085	75039	75040	Maurice Christian	327	" A spasm shot through Mr Lyon . It had seemed possible that he might hear another name , and be freed from the worse half of his anxiety . His next words were not wisely chosen , but escaped him impulsively . "
75093	75094	75087	75087	you	5093	" "
75100	75106	75097	75097	you	5093	" said Christian , sharply . "
75115	75121	75122	75122	I	0	" Christian did not comply . "
75131	75139	75122	75122	I	0	" he said , recovering his coolness . "
75170	75239	75160	75160	I	0	" He had reflected that the minister was simply a punctilious old bore . The question meant nothing else . But Mr Lyon had wrought himself up to the task of finding out , then and there , if possible , whether or not this were Annette 's husband . How could he lay himself and his sin before God if he wilfully declined to learn the truth ? "
75251	75262	75244	75244	I	0	" he said , in a firmer tone than before . "
75272	75273	75244	75244	I	0	" "
75282	75310	75244	75244	I	0	" said Christian , carelessly . He was not altogether easy under the minister 's persistence , but for that very reason he showed no more impatience . "
75320	75321	75322	75322	I	0	" "
75332	75333	75322	75322	I	0	" "
75344	75413	75322	75322	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , dipping a pen in the ink , and holding it out with a piece of paper . Christian was much surprised , but not now greatly alarmed . In his rapid conjectures as to the explanation of the minister 's curiosity , he had alighted on one which might carry advantage rather than inconvenience . But he was not going to commit himself . "
75422	75438	75420	75420	sir	5093	" he said , laying down the pen , and looking straight at Mr Lyon , "
75578	75836	75573	75573	your	0	" The cool stare , the hard challenging voice , with which these words were uttered , made them fall like the beating cutting chill of heavy hail on Mr Lyon . He sank back in his chair in utter irresolution and helplessness . How was it possible to lay bare the sad and sacred past in answer to such a call as this ? The dread with which he had thought of this man 's coming , the strongly - confirmed suspicion that he was really Annette 's husband , intensified the antipathy created by his gestures and glances . The sensitive little minister knew instinctively that words which would cost him efforts as painful as the obedient footsteps of a wounded bleeding hound that wills a foreseen throe , would fall on this man as the pressure of tender fingers falls on a brazen glove . And Esther — if this man was her father — every additional word might help to bring down irrevocable , perhaps cruel , consequences on her . A thick mist seemed to have fallen where Mr Lyon was looking for the track of duty : the difficult question , how far he was to care for consequences in seeking and avowing the truth , seemed anew obscured . All these things , like the vision of a coming calamity , were compressed into a moment of consciousness . Nothing could be done to - day ; everything must be deferred . He answered Christian in a low apologetic tone . "
75863	75898	75902	75902	sir	5093	" He handed the note - book and chain to Christian , who had been observing him narrowly , and now said , in a tone of indifference , as he pocketed the articles , "
75912	75913	75914	75916	Good - morning	2384	" "
75918	75999	75914	75916	Good - morning	2384	" said Mr Lyon , feeling , while the door closed behind his guest , that mixture of uneasiness and relief which all procrastination of difficulty produces in minds capable of strong forecast . The work was still to be done . He had still before him the task of learning everything that could be learned about this man 's relation to himself and Esther . Christian , as he made his way back along Malthouse Lane , was thinking , "
76052	76193	76031	76032	a gentleman	1135	" Mr Lyon was careful to look in at Felix as soon as possible after Christian 's departure , to tell him that his trust was discharged . During the rest of the day he was somewhat relieved from agitating reflections by the necessity of attending to his ministerial duties , the rebuke of rebellious singers being one of them ; and on his return from the Monday evening prayer - meeting he was so overcome with weariness that he went to bed without taking note of any objects in his study . But when he rose the next morning , his mind , once more eagerly active , was arrested by Philip Debarry 's letter , which still lay open on his desk , and was arrested by precisely that portion which had been unheeded the day before : — "
76244	77281	77282	77282	I	0	" To understand how these words could carry the suggestion they actually had for the minister in a crisis of peculiar personal anxiety and struggle , we must bear in mind that for many years he had walked through life with the sense of having for a space been unfaithful to what he esteemed the highest trust ever committed to man — the ministerial vocation . In a mind of any nobleness , a lapse into transgression against an object still regarded as supreme , issues in a new and purer devotedness , chastised by humility and watched over by a passionate regret . So it was with that ardent spirit which animated the little body of Rufus Lyon . Once in his life he had been blinded , deafened , hurried along by rebellious impulse ; he had gone astray after his own desires , and had let the fire die out on the altar ; and as the true penitent , hating his self - besotted error , asks from all coming life duty instead of joy , and service instead of ease , so Rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command . Now here was an opportunity brought by a combination of that unexpected incalculable kind which might be regarded as the Divine emphasis invoking especial attention to trivial events — an opportunity of securing what Rufus Lyon had often wished for as a means of honouring truth , and exhibiting error in the character of a stammering , halting , short - breathed usurper of office and dignity . What was more exasperating to a zealous preacher , with whom copious speech was not a difficulty but a relief — who never lacked argument , but only combatants and listeners — than to reflect that there were thousands on thousands of pulpits in this kingdom , supplied with handsome sounding - boards , and occupying an advantageous position in buildings far larger than the chapel in Malthouse Yard — buildings sure to be places of resort , even as the markets were , if only from habit and interest ; and that these pulpits were filled , or rather made vacuous , by men whose privileged education in the ancient centres of instruction issued in twenty minutes ' formal reading of tepid exhortation or probably infirm deductions from premises based on rotten scaffolding ? And it is in the nature of exasperation gradually to concentrate itself . The sincere antipathy of a dog towards cats in general , necessarily takes the form of indignant barking at the neighbour 's black cat which makes daily trespass ; the bark at imagined cats , though a frequent exercise of the canine mind , is yet comparatively feeble . Mr Lyon 's sarcasm was not without an edge when he dilated in general on an elaborate education for teachers which issued in the minimum of teaching , but it found a whetstone in the particular example of that bad system known as the Rector of Treby Magna . There was nothing positive to be said against the Rev. Augustus Debarry ; his life could not be pronounced blameworthy except for its negatives . And the good Rufus was too pure - minded not to be glad of that . He had no delight in vice as discrediting wicked opponents ; he shrank from dwelling on the images of cruelty or of grossness , and his indignation was habitually inspired only by those moral and intellectual mistakes which darken the soul but do not injure or degrade the temple of the body . If the Rector had been a less respectable man , Rufus would have more reluctantly made him an object of antagonism ; but as an incarnation of soul - destroying error , dissociated from those baser sins which have no good repute even with the worldly , it would be an argumentative luxury to get into close quarters with him , and fight with a dialectic short - sowrd in the eyes of the Treby world ( sending also a written account thereof to the chief organs of Dissenting opinion ) . Vice was essentially stupid — a deaf and eyeless monster , insusceptible to demonstration : the Spirit might work on it by unseen ways , and the unstudied sallies of sermons were often as the arrows which pierced and awakened the brutified conscience ; but illuminated thought , finely - dividing speech , were the choicer weapons of the Divine armoury , which whoso could wield must be careful not to leave idle . Here , then , was the longed - for opportunity . Here was an engagement — an expression of a strong wish — on the part of Philip Debarry , if it were in his power , to procure a satisfaction to Rufus Lyon . How had that man of God and exemplary Independent minister , Mr Ainsworth , of persecuted sanctity , conducted himself when a similar occasion had befallen him at Amsterdam ? He had thought of nothing but the glory of the highest cause , and had converted the offer of recompense into a public debate with a Jew on the chief mysteries of the faith . Here was a model : the case was nothing short of a heavenly indication , and he , Rufus Lyon , would seize the occasion to demand a public debate with the Rector on the Constitution of the true Church . What if he were inwardly torn by doubt and anxiety concerning his own private relations and the facts of his past life ? That danger of absorption within the narrow bounds of self only urged him the more towards action which had a wider bearing , and might tell on the welfare of England at large . It was decided . Before the minister went down to his breakfast that morning he had written the following letter to Mr Philip Debarry : — Sir,—Referring to your letter of yesterday , I find the following words : "
77332	77935	77292	77292	you	2389	" I am not unaware , sir , that , in the usage of theworld , there are words of courtesy ( so called ) which are understood , by those amongst whom they are current , to have no precise meaning , and to constitute no bond or obligation . I will not now insist that this is an abuse of language , wherein our fallible nature requires the strictest safeguards against laxity and misapplication , for I do not apprehend that in writing the words I have above quoted , you were open to the reproach of using phrases which , while seeming to carry a specific meaning , were really no more than what is called a polite form . I believe , sir , that you used these words advisedly , sincerely , and with an honourable intention of acting on them as a pledge , should such action be demanded . No other supposition on my part would correspond to the character you bear as a young man who aspires ( albeit mistakenly ) to engraft the finest fruits of public virtue on a creed and institutions , whereof the sap is composed rather of human self - seeking than of everlasting truth . Wherefore I act on this my belief in the integrity of your written word ; and I beg you to procure for me ( as it is doubtless in your power ) that I may be allowed a public discussion with your near relative , the Rector of this parish , the Reverned Augustus Debarry , to be held in the large room of the Free School , or in the Assembly Room of the Marquis of Granby , these being the largest covered spaces at our command . For I presume he would neither allow me to speak within his church , nor would consent himself to speak within my chapel ; and the probable inclemency of the approaching season forbids an assured expectation that we could discourse in the open air . The subjects I desire to discuss are,—first , the Constitution of the true Church ; and , secondly , the bearing thereupon of the English Reformation . Confidently expecting that you will comply with this request , which is the sequence of your expressed desire , I remain , sir , yours , with the respect offered to a sincere withstander , RUFUS LYON . Malthouse Yard . After writing this letter , the good Rufus felt that serenity and elevation of mind which is infallibly brought by a preoccupation with the wider relations of things . Already he was beginning to sketch the course his argument might most judiciously take in the coming debate ; his thoughts were running into sentences , and marking off careful exceptions in parentheses ; and he had come down and seated himself at the breakfast - table quite automatically , without expectation of toast or coffee , when Esther 's voice and touch recalled him to an inward debate of another kind , in which he felt himself much weaker . Again there arose before him the image of that cool , hard - eyed , worldly man , who might be this dear child 's father , and one against whose rights he had himself grievously offended . Always as the image recurred to him Mr Lyon 's heart sent forth a prayer for guidance , but no definite guidance had yet made itself visible for him . It could not be guidance — it was a temptation — that said , "
77955	78056	78057	78058	the brethren	2391	" The remembrance that in his time of wandering he had wilfully remained in ignorance of facts which he might have inquired after , deepened the impression that it was now an imperative duty to seek the fullest attainable knowledge . And the inquiry might possibly issue in a blessed repose , by putting a negative on all his suspicions . But the more vividly all the circumstances became present to him , the more unfit he felt himself to set about any investigation concerning this man who called himself Maurice Christian . He could seek no confidant or helper among "
78060	78289	78057	78058	the brethren	2391	" he was obliged to admit to himself that the members of his church , with whom he hoped to go to heaven , were not easy to converse with on earth touching the deeper secrets of his experience , and were still less able to advise him as to the wisest procedure , in a case of high delicacy , with a worldling who had a carefully - trimmed whisker and a fashionable costume . For the first time in his life it occurred to the minister that he should be glad of an adviser who had more worldly than spiritual experience , and that it might not be inconsistent with his principles to seek some light from one who had studied human law . But it was a thought to be paused upon , and not followed out rashly ; some other guidance might intervene . Esther noticed that her father was in a fit of abstraction , that he seemed to swallow his coffee and toast quite unconsciously , and that he vented from time to time a low guttural interjection , which was habitual with him when he was absorbed by an inward discussion . She did not disturb him by remarks , and only wondered whether anything unusual had occurred on Sunday evening . But at last she thought it needful to say , "
78300	78301	78298	78298	father	5432	" "
78308	78316	78298	78298	father	5432	" said Mr Lyon , rousing himself . "
78335	78361	78364	78364	I	0	" Esther was surprised to see her father start and change colour as if he had been shaken by some sudden collision before he answered , "
78386	78387	78384	78384	Zachary	329	" "
78440	78441	78448	78448	him	329	" "
78497	78575	78491	78495	two visitors up - stairs	2402	" While Mr Lyon went out to Zachary , the pewopener , to give him a second time the commission of carrying a letter to Treby Manor , Esther gave her injunction to Lyddy that if one gentleman came he was to be shown up - stairs — if two , they were to be shown into the parlour . But she had to resolve various questions before Lyddy clearly saw what was expected of her,—as that , "
78654	79055	78643	78643	they	2407	" Whereupon Lyddy shook her head and groaned , under an edifying despair as to the future lot of gentlemen callers . Esther always avoided asking questions of Lyddy , who found an answer as she found a key , by pouring out a pocketful of miscellanies . But she had remarked so many indications that something had happened to cause her father unusual excitement and mental preoccupation , that she could not help connecting with them the fact of this visit from the Manor , which he had not mentioned to her . She sat down in the dull parlour and took up her netting ; for since Sunday she had felt unable to read when she was alone , being obliged , in spite of herself , to think of Felix Holt — to imagine what he would like her to be , and what sort of views he took of life so as to make it seem valuable in the absence of all elegance , luxury , gaiety , or romance . Had he yet reflected that he had behaved very rudely to her on Sunday ? Perhaps not . Perhaps he had dismissed her from his mind with contempt . And at that thought Esther 's eyes smarted unpleasantly . She was fond of netting , because it showed to advantage both her hand and her foot ; and across this image of Felix Holt 's indifference and contempt there passed the vaguer image of a possible somebody who would admire her hands and feet , and delight in looking at their beauty , and long , yet not dare , to kiss them . Life would be much easier in the presence of such a love . But it was precisely this longing after her own satisfaction that Felix had reproached her with . Did he want her to be heroic ? That seemed impossible without some great occasion . Her life was a heap of fragments , and so were her thoughts : some great energy was needed to bind them together . Esther was beginning to lose her complacency at her own wit and criticism ; to lose the sense of superiority in an awakening need for reliance on one whose vision was wider , whose nature was purer and stronger than her own . But then , she said to herself , that "
79057	79583	79584	79584	My	0	" must be tender to her , not rude and predominating in his manners . A man with any chivalry in him could never adopt a scolding tone towards a woman — that is , towards a charming woman . But Felix had no chivalry in him . He loved lecturing and opinion too well ever to love any woman . In this way Esther strove to see that Felix was thoroughly in the wrong — at least , if he did not come again expressly to show that he was sorry . The expected important knock at the door came about twelve o'clock , and Esther could hear that there were two visitors . Immediately the parlour door was opened and the shaggy - haired , cravatless image of Felix Holt , which was just then full in the mirror of Esther 's mind , was displaced by the highly - contrasted appearance of a personage whose name she guessed before Mr Jermyn had announced it . The perfect morning costume of that day differed much from our present ideal : it was essential that a gentleman 's chin should be well propped , that his collar should have a voluminous roll , that his waistcoat should imply much discrimination , and that his buttons should be arranged in a manner which would now expose him to general contempt . And it must not be forgotten that at the distant period when Treby Magna first knew the excitements of an election , there existed many other anomalies now obsolete , besides short - waisted coats and broad stiffeners . But we have some notions of beauty and fitness which withstand the centuries ; and quite irrespective of dates , it would be pronounced that at the age of thirty - four Harold Transome was a striking and handsome man . He was one of those people , as Denner had remarked , to whose presence in the room you could not be indifferent : if you do not hate or dread them , you must find the touch of their hands , nay , their very shadows , agreeable . Esther felt a pleasure quite new to her as she saw his finely - embrowned face and full bright eyes turned towards her with an air of deference by which gallantry must commend itself to a refined woman who is not absolutely free from vanity . Harold Transome regarded women as slight things , but he was fond of slight things in the intervals of business ; and he held it among the chief arts of life to keep these pleasant diversions within such bounds that they should never interfere with the course of his serious ambition . Esther was perfectly aware , as he took a chair near her , that he was under some admiring surprise at her appearance and manner . How could it be otherwise ? She believed that in the eyes of a highbred man no young lady in Treby could equal her : she felt a glow of delight at the sense that she was being looked at . "
79589	79596	79584	79584	My	0	" she said to Mr Jermyn . "
79611	79624	79605	79605	He	4851	" She disentangled her foot from her netting and wound it up . "
79637	79645	79627	79627	you	0	" said Harold , noticing her action . "
79662	79663	79659	79660	the ladies	5084	" "
79680	79686	79687	79687	I	0	" said Esther , smiling . "
79701	79702	79703	79703	I	0	" "
79732	79760	79729	79729	their	2413	" Esther spoke with her usual pretty fluency , but she had no sooner uttered the words than she thought how angry they would have made Felix . "
79789	79797	79779	79779	you	4851	" Esther rose to leave the room . "
79803	79815	79779	79779	you	4851	" said Harold , preparing to open the door for her . "
79829	80077	80078	80078	I	0	" said Esther , bowing and floating out like a blue - robed Naïad , but not without a suffused blush as she passed through the doorway . It was a pity the room was so small , Harold Transome thought : this girl ought to walk in a house where there were halls and corridors . But he had soon dismissed this chance preoccupation with Esther ; for before the door was closed again Mr Lyon had entered , and Harold was entirely bent on what had been the object of his visit . The minister , thought no elector himself , had considerable influence over Liberal electors , and it was the part of wisdom in a candidate to cement all political adhesion by a little personal regard , if possible . Garstin was a harsh and wiry fellow ; he seemed to suggest that sour whey , which some say was the original meaning of Whig in the Scottish , and it might assist the theoretic advantages of Radicalism if it could be associated with a more generous presence . What would conciliate the personal regard of old Mr Lyon became a curious problem to Harold , now the little man made his appearance . But canvassing makes a gentleman acquainted with many strange animals , together with the ways of catching and taming them ; and thus the knowledge of natural history advances amongst the aristocracy and the wealthy commoners of our land . "
80096	80114	80093	80094	Mr Lyon	201	" said Harold , putting out his hand to the minister when Jermyn had mentioned his name . "
80166	80167	80168	80168	You	201	" "
80177	80199	80168	80168	You	201	" said Mr Lyon , with a vague shortsighted gaze , in which a candidate 's appearance evidently went for nothing . "
80213	80345	80346	80346	I	0	" He placed himself at a right angle with his visitors , his worn look of intellectual eagerness , slight frame , and rusty attire , making an odd contrast with their flourishing persons , unblemished costume , and comfortable freedom from excitement . The group was fairly typical of the difference between the men who are animated by ideas and the men who are expected to apply them . Then he drew forth his spectacles , and began to rub them with the thin end of his coat - tail . He was inwardly exercising great self - mastery — suppressing the thought of his personal needs , which Jermyn 's presence tended to suggest , in order that he might be equal to the larger duties of this occasion . "
80356	80360	80350	80351	Mr Jermyn	169	" said Harold , "
80457	80458	80459	80459	Your	201	" "
80467	80480	80459	80459	Your	201	" said Mr Lyon , still holding his spectacles in his hand , "
80666	80667	80700	80727	men who will be satisfied if they can only bring in a plutocracy , buy up the land , and stick the old crests on their new gateways	2432	" "
80671	80699	80700	80727	men who will be satisfied if they can only bring in a plutocracy , buy up the land , and stick the old crests on their new gateways	2432	" said Harold , who was quick at new languages , and still quicker at translating other men 's generalities into his own special and immediate purposes , "
80929	80930	80931	80931	I	0	" "
80941	81284	80937	80937	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , gravely ; finally putting on his spectacles and examining the face of the candidate , whom he was preparing to turn into a catechumen . For the good Rufus , conscious of his political importance as an organ of persuasion , felt it his duty to catechise a little , and also to do his part towards impressing a probable legislator with a sense of his responsibility . But the latter branch of duty somewhat obstructed the catechising , for his mind was so urged by considerations which he held in danger of being overlooked , that the questions and answers bore a very slender proportion to his exposition . It was impossible to leave the question of church - rates without noting the grounds of their injustice , and without a brief enumeration of reasons why Mr Lyon , for his own part , would not present that passive resistance to a legal imposition which had been adopted by the Friends ( whose heroism in this regard was nevertheless worthy of all honour ) . Comprehensive talkers are apt to be tiresome when we are not athirst for information , but , to be quite fair , we must admit that superior reticence is a good deal due to the lack of matter . Speech is often barren ; but silence also does not necessarily brood over a full nest . Your still fowl , blinking at you without remark , may all the while be sitting on one addled nest - egg ; and when it takes to cackling , will have nothing to announce but that addled delusion . Harold Transome was not at all a patient man , but in matters of business he was quite awake to his cue , and in this case it was perhaps easier to listen than to answer questions . But Jermyn , who had plenty of work on his hands , took an opportunity of rising , and saying , as he looked at his watch , "
81317	81318	81319	81319	I	0	" "
81325	81344	81319	81319	I	0	" said the minister , changing colour , and by a quick movement laying his hand on Jermyn 's arm—"I
81366	81508	81509	81511	An odd man	2448	" Mr Lyon , like others who are habitually occupied with impersonal subjects , was liable to this impulsive sort of action . He snatched at the details of life as if they were darting past him — as if they were like the ribbons at his knees , which would never be tied all day if they were not tied on the instant . Through these spasmodic leaps out of his abstractions into real life , it constantly happened that he suddenly took a course which had been the subject of too much doubt with him ever to have been determined on by continuous thought . And if Jermyn had not startled him by threatening to vanish just when he was plunged in politics , he might never have made up his mind to confide in a worldly attorney . ( "
81513	81519	81509	81511	An odd man	2448	" as Mrs Muscat observed , "
81539	81573	81532	81532	One	4977	" which , in a lady who rarely felt her judgment at a loss , was a concession that showed much piety . ) Jermyn was surprised at the little man 's eagerness . "
81578	81585	81532	81532	One	4977	" he answered , quite cordially . "
81596	81597	81587	81587	you	2451	" "
81611	81612	81605	81605	you	2451	" "
81644	81752	81631	81631	I	0	" Jermyn felt that in the eyes of Harold he was appearing all the more valuable when his services were thus in request . He went out , and Mr Lyon easily relapsed into politics , for he had been on the brink of a favourite subject on which he was at issue with his fellow - Liberals . At that time , when faith in the efficacy of political change was at fever - heat in ardent Reformers , many measures which men are still discussing with little confidence on either side , were then talked about and disposed of like property in near reversion . Crying abuses—"bloated
81755	81756	81757	81758	bloated pluralists	2453	" "
81760	81873	81757	81758	bloated pluralists	2453	" and other corruptions hindering men from being wise and happy — had to be fought against and slain . Such a time is a time of hope . Afterwards , when the corpses of those monsters have been held up to the public wonder and abhorrence , and yet wisdom and happiness do not follow , but rather a more abundant breeding of the foolish and unhappy , comes a time of doubt and despondency . But in the great Reform - year Hope was mighty : the prospect of Reform had even served the voters instead of drink ; and in one place , at least , there had been a "
81877	82054	82055	82055	I	0	" And now the speakers at Reform banquets were exuberant in congratulation and promise : Liberal clergymen of the Establishment toasted Liberal Catholic clergymen without any allusion to scarlet , and Catholic clergymen replied with a like tender reserve . Some dwelt on the abolition of all abuses , and on millennial blessedness generally ; others , whose imaginations were less suffused with exhalations of the dawn , insisted chiefly on the ballot - box . Now on this question of the ballot the minister strongly took the negative side . Our pet opinions are usually those which place us in a minority of a minority amongst our own party:—very happily , else those poor opinions , born with no silver spoon in their mouths — how would they get nourished and fed ? So it was with Mr Lyon and his objection to the ballot . But he had thrown out a remark on the subject which was not quite clear to his hearer , who interpreted it according to his best calculation of probabilities . "
82063	82067	82055	82055	I	0	" said Harold , "
82098	82099	82102	82102	sir	5093	" "
82111	82120	82104	82104	you	5093	" said Mr Lyon , stroking his chin . "
82154	82168	82129	82129	I	0	" Mr Lyon looked at the speaker with a pitying smile and a subdued "
82175	82190	82129	82129	I	0	" which Harold took for a sign of satisfaction . He was soon undeceived . "
82346	82347	82349	82351	this old man	2463	" "
82353	82357	82349	82351	this old man	2463	" thought Harold . "
82380	82440	82374	82374	his	2463	" He was going to excuse himself as prudently as he could , by deferring the subject till the morrow , and inviting Mr Lyon to come to him in the committeeroom before the time appointed for his public speech ; but he was relieved by the opening of the door . Lyddy put in her head to say , "
82487	82488	82479	82479	you	5093	" "
82503	82513	82499	82501	A young man	2467	" Mr Lyon went on , speaking to Harold , "
82532	82533	82534	82534	He	211	" "
82539	82598	82534	82534	He	211	" said Harold , truthfully enough , though he felt little interest in the voteless man of ideas except as a diversion from the subject of the ballot . He had been standing for the last minute or two , feeling less of a victim in that attitude , and more able to calculate on means of escape . "
82604	82613	82602	82602	sir	5093	" said the minister , as Felix entered , "
82648	82649	82650	82650	I	0	" "
82658	82700	82701	82703	A formidable fellow	2474	" said Harold , bowing . He perceived from the way in which Felix bowed to him and turned to the most distant spot in the room , that the candidate 's shake of the hand would not be welcome here . "
82705	82709	82701	82703	A formidable fellow	2474	" he thought , "
82737	82738	82728	82728	I	0	" "
82742	82746	82739	82740	Mr Lyon	201	" said Felix , "
82842	82843	82837	82840	Mr Transome 's agents	2476	" "
82848	82856	82837	82840	Mr Transome 's agents	2476	" said Harold , expecting something unpleasant . "
82867	82871	82857	82857	I	0	" said Felix ; "
82954	82955	82940	82940	they	2476	" "
82959	82963	82940	82940	they	2476	" said Harold . "
83020	83021	83014	83014	you	201	" "
83031	83045	83014	83014	you	201	" said Felix , who then briefly described what had happened on Sunday . "
83059	83063	83049	83049	you	201	" he ended , "
83165	83166	83167	83167	Your	201	" "
83176	83340	83167	83167	Your	201	" said Harold , offended at what sounded like a threat , and was certainly premature enough to be in bad taste . In fact , this error of behaviour in Felix proceeded from a repulsion which was mutual . It was a constant source of irritation to him that the public men on his side were , on the whole , not conspicuously better than the public men on the other side ; that the spirit of innovation , which with him was a part of religion , was in many of its mouthpieces no more of a religion than the faith in rotten boroughs ; and he was thus predisposed to distrust Harold Transome . Harold , in his turn , disliked impracticable notions of loftiness and purity — disliked all enthusiasm ; and he thought he saw a very troublesome , vigorous incorporation of that nonsense in Felix . But it would be foolish to exasperate him in any way . "
83352	83357	83167	83167	Your	201	" he went on , "
83388	83389	83370	83370	you	201	" "
83392	83414	83370	83370	you	201	" said the minister , who liked the candidate very well , and believed that he would be amenable to argument ; "
83453	83454	83450	83451	righteous men	2495	" "
83463	83467	83470	83470	he	0	" said Felix . "
83476	83493	83470	83470	he	0	" Mr Lyon smiled , shook his head , and stroked his favourite 's arm deprecatingly . "
83511	83515	83470	83470	he	0	" said Harold . "
83603	83604	83601	83601	rogues	2504	" "
83608	83614	83601	83601	rogues	2504	" said Felix , scornfully , "
83684	83685	83696	83696	I	0	" "
83707	83711	83696	83696	I	0	" said Harold . "
83727	83728	83724	83725	Mr Lyon	201	" "
83733	83739	83729	83729	I	0	" said the minister , looking uneasy—"I
83787	83788	83729	83729	I	0	" "
83794	83805	83729	83729	I	0	" said Harold , shaking Mr Lyon 's hand cordially , "
83825	83826	83827	83827	I	0	" "
83831	83849	83827	83827	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , rubbing his brow , with a sad remembrance of his personal anxieties . "
83875	83876	83877	83877	I	0	" "
83886	84560	84581	84582	Mr Holt	211	" Harold and Felix went out together ; and the minister , going up to his dull study , asked himself whether , under the pressure of conflicting experience , he had faithfully discharged the duties of the past interview ? If a cynical sprite were present , riding on one of the motes in that dusty room , he may have made himself merry at the illusions of the little minister who brought so much conscience to bear on the production of so slight an effect . In confess to smiling myself , being sceptical as to the effect of ardent appeals and nice distinctions on gentlemen who are got up , both inside and out , as candidates in the style of the period ; but I never smiled at Mr Lyon 's trustful energy without falling to penitence and veneration immediately after . For what we call illusions are often , in truth , a wider vision of past and present realities — a willing movement of a man 's soul with the larger sweep of the world 's forces — a movement towards a more assured end than the chances of a single life . We see human heroism broken into units and say , this unit did little — might as well not have been . But in this way we might break up a great army into units ; in this way we might break the sunlight into fragments , and think that this and the other might be cheaply parted with . Let us rather raise a monument to the soldiers whose brave hearts only kept the ranks unbroken , and met death — a monument to the faithful who were not famous , and who are precious as the continuity of the sunbeams is precious , though some of them fall unseen and on barrenness . At present , looking back on that day at Treby , it seems to me that the sadder illusion lay with Harold Transome , who was trusting in his own skill to shape the success of his own morrows , ignorant of what many yesterdays had determined for him beforehand . Jermyn was not particularly pleased that some chance had apparently hindered Harold Transome from making other canvassing visits immediately after leaving Mr Lyon , and so had sent him back to the office earlier than he had been expected to come . The inconvenient chance he guessed at once to be represented by Felix Holt , whom he knew very well by Trebian report to be a young man with so little of the ordinary Christian motives as to making an appearance and getting on in the world , that he presented no handle to any judicious and respectable person who might be willing to make use of him . Harold Transome , on his side , was a good deal annoyed at being worried by Felix into an inquiry about electioneering details . The real dignity and honesty there was in him made him shrink from this necessity of satisfying a man with a troublesome tongue ; it was as if he were to show indignation at the discovery of one barrel with a false bottom , when he had invested his money in a manufactory where a larger or smaller number of such barrels had always been made . A practical man must seek a good end by the only possible means ; that is to say , if he is to get into Parliament he must not be too particular . It was not disgraceful to be neither a Quixote nor a theorist , aiming to correct the moral rules of the world ; but whatever actually was , or might prove to be , disgraceful , Harold held in detestation . In this mood he pushed on unceremoniously to the inner office without waiting to ask questions ; and when he perceived that Jermyn was not alone , he said , with haughty quickness , "
84593	84594	84581	84582	Mr Holt	211	" "
84603	84648	84581	84582	Mr Holt	211	" said Jermyn , who , as usual , was the more cool and deliberate because he was vexed . He was standing , and , as he turned round , his broad figure concealed the person who was seated writing at the bureau . "
84678	84689	84694	84694	he	2057	" — here Jermyn made a slight backward movement of the head—"is
84701	84713	84694	84694	he	2057	" ' I have simply to complain , ' said Felix , "
84761	84816	84743	84744	Mr Transome	141	" Jermyn , looking gravely and steadily at Felix while he was speaking , at the same time drew forth a small sheaf of papers from his side - pocket , and then , as he turned his eyes slowly on Harold , felt in his waistcoat - pocket for his pencil - case . "
84825	84842	84854	84854	you	2511	" said Harold , who hated Jermyn 's calculated slowness and conceit in his own impenetrability . "
84856	84857	84858	84859	Mr Holt	211	" "
84869	84891	84858	84859	Mr Holt	211	" said Jermyn , just inclining his head to Harold , and then alternately looking at Felix and docketing his bills ; "
84986	84987	84976	84976	he	211	" "
84996	85000	84976	84976	he	211	" said Felix ; "
85062	85063	85064	85064	They	2262	" "
85076	85082	85064	85064	They	2262	" said Jermyn , smiling . "
85107	85145	85146	85146	I	0	" Harold was moving about in an irritated manner while Felix and Jermyn were speaking . He preferred leaving the talk to the attorney , of whose talk he himself liked to keep as clear as possible . "
85151	85155	85146	85146	I	0	" answered Felix , "
85203	85204	85179	85179	You	0	" "
85218	85233	85215	85216	Mr Holt	211	" said Jermyn , pocketing his bills again , and shutting up his pencil ; "
85385	85386	85391	85396	the man who calls himself Johnson	2535	" "
85398	85424	85391	85396	the man who calls himself Johnson	2535	" said Felix , in a tone of disgust . Before Jermyn chose to answer , Harold broke in , saying , quickly and peremptorily , "
85471	85482	85461	85461	You	0	" said Harold , breaking into his most agreeable smile . "
85493	85494	85485	85485	you	0	" "
85502	85510	85511	85511	I	0	" said Felix , not thoroughly propitiated . "
85520	85555	85511	85511	I	0	" When he was gone out , and had closed the door behind him , Harold , turning round and flashing , in spite of himself , an angry look at Jermyn , said , "
85576	85629	85569	85569	you	0	" Jermyn turned perceptibly paler , but disagreeables of this sort between himself and Harold had been too much in his anticipations of late for him to be taken by surprise . He turned quietly round and just touched the shoulder of the person seated at the bureau , who now rose . "
85634	85638	85569	85569	you	0	" Jermyn answered , "
85776	85777	85778	85778	Makepiece	333	" "
85789	85815	85787	85787	Putty	332	" said the glib Johnson , too vain not to be pleased with an opportunity of speaking , even when the situation was rather awkward . "
85831	85840	85787	85787	Putty	332	" he went on , turning to Harold ; "
86169	86186	86212	86212	I	0	" — here Johnson played with his watch - seals and balanced himself a moment on his toes—"the
86308	86431	86435	86436	Mr Johnson	302	" It had been impossible to interrupt Johnson before , without the most impolitic rudeness . Jermyn was not sorry that he should talk , even if he made a fool of himself ; for in that solid shape , exhibiting the average amount of human foibles , he seemed less of the alias which Harold had insinuated him to be , and had all the additional plausibility of a lie with a circumstance . Harold had thrown himself with contemptuous resignation into a chair , had drawn off one of his buff gloves , and was looking at his hand . But when Johnson gave his iteration with a slightly slackened pace , Harold looked up at him and broke in , "
86473	86474	86476	86476	me	0	" "
86783	86795	86764	86765	a man	4886	indeed"—here Mr Johnson 's mouth took an expression at once bitter and pathetic—"that
86858	86948	86849	86851	the cleverest man	2592	" Mr Johnson 's argument was not the less stringent because his idioms were vulgar . It requires a conviction and resolution amounting to heroism not to wince at phrases that class our foreshadowed endurance among those common and ignominious troubles which the world is more likely to sneer at than to pity . Harold remained a few moments in angry silence looking at the floor , with one hand on his knee , and the other on his hat , as if he were preparing to start up . "
86960	86974	86975	86975	I	0	" said Johnson , throwing in this observation as something into the bargain , "
87082	87083	87075	87075	I	0	" "
87092	87116	87086	87087	the exposition	2600	" said Harold , scornfully , his dislike of the man Johnson 's personality being stimulated by causes which Jermyn more than conjectured . "
87144	87145	87137	87137	I	0	" "
87173	87369	87164	87164	I	0	" said Johnson , passing out quickly . Harold knew that he was indulging his temper , and he would probably have restrained it as a foolish move if he had thought there was great danger in it . But he was beginning to drop much of his caution and self - mastery where Jermyn was concerned , under the growing conviction that the attorney had very strong reasons for being afraid of him ; reasons which would only be reinforced by any action hostile to the Transome interest . As for a sneak like this Johnson , a gentleman had to pay him , not to please him . Harold had smiles at command in the right place , but he was not going to smile when it was neither necessary nor agreeable . He was one of those good - humoured , yet energetic men , who have the gift of anger , hatred , and scorn upon occasion , though they are too healthy and self - contented for such feelings to get generated in them without external occasion . And in relation to Jermyn the gift was coming into fine exercise . "
87378	87390	87375	87376	Mr Harold	141	" said Jermyn , speaking as soon as Johnson went out , "
87446	87447	87428	87428	I	0	" "
87452	87456	87450	87450	yourself	141	" said Harold . "
87487	87488	87483	87483	my	0	" "
87497	87511	87483	87483	my	0	" said Jermyn , who could be idiomatic enough when he was stung , "
87524	87525	87483	87483	my	0	" "
87548	87549	87540	87540	You	2610	" "
87573	87574	87564	87564	he	302	" "
87618	87708	87709	87709	He	2616	" When Harold was gone , Jermyn 's handsome face gathered blackness . He hardly ever wore his worst expression in the presence of others , and but seldom when he was alone , for he was not given to believe that any game would ultimately go against him . His luck had been good . New conditions might always turn up to give him new chances ; and if affairs threatened to come to an extremity between Harold and himself , he trusted to finding some sure resource . "
87727	87733	87719	87719	he	2616	" said Jermyn to himself . "
87873	88483	88484	88484	their	2620	" In this way Mr Jermyn inwardly appealed against an unjust construction which he foresaw that his old acquaintance the Law might put on certain items in his history . I have known persons who have been suspected of undervaluing gratitude , and excluding it from the list of virtues ; but on closer observation it has been seen that , if they have never felt grateful , it has been for want of an opportunity ; and that , far from despising gratitude , they regard it as the virtue most of all incumbent — on others towards them . Wordsworth : Tintern Abbey . Jermyn did not forget to pay his visit to the minister in Malthouse Yard that evening . The mingled irritation , dread , and defiance which he was feeling towards Harold Transome in the middle of the day , depended on too many and far - stretching causes to be dissipated by eight o'clock ; but when he left Mr Lyon 's house he was in a state of comparative triumph in the beleif that he , and he alone , was now in possession of facts which , once grouped together , made a secret that gave him new power over Harold . Mr Lyon , in his need for help from one who had that wisdom of the serpent which , he argued , is not forbidden , but is only of hard acquirement to dove - like innocence , had been gradually led to pour out to the attorney all the reasons which made him desire to know the truth about the man who called himself Maurice Christian : he had shown all the precious relics , the locket , the letters , and the marriage certificate . And Jermyn had comforted him by confidently promising to ascertain , without scandal or premature betrayals , whether this man were really Annette 's husband , Maurice Christian Bycliffe . Jermyn was not rash in making this promise , since he had excellent reasons for believing that he had already come to a true conclusion on the subject . But he wished both to know a little more of this man himself , and to keep Mr Lyon in ignorance — not a difficult precaution — in an affair which it cost the minister so much pain to speak of . An easy opportunity of getting an interview with Christian was sure to offer itself before long — might even offer itself to - morrow . Jermyn had seen him more than once , though hitherto without any reason for observing him with interest ; he had heard that Philip Debarry 's courier was often busy in the town , and it seemed especially likely that he would be seen there when the Market was to be agitated by politics , and the new candidate was to show his paces . The world of which Treby Magna was the centre was naturally curious to see the young Transome , who had come from the East , was as rich as a Jew , and called himself a Radical ; characteristics all equally vague in the minds of various excellent ratepayers , who drove to market in their taxed carts , or in their hereditary gigs . Places at convenient windows had been secured beforehand for a few best bonnets ; but , in general , a Radical candidate excited no ardent feminine partisanship , even among the Dissenters in Treby , if they were of the prosperous and long - resident class . Some chapel - going ladies were fond of remembering that "
88490	88989	88484	88484	their	2620	" others objected to politics altogether as having spoiled old neighbourliness , and sundered friends who had kindred views as to cowslip wine and Michaelmas cleaning ; others , of the melancholy sort , said it would be well if people would think less of reforming Parliament and more of pleasing God . Irreproachable Dissenting matrons , like Mrs Muscat , whose youth had been passed in a short - waisted boddice and tight skirt , had never been animated by the struggle for liberty , and had a timid suspicion that religion was desecrated by being applied to the things of this world . Since Mr Lyon had been in Malthouse Yard there had been far too much mixing up of politics with religion ; but , at any rate , these ladies had never yet been to hear speechifying in the market - place , and they were not going to begin that practice . Esther , however , had heard some of her feminine acquaintances say that they intended to sit at the druggist 's upper window , and she was inclined to ask her father if he could think of a suitable place where she also might see and hear . Two inconsistent motives urged her . She knew that Felix cared earnestly for all public questions , and she supposed that he held it one of her deficiencies not to care about them : well , she would try to learn the secret of this ardour , which was so strong in him that it animated what she thought the dullest form of life . She was not too stupid to find it out . But this self - correcting motive was presently displaced by a motive of a different sort . It had been a pleasant variety in her monotonous days to see a man like Harold Transome , with a distinguished appearance and polished manners , and she would like to see him again : he suggested to her that brighter and more luxurious life on which her imagination dwelt without the painful effort it required to conceive the mental condition which would place her in complete sympathy with Felix Holt . It was this less unaccustomed prompting of which she was chiefly conscious when she awaited her father 's coming down to breakfast . Why , indeed , should she trouble herself so much about Felix ? Mr Lyon , more serene now that he had unbosomed his anxieties and obtained a promise of help , was already swimming so happily in the deep water of polemics in expectation of Philip Debarry 's answer to his challenge , that , in the occupation of making a few notes lest certain felicitous inspirations should be wasted , he had forgotten to come down to breakfast . Esther , suspecting his abstraction , went up to his study , and found him at his desk looking up with wonder at her interruption . "
89000	89001	88992	88992	father	5432	" "
89012	89023	89008	89008	I	0	" he said , lingering to make some final strokes . "
89029	89041	89008	89008	I	0	" said Esther , as he got up from his chair , "
89077	89284	89285	89285	Father	318	" He sat down obediently , while Esther took a towel , which she threw over his shoulders , and then brushed the thick long fringe of soft auburn hair . This very trifling act , which she had brought herself to for the first time yesterday , meant a great deal in Esther 's little history . It had been her habit to leave the mending of her father 's clothes to Lyddy ; she had not liked even to touch his cloth garments ; still less had it seemed a thing she would willingly undertake to correct his toilette , and use a brush for him . But having once done this , under her new sense of faulty omission , the affectionateness that was in her flowed so pleasantly , as she saw how much her father was moved by what he thought a great act of tenderness , that she quite longed to repeat it . This morning , as he sat under her hands , his face had such a calm delight in it that she could not help kissing the top of his bald head ; and afterwards , when they were seated at breakfast , she said , merrily , "
89314	89315	89287	89287	I	0	" "
89509	89510	89511	89511	You	0	" "
89525	89526	89529	89529	he	211	" "
89585	89593	89580	89580	He	211	" Mr Lyon went on , smiling , "
89612	89759	89760	89760	I	0	" Esther felt vexed with herself that her heart was suddently beating with unusual quickness , and that her last resolution not to trouble herself about what Felix thought , had transformed itself with magic swiftness into mortification that he evidently avoided coming to the house when she was there , though he used to come on the slightest occasion . He knew that she was always at home until the afternoon on market days ; that was the reason why he would not call for her father . Of course , it was because he attributed such littleness to her that he supposed she would retain nothing else than a feeling of offence towards him for what he had said to her . Such distrust of any good in others , such arrogance of immeasurable superiority , was extremely ungenerous . But presently she said , "
89783	89784	89785	89785	I	0	" "
89804	89820	89790	89790	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , who could not bear to deny Esther any lawful wish . "
89856	90546	89845	89845	he	141	" Esther was glad of the proposal , because , if it answered no other purpose , it would be an easy way of obliging Felix to see her , and of showing him that it was not she who cherished offence . But when , later in the morning , she was walking towards Mrs Holt 's with her father , they met Mr Jermyn , who stopped them to ask , in his most affable manner , whether Miss Lyon intended to hear the candidate , and whether she had secured a suitable place . And he ended by insisting that his daughters , who were presently coming in an open carriage , should call for her , if she would permit them . It was impossible to refuse this civility , and Esther turned back to await the carriage , pleased with the certainty of hearing and seeing , yet sorry to miss Felix . There was another day for her to think of him with unsatisfied resentment , mixed with some longings for a better understanding ; and in our spring - time every day has its hidden growths in the mind , as it has in the earth when the little folded blades are getting ready to pierce the ground . It was only in the time of the summer fairs that the market - place had ever looked more animated than it did under that autumn mid - day sun . There were plenty of blue cockades and streamers , faces at all the windows , and a crushing buzzing crowd , urging each other backwards and forwards round the small hustings in front of the Ram Inn , which showed its more plebeian sign at right angles with the venerable Marquis of Granby . Sometimes there were scornful shouts , sometimes a rolling cascade of cheers , sometimes the shriek of a penny whistle ; but above all these fitful and feeble sounds , the fine old church - tower , which looked down from above the trees on the other side of the narrow stream , sent vibrating , at every quarter , the sonorous tones of its great bell , the Good Queen Bess . Two carriages , with blue ribbons on the harness , were conspicuous near the hustings . One was Jermyn 's , filled with the brilliantly - attired daughters , accompanied by Esther , whose quieter dress helped to mark her out for attention as the most striking of the group . The other was Harold Transome 's ; but in this there was no lady — only the olive - skinned Dominic , whose acute yet mild face was brightened by the occupation of amusing little Harry and rescuing from his tyrannies a King Charles puppy , with big eyes , much after the pattern of the boy 's . This Trebian crowd did not count for much in the political force of the nation , but it was not the less determined as to lending or not lending its ears . No man was permitted to speak from the platform except Harold and his uncle Lingon , though , in the interval of expectation , several Liberals had come forward . Among these ill - advised persons the one whose attempt met the most emphatic resistance was Rufus Lyon . This might have been taken for resentment at the unreasonableness of the cloth , that , not content with pulpits , from whence to tyrannise over the ears of men , wishes to have the larger share of the platforms ; but it was not so , for Mr Lingon was heard with much cheering , and would have been welcomed again . The Rector of Little Treby had been a favourite in the neighbourhood since the beginning of the century . A clergyman thoroughly unclerical in his habits had a piquancy about him which made him a sort of practical joke . He had always been called Jack Lingon , or Parson Jack — sometimes , in older and less serious days , even "
90552	90625	90626	90631	a charicter"—something cheerful to think of	6676	" He swore a little when the point of a joke seemed to demand it , and was fond of wearing a coloured bandana tied loosely over his cravat , together with large brown leather leggings ; he spoke in a pithy familiar way that people could understand , and had none of that frigid mincingness called dignity , which some have thought a peculiar clerical disease . In fact , he was "
90627	90706	89845	89845	he	141	charicter"—something cheerful to think of , not entirely out of connection with Sunday and sermons . And it seemed in keeping that he should have turned sharp round in politics , his opinions being only part of the excellent joke called Parson Jack . When his red eagle face and white hair were seen on the platform , the Dissenters hardly cheered this questionable Radical ; but to make amends , all the Tory farmers gave him a friendly "
90709	90710	89845	89845	he	141	" "
90722	90730	90731	90731	he	343	" was the predominant feeling among them ; "
90745	90785	90731	90731	he	343	" It was only Lawyer Labron 's young clerks and their hangers - on who were sufficiently dead to Trebian traditions to assail the parson with various sharp - edged interjections , such as broken shells , and cries of "
90794	90795	90731	90731	he	343	" "
90802	90829	90830	90830	I	0	" he began , in his full , pompous , yet jovial tones , thrusting his hands into the stuffed - out pockets of his greatcoat , "
90868	90889	90894	90894	you	2637	" There was a roar of laughter and cheering as he threw handfuls of nuts and filberts among the crowd . "
91124	91702	91703	91703	Harold	141	" And my nephew here — he comes of a Tory breed , you know — I'll answer for the Lingons . In the old Tory times there was never a pup belonging to a Lingon but would howl if a Whig came near him . The Lingon blood is good , rich , old Tory blood — like good rich milk — and that 's why , when the right time comes , it throws up a Liberal cream . The best sort of Tory turns to the best sort of Radical . There 's plenty of Radical scum — I say , beware of the scum , and look out for the cream . And here 's my nephew — some of the cream , if there is any : none of your Whigs , none of your painted water that looks as if it ran , and it 's standing still all the while ; none of your spinning - jenny fellows . A gentleman ; but up to all sorts of business . I 'm no fool myself ; I 'm forced to wink a good deal , for fear of seeing too much , for a neighbourly man must let himself be cheated a little . But though I 've never been out of my own country , I know less about it than my nephew does . You may tell what he is , and only look at him . There 's one sort of fellow sees nothing but the end of his own nose , and another sort that sees nothing but the hinder side of the moon ; but my nephew Harold is of another sort ; he sees everything that 's at hitting distance , and he 's not one to miss his mark . A good - looking man in his prime ! Not a greenhorn ; not a shrivelled old fellow , who 'll come to speak to you and find he 's left his teeth at home by mistake . Harold Transome will do you credit ; if anybody says the Radicals are a set of sneaks , Brummagem halfpennies , scamps who want to play pitch and toss with the property of the country , you can say , ' Look at the member for North Loamshire ! ' And mind what you 'll hear him say ; he 'll go in for making everything right — Poor - laws and Charities and Church — he wants to reform 'em all . Perhaps you 'll say , ' There 's that Parson Lingon talking about Church Reform — why , he belongs to the Church himself — he wants reforming too . ' Well , well , wait a bit , and you 'll hear by - and - by that old Parson Lingon is reformed — shoots no more , cracks his joke no more , has drunk his last bottle : the dogs , the old pointers , will be sorry ; but you 'll hear that the Parson at Little Treby is a new man . That 's what Church Reform is sure to come to before long . So now here are some more nuts for you , lads , and I leave you to listen to your candidate . Here he is — give him a good hurray ; wave your hats , and I 'll begin . Hurray ! "

92271	92312	92267	92267	Christian	327	" You 've not got grey as I have , Mr Lenoni ; you 're not a day older for the sixteen years . But no wonder you did n't know me ; I 'm bleached like a dried bone . "
92313	92364	92267	92267	Christian	327	" Not so . It is true I was confused a meenute — I could put your face nowhere ; but after that , Naples came behind it , and I said , Mr Creestian . And so you reside at the Manor , and I am at Transome Court . "
92365	92390	92392	92392	Christian	327	" Ah ! it 's a thousand pities you 're not on our side , else we might have dined together at the Marquis , "
92394	92402	92403	92403	he	327	" Eh , could you manage it ? "
92417	92440	92403	92403	he	327	" No — much obliged — couldn't leave the leetle boy . Ahi ! Arry , Arry , pinch not poor Moro . "
92513	92519	92521	92521	Christian	327	" Who are those ladies ? "
92545	92553	92555	92555	Dominic	148	" They are Meester Jermyn 's daughters , "

92618	92628	92630	92630	Jermyn	142	" Does he see some likeness in the girl ? "
92637	92655	92630	92630	Jermyn	142	" I wish I had n't invited her to come in the carriage , as it happens . "

93611	93672	93592	93592	he	355	" Transome may be returned , or he may not be returned — that 's a question for North Loamshire ; but it makes little difference to the kingdom . I do n't want to say things which may put younger men out of spirits , but I believe this country has seen its best days — I do indeed . "
93673	93689	93691	93692	the brewer	2709	" I am sorry to hear it from one of your experience , Mr Nolan , "
93701	93908	93691	93692	the brewer	2709	" I 'd make a good fight myself before I 'd leave a worse world for my boys than I 've found for myself . There is n't a greater pleasure than doing a bit of planting and improving one 's buildings , and investing one 's money in some pretty acres of land , when it turns up here and there — land you 've known from a boy . It 's a nasty thought that these Radicals are to turn things round so as one can calculate no nothing . One does n't like it for one 's self , and one does n't like it for one 's neighbours . But somehow , I believe it wo n't do : if we ca n't trust the Government just now , there 's Providence and the good sense of the country ; and there 's a right in things — that 's what I 've always said — there 's a right in things . The heavy end will get downmost . And if Church and King , and every man being sure of his own , are things good for this country , there 's a God above will take care of 'em . "
93909	93919	93921	93922	Mr Nolan—"it	6761	" It wo n't do , my dear sir , "
93922	93994	93921	93922	Mr Nolan—"it	6761	Nolan—"it wo n't do . When Peel and the Duke turned round about the Catholics in ' 29 , I saw it was all over with us . We could never trust ministers any more . It was to keep off a rebellion , they said ; but I say it was to keep their places . They 're monstrously fond of place , both of them — that I know . "

If we 'd had that , we should n't have heard what we 've heard to - day ; Reform would never have come to this pass . When our good old King George the Third heard his ministers talking about Catholic Emancipation , he boxed their ears all round . Ah , poor soul ! he did indeed , gentlemen , "
94110	94122	94124	94125	Mr Crowder	272	" Well , now , that 's something like a king , "
94133	94146	94148	94150	Mr Timothy Rose	364	" It was uncivil , though . How did they take it ? "

94213	94225	94229	94230	young Joyce	365	" Take it ! they 'd be obliged to take it , "
94238	94249	94229	94230	young Joyce	365	" Have you ever heard of the king 's prerogative ? "
94250	94260	94262	94262	Rose	364	" I do n't say but what I have , "
94266	94277	94262	94262	Rose	364	" I 've nothing against it — nothing at all . "
94278	94286	94288	94289	young Joyce	365	" No , but the Radicals have , "
94293	94333	94288	94289	young Joyce	365	" The prerogative is what they want to clip close . They want us to be governed by delegates from the trades - unions , who are to dictate to everybody , and make everything square to their mastery . "
94334	94346	94348	94349	Mr Wace	197	" They 're a pretty set , now , those delegates , "
94354	94483	94348	94349	Mr Wace	197	" I once heard two of 'em spouting away . They 're a sort of fellow I 'd never employ in my brewery , or anywhere else . I 've seen it again and again . If a man takes to tongue - work it 's all over with him . ' Everything 's wrong , ' says he . That 's a big text . But does he want to make everything right ? Not he . He 'd lose his text . ' We want every man 's good , ' say they . Why , they never knew yet what a man 's good is . How should they ? It 's working for his victual — not getting a slice of other people 's . "
94484	94489	94491	94492	young Joyce	365	" Ay , ay , "
94496	94554	94491	94492	young Joyce	365	" I should just have liked all the delegates in the country mustered for our yeomanry to go into — that 's all . They 'd see where the strength of Old England lay then . You may tell what it is for a country to trust to trade when it breeds such spindling fellows as those . "
94555	94568	94570	94571	Mr Nolan	355	" That is n't the fault of trade , my good sir , "
94586	94774	94775	94776	Mr Nolan	355	" Trade , properly conducted , is good for a man 's constitution . I could have shown you , in my time , weavers past seventy , with all their faculties as sharp as a penknife , doing without spectacles . It 's the new system of trade that 's to blame : a country ca n't have too much trade , if it 's properly managed . Plenty of sound Tories have made their fortune by trade . You 've heard of Calibut & Co.—everybody has heard of Calibut . Well , sir , I knew old Mr Calibut as well as I know you . He was once a crony of mine in a city warehouse ; and now , I 'll answer for it , he has a larger rent - roll than Lord Wyvern . Bless your soul ! his subscriptions to charities would make a fine income for a nobleman . And he 's as good a Tory as I am . And as for his town establishment — why , how much butter do you think is consumed there annually ? "
94793	94872	94787	94787	he	355	" Why , gentlemen , not less than two thousand pounds of butter during the few months the family is in town ! Trade makes property , my good sir , and property is Conservative , as they say now . Calibut 's son - in - law is Lord Fortinbras . He paid me a large debt on his marriage . It 's all one web , sir . The prosperity of the country is one web . "
94873	94878	94880	94880	Christian	327	" To be sure , "
94906	94933	94787	94787	he	355	" We ca n't do without nobility . Look at France . When they got rid of the old nobles they were obliged to make new . "
94934	94940	94942	94943	Mr Nolan	355	" True , very true , "
94969	95097	95098	95099	Mr Nolan	355	" It 's the French Revolution that has done us harm here . It was the same at the end of the last century , but the war kept it off — Mr Pitt saved us . I knew Mr Pitt . I had a particular interview with him once . He joked me about getting the length of his foot . ' Mr Nolan , ' said he , ' there are those on the other side of the water whose name begins with N. who would be glad to know what you know . ' I was recommended to send an account of that to the newspapers after his death , poor man ! but I 'm not fond of that kind of show myself . "
95124	95132	95134	95135	Mr Wace	197	" No , no , very right , "
95139	95245	95247	95248	Mr Wace	197	" But you never said a truer word than that about property . If a man 's got a bit of property , a stake in the country , he 'll want to keep things square . Where Jack is n't safe , Tom 's in danger . But that 's what makes it such an uncommonly nasty thing that a man like Transome should take up with these Radicals . It 's my belief he does it only to get into Parliament ; he 'll turn round when he gets there . Come , Dibbs , there 's something to put you in spirits , "
95263	95315	95251	95251	his	197	" You 've got to vote for a Radical with one side of your mouth , and make a wry face with the other ; but he 'll turn round by - and - by . As Parson Jack says , he 's got the right sort of blood in him . "
95316	95328	95330	95330	Dibbs	369	" I do n't care two straws who I vote for , "
95334	95396	95330	95330	Dibbs	369	" I 'm not going to make a wry face . It stands to reason a man should vote for his landlord . My farm 's in good condition , and I 've got the best pasture on the estate . The rot 's never come nigh me . Let them grumble as are on the wrong side of the hedge . "
95397	95408	95410	95411	Mr Sircome	278	" I wonder if Jermyn'll bring him in , though , "
95417	95452	95410	95411	Mr Sircome	278	" He 's an uncommon fellow for carrying things through . I know he brought me through that suit about my weir ; it cost a pretty penny , but he brought me through . "
95453	95471	95473	95474	Mr Wace	197	" It 's a bit of a pill for him , too , having to turn Radical , "
95476	95500	95473	95474	Mr Wace	197	" They say he counted on making friends with Sir Maximus , by this young one coming home and joining with Mr Philip . "
95501	95513	95515	95516	Mr Sircome	278	" But I 'll bet a penny he brings Transome in , "
95518	95570	95515	95516	Mr Sircome	278	" Folks say he has n't got many votes hereabout ; but towards Duffield , and all there , where the Radicals are , everybody 's for him . Eh , Mr Christian ? Come — you're at the fountainhead — what do they say about it now at the Manor ? "
95635	95649	95651	95651	Christian	264	" They think it will be a hard run between Transome and Garstin , "
95653	95662	95651	95651	Christian	264	" It depends on Transome 's getting plumpers . "
95663	95675	95677	95678	Mr Wace	197	" Well , I know I shall not split for Garstin , "
95680	95705	95677	95678	Mr Wace	197	" It 's nonsense for Debarry 's voters to split for a Whig . A man 's either a Tory or not a Tory . "
95706	95718	95720	95722	Mr Timothy Rose	364	" It seems reasonable there should be one of each side , "
95724	95755	95720	95722	Mr Timothy Rose	364	" I do n't like showing favour either way . If one side ca n't lower the Poor 's rates and take off the Tithe , let the other try . "
95756	95766	95768	95769	Mr Sircome	278	" But there 's this in it , Wace , "
95771	95839	95768	95769	Mr Sircome	278	" I 'm not altogether against the Whigs . For they do n't want to go so far as the Radicals do , and when they find they 've slipped a bit too far , they 'll hold on all the tighter . And the Whigs have got the upper hand now , and it 's no use fighting with the current . I run with the — "
95857	95862	95843	95843	himself	278	with—"eh , Mr Nolan ? "
95863	95878	95880	95881	Mr Nolan	355	" There have been eminent Whigs , sir . Mr Fox was a Whig , "
95883	96051	95880	95881	Mr Nolan	355	" Mr Fox was a great orator . He gambled a good deal . He was very intimate with the Prince of Wales . I 've seen him , and the Duke of York too , go home by daylight with their hats crushed . Mr Fox was a great leader of Opposition : Government requires an Opposition . The Whigs should always be in opposition , and the Tories on the ministerial side . That 's what the country used to like . ' The Whigs for salt and mustard , the Tories for meat , ' Mr Gottlib the banker used to say to me . Mr Gottlib was a worthy man . When there was a great run on Gottlib 's bank in ' 16 , I saw a gentleman come in with bags of gold , and say , ' Tell Mr Gottlib there 's plenty more where that came from . ' It stopped the run , gentlemen — it did indeed . "
96069	96101	96061	96062	Mr Sircome	278	" There now , you see , Wace — it 's right there should be Whigs as well as Tories — Pitt and Fox — I've always heard them go together . "
96102	96111	96113	96114	the brewer	2709	" Well , I do n't like Garstin , "
96116	96154	96113	96114	the brewer	2709	" I did n't like his conduct about the Canal Company . Of the two , I like Transome best . If a nag is to throw me , I say , let him have some blood . "
96155	96162	96164	96165	Mr Salt	375	" As for blood , Wace , "
96186	96208	96164	96165	Mr Salt	375	" ask my brother - in - law Labron a little about that . These Transomes are not the old blood . "
96209	96223	96225	96226	Mr Wace	197	" Well , they 're the oldest that 's forthcoming , I suppose , "
96230	96250	96225	96226	Mr Wace	197	" Unless you believe in mad old Tommy Trounsem . I wonder where that old poaching fellow is now . "
96251	96262	96264	96265	young Joyce	365	" I saw him half - drunk the other day , "
96267	96285	96264	96265	young Joyce	365	" He 'd got a flag - basket with hand - bills in it over his shoulder . "
96286	96295	96297	96298	Mr Wace	197	" I thought the old fellow was dead , "
96300	96307	96308	96308	he	197	" Hey ! why , Jermyn , "
96323	96370	96308	96308	he	197	" you Radical ! how dare you show yourself in this Tory house ? Come , this is going a bit too far . We do n't mind Old Harry managing our law for us — that 's his proper business from time immemorial ; but — "
96371	96376	96378	96378	Jermyn	142	" But — a — "
96401	96413	96392	96392	his	142	" if he meddles with politics he must be a Tory . "
96500	96521	96523	96524	Mr Wace	197	" We were talking about old Tommy Trounsem ; you remember him ? They say he 's turned up again , "
96526	96529	96531	96531	Jermyn	142	" Ah ? "
96535	96597	96531	96531	Jermyn	142	" But — a — Wace — I'm very busy to - day — but I wanted to see you about that bit of land of yours at the corner of Pod 's End . I 've had a handsome offer for you — I'm not at liberty to say from whom — but an offer that ought to tempt you . "
96598	96605	96607	96608	Mr Wace	197	" It wo n't tempt me , "
96612	96635	96607	96608	Mr Wace	197	" if I 've got a bit of land , I 'll keep it . It 's hard enought to get hereabouts . "
96636	96648	96650	96650	Jermyn	142	" Then I 'm to understand that you refuse all negotiation ? "
96695	96718	96684	96684	he	142	" Unless one of the confounded railways should come . But then I 'll stand out and make 'em bleed for it . "
96737	96748	96750	96750	Jermyn	142	" A — Mr Philip Debarry at the Manor now ? "
96769	96772	96774	96774	Christian	264	" No , "
96776	96785	96774	96774	Christian	264	" he is expected to - morrow morning . "
96786	96790	96791	96791	Jermyn	142	" Ah ! — "
96802	96824	96791	96791	Jermyn	142	" You are sufficiently in his confidence , I think , to carry a message to him with a small document ? "
96825	96835	96837	96837	Christian	264	" Mr Debarry has often trusted me so far , "
96843	96861	96837	96837	Christian	264	" but if the business is yours , you can probably find some one you know better . "
96879	96886	96888	96888	Jermyn	142	" A — true — a , "
96895	96946	96888	96888	Jermyn	142	" if you decline . But I think , if you will do me the favour to step round to my residence on your way back , and learn the business , you will prefer carrying it yourself . At my residence , if you please — not my office . "
96947	96952	96954	96954	Christian	264	" O very well , "
96956	96963	96954	96954	Christian	264	" I shall be very happy . "
96993	97006	97008	97008	Jermyn	142	" Will it be five o'clock ? what hour shall we say ? "
97018	97026	97010	97010	Christian	264	" About five I can be there . "
97027	97031	97033	97033	Jermyn	142	" Very good , "
97039	97058	97033	97033	Jermyn	142	" Well — a — Wace — a — so you will hear nothing about Pod 's End ? "
97059	97062	97010	97010	Christian	264	" Not I. "
97063	97078	97033	97033	Jermyn	142	" A mere pocket - handkerchief , not enough to swear by — a — "
97086	97092	97010	97010	Christian	264	smile—"without a magnifying - glass . "
97093	97130	97010	97010	Christian	264	" Never mind . It 's mine into the bowels of the earth and up to the sky . I can build the Tower of Babel on it if I like — eh , Mr Nolan ? "
97131	97140	97142	97143	Mr Nolan	355	" A bad investment , my good sir , "
97167	97177	97179	97179	Jermyn	142	" See now , how blind you Tories are , "
97183	97228	97229	97229	Jermyn	142	" if I had been you lawyer , I 'd have had you make another forty - shilling freeholder with that land , and all in time for this election . But — a — the verbum sapientibus comes a little too late now . "
97246	97278	97239	97240	Mr Wace	197	" We 're not so badly off for votes as you are — good sound votes , that 'll stand the Revising Barrister . Debarry at the top of the poll ! "
97402	97487	97397	97397	he	264	" These lawyers are the fellows for getting on in the world with the least expense of civility . With this cursed conjuring secret of theirs called Law , they think everybody 's frightened at them . My Lord Jermyn seems to have his insolence as ready as his soft sawder . He 's as sleek as a rat , and has as vicious a tooth . I know the sort of vermin well enough . I 've helped to fatten one or two . "
97616	97620	97608	97609	the footman	2779	" Mr Christian , "
97624	97634	97621	97621	Jermyn	169	" Good evening , Mr Christian . Be seated , "
97645	97661	97662	97662	He	264	" Light the candles on the shelf , John , but leave the blinds alone . "
97735	97747	97757	97757	he	264	" A — your name — a — is Henry Scaddon . "
97800	97890	97793	97793	Jermyn	169	" You were born on the 16th of December 1782 , at Blackheath . Your father was a cloth - merchant in London : he died when you were barely of age , leaving an extensive business ; before you were five - and - twenty you had run through the greater part of the property , and had compromised your safety by an attempt to defraud your creditors . Subsequently you forged a cheque on your father 's elder brother , who had intended to make you his heir "
97906	98120	97902	97902	Christian	264	" In 1808 you found it expedient to leave this country in a military disguise , and were taken prisoner by the French . On the occasion of an exchange of prisoners you had the opportunity of returning to your own country , and to the bosom of your own family . You were generous enough to sacrifice that prospect in favour of a fellow - prisoner , of about your own age and figure , who had more pressing reasons than yourself for wishing to be on this side of the water . You exchanged dress , luggage , and names with him , and he passed to England instead of you as Henry Scaddon . Almost immediately afterwards you escaped from your imprisonment , after feigning an illness which prevented your exchange of names from being discovered ; and it was reported that you — that is , you under the name of your fellow - prisoner — were drowned in an open boat , trying to reach a Neapolitan vessel bound for Malta . Nevertheless I have to congratulate you on the falsehood of that report , and on the certainty that you are now , after the lapse of more than twenty years , seated here in perfect safety . "
98143	98193	98135	98135	Christian	264	" Well , sir , I 've heard much longer stories than that told quite as solemnly , when there was not a word of truth in them . Suppose I deny the very peg you hang your statement on . Suppose I say I am not Henry Scaddon . "
98194	98203	98205	98205	Jermyn	169	" A — in that case — a , "
98211	98289	98205	98205	Jermyn	169	" you would lose the advantage which — a — may attach to your possession of Henry Scaddon 's knowledge . And at the same time , if it were in the least — a — inconvenient to you that you should be recognised as Henry Scaddon , your denial would not prevent me from holding the knowledge and evidence which I possess on that point ; it would only prevent us from pursuing the present conversation . "
98290	98329	98135	98135	Christian	264	" Well , sir , suppose we admit , for the sake of the conversation , that your account of the matter is the true one : what advantage have you to offer the man named Henry Scaddon ? "
98330	98436	98135	98135	Christian	264	" The advantage — a — is problematical ; but it may be considerable . It might , in fact , release you from the necessity of acting as courier , or — a — valet , or whatever other office you may occupy which prevents you from being your own master . On the other hand , my acquaintance with your secret is not necessarily a disadvantage to you . To put the matter in a nutshell , I am not inclined — a — gratuitously — to do you any harm , and I may be able to do you a considerable service . "
98437	98446	98448	98448	Christian	264	" Which you want me to earn somehow ? "
98450	98460	98448	98448	Christian	264	" You offer me a turn in a lottery ? "
98461	98565	98135	98135	Christian	264	" Precisely . The matter in question is of no earthly interest to you , except — a — as it may yield you a prize . We lawyers have to do with complicated questions , and — a — legal subtleties , which are never — a — fully known even to the parties immediately interested , still less to the witnesses . Shall we agree , then , that you continue to retain two - thirds of the name which you gained by exchange , and that you oblige me by answering certain questions as to the experience of Henry Scaddon ? "
98566	98573	98135	98135	Christian	264	" Very good . Go on . "
98574	98597	98135	98135	Christian	264	" What articles of property , once belonging to your fellow - prisoner , Maurice Christian Bycliffe , do you still retain ? "
98598	98602	98604	98604	Christian	264	" This ring , "
98617	98752	98604	98604	Christian	264	" his watch , and the little matters that hung with it , and a case of papers . I got rid of a gold snuff - box once when I was hard - up . The clothes are all gone , of course . We exchanged everything ; it was all done in a hurry . Bycliffe thought we should meet again in England before long , and he was mad to get there . But that was impossible — I mean that we should meet soon after . I do n't know what 's become of him , else I would give him up his papers and the watch , and so on — though , you know , it was I who did him the service , and he felt that . "
98753	98765	98135	98135	Christian	264	" You were at Vesoul together before being moved to Verdun ? "
98766	98769	98135	98135	Christian	264	" Yes . "
98770	98779	98604	98604	Christian	264	" What else do you know about Bycliffe ? "
98780	98787	98789	98789	Christian	327	" O , nothing very particular , "
98801	98875	98798	98798	his	327	" He 'd been in the Hanoverian army — a high - spirited fellow , took nothing easily ; not overstrong in health . He made a fool of himself with marrying at Vesoul ; and there was the devil to pay with the girl 's relations ; and then , when the prisoners were ordered off , they had to part . Whether they ever got together again I do n't know . "
98876	98885	98604	98604	Christian	264	" Was the marriage all right , then ? "
98886	98916	98604	98604	Christian	264	" O , all on the square — civil marriage , church — everything . Bycliffe was a fool — a good - natured , proud , headstrong fellow . "
98917	98930	98798	98798	his	327	" How long did the marriage take place before you left Vesoul ? "
98931	98944	98604	98604	Christian	264	" About three months . I was a witness to the marriage . "
98945	98955	98604	98604	Christian	264	" And you know no more about the wife ? "
98956	99024	98798	98798	his	327	" Not afterwards . I knew her very well before — pretty Annette — Annette Ledru was her name . She was of a good family , and they had made up a fine match for her . But she was one of your meek little diablesses , who have a will of their own once in their lives — the will to choose their own master . "
99025	99037	98604	98604	Christian	264	" Bycliffe was not open to you about his other affairs ? "
99038	99111	98604	98604	Christian	264	" O no — a fellow you would n't dare to ask a question of . People told him everything , but he told nothing in return . If Madame Annette ever found him again , she found her lord and master with a vengeance ; but she was a regular lapdog . However , her family shut her up — made a prisoner of her — to prevent her running away . "
99112	99211	98798	98798	his	327	" Ah — good . Much of what you have been so obliging as to say is irrelevant to any possible purpose of mine , which , in fact , has to do only with a mouldy law - case that might be aired some day . You will doubtless , on your own account , maintain perfect silence on what has passed between us , and with that condition duly preserved — a — it is possible that — a — the lottery you have put into — as you observe — may turn up a prize . "
99212	99226	99228	99228	Christian	327	" This , then , is all the business you have with me ? "
99232	99264	99228	99228	Christian	327	" All . You will , of course , preserve carefully all the papers and other articles which have so many — a — recollections — a — attached to them ? "
99265	99318	98798	98798	his	327	" O yes . If there 's any chance of Bycliffe turning up again , I shall be sorry to have parted with the snuff - box ; but I was hard - up at Naples . In fact , as you see , I was obliged at last to turn courier . "
99319	99340	99342	99342	Jermyn	169	" An exceedingly agreeable life for a man of some — a — accomplishments and — a — no income , "
99394	99421	99388	99388	he	327	" I think you 're too clever , Mr Jermyn , not to perceive that I 'm not a man to be made a fool of . "
99422	99438	99440	99440	Jermyn	169	" Well — a — it may perhaps be a still better guarantee for you , "
99444	99458	99440	99440	Jermyn	169	" that I see no use in attempting that — a — metamorphosis . "
99459	99490	99388	99388	he	327	" The old gentleman , who ought never to have felt himself injured , is dead now , and I 'm not afraid of creditors after more than twenty years . "
99491	99532	99533	99533	Jermyn	169	" Certainly not;—a — there may indeed be claims which ca n't assert themselves — a — legally , which yet are molesting to a man of some reputation . But you may perhaps be happily free from such fears . "
99553	99558	99543	99543	Christian	327	" Good - day , "
99970	100127	99965	99965	he	1393	" Now , Mr Harold , I shall shut up this affair in a private drawer till you choose to take any extreme measures which will force me to bring it out . I have the matter entirely in my own power . No one but old Lyon knows about the girl 's birth . No one but Scaddon can clench the evidence about Bycliffe , and I 've got Scaddon under my thumb . No soul except myself and Johnson , who is a limb of myself , knows that there is one half - dead life which may presently leave the girl a new claim to the Bycliffe heirship . I shall learn through Methurst whether Batt & Cowley knew , through Bycliffe , of this woman having come to England . I shall hold all the threads between my thumb and finger . I can use the evidence or I can nullify it . "
100166	100795	100796	100796	Papa	256	" He rose , put out his candles , and stood with his back to the fire , looking out on the dim lawn , with its black twilight fringe of shrubs , still meditating . Quick thought was gleaming over five - and - thirty years filled with devices more or less clever , more or less desirable to be avowed . Those which might be avowed with impunity were not always to be distinguished as innocent by comparison with those which it was advisable to conceal . In a profession where much that is noxious may be done without disgrace , is a conscience likely to be without balm when circumstances have urged a man to overstep the line where his good technical information makes him aware that ( with discovery ) disgrace is likely to begin ? With regard to the Transome affairs , the family had been in pressing need of money , and it had lain with him to get it for them : was it to be expected that he would not consider his own advantage where he had rendered services such as are never fully paid ? If it came to a question of right and wrong instead of law , the least justifiable things he had ever done had been done on behalf of the Transomes . It had been a deucedly unpleasant thing for him to get Bycliffe arrested and thrown into prison as Henry Scaddon — perhaps hastening the man 's death in that way . But if it had not been done by dint of his ( Jermyn 's ) exertions and tact , he would like to know where the Durfey - Transomes might have been by this time . As for right or wrong , if the truth were known , the very possession of the estate by the Durfey - Transomes was owing to law - tricks that took place nearly a century ago , when the original old Durfey got his base fee . But inward argument of this sort now , as always , was merged in anger , in exasperation , that Harold , precisely Harold Transome , should have turned out to be the probable instrument of a visitation which would be bad luck , not justice ; for is there any justice where ninety - nine out of a hundred escape ? He felt himself beginning to hate Harold as he had never — Just then Jermyn 's third daughter , a tall slim girl wrapped in a white woollen shawl , which she had hung over her blanketwise , skipped across the lawn towards the greenhouse to get a flower . Jermyn was startled , and did not identify the figure , or rather he identified it falsely with another tall white - wrapped figure which had sometimes set his heart beating quickly more than thirty years before . For a moment he was fully back in those distant years when he and another bright - eyed person had seen no reason why they should not indulge their passion and their vanity , and determine for themselves how their lives should be made delightful in spite of unalterable external conditions . The reasons had been unfolding themselves gradually ever since through all the years which had converted the handsome , soft - eyed , slim young Jermyn ( with a touch of sentiment ) into a portly lawyer of sixty , for whom life had resolved itself into the means of keeping up his head among his professional brethren and maintaining an establishment — into a grey - haired husband and father , whose third affectionate and expensive daughter now rapped at the window and called to him , "
100815	100953	100810	100811	the Lukyns	385	" The evening of the market - day had passed , and Felix had not looked in at Malthouse Yard to talk over the public events with Mr Lyon . When Esther was dressing the next morning , she had reached a point of irritated anxiety to see Felix , at which she found herself devising little schemes for attaining that end in some way that would be so elaborate as to seem perfectly natural . Her watch had a long - standing ailment of losing ; possibly it wanted cleaning ; Felix would tell her if it merely wanted regulating , whereas Mr Prowd might detain it unnecessarily , and cause her useless inconvenience . Or could she not get a valuable hint from Mrs Holt about the home - made bread , which was something as "
100955	101072	100798	100798	papa	2800	" as Lyddy herself ? Or , if she came home that way at twelve o'clock , Felix might be going out , she might meet him , and not be obliged to call . Or — but it would be very much beneath her to take any steps of this sort . Her watch had been losing for the last two months — why should it not go on losing a little longer ? She could think of no devices that were not so transparent as to be undignified . All the more undignified because Felix chose to live in a way that would prevent any one from classing him according to his education and mental refinement—"which
101078	101094	100810	100811	the Lukyns	385	" said Esther inwardly , colouring , as if in answer to some contrary allegation , "
101106	101212	101100	101100	his	2801	" But she came to the conclusion that she could not possibly call at Mrs Holt 's . It followed that up to a few minutes past twelve , when she reached the turning towards Mrs Holt 's , she believed that she should go home the other way ; but at the last moment there is always a reason not existing before — namely , the impossibility of further vacillation . Esther turned the corner without any visible pause , and in another minute was knocking at Mrs Holt 's door , not without an inward flutter , which she was bent on disguising . "
101255	101256	101248	101248	I	0	" "
101274	101291	101269	101269	her	235	" said the ringing voice of Felix , surmounting various small shufflings and babbling voices within . "
101306	101314	101302	101302	I	0	" said Mrs Holt , making way ; "
101374	101375	101376	101376	I	0	" "
101393	101407	101384	101384	he	211	" said Esther , entering , and blushing a general rose - colour . "
101415	101423	101408	101408	He	211	" said Mrs Holt , with emphasis ; "
101434	101435	101430	101430	he	211	" "
101443	101447	101448	101448	I	0	" said Felix ; "
101456	101613	101448	101448	I	0	" Job was a small fellow about five , with a gernminal nose , large round blue eyes , and red hair that curled close to his head like the wool on the back of an infantine lamb . He had evidently been crying , and the corners of his mouth were still dolorous . Felix held him on his knee as he bound and tied up very cleverly a tiny forefinger . There was a table in front of Felix and against the window , covered with his watchmaking implements and some open books . Two benches stood at right angles on the sanded floor , and six or seven boys of various ages up to twelve were getting their caps and preparing to go home . They huddled themselves together and stood still when Esther entered . Felix could not look up till he had finished his surgery , but he went on speaking . "
101660	101697	101619	101620	Miss Lyon	235	" Esther seated herself on the end of the bench near Felix , much relieved that Job was the immediate object of attention ; and the other boys rushed out behind her with a brief chant of "
101701	101702	101619	101620	Miss Lyon	235	" "
101708	101718	101704	101704	you	2808	" said Mrs Holt , standing to look on , "
101775	101776	101777	101777	Mother	4844	" "
101779	101803	101777	101777	Mother	4844	" said Felix , who often amused himself and kept good - humoured by giving his mother answers that were unintelligible to her , "
101844	101876	101841	101842	Miss Lyon	235	" Esther had taken off her watch and was holding it in her hand . But he looked at her face , or rather at her eyes , as he said , "
101885	102008	101841	101842	Miss Lyon	235	" Esther 's expression was appealing and timid , as it had never been before in Felix 's presence ; but when she saw the perfect calmness , which to her seemed coldness , of his clear grey eyes , as if he saw no reason for attaching any emphasis to this first meeting , a pang swift as an electric shock darted through her . She had been very foolish to think so much of it . It seemed to her as if her inferiority to Felix made a great gulf between them . She could not at once rally her pride and self - command , but let her glance fall on her watch , and said , rather tremulously , "
102025	102056	102057	102057	You	2813	" Felix took the watch from her hand ; then , looking round and seeing that his mother was gone out of the room , he said , very gently , "
102072	102088	102064	102064	I	0	" ( Felix was thinking of the minister 's agitation on the previous Sunday ) . "
102102	102160	102161	102161	I	0	" Poor Esther was quite helpless . The mortification which had come like a bruise to all the sensibilities that had been in keen activity , insisted on some relief . Her eyes filled instantly , and a great tear rolled down while she said in a loud sort of whisper , as involuntary as her tears , "
102192	102323	102185	102185	you	0	" Was there ever more awkward speaking?—or any behaviour less like that of the graceful , self - possessed Miss Lyon , whose phrases were usually so well turned , and whose repartees were so ready ? For a moment there was silence . Esther had her two little delicately - gloved hands clasped on the table . The next moment she felt one hand of Felix covering them both and pressing them firmly ; but he did not speak . The tears were both on her cheeks now , and she could look up at him . His eyes had an expression of sadness in them , quite new to her . Suddenly little Job , who had his mental exercises on the occasion , called out , impatiently , "
102330	102359	102324	102324	She	2815	" Felix and Esther laughed , and drew their hands away ; and as Esther took her handkerchief to wipe the tears from her cheeks , she said , "
102382	102383	102371	102371	I	0	" "
102388	102413	102384	102384	Zoo	389	" said Job , energetically , being much impressed with a moral doctrine which had come to him after a sufficient transgression of it . "
102419	102423	102414	102414	Job	387	" said Felix , "
102440	102450	102433	102433	us	2818	" he went on , opening and examining it . "
102494	102513	102514	102514	You	2819	" Felix chatted , that Esther might recover herself ; but now Mrs Holt came back and apologised . "
102628	102629	102636	102636	mother	4844	" "
102638	102655	102636	102636	mother	4844	" said Felix , as he snapped the watch together , and handed it to Esther : "
102666	102667	102659	102659	you	4844	" "
102863	102903	102856	102856	I	0	" Mrs Holt looked hard out of the window and gave a slight inarticulate sound of scorn . Felix had leaned back in his chair with a resigned smile , and was pinching Job 's ears . Esther said , "
102912	102966	102904	102904	I	0	" not knowing what else to say , yet not wishing to go immediately , lest she should seem to be running away from Mrs Holt . She felt keenly how much endurance there must be for Felix . And she had often been discontented with her father , and called him tiresome ! "
102973	103009	103010	103010	Job	387	" she said , still sitting , and looking at the droll little figure , set off by a ragged jacket with a tail about two inches deep sticking out above the funniest of corduroys . "
103015	103019	103020	103020	He	387	" said Felix . "
103073	103143	103067	103067	she	5308	" The exquisite goodness implied in these words of Felix impressed Esther the more , because in her hearing his talk had usually been pungent and denunciatory . Looking at Mrs Holt , she saw that her eyes had lost their bleak north - easterly expression , and were shining with some mildness on little Job , who had turned round towards her , propping his head against Felix . "
103159	103186	103156	103157	Miss Lyon	235	" said Mrs Holt , whose strong powers of argument required the file of an imagined contradiction , if there were no real one at hand . "
103429	103430	103417	103417	he	2849	" "
103437	103442	103435	103435	mother	4844	" Felix burst in ; "
103501	103502	103503	103505	The Lord above	2858	" "
103526	103527	103515	103518	other folk 's children	2859	" "
103544	103563	103540	103541	Job Tudge	387	" said Felix , turning the little one round on his knee , and holding his head by the back—"Job
103658	103674	103655	103655	thy	235	Job"—Job , awe - struck under this ceremony , put out a little red tongue very timidly—"this
103735	103775	103728	103729	Big Job	231	" As Felix , speaking with the loud emphatic distinctness habitual to him , brought out this terribly familiar word , Job 's sense of mystification became too painful : he hung his lip , and began to cry . "
103779	103784	103785	103785	you	235	" said Mrs Holt , "
103808	103809	103813	103813	Job	231	" "
103818	103832	103813	103813	Job	231	" said Felix , setting the boy down and turning him towards Esther ; "
103856	103886	103898	103898	Job	231	" Job put his two brown fists on Esther 's lap , and she stooped to kiss him . Then holding his face between her hands , she said , "
103915	103941	103942	103942	I	0	" Esther rose and held out her hand to Mrs Holt , who kept it while she said , a little to Esther 's confusion , "
104043	104070	104027	104027	I	0	" Felix had risen and moved towards the door that he might open it and shield Esther from more last words on his mother 's part . "
104078	104079	104075	104076	Mr Holt	211	" "
104098	104099	104095	104095	you	211	" "
104110	104111	104103	104103	He	201	" "
104121	104122	104123	104123	She	2869	" "
104130	104135	104123	104123	She	2869	" said Mrs Holt . "
104181	104182	104170	104170	He	201	" "
104189	104240	104187	104187	mother	4844	" said Felix , sitting down , snatching up little Job , and finding a vent for some unspeakable feeling in the pretence of worrying him . Esther was rather melancholy as she went home , yet happier withal than she had been for many days before . She thought , "
104383	104392	104847	104847	I	0	" Esther felt that she had prefixed an impossible "
104394	104846	104847	104847	I	0	" to that result . But now she had known Felix , her conception of what a happy love must be had become like a dissolving view , in which the once - clear images were gradually melting into new forms and new colours . The favourite Byronic heroes were beginning to look something like last night 's decorations seen in the sober dawn . So fast does a little leaven spread within us — so incalculable is the effect of one personality on another . Behind all Esther 's thoughts , like an unacknowledged yet constraining presence , there was the sense , that if Felix Holt were to love her , her life would be exalted into something quite new — into a sort of difficult blessedness , such as one may imagine in beings who are conscious of painfully growing into the possession of higher powers . It was quite true that Felix had not thought the more of Esther because of that Sunday afternoon 's interview which had shaken her mind to the very roots . He had avoided intruding on Mr Lyon without special reason , because he believed the minister to be preoccupied with some private care . He had thought a great deal of Esther with a mixture of strong disapproval and strong liking , which both together made a feeling the reverse of indifference ; but he was not going to let her have any influence on his life . Even if his determination had not been fixed , he would have believed that she would utterly scorn him in any other light than that of an acquaintance , and the emotion she had shown to - day did not change that belief . But he was deeply touched by this manifestation of her better qualities , and felt that there was a new tie of friendship between them . That was the brief history Felix would have given of his relation to Esther . And he was accustomed to observe himself . But very close and diligent looking at living creatures , even through the best microscope , will leave room for new and contradictory discoveries . Felix found Mr Lyon particularly glad to talk to him . The minister had never yet disburthened himself about his letter to Mr Philip Debarry concerning the public confernce ; and as by this time he had all the heads of his discussion thoroughly in his mind , it was agreeable to recite them , as well as to express his regret that time had been lost by Mr Debarry 's absence from the Manor , which had prevented the immediate fulfilment of his pledge . "
104861	104876	104877	104878	The Rector	1088	" said Felix , thinking it well to moderate the little man 's confidence . "
104908	104913	104914	104916	My young friend	5300	" said Mr Lyon . "
104958	104959	104960	104960	I	0	" "
104991	105251	104960	104960	I	0	" — Henry IV . When Philip Debarry had come home that morning and read the letters which had not been forwarded to him , he laughed so heartily at Mr Lyon 's that he congratulated himself on being in his private room . Otherwise his laughter would have awakened the curiosity of Sir Maximus , and Philip did not wish to tell any one the contents of the letter until he had shown them to his uncle . He determined to ride over to the Rectory to lunch ; for as Lady Mary was away , he and his uncle might be tête - à - tête . The Rectory was on the other side of the river , close to the church of which it was the fitting companion : a fine old brick - and - stone house , with a great bow - window opening from the library on to the deep - turfed lawn , one fat dog sleeping on the door - stone , another fat dog waddling on the gravel , the autumn leaves duly swept away , the lingering chrysanthemums cherished , tall trees stooping or soaring in the most picturesque variety , and a Virginian creeper turning a little rustic hut into a scarlet pavilion . It was one of those rectories which are among the bulwarks of our venerable institutions — which arrest disintegrating doubt , serve as a double embankment against Popery and Dissent , and rally feminine instinct and affection to reinforce the decisions of masculine thought . "
105261	105274	105254	105254	you	2881	" said the Rector , as his nephew entered the pleasant library . "
105280	105289	105254	105254	you	2881	" said Philip , taking out the letter . "
105318	105319	105323	105323	you	2881	" "
105330	105360	105323	105323	you	2881	" said the Rector , keeping the letter in his hand and running over it again and again , with brow knit , but eyes gleaming without any malignity . "
105372	105373	105374	105374	Mine	0	" "
105376	105389	105390	105390	You	2881	" said the Rector , throwing down the letter on the table . "

105436	105476	105432	105432	he	2885	" said Philip . With all his gravity of nature he could not resist a slightly mischievous prompting , though he had a serious feeling that he should not like to be regarded as failing to fulfil his pledge . "

105769	105846	105734	105735	the instructed	2898	" The Rector had risen , placed himself with his back to the fire , and thrust his hands in his pockets , ready to insist further on this wide argument . Philip sat nursing one leg , listening respectfully , as he always did , though often listening to the sonorous echo of his own statements , which suited his uncle 's needs so exactly that he did not distinguish them from his old impressions . "
105849	105853	105734	105735	the instructed	2898	" said Philip , "

106306	106324	106288	106288	he	201	" said Philip , taking up Mr Lyon 's letter and looking graver — looking even vexed , "
106378	106379	106365	106365	I	0	" "
106393	106394	106365	106365	I	0	" "

106525	106537	106519	106519	I	0	" said the Rector , with a sudden revival of spirits . "
106650	106678	106646	106646	he	399	" Philip had not time to object before Mr Sherlock appeared — a young divine of good birth and figure , of sallow complexion and bashful address . "
106688	106693	106681	106681	you	175	" said the Rector . "
106775	106845	106846	106846	You	175	" Mr Sherlock smiled with rather a trembling lip , willing to distinguish himself , but hoping that the Rector only alluded to a dialogue on Baptism by Aspersion , or some other pamphlet suited to the purposes of the Christian Knowledge Society . But as the Rector proceeded to unfold the circumstances under which his eminent service was to be rendered , he grew more and more nervous . "
106855	106860	106846	106846	You	175	" the Rector ended , "
106888	106889	106890	106890	I	0	" "
106911	106912	106905	106905	I	0	" "
107026	107050	107021	107021	Thomas	376	" Philip sat down to write , and the Rector , with his firm ringing voice , went on at his ease , giving "
107052	107058	107021	107021	Thomas	376	" to his agitated curate . "
107239	107395	107396	107396	I	0	" With all Mr Sherlock 's timidity , there was fascination for him in this distinction . He reflected that he could take coffee and sit up late , and perhaps produce something rather fine . It might be a first step towards that eminence which it was no more than his duty to aspire to . Even a polemical fame like that of a Philpotts must have had a beginning . Mr Sherlock was not insensible to the pleasure of turning sentences successfully , and it was a pleasure not always unconnected with preferment . A diffident man likes the idea of doing something remarkable , which will create belief in him without any immediate display of brilliancy . Celebrity may blush and be silent , and win a grace the more . Thus Mr Sherlock was constrained , trembling all the while , and much wishing that his essay were already in print . "
107407	107408	107396	107396	I	0	" "
107437	107754	107756	107756	himself	2938	" The Rector was quite satisfied . He had talked himself into thinking that he should like to give Sherlock a few useful hints , look up his own earlier sermons , and benefit the Curate by his criticism , when the argument had been got into shape . He was a healthy - natured man , but that was not at all a reason why he should not have those sensibilities to the odour of authorship which belong to almost everybody who is not expected to be a writer — and especially to that form of authorship which is called suggestion , and consists in telling another man that he might do a great deal with a given subject , by bringing a sufficient amount of knowledge , reasoning , and wit to bear upon it . Philip would have had some twinges of conscience about the Curate , if he had not guessed that the honour thrust upon him was not altogether disagreeable . The Church might perhaps have had a stronger supporter ; but for himself , he had done what he was bound to do ; he had done his best towards fulfilling Mr Lyon 's desire . Midsummer Night 's Dream . Rufus Lyon was very happy on that mild November morning appointed for the great conference in the larger room at the Free School , between himself and the Rev. Theodore Sherlock , B.A. The disappointment of not contending with the Rector in person , which had at first been bitter , had been gradually lost sight of in the positive enjoyment of an opportunity for debating on any terms . Mr Lyon had two grand elements of pleasure on such occasions : confidence in the strength of his case , and confidence in his own power of advocacy . Not — to use his own phrase — not that he "
107759	107877	107756	107756	himself	2938	" for speech and exposition were so easy to him , that if he argued forcibly , he believed it to be simply because the truth was forcible . He was not proud of moving easily in his native medium . A panting man thinks of himself as a clever swimmer ; but a fish swims much better , and takes his performance as a matter of course . Whether Mr Sherlock were that panting , self - gratulating man , remained a secret . Philip Debarry , much occupied with his electioneering affairs , had only once had an opportunity of asking his uncle how Sherlock got on , and the Rector had said , curtly , "
107934	108346	107917	107917	Sherlock	399	" But on this particular morning peremptory business connected with the magistracy called the Rector away . Due notice had been given , and the feminine world of Treby Magna was much more agitated by the prospect than by that of any candidate 's speech . Mrs Pendrell at the Bank , Mrs Tiliot , and the Church ladies generally , felt bound to hear the Curate , who was known , apparently by an intuition concerning the nature of curates , to be a very clever young man ; and he would show them what learning had to say on the right side . One or two Dissenting ladies were not without emotion at the thought that , seated on the front benches , they should be brought near to old Church friends , and have a longer greeting than had taken place since the Catholic Emancipation . Mrs Muscat , who had been a beauty , and was as nice in her millinery as any Trebian lady belonging to the Establishment , reflected that she should put on her best large embroidered collar , and that she should ask Mrs Tiliot where it was in Duffield that she once got her bed - hangings dyed so beautifully . When Mrs Tiliot was Mary Salt , the two ladies had been bosom friends ; but Mr Tiliot had looked higher and higher since his gin had become so famous ; and in the year ' 29 he had , in Mr Muscat 's hearing , spoken of Dissenters as sneaks,—a personality which could not be overlooked . The debate was to begin at eleven , for the Rector would not allow the evening to be chosen , when low men and boys might want to be admitted out of mere mischief . This was one reason why the female part of the audience outnumbered the males . But some chief Trebians were there , even men whose means made them as independent of theory as Mr Pendrell and Mr Wace ; encouraged by reflecting that they were not in a place of worship , and would not be obliged to stay longer than they chose . There was a muster of all Dissenters who could spare the morning time , and on the back benches were all the aged Churchwomen who shared the remnants of the sacrament wine , and who were humbly anxious to neglect nothing ecclesiastical or connected with "
108353	108759	107917	107917	Sherlock	399	" At eleven the arrival of listeners seemed to have ceased . Mr Lyon was seated on the school tribune or daïs at his particular round table ; another round table , with a chair , awaited the Curate , with whose superior position it was quite in keeping that he should not be first on the ground . A couple of extra chairs were placed farther back , and more than one important personage had been requested to act as chairman ; but no Churchman would place himself in a position so equivocal as to dignity of aspect , and so unequivocal as to the obligation of sitting out the discussion ; and the Rector had beforehand put a veto on any Dissenting chairman . Mr Lyon sat patiently absorbed in his thoughts , with his notes in minute handwriting lying before him , seeming to look at the audience , but not seeing them . Every one else was contented that there should be an interval in which there could be a little neighbourly talk . Esther was particularly happy , seated on a sidebench near her father 's side of the tribune , with Felix close behind her , so that she could turn her head and talk to him . He had been very kind ever since that morning when she had called at his home , more disposed to listen indulgently to what she had to say , and less blind to her looks and movements . If he had never railed at her or ignored her , she would have been less sensitive to the attention he gave her ; but as it was , the prospect of seeing him seemed to light up her life , and to disperse the old dulness . She looked unusually charming to - day , from the very fact that she was not vividly conscious of anything but of having a mind near her that asked her to be something better than she actually was . The consciousness of her own superiority amongst the people around her was superseded , and even a few brief weeks had given a softened expression to her eyes , a more feminine beseechingness and self - doubt to her manners . Perhaps , however , a little new defiance was rising in place of the old contempt — defiance of the Trebian views concerning Felix Holt . "
108774	108800	108801	108802	the lady	2943	" said Mrs Tiliot in an undertone to Mrs Muscat , who , as she had hoped , had found a seat next to her quondam friend—"quite
108804	108805	108801	108802	the lady	2943	" "
108813	108818	108801	108802	the lady	2943	" said Mrs Muscat . "
108906	108946	108947	108947	Dear	2325	" Mrs Muscat lowered her blond eyelashes and swayed her neat head just perceptibly from side to side , with a sincere desire to be moderate in her expressions , notwithstanding any shock that facts might have given her . "

109133	109166	109119	109119	I	0	" Mr Wace and Mr Pendrell meanwhile were standing up and looking round at the audience , nodding to their fellow - townspeople with the affability due from men in their position . "
109174	109191	109170	109170	he	2946	" said Mr Wace , looking at his watch and comparing it with the schoolroom clock . "
109283	109284	109271	109271	He	399	" "
109304	109309	109310	109310	You	2966	" said Mr Pendrell . "

109350	109372	109344	109344	he	2946	" said Mr Wace , turning round on hearing a movement near the small door on a level with the platform . "
109388	109524	109527	109527	my	0	" Mr Wace and Mr Pendrell clapped their hands , and the example was followed even by most of the Dissenters . Philip was aware that he was doing a popular thing , of a kind that Treby was not used to from the elder Debarrys ; but his appearance had not been long premeditated . He was driving through the town towards an engagement at some distance , but on calling at Labron 's office he had found that the affair which demanded his presence had been deferred , and so had driven round to the Free School . Christian came in behind him . Mr Lyon was now roused from his abstraction , and , stepping from his slight elevation , begged Mr Debarry to act as moderator or president on the occasion . "
109530	109534	109527	109527	my	0	" said Philip . "
109544	109545	109546	109546	He	399	" "
109551	109556	109546	109546	He	399	" said Mr Lyon . "
109586	109587	109570	109570	I	0	" "
109594	109609	109570	109570	I	0	" said Mr Wace , who saw a limit to his powers of endurance . "
109623	109624	109610	109611	Mr Sherlock	399	" "
109627	109638	109610	109611	Mr Sherlock	399	" said Philip Debarry , who felt a slight misgiving , "
109695	109764	109686	109686	You	327	" As Mr Debarry went out , Rufus Lyon stepped on to the tribune again in rather an uneasy state of mind . A few ideas had occurred to him , eminently fitted to engage the audience profitably , and so to wrest some edification out of an unforeseen delay . But his native delicacy made him feel that in this assembly the Church people might fairly decline any "
109766	109924	109925	109925	Your	2974	" on his part which exceeded the programme , and Mr Wace 's negative had been energetic . But the little man suffered from imprisoned ideas , and was as restless as a racer held in . He could not sit down again , but walked backwards and forwards , stroking his chin , emitting his low guttural interjection under the pressure of clauses and sentences which he longed to utter aloud , as he would have done in his own study . There was a low buzz in the room which helped to deepen the minister 's sense that the thoughts within him were as divine messengers unheeded or rejected by a trivial generation . Many of the audience were standing ; all , except the old Churchwomen on the back seats , and a few devout Dissenters who kept their eyes shut and gave their bodies a gentle oscillating motion , were interested in chat . "
109930	109936	109925	109925	Your	2974	" said Felix to Esther . "
109988	109989	109990	109990	I	0	" "
110001	110034	109990	109990	I	0	" said Felix , striding over the form in front of him , and approaching Mr Lyon , whose face showed a gleam of pleasure at this relief from his abstracted isolation . "
110051	110055	110056	110056	My	0	" said Felix . "
110061	110089	110056	110056	My	0	" said Mr Lyon , laying his hand on Felix Holt 's fore - arm , which was about on a level with the minister 's shoulder , "
110283	110386	110468	110469	not Dissenters	2986	" Esther was watching her father and Felix , and though she was not within hearing of what was being said , she guessed the actual state of the case — that the inquiry about the spectacles had been unheeded , and that her father was losing himself and embarrassing Felix in the intricacies of a dissertation . There was not the stillness around her that would have made a movement on her part seem conspicuous , and she was impelled by her anxiety to step on the tribune and walk up to her father , who paused , a little startled . "
110412	110431	110401	110401	I	0	" Mr Lyon was automatically obedient to Esther , and he began immediately to feel in his pockets . "
110446	110463	110436	110437	Miss Jermyn	237	" said Christian to Quorlen , the Tory printer , who was an intimate of his . "

110513	110529	110530	110533	the rusty old ranter	2991	" Christian gave a low brief whistle , which seemed a natural expression of surprise that "
110534	110554	110530	110533	the rusty old ranter	2991	" should have a daughter of such distinguished appearance . Meanwhile the search for the spectacles had proved vain . "
110565	110573	110560	110560	me	0	" said the little man , humbly ; "

110590	110667	110584	110584	I	0	" said Esther , refusing to let Felix go instead of her . But she had scarcely stepped off the tribune when Mr Debarry re - entered , and there was a commotion which made her wait . After a low - toned conversation with Mr Pendrell and Mr Wace , Philip Debarry stepped on to the tribune with his hat in his hand , and said , with an air of much concern and annoyance , "
110816	110825	110813	110814	Mr Lyon	201	" continued Philip , turning to the minister , "
110835	110836	110826	110826	I	0	" "
110842	110885	110826	110826	I	0	" began Mr Lyon ; but his further speech was drowned by a general rising of the Church people from their seats , many of them feeling that , even if the cause were lamentable , the adjournment was not altogether disagreeable . "
110890	110903	110904	110904	I	0	" said Mrs Tiliot , as she took her husband 's arm , "
110921	110967	110968	110968	He	2997	" But some of the more acrid Dissenters , whose temper was not controlled by the habits of retail business , had begun to hiss , implying that in their interpretation the Curate 's absence had not depended on any injury to life or limb . "
110976	111045	110968	110968	He	2997	" said Mr Muscat to the neighbour behind him , lifting his eyebrows and shoulders , and laughing in a way that showed that , deacon as he was , he looked at the affair in an entirely secular light . But Mrs Muscat thought it would be nothing but right to have all the waters dragged , agreeing in this with the majority of the Church ladies . "
111053	111064	111050	111051	Mr Lyon	201	" said Philip Debarry , addressing the minister with politeness , "
111096	111097	111079	111079	I	0	" "
111110	111121	111108	111108	sir	5093	" said Mr Lyon , in a tone of depression . "
111176	111424	111174	111174	sir	5093	" When the room was cleared of the Church people , Mr Lyon wished to soothe his own spirit and that of his flock by a few reflections introductory to a parting prayer . But there was a general resistance to this effort . The men mustered round the minister , and declared their opinion that the whole thing was disgraceful to the Church . Some said the Curate 's absence had been contrived from the first . Others more than hinted that it had been a folly in Mr Lyon to set on foot any procedure in common with Tories and Clergymen , who , if they ever aped civility to Dissenters , would never do anything but laugh at them in their sleeves . Brother Kemp urged in his heavy bass that Mr Lyon should lose no time in sending an account of the affair to the ' Patriot ; ' and Brother Hawkins , in his high tenor , observed that it was an occasion on which some stinging things might be said with all the extra effect of an apropos . The position of receiving a many - voiced lecture from the members of his church was familiar to Mr Lyon ; but now he felt weary , frustrated , and doubtful of his own temper . Felix , who stood by and saw that this man of sensitive fibre was suffering from talkers whose noisy superficiality cost them nothing , got exasperated . "
111432	111442	111174	111174	sir	5093	" he burst in , with his predominant voice , "
111540	111618	111522	111523	Mr Lyon	201	" By this speech Felix raised a displeasure which fell on the minister as well as on himself ; but he gained his immediate end . The talkers dropped off after a slight show of persistence , and Mr Lyon quitted the field of no combat with a small group of his less imperious friends , to whom he confided his intention of committing his argument fully to paper , and forwarding it to a discriminating editor . "
111623	111627	111628	111628	I	0	" he added , "
111728	111890	111713	111726	a young and weak - kneed substitute to take his place in the fight	3014	" Mr Philip Debarry did not neglect to make industrious inquiry concerning the accidents which had detained the Rev. Theodore Sherlock on his morning walk . That well - intentioned young divine was seen no more in Treby Magna . But the river was not dragged , for by the evening coach the Rector received an explanatory letter . The Rev. Theodore 's agitation had increased so much during his walk , that the passing coach had been a means of deliverance not to be resisted ; and , literally at the eleventh hour , he had hailed and mounted the cheerful Tally - ho ! and carried away his portion of the debate in his pocket . But the Rector had subsequently the satisfaction of receiving Mr Sherlock 's painstaking production in print , with a dedication to the Rev. Augustus Debarry , a motto from St Chrysostom , and other additions , the fruit of ripening leisure . He was "
111900	112615	111894	111894	Sherlock	399	" but he was convinced that for his own part he had taken the course which under the circumstances was the least compromising to the Church . Sir Maximus , however , observed to his son and brother that he had been right and they had been wrong as to the danger of vague , enormous expressions of gratitude to a Dissenting preacher , and on any differences of opinion seldom failed to remind them of that precedent . When Christian quitted the Free School with the discovery that the young lady whose appearance had first startled him with an indefinable impression in the market - place was the daughter of the old Dissenting preacher who had shown so much agitated curiosity about his name , he felt very much like an uninitiated chess - player who sees that the pieces are in a peculiar position on the board , and might open the way for him to give checkmate , if he only knew how . Ever since his interview with Jermyn , his mind had been occupied with the charade it offered to his ingenuity . What was the real meaning of the lawyer 's interest in him , and in his relations with Maurice Christian Bycliffe ? Here was a secret ; and secrets were often a source of profit , of that agreeable kind which involved little labour . Jermyn had hinted at profit which might possibly come through him ; but Christian said inwardly , with well - satisfied self - esteem , that he was not so pitiable a nincompoop as to trust Jermyn . On the contrary , the only problem before him was to find out by what combination of independent knowledge he could outwit Jermyn , elude any purchase the attorney had on him through his past history , and get a handsome bonus , by which a somewhat shattered man of pleasure might live well without a master . Christian , having early exhausted the more impulsive delights of life , had become a sober calculator ; and he had made up his mind that , for a man who had long ago run through his own money , servitude in a great family was the best kind of retirement after that of a pensioner ; but if a better chance offered , a person of talent must not let it slip through his fingers . He held various ends of threads , but there was danger in pulling at them too impatiently . He had not forgotten the surprise which had made him drop the punch - ladle , when Mr Crowder , talking in the steward 's room , had said that a scamp named Henry Scaddon had been concerned in a lawsuit about the Transome estate . Again , Jermyn was the family lawyer of the Transomes ; he knew about the exchange of names between Scaddon and Bycliffe ; he clearly wanted to know as much as he could about Bycliffe 's history . The conclusion was not remote that Bycliffe had had some claim on the Transome property , and that a difficulty had arisen from his being confounded with Henry Scaddon . But hitherto the other incident which had been apparently connected with the interchange of names — Mr Lyon 's demand that he should write down the name Maurice Christian , accompanied with the question whether that were his whole name — had had no visible link with the inferences arrived at through Crowder and Jermyn . The discovery made this morning at the Free School that Esther was the daughter of the Dissenting preacher at last suggested a possible link . Until then , Christian had not known why Esther 's face had impressed him so peculiarly ; but the minister 's chief association for him was with Bycliffe , and that association served as a flash to show him that Esther 's features and expression , and still more her bearing , now she stood and walked , revived Bycliffe 's image . Daughter ? There were various ways of being a daughter . Suppose this were a case of adoption : suppose Bycliffe were known to be dead , or thought to be dead . "
112646	112652	112653	112653	I	0	" Christian said to himself ; "
112728	112985	112722	112723	a woman	4915	" Christian could see no distinct result for himself from his industry ; but if there were to be any such result , it must be reached by following out every clue ; and to the non - legal mind there are dim possibilities in law and heirship which prevent any issue from seeming too miraculous . The consequence of these meditations was , that Christian hung about Treby more than usual in his leisure time , and that on the first opportunity he accosted Mr Lyon in the street with suitable civility , stating that since the occasion which had brought them together some weeks before he had often wished to renew their conversation , and , with Mr Lyon 's permission , would now ask to do so . After being assured , as he had been by Jermyn , that this courier , who had happened by some accident to possess the memorable locket and pocket - book , was certainly not Annette 's husband , and was ignorant whether Maurice Christian Bycliffe were living or dead , the minister 's mind had become easy again ; his habitual lack of interest in personal details rendering him gradually oblivious of Jermyn 's precautionary statement that he was pursuing inquiries , and that if anything of interest turned up , Mr Lyon should be made acquainted with it . Hence , when Christian addressed him , the minister , taken by surprise and shaken by the recollections of former anxieties , said , helplessly , "
113005	113041	113000	113000	yourself	5093	" He could not have said anything that was a more valuable hint to Christian . He inferred that the minister had made a confidant of Jermyn , and it was needful to be wary . "
113048	113052	113000	113000	yourself	5093	" he answered , "
113075	113337	113072	113073	Mr Jermyn	169	" Mr Lyon was perplexed , and felt at once that he was no more in clear daylight concerning Jermyn than concerning Christian . He dared not neglect the possible duty of hearing what this man had to say , and he invited him to proceed to Malthouse Yard , where they could converse in private . Once in Mr Lyon 's study , Christian opened the dialogue by saying that since he was in this room before it had occurred to him that the anxiety he had observed in Mr Lyon might be owing to some acquaintance with Maurice Christian Bycliffe — a fellow - prisoner in France whom he , Christian , had assisted in getting freed from his imprisonment , and who , in fact , had been the owner of the trifles which Mr Lyon had recently had in his possession and had restored . Christian hastened to say that he knew nothing of Bycliffe 's history since they had parted in France , but that he knew of his marriage with Annette Ledru , and had been acquainted with Annette herself . He would be very glad to know what became of Bycliffe , if he could , for he liked him uncommonly . Here Christian paused ; but Mr Lyon only sat changing colour and trembling . This man 's bearing and tone of mind were made repulsive to him by being brought in contact with keenly - felt memories , and he could not readily summon the courage to give answers or ask questions . "
113348	113358	113346	113346	Bycliffe	327	" said Christian , trying a more direct method . "
113368	113369	113366	113366	him	327	" "
113414	113415	113408	113408	she	235	" "
113418	113440	113408	113408	she	235	" said Mr Lyon , in his deepest tone , half rising , and holding by the arms of his chair , "
113481	113482	113485	113485	sir	5093	" "
113516	113524	113514	113514	Bycliffe	327	" Mr Lyon moved his lips silently . "
113550	113551	113552	113552	Sir	5093	" "
113554	113565	113552	113552	Sir	5093	" said Mr Lyon , shaken out of all reticence , "
113626	113627	113609	113609	himself	3041	" "
113633	113637	113609	113609	himself	3041	" said Christian . "
113652	113716	113645	113646	Miss Lyon	235	" The minister shivered as if the edge of a knife had been drawn across his hand . But the tone of this question , by the very fact that it intensified his antipathy to Christian , enabled him to collect himself for what must be simply the endurance of a painful operation . After a moment or two he said more coolly , "
113739	113740	113741	113741	I	0	" "
113859	113860	113861	113861	I	0	" "

114074	114083	114069	114069	I	0	" said Mr Lyon , with cold gravity . "
114086	114106	114107	114107	I	0	" he added , with an acumen as to possibilities rather disturbing to Christian 's confident contempt for the old man—"unless
114143	114254	114255	114255	I	0	" Christian departed , feeling satisfied that he had got the utmost to be obtained at present out of the Dissenting preacher , whom he had not dared to question more closely . He must look out for chance lights , and perhaps , too , he might catch a stray hint by stirring the sediment of Mr Crowder 's memory . But he must not venture on inquiries that might be noticed . He was in awe of Jermyn . When Mr Lyon was alone he paced up and down among his books , and thought aloud , in order to relieve himself after the constraint of this interview . "
114265	114273	114274	114274	I	0	" he said , more than once . "

The next morning , after much prayer for the needful strength and wisdom , Mr Lyon came down - stairs with the resolution that another day should not pass without the fulfilment of the task he had laid on himself ; but what hour he should choose for his solemn disclosure to Esther , must depend on their mutual occupations . Perhaps he must defer it till they sat up alone together , after Lyddy was gone to bed . But at breakfast Esther said , "
114474	114475	114441	114441	Lyddy	206	" "
114497	114501	114494	114495	Miss Esther	208	" said Lyddy . "

114568	114575	114566	114566	Lyddy	206	" said Mr Lyon , wearily ; "

114595	114599	114600	114600	I	0	" persisted Esther . "
114605	114620	114600	114600	I	0	" Mr Lyon felt as if this were a fresh summons not to delay . "
114655	115039	114641	114641	I	0	" Esther wondered what there could be on her father 's mind more pressing than his morning studies . She soon knew . Motionless , but mentally stirred as she had never been before , Esther listened to her mother 's story , and to the outpouring of her stepfather 's long - pent - up experience . The rays of the morning sun which fell athwart the books , the sense of the beginning day , had deepened the solemnity more than night would have done . All knowledge which alters our lives penetrates us more when it comes in the early morning : the day that has to be travelled with something new and perhaps for ever sad in its light , is an image of the life that spreads beyond . But at night the time of rest is near . Mr Lyon regarded his narrative as a confession — as a revelation to this beloved child of his own miserable weakness and error . But to her it seemed a revelation of another sort : her mind seemed suddenly enlarged by a vision of passion and struggle , of delight and renunciation , in the lot of beings who had hitherto been a dull enigma to her . And in the act of unfolding to her that he was not her real father , but had only striven to cherish her as a father , had only longed to be loved as a father , the odd , wayworn , unworldly man became the object of a new sympathy in which Esther felt herself exalted . Perhaps this knowledge would have been less powerful within her , but for the mental preparation that had come during the last two months from her acquaintance with Felix Holt , which had taught her to doubt the infallibility of her own standard , and raised a presentiment of moral depths that were hidden from her . Esther had taken her place opposite to her father , and had not moved even her clasped hands while he was speaking . But after the long outpouring in which he seemed to lose the sense of everything but the memories he was giving utterance to , he paused a little while and then said timidly , "
115076	115140	115074	115074	you	208	" Esther had risen , and had glided on to the wooden stool on a level with her father 's chair , where he was accustomed to lay books . She wanted to speak , but the floodgates could not be opened for words alone . She threw her arms round the old man 's neck and sobbed out with a passionate cry , "
115161	115217	115158	115158	I	0	" The old man 's little delicate frame was shaken by a surprise and joy that were almost painful in their intensity . He had been going to ask forgiveness of her who asked it for herself . In that moment of supreme complex emotion one ray of the minister 's joy was the thought , "
115239	115293	115234	115237	the Lord hath touched	3082	" They sat so , enclasped in silence , while Esther relieved her full heart . When she raised her head , she sat quite still for a minute or two looking fixedly before her , and keeping one little hand in the minister 's . Presently she looked at him and said , "
115330	115331	115325	115325	she	5308	" "
115350	115458	115345	115345	I	0	" Mr Lyon answered in utter dimness as to the course Esther 's mind was taking . He had anticipated before his disclosure , from his long - standing discernment of tendencies in her which were often the cause of silent grief to him , that the discovery likely to have the keenest interest for her would be that her parents had a higher rank than that of the poor Dissenting preacher ; but she had shown that other and better sensibilities were predominant . He rebuked himself now for a hasty and shallow judgment concerning the child 's inner life , and waited for new clearness . "
115469	115504	115345	115345	I	0	" said Esther , suddenly rising , with a flush across her paleness , and standing with her head thrown a little backward , as if some illumination had given her a new decision . "
115512	115513	115345	115345	I	0	" "
115521	115522	115345	115345	I	0	" "

115574	115612	115613	115613	Mamma	252	" Esther did not speak ; her father 's words did not fit on to the impressions wrought in her by what he had told her . She sat down again , and said , more quietly , "
115624	115625	115613	115613	Mamma	252	" "
115690	115704	115685	115685	she	252	" Mr Lyon reached and delivered to Esther the box containing the relics . "
115749	115823	115824	115824	I	0	" He then narrated to Esther all that had passed between himself and Christian . The possibility — to which Mr Lyon 's alarms had pointed — that her real father might still be living , was a new shock . She could not speak about it to her present father , but it was registered in silence as a painful addition to the uncertainties which she suddenly saw hanging over her life . "
115834	115839	115824	115824	I	0	" Mr Lyon ended . "
115927	115928	115932	115932	father	5432	" "
115934	116248	115932	115932	father	5432	" said Esther , eagerly . A little while ago , these problematic prospects might have set her dreaming pleasantly ; but now , for some reasons that she could not have put distinctly into words , they affected her with dread . Shakspeare : Sonnets . Coriolanus . In the afternoon Mr Lyon went out to see the sick amongst his flock , and Esther , who had been passing the morning in dwelling on the memories and the few remaining relics of her parents , was left alone in the parlour amidst the lingering odours of the early dinner , not easily got rid of in that small house . Rich people , who know nothing of these vulgar details , can hardly imagine their significance in the history of multitudes of human lives in which the sensibilities are never adjusted to the external conditions . Esther always felt so much discomfort from those odours that she usually seized any possibility of escaping from them , and to - day they oppressed her the more because she was weary with long - continued agitation . Why did she not put on her bonnet as usual and get out into the open air ? It was one of those pleasant November afternoons — pleasant in the wide country — when the sunshine is on the clinging brown leaves of the young oaks , and the last yellow leaves of the elms flutter down in the fresh but not eager breeze . But Esther sat still on the sofa — pale and with reddened eyelids , her curls all pushed back carelessly , and her elbow resting on the ridgy black horsehair , which usually almost set her teeth on edge if she pressed it even through her sleeve — while her eyes rested blankly on the dull street . Lyddy had said , "
116268	116411	115932	115932	father	5432	" She had never seen the curls in such disorder , and she reflected that there had been a death from typhus recently . But the obstinate Miss only shook her head . Esther was waiting for the sake of — not a probability , but — a mere possibility , which made the brothy odours endurable . Apparently , in less than half an hour , the possibility came to pass , for she changed her attitude , almost started from her seat , sat down again , and listened eagerly . If Lyddy should send him away , could she herself rush out and call him back ? Why not ? Such things were permissible where it was understood , from the necessity of the case , that there was only friendship . But Lyddy opened the door and said , "
116439	116440	116432	116432	I	0	" "
116452	116453	116432	116432	I	0	" "
116460	116469	116432	116432	I	0	" said Felix , as they shook hands , "
116484	116501	116479	116479	you	3071	" he went on , as he seated himself at the other end of the sofa . "
116536	116561	116527	116527	you	3071	" He spoke very kindly , and looked at her more persistently than he had ever done before , when her hair was perfect . "
116618	116619	116608	116608	She	5308	" "
116644	116656	116657	116657	I	0	" Esther passed her hand over her brow before she answered . "
116690	116708	116685	116686	my father	4851	" As she said this , she looked at Felix , and their eyes met very gravely . "
116716	116720	116685	116686	my father	4851	" he said , "
116746	116747	116744	116744	you	0	" "
116755	116967	116748	116748	I	0	" said Esther , unhesitatingly , though they had never walked out together before . It is true that to get into the fields they had to pass through the street ; and when Esther saw some acquaintances , she reflected that her walking alone with Felix might be a subject of remark — all the more because of his cap , patched boots , no cravat , and thick stick . Esther was a little amazed herself at what she had come to . So our lives glide on : the river ends we do n't know where , and the sea begins , and then there is no more jumping ashore . When they were in the streets Esther hardly spoke . Felix talked with his usual readiness , as easily as if he were not doing it solely to divert her thoughts , first about Job Tudge 's delicate chest , and the probability that the little white - faced monkey would not live long ; and then about a miserable beginning of a night - school , which was all he could get together at Sproxton ; and the dismalness of that hamlet , which was a sort of lip to the coalpit on one side and the "
116969	117049	116748	116748	I	0	" on the other — and yet a paradise compared with the wynds of Glasgow , where there was little more than a chink of daylight to show the hatred in women 's faces . But soon they got into the fields , where there was a right of way towards Little Treby , now following the course of the river , now crossing towards a lane , and now turning into a cart - track through a plantation . "
117054	117079	116748	116748	I	0	" said Felix , when they had crossed the wooden bridge , and were treading on the slanting shadows made by the elm trunks . "

117110	117124	117125	117125	I	0	" said Esther , smiling at him with some of her habitual sauciness , "

117558	117570	117550	117550	you	0	" said Esther , rather frightened as she asked the question . "

117592	117600	117575	117575	you	0	" said Felix , with curt decision . "
117638	117645	117668	117668	you	0	" added Felix , striding over . "
117659	117660	117647	117647	I	0	" "

117794	117800	117784	117784	you	0	" said Felix , bluntly . "
117930	117989	117898	117898	I	0	" Esther did not speak , and there was silence between them for a minute or two , till they passed through a gate into a plantation where there was no large timber , but only thin - stemmed trees and underwood , so that the sunlight fell on the mossy spaces which lay open here and there . "
118005	118009	117898	117898	I	0	" said Felix . "
118032	118033	118025	118025	we	3136	" "
118053	118096	118097	118097	I	0	" Esther sat down and took off her bonnet , that the light breeze might fall on her head . Felix , too , threw down his cap and stick , lying on the ground with his back against the felled trunk . "
118106	118127	118097	118097	I	0	" she said , looking at the point of her foot , which was playing with a tuft of moss . "
118150	118151	118141	118141	you	3137	" "
118157	118161	118152	118152	You	3137	" said Felix . "
118427	118455	118482	118483	the miserable	3148	" Esther felt a terrible pressure on her heart — the certainty of her remoteness from Felix — the sense that she was utterly trivial to him . "
118469	118477	118482	118483	the miserable	3148	" said Felix , after a pause , "
118549	118550	118555	118555	you	0	" "
118563	118564	118555	118555	you	0	" "
118615	118820	118821	118821	You	3157	" Again there was silence . Esther 's cheeks were hot in spite of the breeze that sent her hair floating backward . She felt an inward strain , a demand on her to see things in a light that was not easy or soothing . When Felix had asked her to walk , he had seemed so kind , so alive to what might be her feelings , that she had thought herself nearer to him than she had ever been before ; but since they had come out , he had appeared to forget all that . And yet she was conscious that this impatience of hers was very petty . Battling in this way with her own little impulses , and looking at the birch - stems opposite till her gaze was too wide for her to see anything distinctly , she was unaware how long they had remained without speaking . She did not know that Felix had changed his attitude a little , and was resting his elbow on the tree - trunk , while he supported his head , which was turned towards her . Suddenly he said , in a lower tone than was habitual to him , "
118826	118914	118821	118821	You	3157	" She started and looked round at him , to see whether his face would give some help to the interpretation of this novel speech . He was looking up at her quite calmly , very much as a reverential Protestant might look at a picture of the Virgin , with a devoutness suggested by the type rather than by the image . Esther 's vanity was not in the least gratified : she felt that , somehow or other , Felix was going to reproach her . "
118918	118928	118915	118915	I	0	" he went on , still looking at her , "
118981	119013	119096	119096	I	0	" Esther 's eyes got hot and smarting . It was no use trying to be dignified . She had turned away her head , and now said , rather bitterly , "
119045	119046	119096	119096	I	0	" "
119050	119090	119091	119091	You	3161	Esther"—it was the first time Felix had been prompted to call her by her Christian name , and as he did so he laid his large hand on her two little hands , which were clasped on her knees . "
119107	119108	119102	119102	I	0	" "
119115	119128	119112	119112	I	0	" said Esther , interrupting him impetuously , but still looking away . "
119208	119209	119201	119201	I	0	" "
119224	119230	119211	119211	I	0	" said Felix , gently . "
119236	119249	119233	119233	you	0	" said Esther , turning and smiling at him through her tears . "
119274	119275	119268	119268	you	0	" "
119282	119331	119268	119268	you	0	" said Felix , curtly , taking away his hand and clasping it with the other at the back of his head . The talk , which seemed to be introducing a mutual understanding , such as had not existed before , seemed to have undergone some check . "
119341	119350	119405	119405	their	639	" said Esther , after a few moments . "
119353	119359	119405	119405	their	639	" said Felix , entreatingly . "
119377	119378	119365	119365	I	0	" "
119382	119383	119365	119365	I	0	" "

119430	119453	119423	119423	I	0	" said Esther , smiling at him , with an effort at playfulness , in resistance to something vaguely mournful within her . "
119460	119470	119457	119457	I	0	" said Felix , looking at her very earnestly . "
119634	119635	119628	119628	they	3171	" "
119648	119662	119638	119638	you	0	" said Esther , turning away her eyes in spite of his command . "

119694	119702	119714	119719	a demagogue of a new sort	3174	" said Felix , in his more usual tone,—"some

119846	119882	119910	119910	you	0	" said Esther ( she had rapidly woven some possibilities out of the new uncertainties in her own lot , though she would not for the world have had Felix know of her weaving ) . "
119918	119919	119910	119910	you	0	" "
119922	119928	119910	119910	you	0	" said Felix , peremptorily ; "
120103	120113	120093	120093	I	0	" Esther looked before her dreamily till she said , "
120127	120134	120093	120093	I	0	" She rose to walk back . "
120145	120167	120142	120143	a fool	4978	" said Felix , loudly , starting to his feet , and then stooping to gather up his cap and stick . "
120177	120178	120170	120170	you	3194	" "
120210	120211	120202	120202	they	656	" "
120246	120247	120231	120231	She	4915	" "
120261	120276	120279	120279	I	0	" said Felix , looking at her with a sudden question in his eyes . "
120282	120340	120279	120279	I	0	" she said , flushing over neck and brow . Their words were charged with a meaning dependent entirely on the secret consciousness of each . Nothing had been said which was necessarily personal . They walked a few yards along the road by which they had come , without further speech , till Felix said gently , "
120345	120445	120279	120279	I	0	" She took it , and they walked home so , entirely without conversation . Felix was struggling as a firm man struggles with a temptation , seeing beyond it and disbelieving its lying promise . Esther was struggling as a woman struggles with the yearning for some expression of love , and with vexation under that subjection to a yearning which is not likely to be satisfied . Each was conscious of a silence which each was unable to break , till they entered Malthouse Lane , and were within a few yards of the minister 's door . "
120451	120456	120279	120279	I	0	" Felix then said ; "
120465	120466	120458	120459	Mr Lyon	201	" "
120492	120592	120486	120486	you	0	" said Esther , with her light laugh . Felix went in with Esther to take tea , but the conversation was entirely between him and Mr Lyon about the tricks of canvassing , the foolish personality of the placards , and the probabilities of Transome 's return , as to which Felix declared himself to have become indifferent . This scepticism made the minister uneasy : he had great belief in the old political watchwords , had preached that universal suffrage and no ballot were agreeable to the will of God , and liked to believe that a visible "
120594	120652	120486	120486	you	0	" was forthcoming in the Radical Candidate who had pronounced emphatically against Whig finality . Felix , being in a perverse mood , contended that universal suffrage would be equally agreeable to the devil ; that he would change his politics a little , have a larger traffic , and see himself more fully represented in Parliament . "
120658	120663	120664	120664	you	5265	" said the minister , "
120708	120709	120710	120711	A Radical	4863	" "

120834	120835	120831	120832	Mr Lyon	201	" "
120900	121428	120888	120888	I	0	" Esther sat by in unusual silence . The conviction that Felix willed her exclusion from his life was making it plain that something more than friendship between them was not so thoroughly out of the question as she had always inwardly asserted . In her pain that his choice lay aloof from her , she was compelled frankly to admit to herself the longing that it had been otherwise , and that he had entreated her to share his difficult life . He was like no one else to her : he had seemed to bring at once a law , and the love that gave strength to obey the law . Yet the next moment , stung by his independence of her , she denied that she loved him ; she had only longed for a moral support under the negations of her life . If she were not to have that support , all effort seemed useless . Esther had been so long used to hear the formulas of her father 's belief without feeling or understanding them , that they had lost all power to touch her . The first religious experience of her life — the first self - questioning , the first voluntary subjection , the first longing to acquire the strength of greater motives and obey the more strenuous rule — had come to her through Felix Holt . No wonder that she felt as if the loss of him were inevitable backsliding . But was it certain that she should lose him ? She did not believe that he was really indifferent to her . Titus Andronicus . The multiplication of uncomplimentary placards noticed by Mr Lyon and Felix Holt was one of several signs that the days of nomination and election were approaching . The presence of the Revising Barrister in Treby was not only an opportunity for all persons not otherwise busy to show their zeal for the purification of the voting - lists , but also to reconcile private ease and public duty by standing about the streets and lounging at doors . It was no light business for Trebians to form an opinion ; the mere fact of a public functionary with an unfamiliar title was enough to give them pause , as a premiss that was not to be quickly started from . To Mr Pink the saddler , for example , until some distinct injury or benefit had accrued to him , the existence of the Revising - Barrister was like the existence of the young giraffe which Wombwell had lately brought into those parts — it was to be contemplated , and not criticised . Mr Pink professed a deep - dyed Toryism ; but he regarded all fault - finding as Radical and somewhat impious , as disturbing to trade , and likely to offend the gentry or the servants through whom their harness was ordered : there was a Nemesis in things which made objection unsafe , and even the Reform Bill was a sort of electric eel which a thriving tradesman had better leave alone . It was only the "
121430	121770	121771	121772	Mr Christian	264	" who lived far enough off to be spoken of uncivilly . But Mr Pink was fond of news , which he collected and retailed with perfect impartiality , noting facts and rejecting comments . Hence he was well pleased to have his shop so constant a place of resort for loungers , that to many Trebians there was a strong association between the pleasures of gossip and the smell of leather . He had the satisfaction of chalking and cutting , and of keeping his journeymen close at work , at the very time that he learned from his visitors who were those whose votes had been called in question before His Honour , how Lawyer Jermyn had been too much for Lawyer Labron about Todd 's cottages , and how , in the opinion of some townsmen , this looking into the value of people 's property , and swearing it down below a certain sum , was a nasty , inquisitorial kind of thing ; while others observed that being nice to a few pounds was all nonsense — they should put the figure high enough , and then never mind if a voter 's qualification was thereabouts . But , said Mr Sims the auctioneer , everything was done for the sake of the lawyers . Mr Pink suggested impartially that lawyers must live ; but Mr Sims having a ready auctioneering wit , did not see that so many of them need live , or that babies were born lawyers . Mr Pink felt that this speculation was complicated by the ordering of side - saddles for lawyers ' daughters , and , returning to the firm ground of fact , stated that it was getting dusk . The dusk seemed deepened the next moment by a tall figure obstructing the doorway , at sight of whom Mr Pink rubbed his hands and smiled and bowed more than once , with evident solicitude to show honour where honour was due , while he said , "
121783	121794	121778	121778	you	264	" Christian answered with the condescending familiarity of a superior . "

121860	121882	121885	121885	sir	5093	" said Christian , half seating himself on a high stool , and beating his boot with a hand - whip . "
121896	121906	121885	121885	sir	5093	" said Mr Pink , with a knowing smile . "

122386	122523	122380	122380	Pink	425	" Christian went straight from the saddler 's to Quorlen 's , the Tory printer 's , with whom he had contrived a political spree . Quorlen was a new man in Treby , who had so reduced the trade of Dow , the old hereditary printer , that Dow had lapsed to Whiggery and Radicalism and opinions in general , so far as they were contented to express themselves in a small stock of types . Quorlen had brought his Duffield wit with him , and insisted that religion and joking were the handmaids of politics ; on which principle he and Christian undertook the joking , and left the religion to the Rector . The joke at present in question was a practical one . Christian , turning into the shop , merely said , "
122535	122563	122524	122524	I	0	" and , tucking a thickish flat bundle , wrapped in a black glazed cotton bag , under his arm , walked out into the dusk again . "
122567	122576	122380	122380	Pink	425	" he said to himself , as he strode along—"suppose
122693	122704	123308	123310	a pol'tical charicter	3239	" The Cross - Keys was a very old - fashioned "
122707	122993	123308	123310	a pol'tical charicter	3239	" its bar was a big rambling kitchen , with an undulating brick floor ; the small - paned windows threw an interesting obscurity over the far - off dresser , garnished with pewter and tin , and with large dishes that seemed to speak of better times ; the two settles were half pushed under the wide - mouthed chimney ; and the grate , with its brick hobs , massive iron crane , and various pothooks , suggested a generous plenty possibly existent in all moods and tenses except the indicative present . One way of getting an idea of our fellow - countrymen 's miseries is to go and look at their pleasures . The Cross - Keys had a fungous - featured landlord and a yellow sickly landlady , with a napkin bound round her head like a resuscitated Lazarus ; it had doctored ale , an odour of bad tobacco , and remarkably strong cheese . It was not what Astræa , when come back , might be expected to approve as the scene of ecstatic enjoyment for the beings whose special prerogative it is to lift their sublime faces towards heaven . Still , there was ample space on the hearth — accommodation for narrative bagmen or boxmen — room for a man to stretch his legs ; his brain was not pressed upon by a white wall within a yard of him , and the light did not stare in mercilessly on bare ugliness , turning the fire to ashes . Compared with some beerhouses of this more advanced period , the Cross - Keys of that day presented a high standard of pleasure . But though this venerable "
122995	123221	123222	123222	You	3237	" had not failed to share in the recent political excitement of drinking , the pleasures it offered were not at this early hour of the evening sought by a numerous company . There were only three or four pipes being smoked by the firelight , but it was enough for Christian when he found that one of these was being smoked by the bill - sticker , whose large flat basket , stuffed with placards , leaned near him against the settle . So splendid an apparition as Christian was not a little startling at the Cross - Keys , and was gazed at in expectant silence ; but he was a stranger in Pollard 's End , and was taken for the highest style of traveller when he declared that he was deucedly thirsty , ordered sixpennyworth of gin and a large jug of water , and , putting a few drops of the spirit into his own glass , invited Tommy Trounsem , who sat next him ; to help himself . Tommy was not slower than a shaking hand obliged him to be in accepting this invitation . He was a tall broad - shouldered old fellow , who had once been good - looking ; but his cheeks and chest were both hollow now , and his limbs were shrunken . "
123233	123242	123229	123229	master	760	" said Christian , pointing to the basket . "

123256	123296	123297	123297	I	0	" said Tommy , with a gruff hoarseness , which was the remnant of a jovial bass , and with an accent which differed from the Trebian fitfully , as an early habit is wo nt to reassert itself . "
123321	123322	123323	123323	Trounsem	376	" "
123328	123342	123326	123326	he	376	" the landlord observed , taking out his pipe with a low laugh . "
123414	123445	123446	123446	Spilkins	433	" The landlord peeped out from his fungous cluster of features with a beery confidence that the high figure of twenty had somehow raised the hypothetic value of his vote . "
123450	123461	123446	123446	Spilkins	433	" said Tommy , waving his hand to the landlord , "
123490	123491	123483	123483	he	3246	" "
123499	123509	123495	123495	I	0	" said the landlord , mildly holding his own . "
123518	123522	123510	123510	You	433	" retuned Tommy , "
123725	123757	123718	123718	you	760	" This appeal , accompanied by a blow on the table , while the landlord winked at the company , was addressed to Christian , who answered , with severe gravity , "
123772	123773	123758	123758	I	0	" "
123778	123790	123758	123758	I	0	" said Tommy , wagging his head from side to side . "
123861	123906	123858	123859	Old Nick	148	" As these celestial prospects might imply that a little extra gin was beginning to tell on the bill - sticker , Christian wanted to lose no time in arresting his attention . He laid his hand on Tommy 's arm and spoke emphatically . "
123989	123990	123980	123980	we	3266	" "
123993	123997	123980	123980	we	3266	" said Tommy . "
124004	124051	123980	123980	we	3266	" He was one of the thoroughly inured , originally hale drunkards , and did not easily lose his head or legs or the ordinary amount of method in his talk . Strangers often suppposed that Tommy was tipsy when he had only taken what he called "
124056	124173	124221	124221	I	0	" chiefly from that glorious contentment with himself and his adverse fortunes which is not usually characteristic of the sober Briton . He knocked the ashes out of his pipe , seized his paste - vessel and his basket , and prepared to start , with a satisfactory promise that he could know what he was about . The landlord and some others had confidently concluded that they understood all about Christian now . He was a Transome 's man , come to see after the bill - sticking in Transome 's interest . The landlord , telling his yellow wife snappishly to open the door for the gentleman , hoped soon to see him again . "
124183	124187	124221	124221	I	0	" he observed , "
124274	124275	124254	124254	I	0	" "
124280	124284	124254	124254	I	0	" said Christian ; "

124310	124347	124293	124293	You	5093	" said the landlord , thinking that where negatives were good the more you heard of them the better . As soon as the door had closed behind Christian and his new companion , Tommy said , "
124409	124410	124404	124404	you	760	" "
124420	124424	124404	124404	you	760	" said Christian . "
124439	124440	124429	124429	We	3281	" "
124530	124546	124524	124524	I	0	" said Tommy , wagging his head at Christian in the dimness undisturbed by gas . "

124816	124828	124796	124796	you	376	" said Tommy , with his knowing wag of the head , "
125047	125048	125080	125080	You	0	" "
125099	125193	125084	125084	I	0	" Tommy obeyed automatically , for he was now carried away by the rare opportunity of talking to a new listener , and was only eager to go on with his story . As soon as his back was turned , and he was stooping over his paste - pot , Christian , with quick adroitness , exchanged the placards in his own bag for those in Tommy 's basket . Christian 's placards had not been printed at Treby , but were a new lot which had been sent from Duffield that very day—"highly
125196	125201	125084	125084	I	0	" Quorlen had said , "
125215	125243	125084	125084	I	0	" Christian had read the first of the sheaf , and supposed they were all alike . He proceeded to hand one to Tommy , and said , "
125272	125273	125269	125269	you	0	" "
125561	125562	125609	125609	I	0	" "

125584	125599	125609	125609	I	0	" said Tommy , turning round and holding the paste - brush in suspense . "
125850	125947	125847	125847	you	3328	" At this crisis in Tommy 's story the grey clouds , which had been gradually thinning , opened sufficiently to let down the sudden moonlight , and show his poor battered old figure and face in the attitude and with the expression of a narrator sure of the coming effect on his auditor ; his body and neck stretched a little on one side , and his pastebrush held out with an alarming intention of tapping Christian 's coat - sleeve at the right moment . Christian started to a safe distance , and said , "
125960	125961	125952	125952	I	0	" "
125970	125977	125965	125965	you	3328	" said Tommy , with solemnity . "
126307	126308	126295	126295	I	0	" "
126316	126320	126295	126295	I	0	" said Christian . "
126326	126327	126328	126328	I	0	" "
126337	126338	126335	126335	master	760	" "
126357	126374	126403	126403	he	169	" Tommy turned to his work again , and Christian , continuing his help , said , "
126385	126386	126379	126380	Mr Jermyn	169	" "
126497	126511	126475	126475	Master	760	" The unwonted excitement of poor Tommy 's memory was producing a reaction . "
126516	126537	126514	126514	Tommy	376	" said Christian , who had just made a discovery among the placards which altered the bent of his thoughts , "
126599	126600	126608	126608	you	760	" "
126616	126633	126614	126614	Spilkins	433	" said Tommy , pocketing the half - crown , and showing his gratitude by giving this advice—"he
126736	127351	126725	126725	I	0	" The moonlight , which had lit up poor Tommy 's oratorical attitude , had served to light up for Christian the print of the placards . He had expected the copies to be various , and had turned them half over at different depths of the sheaf before drawing out those he offered to the bill - sticker . Suddenly the clearer light had shown him on one of them a name which was just then especially interesting to him , and all the more when occurring in a placard intended to dissuade the electors of North Loamshire from voting for the heir of the Transomes . He hastily turned over the lists that preceded and succeeded , that he might draw out and carry away all of this pattern ; for it might turn out to be wiser for him not to contribute to the publicity of handbills which contained allusions to Bycliffe versus Transome . There were about a dozen of them ; he pressed them together and thrust them into his pocket , returning all the rest to Tommy 's basket . To take away this dozen might not be to prevent similar bills from being posted up elsewhere , but he had reason to believe that these were all of the same kind which had been sent to Treby from Duffield . Christian 's interest in his practical joke had died out like a morning rushlight . Apart from this discovery in the placards , old Tommy 's story had some indications in it that were worth pondering over . Where was that well - informed Johnson now ? Was he still an understrapper of Jermyn 's ? With this matter in his thoughts , Christian only turned in hastily at Quorlen 's , threw down the black bag which contained the captured Radical handbills , said he had done the job , and hurried back to the Manor that he might study his problem . I doe believe that , as the gall has severall receptacles in several creatures , soe there 's scarce any creature but hath that emunctorye somewhere . Sir Thomas Browne . Fancy what a game at chess would be if all the chessmen had passions and intellects , more or less small and cunning : if you were not only uncertain about your adversary 's men , but a little uncertain also about your own ; if your knight could shuffle himself on to a new square by the sly ; if your bishop , in disgust at your castling , could wheedle your pawns out of their places ; and if your pawns , hating you because they are pawns , could make away from their appointed posts that you might get checkmate on a sudden . You might be the longest - headed of deductive reasoners , and yet you might be beaten by your own pawns . You would be especially likely to be beaten , if you depended arrogantly on your mathematical imagination , and regarded your passionate pieces with contempt . Yet this imaginary chess is easy compared with the game a man has to play against his fellow - men with other fellow - men for his instruments . He thinks himself sagacious , perhaps , because he trusts no bond except that of self - interest ; but the only self - interest he can safely rely on is what seems to be such to the mind he would use or govern . Can he ever be sure of knowing this ? Matthew Jermyn was under no misgivings as to the fealty of Johnson . He had "
127358	127833	127356	127356	Johnson	302	" and this seems to many men a reason for expecting devotion , in spite of the fact that they themselves , though very fond of their own persons and lives , are not at all devoted to the Maker they believe in . Johnson was a most serviceable subordinate . Being a man who aimed at respectability , a family man , who had a good church - pew , subscribed for engravings of banquet pictures where there were portraits of political celebrities , and wished his children to be more unquestionably genteel than their father , he presented all the more numerous handles of worldly motive by which a judicious superior might keep a hold on him . But this useful regard to respectability had its inconvenience in relation to such a superior : it was a mark of some vanity and some pride , which , if they were not touched just in the right handling - place , were liable to become raw and sensitive . Jermyn was aware of Johnson 's weaknesses , and thought he had flattered them sufficiently . But on the point of knowing when we are disagreeable , our human nature is fallible . Our lavender - water , our smiles , our compliments , and other polite falsities , are constantly offensive , when in the very nature of them they can only be meant to attract admiration and regard . Jermyn had often been unconsciously disagreeable to Johnson , over and above the constant offence of being an ostentatious patron . He would never let Johnson dine with his wife and daughters ; he would not himself dine at Johnson 's house when he was in town . He often did what was equivalent to pooh - poohing his conversation by not even appearing to listen , and by suddenly cutting it short with a query on a new subject . Jermyn was able and politic enough to have commanded a great deal of success in his life , but he could not help being handsome , arrogant , fond of being heard , indisposed to any kind of comradeship , amorous and bland towards women , cold and self - contained towards men . You will bear very strong denials that an attorney 's being handsome could enter into the dislike he excited ; but conversation consists a good deal in the denial of what is true . From the British point of view masculine beauty is regarded very much as it is in the drapery business : — as good solely for the fancy department — for young noblemen , artists , poets , and the clergy . Some one who , like Mr Lingon , was disposed to revile Jermyn ( perhaps it was Sir Maximus ) , had called him "
127848	127887	127834	127846	a cursed , sleek , handsome , long - winded , overbearing sycophant	3357	" epithets which expressed , rather confusedly , the mingled character of the dislike he excited . And serviceable John Johnson , himself sleek , and mindful about his broadcloth and his cambric fronts , had what he considered "
127889	128176	128177	128179	man of straw	3358	" enough within him to feel that dislike of Jermyn gradually gathering force through years of obligation and subjection , till it had become an actuating motive disposed to use an opportunity , if not to watch for one . It was not this motive , however , but rather the ordinary course of business , which accounted for Johnson 's playing a double part as an electioneering agent . What men do in elections , is not to be classed either among sins or marks of grace : it would be profane to include business in religion , and conscience refers to failure , not to success . Still , the sense of being galled by Jermyn 's harness was an additional reason for cultivating all relations that were independent of him ; and pique at Harold Transome 's behaviour to him in Jermyn 's office perhaps gave all the more zest to Johnson 's use of his pen and ink when he wrote a handbill in the service of Garstin , and Garstin 's incomparable agent , Putty , full of inuendoes against Harold Transome , as a descendant of the Durfey - Transomes . It is a natural subject of self - congratulation to a man , when special knowledge , gained long ago without any forecast , turns out to afford a special inspiration in the present ; and Johnson felt a new pleasure in the consciousness that he of all people in the world next to Jermyn had the most intimate knowledge of the Transome affairs . Still better — some of these affairs were secrets of Jermyn 's . If in an uncomplimentary spirit he might have been called Jermyn 's "
128181	129082	128177	128179	man of straw	3358	" it was a satisfaction to know that the unreality of the man John Johnson was confined to his appearance in annuity deeds , and that elsewhere he was solid , locomotive , and capable of remembering anything for his own pleasure and benefit . To act with doubleness towards a man whose own conduct was double , was so near an approach to virtue that it deserved to be called by no meaner name than Diplomacy . By such causes it came to pass that Christian held in his hands a bill in which Jermyn was playfully alluded to as Mr German Cozen , who won games by clever shunffling and odd tricks without any honour , and backed Durfey 's crib against Bycliffe,—in which it was adroitly implied that the so - called head of the Transomes was only the tail of the Durfeys,—and that some said the Durfeys would have died out and left their nest empty if it had not been for their German Cozen . Johnson had not dared to use any recollections except such as might credibly exist in other minds besides his own . In the truth of the case , no one but himself had the prompting to recall these outworn scandals ; but it was likely enough that such foul - winged things should be revived by election heats for Johnson to escape all suspicion . Christian could gather only dim and uncertain inferences from this flat irony and heavy joking ; but one chief thing was clear to him . He had been right in his conjecture that Jermyn 's interest about Bycliffe had its source in some claim of Bycliffe 's on the Transome property . And then , there was that story of the old bill - sticker 's , which , closely considered , indicated that the right of the present Transomes depended , or at least had depended , on the continuance of some other lives . Christian in his time had gathered enough legal notions to be aware that possession by one man sometimes depended on the life of another ; that a man might sell his own interest in property , and the interest of his descendants , while a claim on that property would still remain to some one else than the purchaser , supposing the descendants became extinct , and the interest they had sold were at an end . But under what conditions the claim might be valid or void in any particular case , was all darkness to him . Suppose Bycliffe had any such claim on the Transome estates : how was Christian to know whether at the present moment it was worth anything more than a bit of rotten parchment ? Old Tommy Trounsem had said that Johnson knew all about it . But even if Johnson were still above - ground — and all Johnsons are mortal — he might still be an understrapper of Jermyn 's , in which case his knowledge would be on the wrong side of the hedge for the purposes of Henry Scaddon . His immediate care must be to find out all he could about Johnson . He blamed himself for not having questioned Tommy further while he had him at command ; but on this head the bill - sticker could hardly know more than the less dilapidated denizens of Treby . Now it had happened that during the weeks in which Christian had been at work in trying to solve the enigma of Jermyn 's interest about Bycliffe , Johnson 's mind also had been somewhat occupied with suspicion and conjecture as to new information on the subject of the old Bycliffe claims which Jermyn intended to conceal from him . The letter which , after his interview with Christian , Jermyn had written with a sense of perfect safety to his faithful ally Johnson , was , as we know , written to a Johnson who had found his self - love incompatible with that faithfulness of which it was supposed to be the foundation . Anything that the patron felt it inconvenient for his obliged friend and servant to know , became by that very fact an object of peculiar curiosity . The obliged friend and servant secretly doated on his patron 's inconvenience , provided that he himself did not share it ; and conjecture naturally became active . Johnson 's legal imagination , being very differently furnished from Christian 's , was at no loss to conceive conditions under which there might arise a new claim on the Transome estates . He had before him the whole history of the settlement of those estates made a hundred years ago by John Justus Transome , entailing them , whilst in his possession , on his son Thomas and his heirs - male , with remainder to the Bycliffes in fee . He knew that Thomas , son of John Justus , proving a prodigal , had , without the knowledge of his father , the tenant in possession , sold his own and his descendants ' rights to a lawyer - cousin named Durfey ; that , therefore , the title of the Durfey - Transomes , in spite of that old Durfey 's tricks to show the contrary , depended solely on the purchase of the "
129085	129098	128177	128179	man of straw	3358	" thus created by Thomas Transome ; and that the Bycliffes were the "
129102	129342	128177	128179	man of straw	3358	" who might fairly oust the Durfey - Transomes if ever the issue of the prodigal Thomas went clean out of existence , and ceased to represent a right which he had bargained away from them . Johnson , as Jermyn 's subordinate , had been closely cognisant of the details concerning the suit instituted by successive Bycliffes , of whom Maurice Christian Bycliffe was the last , on the plea that the extinction of Thomas Transome 's line had actually come to pass — a weary suit , which had eaten into the fortunes of two families , and had only made the cankerworms fat . The suit had closed with the death of Maurice Christian Bycliffe in prison ; but before his death , Jermyn 's exertions to get evidence that there was still issue of Thomas Transome 's line surviving , as a security of the Durfey title , had issued in the discovery of a Thomas Transome at Littleshaw , in Stonyshire , who was the representative of a pawned inheritance . The death of Maurice had made this discovery useless — had made it seem the wiser part to say nothing about it ; and the fact had remained a secret known only to Jermyn and Johnson . No other Bycliffe was known or believed to exist , and the Durfey - Transomes might be considered safe , unless — yes , there was an "
129344	129942	129943	129943	I	0	" which Johnson could conceive : an heir or heiress of the Bycliffes — if such a personage turned out to be in existence — might some time raise a new and valid claim when once informed that wretched old Tommy Trounsem the bill - sticker , tottering drunkenly on the edge of the grave , was the last issue remaining above ground from that dissolute Thomas who played his Esau part a century before . While the poor old bill - sticker breathed , the Durfey - Transomes could legally keep their possession in spite of a possible Bycliffe proved real ; but not when the parish had buried the bill - sticker . Still , it is one thing to conceive conditions , and another to see any chance of proving their existence . Johnson at present had no glimpse of such a chance ; and even if he ever gained the glimpse , he was not sure that he should ever make any use of it . His inquiries of Medwin , in obedience to Jermyn 's letter , had extracted only a negative as to any information possessed by the lawyers of Bycliffe concerning a marriage , or expectation of offspring on his part . But Johnson felt not the less stung by curiosity to know what Jermyn had found out : that he had found something in relation to a possible Bycliffe , Johnson felt pretty sure . And he thought with satisfaction that Jermyn could not hinder him from knowing what he already knew about Thomas Transome 's issue . Many things might occur to alter his policy and give a new value to facts . Was it certain that Jermyn would always be fortunate ? When greed and unscrupulousness exhibit themselves on a grand historical scale , and there is question of peace or war or amicable partition , it often occurs that gentlemen of high diplomatic talents have their minds bent on the same object from different points of view . Each , perhaps , is thinking of a certain duchy or province , with a view to arranging the ownership in such a way as shall best serve the purposes of the gentleman with high diplomatic talents in whom each is more especially interested . But these select minds in high office can never miss their aims from ignorance of each other 's existence or whereabouts . Their high titles may be learned even by common people from every pocket almanac . But with meaner diplomatists , who might be mutually useful , such ignorance is often obstructive . Mr John Johnson and Mr Christian , otherwise Henry Scaddon , might have had a concentration of purpose and an ingenuity of device fitting them to make a figure in the parcelling of Europe , and yet they might never have met , simply because Johnson knew nothing of Christian , and because Christian did not know where to find Johnson . Coriolanus . Christian and Johnson did meet , however , by means that were quite incalculable . The incident which brought them into communication was due to Felix Holt , who of all men in the world had the least affinity either for the industrious or the idle parasite . Mr Lyon had urged Felix to go to Duffield on the 15th of December , to witness the nomination of the candidates for North Loamshire . The minister wished to hear what took place ; and the pleasure of gratifying him helped to outweigh some opposing reasons . "
129954	129959	129943	129943	I	0	" Felix had said . "
130018	130095	130100	130100	her	3360	" The weak point to which Felix referred was his liability to be carried completely out of his own mastery by indignant anger . His strong health , his renunciation of selfish claims , his habitual pre - occupation with large thoughts and with purposes independent of everyday casualities , secured him a fine and even temper , free from moodiness or irritability . He was full of long - suffering towards his unwise mother , who "
130113	130817	130100	130100	her	3360	" he had chosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of patience , that required those little rill - like out - flowings of goodness which in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought and passionate devotedness . In this way his energies served to make him gentle ; and now , in this twenty - sixth year of his life , they had ceased to make him angry , except in the presence of something that roused his deep indignation . When once exasperated , the passionateness of his nature threw off the yoke of a long - trained consciousness in which thought and emotion had been more and more completely mingled , and concentrated itself in a rage as ungovernable as that of boyhood . He was thoroughly aware of the liability , and knew that in such circumstances he could not answer for himself . Sensitive people with feeble frames have often the same sort of fury within them ; but they are themselves shattered , and shatter nothing . Felix had a terrible arm : he knew that he was dangerous ; and he avoided the conditions that might cause him exasperation , as he would have avoided intoxicating drinks if he had been in danger of intemperance . The nomination - day was a great epoch of successful trickery , or , to speak in a more parliamentary manner , of war - stratagem , on the part of skilful agents . And Mr Johnson had his share of inward chuckling and self - approval , as one who might justly expect increasing renown , and be some day in as general request as the great Putty himself . To have the pleasure and the praise of electioneering ingenuity , and also to get paid for it , without too much anxiety whether the ingenuity will achieve its ultimate end , perhaps gives to some select persons a sort of satisfaction in their superiority to their more agitated fellow - men that is worthy to be classed with those generous enjoyments of having the truth chiefly to yourself , and of seeing others in danger of drowning while you are high and dry , which seem to have been regarded as unmixed privileges by Lucretius and Lord Bacon . One of Mr Johnson 's great successes was this . Spratt , the hated manager of the Sproxton Colliery , in careless confidence that the colliers and other labourers under him would follow his orders , had provided carts to carry some loads of voteless enthusiasm to Duffield on behalf of Garstin ; enthusiasm which , being already paid for by the recognised benefit of Garstin 's existence as a capitalist with a share in the Sproxton mines , was not to cost much in the form of treating . A capitalist was held worthy of pious honour as the cause why working men existed . But Mr Spratt did not sufficiently consider that a cause which has to be proved by argument or testimony is not an object of passionate devotion to colliers : a visible cause of beer acts of them much more strongly . And even if there had been any love of the far - off Garstin , hatred of the too - immediate Spratt would have been the stronger motive . Hence Johnson 's calculations , made long ago with Chubb , the remarkable publican , had been well founded , and there had been diligent care to supply treating at Duffield in the name of Transome . After the election was over , it was not improbable that there would be much friendly joking between Putty and Johnson as to the success of this trick against Putty 's employer , and Johnson would be conscious of rising in the opinion of his celebrated senior . For the show of hands and the cheering , the hustling and the pelting , the roaring and the hissing , the hard hits with small missiles , and the soft hits with small jokes , were strong enough on the side of Transome to balance the similar "
130819	131348	130100	130100	her	3360	" for Garstin , even with the Debarry interest in his favour . And the inconvenient presence of Spratt was early got rid of by a dexterously managed accident , which sent him bruised and limping from the scene of action . Mr Chubb had never before felt so thoroughly that the occasion was up to a level with his talents , while the clear daylight in which his virtue would appear when at the election he voted , as his duty to himself bound him , for Garstin only , gave him thorough repose of conscience . Felix Holt was the only person looking on at the senseless exhibitions of this nomination - day , who knew from the beginning the history of the trick with the Sproxton men . He had been aware all along that the treating at Chubb 's had been continued , and that so far Harold Transome 's promise had produced no good fruits ; and what he was observing to - day , as he watched the uproarious crowd , convinced him that the whole scheme would be carried out just as if he had never spoken about it . He could be fair enough to Transome to allow that he might have wished , and yet have been unable , with his notions of success , to keep his promise ; and his bitterness towards the candidate only took the form of contemptuous pity ; for Felix was not sparing in his contempt for men who put their inward honour in pawn by seeking the prizes of the world . His scorn fell too readily on the fortunate . But when he saw Johnson passing to and fro , and speaking to Jermyn on the hustings , he felt himself getting angry , and jumped off the wheel of the stationary cart on which he was mounted , that he might no longer be in sight of this man , whose vitiating ca nt had made his blood hot and his fingers tingle on the first day of encountering him at Sproxton . It was a little too exasperating to look at this pink - faced rotund specimen of prosperity , to witness the power for evil that lay in his vulgar ca nt , backed by another man 's money , and to know that such stupid iniquity flourished the flags of Reform , and Liberalism , and justice to the needy . While the roaring and the scuffling were still going on , Felix , with his thick stick in his hand , made his way through the crowd , and walked on through the Duffield streets till he came out on a grassy suburb , where the houses surrounded a small common . Here he walked about in the breezy air , and ate his bread and apples , telling himself that this angry haste of his about evils that could only be remedied slowly , could be nothing else than obstructive , and might some day — he saw it so clearly that the thought seemed like a presentiment — be obstructive of his own work . "
131381	132049	132055	132056	all monopolists	3361	them"—these were the rules he had been constantly urging on himself . But what could be a greater waste than to beat a scoundrel who had law and opodeldoc at command ? After this meditation , Felix felt cool and wise enough to return into the town , not , however , intending to deny himself the satisfaction of a few pungent words wherever there was place for them . Blows are sarcasms turned stupid : wit is a form of force that leaves the limbs at rest . Anything that could be called a crowd was no longer to be seen . The show of hands having been pronounced to be in favour of Debarry and Transome , and a poll having been demanded for Garstin , the business of the day might be considered at an end . But in the street where the hustings were erected , and where the great hotels stood , there were many groups , as well as strollers and steady walkers to and fro . Men in superior greatcoats and well - brushed hats were awaiting with more or less impatience an important dinner , either at the Crown , which was Debarry 's house , or at the Three Cranes , which was Garstin 's , or at the Fox and Hounds , which was Transome 's . Knots of sober retailers , who had already dined , were to be seen at some shop - doors ; men in very shabby coats and miscellaneous head - coverings , inhabitants of Duffield and not county voters , were lounging about in dull silence , or listening , some to a grimy man in a flannel shirt , hatless and with turbid red hair , who was insisting on political points with much more ease than had seemed to belong to the gentlemen speakers on the hustings , and others to a Scotch vendor of articles useful to sell , whose unfamiliar accent seemed to have a guarantee of truth in it wanting as an association with everyday English . Some rough - looking pipe - smokers , or distinguished cigar - smokers , chose to walk up and down in isolation and silence . But the majority of those who had shówn a burning interest in the nomination had disappeared , and cockades no longer studded a close - pressed crowd , like , and also very unlike , meadow flowers among the grass . The street pavement was strangely painted with fragments of perishable missiles ground flat under heavy feet : but the workers were resting from their toil , and the buzz and tread and the fitfully discernible voices seemed like stillness to Felix after the roar with which the wide space had been filled when he left it . The group round the speaker in the flannel shirt stood at the corner of a side - street , and the speaker himself was elevated by the head and shoulders above his hearers , not because he was tall , but because he stood on a projecting stone . At the opposite corner of the turning was the great inn of the Fox and Hounds , and this was the ultra - Liberal quarter of the High Street . Felix was at once attracted by this group ; he liked the look of the speaker , whose bare arms were powerfully muscular , though he had the pallid complexion of a man who lives chiefly amidst the heat of furnaces . He was leaning against the dark stone building behind him with folded arms , the grimy paleness of his shirt and skin standing out in high relief against the dark stone building behind him . He lifted up one fore - finger , and marked his emphasis with it as he spoke . His voice was high and not strong , but Felix recognised the fluency and the method of a habitual preacher or lecturer . "
132058	132063	132064	132064	We	3362	" he was saying . "
132222	132223	132193	132193	I	0	" "
132228	132292	132193	132193	I	0	" said Felix , in his sonorous voice , which seemed to give a new impressiveness to what the speaker had said . Every one looked at him : the well - washed face and its educated expression along with a dress more careless than that of most well - to - do workmen on a holiday , made his appearance strangely arresting . "
132299	132305	132193	132193	I	0	" the speaker went on , "
133242	133243	133206	133206	I	0	" "
133250	133274	133206	133206	I	0	" said Felix , again startling the audience into looking at him . But the speaker glanced coldly at him and went on . "
133393	133462	133385	133385	you	3446	" At the last word , the speaker stepped down from his slight eminence , and walked away rapidly , like a man whose leisure was exhausted , and who must go about his business . But he had left an appetite in his audience for further oratory , and one of them seemed to express a general sentiment as he turned immediately to Felix , and said , "
133472	133613	133469	133469	you	5093	" Felix did at once what he would very likely have done without being asked — he stepped on to the stone , and took off his cap by an instinctive prompting that always led him to speak uncovered . The effect of his figure in relief against the stone background was unlike that of the previous speaker . He was considerably taller , his head and neck were more massive , and the expression of his mouth and eyes was something very different from the mere acuteness and rather hard - lipped antagonism of the trades - union man . Felix Holt 's face had the look of habitual meditative abstraction from objects of mere personal vanity or desire , which is the peculiar stamp of culture , and makes a very roughly - cut face worthy to be called "
133619	133755	133614	133617	the human face divine	3452	" Even lions and dogs know a distinction between men 's glances ; and doubtless those Duffield men , in the expectation with which they looked up at Felix , were unconsciously influenced by the grandeur of his full yet firm mouth , and the calm clearness of his grey eyes , which were somehow unlike what they were accustomed to see along with an old brown velveteen coat , and an absence of chin - propping . When he began to speak , the contrast of voice was still stronger than that of appearance . The man in the flannel shirt had not been heard — had probably not cared to be heard — beyond the immediate group of listeners . But Felix at once drew the attention of persons comparatively at a distance . "
133760	133772	133614	133617	the human face divine	3452	" he said , almost the moment after he was addressed , "
134233	134234	134224	134224	I	0	" "
134239	134350	134224	134224	I	0	" said several voices , but they were not those of the original group ; they belonged to some strollers who had been attracted by Felix Holt 's vibrating voice , and were Tories from the Crown . Among them was Christian , who was smoking a cigar with a pleasure he always felt in being among people who did not know him , and doubtless took him to be something higher than he really was . Hearers from the Fox and Hounds also were slowly adding themselves to the nucleus . Felix , accessible to the pleasure of being listened to , went on with more and more animation : "
134569	134570	134551	134551	my	0	" "
134576	134589	134551	134551	my	0	" said a man in dirty fustian , with a scornful laugh . "
134601	134602	134603	134603	I	0	" "
134615	134619	134603	134603	I	0	" said Felix , "
134967	135043	135044	135044	They	3506	" Felix had seen every face around him , and had particularly noticed a recent addition to his audience ; but now he looked before him without appearing to fix his glance on any one . In spite of his cooling meditations an hour ago , his pulse was getting quickened by indignation , and the desire to crush what he hated was likely to vent itself in articulation . His tone became more biting . "
135424	135613	135422	135422	Johnson	302	" Felix was interrupted by an explosion of laughter from a majority of the bystanders . Some eyes had been turned on Johnson , who stood on the right hand of Felix , at the very beginning of the description , and these were gradually followed by others , till at last every hearer 's attention was fixed on him , and the first burst of laughter from the two or three who knew the attorney 's name , let every one sufficiently into the secret to make the amusement common . Johnson , who had kept his ground till his name was mentioned , now turned away , looking unusually white after being unusually red , and feeling by an attorney 's instinct for his pocket - book , as if he felt it was a case for taking down the names of witnesses . All the well - deressed hearers turned away too , thinking they had had the cream of the speech in the joke against Johnson , which , as a thing worth telling , helped to recall them to the scene of dinner . "
135619	135658	135661	135663	a London attorney	3532	" said Christian to a young man who had been standing near him , and had been one of the first to laugh . Christian 's curiosity had naturally been awakened by what might prove a golden opportunity . "
135711	135712	135695	135695	he	3534	" "
135728	135732	135719	135719	Johnson	302	" said Christian . "
135796	136390	136400	136400	Tory	195	" Another turn along the street enabled Christian to come to a resolution . Having seen Jermyn drive away an hour before , he was in no fear : he walked at once to the Fox and Hounds and asked to speak to Mr Johnson . A brief interview , in which Christian ascertained that he had before him the Johnson mentioned by the bill - sticker , issued in the appointment of a longer one at a later hour ; and before they left Duffield they had come not exactly to a mutual understanding , but to an exchange of information mutually welcome . Christian had been very cautious in the commencement , only intimating that he knew something important which some chance hints had induced him to think might be interesting to Mr Johnson , but that this entirely depended on how far he had a common interest with Mr Jermyn . Johnson replied that he had much business in which that gentleman was not concerned , but that to a certain extent they had a common interest . Probably then , Christian observed , the affairs of the Transome estate were part of the business in which Mr Jermyn and Mr Johnson might be understood to represent each other — in which case he need not detain Mr Johnson ? At this hint Johnson could not conceal that he was becoming eager . He had no idea what Christian 's information was , but there were many grounds on which Johnson desired to know as much as he could about the Transome affairs independently of Jermyn . By little and little an understanding was arrived at . Christian told of his interview with Tommy Trounsem , and stated that if Johnson could show him whether the knowledge could have any legal value , he could bring evidence that a legitimate child of Bycliffe 's existed : he felt certain of his fact , and of his proof . Johnson explained , that in this case the death of the old bill - sticker would give the child the first valid claim to the Bycliffe heirship ; that for his own part he should be glad to further a true claim , but that caution must be observed . How did Christian know that Jermyn was informed on this subject ? Christian , more and more convinced that Johnson would be glad to counteract Jermyn , at length became explicit about Esther , but still withheld his own real name , and the nature of his relations with Bycliffe . He said he would bring the rest of his information when Mr Johnson took the case up seriously , and placed it in the hands of Bycliffe 's old lawyers — of course he would do that ? Johnson replied that he would certainly do that ; but that there were legal niceties which Mr Christian was probably not acquainted with ; that Esther 's claim had not yet accrued ; and that hurry was useless . The two men parted , each in distrust of the other , but each well pleased to have learned something . Johnson was not at all sure how he should act , but thought it likely that events would soon guide him . Christian was beginning to meditate a way of securing his own ends without depending in the least on Johnson 's procedure . It was enough for him that he was now assured of Esther 's legal claim on the Transome estates . "
136523	136927	137816	137817	Mr Nolan	355	" — NORTH 's Examen , p. 321 . At last the great epoch of the election for North Loamshire had arrived . The roads approaching Treby were early traversed by a larger number of vehicles , horsemen , and also foot - passengers , than were ever seen there at the annual fair . Treby was the polling - place for many voters whose faces were quite strange in the town ; and if there were some strangers who did not come to poll , though they had business not unconnected with the election , they were not liable to be regarded with suspicion or especial curiosity . It was understood that no division of a county had ever been more thoroughly canvassed , and that there would be a hard run between Garstin and Transome . Mr Johnson 's head - quarters were at Duffield ; but it was a maxim which he repeated after the great Putty , that a capable agent makes himself omnipresent ; and quite apart from the express between him and Jermyn , Mr John Johnson 's presence in the universe had potent effects on this December day at Treby Magna . A slight drizzling rain which was observed by some Tories who looked out of their bedroom windows before six o'clock , made them hope that , after all , the day might pass off better than alarmists had expected . The rain was felt to be somehow on the side of quiet and Conservatism ; but soon the breaking of the clouds and the mild gleams of a December sun brought back previous apprehensions . As there were already precedents for riot at a Reformed election , and as the Trebian district had had its confidence in the natural course of things somewhat shaken by a landed proprietor with an old name offering himself as a Radical candidate , the election had been looked forward to by many with a vague sense that it would be an occasion something like a fighting match , when bad characters would probably assemble , and there might be struggles and alarms for respectable men , which would make it expedient for them to take a little neat brandy as a precaution beforehand and a restorative afterwards . The tenants on the Transome estate were comparatively fearless : poor Mr Goffe , of Rabbit 's End , considered that "
136936	137204	137816	137817	Mr Nolan	355	" and that an election was no worse than the sheep - rot ; while Mr Dibbs , taking the more cheerful view of a prosperous man , reflected that if the Radicals were dangerous , it was safer to be on their side . It was the voters for Debarry and Garstin who considered that they alone had the right to regard themselves as targets for evil - minded men ; and Mr Crowder , if he could have got his ideas countenanced , would have recommended a muster of farm - servants with defensive pitchforks on the side of Church and King . But the bolder men were rather gratified by the prospect of being groaned at , so that they might face about and groan in return . Mr Crow , the high constable of Treby , inwardly rehearsed a brief address to a riotous crowd in case it should be wanted , having been warned by the Rector that it was a primary duty on these occasions to keep a watch against provocation as well as violence . The Rector , with a brother magistrate who was on the spot , had thought it desirable to swear in some special constables , but the presence of loyal men not absolutely required for the polling was not looked at in the light of a provocation . The Benefit Clubs from various quarters made a show , some with the orange - coloured ribbons and streamers of the true Tory candidate , some with the mazarine of the Whig . The orange - coloured bands played "
137208	137218	137816	137817	Mr Nolan	355	" and a louder mazarine band came across them with "
137229	137291	137292	137294	these brave fellows	3547	lad"—probably as the tune the most symbolical of Liberalism which their repertory would furnish . There was not a single club bearing the Radical blue : the Sproxton Club members wore the mazarine , and Mr Chubb wore so much of it that he looked ( at a sufficient distance ) like a very large gentianella . It was generally understood that "
137296	137311	137292	137294	these brave fellows	3547	" representing the fine institution of Benefit Clubs , and holding aloft the motto , "
137317	137645	137292	137294	these brave fellows	3547	" were a civil force calculated to encourage voters of sound opinions and keep up their spirits . But a considerable number of unadorned heavy navvies , colliers , and stone - pit men , who used their freedom as British subjects to be present in Treby on this great occasion , looked like a possibly uncivil force whose politics were dubious until it was clearly seen for whom they cheered and for whom they groaned . Thus the way up to the polling - booths was variously lined , and those who walked it , to whatever side they belonged , had the advantage of hearing from the opposite side what were the most marked defects or excesses in their personal appearance ; for the Trebians of that day held , without being aware that they had Cicero 's authority for it , that the bodily blemishes of an opponent were a legitimate ground for ridicule ; but if the voter frustrated wit by being handsome , he was groaned at and satirised according to a formula , in which the adjective was Tory , Whig , or Radical , as the case might be , and the substantive a blank to be filled up after the taste of the speaker . Some of the more timid had chosen to go through this ordeal as early as possible in the morning . One of the earliest was Mr Timothy Rose , the gentleman - farmer from Leek Malton . He had left home with some foreboding , having swathed his more vital parts in layers of flannel , and put on two greatcoats as a soft kind of armour . But reflecting with some trepidation that there were no resources for protecting his head , he once more wavered in his intention to vote ; he once more observed to Mrs Rose that these were hard times when a man of independent property was expected to vote "
137650	137665	137292	137294	these brave fellows	3547	" but finally , coerced by the sense that he should be looked ill on "
137669	137813	137816	137817	Mr Nolan	355	" if he did not stand by the gentlemen round about , he set out in his gig , taking with him a powerful waggoner , whom he ordered to keep him in sight as he went to the polling - booth . It was hardly more than nine o'clock when Mr Rose , having thus come up to the level of his times , cheered himself with a little cherry - brandy at the Marquis , drove away in a much more courageous spirit , and got down at Mr Nolan 's , just outside the town . The retired Londoner , he considered , was a man of experience , who would estimate properly the judicious course he had taken , and could make it known to others . Mr Nolan was superintending the removal of some shrubs in his garden . "
137819	137837	137816	137817	Mr Nolan	355	" said Rose , twinkling a self - complacent look over the red prominence of his cheeks , "
137847	137848	137839	137839	you	355	" "
137861	137862	137856	137856	I	0	" "
137922	137923	137907	137907	Nolan	355	" "
137931	137976	137907	137907	Nolan	355	" said the wiry - faced Nolan , pinching his under - lip between his thumb and finger , and giving one of those wonderful universal shrugs , by which he seemed to be recalling all his garments from a tendency to disperse themselves . "
137984	137985	137907	137907	Nolan	355	" "
138140	138141	138131	138131	he	183	" "
138148	138158	138137	138137	they	3560	" said Mr Nolan , coughing down a laugh , "
138192	138193	138179	138179	you	5093	" "
138213	138227	138211	138211	Nolan	355	" said Mr Rose , rather crestfallen , though sustained by inward warmth . "
138276	138426	138211	138211	Nolan	355	" added Mr Rose , apparently confounding a toast with a salutation , for he put out his hand for a passing shake , and then stepped into his gig again . At the time that Mr Timothy Rose left the town , the crowd in King Street and in the market - place , where the polling - booths stood , was fluctuating . Voters as yet were scanty , and brave fellows who had come from any distance this morning , or who had sat up late drinking the night before , required some reinforcement of their strength and spirits . Every public - house in Treby , not excepting the venerable and sombre Cross - Keys , was lively with changing and numerous company . Not , of course , that there was any treating : treating necessarily had stopped , from moral scruples , when once "
138432	138590	138211	138211	Nolan	355	" but there was drinking , which did equally well under any name . Poor Tommy Trounsem , breakfasting here on Falstaff 's proportion of bread , and something which , for gentility 's sake , I will call sack , was more than usually victorious over the ills of life , and felt himself one of the heroes of the day . He had an immense light - blue cockade in his hat , and an amount of silver in a dirty little canvass bag which astonished himself . For some reason , at first inscrutable to him , he had been paid for his bill - sticking with great liberality at Mr Jermyn 's office , in spite of his having been the victim of a trick by which he had once lost his own bills and pasted up Debarry 's ; but he soon saw that this was simply a recognition of his merit as "
138600	138669	138211	138211	Nolan	355	" and also of his peculiar share in an occasion when the family was to get into Parliament . Under these circumstances , it was due from him that he should show himself prominently where business was going forward , and give additional value by his presence to every vote for Transome . With this view he got a half - pint bottle filled with his peculiar kind of "
138672	138805	138211	138211	Nolan	355	" and hastened back to the market - place , feeling good - natured and patronising towards all political parties , and only so far partial as his family bound him to be . But a disposition to concentrate at that extremity of King Street which issued in the market - place was not universal among the increasing crowd . Some of them seemed attracted towards another nucleus at the other extremity of King Street , near the Seven Stars . This was Garstin 's chief house , where his committee sat , and it was also a point which must necessarily be passed by many voters entering the town on the eastern side . It seemed natural that the mazarine colours should be visible here , and that Pack , the tall "
138807	139296	138211	138211	Nolan	355	" of the Sproxton men , should be seen moving to and fro where there would be a frequent opportunity of cheering the voters for a gentleman who had the chief share in the Sproxton mines . But the side lanes and entries out of King Street were numerous enough to relieve any pressure if there was need to make way . The lanes had a distinguished reputation . Two of them had odours of brewing ; one had a side entrance to Mr Tiliot 's wine and spirit vaults ; up another Mr Muscat 's cheeses were frequently being unloaded ; and even some of the entries had those cheerful suggestions of plentiful provision which were among the characteristics of Treby . Between ten and eleven the voters came in more rapid succession , and the whole scene became spirited . Cheers , sarcasms , and oaths , which seemed to have a flavour of wit for many hearers , were beginning to be reinforced by more practical demonstrations , dubiously jocose . There was a disposition in the crowd to close and hem in the way for voters , either going or coming , until they had paid some kind of toll . It was difficult to see who set the example in the transition from words to deeds . Some thought it was due to Jacob Cuff , a Tory charity - man , who was a well - known ornament of the pothouse , and gave his mind much leisure for amusing devices ; but questions of origination in stirring periods are notoriously hard to settle . It is by no means necessary in human things that there should be only one beginner . This , however , is certain — that Mr Chubb , who wished it to be noticed that he voted for Garstin solely , was one of the first to get rather more notice than he wished , and that he had his hat knocked off and crushed in the interest of Debarry by Tories opposed to coalition . On the other hand , some said it was at the same time that Mr Pink , the saddler , being stopped on his way and made to declare that he was going to vote for Debarry , got himself well chalked as to his coat , and pushed up an entry , where he remained the prisoner of terror combined with the want of any back outlet , and never gave his vote that day . The second Tory joke was performed with much gusto . The majority of the Transome tenants came in a body from the Ram Inn , with Mr Banks the bailiff leading them . Poor Goffe was the last of them , and his worn melancholy look and forward - leaning gait gave the jocose Cuff the notion that the farmer was not what he called "
139299	139431	139297	139299	compus . "	7723	" Mr Goffe was cut off from his companions and hemmed in ; asked , by voices with hot breath close to his ear , how many horses he had , how many cows , how many fat pigs ; then jostled from one to another , who made trumpets with their hands and deafened him by telling him to vote for Debarry . In this way the melancholy Goffe was hustled on till he was at the polling - booth — filled with confused alarms , the immediate alarm being that of having to go back in still worse fashion than he had come . Arriving in this way after the other tenants had left , he astonished all hearers who knew him for a tenant of the Transomes by saying "
139434	139677	139297	139299	compus . "	7723	" and was jostled back trembling amid shouts of laughter . By stages of this kind the fun grew faster , and was in danger of getting rather serious . The Tories began to feel that their jokes were returned by others of a heavier sort , and that the main strength of the crowd was not on the side of sound opinion , but might come to be on the side of sound cudgelling and kicking . The navvies and pitmen in dishabille seemed to be multiplying , and to be clearly not belonging to the party of Order . The shops were freely resorted to for various forms of playful missiles and weapons ; and news came to the magistrates , watching from the large window of the Marquis , that a gentleman coming in on horseback at the other end of the street to vote for Garstin had had his horse turned round and frightened into a headlong gallop out of it again . Mr Crow and his subordinates , and all the special constables , felt that it was necessary to make some energetic effort , or else every voter would be intimidated and the poll must be adjourned . The Rector determined to get on horseback and go amidst the crowd with the constables ; and he sent a message to Mr Lingon , who was at the Ram , calling on him to do the same . "
139680	140429	139297	139299	compus . "	7723	" was sure the good fellows meant no harm , but he was courageous enough to face any bodily dangers , and rode out in his brown leggings and coloured bandanna , speaking persuasively . It was nearly twelve o'clock when this sally was made : the constables and magistrates tried the most pacific measures , and they seemed to succeed . There was a rapid thinning of the crowd : the most boisterous disappeared , or seemed to do so by becoming quiet ; missiles ceased to fly , and a sufficient way was cleared for voters along King Street . The magistrates returned to their quarters , and the constables took convenient posts of observation . Mr Wace , who was one of Debarry 's committee , had suggested to the Rector that it might be wise to send for the military from Duffield , with orders that they should station themselves at Hathercote , three miles off : there was so much property in the town that it would be better to make it secure against risks . But the Rector felt that this was not the part of a moderate and wise magistrate , unless the signs of riot recurred . He was a brave man , and fond of thinking that his own authority sufficed for the maintenance of the general good in Treby . Mrs Browning . Felix Holt , seated at his work without his pupils , who had asked for a holiday with a notion that the wooden booths promised some sort of show , noticed about eleven o'clock that the noises which reached him from the main street were getting more and more tumultuous . He had long seen bad auguries for this election , but , like all people who dread the prophetic wisdom that ends in desiring the fulfilment of its own evil forebodings , he had checked himself with remembering that , though many conditions were possible which might bring on violence , there were just as many which might avert it . There would , perhaps , be no other mischief than what he was already certain of . With these thoughts he had sat down quietly to his work , meaning not to vex his soul by going to look on at things he would fain have made different if he could . But he was of a fibre that vibrated too strongly to the life around him to shut himself away in quiet , even from suffering and irremediable wrong . As the noises grew louder , and wrought more and more strongly on his imagination , he was obliged to lay down his delicate wheel - work . His mother came from her turnip - paring in the kitchen , where little Job was her companion , to observe that they must be killing everybody in the High Street , and that the election , which had never been before at Treby , must have come for a judgment ; that there were mercies where you did n't look for them , and that she thanked God in His wisdom for making her live up a back street . Felix snatched his cap and rushed out . But when he got to the turning into the marketplace the magistrates were already on horseback there , the constables were moving about , and Felix observed that there was no strong spirit of resistance to them . He stayed long enough to see the partial dispersion of the crowd and the restoration of tolerable quiet , and then went back to Mrs Holt to tell her that there was nothing to fear now : he was going out again , and she must not be in any anxiety at his absence . She might set by his dinner for him . Felix had been thinking of Esther and her probable alarm at the noises that must have reached her more distinctly than they had reached him , for Malthouse Yard was removed but a little way from the main street . Mr Lyon was away from home , having been called to preach charity sermons and attend meetings in a distant town ; and Esther , with the plaintive Lyddy for her sole companion , was not cheerfully circumstanced . Felix had not been to see her yet since her father 's departure , but to - day he gave way to new reasons . "
140437	140476	140430	140431	Miss Esther	208	" Lyddy said , trying to see what was going on . But before she was fetched she came running down the stairs , drawn by the knock at the door , which had shaken the small dwelling . "
140485	140491	140477	140477	I	0	" she said , eagerly . "
140496	140510	140511	140511	I	0	" When she had shut the parlour door behind them , Felix said , "
140546	140547	140548	140548	I	0	" "
140552	140556	140548	140548	I	0	" said Esther . "
140617	140632	140604	140604	I	0	" she added , smiling , with a determination not to show much feeling . "
140642	140659	140604	140604	I	0	" They sat down at the extremities of the old black sofa , and Felix said , "
140796	140830	140832	140832	I	0	" Felix broke off , as if this talk were futile , clasped his hands behind his head , and , leaning backward , looked at Esther , who was looking at him . "
140839	140851	140832	140832	I	0	" he said , after a moment , which seemed long . "
140855	140950	140832	140832	I	0	" said Esther , colouring . To relieve herself she took some work and bowed her head over her stitching . It was in reality a little heaven to her that Felix was there , but she saw beyond it — saw that by - and - by he would be gone , and that they should be farther on their way , not towards meeting , but parting . His will was impregnable . He was a rock , and she was no more to him than the white clinging mist - cloud . "
140966	140978	140958	140958	you	3582	" he said , abruptly , after a minute 's silence . "
140992	141003	140982	140982	you	0	" said Esther , almost bitterly , without looking up . "
141053	141054	141043	141043	You	0	" "
141065	141077	141056	141056	I	0	" said Esther , with a little toss of the head . "
141080	141081	141056	141056	I	0	" "
141114	141115	141085	141085	you	0	" "
141126	141163	141164	141164	I	0	" There was an expression of painful beseeching in the tone with which Felix said this . Esther let her work fall on her lap and looked at him , but she was unable to speak . "
141204	141319	141174	141174	you	0	" This breaking - off in speech was something quite new in Felix . For the first time he had lost his self - possession , and turned his eyes away . He was at variance with himself . He had begun what he felt that he ought not to finish . Esther , like a woman as she was — a woman waiting for love , never able to ask for it — had her joy in these signs of her power ; but they made her generous , not chary , as they might have done if she had had a pettier disposition . She said , with deep yet timid earnestness , "
141340	141413	141414	141414	We	3591	" All the finest part of Esther 's nature trembled in those words . To be right in great memorable moments , is perhaps the thing we need most desire for ourselves . Felix as quick as lightning turned his look upon her again , and , leaning forward , took her sweet hand and held it to his lips some moments before he let it fall again and raised his head . "
141426	141453	141414	141414	We	3591	" he said , leaning his elbow on the back of the sofa , and supporting his head as he looked at her with calm sadness . "
141478	141556	141560	141560	you	3593	" He smiled at her , but she sat biting her inner lip , and pressing her hands together . She desired to be worthy of what she reverenced in Felix , but the inevitable renunciation was too difficult . She saw herself wandering through the future weak and forsaken . The charming sauciness was all gone from her face , but the memory of it made this child - like dependent sorrow all the more touching . "
141563	141600	141560	141560	you	3593	" Felix burst out , leaning nearer to her ; but the next instant he started up , went to the table , took his cap in his hand , and came in front of her . "
141605	142545	141560	141560	you	3593	" he said , very gently , not daring to put out his hand . But Esther put up hers instead of speaking . He just pressed it and then went away . She heard the doors close behind him , and felt free to be miserable . She cried bitterly . If she might have married Felix Holt , she could have been a good woman . She felt no trust that she could ever be good without him . Felix reproached himself . He would have done better not to speak in that way . But the prompting to which he had chiefly listened had been the desire to prove to Esther that he set a high value on her feelings . He could not help seeing that he was very important to her ; and he was too simple and sincere a man to ape a sort of humility which would not have made him any the better if he had possessed it . Such pretences turn our lives into sorry dramas . And Felix wished Esther to know that her love was dear to him as the beloved dead are dear . He felt that they must not marry — that they would ruin each other 's lives . But he had longed for her to know fully that his will to be always apart from her was renunciation , not an easy preference . In this he was thoroughly generous ; and yet , now some subtle , mysterious conjuncture of impressions and circumstances had made him speak , he questioned the wisdom of what he had done . Express confessions give definiteness to memories that might more easily melt away without them ; and Felix felt for Esther 's pain as the strong soldier , who can march on hungering without fear that he shall faint , feels for the young brother — the maiden - cheeked conscript whose load is too heavy for him . Julius Cæsar . Felix could not go home again immediately after quitting Esther . He got out of the town , skirted it a little while , looking across the December stillness of the fields , and then re - entered it by the main road into the market - place , thinking that , after all , it would be better for him to look at the busy doings of men than to listen in solitude to the voices within him ; and he wished to know how things were going on . It was now nearly half - past one , and Felix perceived that the street was filling with more than the previous crowd . By the time he got in front of the booths , he was himself so surrounded by men who were being thrust hither and thither that retreat would have been impossible ; and he went where he was obliged to go , although his height and strength were above the average even in a crowd where there were so many heavy - armed workmen used to the pick - axe . Almost all shabby - coated Trebians must have been there , but the entries and back - streets of the town did not supply the mass of the crowd ; and besides the rural incomers , both of the more decent and the rougher sort , Felix , as he was pushed along , thought he discerned here and there men of that keener aspect which is only common in manufacturing towns . But at present there was no evidence of any distinctly mischievous design . There was only evidence that the majority of the crowd were excited with drink , and that their action could hardly be calculated on more than those of oxen and pigs congregated amidst hootings and pushings . The confused deafening shouts , the incidental , fighting , the knocking over , pulling and scuffling , seemed to increase every moment . Such of the constables as were mixed with the crowd were quite helpless ; and if an official staff was seen above the heads , it moved about fitfully , showing as little sign of a guiding hand as the summit of a buoy on the waves . Doubtless many hurts and bruises had been received , but no one could know the amount of injuries that were widely scattered . It was clear that no more voting could be done , and the poll had been adjourned . The probabilities of serious mischief had grown strong enough to prevail over the Rector 's objection to getting military aid within reach ; and when Felix re - entered the town , a galloping messenger had already been despatched to Duffield . The Rector wished to ride out again , and read the Riot Act from a point where he could be better heard than from the window of the Marquis ; but Mr Crow , the high constable , who had returned from closer observation , insisted that the risk would be too great . New special constables had been sworn in , but Mr Crow said prophetically that if once mischief began , the mob was past caring for constables . But the Rector 's voice was ringing and penetrating , and when he appeared on the narrow balcony and read the formula , commanding all men to go to their homes or about their lawful business , there was a strong transient effect . Every one within hearing listened , and for a few moments after the final words , "
142551	142801	141560	141560	you	3593	" the comparative silence continued . Then the people began to move , the buzz rose again , and grew , and grew , till it turned to shouts and roaring as before . The movement was that of a flood hemmed in ; it carried nobody away . Whether the crowd would obey the order to disperse themselves within an hour , was a doubt that approached nearer and nearer to a negative certainty . Presently Mr Crow , who held himself a tactician , took a well - intentioned step , which went far to fulfil his own prophecy . He had arrived with the magistrates by a back way at the Seven Stars , and here again the Riot Act was read from a window , with much the same result as before . The Rector had returned by the same way to the Marquis , as the headquarters most suited for administration , but Mr Crowe remained at the other extremity of King Street , where some awe - striking presence was certainly needed . Seeing that the time was passing , and all effect from the voice of law had disappeared , he showed himself at an upper window , and addressed the crowd , telling them that the soldiers had been sent for , and that if they did not disperse they would have cavalry upon them instead of constables . Mr Crow , like some other high constables more celebrated in history , "
142807	143030	141560	141560	you	3593	" that is to say , he enjoyed many things which caused his reputation to be bad , and he was anything but popular in Treby . It is probable that a pleasant message would have lost something from his lips , and what he actually said was so unpleasant , that , instead of persuading the crowd , it appeared to enrage them . Some one , snatching a raw potato from a sack in the greengrocer 's shop behind him , threw it at the constable , and hit him on the mouth . Straightway raw potatoes and turnips were flying by twenties at the windows of the Seven Stars , and the panes were smashed . Felix , who was half - way up the street , heard the voices turning to a savage roar , and saw a rush towards the hardware shop , which furnished more effective weapons and missiles than turnips and potatoes . Then a cry ran along that the Tories had sent for the soldiers , and if those among the mob who called themselves Tories as willingly as anything else were disposed to take whatever called itself the Tory side , they only helped the main result of reckless disorder . But there were proofs that the predominant will of the crowd was against "
143035	143053	141560	141560	you	3593	" and in favour of Transome . Several shops were invaded , and they were all of them "
143057	143650	143651	143651	Spratt	308	" The tradesmen who could do so , now locked their doors and barricaded their windows within . There was a panic among the householders of this hitherto peaceful town , and a general anxiety for the military to arrive . The Rector was in painful anxiety on this head : he had sent out two messengers as secretly as he could towards Hathercote , to order the soldiers to ride straight to the town ; but he feared that these messengers had been somehow intercepted . It was three o'clock : more than an hour had elapsed since the reading of the Riot Act . The Rector of Treby Magna wrote an indignant message and sent it to the Ram , to Mr Lingon , the Rector of Little Treby , saying that there was evidently a Radical animus in the mob , and that Mr Transome 's party should hold themselves peculiarly responsible . Where was Mr Jermyn ? Mr Lingon replied that he was going himself out towards Duffield to see after the soldiers . As for Jermyn , he was not that attorney 's sponsor : he believed that Jermyn was gone away somewhere on business — to fetch voters . A serious effort was now being made by all the civil force at command . The December day would soon be passing into evening , and all disorder would be aggravated by obscurity . The horrors of fire were as likely to happen as any minor evil . The constables , as many of them as could do so , armed themselves with carbines and sabres : all the respectable inhabitants who had any courage , prepared themselves to struggle for order ; and many felt with Mr Wace and Mr Tiliot that the nearest duty was to defend the breweries and the spirit and wine vaults , where the property was of a sort at once most likely to be threatened and most dangerous in its effects . The Rector , with fine determination , got on horseback again , as the best mode of leading the constables , who could only act efficiently in a close body . By his direction the column of armed men avoided the main street , and made their way along a back road , that they might occupy the two chief lanes leading to the wine - vaults and the brewery ; and bear down on the crowd from these openings , which it was especially desirable to guard . Meanwhile Felix Holt had been hotly occupied in King Street . After the first window - smashing at the Seven Stars , there was a sufficient reason for damaging that inn to the utmost . The destructive spirit tends towards completeness ; and any object once maimed or otherwise injured , is as readily doomed by unreasoning men as by unreasoning boys . Also the Seven Stars sheltered Spratt ; and to some Sproxton men in front of that inn it was exasperating that Spratt should be safe and sound on a day when blows were going , and justice might be rendered . And again , there was the general desirableness of being inside a public - house . Felix had at last been willingly urged on to this spot . Hitherto swayed by the crowd , he had been able to do nothing but defend himself and keep on his legs ; but he foresaw that the people would burst into the inn ; he heard cries of "
143653	143654	143651	143651	Spratt	308	" "
143659	143660	143651	143651	Spratt	308	" "
143667	143668	143661	143661	We	3597	" "
143672	143850	143661	143661	We	3597	" It was not unlikely that lives might be sacrificed ; and it was intolerable to Felix to be witnessing the blind outrages of this mad crowd , and yet be doing nothing to counteract them . Even some vain effort would satisfy him better than mere gazing . Within the walls of the inn he might save some one . He went in with a miscellaneous set , who dispersed themselves with different objects — some to the taproom , and to search for the cellar ; some up - stairs to search in all rooms for Spratt , or any one else perhaps , as a temporary scapegoat for Spratt . Guided by the screams of women , Felix at last got to a high upstairs passage , where the landlady and some of her servants were running away in helpless terror from two or three half - tipsy men , who had been emptying a spirit - decanter in the bar . Assuming the tone of a mob - leader , he cried out , "
143866	144050	143864	143864	me	0	" and drew the men back with him along the passage . They reaclied the lower staircase in time to see the unhappy Spratt being dragged , coatless and screaming , down the steps . No one at present was striking or kicking him ; it seemed as if he were being reserved for punishment on some wider area , where the satisfaction might be more generally shared . Felix followed close , determined , if he could , to rescue both assailers and assaulted from the worst consequences . His mind was busy with possible devices . Down the stairs , out along the stones through the gateway , Spratt was dragged as a mere heap of linen and cloth rags . When he was got outside the gateway , there was an immense hooting and roaring , though many there had no grudge against him , and only guessed that others had the grudge . But this was the narrower part of the street ; it widened as it went onwards , and Spratt was dragged on , his enemies crying , "
144064	144065	143864	143864	me	0	" "
144075	144081	143864	143864	me	0	" Felix heard another say . "
144096	144514	143864	143864	me	0	" Here were two hideous threats . In dragging Spratt onward the people were getting very near to the lane leading up to Tiliot 's . Felix kept as close as he could to the threatened victim . He had thrown away his own stick , and carried a bludgeon which had escaped from the hands of an invader at the Seven Stars ; his head was bare ; he looked , to undiscerning eyes , like a leading spirit of the mob . In this condition he was observed by several persons looking anxiously from their upper windows , and finally observed to push himself , by violent efforts , close behind the dragged man . Meanwhile the foremost among the constables , who , coming by the back way , had now reached the opening of Tiliot 's Lane , discerned that the crowd had a victim amongst them . One spirited fellow , named Tucker , who was a regular constable , feeling that no time was to be lost in meditation , called on his neighbour to follow him , and with the sabre that happened to be his weapon got a way for himself where he was not expected , by dint of quick resolution . At this moment Spratt had been let go — had been dropped , in fact , almost lifeless with terror , on the street stones , and the men round him had retreated for a little space , as if to amuse themselves with looking at him . Felix had taken his opportunity ; and seeing the first step towards a plan he was bent on , he sprang forward close to the cowering Spratt . As he did this , Tucker had cut his way to the spot , and imagining Felix to be the destined executioner of Spratt — for any discrimination of Tucker 's lay in his muscles rather than his eyes — he rushed up to Felix , meaning to collar him and throw him down . But Felix had rapid senses and quick thoughts ; he discrened the situation ; he chose between two evils . Quick as lightning he frustrated the constable , fell upon him , and tried to master his weapon . In the struggle , which was watched without interference , the constable fell undermost , and Felix got his weapon . He started up with the bare sabre in his hand . The crowd round him cried "
144517	144548	143864	143864	me	0	" with a sense that he was on their side against the constable . Tucker did not rise immediately ; but Felix did not imagine that he was much hurt . "
144554	144558	143864	143864	me	0	" said Felix . "
144572	145163	145164	145164	his	3603	" Felix was perfectly conscious that he was in the midst of a tangled business . But he had chiefly before his imagination the horrors that might come if the mass of wild chaotic desires and impulses around him were not diverted from any further attack on places where they would get in the midst of intoxicating and inflammable materials . It was not a moment in which a spirit like his could calculate the effect of misunderstanding as to himself : nature never makes men who are at once energetically sympathetic and minutely calculating . He believed he had the power , and he was resolved to try , to carry the dangerous mass out of mischief till the military came to awe them — which he supposed , from Mr Crowe 's announcement long ago , must be a near event . He was followed the more willingly , because Tiliot 's Lane was seen by the hindmost to be now defended by constables , some of whom had firearms ; and where there is no strong counter - movement , any proposition to do something unspecified stimulates stupid curiosity . To many of the Sproxton men who were within sight of him , Felix was known personally , and vaguely believed to be a man who meant many queer things , not at all of an everyday kind . Pressing along like a leader , with the sabre in his hand , and inviting them to bring on Spratt , there seemed a better reason for following him than for doing anything else . A man with a definite will and an energetic personality acts as a sort of flag to draw and bind together the foolish units of a mob . It was on this sort of influence over men whose mental state was a mere medley of appetites and confused impressions , that Felix had dared to count . He hurried them along with words of invitation , telling them to hold up Spratt and not drag him ; and those behind followed him , with a growing belief that he had some design worth knowing , while those in front were urged along partly by the same notion , partly by the sense that there was a motive in those behind them , not knowing what the motive was . It was that mixture of pushing forward and being pushed forward , which is a brief history of most human things . What Felix really intended to do , was to get the crowd by the nearest way out of the town , and induce them to skirt it on the north side with him , keeping up in them the idea that he was leading them to execute some stratagem by which they would surprise something worth attacking , and circumvent the constables who were defending the lanes . In the mean time he trusted that the soldiers would have arrived , and with this sort of mob , which was animated by no real political passion or fury against social distinctions , it was in the highest degree unlikely that there would be any resistance to a military force . The presence of fifty soldiers would probably be enough to scatter the rioting hundreds . How numerous the mob was , no one ever knew : many inhabitants afterwards were ready to swear that there must have been at least two thousand rioters . Felix knew he was incurring great risks ; but "
145169	145281	145164	145164	his	3603	" we hardly allow enough in common life for the results of that enkindled passionate enthusiasm which , under other conditions , makes world - famous deeds . He was making for a point where the street branched off on one side towards a speedy opening between hedgerows , on the other towards the shabby wideness of Pollard 's End . At this forking of the street there was a large space , in the centre of which there was a small stone platform , mounting by three steps , with an old green finger - post upon it . Felix went straight to this platform and stepped upon it , crying "
145284	145351	145164	145164	his	3603	" in a loud voice to the men behind and before him , and calling to those who held Spratt to bring him there . All came to a stand with faces towards the finger - post , and perhaps for the first time the extremities of the crowd got a definite idea that a man with a sabre in his hand was taking the command . "
145354	145373	145375	145375	anybody	777	" said Felix , when Spratt had been brought on to the stone platform , faint and trembling , "
145391	145449	145389	145389	me	0	" He drew out his own handkerchief , and two or three others were mustered and handed to him . He ordered them to be knotted together , while curious eyes were fixed on him . Was he going to have Spratt hanged ? Felix kept fast hold of his weapon , and ordered others to act . "
145483	145494	145389	145389	me	0	" When that was done , Felix said , imperatively , "
145526	145954	146503	146504	the soldiers	7847	" It was the best chance he could think of for saving Spratt 's life . And he succeeded . The pleasure of seeing the helpless man tied up sufficed for the moment , if there were any who had ferocity enough to count much on coming back to him . Nobody 's imagination represented the certainty that some one out of the houses at hand would soon come and untie him when he was left alone . And the rioters pushed up Park Street , a noisy stream , with Felix still in the midst of them , though he was labouring hard to get his way to the front . He wished to determine the course of the crowd along a by - road called Hobb 's Lane , which would have taken them to the other — the Duffield end of the town . He urged several of the men round him , one of whom was no less a person than the big Dredge , our old Sproxton acquaintance , to get forward , and be sure that all the fellows would go down the lane , else they would spoil sport . Hitherto Felix had been successful , and he had gone along with an unbroken impulse . But soon something occurred which brought with a terrible shock the sense that his plan might turn out to be as mad as all bold projects are seen to be when they have failed . Mingled with the more headlong and half - drunken crowd there were some sharp - visaged men who loved the irrationality of riots for something else than its own sake , and who at present were not so much the richer as they desired to be , for the pains they had taken in coming to the Treby election , induced by certain prognostics gathered at Duffield on the nomination - day that there might be the conditions favourable to that confusion which was always a harvest - time . It was known to some of these sharp men that Park Street led out towards the grand house of Treby Manor , which was as good — nay , better for their purpose than the bank . While Felix was entertaining his ardent purpose , these other sons of Adam were entertaining another ardent purpose of their peculiar sort , and the moment was come when they were to have their triumph . From the front ranks backward towards Felix there ran a new summons — a new invitation . "
145962	146497	146503	146504	the soldiers	7847	" From that moment Felix was powerless ; a new definite suggestion overrode his vaguer influence . There was a determined rush past Hobb 's Lane , and not down it . Felix was carried along too . He did not know whether to wish the contrary . Once on the road , out of the town , with openings into fields and with the wide park at hand , it would have been easy for him to liberate himself from the crowd . At first it seemed to him the better part to do this , and to get back to the town as fast as he could , in the hope of finding the military and getting a detachment to come and save the Manor . But he reflected that the course of the mob had been sufficiently seen , and that there were plenty of people in Park Street to carry the information faster than he could . It seemed more necessary that he should secure the presence of some help for the family at the Manor by going there himself . The Debarrys were not of the class he was wo nt to be anxious about ; but Felix Holt 's conscience was alive to the accusation that any danger they might be in now was brought on by a deed of his . In these moments of bitter vexation and disappointment , it did occur to him that very unpleasant consequences might be hanging over him of a kind quite different from inward dissatisfaction ; but it was useless now to think of averting such consequences . As he was pressed along with the multitude into Treby Park , his very movement seemed to him only an image of the day 's fatalities , in which the multitudinous small wickednesses of small selfish ends , really undirected towards any larger result , had issued in widely - shared mischief that might yet be hideous . The light was declining : already the candles shone through many windows of the Manor . Already the foremost part of the crowd had burst into the offices , and adroit men were busy in the right places to find plate , after setting others to force the butler into unlocking the cellars ; and Felix had only just been able to force his way on to the front terrace , with the hope of getting to the rooms where he would find the ladies of the household and comfort them with the assurance that rescue must soon come , when the sound of horses ' feet convinced him that the rescue was nearer than he had expected . Just as he heard the horses , he had approached the large window of a room , where a brilliant light suspended from the ceiling showed him a group of women clinging together in terror . Others of the crowd were pushing their way up the terrace - steps and gravel - slopes at various points . Hearing the horses , he kept his post in front of the window , and , motioning with his sabre , cried out to the on - comers , "
146507	146530	146503	146504	the soldiers	7847	" Some scrambled back , some paused automatically . The louder and louder sound of the hoofs changed its pace and distribution . "
146535	146570	146503	146504	the soldiers	7847	" Bang ! bang ! bang!—came deafening the ears of the men on the terrace . Before they had time or nerve to move , there was a rushing sound closer to them — again "
146573	146767	146768	146768	I	0	" a bullet whizzed , and passed through Felix Holt 's shoulder — the shoulder of the arm that held the naked weapon which shone in the light from the window . Felix fell . The rioters ran confusedly , like terrified sheep . Some of the soldiers , turning , drove them along with the flat of their swords . The greater difficulty was to clear the invaded offices . The Rector , who with another magistrate and several other gentlemen on horseback had accompanied the soldiers , now jumped on to the terrace , and hurried to the ladies of the family . Presently there was a group round Felix , who had fainted , and , reviving , had fainted again . He had had little food during the day , and had been overwrought . Two of the group were civilians , but only one of them knew Felix , the other being a magistrate not resident in Treby . The one who knew Felix was Mr John Johnson , whose zeal for the public peace had brought him from Duffield when he heard that the soldiers were summoned . "
146775	146780	146768	146768	I	0	" said Mr Johnson . "
146790	146967	146968	146970	Poor old fellow	3611	" It was a weary night ; and the next day , Felix , whose wound was declared trivial , was lodged in Loamford Jail . He was committed on three counts — for having assaulted a constable , for having committed manslaughter ( Tucker was dead from spinal concussion ) , and for having led a riotous onslaught on a dwelling - house . Four other men were committed : one of them for possessing himself of a gold cup with the Debarry arms on it ; the three others , one of whom was the collier Dredge , for riot and assault . That morning Treby town was no longer in terror ; but it was in much sadness . Other men , more innocent than the hated Spratt , were groaning under severe bodily injuries . And poor Tucker 's corpse was not the only one that had been lifted from the pavement . It is true that none grieved much for the other dead man , unless it be grief to say , "
146972	148241	148242	148243	Poor mother	3612	" He had been trampled upon , doubtless where he fell drunkenly , near the entrance of the Seven Stars . This second corpse was old Tommy Trounsem , the bill - sticker — otherwise Thomas Transome , the last of a very old family - line . A week after that Treby Riot , Harold Transome was at Transome Court . He had returned from a hasty visit to town , to keep his Christmas at this delightful country home , not in the best Christmas spirits . He had lost the election ; but if that had been his only annoyance , he had good humour and good sense enough to have borne it as well as most men , and to have paid the eight or nine thousand , which had been the price of ascertaining that he was not to sit in the next Parliament , without useless grumbling . But the disappointments of life can never , any more than its pleasures , be estimated singly ; and the healthiest and most agreeable of men is exposed to that coincidence of various vexations , each heightening the effect of the other , which may produce in him something corresponding to the spontaneous and externally unaccountable moodiness of the morbid and disagreeable . Harold might not have grieved much at a small riot in Treby , even if it had caused some expenses to fall on the county ; but the turn which the riot had actually taken , was a bitter morsel for rumination , on more grounds than one . However the disturbances had arisen and been aggravated — and probably no one knew the whole truth on these points — the conspicuous , gravest incidents had all tended to throw the blame on the Radical party , that is to say , on Transome and on Transome 's agents ; and so far the candidateship and its results had done Harold dishonour in the county : precisely the opposite effect to that which was a dear object of his ambition . More than this , Harold 's conscience was active enough to be very unpleasantly affected by what had befallen Felix Holt . His memory , always good , was particularly vivid in its retention of Felix Holt 's complaint to him about the treating of the Sproxton men , and of the subsequent irritating scene in Jermyn 's office , when the personage with the inauspicious name of Johnson had expounded to him the impossibility of revising an electioneering scheme once begun , and of turning your vehicle back when it had already begun to roll downhill . Remembering Felix Holt 's words of indignant warning about hiring men with drink in them to make a noise , Harold could not resist the urgent impression that the offences for which Felix was committed were fatalities , not brought about by any willing co - operation of his with the rioters , but arising probably from some ill - judged efforts to counteract their violence . And this impression , which insisted on growing into a conviction , became in one of its phases an uneasy sense that he held evidence which would at once tend to exonerate Felix , and to place himself and his agents in anything but a desirable light . It was likely that some one else could give equivalent evidence in favour of Felix — the little talkative Dissenting preacher , for example ; but , anyhow , the affair with the Sproxton men would be ripped open and made the worst of by the opposite parties . The man who has failed in the use of some indirectness , is helped very little by the fact that his rivals are men to whom that indirectness is a something human , very far from being alien . There remains this grand distinction , that he has failed , and that the jet of light is thrown entirely on his misdoings . In this matter Harold felt himself a victim . Could he hinder the tricks of his agents ? In this particular case he had tried to hinder them , and had tried in vain . He had not loved the two agents in question , to begin with ; and now at this later stage of events he was more innocent than ever of bearing them anything but the most sincere ill - will . He was more utterly exasperated with them than he would probably have been if his one great passion had been for public virtue . Jermyn , with his John Johnson , had added this ugly dirty business of the Treby election to all the long - accumulating list of offences , which Harold was resolved to visit on him to the utmost . He had seen some handbills carrying the insinuation that there was a discreditable indebtedness to Jermyn on the part of the Transomes . If any such notions existed apart from electioneering slander , there was all the more reason for letting the world see Jermyn severely punished for abusing his power over the family affairs , and tampering with the family property . And the world certainly should see this with as little delay as possible . The cool confident assuming fellow should be bled to the last drop in compensation , and all connection with him be finally got rid of . Now that the election was done with , Harold meant to devote himself to private affairs , till everything lay in complete order under his own supervision . This morning he was seated as usual in his private room , which had now been handsomely fitted up for him . It was but the third morning after the first Christmas he had spent in his English home for fifteen years , and the home looked like an eminently desirable one . The white frost lay on the broad lawn , on the many - formed leaves of the evergreens , and on the giant trees at a distance . Logs of dry oak blazed on the hearth ; the carpet was like warm moss under his feet ; he had breakfasted just according to his taste , and he had the interesting occupations of a large proprietor to fill the morning . All through the house now , steps were noiseless on carpets or on fine matting ; there was warmth in hall and corridors ; there were servants enough to do everything , and to do it at the right time . Skilful Dominic was always at hand to meet his master 's demands , and his bland presence diffused itself like a smile over the household , infecting the gloomy English mind with the belief that life was easy , and making his real predominance seem as soft and light as a down quilt . Old Mr Transome had gathered new courage and strength since little Harry and Dominic had come , and since Harold had insisted on his taking drives . Mrs Transome herself was seen on a fresh background with a gown of rich new stuff . And if , in spite of this , she did not seem happy , Harold either did not observe it , or kindly ignored it as the necessary frailty of elderly women whose lives have had too much of dulness and privation . Our minds get tricks and attitudes as our bodies do , thought Harold , and age stiffens them into unalterableness . "
148347	148882	149114	149114	him	468	" And certainly Transome Court was now such a home as many women would covet . Yet even Harold 's own satisfaction in the midst of its elegant comfort needed at present to be sustained by the expectation of gratified resentment . He was obviously less bright and enjoying than usual , and his mother , who watched him closely without daring to ask questions , had gathered hints and drawn inferences enough to make her feel sure that there was some storm gathering between him and Jermyn . She did not dare to ask questions , and yet she had not resisted the temptation to say something bitter about Harold 's failure to get returned as a Radical , helping , with feminine self - defeat , to exclude herself more completely from any consultation by him . In this way poor women , whose power lies solely in their influence , make themselves like music out of tune , and only move men to run away . This morning Harold had ordered his letters to be brought to him at the breakfast - table , which was not his usual practice . His mother could see that there were London business letters about which he was eager , and she had found out that the letter brought by a clerk the day before was to make an appointment with Harold for Jermyn to come to Transome Court at eleven this morning . She observed Harold swallow his coffee and push away his plate with an early abstraction from the business of breakfast which was not at all after his usual manner . She herself ate nothing ; her sips of tea seemed to excite her ; her cheeks flushed , and her hands were cold . She was still young and ardent in her terrors ; the passions of the past were living in her dread . When Harold left the table she went into the long drawing - room , where she might relieve her restlessness by walking up and down , and catch the sound of Jermyn 's entrance into Harold 's room , which was close by . Here she moved to and fro amongst the rose - coloured satin of chairs and curtains — the great story of this world reduced for her to the little tale of her own existence — dull obscurity everywhere , except where the keen light fell on the narrow track of her own lot , wide only for a woman 's anguish . At last she heard the expected ring and footstep , and the opening and closing door . Unable to walk about any longer , she sank into a large cushioned chair , helpless and prayerless . She was not thinking of God 's anger or mercy , but of her son 's . She was thinking of what might be brought , not by death , but by life . When Jermyn entered the room , Harold , who was seated at his library table examining papers , with his back towards the light and his face towards the door , moved his head coldly . Jermyn said an ungracious "
148885	149052	149114	149114	him	468	morning,"—as little as possible like a salutation to one who might regard himself as a patron . On the attorney 's handsome face there was a black cloud of defiant determination , slightly startling to Harold , who had expected to feel that the overpowering weight of temper in the interview was on his own side . Nobody was ever prepared beforehand for this expression of Jermyn 's face , which seemed as strongly contrasted with the cold impenetrableness which he preserved under the ordinary annoyances of business as with the bland radiance of his lighter moments . Harold himself did not look amiable just then , but his anger was of the sort that seeks a vent without waiting to give a fatal blow ; it was that of a nature more subtly mixed than Jermyn's — less animally forcible , less unwavering in selfishness , and with more of high - bred pride . He looked at Jermyn with increased disgust and secret wonder . "
149056	149082	149114	149114	him	468	" he said , curtly . Jermyn seated himself in silence , opened his greatcoat , and took some papers from a side - pocket . "
149089	149093	149114	149114	him	468	" said Harold , "
149116	149117	149108	149108	you	468	" "
149130	149131	149121	149121	I	0	" "
149190	149191	149178	149178	they	4941	" "
149214	149239	149205	149205	you	0	" ( When Jermyn had the black cloud over his face , he never hesitated or drawled , and made no Latin quotations . ) "
149254	149265	149205	149205	you	0	" said Harold , in a tone of imperious indifference . "
149296	149318	149284	149284	you	0	" Jermyn , as he spoke , laid his hand on the papers before him , and looked straight at Harold . "
149354	149355	149346	149346	you	0	" "
149372	149406	149407	149407	I	0	" The tone in which Jermyn said this gave an unpleasant shock to Harold 's sense of mastery . Was it possible that he should have the weapon wrenched out of his hand ? "
149416	149425	149407	149407	I	0	" he replied , as haughtily as ever , "
149435	149436	149427	149427	you	0	" "
149461	149462	149463	149463	I	0	" "
149492	149503	149472	149472	your	0	" said Harold , feeling a new movement of anger . "
149521	149522	149519	149519	Halliwell	470	" "
149577	149593	149596	149596	you	0	" Jermyn paused , as if to leave time for this morsel to be tasted . "
149599	149605	149596	149596	you	0	" said Harold , sharply . "
149664	149665	149667	149667	you	0	" "
149673	149674	149667	149667	you	0	" "
149738	149779	149780	149780	I	0	" Jermyn paused again . He had been speaking slowly , but without the least hesitation , and with a bitter definiteness of enunciation . There was a moment or two before Harold answered , and then he said abruptly , "
149786	149787	149780	149780	I	0	" "
149795	149805	149790	149790	you	0	" said Jermyn , with a touch of scorn . "
149840	149841	149831	149831	himself	3632	" "
149854	149868	149850	149850	your	0	" said Harold , shaking in spite of himself , and getting nervous . "
149949	149950	150021	150021	He	3638	" "
149956	150000	150021	150021	He	3638	" said Harold , rising from his chair , and making a turn in the room , with his hands thrust in his pockets . Jermyn rose too , and stood near the hearth facing Harold , as he moved to and fro . "
150129	150178	150112	150112	I	0	" For a minute or two Harold did not speak , but continued to pace the room , while Jermyn kept his position , holding his hands behind him . At last Harold said , from the other end of the room , speaking in a scornful tone , "
150195	150196	150192	150192	your	0	" "
150247	150278	150279	150279	You	0	" Jermyn took up the papers he had laid on the table , opening them slowly and coolly as he went on speaking , and as Harold advanced towards him . "
150361	150477	150352	150352	you	0	" Jermyn ended , holding out one of the papers to Harold , and pointing to a final passage . Harold took the paper , with a slight gesture of impatience . He did not choose to obey Jermyn 's indication , and confine himself to the summing - up . He ran through the document . But in truth he was too much excited really to follow the details , and was rather acting than reading , till at length he threw himself into his chair and consented to bend his attention on the passage to which Jermyn had pointed . The attorney watched him as he read and twice re - read : — "
150596	150616	150639	150640	Thomas Transome	305	" When Harold 's eyes were on the signatures to this document for the third time , Jermyn said , "
150744	150766	150734	150734	I	0	" Harold rose from his chair again , and again paced the room . He was not prepared with any defiance . "
150775	150792	150770	150770	he	305	" he said at last , stopping in his walk , and facing round towards Jermyn . "
150807	150855	150799	150799	you	3653	" Harold turned again , and looked out of the window , without speaking for a moment or two . It was impossible that there should not be a conflict within him , and at present it was a very confused one . At last he said , "
150865	150866	150856	150857	This person	3656	" "
150869	150870	150856	150857	This person	3656	" "
150880	150881	150856	150857	This person	3656	" "
150884	150903	150856	150857	This person	3656	" said Jermyn , keen enough to guess part of what was going on in Harold 's mind . "
150969	150970	150967	150967	you	3653	" "
150980	150990	150971	150971	I	0	" said Harold , conscious of a terrible pressure . "
151005	151006	150998	150998	you	3653	" "
151023	151024	151015	151015	you	3653	" "
151082	151083	151086	151086	I	0	" "
151091	151122	151086	151086	I	0	" said Harold , more than ever inclined to thrash the attorney , but feeling bound hand and foot with knots that he was not sure he could ever unfasten . "
151128	151139	151140	151140	you	0	" said Jermyn , with his black - browed persistence , "
151147	151239	151240	151240	I	0	" Again Harold paused . He was more than ever exasperated , but he was threatened , mortified , and confounded by the necessity for an immediate decision between alternatives almost equally hateful to him . It was with difficulty that he could prevail on himself to speak any conclusive words . He walked as far as he could from Jermyn — to the other end of the room — then walked back to his chair and threw himself into it . At last he said , without looking at Jermyn , "
151248	151249	151243	151243	I	0	" "
151258	151259	151240	151240	I	0	" "
151265	151275	151240	151240	I	0	" said Harold , hastily , flashing a look at Jermyn—"no
151293	151294	151287	151287	I	0	" "
151337	151509	151510	151510	Men	639	" Harold did not speak to him or look at him again , and Jermyn walked out of the room . As he appeared outside the door and closed it behind him , Mrs Transome showed her white face at another door which opened on a level with Harold 's in such a way that it was just possible for Jermyn not to see her . He availed himself of that possibility , and walked straight across the hall , where there was no servant in attendance to let him out , as if he believed that no one was looking at him who could expect recognition . He did not want to speak to Mrs Transome at present ; he had nothing to ask from her , and one disagreeable interview had been enough for him this morning . She was convinced that he had avoided her , and she was too proud to arrest him . She was as insignificant now in his eyes as in her son 's . "
151518	152665	152666	152667	Meester Chreestian	472	" she said to herself , bitterly . Turning into her sitting - room , she heard the voices of Mr Transome and little Harry at play together . She would have given a great deal at this moment if her feeble husband had not always lived in dread of her temper and her tyranny , so that he might have been fond of her now . She felt herself loveless ; if she was important to any one , it was only to her old waiting - woman Denner . Shakspeare : Henry IV . Few men would have felt otherwise than Harold Transome felt , if , having a reversion tantamount to possession of a fine estate , carrying an association with an old name and considerable social importance , they were suddenly informed that there was a person who had a legal right to deprive them of these advantages ; that person 's right having never been contemplated by any one as more than a chance , and being quite unknown to himself . In ordinary cases a shorter possession than Harold 's family had enjoyed was allowed by the law to constitute an indefeasible right ; and if in rare and peculiar instances the law left the possessor of a long inheritance exposed to deprivation as a consequence of old obscure transactions , the moral reasons for giving legal validity to the title of long occupancy were not the less strong . Nobody would have said that Harold was bound to hunt out this alleged remainder - man and urge his rights upon him ; on the contrary , all the world would have laughed at such conduct , and he would have been thought an interesting patient for a mad - doctor . The unconscious remainder - man was probably much better off left in his original station : Harold would not have been called upon to consider his existence , if it had not been presented to him in the shape of a threat from one who had power to execute the threat . In fact , what he would have done had the circumstances been different was much clearer than what he should choose to do or feel himself compelled to do in the actual crisis . He would not have been disgraced if , on a valid claim being urged , he had got his lawyers to fight it out for him on the chance of eluding the claim by some adroit technical management . Nobody off the stage could be sentimental about these things , or pretend to shed tears of joy because an estate was handed over from a gentleman to a mendicant sailor with a wooden leg . And this chance remainder - man was perhaps some such specimen of inheritance as the drunken fellow killed in the riot . All the world would think the actual Transomes in the right to contest any adverse claim to the utmost . But then — it was not certain that they would win in the contest ; and not winning , they would incur other loss besides that of the estate . There had been a little too much of such loss already . But why , if it were not wrong to contest the claim , should he feel the most uncomfortable scruples about robbing the claim of its sting by getting rid of its evidence ? It was a mortal disappointment — it was a sacrifice of indemnification — to abstain from punishing Jermyn . But even if he brought his mind to contemplate that as the wiser course , he still shrank from what looked like complicity with Jermyn ; he still shrank from the secret nullification of a just legal claim . If he had only known the details , if he had known who this alleged heir was , he might have seen his way to some course that would not have grated on his sense of honour and dignity . But Jermyn had been too acute to let Harold know this : he had even carefully kept to the masculine pronoun . And he believed that there was no one besides himself who would or could make Harold any wiser . He went home persuaded that between this interview and the next which they would have together , Harold would be left to an inward debate , founded entirely on the information he himself had given . And he had not much doubt that the result would be what he desired . Harold was no fool : there were many good things he liked better in life than an irrational vindictiveness . And it did happen that , after writing to London in fulfilment of his pledge , Harold spent many hours over that inward debate , which was not very different from what Jermyn imagined . He took it everywhere with him , on foot and on horseback , and it was his companion through a great deal of the night . His nature was not of a kind given to internal conflict , and he had never before been long undecided and puzzled . This unaccustomed state of mind was so painfully irksome to him — he rebelled so impatiently against the oppression of circumstances in which his quick temperament and habitual decision could not help him — that it added tenfold to his hatred of Jermyn , who was the cause of it . And thus , as the temptation to avoid all risk of losing the estate grew and grew till scruples looked minute by the side of it , the difficulty of bringing himself to make a compact with Jermyn seemed more and more insurmountable . But we have seen that the attorney was much too confident in his calculations . And while Harold was being galled by his subjection to Jermyn 's knowledge , independent information was on its way to him . The messenger was Christian , who , after as complete a survey of probabilities as he was capable of , had come to the conclusion that the most profitable investment he could make of his peculiar experience and testimony in relation to Bycliffe and Bycliffe 's daughter , was to place them at the disposal of Harold Transome . He was afraid of Jermyn ; he utterly distrusted Johnson ; but he thought he was secure in relying on Harold Transome 's care for his own interest ; and he preferred above all issues the prospect of forthwith leaving the country with a sum that at least for a good while would put him at his ease . When , only three mornings after the interview with Jermyn , Dominic opened the door of Harold 's sitting - room , and said that "
152669	152847	152666	152667	Meester Chreestian	472	" Mr Philip Debarry 's courier and an acquaintance of his own at Naples , requested to be admitted on business of importance , Harold 's immediate thought was that the business referred to the so - called political affairs which were just now his chief association with the name of Debarry , though it seemed an oddness requiring explanation that a servant should be personally an intermediary . He assented , expecting something rather disagreeable than otherwise . Christian wore this morning those perfect manners of a subordinate who is not servile , which he always adopted towards his unquestionable superiors . Mr Debarry , who preferred having some one about him with as little resemblance as possible to a regular servant , had a singular liking for the adroit , quiet - mannered Christian , and would have been amazed to see the insolent assumption he was capable of in the presence of people like Mr Lyon , who were of no account in society . Christian had that sort of cleverness which is said to "
152850	152895	152896	152896	You	3660	world"—that is to say , he knew the price - current of most things . Aware that he was looked at as a messenger while he remained standing near the door with his hat in his hand , he said , with respectful ease , "
152949	152950	152951	152951	You	5093	" "
152961	152969	152972	152972	sir	5093	" said Harold , with some surprise . "
152990	152991	152974	152974	My	0	" "
153002	153022	153025	153025	sir	5093	" said Harold , rather suspiciously , having no ground for confidence in a man of Christian 's position . "
153053	153054	153043	153044	Mr Jermyn	169	" "
153060	153080	153043	153044	Mr Jermyn	169	" said Harold , something like a gleam passing over his face . His circulation had become more rapid . "
153091	153092	153084	153084	you	5093	" "
153107	153108	153103	153103	he	169	" "
153116	153120	153103	153103	he	169	" Christian thought , "
153136	153142	153134	153134	you	5093	" He said , aloud , "
153186	153187	153157	153157	he	169	" "
153190	153267	153157	153157	he	169	" said Harold , starting up , and placing himself with his back against the mantelpiece . He was electrified by surprise at the quarter from which this information was coming . Any fresh alarm was counteracted by the flashing thought that he might be enabled to act independently of Jermyn ; and in the rush of feelings he could utter no more than an interjection . Christian concluded that Harold had had no previous hint . "
153283	153284	153276	153276	I	0	" "
153297	153309	153294	153294	I	0	" said Harold , with a slight approach to a smile . "
153312	153328	153329	153329	I	0	" said Christian , as quietly as if he had been stating yesterday 's weather . "
153406	153482	153394	153394	you	5093	" Harold listened as if he had been a legendary hero , selected for peculiar solicitation by the Evil One . Here was temptation in a more alluring form than before , because it was sweetened by the prospect of eluding Jermyn . But the desire to gain time served all the purposes of caution and resistance , and his indifference to the speaker in this case helped him to preserve perfect self - command . "
153487	153493	153394	153394	you	5093	" he said , coolly , "
153544	153545	153529	153529	they	3671	" "
153555	153556	153546	153546	You	5093	" "

153764	153789	153790	153791	This fellow	2258	" burst out Harold , throwing himself into his chair again , and turning his shoulder towards Christian . New thoughts crowded upon him . "
153802	153808	153790	153791	This fellow	2258	" he said to himself . "
153850	153862	153863	153863	I	0	" Thus the outside conscience came in aid of the inner . "
153874	153880	153863	153863	I	0	" he said , resolutely , "
153964	154224	154225	154225	I	0	" Christian felt himself caught in a vice . In the first instance he had counted confidently on Harold 's ready seizure of his offer to disappear , and after some words had seemed to cast a doubt on this presupposition , he had inwardly determined to go away , whether Harold wished it or not , if he could get a sufficient sum . He did not reply immediately , and Harold waited in silence , inwardly anxious to know what Christian could tell , but with a vision at present so far cleared that he was determined not to risk incurring the imputation of having anything to do with scoundrelism . We are very much indebted to such a linking of events as makes a doubtful action look wrong . Christian was reflecting that if he stayed , and faced some possible inconveniences of being known publicly as Henry Scaddon for the sake of what he might get from Esther , it would at least be wise to be certain of some money from Harold Transome , since he turned out to be of so peculiar a disposition as to insist on a punctilious honesty to his own disadvantage . Did he think of making a bargain with the other side ? If so , he might be content to wait for the knowledge till it came in some other way . Christian was beginning to be afraid lest he should get nothing by this clever move of coming to Transome Court . At last he said , "
154243	154244	154245	154245	I	0	" "

154389	154404	154382	154382	I	0	" said Harold , immediately , for Christian had unconsciously touched a sure spring . "
154421	154436	154408	154408	I	0	" He wrote as he had promised , and gave the paper to Christian . "
154444	154448	154449	154449	You	5093	" said Harold . "

154508	154548	154553	154554	Old Lyon	473	" said Harold . At once , the first occasion on which he had seen Esther rose in his memory — the little dark parlour — the graceful girl in blue , with the surprisingly distinguished manners and appearance . "
154621	154622	154626	154626	her	6729	" "
154628	154642	154623	154623	I	0	" said Harold , more than ever glad to have purchased this knowledge . "
154649	154676	154626	154626	her	6729	" Christian proceeded to tell all he knew , including his conversation with Jermyn , except so far as it had an unpleasant relation to himself . "
154679	154694	154695	154695	you	0	" said Harold , as the details seemed to have come to a close , "
154724	154725	154726	154726	I	0	" "

154793	154799	154790	154791	Mr Jermyn	169	" Christian was dismissed with a "
154804	155026	155028	155030	a marrying man	3698	" and while he cultivated some friendly reminiscences with Dominic , Harold sat chewing the cud of his new knowledge , and finding it not altogether so bitter as he had expected . From the first , after his interview with Jermyn , the recoil of Harold 's mind from the idea of strangling a legal right threw him on the alternative of attempting a compromise . Some middle course might be possible , which would be a less evil than a costly lawsuit , or than the total renunciation of the estates . And now he had learned that the new claimant was a woman — a young woman , brought up under circumstances that would make the fourth of the Transome property seem to her an immense fortune . Both the sex and the social condition were of the sort that lies open to many softening influences . And having seen Esther , it was inevitable that , amongst the various issues , agreeable and disagreeable , depicted by Harold 's imagination , there should present itself a possibility that would unite the two claims — his own , which he felt to be the rational , and Esther 's , which apparently was the legal claim . Harold , as he had constantly said to his mother , was "
155032	155898	155028	155030	a marrying man	3698	" he did not contemplate bringing a wife to Transome Court for many years to come , if at all . Having little Harry as an heir , he preferred freedom . Western women were not to his taste : they showed a transition from the feebly animal to the thinking being , which was simply troublesome . Harold preferred a slow - witted large - eyed woman , silent and affectionate , with a load of black hair weighing much more heavily than her brains . He had seen no such woman in England , except one whom he had brought with him from the East . Therefore Harold did not care to be married until or unless some surprising chance presented itself ; and now that such a chance had occurred to suggest marriage to him , he would not admit to himself that he contemplated marrying Esther as a plan ; he was only obliged to see that such an issue was not inconceivable . He was not going to take any step expressly directed towards that end : what he had made up his mind to , as the course most satisfactory to his nature under present urgencies , was to behave to Esther with a frank gentlemanliness , which must win her good - will , and incline her to save his family interest as much as possible . He was helped to this determination by the pleasure of frustrating Jermyn 's contrivance to shield himself from punishment ; and his most distinct and cheering prospect was , that within a very short space of time he should not only have effected a satisfactory compromise with Esther , but should have made Jermyn aware , by a very disagreeable form of announcement , that Harold Transome was no longer afraid of him . Jermyn should bite the dust . At the end of these meditations he felt satisfied with himself and light - hearted . He had rejected two dishonest propositions , and he was going to do something that seemed eminently graceful . But he needed his mother 's assistance , and it was necessary that he should both confide in her and persuade her . Within two hours after Christian left him , Harold begged his mother to come into his private room , and there he told her the strange and startling story , omitting , however , any particulars which would involve the identification of Christian as his informant . Harold felt that his engagement demanded this reticence ; and he told his mother that he was bound to conceal the source of that knowledge which he had got independently of Jermyn . Mrs Transome said little in the course of the story : she made no exclamations , but she listened with close attention , and asked a few questions so much to the point as to surprise Harold . When he showed her the copy of the legal opinion which Jermyn had left with him , she said she knew it very well ; she had a copy herself . The particulars of that last lawsuit were too well engraven on her mind : it happened at a time when there was no one to supersede her , and she was the virtual head of the family affairs . She was prepared to understand how the estate might be in danger ; but nothing had prepared her for the strange details — for the way in which the new claimant had been reared and brought within the range of converging motives that had led to this revelation , least of all for the part Jermyn had come to play in the revelation . Mrs Transome saw these things through the medium of certain dominant emotions that made them seem like a long - ripening retribution . Harold perceived that she was painfully agitated , that she trembled , and that her white lips would not readily lend themselves to speech . And this was hardly more than he expected . He had not liked the revelation himself when it had first come to him . But he did not guess what it was in his narrative which had most pierced his mother . It was something that made the threat about the estate only a secondary alarm . Now , for the first time , she heard of the intended proceedings against Jermyn . Harold had not chosen to speak of them before ; but having at last called his mother into consultation , there was nothing in his mind to hinder him from speaking without reserve of his determination to visit on the attorney his shameful maladministration of the family affairs . Harold went through the whole narrative — of what he called Jermyn 's scheme to catch him in a vice , and his power of triumphantly frustrating that scheme — in his usual rapid way , speaking with a final decisiveness of tone : and his mother felt that if she urged any counter - consideration at all , she could only do so when he had no more to say . "
155921	155927	155911	155911	you	3699	" Harold said in conclusion , "

156015	156044	156045	156045	I	0	" said Mrs Transome , with difficulty . It would have seemed the bitterest humiliating penance if another sort of suffering had left any room in her heart . "
156086	156087	156081	156081	you	3699	" "
156090	156101	156081	156081	you	3699	" said Mrs Transome , with low - toned bitterness , "
156122	156123	156142	156142	We	3705	" "
156126	156135	156142	156142	We	3705	" said Harold , looking at his watch , "

156173	156183	156163	156163	I	0	" said Mrs Transome , making a desperate effort . "
156202	156219	156195	156195	I	0	" Harold withdrew his hand from the bell , and leaned against the mantelpiece to listen . "
156232	156233	156236	156236	mother	4844	" "
156249	156250	156251	156251	You	3699	" "
156260	156261	156251	156251	You	3699	" "
156275	156288	156268	156268	Harold	145	" What is the good of having these Chancery proceedings against Jermyn ? "
156289	156459	156251	156251	You	3699	" Good ? This good : that fellow has burdened the estate with annuities and mortgages to the extent of three thousand a - year ; and bulk of them , I am certain , he holds himself under the name of another man . And the advances this yearly interest represents , have not been much more than twenty thousand . Of course he has hoodwinked you , and my father never gave attention to these things . He has been up to all sorts of devil 's work with the deeds ; he did n't count on my coming back from Smyrna to fill poor Durfey 's place . He shall feel the difference . And the good will be , that I shall save almost all the annuities for the rest of my father 's life , which may be ten years or more , and I shall get back some of the money , and I shall punish a scoundrel . That is the good . "
156460	156466	156268	156268	Harold	145	" He will be ruined . "
156467	156474	156476	156476	Harold	145	" That 's what I intend , "
156480	156504	156506	156507	Mrs Transome	145	" He exerted himself a great deal for us in the old suits : every one said he had wonderful zeal and ability , "
156523	156541	156543	156543	Harold	145	" What he did , he did for his own sake , you may depend on that , "
156550	156618	156543	156543	Harold	145	" There were very painful things in that last suit . You seem anxious , about this young woman , to avoid all further scandal and contests in the family . Why do n't you wish to do it in this case ? Jermyn might be willing to arrange things amicably — to make restitution as far as he can — if he has done anything worng . "
156619	156628	156630	156630	Harold	145	" I will arrange nothing amicably with him , "
156634	156726	156630	156630	Harold	145	" If he has ever done anything scandalous as our agent , let him bear the infamy . And the right way to throw the infamy on him is to show the world that he has robbed us , and that I mean to punish him . Why do you wish to shield such a fellow , mother ? It has been chiefly through him that you have had to lead such a thrifty miserable life — you who used to make as brilliant a figure as a woman need wish . "
156812	156822	156824	156824	Harold	145	" Women are frightened at everything , I know , "
156842	156864	156865	156865	he	3709	" And you have been used for so many years to think Jermyn a law of nature . Come , mother , "
156882	156945	156865	156865	he	3709	" look cheerful . We shall get through all these difficulties . And this girl — I daresay she will be quite an interesting visitor for you . You have not had any young girl about you for a long while . Who knows ? she may fall deeply in love with me , and I may be obliged to marry her . "
156969	156977	156961	156961	she	145	" Do you mean that , Harold ? "
156978	157005	156961	156961	she	145	" Am I not capable of making a conquest ? Not too fat yet — a handsome , well - rounded youth of thirty - four ? "
157084	157089	157091	157091	Harold	145	" There , there ! "
157095	157125	157091	157091	Harold	145	" Do n't be afraid . You shall not have a daughter - in - law unless she is a pearl . Now we will get ready to go . "
157149	157156	157133	157134	Mrs Transome	145	" the girl in Malthouse Yard . "
157491	157512	157513	157513	he	201	" My poor young friend is being taught with mysterious severity the evil of a too confident self - reliance , "
157531	157541	157513	157513	he	201	" You will go and see him , father ? "
157542	157580	157581	157582	Mr Lyon	201	" Verily will I. But I must straightway go and see that poor afflicted woman , whose soul is doubt - less whirled about in this trouble like a shapeless and unstable thing driven by divided winds . "
157610	157624	157626	157626	Esther	208	" Stay , father , pray , till you have had some food , "
157635	157643	157626	157626	Esther	208	" You look quite weary and shattered . "
157644	157726	157629	157629	her	208	" Child , I can not stay . I can neither eat bread nor drink water till I have learned more about this young man 's deeds , what can be proved and what can not be proved against him . I fear he has none to stand by him in this town , for even by the friends of our church I have been ofttimes rebuked because he seemed dear to me . But , Esther , my beloved child — "
157747	157902	157903	157904	The minister	1401	" I bear in mind this : the Lord knoweth them that are His ; but we — we are left to judge by uncertain signs , that so we may learn to exercise hope and faith towards one another ; and in this uncertainty I cling with awful hope to those whom the world loves not because their conscience , albeit mistakenly , is at war with the habits of the world . Our great faith , my Esther , is the faith of martyrs : I will not lightly turn away from any man who endures harshness because he will not lie ; nay , though I would not wantonly grasp at ease of mind through an arbitrary choice of doctrine , I can not but believe that the merits of the Divine Sacrifice are wider than our utmost charity . I once believed otherwise — but not now , not now . "
158172	158179	158181	158183	the poor woman	3732	" And now , Mr Lyon , "
158223	158401	158213	158213	she	3732	" and now you see — my words have come true sooner than I thought they would . Felix may contradict me if he will ; but there he is in prison , and here am I , with nothing in the world to bless myself with but half - a - crown a - week as I 've saved by my own scraping , and this house I 've got to pay rent for . It 's not me has done wrong , Mr Lyon ; there 's nobody can say it of me — not the orphin child on my knee is more innicent o ' riot and murder and anything else as is bad . But when you 've got a son so masterful and stopping medicines as Providence has sent , and his betters have been taking up and down the country since before he was a baby , it 's o ' no use being good here below . But he was a baby , Mr Lyon , and I gave him the breast,"—here
158423	158453	158422	158422	she	198	spoke—"And to think there 's folks saying now as he 'll be transported , and his hair shaved off , and the treadmill , and everything . O dear ! "
158495	158501	158503	158504	the minister	1401	" Nay , Mistress Holt , "
158507	158592	158503	158504	the minister	1401	" enlarge not your grief by more than warrantable grounds . I have good hope that my young friend your son will be delivered from any severe consequences beyond the death of the man Tucker , which I fear will ever be a sore burthen on his memory . I feel confident that a jury of his countrymen will discern between misfortune , or it may be misjudgment , and an evil will , and that he will be acquitted of any grave offence . "
158593	158605	158607	158608	Mrs Holt	198	" He never stole anything in his life , Mr Lyon , "
158612	158839	158607	158608	Mrs Holt	198	" Nobody can throw it in my face as my son ran away with money like the young man at the Bank — though he looked most respectable , and far different on a Sunday to what Felix ever did . And I know it 's very hard fighting with constables ; but they say Tucker 's wife'll be a deal better off than she was before , for the great folks'll pension her , and she 'll be put on all the charities , and her children at the Free School , and everything . Your trouble 's easy borne when everybody gives it a lift for you ; and if judge and jury wants to do right by Felix , they 'll think of his poor mother , with the bread took out of her mouth , all but half - a - crown a - week and furniture — which , to be sure , is most excellent , and of my own buying — and got to keep this orphin child as Felix himself brought on me . And I might send him back to his old grandfather on parish pay , but I 'm not that woman , Mr Lyon : I 've a tender heart . And here 's his little feet and toes , like marbil ; do but look "
158859	159007	158842	158843	Mrs Holt	198	foot—"and you 'll perhaps say I might take a lodger ; but it 's easy talking ; it is n't everybody at a loose - end wants a parlour and a bedroom ; and if anything bad happens to Felix , I may as well go and sit in the parish Pound , and nobody to buy me out ; for it 's beyond everything how the church members find fault with my son . But I think they might leave his mother to find fault ; for queer and masterful he might be , and flying in the face of the very Scripture about the physic , but he was most clever beyond anything — that I will say — and was his own father 's lawful child , and me his mother , that was Mary Wall thirty years before ever I married his father . "
159029	159088	159021	159021	she	198	" And if they 're to transport him , I should like to go to the prison and take the orphin child ; for he was most fond of having him on his lap , and said he 'd never marry ; and there was One above overheard him , for he 's been took at his word . "
159336	159340	159330	159330	He	201	" the cause ; "
159431	159439	159441	159442	Mr Muscat	213	" turn it which way you would , "
159829	159832	159817	159817	he	3720	" the cause "
160181	160196	160198	160198	Esther	208	" Then he is not so much cast down as you feared , father ? "
160200	160312	160198	160198	Esther	208	" No , child ; albeit he is pale and much shaken for one so stalwart . He hath no grief , he says , save for the poor man Tucker , and for his mother ; otherwise his heart is without a burthen . We discoursed greatly on the sad effect of all this for his mother , and on the perplexed condition of human things , whereby even right action seems to bring evil consequences , if we have respect only to our own brief lives , and not to that larger rule whereby we are stewards of the eternal dealings , and not contrivers of our own success . "
160313	160323	160325	160325	Esther	208	" Did he say nothing about me , father ? "
160338	160436	160325	160325	Esther	208	" Yea ; he asked if you were well , and sent his affectionate regards . Nay , he bade me say something which appears to refer to your discourse together when I was not present . ' Tell her , ' he said , ' whatever they sentence me to , she knows they ca n't rob me of my vocation . With poverty for my bride , and preaching and pedagoguy for my business , I am sure of a handsome establishment . ' He laughed — doubtless bearing in mind some playfulness of thine . "
160890	160926	160860	160860	He	201	" a young Ishmaelite , whom we would fain see brought back from the lawless life of the desert , and seated in the same fold even with the sons of Judah and of Benjamin , "
161017	161022	161023	161023	she	198	" given in to , "
161427	161452	161421	161422	Mr Lyon	201	" This , then , is what the man named Christian referred to . I distrusted him , yet it seems he spoke truly . "
161453	161456	161458	161458	Esther	208	" But , "
161475	161506	161458	161458	Esther	208	" do they mean that the Transomes would be turned out of Transome Court , and that I should go and live there ? It seems quite an impossible thing . "
161507	161581	161458	161458	Esther	208	" Nay , child , I know not . I am ignorant in these things , and the thought of worldly grandeur for you hath more of terror than of gladness for me . Nevertheless we must duly weigh all things , not considering aught that befalls us as a bare event , but rather as an occasion for faithful stewardship . Let us go to my study and consider this writing further . "
162861	162921	162922	162922	Her	208	" That is clearly your destiny — to be aristocratic , to be rich . I always saw that our lots lay widely apart . You are not fit for poverty , or any work of difficulty . But remember what I once said to you about a vision of consequences ; take care where your fortune leads you . "
163181	163189	163191	163191	Esther	208	" Yes , Lyddy , we come , "
163199	163214	163191	163191	Esther	208	" Is there any advice you have in your mind for me , father ? "
163253	163326	163243	163243	she	208	" Not yet , my dear — save this : that you will seek special illumination in this juncture , and , above all , be watchful that your soul be not lifted up within you by what , rightly considered , is rather an increase of charge , and a call upon you to walk along a path which is indeed easy to the flesh , but dangerous to the spirit . "
163327	163337	163338	163338	Esther	208	" You would always live with me , father ? "
163515	163558	163511	163511	He	1479	" Touch not that chord yet , child . I must learn to think of thy lot according to the demands of Providence . We will rest a while from the subject ; and I will seek calmness in my ordinary duties . "
163677	163684	163686	163687	a lady	1144	" all sorts of fine liveries , "
163710	163726	163728	163729	Mrs Holt	198	" If it 's Mr Transome or somebody else as is great , Mr Lyon , "
163731	163839	163728	163729	Mrs Holt	198	" you 'll remember my son , and say he 's got a mother with a character they may inquire into as much as they like . And never mind what Felix says , for he 's so masterful he 'd stay in prison and be transported whether or no , only to have his own way . For it 's not to be thought but what the great people could get him off if they would ; and it 's very hard with a King in the country and all the texts in Proverbs about the King 's countenance , and Solomon and the live baby — "
164242	164256	164257	164258	Mrs Transome	145	" You must be astonished at a visit from me , Miss Lyon , "
164261	164302	164257	164258	Mrs Transome	145	" I seldom come to Treby Magna . Now I see you , the visit is an unexpected pleasure ; but the cause of my coming is business of a serious nature , which my son will communicate to you . "
164303	164327	164329	164329	Harold	145	" I ought to begin by saying that what I have to announce to you is the reverse of disagreeable , Miss Lyon , "
164335	164359	164360	164360	Harold	145	" I do n't suppose the world would consider it very good news for me ; but a rejected candidate , Mr Lyon , "
164370	164380	164360	164360	Harold	145	" begins to be inured to loss and misfortune . "
164381	164386	164388	164389	Mr Lyon	201	" Truly , sir , "
164397	164419	164388	164389	Mr Lyon	201	" your allusion hath a grievous bearing for me , but I will not retard your present purpose by further remark . "
164420	164431	164433	164433	Harold	145	" You will never guess what I have to disclose , "
164440	164454	164433	164433	Harold	145	" unless , indeed , you have had some previous intimation of it . "
164455	164464	164466	164466	Esther	208	" Does it refer to law and inheritance ? "
164504	164513	164515	164515	Harold	145	" Then you have already heard of it ? "
164528	164532	164534	164534	Esther	208	" Only yesterday , "
164538	164559	164560	164560	she	208	" I received a letter from some lawyers with a statement of many surprising things , showing that I was an heiress"—here
164567	164588	164560	164560	she	208	Transome—"which , as you may imagine , is one of the last things I could have supposed myself to be . "
164589	164593	164595	164596	Mrs Transome	145	" My dear , "
164612	164623	164603	164603	her	145	" it is a lot that would become you admirably . "
164631	164656	164624	164624	Esther	208	" O , I know what to buy with fifty pounds a - year , but I know the price of nothing beyond that . "
164692	164698	164700	164700	Harold	145	" I daresay , then , "
164702	164750	164700	164700	Harold	145	" you are more fully possessed of particulars than I am . So that my mother and I need only tell you what no one else can tell you — that is , what are her and my feelings and wishes under these new and unexpected circumstances . "
164751	164757	164759	164759	Esther	208	" I am most anxious , "
164770	164796	164804	164804	She	145	Transome—"most anxious on that point . Indeed , being of course in uncertainty about it , I have not yet known whether I could rejoice . "
164812	164817	164818	164818	she	145	" Our chief anxiety , "
164829	164856	164818	164818	she	145	" is , that there may be no contest , no useless expenditure of money . Of course we will surrender what can be rightfully claimed . "
164857	164868	164870	164870	Harold	145	" My mother expresses our feeling precisely , Miss Lyon , "
164872	164887	164870	164870	Harold	145	" And I 'm sure , Mr Lyon , you will understand our desire . "
164888	164976	164818	164818	she	145	" Assuredly , sir . My daughter would in any case have had my advice to seek a conclusion which would involve no strife . We endeavour , sir , in our body , to hold to the apostolic rule that one Christian brother should not go to law with another ; and I , for my part , would extend this rule to all my fellow - men , apprehending that the practice of our courts is little consistent with the simplicity that is in Christ . "
164977	164987	164989	164989	Esther	208	" If it is to depend on my will , "
164991	165035	164989	164989	Esther	208	" there is nothing that would be more repugnant to me than any struggle on such a subject . But ca n't the lawyers go on doing what they will in spite of me ? It seems that this is what they mean . "
165036	165040	165042	165042	Harold	145	" Not exactly , "
165046	165105	165042	165042	Harold	145	" Of course they live by such struggles as you dislike . But we can thwart them by determining not to quarrel . It is desirable that we should consider the affair together , and put it into the hands of honourable solicitors . I assure you we Transomes will not contend for what is not our own . "
165106	165119	165121	165122	Mrs Transome	145	" And this is what I have come to beg of you , "
165124	165208	165121	165122	Mrs Transome	145	" It is that you will come to Transome Court — and let us take full time to arrange matters . Do oblige me : you shall not be teazed more than you like by an old woman : you shall do just as you please , and become acquainted with your future home , since it is to be yours . I can tell you a world of things that you will want to know ; and the business can proceed properly . "
165209	165213	165215	165215	Harold	145	" Do consent , "
165295	165311	165313	165313	Harold	145	" I hope you do not disapprove of Miss Lyon 's granting us this favour ? "
165318	165342	165313	165313	Harold	145	" I have nothing to oppose to it , sir , if my daughter 's own mind is clear as to her course . "
165343	165353	165355	165356	Mrs Transome	145	" You will come — now — with us , "
165360	165371	165355	165356	Mrs Transome	145	" You will go back with us in the carriage . "
165541	165549	165550	165550	she	208	" Since my father has no objection , "
165553	165574	165550	165550	she	208	" and you urge me so kindly . But I must beg for time to pack up a few clothes . "
165575	165580	165582	165583	Mrs Transome	145	" By all means , "
165585	165593	165582	165583	Mrs Transome	145	" We are not at all pressed . "
165604	165646	165601	165601	Harold	145	" Apart from our immediate reason for coming , Mr Lyon , I could have wished to see you about these unhappy consequences of the election contest . But you will understand that I have been much preoccupied with private affairs . "
165647	165732	165550	165550	she	208	" You have well said that the consequences are unhappy sir . And but for a reliance on something more than human calculation , I know not which I should most bewail — the scandal which wrong - dealing has brought on right principles , or the snares which it laid for the feet of a young man who is dear to me . ' One soweth , and another reapeth , ' is a verity that applies to evil as well as good . "
165733	165845	165550	165550	she	208	" You are referring to Felix Holt . I have not neglected steps to secure the best legal help for the prisoners ; but I am given to understand that Holt refuses any aid from me . I hope he will not go rashly to work in speaking in his own defence without any legal instruction . It is an opprobrium of our law that no counsel is allowed to plead for the prisoner in cases of felony . A ready tongue may do a man as much harm as good in a court of justice . He piques himself on making a display , and displays a little too much . "
165846	165854	165856	165858	the little minister	3720	" Sir , you know him not , "
165865	165938	165856	165858	the little minister	3720	" He would not accept , even if it were accorded , a defence wherein the truth was screened or avoided,—not from a vainglorious spirit of self - exhibition , for he hath a singular directness and simplicity of speech ; but from an averseness to a profession wherein a man may without shame seek to justify the wicked for reward , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him . "
165939	165984	165550	165550	she	208	" It 's a pity a fine young fellow should do himself harm by fanatical notions of that sort . I could at least have procured the advantage of first - rate consultation . He did n't look to me like a dreamy personage . "
165985	166001	165550	165550	she	208	" Nor is he dreamy ; rather , his excess lies in being too practical . "
166002	166046	165856	165858	the little minister	3720	" Well , I hope you will not encourage him in such irrationality : the question is not one of misrepresentation , but of adjusting fact , so as to raise it to the power of evidence . Do n't you see that ? "
166047	166336	165550	165550	she	208	" I do , I do . But I distrust not Felix Holt 's discernment in regard to his own case . He builds not on doubtful things , and hath no illusory hopes ; on the contrary , he is of a too - scornful incredulity where I would fain see a more childlike faith . But he will hold no belief without action corresponding thereto ; and the occasion of his return to this his native place at a time which has proved fatal , was no other than his resolve to hinder the sale of some drugs , which had chiefly supported his mother , but which his better knowledge showed him to be pernicious to the human frame . He undertook to support her by his own labour : but , sir , I pray you to mark — and old as I am , I will not deny that this young man instructs me herein — I pray you to mark the poisonous confusion of good and evil which is the wide - spreading effect of vicious practices . Through the use of undue electioneering means — concerning which , however , I do not accuse you father than of having acted the part of him who washes his hands when he delivers up to others the exercise of an iniquitous power — Felix Holt is , I will not scruple to say , the innocent victim of a riot ; and that deed of strict honesty , whereby he took on himself the charge of his aged mother , seems now to have deprived her of sufficient bread , and is even an occasion of reproach to him from the weaker brethren . "
166337	166352	166354	166354	Harold	145	" I shall be proud to supply her as amply as you think desirable , "
166361	166418	166354	166354	Harold	145	" I will pray you to speak of this question with my daughter , who , it appears , may herself have large means at command , and would desire to minister to Mistress Holt 's needs with all friendship and delicacy . For the present , I can take care that she lacks nothing essential . "
166448	166463	166435	166435	She	208	" You will let my pupils know at once , will you , father ? "
166464	166470	166472	166474	the old man	1438	" Doubtless , my dear , "
166537	166547	166549	166549	Harold	145	" If you are quite ready , Miss Lyon , "
166565	166581	166549	166549	Harold	145	" I will take my mother to the carriage , and come back for you . "
166601	166626	166589	166589	her	208	" This will not be a grief to you , I hope , father ? You think it is better that I should go ? "
166627	166686	166549	166549	Harold	145	" Nay , child , I am weak . But I would fain be capable of a joy quite apart from the accidents of my aged earthly existence , which , indeed , is a petty and almost dried - up fountain — whereas to the receptive soul the river of life pauseth not , nor is diminished . "
166687	166701	166589	166589	her	208	" Perhaps you will see Felix Holt again , and tell him everything ? "
166702	166712	166589	166589	her	208	" Shall I say aught to him for you ? "
166713	166732	166734	166734	Esther	208	" O no ; only that Job Tudge has a little flannel shirt and a box of lozenges , "
166738	166766	166734	166734	Esther	208	" Ah , I hear Mr Transome coming back . I must say good - bye to Lyddy , else she will cry over my hard heart . "
167144	167148	167120	167120	She	159	" Come in . "
167472	167482	167466	167466	her	145	" So you 're come at last , Denner ? "
167483	167504	167466	167466	her	145	" Yes , madam ; it is not late . I 'm sorry you should have undone your hair yourself . "
167505	167534	167466	167466	her	145	" I undid it to see what an old hag I am . These fine clothes you put on me , Denner , are only a smart shroud . "
167535	167687	167466	167466	her	145	" Pray do n't talk so , madam . If there 's anybody does n't think it pleasant to look at you , so much the worse for them . For my part , I 've seen no young ones fit to hold up your train . Look at your likeness down below ; and though you 're older now , what signifies ? I would n't be Letty in the scullery because she 's got red cheeks . She may n't know she 's a poor creature , but I know it , and that 's enough for me : I know what sort of a dowdy draggletail she 'll be in ten years ' time . I would change with nobody , madam . And if troubles were put up to market , I 'd sooner buy old than new . It 's something to have seen the worst . "
167688	167703	167705	167706	Mrs Transome	145	" A woman never has seen the worst till she is old , Denner , "
167775	167779	167754	167755	the bailiff	5113	" none so fond "
167895	167916	167917	167917	she	159	" If there 's anything worse coming to you , I should like to know what it is , madam , "
167942	167983	167917	167917	she	159	" When I awake at cock - crow , I 'd sooner have one real grief on my mind than twenty false . It 's better to know one 's robbed than to think one 's going to be murdered . "
167984	168042	167917	167917	she	159	" I believe you are the creature in the world that loves me best , Denner ; yet you will never understand what I suffer . It 's of no use telling you . There 's no folly in you , and no heartache . You are made of iron . You have never had any trouble . "
168043	168054	167917	167917	she	159	" I 've had some of your trouble , madam . "
168055	168082	167917	167917	she	159	" Yes , you good thing . But as a sick - nurse , that never caught the fever . You never even had a child . "
168083	168162	167917	167917	she	159	" I can feel for things I never went through . I used to be sorry for the poor French Queen when I was young : I 'd have lain cold for her to lie warm . I know people have feelings according to their birth and station . And you always took things to heart , madam , beyond anybody else . But I hope there 's nothing new , to make you talk of the worst . "
168163	168174	168176	168177	Mrs Transome	145	" Yes , Denner , there is — there is , "
168200	168207	168188	168188	she	145	" Is it this young lady ? "
168208	168220	168222	168223	Mrs Transome	145	" Why , what do you think about her , Denner ? "
168243	168342	168188	168188	she	145	" I do n't deny she 's graceful , and she has a pretty smile and very good manners : it 's quite unaccountable by what Banks says about her father . I know nothing of those Treby townsfolk myself , but for my part I 'm puzzled . I 'm fond of Mr Harold . I always shall be , madam . I was at his bringing into the world , and nothing but his doing wrong by you would turn me against him . But the servants all say he 's in love with Miss Lyon . "
168343	168352	168354	168355	Mrs Transome	145	" I wish it were true , Denner , "
168359	168384	168354	168355	Mrs Transome	145	" I wish he were in love with her , so that she could master him , and make him do what she pleased . "
168385	168396	168188	168188	she	145	" Then it is not true — what they say ? "
168397	168533	168354	168355	Mrs Transome	145	" Not true that she will ever master him . No woman ever will . He will make her fond of him , and afraid of him . That 's one of the things you have never gone through , Denner . A woman 's love is always freezing into fear . She wants everything , she is secure of nothing . This girl has a fine spirit — plenty of fire and pride and wit . Men like such captives , as they like horses that champ the bit and paw the ground : they feel more triumph in their mastery . What is the use of a woman 's will?—if she tries , she does n't get it , and she ceases to be loved . God was cruel when he made women . "
168613	168626	168627	168627	she	145	" It may n't be good - luck to be a woman , "
168630	168702	168703	168703	she	145	" But one begins with it from a baby : one gets used to it . And I should n't like to be a man — to cough so loud , and stand straddling about on a wet day , and be so wasteful with meat and drink . They 're a coarse lot , I think . Then I need n't make a trouble of this young lady , madam , "
168712	168779	168703	168703	she	145	" No , Denner . I like her . If that were all — I should like Harold to marry her . It would be the best thing . If the truth were known — and it will be known soon — the estate is hers by law — such law as it is . It 's a strange story : she 's a Bycliffe really . "
168799	168849	168796	168796	she	145	" Well , madam , I was sure there was something wonderful at the bottom of it . And turning the old lawsuits and everything else over in my mind , I thought the law might have something to do with it . Then she is a born lady ? "
168850	168861	168796	168796	she	145	" Yes ; she has good blood in her veins . "
168862	168972	168796	168796	she	145	" We talked that over in the housekeeper 's room — what a hand and an instep she has , and how her head is set on her shoulders — almost like your own , madam . But her lightish complexion spoils her , to my thinking . And Dominic said Mr Harold never admired that sort of woman before . There 's nothing that smooth fellow could n't tell you if he would : he knows the answers to riddles before they 're made . However , he knows how to hold his tongue ; I 'll say that for him . And so do I , madam . "
168973	168992	168796	168796	she	145	" Yes , yes ; you will not talk of it till other people are talking of it . "
168993	169011	168796	168796	she	145	" And so , if Mr Harold married her , it would save all fuss and mischief ? "
169012	169019	168796	168796	she	145	" Yes — about the estate . "
169020	169056	169057	169057	Denner	159	" And he seems inclined ; and she 'll not refuse him , I 'll answer for it . And you like her , madam . There 's everything to set your mind at rest . "
169105	169112	169113	169114	Mrs Transome	145	" I am not at rest ! "
169218	169221	169222	169222	she	145	" Denner , "
169230	169250	169222	169222	she	145	" if I could choose at this moment , I would choose that Harold should never have been born . "
169251	169256	169222	169222	she	145	" Nay , my dear "
169267	169270	169222	169222	she	145	" my dear "
169276	169285	169222	169222	she	145	" it was a happiness to you then . "
169286	169368	169222	169222	she	145	" I do n't believe I felt the happiness then as I feel the misery now . It is foolish to say people ca n't feel much when they are getting old . Not pleasure , perhaps — little comes . But they can feel they are forsaken — why , every fibre in me seems to be a memory that makes a pang . They can feel that all the love in their lives is turned to hatred or contempt . "
169369	169406	169222	169222	she	145	" Not mine , madam , not mine . Let what would be , I should want to live for your sake , for fear you should have nobody to do for you as I would . "
169407	169441	169222	169222	she	145	" Ah , then , you are a happy woman , Denner ; you have loved somebody for forty years who is old and weak now , and ca n't do without you . "
169627	169630	169632	169632	he	488	" Gappa , "
169820	169823	169815	169816	Mr Transome	141	" Gappa , "
170045	170055	170057	170057	Gappa	489	" He can talk well enough if he likes , "
170075	170080	170081	170081	he	141	" You mind him , "
170096	170130	170081	170081	he	141	" You 'll hear : he knows the right names of things well enough , but he likes to make his own . He 'll give you one all to yourself before long . "
170147	170150	170133	170133	Harry	141	" Boo , "
170181	170184	170175	170175	Harry	141	" Gamma , "
170187	170190	170175	170175	Harry	141	" Bite . "
170191	170196	170198	170198	he	141	" It 's wonderful ! "
171385	171398	171377	171378	Mrs Transome	145	" My dear , you make me wish I had a daughter ! "
172242	172249	172221	172221	he	141	" making a bed for her cheek "
172557	172564	172565	172565	he	141	" Do n't move , pray , "
172570	172583	172565	172565	he	141	" you look as if you were standing for your own portrait . "
172584	172592	172594	172594	Esther	208	" I take that as an insinuation , "
172610	172663	172594	172594	Esther	208	" for I notice almost all the portraits are in a conscious , affected attitude . That fair Lady Betty looks as if she had been drilled into that posture , and had not will enough of her own ever to move again unless she had a little push given to her . "
172664	172677	172679	172679	Harold	141	" She brightens up that panel well with her long satin skirt , "
172686	172699	172679	172679	Harold	141	" but alive I daresay she would have been less cheerful company . "
172700	172722	172724	172724	Esther	208	" One would certainly think that she had just been unpacked from silver paper . Ah , how chivalrous you are ! "
173016	173020	173022	173022	Esther	208	" I wonder , "
173032	173080	173022	173022	Esther	208	tones—"I wonder whether the women who looked in that way ever felt any troubles . I see there are two old ones up - stairs in the billiard - room who have only got fat ; the expression of their faces is just of the same sort . "
173081	173103	173105	173106	Harold Transome	141	" A woman ought never to have any trouble . There should always be a man to guard her from it . "
173145	173167	173169	173169	Esther	208	" But suppose the man himself got into trouble — you would wish her to mind about that . Or suppose , "
173178	173185	173169	173169	Esther	208	" the man himself was troublesome ? "
173186	173210	173226	173226	her	208	" O you must not strain probabilities in that way . The generality of men are perfect . Take me , for example . "
173211	173220	173222	173222	Esther	208	" You are a perfect judge of sauces , "
173240	173251	173226	173226	her	208	" That is perfection number one . Pray go on . "
173252	173282	173226	173226	her	208	" O , the catalogue is too long — I should be tired before I got to your magnificent ruby ring and your gloves always of the right colour . "
173283	173300	173226	173226	her	208	" If you would let me tell you your perfections , I should not be tired . "
173301	173315	173226	173226	her	208	" That is not complimentary ; it means that the list is short . "
173316	173330	173226	173226	her	208	" No ; it means that the list is pleasant to dwell upon . "
173331	173337	173339	173339	Esther	208	" Pray do n't begin , "
173349	173382	173339	173339	Esther	208	" it would be dangerous to our good understanding . The person I liked best in the world was one who did nothing but scold me and tell me of my faults . "
173504	173512	173514	173514	Harold	141	" You speak in the past tense , "
173519	173561	173514	173514	Harold	141	" yet I am rather envious of that person . I shall never be able to win your regard in the same way . Is it any one at Treby ? Because in that case I can inquire about your faults . "
173562	173574	173576	173576	Esther	208	" O you know I have always lived among grave people , "
173589	173670	173671	173671	Esther	208	" Before I came home to be with my father I was nothing but a school - girl first , and then a teacher in different stages of growth . People in those circumstances are not usually flattered . But there are varieties in fault - finding . At our Paris school the master I liked best was an old man who stormed at me terribly when I read Racine , but yet showed that he was proud of me . "
173703	173716	173717	173717	he	141	" That must have been a wretched life for you at Treby , "
173718	173724	173671	173671	Esther	208	said,—"a person of your accomplishments . "
173725	173733	173735	173735	Esther	208	" I used to be dreadfully discontented , "
173748	173776	173671	173671	Esther	208	" But I was becoming less so . I have had time to get rather wise , you know ; I am two - and - twenty . "
173777	173780	173782	173782	Harold	141	" Yes , "
173794	173813	173782	173782	Harold	141	" you are past your majority ; you are empress of your own fortunes — and more besides . "
173814	173818	173820	173820	Esther	208	" Dear me , "
173834	173850	173820	173820	Esther	208	" I do n't think I know very well what to do with my empire . "
173851	173854	173856	173856	Harold	141	" Well , "
173876	173954	173856	173856	Harold	141	" I hope that in any case , since you appear to have no near relative who understands affairs , you will confide in me , and trust me with all your intentions as if I had no other personal concern in the matter than a regard for you . I hope you believe me capable of acting as the guardian of your interest , even where it turns out to be inevitably opposed to my own . "
173955	173968	173970	173970	Esther	208	" I am sure you have given me reason to believe it , "
174067	174078	174079	174079	he	141	" I see you have made mistakes in your work , "
174098	174107	174109	174109	Esther	208	" Nonsense ! you know nothing about it , "
174123	174132	174109	174109	Esther	208	" Those blunders have a design in them . "
174199	174217	174196	174196	he	141	" I am wondering whether you have any deep wishes and secrets that I ca n't guess . "
174218	174227	174229	174229	Esther	208	" Pray do n't speak of my wishes , "
174243	174268	174269	174269	she	208	" I could not possibly tell you one at this moment — I think I shall never find them out again . O yes , "
174283	174318	174269	174269	she	208	feelings—"I do know one wish distinctly . I want to go and see my father . He writes me word that all is well with him , but still I want to see him . "
174319	174329	174370	174371	the audience	6157	" You shall be driven there when you like . "
174330	174345	174347	174347	Esther	208	" May I go now — I mean as soon as it is convenient ? "
174351	174364	174366	174366	Harold	141	" I will give the order immediately , if you wish it , "
174562	174566	174518	174518	him	3720	" the little horn "
174584	174596	174598	174598	Esther	208	" You will not like me to interrupt you , father ? "
174602	174609	174610	174610	he	3720	" Ah , my beloved child ! "
174642	174686	174627	174627	his	3720	" Thy appearing is as a joy despaired of . I had thought of thee as the blinded think of the daylight — which indeed is a thing to rejoice in , like all other good , though we see it not nigh . "
174687	174707	174709	174709	Esther	208	" Are you sure you have been as well and comfortable as you said you were in your letters ? "
174728	174800	174802	174804	the little man	1457	" I wrote truly , my dear , according to my knowledge at the time . But to an old memory like mine the present days are but as a little water poured on the deep . It seems now that all has been as usual , except my studies , which have gone somewhat curiously into prophetic history . But I fear you will rebuke me for my negligent apparel , "
174821	174884	174802	174804	the little man	1457	" That is Lyddy 's fault , who sits crying over her want of Christian assurance instead of brushing your clothes and putting out your clean cravat . She is always saying her righteousness is filthy rags , and really I do n't think that is a very strong expression for it . I 'm sure it is dusty clothes and furniture . "
174885	174956	174802	174804	the little man	1457	" Nay , my dear , your playfulness glances too severely on our faithful Lyddy . Doubtless I am myself deficient , in that I do not aid her infirm memory by admonition . But now tell me aught that you have left untold about yourself . Your heart has gone out somewhat towards this family — the old man and the child , whom I had not reckoned of ? "
174957	174986	174802	174804	the little man	1457	" Yes , father . It is more and more difficult to me to see how I can make up my mind to disturb these people at all . "
174987	175033	174802	174804	the little man	1457	" Something should doubtless be devised to lighten the loss and the change to the aged father and mother . I would have you in any case seek to temper a vicissitude , which is nevertheless a providential arrangement not to be wholly set aside . "
175034	175065	174802	174804	the little man	1457	" Do you think , father — do you feel assured that a case of inheritance like this of mine is a sort of providential arrangement that makes a command ? "
175066	175073	175075	175076	Mr Lyon	201	" I have so held it , "
175080	175157	175075	175076	Mr Lyon	201	" in all my meditations I have so held it . For you have to consider , my dear , that you have been led by a peculiar path , and into experience which is not ordinarily the lot of those who are seated in high places ; and what I have hinted to you already in my letters on this head , I shall wish on a future opportunity to enter into more at large . "
175217	175238	175202	175202	She	208	" Have you been again to see Felix Holt , father ? You have not mentioned him in your letters . "
175239	175302	175202	175202	She	208	" I have been since I last wrote , my dear , and I took his mother with me , who , I fear , made the time heavy to him with her plaints . But afterwards I carried her away to the house of a brother minister at Loamford , and returned to Felix , and then we had much discourse . "
175303	175323	175202	175202	She	208	" Did you tell him of everything that has happened — I mean about me — about the Transomes ? "
175324	175429	175202	175202	She	208	" Assuredly I told him , and he listened as one astonished . For he had much to hear , knowing nought of your birth , and that you had any other father than Rufus Lyon . ' Tis a narrative I trust I shall not be called on to give to others ; but I was not without satisfaction in unfolding the truth to this young man , who hath wrought himself into my affection strangely — I would fain hope for ends that will be a visible good in his less way - worn life , when mine shall be no longer . "
175430	175450	175202	175202	She	208	" And you told him how the Transomes had come , and that I was staying at Transome Court ? "
175451	175476	175202	175202	She	208	" Yes , I told these things with some particularity , as is my wo nt concerning what hath imprinted itself on my mind . "
175477	175483	175202	175202	She	208	" What did Felix say ? "
175484	175495	175497	175498	Mr Lyon	201	" Truly , my dear , nothing desirable to recite , "
175507	175533	175497	175498	Mr Lyon	201	" Dear father , he did say something , and you always remember what people say . Pray tell me ; I want to know . "
175534	175567	175202	175202	She	208	" It was a hasty remark , and rather escaped him than was consciously framed . He said , ' Then she will marry Transome ; that is what Transome means . ' "
175568	175573	175575	175575	Esther	208	" That was all ? "
175595	175791	175575	175575	Esther	208	" Yes , we did not go further into that branch of the subject . I apprehend there is no warrant for his seeming prognostic , and I should not be without disquiet if I thought otherwise . For I confess that in your accession to this great position and property , I contemplate with hopeful satisfaction your remaining attached to that body of congregational Dissent , which , as I hold , hath retained most of pure and primitive discipline . Your education and peculiar history would thus be seen to have coincided with a long train of events in making this family property a mean of honouring and illustrating a purer form of Christianity than that which hath unhappily obtained the pre - eminence in this land . I speak , my child , as you know , always in the hope that you will fully join our communion ; and this dear wish of my heart — nay , this urgent prayer — would seem to be frustrated by your marriage with a man , of whom there is at least no visible indication that he would unite himself to our body . "
175816	175820	175575	175575	Esther	208	" joining the church "
176098	176113	176114	176114	he	1479	" Have you yet spoken with Mr Transome concerning Mistress Holt , my dear ? "
176125	176143	176114	176114	he	1479	" I hinted to him that you would best decide how assistance should be tendered to her . "
176144	176198	176114	176114	he	1479	" No , father , we have not approached the subject . Mr Transome may have forgotten it , and , for several reasons , I would rather not talk of this — of money matters to him at present . There is money due to me from the Lukyns and the Pendrells . "
176199	176205	176207	176208	Mr Lyon	201	" They have paid it , "
176214	176225	176207	176208	Mr Lyon	201	" I have it here ready to deliver to you . "
176226	176258	176260	176260	Esther	208	" Keep it , father , and pay Mrs Holt 's rent with it , and do anything else that is wanted for her . We must consider everything temporary now , "
176291	176312	176313	176313	she	208	" Everything is uncertain — what may become of Felix — what may become of us all . O dear ! "
176323	176335	176313	176313	she	208	" I am beginning to talk like Lyddy , I think . "
176336	176339	176341	176342	Mr Lyon	201	" Truly , "
176346	176397	176341	176342	Mr Lyon	201	" the uncertainty of things is a text rather too wide and obvious for fruitful application ; and to discourse of it is , as one may say , to bottle up the air , and make a present of it to those who are already standing out of doors . "
176398	176403	176405	176405	Esther	208	" Do you think , "
176414	176432	176405	176405	Esther	208	" that the Treby people know at all about the reasons of my being at Transome Court ? "
176433	176618	176341	176342	Mr Lyon	201	" I have had no sign thereof ; and indeed there is no one , as it appears , who could make the story public . The man Christian is away in London with Mr Debarry , Parliament now beginning ; and Mr Jermyn would doubtless respect the confidence of the Transomes . I have not seen him lately . I know nothing of his movements . And so far as my own speech is concerned , and my strict command to Lyddy , I have withheld the means of information even as to your having returned to Transome Court in the carriage , not wishing to give any occasion to solicitous questioning till time hath somewhat inured me . But it hath got abroad that you are there , and is the subject of conjectures , whereof , I imagine , the chief is , that you are gone as companion to Mistress Transome ; for some of our friends have already hinted a rebuke to me that I should permit your taking a position so little likely to further your spiritual welfare . "
176619	176644	176646	176646	Esther	208	" Now , father , I think I shall be obliged to run away from you , not to keep the carriage too long , "
176659	176677	176646	176646	Esther	208	" You look beautiful now , and I must give Lyddy a little lecture before I go . "
176678	176761	176762	176762	Esther	208	" Yes , my dear ; I would not detain you , seeing that my duties demand me . But take with you this Treatise , which I have purposely selected . It concerns all the main questions between ourselves and the Establishment — government , discipline , State - support . It is seasonable that you should give a nearer attention to these polemics , lest you be drawn aside by the fallacious association of a State Church with elevated rank . "
178371	178378	178379	178379	she	145	" Harold has gone to Loamford , "
178387	178397	178379	178379	she	145	" You had something particular to say to me ? "
178398	178401	178403	178403	Jermyn	169	" Yes , "
178412	178449	178403	178403	Jermyn	169	" The last time I was here I could not take the opportunity of speaking to you . But I am anxious to know whether you are aware of what has passed between me and Harold ? "
178450	178459	178379	178379	she	145	" Yes , he has told me everything . "
178460	178474	178379	178379	she	145	" About his proceedings against me ? and the reason he stopped them ? "
178475	178489	178379	178379	she	145	" Yes : have you had notice that he has begun them again ? "
178490	178493	178495	178495	Jermyn	169	" No , "
178503	178510	178512	178513	Mrs Transome	145	" Of course he will now , "
178515	178528	178512	178513	Mrs Transome	145	" There is no reason in his mind why he should not . "
178529	178539	178379	178379	she	145	" Has he resolved to risk the estate then ? "
178540	178576	178379	178379	she	145	" He feels in no danger on that score . And if there were , the danger does n't depend on you . The most likely thing is , that he will marry this girl . "
178577	178583	178585	178585	Jermyn	169	" He knows everything then ? "
178595	178631	178633	178634	Mrs Transome	145	" Everything . It 's of no use for you to think of mastering him : you ca n't do it . I used to wish Harold to be fortunate — and he is fortunate , "
178640	178650	178633	178634	Mrs Transome	145	" It 's not my star that he inherits . "
178651	178665	178633	178634	Mrs Transome	145	" Do you know how he came by the information about this girl ? "
178666	178685	178686	178686	Jermyn	169	" No ; but she knew it all before we spoke to her . It 's no secret . "
178729	178741	178720	178720	he	169	" You are aware that these Chancery proceedings may ruin me ? "
178742	178844	178686	178686	Jermyn	169	" He told me they would . But if you are imagining that I can do anything , dismiss the notion . I have told him as plainly as I dare that I wish him to drop all public quarrel with you , and that you could make an arrangement without scandal . I can do no more . He will not listen to me ; he does n't mind about my feelings . He cares more for Mr Transome than he does for me . He will not listen to me any more than if I were an old balladsinger . "
178845	178856	178858	178858	Jermyn	169	" It 's very hard on me , I know , "
178872	178888	178858	178858	Jermyn	169	" I besought you three months ago to bear anything rather than quarrel with him . "
178889	178934	178686	178686	Jermyn	169	" I have not quarrelled with him . It is he who has been always seeking a quarrel with me . I have borne a good deal — more than any one else would . He set his teeth against me from the first . "
178935	178950	178952	178953	Mrs Transome	145	" He saw things that annoyed him ; and men are not like women , "
178964	178976	178978	178978	Jermyn	169	" It 's very hard on me — I know that , "
179009	179078	179079	179079	He	169	" Of course the law in this case ca n't in the least represent the justice of the matter . I made a good many sacrifices in times past . I gave up a great deal of fine business for the sake of attending to the family affairs , and in that lawsuit they would have gone to rack and ruin if it had n't been for me . "
179183	179303	179164	179164	she	145	" I stretched my conscience a good deal in that affair of Bycliffe , as you know perfectly well . I told you everything at the time . I told you I was very uneasy about those witnesses , and about getting him thrown into prison . I know it 's the blackest thing anybody could charge me with , if they knew my life from beginning to end ; and I should never have done it , if I had not been under an infatuation such as makes a man do anything . What did it signify to me about the loss of the lawsuit ? I was a young bachelor — I had the world before me . "
179304	179307	179309	179310	Mrs Transome	145	" Yes , "
179317	179329	179309	179310	Mrs Transome	145	" It was a pit you did n't make another choice . "
179330	179338	179340	179340	Jermyn	169	" What would have become of you ? "
179353	179373	179309	179310	Mrs Transome	145	" I had to think of you . You would not have liked me to make another choice then . "
179374	179377	179379	179380	Mrs Transome	145	" Clearly , "
179390	179397	179379	179380	Mrs Transome	145	" the greater mistake was mine . "
179433	179439	179440	179440	he	169	" I hardly see that , "
179450	179516	179440	179440	he	169	" You had an estate and a position to save , to go no farther . I remember very well what you said to me—'A clever lawyer can do anything if he has the will ; if it 's impossible , he will make it possible . And the property is sure to be Harold 's some day . ' He was a baby then . "
179517	179541	179407	179407	Jermyn	169	" I remember most things a little too well : you had better say at once what is your object in recalling them . "
179542	179678	179679	179679	Jermyn	169	" An object that is nothing more than justice . With the relation I stood in , it was not likely I should think myself bound by all the forms that are made to bind strangers . I had often immense trouble to raise the money necessary to pay off debts and carry on the affairs ; and , as I said before , I had given up other lines of advancement which would have been open to me if I had not stayed in this neighbourhood at a critical time when I was fresh to the world . Anybody who knew the whole circumstances would say that my being hunted and run down on the score of my past transactions with regard to the family affairs , is an abominably unjust and unnatural thing . "
179688	179722	179679	179679	Jermyn	169	" At my time of life ... and with a family about me — and after what has passed ... I should have thought there was nothing you would care more to prevent . "
179723	179745	179407	179407	Jermyn	169	" I do care . It makes me miserable . That is the extent of my power — to feel miserable . "
179746	179787	179788	179788	Jermyn	169	" No , it is not the extent of your power . You could save me if you would . It is not to be supposed that Harold would go on against me ... if he knew the whole truth . "
179928	179934	179924	179924	his	169	" if he knew the whole truth"—a
179966	179975	179976	179976	she	145	" And you expect me to tell him ? "
179993	180004	180006	180006	Jermyn	169	" Would it not be right for him to know ? "
180051	180058	180060	180061	Mrs Transome	145	" I will never tell him ! "
180109	180185	180186	180186	Jermyn	169	" You reckon up your sacrifices for me : you have kept a good account of them , and it is needful ; they are some of them what no one else could guess or find out . But you made your sacrifices when they seemed pleasant to you ; when you told me they were your happiness ; when you told me that it was I who stooped , and I who bestowed favours . "
180213	180218	180219	180220	Mrs Transome	145	" Do n't speak ! "
180224	180372	180219	180220	Mrs Transome	145	" Do n't open your lips again . You have said enough ; I will speak now . I have made sacrifices too , but it was when I knew that they were not my happiness . It was after I saw that I had stooped — after I saw that your tenderness had turned into calculation — after I saw that you cared for yourself only , and not for me . I heard your explanations — of your duty in life — of our mutual reputation — of a virtuous young lady attached to you . I bore it ; I let everything go ; I shut my eyes ; I might almost have let myself starve , rather than have scenes of quarrel with the man I had loved , in which I must accuse him of turning my love into a good bargain . "
180413	180459	180397	180397	she	145	" I suppose if a lover picked one 's pocket , there 's no woman would like to own it . I do n't say I was not afraid of you : I was afraid of you , and I know now I was right . "
180460	180464	180466	180466	Jermyn	169	" Mrs Transome , "
180473	180490	180466	180466	Jermyn	169	" it is needless to say more . I withdraw any words that have offended you . "
180491	180608	180397	180397	she	145	" You ca n't withdraw them . Can a man apologise for being a dastard ? ... And I have caused you to strain your conscience , have I?—it is I who have sullied your purity ? I should think the demons have more honour — they are not so impudent to one another . I would not lose the misery of being a woman , now I see what can be the baseness of a man . One must be a man — first to tell a woman that her love has made her your debtor , and then ask her to pay you by breaking the last poor threads between her and her son . "
180609	180616	180618	180618	Jermyn	169	" I do not ask it , "
180656	180761	180643	180643	He	169	" You do ask it : it is what you would like . I have had a terror on me least evil should happen to you . From the first , after Harold came home , I had a horrible dread . It seemed as if murder might come between you — I did n't know what . I felt the horror of his not knowing the truth . I might have been dragged at last , by my own feeling — by my own memory — to tell him all , and make him as well as myself miserable , to save you . "
180787	180833	180782	180782	she	5190	" But now you have asked me , I will never tell him ! Be ruined — no — do something more dastardly to save yourself . If I sinned , my judgment went beforehand — that I should sin for a man like you . "
181644	181655	181628	181630	the old man	1438	" Mr Jermyn?—why — why — where is Mrs Transome ? "
182029	182033	182035	182035	Esther	208	" To him , "
182049	182071	182035	182035	Esther	208	" who has not had the sort of intercourse in which Felix Holt 's cultured nature would have asserted its superiority . "
182807	182824	182800	182800	she	208	" A woman must choose meaner things , because only meaner things are offered to her . "
183162	183168	183151	183152	Uncle Lingon	152	" no mischief of anybody , "
183226	183229	183214	183217	a judge of women	4134	" points , "
183571	183574	183555	183557	the tyrannous lad	4150	" Gappa , "
183632	183638	183630	183630	he	146	" gone through all that ; "
183683	183695	183697	183697	Harold	141	" What do you think about thinning the trees over there ? "
183704	183766	183697	183697	Harold	141	" I have a bit of a notion that if they were divided into clumps so as to show the oaks beyond , it would be a great improvement . It would give an idea of extent that is lost now . And there might be some very pretty clumps got out of those mixed trees . What do you think ? "
183767	183795	183797	183797	Esther	208	" I should think it would be an improvement . One likes a ' beyond ' everywhere . But I never heard you express yourself so dubiously , "
183805	183846	183797	183797	Esther	208	" you generally see things so clearly , and are so convinced , that I shall begin to feel quite tottering if I find you in uncertainty . Pray do n't begin to be doubtful ; it is so infectious . "
183847	183860	183862	183862	Harold	141	" You think me a great deal too sure — too confident ? "
183864	183888	183862	183862	Harold	141	" Not at all . It is an immense advantage to know your own will , when you always mean to have it . "
183889	183903	183905	183905	Harold	141	" But suppose I could n't get it , in spite of meaning ? "
183915	183919	183921	183921	Esther	208	" O then , "
183941	183975	183932	183932	she	208	" you would bear it quite easily , as you did your not getting into Parliament . You would know you could get it another time — or get something else as good . "
183976	183981	183983	183983	Harold	141	" The fact is , "
184004	184018	183983	183983	Harold	141	" you consider me a fat , fatuous , self - satisfied fellow . "
184019	184025	184027	184027	Esther	208	" O there are degrees , "
184034	184059	184027	184027	Esther	208	" you have just as much of those qualities as is becoming . There are different styles . You are perfect in your own . "
184060	184088	183983	183983	Harold	141	" But you prefer another style , I suspect . A more submissive , tearful , devout worshipper , who would offer his incense with more trembling . "
184089	184095	184097	184097	Esther	208	" You are quite mistaken , "
184102	184133	184097	184097	Esther	208	" I find I am very wayward . When anything is offered to me , it seems that I prize it less , and do n't want to have it . "
184170	184182	184183	184183	she	208	" I have often read that that is in human nature , "
184187	184200	184201	184201	she	208	" yet it takes me by surprise in myself . I suppose , "
184206	184217	184201	184201	she	208	" I did n't think of myself as human nature . "
184218	184228	184230	184230	Harold	141	" I do n't confess to the same waywardness , "
184232	184329	184201	184201	she	208	" I am very fond of things that I can get . And I never longed much for anything out of my reach . Whatever I feel sure of getting I like all the better . I think half those priggish maxims about human nature in the lump are no more to be relied on than universal remedies . There are different sorts of human nature . Some are given to discontent and longing , others to securing and enjoying . And let me tell you , the discontented longing style is unpleasant to live with . "
184339	184353	184354	184354	she	208	" O , I assure you I have abjured all admiration for it , "
184586	184590	184600	184601	a woman	4915	" the people . "
184744	184751	184753	184754	the Rector	1088	" But you know , lad , "
184764	184929	184753	184754	the Rector	1088	" you ca n't do everything in a hurry . The wheat must have time to grow , even when you 've reformed all us old Tories off the face of the ground . Dash it ! now the election 's over : I 'm an old Tory again . You see , Harold , a Radical wo n't do for the county . At another election , you must be on the look - out for a borough where they want a bit of blood . I should have liked you uncommonly to stand for the county ; and a Radical of good family squares well enough with a new - fashioned Tory like young Debarry ; but you see , these riots — it 's been a nasty business . I shall have my hair combed at the sessions for a year to come . But , heyday ! What dame is this , with a small boy?—not one of my parishioners ? "
185260	185269	185241	185241	Esther	208	" How do you do , Mrs Holt ? "
185280	185290	185292	185293	Mrs Holt	198	" Yes — you know him , Miss Lyon , "
185313	185355	185292	185293	Mrs Holt	198	" you know the orphin child , as Felix brought home for me that am his mother to take care of . And it 's what I 've done — nobody more so — though it 's trouble is my reward . "
185603	185614	185616	185616	Esther	208	" I hope Job 's cough has been better lately , "
185633	185643	185645	185646	Mrs Holt	198	" I daresay you hope so , Miss Lyon , "
185654	185823	185645	185646	Mrs Holt	198	" I 've no reason to disbelieve but what you wish well to the child , and to Felix , and to me . I 'm sure nobody has any occasion to wish me otherways . My character will bear inquiry , and what you , as are young , do n't know , others can tell you . That was what I said to myself when I made up my mind to come here and see you , and ask you to get me the freedom to speak to Mr Transome . I said , whatever Miss Lyon may be now , in the way of being lifted up among great people , she 's our minister 's daughter , and was not above coming to my house and walking with my son Felix — though I 'll not deny he made that figure on the Lord 's Day , that 'll perhaps go against him with the judge , if anybody thinks well to tell him . "
185873	185889	185861	185861	he	141	" You are then the mother of the unfortunate young man who is in prison ? "
185890	185898	185900	185901	Mrs Holt	198	" Indeed , I am , sir , "
185912	186263	185900	185901	Mrs Holt	198	" It 's not likely I should claim him if he was n't my own ; though it 's not by my will , nor my advice , sir , that he ever walked ; for I gave him none but good . But if everybody 's son was guided by their mothers , the world ' ud be different ; my son is not worse than many another woman 's son , and that in Treby , whatever they may say as have n't got their sons in prison . And as to his giving up the doctoring , and then stopping his father 's medicines , I know it 's bad — that I know — but it 's me has had to suffer , and it 's me a king and Parliament'ud consider , if they meant to do the right thing , and had anybody to make it known to 'em . And as for the rioting and killing the constable — my son said most plain to me he never meant it , and there was his bit of potato - pie for his dinner getting dry by the fire , the whole blessed time as I sat and never knew what was coming on me . And it 's my opinion as if great people make elections to get themselves into Parliament , and there 's riot and murder to do it , they ought to see as the widow and the widow 's son does n't suffer for it . I well know my duty : and I read my Bible ; and I know in Jude where it 's been stained with the dried tulip - leaves this many a year , as you 're told not to rail at your betters if they was the devil himself ; nor will I ; but this I do say , if it 's three Mr Transomes instead of one as is listening to me , as there 's them ought to go to king and get him to let off my son Felix . "
186366	186370	186355	186355	she	198	" get to speak "
186502	186571	186493	186493	Harold	141	" I think you are quite right , Mrs Holt . And for my part , I am determined to do my best for your son , both in the witness - box and elsewhere . Take comfort ; if it is necessary , the king shall be appealed to . And rely upon it , I shall bear you in mind , as Felix Holt 's mother . "
186589	186594	186596	186597	Mrs Holt	198	" Well , sir , "
186609	186724	186596	186597	Mrs Holt	198	" I 'm glad to hear you speak so becoming ; and if you had been the king himself , I should have made free to tell you my opinion . For the Bible says , the king 's favour is towards a wise servant ; and it 's reasonable to think he 'd make all the more account of them as have never been in service , or took wage , which I never did , and never thought of my son doing ; and his father left money , meaning otherways , so as he might have been a doctor on horseback at this very minute , instead of being in prison . "
186725	186736	186738	186745	Mr Lingon , who had not understood this	170	" What ! was he regularly apprenticed to a doctor ? "
186748	186908	186738	186745	Mr Lingon , who had not understood this	170	" Sir , he was , and most clever , like his father before him , only he turned contrairy . But as for harming anybody , Felix never meant to harm anybody but himself and his mother , which he certainly did in respect of his clothes , and taking to be a low working man , and stopping my living respectable , more particular by the pills , which had a sale , as you may be sure they suited people 's insides . And what folks can never have boxes enough of to swallow , I should think you have a right to sell . And there 's many and many a text for it , as I 've opened on without ever thinking ; for if it 's true , ' Ask , and you shall have , ' I should think it 's truer when you 're willing to pay for what you have . "
186984	187002	187004	187004	Esther	208	" I 'm sure you must be tired with your long walk , and little Job too , "
187014	187020	187021	187021	she	208	" Arn't you , Job ? "
187069	187084	187086	187087	Mrs Holt	198	" It 's well you can feel for the orphin child , Miss Lyon , "
187112	187214	187086	187087	Mrs Holt	198	" I did n't believe but what you 'd behave pretty , as you always did to me , though everybody used to say you held yourself high . But I 'm sure you never did to Felix , for you let him sit by you at the Free School before all the town , and him with never a bit of stock round his neck . And it shows you saw that in him worth taking notice of;—and it is but right , if you know my words are true , as you should speak for him to the gentlemen . "
187215	187223	187225	187225	Harold	141	" I assure you , Mrs Holt , "
187230	187298	187086	187087	Mrs Holt	198	rescue—"I assure you that enough has been said to make me use my best efforts for your son . And now , pray , go on to the house with the little boy and take some rest . Dominic , show Mrs Holt the way , and ask Mrs Hickes to make her comfortable , and see that somebody takes her back to Treby in the buggy . "
187299	187308	187310	187310	Esther	208	" I will go back with Mrs Holt , "
187318	187323	187325	187325	Harold	141	" No , pray , "
187338	187372	187325	187325	Harold	141	" Let Mrs Holt have time to rest . We shall have returned , and you can see her before she goes . We will say goodbye for the present , Mrs Holt . "
187390	187395	187398	187398	she	3732	" the orphin child , "
187932	187987	187927	187927	Harold	141	" I should think there 's a good deal of worth in this young fellow — this Holt , notwithstanding the mistakes he has made . A little queer and conceited , perhaps ; but that is usually the case with men of his class when they are at all superior to their fellows . "
187988	188004	188006	188006	Esther	208	" Felix Holt is a highly cultivated man ; he is not at all conceited , "
188029	188032	188034	188034	Harold	141	" Ah ? "
188045	188084	188034	188034	Harold	141	" This eccentricity is a sort of fanaticism , then?—this giving up being a doctor on horseback , as the old woman calls it , and taking to — let me see — watchmaking , is n't it ? "
188085	188143	188147	188147	Esther	208	" If it is eccentricity to be very much better than other men , he is certainly eccentric ; and fanatical too , if it is fanatical to renounce all small selfish motives for the sake of a great and unselfish one . I never knew what nobleness of character really was before I knew Felix Holt . "
188168	188173	188175	188175	Harold	141	" God bless me ! "
188193	188205	188175	188175	Harold	141	" I wish you had talked to me about this before . "
188256	188306	188307	188307	Harold	141	" I think I did n't see the meaning of anything fine — I did n't even see the value of my father 's character , until I had been taught a little by hearing what Felix Holt said , and seeing that his life was like his words . "
188322	188329	188330	188330	he	141	" This is not like love , "
188473	188485	188492	188492	he	141	" He 's quite an apostolic sort of fellow , then , "
188499	188566	188568	188568	Harold	141	" He did n't look like that ; but I had only a short interview with him , and I was given to understand that he refused to see me in prison . I believe he 's not very well inclined towards me . But you saw a great deal of him , I suppose ; and your testimony to any one is enough for me , "
188576	188619	188568	188568	Harold	141	" Now I know what your opinion is , I shall spare no effort on behalf of such a young man . In fact , I had come to the same resolution before , but your wish would make difficult things easy . "
188770	188869	188760	188760	Harold	141	" What could we do for this young man , supposing he were let off ? I shall send a letter with fifty pounds to the old woman to - morrow . I ought to have done it before , but it really slipped my memory , amongst the many things that have occupied me lately . But this young man — what do you think would be the best thing we could do for him , if he gets at large again ? He should be put in a position where his qualities could be more telling . "
188929	188937	188938	188938	she	208	" You are hopelessly in the dark , "
188951	188993	188938	188938	she	208	" What would you offer Felix Holt ? a place in the Excise ? You might as well think of offering it to John the Baptist . Felix has chosen his lot . He means always to be a poor man . "
188994	188999	189001	189001	Harold	141	" Means ? Yes , "
189004	189032	189001	189001	Harold	141	piqued,"but what a man means usually depends on what happens . I mean to be a commoner ; but a peerage might present itself under acceptable circumstances . "
189033	189046	189048	189048	Esther	208	" O there is no sum in proportion to be done there , "
189053	189078	189048	189048	Esther	208	" As you are to a peerage , so is not Felix Holt to any offer of advantage that you could imagine for him . "
189079	189095	189001	189001	Harold	141	" You must think him fit for any position — the first in the county . "
189096	189103	189105	189105	Esther	208	" No , I do n't , "
189112	189121	189108	189108	her	208	" I think him too high for it . "
189122	189133	189001	189001	Harold	141	" I see you can be ardent in your admiration . "
189134	189152	189001	189001	Harold	141	" Yes , it is my champagne ; you know I do n't like the other kind . "
189153	189167	189169	189169	Harold	141	" That would be satisfactory if one were sure of getting your admiration , "
189226	189244	189246	189246	Harold	141	" Would it do as well to admire you , instead of being worthy to be admired ? "
189259	189271	189273	189273	Esther	208	" It would be a thing to be put up with , "
189281	189294	189273	189273	Esther	208	" But you are not in that state of self - despair . "
189295	189313	189255	189255	Esther	208	" Well , I am conscious of not having those severe virtues that you have been praising . "
189314	189326	189273	189273	Esther	208	" That is true . You are quite in another genre . "
189327	189338	189273	189273	Esther	208	" A woman would not find me a tragic hero . "
189339	189373	189255	189255	Esther	208	" O , no ! She must dress for genteel comedy — such as your mother once described to me — where the most thrilling event is the drawing of a handsome cheque . "
189374	189381	189383	189383	Harold	141	" You are a naughty fairy , "
189422	189434	189413	189413	he	141	" Confess that you are disgusted with my want of romance . "
189435	189458	189255	189255	Esther	208	" I shall not confess to being disgusted . I shall ask you to confess that you are not a romantic figure . "
189459	189467	189413	189413	he	141	" I am a little too stout . "
189468	189485	189413	189413	he	141	" For romance — yes . At least you must find security for not getting stouter . "
189486	189495	189255	189255	Esther	208	" And I do n't look languishing enough ? "
189496	189510	189413	189413	he	141	" O yes — rather too much so — at a fine cigar . "
189511	189522	189413	189413	he	141	" And I am not in danger of committing suicide ? "
189523	189531	189532	189532	Harold	141	" No ; you are a widower . "
189627	189653	189616	189616	he	141	" You do n't suppose , I hope , that any other woman has ever held the place that you could hold in my life ? "
189684	189688	189676	189676	She	208	" How so ? "
189689	189704	189676	189676	She	208	" Harry 's mother had been a slave — was bought , in fact . "
189803	189855	189799	189799	Harold	141	" Though I am close on thirty - five , I never met with a woman at all like you before . There are new eras in one 's life that are equivalent to youth — are something better than youth . I was never an aspirant till I knew you . "
189861	189897	189856	189856	Esther	208	" Not that I dare to call myself that . I am not so confident a personage as you imagine . I am necessarily in a painful position for a man who has any feeling . "
189955	189968	189969	189969	she	208	" Do not let us speak of difficult things any more now , "
189976	190015	190016	190016	She	208	" I am come into a new world of late , and have to learn life all over again . Let us go in . I must see poor Mrs Holt again , and my little friend Job . "
190346	190393	190330	190330	she	198	" It 's most pretty to see its little limbs , and the gentleman holding it . I should think he was amiable by his look ; but it was odd he should have his likeness took without any clothes . Was he Transome by name ? "
190441	190444	190430	190432	old Mr Transome	141	" forty winks "
190633	190636	190638	190639	great folks	4256	" said nothing "
190679	190693	190694	190694	she	198	" I hope I 'm in no ways taking a liberty , sir , "
190708	190749	190694	190694	she	198	" I 'm not that woman to sit anywhere out of my own home without inviting , and pressing too . But I was brought here to wait , because the little gentleman wanted to play with the orphin child . "
190750	190764	190766	190767	Mr Transome	141	" Very glad , my good woman — sit down — sit down , "
190776	190784	190766	190767	Mr Transome	141	" Nice little boy . Your grandchild ? "
190785	190792	190794	190795	Mrs Holt	198	" Indeed , sir , no , "
190836	191060	190766	190767	Mr Transome	141	" It 's not me has any grandchild , nor ever shall have , though most fit . But with my only son saying he 'll never be married , and in prison besides , and some saying he 'll be transported , you may see yourself — though a gentleman — as there is n't much chance of my having grandchildren of my own . And this is old Master Tudge 's grandchild , as my own Felix took to for pity because he was sickly and clemm'd , and I was noways against it , being of a tender heart . For I 'm a widow myself , and my son Felix , though big , is fatherless , and I know my duty in consequence . And it 's to be wished , sir , as others should know it as are more in power and live in great houses , and can ride in a carriage where they will . And if you 're the gentleman as is the head of everything — and it 's not to be thought you 'd give up to your son as a poor widow 's been forced to do — it behoves you to take the part of them as are deserving ; for the Bible says , grey hairs should speak . "
191061	191074	191076	191078	old Mr Transome	141	" Yes , yes — poor woman — what shall I say ? "
191091	191217	191076	191078	old Mr Transome	141	" Sir , I can tell you what to say fast enough ; for it 's what I should say myself if I could get to speak to the King . For I 've asked them that know , and they say it 's the truth both out of the Bible and in , as the King can pardon anything and anybody . And judging by his countenance on the new signs , and the talk there was a while ago about his being the people 's friend , as the minister once said it from the very pulpit — if there 's any meaning in words , he 'll do the right thing by me and my son , if he 's asked proper . "
191218	191231	191233	191234	Mr Transome	141	" Yes — a very good man — he'll do anything right , "
191258	191267	191268	191268	he	141	" I 'll ask him anything you like , "
191285	191454	191455	191456	Mrs Holt	198	" Then , sir , if you 'll go in your carriage and say , This young man , Felix Holt by name , as his father was known the country round , and his mother most respectable — he never meant harm to anybody , and so far from bloody murder and fighting , would part with his victual to them that needed it more — and if you 'd get other gentlemen to say the same , and if they 're not satisifed to inquire — I'll not believe but what the King ' ud let my son out of prison . Or if it 's true he must stand his trial , the King ' ud take care no mischief happened to him . I 've got my senses , and I 'll never believe as in a country where there 's a God above and a king below , the right thing ca n't be done if great people was willing to do it . "
191549	191552	191556	191556	his	518	" Gappa , "
191701	191706	191708	191708	Esther	208	" Dear Mrs Holt , "
191710	191767	191708	191708	Esther	208	" do rest comforted . I assure you , you have done the utmost that can be done by your words . Your visit has not been thrown away . See how the children have enjoyed it ! I saw little Job actually laughing . I think I never saw him do more than smile before . "
191778	191788	191775	191775	she	208	" Will the buggy come round to this door ? "
191989	191998	192015	192015	she	208	" the young fellow 's coming off easily , "
192336	192351	192353	192354	Mr Lyon	201	" I had been encouraged by the assurances of men instructed in this regard , "
192369	192499	192357	192357	Esther	208	" that though he were pronounced guilty in regard to this deed whereinto he hath calamitously fallen , yet that a judge mildly disposed , and with a due sense of that invisible activity of the soul whereby the deeds which are the same in the outward appearance and effect , yet differ as the knife - stroke of the surgeon , even though it kill , differs from the knife - stroke of a wanton mutilator , might use his discretion in tempering the punishment , so that it would not be very evil to bear . But now it is said that the judge who cometh is a severe man , and one nourishing a prejudice against the bolder spirits who stand not in the old paths . "
192500	192513	192515	192515	Esther	208	" I am going to be present at the trial , father , "
192537	192580	192528	192528	she	208	" I mentioned to Mrs Transome that I should like to do so , and she said that she used in old days always to attend the assizes , and that she would take me . You will be there , father ? "
192581	192698	192357	192357	Esther	208	" Assuredly I shall be there , having been summoned to bear witness to Felix 's character , and to his having uttered remonstrances and warnings long beforehand whereby he proved himself an enemy to riot . In our ears , who know him , it sounds strangely that aught else should be credible ; but he hath few to speak for him , though I trust that Mr Harold Transome 's testimony will go far , if , as you say , he is disposed to set aside all minor regards , and not to speak the truth grudgingly and reluctantly . For the very truth hath a colour from the disposition of the utterer . "
192699	192711	192713	192713	Esther	208	" He is kind ; he is capable of being generous , "
192715	192826	192713	192713	Esther	208	" It is well . For I verily believe that evil - minded men have been at work against Felix . The Duffield Watchman hath written continually in allusion to him as one of those mischievous men who seek to elevate themselves through the dishonour of their party ; and as one of those who go not heart and soul with the needs of the people , but seek only to get a hearing for themselves by raising their voices in crotchety discord . It is these things that cause me heaviness of spirit : the dark secret of this young man 's lot is a cross I carry daily . "
192827	192830	192832	192832	Esther	208	" Father , "
192846	192872	192832	192832	Esther	208	" I should like to see him again , before his trial . Might I ? Will you ask him ? Will you take me ? "
192925	193028	192900	192900	his	1401	" I see nought against it , my dear child , if you arrived early enough , and would take the elderly lady into your confidence , so that you might descend from the carriage at some suitable place — the house of the Independent minister , for example — where I could meet and accompany you . I would forewarn Felix , who would doubtless delight to see your face again ; seeing that he may go away , and be , as it were , burried from you , even though it may be only in prison , and not — "
193158	193233	193153	193153	he	1438	" ' Tis a great and mysterious gift , this clinging of the heart , my Esther , whereby it hath often seemed to me that even in the very moment of suffering our souls have the keenest foretaste of heaven . I speak not lightly , but as one who hath endured . And ' tis a strange truth that only in the agony of parting we look into the depths of love . "
193675	193685	193673	193673	She	208	" a fair divided excellence , whose fulness of perfection "
194203	194290	194192	194193	Mrs Transome	145	" My dear , I shall make this house dull for you . You sit with me like an embodied patience . I am unendurable ; I am getting into a melancholy dotage . A fidgety old woman like me is as unpleasant to see as a rook with its wing broken . Do n't mind me , my dear . Run away from me without ceremony . Every one else does , you see . I am part of the old furniture with new drapery . "
194291	194296	194298	194298	Esther	208	" Dear Mrs Transome , "
194312	194321	194192	194193	Mrs Transome	145	" do you dislike my sitting with you ? "
194322	194332	194334	194335	Mrs Transome	145	" Only for your own sake , my fairy , "
194349	194361	194342	194342	her	145	" Does n't it make you shudder to look at me ? "
194362	194371	194373	194373	Esther	208	" Why will you say such naughty things ? "
194377	194423	194373	194373	Esther	208	" If you had had a daughter , she would have desired to be with you most when you most wanted cheering . And surely every young woman has something of a daughter 's feeling towards an older one who has been kind to her . "
194424	194435	194437	194438	Mrs Transome	145	" I should like you to be really my daughter , "
194448	194461	194437	194438	Mrs Transome	145	" That is something still for an old woman to hope for . "
194513	194594	194510	194510	she	208	" O , you are so good ; I shall ask you to indulge me very much . It is to let us set out very early to Loamford on Wednesday , and put me down at a particular house , that I may keep an engagement with my father . It is a private matter , that I wish no one to know about , if possible . And he will bring me back to you wherever you appoint . "
194718	194728	194730	194731	Mr Lyon	201	" I have arranged all things , my dear , "
194733	194745	194730	194731	Mr Lyon	201	" and Felix expects us . We will lose no time . "
194807	194827	194802	194803	her father	1479	" It is here that we are permitted to see Felix , my Esther . He will presently appear . "
195047	195053	195055	195055	her	208	" Miss Lyon — Esther ! "
195097	195106	195108	195109	Mr Lyon	201	" Take no heed of me , children , "
195111	195136	195108	195109	Mr Lyon	201	" I have some notes to make , and my time is precious . We may remain here only a quarter of an hour . "
195162	195178	195180	195180	Esther	208	" You are very pale ; you look ill , compared with your old self , "
195203	195215	195217	195217	Felix	198	" The fact is , I 'm not fond of prison , "
195221	195241	195217	195217	Felix	198	" but I suppose the best I can hope for is to have a good deal more of it . "
195242	195257	195259	195259	Esther	208	" It is thought that in the worst case a pardon may be obtained , "
195267	195275	195277	195277	Felix	198	" I do n't rely on that , "
195283	195320	195321	195321	he	1438	" My wisest course is to make up my mind to the very ugliest penalty they can condemn me to . If I can face that , anything less will seem easy . But you know , "
195330	195352	195321	195321	he	1438	" I never went in for fine company and cushions . I ca n't be very heavily disappointed in that way . "
195353	195365	195367	195367	Esther	208	" Do you see things just as you used to do ? "
195374	195400	195372	195372	she	208	it—"I mean — about poverty , and the people you will live among . Has all the misunderstanding and sadness left you just as obstinate ? "
195411	195428	195430	195430	Felix	198	" What — about the sort of life I should lead if I were free again ? "
195432	195457	195430	195430	Felix	198	" Yes . I ca n't help being discouraged for you by all these things that have happened . See how you may fail ! "
195478	195487	195488	195488	she	208	" Ah , I daresay I am silly , "
195493	195501	195503	195503	Felix	198	" No , you are dreadfully inspired , "
195505	195546	195503	195503	Felix	198	" When the wicked Tempter is tired of snarling that word failure in a man 's cell , he sends a voice like a thrush to say it for him . See now what a messenger of darkness you are ! "
195608	195790	195603	195603	he	4333	" But I 'm proof against that word failure . I 've seen behind it . The only failure a man ought to fear is failure in cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best . As to just the amount of result he may see from his particular work — that 's a tremendous uncertainty : the universe has not been arranged for the gratification of his feelings . As long as a man sees and believes in some great good , he 'll prefer working towards that in the way he 's best fit for , come what may . I put effects at their minimum , but I 'd rather have the minimum of effect , if it 's of the sort I care for , than the maximum of effect I do n't care for — a lot of fine things that are not to my taste — and if they were , the conditions of holding them while the world is what it is , are such as would jar on me like grating metal . "
195791	195794	195796	195796	Esther	208	" Yes , "
195803	195818	195796	195796	Esther	208	" I think I understand that now , better than I used to do . "
195861	196037	195857	195857	he	4339	" I do n't mean to be illustrious , you know , and make a new era , else it would be kind of you to get a raven and teach it to croak ' failure ' in my ears . Where great things ca n't happen , I care for very small things , such as will never be known beyond a few garrets and workshops . And then , as to one thing I believe in , I do n't think I can altogether fail . If there 's anything our people want convincing of , it is , that there 's some dignity and happiness for a man other than changing his station . That 's one of the beliefs I choose to consecrate my life to . If anybody could demonstrate to me that I was a flat for it , I should n't think it would follow that I must borrow money to set up genteelly and order new clothes . That 's not a rigorous consequence to my understanding . "
196057	196064	196066	196066	Esther	208	" You are just the same , "
196068	196072	196074	196074	Felix	198	" And you ? "
196076	196100	196074	196074	Felix	198	" My affairs have been settled long ago . But yours — a great change has come in them — magic at work . "
196101	196104	196106	196106	Esther	208	" Yes , "
196111	196114	196116	196116	Felix	198	" Well , "
196124	196169	196116	196116	Felix	198	" it 's a case of fitness that seems to give a chance sanction to that musty law . The first time I saw you , your birth was an immense puzzle to me . However , the appropriate conditions are come at last . "
196206	196214	196215	196215	he	4342	" All your tastes are gratified now , "
196220	196232	196215	196215	he	4342	" But you 'll remember the old pedagogue and his lectures ? "
196313	196317	196319	196320	Mr Lyon	201	" My children , "
196337	196345	196319	196320	Mr Lyon	201	" we have just two minutes more . "
196416	196473	196412	196412	him	4342	" I had a horrible struggle , Esther . But you see I was right . There was a fitting lot in reserve for you . But remember you have cost a great price — do n't throw what is precious away . I shall want the news that you have a happiness worthy of you . "
196514	196528	196529	196529	She	208	" Father , I am ready — there is no more to say . "
196554	196557	196558	196558	She	208	" Esther ! "
196726	196728	196704	196705	Mrs Transome	145	" engagement "

197820	197845	197810	197810	she	208	" how angry you look ! I never saw you look so angry before . It is not my father you are looking at ? "
197846	197861	197863	197863	Harold	141	" Oh no ! I am angry at something I 'm looking away from , "
197881	197887	197888	197888	he	141	" It 's that Jermyn , "
197900	197937	197888	197888	he	141	" He will thrust himself under my eyes everywhere since I refused him an interview and returned his letter . I 'm determined never to speak to him directly again , if I can help it . "
197969	197973	197964	197964	She	145	" Of course ! "

198675	198816	198817	198817	Felix	198	" My Lord , I am not going to occupy the time of the Court with unnecessary words . I believe the witnesses for the prosecution have spoken the truth as far as a superficial observation would enable them to do it ; and I see nothing that can weigh with the jury in my favour , unless they believe my statement of my own motives , and the testimony that certain witnesses will give to my character and purposes as being inconsistent with my willingly abetting disorder . I will tell the Court in as few words as I can , how I got entangled in the mob , how I came to attack the constable , and how I was led to take a course which seems rather mad to myself , now I look back upon it . "
198948	199304	199305	199305	Felix	198	" That is all I have to say for myself , my Lord . I pleaded ' Not guilty ' to the charge of Manslaughter , because I know that word may carry a meaning which would not fairly apply to my act . When I threw Tucker down , I did not see the possibility that he would die from a sort of attack which ordinarily occurs in fighting without any fatal effect . As to my assaulting a constable , it was a quick choice between two evils : I should else have been disabled . And he attacked me under a mistake about my intentions . I 'm not prepared to say I never would assault a constable where I had more chance of deliberation . I certainly should assault him if I saw him doing anything that made my blood boil : I reverence the law , but not where it is a pretext for wrong , which it should be the very object of law to hinder . I consider that I should be making an unworthy defence , if I let the Court infer from what I say myself , or from what is said by my witnesses , that because I am a man who hate drunken motiveless disorder , or any wanton harm , therefore I am a man who would never fight against authority . I hold it blasphemy to say that a man ought not to fight against authority : there is no great religion and no great freedom that has not done it , in the beginning . It would be impertinent for me to speak of this now , if I did not need to say in my own defence , that I should hold myself the worst sort of traitor if I put my hand either to fighting or disorder — which must mean injury to somebody — if I were not urged to it by what I hold to be sacred feelings , making a sacred duty either to my own manhood or to my fellow - man . And certainly , "
199317	199379	199314	199314	his	4448	" I never held it a sacred duty to try and get a Radical candidate returned for North Loamshire , by willingly heading a drunken howling mob , whose public action must consist in breaking windows , destroying hard - got produce , and endangering the lives of men and women . I have no more to say , my Lord . "
199380	199389	199391	199391	Harold	141	" I foresaw he would make a blunder , "
199424	199437	199438	199438	he	141	" I do n't mean what he said about the Radical candidate , "
199445	199574	199438	199438	he	141	" I do n't mean the last sentence . I mean that whole peroration of his , which he ought to have left unsaid . It has done him harm with the jury — they wo n't understand it , or rather will misunderstand it . And I 'll answer for it , it has soured the judge . It remains to be seen what we witnesses can say for him , to nullify the effect of what he has said for himself . I hope the attorney has done his best in collecting the evidence : I understand the expense of the witnesses is undertaken by some Liberals at Glasgow and in Lancashire , friends of Holt 's . But I suppose your father has told you . "
200041	200089	200021	200021	he	201	" Nay — would to God he were ! I should then feel that the great virtues and the pure life I have beheld in him were a witness to the efficacy of the faith I believe in and the discipline of the Church whereunto I belong . "
200967	200989	200958	200958	his	141	" Mr Jermyn was my agent then , not now : I have no longer any but hostile relations with him . "
201037	201059	201060	201060	Harold	141	" You acquiesced in the treating of the Sproxton men , as necesary to the efficient working of the reformed constituency ? "
201067	201106	201060	201060	Harold	141	" Yes ; on my return to England , before I put up for North Loamshire , I got the best advice from practised agents , both Whig and Tory . They all agreed as to electioneering measures . "

202161	202401	202144	202144	She	208	" I am Esther Lyon , the daughter of Mr Lyon , the Independent minister at Treby , who has been one of the witnesses for the prisoner . I know Felix Holt well . On the day of the election at Treby , when I had been much alarmed by the noises that reached me from the main street , Felix Holt came to call upon me . He knew that my father was away , and he thought that I should be alarmed by the sounds of disturbance . It was about the middle of the day , and he came to tell me that the disturbance was quieted , and that the streets were nearly emptied . But he said he feared that the men would collect again after drinking , and that something worse might happen later in the day . And he was in much sadness at this thought . He stayed a little while , and then he left me . He was very melancholy . His mind was full of great resolutions that came from his kind feeling towards others . It was the last thing he would have done to join in riot or to hurt any man , if he could have helped it . His nature is very noble ; he is tender - hearted ; he could never have had any intention that was not brave and good . "

203566	203593	203559	203559	he	150	" A fine girl ! something thoroughbred in the look of her . Too good for a Radical ; that 's all I have to say . "
203628	203782	203625	203625	he	150	" I tell you what , Gus ! we must exert ourselves to get a pardon for this young fellow . Confound it ! what 's the use of mewing him up for four years ? Example ? Nonsense . Will there be a man knocked down the less for it ? That girl made me cry . Depend upon it , whether she 's going to marry Transome or not , she 's been fond of Holt — in her poverty , you know . She 's a modest , brave , beautiful woman . I 'd ride a steeplechase , old as I am , to gratify her feelings . Hang it ! the fellow 's a good fellow if she thinks so . And he threw out a fine sneer , I thought , at the Radical candidate . Depend upon it , he 's a good fellow at bottom . "
203840	203849	203813	203813	he	1088	" knew Phil would be on that side . "
203951	203959	203945	203976	the North Loamshire Herald suggested , " of all shades of political opinion , " but — of as many shades as were to be found among the gentlemen of that county	4588	" of all shades of political opinion , "

205725	205733	205735	205735	Harold	141	" Let me go , you scoundrel ! "
205739	205749	205735	205735	Harold	141	" or I 'll be the death of you . "
205750	205753	205755	205755	Jermyn	169	" Do , "

205932	205940	205919	205920	the Baronet	1786	" This is a meeting of gentlemen . "
205941	205946	205947	205947	he	141	" Come , Harold , "
205956	205962	205947	205947	he	141	" come away with me . "
206257	206269	206239	206239	Harold	141	" Take the child away . Ask where my mother is . "
206383	206387	206378	206378	Her	145	" Come in . "
206610	206613	206614	206614	he	141	" Mother , "
206633	206647	206648	206648	He	141	" tell me the truth , that I may know how to act . "
206657	206663	206648	206648	He	141	" Who is my father ? "
206690	206706	206686	206686	he	141	" He has said — said it before others — that he is my father . "
207068	207084	207055	207055	Eve	249	" The woman ... she gave me of the tree , and I did eat . "
207256	207277	207278	207278	she	208	" I think I am getting that power Felix wished me to have : I shall soon see strong visions , "
207778	207786	207788	207788	Harold	141	" Do n't let me alarm you , "
207799	207833	207788	207788	Harold	141	" I suppose I carry the marks of a past agitation . It relates entirely to troubles of my own — of my own family . No one beyond is involved in them . "
207845	207848	207850	207850	Harold	141	" But , "
207868	207924	207850	207850	Harold	141	" it involves a difference in my position with regard to you ; and it is on this point that I wished to speak to you at once . When a man sees what ought to be done , he had better do it forthwith . He ca n't answer for himself to - morrow . "
207960	208043	207957	207957	he	141	" My feelings drag me another way . I need not tell you that your regard has become very important to me — that if our mutual position had been different — that , in short , you must have seen — if it had not seemed to be a matter of worldly interest , I should have told you plainly already that I loved you , and that my happiness could be complete only if you would consent to marry me . "
208106	208261	208097	208097	Harold	141	" But to - day I have heard something that affects my own position . I can not tell you what it is . There is no need . It is not any culpability of my own . But I have not just the same unsullied name and fame in the eyes of the world around us , as I believed that I had when I allowed myself to entertain that wish about you . You are very young , entering on a fresh life with bright prospects — you are worthy of everything that is best . I may be too vain in thinking it was at all necessary ; but I take this precaution against myself . I shut myself out from the chance of trying , after to - day , to induce you to accept anything which others may regard as specked and stained by any obloquy , however slight . "
208335	208377	208329	208329	himself	141	" What is to be done now is , that we should proceed at once to the necessary legal measures for putting you in possession of your own , and arranging mutual claims . After that I shall probably leave England . "
208433	208447	208429	208429	she	208	" Should you be urged — obliged to go — in any case ? "
208448	208456	208457	208457	Harold	141	" Not in every case , perhaps , "
208471	208482	208457	208457	Harold	141	" at least not for long , not for always . "
208505	208537	208498	208498	she	208	" I ca n't speak . I ca n't say anything to - night . A great decision has to be made : I must wait — till to - morrow . "
208746	208791	208740	208740	him	141	" You will be glad to hear that we shall get a very powerfully signed memorial to the Home Secretary about young Holt . I think your speaking for him helped a great deal . You made all the men wish what you wished . "
208989	208994	208984	208984	her	208	" Good - night . "
210302	210312	210297	210297	she	159	" Pray speak , madam . What has happened ? "
210313	210322	210297	210297	she	159	" The worst , Denner — the worst . "
210323	210339	210297	210297	she	159	" You are ill . Let me undress you , and put you to bed . "
210340	210363	210297	210297	she	159	" No , I am not ill . I am not going to die ! I shall live — I shall live ! "
210364	210370	210297	210297	she	159	" What may I do ? "
210371	210390	210297	210297	she	159	" Go and say I shall not dine . Then you may come back , if you will . "
210455	210475	210451	210452	Mrs Transome	145	" Go down , Denner , and find out where Harold is , and come back and tell me . "
210476	210488	210451	210452	Mrs Transome	145	" Shall I ask him to come to you , madam ? "
210489	210507	210508	210508	Denner	159	" No ; do n't dare to do it , if you love me . Come back . "
210546	210554	210527	210527	He	141	" Light the candles and leave me . "
210555	210562	210508	210508	Denner	159	" May n't I come again ? "
210563	210577	210527	210527	He	141	" No . It may be that my son will come to me . "
210578	210591	210527	210527	He	141	" May n't I sleep on the little bed in your bedroom ? "
210592	210609	210508	210508	Denner	159	" No , good Denner ; I am not ill . You ca n't help me . "
210610	210621	210527	210527	He	141	" That 's the hardest word of all , madam . "
210622	210638	210508	210508	Denner	159	" The time will come — but not now . Kiss me . Now go . "
211312	211322	211299	211299	Esther	208	" O why did n't you call me before ? "
211439	211447	211436	211436	she	145	" God has some pity on me . "
211448	211454	211456	211456	Esther	208	" Rest on my bed , "
211458	211477	211436	211436	she	145	" You are so tired . I will cover you up warmly , and then you will sleep . "
211478	211492	211436	211436	she	145	" No — tell me , dear — tell me what Harold said . "
211493	211502	211436	211436	she	145	" That he has had some new trouble . "
211503	211511	211436	211436	she	145	" He said nothing hard about me ? "
211512	211523	211436	211436	she	145	" No — nothing . He did not mention you . "
211524	211534	211436	211436	she	145	" I have been an unhappy woman , dear . "
211535	211540	211542	211542	Esther	208	" I feared it , "
211548	211572	211542	211542	Esther	208	" Men are selfish . They are selfish and cruel . What they care for is their own pleasure and their own pride . "
211573	211577	211579	211579	Esther	208	" Not all , "
211591	211598	211600	211601	Mrs Transome	145	" All I have ever loved , "
211614	211641	211603	211603	She	145	" For more than twenty years I have not had an hour 's happiness . Harold knows it , and yet he is hard to me . "
211642	211664	211666	211666	Esther	208	" He will not be . To - morrow he will not be . I am sure he will be good , "
211670	211688	211666	211666	Esther	208	" Remember — he said to me his trouble was new — he has not had time . "
211689	211699	211700	211701	Mrs Transome	145	" It is too hard to bear , dear , "
211717	211744	211709	211709	she	145	" I am old , and expect so little now — a very little thing would seem great . Why should I be punished any more ? "
211828	211853	211854	211854	she	208	" Do let me go to your own room with you , and let me undress you , and let me tend upon you , "
211864	211888	211854	211854	she	208	" It will be a very great thing to me . I shall seem to have a mother again . Do let me . "
212011	212030	212001	212001	Esther	208	" It is late , Mrs Hickes . Do you think Mr Harold is out of his room ? "
212031	212045	212001	212001	Esther	208	" Yes , a long while ; he was out earlier than usual . "
212046	212061	212001	212001	Esther	208	" Will you ask him to come up here ? Say I begged you . "
212114	212132	212106	212106	he	141	" Good God ! how ill you look ! Have you been sitting up with my mother ? "
212133	212141	212143	212143	Esther	208	" Yes . She is asleep now , "
212165	212172	212174	212174	Harold	141	" Has she told you anything ? "
212176	212205	212174	212174	Harold	141	" No — only that she is wretched . O , I think I would bear a great deal of unhappiness to save her from having any more . "
212249	212291	212232	212232	her	208	" There is nothing in all this place — nothing since ever I came here — I could care for so much as that you should sit down by her now , and that she should see you when she wakes . "
212308	212334	212297	212297	she	208	" I know you would have come . I know you meant it . But she is asleep now . Go gently before she wakes . "
212391	212413	212388	212388	she	208	" If that dear thing will marry you , Harold , it will make up to you for a great deal . "
212626	212632	212634	212634	Felix	198	" Mr Lyon at home ? "
212641	212646	212648	212648	Esther	208	" No , sir , "
212654	212668	212648	212648	Esther	208	" but Miss Lyon is , if you 'll please to walk in . "
212669	212672	212674	212674	Felix	198	" Esther ! "
212696	212703	212678	212678	They	4776	" You are out of prison ? "
212704	212723	212648	212648	Esther	208	" Yes , till I do something bad again . But you ? — how is it all ? "
212724	212730	212732	212732	Esther	208	" Oh , it is , "
212749	212793	212737	212737	she	208	" that everything is as usual : my father is gone to see the sick ; Lyddy is gone in deep despondency to buy the grocery ; and I am sitting here , with some vanity in me , needing to be scolded . "
212831	212841	212827	212827	she	208	" Are you come back to live here then ? "
212842	212845	212827	212827	she	208	" Yes . "
212846	212863	212827	212827	she	208	" You are not going to be married to Harold Transome , or to be rich ? "
212864	212867	212827	212827	she	208	" No . "
212890	212893	212895	212895	Felix	198	" Why ? "
212923	212937	212918	212918	he	4779	" I did not wish to marry him , or to be rich . "
212938	212946	212948	212948	Felix	198	" You have given it all up ? "
213038	213053	213030	213030	Felix	198	" Could you share the life of a poor man , then , Esther ? "
213054	213063	213064	213064	she	208	" If I thought well enough of him , "
213081	213103	213078	213078	her	208	" Have you considered well what it would be ? — that it will be a very bare and simple life ? "
213104	213112	213113	213113	Felix	198	" Yes — without atta of roses . "
213145	213219	213135	213135	he	4779	" And the people I shall live among , Esther ? They have not just the same follies and vices as the rich , but they have their own forms of folly and vice ; and they have not what are called the refinements of the rich to make their faults more bearable . I do n't say more bearable to me — I'm not fond of those refinements ; but you are . "
213229	213237	213220	213220	Felix	198	" It is very serious , Esther . "
213238	213245	213247	213247	Esther	208	" I know it is serious , "
213254	213291	213247	213247	Esther	208	" Since I have been at Transome Court I have seen many things very seriously . If I had not , I should not have left what I did leave . I made a deliberate choice . "
213311	213316	213317	213317	he	4779	" And these curls ? "
213337	213346	213317	213317	he	4779	" They cost nothing — they are natural . "
213347	213355	213377	213377	Esther	208	" You are such a delicate creature . "
213356	213376	213377	213377	Esther	208	" I am very healthy . Poor women , I think , are healthier than the rich . Besides , "
213386	213394	213377	213377	Esther	208	" I think of having some wealth . "
213395	213398	213400	213400	Felix	198	" How ? "
213407	213413	213400	213400	Felix	198	" What do you mean ? "
213414	213523	213524	213524	Esther	208	" I think even of two pounds a - week : one need n't live up to the splendour of all that , you know ; we might live as simply as you liked : there would be money to spare , and you could do wonders , and be obliged to work too , only not if sickness came . And then I think of a little income for your mother , enough for her to live as she has been used to live ; and a little income for my father , to save him from being dependent when he is no longer able to preach . "
213545	213567	213534	213534	she	208	" I mean — if you approve . I wish to do what you think it will be right to do . "
213602	213632	213588	213588	he	4783	" Why , I shall be able to set up a great library , and lend the books to be dog's - eared and marked with bread - crumbs . "
213638	213667	213633	213633	Esther	208	" You think you are to do everything . You do n't know how clever I am . I mean to go on teaching a great many things . "
213668	213672	213588	213588	he	4783	" Teaching me ? "
213673	213677	213678	213678	she	208	" Oh yes , "
213686	213694	213678	213678	she	208	" I shall improve your French accent . "
213695	213706	213708	213708	Felix	198	" You wo n't want me to wear a stock ? "
213718	213736	213708	213708	Felix	198	" No ; and you will not attribute stupid thoughts to me before I 've uttered them . "
213788	213825	213778	213778	his	4788	" I 'm a rough , severe fellow , Esther . Shall you never repent?—never be inwardly reproaching me that I was not a man who could have shared your wealth ? Are you quite sure ? "
213826	213830	213832	213832	Esther	208	" Quite sure ! "
213838	213863	213832	213832	Esther	208	" for then I should have honoured you less . I am weak — my husband must be greater and nobler than I am . "
213864	213874	213876	213876	Felix	198	" O , I tell you what , though ! "
213894	213919	213876	213876	Felix	198	" if you take me in that way I shall be forced to be a much better fellow than I ever thought of being . "
213920	213926	213928	213928	Esther	208	" I call that retribution , "
213975	213999	213964	213965	Mr Lyon	201	" wherein there was no bondage to questionable forms , so that he might have a more enlarged utterance of joy and supplication . "
214086	214090	214108	214109	Mr Wace	197	" more behind . "
214127	214157	214108	214109	Mr Wace	197	" It 's wonderful how things go through you — you do n't know how . I feel somehow as if I believed more in everything that 's good . "
214171	214175	214165	214165	she	198	" some reward , "
214331	214334	214329	214329	some	699	" abroad , "
