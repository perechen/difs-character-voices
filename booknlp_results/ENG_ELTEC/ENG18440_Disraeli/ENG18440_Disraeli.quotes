816	823	808	808	they	870	" By G — they're out . "
824	829	808	808	they	870	" Who told you ? "
830	839	808	808	they	870	" The best authority ; one of themselves . "
840	845	808	808	they	870	" Who — who ? "
846	877	808	808	they	870	" Paul Evelyn ; I met him as I passed Brookes ' , and he told me that Lord Grey had resigned , and the King had accepted his resignation . "
1245	1251	1253	1254	the Duke	860	" Good morning , Rigby , "
1256	1267	1269	1270	Mr. Rigby	317	" I see your Grace well , I am sure , "
1278	1287	1288	1288	he	317	" You have heard the news , gentlemen ? "
1291	1308	1288	1288	he	317	" What news ? Yes — no — that is to say — Mr. Rigby thinks — "
1309	1324	1253	1254	the Duke	860	" You know , of course , that Lord Lyndhurst is with the King ? "
1325	1330	1332	1333	Mr. Rigby	317	" It is impossible , "
1335	1345	1347	1348	the Duke	860	" I do n't think I can be mistaken , "
1351	1362	1364	1365	Mr. Rigby	317	" I will show your Grace that it is impossible , "
1367	1425	1364	1365	Mr. Rigby	317	" Lord Lyndhurst slept at Wimbledon . Lord Grey could not have seen the King until twelve o'clock ; it is now five minutes to one . It is impossible , therefore , that any message from the King could have reached Lord Lyndhurst in time for his Lordship to be at the palace at this moment . "
1426	1436	1438	1439	the Duke	860	" But my authority is a very high one , "
1441	1447	1449	1450	Mr. Rigby	317	" Authority is a phrase , "
1452	1470	1449	1450	Mr. Rigby	317	" we must look to time and place , dates and localities , to discover the truth . "
1471	1480	1484	1485	Mr. Tadpole	322	" Your Grace was saying that your authority — "
1510	1515	1517	1518	the Duke	860	" Was the highest , "
1521	1592	1517	1518	the Duke	860	" for it was Lord Lyndhurst himself . I came up from Nuneham this morning , passed his Lordship 's house in Hyde Park Place as he was getting into his carriage in full dress , stopped my own , and learned in a breath , that the Whigs were out , and that the King had sent for the Chief Baron . So I came on here at once . "
1593	1604	1606	1607	Mr. Taper	325	" I always thought the country was sound at bottom , "
1707	1720	1722	1723	Mr. Tadpole	322	" There is no doubt that there is considerable re - action , "
1725	1746	1722	1723	Mr. Tadpole	322	" The infamous conduct of the Whigs in the Amersham case , has opened the public mind more than anything . "
1747	1752	1754	1755	Mr. Taper	325	" Aldborough was worse , "
1757	1760	1762	1762	Tadpole	322	" Terrible ! "
1764	1806	1762	1762	Tadpole	322	" They said there was no use discussing the Reform Bill in our house . I believe Rigby 's great speech on Aldborough has done more towards the re - action than all the violence of all the political Unions together . "
1807	1815	1817	1818	the Duke	860	" Let us hope for the best , "
1821	1866	1817	1818	the Duke	860	" ' Tis a bold step on the part of the Sovereign , and I am free to say I could have wished it postponed ; but we must support the King like men . What say you , Rigby ? You are silent . "
1867	1912	1722	1723	Mr. Tadpole	322	" I am thinking what an unfortunate circumstance it was for the Sovereign , the country , and the party , that I did not breakfast with Lord Lyndhurst this morning , as I was nearly doing , instead of going down to Eton . "
1913	1922	1762	1762	Tadpole	322	" To Eton , and why to Eton ? "
1923	1956	1817	1818	the Duke	860	" For the sake of my young friend here ; Lord Monmouth 's grandson . By the bye , you are kinsmen . Let me present to your Grace — Mr. Coningsby . "

15776	15788	15754	15754	He	1577	" Yes , I have been there during all the row . "
15789	15798	15754	15754	He	1577	" You must have had a rare lark . "
15799	15842	15754	15754	He	1577	" Yes , if having your windows broken by a mob be a rare lark . They could not break my grandfather 's though . Monmouth House is in a court yard . All noblemen 's houses should be in court yards . "
15843	15855	15857	15857	Millbank	372	" I was glad to see it all ended very well , "
15859	15866	15868	15868	Coningsby	329	" It has not begun yet , "
15870	15873	15875	15875	Millbank	372	" What ? "
15877	15883	15875	15875	Millbank	372	" Why — the revolution . "
15884	15897	15899	15899	Millbank	372	" The Reform Bill will prevent a revolution , my father says , "
15901	15910	15912	15912	Buckhurst	362	" By Jove ! here 's the goose , "

16300	16305	16281	16281	Buckhurst	362	" Agreed — agreed ! "
17837	17854	17856	17867	a senior boy ; who was arranging a future match at cricket	1674	" It is settled , the match to - morrow shall be between Aquatics and Drybobs , "

17884	17912	17882	17882	another	1675	" He has not paid his boating money , and I say he has no right to play among the Aquatics before he has paid his money . "
17913	17932	17856	17867	a senior boy ; who was arranging a future match at cricket	1674	" Oh ! but we must have Fielding Major , he 's such a devil of a swipe . "
17933	17958	17882	17882	another	1675	" I declare he shall not play among the Aquatics if he does not pay his boating money . It is an infernal shame . "

Every heart was agitated . What boy ? When — where — how ? Who was absent ? Who had been on the river today ? Buckhurst . The report ran that Buckhurst was drowned . Great were the trouble and consternation . Buckhurst was ever much liked ; and now no one remembered anything but his good qualities . "

19023	19161	19014	19014	you	0	" But just at this moment , an increased stir and excitement were evident in the long walk ; the circle round Sedgwick opened , and there appeared Henry Sydney and Buckhurst . There was a dead silence . It was impossible that suspense could be strained to a higher pitch . The air and countenance of Sydney and Buckhurst were rather excited than mournful or alarmed . They needed no inquiries , for before they had penetrated the circle they had become aware of its cause . Buckhurst , the most energetic of beings , was of course the first to speak . Henry Sydney , indeed , looked pale and nervous ; but his companion , flushed and resolute , knew exactly how to hit a popular assembly and at once came to the point . "
19183	19210	19218	19218	Jove	375	" There was a cheer that might have been heard at Windsor Castle . Then , turning to Sedgwick , in an under tone Buckhurst added : "
19255	19306	19307	19307	You	1715	" In a few moments , the Long Walk had reassumed its usual character ; but Sedgwick , Herbert , and one or two others turned into the Playing fields where , undisturbed and unnoticed by the multitude , they listened to the promised communication of Buckhurst and Henry Sydney .

19963	20499	20500	20500	Millbank	377	" What wonderful things are events ! The least are of greater importance than the most sublime and comprehensive speculations ! In what fanciful schemes to obtain the friendship of Coningsby had Millbank in his reveries often indulged ! What combinations that were to extend over years and influence their lives ! But the moment that he entered the world of action , his pride recoiled from the plans and hopes which his sympathy had inspired . His sensibility and his inordinate self - respect were always at variance . And he seldom exchanged a word with the being whose idea engrossed his affection . And now , suddenly an event had occurred , like all events , unforeseen , which in a few brief , agitating , tumultuous moments , had singularly and utterly changed the relations that previously subsisted between him and the former object of his concealed tenderness . Millbank now stood , with respect to Coningsby , in the position of one who owes to another the greatest conceivable obligation ; a favour which time could permit him neither to forget nor to repay . Pride was a sentiment that could no longer subsist before the preserver of his life . Devotion to that being , open , almost ostentatious , was now a duty , a paramount and absorbing tie . The sense of past peril , the rapture of escape , a renewed relish for the life so nearly forfeited , a deep sentiment of devout gratitude to the Providence that had guarded over him , for Millbank was an eminently religious boy , a thought of home , and the anguish that might have overwhelmed his hearth ; all these were powerful and exciting emotions for a young and fervent mind , in addition to the peculiar source of sensibility on which we have already touched . Lord Vere , who lodged in the same house as Millbank , and was sitting by his bedside , observed as night fell that his mind wandered . The illness of Millbank , the character of which soon transpired and was soon exaggerated , attracted the public attention with increased interest to the circumstances out of which it had arisen , and from which the parties principally concerned had wished to have diverted notice . The sufferer indeed had transgressed the rules of the school by bathing at an unlicensed spot , where there were no expert swimmers in attendance , as is customary , to instruct the practice and to guard over the lives of the young adventurers . But the circumstances with which this violation of rules had been accompanied , and the assurance of several of the party that they had not themselves infringed the regulations , combined with the high character of Millbank , made the authorities not over - anxious to visit with penalties a breach of observance , which , in the case of the only proved offender , had been attended with such impressive consequences . The feat of Coningsby was extolled by all as an act of high gallantry and skill . It confirmed and increased the great reputation which he already enjoyed . "
20506	20532	20500	20500	Millbank	377	" said Buckhurst to Coningsby a few days after the accident . Henry Sydney and I are going to see him . Will you come ? "
20533	20548	20550	20550	Coningsby	329	" I think we shall be too many . I will go another day , "
20565	20571	20573	20573	Buckhurst	362	" Well , old fellow , "
20575	20602	20573	20573	Buckhurst	362	" how are you ? We should have come up before but they would not let us . And you are quite right now , eh ? "
20603	20614	20622	20623	Henry Sydney	337	" Quite ; has there been any row about it ? "
20615	20620	20622	20623	Henry Sydney	337	" All blown over , "
20625	20634	20622	20623	Henry Sydney	337	" C — y behaved like a trump . "
20635	20642	20644	20644	Millbank	377	" I have seen nobody yet , "
20646	20702	20644	20644	Millbank	377	" they would not let me till to - day . Vere looked in this morning and left me this book , but I was asleep . I hope they will let me out in a day or two . I want to thank Coningsby ; I never shall rest till I have thanked Coningsby . "
20703	20713	20715	20716	Henry Sydney	337	" Oh ! he will come to see you , "
20718	20729	20715	20716	Henry Sydney	337	" I asked him just now to come with us . "
20730	20733	20735	20735	Millbank	377	" Yes ! "
20739	20746	20735	20735	Millbank	377	" and what did he say ? "
20747	20756	20644	20644	Millbank	377	" He thought we should be too many . "
20757	20766	20768	20768	Millbank	377	" I hope I shall see him soon , "
20770	20776	20768	20768	Millbank	377	" some how or other . "
20777	20785	20787	20787	Buckhurst	362	" I will tell him to come , "
20789	20803	20805	20805	Millbank	377	" Oh ! no , no ; do n't tell him to come , "
20807	20813	20805	20805	Millbank	377	" Do n't bore him . "
20814	20829	20831	20831	Buckhurst	362	" I know he is going to play a match at fives this afternoon , "
20833	20839	20831	20831	Buckhurst	362	" for I am one . "
20840	20847	20849	20849	Millbank	377	" And who are the others ? "
20851	20856	20849	20849	Millbank	377	" Herbert and Campbell . "
20857	20865	20867	20867	Millbank	377	" Herbert is no match for Coningsby , "
20909	20939	20849	20849	Millbank	377	" Well , good bye , old fellow ; we will come and see you every day . What can we do for you ? Any books or anything ? "
20940	20948	20950	20950	Millbank	377	" If any fellow asks after me , "
20952	20986	20950	20950	Millbank	377	" tell him I shall be glad to see him . It is very dull being alone . But do not tell any fellow to come if he does not ask after me . "
21322	21326	21327	21327	I	0	" Dear Coningsby , "
21714	21838	21711	21712	Oswald Millbank	377	" About a fortnight after this nearly fatal adventure on the river , it was Montem . One need hardly remind the reader that this celebrated ceremony , of which the origin is lost in obscurity and which now occurs triennially , is the tenure by which Eton College holds some of its domains ; the waving of a flag by one of the scholars on a mount near the village of Salt Hill , and to which without doubt it gives the name , since on this day every visitor to Eton , and every traveller in its vicinity , from the monarch to the peasant , are stopped on the road by youthful brigands in picturesque costume , and summoned to contribute "
21841	22055	22056	22056	Saltbearers	1756	" in the shape of coin of the realm , to the purse collecting for the Captain of Eton , the senior scholar on the Foundation , who is about to repair to King 's College Cambridge . On this day the Captain of Eton appears in a dress as martial as his title : indeed , each sixth form boy represents in his uniform , though not perhaps according to the exact rules of the Horse Guards , an officer of the army . One is a marshal , another an ensign . There is a lieutenant , too ; and the remainder are sergeants . Each of those who are intrusted with these ephemeral commissions , has one or more attendants : the number of these varying according to his rank . These Servitors are selected , according to the wishes of the several members of the sixth form , out of the ranks of the lower boys , that is , those boys who are below the fifth form ; and all these attendants are arrayed in a variety of fancy dresses . The senior Oppidan and the senior Colleger next to the Captains of those two divisions of the school , figure also in fancy costume , and are called "
22058	22078	22079	22093	Runners , " and whose costume is also determined by the taste of the wearers	5929	" It is their business , together with the twelve senior Collegers of the fifth form , who are called "
22081	22116	22117	22117	Corporals	1757	" and whose costume is also determined by the taste of the wearers , to levy the contributions . And all the Oppidans of the fifth form , among whom ranked Coningsby , class as "
22119	22134	22117	22117	Corporals	1757	" and are severally followed by one or more lower boys , who are denominated "
22137	22302	22303	22303	I	0	" but who appear in their ordinary dress . It was a fine bright morning ; the bells of Eton and Windsor rang merrily ; everybody was astir , and every moment some gay equipage drove into the town . Gaily clustering in the thronged precincts of the College might be observed many a glistening form ; airy Greek , or sumptuous Ottoman , heroes of the Holy Sepulchre , Spanish Hidalgos who had fought at Pavia , Highland Chiefs who had charged at Culloden , gay in the tartan of Prince Charlie . The Long Walk was full of busy groups in scarlet coats , or fanciful uniforms ; some in earnest conversation , some criticising the arriving guests ; others encircling some magnificent hero , who astounded them with his slashed doublet or flowing plume . A knot of boys , sitting on the Long Walk wall with their feet swinging in the air , watched the arriving guests of the Provost . "
22308	22312	22303	22303	I	0	" said one , "
22493	22494	22487	22487	we	1765	" "
22502	22713	22496	22496	Jove	375	" exclaimed Townshend , and he jumped from the wall , and followed by his companions rushed towards the road . Two britskas , each drawn by four grey horses of mettle , and each accompanied by outriders as well mounted , were advancing at a rapid pace along the road that leads from Slough to the College . But they were destined to an irresistible check . About fifty yards before they had reached the gate that leads into Weston 's yard , a ruthless but splendid Albanian , in crimson and gold embroidered jacket , and snowy camese , started forward , and holding out his silver - sheathed yataghan commanded the postilions to stop . A Peruvian Inca on the other side of the road gave a simultaneous command , and would infallibly have transfixed the outriders with an arrow from his unerring bow , had they for an instant hesitated . The Albanian Chief then advanced to the door of the carriage , which he opened , and in a tone of great courtesy , announced that he was under the necessity of troubling its inmates for ' salt . ' There was no delay . The Lord of the equipage with the amiable condescension of a "
22717	22758	22496	22496	Jove	375	" expressed his hope that the collection would be an ample one , and as an old Etonian , placed in the hands of the Albanian his contribution , a magnificent purse furnished for the occasion and heavy with gold . "
22766	22782	22764	22764	ladies	1303	" said a very handsome young officer laughing , and taking off his cocked hat . "
22785	22802	22764	22764	ladies	1303	" exclaimed one of the ladies , turning at the voice , and starting a little . "
22810	22821	22807	22808	Mr. Coningsby	329	" Lord Eskdale paid the salt for the next carriage . "
22829	23065	22823	22823	they	1771	" he inquired , and then pulling forth a roll of bank - notes from the pocket of his pea - jacket , he wished them good morning . The courtly Provost , then the benignant Goodall , a man who though his experience of life was confined to the colleges in which he had passed his days , was naturally gifted with that rarest of all endowments , the talent of reception ; and whose happy bearing and gracious manner — a smile ever in his eye , and a lively word ever on his lip — must be recalled by all with pleasant recollections , welcomed Lord Monmouth and his friends to an assemblage of the noble , the beautiful , and the celebrated , gathered together in rooms not unworthy of them , as you looked upon their interesting walls breathing with the portraits of the heroes of whom Eton boasts — from Wotton to Wellesley . Music sounded in the quadrangle of the College in which the boys were already quickly assembling . The Duke of Wellington had arrived , and the boys were cheering a hero who was also an Eton field - marshal . From an oriel window in one of the Provost 's rooms , Lord Monmouth , surrounded by every circumstance that could make life delightful , watched with some intentness the scene in the quadrangle beneath . "
23072	23077	22823	22823	they	1771	" said Lord Monmouth ; "
23091	23275	22823	22823	they	1771	" Five hundred of the youth of England , sparkling with health , high spirits , and fancy dresses , were now assembled in the quadrangle . They formed into rank , and headed by a band of the Guards , thrice they marched round the court . Then quitting the College , they commenced their progress ' ad Montem . ' It was a brilliant spectacle to see them defiling through the playing fields ; those bowery meads ; the river sparkling in the sun ; the castled heights of Windsor , their glorious landscape ; behind them , the pinnacles of their College . The road from Eton to Salt Hill was clogged with carriages ; the broad fields as far as eye could range were covered with human beings . Amid the burst of martial music and the shouts of the multitude , the band of heroes , as if they were marching from Athens or Thebes or Sparta to some heroic deed , encircled the mount ; the ensign reaches its summit , and then amid a deafening cry of "

23294	23301	23291	23292	Lord Monmouth	328	" said Mr. Rigby to Coningsby , "

23348	23353	23346	23346	Vere	371	" said Coningsby hesitating , "
23356	23357	23358	23358	Vere	371	" "
23364	23369	23370	23370	Hum	416	" said Mr. Rigby . "

23422	23426	23412	23413	another fellow	1777	" said Coningsby , "

23476	23489	23465	23465	I	0	" said Mr. Rigby a little excited , and then he added : "

23533	23540	23523	23525	a Lancashire manufacturer	1782	" exclaimed Mr. Rigby quite agitated . "
23620	24144	23578	23578	I	0	" It was , of course , impossible for Coningsby to urge his wishes against such representations . He was disappointed — rather amazed ; but Madame Colonna having sent for him to introduce her to some of the scenes and details of Eton life , his vexation was soon absorbed in the pride of acting in the face of his companions as the cavalier of a beautiful lady , and becoming the cicerone of the most brilliant party that had attended Montem . He presented his friends , too , to Lord Monmouth , who gave them a most cordial invitation to dine with him at his hotel at Windsor , which they most warmly accepted . Buckhurst delighted the Marquess by his reckless genius . Even Lucretia deigned to appear amused ; especially when on visiting the upper school , the name of Cardiff , the title Lord Monmouth bore in his youthful days , was pointed out to her by Coningsby , cut with his grandfather 's own knife on the classic panels of that memorable wall in which scarcely a name that has flourished in our history , since the commencement of the eighteenth century , may not be observed with curious admiration . It was the humour of Lord Monmouth that the boys should be entertained with the most various and delicious banquet that luxury could devise , or money could command . For some days beforehand , orders had been given for the preparation of this festival . Our friends did full justice to their Lucullus ; Buckhurst especially , who gave his opinion on the most refined dishes with all the intrepidity of saucy ignorance , and occasionally shook his head over a glass of Hermitage or Côte Rôtie with a dissatisfaction which a satiated Sybarite could not have exceeded . Considering all things , Coningsby and his friends exhibited a great deal of self - command ; but they were gay , even to the verge of frolick . But then the occasion justified it , as much as their youth . All were in high spirits . Madame Colonna declared that she had met nothing in England equal to Montem ; that it was a Protestant Carnival ; and that its only fault was that it did not last forty days . The Prince himself was all animation , and took wine with every one of the Etonians several times . All went on flowingly until Mr. Rigby contradicted Buckhurst on some point of Eton discipline , which Buckhurst would not stand . He rallied Mr. Rigby roundly , and Coningsby , full of Champagne , and owing Rigby several years of contradiction , followed up the assault . Lord Monmouth , who liked a butt , and had a weakness for boisterous gaiety , slily encouraged the boys , till Rigby began to lose his temper and get noisy . The lads had the best of it ; they said a great many funny things , and delivered themselves of several sharp retorts ; whereas there was something ridiculous in Rigby putting forth his "
24146	24283	23578	23578	I	0	" talents against such younkers . However , he brought the infliction on himself by his strange habit of deciding on subjects of which he knew nothing , and of always contradicting persons on the very subjects of which they were necessarily masters . To see Rigby baited was more amusement to Lord Monmouth , even than Montem . Lucian Gay , however , when the affair was getting troublesome , came forward as a diversion . He sang an extemporaneous song on the ceremony of the day , and introduced the names of all the guests at the dinner , and of a great many other persons besides . This was capital ! The boys were in raptures , but when the singer threw forth a verse about Doctor Keate , the applause became uproarious . "

24390	24527	24386	24388	the NEW Generation	1793	" END OF BOOK I. It was early in November , 1834 , and a large shooting party was assembled at Beaumanoir , the seat of that great nobleman , who was the father of Henry Sydney . England is unrivalled for two things — sporting and politics . They were combined at Beaumanoir ; for the guests came not merely to slaughter the Duke 's pheasants , but to hold council on the prospects of the party , which , it was supposed by the initiated , began at this time to indicate some symptoms of brightening . The success of the Reform Ministry on their first appeal to the new constituency which they had created , had been fatally complete . But the triumph was as destructive to the victors as to the vanquished . "
24533	24605	24386	24388	the NEW Generation	1793	" prophetically exclaimed one of the fortunate cabinet , which found itself supported by an inconceivable majority of three hundred . It is to be hoped that some future publisher of private memoirs may have preserved some of the traits of that crude and short - lived Parliament , when old Cobbett insolently thrust Sir Robert from the prescriptive seat of the chief of opposition , and treasury understrappers sneered at the "
24608	24622	24386	24388	the NEW Generation	1793	" that had arrived from Ireland , little foreseeing what a high bidding that "
24625	24998	24386	24388	the NEW Generation	1793	" would eventually command . Gratitude to Lord Grey was the hustings - cry at the end of 1832 , the pretext that was to return to the new - modelled House of Commons none but men devoted to the Whig cause . The successful simulation , like everything that is false , carried within it the seeds of its own dissolution . Ingratitude to Lord Grey was more the fashion at the commencement of 1834 , and before the close of that eventful year , the once popular Reform Ministry was upset , and the eagerly sought Reformed Parliament dissolved ! It can scarcely be alleged that the public was altogether unprepared for this catastrophe . Many deemed it inevitable ; few thought it imminent . The career of the Ministry , and the existence of the Parliament had indeed from the first been turbulent and fitful . It was known from authority , that there were dissensions in the cabinet ; while a House of Commons which passed votes on subjects not less important than the repeal of a tax , or the impeachment of a judge on one night , and rescinded its resolutions on the following , certainly established no increased claims to the confidence of its constituents in its discretion . Nevertheless there existed at this period a prevalent conviction , that the Whig party by a great stroke of state , similar in magnitude and effect to that which in the preceding century had changed the dynasty , had secured to themselves the government of this country , for , at least , the lives of the present generation . And even the well informed in such matters were inclined to look upon the perplexing circumstances to which we have alluded , rather as symptoms of a want of discipline in a new system of tactics , than as evidences of any essential and deeply - rooted disorder . The startling rapidity , however , of the strange incidents of 1834 ; the indignant , soon to become vituperative , secession of a considerable section of the cabinet , some of them esteemed too at that time among its most efficient members ; the piteous deprecation of "
25003	25709	24386	24388	the NEW Generation	1793	" from lips hitherto deemed too stately for intreaty , followed by the Trades ' Union thirty thousand strong , parading in procession to Downing Street ; the Irish negociations of Lord Hatherton , strange blending of complex intrigue and almost infantile ingenuousness ; the still inexplicable resignation of Lord Althorp , hurriedly followed by his still more mysterious resumption of power , the only result of his precipitate movements being the fall of Lord Grey himself , attended by circumstances which even a friendly historian could scarcely describe as honourable to his party or dignified to himself ; latterly , the extemporaneous address of King William to the bishops ; the vagrant and grotesque Apocalypse of the Lord Chancellor ; and the fierce recrimination and memorable defiance of the Edinburgh banquet ; all these impressive instances of public affairs and public conduct had combined to create a predominant opinion that , whatever might be the consequences , the prolonged continuance of the present party in power was a clear impossibility . It is evident that the suicidal career of what was then styled the Liberal party , had been occasioned and stimulated by its unnatural excess of strength . The apoplectic plethora of 1834 was not less fatal than the paralytic tenuity of 1841 . It was not feasible to gratify so many ambitions , or to satisfy so many expectations . Every man had his double ; the heels of every placeman were dogged by friendly rivals ready to trip them up . There were even two cabinets ; the one that met in council , and the one that met in cabal . The consequence of destroying the legitimate opposition of the country was , that a moiety of the supporters of government had to discharge the duties of Opposition . Herein then we detect the real cause of all that irregular and unsettled carriage of public men , which so perplexed the nation after the passing of the Reform Act . No government can be long secure without a formidable Opposition . It reduces their supporters to that tractable number which can be managed by the joint influences of fruition and of hope . It offers vengeance to the discontented and distinction to the ambitious ; and employs the energies of aspiring spirits , who otherwise may prove traitors in a division , or assassins in a debate . The general election of 1832 abrogated the Parliamentary Opposition of England , which had practically existed for more than a century and a half . And what a series of equivocal transactions and mortifying adventures did the withdrawal of this salutary restraint entail on the party which then so loudly congratulated themselves and the country , that they were at length relieved from its odious repression ! In the hurry of existence one is apt too generally to pass over the political history of the times in which we ourselves live . The two years that followed the Reform of the House of Commons are full of instruction on which a young man would do well to ponder . It is hardly possible that he could rise from the study of these annals without a confirmed disgust for political intrigue ; a dazzling practice , apt at first to fascinate youth , for it appeals at once to our invention and our courage , but which really should only be the resource of the second - rate . Great minds must trust to great truths and great talents for their rise , and nothing else . While , however , as the autumn of 1834 advanced , the people of this country became gradually sensible of the necessity of some change in the councils of their Sovereign ; no man felt capable of predicting by what means it was to be accomplished , or from what quarry the new materials were to be extracted . The Tory party , according to these perverted views of Toryism unhappily too long prevalent in this country , was held to be literally defunct , except by a few old battered crones of office crouched round the embers of faction which they were fanning , and muttering "
25713	27566	24386	24388	the NEW Generation	1793	" in mystic whispers . It can not be supposed , indeed , for a moment , that the distinguished personage who had led that party in the House of Commons previously to the passing of the act of 1832 , ever despaired in consequence of his own career . His then time of life , the perfection , almost the prime , of manhood ; his parliamentary practice , doubly estimable in an inexperienced assembly ; his political knowledge ; his fair character and reputable position ; his talents and tone as a public speaker , which he had always aimed to adapt to the habits and culture of that middle class from which it was concluded the benches of the new Parliament were mainly to be recruited — all these were qualities , the possession of which must have assured a mind , not apt to be disturbed in its calculations by any intemperate heats , that with time and patience the game was yet for him . Unquestionably , whatever may have been insinuated , this distinguished person had no inkling that his services in 1834 might be claimed by his Sovereign . At the close of the session of that year he had quitted England with his family and had arrived at Rome , where it was his intention to pass the winter . The party charges that have imputed to him a previous and sinister knowledge of the intentions of the Court , appear to have been made not only in ignorance of the personal character , but of the real position , of the future minister . It had been the misfortune of this eminent gentleman when he first entered public life , to become identified with a political connexion , which having arrogated to itself the name of an illustrious historical party , pursued a policy , which was either founded on no principle whatever , or on principles exactly contrary to those which had always guided the conduct of the great Tory leaders . The chief members of this official confederacy were men distinguished by none of the conspicuous qualities of statesmen . They had none of the divine gifts that govern senates and guide councils . They were not orators ; they were not men of deep thought or happy resource ; or of penetrative and sagacious minds . Their political ken was essentially dull and contracted . They expended some energy in obtaining a defective blundering acquaintance with foreign affairs ; they knew as little of the real state of their own country as savages of an approaching eclipse . This factious league had shuffled themselves into power by clinging to the skirts of a great minister , the last of Tory statesmen , but who , in the unparalleled and confounding emergencies of his latter years , has been forced , unfortunately for England , to relinquish Toryism . His successors inherited all his errors without the latent genius , which in him might have still rallied and extricated him from the consequences of his disasters . His successors did not merely inherit his errors ; they exaggerated , they caricatured them . They rode into power on a spring - tide of all the rampant prejudices and rancorous passions of their time . From the King to the boor their policy was a mere pandering to public ignorance . Impudently usurping the name of that party of which nationality , and therefore universality , is the essence , these pseudo - Tories made Exclusion the principle of their political constitution , and Restriction the genius of their commercial code . The blind goddess that plays with human fortunes has mixed up the memory of these men with traditions of national glory . They conducted to a prosperous conclusion the most renowned war in which England has ever been engaged . Yet every military conception that emanated from their cabinet was branded by their characteristic want of grandeur . Chance , however , sent them a great military genius , whom they treated for a long time with indifference ; and whom they never heartily supported until his career had made him their master . His transcendent exploits and European events , even greater than his achievements , placed in the manikin grasp of the English ministry — the settlement of Europe . The act of the Congress of Vienna remains the eternal monument of their diplomatic knowledge and political sagacity . Their capital feats were the creation of two kingdoms , both of which are already erased from the map of Europe . They made no single preparation for the inevitable , almost impending , conjunctures of the East . All that remains of the pragmatic arrangements of the mighty Congress of Vienna is the mediatisation of the petty German Princes . But the settlement of Europe by the pseudo - Tories was the dictate of inspiration compared with their settlement of England . The peace of Paris found the government of this country in the hands of a body of men , of whom it is no exaggeration to say that they were ignorant of every principle of every branch of political science . As long as our domestic administration was confined merely to the raising of a revenue , they levied taxes with gross facility from the industry of a country too busy to criticise or complain . But when the excitement and distraction of war had ceased , and they were forced to survey the social elements that surrounded them ; they seemed , for the first time , to have become conscious of their own incapacity . These men , indeed , were the mere children of routine . They prided themselves on being practical men . In the language of this defunct school of statesmen , a practical man is a man who practises the blunders of his predecessors . Now commenced that Condition of England Question , of which our generation hears so much . During five - and - twenty years every influence that can develop the energies and resources of a nation had been acting with concentrated stimulation on the British Isles . National peril and national glory ; the perpetual menace of invasion , the continual triumph of conquest ; the most extensive foreign commerce that was ever conducted by a single nation ; an illimitable currency ; an internal trade supported by swarming millions , whom manufactures and inclosure bills summoned into existence ; above all , the supreme control obtained by man over mechanic power ; these are some of the causes of that rapid advance of material civilization in England , to which the annals of the world can afford no parallel . But there was no proportionate advance in our moral civilization . In the hurry - skurry of money - making , men - making and machine - making , we had altogether outgrown , not the spirit , but the organization , of our institutions . The peace came ; the stimulating influences suddenly ceased ; the people , in a novel and painful position , found themselves without guides . They went to the ministry ; they asked to be guided ; they asked to be governed . Commerce requested a code ; trade required a currency ; the unfranchised subject solicited his equal privilege ; suffering labour clamoured for its rights ; a new race demanded education . What did the ministry do ? They fell into a panic . Having fulfilled during their lives the duties of administration , they were frightened because they were called upon , for the first time , to perform the functions of government . Like all weak men , they had recourse to what they called strong measures . They determined to put down the multitude . They thought they were imitating Mr. Pitt , because they mistook disorganization for sedition . Their projects of relief were as ridiculous as their system of coercion was ruthless ; both were alike founded in intense ignorance . When we recall Mr. Vansittart with his currency resolutions ; Lord Castlereagh with his plans for the employment of labour ; and Lord Sidmouth with his plots for ensnaring the laborious ; one is tempted to imagine that the present epoch has been one of peculiar advances in political ability , and marvel how England could have attained her present pitch under a series of such governors . We should , however , be labouring under a very erroneous impression . Run over the statesmen that have figured in England since the accession of the present family , and we may doubt whether there be one , with the exception , perhaps , of the Duke of Newcastle , who would have been a worthy colleague of the councils of Mr. Percival , or the early cabinet of Lord Liverpool . Assuredly the genius of Bolingbroke and the sagacity of Walpole , would have alike recoiled from such men and such measures . And if we take the individuals who were governing England immediately before the French Revolution , one need only refer to the speeches of Mr. Pitt , and especially to those of that profound statesman and most instructed man , Lord Shelburne , to find that we can boast no remarkable superiority either in political justice or in political economy . One must attribute this degeneracy , therefore , to the long war and our insular position , acting upon men naturally of inferior abilities , and unfortunately , in addition , of illiterate habits . In the meantime , notwithstanding all the efforts of the political Panglosses who , in Evening Journals and Quarterly Reviews , were continually proving that this was the best of all possible governments , it was evident to the Ministry itself that the machine must stop . The class of Rigbys , indeed , at this period , one eminently favourable to that fungous tribe , greatly distinguished themselves . They demonstrated in a manner absolutely convincing , that it was impossible for any person to possess any ability , knowledge , or virtue , any capacity of reason , any ray of fancy or faculty of imagination , who was not a supporter of the existing administration . If any one impeached the management of a department , the public was assured that the accuser had embezzled ; if any one complained of the conduct of a colonial governor , the complainant was announced as a returned convict . An amelioration of the criminal code was discountenanced because a search in the parish register of an obscure village proved that the proposer had not been born in wedlock . A relaxation of the commercial system was denounced because one of its principal advocates was a Socinian . The inutility of Parliamentary Reform was ever obvious since Mr. Rigby was a Member of the House of Commons . To us , with our "
27568	27825	27826	27826	statemongers	1795	" newspaper every morning on our breakfast table , bringing on every subject which can interest the public mind a degree of information and intelligence which must form a security against any prolonged public misconception , it seems incredible that only five and twenty years ago the English mind could have been so ridden and hoodwinked , and that too by men of mean attainments and moderate abilities . But the war had directed the energies of the English people into channels by no means favourable to political education . Conquerors of the world , with their ports filled with the shipping of every clime , and their manufactories supplying the European continent , in the art of self - government , that art in which their fathers excelled , they had become literally children ; and Rigby and his brother hirelings were the nurses that frightened them with hideous fables and ugly words . Notwithstanding , however , all this successful mystification , the Arch - Mediocrity who presided , rather than ruled , over this Cabinet of Mediocrities , became hourly more conscious that the inevitable transition from fulfilling the duties of an administration to performing the functions of a government could not be conducted without talents and knowledge . The Arch - Mediocrity had himself some glimmering traditions of political science . He was sprung from a laborious stock , had received some training , and though not a statesman , might be classed among those whom the Lord Keeper Williams used to call "
27828	30025	27826	27826	statemongers	1795	" In a subordinate position his meagre diligence and his frigid method might not have been without value ; but the qualities that he possessed were misplaced ; nor can any character be conceived less invested with the happy properties of a leader . In the conduct of public affairs , his disposition was exactly the reverse to that which is the characteristic of great men . He was peremptory in little questions , and great ones he left open . In the natural course of events , in 1819 there ought to have been a change of government and another party in the state should have entered into office ; but the Whigs , though they counted in their ranks at that period an unusual number of men of great ability and formed indeed a compact and spirited opposition , were unable to contend against the new adjustment of borough influence which had occurred during the war , and under the protracted administration by which that war had been conducted . New families had arisen on the Tory side that almost rivalled old Newcastle himself in their electioneering management ; and it was evident that unless some re - construction of the House of Commons could be effected , the Whig party could never obtain a permanent hold of official power . Hence , from that period , the Whigs became Parliamentary Reformers . It was inevitable , therefore , that the country should be governed by the same party ; indispensable that the ministry should be renovated by new brains and blood . Accordingly , a Mediocrity , not without repugnance , was induced to withdraw , and the great name of Wellington supplied his place in council . The talents of the Duke , as they were then understood , were not exactly of the kind most required by the cabinet , and his colleagues were most careful that he should not occupy too prominent a post ; but still it was an impressive acquisition , and imparted to the ministry a semblance of renown . There was an individual who had not long entered public life , but who had already filled considerable , though still subordinate , offices . Having acquired a certain experience of the duties of administration and distinction for his mode of fulfilling them , he had withdrawn from his public charge ; perhaps because he found it a barrier to the attainment of that parliamentary reputation for which he had already shown both a desire and a capacity ; perhaps , because being young and independent , he was not over anxious irremediably to identify his career with a school of politics of the infallibility of which his experience might have already made him a little sceptical . But he possessed the talents that were absolutely wanted , and the terms were at his own dictation . Another and a very distinguished Mediocrity who would not resign , was thrust out ; and Mr. Peel became Secretary of State . From this moment dates that intimate connexion between the Duke of Wellington and the present First Minister , which has exercised a considerable influence over the career of individuals and the course of affairs . It was the sympathetic result of superior minds placed among inferior intelligences : and was , doubtless , assisted by a then mutual conviction , that the difference of age , the circumstance of sitting in different houses , and the general contrast of their previous pursuits and accomplishments , rendered personal rivalry out of the question . From this moment , too , the domestic government of the country assumed a new character , and one universally admitted to have been distinguished by a spirit of enlightened progress and comprehensive amelioration . A short time after this , a third and most distinguished Mediocrity died ; and Canning , whom they had twice worried out of the cabinet , where they had tolerated him for some time in an obscure and ambiguous position , was recalled just in time from his impending banishment , installed in the first post in the lower House and intrusted with the seals of the Foreign Office . The Duke of Wellington had coveted them , nor could Lord Liverpool have been insensible to his Grace 's peculiar fitness for such duties ; but strength was required in the House of Commons , where they had only one Secretary of State , a young man already distinguished , yet untried as a leader and surrounded by colleagues notoriously incapable to assist him in debate . The accession of Mr. Canning to the cabinet , in a position too of surpassing influence , soon led to a further weeding of the Mediocrities , and among other introductions to the memorable entrance of Mr. Huskisson . In this wise did that cabinet , once notable only for the absence of all those qualities which authorize the possession of power , come to be generally esteemed as a body of men , who for parliamentary eloquence , official practice , political information , sagacity in council , and a due understanding of their epoch , were inferior to none that had directed the policy of the empire since the Revolution . If we survey the tenour of the policy of the Liverpool Cabinet during the latter moiety of its continuance , we shall find its characteristic to be a partial recurrence to those frank principles of government which Mr. Pitt had revived during the latter part of the last century from precedents that had been set us , either in practice or in dogma , during its earlier period by statesmen , who then not only bore the title , but professed the opinions , of Tories . Exclusive principles in the constitution and restrictive principles in commerce have grown up together ; and have really nothing in common with the ancient character of our political settlement , or the manners and customs of the English people . Confidence in the loyalty of the nation , testified by munificent grants of rights and franchises , and favour to an expansive system of traffic , were distinctive qualities of the English sovereignty , until the House of Commons usurped the better portion of its prerogatives . A widening of our electoral scheme , great facilities to commerce , and the rescue of our Roman Catholic fellow - subjects from the Puritanic yoke , from fetters which have been fastened on them by English Parliaments in spite of the protests and exertions of English Sovereigns ; these were the three great elements and fundamental truths of the real Pitt system — a system founded on the traditions of our monarchy , and caught from the writings , the speeches , the councils , of those who , for the sake of these and analogous benefits , had ever been anxious that the Sovereign of England should never be degraded into the position of a Venetian Doge . It is in the plunder of the Church that we must seek for the primary cause of our political exclusion , and our commercial restraint . That unhallowed booty created a factitious aristocracy , ever fearful that they might be called upon to re - gorge their sacrilegious spoil . To prevent this they took refuge in political religionism , and paltering with the disturbed consciences or the pious fantasies of a portion of the people , they organized them into religious sects . These became the unconscious Proetorians of their ill - gotten domains . At the head of these religionists , they have continued ever since to govern , or powerfully to influence , this country . They have in that time pulled down thrones and churches , changed dynasties , abrogated and remodelled parliaments ; they have disfranchised Scotland , and confiscated Ireland . One may admire the vigour and consistency of the Whig party , and recognise in their career that unity of purpose that can only spring from a great principle ; but the Whigs introduced sectarian religion , sectarian religion led to political exclusion , and political exclusion was soon accompanied by commercial restraint . It would be fanciful to assume that the Liverpool Cabinet , in their ameliorating career , was directed by any desire to recur to the primordial tenets of the Tory party . That was not an epoch when statesmen cared to prosecute the investigation of principles . It was a period of happy and enlightened practice . A profounder policy is the offspring of a time like the present , when the original postulates of institutions are called in question . The Liverpool Cabinet unconsciously approximated to these opinions , because from careful experiment they were convinced of their beneficial tendency , and they thus bore an unintentional and impartial testimony to their truth . Like many men , who think they are inventors , they were only reproducing ancient wisdom . But one must ever deplore that this ministry , with all their talents and generous ardour , did not advance to principles . It is always perilous to adopt expediency as a guide ; but the choice may be sometimes imperative . But these statesmen took expediency for their director , when principle would have given them all that expediency insured , and much more . This ministry , strong in the confidence of the sovereign , the parliament , and the people , might , by the courageous promulgation of great historical truths , have gradually formed a public opinion , that would have permitted them to organize the Tory party on a broad , a permanent and national basis . They might have nobly effected a complete settlement of Ireland , which a shattered section of this very cabinet was forced a few years after to do partially , and in an equivocating and equivocal manner . They might have concluded a satisfactory re - construction of the third estate , without producing that convulsion with which from its violent fabrication our social system still vibrates . Lastly , they might have adjusted the rights and properties of our national industries in a manner which would have prevented that fierce and fatal rivalry that is now disturbing every hearth of the United Kingdom . We may therefore visit on the laches of this ministry the introduction of that new principle and power into our constitution which ultimately may absorb all — Agitation . This Cabinet then , with so much brilliancy on its surface , is the real parent of the Roman Catholic Association , the Political Unions , the Anti - Corn Law League . There is no influence at the same time so powerful and so singular as that of individual character . It arises as often from the weakness of the character as from its strength . The dispersion of this clever and showy ministry is a fine illustration of this truth . One morning the Arch - Mediocrity himself died . At the first blush , it would seem that little difficulty could be experienced in finding his substitute . His long occupation of the post , proved at any rate that the qualification was not excessive . But this cabinet with its serene and blooming visage had been all this time charged with fierce and emulous ambitions . They waited the signal , but they waited in grim repose . The death of the nominal leader , whose formal superiority , wounding no vanity and offending no pride , secured in their councils equality among the able , was the tocsin of their anarchy . There existed in this Cabinet two men , who were resolved immediately to be prime ministers ; a third who was resolved eventually to be prime minister , but would , at any rate occupy no ministerial post , without the lead of a House of Parliament ; and a fourth , who felt himself capable of being prime minister , but despaired of the revolution which could alone make him one ; and who found an untimely end when that revolution had arrived . Had Mr. Secretary Canning remained leader of the House of Commons under the Duke of Wellington , all that he gained by the death of Lord Liverpool was a master . Had the Duke of Wellington become Secretary of State under Mr. Canning , he would have materially advanced his political position , not only by holding the seals of a high department in which he was calculated to excel , but by becoming leader of the House of Lords . But his Grace was induced by certain court intriguers to believe that the King would send for him , and he was also aware that Mr. Peel would no longer serve under any minister in the House of Commons . Under any circumstances it would have been impossible to keep the Liverpool Cabinet together . The struggle therefore between the Duke of Wellington and "
30031	30187	30028	30029	Mr. Canning	442	" was internecine , and ended somewhat unexpectedly . And here we must stop to do justice to our friend Mr. Rigby , whose conduct on this occasion was distinguished by a bustling dexterity which was quite charming . He had , as we have before intimated , on the credit of some clever lampoons written during the Queen 's trial , which were in fact the effusions of Lucian Gay , wriggled himself into a sort of occasional unworthy favour at the palace , where he was half butt and half buffoon . Here , during the interregnum occasioned by the death , or rather inevitable retirement , of Lord Liverpool , Mr. Rigby contrived to scrape up a conviction that the Duke was the winning horse , and in consequence there appeared a series of leading articles in a notorious evening newspaper in which it was , as Tadpole and Taper declared , most "
30189	30599	27826	27826	statemongers	1795	" shown , that the son of an actress could never be tolerated as the Prime Minister of England . Not content with this , and never doubting for a moment the authentic basis of his persuasion , Mr. Rigby poured forth his coarse volubility on the subject at several of the new clubs which he was getting up in order to revenge himself for having been black - balled at Whites ' . What with arrangements about Lord Monmouth 's boroughs , and the lucky bottling of some claret which the Duke had imported on Mr. Rigby 's recommendation , this distinguished gentleman contrived to pay almost hourly visits at Apsley House , and so bullied Tadpole and Taper that they scarcely dared address him . About four and twenty hours before the result , and when it was generally supposed that the Duke was in , Mr. Rigby , who had gone down to Windsor to ask his Majesty the date of some obscure historical incident , which Rigby of course very well knew , found that audiences were impossible , that his Majesty was agitated , and learned from an humble , but secure authority , that in spite of all his slashing articles and Lucian Gay 's parodies of the Irish melodies , Canning was to be Prime Minister . This would seem something of a predicament to common minds ; there are no such things as scrapes for gentlemen with Mr. Rigby 's talents for action . He had indeed in the world the credit of being an adept in machinations , and was supposed ever to be involved in profound and complicated contrivances . This was quite a mistake . There was nothing profound about Mr. Rigby ; and his intellect was totally incapable of devising or sustaining an intricate or continuous scheme . He was indeed a man who neither felt nor thought ; but who possessed in a very remarkable degree a restless instinct for adroit baseness . On the present occasion , he got into his carriage and drove at the utmost speed from Windsor to the Foreign Office , The Secretary of State was engaged when he arrived ; but Mr. Rigby would listen to no difficulties . He rushed up stairs , flung open the door , and with agitated countenance , and eyes suffused with tears , threw himself into the arms of the astonished Mr. Canning . "
30604	30614	30615	30615	I	0	" exclaimed the devoted Rigby , in broken tones ; "
30644	32546	30637	30637	myself	0	" We have seen that at an early period of his career , Mr. Peel withdrew from official life . His course had been one of unbroken prosperity ; the hero of the University had become the favourite of the House of Commons . His retreat , therefore , was not prompted by chagrin . Nor need it to have been suggested by a calculating ambition , for the ordinary course of events was fast bearing to him all to which man could aspire . One might rather suppose , that he had already gained sufficient experience , perhaps in his Irish Secretaryship , to make him pause in that career of superficial success which education and custom had hitherto chalked out for him , rather than the creative energies of his own mind . A thoughtful intellect may have already detected elements in our social system which required a finer observation , and a more unbroken study , than the gyves and trammels of office would permit . He may have discovered that the representation of the University , looked upon in those days as the blue ribbon of the House of Commons , was a sufficient fetter without unnecessarily adding to its restraint . He may have wished to reserve himself for a happier occasion , and a more progressive period . He may have felt the strong necessity of arresting himself in his rapid career of felicitous routine , to survey his position in calmness , and to comprehend the stirring age that was approaching . For that he could not but be conscious that the education which he had consummated , however ornate and refined , was not sufficient . That age of economical statesmanship which Lord Shelburne had predicted in 1787 , when he demolished in the House of Lords Bishop Watson and the Balance of Trade ; which Mr. Pitt had comprehended , and for which he was preparing the nation when the French Revolution diverted the public mind into a stronger and more turbulent current , was again impending , while the intervening history of the country had been prolific in events which had aggravated the necessity of investigating the sources of the wealth of nations . The time had arrived when parliamentary pre - eminence could no longer be achieved or maintained by gorgeous abstractions borrowed from Burke , shallow systems purloined from De Lolme , adorned with Horatian points , or varied with Virgilian passages . It was to be an age of abstruse disquisition , that required a compact and sinewy intellect , nurtured in a class of learning not yet honoured in Colleges , and which might arrive at conclusions conflicting with predominant prejudices . Adopting this view of the position of Mr. Peel , strengthened as it is by his early withdrawal for awhile from the direction of public affairs , it may not only be a charitable , but a true estimate of the motives which influenced him in his conduct towards Mr. Canning , to conclude that he was not guided in that transaction by the disingenuous rivalry usually imputed to him . His statement in Parliament of the determining circumstances of his conduct , coupled with his subsequent and almost immediate policy , may perhaps always leave this a painful and ambiguous passage in his career ; but in passing judgment on public men , it behoves us ever to take large and extended views of their conduct ; and previous incidents will often satisfactorily explain subsequent events , which , without their illustrating aid , are involved in misapprehension , or mystery . It would seem , therefore , that Sir Robert Peel from an early period meditated his emancipation from the political confederacy in which he was implicated , and that he has been continually baffled in this project . He broke loose from Lord Liverpool ; he retired from Mr. Canning . Forced again into becoming the subordinate leader of the weakest government in Parliamentary annals , he believed he had at length achieved his emancipation , when he declared to his late colleagues after the overthrow of 1830 , that he would never again accept a secondary position in office . But the Duke of Wellington was too old a tactician to lose so valuable an ally . So his Grace declared after the Reform Bill was passed , as its inevitable result , that thenceforth the Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Commons , and this aphorism , cited as usual by the Duke 's parasites as demonstration of his supreme sagacity , was a graceful mode of resigning the preeminence which had been productive of such great party disasters . It is remarkable that the party who devised and passed the Reform Bill , and who governed the nation in consequence for ten years , never once had their Prime Minister in the House of Commons ; but that does not signify ; the Duke 's maxim is still quoted as an oracle almost equal in prescience to his famous query , How the King 's Government was to be carried on ? a question to which his Grace by this time has contrived to give a tolerably practical answer . Sir Robert Peel who had escaped from Lord Liverpool , escaped from Mr. Canning , escaped even from the Duke of Wellington in 1832 ; was at length caught in 1834 ; the victim of ceaseless intriguers , who neither comprehended his position , nor that of their country . Beaumanoir was one of those Palladian palaces , vast and ornate , such as the genius of Kent and Campbell delighted in at the beginning of the 18th century . Placed on a noble elevation , yet screened from the northern blast , its sumptuous front connected with its farspreading wings by Corinthian colonnades , — was the boast and pride of the midland counties . The surrounding gardens , equalling in extent the size of ordinary parks , were crowded with temples dedicate to abstract virtues and to departed friends . Occasionally a triumphal arch celebrated a general whom the family still esteemed a hero ; and sometimes a votive column commemorated the great statesman who had advanced the family a step in the peerage . Beyond the limits of this pleasance the hart and hind wandered in a wilderness abounding in ferny coverts and green and stately trees . The noble proprietor of this demesne had many of the virtues of his class : few of their failings . He had that public spirit which became his station . He was not one of those who avoided the exertions and the sacrifices , which should be inseparable from high position , by the hollow pretext of a taste for privacy , and a devotion to domestic joys . He was munificent , tender and bounteous to the poor , and loved a flowing hospitality . A keen sportsman , he was not untinctured by letters , and had , indeed , a cultivated taste for the fine arts . Though an ardent politician , he was tolerant to adverse opinions , and full of amenity to his opponents . A firm supporter of the corn laws , he never refused a lease . Notwithstanding there ran through his whole demeanour and the habit of his mind , a vein of native simplicity that was full of charm , his manner was finished . He never offended any one 's self - love . His good breeding , indeed , sprang from the only sure source of gentle manners — a kind heart . To have pained others would have pained himself . Perhaps too this noble sympathy may have been in some degree prompted by the ancient blood in his veins , an accident of lineage rather rare with the English nobility . One could hardly praise him for the strong affections that bound him to his hearth , for fortune had given him the most pleasing family in the world ; but , above all , a peerless wife . The Duchess was one of those women who are the delight of existence . She was sprung from a house not inferior to that with which she had blended , and was gifted with that rare beauty which time ever spares , so that she seemed now only the elder sister of her own beautiful daughters . She too was distinguished by that perfect good breeding which is the result of nature and not of education : for it may be found in a cottage , and may be missed in a palace . ' Tis a genial regard for the feelings of others that springs from an absence of selfishness . The Duchess , indeed , was in every sense a fine lady ; her manners were refined and full of dignity ; but nothing in the world could have induced her to appear bored when another was addressing or attempting to amuse her . She was not one of those vulgar fine ladies who meet you one day with a vacant stare as if unconscious of your existence , and address you on another in a tone of impertinent familiarity . Her temper , indeed , was somewhat quick , which made this consideration for the feelings of others still more admirable , for it was the result of a strict moral discipline acting on a good heart . Although the best of wives and mothers , she had some charity for her neighbours . Needing herself no indulgence , she could be indulgent ; and would by no means favour that straight - laced morality that would constrain the innocent play of the social body . She was accomplished , well read , and had a lively fancy . Add to this that sunbeam of a happy home , a gay and cheerful spirit in its mistress , and one might form some faint idea of this gracious personage . The eldest son of this house was now on the continent ; of his two younger brothers , one was with his regiment , and the other was Coningsby 's friend at Eton , our Henry Sydney . The two eldest daughters had just married , on the same day , and at the same altar ; and the remaining one , Theresa , was still a child . The Duke had occupied a chief post in the household under the late administration , and his present guests chiefly consisted of his former colleagues in office . There were several members of the late cabinet , several members of his Grace 's late boroughs , looking very much like martyrs , full of suffering and of hope . Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Taper were also there ; they too had lost their seats since 1832 ; but being men of business , and accustomed from early life to look about them , they had already commenced the combinations which on a future occasion were to bear them back to the assembly where they were so missed . Taper had his eye on a small constituency which had escaped the fatal schedules , and where he had what they called a "
32549	32846	30637	30637	myself	0	" that is to say , a section of the suffrages who had a lively remembrance of Treasury favours once bestowed by Mr. Taper , and who had not been as liberally dealt with by the existing powers . This connexion of Taper was in time to leaven the whole mass of the constituent body , and make it rise in full rebellion against its present liberal representative , who , being one of a majority of three hundred , could get nothing when he called at Whitehall , or Downing Street . Tadpole , on the contrary , who was of a larger grasp of mind than Taper , with more of imagination and device , but not so safe a man , was coquetting with a manufacturing town and a large constituency , where he was to succeed by the aid of the Wesleyans , of which pious body Tadpole had suddenly become a most fervent admirer . The great Mr. Rigby too was a guest , out of Parliament , nor caring to be in ; but hearing that his friends had some hopes , he thought he would just come down to dash them . The political grapes were sour for Mr. Rigby ; a prophet of evil , he preached only mortification and repentance and despair to his late colleagues . It was the only satisfaction left Mr. Rigby , except assuring the Duke that the finest pictures in his gallery were copies , and recommending him to pull down Beaumanoir , and rebuild it on a design with which Mr. Rigby would furnish him . The battue and the banquet were over ; the ladies had withdrawn ; and the butler placed a fresh bottle of claret on the table . "
32860	32893	32851	32851	you	1801	" said the Duke . Mr. Tadpole with some ceremony took a memorandum - book out of his pocket , amid the smiles and faint well - bred merriment of his friends . "

33521	33551	33510	33510	You	1817	" said Mr. Rigby , rather wearied of any one speaking but himself , and thereat he commenced a discourse , which was , in fact , one of his "
33553	33698	33510	33510	You	1817	" articles in petto on Church Reform , and which abounded in parallels between the present affairs and those of the reign of Charles I. Tadpole who did not pretend to know anything but the state of the registration , and Taper , whose political reading was confined to an intimate acquaintance with the Red Book and Beatson 's Political Index , which he could repeat backwards , were silenced . The Duke , who was well instructed and liked to be talked to , sipped his claret and was rather amused by Rigby 's lecture , particularly by one or two statements characterized by Rigby 's happy audacity , but which the Duke was too indolent to question . Lord Fitz - Booby listened with his mouth open , but rather bored . At length when there was a momentary pause he said : "
33715	33716	33510	33510	You	1817	" "
33723	33730	33510	33510	You	1817	" exclaimed Tadpole with a scoff . "
33735	33742	33510	33510	You	1817	" said Taper with a sneer . "
33759	33885	33751	33751	we	1820	" said the Duke . A breakfast at Beaumanoir was a meal of some ceremony . Every guest was expected to attend , and at a somewhat early hour . Their host and hostess set them the example of punctuality . ' Tis an old form rigidly adhered to in some great houses , but it must be confessed does not contrast very agreeably with the easier arrangements of establishments of less pretension and of more modern order . The morning after the dinner to which we have been recently introduced , there was one individual absent from the breakfast table whose non - appearance could scarcely be passed over without notice ; and several inquired with some anxiety , whether their host were indisposed . "
33898	33903	33904	33904	He	321	" replied the Duchess . "

Numerous were the conjectures hazarded , but the prevailing impression was , that this unforeseen event might embarrass those secret expectations of Court succour in which a certain section of the party had for some time reason to indulge . From the moment , however , of the announcement of Lord Spencer 's death , a change might be visibly observed in the tone of the party at Beaumanoir . They became silent , moody , and restless . There seemed a general , though not avowed , conviction that a crisis of some kind or other was at hand . The post too brought letters every day from town teeming with fanciful speculations , and occasionally mysterious hopes . "

35253	36313	35232	35232	Peel	367	" said Mr. Rigby . On the evening of the 15th of November , a despatch arrived at Beaumanoir , informing his Grace that the King had dismissed the Whig Ministry , and sent for the Duke of Wellington . Thus the first agitating suspense was over ; to be succeeded however by expectation still more anxious . It was remarkable that every individual suddenly found that he had particular business in London which could not be neglected . The Duke very properly pleaded his executorial duties ; but begged his guests on no account to be disturbed by his inevitable absence . Lord Fitz - booby had just received a letter from his daughter who was extremely indisposed at Brighton , and he was most anxious to reach her . Tadpole had to receive deputations from Wesleyans , and well - registered boroughs anxious to receive well - principled candidates . Taper was off to get the first job at the contingent Treasury , in favour of the Borough of Shabbyton . Mr. Rigby alone was silent ; but he quietly ordered a post - chaise at daybreak , and long before his fellow guests were roused from their slumbers , he was halfway to London , ready to give advice either at the Pavilion or Apsley House . Although it is far from improbable that , had Sir Robert Peel been in England in the autumn of 1834 , the Whig government would not have been dismissed ; nevertheless , whatever may be now the opinion of the policy of that measure ; whether it be looked on as a premature movement which necessarily led to the compact re - organization of the Liberal party , or as a great stroke of State , which , by securing at all events a dissolution of the Parliament of 1832 , restored the healthy balance of parties in the Legislature ; questions into which we do not now wish to enter ; it must be generally admitted , that the conduct of every individual eminently concerned in that great historical transaction was characterized by the rarest and most admirable quality of public life — moral courage . The Sovereign who dismissed a Ministry apparently supported by an overwhelming majority in the Parliament and the nation , and called to his councils the absent chief of a parliamentary section , scarcely numbering at that moment one hundred and forty individuals , and of a party in the country supposed to be utterly discomfited by a recent revolution ; the two ministers who in this absence provisionally administered the affairs of the kingdom in the teeth of an enraged and unscrupulous opposition , and perhaps themselves not sustained by a profound conviction , that the arrival of their expected leader would convert their provisional into a permanent position ; above all , the statesman who accepted the great charge at a time and under circumstances which marred probably the deep projects of his own prescient sagacity and maturing ambition ; were all men gifted with a high spirit of enterprise , and animated by that active fortitude which is the soul of free governments . It was a lively season , that winter of 1834 ! What hopes , what fears , and what bets ! From the day on which Mr. Hudson was to arrive at Rome to the election of the Speaker , not a contingency that was not the subject of a wager ! The people sprang up like mushrooms ; town suddenly became full . Everybody who had been in office , and everybody who wished to be in office ; everybody who had ever had anything , and everybody who ever expected to have anything ; were alike visible . All of course by mere accident ; one might meet the same men regularly every day for a month , who were only passing through town . Now was the time for men to come forward who had never despaired of their country . True , they had voted for the Reform Bill , but that was to prevent a revolution . And now they were quite ready to vote against the Reform Bill , but this was to prevent a dissolution . These are the true patriots whose confidence in the good sense of their countrymen and in their own selfishness is about equal . In the meantime , the hundred and forty threw a grim glance on the numerous waiters on Providence , and amiable trimmers , who affectionately inquired every day when news might be expected of Sir Robert . Though too weak to form a government , and having contributed in no wise by their exertions to the fall of the late , the cohort of Parliamentary Tories felt all the alarm of men , who have accidentally stumbled on some treasure - trove , on the suspicious sympathy of their new allies . But after all , who were to form the government , and what was the government to be ? Was it to be a Tory government , or an Enlightened - Spirit of the Age , Liberal - Moderate - Reform government ; was it to be a government of high philosophy or of low practice ; of principle or of expediency ; of great measures or of little men ? A government of statesmen , or of clerks ? Of Humbug or of Humdrum ? Great questions these , but unfortunately there was nobody to answer them . They tried the Duke ; but nothing could be pumped out of him . All that he knew , which he told in his curt husky manner was , that he had to carry on the King 's government . As for his solitary colleague , he listened and smiled , and then in his musical voice asked them questions in return , which is the best possible mode of avoiding awkward inquiries . It was very unfair this ; for no one knew what tone to take ; whether they should go down to their public dinners and denounce the Reform Act , or praise it ; whether the Church was to be re - modelled or only admonished ; whether Ireland was to be conquered or conciliated . "
36322	36341	36342	36342	We	1862	" said Taper to Tadpole , as they reviewed together their electioneering correspondence on the Ist of December ; "
36347	36348	36349	36349	He	1863	" "
36357	36361	36349	36349	He	1863	" said Tadpole ; "
36386	37021	36349	36349	He	1863	" At last he came ; the great man in a great position , summoned from Rome to govern England . The very day that he arrived , he had his audience with the King . It was two days after this audience ; the town , though November , in a state of great excitement ; clubs crowded , not only morning - rooms , but halls and staircases swarming with members eager to give and to receive rumours equally vain ; streets lined with cabs and chariots , grooms and horses ; it was two days after this audience that Mr. Ormsby , celebrated for his political dinners , gave one to a very numerous party . Indeed his saloons to - day , during the half - hour of gathering which precedes dinner , offered in the various groups , the anxious countenances , the inquiring voices , and the mysterious whispers , rather the character of an Exchange or Bourse than the tone of a festive society . Here might be marked a murmuring knot of grey - headed privy - counsellors who had held fat offices under Percival and Liverpool , and who looked back to the Reform Act as to a hideous dream ; there some middle - aged aspirants might be observed who had lost their seats in the convulsion , but who flattered themselves they had done something for the party in the interval by spending nothing except their breath in fighting hopeless boroughs , and occasionally publishing a pamphlet , which really produced less effect than chalking the walls . Light as air , and proud as a young peacock , tripped on his toes a young Tory , who had contrived to keep his seat in a Parliament where he had done nothing , but who thought an Under Secretaryship was now secure , particularly as he was the son of a noble Lord who had also in a public capacity plundered and blundered in the good old time . The true political adventurer , who with dull desperation had stuck at nothing , had never neglected a treasury note , had been present at every division , never spoke when he was asked to be silent , and was always ready on any subject when they wanted him to open his mouth ; who had treated his leaders with servility even behind their backs , and was happy for the day if a future Secretary of the Treasury bowed to him ; who had not only discountenanced discontent in the party , but had regularly reported in strict confidence every instance of insubordination which came to his knowledge ; might there too be detected under all the agonies of the crisis ; just beginning to feel the dread misgiving , whether being a slave and a sneak were sufficient qualifications for office , without family or connexion . Poor fellow ! half the industry he had wasted on his cheerless craft might have made his fortune in some decent trade ! In dazzling contrast with these throes of low ambition , were some brilliant personages who had just scampered up from Melton , thinking it probable that Sir Robert might want some moral lords of the bed - chamber . Whatever may have been their private fears or feelings , all however seemed smiling and significant ; as if they knew something if they chose to tell it , and that something very much to their own satisfaction . The only grave countenance that was occasionally ushered into the room belonged to some individual whose destiny was not in doubt , and who was already practising the official air that was in future to repress the familiarity of his former fellow - strugglers . "
37027	37065	36349	36349	He	1863	" said a great noble , who wanted something in the general scramble , but what he knew not ; only he had a vague feeling he ought to have something , having made such great sacrifices . "
37082	37107	36349	36349	He	1863	" said Mr. Earwig , whose whole soul was in this subaltern arrangement , of which the Minister of course had not even thought ; "

37131	37145	37146	37146	Clifford	388	" said the great noble , loving gossip though he despised the gossipper . "

37240	37261	37233	37233	you	0	" and he turned upon his heel , and met the imperturbable countenance and clear sarcastic eye of Lord Eskdale . "
37268	37278	37262	37262	You	0	" asked the great noble of his brother patrician . "

37435	37489	37423	37423	he	1047	" said Lord Eskdale , as he slowly turned away to ask Lucian Gay , whether it were true that Jenny Colon was coming over . Shortly after this , Henry Sydney 's father , who dined with Mr. Ormsby , drew Lord Eskdale into a window and said in an under tone : "
37506	37507	37510	37510	we	1875	" "
37515	37520	37521	37521	I	0	" said Lord Eskdale . "
37533	37540	37528	37528	Rigby	317	" The Duke shook his head . "
37550	37566	37548	37548	himself	367	" But at this moment Mr. Ormsby begged his Grace to lead them to dinner . "
37573	37613	37548	37548	himself	367	" It is curious to recall the vague terms in which the first projection of documents , that are to exercise a vast influence on the course of affairs or the minds of nations , is often mentioned . This "
37618	38154	37548	37548	himself	367	" was written ; and speedily ; and has ever since been talked of . We believe we may venture to assume that at no period during the movements of 1834 - 5 , did Sir Robert Peel ever believe in the success of his administration . Its mere failure could occasion him little dissatisfaction ; he was compensated for it by the noble opportunity afforded to him for the display of those great qualities , both moral and intellectual , which the swaddling - clothes of a routine prosperity had long repressed , but of which his opposition to the Reform Bill had given to the nation a very significant intimation . The brief administration elevated him in public opinion , and even in the eye of Europe ; and it is probable that a much longer term of power would not have contributed more to his fame . The probable effect of the premature effort of his party on his future position as a Minister was however far from being as satisfactory . At the lowest ebb of his political fortunes , it can not be doubted that Sir Robert Peel looked forward , perhaps through the vista of many years , to a period when the national mind arrived by reflection and experience at certain conclusions , would seek in him a powerful expositor of its convictions . His time of life permitted him to be tranquil in adversity , and to profit by its salutary uses . He would then have acceded to power as the representative of a Creed , instead of being the leader of a Confederacy , and he would have been supported by earnest and enduring enthusiasm , instead of by that churlish sufferance which is the result of a supposed balance of advantages in his favour . This is the consequence of the tactics of those short - sighted intriguers , who persisted in looking upon a revolution as a mere party struggle ; and would not permit the mind of the nation to work through the inevitable phases that awaited it . In 1834 England , though frightened at the reality of Reform , still adhered to its phrases ; it was inclined , as practical England , to maintain existing institutions ; but , as theoretical England , it was suspicious that they were indefensible . No one had arisen either in Parliament , or the Universities , or the Press , to lead the public mind to the investigation of principles ; and not to mistake , in their reformations , the corruption of practice for fundamental ideas . It was this perplexed , ill - informed , jaded , shallow generation , repeating cries which they did not comprehend , and wearied with the endless ebullitions of their own barren conceit , that Sir Robert Peel was summoned to govern . It was from such materials , ample in quantity , but in all spiritual qualities most deficient ; with great numbers , largely acred , consoled up to their chins , but without knowledge , genius , thought , truth , or faith , that Sir Robert Peel was to form a "
38163	38566	37548	37548	himself	367	" That he did this like a dextrous politician , who can deny ? Whether he realized those prescient views of a great statesman in which he had doubtless indulged , and in which , though still clogged by the leadership of 1834 , he may yet find fame for himself , and salvation for his country , is altogether another question . His difficult attempt was expressed in an address to his constituents , which now ranks among state papers . We shall attempt briefly to consider it with the impartiality of the future . The Tamworth Manifesto of 1834 was an attempt to construct a party without principles ; its basis therefore was necessarily Latitudinarianism ; and its inevitable consequence has been Political Infidelity . At an epoch of political perplexity and social alarm , the confederation was convenient , and was calculated by aggregation to encourage the timid and confused . But when the perturbation was a little subsided , and men began to inquire why they were banded together , the difficulty of defining their purpose proved that the league , however respectable , was not a party . The leaders indeed might profit by their eminent position to obtain power for their individual gratification , but it was impossible to secure their followers that which , after all , must be the great recompense of a political party , the putting in practice of their opinions ; for they had none . There was indeed a considerable shouting about what they called Conservative principles ; but the awkward question naturally arose , what will you conserve ? The prerogatives of the Crown , provided they are not exercised ; the independence of the House of Lords , provided it is not asserted ; the Ecclesiastical estate , provided it is regulated by a commission of laymen . Everything in short that is established , as long as it is\a phrase and not a fact . In the meantime , while forms and phrases are religiously cherished in order to make the semblance of a creed , the rule of practice is to bend to the passion or combination of the hour . Conservativism assumes in theory that everything established should be maintained ; but adopts in practice that everything that is established is indefensible . To reconcile this theory and this practice , they produce what they call "
38571	38832	37548	37548	himself	367	" some arrangement which has no principle and no purpose ; except to obtain a temporary pause of agitation , until the mind of the Conservatives without a guide and without an aim , distracted , tempted , and bewildered , is prepared for another arrangement , equally statesmanlike with the preceding one . Conservativism was an attempt to carry on affairs by substituting the fulfillment of the duties of office for the performance of the functions of government ; and to maintain this negative system by the mere influence of property , reputable private conduct , and what are called good connexions . Conservativism discards Prescription , shrinks from Principle , disavows Progress ; having rejected all respect for Antiquity , it offers no redress for the Present , and makes no preparation for the Future . It is obvious that for a time , under favourable circumstances , such a confederation might succeed ; but it is equally clear , that on the arrival of one of those critical conjunctures that will periodically occur in all states , and which such an unimpassioned system is even calculated ultimately to create , all power of resistance will be wanting ; the barren curse of political infidelity will paralyze all action ; and the Conservative Constitution will be discovered to be a Caput Mortuum . In the meantime , after dinner , Tadpole and Taper , who were among the guests of Mr. Ormsby , withdrew to a distant sofa , out of earshot , and indulged in confidential talk . "

44631	44645	44627	44628	the stranger	2130	" Well , according to Cervantes , they should begin in an inn . "
44646	44663	44665	44665	Coningsby	329	" I fear that the age of adventures is past as well as that of ruins , "
44667	44674	44676	44677	the stranger	2130	" Adventures are to the adventurous , "
44744	44753	44755	44755	Coningsby	329	" She does not even look at us , "
44763	44772	44755	44755	Coningsby	329	" and I dare say only a prude . "
44773	44778	44780	44781	the stranger	2130	" She is calm , "
44783	44811	44780	44781	the stranger	2130	" because she is mistress of her subject ; ' tis the secret of self - possession . She is here , as a Duchess at court . "
44835	44842	44844	44844	Coningsby	329	" ' Tis but simple fare , "
44863	44870	44872	44873	the stranger	2130	" Nay , a national dish , "
44881	44966	44872	44873	the stranger	2130	" whose fame is a proverb . And what more should we expect under a simple roof ! How much better than an omelette or a greasy olla , that they would give us in a posada ! ' Tis a wonderful country this England ! What a napkin ! How spotless ! And so sweet , I declare ' tis a perfume . There is not a princess throughout the South of Europe served with the cleanliness that meets us in this cottage . "
44967	44975	44977	44977	Coningsby	329	" An inheritance from our Saxon fathers ? "
44979	45001	44977	44977	Coningsby	329	" I apprehend the northern nations have a greater sense of cleanliness — of propriety — of what we call comfort ? "
45002	45007	45009	45010	the stranger	2130	" By no means , "
45012	45029	45009	45010	the stranger	2130	" the East is the Land of the Bath . Moses and Mahomet made cleanliness religion . "
45030	45038	45040	45040	Coningsby	329	" You will let me help you ? "
45051	45056	45058	45059	the stranger	2130	" I thank you , "
45061	45080	45082	45082	he	2130	" but it is one of my bread days . With your permission this shall be my dish , "
45093	45103	45105	45105	Coningsby	329	" ' Tis but unsavory fare after a gallop , "
45107	45120	45122	45123	the stranger	2130	" Ah ! you are proud of your bacon and your eggs , "
45126	45176	45122	45123	the stranger	2130	" but I love corn and wine . They are our chief and our oldest luxuries . Time has brought us substitutes , but how inferior ! Man has deified corn and wine ! but not even the Chinese or the Irish have raised temples to tea and potatoes . "
45177	45183	45185	45185	Coningsby	329	" But Ceres without Bacchus , "
45187	45205	45185	45185	Coningsby	329	" how does that do ? Think you , under this roof we could invoke the God ? "
45206	45218	45220	45221	the stranger	2130	" Let us swear by his body that we will try , "
45717	45721	45723	45723	Coningsby	329	" I perceive , "
45736	45769	45723	45723	Coningsby	329	" that you have great confidence in the influence of individual character . I also have some confused persuasions of that kind . But it is not the Spirit of the Age . "
45770	45787	45789	45790	the stranger	2130	" The Age does not believe in great men , because it does not possess any , "
45792	45808	45789	45790	the stranger	2130	" The Spirit of the Age is the very thing that a great man changes . "
45809	45820	45822	45822	Coningsby	329	" But does not he rather avail himself of it ? "
45824	45828	45830	45831	his companion	1182	" Parvenus do ; "
45833	45850	45830	45831	his companion	1182	" but not prophets , great legislators , great conquerors . They destroy and they create . "
45851	45863	45865	45865	Coningsby	329	" But are these times for great legislators and great conquerors ? "
45867	45874	45876	45877	the stranger	2130	" When were they more wanted ? "
45879	45912	45876	45877	the stranger	2130	" From the throne to the hovel all call for a guide . You give monarchs constitutions to teach them sovereignty , and nations Sunday - schools to inspire them with faith . "
45913	45920	45922	45922	Coningsby	329	" But what is an individual ! "
45924	45931	45922	45922	Coningsby	329	" against a vast public opinion ? "
45932	45935	45937	45938	the stranger	2130	" Divine , "
45940	46035	45937	45938	the stranger	2130	" God made Man in his own image ; but the Public is made by Newspapers , Members of Parliament , Excise Officers , Poor Law Guardians . Would Philip have succeeded , if Epaminondas had not been slain ? And if Philip had not succeeded ? Would Prussia have existed had Frederick not been born ? And if Frederick had not been born ? What would have been the fate of the Stuarts if Prince Henry had not died , and Charles I. , as was intended , had been Archbishop of Canterbury ? "
46036	46047	46049	46049	Coningsby	329	" But when men are young , they want experience , "
46051	46063	46049	46049	Coningsby	329	" and when they have gained experience , they want energy . "
46064	46071	46073	46074	the stranger	2130	" Great men never want experience , "
46076	46083	46073	46074	the stranger	2130	" But everybody says that experience — "
46084	46125	45937	45938	the stranger	2130	" Is the best thing in the world — a treasure for you , for me , for millions . But for a creative mind , less than nothing . Almost everything that is great has been done by youth . "
46126	46138	46140	46140	Coningsby	329	" It is at least a creed flattering to our years , "
46145	46148	46150	46151	the stranger	2130	" Nay , "
46153	46182	46183	46183	he	2130	" for life in general there is but one decree . Youth is a blunder ; Manhood a struggle ; old Age a regret . Do not suppose , "
46187	46676	46678	46679	the stranger	2130	" that I hold that youth is genius ; all that I say is , that genius , when young , is divine . Why the greatest captains of ancient and modern times both conquered Italy at five - and - twenty ! Youth , extreme youth , overthrew the Persian Empire . Don John of Austria won Lepanto at twenty - five — the greatest battle of modern time ; had it not been for the jealousy of Philip , the next year he would have been Emperor of Mauritania . Gaston de Foix was only twenty - two when he stood a victor on the plain of Ravenna . Every one remembers Condé and Rocroy at the same age . Gustavus Adolphus died at thirty - eight . Look at his captains : that wonderful Duke of Weimar , only thirty - six when he died . Banier himself , after all his miracles , died at forty - five . Cortes was little more than thirty when he gazed upon the golden cupolas of Mexico . When Maurice of Saxony died at thirty - two , all Europe acknowledged the loss of the greatest captain and the profoundest statesman of the age . Then there is Nelson , Clive — but these are warriors , and perhaps you may think there are greater things than war . I do not ; I worship the Lord of Hosts . But take the most illustrious achievements of civil prudence . Innocent III . the greatest of the Popes , was the despot of Christendom at thirty - seven . John de Medici was a Cardinal at fifteen , and Guicciardini tells us baffled with his state craft Ferdinand of Arragon himself . He was Pope as Leo X. at thirty - seven . Luther robbed even him of his richest province at thirty - five . Take Ignatius Loyola and John Wesley , they worked with young brains . Ignatius was only thirty when he made his pilgrimage and wrote the ' Spiritual Exercises . ' Pascal wrote a great work at sixteen , the greatest of Frenchmen and died at thirty - seven ! Ah ! that fatal thirty - seven , which reminds me of Byron , greater even as a man than a writer . Was it experience that guided the pencil of Raphael when he painted the palaces of Rome ! He died too at thirty - seven . Richelieu was Secretary of State at thirty - one . Well then , there are Bolingbroke and Pitt , both ministers before other men leave off cricket . Grotius was in great practice at seventeen , and Attorney - General at twenty - four . And Acquaviva — Acquaviva was General of the Jesuits , ruled every cabinet in Europe , and colonised America before he was thirty - seven . What a career ! "
46693	46724	46678	46679	the stranger	2130	" the secret sway of Europe ! That was indeed a position ! But it is needless to multiply instances . The history of Heroes is the history of Youth . "
46725	46728	46730	46730	Coningsby	329	" Ah ! "
46732	46742	46730	46730	Coningsby	329	" I should like to be a great man ! "
46767	46783	46757	46757	He	2130	" Nurture your mind with great thoughts . To believe in the heroic makes heroes . "
46784	46792	46794	46794	Coningsby	329	" You seem to me a hero , "
46817	46826	46828	46829	the stranger	2130	" I am , and must ever be , "
46831	46838	46828	46829	the stranger	2130	" but a dreamer of dreams . "
46861	46880	46858	46858	he	2130	" What a delicious afternoon ! I look forward to my ride with delight . You rest here ? "
46881	46895	46858	46858	he	2130	" No ; I go on to Nottingham , where I shall sleep . "
46896	46904	46906	46906	he	2130	" And I in the opposite direction . "
46915	46924	46926	46926	Coningsby	329	" I long to see your mare again , "
46928	46936	46926	46926	Coningsby	329	" She seemed to me so beautiful . "
46937	46946	46948	46949	the stranger	2130	" She is not only of pure race , "
46951	47049	46948	46949	the stranger	2130	" but of the highest and rarest breed in Arabia . Her name is ' the Daughter of the Star . ' She is a foal of that famous mare , which belonged to the Prince of the Wahabees ; and to possess which , I believe was one of the principal causes of war between that tribe and the Egyptians . The Pacha of Egypt gave her to me , and I would not change her for her statue in pure gold , even carved by Lysippus . Come round to the stable and see her . "
47081	47087	47092	47092	her	2184	" The Daughter of the Star "
47181	47188	47195	47196	the stranger	2130	" I am sorry to part . "
47189	47193	47195	47196	the stranger	2130	" I also , "
47198	47205	47195	47196	the stranger	2130	" But life is constant separation . "
47206	47214	47216	47216	Coningsby	329	" I hope we may meet again , "
47218	47226	47228	47229	the stranger	2130	" If our acquaintance be worth preserving , "
47231	47242	47228	47229	the stranger	2130	" you may be sure it will not be lost . "
47243	47251	47253	47253	Coningsby	329	" But mine is not worth preserving , "
47256	47276	47253	47253	Coningsby	329	" It is yours that is the treasure . You teach me things of which I have long mused . "
47284	47290	47228	47229	the stranger	2130	" Daughter of the Star , "
47306	47317	47319	47319	Coningsby	329	" Your mind at least is nurtured with great thoughts , "
47321	47328	47319	47319	Coningsby	329	" your actions should be heroic . "
47329	47336	47338	47339	the stranger	2130	" Action is not for me ; "
47341	47357	47358	47358	He	2130	" I am of that faith that the Apostles professed before they followed their Master . "
47365	47370	47375	47375	she	1182	" Daughter of the Star "
50346	50357	50365	50365	he	875	" It is impossible that Mr. Coningsby can remember me ? "
50396	50402	50404	50405	Lady Everingham	533	" And you walked here , "
50420	50438	50404	50405	Lady Everingham	533	" Only think , papa , Mr. Coningsby walked here ! I also am a great walker . "
50439	50448	50450	50450	Coningsby	329	" I had heard much of the forest , "
50452	50462	50464	50465	the Duke	860	" Which I am sure did not disappoint you , "
50467	50473	50475	50476	Lady Everingham	533	" But forest without adventures , "
50485	50492	50494	50494	Coningsby	329	" But I had an adventure , "
50496	50506	50508	50509	the Lady	1269	" Oh ! tell it us by all means ! "
50514	50536	50537	50537	she	533	" Adventures are my weakness . I have had more adventures than any one . Have I not had , Augustus ? "
50544	50557	50559	50560	Lord Everingham	535	" But you make everything out to be an adventure , Isabel , "
50562	50574	50559	50560	Lord Everingham	535	" I dare say that Mr. Coningsby 's was more substantial . "
50589	50597	50599	50599	Coningsby	329	" I met a most extraordinary man , "
50601	50609	50599	50599	Coningsby	329	" It should have been a heroine ! "
50614	50631	50633	50633	Coningsby	329	" Do you know anybody in this neighbourhood who rides the finest Arab in the world ? "
50635	50659	50633	50633	Coningsby	329	" She is called the ' Daughter of the Star , ' and was given to her rider by the Pacha of Egypt . "
50660	50667	50669	50670	Lady Everingham	533	" This is really an adventure , "
50673	50680	50682	50683	Lady Theresa	449	" The Daughter of the Star ! "
50685	50700	50682	50683	Lady Theresa	449	" What a pretty name ! Percy has a horse called ' Sunbeam . ' "
50701	50712	50714	50715	the Duke	860	" A fine Arab , the finest in the world ! "
50723	50729	50714	50715	the Duke	860	" Who can it be ? "
50730	50742	50744	50753	the Duchess of a young man who sat next her	2352	" Can you throw any light on this , Mr. Lyle ? "
50801	50810	50812	50813	Mr. Lyle	537	" I certainly do not know the horse , "
50815	50827	50812	50813	Mr. Lyle	537	" but if Mr. Coningsby would describe the rider , perhaps — "
50828	50837	50839	50839	Coningsby	329	" He is a man something under thirty , "
50841	50885	50839	50839	Coningsby	329	" pale , with dark hair . We met in a sort of forest inn during a storm . A most singular man ! Indeed I never met any one who seemed to me so clever , or to say such remarkable things . "
50886	50897	50899	50900	Lady Everingham	533	" He must have been the spirit of the storm , "
50902	50913	50915	50916	Lady Theresa	449	" Charles Verney has a great deal of dark hair , "
50918	50933	50915	50916	Lady Theresa	449	" But then he is anything but pale , and his eyes are blue . "
50934	50948	50950	50951	her sister	2360	" And certainly he keeps his wonderful things for your ear , Theresa , "
50953	50970	50972	50973	the Duchess	6414	" I wish that Mr. Coningsby would tell us some of the wonderful things he said , "
50976	50989	50991	50992	Henry Sydney	337	" Take a glass of wine first with my mother , Coningsby , "
51401	51406	51374	51374	he	2375	" that little half hour "
51435	51440	51419	51420	The writer	1412	" little half hour , "
51457	51461	51501	51501	she	533	" little half hour "
51485	51490	51501	51501	she	533	" very little half hour "
51518	51535	51501	51501	she	533	" Pray , do not be too long at the Board of Guardians to - day . "
51566	51582	51554	51554	his	860	" I suppose Lord Monmouth does not trouble himself much about the New Poor Law ? "
51583	51586	51588	51588	Coningsby	329	" Hardly , "
51590	51631	51588	51588	Coningsby	329	" My grandfather 's frequent absence from England , which his health I believe renders quite necessary , deprives him of the advantage of personal observation on a subject , than which I can myself conceive none more deeply interesting . "
51632	51642	51644	51645	the Duke	860	" I am glad to hear you say so , "
51647	51723	51644	51645	the Duke	860	" and it does you great credit and Henry too , whose attention I observe is directed very much to these subjects . In my time , the young men did not think so much of such things , and we suffer consequently . By the bye , Everingham , you who are a chairman of a Board of Guardians , can give me some information . Supposing a case of out - door relief — "
51724	51733	51735	51740	the son - in - law	2386	" I could not suppose anything so absurd , "
51742	51745	51747	51748	the Duke	860	" Well , "
51750	51799	51747	51748	the Duke	860	" I know your views on that subject , and it certainly is a question on which there is a good deal to be said . But would you under any circumstances give relief out of the Union even if the parish were to save a considerable sum . "
51800	51814	51816	51817	Lord Everingham	535	" I wish I knew the Union where such a system was followed , "
52507	52511	52513	52514	Lord Everingham	535	" Henry thinks , "
52516	52532	52513	52514	Lord Everingham	535	" that the people are to be fed by dancing around a May - pole . "
52533	52552	52554	52555	Lord Henry	337	" But will the people be more fed because they do not dance round a May - pole ? "
52557	52561	52563	52564	Lord Everingham	535	" Obsolete customs ! "
52566	52587	52589	52590	Lord Henry	337	" And why should dancing round a May - pole be more obsolete than holding a Chapter of the Garter ? "
52607	52612	52614	52615	his Grace	6453	" I must say , "
52617	52637	52614	52615	his Grace	6453	" that I for one deeply regret that our popular customs have been permitted to fall so into desuetude . "
52638	52649	52651	52652	Lord Everingham	535	" The Spirit of the Age is against such things , "
52654	52664	52651	52652	Lord Everingham	535	" And what is the Spirit of the Age ? "
52668	52674	52676	52677	Lord Everingham	535	" The Spirit of Utility , "
52679	52690	52692	52692	Coningsby	329	" And you think then that ceremony is not useful ? "
52695	52701	52703	52704	Lord Everingham	535	" It depends upon circumstances , "
52706	52742	52703	52704	Lord Everingham	535	" There are some ceremonies no doubt that are very proper , and of course very useful . But the best thing we can do for the labouring classes is to provide them with work . "
52743	52756	52758	52759	Lord Henry	337	" But what do you mean by the labouring classes , Everingham ? "
52761	52793	52758	52759	Lord Henry	337	" Lawyers are a labouring class for instance , and by the bye sufficiently provided with work . But would you approve of Westminster Hall being denuded of all its ceremonies ? "
52794	52802	52804	52804	Coningsby	329	" And the long vacation being abolished ? "
52806	52821	52823	52824	the Duke	860	" Theresa brings me terrible accounts of the sufferings of the poor about us , "
52830	52838	52840	52841	Lord Everingham	535	" Women think everything to be suffering ! "
52843	52855	52857	52858	the Duke	860	" How do you find them about you , Mr. Lyle ? "
52860	52871	52873	52875	the young man	2429	" I have revived the monastic customs at St. Geneviève , "
52880	52889	52873	52875	the young man	2429	" There is an almsgiving twice a week . "
52890	52904	52906	52907	the Duke	321	" I am sure I wish I could see the labouring classes happy , "
52909	52927	52929	52930	Lord Henry	337	" Oh ! pray do not use , my dear father , that phrase the labouring classes ! "
52932	53029	52929	52930	Lord Henry	337	" What do you think , Coningsby , the other day we had a meeting in this neighbourhood to vote an agricultural petition that was to comprise all classes . I went with my father , and I was made chairman of the committee to draw up the petition . Of course I described it as the petition of the nobility , clergy , gentry , yeomanry , and peasantry of the County of — ; and could you believe it , they struck out peasantry as a word no longer used , and inserted labourers . "
53030	53036	53038	53039	Lord Everingham	535	" What can it signify , "
53041	53053	53038	53039	Lord Everingham	535	" whether a man be called a labourer or a peasant ! "
53054	53061	53063	53068	his brother - in - law	2414	" And what can it signify , "
53070	53082	53063	53068	his brother - in - law	2414	" whether a man be called Mr. Howard or Lord Everingham ! "
53129	53135	53102	53103	Lord Henry	337	" that little half hour , "
53564	53566	53568	53571	the Right Honourable scribe	2452	" slashing "
53948	54164	54172	54172	Coningsby	329	" Do you remember Bucknall ? Which Bucknall ? The eldest : I saw him the other day at Nottingham ; he is in the Rifles . Do you remember that day at Sirly Hall , that Paulet had that row with Dickinson ? Did you like Dickinson ? Hum ! Paulet was a good fellow , I tell you who was a good fellow,—Paulet 's little cousin . What ! Augustus Le Grange . Oh ! I liked Augustus Le Grange . I wonder where Buckhurst is . I had a latter from him the other day . He has gone with his uncle to Paris . We shall find him at Cambridge in October . I suppose you know Millbank has gone to Oriel . Has he though ! I wonder who will have our room at Cookesley 's ? — Cookesley was a good fellow ! Oh , capital ! How well he behaved when there was that row about our going out with the hounds ! Do you remember Vere 's face ? It makes me laugh now when I think of it . I tell you who was a good fellow , Kangaroo Grey ; I liked him . I do n't know any fellow who sang a better song ! "
54165	54170	54172	54172	Coningsby	329	" By the bye , "
54174	54189	54172	54172	Coningsby	329	" what sort of fellow is Eustace Lyle ? I rather liked his look . "
54190	54201	54203	54204	Lord Henry	337	" Oh ! I will tell you all about him , "
54206	54434	54203	54204	Lord Henry	337	" He is a great ally of mine , and I think you will like him very much . It is a Roman Catholic family , about the oldest we have in the county , and the wealthiest . You see , Lyle 's father was the most violent ultra Whig , and so were all Eustace 's guardians ; but the moment he came of age , he announced that he should not mix himself up with either of the parties in the county , and that his tenantry might act exactly as they thought fit . My father thinks of course that Lyle is a Conservative , and that he only waits the occasion to come forward , but he is quite wrong . I know Lyle well , and he speaks to me without disguise . You see ' tis an old Cavalier family , and Lyle has all the opinions and feelings of his race . He will not ally himself with anti - monarchists , and democrats , and infidels , and sectarians ; at the same time why should he support a party who pretend to oppose these , but who never lose an opportunity of insulting his religion , and would deprive him , if possible , of the advantages of the very institutions which his family assisted in establishing ? "
54435	54448	54450	54450	Coningsby	329	" Why indeed ? I am glad to have made his acquaintance , "
54452	54457	54450	54450	Coningsby	329	" Is he clever ? "
54458	54463	54465	54466	Lord Henry	337	" I think so , "
54468	54526	54465	54466	Lord Henry	337	" He is the most shy fellow , especially among women , that I ever knew , but he is very popular in the county . He does an amazing deal of good , and is one of the best riders we have . My father says the very best ; bold , but so very certain . "
54527	54535	54203	54204	Lord Henry	337	" He is older than we are ? "
54536	54549	54203	54204	Lord Henry	337	" My senior by a year ; he is just of age . "
54550	54583	54585	54585	Coningsby	329	" Oh , ah ! twenty one . A year younger than Gaston de Foix when he won Ravenna , and four years younger than John of Austria when he won Lepanto , "
54589	54600	54450	54450	Coningsby	329	" I vote we go to bed , old fellow ! "
55206	55214	55219	55219	she	6414	" I can remember the old house , "
55226	55253	55219	55219	she	6414	" and I am happy to see the new one . The Duke had prepared me for much beauty , but the reality exceeds his report . "
55412	55424	55426	55427	Lord Henry	337	" See , Coningsby , this battery on the Upper Park , "
55429	55459	55426	55427	Lord Henry	337	" This did the business : how it rakes up the valley ! Sir Eustace works it himself . Mother , what a pity that Beaumanoir was not besieged ! "
55460	55465	55467	55467	Coningsby	329	" It may be , "
55469	55481	55483	55484	Lady Everingham	533	" I always fancy a siege must be so very interesting , "
55486	55493	55483	55484	Lady Everingham	533	" It must be so exciting . "
55494	55510	55512	55512	Lyle	538	" I hope the next siege may be at Beaumanoir , instead of St. Geneviève , "
55515	55542	55512	55512	Lyle	538	" as Henry Sydney has such a military predisposition . Duchess , you said the other day that you liked Malvoisie , and here is some . "
55543	55558	55560	55561	the Duchess	6414	" Now broach me a cask of Malvoisie , Bring pasty of the doe ; "
55563	55569	55560	55561	the Duchess	6414	" That has been my luncheon "
55570	55575	55577	55578	Lady Theresa	449	" A poetic repast , "
55580	55594	55596	55597	Lord Everingham	535	" Their breeds of sheep must have been very inferior in old days , "
55599	55628	55596	55597	Lord Everingham	535	" as they made such a noise about their venison . For my part , I consider it a thing as much gone by as tilts and tournaments . "
55629	55640	55642	55643	Lady Theresa	449	" I am very sorry that they have gone by , "
55645	55654	55656	55657	Lord Henry	337	" Everything has gone by that is beautiful , "
55659	55665	55667	55668	Lord Everingham	535	" Life is much easier , "
55670	55674	55676	55677	Lord Henry	337	" Life easy ! "
55679	55690	55676	55677	Lord Henry	337	" Life appears to me to be a fierce struggle . "
55691	55696	55698	55698	Coningsby	329	" Manners are easy , "
55700	55706	55698	55698	Coningsby	329	" and life is hard . "
55707	55718	55720	55721	Lord Henry	337	" And I wish to see things exactly the reverse , "
55723	55740	55720	55721	Lord Henry	337	" The means and modes of subsistence less difficult ; the conduct of life more ceremonious . "
55741	55749	55751	55752	Lord Everingham	535	" Civilization has no time for ceremony , "
55754	55762	55764	55765	his wife	1760	" How very sententious you all are , "
55767	55779	55764	55765	his wife	1760	" I want to see the hall and many other things . "
56201	56215	56217	56218	Lady Everingham	533	" One sees our host to very great advantage in his own house , "
56220	56263	56217	56218	Lady Everingham	533	" He is scarcely the same person . I have not observed him once blush . He speaks and moves with ease . It is a pity that he is not more graceful . Above all things I like a graceful man . "
56264	56268	56270	56270	Coningsby	329	" That chapel , "
56272	56278	56270	56270	Coningsby	329	" was a fine thing . "
56279	56282	56284	56285	Lady Everingham	533	" Very , "
56287	56322	56284	56285	Lady Everingham	533	" Did you observe the picture over the altar ; the Virgin with blue eyes ? I never observed blue eyes before in such a picture . What is your favourite colour for eyes ? "
56339	56371	56327	56327	he	2550	" But every one has a favourite style ; I want to know yours . Regular features — do you like regular features ? Or is it expression that pleases you ? "
56372	56387	56270	56270	Coningsby	329	" Expression ; I think I like expression . Expression must be always delightful . "
56388	56393	56284	56285	Lady Everingham	533	" Do you dance ? "
56394	56418	56327	56327	he	2550	" No , I am no great dancer . I fear I have very few accomplishments . I am very fond of fencing . "
56419	56425	56427	56428	Lady Everingham	533	" I do n't fence , "
56433	56458	56459	56459	she	533	" But I think you are right not to dance . It is not in your way . You are very ambitious I believe ? "
56462	56474	56459	56459	she	533	" I was not aware of it ; everybody is ambitious . "
56475	56531	56552	56552	he	2553	" You see I know something of your character . Henry has spoken of you to me a great deal ; long before we met — met again I should say , for we are very old friends , remember . Do you know your career very much interests me ? I like ambitious men . "
56798	56803	56805	56806	the Duchess	6414	" What is that ? "
56808	56814	56816	56817	Mr. Lyle	537	" It is almsgiving day , "
56830	56852	56816	56817	Mr. Lyle	537	" The people of the parishes with which I am connected come to St. Geneviève twice a week at this hour . "
56853	56860	56862	56863	Lord Everingham	535	" And what is your system ? "
56874	56880	56862	56863	Lord Everingham	535	" What check have you ? "
56881	56948	56816	56817	Mr. Lyle	537	" The rectors of the different parishes grant certificates to those who in their belief merit bounty according to the rules which I have established . These again are visited by my Almoner , who countersigns the certificate , and then they present it at the postern - gate . The certificate explains the nature of their necessities , and my steward acts on his discretion . "
56949	56956	56958	56959	Lady Theresa	449	" Mamma , I see them , "
56961	56977	56979	56980	Mr. Lyle	537	" Perhaps your Grace may think that they might be relieved without all this ceremony , "
56985	57026	56979	56980	Mr. Lyle	537	" But I agree with Henry and Mr. Coningsby that Ceremony is not , as too commonly supposed , an idle form , I wish the people constantly and visibly to comprehend that Property is their protector and their friend . "
57027	57037	57039	57040	the Duchess	6414	" My reason is with you , Mr. Lyle , "
57042	57049	57039	57040	the Duchess	6414	" as well as my heart . "
57208	57227	57229	57229	Lyle	537	" My fathers perilled their blood and fortunes for the cause of the Sovereignty and Church of England , "
57249	57328	57229	57229	Lyle	537	" and I inherit their passionate convictions . They were Catholics as their descendant . No doubt they would have been glad to see their ancient faith predominant in their ancient land ; but they bowed , as I bow , to an adverse and apparently irrevocable decree . But if we could not have the Church of our fathers , we honoured and respected the Church of their children . It was at least a Church ; a "
57334	57391	57229	57229	Lyle	537	" as it daily declares itself . Besides , it was our friend . When we were persecuted by Puritanic Parliaments , it was the Sovereign and the Church of England that interposed , with the certainty of creating against themselves odium and mistrust , to shield us from the dark and relentless bigotry of Calvinism . "
57392	57396	57398	57398	Coningsby	329	" I believe , "
57400	57426	57398	57398	Coningsby	329	" that if Charles I had hanged all the Catholic priests that Parliament petitioned him to execute , he would never have lost his crown . "
57427	57434	57436	57436	Lyle	537	" You were mentioning my father , "
57438	57511	57436	57436	Lyle	537	" He certainly was a Whig . Galled by political exclusion , he connected himself with that party in the state , which began to intimate emancipation . After all , they did not emancipate us . It was the fall of the Papacy in England that founded the Whig aristocracy ; a fact that must always lie at the bottom of their hearts ; and I assure you does of mine . "
57519	57523	57436	57436	Lyle	537	" continued Lyle , "
57909	57910	57911	57911	My	0	" "
57915	57919	57920	57920	you	2602	" said Coningsby , "
58010	58875	58878	58878	you	2607	" The moral influence of residence furnishes some of the most interesting traits of our national manners . The presence of this power was very apparent throughout the district that surrounded Beaumanoir . The ladies of that house were deeply sensible of the responsibility of their position ; thoroughly comprehending their duties , they fulfilled them without affectation , with earnestness , and with that effect which springs from a knowledge of the subject . The consequences were visible in the superior tone of the peasantry to that which we too often witness . The ancient feudal feeling that lingers in these sequestered haunts , is an instrument which , when skilfully wielded , may be productive of vast social benefit . The Duke understood this well ; and his family had imbibed all his views and seconded them . Lady Everingham , once more in the scene of her past life , resumed the exercise of gentle offices , as if she had never ceased to be a daughter of the house , and as if another domain had not its claims upon her solicitude . Coningsby was often the companion of herself and her sister in their pilgrimages of charity and kindness . He admired the graceful energy , and thorough acquaintance with details , with which Lady Everingham superintended schools , organized societies of relief , and the discrimination which she brought to bear upon individual cases of suffering or misfortune . He was deeply interested as he watched the magic of her manner , as she melted the obdurate , inspired the slothful , consoled the afflicted , and animated with her smiles and ready phrase , the energetic and the dutiful . Nor on these occasions was Lady Theresa seen under less favourable auspices . Without the vivacity of her sister , there was in her demeanour a sweet seriousness of purpose that was most winning ; and sometimes a burst of energy , a trait of decision , which strikingly contrasted with the somewhat over - controlled character of her life in drawing - rooms . In the society of these engaging companions , time for Coningsby glided away in a course which he sometimes wished nothing might disturb . Apart from them , he frequently felt himself pensive and vaguely disquieted . Even the society of Henry Sydney , or Eustace Lyle , much as under ordinary circumstances they would have been adapted to his mood , did not compensate for the absence of that indefinite , that novel , that strange , yet sweet excitement , which he felt , he knew not exactly how or why , stealing over his senses . Sometimes the countenance of Theresa Sydney flitted over his musing vision ; sometimes the merry voice of Lady Everingham haunted his ear . But to be their companion in ride or ramble ; to avoid any arrangement which for many hours should deprive him of their presence ; was every day with Coningsby a principal object . One day he had been out shooting rabbits with Lyle and Henry Sydney , and returned with them late to Beaumanoir to dinner . He had not enjoyed his sport , and he had not shot at all well . He had been dreamy , silent , had deeply felt the want of Lady Everingham 's conversation , that was ever so poignant and so interestingly personal to himself ; one of the secrets of her sway , though Coningsby was not then quite conscious of it . Talk to a man about himself , and he is generally captivated . That is the real way to win him . The only difference between men and women in this respect is , that most women are vain , and some men are not . There are some men who have no self - love ; but if they have , female vanity is but a trifling and airy passion compared with the vast voracity of appetite which in the sterner sex can swallow anything , and always crave for more . When Coningsby entered the drawing - room , there seemed a somewhat unusual bustle in the room , but as the twilight had descended , it was at first rather difficult to distinguish who was present . He soon perceived that there were strangers . A gentleman of pleasing appearance was near a sofa on which the Duchess and Lady Everingham were seated , and discoursing with some volubility . His phrases seemed to command attention ; his audience had an animated glance , eyes sparkling with intelligence and interest ; not a word was disregarded . Coningsby did not advance as was his custom ; he had a sort of instinct , that the stranger was discoursing of matters of which he knew nothing . He turned to a table , he took up a book , which he began to read upside downwards . A hand was lightly placed on his shoulder . He looked round , it was another stranger ; who said , however , in a tone of familiar friendliness : "
58883	59183	58878	58878	you	2607	" It was a young man about four and twenty years of age , very tall , very good looking . Old recollections , his intimate greeting , a strong family likeness , helped Coningsby to conjecture correctly who was the person who addressed him . It was , indeed , the eldest son of the Duke , the Marquess of Beaumanoir , who had arrived at his father 's unexpectedly with his friend , Mr. Melton , on their way to the north . Mr. Melton was a gentleman of the highest fashion , and a very great favourite in society . He was about thirty , good looking , with an air that commanded attention , and manners , though facile , sufficiently finished . He was very communicative , though calm , and without being witty , had at his service a turn of phrase , acquired by practice and success , which was , or which always seemed to be , poignant . The ladies seemed especially to be delighted at his arrival . He knew every thing of every body they cared about ; and Coningsby listened in silence to names which for the first time reached his ears , but which seemed to excite great interest . Mr. Melton frequently addressed his most lively observations and his most sparkling anecdotes to Lady Everingham , who evidently relished all that he said , and returned him in kind . Throughout the dinner Lady Everingham and Mr. Melton maintained what appeared a most entertaining conversation , principally about things and persons which did not in any way interest our hero ; who , however , had the satisfaction of hearing Lady Everingham in the drawing - room say in a careless tone to the Duchess : "
59202	60215	59192	59193	Mr. Melton	562	" What a confession ! What a revelation to Coningsby of his infinite insignificance ! Coningsby entertained a great aversion for Mr. Melton , but felt his spirit unequal to the social contest . The genius of the untutored inexperienced youth quailed before that of the long practised , skillful , man of the world . What was the magic of this man ? What was the secret of this ease , that nothing could disturb and yet was not deficient in deference and good taste ? And then his dress , it seemed fashioned by some unearthly artist ; yet it was impossible to detect the unobtrusive causes of the general effect that was irresistible . Coningsby 's coat was made by Stultz ; almost every fellow in the sixth form had his coats made by Stultz ; yet Coningsby fancied that his own garment looked as if it had been furnished by some rustic slopseller . He began to wonder where Mr. Melton got his boots from , and glanced at his own , which though made in St. James ' Street , seemed to him to have a cloddish air . Lady Everingham was determined that Mr. Melton should see Beaumanoir to the greatest advantage . Mr. Melton had never been there before , except at Christmas with the house full of visitors and factitious gaiety . Now he was to see the country . Accordingly there were long rides every day , which Lady Everingham called expeditions , and which generally produced some slight incident which she styled an adventure . She was very kind to Coningsby , but had no time to indulge in the lengthened conversations which he had previously found so magical . Mr. Melton was always on the scene , the monopolising hero , it would seem , of every thought , and phrase , and plan . Coningsby began to think that Beaumanoir was not so delightful a place as he had imagined . He began to think that he had stayed there perhaps too long . He had received a letter from Mr. Rigby to inform him that he was expected at Coningsby Castle at the beginning of September , to meet Lord Monmouth who had returned to England , and for grave and special reasons was about to reside at his chief seat , which he had not visited for many years . Coningsby had intended to have remained at Beaumanoir until that time ; but suddenly it occurred to him , that the Age of Ruins was past , and that he ought to seize the opportunity of visiting Manchester , which was in the same county as the Castle of his grandfather . So difficult is it to speculate upon events ! Muse as we may , we are the creatures of circumstances ; and the unexpected arrival of a London dandy at the country seat of an English nobleman sent this representative of the New Generation , fresh from Eton , nursed in prejudices , yet with a mind predisposed to inquiry and prone to meditation , to a scene apt to stimulate both intellectual processes ; which demanded investigation and induced thought — the great Metropolis of Labour . A great city , whose image dwells in the memory of man , is the type of some great idea . Rome represents Conquest ; Faith hovers over the towers of Jerusalem ; and Athens embodies the pre - eminent quality of the antique world — Art . In modern ages , Commerce has created London ; while Manners , in the most comprehensive sense of the word , have long found a supreme capital in the airy and bright - minded city of the Seine . What Art was to the ancient world , Science is to the modern : the distinctive faculty . In the minds of men the useful has succeeded to the beautiful . Instead of the city of the Violet Crown , a Lancashire village has expanded into a mighty region of factories and warehouses . Yet rightly understood , Manchester is as great a human exploit as Athens . The inhabitants indeed are not as impressed with their idiosyncrasy as the countrymen of Pericles and Phidias . They do not fully comprehend the position which they occupy . It is the philosopher alone who can comprehend the inconceivable grandeur of Manchester , and the immensity of its future . There are yet great truths to tell , if we had either the courage to announce or the temper to receive them . A feeling of melancholy , even of uneasiness , attends our first entrance into a great town , especially at night . Is it that the sense of all this vast existence with which we have no connexion , where we are utterly unknown , oppresses us with our insignificance ? Is it that it is terrible to feel friendless where all have friends ? Yet reverse the picture . Behold a community where you are unknown , but where you will be known , perhaps honoured . A place where you have no friends , but where also you have no enemies . A spot that has hitherto been a blank in your thoughts , as you have been a cipher in its sensations , and yet a spot perhaps pregnant with your destiny ! There is perhaps no act of memory so profoundly interesting as to recall the careless mood and moment in which we have entered a town , a house , a chamber , on the eve of an acquaintance or an event , that have given a colour and an impulse to our future life . What is this Fatality that men worship ? Is it a Goddess ? Unquestionably it is a power that acts mainly by female agents . Women are the Priestesses of Predestination . Man conceives Fortune , but Woman conducts it . It is the Spirit of Man that says , "
60221	61344	60216	60216	I	0	" but it is the Sympathy of Woman that usually makes him so . It was not the comely and courteous hostess of the Adelphi Hotel , Manchester , that gave occasion to these remarks , though she may deserve them , and though she was most kind to our Coningsby as he came in late at night very tired , and not in very good humour . He had travelled the whole day through the great district of labour , his mind excited by strange sights , and at length wearied by their multiplication . He had passed over the plains where iron and coal supersede turf and corn , dingy as the entrance of Hades , and flaming with furnaces ; and now he was among illumined factories with more windows than Italian palaces , and smoking chimneys taller than Egyptian obelisks . Alone in the great metropolis of machinery itself , sitting down in a solitary coffee - room glaring with gas , with no appetite , a whirling head , and not a plan or purpose for the morrow . And why was he here ? Because a being , whose name even was unknown to him , had met him in a hedge ale - house during a thunder storm , and told him that the Age of Ruins was past . Remarkable instance of the influence of an individual ; some evidence of the extreme susceptibility of our hero . Even his bed - room was lit by gas . Wonderful city ! That however could be got rid of . He opened the window . The summer air was sweet , even in this land of smoke and toil . He feels a sensation such as in Lisbon or Lima precedes an earthquake . The house appears to quiver . It is a sympathetic affection occasioned by a steam - engine in a neighbouring factory . Notwithstanding however all these novel incidents , Coningsby slept the deep sleep of youth and health , of a brain , which however occasionally perplexed by thought , had never been harassed by anxiety . He rose early , freshened and in fine spirits . And by the time the deviled chicken and the buttered toast , that mysterious and incomparable luxury , which only can be obtained at an inn , had disappeared , he felt all the delightful excitement of travel . And now for action ! Not a letter had Coningsby , not an individual in that vast city was known to him . He went to consult his kind hostess , who smiled confidence . He was to mention her name at one place , his own at another . All would be right ; she seemed to have reliance in the destiny of such a nice young man . He saw all ; they were kind and hospitable to the young stranger , whose thought , and earnestness , and gentle manners , attracted them . One recommended him to another ; all tried to aid and to assist him . He entered chambers vaster than are told of in Arabian fable , and peopled with habitants more wondrous than Afrite or Peri . For there he beheld , in long - continued ranks , those mysterious forms full of existence without life , that perform with facility and in an instant , what man can fulfil only with difficulty and in days . A machine is a slave that neither brings nor bears degradation : it is a being endowed with the greatest degree of energy and acting under the greatest degree of excitement , yet free at the same time from all passion and emotion . It is therefore not only a slave , but a supernatural slave . And why should one say that the machine does not live ? It breathes , for its breath forms the atmosphere of some towns . It moves with more regularity than man . And has it not a voice . Does not the spindle sing like a merry girl at her work , and the steam - engine roar in jolly chorus like a strong artizan handling his lusty tools , and gaining a fair day 's wages for a fair day 's toil ? Nor should the weaving - room be forgotten , where a thousand or fifteen hundred girls may be observed in their coral necklaces working like Penelope in the day time ; some pretty , some pert , some graceful and jocund , some absorbed in their occupation ; a little serious some , few sad . And the cotton you have observed in its rude state , that you have seen the silent spinner change into thread , and the bustling weaver convert into cloth , you may now watch as in a moment it is tinted with beautiful colours , or printed with fanciful patterns . And yet the mystery of mysteries is to view machines making machines ; a spectacle that fills the mind with curious , and even awful , speculation . From early morn to the late twilight , our Coningsby for several days devoted himself to the comprehension of Manchester . It was to him a new world pregnant with new ideas , and suggestive of new trains of thought and feeling . In this unprecedented partnership between capital and science , working on a spot which Nature had indicated as the fitting theatre of their exploits , he beheld a great source of the wealth of nations which had been reserved for these times , and he perceived that this wealth was rapidly developing classes whose power was very imperfectly recognised in the constitutional scheme , and whose duties in the social system seemed altogether omitted . Young as he was , the bent of his mind , and the inquisitive spirit of the times , had sufficiently prepared him , not indeed to grapple with these questions , but to be sensible of their existence , and to ponder . One evening , in the coffee - room of the hotel , having just finished his well - earned dinner , and relaxing his mind for the moment in a fresh research into the Manchester Guide , an individual , who had also been dining in the same apartment , rose from his table , and after lolling over the empty fire - place , reading the framed announcements , looking at the directions of several letters waiting there for their owners ; picking his teeth , he turned round to Coningsby and with an air of uneasy familiarity , said , "

62590	62819	62582	62582	My	0	" And he presented Coningsby with his card as he wished him good night . MR . G. O. A. HEAD , Staley Bridge . In a green valley of Lancaster , contiguous to that district of factories on which we have already touched , a clear and powerful stream flows through a broad meadow land . Upon its margin , adorned , rather than shadowed , by some very old elm trees , for they are too distant to serve except for ornament , rises a vast deep red brick pile which , though formal and monotonous in its general character , is not without a certain beauty of proportion and an artist - like finish in its occasional masonry . The front which is of great extent , and covered with many tiers of small windows , is flanked by two projecting wings in the same style , which form a large court , completed by a dwarf wall crowned with a light and rather elegant railing ; in the centre , the principal entrance , a lofty portal of bold and beautiful design , surmounted by a statue of Commerce . This building , not without a degree of dignity , is what is technically and not very felicitously called a mill ; always translated by the French in their accounts of our manufacturing riots , "
62821	63217	63218	63218	Your	2660	" ; and which really was the principal factory of Oswald Millbank , the father of that youth , whom we trust our readers have not quite forgotten . At some little distance , and rather withdrawn from the principal stream , were two other smaller structures of the same style . About a quarter of a mile further on , appeared a village of not inconsiderable size , and remarkable from the neatness and even picturesque character of its architecture , and the gay gardens that surrounded it . On a sunny knoll in the back ground rose a church in the best style of Christian architecture , and near it was a clerical residence and a school - house of similar design . The village too could boast of another public building ; an Institute where there were a library and a lecture - room ; and a reading hall which any one might frequent at certain hours , and under reasonable regulations . On the other side of the principal factory , but more remote , about half - a - mile indeed up the valley , surrounded by beautiful meadows , and built on an agreeable and well - wooded elevation was the mansion of the mill - owner ; apparently a commodious and not inconsiderable dwellinghouse , built in what is called the villa - style , with a variety of gardens and conservatories . The atmosphere of this somewhat striking settlement was not disturbed and polluted by the dark vapour , which to the shame of Manchester still infests that great town , for the river of the valley was a motive power which rendered the steam - engine unnecessary , though doubtless had its presence been inevitable , Mr. Millbank , unlike the inhabitants of Manchester , would have taken care to consume his own smoke . The sun was declining when Coningsby arrived at Millbank , and the gratification which he experienced on first beholding it was not a little diminished , when on inquiring at the village , he was informed that the hour was past for seeing the works . Determined not to relinquish his purpose without a struggle , he repaired to the principal mill , and entered the counting - house , which was situated in one of the wings of the building . "
63223	63238	63218	63218	Your	2660	" said one of three individuals sitting on high stools behind a high desk . "
63250	63251	63218	63218	Your	2660	" "
63257	63269	63255	63255	sir	5702	" and the clerk withdrawing his glance , continued his writing . "
63286	63287	63288	63288	I	0	" "
63293	63297	63288	63288	I	0	" said Coningsby . "

63327	63331	63320	63321	Mr. Millbank	377	" said Coningsby . "
63353	63377	63379	63379	his	377	" He pointed to an inner counting - house , and the glass doors permitted Coningsby to observe several individuals in close converse . "
63388	63392	63393	63394	Mr. Oswald	377	" inquired Coningsby . "
63399	63404	63393	63394	Mr. Oswald	377	" said the clerk . "
63443	63444	63416	63441	a friend of his son 's at Eton is here , and here only for a day , and wishes very much to see his works	2669	" "
63472	63529	63470	63470	yourself	5702	" Coningsby was content to sit down , though he grew very impatient at the end of a quarter of an hour . The ticking of the clock , the scratching of the pens of the three silent clerks , irritated him . At length voices were heard , doors opened , and a clerk said : "
63537	63668	63530	63531	Mr. Millbank	377	" but nobody came ; voices became hushed , doors were again shut ; again nothing was heard , save ticking of clock and scratching of pen . At length there was a general stir , and they all did come forth , Mr. Millbank among them , a well - proportioned , comely man , with a fair face inclining to ruddiness , a quick , glancing , hazel eye , the whitest teeth , and short , curly , chestnut hair , here and there slightly tinged with grey . It was a visage of energy and decision . He was about to pass through the counting - house with his companions with whom his affairs were not concluded , when he observed Coningsby , who had risen . "
63676	63687	63669	63670	This gentleman	2676	" he inquired of his clerk , who bowed assent . "
63706	63707	63708	63709	The gentleman	863	" "
63718	63723	63724	63724	He	863	" said the clerk . "
63733	63741	63724	63724	He	863	" said Mr. Millbank , somewhat pettishly ; "
63747	63755	63724	63724	He	863	" and he was about to go . "
63763	63786	63756	63756	I	0	" said Coningsby , coming forward , and with an air of earnestness and grace that arrested the step of the manufacturer . "
63805	63806	63795	63795	I	0	" "
63814	63821	63812	63812	sir	5702	" said Mr. Millbank , moving . "
63842	63849	63825	63825	sir	5702	" Mr. Millbank stopped and said : "
63865	63866	63869	63869	sir	5702	" "
63885	63886	63875	63875	I	0	" "
63899	63904	63893	63893	sir	5702	" said Mr. Millbank ; "
63934	63939	63925	63926	Mr. Benson	578	" and he withdrew . "
63950	64025	63948	63948	sir	5702	" said Mr. Benson , opening a book , and our friend wrote his name and the date of his visit to Millbank . Coningsby beheld in this great factory the last and the most refined inventions of mechanical genius . The building had been fitted up by a capitalist as anxious to raise a monument of the skill and power of his order , as to obtain a return for the great investment . "
64033	64119	63948	63948	sir	5702	" exclaimed the enthusiastic Mr. Benson . The clerk spoke freely of his master , whom he evidently idolized , and his great achievements , and Coningsby encouraged him . He detailed to Coningsby the plans which Mr. Millbank had pursued both for the moral and physical well - being of his people ; how he had built churches , and schools , and institutes ; houses and cottages on a new system of ventilation ; how he had allotted gardens ; established singing classes . "
64125	64165	64122	64123	Mr. Millbank	377	" continued the clerk , as he and Coningsby , quitting the factory , re - entered the court . Mr. Millbank was approaching the factory , and the moment that he observed them , he quickened his pace . "
64169	64206	64166	64167	Mr. Coningsby	329	" he said when he reached them . His countenance was rather disturbed , and his voice a little trembled , and he looked on our friend with a glance scrutinizing and serious . Coningsby bowed . "
64226	64231	64224	64224	sir	5702	" said Mr. Millbank ; "
64247	64359	64360	64360	My	0	" He nodded to the clerk , who disappeared . Coningsby began to talk about the wonders of the factory , but Mr. Millbank recurred to other thoughts that were passing in his mind . He spoke of his son ; he expressed a kind reproach that Coningsby should have thought of visiting this part of the world without giving them some notice of his intention , that he might have been their guest , that Oswald might have made arrangements that he should see everything and in the best manner in short , that they might all have shown however slightly , the deep sense of their obligations to him . "
64373	64377	64360	64360	My	0	" said Coningsby . "
64443	64476	64438	64438	I	0	" A cloud passed over the countenance of Millbank as the name of Lord Monmouth was mentioned , but he said nothing . Turning towards Coningsby , with an air of kindness : "
64480	64484	64438	64438	I	0	" said he , "
64529	64563	64564	64564	Your	329	" The village clock struck five as Mr. Millbank and his guest entered the gardens of his mansion . Coningsby lingered a moment to admire the beauty and gay profusion of the flowers . "
64567	64579	64564	64564	Your	329	" said Coningsby , looking up the green and silent valley , "
64584	64585	64564	64564	Your	329	" "
64592	64603	64652	64652	papa	6785	" said Mr. Millbank , with a rather fierce smile , "
64612	64649	64650	64650	Papa	579	" They entered the house ; a capacious and classic hall , at the end a staircase in the Italian fashion . As they approached it , the sweetest and the clearest voice exclaimed from above : "
64654	64722	64652	64652	papa	6785	" and instantly a young girl came bounding down the stairs , but suddenly seeing a stranger with her father she stopped upon the landing place and was evidently on the point of as rapidly retreating as she had advanced , when Mr. Millbank waved his hand to her and begged her to descend . She came down slowly : as she approached them her father said : "
64737	64775	64734	64735	Mr. Coningsby	329	" She started ; blushed very much ; and then , with a trembling and uncertain gait , advanced , put forth her hand with a wild unstudied grace , and said in a tone of sensibility : "
64789	64846	64847	64849	My only daughter	2709	" This daughter of his host was of tender years ; apparently she could scarcely have counted sixteen summers . She was delicate and fragile , but as she raised her still blushing visage to her father 's guest , Coningsby felt that he had never beheld a countenance of such striking and such peculiar beauty . "
64869	64970	64866	64867	a Saxon	2711	" But the beauty of the countenance was not the beauty of the Saxons . It was a radiant face , one of those that seem as if touched in their cradle by a sunbeam , and to have retained all its brilliancy and suffused and mantling lustre . One marks sometimes such faces , diaphanous with delicate splendour , in the southern regions of France . Her eye too was the rare eye of Acquitaine ; soft and long , with lashes drooping over the cheek , dark as her clustering ringlets . They entered the drawing - room . "
64974	64981	64866	64867	a Saxon	2711	" said Millbank to his daughter , "
65019	65020	65005	65005	He	2714	" "
65029	65255	65022	65023	Miss Millbank	372	" said Coningsby , bowing an apology for his inevitable frock and boots ; the maiden raised her eyes and bent her head . The hour of dinner was at hand . Millbank offered to show Coningsby to his dressing - room . He was absent but a few minutes . When he returned he found Miss Millbank alone . He came somewhat suddenly into the room . She was playing with her dog , but ceased the moment she observed Coningsby . Coningsby , who since his practice with Lady Everingham , flattered himself that he had advanced in small talk , and was not sorry that he had now an opportunity of proving his prowess , made some lively observations about pets and the breeds of lap - dogs , but he was not fortunate in extracting a response or exciting a repartee . He began then on the beauty of Millbank , which he would on no account have avoided seeing , and inquired when she had last heard of her brother . The young lady , apparently much distressed , was murmuring something about Antwerp , when the entrance of her father relieved her from her embarrassment . Dinner being announced , Coningsby offered his arm to his fair companion , who took it with her eyes fixed on the ground . "
65267	65282	65256	65256	You	2717	" said Coningsby , as they moved along ; and the young lady said , "
65285	65363	65256	65256	You	2717	" The dinner was plain , but perfect of its kind . The young hostess seemed to perform her office with a certain degree of desperate determination . She looked at a chicken and then at Coningsby , and murmured something which he understood . Sometimes she informed herself of his tasted or necessities in more detail , by the medium of her father , whom she treated as a sort of dragoman ; in this way : "
65382	65632	65369	65369	papa	6785	" Coningsby always was careful to reply in a direct manner without the agency of the interpreter ; but he did not advance . Even a petition for the great honour of taking a glass of sherry with her only induced the beautiful face to bow . And yet when she had first seen him , she had addressed him even with emotion . What could it be ? He felt less confidence in his increased power of conversation . Why Theresa Sydney was scarcely a year older than Miss Millbank , and though she did not certainly originate like Lady Everingham , he got on with her perfectly well . Mr. Millbank did not seem to be conscious of his daughter 's silence : at any rate , he attempted to compensate for it . He talked fluently and well ; on all subjects his opinions seemed to be decided , and his language was precise . He was really interested in what Coningsby had seen , and what he had felt ; and this sympathy divested his manner of the disagreeable effect that accompanies a tone inclined to be dictatorial . More than once Coningsby observed the silent daughter listening with extreme attention to the conversation of himself and her father . The dessert was remarkable . Millbank was very proud of his fruit . A bland expression of self - complacency spread over his features as he surveyed his grapes , his peaches , his figs . "
65640	65645	65369	65369	papa	6785	" he told Coningsby . "
65677	65678	65369	65369	papa	6785	" "
65694	65726	65369	65369	papa	6785	" said Coningsby to Miss Millbank , wishing to say something , and something too that might interest her . She seemed infinitely distressed , and yet this time would speak : "
65733	65775	65369	65369	papa	6785	" He caught by chance her glance immediately withdrawn ; yet it was a glance not only of beauty , but of feeling and thought . She added , in a hushed and hurried tone , dividing very nervously some grapes : "
65796	65797	65788	65788	he	377	" "
65802	65806	65808	65808	he	377	" said Coningsby . "
65850	65851	65852	65852	I	0	" "
65858	65862	65852	65852	I	0	" said Coningsby , "
65888	65946	65874	65874	I	0	" But there was no reply ; and soon after Mr. Millbank talking of the American market , and Coningsby helping himself to a glass of claret , the daughter of the Saxon , looking at her father , rose and left the room , so suddenly and so quickly that Coningsby could scarcely gain the door . "
65949	65962	66007	66007	you	329	" said Millbank filling his glass , and pursuing some previous observations , "
66002	66003	65996	65996	you	329	" "
66013	66017	66007	66007	you	329	" inquired Coningsby . "

67933	67940	67916	67916	I	0	" he continued with some emotion , "
67956	68336	67954	67954	friend	2844	" The walls of the dining - room were covered with pictures of great merit ; all of the modern English school . Mr. Millbank understood no other , he was wo nt to say , and he found that many of his friends who did , bought a great many pleasing pictures that were copies , and many originals that were very displeasing . He loved a fine free landscape by Lee , that gave him the broad plains , the green lanes , and running streams of his own land ; a group of animals by Landseer as full of speech and sentiment as if they were designed by Æsop ; above all he delighted in the household humour and homely pathos of Wilkie . And if a higher tone of imagination pleased him , he could gratify it without difficulty among his favourite masters . He possessed some specimens of Etty worthy of Venice when it was alive ; he could muse amid the twilight ruins of ancient cities raised by the magic pencil of Danby , or accompany a group of fair Neapolitans to a festival by the genial aid of Uwins . Opposite Coningsby was a portrait , which had greatly attracted his attention during the whole dinner . It represented a woman extremely young and of a rare beauty . The costume was of that classical character prevalent in this country before the general peace ; a blue ribband bound together as a fillet her clustering chestnut curls . The face was looking out of the canvass , and Coningsby never raised his eyes without catching its glance of blended vivacity and tenderness . There are moments when our sensibility is affected by circumstances of a very trivial character . It seems a fantastic emotion , but the gaze of this picture disturbed the serenity of Coningsby . He endeavoured sometimes to avoid looking at it , but it irresistibly attracted him . More than once during the dinner he longed to inquire whom it represented ; but it is a delicate subject to ask questions about portraits , and he refrained . Still when he was rising to leave the room , the impulse was irresistible . He said to Mr. Millbank , "
68345	68379	67954	67954	friend	2844	" The countenance of millbank became disturbed ; it was not an expression of tender reminiscence that fell upon his features . On the contrary , the expression was agitated , almost angry . "
68389	68393	68385	68387	a country artist	2846	" he said , "
68400	68432	68385	68387	a country artist	2846	" and moved away . They found Miss Millbank in the drawing - room . She was sitting at a round table covered with working materials , apparently dressing a doll . "
68435	68439	68385	68387	a country artist	2846	" thought Coningsby , "
68448	68516	68517	68517	My	0	" He addressed her and seated himself by her side . There were several dolls on the table , but he discovered , on examination , that they were pincushions ; and elicited with some difficulty , that they were making for a fancy fair about to be held in aid of that excellent Institution , the Manchester Athenæum . Then the father came up and said : "
68526	68599	68517	68517	My	0	" and she rose , and seated herself at the tea - table . Coningsby also quitted his seat , and surveyed the apartment . There were several musical instruments ; among others he observed a guitar ; not such an instrument as one buys in a music - shop , but such an one as tinkles at Seville ; a genuine Spanish guitar . Coningsby repaired to the tea - table . "
68613	68620	68610	68611	Miss Millbank	372	" A blush and a bow . "
68636	68642	68625	68625	you	2847	" Signals of great distress . "
68649	68650	68644	68644	you	2847	" "
68653	68657	68644	68644	you	2847	" a sigh . "
68671	68672	68673	68673	They	2850	" "
68676	68833	68673	68673	They	2850	" in a whisper . The tea - tray was removed ; Coningsby was conversing with Mr. Millbank , who was asking him questions about his son ; what he thought of Oxford ; what he thought of Oriel ; should himself have preferred Cambridge ; but had consulted a friend , an Oriel man , who had a great opinion of Oriel ; and Oswald 's name had been entered some years back . He rather regretted it now ; but the thing was done . Coningsby , remembering the promise of the guitar , turned round to claim its fulfilment , but the singer had made her escape . Time elapsed , and no Miss Millbank re - appeared . Coningsby looked at his watch ; he had to go three miles to the train , which started , as his friend of the previous night would phrase it , at 9 - 45 . "
68844	68849	68839	68839	you	2851	" said Mr. Millbank ; "
68885	68886	68892	68892	You	2851	" "
68910	68911	68892	68892	You	2851	" "
68917	68958	68914	68915	Mr. Coningsby	329	" said his host , taking his hand , which he retained for a moment as if he would say more . Then leaving it , he repeated with a somewhat wandering air , and in a voice of emotion , "
68966	69037	68963	68964	Mr. Coningsby	329	" Towards the end of the session of 1836 , the hopes of the Conservative party were again in the ascendant . The Tadpoles and the Tapers had infused such enthusiasm into all the country attorneys , who , in their turn , had so bedevilled the registration , that it was whispered in the utmost confidence , but as a flagrant truth , that Re - action was at length "
69042	69530	68963	68964	Mr. Coningsby	329	" All that was required was the opportunity ; but as the existing Parliament was not two years old , and the government had an excellent working majority , it seemed that the occasion could scarcely be furnished . Under these circumstances , the back - stairs politicians , not content with having by their premature movements already seriously damaged the career of their leader , to whom in public they pretended to be devoted , began weaving again their old intrigues about the court , and not without effect . It was said that the royal ear lent itself with no marked repugnance to suggestions , which might rid the Sovereign of ministers , who , after all , were the ministers not of his choice , but of his necessity . But William IV . after two failures in a similar attempt , after his respective embarrassing interviews with Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne , on their return to office in 1832 and 1835 , was resolved never to make another move unless it were a checkmate . The King therefore listened and smiled , and loved to talk to his favourites of his private feelings and secret hopes ; the first outraged , the second cherished ; and a little of these revelations of royalty was distilled to great personages who , in their turn spoke hypothetically to their hangers on of royal dispositions and possible contingencies , while the hangers - on and go - betweens , in their turn , looked more than they expressed ; took county members by the button into a corner , and advised , as friends , the representatives of boroughs to look sharply after the next registration . Lord Monmouth , who was never greater than in adversity , and whose favourite excitement was to aim at the impossible , had never been more resolved on a Dukedom , than when the Reform Act deprived him of the twelve votes , which he had accumulated to attain that object . While all his companions in discomfiture were bewailing their irretrievable overthrow , Lord Monmouth became almost a convert to the measure , which had furnished his devising and daring mind , palled with prosperity , and satiated with a life of success , with an object , and the stimulating enjoyment of a difficulty . He had early resolved to appropriate to himself a division of the county in which his chief seat was situate ; but what most interested him , because it was most difficult , was the acquisition of one of the new boroughs that was in his vicinity , and in which he possessed considerable property . The borough however was a manufacturing town , and returning only one member , it had hitherto sent up to Westminster a radical shopkeeper , one Mr. Jawster Sharp , who had taken what is called "
69534	69540	68914	68915	Mr. Coningsby	329	" in the town on every "
69542	70002	68914	68915	Mr. Coningsby	329	" that had occurred since 1830 ; one of those zealous patriots who had got up penny subscriptions for gold cups to Lord Grey ; cries for the bill , the whole bill , and nothing but the bill ; and public dinners where the victual was devoured before grace was said ; a worthy who makes speeches , passes resolutions , votes addresses , goes up with deputations , has at all times the necessary quantity of confidence in the necessary individual ; confidence in Lord Grey ; confidence in Lord Durham ; confidence in Lord Melbourne ; and can also , if necessary , give three cheers for the King or three groans for the Queen . But the days of the genus Jawster Sharp were over in this borough as well as in many others . He had contrived in his lustre of agitation to feather his nest pretty successfully ; by which he had lost public confidence and gained his private end . Three hungry Jawster Sharps , his hopeful sons , had all become commissioners of one thing or another ; temporary appointments with interminable duties ; a low - church son - in - law found himself comfortably seated in a chancellor 's living ; and several cousins and nephews were busy in the Excise . But Jawster Sharp himself was as pure as Cato . He had always said he would never touch the public money , and he had kept his word . It was an understood thing that Jawster Sharp was never to show his face again on the hustings of Darlford ; the Liberal party was determined to be represented in future by a man of station , substance , character , a true Reformer , but one who wanted nothing for himself , and therefore might if needful get something for them . They were looking out for such a man , but were in no hurry . The seat was looked upon as a good thing ; a contest certainly , every place is contested now , but as certainly a large majority . Notwithstanding all this confidence however , Re - action or Registration , or some other mystification had produced effects even in this creature of the Reform Bill , the good Borough of Darlford . The borough that out of gratitude to Lord Grey returned a jobbing shopkeeper twice to Parliament as its representative without a contest , had now a Conservative Association , with a banker for its chairman , and a brewer for its vice - president , and four sharp lawyers knibbing their pens , noting their memorandum books , and assuring their neighbours with a consoling and complacent air , that "
70011	70204	68914	68915	Mr. Coningsby	329	" Whispers also were about that when the proper time arrived , a Conservative candidate would certainly have the honour of addressing the electors . No name mentioned , but it was not concealed that he was to be of no ordinary calibre ; a tried man , a distinguished individual , who had already fought the battle of the constitution , and served his country in eminent posts ; honoured by the nation , favored by his sovereign . These important and encouraging intimations were ably diffused in the columns of the Conservative journal , and in a style which from its high tone evidently indicated no ordinary source and no common pen . Indeed there appeared occasionally in this paper articles written with such unusual vigour , that the proprietors of the Liberal journal almost felt the necessity of getting some eminent hand down from town to compete with them . It was impossible that they could emanate from the rival Editor . They knew well the length of their brother 's tether . Had they been more versant in the periodical literature of the day , they might in this "
70206	71219	68914	68915	Mr. Coningsby	329	" style have caught perhaps a glimpse of the future candidate for their borough , the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby . Lord Monmouth , though he had been absent from England since 1832 , had obtained from his vigilant correspondent a current knowledge of all that had occurred in the interval . All the hopes , fears , plans , prospects , manoeuvres , and machinations ; their rise and fall ; how some had bloomed , others were blighted ; not a shade of re - action that was not represented to him ; not the possibility of an adhesion that was not duly reported ; he could calculate at Naples at any time within ten , the result of a dissolution . The season of the year had prevented him crossing the Alps in 1834 , and after the general election he was too shrewd a practiser in the political world to be deceived as to the ultimate result . Lord Eskdale , in whose judgment he had more confidence than in that of any individual , had told him from the first that the pear was not ripe ; Rigby , who always hedged against his interest by the fulfilment of his prophecy of irremediable discomfiture , was never very sanguine . Indeed the whole affair was always considered premature by the good judges ; and a long time elapsed before Tadpole and Taper recovered their secret influence , or re - assumed their ostentatious loquacity or their silent insolence . The pear however now was ripe . Even Lord Eskdale wrote that after the forthcoming registration a bet was safe , and Lord Monmouth had the satisfaction of drawing the Whig Mimister at Naples into a cool thousand on the event . Soon after this he returned to England , and determined to pay a visit to Coningsby Castle , feast the county , patronise the borough , diffuse that confidence in the party which his presence never failed to do ; so great and so just was the reliance in his unerring powers of calculation , and his intrepid pluck . Notwithstanding Schedule A , the prestige of his power had not sensibly diminished , for his essential resources were vast , and his intellect always made the most of his influence . True however to his organization Lord Monmouth , even to save his party and gain his dukedom , must not be bored . He therefore filled his castle with the most agreeable people from London , and even secured for their diversion a little troop of French comedians . Thus supported he received his neighbours with all the splendour befitting his immense wealth and great position , and with one charm which even immense wealth and great position can not command , the most perfect manner in the world . Indeed Lord Monmouth was one of the most finished gentlemen that ever lived , and as he was extremely good - natured , and for a selfish man even good - humoured , there was rarely a cloud of caprice or ill - temper to prevent his fine manners having their fair play . The country neighbours were all fascinated ; they were received with so much dignity and dismissed with so much grace . Nobody would believe a word of the stories against him . Had he lived all his life at Coningsby , fulfilled every duty of a great English nobleman , benefited the county , loaded the inhabitants with favours , he would not have been half so popular as he found himself within a fortnight of his arrival with the worst county reputation conceivable , and every little squire vowing that he would not even leave his name at the castle to show his respect . Lord Monmouth whose contempt for mankind was absolute ; not a fluctuating sentiment , not a mournful conviction ebbing and flowing with circumstances , but a fixed , profound , unalterable instinct ; who never loved any one , and never hated any one except his own children ; was diverted by his popularity , but he was also gratified by it . At this moment it was a great element of power ; he was proud that with a vicious character , after having treated these people with unprecedented neglect and contumely , he should have won back their golden opinions in a moment by the magic of manner and the splendour of wealth . His experience proved the soundness of his philosophy . Lord Monmouth worshipped gold , though , if necessary , he could squander it like a caliph . He had even a respect for very rich men ; it was his only weakness , the only exception to his general scorn for his species . Wit , power , particular friendships , general popularity , public opinion , beauty , genius , virtue , all these are to be purchased ; but it does not follow that you can buy a rich man : you may not be able or willing to spare enough . A person or a thing that you perhaps could not buy , became invested in the eyes of Lord Monmonth with a kind of halo amounting almost to sanctity . As the prey rose to the bait , Lord Monmouth resolved they should be gorged . His banquets were doubled ; a ball was announced ; a public day fixed ; not only the county but the principal inhabitants of the neighbouring borough were encouraged to attend ; Lord Monmouth wished it , if possible , to be without distinction of party . He had come to reside among his old friends , to live and die where he was born . The Chairman of the Conservative Association and the Vice - President exchanged glances , which would have become Tadpole and Taper ; the four attorneys knibbed their pens with increased energy , and vowed that nothing could withstand the influence of the aristocracy "
71225	71289	71290	71291	Lord Monmouth	328	" Allwent and dined at the castle ; all returned home overpowered by the condescension of the host , the beauty of the ladies , several real Princesses , the splendour of his liveries , the variety of his viands , and the flavour of his wines . It was agreed that at future meetings of the Conservative Association , they should always give "
71296	71540	71541	71542	Mr. Coningsby	329	Lords!"—superseding the Duke of Wellington , who was to figure in an after toast with the Battle of Waterloo . It was not without emotion that Coningsby beheld for the first the castle that bore his name . It was visible for several miles before he even entered the park , so proud and prominent was its position , on the richly wooded steep of a considerable eminence . It was a castellated building , immense and magnificent , in a very faulty and incongruous style of architecture indeed , but compensating in some degree for these deficiencies of external taste and beauty by the splendour and accommodation of its interior , and which a Gothic castle raised according to the strict rules of art could scarcely have afforded . The declining sun threw over the pile a rich colour as Coningsby approached it , and lit up with fleeting and fanciful tints the delicate foliage , of the rare shrubs and tall thin trees that clothed the acclivity on which it stood . Our young friend felt a little embarrassed when , without a a servant and in a hack chaise , he drew up to the grand portal , and a crowd of retainers came forth to receive him . A superior servant inquired his name with a stately composure , that disdained to be supercilious . It was not without some degree of pride and satisfaction that the guest replied , "
71544	72136	71541	71542	Mr. Coningsby	329	" The instantaneous effect was magical . It seemed to Coningsby that he was borne on the shoulders of the people to his apartment ; each tried to carry some part of his luggage ; and he only hoped his welcome from their superiors might be as hearty . It seemed to Coningsby in his way to his room , that the castle was in a state of great excitement ; everywhere bustle , preparation , moving to and fro , ascending and descending of stairs , servants in every corner ; orders boundlessly given , rapidly obeyed ; many desires , equal gratification . All this made him rather nervous . It was quite unlike Beaumanoir . That also was a place , but it was a home . This , though it should be one to him , seemed to have nothing of that character . Of all mysteries the social mysteries are the most appalling . Going to an assembly for the first time is more alarming than the first battle . Coningsby had never before been in a great house full of company . It seemed an overwhelming affair . The sight of the servants bewildered him ; how then was he to encounter their masters ? That however he must do in a moment . A groom of the chambers indicates the way to him , as he proceeds with a hesitating yet hurried step through several ante - chambers and drawing - rooms ; then doors are suddenly thrown open , and he is ushered into the largest and most sumptuous saloon that he had ever entered . It was full of ladies and gentlemen . Coningsby for the first time in his life was at a great party . His immediate emotion was to sink into the earth , but perceiving that no one even noticed him , and that not an eye had been attracted to his entrance , he regained his breath and in some degree his composure , and standing aside , endeavoured to make himself as well as he could master of the land . Not a human being that he had ever seen before ! The circumstance of not being noticed which a few minutes since he had felt as a relief , became now a cause of annoyance . It seemed that he was the only person standing alone whom no one was addressing . He felt renewed and aggravated embarrassment , and fancied , perhaps was conscious , that he was blushing . At length his ear caught the voice of Mr. Rigby . The speaker was not visible ; he was at a distance surrounded by a wondering group whom he was severally and collectively contradicting , but Coningsby could not mistake the harsh , high tones of that arrogant voice . He was not sorry indeed that Mr. Rigby did not observe him . Coningsby never loved him particularly , which was rather ungrateful , for he was a person who had been kind , and on the whole , serviceable to him , but Coningsby writhed , and especially as he grew older , under Mr. Rigby 's patronising air and paternal tone . Even in old days though attentive , Coningsby had never found him affectionate . Mr. Rigby would tell him what to do and see , but never asked him what he wished to do and see . It seemed to Coningsby that it was always contrived that he should appear the "
72138	72612	72613	72613	grandfather	2857	" or poor relation , of a dependent of his family . These feelings , which the thought of Mr. Rigby had revived , caused our young friend , by an inevitable association of ideas , to remember that , unknown and unnoticed as he might be , he was the only Coningsby in that proud Castle , except the Lord of the castle himself ; and he began to be rather ashamed of permitting a sense of his inexperience in the mere forms and fashions of society so to oppress him , and deprive him as it were of the spirit and carriage which became alike his character and his position . Emboldened and greatly restored to himself , Coningsby advanced into the body of the saloon . On his legs , wearing his blue riband and bending his head frequently to a lady who was seated on a sofa and continually addressed him , Coningsby recognised his grandfather . Lord Monmouth was somewhat balder than four years ago , when he had come down to Montem , and a little more portly perhaps ; but otherwise unchanged . Lord Monmouth never condescended to the artifices of the toilet , and indeed notwithstanding his life of excess had little need of them . Nature had done much for him , and the slow progress of decay was carried off by his consummate bearing . He looked indeed the chieftain of a house of whom a cadet might be proud . For Coningsby , not only the chief of his house , but his host too . In either capacity he ought to address Lord Monmouth . To sit down to dinner without having previously paid his respects to his grandfather , to whom he was so much indebted , and whom he had not seen for so many years , struck him not only as uncourtly , but as unkind and ungrateful , and indeed in the highest degree absurd . But how was he to do it ? Lord Monmouth seemed very deeply engaged , and apparently with some very great lady . And if Coningsby advanced and bowed , in all probability he would only get a bow in return . He remembered the bow of his first interview . It had made a lasting impression on his mind . For it was more than likely Lord Monmouth would not recognise him . Four years had not very sensibly altered Lord Monmouth , but four years had changed Harry Coningsby from a schoolboy into a man . Then how was he to make himself known to his grandfather ? To announce himself as Coningsby , as his Lordship 's grandson , seemed somewhat ridiculous . To address his grandfather as Lord Monmouth would serve no purpose ; to style Lord Monmouth "
72615	72642	72613	72613	grandfather	2857	" would make every one laugh and seemed stiff and unnatural . What was he to do ? To fall into an attitude , and exclaim , "
72647	72649	72613	72613	grandfather	2857	" or "
72656	72921	72927	72927	grandpapa	2862	" Even to catch Lord Monmouth 's glance was not a very easy affair ; he was much engaged on one side by the great lady ; on the other were several gentlemen who occasionally joined in the conversation . But something must be done . There ran through Coningsby 's character , as we have before mentioned , a vein of simplicity which was not its least charm . It resulted no doubt in a great degree from the earnestness of his nature . There never was a boy so totally devoid of affectation , which was remarkable , for he had a brilliant imagination , a quality that from its fantasies and the vague and indefinite desires it engenders , generally makes those whose characters are not formed , very affected . The Duchess who was a fine judge of character , and who greatly regarded Coningsby , often mentioned this trait as one which , combined with his great abilities and acquirements so unusual at his age , rendered him so very interesting . In the present instance it so happened , that while Coningsby was watching his grandfather , he observed a gentleman advance , make his bow , say and receive a few words , and retire . This little incident however made a momentary diversion in the immediate circle of Lord Monmouth , and before they could all resume their former talk and fall into their previous positions , an impulse sent forth Coningsby , who walked up to Lord Monmouth , and standing before him , said : "
72929	73163	72924	72924	you	2861	" Lord Monmouth beheld his grandson . His comprehensive and penetrating glance took in every point with a flash . There stood before him one of the handsomest youths he had ever seen , with a mien as graceful as his countenance was captivating ; and his whole air breathing that freshness and ingenuousness which none so much appreciates as the used man of the world . And this was his child ; the only one of his blood to whom he had been kind . It would be exaggeration to say that Lord Monmouth 's heart was touched ; but his good - nature effervesced , and his fine taste was deeply gratified . He perceived in an instant such a relation might be a valuable adherent ; an irresistible candidate for future elections ; a brilliant tool to work out the Dukedom . All these impressions and ideas , and many more , passed through the quick brain of Lord Monmouth ere the sound of Coningsby 's words had seemed to cease , and long before the surrounding guests had recovered from the surprise which they had occasioned them ; and which did not diminish when Lord Monmouth advancing placed his arms round Coningsby with a dignity of affection that would have become Louis XIV , and then in the high manner of the old Court kissed him on each cheek . "
73169	73174	73175	73175	You	2863	" said Lord Monmouth . "
73182	73779	73175	73175	You	2863	" Then Lord Monmouth led the agitated Coningsby to the great Lady who was a Princess and an Ambassadress , and then placing his arm gracefully in that of his grandson he led him across the room , and presented him in due form to some royal blood that was his guest in the shape of a Russian Archduke . His Imperial Highness received our hero as graciously as the grandson of Lord Monmouth might expect ; but no greeting can be imagined warmer than the one he received from the lady with whom the Archduke was conversing . She was a dame whose beauty was mature , but still radiant . Her figure was superb ; her dark hair crowned with a tiara of curious workmanship . Her rounded arm was covered with costly bracelets , but not a jewel on her finelyformed bust , and the least possible rouge on her still oval cheek . Madame Colonna retained her charms . The party though so considerable principally consisted of the guests at the Castle . The suite of the Archduke included several Counts and Generals ; then there was the Russian Ambassador and his lady ; and a Russian Prince and Princess , their relations . The Prince and Princess Colonna and the Princess Lucretia were also paying a visit to the Marquess ; and the frequency of these visits made some strait - laced magnificoes mysteriously declare it was impossible to go to Coningsby ; but as they were not asked it did not much signify . The Marquess knew a great many very agreeable people of the highest ton , who took a more liberal view of human conduct , and always made it a rule to presume the best motives instead of imputing the worst . There was Lady St. Julians for example , whose position was of the highest ; no one more sought ; she made it a rule to go everywhere and visit everybody , provided they had power , wealth , and fashion . She knew no crime except a woman not living with her husband ; that was past pardon . As long as his presence sanctioned her conduct , however shameless , it did not signify ; but if the husband were a brute , neglected his wife first , and then deserted her ; then , if a breath but sullies her name she must be crushed ; unless indeed her own family were very powerful , which makes a difference , and sometimes softens immorality into indiscretion . Lord and Lady Gaverstock were also there , who never said an unkind thing of anybody ; her ladyship was pure as snow ; but her mother having been divorced , she ever fancied she was paying a kind of homage to her parent by visiting those who might be some day in the same predicament . There were other lords and ladies of high degree ; and some who , though neither lords and ladies , were charming people , which Lord Monmouth chiefly cared about ; troops of fine gentlemen who came and went ; and some who were neither fine , nor gentlemen , but who were very amusing or very obliging as circumstances required , and made life easy and pleasant to others and themselves . A new scene this for Coningsby , who watched with interest all that passed before him . The dinner was announced as served ; an affectionate arm guides him at a moment of some perplexity . "
73797	74441	73794	73795	the Duchess	6414	" inquired Mr. Rigby , who spoke as if he had seen Coningsby for the first time ; but who indeed had , with that eye which nothing could escape , observed his reception by his grandfather , marked it well , and inwardly digested it . There was to be a first appearance on the stage of Lord Monmouth 's theatre to - night , the expectation of which created considerable interest in the party , and was one of the principal subjects of conversation at dinner . Villebecque , the manager of the troop , had married the actress Stella , once celebrated for her genius and her beauty ; a woman who had none of the vices of her craft , for , though she was a fallen angel , there were what her countrymen style extenuating circumstances in her declension . With the whole world at her feet , she had remained unsullied . Wealth and its enjoyments could not tempt her , although she was unable to refuse her heart to one whom she deemed worthy of possessing it . She found her fate in an Englishman , who was the father of her only child , a daughter . She thought she had met in him a hero , a demi - god , a being of deep passion and original and creative mind ; but he was only a voluptuary , full of violence instead of feeling , and eccentric because he had great means with which he could gratify extravagant whims . Stella found she had made the great and irretrievable mistake . She had exchanged devotion for a passionate and evanescent fancy , prompted at first by vanity , and daily dissipating under the influence of custom and new objects . Though not stainless in conduct , Stella was pure in spirit . She required that devotion which she had yielded ; and she separated herself from the being to whom she had made the most precious sacrifice . He offered her the consoling compensation of a settlement which she refused ; and she returned with a broken spirit to that profession of which she was still the ornament and the pride . The animating principle of her career was her daughter , whom she educated with a solicitude which the most virtuous mother could not surpass . To preserve her from the stage , and to secure for her an independence , were the objects of the mother 's life ; but nature whispered to her , that the days of that life were already numbered . The exertions of her profession had alarmingly developed an inherent tendency to pulmonary disease . Anxious that her child should not be left without some protector , Stella yielded to the repeated solicitations of one who from the first had been her silent admirer , and she married Villebecque , a clever actor , and an enterprising man who meant to be something more . Their union was not of long duration , though it was happy on the side of Villebecque , and serene on that of his wife . Stella was recalled from this world , where she had known much triumph and more suffering ; and where she had exercised many virtues , which elsewhere , though not here , may perhaps be accepted as some palliation of one great error . Villebecque acted becomingly to the young charge which Stella had bequeathed to him . He was himself , as we have intimated , a man of enterprise , a restless spirit , not content to move for ever in the sphere in which he was born . Vicissitudes are the lot of such aspirants . Villebecque became manager of a small theatre , and made money . If Villebecque , without a "
74444	74525	73794	73795	the Duchess	6414	" had been a schemer , Villebecque with a small capital was the very Chevalier Law of theatrical managers . He took a larger theatre and even that succeeded . Soon he was recognised as the lessee of more than one , and still he prospered . Villebecque began to dabble in Opera houses . He enthroned himself at Paris ; his envoys were heard of at Milan and Naples , at Berlin and St. Petersburg . His controversies with the "
74527	74669	75499	75500	La Petite	610	" at Paris , ranked among state papers . Villebecque rolled in chariots and drove cabs ; Villebecque gave refined suppers to great nobles , who were honoured by the invitation ; Villebecque wore a red riband in the button - hole of his frock , and more than one cross in his gala dress . All this time the daughter of Stella increased in years and stature , and we must add in goodness : a mild soft - hearted girl , as yet with no decided character , but one who loved calmness and seemed little fitted for the circle in which she found herself . In that circle however she ever experienced kindness and consideration . No enterprise however hazardous , no management however complicated , no schemes however vast , ever for a moment induced Villebecque to forget "
74673	74924	75499	75500	La Petite	610	" If only for one breathless instant , hardly a day elapsed but he saw her ; she was his companion in all his rapid movements , and he studied every comfort and convenience that could relieve her delicate frame in some degree from the inconvenience and exhaustion of travel . He was proud to surround her with luxury and refinement ; to supply her with the most celebrated masters ; to gratify every wish that she could express . But all this time Villebecque was dancing on a volcano . The catastrophe which inevitably occurs in the career of all great speculators , and especially theatrical ones , arrived to him . Flushed with his prosperity , and confident in his constant success , nothing would satisfy him but universal empire . He had established his despotism at Paris , his dynasties at Naples and at Milan ; but the North was not to him , and he was determined to appropriate it . Berlin fell before a successful campaign , though a costly one ; but St. Petersburg and London still remained . Resolute and reckless nothing deterred Villebecque . One season all the Opera houses in Europe obeyed his nod , and at the end of it he was ruined . The crash was utter , universal , overwhelming ; and under ordinary circumstances a French bed and a brasier of charcoal alone remained for Villebecque , who was equal to the occasion . But the thought of "
74927	75035	76048	76049	La Petite	610	" and the remembrance of his promise to Stella deterred him from the deed . He reviewed his position in a spirit becoming a practical philosopher . Was he worse off than before he commenced his career ? Yes , because he was older;—though to be sure he had his compensating reminiscences . But was he too old to do anything ? At forty - five the game was not altogether up ; and in a large theatre , not too much lighted , and with the artifices of a dramatic toilet , he might still be able successfully to re - assume those characters of coxcombs and "
75038	75073	76048	76049	La Petite	610	" in which he was once so celebrated . Luxury had perhaps a little too much enlarged his waist , but diet and rehearsals would set all right . Villebecque in their adversity broke to "
75076	75162	75163	75164	La Petite	610	" that the time had unfortunately arrived when it would be wise for her to consider the most effectual means for turning her talents and accomplishments to account . He himself suggested the stage , to which otherwise there were doubtless objections , because her occupation in any other pursuit would necessarily separate them ; but he impartially placed before her the relative advantages and disadvantages of every course which seemed to lay open to them and left the preferable one to her own decision . "
75166	75400	75163	75164	La Petite	610	" who had wept very much over Villebecque 's misfortunes and often assured him that she cared for them only for his sake , decided for the stage , solely because it would secure their not being parted ; and yet , as she often assured him , she feared she had no predisposition for the career . Villebecque had now not only to fill his own parts at the theatre at which he had obtained an engagement , but he had also to be the instructor of his ward . It was a life of toil ; an addition of labour and effort that need scarcely have been made to the exciting exertion of performance , and the dull exercise of rehearsal ; but he bore it all without a murmur ; with a self - command and a gentle perseverance which the finest temper in the world could hardly account for ; certainly not when we remember its possessor who had to make all these exertions and endure all this wearisome toil , had just experienced the most shattering vicissitudes of fortune , and been hurled from the possession of absolute power and illimitable self - gratification . Lord Eskdale , who was always doing kind things to actors and actresses , had a great regard for Villebecque with whom he had often supped . He had often been kind too to "
75404	75418	75420	75420	his	2868	" Lord Eskdale had a plan for putting Villebecque as he termed it , "
75424	75498	75420	75420	his	2868	" It was to establish him with a French company in London at some pretty theatre ; Lord Eskdale to take a private box and to make all his friends do the same . Villebecque , who was as sanguine as he was good tempered , was ravished by this friendly scheme . He immediately believed that he should recover his great fortunes as rapidly as he had lost them . He foresaw in "
75501	75912	75499	75500	La Petite	610	" a genius as distinguished as that of her mother , although as yet not developed , and he was boundless in his expressions of gratitude to his patron . And indeed of all friends , a friend in need is the most delightful . Lord Eskdale had the talent of bein a friend in need . Perhaps it was because he knew so many worthless persons . But it often happens that worthless persons are merely people who are worth nothing . Lord Monmouth having written to Mr. Rigby of his intention to reside for some months at Coningsby , and having mentioned that he wished a troop of French comedians to be engaged for the summer , Mr. Rigby had immediately consulted Lord Eskdale on the subject , as the best current authority . Thinking this a good opportunity of giving a turn to poor Villebecque , and that it might serve as a capital introduction to their scheme of the London company , Lord Eskdale obtained for him the engagement . Villebecque and his little troop had now been a month at Coningsby , and had hitherto performed three times a week . Lord Monmouth was content ; his guests much gratified ; the company on the whole much approved of . It was indeed considering its limited numbers , a capital company . There was a young lady who played the old woman 's parts — nothing could be more garrulous and venerable ; and a lady of maturer years who performed the heroines , gay and graceful as May. Villebecque himself was a celebrity in characters of airy insolence and careless frolic . Their old man indeed was rather hard , but handy ; could take anything either in the high serious or the low droll . Their sentimental lover was rather too much bewigged , and spoke too much to the audience , a fault rare with the French ; but this hero had a vague idea that he was ultimately destined to run off with a Princess . In this wise , affairs had gone on for a month ; very well , but not too well . The enterprising genius of Villebecque , once more a manager , prompted him to action . He felt an itching desire to announce a novelty . He fancied Lord Monmouth had yawned once or twice when the heroine came on . Villebecque wanted to make a "
75915	75920	75499	75500	La Petite	610	" It was clear that "
75923	76022	75499	75500	La Petite	610	" must sooner or later begin . Could she find a more favourable audience , or a more fitting occasion than were now offered ? True it was she had a great repugnance to come out ; but it certainly seemed more to her advantage that she should make her first appearance at a private theatre than at a public one ; supported by all the encouraging patronage of Coningsby Castle , than subjected to all the cynical criticism of the stalls of St. James 's . These views and various considerations were urged and represented by Villebecque to "
76026	76047	76048	76049	La Petite	610	" with all the practised powers of plausibility of which so much experience as a manager had made him master . "
76050	76270	76048	76049	La Petite	610	" looked infinitely distressed , but yielded as she ever did . And the night of Coningsby 's arrival at the castle was to witness in its private theatre the first appearance of Mademoiselle Flora . The guests re - assembled in the great saloon before they repaired to the theatre . A lady on the arm of the Russian Prince bestowed on Coningsby a haughty , but not ungracious , bow ; which he returned , unconscious of the person to whom he bent . She was however a very striking person : not beautiful ; her face indeed at the first glance was almost repulsive , yet it ever attracted a second gaze . A remarkable pallor distinguished her ; her features had neither regularity nor expression ; neither were her eyes fine ; but her brow impressed you with an idea of power of no ordinary character or capacity . Her figure was as fine and commanding as her face was void of charm . Juno , in the full bloom of her immortality , could have presented nothing more majestic . Coningsby watched her as she swept along like a resistless Fate . Servants now went round and presented to each of the guests a billet of the performance . It announced in striking characters the "
76272	76458	76048	76049	La Petite	610	" of Mademoiselle Flora . A principal servant bearing branch lights , came forward and bowed to the Marquess . Lord Monmouth went immediately to the Archduke , and notified to his Imperial Highness that the comedy was ready . The Archduke offered his arm to the Ambassadress ; the rest were following ; Coningsby was called . Madame Colonna wished him to be her beau . It was a very pretty theatre ; had been rapidly rubbed up , and renovated here and there ; the painting just touched ; a little gilding on a cornice . There were no boxes , but the ground floor which gradually ascended was carpeted , and covered with arm - chairs , and the back of the theatre with a new and rich curtain of green velvet . They are all seated ; a great artist performs on the violin , accompanied by another great artist on the piano . The lights rise ; somebody evidently crosses the stage behind the curtain . They are disposing the scene . In a moment the curtain will rise also . "
76464	76471	76472	76472	She	350	" said the Princess to Coningsby . "
76483	76597	76048	76049	La Petite	610	" But before he could answer the bell rang , and the curtain rose . The old man , who had a droll part to - night , came forward , and maintained a conversation with his housekeeper ; not bad . The young woman who played the grave matron , performed with great finish . She was a favourite and was ever applauded . The second scene came ; a saloon tastefully furnished ; a table with flowers , arranged with grace ; birds in cages , a lap - dog on a cushion ; some books . The audience were pleased ; especially the ladies : they like to recognise signs of "
76601	77133	77134	77134	She	2870	" in the details of the scene . A rather awful pause ; and Mademoiselle Flora enters . She was greeted with even vehement approbation . Her agitation is extreme ; she curtseys , and bows her head , as if to hide her face . The face was pleasing , and pretty enough ; soft and engaging . Her figure slight and graceful . Nothing could be more perfect than her costume ; purely white , but the fashion consummate ; a single rose her only ornament . All admitted that her hair was arranged to admiration . At length she spoke ; her voice trembled , but she had a good elocution though her organ wanted force . The gentlemen looked at each other , and nodded approbation . There was something so unobstrusive in her mien , that she instantly became a favourite with the ladies . The scene was not long , but it was triumphant . Flora did not appear in the next scene . In the fourth and final one of the act , she had to make a grand display . It was a love scene ; and rather of an impassioned character ; Villebecque was her suitor . He entered first on the stage . Never had he looked so well , or performed with more spirit . You would not have given him five - and - twenty years ; he seemed redolent of youth . His dress too was admirable . He had studied the most distinguished of his audience for the occasion , and had outdone them all . The fact is , he had been assisted a little by a great connoisseur , a celebrated French nobleman , Count D — y , who had been one of the guests . The thing was perfect , and Lord Monmouth took a pinch of snuff , and tapped approbation on the top of his box . Flora now re - appeared , received with renewed approbation . It did not seem however that in the interval she had gained courage ; she looked agitated . She spoke , she proceeded with her part ; it became impassioned . She had to speak of her feelings ; to tell the secrets of her heart ; to confess that she loved another : her emotion was exquisitely performed , the mournful tenderness of her tones thrilling . There was throughout the audience a dead silence ; all were absorbed in their admiration of the unrivalled artist ; all felt a new genius had visited the stage;—but while they were fascinated by the actress , the woman was in torture . The emotion was the disturbance of her own soul ; the mournful tenderness of her tones thrilled from the heart : suddenly she clasped her hands with all the exhaustion of woe ; an expression of agony flitted over her countenance ; and she burst into tears . Villebecque rushed forward , and carried rather than led her from the stage ; the audience looking at each other , some of them suspecting that this movement was a part of the scene . "
77138	77147	77134	77134	She	2870	" said Lord Monmouth to the Russian ambassadress , "
77163	77562	77563	77563	I	0	" At length M. Villebecque came forward to express his deep regret that the sudden and severe indisposition of Mlle . Flora rendered it impossible for the company to proceed with the piece ; but that the curtain would descend to rise again for the second and last piece announced . All this accordingly took place . The experienced performer who acted the heroines , now came forward and disported most jocundly . The failure of Flora had given fresh animation to her perpetual liveliness . She seemed the very soul of elegant frolic . In the last scene she figured in male attire ; and in air , fashion , and youth , beat Villebecque out of the field . She looked younger than Coningsby when he went up to his grand - papa . The comedy was over , the curtain fell , the audience much amused chattered brilliant criticism , and quitted the theatre to repair to the saloon where they were to be diverted to - night with Russian dances . Nobody thought of the unhappy Flora ; not a single message to console her in her grief , to compliment her on what she had done , to encourage her future . And yet it was a season for a word of kindness ; so at least thought one of the audience , as he lingered behind the hurrying crowd absorbed in their coming amusements . Coningsby had sat very near the stage ; he had observed with great advantage and attention the countenance and movements of Flora from the beginning . He was fully persuaded that her woe was genuine and profound . He had felt his eyes moist when she had wept . He recoiled from the cruelty and the callousness that , without the slightest symptom of sympathy , could leave a young girl who had been labouring for their amusement and who was suffering for her trial . He got on the stage , ran behind the scenes , and asked for Mlle . Flora . They pointed to a door ; he requested permission to enter . Flora was sitting at a table with her face resting on her hands . Villebecque was there , resting on the edge of the tall fender , and still in the dress in which he had performed in the last piece . "
77568	77572	77563	77563	I	0	" said Coningsby , "
77580	77596	77597	77597	I	0	" and then advancing to her , who had raised her head , he added : "

77635	77647	77633	77633	sir	5702	" said the young lady , looking at him with earnestness . "
77654	77666	77648	77648	Mademoiselle	612	" said Villebecque , making an observation by way of diversion . "
77678	77682	77683	77683	I	0	" said Coningsby ; "

77789	77793	77750	77750	you	5702	" said Villebecque . "

77931	77956	77957	77958	My father	5813	" She rose gently , she approached Villebecque , she laid her head on his breast , and placed her arms round his neck , "
77972	77973	77957	77958	My father	5813	" "
77984	77988	77982	77982	Flora	612	" said Villebecque ; "

78066	78073	78074	78074	He	2676	" said Villebecque returning her embrace . "
78093	78102	78104	78104	Flora	612	" Ah , no , no , no ! "
78110	78168	78107	78107	her	612	" He comes here because he is generous , because he is a gentleman ; and he wished to soothe the soul that he knew was suffering . Thank him , my father , thank him for me and before me , and promise in his presence that the stage and your daughter have parted for ever . "
78169	78174	78176	78176	Coningsby	401	" Nay , Mademoiselle , "
78189	78236	78176	78176	Coningsby	401	" make no such resolutions to - night . M. Villebecque can have no other thought or object but your happiness : and believe me ' tis not I only , but all , who appreciate , and if they were here , must respect you . "
78237	78244	78246	78246	Flora	612	" I prefer respect to admiration , "
78248	78264	78246	78246	Flora	612	" but I fear that respect is not the appanage of such as I am . "
78265	78274	78276	78276	Coningsby	401	" All must respect those who respect themselves , "
78278	78295	78296	78296	He	401	" Adieu , Mademoiselle ; I trust to - morrow to hear that you are yourself . "
78343	78358	78360	78361	Madame Colonna	352	" And you too , do you dance the Russian dances , Mr. Coningsby ? "
78363	78371	78373	78373	Coningsby	329	" I can not dance at all , "
78399	78415	78417	78418	the Princess	1441	" Ah ! you can not dance the Russian dances ! Lucretia shall teach you , "
78420	78428	78417	78418	the Princess	1441	" nothing will please her so much . "

79660	79821	79823	79824	the Marquess	1234	" is the key to this second education . In a couple of years or so you will enter the world ; it 's a different thing to what you read about . It 's a masquerade ; a motley sparkling multitude , in which you may mark all forms and colours , and listen to all sentiments and opinions ; but where all you see and hear has only one object — plunder . When you get into this crowd you will find that Greek and Latin are not so much diffused as you imagine . I was glad to hear you speaking French yesterday . Study your accent . There are a good many foreigners here with whom you may try your wing a little ; do n't talk to any of them too much . Be very careful of intimacies . All the people here are good acquaintance ; at least pretty well . Now , here , "
79839	79917	79823	79824	the Marquess	1234	" now here is a man whom I should like you to know , Sidonia . He will be here in a few days . Lay yourself out for him if you have the opportunity . He is a man of rare capacity , and enormously rich . No one knows the world like Sidonia . I never met his equal ; and ' tis so pleasant to talk with one that can want nothing of you . "

It belongs to an old , a very old man , without a relative in the world . It is known that the estate will be sold at his death , which may be almost daily expected . Then it is mine . No one can offer for it what I can afford . For it gives me this division of the county , Princess . To possess Hellingsley is one of my objects . "

87641	87695	87626	87626	I	0	" said Lord Monmouth . Mr. Rigby shook his head and was going to prophesy , when Lord Eskdale , who liked talk to be short , and was of opinion that Rigby should keep his amplifications for his slashing articles , put in a brief careless observation , which baulked his inspiration .

87827	87927	87755	87755	I	0	" Here several gentlemen began talking at the same time , all agreeing with their host and proving in their different ways , the irresistible influence of property and pluck;—property in Lord Monmouth 's mind meaning vassals ; and pluck , a total disregard for public opinion . Mr. Guy Flouncey , who wanted to get into parliament , but why nobody knew , who had neither political abilities , nor political opinions , but had some floating idea that it would get himself and his wife to some more balls and dinners , and who was duly ticketed for "
87931	87978	87755	87755	I	0	" in the candidate list of the Tadpoles and the Tapers , was of opinion that an immense deal might be done by properly patronising borough races . That was his specific how to prevent revolution . Taking advantage of a pause , Lord Monmouth said , "

88002	88020	87995	87995	I	0	" he said as if wishing to disclaim any interference in the conversation , and then added , "

88152	88157	88141	88141	they	3368	" said Lucian Gay . "
88162	88166	88141	88141	they	3368	" inquired Sidonia . "

88203	88212	88199	88199	You	3364	" said Lord Eskdale cutting in before Rigby , "
88223	88224	88199	88199	You	3364	" "
88250	88254	88141	88141	they	3368	" replied Sidonia . "
88258	88263	88141	88141	they	3368	" said Lord Eskdale . "
88268	88350	88141	88141	they	3368	" said Sidonia . Upon this , Mr. Rigby impatient at any one giving the tone in a political discussion but himself , and chafing under the vigilance of Lord Eskdale which to him ever appeared only fortuitous , violently assaulted the argument , and astonished several country gentlemen present by his volubility . They at length listened to real eloquence . At the end of a long appeal to Sidonia , that gentleman only bowed his head , and said , "
88353	88424	88141	88141	they	3368	" and then turning to his neighbour , inquired whether birds were plentiful in Lancashire this season ; so that Mr. Rigby was reduced to the necessity of forming the political opinions of Mr. Guy Flouncey . As the gentlemen left the dining - room , Coningsby though at some distance was observed by Sidonia , who stopped instantly , then advanced to Coningsby and extending his hand , said , "
88439	88440	88425	88425	I	0	" "
88451	88455	88442	88442	I	0	" said Coningsby ; "

88543	88672	88538	88541	strangers who are unwilling	3375	" The entrance of the gentlemen produced the same effect on the saloon as sunrise on the world ; universal animation , a general though gentle stir . The Archduke bowing to every one , devoted himself to the daughter of Lady St. Julians , who herself pinned Lord Beaumanoir before he could reach Mr. Guy Flouncey . Coningsby instead talked nonsense to that lady . Brilliant cavaliers including Mr. Melton , addressed a band of beautiful damsels grouped on a large ottoman . Everywhere sounded a delicious murmur , broken occasionally by a silver - sounding laugh not too loud . Sidonia and Lord Eskdale did not join the ladies . They stood for a few moments in conversation , and then threw themselves on a sofa . "

89244	89250	89241	89242	Mademoiselle Flora	612	" she inquired . Coningsby found "
89253	89284	89285	89285	I	0	" crouching as it were behind some furniture , and apparently looking over some music . She looked up as he approached , and a smile stole over her countenance . "

89321	89414	89318	89318	you	0	" Coningsby felt the difference between the courtesy of the head and of the heart , as he contrasted the manner of Lucretia and Flora . Nothing could be more exquisitely gracious than the daughter of Colonna was to - night ; Flora , on the contrary , was rather agitated and embarrassed ; and did not express her readiness with half the facility and the grace of Lucretia ; but Flora 's arm trembled as Coningsby led her to the piano . Meantime Lord Eskdale and Sidonia are in deep converse . "
89423	89432	89318	89318	you	0	" said Sidonia , and he looked round . "

90188	90192	90197	90200	the slave of routine	3412	" said Sidonia . "
90224	90259	90197	90200	the slave of routine	3412	" The evening glided on ; the dance succeeded the song ; the ladies were fast vanishing ; Coningsby himself was meditating a movement , when the young Marquess as he passed him said , "
90275	90415	90197	90200	the slave of routine	3412	" This was a favourite haunt towards midnight of several of the younger members of the party at the castle who loved to find relaxation from the decorous gravities of polished life in the fumes of tobacco , the inspiration of whiskey toddy , and the infinite amusement of Lucian Gay 's conversation and company . This was the genial hour when the good story gladdened , the pun flashed , and the song sparkled with jolly mirth or saucy mimicry . To - night , being Coningsby 's initiation , there was a special general meeting of the Grumpy Club , in which everybody was to say the gayest things with the gravest face , and every laugh carried a forfeit . Lucian was the inimitable president . He told a tale for which he was famous , of "
90458	90664	90197	90200	the slave of routine	3412	" The remarkable circumstances under which Lucian Gay had become acquainted with this fact ; the traditionary mysteries by which the family in question had succeeded for generations in keeping it secret ; the decided measures to which the chief of the family had recourse to stop for ever the rumour when it first became prevalent ; and finally the origin and result of the legend ; were details which Lucian Gay with the most rueful countenance loved to expend upon the attentive and expanding intelligence of a new member of the Grumpy Club . Familiar as all present were with the story whose stimulus of agonizing risibility they had all in turn experienced , it was with extreme difficulty that any of them could resist the fatal explosion which was to be attended with the dreaded penalty . The Marquess looked on the table with desperate seriousness , an ominous pucker quivering round his lip ; Mr. Melton crammed his handkerchief into his mouth with one hand , while he lighted the wrong end of a cigar with the other ; one youth hung over the back of his chair pinching himself like a faquir , while another hid his countenance on the table . "
90672	90682	90197	90200	the slave of routine	3412	" continued Lucian Gay in an almost solemn tone , "
90814	90855	90859	90860	Mr. Coningsby	329	" but here Coningsby , who had moved for sometime very restlessly on his chair suddenly started up , and struggling for a moment against the inward convulsion but in vain , stamped against the floor and gave a shout . "
90862	91150	90859	90860	Mr. Coningsby	329	" said the president of the Grumpy Club amid an universal and now permissible roar of laughter . Coningsby could not sing ; so he was to favour them as a substitute with a speech or a sentiment . But Lucian Gay always let one off these penalties easily , and indeed was ever ready to fulfil them for all . Song , speech , or sentiment , he poured them all forth ; nor were pastimes more active wanting . He could dance a Tarantalla like a Lazaroni , and execute a Cracovienne with all the mincing graces of an Opera heroine . His powers of mimicry indeed were great and versatile . But in nothing was he so happy as in a Parliamentary debate . And it was remarkable that , though himself a man who on ordinary occasions was quite incapable without infinite perplexity of publicly expressing his sense of the merest courtesy of society , he was not only a master of the style of every speaker of distinction in either house , but he seemed in his imitative play to appropriate their intellectual as well as their physical peculiarities , and presented you with their mind as well as their manner . There were several attempts to - night to induce Lucian to indulge his guests with a debate , but he seemed to avoid the exertion , which was great . As the night grew old however , and every hour he grew more lively , he suddenly broke without further pressure into the promised diversion ; and Coningsby listened really with admiration to a discussion , of which the only fault was that it was more Parliamentary than the original ; "
91156	93123	90859	90860	Mr. Coningsby	329	" The Duke was never more curt , nor Sir Robert more specious ; he was as fiery as Stanley , and as acrid as Graham . Nor did he do their opponents less justice . Lord Palmerston himself never treated a profound subject with a more pleasant volatility ; and when Lucian rose at an early hour of morn , in a full house alike exhausted and excited , and after having endured for hours in sarcastic silence the menacing finger of Sir Robert shaking over the green table and appealing to his misdeeds in the irrevocable records of Hansard , Lord John himself could not have afforded a more perfect representative of pluck . But loud as was the laughter , and vehement the cheering with which Lucian 's performances were received , all these ebullitions sank into insignificance compared with the reception which greeted what he himself announced was to be the speech of the night . Having quaffed full many a quaigh of toddy , he insisted on delivering it on the table , a proposition with which his auditors immediately closed . The orator appeared , the great man of the night , who was to answer everybody on both sides . Ah ! that harsh voice , that arrogant style , that saucy superficiality which decided on everything , that insolent ignorance that contradicted everybody ; it was impossible to mistake them ! And Coningsby had the pleasure of seeing reproduced before him the guardian of his youth , and the patron of the mimic — the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby ! Madame Colonna with that vivacious energy which characterises the south , had no sooner seen Coningsby , and heard his praises celebrated by his grandfather , than she resolved that an alliance should sooner or later take place between him and her step - daughter . She imparted her projects without delay to Lucretia , who received them in a very different spirit to that in which they were communicated . Lucretia bore as little resemblance to her step - mother in character , as in person . If she did not possess her beauty , she was born with an intellect of far greater capacity and reach . She had a deep judgment . A hasty alliance with a youth , arranged by their mutual relatives , might suit very well the clime and manners of Italy , but Lucretia was well aware that it was altogether opposed to the habits and feelings of this country . She had no conviction that either Coningsby would wish to marry her , or if willing , that his grandfather would sanction such a step in one as yet only on the threshold of the world . Lucretia therefore received the suggestions and proposals of Madame Colonna with great coldness and indifference ; one might even say contempt , for she neither felt respect for this lady , nor was she sedulous to evince it . Although really younger than Coningsby , Lucretia felt that a woman of eighteen is in all worldly considerations , ten years older than a youth of the same age . She anticipated that a considerable time might elapse before Coningsby would feel it necessary to seal his destiny by marriage , while on the other hand , she was not only anxious , but resolved , not to delay on her part her emancipation from the galling position in which she very frequently found herself . Lucretia felt rather than expressed these ideas and impressions . She was not naturally communicative , and conversed with no one with less frankness and facility than with her step - mother . Madame Colonna therefore found no reasons in her conversation with Lucretia to change her determination . As her mind was not very ingenious she did not see questions in those various lights which make us at the same time infirm of purpose and tolerant . What she fancied ought to be done , she fancied must be done ; for she perceived no middle course or alternative . For the rest , Lucretia 's carriage towards her gave her little discomfort . Besides she herself though good - natured , was obstinate . Her feelings were not very acute ; nothing much vexed her . As long as she had fine dresses , good dinners , and opera boxes , she could bear her plans to be crossed like a philosopher ; and her consolation under her unaccomplished devices was her admirable consistency , which always assured her that her projects were wise , though unfulfilled . She broke her purpose to Mr. Rigby that she might gain not only his adhesion to her views , but his assistance in achieving them . As Madame Colonna in Mr. Rigby 's estimation exercised more influence over Lord Monmouth than any other individual , faithful to his policy or practice , he agreed with all Madame Colonna 's plans and wishes , and volunteered instantly to further them . As for the Prince , his wife never consulted him on any subject , nor did he wish to be consulted . On the contrary , he had no opinion about anything . All that he required was that he should be surrounded by what contributed to his personal enjoyment , that he should never be troubled , and that he should have billiards . He was not inexpert in field - sports , rode indeed very well for an Italian , but he never cared to be out of doors ; and there was only one room in the interior which passionately interested him . It was where the echoing balls denoted the sweeping hazard or the effective cannonade . That was the chamber where the Prince Colonna literally existed . Half an hour after breakfast he was in the billiard room ; he never quitted it until he dressed for dinner ; and he generally contrived , while the world were amused or amusing themselves at the comedy or in the dance , to steal down with some congenial sprites to the magical and illumined chamber , and use his cue until bedtime . Faithful to her first impressions , Lucretia had made no difference in her demeanour to Coningsby to that which she offered to the other guests . Polite , but uncommunicative ; ready to answer , but never originating conversation ; she charmed him as little by her manner as by her person ; and after some attempts not very painstaking to interest her , Coningsby had ceased to address her . The day passed by with only a faint recognition between them ; even that sometimes omitted . When however Lucretia observed that Coningsby had become one of the most notable persons in the castle ; when she heard everywhere of his talents and accomplishments , his beauty and grace and great acquirements , and perceived that he was courted by all ; that Lord Monmouth omitted no occasion publicly to evince towards him his regard and consideration ; that he seemed generally looked upon in the light of his grandfather 's heir , and that Lady St. Julians , more learned in that respect than any lady in the kingdom , was heard more than once to regret that she had not brought another daughter with her , Clara Isabella as well as Augustina ; the Princess Lucretia began to imagine that Madame Colonna after all , might not be so extravagant in her purpose , as she had first supposed . She therefore surprised Coningsby with the almost affectionate moroseness with which , while she hated to sing , she yet found pleasure in singing for him alone . And it is impossible to say what might not have been the next move in her tactics in this respect , had not the very night on which she had resolved to commence the enchantment of Coningsby , introduced to her Sidonia . The Princess Lucretia met her fate as she encountered the dark still glance of the friend of Lord Eskdale . He too beheld a woman unlike other women , and with his fine experience both as a man and a physiologist felt that he was in the presence of no ordinary organization . From the evening of his introduction , Sidonia sought the society of the Princess Lucretia . He could not complain of her reserve . She threw out her mind in various and highly cultivated intelligence . He recognised in her a deep and subtile spirit , considerable reading for a woman , habits of thought , and a soul passionate and daring . She resolved to subdued one whose appreciation she had gained , and who had subdued her . The profound meaning and the calm manner of Sidonia combined to quell her spirit . She struggled against the spell . She tried to rival his power ; to cope with him , and with the same weapons . But prompt as was her thought and bright as was its expression , her heart beat in tumult ; and with all her apparent serenity , her agitated soul was the prey of absorbing passion . She could not contend with that intelligent , yet inscrutable , eye ; with that manner so full of interest and respect , and yet so tranquil . Besides they were not on equal terms . Here was a girl contending with a man learned in the world 's way . Between Sidonia and Coningsby there at once occurred companionship . The morning after his arrival they went out shooting together . After a long ramble they would stretch themselves on the turf under a shady tree , often by the side some brook where the cresses grow , that added a luxury to their sporting meal , and then Coningsby would lead their conversation to some subject on which Sidonia would pour out his mind with all that depth of reflection , variety of knowledge , and richness of illustrative memory , which distinguished him ; and which offered so striking a contrast to the sharp talent , the shallow information , and the worldly cunning that make a Rigby . This fellowship between Sidonia and Coningsby elevated the latter still more in the estimation of Lucretia , and rendered her still more desirous of gaining his good will and opinion . A great friendship seemed to have arisen between them , and the world began to believe that there must be some foundations for Madame Colonna 's inuendoes . That lady herself was not in the least alarmed by the attention which Sidonia paid her step - daughter . It was of course well - known that Sidonia was not a marrying man . He was however a great friend of Mr. Coningsby , his presence and society brought Coningsby and Lucretia more together ; and however flattered her daughter might be for the moment by Sidonia 's homage , still as she would ultimately find out , if indeed she ever cared so to do , that Sidonia could only be her admirer , Madame Colonna had no kind of doubt , that ultimately Coningsby would be Lucretia 's husband , as she had arranged from the first . The Princess Lucretia was a fine horsewoman , though she rarely joined the various riding - parties that were daily formed at the Castle . Often indeed , attended only by her groom , she met the equestrians . Now she would ride with Sidonia and Coningsby , and as a female companion was indispensable , she insisted upon "
93126	93206	93207	93207	You	3425	" accompanying her . This was a fearful trial for Flora , but she encountered it , encouraged by the kind solicitude of Coningsby , who always seemed her friend . Very shortly after the arrival of Sidonia , the Archduke and his suite quitted the Castle , which had been His Highness 's head - quarters during his visit to the manufacturing districts ; but no other great change in the assembled company occurred for some little time .

94918	95683	94916	94916	Elizabeth	674	" About this time a steeple - chase in the West of England had attracted considerable attention . This sport was then of recent introduction in England , and is in fact an importation of Irish growth , although it has flourished in our soil . A young guardsman who was then a guest at the Castle , and who had been in garrison in Ireland , had some experience of this pastime in the Kildare country , and he proposed that they should have a steeple chase at Coningsby . This was a suggestion very agreeable to the Marquess of Beaumanoir celebrated for his feats of horsemanship , and indeed to most of the guests . It was agreed that the race should come off at once , before any of the present company , many of whom gave symptoms of being on the wing , had quitted the Castle . The young guardsman and Mr. Guy Flouncey had surveyed the country , and had selected a tract which they esteemed very appropriate for the scene of action . From a hill of common land you looked down upon the valley of Coningsby richly cultivated ; deeply ditched and stiffly fenced ; the valley was bounded by another rising ground , and the scene was admirably calculated to give an extensive view to a multitude . The distance along the valley was to be two miles out , and home again ; the starting post being also the winning post , and the flags which were placed on every fence that the horses were to pass , were to be passed on the left hand of the rider both going and coming ; so that although the horses had to leap the same fences forward and backward , they could not come over the same place twice . In the last field before they turned , was a brook seventeen feet clear from side to side , with good taking off on both banks . This was the critical venture . Lord Monmouth highly approved the scheme , but mentioned that the sweepstakes must be moderate and open to the whole county . The neighbourhood had a week of preparation , and the entries for the Coningsby steeple - chase were numerous . Lord Monmouth after a reserve for his own account placed his stable at the service of his guests . For himself he offered to back his horse , Sir Robert , which was to be ridden by his grandson . Now nothing was spoken or thought of at Coningsby Castle except the coming sport . The ladies shared the general excitement . They embroidered handkerchiefs , and scarfs , and gloves , with the respective colours of the rivals , and tried to make jockey - caps . Lady St. Julians postponed her intended departure in consequence . Madame Colonna wished that some means could be contrived by which they might all win . Sidonia with the other competitors had ridden over the country , and marked well the points ; he glanced rather sharply at the brook , and on his return to the Castle he sent a despatch for some of his stud . Coningsby was all anxiety to win . He was proud of the confidence of his grandfather in backing him . He had a powerful horse and a first - rate fencer , and he was resolved himself not to flinch . On the night before the race retiring somewhat earlier than usual to his chamber , he observed on his dressing - table a small packet addressed to his name , and in an unknown hand - writing . Opening it he found a very pretty jockey whip embroidered with his colours of pink and white . This was a perplexing circumstance , but he fancied it on the whole a happy omen . And who was the donor ? Certainly not the Princess Lucretia , for he had observed her fashioning some maroon ribands which were the colours of Sidonia . It could scarcely be from Mrs. Guy Flouncey . Perhaps Madame Colonna to please — the Marquess ? Thinking over this incident he fell asleep . The morning before the race Sidonia 's horses arrived . All went to examine them at the stables . Among them was an Arab mare . Coningsby recognised the Daughter of the Star . She was greatly admired for her points ; but Guy Flouncey whispered to Mr. Melton that she never could do the work . "
95699	95718	95688	95688	he	374	" said Mr. Melton . Guy Flouncey smiled incredulously . The night before the race it rained heavily . "
95734	95823	95719	95719	I	0	" said Mr. Guy Flouncey with a knowing look to Mr. Melton , who was noting a bet in his memorandum book . The morning was very fine , clear and sunny , with a soft western breeze . The starting post was about three miles from the Castle ; but long before the hour , the surrounding hills were covered with people ; squire and farmer ; with no lack of their wives and daughters ; many a hind in his smock - frock , and many an "
95825	95832	95833	95835	gentlemen riders "	7939	" from the neighbouring factories . The "
95835	95999	95833	95835	gentlemen riders "	7939	" gradually arrived . The entries were very numerous , though it was understood that not more than a dozen would start , and half of these were the guests of Lord Monmouth . At half - past one the cortège from the Castle arrived , and took up the post which had been prepared for them on the summit of the hill . Lord Monmouth was very much cheered on his arrival . In the carriage with him were Madame Colonna and Lady St. Julians . The Princess Lucretia , Lady Gaythorpe , Mrs. Guy Flouncey , accompanied by Lord Eskdale and other cavaliers , formed a brilliant company . There was scarcely a domestic in the Castle who was not there . The comedians indeed did not care to come , but Villebecque prevailed upon Flora to drive with him to the race in a buggy he borrowed of the steward . The start was to be at two o'clock . The "
96002	96084	96085	96085	Gentlemen	5708	" are mustered . Never were riders mounted and appointed in better style . The stewards and the clerk of the course attend them to the starting - post . There they are now assembled . Guy Flouncey adjusts his stirrup - leathers ; Mr. Melton ties a knot in his bridle . In a few moments , the irrevocable monosyllable will be uttered . The bugle sounds for them to face about : the Clerk of the Course sings out : "
96092	96951	96085	96085	Gentlemen	5708	" No objection made , the word given to go , and fifteen riders start in excellent style . Prince Colonna , who rode like Prince Rupert , took the lead , followed close by a stout yeoman on an old white horse of great provincial celebrity , who made steady running , and from his appearance and action , a dangerous customer . The rest , with two exceptions , followed in a cluster at no great distance , and in this order they continued with very slight variation for the two first miles , though the fences were frequent and one or two of them awkward . Indeed they appeared more like horses running over a course than over a country . The two exceptions were Lord Beaumanoir on his horse Sunbeam and Sidonia on the Arab . These kept somewhat slightly in the rear . Almost in this wise they approached the dreaded brook . Indeed with the exception of the last two riders who were about thirty yards behind , it seemed that you might have covered the rest of the field with a cloak . They arrived at the brook at the same moment : seventeen feet of water between strong sound banks is no holiday work ; but they charged with unfaltering intrepidity . But what a revolution in their spirited order did that instant produce ! A masked battery of cannister and grape could not have achieved more terrible execution . Coningsby alone clearly lighted on the opposing bank ; but for the rest of them , it seemed for a moment , that they were all in the middle of the brook , one over another , splashing , kicking , swearing ; every one trying to get out and keep others in . Mr. Melton and the stout yeoman regained their saddles and were soon again in chace . The Prince lost his horse , and was not alone in his misfortune . Mr. Guy Flouncey lay on his back with a horse across his diaphragm ; only his head above the water , and his mouth full of chick - weed and dock leaves . And if help had not been at hand , he and several others might have remained struggling in their watery bed for a considerable period . In the midst of this turmoil , the Marquess and Sidonia at the same moment cleared the brook . Affairs now became very interesting . All heads were now turned to the winning post . Coningsby was in front ; Sidonia and the Marquess following ; Mr. Melton had gone the wrong side of a flag , and the stout yeoman , though close at hand , was already trusting much to his spurs . In the extreme distance might be detected three or four stragglers . Thus they continued until within three fields of the winning post . A ploughed field finished the old white horse ; the yeoman stuck his spurs to the rowels , but the only effect of the experiment was , that the horse stood stock still . Coningsby , Sidonia , and the Marquess were now altogether . The winning post is in sight , and a high and strong gate leads to the last field . Coningsby gallantly dashed forward and sent Sir Robert at the gate , but he had over - estimated his horse 's powers at this point of the game , and a rattling fall was the consequence : however , horse and rider were both on the right side , and Coningsby was in his saddle again , and near at hand . It seemed that the Marquess was winning . There was only one more fence ; and that the foot people had made a breach in by the side of a gate post and wide enough , as was said , for a broad wheel waggon to travel by . Instead of passing straight over this gap , Sunbeam swerved against the gate and threw his rider . This was decisive . The Daughter of the Star , who was still going beautifully , pulling freely , and her jockey sitting still , sprang over the gap and went in first , Coningsby on Sir Robert being placed second . The distance measured was about four miles ; there were thirty - nine leaps and it was done under fifteen minutes . Lord Monmouth was well content with the prowess of his grandson , and his extreme cordiality consoled Coningsby under a defeat , which was very vexatious . It was some alleviation that he was beaten by Sidonia . Madame Colonna even shed tears at her young friend 's disappointment , and mourned it especially for Lucretia , who had said nothing , though a flush might be observed on her usually pale countenance . Villebecque who had betted was so extremely excited by the whole affair , especially during the last three minutes , that he quite forgot his quiet companion , and when he looked round he found Flora fainting . "
96956	96962	96085	96085	Gentlemen	5708	" said Sidonia to Coningsby ; "
96991	97350	97351	97351	Your	3517	" Notwithstanding the fatigues of the morning , the evening was past with great gaiety at the castle . The gentlemen all vowed , that far from being inconvenienced by their mishaps , they felt , on the whole , rather better for them . Mr. Guy Flouncey indeed did not seem quite so limber and flexible as usual ; and the young guardsman , who had previously discoursed in an almost alarming style of the perils and feats of the Kildare country , had subsided into a remarkable reserve . Lord Monmouth beckoned to Coningsby to sit by him on the sofa , and spoke of his approaching University life . He gave his grandson a great deal of good advice : told him to avoid drinking , especially if he ever chanced to play cards , which he hoped he never would ; urged the expediency of never borrowing money , and of confining his loans to small sums and then only to friends of whom he wished to get rid ; most particularly impressed on him never to permit his feelings to be engaged by any woman ; nobody , he assured Coningsby , despised that weakness more than women themselves . Indeed feeling of any kind did not suit the present age — it was not bon ton ; and in some degree always made a man ridiculous . Coningsby was always to have before him the possible catastrophe of becoming ridiculous . It was the test of conduct , Lord Monmouth said ; a fear of becoming ridiculous is the best guide in life , and will save a man from all sorts of scrapes . For the rest , Coningsby was to appear at Cambridge as became Lord Monmouth 's favourite grandson . His grandfather had opened an account for him with Drummonds on whom he was to draw for his very considerable allowance ; and if by any chance he found himself in a scrape , no matter of what kind , he was to be sure to write to his grandfather , who would certainly get him out of it .

The first Jesuits were Jews : that mysterious Russian Diplomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organized and principally carried on by Jews ; that mighty revolution which is at this moment preparing in Germany , and which will be in fact a second and greater Reformation , and of which so little is as yet known in England , is entirely developing under the auspices of Jews , who almost monopolise the professorial chairs of Germany . Neander , the founder of Spiritual Christianity , and who is Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Berlin , is a Jew . Benary , equally famous , and in the same University , is a Jew . Wehl , the Arabic Professor of Heidelberg , is a Jew . Years ago , when I was in Palestine , I met a German student who was accumulating materials for the History of Christianity , and studying the genius of the place ; a modest and learned man . It was Wehl ; then unknown , since become the first Arabic scholar of the day , and the author of the life of Mahomet . But for the German professors of this race , their name is Legion . I think there are more than ten at Berlin alone . "
98896	99133	98889	98889	I	0	" A few years back we were applied to by Russia . Now there has been no friendship between the Court of St. Petersburgh and my family . It has Dutch connexions which have generally supplied it , and our representations in favour of the Polish Hebrews , a numerous race , but the most suffering and degraded of all the tribes , has not been very agreeable to the Czar . However circumstances drew to an approximation between the Romanoffs and the Sidonias . I resolved to go myself to St. Petersburgh . I had on my arrival an interview with the Russian Minister of Finance , Count Cancrin ; I beheld the son of a Lithuanian Jew . The loan was connected with the affairs of Spain ; I resolved on repairing to Spain from Russia . I travelled without intermission . I had an audience immediately on my arrival with the Spanish Minister , Senor Mendizabel ; I beheld one like myself , the son of a Nuovo Christiano , a Jew of Arragon . In consequence of what transpired at Madrid , I went straight to Paris to consult the President of the French Council ; I beheld the son of a French Jew , a hero , an imperial marshal , and very properly so , for who should be military heroes if not those who worship the Lord of Hosts ? "

The consequence of our consultations was that some Northern power should be applied to in a friendly and mediative capacity . We fixed on Prussia , and the President of the Council made an application to the Prussian Minister , who attended a few days after our conference . Count Arnim entered the cabinet , and I beheld a Prussian Jew . So you see , my dear Coningsby , that the world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes . "

You come from the shores of the Northern Sea , land of the blue eye , and the golden hair , and the frank brow ; ' tis a famous breed , with whom we Arabs have contended long ; from whom we have much suffered ; but these Goths , and Saxons , and Normans , were doubtless great men . "
99430	99452	98889	98889	I	0	" But so favoured by Nature , why has not your race produced great poets , great orators , great writers ? "
99453	99711	99346	99346	Coningsby	329	" Favoured by Nature and by Nature 's God we produced the lyre of David ; we gave you Isaiah and Ezekiel ; they are our Olynthians , our Phillippics . Favoured by Nature we still remain : but in exact proportion as we have been favoured by Nature we have been persecuted by Man . After a thousand struggles ; after acts of heroic courage that Rome has never equalled ; deeds of divine patriotism that Athens , and Sparta , and Carthage have never excelled ; we have endured fifteen hundred years of supernatural slavery , during which , every device that can degrade or destroy man has been the destiny that we have sustained and baffled . The Hebrew child has entered adolescence only to learn that he was the Pariah of that ungrateful Europe that owes to him the best part of its laws a fine portion of its literature , all its religion . Great poets require a public ; we have been content with the immortal melodies that we sung more than two thousand years ago by the waters of Babylon and wept . They record our triumphs ; they solace our affliction . Great orators are the creatures of popular assemblies ; we were permitted only by stealth to meet even in our temples . And as for great writers the catalogue is not blank . What are all the school - men , Aquinas himself , to Maimonides ; and as for modern philosophy , all springs from Spinoza . "

The wind was high ; the vast white clouds scudded over the blue heaven ; the leaves yet green , and tender branches snapped like glass , were whirled in eddies from the trees ; the grassy sward undulated like the ocean with a thousand tints and shadows . From the window of the music - room Lucretia Colonna gazed on the turbulent sky . The heaven of her heart too was disturbed . She turned from the agitated external world to ponder over her inward emotion . She uttered a deep sigh . Slowly she moved towards her harp ; wildly , almost unconsciously , she touched with one hand its strings , while her eyes were fixed on the ground . An imperfect melody resounded ; yet plaintive and passionate . It seemed to attract her soul . She raised her head , and then touching the strings with both her hands , she poured forth tones of deep , yet thrilling power . "

103298	103320	103296	103296	Coningsby	329	" the crown has become a cipher ; the church a sect ; the nobility drones ; and the people drudges . "
103321	103329	103331	103332	Lord Vere	371	" It is the great constitutional cause , "
103334	103371	103331	103332	Lord Vere	371	" that refuses everything to opposition ; yields everything to agitation : conservative in Parliament , destructive out of doors ; that has no objection to any change provided only it be effected by unauthorized means . "

103437	103440	103442	103442	Coningsby	329	" Nay , "
103446	103461	103442	103442	Coningsby	329	" it was our last schoolboy weakness . Floreat Etona , under all circumstances . "
103462	103468	103470	103471	Lord Vere	371	" I certainly , Coningsby , "
103473	103499	103470	103471	Lord Vere	371	" shall not assume the Conservative Cause , instead of the Cause for which Hampden died in the field , and Sydney on the scaffold . "
103500	103517	103519	103519	Coningsby	329	" The cause for which Hampden died in the field , and Sydney on the scaffold , "
103521	103530	103519	103519	Coningsby	329	" was the cause of the Venetian Republic . "
103531	103536	103538	103538	Buckhurst	362	" How — how ? "
103540	103545	103547	103547	Coningsby	329	" I repeat it , "
103549	104011	103547	103547	Coningsby	329	" The great object of the Whig leaders in England from the first movement under Hampden to the last more successful one in 1688 , was to establish in England a high aristocratic republic on the model of the Venetian , then the study and admiration of all speculative politicians . Read Harrington ; turn over Algernon Sydney ; and you will see how the minds of the English leaders in the seventeenth century were saturated with the Venetian type . And they at length succeeded . William III . found them out in an instant . He told the Whig leaders ' I will not be a Doge . ' He balanced parties ; he baffled them as the Puritans baffled them fifty years before . The reign of Anne was a struggle between the Venetian and the English systems . Two great Whig nobles , Argyle and Shrewsbury , worthy of seats in the Council of Ten , forced their Sovereign on her death - bed to change the ministry . They accomplished their object . They brought in a new family on their own terms . George I. was a Doge ; George II . was a Doge ; they were what William III . , a great man , would not be . George III . tried not to be a Doge , but it was impossible materially to resist the deeply laid combination . He might get rid of the Whig magnificoes , but he could not rid himself of the Venetian constitution . And a Venetian constitution did govern England from the accession of the House of Hanover until 1832 . Now I do not ask you , Vere , to relinquish the political tenets which in ordinary times would have been your inheritance . All I say is , the constitution introduced by your ancestors having been subverted by their descendants your contemporaries , beware of still holding Venetian principles of government when you have not a Venetian constitution to govern with . Do what I am doing , what Henry Sydney and Buckhurst are doing , what other men that I could mention are doing , hold yourself aloof from political parties which , from the necessity of things , have ceased to have distinctive principles , and are therefore practically only factions ; and wait and see , whether with patience , energy , honour , and Christian faith , and a desire to look to the national welfare and not to sectional and limited interests ; whether , I say , we may not discover some great principles to guide us , to which we may adhere , and which then , if true , will ultimately guide and control others . "
104012	104019	104021	104021	Vere	371	" The Whigs are worn out , "
104023	104034	104021	104021	Vere	371	" Conservativism is a sham , and Radicalism is pollution . "
104035	104039	104041	104041	Buckhurst	362	" I certainly , "
104043	104091	104041	104041	Buckhurst	362	" when I get into the House of Commons , shall speak my mind without reference to any party whatever ; and all I hope is , we may all come in at the same time , and then we may make a party of our own . "
104092	104101	104103	104103	Vere	371	" I have always heard my father say , "
104105	104124	104103	104103	Vere	371	" that there was nothing so difficult as to organize an independent party in the House of Commons . "
104125	104138	104140	104141	Henry Sydney	337	" Ay ! but that was in the Venetian period , Vere , "
104144	104149	104151	104151	Buckhurst	362	" I dare say , "
104153	104240	104151	104151	Buckhurst	362	" the only way to make a party in the House of Commons is just the one that succeeds anywhere else . Men must associate together . When you are living in the same set , dining together every day , and quizzing the Dons , it is astonishing how well men agree . As for me , I never would enter into a conspiracy , unless the conspirators were fellows who had been at Eton with me ; and then there would be no treachery . "
104241	104253	104255	104255	Coningsby	329	" Let us think of principles , and not of parties , "
104257	104262	104264	104264	Buckhurst	362	" For my part , "
104266	104350	104264	104264	Buckhurst	362	" whenever a political system is breaking up , as in this country at present , I think the very best thing is to brush all the old Dons off the stage . They never take to the new road kindly . They are always hampered by their exploded prejudices and obsolete traditions . I do n't think a single man , Vere , that sat in the Venetian Senate ought to be allowed to sit in the present English House of Commons . "
104351	104364	104366	104367	Lord Henry	337	" Well no one does in our family except my uncle Philip , "
104369	104393	104366	104367	Lord Henry	337	" and the moment I want it , he will resign ; for he detests Parliament . It interferes so with his hunting . "
104394	104404	104406	104406	Buckhurst	362	" Well , we have all fair parliamentary prospects , "
104408	104420	104406	104406	Buckhurst	362	" That is something . I wish we were in now . "
104421	104425	104427	104427	Coningsby	329	" Heaven forbid , "
104429	104466	104427	104427	Coningsby	329	" I tremble at the responsibility of a seat at any time . With my present unsettled and perplexed views , there is nothing from which I should recoil so much as the House of Commons . "
104467	104474	104476	104477	Henry Sydney	337	" I quite agree with you , "
104479	104544	104476	104477	Henry Sydney	337	" The best thing we can do is to keep as clear of political party as we possibly can . How many men waste the best part of their lives in painfully apologising for a conscientious deviation from a parliamentary course which they adopted when they were boys , without thought , or prompted by some local connexion or interest to secure a seat . "

104737	104814	104735	104735	Coningsby	329	" Is it indeed extinct ? Is then this civilization , so much vaunted , inseparable from moderate feelings and little thoughts ? If so , give me back barbarism ! But I can not believe it . Man that is made in the image of the Creator , is made for God - like deeds . Come what come may , I will cling to the heroic principle . It can alone satisfy my soul . "

Always happy to see the Princess Colonna under my roof ; but then I like to live quietly , particularly at present ; harassed as I have been by the loss of these elections , by all this bad management , and by all these disappointments on subjects in which I was led to believe success was certain .

116484	117592	116429	116429	he	317	" There was not a peerage compiler in England who had that date save himself . Before we close this slight narrative of the domestic incidents that occurred in the family of his grandfather since Coningsby quitted the castle , we must not forget to mention what happened to Villebecque and Flora . Lord Monmouth took a great liking to the manager . He found him very clever in many things independently of his profession ; he was useful to Lord Monmouth , and did his work in an agreeable manner . And the future Lady Monmouth was accustomed to Flora , and found her useful too , and did not like to lose her . And so the Marquess turning all the circumstances in his mind , and being convinced that Villebecque could never succeed , to any extent in England in his profession , and probably no where else , appointed him , to Villebecque 's infinite satisfaction , Intendant of his household with a considerable salary , while Flora still lived with her kind step - father . Another year elapsed ; not so fruitful in incidents to Coningsby as the preceding ones , and yet not unprofitably passed . It had been spent in the almost unremitting cultivation of his intelligence . He had read deeply and extensively , digested his acquisitions , and had practised himself in surveying them , free from those conventional conclusions and those traditionary inferences that surrounded him . Although he had renounced his once cherished purpose of trying for University honours , an aim which he found discordant with the investigations on which his mind was bent , he had rarely quitted Cambridge . The society of his friends , the great convenience of public libraries , and the general tone of studious life around , rendered an University for him a genial residence . There is a moment in life , when the pride and thirst of knowledge seem to absorb our being , and so it happened now to Coningsby , who felt each day stronger in his intellectual resources , and each day more anxious and avid to increase them . The habits of public discussion fostered by the Debating Society were also for Coningsby no inconsiderable tie to the University . This was the arena in which he felt himself at home . The promise of his Eton days was here fulfilled . And while his friends listened to his sustained argument or his impassioned declamation ; the prompt reply or the apt retort ; they looked forward with pride through the vista of years to the time when the hero of the youthful Club should convince or dazzle in the senate . It is probable then that he would have remained at Cambridge with slight intervals until he had taken his degree , had not circumstances occurred which gave altogether a new turn to his thoughts . When Lord Monmouth had fixed his wedding - day he had written himself to Coningsby to announce his intended marriage , and to request his grandson 's presence at the ceremony . The letter was more than kind ; it was warm and generous . He assured his grandson that this alliance should make no difference in the very ample provision which he had long intended for him ; that he should ever esteem Coningsby his nearest relative ; and that while his death would bring to Coningsby as considerable an independence as an English gentleman need desire , so in his lifetime , Coningsby should ever be supported as became his birth , breeding , and future prospects . Lord Monmouth had mentioned to Lucretia , that he was about to invite his grandson to their wedding , and the lady had received the intimation with satisfaction . It so happened that a few hours after , Lucretia who now entered the private rooms of Lord Monmouth without previously announcing her arrival , met Villebecque with the letter to Coningsby in his hand . Lucretia took it away from him , and said it should be posted with her own letters . It never reached its destination . Our friend learnt the marriage from the newspapers , which somewhat astounded him ; but Coningsby was fond of his grandfather , and he wrote Lord Monmouth a letter of congratulation , full of feeling and ingenuousness , and which , while it much pleased the person to whom it was addressed , unintentionally convinced him that Coningsby had never received his original communication . Lord Monmouth spoke to Villebecque , who could throw sufficient light upon the subject , but it was never mentioned to Lady Monmouth . The Marquess was a man who always found out everything , and enjoyed the secret . Rather more than a year after the marriage , when Coningsby had completed his twenty - first year , the year which he had passed so quietly at Cambridge , he received a letter from his grandfather , informing him that after a variety of movements Lady Monmouth and himself were established in Paris for the season , and desiring that he would not fail to come over as soon as was practicable , and pay them as long a visit as the regulations of the University would permit . So , at the close of the December term , Coningsby quitted Cambridge for Paris . Passing through London , he made his first visit to his banker at Charing Cross , on whom he had periodically drawn since he commenced his college life . He was in the outer counting - house , making some inquiries about a letter of credit , when one of the partners came out from an inner room , and invited him to enter . This firm had been for generations the bankers of the Coningsby family ; and it appeared that there was a sealed box in their possession which had belonged to the father of Coningsby , and they wished to take this opportunity of delivering it to his son . This communication deeply interested him ; and as he was alone in London , at an hotel , and on the wing for a foreign country , he requested permission at once to examine it , in order that he might again deposit it with them : so he was shown into a private room for that purpose . The seal was broken ; the box was full of papers , chiefly correspondence : among them was a packet described as letters from "
117597	118136	117595	117595	Helen	741	" the mother of Coningsby . In the interior of this packet , there was a miniature of that mother . He looked at it ; put it down : looked at it again and again . He could not be mistaken . There was the same blue fillet in the bright hair . It was an exact copy of that portrait which had so greatly excited his attention when at Millbank ! This was a mysterious and singularly perplexing incident . It greatly agitated him . He was alone in the room when he made the discovery . When he had recovered himself , he sealed up the contents of the box , with the exception of his mother 's letters and the miniature , which he took away with him , and then re - delivered it to his banker for custody until his return . Coningsby found Lord and Lady Monmouth in a splendid hotel in the Faubourg St. Honoré , near the English embassy . His grandfather looked at him with marked attention , and received him with evident satisfaction . Indeed Lord Monmouth was greatly pleased that Harry had come to Paris ; it was the University of the World , where everybody should graduate . Paris and London ought to be the great objects of all travellers ; the rest was mere landscape . It can not be denied that between Lucretia and Coningsby there existed from the first a certain antipathy ; and though circumstances for a short time had apparently removed or modified the aversion , the manner of the lady when Coningsby was ushered into her boudoir , resplendent with all that Parisian taste and luxury could devise , was characterized by that frigid politeness which had preceded the days of their more genial acquaintance . If the manner of Lucretia were the same as before her marriage , a considerable change might however be observed in her appearance . Her fine form had become more developed ; while her dress , that she once totally neglected , was elaborate and gorgeous , and of the last mode . Lucretia was the fashion at Paris ; a great lady , greatly admired . A guest under such a roof however , Coningsby was at once launched into the most brilliant circles of Parisian society , which he found fascinating . The art of society is , without doubt , perfectly comprehended and completely practised in the bright metropolis of France . An Englishman can not enter a saloon without instantly feeling he is among a race more social than his compatriots . What , for example , is more consummate than the manner in which a French lady receives her guests ! She unites graceful repose and unaffected dignity , with the most amiable regard for others . She sees every one ; she speaks to every one ; she sees them at the right moment ; she says the right thing . It is utterly impossible to detect any difference in the position of her guests by the spirit in which she welcomes them . There is , indeed , throughout every circle of Parisian society , from the "
118138	118141	118226	118226	he	4201	" to the "
118144	118223	118226	118226	he	4201	" a sincere homage to intellect ; and this without any maudlin sentiment . None sooner than the Parisians can draw the line between factitious notoriety and honest fame ; or sooner distinguish between the counterfeit celebrity and the standard reputation . In England we too often alternate between a supercilious neglect of genius and a rhapsodical pursuit of quacks . In England , when a new character appears in our circles , the first question always is , "
118228	118234	118237	118237	he	4201	" In France it is , "
118239	118243	118237	118237	he	4201	" In England , "
118250	118254	118257	118257	he	4201	" In France , "
118260	118292	118257	118257	he	4201	" About a week after Coningsby 's arrival in Paris , as he was sauntering on the soft and sunny Boulevards , soft and sunny though Christmas , he met Sidonia . "
118298	118302	118257	118257	he	4201	" said Sidonia . "
118346	118392	118336	118336	I	0	" There was much to tell . And when Coningsby had rapidly related all that had passed , they talked of Paris . Sidonia had offered him hospitality , until he learned that Lord Monmouth was at Paris , and that Coningsby was his guest . "
118403	118407	118393	118393	I	0	" he remarked ; "

118802	118806	118799	118800	an individual	6718	" exclaimed Coningsby . "
118810	118815	118799	118800	an individual	6718	" he added eagerly , "
118877	118884	118885	118885	I	0	" Sidonia smiled at his earnestness . "
118893	118897	118885	118885	I	0	" he remarked , "
118954	118955	118952	118952	Ulysses	742	" "
118962	118974	118952	118952	Ulysses	742	" resumed Coningsby , after the pause of a few moments , "
118987	118988	118989	118989	I	0	" "
118994	118998	118989	118989	I	0	" replied Sidonia . "
119215	119253	119254	119254	I	0	" At this moment they reached that part of the Boulevard which leads into the Place of the Madeleine , whither Sidonia was bound ; and Coningsby was about to quit his companion , when Sidonia said : "
119315	119935	119295	119295	he	4250	" So saying they turned down by the Place of the Madeleine , and soon entered the court of the hotel of M. P — s. That gentleman received them in his gallery . After some general conversation , Coningsby turned towards the pictures , and left Sidonia with their host . The collection was rare ; and interested Coningsby , though unacquainted with art . He sauntered on from picture to picture until he reached the end of the gallery , where an open door invited him into a suite of rooms also full of pictures , and objects of curiosity and art . As he was entering a second chamber , he observed a lady leaning back in a cushioned chair , and looking earnestly on a picture . His entrance was unheard and unnoticed , for the lady 's back was to the door ; yet Coningsby advancing in an angular direction , obtained nearly a complete view of her countenance . It was upraised , gazing on the picture with an expression of delight ; the bonnet thrown back , while the large sable cloak of the gazer had fallen partly off . The countenance was more beautiful than the beautiful picture . Those glowing shades of the gallery to which love , and genius , and devotion had lent their inspiration , seemed without life and lustre by the radiant and expressive presence which Coningsby now beheld . The finely arched brow was a little elevated , the soft dark eyes were fully opened , the nostril of the delicate nose slightly dilated , the small , yet rich , full , lips just parted ; and over the clear transparent visage there played a vivid glance of gratified intelligence . The lady rose , advanced towards the picture , looked at it earnestly for a few moments , and then turning in a direction opposite to Coningsby , walked away . She was somewhat above the middle stature , and yet could scarcely be called tall ; a quality so rare , that even skilful dancers do not often possess it , was hers ; that elastic gait that is so winning , and so often denotes the gaiety and quickness of the spirit . The fair object of his observation had advanced into other chambers , and as soon as it was becoming , Coningsby followed her . She had joined a lady and gentleman , who were examining an ancient carving in ivory . The gentleman was middle - aged and portly ; the elder lady tall and elegant , and with traces of interesting beauty . Coningsby heard her speak ; the words were English , but the accent not of a native . In the remotest part of the room , Coningsby apparently engaged in examining some of that famous Limoges ware of which Sidonia had spoken , watched with interest and intentness the beautiful being whom he had followed , and whom he concluded to be the child of her companions . After some little time , they quitted the apartment on their return to the gallery ; Coningsby remained behind , caring for none of the rare and fanciful objects that surrounded him , yet compelled , from the fear of seeming obtrusive , for some minutes to remain . Then he too returned to the gallery , and just as he had gained its end , he saw the portly gentleman in the distance shaking hands with Sidonia , the ladies apparently expressing their thanks and gratification to M. P — s , and then all vanishing by the door through which Coningsby had originally entered . "
119943	119955	119941	119941	yours	4254	" said M. P — s , as Coningsby approached him . "
119974	119978	119968	119968	I	0	" he replied . "
119981	119988	119991	119992	Sir Wallinger	744	" said M. P — s , "
120005	120006	120007	120008	Sir Wallinger	744	" "
120010	120014	120007	120008	Sir Wallinger	744	" said Coningsby , "
120023	120029	120017	120017	I	0	" He looked at Sidonia . "
120034	120038	120017	120017	I	0	" said Sidonia , "
120086	120208	120047	120051	member for—. I know him	4260	" The knowledge that Sidonia was at Paris greatly agitated Lady Monmouth . She received the intimation indeed from Coningsby at dinner with sufficient art to conceal her emotion . Lord Monmouth himself was quite pleased at the announcement . Sidonia was his especial favourite ; he knew so much , had such an excellent judgment , and was so rich . He had always something to tell you , was the best man in the world to bet on , and never wanted anything . A perfect character according to the Monmouth ethics . In the evening of the day that Coningsby met Sidonia , Lady Monmouth made a little visit to the charming Duchess de G — t who was "
120211	120266	120055	120056	a Spaniard	3229	" every other night in her pretty hotel , with its embroidered white satin draperies , its fine old cabinets , and ancestral portraits of famous name , brave marshals and bright princesses of the olden time , on its walls . These receptions without form , yet full of elegance , are what English "
120269	120313	120047	120051	member for—. I know him	4260	" were before the continental war , though now , by a curious perversion of terms , the easy domestic title distinguishes in England a formally prepared and elaborately collected assembly , in which everything and every person are careful to be as little "
120315	120462	120055	120056	a Spaniard	3229	" as possible . In France , on the contrary , ' tis on these occasions , and in this manner , that society carries on that degree and kind of intercourse which in England we attempt awkwardly to maintain by the medium of that unpopular species of visitation styled a morning call ; which all complain that they have either to make or to endure . Nowhere was this species of reception more happily conducted than at the Duchess de G — t. The rooms though small , decorated with taste , brightly illumined ; a handsome and gracious hostess , the Duke the very pearl of gentlemen , and sons and daughters worthy of such parents . Every moment some one came in , and some one went away . In your way from a dinner to a ball , you stopped to exchange agreeable "
120466	120998	120055	120056	a Spaniard	3229	" It seemed that every woman was pretty , every man a wit . Sure you were to find yourself surrounded by celebrities , and men were welcomed there if they were clever before they were famous , which showed it was a house that regarded intellect , and did not seek merely to gratify its vanity by being surrounded by the distinguished . Enveloped in a rich Indian shawl and leaning back on a sofa , Lady Monmouth was engaged in conversation with the courtly and classic Count M — é , when on casually turning her head , she observed entering the saloon , Sidonia . She just caught his form bowing to the Duchess , and instantly turned her head and replunged into her conversation with increased interest . Lady Monmouth was a person who had the power of seeing all about her , everything and everybody , without appearing to look . She was conscious that Sidonia was approaching her neighbourhood . Her heart beat in tumult ; she dreaded to catch the eye of that very individual whom she was so anxious to meet . He was advancing towards the sofa . Instinctively Lady Monmouth turned from the Count , and began speaking earnestly to her other neighbour , a young daughter of the house , innocent and beautiful , not yet quite fledged , trying her wings in society under the maternal eye . She was surprised by the extreme interest which her grand neighbour suddenly took in all her pursuits , her studies , her daily walks in the Bois de Boulogne . Sidonia as the Marchioness had anticipated , had now reached the sofa . But no , it was to the Count and not to Lady Monmouth that he was advancing ; and they were immediately engaged in conversation . After some little time when she had become accustomed to his voice , and found her own heart throbbing with less violence , Lucretia turned again , as if by accident to the Count , and met the glance of Sidonia . She meant to have received him with haughtiness , but her self - command deserted her ; and slightly rising from the sofa , she welcomed him with a countenance of extreme pallor and with some awkwardness . His manner was such as might have assisted her , even had she been more troubled . It was marked by a degree of respectful friendliness . He expressed without reserve his pleasure at meeting her again ; inquired much how she had passed her time since they last parted ; asked more than once after the Marquess . The Count moved away ; Sidonia took his seat . His ease and homage combined very greatly relieved her . She expressed to him how kind her Lord would consider his society , for the Marquess had suffered in health since Sidonia last saw him . His periodical gout had left him , which made him ill and nervous . The Marquess received his friends at dinner every day . Sidonia particularly amiable , offered himself as a guest for the following one . "
121011	121022	121001	121001	you	4268	" inquired Lucretia , delighted with all that had occurred . "
121030	121034	121035	121035	I	0	" said Sidonia , "
121039	121172	121173	121174	La Petite	610	" There was a momentary pause ; Lucretia , happier than she had been for a long time , her face a little flushed , and truly in a secret tumult of sweet thoughts , remembered she had been long there , and offering her hand to Sidonia , bade him adieu until to - morrow . While he , as was his custom , soon repaired to the refined circle of the Countess de C — s — I — ne a lady , whose manners he always mentioned as his fair ideal , and whose house was his favourite haunt . Before to - morrow comes , a word or two respecting two other characters of this history connected with the family of Lord Monmouth . And first of Flora . "
121175	122394	121173	121174	La Petite	610	" was neither very well nor very happy . Her hereditary disease developed itself ; gradually , but in a manner alarming to those who loved her . She was very delicate , and suffered so much from the weakness of her chest , that she was obliged to relinquish singing . This was really the only tie between her and the Marchioness , who without being a petty tyrant , treated her often with unfeeling haughtiness . She was therefore now rarely seen in the chambers of the great . In her own apartments she found indeed some distraction in music , for which she had a natural predisposition , but this was a pursuit that only fed the morbid passion of her tender soul . Alone , listening only to sweet sounds , or indulging in soft dreams that never could be realized , her existence glided away like a vision , and she seemed to become every day more fair and fragile . Alas ! hers was the sad and mystic destiny to love one whom she never met , and by whom if she met him , she would scarcely perhaps be recognised . Yet in that passion , fanciful , almost ideal , her life was absorbed , nor for her did the world contain an existence , a thought , a sensation , beyond those that sprang from the image of the noble youth who had sympathized with her in her sorrows , and had softened the hard fortunes of dependence by his generous sensibility . Happy that with many mortifications , it was still her lot to live under the roof of one who bore his name , and in whose veins flowed the same blood ! She felt indeed for the Marquess , whom she so rarely saw , and from whom she had never received much notice , prompted it would seem by her fantastic passion , a degree of reverence , almost of affection , which seemed occasionally even to herself as something inexplicable and without reason . As for her fond stepfather , M. Villebecque , the world fared very differently with him . His lively and enterprising genius , his ready and multiform talents , and his temper which defied disturbance , had made their way . He had become the very right hand of Lord Monmouth ; his only counsellor , his only confidant ; his secret agent ; the minister of his will . And well did Villebecque deserve this trust , and ably did he maintain himself in the difficult position which he achieved . There was nothing which Villebecque did not know , nothing which he could not do , especially at Paris . He was master of his subject ; in all things the secret of success , and without which however they may from accident dazzle the world , the statesman , the orator , the author , all alike feel the damning consciousness of being charlatans . Coningsby had made a visit to M. Villebecque and Flora the day after his arrival . It was a recollection and a courtesy that evidently greatly gratified them . Villebecque talked very much and amusingly ; and Flora , whom Coningsby frequently addressed , very little , though she listened with great earnestness . Coningsby told her that he thought from all he heard she was too much alone , and counselled her to gaiety . But nature that had made her mild , had denied her that constitutional liveliness of being which is the graceful property of French women . She was a lilly of the valley , that loved seclusion , and the tranquillity of virgin glades . Almost every day as he passed their entresol , Coningsby would look into Villebecque 's apartments for a moment to ask after Flora . Sidonia was to dine at Lord Monmouth 's the day after he met Lucretia , and afterwards they were all to meet at a ball much talked of , and to which invitations were much sought ; and which was to be given that evening by the Baroness S. de R — d. Lord Monmouth 's dinners at Paris were celebrated . It was generally agreed that they had no rivals ; yet there were others who had as skilful cooks , others who for such a purpose were equally profuse in their expenditure . What then was the secret spell of his success ? The simplest in the world , though no one seemed aware of it . His Lordship 's plates were always hot : whereas at Paris , in the best appointed houses , and at dinners , which for costly materials and admirable art in their preparation , can not be surpassed , the effect is always considerably lessened , and by a mode the most mortifying — by the mere circumstance that every one at a French dinner is served on a cold plate . The reason of a custom , or rather a necessity , which one would think a nation so celebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from , is really , it is believed , that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior , that it can not endure the preparatory heat for dinner . The common white pottery , for example , which is in general use , and always found at the cafés , will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half an hour . Now if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been so often on the point of completion , the fabrics of our unrivalled potteries , in exchange for their capital wines , would be found throughout France . The dinners of both nations would be improved : the English would gain a delightful beverage , and the French for the first time in their lives would dine off hot plates . An unanswerable instance of the advantages of commercial reciprocity ! The guests at Lord Monmouth 's to - day were chiefly Carlists , individuals bearing illustrious names , that animate the page of history , and are indissolubly bound up with the glorious annals of their great country . They are the phantoms of a past , but real aristocracy ; an aristocracy that was founded on an intelligible principle ; which claimed great privileges for great purposes ; whose hereditary duties were such , that their possessors were perpetually in the eye of the nation , and who maintained and , in a certain point of view , justified their pre - eminence by constant illustration . It pleased Lord Monmouth to show great courtesies to a fallen race with whom he sympathized ; whose fathers had been his friends in the days of his hot youth ; whose mothers he had made love to ; whose palaces had been his home ; whose brilliant fêtes he remembered ; whose fanciful splendour excited his early imagination ; and whose magnificent and wanton luxury had developed his own predisposition for boundless enjoyment . Soubise and his suppers ; his cutlets and his mistresses ; the profuse and embarrassed De Laraguais , who sighed for "
122398	122878	121173	121174	La Petite	610	" as for a strange luxury , which perpetually eluded his grasp ; these were the heroes of the olden time that Lord Monmouth worshipped ; the wisdom of our ancestors which he appreciated ; and he turned to their recollection for relief from the vulgar prudence of the degenerate days on which he had fallen : days when nobles must be richer than other men , or they cease to have any distinction . It was impossible not to be struck by the effective appearance of Lady Monmouth as she received her guests in grand toilet preparatory to the ball ; white satin and minever , a brilliant tiara . Her fine form , her costume of a fashion as perfect as its materials were sumptuous , and her presence always commanding and distinguished , produced a general effect to which few could be insensible . It was the triumph of mien over mere beauty of countenance . The hotel of Madame S. de R — d is not more distinguished by its profuse decoration , than by the fine taste which has guided the vast expenditure . Its halls of arabesque are almost without a rival ; there is not the slightest embellishment in which the hand and feeling of art are not recognized . The rooms were very crowded ; everybody distinguished in Paris was there : the lady of the Court , the duchess of the Faubourg , the wife of the rich financier , the constitutional Throne , the old Monarchy , the modern Bourse were alike represented . Marshals of the Empire , Ministers of the Crown , Dukes and Marquises , whose ancestors lounged in the Oeil de Boeuf ; diplomatists of all countries , eminent foreigners of all nations , deputies who led sections , members of learned and scientific academies , occasionally a stray poet ; a sea of sparkling tiaras , brilliant bouquets , glittering stars , and glowing ribbands , many beautiful faces , many famous ones : unquestionably the general air of a first - rate Parisian saloon , on a great occasion , is not easily equalled . In London there is not the variety of guests ; nor the same size and splendour of saloons . Our houses are too small for reception . Coningsby , who had stolen away from his grandfather 's before the rest of the guests , was delighted with the novelty of the splendid scene . He had been in Paris long enough to make some acquaintances , and mostly with celebrated personages . In his long - fruitless endeavour to enter the saloon in which they danced , he found himself hustled against the illustrious Baron von H — t , whom he had sat next to at dinner a few days before at Count M — é 's . "
122893	122903	122891	122891	Baron	4271	" said Coningsby , alluding to a past conversation . "
122906	122914	122891	122891	Baron	4271	" replied M. de H. , smiling ; "
122939	123225	122931	122931	I	0	" Time however brought Coningsby into that brilliant chamber . What a blaze of light and loveliness ! How coquettish are the costumes ! How vivid the flowers ! To sounds of stirring melody , beautiful beings move with grace . Grace indeed is beauty in action . Here where all are fair and everything is attractive , his eye is suddenly arrested by one object — a form of surpassing grace among the graceful , among the beauteous , a countenance of unrivalled beauty . She was young among the youthful ; a face of sunshine amid all that artificial light ; her head placed upon her finely moulded shoulders with a queen - like grace ; a coronet of white roses on her dark brown hair ; her only ornament . It was the beauty of the picture gallery . The eye of Coningsby never quitted her . When the dance ceased , he had an opportunity of seeing her nearer . He met her walking with her cavalier , and he was conscious that she observed him . Finally , he remarked that she resumed a seat next to the lady , whom he had mistaken for her mother , but had afterwards understood to be Lady Wallinger . Coningsby returned to the other saloons ; he witnessed the entrance and reception of Lady Monmouth , who moved on towards the ballroom . Soon after this , Sidonia arrived ; he came in with the still handsome and ever courteous Duke D — s. Observing Coningsby , he stopped to present him to the Duke . While thus conversing , the Duke , who is very fond of the English , observed : "
123265	123376	123247	123247	He	4276	" And Sir Joseph and his lovely niece veritably approached . The Duke addressed them : asked them in the name of his Duchess to a concert on the next Thursday ; and after a thousand compliments moved on . Sidonia stopped ; Coningsby could not refrain from lingering , but stood a little apart , and was about to move away , when there was a whisper , of which , without hearing a word , he could not resist the impression that he was the subject . He felt a little embarrassed , and was retiring , when he heard Sidonia reply to an inquiry of the lady , "
123380	123390	123247	123247	He	4276	" and then turning to Coningsby , said aloud : "
123402	123504	123393	123394	Miss Millbank	372	" Coningsby started , advanced , coloured a little , could not conceal his surprise . The lady too though more prepared , was not without confusion , and for an instant looked down . Coningsby recalled at that moment the long dark eye - lashes and the beautiful , bashful , countenance that had so charmed him at Millbank ; but two years had otherwise effected a wonderful change in the sister of his school - day friend , and transformed the silent , embarrassed girl into a woman of surpassing beauty and of the most graceful and impressive mien . "
123518	123533	123510	123511	Mr. Coningsby	329	" said Sir Joseph addressing Sidonia , and wishing to cover their mutual embarrassment ; "
123568	123651	123559	123559	our	4281	" Coningsby and Miss Millbank were now in full routine conversation , consisting of questions ; how long she had been at Paris ; when she had heard last from Millbank ; how her father was ; also , how was her brother . Sidonia made an observation to Sir Joseph on a passer - by , and then himself moved on ; Coningsby accompanying his new friends in a contrary direction , to the refreshment room to which they were proceeding . "
123661	123665	123653	123653	you	4282	" said Coningsby . "
123682	123683	123671	123671	I	0	" "

123745	123752	123772	123772	yours	4282	" said Coningsby with a smile . "

123774	123775	123754	123754	you	4282	" "

123880	123885	123886	123886	I	0	" said Miss Millbank . "
123893	123897	123886	123886	I	0	" said Coningsby . "
123933	123959	124098	124098	Coningsby	329	" Mr. Millbank has lately purchased a very beautiful place in the county . I became acquainted with Hellingsley when staying at my grandfather 's . "
123960	124013	124098	124098	Coningsby	329	" Ah ! I have never seen it ; indeed , I was very much surprised that papa became its purchaser , because he never will live there ; and Oswald I am sure could never be tempted to quit Millbank . You know what enthusiastic ideas he has of his order ? "
124014	124096	124098	124098	Coningsby	329	" Like all his ideas ; sound , and high , and pure . I always duly appreciated your brother 's great abilities , and what is far more important , his lofty mind . When I recollect our Eton days , I can not understand how more than two years have passed away without our being together . I am sure the fault is mine . I might now have been at Oxford instead of Paris . And , yet , "
124100	124121	124098	124098	Coningsby	329	" that would have been a sad mistake , since I should not have had the happiness of being here . "
124122	124135	124137	124138	Miss Millbank	372	" Oh , yes , that would have been a sad mistake , "
124140	124143	124145	124146	Sir Joseph	744	" Edith , "
124160	124168	124149	124150	his niece	4263	" Edith , that is Monsieur Thiers . "
124700	124715	124694	124695	Dr. Johnson	749	" Sir , in the case of a Countess the imagination is more excited . "
125951	125965	125967	125969	the witty statesman	4383	" I want men who will support the government on all unpopular questions , "
126039	126041	126031	126031	his	759	" practical "

126887	126896	126885	126885	he	744	" the real feelings of the Tory party ; "
127319	127331	127316	127316	he	744	" Ah ! I see ; you are a regular Orangeman . "
127332	127339	127341	127341	Coningsby	329	" I look upon an Orangeman , "
127343	127358	127341	127341	Coningsby	329	" as a pure Whig ; the only professor and practiser of unadulterated Whiggism . "
128187	128200	128202	128206	an attaché of an Embassy	4472	" But Monsieur Sidonia 's cook is a gem , they say , "
128208	128287	128205	128206	an Embassy	4473	" I have no doubt of it : Sidonia is a man of sense , almost the only man of sense I know . I never caught him tripping . He never makes a false move . Sidonia is exactly the sort of man I like ; you know you can not deceive him , and that he does not want to deceive you . I wish he liked a rubber more . Then he would be perfect . "
128288	128298	128300	128301	the Attaché	763	" They say he is going to be married , "
128303	128306	128308	128309	Lord Monmouth	328	" Poh ! "
128311	128314	128316	128317	Lady Monmouth	740	" Married ? "
128319	128323	128316	128317	Lady Monmouth	740	" To whom ? "
128324	128343	128345	128346	the Attaché	763	" To your beautiful country woman ; ' la belle Anglaise ' that all the world talks of , "
128348	128357	128359	128360	the Marquess	1234	" And who may she be , pray ? "
128362	128371	128359	128360	the Marquess	1234	" I have so many beautiful country women . "
128372	128376	128378	128379	the Attaché	763	" Mademoiselle Millbank , "
128381	128384	128386	128387	the Marquess	1234	" Millbank , "
128393	128410	128411	128411	he	1234	" There are so many Millbanks . Do you know what Millbank this is , Harry ? "
128433	128442	128444	128444	Coningsby	329	" What , sir — yes — Millbank ? "
128446	128458	128444	128444	Coningsby	329	" I say , do you know who this Millbank is ? "
128459	128488	128411	128411	he	1234	" Oh ! Miss Millbank : yes , I believe , that is I know a daughter of the — the gentleman who purchased some property near you . "
128489	128502	128444	128444	Coningsby	329	" Oh ! that fellow ! Has he got a daughter here ! "
128503	128511	128513	128514	the Attaché	763	" The most beautiful girl in Paris , "
128516	128531	128532	128532	he	4477	" Lady Monmouth , have you seen this beauty?—That Sidonia is going to marry , "
128539	128547	128549	128550	Lady Monmouth	740	" I have seen the young lady , "
128552	128567	128549	128550	Lady Monmouth	740	" but I had not heard that Monsieur Sidonia was about to marry her . "
128568	128575	128577	128578	another gentleman	4478	" Is she so very beautiful ? "
128580	128583	128585	128586	Lady Monmouth	740	" Yes , "
128593	128596	128598	128599	the Marquess	1234	" Poh ! "
128602	128612	128614	128615	the Attaché	4480	" I assure you that it is a fact , "
128617	128639	128614	128615	the Attaché	4480	" not at least an on - dit . I have it from a quarter that could not be well mistaken . "
129491	129501	129503	129504	Lord Monmouth	328	" Get surgeons ; and send for her maid , "
129595	129605	129607	129607	Sidonia	625	" Let us carry her in , Lord Monmouth , "
129653	129662	129664	129664	Sidonia	625	" I would hope there is no fracture , "
129672	129715	129664	129664	Sidonia	625	" nor does it appear to me that the percussion of the head , though considerable , could have been fatally violent . I have caught her pulse . Keep her in a horizontal position and she will soon come to herself . "
129774	129785	129787	129788	the surgeon	4532	" The brain can not be affected with that pulse , "
129790	129796	129787	129788	the surgeon	4532	" there is no fracture . "
129797	129803	129805	129806	Lord Monmouth	328	" How pale she is ! "
129815	129824	129826	129826	Sidonia	625	" The colour seems to me to return , "
129852	129856	129858	129859	the surgeon	4532	" She revives , "
129882	129894	129896	129897	the surgeon	4532	" If I could but get her to take this draught ! "
129899	129907	129909	129909	Sidonia	625	" Stop — moisten her lips first , "
129943	129948	129950	129951	the surgeon	4532	" She is herself , "
129953	129956	129958	129959	the Marquess	1234	" Lucretia , "
129961	129964	129966	129967	the Marchioness	8437	" Sidonia , "
129981	129985	129987	129987	Sidonia	625	" Lady Monmouth ! "
130007	130012	130013	130013	she	764	" Where am I ? "
130016	130020	130022	130023	the Marquess	1234	" With me , "
130037	130040	130041	130041	she	764	" Sidonia ! "
130050	130054	130056	130057	Lord Monmouth	328	" Is here , "
130059	130068	130056	130057	Lord Monmouth	328	" He carried you in after our accident . "
130069	130079	130080	130081	The Marquess	1234	" Accident ! Why is he going to marry ? "
130097	130102	130104	130104	Sidonia	625	" I think now , "
130109	130118	130104	130104	Sidonia	625	" that Lady Monmouth would take the draught . "
130123	130129	130131	130132	the Marquess	1234	" Try you , Sidonia , "
130136	130142	130144	130144	Sidonia	625	" You feel yourself again ? "
130148	130154	130156	130157	the Marchioness	8437	" Would I did not ! "
130165	130179	130156	130157	the Marchioness	8437	" What has happened ? Why am I here ? Are you married ? "
130180	130186	130188	130188	Sidonia	625	" She wanders a little , "
130198	130206	130208	130209	Lady Monmouth	740	" I could have born even repulsion , "
130216	130222	130208	130209	Lady Monmouth	740	" but not for another ! "
130223	130227	130229	130230	the Marquess	1234	" M. Villebecque , "
130232	130236	130229	130230	the Marquess	1234	" My Lord ? "
130263	130278	130237	130238	Lord Monmouth	328	" The carriage should have arrived by this time . Let us get home . "

130840	130847	130849	130850	the Marquess	1234	" All is right , Harry , "
130870	130876	130877	130877	she	612	" I am quite well , "
130880	130883	130877	130877	she	612	" now . "
130884	130896	130897	130897	Coningsby	329	" But you must lean on me , dearest Lady Monmouth , "
131001	131017	130998	130998	he	4580	" Ma Petite , you look more frightened than any of us . Poor child ! "
131044	131053	131054	131054	she	612	" You are not hurt then , sir ? "
131076	131086	131088	131088	he	4580	" By no means , my good little girl ; "
131415	131433	131435	131435	Edith	580	" And miss Monsieur de Sidonia 's fête , of which we have all talked so much ! "
131453	131465	131467	131467	Coningsby	329	" The festival will be not less gay for my absence , "
131478	131493	131495	131495	Edith	580	" If we were all to argue from the same premises and act accordingly , "
131497	131537	131495	131495	Edith	580	" the saloons would be empty . But if any person 's absence would be remarked , I should really have thought it would be yours . I thought you were one of Monsieur de Sidonia 's great friends ! "
131538	131544	131546	131546	Coningsby	329	" He has no friend , "
131548	131560	131546	131546	Coningsby	329	" No wise man has . What are friends ? Traitors . "
131572	131593	131569	131569	she	580	" I am sure you have not quarrelled with Monsieur de Sidonia , for we have just parted with him . "
131594	131602	131604	131604	Coningsby	329	" I have no doubt you have , "
131606	131641	131569	131569	she	580	" And it is impossible to speak of another in higher terms than he spoke of you . Sir Joseph observed how unusual it was for Monsieur de Sidonia to express himself so warmly . "
131642	131656	131658	131658	Coningsby	329	" Sidonia is a great man , and carries every thing before him , "
131660	131678	131658	131658	Coningsby	329	" I am nothing ; I can not cope with him ; I retire from the field . "
131679	131683	131685	131697	Sir Joseph , who did not clearly catch the drift of these observations	4592	" What field ? "
131699	131752	131685	131697	Sir Joseph , who did not clearly catch the drift of these observations	4592	" It appears to me that a field for action is exactly what Sidonia wants . There is no vent for his abilities and intelligence . He wastes his energy in travelling from capital to capital like a King 's messenger . The morning after his fête he is going to Madrid . "
131938	131944	131929	131929	Edith	580	" Is this indeed farewell ? "
132005	132014	132016	132016	Coningsby	329	" We will say farewell at the ball , "
133105	133117	133119	133119	Edith	580	" And you are not going to Astrachan to - morrow ? "
133121	133127	133129	133129	Coningsby	329	" Not to - morrow , "
133131	133153	133129	133129	Coningsby	329	" You know that you said once that life was too stirring in these days to permit travel to a man ? "
133154	133161	133163	133163	Coningsby	329	" I wish nothing was stirring , "
133165	133184	133163	133163	Coningsby	329	" I wish nothing to change . All that I wish is , that this fête should never end "
133185	133202	133129	133129	Coningsby	329	" Is it possible , that you can be capricious ! You perplex me very much . "
133203	133213	133163	133163	Coningsby	329	" Am I capricious , because I dislike change ? "
133214	133218	133163	133163	Coningsby	329	" But Astrachan ? "
133219	133234	133236	133236	Coningsby	329	" It was the air of the Luxembourg that reminded me of the desart , "
133324	133332	133334	133334	Sidonia	625	" Where have you been , child , "
133336	133356	133334	133334	Sidonia	625	" that I have not seen you for some days ? I am going to Madrid to - morrow . "
133357	133369	133334	133334	Sidonia	625	" And I must think , I suppose , of Cambridge . "
133370	133420	133334	133334	Sidonia	625	" Well , you have seen something ; you will find it more profitable when you have digested it ; and you will have opportunity . That 's the true spring of wisdom : meditate over the past . Adventure and Contemplation share our being like day and night . "
134767	134772	134773	134773	he	4725	" Well , Coningsby ! "
134781	134795	134773	134773	he	4725	" By Jove , my dear Millbank , we have met at last , "
135313	135333	135289	135289	he	4725	" a portrait , a portrait of a lady ; was it a portrait , or an ideal countenance ? "
135409	135413	135414	135414	Millbank	580	" picked up . "

136027	136057	136011	136011	Coningsby	329	" I was pleased , I mean surprised to hear that there was still a Miss Millbank ; I thought by this time she might have borne another name ? "
136074	136109	136058	136059	Lady Wallinger	746	" Yes , Edith was very much admired ; but she need not be precipitate in marrying . Marriage is for a woman the event . Edith is too precious to be carelessly bestowed . "
136110	136115	136117	136117	Coningsby	329	" But I understood , "
136119	136125	136117	136117	Coningsby	329	" when I left Paris , "
136133	136146	136128	136128	he	972	" that Miss Millbank was engaged , on the point of marriage . "
136147	136151	136058	136059	Lady Wallinger	746	" With whom ? "
136152	136158	136128	136128	he	972	" Our friend , Sidonia . "
136159	136185	136187	136188	Lady Wallinger	746	" I am sure that Edith would never marry Monsieur de Sidonia , nor Monsieur de Sidonia , Edith . ' Tis a preposterous idea , "
136190	136198	136200	136200	Coningsby	329	" But he very much admired her ? "
136206	136209	136211	136212	Lady Wallinger	746	" Possibly , "
136214	136223	136211	136212	Lady Wallinger	746	" but he never even intimated his admiration . "
136224	136234	136128	136128	he	972	" But he was very attentive to Miss Millbank ? "
136235	136248	136128	136128	he	972	" Not more than our intimate friendship authorised , and might expect . "
136249	136258	136211	136212	Lady Wallinger	746	" You have known Sidonia a long time ? "
136259	136277	136279	136280	Lady Wallinger	746	" It was Monsieur de Sidonia 's father who introduced us to the care of Mr. Wallinger , "
136282	136487	136279	136280	Lady Wallinger	746	" and therefore I have ever entertained for his son a most sincere regard . Besides I look upon him as a compatriot . Recently he has been even more than usually kind to us,—especially to Edith . While we were at Paris he recovered for her a great number of jewels which had been left to her by her uncle in Spain , and , what she prized infinitely more , the whole of her mother 's correspondence which she maintained with this relative since her marriage . Nothing but the influence of Sidonia could have effected this . Therefore of course Edith is attached to him , almost as much as I am . In short , he is our dearest friend ; our counsellor in all our cares . But as for marrying him , the idea is ridiculous to those who know Monsieur Sidonia . No earthly consideration would ever induce him to impair that purity of race on which he prides himself . Besides there are other obvious objections , which would render an alliance between him and my niece utterly impossible ; Edith is quite as devoted to her religion as Monsieur Sidonia can be to his race . "
137513	137559	137510	137510	Millbank	377	" Now tell me , Coningsby , exactly what you conceive to be the state of parties in this country ; for it seems to me that if we penetrate the surface , the classification must be more simple than their many names would intimate . "

Nevertheless if we are forced to revolutions , let us propose to our consideration the idea of a free monarchy , established on fundamental laws , itself the apex of a vast pile of municipal and local government , ruling an educated people , represented by a free and intellectual press , Before such a royal authority , supported by such a national opinion , the sectional anomalies of our country would disappear . Under such a system , where qualification would not be parliamentary , but personal , even statesmen would be educated ; we should have no more diplomatists who could not speak French ; no more bishops ignorant of theology ; no more generals - in - chief who never saw a field .

139688	140081	139673	139674	the Church	1228	" What can be more anomalous than the present connection between State and Church ? Every condition on which it was originally consented to has been cancelled . That original alliance was in my view an equal calamity for the Nation and the Church ; but at least it was an intelligible compact . Parliament , then consisting only of members of the established Church was on ecclesiastical matters , a lay synod , and might in some points of view be esteemed a necessary portion of Church government . But you have effaced this exclusive character of parliament ; you have determined that a communion with the established Church shall no longer be part of the qualification for sitting in the House of Commons . There is no reason , as far as the constitution avails , why every member of the House of Commons should not be a dissenter . But the whole power of the country is concentred in the House of Commons . The House of Lords , even the Monarch himself , has openly announced and confessed , within these ten years that the will of the House of Commons is supreme . A single vote of the House of Commons in 1832 made the Duke of Wellington declare in the House of Lords that he was obliged to abandon his sovereign in ' the most difficult and distressing circumstances . ' The House of Commons is absolute . It is the state . ' L'Etat , c'est moi . ' The House of Commons virtually appoints the bishops . A sectarian assembly appoints the bishops of the established Church . They may appoint twenty Hoadleys . James II . was expelled the throne because he appointed a Roman Catholic to an Anglican see . A parliament might do this to - morrow with impunity . And this is the Constitution in Church and State which Conservative dinners toast ! The only consequences of the present union of Church and State are , that , on the side of the State there is perpetual interference in ecclesiastical government , and on the side of the Church a sedulous avoidance of all those principles on which alone Church government can be established , and by the influence of which alone can the Church of England again become universal . "
140082	140094	139673	139674	the Church	1228	" But it is urged that the State protects its revenues ? "
140095	140312	139673	139674	the Church	1228	" No ecclesiastical revenues should be safe , that require protection . Modern history is a history of Church spoliation . And by whom ? Not by the people ; not by the democracy . No , it is the Emperor , the King , the feudal Baron , the court Minion . The estate of the Church is the estate of the People , as long as the Church is governed on its real principles . The Church is the medium by which the despised and degraded classes assert the native equality of man , and vindicate the rights and power of Intellect . It made in the darkest hour of Norman rule , the son of a Saxon pedlar Primate of England ; and placed Nicholas Breakspear , a Hertfordshire peasant , on the throne of the Cæsars . It would do as great things now , if it were divorced from the degrading and tyrannical connection that enchains it . You would have other sons of peasants Bishops of England instead of men appointed to that sacred office solely because they were the needy scions of a factitious aristocracy ; men of gross ignorance , profligate habits , and grinding extortion ; who have disgraced the episcopal throne , and profaned the altar . "
140313	140329	139673	139674	the Church	1228	" But surely you can not justly extend such a description to the present bench . "
140330	140458	139673	139674	the Church	1228	" Surely not : I speak of the past ; of the past that has produced so much present evil . We live in decent times ; frigid , latitudinarian , alarmed , decorous . A priest is scarcely deemed in our days a fit successor of the authors of the gospels , if he be not the editor of a Greek play ; and he who follows St. Paul must now at least have been private tutor of some young nobleman , who has taken a good degree ! And then you are all astonished that the Church is not universal ! Why ! nothing but the indestructibleness of its principles , however feebly pursued , could have maintained even the disorganised body that still survives . "

141149	142257	141114	141115	dear Millbank	377	" The beautiful light of summer had never shone on a scene and surrounding landscape which recalled happier images of English nature , and sweeter recollections of English manners , than that to which we would now introduce our readers . One of those true old English Halls now unhappily so rare , built in the time of the Tudors , and in its elaborate timber framing and decorative woodwork , indicating perhaps the scarcity of brick and stone at the period of its structure as much as the grotesque genius of its fabricator , rose on a terrace surrounded by ancient and very formal gardens . The hall itself during many generations had been vigilantly and tastefully preserved by its proprietors . There was not a point which was not as fresh as if it had been renovated but yesterday . It stood a huge and strange blending of Grecian , Gothic , and Italian architecture , with a wild dash of the Fantastic in addition . The lantern watch - towers of a baronial castle were placed in juxta position with Doric columns employed for chimneys , while under oriel windows might be observed Italian doorways with Grecian pediments . Beyond the extensive gardens , an avenue of Spanish chestnuts at each point of the compass approached the mansion , or led into a small park which was table land , its limits opening on all sides to beautiful and extensive valleys , sparkling with cultivation , except at one point , where the river Darl formed the boundary of the domain , and then spread in many a winding through the rich country beyond . Such was Hellingsley , the new home that Oswald Millbank was about to visit for the first time . Coningsby and himself had travelled together as far as Darlford , where their roads diverged , and they had separated with an engagement on the part of Coningsby to visit Hellingsley on the morrow . As they had travelled along , Coningsby had frequently led the conversation to domestic topics : gradually he had talked , and talked much , of Edith . Without an obtrusive curiosity , he extracted unconsciously to his companion traits of her character and early days , which filled him with a wild and secret interest . The thought that in a few hours , he was to meet her again , infused into his being a degree of transport , which the very necessity of repressing before his companion , rendered more magical and thrilling . How often it happens in life , that we have with a grave face to discourse of the most ordinary topics , while , all the time our heart and memory are engrossed with some enchanting secret ! The Castle of his grandfather presented a far different scene on the arrival of Coningsby to that which it had offered on his first visit . The Marquess had given him a formal permission to repair to it at his pleasure , and had instructed the steward accordingly . But he came without notice , at a season of the year when the absence of all sports made his arrival unexpected . The scattered and sauntering household roused themselves into action , and contemplated the conviction that it might be necessary to do some service for their wages . There was a stir in that vast , sleepy castle . At last the steward was found , and came forward to welcome their young master , whose simple wants were limited to the rooms he had formerly occupied . Coningsby reached the castle a little before sunset , almost the same hour that he had arrived there more than three years ago . How much had happened in the interval ! Coningsby had already lived long enough to find interest in pondering over the past . That past too must inevitably exercise a great influence over his present . He recalled his morning drive with his grandfather to the brink of that river , which was the boundary between his own domain and Hellingsley . Who dwelt at Hellingsley now ? Restless , excited , not insensible to the difficulties , perhaps the dangers , of his position , yet full of an entrancing emotion in which all thoughts and feelings seemed to merge , Coningsby went forth into the fair gardens to muse over his love amid objects as beautiful . A rosy light hung over the rare shrubs and tall fantastic trees ; while a rich yet darker tint suffused the distant woods . This euthanasia of the day exercises a strange influence on the hearts of those who love . Who has not felt it ? Magical emotions that touch the immortal part ! But as for Coningsby , the mitigating hour that softens the heart made his spirit brave . Amid the ennobling sympathies of nature , the pursuits and purposes of worldly prudence and conventional advantage subsided into their essential nothingness . He willed to blend his life and fate with a being beautiful as that nature that subdued him , and he felt in his own breast the intrinsic energies that in spite of all obstacles should mould such an imagination into reality . He descended the slopes , now growing dimmer in the fleeting light , into the park . The stillness was almost supernatural ; the jocund sounds of day had died , and the voices of the night had not commenced . His heart too was still . A sacred calm had succeeded to that distraction of emotion which had agitated him the whole day , while he had mused over his love and the infinite and insurmountable barriers that seemed to oppose his will . Now he felt one of those strong groundless convictions that are the inspiration of passion , that all would yield to him as to one holding an enchanted wand . Onward he strolled ; it seemed without purpose , yet always proceeding . A pale and then gleaming tint stole over the masses of mighty timber ; and soon a glittering light flooded the lawns and glades . The moon was high in her summer heaven , and still Coningsby strolled on . He crossed the broad lawns , he traversed the bright glades : amid the gleaming and shadowy woods , he traced his prescient way . He came to the bank of a rushing river , foaming in the moonlight , and wafting on its blue breast the shadow of a thousand stars . "

142282	142415	142419	142419	he	4912	" Lady Wallinger and Edith were together in the morning room of Hellingsley , the morrow after the arrival of Oswald . Edith was arranging flowers in a vase , while her aunt was embroidering a Spanish peasant in correct costume . The daughter of Millbank looked as bright and fragrant as the fair creations that surrounded her . Beautiful to watch her as she arranged their forms and composed their groups ; to mark her eye glance with gratification at some happy combination of colour , or to listen to her delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume . Oswald and Sir Joseph were surveying the stables ; Mr. Millbank , who had been daily expected for the last week from the factories , had not yet arrived . "
142427	142432	142419	142419	he	4912	" said Lady Wallinger . "

142540	142545	142532	142532	I	0	" said Lady Wallinger . "

142574	142578	142563	142563	Oswald	377	" said Edith . "
142583	142588	142589	142589	Oswald	377	" said Lady Wallinger . "
142654	142655	142642	142642	Edith	580	" "
142662	142668	142642	142642	Edith	580	" said Edith , smiling , "
142683	142684	142680	142681	Lord Beaumanoir	374	" "
142695	142700	142686	142686	I	0	" said Lady Wallinger , "
142729	142759	142724	142724	he	1206	" As Lady Wallinger gave a finishing stroke to the jacket of her Andalusian , Edith vividly blushing , yet speaking in a voice of affected calmness , said , "
142767	143407	142762	142763	Mr. Coningsby	329	" And truly at this moment our hero might be discerned approaching the Hall by one of the avenues ; and in a few minutes , there was a ringing at the Hall bell , and then after a short pause , the servants announced Mr. Coningsby , and ushered him into the morning room . Edith was embarrassed ; the frankness and the gaiety of her manner had deserted her ; Coningsby was rather earnest than self - possessed . Each felt at first , that the presence of Lady Wallinger was a relief . The ordinary topics of conversation were in sufficient plenty ; reminiscences of Paris , impressions of Hellingsley , his visit to Oxford , Lady Wallinger 's visit to Cambridge . In ten minutes , their voices seemed to sound to each other as they did in the Rue de Rivoli , and their mutual perplexity had in a great degree subsided . Oswald and Sir Joseph now entered the room , and the conversation became general . Hellingsley was the subject on which Coningsby dwelt ; he was charmed with all that he had seen ; wished to see more . Sir Joseph was quite prepared to accompany him ; but Lady Wallinger who seemed to read Coningsby 's wishes in his eyes , proposed that the inspection should be general ; and in the course of half an hour , Coningsby was walking by the side of Edith , and sympathising with all the natural charms to which her quick taste and lively expression called his notice and appreciation . Few things more delightful than a country ramble with a sweet companion ! Exploring woods , wandering over green commons , loitering in shady lanes , resting on rural stiles ; the air full of perfume , the heart full of bliss ! It seemed to Coningsby that he had never been happy before . A thrilling joy pervaded his being . He could have sung like a bird . His heart was as sunny as the summer scene . Past and Future were absorbed in the flowing hour ; not an allusion to Paris , not a speculation on what might arrive ; but infinite expressions of agreement , sympathy ; a multitude of slight phrases , that however couched , had but one meaning ; congeniality . He felt each moment her voice becoming more tender ; his heart gushing in soft expressions ; each moment he was more fascinated ; her step was grace , her glance was beauty ; now she touched him by some phrase of sweet simplicity ; or carried him spell - bound by her airy merriment . Oswald assumed that Coningsby remained to dine with them . There was not even the ceremony of invitation . Coningsby could not but remember his dinner at Millbank , and the timid hostess whom he then addressed so often in vain , as he gazed on the bewitching and accomplished woman whom he now passionately loved . It was a most agreeable dinner . Oswald , happy in his friend being his guest under his own roof , indulged in unwonted gaiety . The ladies withdrew ; Sir Joseph began to talk politics , although the young men had threatened their fair companions immediately to follow them . This was the period of the Bed - Chamber Plot , when Sir Robert Peel accepted and resigned power in the course of three days . Sir Joseph , who had originally made up his mind to support a Conservative government when he deemed it inevitable , had for the last month endeavoured to compensate for this trifling error by vindicating the conduct of his friends , and reprobating the behaviour of those who would deprive her Majesty of the "
143413	143423	143426	143426	her	4928	" Sir Joseph was a most chivalrous champion of the "
143428	143496	143497	143497	I	0	" principle . Sir Joseph who was always moderate and conciliatory in his talk , though he would go , at any time , any lengths for his party , expressed himself to - day with extreme sobriety , as he was determined not to hurt the feelings of Mr. Coningsby , and he principally confined himself to urging temperate questions , somewhat in the following fashion : "
143549	143589	143592	143592	her	4928	" Sir Joseph was extremely astonished when Coningsby replied that he thought under no circumstances should any appointment in the Royal Household be dependent on the voice of the House of Commons , though he was far from admiring the "
143594	143605	143592	143592	her	4928	" principle , which he looked upon as very impertinent . "
143609	143614	143592	143592	her	4928	" said Sir Joseph , "
143638	143639	143592	143592	her	4928	" "
143651	143655	143643	143643	you	367	" inquired Coningsby . "
143666	143725	143643	143643	you	367	" inquired Millbank . Sir Joseph seemed a little confused . He had always heard that Ministers were responsible to Parliament ; and he had a vague conviction , notwithstanding the reanimating loyalty of the Bed - Chamber Plot , that the Sovereign of England was a nonentity . He took refuge in indefinite expressions , and observed , "
143736	143737	143738	143742	The Ministers of the Crown	4936	" "
143757	143758	143738	143742	The Ministers of the Crown	4936	" "
143765	143770	143738	143742	The Ministers of the Crown	4936	" said Sir Joseph , "
143785	143786	143738	143742	The Ministers of the Crown	4936	" "
143792	143796	143738	143742	The Ministers of the Crown	4936	" said Coningsby ; "
143814	143815	143804	143804	We	4942	" "
143820	143825	143804	143804	We	4942	" said Sir Joseph . "
143830	143834	143804	143804	We	4942	" said Millbank . "
143881	143882	143883	143883	King	4946	" "
143893	143898	143900	143900	they	4949	" exclaimed Sir Joseph . "
143904	143908	143900	143900	they	4949	" said Coningsby , "

143952	143956	143925	143925	Your	4953	" said Millbank , "

143986	143990	143976	143976	We	4942	" said Coningsby , "

144016	144022	144005	144005	I	0	" said Sir Joseph bewildered . "
144035	144039	144024	144024	you	4953	" said Coningsby , "
144050	144051	144052	144052	I	0	" "
144072	144077	144060	144070	very few men on our side in the House of Commons	4958	" said Sir Joseph , "
144090	144091	144096	144097	the ladies	1281	" "
144099	144113	144096	144097	the ladies	1281	" said Millbank smiling . Edith was reading a letter as they entered . "
144119	144131	144117	144117	papa	6785	" she exclaimed looking up at her brother with great animation . "
144150	144179	144180	144180	You	4962	" They now all spoke of Millbank , and Coningsby was happy that he was familiar with the scene . At length he ventured to say to Edith , "
144199	144200	144191	144191	I	0	" "
144207	144208	144212	144212	you	4962	" "
144223	144224	144212	144212	you	4962	" "
144231	144232	144225	144225	Your	4962	" "
144240	145199	144225	144225	Your	4962	" Then they spoke for awhile of other recollections , and then , Coningsby appealing to Lady Wallinger for her influence , Edith rose and took up her guitar . Her voice was rich and sweet ; the air she sang gay , even fantastically frolick ; such as the girls of Granada chaunt trooping home from some country festival ; her soft , dark eye brightened with joyous sympathy ; and ever and anon , with an arch grace , she beat the guitar , in chorus , with her pretty hand . The moon wanes ; and Coningsby must leave these enchanted halls . Oswald walked homeward with him , until he reached the domain of his grandfather . Then mounting his horse , Coningsby bade his friend farewell till the morrow , and made his best way to the Castle . There is a romance in every life . The emblazoned page of Coningsby 's existence was now open . It had been prosperous before ; with some moments of excitement ; some of delight ; but they had all found , as it were , their origin in worldly considerations , or been inevitably mixed up with them . At Paris for example , he loved , or thought he loved . But there not an hour could elapse without his meeting some person , or hearing something , which disturbed the beauty of his emotions or broke his spellbound thoughts . There was his grandfather hating the Millbanks or Sidonia loving them ; and common people in the common world making common observations on them ; asking who they were , or telling who they were ; and brushing the bloom of all life 's fresh delicious fancies with their coarse handling . But now his feelings were ethereal . He loved , passionately — and he loved in a scene and in a society as sweet , as pure , and as refined , as his imagination and his heart . There was no malicious gossip , no callous chatter , to profane his ear and desecrate his sentiment . All that he heard or saw was worthy of the summer sky , the still green woods , the gushing river , the gardens and terraces , the stately and fantastic dwellings , among which his life now glided as in some dainty and gorgeous masque . All the soft , social domestic sympathies of his nature which , however abundant , had never been cultivated , were developed by the life he was now leading . It was not merely that he lived in the constant presence , and under the constant influence of one whom he adored , that made him so happy . He was surrounded by beings who found felicity in the interchange of kind feelings and kind words ; in the cultivation of happy talents and refined tastes ; and the enjoyment of a life which their own good sense and own good hearts made them both comprehend and appreciate . Ambition lost much of its splendour , even his lofty aspirations something of their hallowing impulse of paramount duty , when Coningsby felt how much ennobling delight was consistent with the seclusion of a private station ; and mused over an existence to be passed amid woods and waterfalls with a fair hand locked in his ; or surrounded by his friends in some ancestral hall . The morning after his first visit to Hellingsley , Coningsby rejoined his friends , as he had promised Oswald at their breakfast table ; and day after day , he came with the early sun , and left them only when the late moon silvered the keep of Coningsby Castle . Mr. Millbank who wrote daily , and was daily to be expected , did not arrive . A week , a week of unbroken bliss , had vanished away — passed in long rides and longer walks ; sunset saunterings , and sometimes moonlit strolls ; talking of flowers , and thinking of things even sweeter ; listening to delicious songs , and sometimes reading aloud some bright romance , or some inspiring lay . One day , Coningsby who arrived at the Hall unexpectedly late ; indeed it was some hours past noon , for he had been detained by despatches which arrived at the Castle from Mr. Rigby and which required his interposition ; found the ladies alone , and was told that Sir Joseph and Oswald were at the fishing cottage , where they wished him to join them . He was in no haste to do this ; and Lady Wallinger proposed , that when they felt inclined to ramble , they should all walk down to the fishing cottage together . So seating himself by the side of Edith who was tinting a sketch which she had made of a rich oriel of Hellingsley , the morning passed away in that slight and yet subtle talk in which a lover delights , and in which , while asking a thousand questions , that seem at the first glance , sufficiently trifling , he is indeed often conveying a meaning that is not expressed , or attempting to discover a feeling that is hidden . And these are occasions , when glances meet , and glances are withdrawn : the tongue may speak idly , the eye is more eloquent ; and often more true . Coningsby looked up ; Lady Wallinger who had more than once announced , that she was going to put on her bonnet , was gone . Yet still he continued to talk trifles ; and still Edith listened . "
145208	145212	145203	145203	you	4963	" said Edith , "
145248	145249	145250	145250	You	4963	" "
145256	145260	145261	145261	He	538	" said Coningsby . "
145270	145271	145272	145272	You	4963	" "
145296	145297	145280	145280	Oswald	377	" "
145317	145318	145319	145319	Edith	580	" "
145321	145337	145319	145319	Edith	580	" said Lady Wallinger looking into the room from the garden with her bonnet on , "
145347	145348	145338	145338	you	580	" "
145355	145384	145338	145338	you	580	" And yet they did not move . There were yet a few pencil touches to be given to the tinted sketch ; Coningsby would cut the pencils . "
145390	145394	145386	145386	you	580	" he said , "
145437	145474	145475	145475	I	0	" A blush suffused the cheek of Edith , she turned her head a little aside , as if she were arranging some drawings . And then she said in a somewhat hushed and hesitating voice , "
145517	146397	146398	146398	Edith	580	" and she rose , and promising immediately to return , left the room . Coningsby leant over the mantle in deep abstraction , gazing vacantly on a miniature of the father of Edith . A light step roused him ; she had returned , Unconsciously he greeted her with a glance of ineffable tenderness . They went forth ; it was a grey , sultry day . Indeed it was the covered sky which had led to the fishing scheme of the morning ; Sir Joseph was a very expert and accomplished angler ; and the Darl was renowned for its sport . They lingered before they reached the terrace where they were to find Lady Wallinger , observing the different points of view which the Hall presented , and debating which was to form the subject of Coningsby 's drawing ; for already it was to be not merely a sketch , but a drawing , the most finished that the bright and effective pencil of Edith could achieve . If it really were to be placed in his room , and were to be a memorial of Hellingsley , her artistic reputation demanded a master - piece . They reached the terrace : Lady Wallinger was not there ; nor could they observe her in the vicinity . Coningsby was quite certain that she had gone onward to the fishing cottage , and expected them to follow her ; and he convinced Edith of the justness of his opinion . To the fishing cottage therefore they bent their steps . They emerged from the gardens into the Park , sauntering over the table land , and seeking as much as possible the shade in the soft but oppressive atmosphere . At the limit of the table land their course lay by a wild and winding path through a gradual and wooded declivity . While they were yet in this craggy and romantic woodland , the big , fervent drops began to fall . Coningsby urged Edith to seek at once a natural shelter ; but she , who knew the country , assured him that the fishing cottage was close by , and that they might reach it before the rain could do them any harm . And truly at this moment emerging from the wood , they found themselves in the valley of the Darl . The river here was narrow and winding , but full of life ; rushing and clear , but for the dark sky it reflected ; with high banks of turf and tall trees ; the silver birch , above all others , in clustering groups ; infinitely picturesque . At the turn of the river , about two hundred yards distant , Coningsby observed the low , dark roof of the fishing cottage on its banks . They descended from the woods to the margin of the stream , by a flight of turfen steps , Coningsby holding Edith 's hand as he guided her progress . The drops became thicker ; they reached , at a rapid pace , the cottage . The absent boat indicated that Sir Joseph and Oswald were on the river . The cottage was an old building of rustic logs , with a very shelving roof so that you might obtain sufficient shelter without entering its walls . Coningsby found a rough garden seat for Edith . The shower was now violent . Nature , like man , sometimes weeps from gladness . It is the joy and tenderness of her heart that seek relief ; and these are summer showers . In this instance , the vehemence of her emotion was transient , though the tears kept stealing down her cheek for a long time , and gentle sighs and sobs might for some period be distinguished . The oppressive atmosphere had evaporated ; the grey , sullen tint had disappeared ; a soft breeze came dancing up the stream ; a glowing light fell upon the woods and waters ; the perfume of trees and flowers and herbs floated around . There was a carolling of birds ; a hum of happy insects in the air ; freshness and stir , and a sense of joyous life , pervaded all things ; it seemed that the heart of all creation opened . Coningsby , after repeatedly watching the shower with Edith , and speculating on its progress which did not much annoy them , had seated himself on a log almost at her feet . And assuredly a maiden and a youth more beautiful and engaging had seldom met before in a scene more fresh and fair . Edith on her rustic seat watched the now blue and foaming river , and the birch trees with a livelier tint , and quivering in the sunset air ; an expression of tranquil bliss suffused her beautiful brow , and spoke from the thrilling tenderness of her soft dark eye . Coningsby gazed on that countenance with a glance of entranced rapture . His cheek was flushed , his eye gleamed with dazzling lustre . She turned her head , she met that glance , and , troubled , she withdrew her own . "
146400	146411	146398	146398	Edith	580	" he said , in a tone of tremulous passion , "
146420	146429	146431	146431	me	0	" he continued , gently taking her hand , "
146441	146770	146437	146437	I	0	" She did not withdraw her hand ; but turned away a face flushed as the impending twilight . It was past the dinner hour when Edith and Coningsby reached the Hall ; an embarrassing circumstance , but mitigated by the conviction , that they had not to encounter a very critical inspection . What then were their feelings , when the first servant that they met informed them , that Mr. Millbank had arrived ! Edith never could have believed , that the return of her beloved father to his home could ever have been to her other than a cause of delight . And yet now she trembled when she heard the announcement . The mysteries of love were fast involving her existence . But this was not the season of meditation . Her heart was still agitated by the tremulous admission that she responded to that fervent and adoring love whose eloquent music still sounded in her ear , and the pictures of whose fanciful devotion flitted over her agitated vision . Unconsciously she pressed the arm of Coningsby as the servant spoke , and then without looking into his face , whispering him to be quick , she sprang away . As for Coningsby , notwithstanding the elation of his heart , and the ethereal joy which flowed in all his veins , the name of Mr. Millbank sounded something like a knell . However this was not the time to reflect . He obeyed the hint of Edith ; made the most rapid toilette that ever was consummated by a happy lover , and in a few minutes entered the drawing - room of Hellingsley ; to encounter the gentleman whom he hoped by some means or other , quite inconceivable , might some day be transformed into his father - in - law , and the fulfilment of his consequent duties towards whom he had commenced by keeping him waiting for dinner . "
146778	146789	146790	146790	You	4975	" said Mr. Millbank , extending his hand to Coningsby . "
146799	147219	146790	146790	You	4975	" Coningsby looked round to the kind Lady Wallinger , and half addressed his murmured answer to her , explaining how they had lost her , and their way , and were caught in a storm or a shower , which as it terminated about three hours back , and the fishing cottage was little more than a mile from the Hall , very satisfactorily accounted for their not being in time for dinner . Lady Wallinger then said something about the lowering clouds having frightened her from the terrace , and Sir Joseph and Oswald talked a little of their sport , and of their having seen an otter ; but there was or at least there seemed to Coningsby a tone of general embarrassment which distressed him . The fact is keeping people for dinner under any circumstances is distressing . They are obliged to talk at the very moment when they wish to use their powers of expression for a very different purpose . They are faint , and conversation makes them more exhausted . A gentleman too , fond of his family , who in turn are devoted to him , making a great and inconvenient effort to reach them by dinner time ; to please and surprise them ; and finding them all dispersed , dinner so late , that he might have reached home in good time without any great inconvenient effort , his daughter whom he has wished a thousand times to embrace , taking a singularly long ramble with no other companion than a young gentleman , whom he did not exactly expect to see ; all these are circumstances individually perhaps slight , and yet encountered collectively , it may be doubted whether they would not a little ruffle even the sweetest temper . Mr. Millbank too had not the sweetest temper , though not a bad one ; a little quick and fiery . But then he had a kind heart . And when Edith , who had providentially sent down a message to order dinner , entered and embraced him at the very moment that dinner was announced , her father forgot everything in his joy in seeing her , and his pleasure in being surrounded by his friends . He gave his hand to Lady Wallinger ; and Sir Joseph led away his niece . Coningsby put his arm round the astonished neck of Oswald as if they were once more in the playing fields of Eton . "
147227	147231	147223	147225	my dear fellow	2606	" he exclaimed , "
147243	147568	147223	147225	my dear fellow	2606	" As Edith headed her father 's table , according to his rigid rule , Coningsby was on one side of her . They never spoke so little ; Coningsby would have never unclosed his lips , had he followed his humour . He was in a stupor of happiness ; the dining - room took the appearance of the fishing cottage ; and he saw nothing but the flowing river . Lady Wallinger was however next to him , and that was a relief ; for he felt always she was his friend . Sir Joseph a good - hearted man , and on subjects with which he was acquainted full of sound sense , was invaluable to - day , for he entirely kept up the conversation , speaking of things which greatly interested Mr. Millbank . And so their host soon recovered his good temper ; he addressed several times his observations to Coningsby , and was careful to take wine with him . On the whole , affairs went on flowingly enough . The gentlemen indeed stayed much longer over their wine than on the preceding days , and Coningsby did not venture on the liberty of quitting the room before his host . It was as well . Edith required repose . She tried to seek it on the bosom of her aunt , as she breathed to her the delicious secret of her life . When the gentlemen returned to the drawing - room , the ladies were not there . This rather disturbed Mr. Millbank again ; he had not seen enough of his daughter ; he wished to hear her sing . But Edith managed to reappear ; and even to sing . Then Coningsby went up to her and asked her to sing the song of the Girls of Granada . She said in a low voice , and with a fond yet serious look , "
147586	147745	147582	147582	you	4980	" She sang it and with inexpressible grace , and with an arch vivacity , that to a fine observer would have singularly contrasted with the almost solemn and even troubled expression of her countenance a moment afterwards . The day was about to die ; the day the most important , the most precious , in the lives of Harry Coningsby and Edith Millbank . Words had been spoken , vows breathed , which were to influence their careers for ever . For them hereafter there was to be but one life , one destiny , one world . Each of them was still in such a state of tremulous excitement , that neither had found time or occasion to ponder over the mighty result . They both required solitude ; they both longed to be alone . Coningsby rose to depart . He pressed the soft hand of Edith , and his glance spoke his soul . "
147758	147806	147756	147756	Coningsby	401	" said Oswald , very loud , knowing that the presence of his father would make Coningsby hesitate about coming . Edith 's heart fluttered ; but she said nothing . It was with delight she heard her father , after a moment 's pause , say , "
147817	147818	147809	147809	I	0	" "
147827	147831	147809	147809	I	0	" said Coningsby , "
147863	148589	147839	147839	I	0	" To be alone ; to have no need of feigning a tranquillity he could not feel ; of coining common - place courtesy , when his heart was gushing with rapture ; this was a great relief for Coningsby , though gained by a separation from Edith . The deed was done ; he had breathed his long brooding passion , he had received the sweet expression of her sympathy , he had gained the long coveted heart . Youth , beauty , love , the innocence of unsophisticated breasts , and the inspiration of an exquisite nature , combined to fashion the spell that now entranced his life . He turned to gaze upon the moonlit towers and peaked roofs of Hellingsley . Silent and dreamlike , the picturesque pile rested on its broad terrace flooded with the silver light , and surrounded by the quaint bowers of its fantastic gardens tipped by the glittering beam . Half hid in deep shadow , half sparkling in the mid - night blaze , he recognized the oriel window that had been the subject of the morning 's sketch . Almost he wished there should be some sound to assure him of his reality . But nothing broke the all - pervading stillness . Was his life to be as bright and as tranquil ? And what was to be his life ? Whither was he to bear the beautiful bride he had gained ? Were the portals of Coningsby the proud and hospitable gates that were to greet her ? How long would they greet him after the achievement of the last four and twenty hours was known to their Lord ? Was this the return for the confiding kindness of his grandsire ? That he should pledge his troth to the daughter of that grandsire 's foe ? Away with such dark and scaring vision ! Is it not the noon of a summer night fragrant with the breath of gardens , bright with the beam that lovers love , and soft with the breath of Ausonian breezes ? Within that sweet and stately residence , dwells there not a maiden fair enough to revive chivalry ; who is even now thinking of him as she leans on her pensive hand , or if perchance she dream , recalls him in her visions ? And himself , is he one who would cry craven with such a lot ! What avail his golden youth , his high blood , his daring and devising spirit , and all his stores of wisdom , if they help not now ! Does not he feel the energy divine that can confront fate and carve out fortunes ? Besides it is nigh Midsummer Eve , and what should fairies reign for , but to aid such a bright pair as this ? He recalls a thousand times the scene , the moment , in which but a few hours past , he dared to tell her that he loved ; he recalls a thousand times the still , small voice , that murmured her agitated felicity ; more than a thousand times , for his heart clenched the idea as a diver grasps a gem , he recalls the enraptured yet gentle embrace , that had sealed upon her blushing cheek his mystical and delicious sovereignty . The morning broke lowering and thunderous ; small white clouds , dull and immovable , studded the leaden sky ; the waters of the rushing Darl seemed to have become black and almost stagnant ; the terraces of Hellingsley looked like the hard lines of a model ; and the mansion itself had a harsh and metallic character . Before the chief portal of his Hall , the elder Millbank , with an air of some anxiety , surveyed the landscape and the heavens , as if he were speculating on the destiny of the day . Often his eye wandered over the partk ; often with an uneasy and restless step he paced the raised walk before him . The clock of Hellingsley church had given the chimes of noon . His son and Coningsby appeared at the end of one of the avenues . His eye lightened ; his lip became compressed ; he advanced to meet them . "
148601	148608	148609	148609	We	4985	" he inquired of his son . "
148618	148619	148609	148609	We	4985	" "
148630	148662	148626	148626	I	0	" he observed as he turned towards the Hall with them . Coningsby remarked the fanciful beauty of the portal ; its twisted columns , and Caryatides carved in dark oak . "
148670	148674	148626	148626	I	0	" said Millbank , "

148733	148740	148726	148726	She	580	" said the father rather sharply . "
148750	148754	148741	148741	We	4985	" said Oswald . "
148772	148776	148755	148755	I	0	" said Coningsby . "
148788	148793	148786	148786	Oswald	377	" said Mr. Millbank , "
148810	148871	148872	148872	You	329	" The habit of obedience which was supreme in this family instantly carried Oswald away , though he was rather puzzled why his father should be so particularly anxious about the preparation of the fishing tackle , as he very rarely used it . His son had no sooner departed than Mr. Millbank turned to Coningsby and said very abruptly . "
148899	148982	148888	148888	I	0	" And thus speaking , he advanced before the astonished , and rather agitated Coningsby , and led the way through a door and long passage to a room of moderate dimensions , partly furnished as a library , and full of parliamentary papers and blue books . Shutting the door with some earnestness and pointing to a chair , he begged his guest to be seated . Both in their chairs , Mr. Millbank clearing his throat , said without preface , "
149000	149001	149002	149002	I	0	" "
149016	149032	149002	149002	I	0	" replied Coningsby in a calm and rather measured tone , but looking very pale . "

149061	149071	149053	149053	she	5747	" said Coningsby , his white cheek becoming scarlet . "

150006	150060	149999	149999	I	0	" Coningsby with his head resting on his arm his face a little shaded , his eyes fixed on the ground , listened in silence . There was a pause ; broken by Coningsby , as in a low voice , with out changing his posture or raising his glance , he said : "
150074	150075	150067	150067	you	5702	" "
150082	150091	150067	150067	you	5702	" replied Mr. Millbank with a kindling cheek , "

150167	150179	150124	150124	they	5043	" said Coningsby looking up , and speaking with much fervour . "

150283	150288	150270	150272	a young man	6100	" said Mr. Millbank . "
150314	150341	150307	150307	you	5048	" he continued , speaking with emphasis , leaning over the back of his chair and looking steadily at Coningsby with his grey , sagacious eye , "
150351	150352	150307	150307	you	5048	" "
150362	150366	150356	150356	you	5048	" exclaimed Coningsby . "

150724	150725	150726	150726	You	5048	" "
150736	150746	150747	150747	You	5048	" said Coningsby , in a tone of anguish . "
150753	150757	150747	150747	You	5048	" said Millbank , "
150955	150991	150994	150996	a young noble	5072	" Her faith was pledged to me ; I lived upon her image ; the day was even talked of when I should bear her to the home that I had proudly prepared for her . "
151114	151115	151097	151097	she	5075	" "
151119	151120	151097	151097	she	5075	" "
151131	151132	151097	151097	she	5075	" "
151136	151148	151133	151134	Dear sir	5077	" said Coningsby , rising and taking Mr. Millbank 's hand , "
151267	151329	151261	151261	God	477	" Proceeding down the avenue with a rapid and distempered step , his countenance lost as it were in a wild abstraction , Coningsby encountered Oswald Millbank . He stopped , collected his turbulent thoughts , and throwing on Oswald one glance that seemed at the same time to communicate woe and to demand sympathy , flung himself into his arms . "
151333	151345	151261	151261	God	477	" he exclaimed , and then added in a broken voice , "
151351	151653	151261	151261	God	477	" Then in a hurried , impassioned , and somewhat incoherent strain , leaning on Oswald 's arm , as they walked on together , he poured forth all that had occurred , all of which he had dreamed ; his baffled bliss , his actual despair . Alas ! there was little room for solace , and yet all that earnest affection could inspire and a sagacious brain and a brave spirit were offered for his support , if not his consolation , by the friend who was devoted to him . In the midst of this deep communion , teeming with every thought and sentiment that could enchain and absorb the spirit of man , they came to one of the park gates of Coningsby . Millbank stopped . The command of his father was peremptory , that no member of his family under any circumstances or for any consideration should set his foot on that domain . Lady Wallinger had once wished to have seen the Castle , and Coningsby was only too happy in the prospect of escorting her and Edith over the place ; but Oswald had then at once put his veto on the project , as a thing forbidden ; and which if put in practice his father would never pardon . So it passed off , and now Oswald himself was at the gates of that very domain with his friend who was about to enter them , his friend whom he might never see again , that Coningsby who from their boyish days had been the idol of his life , whom he had lived to see appeal to his affections and his sympathy , and whom Oswald was now going to desert in the midst of his lonely and unsolaced woe . "
151661	151675	151654	151654	I	0	" said Oswald holding the hand of Coningsby as he hesitated to advance ; "
151703	151895	151896	151896	We	5088	" The morning passed away in unceasing yet fruitless speculation on the future . One moment something was to happen , the next nothing could occur . Sometimes a beam of hope flashed over the fancy of Coningsby , and jumping up from the turf , on which they were reclining , he seemed to exult in his renovated energies ; and then this sanguine paroxysm was succeeded by a fit of depression so dark and dejected , that nothing but the presence of Oswald seemed to prevent Coningsby from flinging himself into the waters of the Darl . The day was fast declining , and the inevitable moment of separation was at hand . Oswald wished to appear at the dinner table of Hellingsley that no suspicion might arise in the mind of his father of his having accompanied Coningsby home . But just as he was beginning to mention the necessity of his departure , a flash of lightning seemed to transfix the heavens . The sky was very dark ; though studded here and there with dingy sports . The young men sprang up at the same time . "
151905	151909	151896	151896	We	5088	" said Oswald . "
151918	152174	152175	152175	You	5090	" said Coningsby . A clap of thunder that seemed to make the park quake broke over their heads , followed by some thick drops . The Castle was close at hand ; Oswald had avoided entering it ; but the impending storm was so menacing , that hurried on by Coningsby he could make no resistance ; and in a few minutes , the companions were watching the tempest from the windows of a room in Coningsby Castle . The forked lightning flashed and scintillated from every quarter of the horizon : the thunder broke over the Castle as if the keep were rocking with artillery : amid the momentary pauses of the explosion , the rain was heard descending like dissolving water - spouts . Nor was this one of those transient tempests that often agitate the summer . Time advanced , and its fierceness was little mitigated . Sometimes there was a lull , though the violence of the rain never appeared to diminish ; but then as in some pitched fight between contending hosts , when the fervour of the field seems for a moment to allay , fresh squadrons arrive and renew the hottest strife , so a low moaning wind that was now at intervals faintly heard , bore up a great reserve of electric vapour , that formed as it were into field , in the space between the Castle and Hellingsley , and then discharged its violence on that fated district . Coningsby and Oswald exchanged looks . "
152189	152194	152175	152175	You	5090	" said the first . "
152224	152241	152251	152251	Millbank	377	" The servant entered the room , and inquired whether the gentlemen were ready for dinner . "
152268	152685	152686	152686	I	0	" Coningsby in fact was exhausted by all the agitation of the day , and all the harassing spectres of the future . He found wine a momentary solace . He ordered the servants away , and for a moment felt a degree of wild satisfaction in the company of the brother of Edith . Thus they sate for a long time , talking only of one subject , and repeating almost the same things , yet both felt happier in being together . Oswald had risen , and opening the window , examined the approaching night . The storm had lulled , though the rain still fell ; in the west was a streak of light . In a quarter of an hour , he calculated on departing . As he was watching the wind , he thought he heard the sound of wheels , which reminded him of Coningsby 's promise to lend him a light carriage for his return . They sate down once more ; they had filled their glasses for the last time ; to pledge to their faithful friendship , and the happiness of Coningsby and Edith ; when the door of the room opened , and there appeared — Mr. Rigby . END OF BOOK VII . It was the heart of the London season , nearly four years ago ; twelve months having almost elapsed since the occurrence of those painful passages at Hellingsley which closed the last book of this history ; and long lines of carriages an hour before midnight , up the classic mount of St. James and along Piccadilly , intimated that the world were received at some grand entertainment in Arlington Street . It was the town mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at Beaumanoir we have more than once introduced the reader , to gain whose courtyard was at this moment the object of emulous coachmen , and to enter whose saloons was to reward the martyr - like patience of their lords and ladies . Among the fortunate , who had already succeeded in bowing to their hostess , were two gentlemen , who ensconced in a good position surveyed the scene , and made their observations on the passing guests . They were gentlemen , who , to judge from their general air , and the great consideration with which they were treated by those who were occasionally in their vicinity , were personages whose criticism bore authority .

154074	154316	154062	154062	I	0	" We must now briefly revert to what befell our hero after those unhappy occurrences in the midst of whose first woe we left him . The day after the arrival of Mr. Rigby at the Castle , Coningsby quitted it for London ; and before a week had elapsed had embarked for Cadiz . He felt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some blood , and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she spoke it . A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit Athens and the Ægean , which he much desired . In the pensive beauties of that delicate land , where perpetual autumn seems to reign , Coningsby found solace . There is something in the character of Grecian scenery which blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of the sorrowful . Coningsby passed his winter at Rome . The wish of his grandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England somewhat abruptly . Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country since his marriage ; but the period that had elapsed since that event had considerably improved the prospects of his party . The majority of the Whig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than nominal ; and though it was circulated among their friends , as if from the highest authority that , "
154321	154964	154062	154062	I	0	" there seemed daily a better chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit . For the first time in the history of this country since the introduction of the system of Parliamentary Sovereignty , the Government of England depended on the fate of single elections . And indeed by a single vote , it is remarkable to observe , the fate of the Whig government was ultimately decided . This critical state of affairs , duly reported to Lord Monmouth , revived his political passions , and offered him that excitement which he was ever seeking , and yet for which he often had to sigh . The Marquess too was weary of Paris . Every day he found it more difficult to be amused . Lucretia had lost her charm . He , from whom nothing could be concealed , perceived that often while she elaborately attempted to divert him , her mind was wandering elsewhere . Lord Monmouth was quite superior to all petty jealousy , and the vulgar feelings of inferior mortals ; but his sublime selfishness required devotion . He had calculated that a wife or a mistress who might be in love with another man , however powerfully their interests might prompt them , could not be so agreeable and amusing to their friends and husbands , as if they had no such distracting hold upon their hearts or their fancy . Latterly at Paris , while Lucretia became each day more involved in the vortex of society , where all admired , and some adored , her , Lord Monmouth fell into the easy habit of dining in his private rooms , sometimes tête - à - tête with Villebecque , whose inexhaustible tales and adventures about a kind of society which Lord Monmouth had always preferred infinitely to the polished and somewhat insipid circles in which he was born , had rendered him the prime favourite of his great patron . Sometimes Villebecque too brought a friend , male or otherwise , whom he thought invested with the rare faculty of distraction ; Lord Monmouth cared not who or what they were , provided they were diverting . Villebecque had written to Coningsby at Rome by his grandfather 's desire to beg him to return to England and meet Lord Monmouth there . The letter was couched with all the respect and good feeling which Villebecque really entertained for him whom he addressed ; still a letter on such a subject from such a person was not agreeable to Coningsby , and his reply to it was direct to his grandfather ; Lord Monmouth however had entirely given over writing letters . Coningsby had met at Paris , on his way to England , Lord and Lady Everingham ; and he had returned with them . This revival of an old acquaintance was both agreeable and fortunate for our hero . The vivacity of a clever and charming woman pleasantly disturbed the brooding memory of Coningsby . There is no mortification however keen , no misery however desperate , which the spirit of woman can not in some degree lighten or alleviate . About too to make his formal entrance into the great world , he could not have secured a more valuable and accomplished female friend . She gave him every instruction , every intimation that was necessary ; cleared the social difficulties which in some degree are experienced on their entrance into the world even by the most highly connected , unless they have this benign assistance ; planted him immediately in the position which was expedient ; took care that he was invited at once to the right houses ; and , with the aid of her husband , that he should become a member of the right clubs .

155228	155349	155202	155202	My	0	" Lord Fitz - booby looked rather perplexed ; but possessed of considerable official experience ; having held very high posts , some in the cabinet , for nearly a quarter of a century ; he was too versed to acknowledge that he had not understood a single word that had been addressed to him for the last ten minutes . He looked on with the same grave , attentive stolidity , occasionally nodding his head , as he was wo nt of yore , when he received a deputation on sugar duties or joint stock banks , and when he made , as was his custom when particularly perplexed , an occasional note on a sheet of foolscap paper .

155688	155695	155697	155700	Lord Fitz - booby	450	" I appeal to Lord Eskdale , "
155702	155736	155697	155700	Lord Fitz - booby	450	" there is Lady Everingham turned quite a Radical , I declare . Is not your Lordship of opinion that the country must be safer with a Conservative Government than with a Liberal ? "
155737	155747	155749	155750	Lord Eskdale	317	" I think the country is always tolerably secure , "
155779	155784	155786	155787	Lady Everingham	533	" Pray , Theresa , "
155789	155795	155786	155787	Lady Everingham	533	" where is Mr. Coningsby ? "
158469	158475	158477	158478	Lord Monmouth	328	" You see , Harry , "
158480	158511	158512	158512	He	328	" that I am much occupied to - day , yet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing that it could not be postponed . "
158525	158536	158538	158539	Lord Monmouth	328	" I was right in pressing your return to England , "
158561	158858	158538	158539	Lord Monmouth	328	" These are not times when young men should be out of sight . Your public career will commence immediately . The Government have resolved on a dissolution . My information is from the highest quarter . You may be astonished , but it is a fact . They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons . Notwithstanding this and the Queen 's name , we can beat them ; but the race requires the finest jockeying . We ca n't give a point . Tadpole has been here to me about Darlford ; he came specially with a message , I may say an appeal , from one to whom I can refuse nothing ; the Government count on the seat , though with the new Registration ' tis nearly a tie . If we had a good candidate we could win . But Rigby wo n't do . He is too much of the old clique ; used up ; a hack ; besides a beaten horse . We are assured the name of Coningsby would be a host ; there is a considerable section who support the present fellow , who will not vote against a Coningsby . They have thought of you as the fit person , and I have approved of the suggestion . You will therefore be the candidate for Darlford with my entire sanction and support , and I have no doubt you will be successful . You may be sure I shall spare nothing : and it will be very gratifying to me , after being robbed of all our boroughs , that the only Coningsby who cares to enter Parliament , should nevertheless be able to do so as early as I could fairly desire . "

159148	159159	159161	159161	Coningsby	329	" Do you anticipate then an immediate Dissolution , sir ? "
159168	159297	159161	159161	Coningsby	329	" We must anticipate it ; though I think it doubtful . It may be next month ; it may be in the autumn ; they may tide over another year as Lord Eskdale thinks , and his opinion always weighs with me . He is very safe . Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once . But whether they dissolve now , or in a month 's time , or in the autumn , or next year , our course is clear . We must declare our intentions immediately . We must hoist our flag . Monday next , there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford . You must attend it ; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you to announce yourself . "
159298	159306	159308	159308	Coningsby	329	" Do n't you think , sir , "
159310	159337	159308	159308	Coningsby	329	" that such an announcement would be rather premature ? It is in fact embarking in a contest which may last a year ; perhaps more . "
159338	159346	159348	159349	Lord Monmouth	328	" What you say is very true , "
159351	159406	159348	159349	Lord Monmouth	328	" no doubt it is very troublesome ; very disgusting ; any canvassing is . But we must take things as we find them . You can not get into Parliament now in the good old gentlemanly way ; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has been fostered for our purpose . "
159430	159445	159447	159448	Lord Monmouth	328	" I think you had better be off the day after to - morrow , "
159450	159479	159447	159448	Lord Monmouth	328	" I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in so short a time , for I wish you to entertain the principal people . "
159480	159497	159499	159499	Coningsby	329	" You are most kind , you are always most kind to me , dear sir , "
159513	159527	159499	159499	Coningsby	329	" but , in truth , I have no wish to enter Parliament . "
159528	159531	159533	159534	Lord Monmouth	328	" What ? "
159536	159560	159562	159562	Coningsby	329	" I feel that I am not yet sufficiently prepared for so great a responsibility as a seat in the House of Commons , "
159564	159567	159569	159570	Lord Monmouth	328	" Responsibility ! "
159573	159718	159569	159570	Lord Monmouth	328	" What responsibility is there ! How can any one have a more agreeable seat ! The only person to whom you are responsible is your own relation , who brings you in . And I do n't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us . You are certainly still young ; but I was younger by nearly two years when I first went in ; and I found no difficulty . There can be no difficulty . All you have got to do is to vote with your party . As for speaking , if you have a talent that way ; take my advice ; do n't be in a hurry . Learn to know the house ; learn the house to know you . If a man be discreet , he can not enter Parliament too soon . "
159719	159728	159730	159730	Coningsby	329	" It is not exactly that , sir , "
159732	159779	159730	159730	Coningsby	329	" Then what is it , my dear Harry ? You see to - day I have much to do ; yet as your business is pressing , I would not postpone seeing you an hour . I thought you would have been very much gratified . "
159780	159798	159800	159800	Coningsby	329	" You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party , sir , "
159802	159818	159800	159800	Coningsby	329	" You mean of course by that term what is understood by the Conservative Party ? "
159819	159826	159730	159730	Coningsby	329	" Of course ; our friends . "
159827	159832	159834	159834	Coningsby	329	" I am sorry , "
159844	159857	159834	159834	Coningsby	329	" I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party . "
159858	159861	159863	159864	Lord Monmouth	328	" By — "
159871	159886	159863	159864	Lord Monmouth	328	" some woman has got hold of him , and made him a Whig . "
159887	159894	159896	159896	Coningsby	329	" No , my dear grandfather , "
159912	159931	159896	159896	Coningsby	329	" nothing of the kind , I assure you . No person can be more Anti - Whig . "
159932	159945	159947	159948	Lord Monmouth	328	" I do n't know what you are driving at , sir , "
159957	159966	159968	159968	Coningsby	329	" I wish to be frank , sir , "
159970	160049	159968	159968	Coningsby	329	" and am very sensible of your goodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject . What I mean to say is , that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party as a body who have betrayed their trust ; more from ignorance I admit than from design ; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal to the exigencies of the epoch ; and indeed unconscious of its real character . "
160050	160059	160061	160062	Lord Monmouth	328	" You mean giving up those Irish corporations ? "
160064	160207	160061	160062	Lord Monmouth	328	" Well , between ourselves , I am quite of the same opinion . But we must mount higher ; we must go to—28 for the real mischief . But what is the use of lamenting the past ? Peel is the only man ; suited to the times and all that,—at least we must say so , and try to believe so ; we ca n't go back . And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of the hands of our own order . It was never thought of in the time of your great - grandfather , sir . And if a Commoner were for a season permitted to be the nominal Premier to do the detail , there was always a secret Committee of great 1688 Nobles to give him his instructions . "
160208	160224	160226	160226	Coningsby	329	" I should be very sorry to see secret Committees of great 1688 Nobles again , "
160228	160239	160241	160242	Lord Monmouth	328	" Then what the devil do you want to see ? "
160244	160248	160250	160250	Coningsby	329	" Political Faith , "
160252	160258	160250	160250	Coningsby	329	" instead of Political Infidelity . "
160259	160262	160264	160265	Lord Monmouth	328	" Hem ! "
160267	160274	160276	160276	Coningsby	329	" Before I support Conservative principles , "
160278	160481	160276	160276	Coningsby	329	" I merely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve . It would not appear to be the Prerogative of the Crown , since the principal portion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late royal act which they describe as a Bed - chamber plot . Is it the Church which they wish to conserve ? What is a threatened Appropriation Clause against an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary Laymen ? Could the Long Parliament have done worse ? Well then , if it 's neither the Crown nor the Church whose rights and privileges this Conservative party propose to vindicate , is it your House , the House of Lords , whose powers they are prepared to uphold ? Is it not notorious that the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House , declares among his Conservative adherents , that henceforth the very Assembly that used to furnish those Committees of great Revolution Nobles that you mention , is to initiate nothing ; and without a struggle is to subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial tranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute . "
160482	160489	160491	160492	Lord Monmouth	328	" All this is vastly fine , "
160494	160623	160491	160492	Lord Monmouth	328	" but I see no means by which I can attain my object but by supporting Peel . After all , what is the end of all parties and all politics ? To gain your object . I want to turn our coronet into a Ducal one , and to get your grandmother 's barony called out of abeyance in your favour . It is impossible that Peel can refuse me . I have already purchased an ample estate with the view of entailing it on you and your issue . You will make a conderable alliance ; you may marry if you please Lady Theresa Sydney . I hear the report with pleasure . Count on my at once entering into any arrangement conducive to your happiness . "
160624	160641	160276	160276	Coningsby	329	" My dear grandfather , you have ever been to me only too kind and generous . "
160642	160845	160491	160492	Lord Monmouth	328	" To whom should I be kind but to you ; my own blood that has never crossed me , and of whom I have reason to be proud . Yes , Harry , it gratifies me to hear you admired and learn your success . All I want now is to see you in Parliament . A man should be in Parliament early . There is a sort of stiffness about every man , no matter what may be his talents , who enters Parliament late in life ; and now fortunately the occasion offers . You will go down on Friday ; feed the notabilities well ; speak out ; praise Peel ; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the Bed - chamber ; anathematise all waverers ; say a good deal about Ireland ; stick to the Irish Registration Bill , that 's a good card ; and above all , my dear Harry , do n't spare that fellow Millbank . Remember in turning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative Cause and our coronet , but you crush my foe . Spare nothing for that object ; I count on you , boy . "
160846	160865	160867	160867	Coningsby	329	" I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your interest or your honour , sir , "
160875	160888	160890	160891	Lord Monmouth	328	" I am sure you would , I am sure you would , "
160900	160908	160910	160910	Coningsby	329	" And I feel at this moment , "
160912	160994	160910	160910	Coningsby	329	" that there is no personal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them , except one . My interests , my affections , they should not be placed in the balance , if yours , sir , were at stake , though there are circumstances which might involve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well endure ; but I claim for my convictions , my dear grandfather , a generous tolerance . "
160995	161004	161006	161007	Lord Monmouth	328	" I ca n't follow you , sir , "
161014	161073	161010	161010	his	328	" Our interests are inseparable , and therefore there can never be any sacrifice of conduct on your part . What you mean by sacrifice of affections I do n't comprehend ; but as for your opinions , you have no business to have any other than those I uphold . You are too young to form opinions . "
161074	161088	161090	161090	Coningsby	329	" I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence ; "
161092	161168	161090	161090	Coningsby	329	" I have never intruded them on your ear before ; but this being an occasion , when you yourself said , sir , I was about to commence my public career , I confess I thought it was my duty to be frank ; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one of those ill - considered entrances into political life which so many public men have cause to deplore . "
161169	161197	161010	161010	his	328	" You go with your family , sir , like a gentleman ; you are not to consider your opinions like a philosopher or a political adventurer . "
161198	161203	161205	161205	Coningsby	329	" Yes , sir , "
161209	161243	161205	161205	Coningsby	329	" but men going with their families , like gentlemen , and losing sight of every principle on which the society of this country ought to be established , produced the Reform Bill . "
161244	161251	161253	161254	Lord Monmouth	328	" D — the Reform Bill ; "
161256	161288	161253	161254	Lord Monmouth	328	" if the Duke had not quarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee , we should never have had the Reform Bill . And Grey would have gone to Ireland . "
161289	161303	161305	161305	Coningsby	329	" You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830 , "
161307	161314	161316	161317	Lord Monmouth	328	" No , no , no ; "
161319	161343	161316	161317	Lord Monmouth	328	" the Tory party is organized now ; they will not catch us napping again ; these Conservative Associations have done the business . "
161344	161352	161354	161354	Coningsby	329	" But what are they organized for ? "
161356	161588	161354	161354	Coningsby	329	" At the best to turn out the Whigs . And when you have turned out the Whigs , what then ? You may get your Ducal Coronet , sir . But a Duke now is not as great a man as a Baron was but a century back . We can not struggle against the irresistible stream of circumstances . Power has left our order ; this is not an age for factitious aristocracy . As for my grandmother 's barony , I should look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour , as the act of my political extinction . What we want , sir , is not to fashion new Dukes and furbish up old Baronies ; but to establish great principles which may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the People . Let me see Authority once more honoured ; a solemn Reverence again the habit of our lives ; let me see Property acknowledging as in the old days of faith , that Labour is his twin brother , and that the essence of all tenure is the performance of duty ; let results such as these be brought about , and let me participate , however feebly , in the great fulfilment ; and public life then indeed becomes a noble career , and a seat in Parliament an enviable distinction . "
161589	161599	161601	161602	Lord Monmouth	328	" I tell you what it is , Harry , "
161607	161747	161749	161750	Lord Monmouth	328	" members of this family may think as they like , but they must act as I please . You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate for the town , or I shall re - consider our mutual positions . I would say , you must go to - morrow ; but it is but courteous to Rigby to give him a previous intimation of your movement . And that can not be done to - day . I sent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me ; and find he is out of town . He will return to - morrow ; and will be here at three o'clock , when you can meet him . You will meet him I doubt not like a man of sense , "
161766	161787	161749	161750	Lord Monmouth	328	" who is not prepared to sacrifice all the objects of life , for the pursuit of some fantastical puerilities . "
162076	162087	162027	162027	his	328	" Cross my purpose , and I will crush you . "
162245	162263	162241	162242	Mr. Cassilis	790	" So Beau they say is booked at last ; the new beauty , have you heard ? "
162264	162275	162277	162278	his companion	1182	" I saw him very sweet on her last night , "
162280	162286	162241	162242	Mr. Cassilis	790	" Has she any tin ? "
162287	162293	162295	162296	Mr. Cassilis	790	" Deuced deal they say , "
162298	162322	162295	162296	Mr. Cassilis	790	" The father 's a Cotton Lord , and they all have loads of tin , you know . Nothing like them now . "
162323	162333	162241	162242	Mr. Cassilis	790	" He is in Parliament , is not he ? "
162334	162342	162344	162345	Mr. Cassilis	790	" ' Gad I believe he is , "
162347	162390	162344	162345	Mr. Cassilis	790	" I never know who is in Parliament in these days . I remember when there were only ten men in the House of Commons who were not either members of Brookes ' or this place . Everything is so deuced changed . "
162391	162402	162404	162405	another gentleman	4478	" I hear ' tis an old affair of Beau , "
162407	162420	162404	162405	another gentleman	4478	" It was all done a year ago at Rome or Paris . "
162421	162429	162431	162432	Mr. Cassilis	790	" They say she refused him then , "
162434	162447	162431	162432	Mr. Cassilis	790	" Well , that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer 's daughter , "
162452	162456	162431	162432	Mr. Cassilis	790	" what next ? "
162457	162466	162468	162469	Mr. Cassilis	790	" I wonder how the Duke likes it , "
162471	162476	162468	162469	Mr. Cassilis	790	" Or the Duchess ? "
162483	162488	162490	162491	the other	6439	" Or the Everinghams ? "
162493	162509	162511	162512	Mr. Cassilis	790	" The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled , I take it , "
162514	162523	162511	162512	Mr. Cassilis	790	" A good deal depends on the tin , "
163582	163591	163593	163593	Lucretia	329	" ' Tis a new book of Sue , "
163595	163602	163593	163593	Lucretia	329	" they say it is good . "
163668	163673	163674	163674	she	612	" Oh ! madam , "
163679	163693	163674	163674	she	612	" if you would but speak to Mr. Coningsby all might be right ! "
163694	163699	163701	163702	Lady Monmouth	740	" What is this ? "
163728	163743	163716	163716	she	740	" tell me , Flora , what is it ; what is the matter ? "
163744	163748	163750	163750	Flora	612	" My Lord , "
163752	163759	163750	163750	Flora	612	" has quarrelled with Mr. Coningsby . "
163772	163778	163770	163770	Lucretia	329	" Why have they quarrelled ? "
163779	163806	163716	163716	she	740	" I do not know they have quarrelled ; it is not perhaps a right term ; but my Lord is very angry with Mr. Coningsby . "
163807	163821	163716	163716	she	740	" Not very angry I should think , Flora ; and about what ? "
163822	163830	163832	163832	Flora	612	" Oh ! very angry , madam , "
163839	163856	163832	163832	Flora	612	" my Lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr. Coningsby would never enter the house again . "
163857	163864	163866	163866	Lucretia	329	" Was it to - day ! "
163868	163935	163866	163866	Lucretia	329	" This morning ; Mr. Coningsby has only left this hour or two . He will not do what my Lord wishes — about some seat in the Chamber . I do not know exactly what it is ; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror ; my father is frightened even to go into his room , when he is so . "
163936	163946	163948	163948	Lucretia	329	" Has Mr. Rigby been here to - day ? "
163950	163989	163990	163991	Lady Monmouth	740	" Mr. Rigby is not in town . My father went for Mr. Rigby this morning before Mr. Coningsby came , and he found that Mr. Rigby was not in town . That is why I know it . "
164015	164051	164012	164012	she	740	" Go away now ; the book is stupid ; it does not amuse me . Stop : find out all you can for me about the quarrel , before I speak to Mr. Coningsby . "
164312	164317	164297	164297	He	317	" very slashing article , "
164594	164600	164591	164591	he	317	" la guerre aux châteaux , "
164834	164845	164847	164848	Lady Monmouth	740	" I told you to beware of him long ago , "
164850	164867	164847	164848	Lady Monmouth	740	" He is , he has ever been , in the way of both of us . "
164868	164875	164877	164877	Rigby	317	" He is in my power , "
164879	164885	164877	164877	Rigby	317	" we can crush him . "
164886	164889	164847	164848	Lady Monmouth	740	" How ? "
164890	164907	164847	164848	Lady Monmouth	740	" He is in love with the daughter of Millbank , the man who bought Hellingsley . "
164908	164911	164913	164914	Lady Monmouth	740	" Hah ! "
164920	164962	164913	164914	Lady Monmouth	740	" He was at Coningsby all last summer hanging about her . I found the younger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle ; a fact of itself which , if known to Lord Monmouth , would ensure the lad 's annihilation . "
164963	164980	164982	164983	Lady Monmouth	740	" And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign , my good Mr. Rigby , "
164989	165003	164982	164983	Lady Monmouth	740	" It was a weapon of service ; I give you my compliments . "
165004	165012	165014	165015	Mr. Rigby	317	" The time is not always ripe , "
165017	165165	165014	165015	Mr. Rigby	317	" But it is now most mature ; let us not conceal it from ourselves , that since his first visit to Coningsby , we have neither of us really been in the same position which we then occupied , or believed we should occupy . My Lord , though you would scarcely believe it , has a weakness for this boy ; and though I by my marriage , and you by your zealous ability , have apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits , I have never doubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit is plucked by one who has not watched the garden . You take me ? There is no reason why we two should clash together ; we can both of us find what we want ; and more securely if we work in company . "
165166	165181	164913	164914	Lady Monmouth	740	" I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted , dear Madam . "
165182	165236	165014	165015	Mr. Rigby	317	" Nor to yourself , dear Mr. Rigby . Go now ; the game is before you . Rid me of this Coningsby , and I will secure you all that you want . Doubt not me . There is no reason . I want a firm ally . There must be two . "
165237	165243	165245	165245	Rigby	317	" It shall be done , "
165247	165294	165245	165245	Rigby	317	" it must be done . If once the notion gets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for Darlford , all the present combinations will be disorganized . It must be done at once ; I know that the government will dissolve . "
165295	165302	165304	165304	Lucretia	329	" So I hear for certain , "
165306	165326	165304	165304	Lucretia	329	" Be sure there is no time to lose . What does he want with you to - day ? "
165327	165338	165014	165015	Mr. Rigby	317	" I know not ; there are so many things . "
165339	165499	165304	165304	Lucretia	329	" To be sure : and yet I can not doubt he will speak of this quarrel . Let not the occasion be lost . Whatever his mood , the subject may be introduced . If good , you will guide him more easily ; if dark , the love for the Hellingsley girl , the fact of the brother being in his Castle , drinking his wine , riding his horses , ordering about his servants , you will omit no details — a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash him to madness ! ' Tis quite ripe . Not a word that you have seen me . Go , go , or he may hear that you have arrived . I shall be at home all the morning . It will be but gallant , that you should pay me a little visit when you have transacted your business . You understand — au revoir ! "
166337	166344	166346	166347	Lady Monmouth	740	" How long you have been , "
166349	166360	166346	166347	Lady Monmouth	740	" Now sit down and tell me what has past . "
166372	166378	166380	166381	Mr. Rigby	317	" I thank your Ladyship , "
166404	166412	166395	166395	himself	317	" but I am very well here . "
166462	166465	166467	166468	Lady Monmouth	740	" Well , "
166470	166478	166467	166468	Lady Monmouth	740	" Does he know about the Millbanks ? "
166479	166482	166484	166485	Mr. Rigby	317	" Everything , "
166487	166494	166484	166485	Mr. Rigby	317	" And what did he say ? "
166495	166502	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" His Lordship was greatly shocked , "
166513	166546	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" Such monstrous ingratitude ! As his Lordship very justly observed , it is impossible to say what is going on under my own roof , or to whom I can trust . "
166547	166566	166568	166569	Lady Monmouth	740	" But he made an exception in your favour , I dare say , my dear Mr. Rigby , "
166571	166585	166587	166588	Mr. Rigby	317	" Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire confidence , "
166590	166601	166587	166588	Mr. Rigby	317	" and that he looked to me in his difficulties . "
166602	166617	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" Very sensible of him . And what is to become of Mr. Coningsby ? "
166618	166635	166637	166638	Mr. Rigby	317	" The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to his establishment generally , "
166640	166681	166637	166638	Mr. Rigby	317	" will allow the connection that at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative , now that Lord Monmouth 's eyes are open to his real character , to terminate naturally without the necessity of any formal explanation . "
166682	166701	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his establishment generally ? "
166702	166712	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene . "
166713	166725	166727	166728	Lady Monmouth	740	" Oh ! is he going to drag me abroad again , "
166733	166738	166740	166741	Mr. Rigby	317	" Why not exactly , "
166745	166760	166740	166741	Mr. Rigby	317	" I hope he is not going again to that dreadful Castle in Lancashire . "
166761	166784	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" Lord Monmouth was thinking that as you were tired of Paris , you might find some of the German Baths agreeable . "
166785	166802	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" Why there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German bathing place ! "
166803	166806	166808	166809	Mr. Rigby	317	" Exactly , "
166811	166824	166808	166809	Mr. Rigby	317	" Then how capricious in him , wanting to go to them ! "
166825	166835	166504	166505	Mr. Rigby	317	" He does not want to go to them . "
166836	166845	166847	166848	Lady Monmouth	740	" What do you mean , Mr. Rigby , "
166900	166981	166988	166989	Lady Monmouth	740	" I mean what Lord Monmouth means ; he suggests that if your Ladyship were to pass the summer at Kissingen for example , and a paragraph in the Morning Post were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you there , all awkwardness would be removed ; and no one could for a moment take the liberty of supposing , even if his Lordship did not ultimately reach you , that anything like a separation had occurred . "
166982	166986	166988	166989	Lady Monmouth	740	" A separation ! "
166991	166995	166997	166998	Mr. Rigby	317	" Quite amicable , "
167000	167020	166997	166998	Mr. Rigby	317	" I would never have consented to interfere in the affair , but to secure that most desirable point . "
167021	167030	167032	167032	Lucretia	329	" I will see Lord Monmouth at once , "
167046	167053	167055	167056	Mr. Rigby	317	" His Lordship has gone out , "
167060	167074	167075	167075	She	329	" Our conversation , sir , then finishes : I wait his return . "
167079	167090	167091	167091	Lucretia	329	" His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again . "
167097	167101	167102	167102	she	329	" Miserable craven ! "
167105	167146	167102	167102	she	329	" has the cowardly tyrant fled ? And he really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this ! Pah ! He may leave Monmouth House , but I shall not . Begone , sir . "
167147	167156	167158	167159	Mr. Rigby	317	" Still anxious to secure an amicable separation , "
167161	167288	167290	167291	Mr. Rigby	317	" your Ladyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly before your excellent judgment . Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course ; you know as well as me that he never swerves from his resolutions . He has left peremptory instructions , and he will listen to no appeal . He has empowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way to consider your convenience . He suggests that everything in short should be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more ; that your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure , which shall be made payable quarterly to your order , provided you can find it convenient to live upon the continent , "
167296	167303	167290	167291	Mr. Rigby	317	" And suppose I can not ? "
167304	167319	167397	167398	Lady Monmouth	740	" Why then we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your rights . "
167320	167323	167290	167291	Mr. Rigby	317	" We ! "
167324	167358	167360	167361	Mr. Rigby	317	" I beg your Ladyship 's pardon : I speak as the friend of the family ; the trustee of your marriage settlement ; well - known also as Lord Monmouth 's executor , "
167390	167395	167397	167398	Lady Monmouth	740	" I have decided , "
167400	167428	167397	167398	Lady Monmouth	740	" I will assert my rights . Your master has mistaken my character and his own position . He shall rue the day that he assailed me . "
167429	167440	167442	167443	Mr. Rigby	317	" I should be sorry if there were any violence , "
167445	167520	167442	167443	Mr. Rigby	317	" especially as everything is left to my management and control . An office indeed which I only accepted for your mutual advantage . I think upon reflection I might put before your Ladyship some considerations which might induce you on the whole to be of opinion that it will be better for us to draw together in this business , as we have hitherto indeed throughout an acquaintance , now of some years . "
167532	167546	167548	167548	Lucretia	329	" Your self - confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth 's estimate of it , "
167550	167624	167548	167548	Lucretia	329	" Now , now , you are unkind . Your Ladyship mistakes my position . I am interfering in this business for your sake . I might have refused the office . It would have fallen to another , who would have fulfilled it without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings . View my interposition in that light , my dear Lady Monmouth , and circumstances will assume altogether a new colour . "
167625	167637	167638	167639	Mr. Rigby	317	" I beg that you would quit the house , sir . "
167644	167822	167641	167641	his	317	" I would with pleasure to oblige you , were it in my power , but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should take up my residence here permanently . The servants are now my servants . It is useless to ring the bell . For your Ladyship 's sake , I wish everything to be accomplished with tranquillity , and if possible friendliness and good - feeling . You can have even a week for the preparations for your departure if necessary . I will take that upon myself . Any carriages too that you desire ; your jewels ; at least all those that are not at the banker 's . The arrangement about your jointure , your letters of credit , even your passport , I will attend to myself ; only too happy if by this painful interference , I have in any way contributed to soften the annoyance which at the first blush you may naturally experience , but which like everything else , take my word , will wear off . "
167823	167831	167833	167834	Lady Monmouth	740	" I shall send for Lord Eskdale , "
167836	167842	167833	167834	Lady Monmouth	740	" he is a gentleman . "
167843	167849	167851	167852	Mr. Rigby	317	" I am quite sure , "
167854	167876	167877	167877	he	317	" that Lord Eskdale will give you the same advice as myself , if he only reads your Ladyship 's letters , "
167881	167886	167877	167877	he	317	" to Prince Trautsmandorff . "
167887	167891	167893	167894	Lady Monmouth	740	" My letters ! "
167896	167900	167902	167902	Rigby	317	" Pardon me , "
167917	167984	167902	167902	Rigby	317	" I have no wish to revive painful associations ; but I have them ; and I must act upon them , if you persist in treating me as a foe , who am in reality your best friend , which indeed I ought to be , having the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement , and having known you so many years . "
167985	167993	167995	167996	Lady Monmouth	740	" Leave me for the present alone , "
167998	168063	167995	167996	Lady Monmouth	740	" Send me my servant if I have one . I shall not remain here the week which you mention , but quit at once this house , which I wish I had never entered . Adieu ! Mr. Rigby , you are now Lord of Monmouth House , and yet I can not help feeling you too will be discharged before he dies . "
168763	168770	168772	168772	Coningsby	329	" Embrace Lord Monmouth for me , "
168778	168798	168772	168772	Coningsby	329	" and tell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with you . "
169075	169079	169080	169080	He	328	" the World . "
169307	169317	169323	169323	his	328	" Why did not you ask him to dinner ! "
169417	169430	169414	169414	he	328	" Well , he shall come to dine with you next time . "
169932	169940	169941	169941	she	329	" but Percy is often in love , "
169945	169977	169978	169978	she	329	" and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas . He thinks it destroys the romance ; and that domestic familiarity may compromise his heroic character . However , "
169981	169991	169978	169978	she	329	" I really believe that will be a match . "
170370	170376	170381	170381	she	533	" My fête was prophetic , "
170385	170402	170381	170381	she	533	" I am glad it is connected with an incident . It gives it a point . "
170403	170420	170381	170381	she	533	" You are mystical as well as prophetic . Tell me what are we to celebrate . "
170421	170429	170381	170381	she	533	" Theresa is going to be married . "
170430	170447	170381	170381	she	533	" Then I too will prophecy and name the hero of the romance — Eustace Lyle . "
170448	170457	170459	170460	Lady Everingham	533	" You have been more prescient than me , "
170462	170475	170459	170460	Lady Everingham	533	" perhaps because I was thinking too much of some one else . "
170476	170527	170381	170381	she	533	" It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect . I hardly know which I love best . I have had my suspicions a long time ; and when Eustace refused to go to the moors with us , though I said nothing , I was convinced . "
170528	170533	170535	170536	Lady Everingham	533	" At any rate , "
170544	170562	170535	170536	Lady Everingham	533	" we are kinsfolk Mr. Coningsby ; though I would gladly have wished to have been more . "
170563	170581	170582	170582	he	5488	" Were those your thoughts , dear Lady ? Ever kind to me ! But such happiness , "
170589	170597	170582	170582	he	5488	" I fear can never be mine . "
170598	170602	170535	170536	Lady Everingham	533	" And why ? "
170603	170628	170582	170582	he	5488	" Ah ! ' tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when like Seged we must all determine to be happy . "
170629	170637	170582	170582	he	5488	" You have already made me miserable . "
170638	170649	170651	170651	Coningsby	329	" Here comes a group that will make you gay , "
170806	170811	170813	170814	Lord Eskdale	317	" Strawberries and cream ? "
170825	170853	170813	170814	Lord Eskdale	317	" Egad ! no , no , no ; those days are passed . I think there is a little easterly wind with all this fine appearance . "
170854	170864	170866	170867	Lord Eskdale	317	" I am for in - door nature myself , "
170869	170905	170866	170867	Lord Eskdale	317	" Do you know I do n't half like the way Monmouth is going on . He never gets out of that villa of his . He should change his air more . Tell him . "
170906	170922	170813	170814	Lord Eskdale	317	" It 's no use telling him anything . Have you heard anything of Miladi ? "
170923	170959	170969	170970	Mr. Ormsby	353	" I had a letter from her to - day ; she writes in very good spirits . I am sorry it broke up , and yet I never thought it would last as long . "
170960	170967	170969	170970	Mr. Ormsby	353	" I gave them two years , "
170972	171098	170969	170970	Mr. Ormsby	353	" Lord Monmouth lived with his first wife two years . And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan , at least nearly two years , it was a year and ten months . I must know , for he called me in to settle affairs . I took the lady to the Baths of Lucca on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there . He went to Paris . All his great affairs have been two years . I remember I wanted to bet Cassilis at White 's on it when he married , but I thought being his intimate friend , the oldest friend he has indeed , and one of his trustees , it was perhaps as well not to do it . "
171099	171109	171111	171112	Lord Eskdale	317	" You should have made the bet with himself , "
171114	171125	171111	171112	Lord Eskdale	317	" and then there never would have been a separation . "
171126	171141	170969	170970	Mr. Ormsby	353	" Hah , hah , hah ! Do you know I feel the wind . "
171242	171255	171257	171258	Lady Wallinger	746	" The match that has been proclaimed today has greatly surprised me , "
171260	171263	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" Indeed ! "
171267	171295	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" I confess I was long prepared for it . And it seems to me the most natural alliance conceivable and one that every one must approve . "
171296	171306	171223	171225	Mrs. Guy Flouncey	616	" Lady Everingham seems very much surprised at it . "
171307	171327	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" Ah ! Lady Everingham is a very brilliant personage , and can not deign to observe obvious circumstances . "
171328	171347	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" Do you know , Mr. Coningsby , that I always thought you were engaged to Lady Theresa ? "
171348	171351	171223	171225	Mrs. Guy Flouncey	616	" I ! "
171352	171374	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" Indeed we were informed more than a month ago , that you were positively going to be married to her . "
171375	171394	171395	171396	Lady Wallinger	746	" I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such rapidity , Lady Wallinger . "
171400	171416	171395	171396	Lady Wallinger	746	" You remember our meeting you on the stairs at — House , Mr. Coningsby . "
171417	171428	171223	171225	Mrs. Guy Flouncey	616	" Painfully . It is deeply graven on my brain . "
171429	171446	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady Theresa . "
171447	171462	171464	171464	Coningsby	329	" Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married , "
171467	171555	171464	171464	Coningsby	329	" I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one . Lord Beaumanoir admires her ; has always admired her . But Edith has given him no encouragement , at least gave him no encouragement as long as she believed — but why dwell on such an unhappy subject , Mr. Coningsby . I am to blame , I have been to blame perhaps before , but indeed I think it cruel , very cruel that Edith and you are kept asunder . "
171556	171595	171265	171265	Coningsby	329	" You have always been my best , my dearest friend ; and are the most amiable and admirable of women . But tell me , is it indeed true that Edith is not going to be married ? "
171713	171719	171721	171722	Lady Wallinger	746	" There is Sir Joseph , "
172070	172074	172075	172075	she	580	" Forgive me ! "
172078	172088	172090	172090	Coningsby	329	" Ah ! how could you ever doubt me ! "
172092	172097	172090	172090	Coningsby	329	" I was unhappy . "
172098	172109	172075	172075	she	580	" And now we are to each other as before ? "
172110	172120	172090	172090	Coningsby	329	" And will be ; come what come may . "
172491	172498	172447	172448	Lord Henry	337	" a knife and fork question , "
172698	172708	172710	172711	Lord Henry	337	" I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule , "
172713	172724	172710	172711	Lord Henry	337	" I will be content with being his Gentleman Usher . "
172733	172738	172710	172711	Lord Henry	337	" said Lord Vere . "
172747	172751	172739	172740	No one	1022	" said Coningsby . "
172757	172762	172754	172755	Sir Charles	362	" said Lady Everingham , "
172777	172778	172774	172774	your	362	" "
172788	172792	172793	172793	I	0	" said Buckhurst . "
172923	173967	173968	173968	You	5580	" He ceased his instructions and all hurried away to carry them into effect . Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses , the ladies in robes of white with garlands of flowers , some drew pieces of armour from the wall , and decked themselves with helm and hauberk , others waved ancient banners . They brought in the Boar 's head on a large silver dish , and Coningsby raised it aloft . They formed into procession , the Duchess distributing rosemary , Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of Tamerlane , his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility , and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chaunting the first verse of the Canticle , followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa . I. II . The procession thrice paraded the Hall . Then they stopped , and the Lord of Misrule ascended his throne and his courtiers formed round him in circle . Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their glittering arms ; and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the Boar 's head covered with garlands . It was a good picture and the Lord of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy . He was addressing his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense , when a servant approached Coningsby and told him that he was wanted without . Our hero retired unperceived . A despatch had arrived for him from London . Without any prescience of its purpose , he nevertheless broke the seal with a trembling hand . His presence was immediately desired in town — Lord Monmouth was dead . This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby ; yet , like many critical epochs , the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware of its character . The first feeling which he experienced at the intelligence was sincere affliction . He was fond of his grandfather ; had received great kindness from him , and at a period of life when it was most welcome . The neglect and hardships of his early years , instead of leaving a prejudice against one who by some might be esteemed their author , had only rendered by their contrast Coningsby more keenly sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his happy youth . The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes . Lord Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for him as became a near relative to whom he was attached ; and in a manner which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman . The allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him , as considerable as usually accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers , might justify him in estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample . He was aware indeed that at a subsequent period , his grandfather had projected for him fortunes of a still more elevated character . He looked to Coningsby as the future representative of an ancient Barony , and had been purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title . But Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being realized . He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford , he had at the moment arrested arrangements which , from the tone of Lord Monmouth 's communication , he believed were then in progress for that purpose ; and he thought it improbable , with his knowledge of his grandfather 's habits , that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to resume before his decease the completion of these plans . Indeed there was a period when in adopting the course which he pursued with respect to Darlford , Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the large fortune which was to accompany the Barony . Had not a separation between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with Coningsby 's difference with his grandfather , he was conscious that the consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects ; but the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture , its permanent removal indeed from the scene , coupled with his fortunate though not formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth , had long ago banished from his memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the time to shut his eyes . Before he left town for Scotland , he had made a farewell visit to his grandfather , who , though not as cordial as in old days , had been gracious ; and Coningsby , during his excursion to the moors , and his various visits to the country , had continued at intervals to write to his grandfather , as had been for some years his custom . On the whole , with an indefinite feeling which , in spite of many a rational effort , did nevertheless haunt his mind , that this great and sudden event might exercise a very vast and beneficial influence on his worldly position , Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the affliction which he sincerely experienced , in the hope that he might at all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms , her virtues , and her love . Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham , Coningsby was never long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life ; and the correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney , while they were at the moors , had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir 's suit had terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had quitted London . It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town : he called at once on Lord Eskdale , who was one of Lord Monmouth 's executors ; and he persuaded Coningsby , whom he saw depressed , to dine with him alone . "
173977	173985	173968	173968	You	5580	" said the good - natured peer ; "
174002	174035	174036	174036	I	0	" Lord Eskdale at dinner talked very frankly of the disposition of Lord Monmouth 's property . He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was his grandfather 's principal heir . "
174050	174055	174036	174036	I	0	" said Lord Eskdale . "
174195	175227	174185	174185	they	5585	" Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa , which latterly he never quitted , at a little supper ; with no persons near him but those who were very amusing . He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his lips , and being extremely polite waited a few minutes before he asked Clotilde , who was singing a very sparkling drinking song , to do him that service . When in accordance with his request she reached him , it was too late . The ladies shrieked , being very frightened : at first they were in despair , but after reflection , they evinced some intention of plundering the house . Villebecque who was absent at the moment arrived in time ; and every body became orderly and broken - hearted . The body had been removed to Monmouth House , where it had been embalmed and laid in state . The funeral was not numerously attended . There was nobody in town ; some distinguished connexions however came up from the country , though it was a period inconvenient for such movements . After the funeral , the will was to be read in the principal saloon of Monmouth House , one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof , and now hung in black adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer . The testamentary dispositions of the late Lord were still unknown , though the names of his executors had been announced by his family solicitor , in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained . The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale , Mr. Ormsby , and Mr. Rigby . By a subsequent appointment , Sidonia was added . All these individuals were now present . Coningsby , who had been chief mourner , stood on the right hand of the solicitor , who sat at the end of a long table , round which in groups were ranged all who had attended the funeral , including several of the superior members of the household ; among them M. Villebecque . The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will , the original will however changed or modified had never been revoked ; it was therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument . So saying he sate down , and breaking the seals of a large packet , he produced the will of Philip Augustus , Marquess of Monmouth , which had been retained in his custody since its execution . By this will , of the date of 1829 , the sum of ten thousand pounds was left to Coningsby , then unknown to his grandfather ; the same sum to Mr. Rigby . There were a great number of legacies , none of inferior amount , most of them of a less ; these were chiefly left to old male companions and women in various countries . There was an almost inconceivable number of small annuities to faithful servants , decayed actors , and obscure foreigners . The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen ; three of whom had quitted this world before the legator ; the bequests therefore had lapsed . The fourth residuary legatee , in whom according to the terms of the will all would have consequently centred was Mr. Rigby . There followed several codicils which did not materially effect the previous disposition ; one of them leaving a legacy of £ 20,000 to the Princess Colonna ; until they arrived at the latter part of the year 1832 , when a codicil increased the £ 10,000 left under the will to Coningsby to £ 50,000 . After Coningsby 's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth 's estate . The legacy of £ 50,000 in his favour was revoked , and the same sum left to the Princess Lucretia . A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr. Rigby ; and Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee . The marriage led to a considerable modification . An estate of about nine thousand a year which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased , and was therefore in his own disposition was left to Coningsby . The legacy to Mr. Rigby was reduced to £ 20,000 , and the whole of his residue left to his issue by Lady Monmouth ; in case he died without issue , the estate bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account , and the residue then to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson . It was under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor , and to whom Lord Monmouth left , among others , his celebrated picture of the Holy Family by Murillo , as his friend had often admired it . To Lord Eskdale he left all his female miniatures , and to Mr. Ormsby his rare and splendid collection of French novels , and all his wines , except his Tokay , which he left , with his library to Sir Robert Peel ; though this legacy was afterwards revoked in consequence of Sir Robert 's conduct about the Irish Corporations . The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water . While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the room , but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity of the lawyer . Coningsby was silent , his brow a little knit ; Mr. Rigby was extremely pale and restless , but said nothing . Mr. Ormsby took a pinch of snuff , and offered his box to Lord Eskdale who was next to him . They exchanged glances , and made some observation about the weather . Sidonia stood apart with his arms folded . He had not of course attended the funeral , nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby . "
175232	175237	174185	174185	they	5585	" said the solicitor , "
175245	175661	175241	175241	I	0	" They came to the year 1839 , the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley . This appeared to be a very critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth ; while Coningsby 's reached to the culminating point . Mr. Rigby was reduced to his original legacy under the will of £ 10,000 ; a sum of equal amount was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque in acknowledgment of faithful services ; all the disposition in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked , and she was limited to her moderate jointure of £ 3,000 per annum , under the marriage settlement ; while everything without reserve was left absolutely to Coningsby . A subsequent codicil determined that the £ 10,000 left to Mr. Rigby should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay , but as some compensation , Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby the bust of that gentleman , which he had himself presented to his Lordship , and which at his desire had been placed in the vestibule at Coningsby Castle , from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth 's decease Mr. Rigby might wish perhaps to present it to some other friend . Lord Eskdale and Mr. Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr. Rigby . As for Coningsby he saw nobody . He maintained during the extraordinary situation in which he was placed a firm demeanour ; but serene and regulated as he appeared to the spectators , his nerves were really strung to a high pitch . There was yet another codicil . It bore the date of June 1840 ; and was made at Brighton immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth . It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great emergency . He had a wild conviction that after all , it must set all right . He felt assured that as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed of , it must principally refer to the disheritance of Coningsby — secured by Rigby 's well - timed and malignant mis - representations of what had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer . And then to whom could Lord Monmouth leave his money ? However he might cut and carve up his fortunes , Rigby , and especially at a moment when he had so served him , must come in for a considerable slice . His prescient mind was right . All the dispositions in favour of "
175666	175725	175959	175961	Marie Estelle Matteau	608	" were revoked ; and he inherited from his grandfather only the interest of the sum of £ 10,000 which had been originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood . The executors had the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper for his advancement in life , provided always it was not placed in "
175733	175951	175959	175961	Marie Estelle Matteau	608	" Coningsby turned pale ; he lost his abstracted look , he caught the eye of Rigby , he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious countenance . What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was thought and sensation enough for a year , yet it was as the flash that reveals a whole country , yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens . There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle these conventional calamities ; a natural and sacred confidence in his youth and health , and knowledge and convictions . Even the recollection of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations . At least the mightiest foe to their union was departed . All this was the impression of an instant , simultaneous with the reading of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of £ 30,000 to Armand Villebecque ; and all the rest , residue , and remainder of his unentailed property wheresoever and whatsoever it might be , amounting in value to nearly a million sterling , was given devised and bequeathed to Flora , commonly called Flora Villebecque , the step - child of the said Armand Villebecque , "
175981	175982	175979	175979	Stella	608	" "
175988	176016	175979	175979	Stella	608	" said Coningsby with a grave rather than agitated countenance to Sidonia , as his friend came up to greet him without however any expression of condolence . "
176028	176037	176022	176022	you	5592	" said Sidonia . Coningsby shrugged his shoulders . "
176047	176051	176022	176022	you	5592	" said Sidonia , "
176090	176211	176083	176083	we	5594	" So saying Sidonia good - naturedly got Coningsby out of the room . They walked together to Sidonia 's house in Carlton Gardens , neither of them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe ; Sidonia inquiring where he had been , what he had been doing , since they last met , and himself conversing in his usual vein , though with a little more feeling in his manner than was his custom . When they had arrived there , Sidonia ordered their dinner instantly , and during the interval between the command and its appearance , he called Coningsby 's attention to an old German painting he had just received , its brilliant colouring and quaint costumes . "
176220	176231	176083	176083	we	5594	" said Sidonia , when he observed Coningsby somewhat reluctant . "

177636	178506	177628	177628	I	0	" Alone in his chambers , no longer under the sustaining influence of Sidonia 's converse and counsel , the shades of night descending and bearing gloom to the gloomy , all the excitement of his spirit evaporated , the heart of Coningsby sank . All now depended on himself , and in that self he had no trust . Why should he succeed ? Success was the most rare of results . Thousands fail ; units triumph . And even success could only be conducted to him by the course of many years . His career , even if prosperous , was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which the heart of man could be called upon to sustain . Upon the stern altar of his fortunes , he must immolate his first and enduring love . Before , he had a perilous position to offer Edith ; now he had none . The future might then have aided them ; there was no combination which could improve his present . Under any circumstances , he must after all his thought and studies , commence a new novitiate , and before he could enter the arena , must pass years of silent and obscure preparation . ' Twas very bitter . He looked up , his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts . That was all that was to remain of their loves . He was to bear it to the future scene of his labours , to remind him through revolving years of toil and routine , that he too had had his romance , had roamed in fair gardens , and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion . That drawing was to become the altar piece of his life . Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep , waking often with a consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune , yet with a very indefinite conception of its nature . He woke exhausted and dispirited . It was a gloomy day , a raw north - easter blowing up the cloisters of the Albany , in which the fog was lingering , the newspaper on his breakfast table full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather 's will , which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him : What a contrast to St. Geneviève ! To the bright bracing morn of that merry Christmas ! That radiant and cheerful scene , and those gracious and beaming personages , seemed another world and order of beings to the one he now habited and the people with whom he must now commune . The Great Seal indeed ! It was the wild excitement of despair , the frenzied hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin , that could alone have inspired such a hallucination ! His unstrung heart deserted him . His energies could rally no more . He gave orders that he was at home to no one ; and in his dressing gown and slippers , with his feet resting on the fire - place , the once high - souled and noble - hearted Coningsby delivered himself up to despair . The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie . Nothing rose to his consciousness . He was like a particle of Chaos ; at the best , a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades . Towards evening the wind changed , the fog dispersed , there came a clear starry night , brisk and bright . Coningsby roused himself , dressed , and wrapping his cloak around him sallied forth . Once more in the mighty streets , surrounded by millions , his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper position . Well had Sidonia taught him , view everything in its relation to the rest . ' Tis the secret of all wisdom . Here was the mightiest of modern cities ; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient . Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes , what was it to the passing throng ? They would not share his splendour , or his luxury , or his comfort . But a word from his lip , a thought from his brain expressed at the right time , at the right place , might turn their hearts , might influence their passions , might change their opinions , might affect their destiny . Nothing is great but the personal . As civilisation advances , the accidents of life become each day less important . The power of man , his greatness and his glory , depend on essential qualities . Brains every day become more precious than blood . You must give men new ideas , you must teach them new words , you must modify their manners , you must change their laws , you must root out prejudices , subvert convictions , if you wish to be great . Greatness no longer depends on rentals ; the world is too rich ; nor on pedigrees ; the world is too knowing . "
178516	178520	177628	177628	I	0	" said Coningsby , "
178529	179049	179050	179050	You	5627	" This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of intrinsic strength . It is indeed the test of a creative spirit . From that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him . He felt that he must be prepared for great sacrifices , for infinite suffering ; that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity , struggle , envy and hatred , vulgar prejudice , base criticism , petty hostilities , but the dawn would break , and the hour arrive , when the welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be re - echoed . He returned to his rooms ; calm , resolute . He slept the deep sleep of a man void of anxiety ; that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his visions , but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great human struggle . And the morrow came . Fresh , vigorous , not rash or precipitate , yet determined to lose no time in idle meditation , Coningsby already resolved at once to quit his present residence was projecting a visit to some legal quarter , where he intended in future to reside , when his servant brought him a note . The handwriting was feminine . The note was from Flora . The contents were brief . She begged Mr. Coningsby with great earnestness to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on her at his earliest convenience , at the hotel in Brook Street where she now resided . It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided ; yet it seemed to him , after a moment 's reflection , neither just nor kind , nor manly to refuse her request . Flora had not injured him . She was after all his kin . Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of her lot ? He replied , therefore , that in an hour he would wait upon her . In an hour then two individuals are to be brought together , whose first meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different . Then Coningsby was the patron , a generous and spontaneous one , of a being obscure , almost friendless , and sinking under bitter mortification . His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the chosen relative of a powerful noble . That noble was no more ; his vast inheritance had devolved on the disregarded , even despised actress , whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed , and whose fortune had risen on the destruction of all his prospects , and the baulk of all his aspirations . Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room . The extreme delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning , and seated in a cushioned chair , from which she seemed to rise with an effort , she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate and prosperous heiress . "
179059	179085	179050	179050	You	5627	" she said , faintly smiling . Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately in which she placed her own , looking down much embarrassed . "
179093	179107	179086	179086	You	5627	" said Coningsby , trying to break the first awkwardness of their meeting . "
179119	179120	179121	179121	You	5627	" "
179126	179127	179121	179121	You	5627	" "
179137	179151	179152	179152	I	0	" There was a slight pause ; and then Flora sighed and said : "
179180	179181	179173	179173	You	5627	" "
179186	179196	179182	179182	I	0	" said Coningsby in a tone of great kindness , "

179325	179348	179349	179349	I	0	" said Flora . She sighed again with a downcast glance . Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply , she added : "
179367	179368	179359	179359	I	0	" "
179381	179387	179372	179372	yours	5627	" said Coningsby much moved ; "

179416	179437	179406	179406	I	0	" said Flora , mournfully ; then speaking with unusual animation , with a degree of excitement , she continued : "

179677	179678	179680	179680	you	0	" "

179732	179750	179724	179724	they	5642	" said Flora , speaking in a choaking voice , and not meeting the glance of Coningsby . "
179818	179819	179822	179822	my	0	" "
179832	179841	179825	179825	I	0	" said Coningsby with a cheek of scarlet . "
179850	179854	179855	179855	he	0	" exclaimed Flora , "
179861	179871	179855	179855	he	0	" and the tears stole down her pale cheek . "
179895	179911	179881	179881	I	0	" and Coningsby much agitated drew his chair nearer to her and took her hand . "
179960	179984	179985	179985	You	0	" He rose as if to depart . When she saw that , she started , and seemed to summon all her energies . "
179989	179993	179985	179985	You	0	" she exclaimed , "
180164	180165	180166	180166	You	0	" "
180265	180439	180440	180442	My dear fellow	2606	" Mournfully he bade her farewell . About a week after this interview with Flora , as Coningsby one morning was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the Temple to which his notice had been attracted , there was a loud ring , a bustle in the hall , and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in . There never was such a cordial meeting ; and yet the faces of his friends were serious . The truth is , the paragraphs in the newspapers had circulated in the country , they had written to Coningsby , and after a brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions . Immediately they came up to town . Henry Sydney , a younger son , could offer little but sympathy , but he declared that it was his intention also to study for the Bar , so they should not be divided . Buckhurst after many embraces , and some ordinary talk , took Coningsby aside , and said , "
180493	180584	180585	180585	I	0	" There was something in Buckhurst 's servent resolution very loveable and a little humorous , just enough to put one in a good temper with human nature and life . If there were any fellow 's fortune in the world that Coningsby would share , Buckhurst 's would have had the preference , but while he pressed his hand , and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed to contend for mastery , he gently indicated why such arrangements were with our present manners impossible . "
180588	180597	180585	180585	I	0	" said Buckhurst after a moment 's thought . "
180658	180659	180648	180648	Jove	375	" "
180666	180670	180648	180648	Jove	375	" said Coningsby . "
180697	180979	180687	180687	I	0	" It was a fine day , and it was by no means a gloomy walk . Though the two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth and miserable about their companion , once more in his society and finding little difference in his carriage , they assumed unconsciously their habitual tone . As for Buckhurst , he was delighted with the Temple which he visited for the first time . The name enchanted him . The tombs in the Church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career . He would have himself become a law student , if he might have prosecuted his studies in chain armour . The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion of his life amid these halls and courts , gardens and terraces , that maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century so much of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners . Henry Sydney was very sanguine ; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to make him a Lord Chancellor . These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was established in Paper Buildings , and had become a pupil of a celebrated special pleader . They would have remained longer , had not he himself suggested that it was better that they should part . They parted with deep emotion . It seemed a terrible catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days ; their college dreams ; and their dazzling adventures in the world . "
181004	181015	180988	180990	the brilliant Coningsby	5654	" said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as they quitted him . "
181030	181031	180988	180990	the brilliant Coningsby	5654	" "
181037	181042	180988	180990	the brilliant Coningsby	5654	" said Lord Henry , "
181109	181110	181099	181099	I	0	" "
181113	181117	181099	181099	I	0	" said Buckhurst , "
181189	181190	181191	181191	I	0	" "
181202	183402	181196	181196	Coningsby	329	" said Henry Sydney gravely . This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution . It was sudden and complete . Within a month after the death of his grandfather , his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs , his horses and carriages sold , and he had become a student of the Temple . He entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit . His being was completely absorbed in it . There was nothing to haunt his mind ; no inexperienced scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence . One sacred thought alone indeed there remained , shrined in the innermost sanctuary of his heart and consciousness . But it was a tradition , no longer a hope . The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of his grandfather 's will , had clearly ascertained the consequences to himself , and had resolved on the course to pursue , he had communicated unreservedly with Oswald Millbank , and had renounced those pretensions to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer . His letter was answered in person . Millbank met Henry Sydney and Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby . Once more they were all four together ; but under what different circumstances , and with what different prospects to those which attended their separation at Eton ! Alone with Coningsby , Millbank spoke to him things which letters could not convey . He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith , but they would not conceal from themselves that , at this moment , and in the present state of affairs , all was hopeless . In no way did Coningsby ever permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance . He was of course silent on it to his other friends , as any communication of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his inmost soul . The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated in the first chapter of this work . The banners of the Conservative camp at this moment lowered on the Whig forces as the gathering host of the Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex . The Whigs were not yet conquered , but they were doomed ; and they themselves knew it . The mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining office in 1839 , and whether we consider their conduct in a national and constitutional light , or as a mere question of political tactics and party prudence , it was unquestionably a great mistake , had infused into the corpse of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action , which only the superficial could mistake for vitality . Even to form a basis for their future operations , after the conjuncture of—39 , the Whigs were obliged to make a fresh inroad on the revenue , the daily increasing debility of which was now arresting attention , and exciting public alarm . It was clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial . Under all the circumstances of the case , the conduct of the Whig Cabinet in their final propositions can not be described as deficient either in boldness or prudence . The policy which they recommended was in itself a sagacious and spirited policy , but they erred in supposing that at the period it was brought forward any measures promoted by the Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country . The Whigs were known to be feeble ; they were looked upon as tricksters . The country knew they were opposed by a very powerful party , and though there certainly never was any authority for the belief , the country did believe that that powerful party were influenced by great principles ; had in their view a definite and national policy ; and would secure England , instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions , energy and a creed . The future effect of the Whig propositions of — 41 will not be detrimental to that party , even if in the interval they be appropriated piecemeal , as will probably be the case , by their Conservative successors . But for the moment , and in the plight in which the Whig party found themselves , it was impossible to have devised measures more conducive to their precipitate fall . Great interests were menaced by a weak government . The consequence was inevitable . Tadpole and Taper saw it in a moment . They snuffed the factious air , and felt the coming storm . Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies , there was a little latent jealousy between them . Tadpole worshipped Registration ; Taper adored a Cry . Tadpole always maintained that it was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day ; Taper , on the contrary , faithful to ancient traditions was ever of opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamor . It always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be popular , the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders not being generally esteemed a sufficient hedge against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions , that the Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places ; and Taper had had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively against the New Poor Law , and for hiring several linkboys to bawl a much wronged lady 's name in the Park when the Court prorogued Parliament . And now after all in 1841 it seemed that Taper was right . There was a great clamour in every quarter , and the clamour was against the Whigs and in favour of Conservative principles . What Canadian timber merchants meant by Conservative principles it is not difficult to conjecture ; or West India planters . It was tolerably clear on the hustings what squires and farmers and their followers meant by Conservative principles . What they mean by Conservative principles now is another question ; and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than the perpetuation of fiscal arrangements some of them very impolitic , none of them very important . But no matter what different bodies of men understood by the cry in which they all joined , the Cry existed ; Taper beat Tadpole ; and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs . Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies , Coningsby could not be altogether insensible to the political crisis . In the political world of course he never mixed , but the friends of his boyhood were deeply interested in affairs , and they lost no opportunity which he would permit them , of cultivating his society . Their occasional fellowship , a visit now and then to Sidonia , and a call sometimes on Flora who lived at Richmond , comprised his social relations . His general acquaintance did not desert him , but he was out of sight , and did not wish to be remembered . Mr. Ormsby asked him to dinner , and occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of Whites ; while Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple , was interested in his progress , and said with an encouraging look , that when he was called to the bar , all his friends must join and get up the steam . Coningsby had once met Mr. Rigby who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt , which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer . Mr. Rigby cut Coningsby . Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque very accurate details as to the cause of Coningsby being disherited . Our hero , if one in such fallen fortunes may still be described as a hero , had mentioned to Lord Eskdale his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him ; but Lord Eskdale , without dwelling on the subject , had assured him that he had reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived , affairs would have been different . He had altered the disposition of his property at a moment of great and general irritation and excitement , and had been too indolent , perhaps really too indisposed , which he was unwilling ever to acknowledge , to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement . Lord Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia , and had told him all about the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr. Millbank , the communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth as to the presence of Oswald Millbank at the Castle and the love of Coningsby for his sister ; all these details , furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale had been duly transferred by that nobleman to his co - executor ; and Sidonia , when he had sufficiently digested them , had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with the whole history . The Dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs , the project of which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before , and yet in which nobody believed to the last moment , at length took place . All the world was dispersed in the heart of the season , and our solitary student of the Temple in his lonely chambers notwithstanding all his efforts , found his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered that the great event to which he had so long looked forward was now occurring , and he after all was no actor in the mighty drama . It was to have been the epoch of his life ; when he was to have found himself in that proud position for which all the studies , and meditations , and higher impulses of his nature , had been preparing him . It was a keen trial of a man . Every one of his friends and old companions were candidates and with sanguine prospects . Lord Henry was certain for a division of his county ; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural borough in his vicinity ; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for a Yorkshire town ; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of a very important manufacturing constituency . They sent their addresses to Coningsby . He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence of his own mind ; often recognised the very expressions to which he had habituated them . Amid the confusion of a general election , no unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to an isolated constituency ; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements of political parties might have detected in these public declarations some intimation of new views , and of a tone of political feeling that has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this country . It was the end of a sultry July day , the last ray of the sun shooting down Pall Mall sweltering with dust ; there was a crowd round the doors of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs , and every now and then an express arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph . Coningsby was walking up Pall Mall . He was going to dine at the Oxford and Cambridge Club , the only club on whose list he had retained his name , that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former fashionable acquaintances . He lighted in his walk on Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Taper , both of whom he knew . The latter did not notice him , but Mr. Tadpole more good - natured bestowed on him a rough nod , not unmarked by a slight expression of coarse pity . Coningsby ordered his dinner , and then took up the evening papers , where he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle ; and read a speech of Buckhurst denouncing the Venetian Constitution to the amazement of several thousand persons apparently not a little terrified by this unknown danger , now first introduced to their notice . Being true Englishmen , they were all against Buckhurst 's opponent , who was of the Venetian party , and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities . Coningsby had dined , and was reading in the library , when a waiter brought up a third edition of the Sun , with electioneering bulletins from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour . Some large letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye . There seemed great excitement in that borough ; strange proceedings had happened . The column was headed , "
183421	184340	184341	184341	We	5667	" His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr. Millbank , his countenance changed , his heart palpitated . Mr. Millbank had resigned the representation of the town but not from weakness ; his avocations demanded his presence ; he had been requested to let his son supply his place , but his son was otherwise provided for ; he should always take a deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford ; he hoped that the link between the Borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished ( loud cheering ) ; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should conciliate all parties , put an end to local heats and factious contentions , and secure the town an able and worthy representative . For these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a name which many of them greatly honoured , for himself he knew the individual , and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his talents , his character , or the ancient connection of his family with the district , he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their confidence than Harry Coningsby , Esq . This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities . The contest between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced , neither party was over confident . The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in behalf of their champion ; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no Coningsby Castle now to back him ; he was fighting on his own resources ; and he was a beaten horse . The Liberals did not like the prospect of a defeat and dreaded the mortification of Rigby 's triumph . The moderate man who thought more of local than political circumstances liked the name of Coningsby . Mr. Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading supporters for the substitution . Some traits of the character and conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated . Thus there was a combination of many favourable causes in his favour . In half an hour 's time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the Borough as an interesting and accomplished youth , who had been wronged and who deserved to be rewarded . It was whispered that Rigby was his enemy . Bully Bluck and his mob offered Mr. Millbank 's Committee to throw Mr. Rigby into the river ; or to burn down his hotel , in case he was prudent enough not to show . Mr. Rigby determined to fight to the last . All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest . It was impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him high office . The whole of Lord Monmouth 's reduced legacy was devoted to this end . The third edition of the Sun left Mr. Rigby in vain attempting to address an infuriated populace . Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby ! When his grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House , his destiny was not verging on greater vicissitudes . He rose from his seat , and was surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark his agitation . Not an individual there that he knew . It was now an hour to midnight , and to - morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to the poll . In a tumult of suppressed emotion , Coningsby returned to his chambers . He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank , who had been twice at the Temple . Oswald had been returned without a contest , and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated . He set off instantly to London for Coningsby and left at his friend 's chambers a rapid narrative of what had happened , with information that he should call on him again on the morrow at nine o'clock , when they were to repair together immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired , for no one entertained a doubt of his triumph . Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night , and yet when he rose early felt fresh enough for any exploit however difficult or hazardous . He felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had been despaired of . At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes , an event had occurred which seemed to restore all . He dared not contemplate the ultimate result of all these wonderful changes . Enough for him that when all seemed dark , he was about to be returned to Parliament by the father of Edith , and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust before him , was the author of all his misfortunes . Love , Vengeance , Justice , the glorious pride of having acted rightly , the triumphant sense of complete and absolute success — here were chaotic materials from which order was at length evolved ; and all - subsided in an overwhelming feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected him . There was a knock at the door . It was Oswald . They embraced . It seemed that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby . His eye sparkled , his manner was energetic . "
184359	185532	185533	185535	My dear fellow	2606	" During that journey , Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his favour . We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disheritance of Coningsby . These he had told to Lady Wallinger , first by letter , afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London . Lady Wallinger had conferred with her husband . She was not surprised at the goodness of Coningsby , and she sympathized with all his calamities . He had ever been the favourite of her judgment , and her romance had always consisted in blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith . Sir Joseph was a judicious man , who never cared to commit himself ; a little selfish , but good , just and honourable , with some impulses only a little afraid of them ; but then his wife stepped in like an angel and gave them the right direction . They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby 's admirable conduct , and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison with herself . Sir Joseph spoke to Mr. Millbank who stared , but Sir Joseph spoke feebly . Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence and all her impressions to Oswald and Edith . The younger Millbank talked with his father , who making no admissions listened with interest , inveighed against Lord Monmouth , and condemned his will . After some time , Mr. Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby , took an interest in his career , and , like Lord Eskdale , declared that when he was called to the bar , his friends would have an opportunity to evince their sincerity . Affairs remained in this state , until Oswald thought that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on the subject . The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his father . When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his parent 's command and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers toiling after all his noble efforts without any results , and his sister pining in a provincial solitude , Oswald began to curse wealth and to ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and supernatural skill . He addressed his father with that irresistible frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire . What are the objects of wealth if not to bless those who possess our hearts ? The only daughter , the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life — here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless , and both are unhappy . Mr. Millbank listened without prejudice , for he was already convinced . But he felt some interest in the present conduct of Coningsby . A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for him . He wished to be assured of its authenticity . He was resolved to convince himself of the fact . And perhaps he would have gone on yet for a little time , and watched the progress of the experiment , already interested and delighted by what had reached him , had not the dissolution brought affairs to a crisis . The misery of Oswald at the position of Coningsby , the silent sadness of Edith , his own conviction which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take this young man to his heart , so ordained it that Mr. Millbank who was after all the creature of impulse , decided suddenly , and decided rightly . Never making a single admission to all the representations of his son , Mr. Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared to desire . This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred at Millbank and Hellingsley ; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their rapid travel . When they arrived at Birmingham they found a messenger and a despatch informing Coningsby that at mid - day at Darlford he was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority , and that Mr. Rigby had resigned . He was however requested to remain at Birmingham , as they did not wish him to enter Darlford except to be chaired , so he was to arrive there in the morning . At Birmingham therefore they remained . There was Oswald 's election to talk of as well as Coningsby 's . They had hardly had time for this . Now they were both Members of Parliament . Men must have been at school together , to enjoy the real fun of meeting thus and realizing boyish dreams . Often years ago they had talked of these things and assumed these results , but those were words and dreams ; these were positive facts ; after some doubts and struggles , in the freshness of their youth , Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby were Members of the British Parliament ; public characters , responsible agents , with a career . This afternoon at Birmingham was as happy an afternoon as usually falls to the lot of man . Both of these companions were labouring under that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity . They had enough to talk about . Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful subject . There was rapture in their again meeting under such circumstances . Then there were their friends ; that dear Buckhurst , who had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian , and all their companions of early days . What a sudden and marvellous change in all their destinies ! Life was a pantomime ; the wand was waved , and it seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power , springs of the great machine . A train arrived ; restless they sallied forth to seek diversion in the dispersion of the passengers . Coningsby and Millbank , with that glance , a little inquisitive , even impertinent , if we must confess it , with which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance , were lounging on the platform . The train arrived ; stopped ; the doors were thrown open , and from one of them emerged Mr. Rigby ! Coningsby , who had dined , was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow , but he refrained . Their eyes met . Rigby was dead beat . He was evidently used up ; a man without a resource ; the sight of Coningsby his last blow ; he had met his fate . "
185537	185541	185533	185535	My dear fellow	2606	" said Coningsby , "
185567	186297	185556	185557	that fellow	8606	" About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford station . Here they were met by an anxious deputation , who received Coningsby as if he were a prophet , and ushered him into a car covered with satin and blue ribbons , and drawn by six beautiful grey horses caparisoned in his colours , and ridden by postillions , whose very whips were blue and white . Triumphant music sounded ; banners waved ; the multitude were marshalled ; the Freemasons at the first opportunity fell into the procession ; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest corner . Preceded and followed by thousands , with colours flying , trumpets sounding , and endless huzzas , flags and handkerchiefs waving from every window , and every balcony filled with dames and maidens bedecked with his colours , Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon . Uncovered , still in deep mourning , his fine figure and graceful bearing , and his intelligent brow , at once won every female heart . The singularity was that all were of the same opinion : everybody cheered him , every house was adorned with his colours . His triumphant return was no party question ; Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked together like lambs at the head of his procession . The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street . It was Mr. Millbank 's committee . The broad street was so crowded , that as every one declared you might have walked on the heads of the people . Every window was full ; the very roofs were peopled . The car stopped , and the populace gave three cheers for Mr. Millbank . Their late member surrounded by his friends stood in the balcony which was fitted up with Coningsby 's colours and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic letters formed of dahlias . The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby caught the form of Edith , who was leaning on her father 's arm . The hustings were opposite the hotel , and here after a while Coningsby was carried , and stepping from his car , took up his post to address for the first time a public assembly . Anxious as the people were to hear him , it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into silence . At length that silence was deep and absolute . He spoke ; his powerful and rich tones reached every ear . In five minutes ' time every one looked at his neighbour , and without speaking they agreed that there never was anything like this heard in Darlford before . He addressed them for a considerable time for he had a great deal to say ; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in which he had become their representative and for the spirit in which they had greeted him ; but he had to offer them no niggard exposition of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly chosen without even a formal declaration of his sentiments . He did this with so much clearness , and in a manner so pointed and popular , that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered . His lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment . But when towards his close he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the character of his future and lasting connexion with the town , the vast throng was singularly affected . There were a great many present at that moment who though they had never seen Coningsby before , would willingly have then died for him . Coningsby had touched their hearts , for he had spoken from his own . His spirit had entirely magnetized them . Darlford believed in Coningsby : and a very good creed . And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel . He walked through the crowd . The progress was slow , as every one wished to shake hands with him . His friends , however , at last safely landed him . He sprang up the stairs : he was met by Mr. Millbank , who welcomed him with the greatest warmth , and offered his hearty congratulations . "
186314	186318	186307	186307	I	0	" said Coningsby . "
186321	186326	186330	186330	your	0	" said Mr. Millbank , "
186342	186364	186365	186365	I	0	" After he had been presented by the late Member to the principal personages in the borough , Mr. Millbank said : "
186377	186382	186383	186383	he	0	" Come with me , "
186386	186400	186383	186383	he	0	" here is some one who will be very glad to see you . "
