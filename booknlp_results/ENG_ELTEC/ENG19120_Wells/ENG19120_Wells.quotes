14741	14751	14765	14765	Marjorie	323	" When I saw you standing there and singing , "
14775	14793	14851	14851	she	323	" I felt I would rather be able to call you mine — than win an empire . "
14837	14850	14974	14975	Mrs. Pope	264	" I think you had better win an empire , Mr. Magnet , "
14966	14972	14974	14975	Mrs. Pope	264	" So modest and unassuming , "
14977	15056	15089	15089	Daffy	258	" You 'd never dream he was quite rich and famous . Yet every book he writes is translated into Russian and German and all sorts of languages . I suppose he 's almost the greatest humorist we have . That play of his ; what is it called?—Our Owd Woman — has been performed nearly twelve hundred times ! I think that is the most wonderful of gifts . Think of the people it has made happy . "

15179	15184	15205	15205	she	258	" They have n't , "
15197	15204	15205	15205	she	258	" Father would swear at them , "
15208	15223	15234	15234	Marjorie	323	" He 'd naturally tie himself up — and we should hear of it . "
15224	15232	15239	15239	her	323	" I did n't think of that , "
15245	15249	15250	15250	She	323	" Sound induction . "

19130	19156	19169	19170	Mr. Magnet	286	" and it 's frightfully jolly just here . Do you think Mr. Wintersloan will paint this ? He does paint , does n't he ? "
19157	19167	19216	19216	Marjorie	323	" I know him best in black and white , "

19218	19229	19250	19250	Marjorie	323	" I think I shall play tennis all the afternoon . "
19230	19241	19250	19250	Marjorie	323	" I do n't play well enough for this publicity . "
19242	19248	19250	19250	Marjorie	323	" It 's glorious exercise , "
19252	19259	19284	19284	She	323	" Almost as good as dancing , "

19692	19705	19707	19708	Mr. Magnet	286	" I often think of that jolly walk we had last summer , "
19710	19721	19779	19780	Mr. Magnet	286	" and how you talked about your work at Oxbridge . "

20650	20660	20684	20685	Mrs. Pope	264	" She looks so charming in that blue dress , "
20673	20682	20684	20685	Mrs. Pope	264	" That bird's - egg blue suits her , "
20691	20711	20765	20765	she	264	" She 's clever in her girlish way , she chooses all her own dresses,—colours , material , everything . "
20760	20764	20765	20765	she	264	" I think , "
20768	20793	20800	20801	Mr. Magnet	286	" it 's a little cool here . Shall we walk to the Water Garden , and see if there are any white lilies ? "

20906	20918	20898	20899	Mrs. Pope	264	" I know I ought not to have done so without consulting you"—he
20923	20941	20942	20943	Mrs. Pope	264	" I 'm very much in love with her . It's —— It 's done no harm . "

20982	21017	21036	21037	Mrs. Pope	264	" I can quite understand . But I 've done no harm . She refused me . I shall go away to - morrow . Go right away for ever .... I 'm sorry . "
21022	21035	21036	21037	Mrs. Pope	264	" To me , of course , she 's just a child , "
21042	21069	21132	21133	Mrs. Pope	264	" She is only a child , Mr. Magnet . She could have had no idea that anything of the sort was in your mind — — "
21126	21130	21149	21150	Mr. Magnet	286	" How beautiful ! "
21140	21147	21174	21174	he	286	" I spoke to her here , "
21160	21173	21174	21174	he	286	" Now I 've spoken to you about it , Mrs. Pope , "
21177	21208	21234	21234	she	264	" I can tell you just how I — oh , it 's the only word — adore her . She seems so sweet and easy — so graceful — — "
21226	21233	21234	21234	she	264	" I ca n't tell you , "
21237	21250	21271	21272	Mr. Magnet	286	" what it means to a mother to hear such things — — "
21266	21269	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" Ah ! "
21289	21297	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" Are you sure , Mr. Magnet , "
21307	21323	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" that she really meant what she said ? Girls are very strange creatures — — "
21324	21332	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" She seems so clear and positive . "
21333	21342	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" Her manner is always clear and positive . "
21343	21349	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" Yes . I know . "
21350	21359	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" I know she has cared for you . "
21360	21363	21298	21299	Mrs. Pope	264	" No ! "
21364	21393	21398	21398	he	286	" A mother sees . When your name used to be mentioned——. But these are not things to talk about . There is something — something sacred — — "
21394	21397	21398	21398	he	286	" Yes , "
21401	21413	21432	21433	Mr. Magnet	286	" Yes . Only —— Of course , one thing — — "
21426	21430	21458	21458	She	264	" I wondered , "
21444	21457	21470	21470	she	264	" I wondered if there should be perhaps — some one else ? "
21464	21469	21470	21470	she	264	" I should know , "
21473	21478	21432	21433	Mr. Magnet	286	" Are you sure ? "
21479	21486	21470	21470	she	264	" I know I should know . "
21487	21491	21432	21433	Mr. Magnet	286	" Perhaps recently ? "
21492	21506	21509	21509	her	264	" I am sure I should know . A mother 's intuition — — "
21513	21557	21580	21580	she	264	" A girl of twenty is a mass of contradictions . I can remember myself as if it was yesterday . Often one says no , or yes — out of sheer nervousness .... I am sure there is no other attachment — — "
21568	21579	21580	21580	she	264	" What a dignity that old gold - fish has ! "
21583	21602	21722	21723	Mrs. Pope	264	" He waves his tail — as if he were a beadle waving little boys out of church . "
21715	21720	21722	21723	Mrs. Pope	264	" I hope dear , "
21725	21743	21769	21770	Mrs. Pope	264	" that it 's all for the best — and that you 've done wisely , dear . "
21755	21768	21786	21786	Marjorie	323	" It 's so difficult to know what is for the best , "
21774	21784	21786	21786	Marjorie	323	" I had to do — as I did , "
21788	21814	21825	21825	Rom	262	" I only hope you may never find you have made a Great Mistake , dear . He cares for you very , very much . "
21815	21823	21825	21825	Rom	262	" Oh ! we see it now ! "
21827	21849	21851	21851	Marjorie	323	" we see it now ! Mummy , have you seen it ? Like a little old round ghost being nursed ! "

24719	24724	24726	24727	Aunt Plessington	253	" And what then ? "
24729	24738	24726	24727	Aunt Plessington	253	" Not very clear , Aunt , yet . "

24749	24754	24726	24727	Aunt Plessington	253	" Yes , Aunt . "
24755	24809	24726	24727	Aunt Plessington	253	" Well , you 've time yet . And it 's just as well to see how the land lies before you begin . It saves going back . You 'll have to come up to London with me for a little while , and see things , and be seen a little . "
24810	24816	24828	24829	Aunt Plessington	253	" I should love to . "

25190	25201	25218	25219	Aunt Plessington	253	" it 's the usual dietary . The usual dietary . "

25232	25238	25240	25243	the Rev. Jopling Baynes	328	" We make an Effort , "
25245	25259	25218	25219	Aunt Plessington	253	" we make an Effort . A Hint here , a Word there . "
25260	25264	25270	25273	the Rev. Jopling Baynes	328	" Nothing organized ? "
25265	25268	25296	25297	Aunt Plessington	253	" No , "
25285	25294	25574	25574	she	253	" We are going to alter all that , "
25567	25573	25574	25574	she	253	" Well , Mr. Magnet , "
25577	25587	25596	25597	Mr. Magnet	286	" I wish I had your sense of humour . "
25588	25594	25607	25608	Aunt Plessington	253	" I wish you had , "
25599	25605	25621	25622	Mr. Magnet	286	" I should write tracts , "
25610	25619	25639	25640	Aunt Plessington	253	" I knew it was good for something , "
25632	25637	25639	25640	Aunt Plessington	253	" I mean it , "
25643	25671	25691	25691	he	286	" Think if we had a Dickens — and you are the nearest man alive to Dickens — on the side of social reform to - day ! "
25680	25690	25704	25705	Aunt Plessington	253	" We do what we can , Mrs. Plessington , "
25694	25702	25704	25705	Aunt Plessington	253	" How much more might be done , "
25707	25714	25722	25723	Mr. Pope	246	" if humour could be organized . "
25715	25720	25722	25723	Mr. Pope	246	" Hear , hear ! "
25725	25741	25751	25752	Mr. Magnet	286	" If all the humorists of England could be induced to laugh at something together . "
25742	25749	25776	25777	Aunt Plessington	253	" They do — at times , "
25765	25774	25795	25795	he	286	" They could laugh it out of existence , "
25790	25794	25795	25795	he	286	" Of course , "
25798	25814	25815	25816	Mrs. Pope	264	" in Punch , to which I happen to be an obscure occasional contributor — — "
25829	25862	25881	25882	Aunt Plessington	253	" We do remember just what we can do either in the way of advertising or injury . I do n't think you 'll find us up against any really solid institutions . "
25863	25880	25881	25882	Aunt Plessington	253	" But do you think , Mr. Magnet , you are sufficiently kind to the New ? "
25885	25895	25897	25900	the Rev. Jopling Baynes	328	" I think we are all grateful to Punch , "
25905	25939	26618	26619	Aunt Plessington	253	" for its steady determination to direct our mirth into the proper channels . I do not think that any one can accuse its editor of being unmindful of his great responsibilities — — "
26612	26616	26643	26644	Aunt Plessington	253	" And what , "
26621	26641	26663	26663	she	253	" do they all amount to ? A girl is so hampered and an old maid is so neglected , "
26649	26662	26685	26685	Marjorie	323	" Why do n't you up and marry Mr. Magnet , Marjorie ? "
26672	26683	26706	26707	Aunt Plessington	253	" It takes two to make a marriage , aunt , "
26691	26704	26719	26719	Marjorie	323	" My dear child ! he worships the ground you tread on ! "
26709	26717	26719	26719	Marjorie	323	" He 's rather — grown up , "
26721	26739	26667	26667	her	253	" Not a bit of it . He 's not forty . He 's just the age . "
26740	26750	26719	26719	Marjorie	323	" I 'm afraid it 's a little impossible . "
26751	26754	26719	26719	Marjorie	323	" Impossible ? "
26755	26765	26667	26667	her	253	" You see I 've refused him , aunt . "
26766	26783	26789	26789	Marjorie	323	" Naturally — the first time ! But I would n't send him packing the second . "
26796	26813	26827	26828	Aunt Plessington	253	" Do you really think , aunt , I should do well to marry Mr. Magnet ? "
26814	26825	26827	26828	Aunt Plessington	253	" He 'd give you everything a clever woman needs , "
26830	26833	26865	26865	she	253	" Everything . "
26851	26864	26865	26865	she	253	" He 's evidently a man who wants helping to a position , "
26868	26957	26974	26974	Marjorie	323	" Of course his farces and things , I 'm told , make no end of money , but he 's just a crude gift by himself . Money like that is nothing . With a clever wife he might be all sorts of things . Without one he 'll just subside — you know the sort of thing this sort of man does . A rather eccentric humorous house in the country , golf , croquet , horse - riding , rose - growing , queer hats . "
26958	26972	26987	26988	Aunt Plessington	253	" Is n't that rather what he would like to do , aunt ? "
26976	26985	27202	27202	her	253	" That 's not our business , Madge , "
27190	27193	27202	27202	her	253	" Then , "
27205	27214	27338	27339	Aunt Plessington	253	" you 'll begin to weed a little . "

35004	35009	34975	34975	he	286	" But a kiss ! "
35010	35017	35025	35025	he	286	" I do n't like it . "
35018	35024	35025	35025	he	286	" I beg your pardon ! "
35028	35042	35074	35074	she	1584	" I forgot——. But you .... You .... I could n't help it . "
35066	35073	35074	35074	she	1584	" I want to go down , "
35077	35113	35118	35118	she	1584	" Marjorie , you have made me the happiest of men ! All my life , all my strength I will spend in showing you that you have made no mistake in trusting me — — "
35114	35117	35118	35118	she	1584	" Yes , "
35121	35124	35159	35159	he	1585	" yes , "
35153	35158	35184	35184	she	1584	" Oh my dear ! "
35174	35183	35235	35235	he	1585	" I want to go down to them ! "
35224	35234	35285	35285	he	246	" I am sure you will never be sorry , "
35266	35284	35285	35285	he	246	" Lands ever bright , days ever fair , And yet we weep that he is there . "
35288	35303	35517	35517	he	246	" You know that 's really Good . That ought to be printed somewhere . "
35513	35516	35517	35517	he	246	" Ah ! "
35520	35524	35623	35623	he	246	" Sly Maggots ! "
35626	35629	35638	35638	he	246	" good night "
35634	35637	35638	35638	he	246	" Madge , "
35641	35644	35744	35744	she	323	" Madge ! "
35763	35770	35744	35744	she	323	" Madge , what 's up ? "
35774	35788	35744	35744	she	323	" I say ! you are n't crying , Madge , are you ? "
35795	35798	35810	35810	Marjorie	323	" Madge ! "
35817	35825	35832	35832	Daffy	258	" Oh shut it , old Daffy . "
35826	35830	35862	35862	she	323	" But Madge ? "
35836	35858	35862	35862	she	323	" Shut it . Do shut it ! Leave me alone , I say ! Ca n't you leave me alone ? Oh!"—and
35869	35881	35974	35975	Mr. Magnet	286	her—"Daffy , do n't worry me . Old Daffy ! Please ! "
35966	35972	35974	35975	Mr. Magnet	286	" More than I hoped , "
35977	35985	36312	36313	Another Marjorie	323	" more than I dared to hope . "
36289	36311	36381	36381	Marjorie	323	" I 've always wished mother would have more flowers — and not keep them so long when she has them .... "
36368	36377	36381	36381	Marjorie	323	" I do n't deserve all this love , "
36385	36396	36404	36404	Magnet	286	" But I mean to learn to love you — — "
36397	36402	36627	36627	he	286	" My dear one ! "
36636	36639	36652	36652	he	286	" Magsy . "
36640	36651	36652	36652	he	286	" We 'll end this scandal of a Girl Pope , "
36655	36673	36813	36813	He	286	" Magsy Magnet , you 'll be — M.M. No women M.P. 's for us , Magsy .... "
36805	36812	36825	36825	she	323	" Common Sense of Municipal Trading . "
36830	36840	36865	36865	he	286	" Good morning . Is n't it perfectly lovely ? "
36856	36864	36888	36888	he	286	" What 's the book , Magsy ? "
36884	36887	36888	36888	he	286	" Um , "
36891	36904	36931	36931	He	286	" Is n't this a bit stiff for little women 's brains ? "
36916	36930	36955	36955	Marjorie	323	" Dreadful word , ' Municipal . ' I do n't like it . "
36942	36953	36955	36955	Marjorie	323	" I suppose women have as good brains as men , "
36957	36964	36970	36970	Magnet	286	" if it comes to that . "
36965	36968	36970	36970	Magnet	286	" Better , "
36972	36994	36955	36955	Marjorie	323	" That 's why they should n't trouble about horrid things like Municipal and Trading .... On a day like this ! "
36995	37007	37012	37012	he	286	" Do n't you think this sort of thing is interesting ? "
37008	37011	37012	37012	he	286	" Oh ! "
37020	37028	36955	36955	Marjorie	323	" Come ! And besides — Shaw ! "
37029	37037	36955	36955	Marjorie	323	" He makes a very good case . "
37038	37047	37012	37012	he	286	" But he 's such a — mountebank . "
37048	37060	37119	37119	He	286	" Does that matter ? He is n't a mountebank there . "
37061	37118	37119	37119	He	286	" He 's not sincere . I doubt if you had a serious book on Municipal Trading , Magsy , whether you 'd make head or tail of it . It 's a stiff subject . Shaw just gets his chance for a smart thing or so .... I 'd rather you read a good novel . "
37131	37143	37012	37012	he	286	" You think I ought not to read an intelligent book . "
37144	37159	37168	37168	He	286	" I think we ought to leave those things to the people who understand . "
37160	37167	37185	37185	he	286	" But we ought to understand . "
37172	37184	37185	37185	he	286	" There 's a lot of things you have to understand , "
37188	37194	37209	37209	she	323	" nearer home than this . "
37200	37208	37267	37267	She	323	" What a silly thing to say ! "
37218	37266	37287	37287	he	286	" Really , you are talking nonsense ! I read that book because it interests me . If I did n't , I should read something else . Do you mean to suggest that I 'm reading like a child , who holds a book upside down ? "
37278	37286	37311	37311	he	286	" I do n't mean to suggest — "
37305	37310	37311	37311	he	286	" Here we are ! "
37314	37319	37325	37326	Mrs. Pope	264	" having a quarrel ! "
37320	37323	37337	37338	Mr. Magnet	286	" Marjorie ! "
37328	37335	37337	37338	Mr. Magnet	286	" Oh , it 's serious ! "
37346	37353	37432	37432	she	264	" It 's about Municipal Trading ! "
37424	37431	37432	37432	she	264	" Oh ! lovers ' quarrels , "
37440	37453	37508	37508	she	264	" Lovers ' quarrels . You must n't ask me to interfere ! "
37503	37507	37508	37508	she	264	" Mr. Magnet , "
37523	37542	37581	37582	Mr. Magnet	286	" has been talking unutterable nonsense . I do n't call that a lovers ' quarrel — anyhow . "
37574	37579	37581	37582	Mr. Magnet	286	" I 'm afraid , "
37584	37599	37610	37611	Mrs. Pope	264	" I was a little too free with one of Magsy 's favourite authors . "
37600	37608	37629	37629	He	286	" Which is the favourite author now ? "
37625	37628	37629	37629	He	286	" Shaw . "
37634	37644	37656	37657	Mrs. Pope	264	" It 's just the age , I suppose . "
37645	37654	37656	37657	Mrs. Pope	264	" She 's frightfully loyal while it lasts , "
37659	37669	37681	37682	Mr. Magnet	286	" No one dare say a word against them . "
37670	37679	38130	38131	Mrs. Pope	264	" I think it 's adorable of her , "
38121	38128	38187	38187	Magnet	286	" Oh , oh , OH ! "
38182	38185	38456	38456	he	1655	" Run ! "
38445	38455	38543	38543	Marjorie	323	" Help me to hold the confounded thing up ! "
38526	38542	38543	38543	Marjorie	323	" That 's right . Can you hold it if I use only one hand ? "
38545	38548	38543	38543	Marjorie	323	" Yes , "
38561	38565	38597	38597	he	1655	" Right O , "
38591	38596	38663	38666	the tall young man	1658	" Keep it up ! "
38656	38661	38744	38745	Mrs. Pope	264	" Let it go , "
38737	38742	38754	38757	the tall young man	1658	" Is he hurt ? "
38747	38752	38777	38777	he	1016	" We both are , "
38780	38787	38794	38794	Marjorie	323	" Can we turn him over ? "
38788	38793	38816	38819	the tall young man	1658	" I think so . "
38807	38814	38845	38845	she	323	" Will you get some water ? "
38839	38844	38897	38897	he	1658	" He wants water , "
38886	38896	38897	38897	he	1658	" The pneumatic cap must have saved his head , "
38905	38935	38956	38956	he	1658	" Lucky he had it . He ca n't be badly hurt . Just rubbed his face along the ground . Silly thing to have come as we did . "
38949	38955	38977	38977	he	1658	" That 's all right , "
38973	38976	38996	38996	he	1658	" Um , "
38991	38995	38999	38999	His	1658	" Thundering smash , "
39007	39015	39048	39048	Marjorie	323	" He only bought it last week . "
39016	39021	39044	39044	He	1658	" Is he hurt ? "
39022	39043	39172	39172	he	1658	" Rib , I think — or two ribs perhaps . Stunned rather . All this — just his nose . "
39161	39171	39187	39188	Mrs. Pope	264	" I 'm afraid I 'm a little rude , "
39175	39185	39187	39188	Mrs. Pope	264	" I do hope your friend is n't hurt , "
39197	39222	39232	39233	Mrs. Pope	264	" He 's not hurt much — so far as I can see . Have n't we made rather a mess of your lawn ? "
39223	39230	39232	39233	Mrs. Pope	264	" Oh , not at all ! "
39235	39283	39332	39332	his	1685	" We have . If that is your gardener over there , it would be nice if he kept back the people who seem to be hesitating beyond those trees . There will be more presently . I 'm afraid I must throw myself on your hands . "
39293	39330	39232	39233	Mrs. Pope	264	" I have , you know . Is it possible to get a doctor ? My friend 's not hurt so very much , but still he wants expert handling . He 's Sir Rupert Solomonson , from"—he
39334	39344	39357	39357	Trafford	365	back—"over beyond Tunbridge Wells . My name 's Trafford . "
39345	39356	39372	39372	he	1685	" I 'm Mrs. Pope and these are my daughters . "
39360	39371	39508	39508	she	323	" We just took the thing out for a lark , "
39502	39507	39508	39508	she	323	" He 's better , "
39511	39522	39562	39562	she	323	" His eyelids flickered . Daffy , bring the water . "
39555	39561	39604	39605	Sir Rupert	364	" Give me your handkerchief , "
39599	39602	39604	39605	Sir Rupert	364	" Wathall ... "
39612	39615	39604	39605	Sir Rupert	364	" Wathall . "
39620	39626	39639	39639	Marjorie	323	" Wathall about , eh ? "
39627	39637	39646	39647	Sir Rupert	364	" If we could get him into the shade , "
39641	39644	39646	39647	Sir Rupert	364	" Woosh , "
39649	39652	39661	39661	Trafford	365	" Weeeooo ! "
39653	39659	39661	39661	Trafford	365	" That 's all right , "
39663	39672	39678	39679	Sir Rupert	364	" It 's only a rib or two . "
39673	39676	39678	39679	Sir Rupert	364	" Eeeeeyoooo ! "
39681	39695	39704	39705	Sir Rupert	364	" Exactly . We 're going to carry you out of the glare . "
39696	39702	39704	39705	Sir Rupert	364	" Do n't touch me , "
39707	39710	40050	40050	he	1707	" Gooo . "
40045	40049	40050	40050	he	1707	" Why not , "
40053	40057	40068	40069	Mrs. Pope	264	" have tea ? "
40058	40066	40068	40069	Mrs. Pope	264	" If you think your friend — — "
40071	40094	40105	40105	Solomonson	364	" Oh ! he 's all right . Are n't you , Solomonson ? There 's nothing more now until the doctor . "
40095	40103	40141	40141	Trafford	365	" Only want to be left alone , "
40130	40139	40239	40243	the odd - job man	1678	" We can keep an eye on him , "
40230	40237	40304	40305	Mr. Trafford	365	" Pretty complete smash , sir ! "
40296	40302	40365	40365	He	365	" Extraordinary all this is , "
40307	40364	40367	40367	himself	365	" Now , here we were after lunch , twenty miles away — smoking cigars and with no more idea of having tea with you than — I was going to say — flying . But that 's out of date now . Then we just thought we 'd try the thing .... Like a dream . "
40371	40405	40416	40417	Mrs. Pope	264	" I never feel that life is quite real until about three days after things have happened . Never . Two hours ago I had not the slightest intention of ever flying again . "
40406	40414	40471	40471	I	0	" But have n't you flown before ? "
40419	40470	40471	40471	I	0	" Not much . I did a little at Sheppey , but it 's so hard for a poor man to get his hands on a machine . And here was Solomonson , with this thing in his hangar , eating its head off . Let 's take it out , "
40474	40498	40519	40519	Trafford	365	" and go once round the park . And here we are .... I thought it was n't wise for him to come .... "
40512	40517	40519	40519	Trafford	365	" Do you know , "
40521	40533	40545	40545	he	365	" The sight of your tea makes me feel frightfully hungry . "
40534	40544	40545	40545	he	365	" I do n't think the engine 's damaged ? "
40549	40553	40555	40555	Magnet	286	" do you ? "
40559	40624	40750	40751	Mrs. Pope	264	" The ailerons are in splinters , and the left wing 's not much better . But that 's about all except the wheels . One falls so much lighter than you might suppose — from the smash .... Lucky it did n't turn over . Then , you know , the engine comes on the top of you , and you 're done . "
40743	40748	40850	40851	Mr. Trafford	365	" Could n't we — "
40854	40860	41042	41042	He	364	" as right as ninepence , "
41047	41051	41411	41411	he	365	" trying the thing "
41419	41426	41454	41454	he	365	" Good God ! What next ? "
41439	41453	41473	41473	Trafford	365	" A man ca n't go away from his house for an hour ! "
41457	41471	41487	41488	Mr. Pope	246	" I can assure you we did all we could to prevent it , "
41475	41485	41487	41488	Mr. Pope	246	" Ought never to have had it to prevent , "
41490	41496	41506	41506	Trafford	365	" Is your friend hurt ? "
41497	41504	41517	41518	Mr. Pope	246	" A rib — and shock , "
41508	41515	41517	41518	Mr. Pope	246	" Well — he deserves it , "
41520	41545	41555	41555	Trafford	365	" Rather than launch myself into the air in one of those infernal things , I 'd be stood against a wall and shot . "
41546	41553	41572	41573	Mr. Pope	246	" Tastes differ , of course , "
41561	41570	41597	41597	Trafford	365	" You 'll have all this cleared away , "
41575	41595	41597	41597	Trafford	365	" Mechanics — oh ! a complete break - down party — are speeding to us in fast motors , "
41599	41614	41626	41627	Mr. Pope	246	" Thanks to the kindness of your domestic in taking a telegram for me . "
41615	41624	41645	41645	he	246	" Hope they wo n't kill any one , "
41639	41644	41645	41645	he	246	" And your friend ? "
41648	41672	41597	41597	Trafford	365	" He goes in the next ten minutes — well , whenever the litter comes from the doctor 's . Poor old Solomonson ! "
41673	41676	41645	41645	he	246	" Solomonson ? "
41677	41681	41687	41688	Mr. Pope	246	" Sir Rupert . "
41682	41685	41687	41688	Mr. Pope	246	" Oh ! "
41690	41697	41713	41713	Trafford	365	" Is that the Pigmentation Solomonson ? "
41698	41711	41713	41713	Trafford	365	" I believe he does do some beastly company of that sort , "
41715	41727	41935	41936	Mr. Pope	246	" Is n't it amazing we did n't smash our engine ? "
41929	41933	41935	41936	Mr. Pope	246	" Good God ! "
41938	41945	41954	41955	Mr. Magnet,—"and	372	" What next ? What next ? "
41946	41952	41935	41936	Mr. Pope	246	" Registration , I hope , "
41955	41963	41973	41974	Mr. Pope—"it	373	Magnet,—"and relegation to the desert of Sahara . "
41964	41971	41935	41936	Mr. Pope	246	" One good thing about it , "
41974	41990	42002	42003	Mrs. Pope	264	Pope—"it all wastes petrol . And when the petrol supply gives out — they're done . "
41991	42000	42006	42006	she	264	" Certainly we might all have been killed ! "
42019	42033	42074	42075	Mr. Pope	246	" If we had n't moved out of the way , that is . "
42067	42072	42074	42075	Mr. Pope	246	" Look at it ! "
42081	42086	42103	42104	Mr. Pope	246	" Look at it ! "
42093	42101	42124	42124	Marjorie	323	" They 'll never come to anything , "
42113	42122	42135	42136	Mr. Magnet	286	" But they have to come to something , "
42126	42133	42135	42136	Mr. Magnet	286	" They 've come to smash ! "
42145	42161	42170	42171	Mr. Magnet	286	" But consider the impudence of this invasion , the wild — objectionableness of it ! "
42162	42168	42170	42171	Mr. Magnet	286	" They 're nasty things , "
42173	42177	42232	42232	she	323	" Nasty things ! "
42223	42231	42257	42257	he	286	" Is n't the engine rather wonderful ? "
42249	42256	42257	42257	he	286	" It 's the usual sort , "
42260	42271	42285	42286	Mr. Magnet	286	" There were n't engines like that twenty years ago . "
42272	42283	42360	42360	he	246	" There were n't people like you twenty years ago , "
42350	42359	42360	42360	he	246	" They 've left us our tennis lawn , "
42372	42392	42407	42407	Magnet	286	" What do you say , Magnet ? Now you 've begun the game you must keep it up ? "
42393	42405	42772	42772	his	286	" If Marjorie , or Mrs. Pope , or Daffy ... ? "
42782	42791	43347	43347	he	365	" Rather a stiff job for little Marjorie , "
43343	43346	43347	43347	he	365	" Hullo ! "
43350	43447	43332	43332	he	365	" I 'm taking the air . You seem to be able to drive donkeys forward . How do you do it ? I ca n't . Never done anything so dangerous in my life before . I 've just been missed by two motor cars , and hung for a terrible minute with my left wheel on the very verge of an unfathomable ditch . I could hear the little ducklings far , far below , and bits of mould dropping . I tried to count before the splash . Are n't you — white ? "
43448	43456	43519	43519	Marjorie	323	" But why are you doing it ? "
43457	43518	43552	43552	he	1794	" One must do something . I 'm bandaged up and ca n't walk . It hurt my leg more than I knew — your doctor says . Solomonson wo n't talk of anything but how he feels , and I do n't care a rap how he feels . So I got this thing and came out with it . "
43530	43551	43552	43552	he	1794	" Some day no one will believe that men were ever so foolish as to trust themselves to draught animals , "
43555	43566	43653	43653	Trafford	365	" Hullo ! Look out ! The horror of it ! "
43643	43651	43653	43653	Trafford	365	" I leave the situation to you , "
43655	43671	43682	43682	Marjorie	323	" Or shall we just sit and talk until the next motor car kills us ? "
43672	43680	43788	43788	Trafford	365	" We ought to make an effort , "
43775	43786	43788	43788	Trafford	365	" It seems to me clearly a case for compromise , "
43790	43822	43839	43839	he	1800	" You want to go that way , I want to go that way . Let us both go this way . It is by such arrangements that civilization becomes possible . "
43833	43838	43848	43848	she	323	" Shall we race ? "
43842	43847	43848	43848	she	323	" With your leg ? "
43851	43924	43953	43953	Trafford	365	" No ; with the donkeys . I say , this is rather a lark . At first I thought it was both dangerous and dull . But things have changed . I am in beastly high spirits . I feel there will be a cry before night ; but still , I am —— I wanted the companionship of an unbroken person . It 's so jolly to meet you again . "
43925	43928	43953	43953	Trafford	365	" Again ? "
43929	43936	43848	43848	she	323	" After the year before last . "
43937	43944	43953	43953	Trafford	365	" After the year before last ? "
43945	43951	43953	43953	Trafford	365	" You did n't know , "
43955	44003	44012	44012	Marjorie	323	" I had met you before ? How aggressive I must have seemed ! Well , I was n't quite clear . I spent the greater part of last night — my ankle being foolish in the small hours — in trying to remember how and where . "
44004	44010	44012	44012	Marjorie	323	" I do n't remember , "
44014	44099	44012	44012	Marjorie	323	" I remembered you very distinctly , and some things I thought about you , but not where it had happened . Then in the night I got it . It is a puzzle , is n't it ? You see , I was wearing a black gown , and I had been out of the sunlight for some months — and my eye , I remember it acutely , was bandaged . I 'm usually bandaged somewhere . — I mean a candidate . "
44104	44110	44206	44206	He	1805	" You 're Professor Trafford . "
44111	44205	44225	44225	He	1805	" Not in this atmosphere . But I am at the Romeike College . And as soon as I recalled examining you I remembered it — minutely . You were intelligent , though unsound — about cryo - hydrates it was . Ah , you remember me now . As most young women are correct by rote and unintelligent in such questions , and as it does n't matter a rap about anything of that sort , whether you are correct or not , as long as the mental gesture is right — — "
44219	44224	44257	44257	he	1805	" I remembered you . "
44261	44300	44306	44306	he	1805	" You set me philosophizing . I 'd never examined a girls ' school before , and I was suddenly struck by the spectacle of the fifty of you . What 's going to become of them all ? "
44301	44305	44306	44306	he	1805	" I thought , "
44310	44432	44459	44459	she	323	" how bright you were , and how keen and eager you were — you , I mean , in particular — and just how certain it was your brightness and eagerness would be swallowed up by some silly ordinariness or other — stuffy marriage or stuffy domestic duties . The old , old story — done over again with a sort of threadbare badness . ( Nothing to say against it if it 's done well . ) I got quite sentimental and pathetic about life 's breach of faith with women . Odd , is n't it , how one 's mind runs on . But that 's what I thought . It 's all come back to me . "
44444	44458	44472	44472	She	323	" I do n't see very much wrong with the lot of women , "
44462	44471	44472	44472	She	323	" Things are different nowadays . Anyhow — — "
44475	44485	44490	44490	She	323	" You do n't want to be a man ? "
44486	44489	44508	44508	he	1805	" No ! "
44494	44507	44555	44555	she	323	" Some of us cut more sharply at life than you think , "
44551	44554	44555	44555	she	323	" Oh , "
44558	44563	44584	44584	he	1805	" perhaps you do , "
44573	44583	44788	44788	He	1808	" I 'm half - feminine , I believe , "
44587	44787	44788	44788	He	1808	" For instance , I 've got just a woman 's joy in textures and little significant shapes . I know how you feel about that . I can spend hours , even now , in crystal gazing — I do n't mean to see some silly revelation of some silly person 's proceedings somewhere , but just for the things themselves . I wonder if you have ever been in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington , and looked at Ruskin 's crystal collection ? I saw it when I was a boy , and it became — I ca n't help the word — an obsession . The inclusions like moss and like trees , and all sorts of fantastic things , and the cleavages and enclosures with little bubbles , and the lights and shimmer — What were we talking about ? Oh , about the keen way your feminine perceptions cut into things . And yet somehow I was throwing contempt on the feminine intelligence . I do n't do justice to the order of my thoughts . Never mind . We 've lost the thread . But I wish you knew my mother . "
44802	44904	44912	44912	Marjorie	323	" You see , I 'm her only son and she brought me up , and we know each other — oh ! very well . She helps with my work . She understands nearly all of it . She makes suggestions . And to this day I do n't know if she 's the most original or the most parasitic of creatures . And that 's the way with all women and girls , it seems to me . You 're as critical as light , and as undiscriminating .... I say , do I strike you as talking nonsense ? "
44905	44910	44912	44912	Marjorie	323	" Not a bit , "
44914	44922	44928	44928	he	1809	" But you do go rather fast . "
44923	44927	44974	44974	He	1809	" I know , "
44931	44973	44988	44988	Marjorie	323	" But somehow you excite me . I 've been with Solomonson a week , and he 's dull at all times . It was that made me take out that monoplane of his . But it did him no good . "
44977	44986	44988	44988	Marjorie	323	" They told me after the exam . , "
44990	45000	44912	44912	Marjorie	323	" you knew more about crystallography — than anyone . "
45001	45011	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" Does that strike you as a dull subject ? "
45012	45015	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" No , "
45026	45080	45088	45088	Marjorie	323	" It is n't . I think — naturally , that the world one goes into when one studies molecular physics is quite the most beautiful of Wonderlands .... I can assure you I work sometimes like a man who is exploring a magic palace .... Do you know anything of molecular physics ? "
45081	45086	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" You examined me , "
45090	45290	45301	45301	Marjorie	323	" The sense one has of exquisite and wonderful rhythms — just beyond sound and sight ! And there 's a taunting suggestion of its being all there , displayed and confessed , if only one were quick enough to see it . Why , for instance , when you change the composition of a felspar almost imperceptibly , do the angles change ? What 's the correspondence between the altered angle and the substituted atom ? Why does this bit of clear stuff swing the ray of light so much out of its path , and that swing it more ? Then what happens when crystals gutter down , and go into solution . The endless launching of innumerable little craft . Think what a clear solution must be if only one had ultra - microscopic eyes and could see into it , see the extraordinary patternings , the swimming circling constellations . And then the path of a ray of polarized light beating through it ! It takes me like music . Do you know anything of the effects of polarized light , the sight of a slice of olivine - gabbro for instance between crossed Nicols ? "
45291	45299	45301	45301	Marjorie	323	" I 've seen some rock sections , "
45303	45312	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" I forget the names of the rocks . "
45313	45317	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" The colours ? "
45318	45325	45301	45301	Marjorie	323	" Oh yes , the colours . "
45326	45369	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" Is there anything else so rich and beautiful in all the world ? And every different mineral and every variety of that mineral has a different palette of colours , a different scheme of harmonies — and is telling you something . "
45370	45376	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" If only you understood . "
45377	45442	45449	45449	Marjorie	323	" Exactly . All the ordinary stuff of life — you know — the carts and motor cars and dusty roads and — cinder sifting , seems so blank to me — with that persuasion of swing and subtlety beneath it all . As if the whole world was fire and crystal and aquiver — with some sort of cotton wrappers thrown over it .... "
45443	45447	45449	45449	Marjorie	323	" Dust sheets , "
45451	45455	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" I know . "
45456	45464	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" Or like a diamond painted over ! "
45465	45481	45449	45449	Marjorie	323	" With that sort of grey paint , very full of body — that lasts . "
45482	45485	45486	45486	He	1810	" Yes . "
45491	45509	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" I ca n't help apologetics . Most people think a professor of science is just — — "
45510	45516	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" A professor of science . "
45517	45585	45595	45595	Marjorie	323	" Yes . Something all pedantries and phrases . I want to clear my character . As though it is foolish to follow a vortex ring into a vacuum , and wise to whack at a dirty golf ball on a suburban railway bank . Oh , their golf ! Under high heaven ! ... You do n't play golf , do you , by any chance ? "
45586	45593	45604	45604	he	1810	" Only the woman 's part , "
45597	45603	45604	45604	he	1810	" And they despise us , "
45607	45655	45017	45017	Marjorie	323	" Solomonson can hardly hide how he despises us . Nothing is more wonderful than the way these people go on despising us who do research , who have this fever of curiosity , who wo n't be content with — what did you call those wrappers ? "
45656	45660	45728	45728	he	1810	" Dust sheets . "
45661	45727	45840	45840	He	1810	" Yes , dust sheets . What a life ! Swaddling bands , dust sheets and a shroud ! You know , research and discovery are n't nearly so difficult as people think — if only you have the courage to say a thing or try a thing now and then that it is n't usual to say or try . And after all — — "
45735	45839	45859	45859	Marjorie	323	" these confounded ordinary people are n't justified in their contempt . We keep on throwing them things over our shoulders , electric bells , telephones , Marconigrams . Look at the beautiful electric trains that come towering down the London streets at nightfall , ships of light in full sail ! Twenty years ago they were as impossible as immortality . We conquer the seas for these — golfers , puts arms in their hands that will certainly blow them all to bits if ever the idiots go to war with them , come sailing out of the air on them — — "
45848	45857	45872	45873	Mr. Trafford	365	" Falling out of the air on them , "
45863	45870	45951	45952	No one	4871	" That was only an accident , "
45945	45950	45976	45977	Sir Rupert	364	" three mortal hours . "
45985	45992	46002	46003	Sir Rupert	364	" But not so damned quiet . "
45993	46000	46002	46003	Sir Rupert	364	" I 'd have been glad , "
46005	46057	46074	46074	she	264	" if a hen had laid an egg and clucked a bit . You might have thought there had been a Resurrection or somethin' , and cleared off everybody . Lord ! it was deadly . I 'd have sung out myself if it had n't been for these infernal ribs .... "
46068	46073	46074	46074	she	264	" Well , Marjorie , "
46084	46091	46101	46101	Marjorie	323	" did you get your laces ? "
46092	46099	46115	46116	Mrs. Pope	264	" Never got there , Mummy , "
46107	46113	46115	46116	Mrs. Pope	264	" Did n't get there ! "
46118	46134	46174	46174	she	323	" That 's worse than Theodore ! Would n't the donkey go , poor dear ? "
46166	46173	46174	46174	she	323	" I had a romantic adventure , "
46179	46187	46202	46202	Marjorie	323	" I was going to tell you . "
46192	46200	46202	46202	Marjorie	323	" You see it was like this , "
46204	46211	46355	46355	Marjorie	323	" I ran against Mr. Trafford .... "
46340	46353	46355	46355	Marjorie	323	" Oh , they 'd talked for half - an - hour , "
46368	46394	46405	46405	Daffy	258	" He did all the talking . You saw what he was yesterday . And the donkeys seemed too happy together to tear them away . "
46395	46403	46421	46421	Marjorie	323	" But what was it all about ? "
46408	46419	46421	46421	Marjorie	323	" He asked after you , Daffy , most affectionately , "
46426	46430	46455	46455	she	323	" several times . "
46451	46454	46455	46455	she	323	" And , "
46466	46491	46632	46633	Mr. Magnet	286	" he explained all about aeroplanes . And all that sort of thing . Has Daddy gone to Wamping for some more cricket ? ... "
46640	46647	46916	46917	the reporter	1832	" There was a story , he said,"—so
46650	46912	46963	46963	he	286	began—"whose hallowed antiquity ought to protect it from further exploitation , but he was tempted to repeat it because it offered certain analogies to the present situation . There were three characters in the story , a bluebottle and two Scotsmen . ( Laughter . ) The bluebottle buzzed on the pane , otherwise a profound silence reigned . This was broken by one of the Scotsmen trying to locate the bluebottle with zoölogical exactitude . Said this Scotsman : ' Sandy , I am thinking if yon fly is a birdie or a beastie . ' The other replied : ' Man , do n't spoil good whiskey with religious conversation . ' ( Laughter . ) He was tempted , Mr. Magnet resumed , to ask himself and them why it was that they should spoil the aftereffects of a most excellent and admirably served dinner by an academic discussion on British humour . At first he was pained by the thought that they proposed to temper their hospitality with a demand for a speech . A closer inspection showed that he was to introduce a debate and that others were to speak , and that was a new element in their hospitality . Further , he was permitted to choose the subject so that he could bring their speeches within the range of his comprehension . ( Laughter . ) His was an easy task . He could make it easier ; the best thing to do would be to say nothing at all . ( Laughter . ) "
46952	46962	46963	46963	he	286	" There was the humour of facts and situations , "
46967	47067	47069	47069	Marjorie	323	" or that humour of expression for which there was no human responsibility , as in the case of Irish humour ; he spoke of the humour of the soil which found its noblest utterance in the bull . Humour depended largely on contrast . There was a humour of form and expression which had many local varieties . American humour had been characterized by exaggeration , the suppression of some link in the chain of argument or narrative , and a wealth of simile and metaphor which had been justly defined as the poetry of a pioneer race . "
47082	47175	47182	47182	she	323	" In England there was a near kinship between laughter and tears ; their mental relations were as close as their physical . Abroad this did not appear to be the case . It was different in France . But perhaps on the whole it would be better to leave the humour of France and what some people still unhappily chose to regard as matters open to controversy — he referred to choice of subject — out of their discussion altogether . ( ' Hear , hear , ' and cheers . ) "
47193	47207	47704	47704	he	286	hairpin—"It was noticeable that the pun to a great extent had become démodé .... "
47698	47703	47704	47704	he	286	" Hullo , Magsy ! "
47707	47734	47746	47746	Marjorie	323	" They 've given me a thumping Press . I 'm nearer swelled head than I 've ever been , so mind how you touch me ! "
47735	47744	47746	47746	Marjorie	323	" We 'll take it down at croquet , "
47748	47756	47769	47769	she	323	" They 've cleared that thing away ? "
47757	47768	47779	47779	he	286	" And made up the lawn like a billiard table , "
47772	47778	47779	47779	he	286	" That makes for skill , "
47783	47792	47921	47922	Mr. Magnet	286	" I shall save my head after all . "
47898	47919	47998	47998	he	286	" It 's a pleasant feeling to think that a lot of good fellows think you are a good fellow , "
47988	47997	47998	47998	he	286	" I 've got something in my pocket , "
48004	48007	48037	48037	he	286	" Guess . "
48025	48036	48037	48037	he	286	" I want you to see it before anyone else , "
48040	48059	48140	48140	she	323	" Then if you do n't like it , it can go back . It 's a sapphire . "
48133	48139	48158	48171	those artistic women who are reviving and improving upon the rich old Roman designs	1855	" It's — awfully pretty , "
48173	48180	48234	48234	him	286	" It 's so beautifully made . "
48181	48196	48234	48234	him	286	" I 'm so glad you like it . You really do like it ? "
48197	48204	48158	48171	those artistic women who are reviving and improving upon the rich old Roman designs	1855	" I do n't deserve it . "
48205	48214	48234	48234	him	286	" Oh ! But you do like it ? "
48215	48218	48234	48234	him	286	" Enormously . "
48219	48230	48240	48240	she	323	" Ah ! I spent an hour in choosing it . "
48246	48272	48240	48240	she	323	" Only I do n't deserve it , Mr. Magnet . Indeed I do n't . I feel I am taking it on false pretences . "
48273	48288	48296	48296	she	323	" Nonsense , Magsy . Nonsense ! Slip it on your finger , girl . "
48289	48295	48324	48324	she	323	" But I do n't , "
48320	48323	48324	48324	she	323	" No ! "
48327	48348	48358	48358	he	286	" I feel like a cheat . You know , I don't — I'm sure I do n't love — — "
48349	48357	48371	48371	he	286	" I 'll love enough for two , "
48367	48370	48371	48371	he	286	" No ! "
48377	48388	48461	48462	Mr. Pope	246	" you 'll wear it . Why should n't you ? "
48456	48459	48507	48507	Theodore	259	" Pish ! "
48500	48505	48533	48533	he	374	" Hoo - Ray ! "
48528	48532	48533	48533	he	374	" I hope , "
48540	48571	48589	48589	he	374	" I do n't invade you . But Solomonson is frightfully concerned and anxious about your lawn , and whether his men cleared it up properly and put things right . "
48583	48588	48612	48613	Mr. Pope	246	" How are you ? "
48597	48610	48612	48613	Mr. Pope	246	" Well , we seem to have got our croquet lawn back , "
48615	48627	48635	48635	Trafford	374	" And our nerves are recovering . How is Sir Rupert ? "
48628	48633	48653	48654	Mrs. Pope	264	" A little fractious , "
48644	48651	48667	48667	Trafford	374	" You 'll take some tea ? "
48661	48665	48684	48684	he	374	" Thank you , "
48673	48683	48684	48684	he	374	" I saw your jolly address in the Standard , "
48689	48701	48708	48709	Mrs. Pope	264	" I have n't read anything so amusing for some time . "
48702	48706	48708	48709	Mrs. Pope	264	" Rom dear , "
48711	48724	48863	48863	he	246	" will you take the pot in and get some fresh tea ? "
48854	48862	48863	48863	he	246	" I 'm no lover of machines , "
48874	48944	49008	49008	he	246	" All our troubles began with villainous saltpetre . I 'm an old - fashioned man with a nose — and a neck , and I do n't want the one offended or the other broken . No , do n't ask me to be interested in your valves and cylinders . What do you say , Magnet ? It starts machinery in my head to hear about them .... "
48998	49007	49008	49008	he	246	" Who 's for a game of tennis ? "
49011	49041	49069	49070	Mr. Pope	246	" in this last uncontaminated patch of air ? I and Marjorie will give you a match , Daffy — if Magnet is n't too tired to join you . "
49050	49067	49161	49161	he	246	" We 'll want you , Theodore , to look after the balls in the potatoes , "
49155	49160	49171	49172	Mrs. Pope	264	" Jolly tennis looks , "
49164	49169	49171	49172	Mrs. Pope	264	" Do n't they ? "
49174	49187	49215	49215	she	264	" I think it is such a graceful game for a girl . "
49203	49214	49215	49215	she	264	" They both like it and play it so well , "
49218	49242	49171	49172	Mrs. Pope	264	" Their father is so skillful and interested in games . Marjorie tells me you were her examiner a year or so ago . "
49243	49256	49266	49267	Mrs. Pope	264	" Yes . She struck my memory — her work stood out . "
49257	49264	49266	49267	Mrs. Pope	264	" Of course she is clever , "
49269	49311	49171	49172	Mrs. Pope	264	" Or we should n't have sent her to Oxbridge . There she 's doing quite well — quite well . Everyone says so . I do n't know , of course , if Mr. Magnet will let her finish there . "
49312	49316	49358	49358	Her	264	" Mr. Magnet ? "
49317	49357	49388	49388	she	264	" She 's just engaged to him . Of course she 's frightfully excited about it , and naturally he wants her to come away and marry . There 's very little excuse for a long engagement . No . "
49380	49387	49430	49430	he	365	" They 've got new balls , "
49415	49429	49430	49430	he	365	" Is n't it rather a waste not to finish a university career ? "
49433	49573	49707	49707	he	365	" Oh , it would n't be wasted . Of course a girl like that will be hand and glove with her husband . She 'll be able to help him with the scientific side of his jokes and all that . I sometimes wish it had been Daffy who had gone to college though . I sometimes think we 've sacrificed Daffy a little . She 's not the bright quickness of Marjorie , but there 's something quietly solid about her mind — something stable . Perhaps I did n't want her to go away from me .... Mr. Magnet is doing wonders at the net . He 's just begun to play — to please Marjorie . Do n't you think he 's a dreadfully amusing man , Mr. Trafford ? He says such quiet things . "
49692	49706	49731	49731	He	365	" What the deuce is the good of all this talk of Eugenics , "
49712	49730	49731	49731	He	365	" if they are going to hand over that shining girl to that beastly little area sneak ? "
49736	49742	50160	50160	Marjorie	323	" beastly little area sneak ! "
50148	50154	50342	50342	Daffy	258	" beastly little area sneak . "
50347	50352	50392	50392	he	1876	" She plays next ! "
50395	50407	50449	50449	Magnet	286	" I say , are you engaged to that chap Magnet ? "
50440	50444	50457	50457	she	323	" Punish him ! "
50453	50456	50480	50480	Marjorie	323	" Yes , "
50476	50479	50525	50525	Trafford	365	" Why ? "
50513	50523	50612	50612	he	365	" I 'm sorry if I 've annoyed you , "
50608	50611	50638	50638	Marjorie	323	" Partner , "
50615	50637	50672	50672	she	323	" will you play out my ball for me ? I ca n't go on . I shall have to go . "
50664	50671	50708	50708	she	323	" Is that the heavier mallet ? "
50691	50707	50724	50724	Marjorie	323	" Mr. Trafford , you 're one of the worst examiners I 've ever met , "
50715	50722	50724	50724	Marjorie	323	" I do n't know why , "
50726	50737	50873	50873	he	365	" I wonder as much as you . But I am "
50877	50881	50887	50887	he	365	" clearing up . "
50882	50886	50887	50887	he	365	" I want , "
50890	50895	50873	50873	he	365	" to clear up . "
50896	50909	50921	50921	Trafford	365	" But what is there to clear up , my dear boy ? "
50910	50919	50943	50943	Solomonson	364	" Solomonson , you 're a pampered plutocrat , "
50929	50941	50966	50966	Trafford	365	" I do n't see any sense in it at all , "
50957	50964	50996	50996	Solomonson	364	" I 'm going to stay , "
50986	50994	51010	51010	he	364	" There 's some girl in this , "
50998	51009	51158	51159	Mr. Pope	246	" Your bedroom 's always waiting for you at Riplings , "
51169	51186	51196	51196	she	264	" What the devil that — that chauffeur chap meant by always calling in the afternoon . "
51187	51195	51196	51196	she	264	" Now that Will Magnet monopolizes Marjorie , "
51209	51227	51246	51246	he	246	" I do n't see why Daffy should n't have a little company of her own age . "
51237	51245	51246	51246	he	246	" I did n't think of that , "
51249	51261	51272	51273	Mrs. Pope	264	" But , anyhow , I do n't like the fellow . "
51262	51270	51272	51273	Mrs. Pope	264	" He seems to be rather clever , "
51275	51301	51314	51315	Mr. Pope	246	" though he certainly talks too much . And after all it was Sir Rupert 's aeroplane . He was only driving it to oblige . "
51302	51312	51672	51672	Theodorese	381	" He 'll think twice before he drives another , "
51660	51663	51886	51888	Mr. Maurice Hewlett	382	" suck up "
51880	51884	52176	52176	he	365	" The Forest Lovers "
52171	52175	52176	52176	he	365	" I say , "
52180	52190	52196	52196	she	323	" I want to talk with you — badly . "
52191	52195	52196	52196	she	323	" And I , "
52200	52204	52176	52176	he	365	" with you . "
52205	52210	52176	52176	he	365	" How can we ? "
52211	52222	52196	52196	she	323	" There 's always people about . It 's absurd . "
52223	52230	52176	52176	he	365	" We 'll have to meet . "
52231	52234	52260	52260	She	323	" Yes . "
52235	52259	52270	52270	she	323	" I have to go away to - morrow . I ought to have gone two days ago . Where can we meet ? "
52266	52269	52270	52270	she	323	" Listen , "
52273	52294	52295	52295	He	365	" There is a path runs from our shrubbery through a little wood to a stile on the main road . "
52298	52335	52395	52396	Mrs. Pope	264	" Either I will be there at three or about half - past five or — there 's one more chance . While father and Mr. Magnet are smoking at nine .... I might get away . "
52336	52342	52295	52295	He	365	" Could n't I write ? "
52343	52348	52360	52361	Mrs. Pope	264	" No . Impossible . "
52349	52359	52381	52381	he	365	" I 've no end of things to say .... "
52376	52380	52392	52392	he	365	" All right , "
52386	52391	52625	52625	he	1929	" I 'm shopping , "
52620	52624	52625	52625	he	1929	" My darling , "
52628	52634	52677	52677	he	1929	" Oh , my darling ! "
52669	52676	52677	52677	he	1929	" I will die for you , "
52680	52690	52861	52861	he	1929	" I will give all the world for you .... "
52856	52860	52861	52861	he	1929	" Good God ! "
52864	52868	52882	52882	he	1929	" what next ! "
52878	52881	52882	52882	he	1929	" Daffy , "
52885	52895	52911	52911	he	1929	" what in the name of goodness — — ? "
52906	52910	52911	52911	he	1929	" Good Lord ! "
52918	52923	52924	52924	Trafford	365	" it 's Madge ! "
52930	52936	52955	52955	he	246	" I should explain — — "
52949	52954	52955	52955	he	246	" You damned scoundrel ! "
52958	52966	52986	52986	he	1929	" What the devil are you doing ? "
52979	52985	53129	53129	he	365	" My poor misguided girl ! "
53118	53128	53142	53143	Mr. Pope	246	" I asked your daughter to meet me here , "
53132	53140	53142	53143	Mr. Pope	246	" Be off with you , sir ! "
53145	53154	53171	53171	Trafford	365	" Do n't tempt me further , sir , "
53186	53210	53225	53225	Marjorie	323	" I asked your daughter to meet me here , and she came . I am prepared to give you any explanation — — "
53211	53221	53251	53251	she	323	" If you come near this place again — — "
53246	53250	53251	53251	she	323	" Mr. Trafford , "
53254	53268	53281	53281	he	246	" will you go . Go now . Nothing shall keep us apart ! "
53275	53280	53296	53296	Trafford	365	" Silence , girl ! "
53284	53294	53303	53303	Marjorie	323	" I shall come to you to - morrow , "
53298	53301	53303	53303	Marjorie	323	" Yes , "
53305	53310	53316	53317	Mr. Pope	246	" to - morrow . "
53311	53314	53316	53317	Mr. Pope	246	" Marjorie ! "
53319	53325	53303	53303	Marjorie	323	" will you go indoors . "
53326	53333	53316	53317	Mr. Pope	246	" I have done nothing — — "
53334	53340	53316	53317	Mr. Pope	246	" Be off , sir . "
53341	53348	53368	53368	He	246	" I have done nothing — — "
53349	53367	53438	53438	he	246	" Will you be off , sir ? And you , Marjorie — will you go indoors ? "
53431	53437	53521	53521	he	246	" Be off , sir , "
53517	53520	53935	53936	Mr. Pope	246	" Well ! "
53878	53881	53923	53923	she	1949	" tact , "

54263	54272	54325	54326	Mrs. Pope	264	" Damned scoundrel ! Get out of this ! "
54274	54284	54236	54236	He	246	" My daughter and degrade yourself in this way ! "
54286	54295	54325	54326	Mrs. Pope	264	" Never let me see your face again ! "
54296	54323	54937	54937	Daffy	258	" Plight your troth to one man , and fling yourself shamelessly — I repeat it , Marjorie , shamelessly — into the arms of another ! "
54926	54936	55059	55059	she	323	" I suppose you could n't leave him alone , "
55053	55058	55059	55059	she	323	" I love him , "
55063	55085	55104	55104	she	323	" I would die for him . I would like to lie under his feet — and him not know it . "
55096	55103	55351	55351	he	1976	" Not know it until afterwards , "
55346	55350	55380	55380	He	1976	" Of course , "
55363	55379	55380	55380	He	1976	" she had to explain about the Magnet affair . Ca n't one — converse ? "
55386	55401	55351	55351	he	1976	" I will see her ! Why on earth should n't I see her ? "
55402	55412	55424	55424	He	1976	" I suppose they ca n't lock her up ! "
55436	55454	55876	55876	she	264	" Can any one get a writ of Habeas Corpus for any one — it does n't matter whom"—more

55891	55900	55912	55913	Mrs. Pope	264	" I thought I heard father telling you , "
55904	55910	55912	55913	Mrs. Pope	264	" He was too indignant , "
55915	55923	55876	55876	she	264	" to explain clearly . You see , Marjorie"—she

55937	55941	55943	55943	Marjorie	323	" What things ? "
55948	55963	55988	55988	Marjorie	323	" I do n't know , my dear — and I ca n't imagine . "
55979	55986	55988	55988	Marjorie	323	" I do n't believe it , "
55990	55998	56014	56015	Mrs. Pope	264	" Do n't believe what , dear ? "
55999	56004	56014	56015	Mrs. Pope	264	" Whatever he says . "
56005	56012	56026	56026	she	264	" I wish I did n't , "
56020	56025	56026	56026	she	264	" Oh , Madge , "
56029	56129	56152	56152	she	264	" you can not imagine how all this distresses me ! I cannot — I can not conceive how you came to be in such a position ! Surely honour — — ! Think of Mr. Magnet , how good and patient he has been ! You do n't know that man . You do n't know all he is , and all that it means to a girl . He is good and honourable and — pure . He is kindness itself . It seemed to me that you were to be so happy — rich , honoured . "
56148	56151	56152	56152	she	264	" There ! "
56156	56166	56186	56186	she	264	" It 's all ruined , shattered , gone . "
56178	56185	56186	56186	she	264	" If father had n't interfered , "
56190	56232	56237	56237	her	264	" Oh , do n't , my dear , speak so coldly of your father ! You do n't know what he has to put up with . You do n't know his troubles and anxieties — all this wretched business . "
56242	56286	56309	56309	she	323	" Marjorie , do you know if these railways go on as they are going he may have to eat into his capital this year . Just think of that , and the worry he has ! And this last shame and anxiety ! "
56302	56308	56309	56309	she	323	" But what is it , "
56312	56320	56287	56287	Her	264	" that father knows about Mr. Trafford ? "
56321	56347	56287	56287	Her	264	" I do n't know , dear . I do n't know . But it 's something that matters — that makes it all different . "
56348	56362	56465	56465	her	1998	" Well , may I speak to Mr. Trafford before he leaves Buryhamstreet ? "
56363	56416	56428	56428	she	1998	" My dear ! Never see him , dear — never think of him again ! Your father would not dream —— Some day , Marjorie , you will rejoice — you will want to thank your father on your bended knees that he saved you from the clutches of this man .... "
56417	56427	56428	56428	she	1998	" I wo n't believe anything about Mr. Trafford , "
56432	56438	56458	56458	she	1998	" until I know — — "
56451	56457	56458	56458	she	1998	" I love Mr. Trafford , "
56468	56477	56526	56526	she	264	" and I do n't love Mr. Magnet . "
56517	56525	56526	56526	she	264	" It 's too dreadful ! Marjorie , "
56529	56634	56640	56640	Marjorie	323	" I want to ask you to do something . After all , a mother has some claim . Will you wait just a little . Will you promise me to do nothing — nothing , I mean , to commit you — until your father has been able to make inquiries . Do n't see him for a little while . Very soon you 'll be one - and - twenty , and then perhaps things may be different . If he cares for you , and you for him , a little separation wo n't matter .... Until your father has inquired .... "
56635	56638	56640	56640	Marjorie	323	" Mother , "
56642	56648	56649	56650	Mrs. Pope	264	" I ca n't — — "
56665	56700	56707	56708	Mrs. Pope	264	" But , mother —— Mother , I must let Mr. Trafford know that I 'm not to see him . I ca n't suddenly cease .... If I could see him once — — "
56701	56705	56726	56726	she	323	" Do n't ! "
56719	56725	56726	56726	she	323	" He 'd not understand , "
56729	56738	56746	56746	Marjorie	323	" If I might just speak to him ! "
56739	56745	56746	56746	Marjorie	323	" Not alone , Marjorie . "
56750	56756	56771	56771	she	264	" Well — before you . "
56763	56770	56785	56785	Marjorie	323	" And then , Marjorie — — "
56774	56783	56794	56794	she	323	" I 'd keep my word , mother , "
56799	56815	56827	56827	she	264	childish—"until — until I am one - and - twenty . I 'd promise that . "
56823	56826	56827	56827	she	264	" Marjorie , "
56830	56840	56847	56847	Marjorie	323	" it 's only your happiness I think of . "
56841	56845	56847	56847	Marjorie	323	" I know , "
56856	56860	56794	56794	she	323	" and father . "
56861	56967	56794	56794	she	323	" My dear , you do n't understand your father .... I believe — I do firmly believe — if anything happened to any of you girls — anything bad — he would kill himself .... And I know he means that you are n't to go about so much as you used to do , unless we have the most definite promises . Of course , your father 's ideas are n't always my ideas , Marjorie ; but it 's your duty — You know how hasty he is and — quick . Just as you know how good and generous and kind he is"—she
56977	56980	56982	56982	She	323	lamely—"at bottom . "
56985	57012	57031	57031	she	323	" I think I could get him to let you say just one word with Mr. Trafford . It would be very difficult , but — — "
57027	57030	57031	57031	she	323	" Marjorie , "
57034	57044	56982	56982	She	323	" Mr. Magnet must never know anything of this . "
57045	57052	56982	56982	She	323	" But , mother — — ! "
57053	57056	56982	56982	She	323	" Nothing ! "
57057	57067	57071	57071	her	264	" I ca n't go on with my engagement ! "
57075	57083	56982	56982	She	323	" But how can I , mother ? "
57084	57094	56982	56982	She	323	" You need not tell him why , Marjorie . "
57095	57099	57146	57146	Marjorie	323	" But — — "
57100	57145	57146	57146	Marjorie	323	" Just think how it would humiliate and distress him ! You ca n't , Marjorie . You must find some excuse — oh , any excuse ! But not the truth — not the truth , Marjorie . It would be too dreadful . "
57149	57169	56982	56982	She	323	" Look here , mother , I may see Mr. Trafford again ? I may really speak to him ? "
57170	57176	57189	57189	Marjorie	323	" Have n't I promised ? "
57177	57187	57219	57219	she	264	" Then , I 'll do as you say , "
57210	57218	57219	57219	she	264	" I 've been talking to her , "
57222	57232	57241	57242	Mr. Pope	246	" She 's in a state of terrible distress . "
57233	57239	57241	57242	Mr. Pope	246	" She ought to be , "
57244	57253	57219	57219	she	264	" Philip , you do n't understand Marjorie . "
57254	57259	57241	57242	Mr. Pope	246	" I do n't . "
57260	57269	57241	57242	Mr. Pope	246	" You think she was kissing that man . "
57270	57276	57219	57219	she	264	" Well , she was . "
57277	57285	57289	57289	his	246	" You can think that of her ! "
57294	57299	57303	57303	her	264	" But I saw ! "
57306	57410	57300	57301	Mrs. Pope	264	" She was n't ; she was struggling to get away from him . She told me so herself . I 've been into it with her . You do n't understand , Philip . A man like that has a sort of fascination for a girl . He dazzles her . It 's the way with girls . But you 're quite mistaken .... Quite . It 's a sort of hypnotism . She 'll grow out of it . Of course , she loves Mr. Magnet . She does indeed . I 've not a doubt of it . But — — "
57411	57421	57300	57301	Mrs. Pope	264	" You 're sure she was n't kissing him ? "
57422	57425	57303	57303	her	264	" Positive . "
57426	57435	57300	57301	Mrs. Pope	264	" Then why did n't you say so ? "
57436	57475	57300	57301	Mrs. Pope	264	" A girl 's so complex . You did n't give her a chance . She 's fearfully ashamed of herself — fearfully ! but it 's just because she is ashamed that she wo n't admit it . "
57476	57484	57496	57497	Mrs. Pope	264	" I 'll make her admit it . "
57485	57494	57496	57497	Mrs. Pope	264	" You ought to have had all boys , "
57499	57540	57553	57553	She	264	" Oh ! she 'll admit it some day — readily enough . But I believe a girl of her spirit would rather die than begin explaining . You ca n't expect it of her . Really you ca n't . "
57565	57595	57600	57600	he	2001	" I want to know just exactly what we are to do about the girl , Philip . I ca n't bear to think of her — up there . "
57596	57599	57600	57600	he	2001	" How ? "
57603	57607	57612	57612	she	264	" Up there ? "
57608	57611	57643	57643	she	264	" Yes , "
57630	57642	57656	57657	Mr. Pope	246	" Do you think that man means to come here again ? "
57646	57654	57682	57682	she	264	" Chuck him out if he does , "
57676	57681	57695	57696	Mr. Pope	246	" I would n't , "
57687	57693	57695	57696	Mr. Pope	246	" What do you mean ? "
57698	57713	57668	57668	She	264	" I do not want you to make an open quarrel with Mr. Trafford . "
57714	57718	57727	57728	Mrs. Pope	264	" Not quarrel ! "
57719	57725	57727	57728	Mrs. Pope	264	" Not an open one , "
57730	57869	58304	58305	Mrs. Pope	264	" Of course I know how nice it would be if you could use a horsewhip , dear . There 's such a lot of things — if we only just slash . But — it wo n't help . Get him to go away . She 's consented never to see him again — practically . She 's ready to tell him so herself . Part them against their will — oh ! and the thing may go on for no end of time . But treat it as it ought to be treated — She'll be very tragic for a week or so , and then she 'll forget him like a dream . He is a dream — a girl 's dream .... If only we leave it alone , she 'll leave it alone . "
58295	58302	58311	58311	She	264	" Is n't it charmingly rural ? "
58307	58310	58408	58408	she	264	" Bats ! "
58399	58407	58459	58460	Mr. Pope	246	" You wish to see my husband ? "
58452	58457	58459	58460	Mr. Pope	246	" Well , sir , "
58465	58475	58614	58615	Mr. Pope	246	" you have come to offer some explanation — — "
58630	58636	58658	58659	Mr. Pope	246	" Be seated , sir . "
58664	58667	58614	58615	Mr. Pope	246	" Well ? "
58668	58679	58690	58691	Mr. Pope	246	" I am in love sir , with your daughter . "
58680	58688	58734	58734	His	246	" I am not aware of it , "
58702	58733	58734	58734	His	246	" My daughter , sir , is engaged to marry Mr. Magnet . If you had approached me in a proper fashion before presuming to attempt — to attempt — — "
58738	58757	58772	58772	Bump	390	indignation,—"Liberties with her , you would have been duly informed of her position — and everyone would have been saved"—he
58764	58770	58793	58793	he	365	" Everything that has happened . "
58789	58792	58801	58802	Mr. Pope	246	" Oh ! "
58796	58799	58823	58824	Mr. Trafford	365	" Yes , "
58811	58821	58831	58832	Mr. Pope	246	" Is your daughter in love with Mr. Magnet ? "
58836	58843	58856	58858	the young man	1707	" I presume so , sir . "
58844	58854	58877	58878	Mr. Pope	246	" She never gave me that impression , anyhow , "
58860	58875	58903	58904	Mr. Pope	246	" It was neither her duty to give nor yours to receive that impression , "
58888	58901	58962	58962	he	246	" Have you come here , sir , merely to bandy words ? "
58949	58961	58962	58962	he	246	" Look here , sir , this is all very well , "
58965	59017	59026	59027	Mr. Pope	246	" but why ca n't I fall in love with your daughter ? I 'm a Doctor of Science and all that sort of thing . I 've a perfectly decent outlook . My father was rather a swell in his science . I 'm an entirely decent and respectable person . "
59018	59024	59026	59027	Mr. Pope	246	" I beg to differ , "
59029	59034	59040	59041	Mr. Pope	246	" But I am . "
59035	59038	59040	59041	Mr. Pope	246	" Again , "
59056	59062	59075	59075	He	246	" I beg to differ . "
59063	59074	59110	59111	Mr. Pope	246	" Well — differ . But all the same — — "
59113	59120	59158	59158	Trafford	365	" to cut all this short , "
59151	59157	59201	59201	he	246	of—"if possible by peaceful means . "
59186	59200	59307	59307	he	246	" She is as anxious as any one to end this intolerable siege , "
59298	59306	59307	59307	he	246	" Mr. Trafford has to be told , "
59310	59320	59351	59351	he	246	" that you do n't want him in Buryhamstreet . "
59347	59350	59371	59371	Marjorie	323	" Well ? "
59354	59369	59351	59351	he	246	" I do n't think you ought to stay in Buryhamstreet , Mr. Trafford , "
59373	59381	59423	59423	she	323	" You do n't want me to ? "
59382	59392	59423	59423	she	323	" It will only cause trouble — and scenes . "
59393	59400	59351	59351	he	246	" You want me to go ? "
59401	59406	59414	59414	Marjorie	323	" Away from here . "
59407	59413	59444	59444	she	323	" You really mean that ? "
59439	59443	59444	59444	she	323	" Mr. Trafford , "
59447	59471	59496	59496	he	365	" everything I 've ever said to you — everything — I've meant , more than I 've ever meant anything . Everything ! "
59491	59495	59496	59496	he	365	" Oh well , "
59499	59516	59618	59618	Trafford	365	" I do n't understand . But I 'm entirely in your hands , of course . "
59606	59616	59618	59618	Trafford	365	" I 'll do anything you want me to , "
59620	59628	59634	59635	Mr. Pope	246	" Then I want you to go . "
59629	59632	59642	59642	Trafford	365	" Ah ! "
59637	59640	59642	59642	Trafford	365	" Yes , "
59653	59689	59645	59645	his	365	" I 've promised not to write or send to you , or — think more than I can help of you , until I 'm twenty - one — nearly two months from now . "
59690	59694	59645	59645	his	365	" And then ? "
59695	59705	59714	59715	Mr. Pope	246	" I do n't know . How can I ? "
59706	59712	59732	59733	Mr. Trafford	365	" You hear , sir ? "
59726	59730	59746	59747	Mr. Pope	246	" One question , "
59735	59744	59746	59747	Mr. Pope	246	" You 've surely asked enough , sir , "
59749	59757	59769	59769	Marjorie	323	" Are you still engaged to Magnet ? "
59758	59761	59769	59769	Marjorie	323	" Sir ! "
59762	59767	59769	59769	Marjorie	323	" Please , father ; "
59781	59799	59810	59811	Mr. Pope	246	" Mr. Trafford , after what I 've told you — you must leave that to me . "
59800	59808	59810	59811	Mr. Pope	246	" She is engaged to Mr. Magnet , "
59813	59824	59833	59833	Trafford	365	" Tell him outright , Marjorie . Make it clear . "
59825	59831	59854	59854	Marjorie	323	" I think I understand , "
59841	59852	59854	59854	Marjorie	323	" I 've not seen Mr. Magnet since last night , "
59856	59868	59874	59875	Mr. Pope	246	" And so — naturally — I'm still engaged to him . "
59869	59872	59912	59913	Mr. Pope	246	" Precisely ! "
59898	59910	60002	60002	he	246	" I do n't think we need detain you , Madge , "
59994	60001	60021	60022	Mr. Trafford	365	" I hope that satisfies you , "
60005	60019	60029	60030	Mr. Pope	246	" There is nothing more to be said at present , I admit , "
60024	60027	60101	60102	Mr. Pope	246	" Nothing , "
60092	60099	60118	60119	Mr. Trafford	365	" Good - bye , sir , "

65024	65030	65065	65065	he	365	" Where have you been ? "
65068	65091	65145	65145	she	970	" I wonder , mother , if it would put you out very much if I brought home a wife to you ? "
65126	65144	65178	65178	she	970	" I 'd be glad for you to do it , dear — if you loved her , "
65173	65177	65262	65262	he	365	" My dear , "
65248	65261	65262	65262	he	365	" It 's so hard , mother , to explain these things , "
65265	65305	65237	65237	he	365	" One does n't half understand the things that are happening to one . I want to make you in love with her , dear , just as I am . And I do n't see how I can . "
65306	65324	65381	65381	She	2176	" Perhaps I shall understand , my dear . Perhaps I shall understand better than you think . "
65325	65380	65393	65393	she	2176	" She 's such a beautiful thing — with something about her——. You know those steel blades you can bend back to the hilt — and they 're steel ! And she 's tender . It 's as if someone had taken tears , mother , and made a spirit out of them — — "
65388	65392	65393	65393	she	2176	" My dear , "
65396	65400	65381	65381	She	2176	" I know . "
65401	65412	65417	65417	she	2176	" And a sort of dancing daring in her eyes . "
65413	65416	65417	65417	she	2176	" Yes , "
65420	65448	65879	65879	he	2177	" But tell me where she comes from , and how you met her — and all the circumstantial things that a sensible old woman can understand . "
65869	65878	65879	65879	he	2177	" You 'll live with us , mother ? "
65883	65919	65983	65983	her	2193	" Not with you . As near as you like . But one house , one woman .... I 'll have a little flat of my own — for you both to come to me . "
65920	65940	65983	65983	her	2193	" Oh , nonsense , mother ! You 'll have to be with us . Living alone , indeed ! "
65941	65972	65998	65998	she	2193	" My dear , I 'd prefer a flat of my own . You do n't understand — everything . It will be better for all of us like that . "
65991	65997	65998	65998	she	2193	" Oh , my dear , "
66001	66090	66557	66557	he	2197	" I want you to be happy . And life can be difficult . I wo n't give a chance — for things to go wrong . You 're hers , dear , and you 've got to be hers — be each other 's altogether . I 've watched so many people . And that 's the best , the very best you can have . There 's just the lovers — the real enduring lovers ; and the uncompleted people who 've failed to find it . "
66547	66556	66565	66565	she	323	" I do n't like this underhand preparation , "
66560	66564	66565	66565	she	323	" Nor I , "
66568	66575	66557	66557	he	2197	" But what can one do ? "
66576	66604	66616	66616	Marjorie	323	" Well , ought n't I to go to your father and give him a chance ? Why should n't I ? It's — the dignified way . "
66605	66614	66616	66616	Marjorie	323	" It wo n't be dignified for father , "
66618	66621	66557	66557	he	2197	" anyhow . "
66622	66631	66557	66557	he	2197	" But what right has he to object ? "
66632	66648	66557	66557	he	2197	" He is n't going to discuss his rights with you . He will object . "
66649	66653	66557	66557	he	2197	" But why ? "
66654	66748	66758	66758	Trafford	394	" Oh ! because he 's started that way . He hit you . I have n't forgotten it . Well , if he goes back on that now —— He'd rather die than go back on it . You see , he 's ashamed in his heart . It would be like confessing himself wrong not to keep it up that you 're the sort of man one hits . He just hates you because he hit you . I have n't been his daughter for twenty - one years for nothing . "
66749	66756	66758	66758	Trafford	394	" I 'm thinking of us , "
66760	66782	66557	66557	he	2197	" I do n't see we ought n't to go to him just because he 's likely to be — unreasonable . "
66783	66811	66557	66557	he	2197	" My dear , do as you please . He 'll forbid and shout , and hit tables until things break . Suppose he locks me up ! "
66812	66838	66557	66557	he	2197	" Oh , Habeas Corpus , and my strong right arm ! He 's much more likely to turn you out - of - doors . "
66839	66859	66557	66557	he	2197	" Not if he thinks the other will annoy you more . I 'll have to bear a storm . "
66860	66865	66557	66557	he	2197	" Not for long . "
66866	66912	66928	66928	he	2206	" He 'll bully mother till she cries over me . But do as you please . She 'll come and she 'll beg me —— Do as you please . Perhaps I 'm a coward . I 'd far rather I could slip away . "
66919	66927	66954	66954	she	2208	" I 'd far rather you could , "
66950	66953	66954	66954	she	2208	" Italy ! "
66957	66960	67031	67031	he	2206	" Italy ! "
67020	67030	67060	67060	she	2208	" You understand I shall come to your father , "
67049	67059	67060	67060	she	2208	" It will make it harder to get away , "
67068	67082	67139	67139	she	2208	" It wo n't stop us . Oh ! do as you please . "
67135	67138	67157	67157	She	2208	" Oh ! "
67142	67156	67169	67169	she	2208	" of course , you wo n't tell father you 've seen me . "
67162	67168	67169	67169	she	2208	" Really you must n't , "
67172	67237	67243	67243	She	2208	" You see — he'll make a row with mother for not having watched me better . I do n't know what he is n't likely to do . It is n't myself —— This is a confidential communication — all this . No one in this world knows I am meeting you . If you must go to him , go to him . "
67238	67242	67289	67289	he	2206	" For myself ? "
67284	67288	67305	67305	she	2208	" All right , "
67292	67304	67321	67321	he	2206	" You do n't think that I 'm shirking — — ? "
67313	67320	67321	67321	he	2206	" You know your father best , "
67324	67344	67977	67979	the young gentleman	2242	" I 'll tell you all he says and all the terror of him here to - morrow afternoon . "
67972	67975	67983	67983	Trafford	394	" Blow ! "
67987	67992	67998	67998	Theodore	259	" Hullo , Theodore ! "
67993	67996	67998	67998	Theodore	259	" Lord ! "
68001	68046	68089	68092	A pseudo - twin	2243	" It 's you ! What a lark ! Your name 's never mentioned — no how . What did you do ? ... Wish I could stop and see it ! I 'm ten minutes late . Ave atque vale . So long ! "
68096	68099	68147	68147	Trafford	365	" Hello ! "
68164	68168	68422	68422	he	246	" ring also . "
68416	68421	68422	68422	he	246	" Well , sir , "
68431	68441	68460	68460	he	246	" to what may I ascribe this — intrusion ? "
68453	68459	68496	68496	he	246	" Will you be seated , "
68490	68495	68518	68518	he	246	" Well , sir ? "
68511	68517	68518	68518	he	246	" Look here , sir , "
68521	68548	68557	68557	He	365	" I am in love with your daughter . She 's one and twenty , and I want to see her — and in fact — — "
68568	68582	68518	68518	he	246	" I want — in fact — to pay my addresses to her . "
68583	68653	68675	68676	Mr. Pope	246	" Well , sir , I do n't want you to do so . That is too mild . I object strongly — very strongly . My daughter has been engaged to a very distinguished and able man , and I hope very shortly to hear that that engagement — — Practically it is still going on . I do n't want you to intrude upon my daughter further . "
68654	68674	68675	68676	Mr. Pope	246	" But look here , sir . There 's a certain justice — I mean a certain reasonableness — — "
68683	68695	68518	68518	he	246	" I do n't wish it . Let that be enough . "
68696	68726	68518	68518	he	246	" Of course it is n't enough . I 'm in love with her — and she with me . I 'm an entirely reputable and decent person — — "
68727	68759	68675	68676	Mr. Pope	246	" May I be allowed to judge what is or is not suitable companionship for my daughter — and what may or may not be the present state of her affections ? "
68760	68811	68518	68518	he	246	" Well , that 's rather the point we are discussing . After all , Marjorie is n't a baby . I want to do all this — this affair , openly and properly if I can , but , you know , I mean to marry Marjorie — anyhow . "
68812	68823	68518	68518	he	246	" There are two people to consult in that matter . "
68824	68833	68675	68676	Mr. Pope	246	" I 'll take the risk of that . "
68834	68840	68885	68885	he	365	" Permit me to differ . "
68871	68884	68885	68885	he	365	" Oh really ! really ! this is — this is nonsense ! "
68888	68902	68911	68912	Mr. Pope	246	" I never heard anything so childish and pointless as your objection — — "
68903	68909	68911	68912	Mr. Pope	246	" Be careful , sir ! "
68914	68918	68885	68885	he	365	" be careful ! "
68919	68927	68911	68912	Mr. Pope	246	" I 'm going to marry Marjorie . "
68928	68944	68911	68912	Mr. Pope	246	" If she marries you , sir , she shall never darken my doors again ! "
68945	68954	68885	68885	he	365	" If you had a thing against me ! "
68955	68960	68911	68912	Mr. Pope	246	" Have n't I ! "
68961	68966	68974	68974	Pope	246	" What have you ? "
68979	69003	69017	69017	he	365	" Does any decent man want the name of Trafford associated with his daughter . Trafford ! Look at the hoardings , sir ! "
69012	69016	69058	69058	he	365	" My God ! "
69046	69057	69058	69058	he	365	" You believe in that libel on my dead father ? "
69065	69072	69150	69150	He	365	" Has it ever been answered ? "
69073	69149	69192	69192	himself	365	" A hundred times . And anyhow!—Confound it ! I do n't believe — you believe it . You 've raked it up — as an excuse ! You want an excuse for your infernal domestic tyranny ! That 's the truth of it . You ca n't bear a creature in your household to have a will or preference of her own . I tell you , sir , you are intolerable — intolerable ! "
69163	69187	69232	69232	Pope	246	" Leave my house , sir . Get out of my house , sir . You come here to insult me , sir ! "
69225	69230	69241	69241	Trafford	365	" Leave my house ! "
69251	69272	69321	69322	Mr. Pope	246	" I am sorry , sir , I lost my temper . I had no business to abuse you — — "
69273	69279	69241	69241	Trafford	365	" You 've said enough . "
69280	69297	69307	69308	Mr. Pope	246	" I apologise for that . I 've done what I could to manage things decently . "
69298	69305	69319	69319	Trafford	365	" Will you go , sir ? "
69310	69317	69345	69345	Trafford	365	" I 'm sorry I came , "
69336	69343	69381	69381	Trafford	365	" I did what I could , "
69375	69379	69381	69381	Trafford	365	" Confound it ! "
69386	69395	69937	69937	he	365	" How on earth did all this happen ? "
69931	69936	69953	69953	she	323	" She 's been ? "
69947	69952	69953	69953	she	323	" She 's been , "
69956	69967	69974	69974	he	365	" Yes , she 's all right , my dear . "
69968	69973	69974	69974	he	365	" Oh , mother ! "
69977	70008	70030	70030	I	0	" She 's a beautiful creature , dear — and such a child ! Oh ! such a child ! And God bless you , dear , God bless you .... "
70037	70544	70550	70551	Mrs. Trafford	394	" He kissed her , and she clung to him as if he were something too precious to release . The elopement was a little complicated by a surprise manœuvre of Mrs. Pope 's . She was more alive to the quality of the situation , poor lady ! than her daughter suspected ; she was watching , dreading , perhaps even furtively sympathizing and trying to arrange — oh ! trying dreadfully to arrange . She had an instinctive understanding of the deep blue quiet in Marjorie 's eyes , and the girl 's unusual tenderness with Daffy and the children . She peeped under the blind as Marjorie went out , noted the care in her dress , watched her face as she returned , never plumbed her with a question for fear of the answer . She did not dare to breathe a hint of her suspicions to her husband , but she felt things were adrift in swift , smooth water , and all her soul cried out for delay . So presently there came a letter from Cousin Susan Pendexter at Plymouth . The weather was beautiful , Marjorie must come at once , pack up and come and snatch the last best glow of the dying autumn away there in the west . Marjorie 's jerry - built excuses , her manifest chagrin and reluctance , confirmed her mother 's worst suspicions . She submitted and went , and Mrs. Pope and Syd saw her off . I do not like to tell how a week later Marjorie explained herself and her dressing - bag and a few small articles back to London from Plymouth . Suffice it that she lied desperately and elaborately . Her mother had never achieved such miracles of mis - statement , and she added a vigour that was all her own . It is easier to sympathize with her than exonerate her . She was in a state of intense impatience , and — what is strange — extraordinarily afraid that something would separate her from her lover if she did not secure him . She was in a fever of determination . She could not eat or sleep or attend to anything whatever ; she was occupied altogether with the thought of assuring herself to Trafford . He towered in her waking vision over town and land and sea . He did n't hear the lies she told ; he only knew she was magnificently coming back to him . He met her at Paddington , a white - faced , tired , splendidly resolute girl , and they went to the waiting registrar 's forthwith . She bore herself with the intentness and dignity of one who is taking the cardinal step in life . They kissed as though it was a symbol , and were keenly business - like about cabs and luggage and trains . At last they were alone in the train together . They stared at one another . "
70553	70631	70550	70551	Mrs. Trafford	394	" said Trafford . She snapped like an over - taut string , crumpled , clung to him , and without a word was weeping passionately in his arms . It surprised him that she could weep as she did , and still more to see her as she walked by his side along the Folkestone pier , altogether recovered , erect , a little flushed and excited like a child . She seemed to miss nothing . "
70638	70642	70732	70732	I	0	" she said , "
70657	70731	70732	70732	I	0	" She watched the luggage spinning on the wire rope of the giant crane , and he watched her face and thought how beautiful she was . He wondered why her eyes could sometimes be so blue and sometimes dark as night . The boat cleared the pier and turned about and headed for France . They walked the upper deck together and stood side by side , she very close to him . "
70740	70744	70732	70732	I	0	" she said . "
70748	70752	70732	70732	I	0	" she whispered . "
70781	70792	70732	70732	I	0	" Presently they went forward and peered into the night . "
70795	70799	71537	71540	Adorable happy young people	2291	" she said . "
70823	70831	71537	71540	Adorable happy young people	2291	" She paused and whispered almost noiselessly : "
70835	70842	71528	71530	Adorable young people	2290	" They pressed against each other . "
70870	71527	71528	71530	Adorable young people	2290	" Italy gave all her best to welcome them . It was a late year , a golden autumn , with skies of such blue as Marjorie had never seen before . They stayed at first in a pretty little Italian hotel with a garden on the lake , and later they walked over Salvator to Morcote and by boat to Ponte Tresa , and thence they had the most wonderful and beautiful tramp in the world to Luino , over the hills by Castelrotto . To the left of them all day was a broad valley with low - lying villages swimming in a luminous mist , to the right were purple mountains . They passed through paved streets with houses the colour of flesh and ivory , with balconies hung with corn and gourds , with tall church campaniles rising high , and great archways giving upon the blue lowlands ; they tramped along avenues of sweet chestnut and between stretches of exuberant vineyard , in which men and women were gathering grapes — purple grapes , a hatful for a soldo , that rasped the tongue . Everything was strange and wonderful to Marjorie 's eyes ; now it would be a wayside shrine and now a yoke of soft - going , dewlapped oxen , now a chapel hung about with ex votos , and now some unfamiliar cultivation — or a gipsy - eyed child — or a scorpion that scuttled in the dust . The very names of the villages were like jewels to her , Varasca , Croglio , Ronca , Sesia , Monteggio . They walked , or sat by the wayside and talked , or rested at the friendly table of some kindly albergo . A woman as beautiful as Ceres , with a white neck all open , made them an omelette , and then fetched her baby from its cradle to nurse it while she talked to them as they made their meal . And afterwards she filled their pockets with roasted chestnuts , and sent them with melodious good wishes upon their way . And always high over all against the translucent blue hung the white shape of Monte Rosa , that warmed in colour as the evening came . Marjorie 's head was swimming with happiness and beauty , and with every fresh delight she recurred again to the crowning marvel of this clean - limbed man beside her , who smiled and carried all her luggage in a huge rucksack that did not seem to exist for him , and watched her and caressed her — and was hers , hers ! At Baveno there were letters . They sat at a little table outside a café and read them , suddenly mindful of England again . Incipient forgiveness showed through Mrs. Pope 's reproaches , and there was also a simple , tender love - letter ( there is no other word for it ) from old Mrs. Trafford to her son . From Baveno they set off up Monte Mottarone — whence one may see the Alps from Visto to Ortler Spitz — trusting to find the inn still open , and if it was closed to get down to Orta somehow before night . Or at the worst sleep upon the mountain side . ( Monte Mottarone ! Just for a moment taste the sweet Italian name upon your lips . ) These were the days before the funicular from Stresa , when one trudged up a rude path through the chestnuts and walnuts . As they ascended the long windings through the woods , they met an old poet and his wife , coming down from sunset and sunrise . There was a word or two about the inn , and they went upon their way . The old man turned ever and again to look at them . "
71532	71536	71537	71540	Adorable happy young people	2291	" he said . "
71542	71560	71537	71540	Adorable happy young people	2291	" Did you notice , dear , how she held that dainty little chin of hers ? ... "
71586	71648	71687	71687	she	323	" Is n't it good , dear , to think that once you and I may have looked like that to some passer - by . I wish I could bless them — sweet , swift young things ! I wish , dear , it was possible for old men to bless young people without seeming to set up for saints .... "
71676	71686	71759	71759	Marjorie	323	" Oh , I ought to have told you , "
71750	71757	71759	71759	Marjorie	323	" Oh , about fifty pounds , "
71765	71791	71800	71800	Trafford	394	" Not more . I 've not kept all the bills ; and some have n't come in . You know how slow they are . "
71792	71798	71759	71759	Marjorie	323	" These things will happen , "
71820	71844	71856	71856	Marjorie	323	" However , you 'll be able to pay as soon as you get home , and get them all off your mind . "
71845	71854	71856	71856	Marjorie	323	" I think fifty pounds will clear me , "
71866	71875	71889	71889	Trafford	394	" if you 'll let me have that . "
71876	71887	71889	71889	Trafford	394	" Oh , we do n't do things like that , "
71891	71936	71947	71947	Marjorie	323	" I 'm arranging that my current account will be a sort of joint account , and your signature will be as good as mine — for the purpose of drawing , at least . You 'll have your own cheque - book — — "
71937	71945	71947	71947	Marjorie	323	" I do n't understand , quite , "

77648	77959	77985	77985	Buzard	416	" They do n't care for these things . They do n't care for art or philosophy , or literature or anything except the things that touch them directly . That 's their peculiar difference . Hunger they understand , and comfort , and personal vanity and desire , furs and chocolate and husbands , and the extreme importance conferred upon them by having babies at infrequent intervals . But philosophy or beauty for its own sake , or dreams ! Lord ! no ! The Mahometans know they have n't souls , and they say it . We know , and keep it up that they have . Have n't all we scientific men had 'em in our laboratories working ; do n't we know the papers they turn out ? Every sane man of five and forty knows something of the disillusionment of the feminine dream , but we who 've had the beautiful creatures under us , weighing rather badly , handling rather weakly , invariably missing every fine detail and all the implications of our researches , never flashing , never leaping , never being even thoroughly bad,—we're specialists in the subject . At the present time there are far more educated young women than educated young men available for research work — and who wants them ? Oh , the young professors who 've still got ideals perhaps . And in they come , and if they 're dull , they just voluminously do nothing , and if they 're bright , they either marry your demonstrator or get him into a mess . And the work — — ? It 's nothing to them . No woman ever painted for the love of painting , or sang for the sounds she made , or philosophized for the sake of wisdom as men do — — "

Yes , rabbits ! I stick to it . Look at the things a nice girl will marry ; look at the men 's children she 'll consent to bring into the world . Cheerfully ! Proudly ! For the sake of the home and the clothes . Nasty little beasts they 'll breed without turning a hair . All about us we see girls and women marrying ugly men , dull and stupid men , ill - tempered dyspeptic wrecks , sickly young fools , human rats — rats ! "

Does n't something tell us all that if we let a woman loose with our honour and trust , some other man will get hold of her ? We 've tried it long enough now , this theory that a woman 's a partner and an equal ; we 've tried it long enough to see some of the results , and does it work ? Does it ? A woman 's a prize , a possession , a responsibility , something to take care of and be careful about .... You chaps , if you 'll forgive me , you advanced chaps , seem to want to have the women take care of you . You seem always to want to force decisions on them , make them answerable for things that you ought to decide and answer for .... If one could , if one could ! If ! ... But they 're not helps — that 's a dream — they're distractions , gratifications , anxieties , dangers , undertakings .... "

The — the cheapness of it ! Raised voices , rash assertions , sham investigations , meetings and committees and meetings , that 's the stuff of it , and politicians really have to attend to it , and silly , ineffective , irritating bills really get drafted and messed about with and passed on the strength of it . Public affairs are still in the Dark Ages . Nobody now would think of getting together a scratch committee of rich old women and miscellaneous conspicuous people to design an electric tram , and jabbering and jabbering and jabbering , and if any one objects"—a

This project of the supersession of Wages by Payment in Kind — oh ! it 's childish . If it was n't it would be outrageous and indecent . Your uncle and aunt have n't thought for a moment of any single one of the necessary consequences of these things they say their confounded Movement aims at , effects upon the race , upon public spirit , upon people 's habits and motives . They 've just a queer craving to feel powerful and influential , which they think they can best satisfy by upsetting the lives of no end of harmless poor people — the only people they dare upset — and that 's about as far as they go ....

84576	84600	84573	84573	she	2611	" I waited and I waited . It seemed you must come . I read a book . And then I fell asleep . "
84612	84618	84638	84638	she	2611	" And here I am ! "
84632	84637	84638	84638	she	2611	" I 'm cold , "
84641	84648	84657	84657	Trafford	394	" and I want some tea . "
84649	84655	84668	84668	Marjorie	323	" Let 's make some , "
84659	84666	84668	84668	Marjorie	323	" It 's been horrible waiting , "
84672	84680	84638	84638	she	2611	" horrible ! Where have you been ? "
84681	84717	84728	84728	she	2611	" I 've been working . I got excited by my work . I 've been at the laboratory . I 've had the best spell of work I 've ever had since our marriage . "
84718	84727	84728	84728	she	2611	" But I have been up all night ! "
84739	84748	84779	84779	he	2616	" How could you ? How could you ? "
84772	84778	84896	84896	she	2611	" I 've been working , "
84889	84895	84909	84909	he	2616	" It 's been dreadful , "
84904	84908	84909	84909	he	2616	" You see , "
84916	84928	84896	84896	she	2611	" I 'd really got hold of my work at last . "
84929	84937	84999	84999	he	2616	" But you should have sent — — "
84938	84950	84909	84909	he	2616	" I was thinking of my work . I clean forgot . "
84951	84954	84896	84896	she	2611	" Forgot ? "
84955	84958	84999	84999	he	2616	" Absolutely . "
84959	84964	84971	84971	Trafford	394	" Forgot — me ! "
84965	84969	84971	84971	Trafford	394	" Of course , "
84979	84989	84999	84999	he	2616	" you do n't see it as I do . "
85005	85014	85050	85050	He	2616	" We 'll have to have a telephone . "
85015	85049	85070	85070	Marjorie	323	" I could n't imagine where you were . I thought of all sorts of things . I almost came round — but I was so horribly afraid I might n't find you . "
85058	85068	85070	85070	Marjorie	323	" So that if I really want you — — "
85072	85084	85090	85090	Trafford	394	" Or if I just want to feel you 're there . "
85085	85088	85364	85364	he	2616	" Yes , "
85391	85396	85805	85805	she	323	" three hundred pounds . "
85801	85804	85813	85813	he	2616	" Busy ? "
85808	85812	85844	85844	she	323	" Not very , "
85838	85843	85847	85847	He	2616	" Pass - book ? "
85850	85856	85869	85869	she	323	" I 've been overrunning . "
85857	85861	85872	85872	She	323	" No end . "
85880	85889	85901	85901	he	2616	" I 'm going to overrun some more . "
85895	85900	85901	85901	he	2616	" You ca n't , "
85909	85916	85872	85872	She	323	" You 've spent — enough . "
85917	85922	85928	85928	Her	323	" There's — things . "
85923	85927	85928	85928	Her	323	" What things ? "
85936	85956	85978	85978	he	2616	" We 'll have to give a wedding present to Daffy .... I shall want — some more furniture . "
85967	85977	85978	85978	he	2616	" I do n't think you can have it , "
85988	86001	85872	85872	She	323	" Marjorie , do you know how much money I 've got ? "
86002	86006	85978	85978	he	2616	" Six thousand . "
86007	86050	86057	86057	Marjorie	323	" I had . But we 've spent nearly a thousand pounds . Yes — one thousand pounds — over and above income . We meant to spend four hundred . And now , we 've got — hardly anything over five . "
86051	86055	86057	86057	Marjorie	323	" Five thousand , "
86059	86063	85978	85978	he	2616	" Five thousand . "
86064	86071	85978	85978	he	2616	" And there 's your salary . "
86072	86081	86087	86087	Marjorie	323	" Yes , but at this pace — — "
86082	86085	86090	86090	her	323	" Dear , "
86097	86105	86188	86188	she	2634	" dear — there 's something — — "
86173	86187	86188	86188	she	2634	" Oh ! do n't let 's spoil things by thinking of money , "
86191	86198	86199	86199	Her	2634	" I 've got something — — "
86206	86300	87035	87035	he	2638	" Do n't let 's spoil things by thinking of money .... It 's too good , dear , to be true . It 's too good to be true . It makes everything perfect .... We 'll have to furnish that little room . I did n't dare to hope it — somehow . I 've been so excited and afraid . But we 've got to furnish that little room there — that empty little room upstairs , dear , that we left over .... Oh my dear ! my dear ! "
87028	87034	87035	87035	he	2638	" You real scientific men , "
87038	87064	87328	87328	Agatha	432	" are no doubt a thousand times more accurate and novel and all that , but as no one seems able to understand you — — "
87339	87360	87387	87387	he	2660	" I hope it will be a girl , so that presently she may fight the battle of her sex , "
87380	87386	87387	87387	he	2660	" I want a boy , "
87400	87433	87457	87457	She	264	" Oh , one likes to have a boy . I want him with just your quick eyes and ears , my dear , and just my own safe and certain hands . "
87474	87492	87493	87493	Daffy	258	" Of course , dear——. Oh , I do so hope it wo n't annoy your father . "
87495	87498	87512	87515	the pseudo - twins	739	" nice , "
87517	87522	88428	88428	he	2680	" Hoo - ray ! "
88414	88427	88428	88428	he	2680	" I sit and muse sometimes when I ought to be computing , "
88431	88473	88490	88490	Marjorie	323	" Old Durgan watches me and grunts . But think , if we take reasonable care , watch its phases , stand ready with a kindergarten toy directly it stretches out its hand — think what we can make of it ! "
88475	88488	88490	88490	Marjorie	323	" We will make it the most wonderful child in the world , "
88492	88501	88508	88508	Trafford	394	" Indeed ! what else can it be ? "
88502	88506	88508	88508	Trafford	394	" Your eyes , "
88510	88515	88490	88490	Marjorie	323	" and my hands . "
88516	88520	88526	88526	He	2680	" A girl . "
88521	88525	89244	89244	He	2680	" A boy . "
89246	89253	89292	89292	he	2680	" Thank God , thank God ! "
89285	89291	89556	89556	she	323	" Is she all right ? "
89551	89555	91406	91407	Mrs. Pope	264	" Little daughter , "
91426	91430	91406	91407	Mrs. Pope	264	" look bad , "
91433	91439	91949	91950	Mrs. Flor	439	" have a good time . "
91940	91947	91961	91961	Sydney	438	" But they 're so delightful , "
91952	91959	92020	92020	she	323	" You 're overrunning your allowance , "
92011	92019	92020	92020	she	323	" If you do n't get it , "
92024	92028	92159	92159	he	1267	" I shall . "
92155	92158	92168	92168	she	323	" Hullo ! "
92162	92167	92168	92168	she	323	" A new picture , "
92171	92179	92205	92205	Trafford	436	" What do you think of it ? "
92180	92185	92168	92168	she	323	" What is it ? "
92186	92204	92205	92205	Trafford	436	" A town or something — never mind . Look at the colour . It heartens everything . "
92215	92248	92205	92205	Trafford	436	" It 's brilliant — and impudent . He 's an artist — whoever he is . He hits the thing . But — I say — how did you get it ? "
92249	92254	92205	92205	Trafford	436	" I bought it . "
92255	92265	92274	92274	Marjorie	323	" Bought it ! Good Lord ! How much ? "
92266	92272	92274	92274	Marjorie	323	" Oh ! ten guineas , "
92282	92294	92295	92295	Trafford	436	" it will be worth thirty in ten years ' time . "
92302	92306	92330	92330	Marjorie	323	" Ten guineas ! "
92321	92328	92369	92369	he	2790	" It was priced at thirteen , "
92360	92368	92369	92369	he	2790	" I think this is too much , "
92386	92455	92501	92501	he	2790	" I have just been earning two guineas at Croydon , of all places , administering comminuted science to fools — and here I find — this exploit ! Ten guineas ' worth of picture . To say we ca n't afford it is just to waste a mild expression . It's — mad extravagance . It 's waste of money — it's — oh!—monstrous disloyalty . Disloyalty ! "
92490	92500	92501	92501	he	2790	" I think this winds me up to something , "
92504	92518	92528	92528	He	2790	" You 'll have to give up your cheque - book , Marjorie . "
92519	92527	92563	92563	She	323	" Give up my cheque - book ! "
92581	92589	92599	92599	he	2790	" Because I 've bought this picture ? "
92590	92598	92629	92629	she	323	" Can we go on like this ? "
92622	92628	92798	92798	he	2790	" But it 's beautiful ! "
92812	92825	92959	92959	she	323	" this litter and rubbish for which I am wasting my life . "
92953	92958	92999	92999	she	323	" Here it is , "
92994	92998	92999	92999	she	323	" Take it , "
93002	93015	93056	93056	he	2790	" take it . I never asked you to give it me . "
93052	93055	93999	93999	She	323	" Marjorie ! "
93995	93998	94701	94701	she	323	" Movements . "
94650	94656	95240	95244	The small lady in glasses	2886	" we are all Socialists nowadays "
95279	95284	95432	95435	The women of England	2891	" bully women down , "
95451	95472	96270	96270	She	323	" No , we do n't count in an election , and we wo n't count now . Thank you . "
96297	96300	96531	96532	the man	1016	" No ! "
96516	96522	96661	96661	her	323	" Do we want them ? "
96638	96641	97356	97356	Trafford	394	" No ! "
97348	97354	97408	97408	Trafford	394	" But it was n't ! "
97402	97406	97617	97617	he	2979	" Good Lord ! "
97612	97616	97617	97617	he	2979	" Your speech , "
97620	97707	97601	97601	she	323	" was all right . I did n't know you could speak like that , Marjorie . But it soared like the dove above the waters . Waters ! I never heard such a flood of rubbish .... You know , it 's a mistake to mass women . It brings out something silly .... It affected Buzard as badly as any one . The extraordinary thing is they have a case , if only they 'd be quiet . Why did you get them together ? "
97708	97715	97601	97601	she	323	" It 's our local branch . "
97716	97722	97617	97617	he	2979	" Yes , but why ? "
97723	97740	97601	97601	she	323	" Well , if they talk about things — Discussions like this clear up their minds . "
97741	97749	97601	97601	she	323	" Discussion ! It was n't discussion . "
97750	97758	97862	97862	He	2995	" Oh ! it was a beginning . "
97759	97861	97862	97862	He	2995	" Chatter of that sort is n't the beginning of discussion , it 's the end . It 's the death - rattle . Nobody was meeting the thoughts of any one . I admit Buzard , who 's a man , talked the worst rubbish of all . That Primitive Matriarchate of his ! So it is n't sex . I 've noticed before that the men in this movement of yours are worse than the women . It is n't sex . It 's something else . It 's a foolishness . It 's a sort of irresponsible looseness . "
97868	97911	97601	97601	she	323	" You ought not to get all these people here . It 's contagious . Before you know it you 'll find your own mind liquefy and become enthusiastic and slop about . You 'll begin to talk monomania about Mr. Asquith . "
97912	97932	97862	97862	He	2995	" But it 's a great movement , Rag , even if incidentally they say and do silly things ! "
97933	98021	98039	98039	she	323	" My dear ! are n't I feminist ? Do n't I want women fine and sane and responsible ? Do n't I want them to have education , to handle things , to vote like men and bear themselves with the gravity of men ? And these meetings — all hat and flutter ! These displays of weak , untrained , hysterical vehemence ! These gatherings of open - mouthed impressionable young girls to be trained in incoherence ! You ca n't go on with it ! "
98030	98038	98039	98039	she	323	" I must go on with something , "
98042	98048	97601	97601	she	323	" Well , not this . "
98049	98053	97862	97862	He	2995	" Then what ? "
98054	98058	97862	97862	He	2995	" Something sane . "
98059	98064	98074	98074	Marjorie	323	" Tell me what . "
98065	98073	98089	98089	she	323	" It must come out of yourself . "
98081	98088	98108	98108	she	323	" Nothing comes out of myself , "
98092	98107	98108	98108	she	323	" I do n't think you realize a bit what my life has become , "
98112	98133	97862	97862	He	2995	" how much I 'm like some one who 's been put in a pleasant , high - class prison . "
98134	98143	98108	98108	she	323	" This house ! It 's your own ! "
98144	98379	98402	98402	She	2998	" It does n't give me an hour 's mental occupation in the day . It 's all very well to say I might do more in it . I can't — without absurdity . Or expenditure . I ca n't send the girl away and start scrubbing . I ca n't make jam or do ornamental needlework . The shops do it better and cheaper , and I have n't been trained to it . I 've been trained not to do it . I 've been brought up on games and school - books , and fed on mixed ideas . I ca n't sit down and pacify myself with a needle as women used to do . Besides , I not only detest doing needlework but I hate it — the sort of thing a woman of my kind does anyhow — when it 's done . I 'm no artist . I 'm not sufficiently interested in outside things to spend my time in serious systematic reading , and after four or five novels — oh , these meetings are better than that ! You see , you 've got a life — too much of it — I have n't got enough . I wish almost I could sleep away half the day . Oh ! I want something real , Rag ; something more than I 've got . "
98387	98401	98437	98437	she	2998	" Will you let me come to your laboratory and work with you ? "
98424	98436	98447	98447	he	2999	" Will you let me come to your laboratory and work ? "
98443	98446	98447	98447	he	2999	" No , "
98450	98454	98497	98497	He	2999	" Why not ? "
98455	98496	98497	98497	He	2999	" Because I 'm in love with you . I ca n't think of my work when you 're about .... And you 're too much behind . Oh my dear ! do n't you see how you 're behind ? "
98500	98515	98521	98521	Marjorie	323	" I 've been soaking in this stuff of mine for ten long years . "
98516	98519	98558	98558	she	323	" Yes , "
98550	98557	98547	98547	her	323	" But look here , Rag ! "
98559	98567	98635	98635	they	3001	cried—"what on earth am I to DO ? "
98629	98634	98635	98635	they	3001	" We 've got , "
98638	98655	99453	99453	she	436	" to talk all this out between us . We 've got to work this out . "
99481	99484	99955	99955	himself	3028	" Goo . "
99969	99976	100004	100004	he	3028	" Oh ! Damnation and damnation ! "
99995	100003	100021	100021	he	3028	" Damn the whole scheme of things ! "
100017	100020	100033	100033	she	323	" Behrens ! "
100029	100032	100049	100049	He	3028	" Behrens ? "
100041	100048	100088	100088	he	3028	" He 's doing my stuff ! "
100080	100087	100103	100103	she	323	" I ca n't stand it ! "
100096	100102	100103	100103	she	323	" I do n't understand , "
100106	100112	100118	100118	Trafford	436	" What has he done ? "
100113	100116	100140	100140	he	3028	" Oh ! "
100134	100139	100166	100166	he	3028	" Fool and thief , "
100162	100165	100196	100196	he	3028	" Ugh ! "
100188	100195	100203	100203	he	3028	" He 's doing my work , "
100208	100253	100254	100254	He	3028	" And I 've got to be in Croydon by half - past ten to lecture to a pack of spinsters and duffers , because they 're too stupid to get the stuff from books . It 's all in books,—every bit of it . "
100265	100420	100203	100203	he	3028	" It is n't as though he was doing it right . He is n't . He ca n't . He 's a fool . He 's a clever , greedy , dishonest fool with a twist . Oh ! the pile , the big Pile of silly muddled technicalities he 's invented already ! The solemn mess he 's making of it ! And there he is , I ca n't get ahead of him , I ca n't get at him . I 've got no time . I 've got no room or leisure to swing my mind in ! Oh , curse these engagements , curse all these silly fretting entanglements of lecture and article ! I never get the time , I ca n't get the time , I ca n't get my mind clear ! I 'm worried ! I 'm badgered ! And meanwhile Behrens — — ! "
100421	100431	100203	100203	he	3028	" Is he discovering what you want to discover ? "
100432	100479	100254	100254	He	3028	" Behrens ! No ! He 's going through the breaches I made . He 's guessing out what I meant to do . And he 's getting it set out all wrong,—misleading terminology,—distinctions made in the wrong place . Oh , the fool he is ! "
100480	100485	100203	100203	he	3028	" But afterwards — — "
100486	100524	100544	100544	she	3033	" Afterwards I may spend my life — removing the obstacles he 's made . He 'll be established and I sha n't . You do n't know anything of these things . You do n't understand . "
100536	100543	100719	100719	He	3034	" Will it affect your F.R.S. ? "
100547	100718	100744	100744	She	3035	" Oh ! that 's safe enough , and it does n't matter anyhow . The F.R.S. ! Confound the silly little F.R.S. ! As if that mattered . It 's seeing all my great openings — misused . It 's seeing all I might be doing . This brings it all home to me . Do n't you understand , Marjorie ? Will you never understand ? I 'm getting away from all that ! I 'm being hustled away by all this work , this silly everyday work to get money . Do n't you see that unless I can have time for thought and research , life is just darkness to me ? I 've made myself master of that stuff . I had at any rate . No one can do what I can do there . And when I find myself — oh , shut out , shut out ! I come near raving . As I think of it I want to rave again . "
100728	100743	100784	100784	she	3035	" I suppose I 'd better eat some breakfast . Is that egg boiled ? "
100779	100783	100775	100775	he	3034	" Look here ! "
100787	100823	100775	100775	he	3034	" Bad as I am , you 've got to reason with me , Rag . I did n't know all this . I did n't understand ... I do n't know what to do . "
100824	100831	100859	100859	She	3035	" What is there to do ? "
100832	100858	100859	100859	She	3035	" I 've got to do something . I 'm beginning to see things . It 's just as though everything had become clear suddenly . "
100863	100892	100775	100775	he	3034	" Oh , my dear ! I want to help you . I have so wanted to help you . Always . And it 's come to this ! "
100893	100917	100775	100775	he	3034	" But it 's not your fault . I did n't mean that . It's — it 's in the nature of things . "
100918	100924	100859	100859	She	3035	" It 's my fault . "
100925	100932	100775	100775	he	3034	" It 's not your fault . "
100933	100937	100775	100775	he	3034	" It is . "
100938	100956	100859	100859	She	3035	" Confound it , Marjorie . When I swear at Behrens I 'm not swearing at you . "
100957	101035	101044	101044	He	3036	" It 's my fault . All this is my fault . I 'm eating you up . What 's the good of your pretending , Rag . You know it is . Oh ! When I married you I meant to make you happy , I had no thought but to make you happy , to give myself to you , my body , my brains , everything , to make life beautiful for you — — "
101036	101043	101062	101062	she	3037	" Well , have n't you ? "
101054	101061	101086	101086	she	3037	" I 've broken your back , "
101077	101085	101120	101120	She	3037	" Do n't you know , Rag , "
101092	101119	101149	101149	she	3037	speak——"Don't you guess ? You do n't know half ! In that bureau there —— In there ! It 's stuffed with bills . Unpaid bills . "
101145	101148	101149	101149	she	3037	" Bills , "
101152	101166	101183	101189	one who hears of a common disaster	3038	" More than a hundred pounds still . Yes ! Now . Now ! "
101197	101202	101208	101208	she	3037	" Oh , damn ! "
101203	101207	101208	101208	she	3037	" I know , "
101211	101214	101246	101246	she	3037	" Damn ! "
101237	101245	101257	101257	he	3036	" That 's what I amount to , "
101249	101256	101271	101271	She	3037	" It 's your silly upbringing , "
101264	101270	101295	101295	he	3036	" And my silly self . "
101291	101294	101295	101295	he	3036	" Why ? "
101298	101330	101342	101342	Marjorie	323	" Take it . You gave me a cheque - book of my own and a corner of my own , and they — they are just ambushes — against you . "
101336	101340	101393	101393	she	3037	" Take it , "
101381	101392	101393	101393	she	3037	" I ought to be sent to the chemist 's , "
101396	101404	101423	101423	he	3036	" as one sends a worthless cat . "
101414	101422	101423	101423	he	3036	" You 're a bother , Marjorie , "
101432	101446	101509	101509	she	3037	" no end of a bother . I 'd better have those bills . "
101505	101508	101509	101509	she	3037	" Rag , "
101512	101533	101539	101539	he	3036	" all my heart is yours .... I want to help you .... And this is what I have done . "
101534	101538	101561	101561	he	3036	" I know , "
101557	101560	101561	101561	he	3036	" Gods ! "
101564	101577	101578	101578	He	3036	" look at the clock . I shall miss that Croydon lecture ! "
101584	101591	101669	101669	His	3036	" Where are my boots ? ... "
101673	101678	102085	102085	she	323	" damnation and damnation , "
102078	102084	102085	102085	she	323	" Hullo , old Daffy ! "
102088	102094	102114	102114	Daffy	258	" Hullo , old Madge ! "
102108	102112	102114	102114	Daffy	258	" Nothing wrong ? "
102119	102122	102136	102136	Daffy	258	" Wrong ? "
102123	102134	102136	102136	Daffy	258	" You look pale and — tired about the eyes , "
102147	102166	102175	102175	Marjorie	323	" Thought you might be a bit off it , that 's all . No offence , Madge . "
102167	102173	102175	102175	Marjorie	323	" I 'm all right , "
102184	102196	102136	102136	Daffy	258	" Want a holiday , perhaps . How 's every one ? "
102197	102293	102348	102348	Margharita	436	" All right . We 're off to Lake Garda next week . This new play has taken it out of Will tremendously . He wants a rest and fresh surroundings . It 's to be the biggest piece of work he 's done — so far , and it 's straining him . And people worry him here ; receptions , first nights , dinners , speeches . He 's so neat , you know , in his speeches .... But it wastes him . He wants to get away . How 's Rag ? "
102294	102297	102136	102136	Daffy	258	" Busy . "
102298	102301	102136	102136	Daffy	258	" Lecturing ? "
102302	102309	102348	102348	Margharita	436	" And his Research of course . "
102310	102321	102136	102136	Daffy	258	" Oh ! of course . How 's the Babe ? "
102322	102347	102405	102405	she	436	" Just in . Come up and see the little beast , Daffy ! It is getting so pretty , and it talks — — "
102397	102404	102419	102419	Marjorie	323	" Big , big , bog , "
102413	102417	102431	102431	Margharita	436	" Remembers you , "
102421	102429	102438	102438	Marjorie	323	" Bog ! Go ta - ta ! "
102433	102436	102458	102458	Margharita	436	" There ! "
102453	102456	102467	102467	Marjorie	323	" Bably , "
102460	102465	102467	102467	Marjorie	323	" That 's herself ! "
102474	102488	102516	102516	Marjorie	323	" She talks like this all day . Oh de sweetums , den ! "
102510	102514	102516	102516	Marjorie	323	" You darling ! "
102518	102524	102551	102551	Daffy	258	" you delight of life , "
102541	102550	102572	102572	Daffy	258	" It 's really the nicest of babies , "
102557	102570	102572	102572	Daffy	258	" I do n't know what I should do with a kiddy , "
102583	102788	102900	102900	Daffy	258	" I 'm really glad we have n't one — yet . He 'd love it , I know . But it would be a burthen in some ways . They are a tie . As he says , the next few years means so much for him . Of course , here his reputation is immense , and he 's known in Germany , and there are translations into Russian ; but he 's still got to conquer America , and he is n't really well known yet in France . They read him , of course , and buy him in America , but they're — restive . Oh ! I do so wish they 'd give him the Nobel prize , Madge , and have done with it ! It would settle everything . Still , as he says , we must n't think of that — yet , anyhow . He is n't venerable enough . It 's doubtful , he thinks , that they would give the Nobel prize to any humorist now that Mark Twain is dead . Mark Twain was different , you see , because of the German Emperor and all that white hair and everything . "
102886	102897	102900	102900	Daffy	258	" They always ask Will to the Royal Society Dinner , "
102902	102920	102955	102955	Daffy	258	" but of course he ca n't always go . He 's asked to so many things . "
102946	102953	102988	102988	Daffy	258	" He 's not really bald , "
102976	102986	102988	102988	Daffy	258	" I tell him I do n't want it , "
102990	103000	103828	103828	She	323	" but he 's frightfully keen upon getting one . "

104983	105000	105938	105938	Solomonson	424	" of this new work I ca n't begin here . I might make some notes . "
105932	105936	105938	105938	Solomonson	424	" Good luck ! "
105940	105958	105970	105970	Marjorie	323	" Good luck ! Come and have tea with us ! But this is a happy encounter ! "
105959	105968	105984	105985	that Lady	3134	" We 're dirty — but so healthy ! "
105976	105983	105984	105985	that Lady	3134	" You look , oh!—splendidly well , "
105988	105994	105938	105938	Solomonson	424	" We 've been walking . "
105995	106001	105984	105985	that Lady	3134	" With just that knapsack ! "
106002	106008	106016	106017	Lady Solomonson	424	" It 's been glorious . "
106009	106014	106016	106017	Lady Solomonson	424	" But the courage ! "
106024	106029	106462	106462	Marjorie	323	" the tragic hardship ! "
106452	106460	106462	106462	Marjorie	323	" But we 've got no clothes , "
106464	106483	106490	106491	Lady Solomonson	424	" no clothes at all ! We 've these hobnail boots and a pair each of heelless slippers . "

106504	106515	106516	106516	Her	424	" my dear ! My sister can manage all that ! "
106523	106557	106564	106564	Marjorie	323	" We can really manage all that . The house is packed with things . We 'll come to dinner in fancy dress . And Scott , my maid , is so clever . "
106558	106562	106572	106573	Lady Solomonson	424	" But really ! "
106566	106570	106580	106580	she	424	" My dear ! "
106575	106578	106598	106598	she	424	" Everything . "

107255	107259	107260	107260	he	462	" All this , "
107275	107279	107260	107260	he	462	" all that . "

107886	107893	108271	108271	Her	459	" is an exhalation from all that "
108285	108298	108927	108927	she	459	" You go first , dear . Will you go with Christabel ? "
108916	108926	108927	108927	she	459	" What do you think of my chubby boys ? "
108930	108977	108983	108983	Trafford	436	" They 're German work . They came from a show at Düsseldorf last week . Ben saw I liked them , and sent back for them secretly , and here they , are ! I thought they might be too colourless . But are they ? "
108978	108981	108983	108983	Trafford	436	" No , "
108985	109006	109013	109014	Mrs. Lee	459	" they 're just cool . Under that glow of fruit . Is this salt - cellar English cut glass ? "

109016	109022	109023	109023	She	459	" Is n't it jolly ? "

109067	109092	109130	109130	She	459	" like music . You know what I mean — a sort of easy rhythm . You do n't mind my praising your wife ? "
109099	109129	109145	109145	she	459	" And there 's a sort of dignity about her . All my life , Mr. Trafford , I 've wanted to be tall . It stopped my growth . "
109137	109144	109145	109145	she	459	" Tell me , Mr. Trafford , "
109148	109185	109210	109210	she	459	" was your wife beautiful like this when you married her ? I mean — of course she was a beautiful girl and adorable and all that ; but was n't she just a slender thing ? "
109226	109234	109251	109251	she	459	rich—"not that Ben is n't all he should be"—but
109245	109250	109251	109251	she	459	" People want help , "
109254	109383	109461	109462	Mrs. Lee	459	" so much more help than they get . They go about with themselves — what was it Mr. Radlett Barns said the other night — oh!—like people leading horses they dare n't ride . I think he says such good things at times , do n't you ? So wonderful to be clever in two ways like that . Just look now at your wife — now I mean , that they 've drawn that peacock - coloured curtain behind her . My brother - in - law has been telling me you keep the most wonderful and precious secrets locked up in your breast , that you know how to make gold and diamonds and all sorts of things . If I did,—I should make them . "
109476	109487	109504	109504	Rex	467	" Of course , Mr. Trafford would n't believe that . "
109495	109502	109504	109504	Rex	467	" I was telling Mrs. Lee , "
109506	109556	109814	109814	she	424	" that I do n't believe there 's any economy of human toil in machinery whatever . I mean that the machine itself really embodies all the toil it seems to save , toil that went to the making of it and preparing it and getting coal for it .... "
109806	109813	109844	109844	She	424	" I came down after all , "
109817	109843	109875	109876	Mrs. Lee	459	" I lay in bed weighing rolls and coffee and relaxed muscles against your English breakfast downstairs . And suddenly I remembered your little sausages ! "
109881	109890	110028	110028	Christabel	458	" Here they come ! Here they come ! "

110273	110283	110289	110289	Trafford	365	" You do n't I hope , mind children ? "
110284	110287	110310	110311	The child	1188	" But , "
110301	110309	110332	110333	Mrs. Lee	459	" is this tall young woman yours ? "
110325	110330	110356	110359	the boy of five	3287	" We began young , "

110370	110375	110387	110387	Christabel	458	" May we come ? "
110379	110385	110417	110418	Mrs. Lee	459	" May we all come ? "
110409	110415	110417	110418	Mrs. Lee	459	" Do you really care ? "

113462	113469	113470	113470	he	365	" I must give up research , "
113473	113519	113525	113525	she	323	" I 've been seeing it for days . Clearer and clearer . This dear , just settles things . Even — as we were coming home in the train — I was making up my mind . At Vevey I was talking to Solomonson . "

113626	113634	113709	113709	he	365	" Glad ! Why should you weep ? "
113698	113708	113709	113709	he	365	" I had thought anyhow of giving up research , "
113712	113767	113801	113801	he	365	" This merely decides . It happens to decide . I love you , dear . I put my research at your feet . Gladly . This is the end , and I do not care , my dear , at all . I do not care at all — seeing I have you .... "
113788	113800	113867	113867	He	365	" It is n't you , my dear , or me , "
113804	113866	113889	113889	he	365	" but life that beats us — that beautiful , irrational mother .... Life does not care for research or knowledge , but only for life . Oh ! the world has to go on yet for tens of thousands of years before — before we are free for that . I 've got to fight — as other men fight .... "
113880	113888	113889	113889	he	365	" But if it was not you , "
113900	113973	113981	113981	she	3383	" if I did not love you .... Thank God , I love you , dear ! Thank God , our children are love children ! I want to live — to my finger - tips , but if I did n't love you — oh ! love you ! then I think now — I'd be glad — I'd be glad , I think , to cheat life of her victory . "
113974	113980	114032	114032	she	3383	" Oh , my dear ! "
114027	114031	114065	114065	he	365	" My dear , "

114068	114077	114084	114084	Solomonson	424	" you were talking about rubber at Vevey . "
114078	114082	114084	114084	Solomonson	424	" I remember , "
114091	114098	114065	114065	he	365	" I 've thought it over . "
114099	114105	114140	114140	Solomonson	424	" I thought you would . "
114106	114139	114153	114153	he	365	" I 've thought things over . I 'm going to give up my professorship — and science generally , and come into business — if that is what you are meaning . "
114156	114175	114194	114194	he	365	" You must n't give up your professorship yet , Trafford . For the rest — I'm glad . "
114189	114193	114194	114194	he	365	" I knew , "
114197	114201	114209	114209	Trafford	365	" you would . "
114202	114207	114209	114209	Trafford	365	" I did n't , "
114211	114217	114267	114267	He	365	" Things have happened since . "
114218	114266	114281	114281	he	365	" Something was bound to happen . You 're too good — for what it gave you . I did n't talk to you out there for nothing . I saw things .... Let 's go into the other room , and smoke and talk it over . "
114274	114280	114281	114281	he	365	" I thought you would , "
114288	114307	114321	114321	Solomonson	424	" I knew you would . You see,—one has to . You ca n't get out of it . "
114308	114319	114321	114321	Solomonson	424	" It was all very well before you were married , "
114329	114467	114505	114505	He	3385	" but when a man 's married he 's got to think . He ca n't go on devoting himself to his art and his science and all that — not if he 's married anything worth having . No . Oh , I understand . He 's got to look about him , and forget the distant prospect for a bit . I saw you 'd come to it . I came to it . Had to . I had ambitions — just as you have . I 've always had an inclination to do a bit of research on my own . I like it , you know . Oh ! I could have done things . I 'm sure I could have done things . I 'm not a born money - maker . But——. "
114475	114504	114528	114528	He	3385	" It's —— them . You said good - bye to science for a bit when you flopped me down on that old croquet - lawn , Trafford . "
114511	114527	114528	114528	He	3385	" Lord , how we went over ! No more aviation for me , Trafford ! "
114536	114568	114579	114579	Trafford	365	" After all — this of course — it 's interesting . Once you get into the movement of it , it takes hold of you . It 's a game . "
114569	114578	114579	114579	Trafford	365	" I 've thought over all you said , "
114586	114619	114620	114620	Solomonson	424	" Bluntly — I want three thousand a year , and I do n't make eight hundred . It 's come home to me . I 'm going to have another child . "
114625	114730	114745	114745	Solomonson	424	" All the same , I hate dropping research . It 's stuff I 'm made to do . About that , Solomonson , I 'm almost superstitious . I could say I had a call .... It 's the maddest state of affairs ! Now that I 'm doing absolutely my best work for mankind , work I firmly believe no one else can do , I just manage to get six hundred — nearly two hundred of my eight hundred is my own . What does the world think I could do better — that would be worth four times as much . "
114731	114743	114745	114745	Solomonson	424	" The world does n't think anything at all about it , "
114747	114752	114782	114782	he	364	" Suppose it did ! "
114774	114781	114782	114782	he	364	" Oh , it wo n't , "
114790	114811	114823	114823	he	364	" There is n't any world — not in that sense . That 's the mistake you make , Trafford . "
114812	114822	114823	114823	he	364	" It 's not what your work is worth , "
114826	114909	114910	114910	His	364	" It 's what your advantages can get for you . People are always going about supposing — just what you suppose — that people ought to get paid in proportion to the good they do . It 's forgetting what the world is , to do that . Very likely some day civilization will get to that , but it has n't got to it yet . It is n't going to get to it for hundreds and hundreds of years . "
114915	115133	115196	115197	Sir Rupert	364	" Civilization 's just a fight , Trafford — just as savagery is a fight , and being a wild beast is a fight,—only you have paddeder gloves on and there 's more rules . We are n't out for everybody , we 're out for ourselves — and a few friends perhaps — within limits . It 's no good hurrying ahead and pretending civilization 's something else , when it is n't . That 's where all these socialists and people come a howler . Oh , I know the Socialists . I see 'em at my wife 's At Homes . They come along with the literary people and the artists ' wives and the actors and actresses , and none of them take much account of me because I 'm just a business man and rather dark and short , and so I get a chance of looking at them from the side that is n't on show while the other 's turned to the women , and they 're just as fighting as the rest of us , only they humbug more and they do n't seem to me to have a decent respect for any of the common rules . And that 's about what it all comes to , Trafford . "
115184	115194	115196	115197	Sir Rupert	364	" It 's when it comes to the women , "
115199	115312	115322	115322	Trafford	365	" that one finds it out . That 's where you 've found it out . You say , I 'm going to devote my life to the service of Humanity in general . You 'll find Humanity in particular , in the shape of all the fine , beautiful , delightful and desirable women you come across , preferring a narrower turn of devotion . See ? That 's all . Caeteris paribus , of course . That 's what I found out , and that 's what you 've found out , and that 's what everybody with any sense in his head finds out , and there you are . "
115313	115320	115497	115497	He	3387	" You put it — graphically , "
115324	115496	115521	115521	he	3387	" I feel it graphically . I may be all sorts of things , but I do know a fact when I see it . I 'm here with a few things I want and a woman or so I have and want to keep , and the kids upstairs , bless 'em ! and I 'm in league with all the others who want the same sort of things . Against any one or anything that upsets us . We stand by the law and each other , and that 's what it all amounts to . That 's as far as my patch of Humanity goes . Humanity at large ! Humanity be blowed ! Look at it ! It is n't that I 'm hostile to Humanity , mind you , but that I 'm not disposed to go under as I should do if I did n't say that . So I say it . And that 's about all it is , and there you are . "
115541	115604	115613	115613	Trafford	365	" I say all this in order to dispose of any idea that you can keep up the open - minded tell - everybody - every - thing scientific attitude if you come into business . You ca n't . Put business in two words and what is it ? Keeping something from somebody else , and making him pay for it — "
115605	115611	115613	115613	Trafford	365	" Oh , look here ! "
115615	115624	115521	115521	he	3387	" That 's not the whole of business . "
115625	115653	115613	115613	Trafford	365	" There 's making him want it , of course , advertisement and all that , but that falls under making him pay for it , really . "
115654	115667	115686	115686	he	364	" But a business man organizes public services , consolidates , economizes . "
115682	115685	115686	115686	he	364	" Incidentally , "
115696	115708	115715	115715	Trafford	365	" Sometimes ... I thought we were talking of making money . "
115709	115713	115725	115725	Solomonson	364	" Go on , "
115717	115723	115725	115725	Solomonson	364	" You set me thinking , "
115727	115815	115686	115686	he	364	" It 's the thing I always like about you . I tell you , Trafford , I do n't believe that the majority of people who make money help civilization forward any more than the smoke that comes out of the engine helps the train forward . If you put it to me , I do n't . I 've got no illusions of that sort . They 're about as much help as — fat . They accumulate because things happen to be arranged so . "
115816	115825	115725	115725	Solomonson	364	" Things will be arranged better some day . "
115826	116086	116151	116151	Solomonson	364	" They are n't arranged better now . Grip that ! Now , it 's a sort of paradox . If you 've got big gifts and you choose to help forward the world , if you choose to tell all you know and give away everything you can do in the way of work , you 've got to give up the ideas of wealth and security , and that means fine women and children . You 've got to be a deprived sort of man . ' All right , ' you say , ' That 's me ! ' But how about your wife being a deprived sort of woman ? Eh ? That 's where it gets you ! And meanwhile , you know , while you make your sacrifices and do your researches , there 'll be little mean sharp active beasts making money all over you like maggots on a cheese . And if everybody who 'd got gifts and altruistic ideas gave themselves up to it , then evidently only the mean and greedy lot would breed and have the glory . They 'd get everything . Every blessed thing . There would n't be an option they did n't hold . And the other chaps would produce the art and the science and the literature , as far as the men who 'd got hold of things would let 'em , and perish out of the earth altogether .... There you are ! Still , that 's how things are made .... "
116087	116150	116168	116168	he	364	" But it is n't worth it . It is n't worth extinguishing oneself in order to make a world for those others , anyhow . Them and their children . Is it ? Eh ? It 's like building a temple for flies to buzz in .... There is such a thing as a personal side to Eugenics , you know . "
116160	116167	116179	116179	Trafford	365	" It is n't good enough , "
116171	116177	116187	116187	Solomonson	364	" You 're infernally right , "
116181	116185	116187	116187	Solomonson	364	" Very well , "
116189	116198	116482	116482	his	3391	" and now we can get to business . "
116485	116496	116538	116538	he	364	" My dear chap , positively — you must n't , "
116526	116537	116556	116556	Trafford	365	" Do n't you see all you are throwing away ? "
116541	116554	116612	116612	Trafford	365	" I suppose it 's our quality to throw such things away , "
116594	116610	116612	116612	Trafford	365	" When men dropped that idea of concealing knowledge , alchemist gave place to chemist , "
116614	116642	116650	116650	Solomonson	364	" and all that is worth having in modern life , all that makes it better and safer and more hopeful than the ancient life , began . "
116643	116648	116650	116650	Solomonson	364	" My dear fellow , "
116652	116695	117043	117043	Solomonson	364	" I know , I know . But to give away the synthesis of rubber ! To just shove it out of the window into the street ! Gare l'eau ! O ! And when you could do with so much too ! "
117034	117042	117043	117043	Solomonson	364	" But you must think of consequences , "
117053	117162	117404	117404	Trafford	365	" Here you are , shying this cheap synthetic rubber of yours into the world — for it 's bound to be cheap ! any one can see that — like a bomb into a market - place . What 's the good of saying you do n't care about the market - place , that your business is just to make bombs and drop them out of the window ? You smash up things just the same . Why ! you 'll ruin hundreds and thousands of people , people living on rubber shares , people working in plantations , old , inadaptable workers in rubber works .... "
117397	117402	117411	117411	Solomonson	364	" I hate secrecy , "
117406	117409	117517	117517	Solomonson	364	" Business , "
117502	117515	117517	117517	Solomonson	364	" I believe we can do the stuff at tenpence a pound , "
117536	117610	117706	117708	Sir Rupert Solomonson	364	" so soon , that is , as we deal in quantity . Tenpence ! We can lower the price and spread the market , sixpence by sixpence . In the end — there wo n't be any more plantations . Have to grow tea .... I say , let 's have an invalid dinner of chicken and champagne , and go on with this . It 's fascinating . You can telephone . "
117696	117704	117706	117708	Sir Rupert Solomonson	364	" Let 's think of other things , "
117710	117865	117988	117988	he	364	" Diamonds ! No ! They 've got too many tons stowed away already . A diamond now — it 's an absolutely artificial value . At any time a new discovery and one wild proprietor might bust that show . Lord!—diamonds ! Metals ? Of course you 've worked the colloids chiefly . I suppose there 's been more done in metals and alloys than anywhere . There 's a lot of other substances . Business has hardly begun to touch substances yet , you know , Trafford — flexible glass , for example , and things like that . So far we 've always taken substances for granted . On our side , I mean . It 's extraordinary how narrow the outlook of business and finance is — still . It never seems to lead to things , never thinks ahead . In this case of rubber , for example — — "
117866	117895	117706	117708	Sir Rupert Solomonson	364	" When men fight for their own hands and for profit and position in the next ten years or so , I suppose they tend to become narrow . "
117896	117902	117914	117914	his	364	" I suppose they must . "
117921	117940	117946	117946	Trafford	365	" But what a pull they get , Trafford , if perhaps — they do n't , eh ? "
117941	117944	117946	117946	Trafford	365	" No , "
117954	117962	117970	117970	Solomonson	364	" the other sort gets the pull . "

120783	120787	120788	120788	he	484	" After all , "
120791	120800	120808	120808	Dowd	484	" it 's not me so particularly — — "
120801	120806	120808	120808	Dowd	484	" But it is , "
120810	120819	120841	120841	Trafford	365	" It 's the system things go upon . "
120820	120840	120858	120858	Dowd	484	" You 're the responsible part of it . You have freedom , you have power and endless opportunity — "
120846	120856	120858	120858	Dowd	484	" It 's because your sort wants too much , "
120860	120868	120808	120808	Dowd	484	" that my sort has n't enough . "
120869	120878	120808	120808	Dowd	484	" Tell me how to organize things better . "
120879	120913	120858	120858	Dowd	484	" Much you 'd care . They 'll organize themselves . Everything is drifting to class separation , the growing discontent , the growing hardship of the masses .... Then you 'll see . "
120914	120922	120808	120808	Dowd	484	" Then what 's going to happen ? "
120923	120930	120808	120808	Dowd	484	" Overthrow . And social democracy . "
120931	120939	120960	120960	he	484	" How is that going to work ? "
120948	120959	120960	120960	he	484	" I do n't care if it does n't work , "
120963	120983	120989	120989	Trafford	365	" so long as we smash up this . We 're getting too sick to care what comes after . "
120984	120987	120989	120989	Trafford	365	" Dowd , "
120992	121001	121017	121017	he	484	" I 'm not so satisfied with things . "
121008	121016	121017	121017	he	484	" You 'll get reconciled to it , "
121020	121067	121073	121073	Dowd	484	" It 's ugly here — but it 's all right there — at the spending end .... Your sort has got to grab , your sort has got to spend — until the thing works out and the social revolution makes an end of you . "
121068	121072	121108	121108	he	365	" And then ? "
121096	121107	121108	121108	he	365	" I do n't object so much to your diagnosis , "
121111	121126	121135	121135	Dowd	484	" as to your remedy . It does n't strike me as a remedy . "
121127	121133	121173	121173	He	484	" It 's an end , "
121137	121172	121191	121191	Trafford	365	" anyhow . My God ! When I think of all the women and shirkers flaunting and frittering away there in the West , while here men and women toil and worry and starve .... "
121186	121189	121191	121191	Trafford	365	" Dowd , "
121197	121207	121213	121213	Dowd	484	" What would you do if you were me ? "
121208	121211	121220	121220	Trafford	365	" Do ? "
121215	121218	121191	121191	Trafford	365	" Yes , "
121227	121233	121247	121247	Dowd	484	" what would you do ? "
121234	121245	121247	121247	Dowd	484	" Now that 's a curious question , Mr. Trafford , "
121254	121264	121270	121270	Trafford	365	" Meaning — if I were in your place ? "
121265	121268	121270	121270	Trafford	365	" Yes , "
121272	121281	121294	121294	he	484	" What would you do in my place ? "
121282	121293	121302	121302	Trafford	365	" I should sell out of this place jolly quick , "
121297	121300	121302	121302	Trafford	365	" Sell ! "
121305	121326	121270	121270	Trafford	365	" Yes — sell . And start a socialist daily right off . An absolutely independent , unbiassed socialist daily . "
121327	121334	121270	121270	Trafford	365	" And what would that do ? "
121335	121350	121381	121381	Dowd	484	" It would stir people up . Every day it would stir people up . "
121351	121380	121408	121408	he	484	" But you see I ca n't edit . I have n't the money for half a year of a socialist daily .... And meanwhile people want rubber . "
121386	121407	121422	121422	Trafford	365	" You mean that you and your wife want to have the spending of six or eight thousand a year , "
121411	121420	121433	121433	Dowd	484	" I do n't make half of that , "
121424	121431	121445	121445	Trafford	365	" Well — half of that , "
121435	121444	121460	121460	he	365	" It 's all the same to me . "
121448	121459	121460	121460	he	365	" The point where I do n't agree with you , "
121463	121488	121445	121445	Trafford	365	" is in supposing that my scale of living — over there , is directly connected with the scale of living — about here . "
121489	121496	121460	121460	he	365	" Well , is n't it ? "
121497	121567	121575	121575	Dowd	484	" ' Directly , ' I said . No . If we just stopped it — over there — there'd be no improvement here . In fact , for a time it would mean dislocations . It might mean permanent , hopeless , catastrophic dislocation . You know that as well as I do . Suppose the West - end became — Tolstoyan ; the East would become chaos . "
121568	121573	121575	121575	Dowd	484	" Not much likelihood , "
121577	121695	121701	121701	Dowd	484	" That 's another question . That we earn together here and that I spend alone over there , it 's unjust and bad , but it is n't a thing that admits of any simple remedy . Where we differ , Dowd , is about that remedy . I admit the disease as fully as you do . I , as much as you , want to see the dawn of a great change in the ways of human living . But I do n't think the diagnosis is complete and satisfactory ; our problem is an intricate muddle of disorders , not one simple disorder , and I do n't see what treatment is indicated . "
121696	121699	121701	121701	Dowd	484	" Socialism , "
121703	121707	121721	121721	Trafford	365	" is indicated . "
121708	121719	121728	121728	his	365	" You might as well say that health is indicated , "
121731	121883	121896	121896	Dowd	484	" Does any one question that if we could have this socialist state in which every one is devoted and every one is free , in which there is no waste and no want , and beauty and brotherhood prevail universally , we would n't ? But——. You socialists have no scheme of government , no scheme of economic organization , no intelligible guarantees of personal liberty , no method of progress , no ideas about marriage , no plan — except those little pickpocket plans of the Fabians that you despise as much as I do — for making this order into that other order you 've never yet taken the trouble to work out even in principle . Really you know , Dowd , what is the good of pointing at my wife 's dresses and waving the red flag at me , and talking of human miseries — — "
121884	121894	122025	122025	Trafford	365	" It seems to wake you up a bit , "
122034	122049	122372	122373	Aunt Plessington	253	" from each according to his ability , to each according to his need , "
122361	122370	122372	122373	Aunt Plessington	253	" Marjorie 's brought him round at last ! "
122375	122385	122897	122897	Dowd	484	" I knew I could trust my little Madge ! "
122888	122895	122897	122897	Dowd	484	" It 's coming to that , "
122899	122906	122916	122916	he	365	" it 's coming to that . "
122907	122915	122916	122916	he	365	" What 's the good of it ? "
122924	122940	123155	123155	He	365	" It 's a sort of relief to the feelings . Why should n't we ? "
123177	123182	123789	123789	Marjorie	323	" is n't in it "
123775	123787	123789	123789	Marjorie	323	" He can do what he likes in the rubber world , "
123791	123857	124029	124029	he	246	" In Mincing Lane , where they deal in rubber shares , they used to call him and Sir Rupert the invaders ; now they call them the Conquering Heroes .... Of course , it 's mere child 's play to Godwin , but , as he said , ' We want money . ' It wo n't really interfere with his more important interests .... "
124017	124028	124626	124627	Mrs. Millingham	500	" You 've made a man of him , Maggots , "
124619	124624	124626	124627	Mrs. Millingham	500	" She 's passive , "
124629	124634	125145	125145	Marjorie	323	" She bores him .... "
125138	125143	125145	125145	Marjorie	323	" That 's enough , "
125147	125156	126296	126302	One or two of his intimate friends	3713	" now we 've got to rear them . "

129028	129036	129038	129039	the speaker	629	" Seems to be a remarkable country , "
129041	129069	129781	129781	Trafford	508	" Mineral wealth hardly glanced at , you know . Furs and a few score Indians . And at our doors . Practically — at our doors . "
129772	129779	129903	129903	Blenkins	508	" I 'm off to Labrador , "
129894	129901	129903	129903	Blenkins	508	" We were talking of you , "
129905	129921	129881	129882	Weston Massinghay	510	" Come and sit down with us . Why do n't you come into Parliament ? "
129922	129935	129942	129942	Blenkins	508	" I 've just arranged to go for some months to Labrador . "
129936	129940	129942	129942	Blenkins	508	" Industrial development ? "
129947	129952	129989	129989	Trafford	508	" No . Holiday . "
129975	129988	130012	130012	he	508	" Well , come into Parliament as soon as you get back . "
130008	130011	130050	130050	Blenkins	508	" No , "
130018	130049	130063	130063	Blenkins	508	" we settled all that . And now I 'm up to my neck in — detail about Labrador . I shall be starting — before the month is out . "
130056	130061	130063	130063	Blenkins	508	" It 's immoral , "
130065	130078	130088	130088	Hart	511	" for a man of your standing to keep out of politics . "
130079	130086	130088	130088	Hart	511	" It 's more than immoral , "
130090	130095	130107	130107	Trafford	508	" it 's American . "
130096	130105	130302	130302	he	508	" Solomonson comes in to represent the firm , "
130312	130324	130614	130614	He	508	" If those other fellows get hold of him — — ! "

131704	131713	131715	131715	Durgan	433	" If he chooses to do something here , "
131720	131725	131744	131744	Trafford	508	" a man can .... "
131726	131742	131757	131757	Durgan	433	" What 's become of the little old room where we two used to work ? "
131746	131755	131895	131895	He	433	" They 'll turn 'em all out presently , "
131759	131894	131913	131913	Trafford	508	" when this part is ready , but just at present it 's very much as you left it . There 's been precious little research done there since you went away — not what I call research . Females chiefly — and boys . Playing at it . Making themselves into D.Sc . 's by a baby research instead of a man 's examination . It 's like broaching a thirty - two gallon cask full of Pap to think of it . Lord , sir , the swill ! Research ! Counting and weighing things ! Professor Lake 's all right , I suppose , but his work was mostly mathematical ; he did n't do much of it here . No , the old days ended , sir , when you .... "
131905	131912	132092	132092	he	508	" Got busy with other things . "

132118	132130	132140	132140	Durgan	433	" I wonder — I may take it up again presently . "
132131	132138	132140	132140	Durgan	433	" I doubt it , sir , "
132142	132151	132168	132168	Durgan	433	" Oh ! But suppose I come back ? "
132152	132166	133106	133106	Trafford	394	" I do n't think you would find yourself coming back , sir , "
133099	133104	133106	133106	Trafford	394	" Mrs. Trafford in ? "
133108	133120	133656	133656	he	508	" She said she would be in by four , sir . "
133652	133655	134549	134549	she	848	" Preposterous , "

134598	134624	134636	134636	he	775	" Alice Carmel told me of it . It is n't in Berkeley Square , but it 's near it . It 's rather good . "
134630	134635	134636	134636	he	775	" That's — premature , "

134651	134659	134712	134712	his	775	" I wo n't go to another . "
134660	134664	134636	134636	he	775	" But why ? "

136223	136226	136264	136264	he	990	" Done ? "
136254	136263	136264	136264	he	990	" I 'm going away , little mother , "

136329	136337	136236	136236	She	323	" The best part of a year . "

136610	136621	136636	136636	she	323	" I 'm tired of all this business and finance , "
136628	136635	136636	136636	she	323	" I thought you would be , "
136641	136662	136706	136706	she	323	" Yes . I 've had enough of things . I want to get clear . And begin again somehow . "
136701	136705	136724	136724	he	990	" And Marjorie ? "
136719	136723	136808	136808	He	990	" You see , "
136732	136807	136864	136864	she	323	" I 'm beached . I 'm aground . I 'm spoilt now for the old researches — spoilt altogether . And I do n't like this life I 'm leading . I detest it . While I was struggling it had a kind of interest . There was an excitement in piling up the first twenty thousand . But now — ! It 's empty , it 's aimless , it 's incessant .... "
136853	136863	136874	136874	He	990	" Does Marjorie like the life you are leading ? "
136886	136893	136900	136900	He	990	" Oh , she likes it . "
136894	136899	136900	136900	He	990	" Are you sure ? "
136903	136912	137019	137019	She	4047	" She wo n't like it without you . "
136913	137018	137033	137033	she	4047	" Oh , that 's too much ! It 's her world . It 's what she 's done — what she 's made . She can have it ; she can keep it . I 've played my part and got it for her . But now — now I 'm free to go . I will go . She 's got everything else . I 've done my half of the bargain . But my soul 's my own . If I want to go away and think , I will . Not even Marjorie shall stand in the way of that . "
137037	137046	137060	137060	he	4048	" Why should n't Marjorie think , too ? "
137054	137059	137060	137060	he	4048	" She does n't , "
137075	137081	137169	137169	her	4049	" But you two — — "
137082	137128	137135	137135	He	4048	" We do n't talk . It 's astonishing — how we do n't . We do n't . We ca n't . We try to , and we ca n't . And she goes her way , and now — I will go mine . "
137129	137134	137135	137135	He	4048	" And leave her ? "
137138	137142	137169	137169	her	4049	" In London ? "
137143	137152	137169	137169	her	4049	" With all the things she cares for . "
137153	137157	137167	137167	She	4049	" Except yourself . "
137158	137166	137180	137180	she	4049	" I 'm only a means — — "
137175	137179	137180	137180	she	4049	" You know , "
137183	137189	137195	137195	she	4049	" that is n't true . "
137191	137194	137210	137210	she	4049	" No , "
137203	137209	137210	137210	she	4049	" I 've watched her , "
137214	137268	137288	137288	she	4049	" You 're not a means . I 'd have spoken long ago if I had thought that . Have n't I watched ? Have n't I lain awake through long nights thinking about her and you , thinking over every casual mood , every little sign — longing to help — helpless . "
137280	137287	137356	137356	she	4049	" It has come to this , "
137345	137355	137356	137356	she	4049	" It 's so hard to talk to you , "
137359	137389	137414	137414	she	4049	" and about all this .... I care so much . For her . And for you .... Words do n't come , dear .... One says stupid things . "
137409	137413	137414	137414	she	4049	" You see , "
137417	137475	137390	137390	She	4049	" you 're ill . You are n't just . You 've come to an end . You do n't know where you are and what you want to do . Neither does she , my dear . She 's as aimless as you — and less able to help it . Ever so much less able . "
137476	137496	137390	137390	She	4049	" But she does n't show it . She goes on . She wants things and wants things — — "
137497	137560	137414	137414	she	4049	" And you want to go away . It 's the same thing . It 's exactly the same thing . It 's dissatisfaction . Life leaves you empty and craving — leaves you with nothing to do but little immediate things that turn to dust as you do them . It 's her trouble , just as it 's your trouble . "
137561	137569	137390	137390	She	4049	" But she does n't show it . "
137570	137615	137630	137630	he	4051	" Women do n't . Not so much . Perhaps even she does n't know it . Half the women in our world do n't know — and for a woman it 's so much easier to go on — so many little things . "
137626	137629	137630	137630	he	4051	" Mother , "
137633	137640	137414	137414	she	4049	" I mean to go away . "
137641	137647	137414	137414	she	4049	" But think of her ! "
137648	137662	137630	137630	he	4051	" I 've thought . Now I 've got to think of myself . "
137663	137670	137414	137414	she	4049	" You can't — without her . "
137671	137684	137414	137414	she	4049	" I will . It 's what I 'm resolved to do . "
137685	137690	137630	137630	he	4051	" Go right away ? "
137691	137695	137414	137414	she	4049	" Right away . "
137696	137700	137701	137701	He	4051	" And think ? "
137704	137716	137630	137630	he	4051	" Find out — what it all means , my boy ? "
137717	137727	137630	137630	he	4051	" Yes . So far as I 'm concerned . "
137728	137734	137630	137630	he	4051	" And then — — ? "
137735	137747	137630	137630	he	4051	" Come back , I suppose . I have n't thought . "
137748	137752	137774	137774	she	4052	" To her ? "
137770	137773	137774	137774	she	4052	" Godwin , "
137777	137794	137795	137795	He	4051	" she 'd only be further behind .... You 've got to take her with you . "
137801	137818	137861	137862	Mrs. Trafford	394	" You 've got to think things out with her . If you do n't — — "
137819	137824	137837	137837	She	4052	" I ca n't . "
137825	137836	137845	137845	he	4051	" Then you ought to go away with her — — "
137840	137844	137845	137845	he	4051	" For good ? "
137848	137851	137902	137902	she	394	" Yes . "
137891	137901	138005	138005	She	394	" I 've thought so much of these things , "
137913	138004	138005	138005	She	394	" It 's not only you two , but others . And all the movement about us .... Marriage is n't what it was . It 's become a different thing because women have become human beings . Only —— You know , Godwin , all these things are so difficult to express . Woman 's come out of being a slave , and yet she is n't an equal .... We 've had a sort of sham emancipation , and we have n't yet come to the real one . "
138022	138255	138309	138309	he	4055	" If you go away from her and make the most wonderful discoveries about life and yourself , it 's no good — unless she makes them too . It 's no good at all .... You ca n't live without her in the end , any more than she can live without you . You may think you can , but I 've watched you . You do n't want to go away from her , you want to go away from the world that 's got hold of her , from the dresses and parties and the competition and all this complicated flatness we have to live in .... It would n't worry you a bit , if it had n't got hold of her . You do n't want to get out of it for your own sake . You are out of it . You are as much out of it as any one can be . Only she holds you in it , because she is n't out of it . Your going away will do nothing . She 'll still be in it — and still have her hold on you .... You 've got to take her away . Or else — if you go away — in the end it will be just like a ship , Godwin , coming back to its moorings . "
138300	138308	138309	138309	he	4055	" You 're a wise little mother , "
138312	138329	138337	138337	she	4054	" I did n't see things in that light .... I wonder if you 're right . "
138330	138336	138337	138337	she	4054	" I know I am , "
138340	138350	138309	138309	he	4055	" I 've thought more and more,—it was Marjorie . "
138351	138357	138373	138374	Mrs. Trafford	394	" It 's the world . "
138358	138372	138373	138374	Mrs. Trafford	394	" Women made the world . All the dress and display and competition . "
138377	138409	138424	138424	she	4054	" Sex made the world . Neither men nor women . But the world has got hold of the women tighter than it has the men . They 're deeper in . "
138417	138423	138437	138437	Trafford	394	" Take her with you , "
138429	138435	138458	138458	she	4054	" She wo n't come , "
138447	138457	138458	138458	she	4054	" She 'll come — if you make her , "
138461	138470	138443	138444	Mrs. Trafford	394	" She 'll want to bring two housemaids . "
138471	138485	138458	138458	she	4054	" I do n't think you know Marjorie as well as I do . "
138486	138493	138443	138444	Mrs. Trafford	394	" But she ca n't — — "
138494	138521	138549	138549	he	4058	" She can . It 's you — you'll want to take two housemaids for her . Even you .... Men are not fair to women . "
138541	138548	138549	138549	he	4058	" Does Marjorie care for me ? "
138552	138561	138458	138458	she	4054	" You 're the sun of her world . "
138562	138569	138549	138549	he	4058	" But she goes her way . "
138570	138611	138549	138549	he	4058	" She 's clever , she 's full of life , full of activities , eager to make and arrange and order ; but there 's nothing she is , nothing she makes , that does n't centre on you . "
138612	138622	138632	138632	He	4058	" But if she cared , she 'd understand ! "
138623	138631	138643	138643	he	4058	" My dear , do you understand ? "
138636	138642	138643	138643	he	4058	" I had everything clear , "
138646	138654	138667	138667	he	4058	" I saw my way to Labrador .... "
138662	138666	138667	138667	he	4058	" Good God ! "
138670	138730	138910	138911	his wife	848	" I 'm to be at dinner somewhere at seven . We 're going to a first night . With the Bernards , I think . Then I suppose we 'll have a supper . Always life is being slashed to tatters by these things . Always . One thinks in snatches of fifty minutes . It 's dementia .... "
138897	138909	138922	138922	Bernard	532	" He does n't seem to care to see his things , "
138914	138920	138933	138934	Mrs. Capes	495	" It 's so brilliant , "
138924	138931	138937	138937	her	495	" He has to do it , "
138946	138956	139117	139117	he	4064	" It is n't what he cares to do . "
139103	139106	139117	139117	he	4064	" God ! "
139110	139113	139521	139521	she	323	" Damn ! "
139517	139520	139521	139521	she	323	" Rag , "
139524	139530	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" something 's the matter ? "
139531	139536	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Well — yes . "
139537	139541	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" The house ? "
139542	139548	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Yes — the house . "
139556	139570	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Old man , why are you so prejudiced against a bigger house ? "
139571	139591	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Oh , because the one we have bores me , and the next one will bore me more . "
139592	139597	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" But try it . "
139598	139605	139610	139610	she	323	" I do n't want to . "
139606	139609	139622	139622	he	4092	" Well , "
139617	139621	139622	139622	he	4092	" And then , "
139625	139633	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" what are we going to do ? "
139634	139641	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Going to do — when ? "
139642	139649	139659	139659	she	323	" After the new house — — "
139650	139658	139662	139662	He	4092	" I 'm going to open out , "
139667	139690	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" I want to open out . I want you to take your place in the world , the place you deserve . "
139691	139698	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" A four - footman place ? "
139699	139709	139720	139720	he	4092	" Oh ! the house is only a means . "
139715	139719	139720	139720	he	4092	" A means , "
139723	139757	139758	139758	She	323	" to what ? Look here , Marjorie , what do you think you are up to with me and yourself ? What do you see me doing — in the years ahead ? "
139772	139785	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" At first I suppose you are going on with your researches . "
139786	139789	139758	139758	She	323	" Well ? "
139790	139808	139758	139758	She	323	" Then —— I must tell you what I think of you , Rag . Politics — — "
139809	139813	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Good Lord ! "
139814	139828	139758	139758	She	323	" You 've a sort of power . You could make things noble . "
139829	139835	139758	139758	She	323	" And then ? Office ? "
139836	139848	139549	139549	Marjorie	323	" Why not ? Look at the little men they are . "
139849	139858	139868	139868	He	4092	" And then perhaps a still bigger house ? "
139859	139867	139881	139881	he	4092	" You 're not fair to me . "
139877	139880	139881	139881	he	4092	" Marjorie ! "
139884	139904	139916	139916	he	4092	" You see —— We are n't going to do any of those things at all .... No ! ... "
139905	139915	139916	139916	he	4092	" I ca n't go on with my researches , "
139919	140100	140117	140117	he	4094	" That 's what you do n't understand . I 'm not able to get back to work . I shall never do any good research again . That 's the real trouble , Marjorie , and it makes all the difference . As for politics —— I ca n't touch politics . I despise politics . I think this empire and the monarchy and Lords and Commons and patriotism and social reform and all the rest of it , silly , silly beyond words ; temporary , accidental , foolish , a mere stop - gap — like a gipsey 's roundabout in a place where one will presently build a house .... You do n't help make the house by riding on the roundabout .... There 's no clear knowledge — no clear purpose .... Only research matters — and expression perhaps — I suppose expression is a sort of research — until we get that — that sufficient knowledge . And you see , I ca n't take up my work again . I 've lost something .... "
140104	140116	140117	140117	he	4094	" I 've got into this stupid struggle for winning money , "
140121	140300	140308	140308	she	4095	" and I feel like a woman must feel who 's made a success of prostitution . I 've been prostituted . I feel like some one fallen and diseased .... Business and prostitution ; they 're the same thing . All business is a sort of prostitution , all prostitution is a sort of business . Why should one sell one 's brains any more than one sells one 's body ? ... It 's so easy to succeed if one has good brains and cares to do it , and does n't let one 's attention or imagination wander — and it 's so degrading . Hopelessly degrading .... I 'm sick of this life , Marjorie . I do n't want to buy things . I 'm sick of buying . I 'm at an end . I 'm clean at an end . It 's exactly as though suddenly in walking through a great house one came on a passage that ended abruptly in a door , which opened — on nothing ! Nothing ! "
140301	140307	140308	140308	she	4095	" This is a mood , "
140314	140357	140370	140370	she	4095	" It is n't a mood , it 's a fact .... I 've got nothing ahead , and I do n't know how to get back . My life 's no good to me any more . I 've spent myself . "
140366	140369	140370	140370	she	4095	" But , "
140373	140379	140384	140384	he	4096	" this is a mood . "
140380	140383	140398	140398	He	4096	" No , "
140387	140397	140475	140475	she	4095	" no mood , but conviction . I know .... "
140471	140474	140475	140475	she	4095	" Rag , "
140478	140579	140587	140587	she	4095	" I do n't know what to say . This is n't so much of a surprise .... I felt that somehow life was disappointing you , that I was disappointing you . I 've felt it endless times , but more so lately . I have n't perhaps dared to let myself know just how much .... But is n't it what life is ? Does n't every wife disappoint her husband ? We 're none of us inexhaustible . After all , we 've had a good time ; is n't it a little ungrateful to forget ? ... "
140580	140586	140587	140587	she	4095	" Look here , Rag , "
140590	140615	140620	140620	he	4095	" I do n't know what to do . If I did know , I would do it .... What are we to do ? "
140616	140619	140620	140620	he	4095	" Think , "
140623	140634	140647	140647	he	4095	" We 've got to live as well as think . "
140635	140646	140620	140620	he	4095	" It 's the immense troublesome futility of — everything , "
140650	140709	140587	140587	she	4095	" Well — let us cease to be futile . Let us do . You say there is no grip for you in research , that you despise politics .... There 's no end of trouble and suffering . Can not we do social work , social reform , change the lives of others less fortunate than ourselves .... "
140710	140724	140620	140620	he	4095	" Who are we that we should tamper with the lives of others ? "
140725	140732	140742	140742	he	4095	" But one must do something . "
140738	140741	140587	140587	she	4095	" No , "
140744	140796	140801	140801	she	4095	" that 's the universal blunder nowadays . One must do the right thing . And we do n't know the right thing , Marjorie . That 's the very heart of the trouble .... Does this life satisfy you ? If it did would you always be so restless ? ... "
140797	140800	140801	140801	she	4095	" But , "
140804	140813	140587	140587	she	4095	" think of the good things in life ? "
140814	140932	140940	140940	She	4095	" It 's just the good , the exquisite things in life , that make me rebel against this life we are leading . It 's because I 've seen the streaks of gold that I know the rest for dirt . When I go cheating and scheming to my office , and come back to find you squandering yourself upon a horde of chattering , overdressed women , when I think that that is our substance and everyday and what we are , then it is I remember most the deep and beautiful things .... It is impossible , dear , it is intolerable that life was made beautiful for us — just for these vulgarities . "
140933	140939	140940	140940	She	4095	" Is n't there — — "
140943	140948	141033	141033	He	4104	" Love — still ? "
140949	141032	141051	141051	he	4104	" But —— Has it been love ? Love is a thing that grows . But we took it — as people take flowers out of a garden , cut them off , put them in water .... How much of our daily life has been love ? How much of it mere consequences of the love we 've left behind us ? ... We 've just cohabited and ' made love'—you and I — and thought of a thousand other things .... "
141039	141050	141051	141051	he	4104	" Oh , I love a thousand things about you , "
141054	141136	141161	141161	she	4095	" But do I love you , Marjorie ? Have I got you ? Have n't I lost you — haven't we both lost something , the very heart of it all ? Do you think that we were just cheated by instinct , that there was n't something in it we felt and thought was there ? And where is it now ? Where is that brightness and wonder , Marjorie , and the pride and the immense unlimited hope ? "
141156	141160	141192	141192	he	4104	" Oh Rag ! "
141187	141191	141192	141192	he	4104	" My dear , "
141195	141258	141277	141277	she	4095	" my dear ! why do you always want to turn love into — touches ? ... Stand up again . Stand up there , my dear ; do n't think I 've ceased to love you , but stand up there and let me talk to you as one man to another . If we let this occasion slide to embraces .... "
141272	141276	141277	141277	she	4095	" Go on , "
141280	141284	141379	141379	He	4104	" go on . "
141285	141378	141574	141574	He	4105	" I feel now that all our lives now , Marjorie —— We have come to a crisis . I feel that now —— now is the time . Either we shall save ourselves now or we shall never save ourselves . It is as if something had gathered and accumulated and could wait no longer . If we do not seize this opportunity —— Then our lives will go on as they have gone on , will become more and more a matter of small excitements and elaborate comforts and distraction .... "
141390	141573	141574	141574	He	4105	" Oh ! why should the life of every day conquer us ? Why should generation after generation of men have these fine beginnings , these splendid dreams of youth , attempt so much , achieve so much and then , then become — this ! Look at this room , this litter of little satisfactions ! Look at your pretty books there , a hundred minds you have pecked at , bright things of the spirit that attracted you as jewels attract a jackdaw . Look at the glass and silver , and that silk from China ! And we are in the full tide of our years , Marjorie . Now is the very crown and best of our lives . And this is what we do , we sample , we accumulate . For this we loved , for this we hoped . Do you remember when we were young — that life seemed so splendid — it was intolerable we should ever die ? ... The splendid dream ! The intimations of greatness ! ... The miserable failure ! "
141579	141627	141634	141634	Marjorie	323	" I wo n't stand it , Marjorie . I wo n't endure it . Somehow , in some way , I will get out of this life — and you with me . I have been brooding upon this and brooding , but now I know .... "
141628	141632	141634	141634	Marjorie	323	" But how ? "
141649	141652	141574	141574	He	4105	" How ? "
141653	141670	141574	141574	He	4105	" We must get out of its constant interruptions , its incessant vivid , petty appeals .... "
141671	141680	141634	141634	Marjorie	323	" We might go away — to Switzerland . "
141681	141717	141734	141734	She	323	" We went to Switzerland . Did n't we agree — it was our second honeymoon . It is n't a honeymoon we need . No , we 'll have to go further than that . "
141754	141757	141734	141734	She	323	" Where ? "
141758	141764	141734	141734	She	323	" Ever so much further . "
141765	141768	141734	141734	She	323	" Where ? "
141769	141775	141734	141734	She	323	" I do n't know . "
141776	141785	141822	141822	His	4106	" You do . You 've planned something . "
141786	141821	141828	141828	he	4106	" I do n't know , Marjorie . At least — I have n't made up my mind . Where it is very lonely . Cold and remote . Away from all this — — "
141834	141849	141941	141941	he	4106	" Oh ! God ! how I want to get out of all this ! "
141934	141940	141941	141941	he	4106	" I have been ranting , "
141944	141993	142015	142015	she	323	" I feel I 've been — eloquent . You make me feel like an actor - manager , in a play by Capes .... You are the most difficult person for me to talk to in all the world — because you mean so much to me . "
142006	142014	142015	142015	she	323	" I must n't touch your hand , "
142018	142024	142085	142085	his	4106	" I want to explain . "
142025	142032	142085	142085	his	4106	" You 've got to explain . "
142033	142056	142085	142085	his	4106	" I 've got quite a definite plan .... But a sort of terror seized me . It was like — shyness . "
142057	142068	142081	142081	He	4106	" I know . I knew you had a plan . "
142069	142080	142179	142179	she	323	" You see .... I mean to go to Labrador . "
142173	142178	142179	142179	she	323	" But how long ? "
142183	142191	142127	142127	his	4106	" The better part of a year . "
142192	142199	142204	142204	he	4106	" And we are to talk ? "
142200	142203	142204	142204	he	4106	" Yes , "
142207	142224	142127	142127	his	4106	" talk and think ourselves together — oh!—the old phrases carry it all — find God .... "
142225	142238	142245	142245	he	4106	" It is what I dreamt of , Rag , years ago . "
142239	142244	142245	142245	he	4106	" Will you come , "
142248	142254	142290	142290	she	323	" out of all this ? "
142284	142289	142290	142290	she	323	" But , Rag , "
142293	142317	142323	142323	he	4106	" this is dreaming . We are not free . There are the children ! Rag ! We can not leave the children ! "
142318	142322	142323	142323	he	4106	" We can , "
142326	142330	142290	142290	she	323	" We must . "
142331	142338	142290	142290	she	323	" But , my dear!—our duty ! "
142339	142577	142323	142323	he	4106	" Is it a mother 's duty always to keep with her children ? They will be looked after , their lives are organized , there is my mother close at hand .... What is the good of having children at all — unless their world is to be better than our world ? ... What are we doing to save them from the same bathos as this — to which we have come ? We give them food and health and pictures and lessons , that 's all very well while they are just little children ; but we 've got no religion to give them , no aim , no sense of a general purpose . What is the good of bread and health — and no worship ? ... What can we say to them when they ask us why we brought them into the world?—We happened — you happened . What are we to tell them when they demand the purpose of all this training , all these lessons ? When they ask what we are preparing them for ? Just that you , too , may have children ! Is that any answer ? Marjorie , it 's common - sense to try this over — to make this last supreme effort — just as it will be common - sense to separate if we ca n't get the puzzle solved together . "
142578	142581	142290	142290	she	323	" Separate ! "
142582	142600	142606	142606	He	4113	" Separate . Why not ? We can afford it . Of course , we shall separate . "
142601	142605	142620	142620	he	4113	" But Rag!—separate ! "
142612	142619	142620	142620	he	4113	" Life is not worth living , "
142623	142651	142911	142911	He	4122	" unless it has more to hold it together than ours has now . If we can not escape together , then — I will go alone . "
142919	142928	143361	143361	she	323	thinking—"soon we shall be out of all this . "
143356	143360	143361	143361	she	323	" Why not , "
143364	143369	143374	143374	he	4122	" wait a year ? "
143370	143373	143374	143374	he	4122	" No , "
143377	143446	143483	143483	she	323	" I wo n't . I mean we are to do this , and do it now , and nothing but sheer physical inability to do it will prevent my carrying it out .... And you ? Of course you are to come . I ca n't drag you shrieking all the way to Labrador ; short of that I 'm going to make you come with me . "
143471	143482	143483	143483	she	323	" You 've never forced my will like this before , "
143491	143494	143517	143517	he	4122	" Never . "
143508	143516	143517	143517	he	4122	" It has n't seemed necessary somehow , "
143524	143529	143537	143537	she	323	" Now it does . "
143530	143536	143537	143537	she	323	" This is something final , "
143540	143545	143577	143578	another woman	3301	" It is final . "
143589	143598	143604	143604	he	4122	" Whither thou goest I will go — — "
143599	143603	143635	143635	she	323	" In Labrador , "
143628	143634	143635	143635	she	323	" I am not sorry , "
143638	143673	144386	144386	Trafford	508	" not a bit sorry — but I am fearfully afraid . I shall dream they are ill .... Apart from that , it 's strange how you grip me and they do n't .... "
144335	144346	145674	145674	he	508	" There we shall have plenty of time for everything .... "
145663	145673	145674	145674	he	508	" They 've gone on with the first loads , "
145677	145702	145715	145715	she	323	" Get up , wrap yourself in a blanket , and come and bathe in the river . It 's as cold as ice . "
145708	145714	145727	145727	he	508	" Are n't you stiff ? "
145718	145726	145762	145762	she	323	" I was stiffer before I bathed , "
145752	145761	145781	145781	Trafford	508	" It 's woman 's work getting tea , "
145768	145779	145862	145862	she	323	" You ca n't be a squaw all at once , "
145856	145861	145862	145862	she	323	" But I say ! "
145874	145893	145900	145900	Trafford	508	" we have n't soap ! This is our last cake almost . I never thought of soap . "
145894	145898	145917	145917	he	508	" Nor I , "
145907	145916	145931	145931	Marjorie	323	" We do n't turn back for soap , "
145920	145929	145931	145931	Marjorie	323	" We do n't turn back for anything , "
145933	145945	145954	145954	Trafford	508	" Still — I did n't count on a soapless winter . "
145946	145952	145954	145954	Trafford	508	" I 'll manage something , "
145960	145965	146165	146165	Trafford	508	" Trust a chemist .... "
146160	146163	146165	146165	Trafford	508	" Now , "
146167	146174	146186	146186	Marjorie	323	" we ought to begin talking . "
146175	146184	146197	146197	Trafford	508	" There 's nothing much to do else , "
146188	146195	146215	146215	he	508	" Only one ca n't begin , "
146206	146214	146537	146537	Trafford	508	" We 're getting out of things , "
146528	146535	146537	146537	Trafford	508	" I do n't feel philosophical , "
146539	146545	146598	146599	the man	1016	" but I feel well . "
146546	146554	146537	146537	Trafford	508	" We 're getting out of things . "
146555	146566	146598	146599	the man	1016	" Suppose we are getting out of our problems ! ... "
146593	146596	146783	146783	Trafford	508	" Look , "
146774	146781	146790	146790	Marjorie	323	" Shall I take a shot ? "
146785	146788	146790	146790	Marjorie	323	" No , "
146800	146805	146835	146835	Trafford	508	" Let them be . "
146827	146833	147420	147420	Trafford	508	" Too long a shot , "
147414	147418	147420	147420	Trafford	508	" Here presently , "
147422	147429	147438	147438	Marjorie	323	" we shall be in peace . "
147430	147436	147438	147438	Marjorie	323	" It is very lonely , "
147440	147446	147420	147420	Trafford	508	" The nearer to God . "
147447	147461	147420	147420	Trafford	508	" Think ! Not one of these hills has ever had a name . "
147462	147465	147438	147438	Marjorie	323	" Well ? "
147466	147475	147564	147564	Marjorie	323	" It might be in some other planet . "
147476	147563	148025	148025	he	539	" Oh!—we'll christen them . That shall be Marjorie Ridge , and that Rag Valley . This space shall be — oh ! Bayswater ! Before we 've done with it , this place and every feature of it will be as familiar as Sussex Square . More so,—for half the houses there would be stranger to us , if we could see inside them , than anything in this wilderness .... As familiar , say — as your drawing - room . That 's better . "
148016	148024	148034	148034	Marjorie	323	" You 'll not sleep in this , "
148028	148032	148034	148034	Marjorie	323	" I will , "
148036	148044	148085	148085	her	323	" You 'll come back with us . "
148045	148049	148034	148034	Marjorie	323	" Not me . "
148050	148059	148085	148085	her	323	" There 'll be wolves come and howl . "
148060	148064	148085	148085	her	323	" Let 'em . "
148065	148082	148110	148110	Noyes	539	" They 'll come right up to the door here . Winter makes 'em hidjus bold . "
148088	148108	148110	148110	Noyes	539	" It 's that cold I 've known a man have his nose froze while he lay in bed , "
148112	148116	148146	148146	He	539	" Up here ? "
148117	148144	148392	148392	Noyes	539	" Down the coast . But they say it 's ' most as cold up here . Many 's the man it 's starved and froze . "
148412	148531	148537	148537	Marjorie	323	" You 've got everything there , everything . Suppose you feel a bit ill , you go out , and every block there 's a drug store got everything — all the new rem'dies — p'raps twenty , thirty sorts of rem'dy . Lit up , nice . And chaps in collars — like gentlemen . Or you feel a bit dully and you go into the streets and there 's people . Why ! when I was in New York I used to spend hours looking at the people . Hours ! And everything lit up , too . Sky signs ! Readin ' everywhere . You can spend hours and hours in New York — — "
148532	148535	148647	148647	Noyes	539	" London , "
148539	148645	148647	148647	Noyes	539	" Well , London — just going about and reading the things they stick up . Every blamed sort of thing . Or you say , let 's go somewhere . Let 's go out and be a bit lively . See ? Up you get on a car and there you are ! Great big restaurants , blazing with lights , and you ca n't think of a thing to eat they have n't got . Waiters all round you , dressed tremendous , fair asking you to have more . Or you say , let 's go to a theatre . Very likely , "
148654	148663	148670	148670	Trafford	508	" you order up one of these automobillies . "
148664	148668	148678	148678	Noyes	539	" By telephone , "
148672	148676	148678	148678	Noyes	539	" By telephone , "
148680	148728	148819	148819	Lean	540	" When I was in New York there was a telephone in each room in the hotel . Each room . I did n't use it ever , except once when they did n't answer — but there it was . I know about telephones all right .... "
148814	148818	148911	148911	he	540	" done something . "
148904	148910	148911	148911	he	540	" They got no children , "
148922	148942	148952	148952	Marjorie	323	" It worries them . Them as is Catholics goes pilgrimages , but these ai n't Catholics . See ? "
148943	148950	148952	148952	Marjorie	323	" I ca n't stand that , "
148954	148975	149001	149001	Mackenzie	538	" It touches my pride . I 've stood a good deal . Mr. Mackenzie ! ... Mr .... Mackenzie . "
148991	148999	149013	149013	she	323	" What is it , Mrs. Trafford ? "
149009	149012	149013	149013	she	323	" Four ! "
149016	149019	149029	149029	Marjorie	323	" Eh ? "
149020	149027	149031	149031	Mackenzie	538	" Three sons and a daughter , "
149046	149064	149074	149074	Trafford	394	" And you 've come from them to this .... Sir , what have you come for ? "
149065	149072	149080	149080	Their	984	" We want to be here , "
149085	149105	149151	149151	Noyes	539	" We wanted to be alone together . There was too much — over there — too much everything . "
149142	149149	149151	149151	Noyes	539	" Come back with us sir , "
149153	149160	149182	149182	he	539	" You 'll weary of it .... "
149172	149181	149241	149241	he	539	" I do n't care to leave ye , "
149231	149240	149250	149250	Trafford	394	" I do n't care to leave ye , "
149244	149248	149260	149260	Noyes	539	" Good luck ! "
149252	149258	149380	149380	He	539	" You 'll need it , "
149393	149402	149480	149480	he	539	" I do n't care to leave ye . "
149468	149479	149507	149507	He	539	" There is much to do before the weather breaks , "
149488	149506	149572	149572	He	539	" Then we can sit inside there and talk about the things we need to talk about . "
149511	149571	149572	149572	He	539	" Since we started , there has been so much to hold the attention . I remember a mood — an immense despair . I feel it 's still somewhere at the back of things , waiting to be dealt with . It 's our essential fact . But meanwhile we 've been busy , looking at fresh things . "
149575	149583	150310	150310	Trafford	394	" Now it will be different perhaps .... "
150300	150308	150310	150310	Trafford	394	" These things are so infernally interesting , "
150328	150356	150365	150365	Marjorie	323	" But we did n't come here to picnic . All this is eating us up . I have a memory of some immense tragic purpose — — "
150357	150363	150388	150388	he	4375	" That tin 's boiling ! "
150377	150387	150400	150400	Marjorie	323	" We 'll keep the wolf from the door , "
150391	150398	150400	150400	Marjorie	323	" Do n't talk of wolves ! "
150402	150434	150440	150440	Marjorie	323	" It is only when men have driven away the wolf from the door — oh ! altogether away , that they find despair in the sky ? I wonder — — "
150435	150438	150440	150440	Marjorie	323	" What ? "
150445	150498	150506	150506	Marjorie	323	" I wonder if there is nothing really in life but this , the food hunt and the love hunt . Is life just all hunger and need , and are we left with nothing — nothing at all — when these things are done ? ... We 're infernally uncomfortable here . "
150499	150504	150506	150506	Marjorie	323	" Oh , nonsense ! "
150508	150537	150545	150545	Marjorie	323	" Think of your carpets at home ! Think of the great , warm , beautiful house that was n't big enough!—And yet here , we 're happy . "
150538	150543	150545	150545	Marjorie	323	" We are happy , "
150552	150556	150506	150506	Marjorie	323	" Only — — "
150557	150560	150506	150506	Marjorie	323	" Yes . "
150561	150578	150545	150545	Marjorie	323	" I 'm afraid . And I long for the children . And the wind nips . "
150579	150658	150959	150959	Marjorie	323	" It may be those are good things for us . No ! This is just a lark as yet , Marjorie . It 's still fresh and full of distractions . The discomforts are amusing . Presently we 'll get used to it . Then we 'll talk out — what we have to talk out .... I say , would n't it keep and improve this goose of ours if we put in a little brandy ? "
150946	150957	150959	150959	Marjorie	323	" Where had we got to when we left England ? "
150961	150977	151018	151018	He	4386	" You could n't work , you could n't rest — you hated our life . "
150978	151017	151034	151034	he	4386	" Yes , I know . I had a violent hatred of the lives we were leading . I thought — we had to get away . To think .... But things do n't leave us alone here . "
151026	151033	151018	151018	He	4386	" Why did we come here ? "
151037	151047	150959	150959	Marjorie	323	" You wanted — to get out of things . "
151048	151161	151018	151018	He	4386	" Yes . But with you .... Have we , after all , got out of things at all ? I said coming up , perhaps we were leaving our own problem behind . In exchange for other problems — old problems men have had before . We 've got nearer necessity ; that 's all . Things press on us just as much . There 's nothing more fundamental in wild nature , nothing profounder — only something earlier . One does n't get out of life by going here or there .... But I wanted to get you away — from all things that had such a hold on you .... "
151178	151205	151018	151018	He	4386	" He went to the door , opened it , and stood looking out . Against a wan daylight the snow was falling noiselessly and steadily . "
151210	151214	151018	151018	He	4386	" he said .... "
151217	151262	150959	150959	Marjorie	323	" That was as far as they had got when the storms ceased and they came out again into an air inexpressibly fresh and sharp and sweet , and into a world blindingly clean and golden white under the rays of the morning sun . "
151271	151275	151018	151018	He	4386	" said Marjorie ; "
151303	151432	151437	151438	dear wife	4390	" One morning Trafford found the footmarks of some catlike creature in the snow near the bushes where he was accustomed to get firewood ; they led away very plainly up the hill , and after breakfast he took his knife and rifle and snowshoes and went after the lynx — for that he decided the animal must be . There was no urgent reason why he should want to kill a lynx , unless perhaps that killing it made the store shed a trifle safer ; but it was the first trail of any living thing for many days ; it promised excitement ; some primordial instinct perhaps urged him . The morning was a little overcast , and very cold between the gleams of wintry sunshine . "
151440	151459	151460	151460	I	0	" he said , and then as she remembered afterwards came back a dozen yards to kiss her . "
151466	151470	151502	151502	I	0	" he said . "
151494	151501	151502	151502	I	0	" He hesitated for a moment . "
151508	151556	151502	151502	I	0	" he repeated , and she had an instant 's wonder whether he hid from her the same dread of loneliness that she concealed . Or perhaps he only knew her secret . Up among the tumbled rocks he turned , and she was still watching him . "
151561	152744	151502	151502	I	0	" he cried and waved , and the willow thickets closed about him . She forced herself to the petty duties of the day , made up the fire from the pile he had left for her , set water to boil , put the hut in order , brought out sheets and blankets to air and set herself to wash up . She wished she had been able to go with him . The sky cleared presently , and the low December sun lit all the world about her , but it left her spirit desolate . She did not expect him to return until mid - day , and she sat herself down on a log before the fire to darn a pair of socks as well as she could . For a time this unusual occupation held her attention and then her hands became slow and at last inactive , and she fell into reverie . She thought at first of her children and what they might be doing , in England across there to the east it would be about five hours later , four o'clock in the afternoon , and the children would be coming home through the warm muggy London sunshine with Fraulein Otto to tea . She wondered if they had the proper clothes , if they were well ; were they perhaps quarrelling or being naughty or skylarking gaily across the Park . Of course Fraulein Otto was all right , quite to be trusted , absolutely trustworthy , and their grandmother would watch for a flushed face or an irrational petulance or any of the little signs that herald trouble with more than a mother 's instinctive alertness . No need to worry about the children , no need whatever .... The world of London opened out behind these thoughts ; it was so queer to think that she was in almost the same latitude as the busy bright traffic of the autumn season in Kensington Gore ; that away there in ten thousand cleverly furnished drawing - rooms the ringing tea things were being set out for the rustling advent of smart callers and the quick leaping gossip . And there would be all sorts of cakes and little things ; for a while her mind ran on cakes and little things , and she thought in particular whether it was n't time to begin cooking .... Not yet . What was it she had been thinking about ? Ah ! the Solomonsons and the Capeses and the Bernards and the Carmels and the Lees . Would they talk of her and Trafford ? It would be strange to go back to it all . Would they go back to it all ? She found herself thinking intently of Trafford . What a fine human being he was ! And how touchingly human ! The thoughts of his moments of irritation , his baffled silences , filled her with a wild passion of tenderness . She had disappointed him ; all that life failed to satisfy him . Dear master of her life ! what was it he needed ? She too was n't satisfied with life , but while she had been able to assuage herself with a perpetual series of petty excitements , theatres , new books and new people , meetings , movements , dinners , shows , he had grown to an immense discontent . He had most of the things men sought , wealth , respect , love , children .... So many men might have blunted their heart - ache with — adventures . There were pretty women , clever women , unoccupied women . She felt she would n't have minded — much — if it made him happy .... It was so wonderful he loved her still .... It was n't that he lacked occupation ; on the whole he overworked . His business interests were big and wide . Ought he to go into politics ? Why was it that the researches that had held him once , could hold him now no more ? That was the real pity of it . Was she to blame for that ? She could n't state a case against herself , and yet she felt she was to blame . She had taken him away from those things , forced him to make money .... She sat chin on hand staring into the fire , the sock forgotten on her knee . She could not weigh justice between herself and him . If he was unhappy it was her fault . She knew if he was unhappy it was no excuse that she had not known , had been misled , had a right to her own instincts and purposes . She had got to make him happy . But what was she to do , what was there for her to do ? ... Only he could work out his own salvation , and until he had light , all she could do was to stand by him , help him , cease to irritate him , watch , wait . Anyhow she could at least mend his socks as well as possible , so that the threads would not chafe him .... She flashed to her feet . What was that ? It seemed to her she had heard the sound of a shot , and a quick brief wake of echoes . She looked across the icy waste of the river , and then up the tangled slopes of the mountain . Her heart was beating very fast . It must have been up there , and no doubt he had killed his beast . Some shadow of doubt she would not admit crossed that obvious suggestion . This wilderness was making her as nervously responsive as a creature of the wild . Came a second shot ; this time there was no doubt of it . Then the desolate silence closed about her again . She stood for a long time staring at the shrubby slopes that rose to the barren rock wilderness of the purple mountain crest . She sighed deeply at last , and set herself to make up the fire and prepare for the mid - day meal . Once far away across the river she heard the howl of a wolf . Time seemed to pass very slowly that day . She found herself going repeatedly to the space between the day tent and the sleeping hut from which she could see the stunted wood that had swallowed him up , and after what seemed a long hour her watch told her it was still only half - past twelve . And the fourth or fifth time that she went to look out she was set atremble again by the sound of a third shot . And then at regular intervals out of that distant brown purple jumble of thickets against the snow came two more shots . "
152749	152753	152796	152796	He	4391	" she said , "
152758	152795	152796	152796	He	4391	" and stood rigid . Then she became active , seized the rifle that was always at hand when she was alone , fired into the sky and stood listening . Prompt come an answering shot . "
152800	152804	152808	152808	he	4391	" said Marjorie . "
152817	153677	152808	152808	he	4391	" She was for starting at once , and then remembered this was not the way of the wilderness . She thought and moved very rapidly . Her mind catalogued possible requirements , rifle , hunting knife , the oilskin bag with matches , and some chunks of dry paper , the rucksack — and he would be hungry . She took a saucepan and a huge chunk of cheese and biscuit . Then a brandy flask is sometimes handy — one never knows . Though nothing was wrong , of course . Needles and stout thread , and some cord . Snowshoes . A waterproof cloak could be easily carried . Her light hatchet for wood . She cast about to see if there was anything else . She had almost forgotten cartridges — and a revolver . Nothing more . She kicked a stray brand or so into the fire , put on some more wood , damped the fire with an armful of snow to make it last longer , and set out towards the willows into which he had vanished . There was a rustling and snapping of branches as she pushed her way through the bushes , a little stir that died insensibly into quiet again ; and then the camping place became very still .... Scarcely a sound occurred , except for the little shuddering and stirring of the fire , and the reluctant , infrequent drip from the icicles along the sunny edge of the log hut roof . About one o'clock the amber sunshine faded out altogether , a veil of clouds thickened and became greyly ominous , and a little after two the first flakes of a snowstorm fell hissing into the fire . A wind rose and drove the multiplying snowflakes in whirls and eddies before it . The icicles ceased to drip , but one or two broke and fell with a weak tinkling . A deep soughing , a shuddering groaning of trees and shrubs , came ever and again out of the ravine , and the powdery snow blew like puffs of smoke from the branches . By four the fire was out , and the snow was piling high in the darkling twilight against tent and hut .... Trafford 's trail led Marjorie through the thicket of dwarf willows and down to the gully of the rivulet which they had called Marjorie Trickle ; it had long since become a trough of snow - covered rotten ice ; the trail crossed this and , turning sharply uphill , went on until it was clear of shrubs and trees , and in the windy open of the upper slopes it crossed a ridge and came over the lip of a large desolate valley with slopes of ice and icy snow . Here she spent some time in following his loops back on the homeward trail before she saw what was manifestly the final trail running far away out across the snow , with the spoor of the lynx , a lightly - dotted line , to the right of it . She followed this suggestion of the trail , put on her snowshoes , and shuffled her way across this valley , which opened as she proceeded . She hoped that over the ridge she would find Trafford , and scanned the sky for the faintest discolouration of a fire , but there was none . That seemed odd to her , but the wind was in her face , and perhaps it beat the smoke down . Then as her eyes scanned the hummocky ridge ahead , she saw something , something very intent and still , that brought her heart into her mouth . It was a big , grey wolf , standing with back haunched and head down , watching and winding something beyond there , out of sight . Marjorie had an instinctive fear of wild animals , and it still seemed dreadful to her that they should go at large , uncaged . She suddenly wanted Trafford violently , wanted him by her side . Also she thought of leaving the trail , going back to the bushes . She had to take herself in hand . In the wastes one did not fear wild beasts . One had no fear of them . But why not fire a shot to let him know she was near ? The beast flashed round with an animal 's instantaneous change of pose , and looked at her . For a couple of seconds , perhaps , woman and brute regarded one another across a quarter of a mile of snowy desolation . Suppose it came towards her ! She would fire — and she would fire at it . She made a guess at the range and aimed very carefully . She saw the snow fly two yards ahead of the grisly shape , and then in an instant it had vanished over the crest . She reloaded , and stood for a moment waiting for Trafford 's answer . No answer came . "
153680	153684	152808	152808	he	4391	" she whispered , "
153685	154308	152808	152808	he	4391	queer!"—and suddenly such a horror of anticipation assailed her that she started running and floundering through the snow to escape it . Twice she called his name , and once she just stopped herself from firing a shot . Over the ridge she would find him . Surely she would find him over the ridge . She found herself among rocks , and there was a beaten and trampled place where Trafford must have waited and crouched . Then on and down a slope of tumbled boulders . There came a patch where he had either thrown himself down or fallen . It seemed to her he must have been running .... Suddenly , a hundred feet or so away , she saw a patch of violently disturbed snow — snow stained a dreadful colour , a snow of scarlet crystals ! Three strides and Trafford was in sight . She had a swift conviction he was dead . He was lying in a crumpled attitude on a patch of snow between convergent rocks , and the lynx , a mass of blood smeared silvery fur , was in some way mixed up with him . She saw as she came nearer that the snow was disturbed round about them , and discoloured copiously , yellow widely , and in places bright red , with congealed and frozen blood . She felt no fear now , and no emotion ; all her mind was engaged with the clear , bleak perception of the fact before her . She did not care to call to him again . His head was hidden by the lynx 's body , it was as if he was burrowing underneath the creature ; his legs were twisted about each other in a queer , unnatural attitude . Then , as she dropped off a boulder , and came nearer , Trafford moved . A hand came out and gripped the rifle beside him ; he suddenly lifted a dreadful face , horribly scarred and torn , and crimson with frozen blood ; he pushed the grey beast aside , rose on an elbow , wiped his sleeve across his eyes , stared at her , grunted , and flopped forward . He had fainted . She was now as clear - minded and as self - possessed as a woman in a shop . In another moment she was kneeling by his side . She saw , by the position of his knife and the huge rip in the beast 's body , that he had stabbed the lynx to death as it clawed his head ; he must have shot and wounded it and then fallen upon it . His knitted cap was torn to ribbons , and hung upon his neck . Also his leg was manifestly injured ; how , she could not tell . It was chiefly evident he must freeze if he lay here . It seemed to her that perhaps he had pulled the dead brute over him to protect his torn skin from the extremity of cold . The lynx was already rigid , its clumsy paws asprawl — the torn skin and clot upon Trafford 's face was stiff as she put her hands about his head to raise him . She turned him over on his back — how heavy he seemed!—and forced brandy between his teeth . Then , after a moment 's hesitation , she poured a little brandy on his wounds . She glanced at his leg , which was surely broken , and back at his face . Then she gave him more brandy and his eyelids flickered . He moved his hand weakly . "
154312	154316	152808	152808	he	4391	" he said , "
154323	154445	154446	154446	I	0	" She gave him brandy once again , wiped his face and glanced at his leg . Something ought to be done to that she thought . But things must be done in order . She stared up at the darkling sky with its grey promise of snow , and down the slopes of the mountain . Clearly they must stay the night here . They were too high for wood among these rocks , but three or four hundred yards below there were a number of dwarfed fir trees . She had brought an axe , so that a fire was possible . Should she go back to camp and get the tent ? Trafford was trying to speak again . "
154450	154454	154446	154446	I	0	" he said . "
154457	154458	154446	154446	I	0	" "
154471	154633	154446	154446	I	0	" Was he able to advise her ? She looked at him , and then perceived she must bind up his head and face . She knelt behind him and raised his head on her knee . She had a thick silk neck muffler , and this she supplemented by a band she cut and tore from her inner vest . She bound this , still warm from her body , about him , wrapped her cloak round him . The next thing was a fire . Five yards away , perhaps , a great mass of purple gabbro hung over a patch of nearly snowless moss . A hummock to the westward offered shelter from the weakly bitter wind , the icy draught , that was soughing down the valley . Always in Labrador , if you can , you camp against a rock surface ; it shelters you from the wind , reflects your fire , guards your back . "
154636	154640	154446	154446	I	0	" she said . "
154644	154648	154446	154446	I	0	" said Trafford . "
154651	154656	154446	154446	I	0	" she cried sharply . "
154664	154668	154446	154446	I	0	" he said . "
154671	154672	154446	154446	I	0	" "
154675	154684	154687	154687	I	0	" she said , and shook his shoulder . "
154697	154698	154687	154687	I	0	" "
154705	154714	154687	154687	I	0	" said Trafford , and opened his eyes . "
154717	154721	154687	154687	I	0	" he asked . "
154724	154734	154737	154737	me	0	" He remained quite quiet for a second perhaps . "
154739	154743	154737	154737	me	0	" he said . "
154749	154750	154737	154737	me	0	" "
154753	154757	154776	154776	you	4393	" she said . "
154779	154787	154776	154776	you	4393	" He seemed troubled to express himself . "
154790	154794	154806	154806	help	4397	" she said . "
154808	154809	154806	154806	help	4397	" "
154813	154821	154822	154822	You	4398	" He nodded his head and winced . "
154827	154831	154859	154860	a fool	5573	" he said . "
154848	154856	154879	154879	Kids	4402	" A tear oozed from his eye . "
154881	154896	154897	154899	You old coward	4403	" She stared at him and her spirit was a luminous mist of tears . "
154901	154929	154935	154936	old man	4913	" she said in his ear , and kissed the little patch of rough and bloody cheek beneath his eye . Then she knelt up beside him . "
154938	154942	154970	154970	You	0	" she said . "
154964	154969	154970	154970	You	0	" He answered obstinately : "
154975	154976	154977	154977	I	0	" "
154984	154988	154977	154977	I	0	" she answered , "
154991	155019	154977	154977	I	0	" He made an enormous effort , and then with her quick help and with his back to her knee , had raised himself on his elbows . "
155023	155027	154977	154977	I	0	" he asked . "
155032	155033	154977	154977	I	0	" "
155036	155037	154977	154977	I	0	" "
155041	155042	154977	154977	I	0	" "
155068	155080	154977	154977	I	0	" He smiled , and she kissed his bandaged face again . "
155085	155089	154977	154977	I	0	" he apologized , "
155096	155194	155206	155207	A fool	5573	" She stood up again , thought , put his rifle and knife to his hand for fear of that lurking wolf , abandoning her own rifle with an effort , and went striding and leaping from rock to rock towards the trees below . She made the chips fly , and was presently towing three venerable pine dwarfs , bumping over rock and crevice , back to Trafford . She flung them down , stood for a moment bright and breathless , then set herself to hack off the splints he needed from the biggest stem . "
155197	155205	155226	155226	Marjorie	323	" she said , coming to him . "
155209	155213	155226	155226	Marjorie	323	" he remarked , "
155228	155282	155226	155226	Marjorie	323	" She lugged his leg out straight , put it into the natural and least painful pose , padded it with moss and her torn handkerchief , and bound it up . As she did so a handful of snowflakes came whirling about them . She was now braced up to every possibility . "
155287	155292	155226	155226	Marjorie	323	" she said grimly , "
155297	155324	155786	155786	I	0	" and went on with her bone - setting . He was badly weakened by pain and shock , and once he swore at her sharply . "
155327	155785	155786	155786	I	0	" he said . She rolled him over on his chest , and left him to struggle to the shelter of the rock while she went for more wood . The sky alarmed her . The mountains up the valley were already hidden by driven rags of slaty snowstorms . This time she found a longer but easier path for dragging her boughs and trees ; she determined she would not start the fire until nightfall , nor waste any time in preparing food until then . There were dead boughs for kindling — more than enough . It was snowing quite fast by the time she got up to him with her second load , and a premature twilight already obscured and exaggerated the rocks and mounds about her . She gave some of her cheese to Trafford , and gnawed some herself on her way down to the wood again . She regretted that she had brought neither candles nor lantern , because then she might have kept on until the cold of night stopped her , and she reproached herself bitterly because she had brought no tea . She could forgive herself the lantern , she had never expected to be out after dark , but the tea was inexcusable . She muttered self - reproaches while she worked like two men among the trees , panting puffs of mist that froze upon her lips and iced the knitted wool that covered her chin . Why do n't they teach a girl to handle an axe ? ... When at last the wolfish cold of the Labrador night had come , it found Trafford and Marjorie seated almost warmly on a bed of pine boughs between the sheltering dark rock behind and a big but well husbanded fire in front , drinking a queer - tasting but not unsavory soup of lynx - flesh , that she had fortified with the remainder of the brandy . Then they tried roast lynx and ate a little , and finished with some scraps of cheese and deep draughts of hot water . Then — oh Tyburnia and Chelsea and all that is becoming!—they smoked Trafford 's pipe for alternate minutes , and Marjorie found great comfort in it . The snowstorm poured incessantly out of the darkness to become flakes of burning fire in the light of the flames , flakes that vanished magically , but it only reached them and wetted them in occasional gusts . What did it matter for the moment if the dim snow - heaps rose and rose about them ? A glorious fatigue , an immense self - satisfaction possessed Marjorie ; she felt that they had both done well . "
155796	155806	155824	155824	I	0	" she said at last — a thought matured . "
155809	155822	155824	155824	I	0	" Trafford had the pipe and did not speak for a moment . "
155826	155832	155850	155850	I	0	" he said at last . "
155842	155849	155824	155824	I	0	" He added after a pause : "

155921	155947	155948	155948	I	0	" she asked suddenly . He seemed not to hear her ; then his lips twitched and he made a feeble movement for her hand . "
155952	157711	157721	157721	God	249	" he said .... She slept , but on a spring as it were , lest the fire should fall . She replenished it with boughs , tucked in the half - burnt logs , and went to sleep again . Then it seemed to her that some invisible hand was pouring a thin spirit on the flames that made them leap and crackle and spread north and south until they filled the heavens . Her eyes were open and the snowstorm overpast , leaving the sky clear , and all the westward heaven alight with the trailing , crackling , leaping curtains of the Aurora , brighter than she had ever seen them before . Quite clearly visible beyond the smoulder of the fire , a wintry waste of rock and snow , boulder beyond boulder , passed into a dun obscurity . The mountain to the right of them lay long and white and stiff , a shrouded death . All earth was dead and waste and nothing , and the sky alive and coldly marvellous , signalling and astir . She watched the changing , shifting colours , and they made her think of the gathering banners of inhuman hosts , the stir and marshalling of icy giants for ends stupendous and indifferent to all the trivial impertinence of man 's existence .... That night the whole world of man seemed small and shallow and insecure to her , beyond comparison . One came , she thought , but just a little way out of its warm and sociable cities hither , and found this homeless wilderness ; one pricked the thin appearances of life with microscope or telescope and came to an equal strangeness . All the pride and hope of human life goes to and fro in a little shell of air between this ancient globe of rusty nickel - steel and the void of space ; faint specks we are within a film ; we quiver between the atom and the infinite , being hardly more substantial than the glow within an oily skin that drifts upon the water . The wonder and the riddle of it ! Here she and Trafford were ! Phantasmal shapes of unsubstantial fluid thinly skinned against evaporation and wrapped about with woven wool and the skins of beasts , that yet reflected and perceived , suffered and sought to understand ; that held a million memories , framed thoughts that plumbed the deeps of space and time,—and another day of snow or icy wind might leave them just scattered bones and torn rags gnawed by a famishing wolf ! ... She felt a passionate desire to pray .... She glanced at Trafford beside her , and found him awake and staring . His face was very pale and strange in that livid , flickering light . She would have spoken , and then she saw his lips were moving , and something , something she did not understand , held her back from doing so . The bleak , slow dawn found Marjorie intently busy . She had made up the fire , boiled water and washed and dressed Trafford 's wounds , and made another soup of lynx . But Trafford had weakened in the night , the stuff nauseated him , he refused it and tried to smoke and was sick , and then sat back rather despairfully after a second attempt to persuade her to leave him there to die . This failure of his spirit distressed her and a little astonished her , but it only made her more resolute to go through with her work . She had awakened cold , stiff and weary , but her fatigue vanished with movement ; she toiled for an hour replenishing her pile of fuel , made up the fire , put his gun ready to his hand , kissed him , abused him lovingly for the trouble he gave her until his poor torn face lit in response , and then parting on a note of cheerful confidence set out to return to the hut . She found the way not altogether easy to make out , wind and snow had left scarcely a trace of their tracks , and her mind was full of the stores she must bring and the possibility of moving him nearer to the hut . She was startled to see by the fresh , deep spoor along the ridge how near the wolf had dared approach them in the darkness .... Ever and again Marjorie had to halt and look back to get her direction right . As it was she came through the willow scrub nearly half a mile above the hut , and had to follow the steep bank of the frozen river down . At one place she nearly slipped upon an icy slope of rock . One possibility she did not dare to think of during that time ; a blizzard now would cut her off absolutely from any return to Trafford . Short of that she believed she could get through . Her quick mind was full of all she had to do . At first she had thought chiefly of his immediate necessities , of food and some sort of shelter . She had got a list of things in her head — meat extract , bandages , corrosive sublimate by way of antiseptic , brandy , a tin of beef , some bread and so forth ; she went over that several times to be sure of it , and then for a time she puzzled about a tent . She thought she could manage a bale of blankets on her back , and that she could rig a sleeping tent for herself and Trafford with one and some bent sticks . The big tent would be too much to strike and shift . And then her mind went on to a bolder enterprise , which was to get him home . The nearer she could bring him to the log hut , the nearer they would be to supplies . She cast about for some sort of sledge . The snow was too soft and broken for runners , especially among the trees , but if she could get a flat of smooth wood she thought she might be able to drag him . She decided to try the side of her bunk . She could easily get that off . She would have , of course , to run it edgewise through the thickets and across the ravine , but after that she would have almost clear going until she reached the steep place of broken rocks within two hundred yards of him . The idea of a sledge grew upon her , and she planned to nail a rope along the edge and make a kind of harness for herself . She found the camping - place piled high with drifted snow , which had invaded tent and hut , and that some beast , a wolverine she guessed , had been into the hut , devoured every candle - end and the uppers of Trafford 's well - greased second boots , and had then gone to the corner of the store shed and clambered up to the stores . She made no account of its depredations there , but set herself to make a sledge and get her supplies together . There was a gleam of sunshine , but she did not like the look of the sky , and she was horribly afraid of what might be happening to Trafford . She carried her stuff through the wood and across the ravine , and returned for her improvised sledge . She was still struggling with that among the trees when it began to snow again . It was hard then not to be frantic in her efforts . As it was , she packed her stuff so loosely on the planking that she had to repack it , and she started without putting on her snowshoes , and floundered fifty yards before she discovered that omission . The snow was now falling fast , darkling the sky and hiding everything but objects close at hand , and she had to use all her wits to determine her direction ; she knew she must go down a long slope and then up to the ridge , and it came to her as a happy inspiration that if she bore to the left she might strike some recognizable vestige of her morning 's trail . She had read of people walking in circles when they have no light or guidance , and that troubled her until she bethought herself of the little compass on her watch chain . By that she kept her direction . She wished very much she had timed herself across the waste , so that she could tell when she approached the ridge . Soon her back and shoulders were aching violently , and the rope across her chest was tugging like some evil - tempered thing . But she did not dare to rest . The snow was now falling thick and fast , the flakes traced white spirals and made her head spin , so that she was constantly falling away to the south - westward and then correcting herself by the compass . She tried to think how this zig - zagging might affect her course , but the snow whirls confused her mind and a growing anxiety would not let her pause to think . She felt blinded ; it seemed to be snowing inside her eyes so that she wanted to rub them . Soon the ground must rise to the ridge , she told herself ; it must surely rise . Then the sledge came bumping at her heels and she perceived she was going down hill . She consulted the compass , and she found she was facing south . She turned sharply to the right again . The snowfall became a noiseless , pitiless torture to sight and mind . The sledge behind her struggled to hold her back , and the snow balled under her snowshoes . She wanted to stop and rest , take thought , sit for a moment . She struggled with herself and kept on . She tried walking with shut eyes , and tripped and came near sprawling . "
157715	157719	157721	157721	God	249	" she cried , "
157723	158106	159888	159888	you	4411	" too stupefied for more articulate prayers . Would the rise of the ground to the ribs of rock never come ? A figure , black and erect , stood in front of her suddenly , and beyond appeared a group of black , straight antagonists . She staggered on towards them , gripping her rifle with some muddled idea of defence , and in another moment she was brushing against the branches of a stunted fir , which shed thick lumps of snow upon her feet . What trees were these ? Had she ever passed any trees ? No ! There were no trees on her way to Trafford .... She began whimpering like a tormented child . But even as she wept she turned her sledge about to follow the edge of the wood . She was too much downhill , she thought and she must bear up again . She left the trees behind , made an angle uphill to the right , and was presently among trees again . Again she left them and again came back to them . She screamed with anger at them and twitched her sledge away . She wiped at the snowstorm with her arm as though she would wipe it away . She wanted to stamp on the universe .... And she ached , she ached .... Something caught her eye ahead , something that gleamed ; it was exactly like a long , bare rather pinkish bone standing erect on the ground . Just because it was strange and queer she ran forward to it . Then as she came nearer she perceived it was a streak of barked trunk ; a branch had been torn off a pine tree and the bark stripped down to the root . And then her foot hit against a freshly hewn stump , and then came another , poking its pinkish wounds above the snow . And there were chips ! This filled her with wonder . Some one had been cutting wood ! There must be Indians or trappers near , she thought , and then realized the wood - cutter could be none other than herself . She turned to the right and saw the rocks rising steeply close at hand . "
158110	158363	159888	159888	you	4411	" she cried , and fired her rifle in the air . Ten seconds , twenty seconds , and then so loud and near it amazed her , came his answering shot . It sounded like the hillside bursting . In another moment she had discovered the trail she had made overnight and that morning by dragging firewood . It was now a shallow soft white trench . Instantly her despair and fatigue had gone from her . Should she take a load of wood with her ? she asked herself , in addition to the weight behind her , and had a better idea . She would unload and pile her stuff here , and bring him down on the sledge closer to the wood . She looked about and saw two rocks that diverged with a space between . She flashed schemes . She would trample the snow hard and flat , put her sledge on it , pile boughs and make a canopy of blanket overhead and behind . Then a fire in front . She saw her camp admirable . She tossed her provisions down and ran up the broad windings of her pine - tree trail to Trafford , with the unloaded sledge bumping behind her . She ran as lightly as though she had done nothing that day . She found him markedly recovered , weak and quiet , with snow drifting over his feet , his rifle across his knees , and his pipe alight . "
158367	158371	159888	159888	you	4411	" he said , "
158375	158379	159888	159888	you	4411	" He hesitated . "
158383	159853	159888	159888	you	4411	" She knelt over him , gave his rough unshaven cheek a swift kiss , and very rapidly explained her plan . In three days ' time they were back at the hut , and the last two days they wore blue spectacles because of the mid - day glare of the sunlit snow . It amazed Marjorie to discover as she lay awake in the camp on the edge of the ravine close to the hut to which she had lugged Trafford during the second day , that she was deeply happy . It was preposterous that she should be so , but those days of almost despairful stress were irradiated now by a new courage . She was doing this thing , against all Labrador and the snow - driving wind that blew from the polar wilderness , she was winning . It was a great discovery to her that hardship and effort almost to the breaking - point could ensue in so deep a satisfaction . She lay and thought how deep and rich life had become for her , as though in all this effort and struggle some unsuspected veil had been torn away . She perceived again , but now with no sense of desolation , that same infinite fragility of life which she had first perceived when she had watched the Aurora Borealis flickering up the sky . Beneath that realization and carrying it , as a river flood may carry scum , was a sense of herself as something deeper , greater , more enduring than mountain or wilderness or sky , or any of those monstrous forms of nature that had dwarfed her physical self to nothingness . She had a persuasion of self detachment and illumination , and withal of self - discovery . She saw her life of time and space for what it was . Away in London the children , with the coldest of noses and the gayest of spirits , would be scampering about their bedrooms in the mild morning sunlight of a London winter ; Elsie , the parlourmaid , would be whisking dexterous about the dining - room , the bacon would be cooking and the coffee - mill at work , the letters of the morning delivery perhaps just pattering into the letter - box , and all the bright little household she had made , with all the furniture she had arranged , all the characteristic decoration she had given it , all the clever convenient arrangements , would be getting itself into action for another day — and it was n't herself ! It was the extremest of her superficiality . She had come out of all that , and even so it seemed she had come out of herself ; this weary woman lying awake on the balsam boughs with a brain cleared by underfeeding and this continuous arduous bath of toil in snow - washed , frost cleansed , starry air , this , too , was no more than a momentarily clarified window for her unknown and indefinable reality . What was that reality ? what was she herself ? She became interested in framing an answer to that , and slipped down from the peace of soul she had attained . Her serenity gave way to a reiteration of this question , reiterations increasing and at last oppressing like the snowflakes of a storm , perpetual whirling repetitions that at last confused her and hid the sky .... She fell asleep .... With their return to the hut , Marjorie had found herself encountering a new set of urgencies . In their absence that wretched little wolverine had found great plenty and happiness in the tent and store - shed ; its traces were manifest nearly everywhere , and it had particularly assailed the candles , after a destructive time among the frozen caribou beef . It had clambered up on the packages of sardines and jumped thence on to a sloping pole that it could claw along into the frame of the roof . She rearranged the packages , but that was no good . She could not leave Trafford in order to track the brute down , and for a night or so she could not think of any way of checking its depredations . It came each night .... Trafford kept her close at home . She had expected that when he was back in his bunk , secure and warm , he would heal rapidly , but instead he suddenly developed all the symptoms of a severe feverish cold , and his scars , which had seemed healing , became flushed and ugly - looking . Moreover , there was something wrong with his leg , an ominous ache that troubled her mind . Every woman , she decided , ought to know how to set a bone . He was unable to sleep by reason of these miseries , though very desirous of doing so . He became distressingly weak and inert , he ceased to care for food , and presently he began ta talk to himself with a complete disregard of her presence . Hourly she regretted her ignorance of medicine that left her with no conceivable remedy for all the aching and gnawing that worried and weakened him , except bathing with antiseptics and a liberal use of quinine . And his face became strange to her , for over his flushed and sunken cheeks , under the raw spaces of the scar a blond beard bristled and grew . Presently , Trafford was a bearded man . Incidentally , however , she killed the wolverine by means of a trap of her own contrivance , a loaded rifle with a bait of what was nearly her last candles , rigged to the trigger . But this loss of the candles brought home to them the steady lengthening of the nights . Scarcely seven hours of day remained now in the black , cold grip of the darkness . And through those seventeen hours of chill aggression they had no light but the red glow of the stove . She had to close the door of the hut and bar every chink and cranny against the icy air , that became at last a murderous , freezing wind . Not only did she line the hut with every scrap of skin and paper she could obtain , but she went out with the spade toiling for three laborious afternoons in piling and beating snow against the outer frame . And now it was that Trafford talked at last , talked with something of the persistence of delirium , and she sat and listened hour by hour , silently , for he gave no heed to her or to anything she might say . He talked , it seemed , to God .... Darkness about a sullen glow of red , and a voice speaking . The voice of a man , fevered and in pain , wounded and amidst hardship and danger , struggling with the unrelenting riddle of his being . Ever and again when a flame leapt she would see his face , haggard , bearded , changed , and yet infinitely familiar . His voice varied , now high and clear , now mumbling , now vexed and expostulating , now rich with deep feeling , now fagged and slow ; his matter varied , too ; now he talked like one who is inspired , and now like one lost and confused , stupidly repeating phrases , going back upon a misleading argument , painfully , laboriously beginning over and over again . Marjorie sat before the stove watching it burn and sink , replenishing it , preparing food , and outside the bitter wind moaned and blew the powdery snow before it , and the shortening interludes of pallid , diffused daylight which pass for days in such weather , came and went . Intense cold had come now with leaden snowy days and starless nights . Sometimes his speech filled her mind , seemed to fill all her world ; sometimes she ceased to listen , following thoughts of her own . Sometimes she dozed ; sometimes she awakened from sleep to find him talking . But slowly she realized a thread in his discourse , a progress and development . Sometimes he talked of his early researches , and then he would trace computations with his hands as if he were using a blackboard , and became distressed to remember what he had written . Sometimes he would be under the claws of the lynx again , and fighting for his eyes . "
159856	159860	159888	159888	you	4411	" he said , "
159891	159978	159979	159979	You	4411	" But the gist of his speech was determined by the purpose of his journey to Labrador . At last he was reviewing his life and hers , and all that their life might signify , even as he determined to do . She began to perceive that whatever else drifted into his mind and talk , this recurred and grew , that he returned to the conclusion he had reached , and not to the beginning of the matter , and went on from that ....

It was like exploring caves — monstrous , limitless caves . Such caves ! ... Very still — underground . Wonderful and beautiful .... They 're lying there now for other men to seek . Other men will find them .... Then she came , as though she was taking possession . The beauty of her , oh ! the life and bright eagerness , and the incompatibility ! That 's the riddle ! I 've loved her always . When she came to my arms it seemed to me the crown of life . Caves indeed ! Old caves ! Nothing else seemed to matter . But something did . All sorts of things did . I found that out soon enough . And when that first child was born . That for a time was supreme .... Yes — she 's the quintessence of life , the dear greed of her , the appetite , the clever appetite for things . She grabs . She 's so damned clever ! The light in her eyes !

The scandals — as though the things they did with themselves and each other mattered a rap ; the little sham impromptu clever things , the trying to keep young — and underneath it all that continual cheating , cheating , cheating , damning struggle for money ! ... "
162197	162220	162221	162221	I	0	" No ! I do n't want to go on with it any more — ever . I want to go back . "
162233	162324	162537	162537	you	4441	" I want research , and the spirit of research that has died in me , and that still , silent room of mine again , that room , as quiet as a cell , and the toil that led to light . Oh ! the coming of that light , the uprush of discovery , the solemn joy as the generalization rises like a sun upon the facts — floods them with a common meaning . That is what I want . That is what I have always wanted .... "
162409	162535	162537	162537	you	4441	" He passed into weak , wandering repetitions of disconnected sentences , that died into whispers and silence , and Marjorie watched him and listened to him , and waited with a noiseless dexterity upon his every need . One day , she did not know what day , for she had lost count of the days , Marjorie set the kettle to boil and opened the door of the hut to look out , and the snow was ablaze with diamonds , and the air was sweet and still . It occurred to her that it would be well to take Trafford out into that brief brightness . She looked at him and found his eyes upon the sunlight quiet and rather wondering eyes . "
162545	162550	162537	162537	you	4441	" she asked abruptly . "
162553	162564	162565	162565	You	4441	" he said , and seemed disposed to get up . "
162572	162589	162593	162593	I	0	" she cried , to arrest his movement , and he looked at her and answered : "
162596	162845	162851	162851	Madge	323	" She was all atremble that he should recognize her and speak to her . She pulled her rude old sledge alongside his bunk , and kissed him , and showed him how to shift and drop himself upon the plank . She took him in her arms and lowered him . He helped weakly but understandingly , and she wrapped him up warmly on the planks and lugged him out and built up a big fire at his feet , wondering , but as yet too fearful to rejoice , at the change that had come to him . He said no more , but his eyes watched her move about with a kind of tired curiosity . He smiled for a time at the sun , and shut his eyes , and still faintly smiling , lay still . She had a curious fear that if she tried to talk to him this new lucidity would vanish again . She went about the business of the morning , glancing at him ever and again , until suddenly the calm of his upturned face smote her , and she ran to him and crouched down to him between hope and a terrible fear , and found that he was sleeping , and breathing very lightly , sleeping with the deep unconsciousness of a child .... When he awakened the sun was red in the west . His eyes met hers , and he seemed a little puzzled . "
162853	162860	162900	162900	I	0	" he said . She nodded . "
162924	162930	162939	162939	I	0	" He seemed to reflect . "
162934	162938	162985	162985	I	0	" he said , "
162978	162984	162985	162985	I	0	" He stared at her . "
162988	162992	163024	163024	Your	0	" he said , "
163009	163023	163024	163024	Your	0	" He amazed her by rising himself on his elbow and sitting up . "
163027	163040	163024	163024	Your	0	" she cried . He put his hand down and felt it . "
163044	163048	163190	163190	I	0	" he said . "
163167	163189	163190	163190	I	0	" His eyes , full of a warmth of kindliness she had not seen for long weeks , scrutinized her face . "
163193	163210	163190	163190	I	0	" he repeated , very softly . All her strength went from her at his tenderness . "
163216	163225	163229	163229	dear	4768	" she wailed , kneeling at his side , "
163231	163282	163294	163295	Poor dear	1280	" and still regardful of his leg , she yet contrived to get herself weeping into his coveted arms . He regarded her , he held her , he patted her back ! The infinite luxury to her ! He 'd come back . He 'd come back to her . "
163289	163293	163294	163295	Poor dear	1280	" he asked . "
163307	163471	163483	163483	We	4450	" From that hour Trafford mended . He remained clear - minded , helpful , sustaining . His face healed daily . Marjorie had had to cut away great fragments of gangrenous frozen flesh , and he was clearly destined to have a huge scar over forehead and cheek , but in that pure , clear air , once the healing had begun it progressed swiftly . His leg had set , a little shorter than its fellow and with a lump in the middle of the shin , but it promised to be a good serviceable leg none the less . They examined it by the light of the stove with their heads together , and discussed when it would be wise to try it . How do doctors tell when a man may stand on his broken leg ? She had a vague impression you must wait six weeks , but she could not remember why she fixed upon that time . "
163478	163482	163483	163483	We	4450	" said Trafford . "
163488	163558	163559	163559	We	4450	" She had contrived a crutch for him against that momentous experiment , and he sat up in his bunk , pillowed up by a sack and her rugs , and whittled it smooth , and padded the fork with the skin of that slaughtered wolverine , poor victim of hunger!—while she knelt by the stove feeding it with logs , and gave him an account of their position . "
163568	163572	163601	163601	I	0	" she said , "
163605	163615	163742	163743	Right O	549	" She nodded at the skin in his hand . "
163740	163741	163742	163743	Right O	549	" "
163745	163753	163760	163760	Marjorie	323	" said Trafford admiring her capable gravity . "
163758	163759	163769	163769	you	323	" "
163762	163767	163769	163769	you	323	" he asked abruptly , "
163774	163780	163769	163769	you	323	" Her answer came unhesitatingly . "
163783	163784	163786	163786	I.	0	" "
163787	163791	163803	163806	Dear dirty living thing	4453	" He paused . "
163798	163802	163809	163809	You	323	" he said . "

163823	163829	163854	163854	Lugano	550	" she answered , thinking . "

163856	163860	163854	163854	Lugano	550	" he suggested . "

163978	163984	164064	164064	I	0	" He kissed her hair . "

164599	164603	164614	164614	men	600	" he said , "

164773	164777	164867	164867	you	4491	" she said . "
164878	165177	164867	164867	you	4491	" What are we doing with life ? That question overtakes a reluctant and fugitive humanity . The Traffords were but two of a great scattered host of people , who , obeying all the urgencies of need and desire , struggling , loving , begetting , enjoying , do nevertheless find themselves at last unsatisfied . They have lived the round of experience , achieved all that living creatures have sought since the beginning of the world — security and gratification and offspring — and they find themselves still strong , unsatiated , with power in their hands and years before them , empty of purpose . What are they to do ? The world presents such a spectacle of evasion as it has never seen before . Never was there such a boiling over and waste of vital energy . The Sphinx of our opportunity calls for the uttermost powers of heart and brain to read its riddle — the new , astonishing riddle of excessive power . A few give themselves to those honourable adventures that extend the range of man , they explore untravelled countries , climb remote mountains , conduct researches , risk life and limb in the fantastic experiments of flight , and a monstrous outpouring of labour and material goes on in the strenuous preparation for needless and improbable wars . The rest divert themselves with the dwarfish satisfactions of recognized vice , the meagre routine of pleasure , or still more timidly with sport and games — those new unscheduled perversions of the soul . We are afraid of our new selves . The dawn of human opportunity appals us . Few of us dare look upon this strange light of freedom and limitless resources that breaks upon our world . "
165180	165184	165216	165216	I	0	" said Trafford , "
165220	165221	165514	165514	my	0	westward"—he pointed—"there
165409	165511	165514	165514	my	0	" On the evening of the day when Trafford first tried to stand upon his leg , they talked far into the night . It had been a great and eventful day for them , full of laughter and exultation . He had been at first ridiculously afraid ; he had clung to her almost childishly , and she had held him about the body with his weight on her strong right arm and his right arm in her left hand , concealing her own dread of a collapse under a mask of taunting courage . The crutch had proved admirable . "
165518	165524	165532	165532	I	0	" Trafford kept on saying . "
165541	165565	165532	165532	I	0	" They made the day a feast , a dinner of two whole day 's rations and a special soup instead of supper . "
165571	165578	165588	165588	you	4520	" they explained to each other , "
165595	165609	165588	165588	you	4520	" Marjorie confessed the habit of sharing his pipe was growing on her . "
165617	165628	165641	165641	I	0	" she said , and left it to the imagination . "
165636	165640	165736	165736	You	4524	" he said . "
165675	165735	165736	165736	You	4524	" Then , as he lay back in his bunk and she crammed the stove with fresh boughs and twigs of balsam that filled the little space about them with warmth and with a faint , sweet smell of burning and with flitting red reflections , he took up a talk about religion they had begun some days before . "
165739	165743	165928	165928	Madge	323	" he said , "
165930	165931	165928	165928	Madge	323	" "
165934	165940	165928	165928	Madge	323	" she said , intent ; "
165944	165945	166099	166099	Marjorie	323	" "
166101	166119	166122	166122	you	0	" ... He stopped and stared at her . Marjorie sat red - lit , regarding him . "
166125	166129	166168	166168	you	0	" she said . "

166210	166216	166380	166380	He	0	" whispered Marjorie , involuntarily . "
166341	166379	166438	166438	he	0	" I feel that man has now before all things to know . That 's his supreme duty , to feel , realize , see , understand , express himself to the utmost limits of his power . "
166432	166437	166438	166438	he	0	" All the religions , "
166441	166582	166830	166830	you	4552	" all the philosophies , have pretended to achieve too much . We 've no language yet for religious truth or metaphysical truth ; we 've no basis yet broad enough and strong enough on which to build . Religion and philosophy have been impudent and quackish — quackish ! They 've been like the doctors , who have always pretended they could cure since the beginning of things , cure everything , and to this day even they have n't got more than the beginnings of knowledge on which to base a cure . They 've lacked humility , they 've lacked the honour to say they did n't know ; the priests took things of wood and stone , the philosophers took little odd arrangements of poor battered words , metaphors , analogies , abstractions , and said : "
166838	166844	166846	166846	you	0	" ... He became silent . "
166853	166859	166846	166846	you	0	" she said , abruptly . "
166866	166877	166846	166846	you	0	" He stared at her for a moment without speaking . "
166880	166886	166909	166909	My	0	" he said at last . "
166889	166908	166909	166909	My	0	" she said , and the word dropped from her like a stone that falls down a well .... "
166912	166919	167139	167139	I	0	" he said , at last , "
167126	167138	167311	167311	you	4573	" He paused and she waited , with a face aglow . "
167318	167348	167311	167311	you	4573	" Something stopped his voice . Something choked them both into silence . He held out a lean hand , and she shuffled on her knees to take it .... "
167355	167362	167397	167398	Old Madge	323	" she stumbled through her thoughts , "
167395	167396	167397	167398	Old Madge	323	" "
167400	167404	167435	167437	a candidate girl	4579	" he said , "
167445	167446	167435	167437	a candidate girl	4579	" "
167453	167457	167435	167437	a candidate girl	4579	" she whispered , "
167463	167464	167490	167490	I	0	" "
167469	167489	167492	167492	I	0	" he said . She disengaged herself from his arm , and sat close to him upon the floor . "
167500	167507	167524	167524	I	0	" she said . She mused . "
167538	167559	167524	167524	I	0	" Queer ideas came drifting into her head . Suddenly she cried out sharply in that high note he loved . "
167563	167567	167524	167524	I	0	" she said . "
167575	167576	167582	167582	I	0	" "
167580	167581	167582	167582	I	0	" "
167592	167620	167644	167644	I	0	" She sprang to her feet . There came a sound of wind outside , a shifting of snow on the roof , and the door creaked . "
167626	167643	167695	167695	you	0	" she exclaimed looking at the watch that hung in the light of the stove door . "
167709	167719	167695	167695	you	0	" Her face was keenly anxious . He nodded . "
167724	167739	167695	167695	you	0	" she said , trying to rob her voice of any note of criminality . "
167750	167774	167695	167695	you	0	" She hovered for some moments close to the stove before she went into the arctic corner that contained the tin of tea . "
167783	167787	167695	167695	you	0	" she said . "
167794	167795	167695	167695	you	0	" "
167799	167835	167836	167836	I	0	" he answered . She made no answer , but went across for the tea .... He turned his head at the sound of the biscuit tin and watched her put out the precious discs . "
167842	167853	167836	167836	I	0	" he proclaimed , with an agreeable note of excess . "
167860	168650	168660	168660	Marjorie	323	" And now Marjorie 's mind was teaming with thoughts of this new conception of a life lived for understanding . As she went about the preparation of the tea , her vividly concrete imagination was active with the realization of the life they would lead on their return . She could not see it otherwise than framed in a tall , fine room , a study , a study in sombre tones , with high , narrow , tall , dignified bookshelves and rich deep green curtains veiling its windows . There should be a fireplace of white marble , very plain and well proportioned , with furnishings of old brass , and a big desk towards the window beautifully lit by electric light , with abundant space for papers to lie . And she wanted some touch of the wilderness about it ; a skin perhaps .... The tea was still infusing when she had determined upon an enormous paper - weight of that iridescent Labradorite that had been so astonishing a feature of the Green River Valley . She would have it polished on one side only — the other should be rough to show the felspar in its natural state .... It was n't that she did n't feel and understand quite fully the intention and significance of all he had said , but that in these symbols of texture and equipment her mind quite naturally clothed itself . And while this room was coming into anticipatory being in her mind , she was making the tea very deftly and listening to Trafford 's every word . That talk marked an epoch to Marjorie . From that day forth her imagination began to shape a new , ordered and purposeful life for Trafford and herself in London , a life not altogether divorced from their former life , but with a faith sustaining it and aims controlling it . She had always known of the breadth and power of his mind , but now as he talked of what he might do , what interests might converge and give results through him , it seemed she really knew him for the first time . In his former researches , so technical and withdrawn , she had seen little of his mind in action : now he was dealing in his own fashion with things she could clearly understand . There were times when his talk affected her like that joy of light one has in emerging into sunshine from a long and tedious cave . He swept things together , flashed unsuspected correlations upon her intelligence , smashed and scattered absurd yet venerated conventions of thought , made undreamt - of courses of action visible in a flare of luminous necessity . And she could follow him and help him . Just as she had hampered him and crippled him , so now she could release him — she fondled that word . She found a preposterous image in her mind that she hid like a disgraceful secret , that she tried to forget , and yet its stupendous , its dreamlike absurdity had something in it that shaped her delight as nothing else could do ; she was , she told herself — hawking with an archangel ! ... These were her moods of exaltation . And she was sure she had never loved her man before , that this was indeed her beginning . It was as if she had just found him .... Perhaps , she thought , true lovers keep on finding each other all through their lives . And he too had discovered her . All the host of Marjories he had known , the shining , delightful , seductive , wilful , perplexing aspects that had so filled her life , gave place altogether for a time to this steady - eyed woman , lean and warm - wrapped with the valiant heart and the frost - roughened skin . What a fine , strong , ruddy thing she was ! How glad he was for this wild adventure in the wilderness , if only because it had made him lie among the rocks and think of her and wait for her and despair of her life and God , and at last see her coming back to him , flushed with effort and calling his name to him out of that whirlwind of snow .... And there was at least one old memory mixed up with all these new and overmastering impressions , the memory of her clear unhesitating voice as it had stabbed into his life again long years ago , minute and bright in the telephone : "
168662	168833	168834	168834	One	675	" Perhaps after all she had not wasted a moment of his life , perhaps every issue between them had been necessary , and it was good altogether to be turned from the study of crystals to the study of men and women .... And now both their minds were Londonward , where all the tides and driftage and currents of human thought still meet and swirl together . They were full of what they would do when they got back . Marjorie sketched that study to him — in general terms and without the paper - weight — and began to shape the world she would have about it . She meant to be his squaw and body - servant first of all , and then — a mother . Children , she said , are none the worse for being kept a little out of focus . And he was rapidly planning out his approach to the new questions to which he was now to devote his life . "
168843	168852	168834	168834	One	675	" he said , and projected a book . "
168876	168907	168834	168834	One	675	" He designed a book , which he might write if only for the definition it would give him and with no ultimate publication , which was to be called : "
168918	168956	168976	168976	they	4585	" ... It was to be a pragmatist essay , a sustained attempt to undermine the confidence of all that scholasticism and logic chopping which still lingers like the sequelæ of a disease in our University philosophy . "
168984	169000	168976	168976	they	4585	" he said . He proliferated titles for a time , and settled at last on "
169006	169137	168976	168976	they	4585	" He wanted to get at that at once ; it fretted him to have to hang in the air , day by day , for want of books to quote and opponents to lance and confute . And he wanted to see pictures , too and plays , read novels he had heard of and never read , in order to verify or correct the ideas that were seething in his mind about the qualities of artistic expression . His thought had come out to a conviction that the line to wider human understandings lies through a huge criticism and cleaning up of the existing methods of formulation , as a preliminary to the wider and freer discussion of those religious and social issues our generation still shrinks from . "
169142	169146	169196	169196	Marjorie	323	" he said , "
169166	169195	169196	169196	Marjorie	323	" There was not even paper for him to make notes or provisional drafts of the new work . He hobbled about the camp fretting at these deprivations . "
169198	169202	169243	169243	we	4587	" he said , "
169255	169256	169243	169243	we	4587	" "
169260	169261	169243	169243	we	4587	" "
169265	169266	169243	169243	we	4587	" "
169271	169272	169303	169303	We	4587	" "
169312	169453	169303	169303	We	4587	" She looked down the wide stretches of the valley . There was the hill they had christened Marjorie Ridge . At least it was familiar . Every night before nightfall if they started there would be a fresh camping place to seek among the snow - drifts , a great heap of wood to cut to last the night . Suppose his leg gave out — when they were already some days away , so that he could no longer go on or she drag him back to the stores . Plainly there would be nothing for it then but to lie down and die together .... And a sort of weariness had come to her as a consequence of two months of half - starved days , not perhaps a failure so much as a reluctance of spirit . "
169457	169470	169485	169485	We	4587	" she said , with a new aspect drifting before her mind , "
169490	169491	169517	169517	I	0	" "
169500	169516	169823	169823	He	4599	" Trafford began one day as they sat spinning out their mid - day meal , "
169788	169822	169823	169823	He	4599	" It 's a most extraordinary thing to think out , Marjorie , that antagonism . Our love has kept us so close together and always our purposes have been — like that . "
169828	170124	170134	170134	Marjorie	323	" I 've speculated again and again whether there is n't something incurably antagonistic between women ( that 's you generalized , Marjorie ) and men ( that 's me ) directly we pass beyond the conditions of the individualistic struggle . I believe every couple of lovers who 've ever married have felt that strain . Yet it 's not a difference in kind between us but degree . The big conflict between us has a parallel in a little internal conflict that goes on ; there 's something of man in every woman and a touch of the feminine in every man . But you 're nearer as woman to the immediate personal life of sense and reality than I am as man . It 's been so ever since the men went hunting and fighting and the women kept hut , tended the children and gathered roots in the little cultivation close at hand . It 's been so perhaps since the female carried and suckled her child and distinguished one male from another . It may be it will always be so . Men were released from that close , continuous touch with physical necessities long before women were . It 's only now that women begin to be released . For ages now men have been wandering from field and home and city , over the hills and far away , in search of adventures and fresh ideas and the wells of mystery beyond the edge of the world , but it 's only now that the woman comes with them too . Our difference is n't a difference in kind , old Marjorie ; it 's the difference between the old adventurer and the new feet upon the trail . "
170125	170132	170134	170134	Marjorie	323	" We 've got to come , "
170136	170209	169823	169823	He	4599	" Oh ! you 've got to come . No good to be pioneers if the race does not follow . The women are the backbone of the race ; the men are just the individuals . Into this Labrador and into all the wild and desolate places of thought and desire , if men come you women have to come too — and bring the race with you . Some day . "
170210	170220	170251	170251	He	4600	" A long day , mate of my heart . "
170221	170250	170251	170251	He	4600	" Who knows how long or how far ? Are n't you at any rate here , dear woman of mine .... ( Surely you are here ) . "
170258	170324	170343	170343	she	4601	" There 's all those words that seem to mean something and then do n't seem to mean anything , that keep shifting to and fro from the deepest significance to the shallowest of claptrap , Socialism , Christianity .... You know,—they are n't anything really , as yet ; they are something trying to be .... Have n't I said that before , Marjorie ? "
170331	170342	170343	170343	she	4601	" You said something like that when you were delirious , "
170351	170381	169823	169823	He	4599	" It 's one of the ideas that you 're struggling with . You go on , old man , and talk . We 've months — for repetitions . "
170382	170519	170343	170343	she	4601	" Well , I mean that all these things are seeking after a sort of co - operation that 's greater than our power even of imaginative realization ; that 's what I mean . The kingdom of Heaven , the communion of saints , the fellowship of men ; these are things like high peaks far out of the common life of every day , shining things that madden certain sorts of men to climb . Certain sorts of us ! I 'm a religious man , I 'm a socialistic man . These calls are more to me than my daily bread . I 've got something in me more generalizing than most men . I 'm more so than many other men and most other women , I 'm more socialistic than you .... "
170520	170676	170740	170740	You	4604	" You know , Marjorie , I 've always felt you 're a finer individual than me , I 've never had a doubt of it . You 're more beautiful by far than I , woman for my man . You 've a keener appetite for things , a firmer grip on the substance of life . I love to see you do things , love to see you move , love to watch your hands ; you 've cleverer hands than mine by far .... And yet — I'm a deeper and bigger thing than you . I reach up to something you do n't reach up to .... You 're in life — and I 'm a little out of it , I 'm like one of those fish that began to be amphibian , I go out into something where you do n't follow — where you hardly begin to follow . "
170689	170739	170761	170761	I	0	" It seems to me that the primitive socialism of Christianity and all the stuff of modern socialism that matters is really aiming — almost unconsciously , I admit at times — at one simple end , at the release of the human spirit from the individualistic struggle — — "
170770	170771	170783	170783	We	4605	" "
170778	170782	170840	170840	I	0	" said Marjorie . "
170834	170838	171250	171250	Marjorie	323	" Trafford thought . "
170941	171243	171250	171250	Marjorie	323	" The practical trouble between your sort and my sort , Marjorie , is the trouble between faith and realization . You demand the outcome . Oh ! and I hate to turn aside and realize . I 've had to do it for seven years . Damnable years ! Men of my sort want to understand . We want to understand , and you ask us to make . We want to understand atoms , ions , molecules , refractions . You ask us to make rubber and diamonds . I suppose it 's right that incidentally we should make rubber and diamonds . Finally , I warn you , we will make rubber unnecessary and diamonds valueless . And again we want to understand how people react upon one another to produce social consequences , and you ask us to put it at once into a draft bill for the reform of something or other . I suppose life lies between us somewhere , we 're the two poles of truth seeking and truth getting ; with me alone it would be nothing but a luminous dream , with you nothing but a scramble in which sooner or later all the lamps would be upset .... But it 's ever too much of a scramble yet , and ever too little of a dream . All our world over there is full of the confusion and wreckage of premature realizations . There 's no real faith in thought and knowledge yet . Old necessity has driven men so hard that they still rush with a wild urgency — though she goads no more . Greed and haste , and if , indeed , we seem to have a moment 's breathing space , then the Gawdsaker tramples us under . "
171244	171248	171250	171250	Marjorie	323	" My dear ! "
171259	171265	171271	171271	Trafford	394	" What is a Gawdsaker ? "
171266	171269	171845	171845	He	4608	" Oh , "
171273	171844	171845	171845	He	4608	" have n't you heard that before ? He 's the person who gets excited by any deliberate discussion and gets up wringing his hands and screaming , ' For Gawd 's sake , let 's do something now ! ' I think they used it first for Pethick Lawrence , that man who did so much to run the old militant suffragettes and burke the proper discussion of woman 's future . You know . You used to have 'em in Chelsea — with their hats . Oh ! ' Gawdsaking ' is the curse of all progress , the hectic consumption that kills a thousand good beginnings . You see it in small things and in great . You see it in my life ; Gawdsaking turned my life - work to cash and promotions , Gawdsaking —— Look at the way the aviators took to flying for prizes and gate - money , the way pure research is swamped by endowments for technical applications ! Then that poor ghost - giant of an idea the socialists have;—it 's been treated like one of those unborn lambs they kill for the fine skin of it , made into results before ever it was alive . Was there anything more pitiful ? The first great dream and then the last phase ! when your Aunt Plessington and the district visitors took and used it as a synonym for Payment in Kind .... It 's natural , I suppose , for people to be eager for results , personal and immediate results — the last lesson of life is patience . Naturally they want reality , naturally ! They want the individual life , something to handle and feel and use and live by , something of their very own before they die , and they want it now . But the thing that matters for the race , Marjorie , is a very different thing ; it is to get the emerging thought process clear and to keep it clear — and to let those other hungers go . We 've got to go back to England on the side of that delay , that arrest of interruption , that detached , observant , synthesizing process of the mind , that solvent of difficulties and obsolescent institutions , which is the reality of collective human life . We 've got to go back on the side of pure science — literature untrammeled by the preconceptions of the social schemers — art free from the urgency of immediate utility — and a new , a regal , a god - like sincerity in philosophy . And , above all , we 've got to stop this Jackdaw buying of yours , my dear , which is the essence of all that is wrong with the world , this snatching at everything , which loses everything worth having in life , this greedy confused realization of our accumulated resources ! You 're going to be a non - shopping woman now . You 're to come out of Bond Street , you and your kind , like Israel leaving the Egyptian flesh - pots . You 're going to be my wife and my mate .... Less of this service of things . Investments in comfort , in security , in experience , yes ; but not just spending any more .... "
171851	171860	171866	171866	Marjorie	323	" I want to go back and begin . "
171861	171864	171866	171866	Marjorie	323	" Yes , "
171868	171874	171978	171978	she	323	" we will go back , "
171981	172020	172037	172037	he	4608	" I wonder if we shall fail . I wonder if we shall get into a mess again when we are back in London .... As big a mess and as utter a discontent as sent us here .... "
172040	172044	172051	172051	she	323	" What nonsense ! "
172045	172050	172037	172037	he	4608	" But we shall , "
172054	172121	172126	172126	he	4608	" Everybody fails . To some extent , we are bound to fail . Because indeed nothing is clear ; nothing is a clear issue .... You know — I'm just the old Marjorie really in spite of all these resolutions — the spendthrift , the restless , the eager . I 'm a born snatcher and shopper . We 're just the same people really . "
172122	172125	172126	172126	he	4608	" No , "
172132	172139	172147	172147	she	323	" You 're all Labrador older . "
172140	172146	172147	172147	she	323	" I always have failed , "
172150	172170	172190	172190	she	323	" when it came to any special temptations , Rag . I ca n't stand not having a thing ! "
172176	172189	172190	172190	she	323	" And you 're still the same old Rag , you know , "
172194	172219	172269	172269	He	4608	" Who weakens into kindness if I cry . Who likes me well - dressed . Who could n't endure to see me poor . "
172220	172268	172269	172269	He	4608	" Not a bit of it . No ! I 'm a very different Rag with a very different Marjorie . Yes indeed ! Things — are graver . Why!—I'm lame for life — and I 've a scar . The very look of things is changed .... "
172277	172295	172303	172303	she	323	" You 've hidden the looking - glass and you think I have n't noted it — — "
172296	172302	172303	172303	she	323	" It keeps on healing , "
172306	172319	172320	172320	She	323	" And if it comes to that — where 's my complexion ? "
172323	172334	172342	172342	he	4608	" These are just the superficial aspects of the case . "
172335	172341	172342	172342	he	4608	" Nothing ever heals completely , "
172350	172380	172389	172389	Marjorie	323	" and nothing ever goes back to the exact place it held before . We are different , you sun - bitten , frost - bitten wife of mine . "
172382	172387	172389	172389	Marjorie	323	" Character is character , "
172397	172549	172560	172560	Trafford	394	" Do n't exaggerate conversion , dear . It 's not a bit of good pretending we sha n't fall away , both of us . Each in our own manner . We shall . We shall , old man . London is still a tempting and confusing place , and you ca n't alter people fundamentally , not even by half - freezing and half - starving them . You only alter people fundamentally by killing them and replacing them . I shall be extravagant again and forget again , try as I may , and you will work again and fall away again and forgive me again . You know —— It 's just as though we were each of us not one person , but a lot of persons , who sometimes meet and shout all together , and then disperse and forget and plot against each other .... "
172550	172558	172560	172560	Trafford	394	" Oh , things will happen again , "
172566	172613	172624	172624	she	394	" But they will happen again with a difference — after this . With a difference . That 's the good of it all .... We 've found something here — that makes everything different .... We 've found each other , too , dear wife . "
172618	172623	172624	172624	she	394	" I am afraid , "
172627	172637	172642	172642	She	394	" But what is there to be afraid of ? "
172638	172641	172642	172642	She	394	" Myself . "
172653	172666	172624	172624	she	394	" At times I wish — oh , passionately!—that I could pray . "
172667	172673	172690	172690	Trafford	394	" Why do n't you ? "
172674	172689	172703	172703	he	4613	" I do n't believe enough — in that . I wish I did . "
172693	172702	172703	172703	he	4613	" People are always so exacting about prayer , "
172706	172709	172624	172624	she	394	" Exacting . "
172710	172781	172787	172787	Marjorie	323	" You want to pray — and you ca n't make terms for a thing you want . I used to think I could . I wanted God to come and demonstrate a bit .... It 's no good , Madge .... If God chooses to be silent — you must pray to the silence . If he chooses to live in darkness , you must pray to the night .... "
172782	172785	172796	172796	She	323	" Yes , "
172789	172795	172809	172809	she	323	" I suppose one must . "
172799	172808	172874	172875	the human	4616	" I suppose in the end one does , "
172879	172886	172957	172957	Marjorie	323	" Do you remember — — ? "
172946	172955	172957	172957	Marjorie	323	" The shops are bright for Christmas now , "
172959	172994	173004	173004	Trafford	394	" This year Dick was to have had his first fireworks . I wonder if he did . I wonder if he burnt his dear little funny stumps of fingers . I hope not . "
172995	173002	173004	173004	Trafford	394	" Oh , just a little , "
173006	173042	172957	172957	Marjorie	323	" I remember how a squib made my glove smoulder and singed me , and how my mother kissed me for taking it like a man . It was the best part of the adventure . "
173043	173066	173180	173180	Marjorie	323	" Dick shall burn his fingers when his mother 's home to kiss him . But spare his fingers now , Dadda .... "
173171	173178	173193	173193	Trafford	394	" It 's niggling with food , "
173182	173191	173193	173193	Trafford	394	" Oh , but there 's no reason , "
173195	173250	173260	173260	Marjorie	323	" why you should n't take a lot of hors - d'œuvre . Three or four sardines , and potato salad and a big piece of smoked salmon , and some of that Norwegian herring , and so on , and keep the olives by you to pick at . It 's a beginning . "
173251	173258	173260	173260	Marjorie	323	" It's — it 's immoral , "
173262	173316	173193	173193	Trafford	394	" that 's what I feel . If one needs a whet to eat , one should n't eat . The proper beginning of a dinner is soup — good , hot , rich soup . Thick soup — with things in it , vegetables and meat and things . Bits of oxtail . "
173317	173321	173260	173260	Marjorie	323	" Not peas . "
173322	173355	173366	173366	Trafford	394	" No , not peas . Pea - soup is tiresome . I never knew anything one tired of so soon . I wish we had n't relied on it so much . "
173356	173364	173260	173260	Marjorie	323	" Thick soup 's all very well , "
173368	173496	173260	173260	Marjorie	323	" but how about that clear stuff they give you in the little pavement restaurants in Paris . You know — Croûte - au - pot , with lovely great crusts and big leeks and lettuce leaves and so on ! Tremendous aroma of onions , and beautiful little beads of fat ! And being a clear soup , you see what there is . That's — interesting . Twenty - five centimes , Marjorie . Lord ! I 'd give a guinea a plate for it . I 'd give five pounds for one of those jolly white - metal tureens full — you know , full , with little drops all over the outside of it , and the ladle sticking out under the lid . "
173497	173505	173260	173260	Marjorie	323	" Have you ever tasted turtle soup ? "
173506	173577	173585	173585	Marjorie	323	" Rather . They give it you in the City . The fat's — ripping . But they 're rather precious with it , you know . For my own part , I do n't think soup should be doled out . I always liked the soup we used to get at the Harts ' ; but then they never give you enough , you know — not nearly enough . "
173578	173583	173585	173585	Marjorie	323	" About a tablespoonful , "
173587	173594	173605	173605	Trafford	394	" It 's mocking an appetite . "
173595	173603	173638	173638	Trafford	394	" Still there 's things to follow , "
173632	173636	173638	173638	Trafford	394	" In London , "
173640	173648	173680	173680	Trafford	394	" one 's taste gets — vitiated . "
173675	173678	173680	173680	Trafford	394	" Dinners , "
173682	173815	173823	173823	she	394	" should be feasting , not the mere satisfaction of a necessity . There should be — amplitude . I remember a recipe for a pie ; I think it was in one of those books that man Lucas used to compile . If I remember rightly , it began with : ' Take a swine and hew it into gobbets . ' Gobbets ! That 's something like a beginning . It was a big pie with tiers and tiers of things , and it kept it up all the way in that key .... And then what could be better than prime British - fed roast beef , reddish , just a shade on the side of underdone , and not too finely cut . Mutton ca n't touch it . "
173816	173822	173823	173823	she	394	" Beef is the best , "
173826	173936	173943	173943	Marjorie	323	" Then our English cold meat again . What can equal it ? Such stuff as they give in a good country inn , a huge joint of beef — you cut from it yourself , you know as much as you like — with mustard , pickles , celery , a tankard of stout , let us say . Pressed beef , such as they 'll give you at the Reform , too , that 's good eating for a man . With chutney , and then old cheese to follow . And boiled beef , with little carrots and turnips and a dumpling or so . Eh ? "
173937	173941	173943	173943	Marjorie	323	" Of course , "
173945	173961	173823	173823	she	394	" one must do justice to a well - chosen turkey , a fat turkey . "
173962	174024	174040	174040	he	4622	" Or a good goose , for the matter of that — with honest , well - thought - out stuffing . I like the little sausages round the dish of a turkey , too ; like cherubs they are , round the feet of a Madonna .... There 's much to be said for sausage , Marjorie . It concentrates . "
174030	174039	174040	174040	he	4622	" I 'm not one of those patriots , "
174045	174280	173943	173943	Marjorie	323	" who run down other countries by way of glorifying their own . While I was in Germany I tasted many good things . There 's their Leberwurst ; it 's never bad , and , at its best , it 's splendid . It 's only a fool would reproach Germany with sausage . Devonshire black - pudding , of course , is the master of any Blutwurst , but there 's all those others on the German side , Frankfurter , big reddish sausage stuff again with great crystalline lumps of white fat . And how well they cook their rich hashes , and the thick gravies they make . Curious , how much better the cooking of Teutonic peoples is than the cooking of the South Europeans ! It 's as if one needed a colder climate to brace a cook to his business . The Frenchman and the Italian trifle and stimulate . It 's as if they 'd never met a hungry man . No German would have thought of soufflé . Ugh ! it 's vicious eating . There 's much that 's fine , though , in Austria and Hungary . I wish I had travelled in Hungary . Do you remember how once or twice we 've lunched at that Viennese place in Regent Street , and how they 've given us stuffed Paprika , eh ? "
174281	174305	174040	174040	he	4622	" That was a good place . I remember there was stewed beef once with a lot of barley — such good barley ! "
174306	174334	174040	174040	he	4622	" Every country has its glories . One talks of the cookery of northern countries and then suddenly one thinks of curry , with lots of rice . "
174335	174341	173943	173943	Marjorie	323	" And lots of chicken ! "
174342	174463	174040	174040	he	4622	" And lots of hot curry powder , very hot . And look at America ! Here 's a people who have n't any of them been out of Europe for centuries , and yet they have as different a table as you could well imagine . There 's a kind of fish , planked shad , that they cook on resinous wood — roast it , I suppose . It 's substantial , like nothing else in the world . And how good , too , with turkey are sweet potatoes . Then they have such a multitude of cereal things ; stuff like their buckwheat cakes , all swimming in golden syrup . And Indian corn , again ! "
174464	174487	174040	174040	he	4622	" Of course , corn is being anglicized . I 've often given you corn — latterly , before we came away . "
174488	174556	174596	174596	Marjorie	323	" That sort of separated grain — out of tins . Like chicken 's food ! It 's not the real thing . You should eat corn on the cob — American fashion ! It 's fine . I had it when I was in the States . You know , you take it up in your hands by both ends — you've seen the cobs?—and gnaw . "
174586	174594	174637	174637	Marjorie	323	" I 'd like to do that , "
174622	174635	174659	174659	she	323	" I'd — I'd like to eat a mutton chop like that , "
174654	174658	174659	174659	she	323	" Old man , "
174662	174695	174720	174720	him	4623	" I ca n't stand it any longer . I 'm going to thaw my scissors and cut your hair .... And then you 'll have to trim that beard of yours . "
174696	174708	174715	174715	Marjorie	323	" You 'll have to dig out that looking - glass . "
174709	174713	174733	174733	she	323	" I know , "
174722	174732	174733	174733	she	323	" You 'll never be a pretty man again , "
174736	174756	174776	174776	Trafford	394	" But there 's a sort of wild splendour .... And I love every inch and scrap of you .... "
174761	174774	174776	174776	Trafford	394	" We 're a thousand deeps now below the look of things , "
174778	174786	174807	174807	she	323	" We 'd love each other minced . "
174796	174806	174807	174807	she	323	" Oh ! it wo n't come to that , "
174810	174815	174883	174883	he	837	" Trust my housekeeping ! "
174878	174882	174883	174883	he	837	" Much snow , "
174886	174891	175188	175188	he	837	" and little fur . "
175184	175187	175223	175223	he	837	" Yes , "
175216	175222	175236	175237	Louis Napoleon	561	" We are coming down , "
175227	175234	175245	175245	Trafford	394	" I thought , perhaps — — "
175240	175243	175287	175287	He	837	" Yes , "
175247	175286	175287	175287	He	837	" we are coming down with you . Why not ? We can get a sledge over the snow now ? It 's hard ? I mean a flat sledge — like this . See ? Like this . "
175299	175335	175347	175348	Louis Napoleon	561	" We shall bring all the stuff we can down with us , grub , blankets — not the tent , it 's too bulky ; we 'll leave a lot of the heavy gear . "
175336	175345	175347	175348	Louis Napoleon	561	" You 'd have to leave the tent , "
175350	175357	175287	175287	He	837	" I said leave the tent . "
175358	175371	175287	175287	He	837	" And you 'd have to leave ... some of those tins . "
175372	175378	175347	175348	Louis Napoleon	561	" Nearly all of them . "
175379	175389	175287	175287	He	837	" And the ammunition , there;—except just a little . "
175390	175398	175287	175287	He	837	" Just enough for the journey down . "
175399	175404	175347	175348	Louis Napoleon	561	" Perhaps a gun ? "
175405	175433	175287	175287	He	837	" No , not a gun . Though , after all,—well , we 'd return one of the guns . Give it you to bring back here . "
175434	175439	175287	175287	He	837	" Bring back here ? "
175440	175445	175469	175469	he	561	" If you liked . "
175465	175468	175495	175495	Trafford	394	" After , "
175484	175494	175527	175527	he	561	" all you leave will be mine ? Eh ? "
175516	175526	175527	175527	he	561	" I will take you right to Hammond 's , "
175530	175544	176181	176181	he	561	" Where they have dogs . And then I can come back here .... "
176169	176171	176305	176305	He	561	" planter "
176316	176319	176382	176382	his	561	" truly . "
176366	176371	176405	176405	he	561	" Sowing the Seed , "
176395	176404	176429	176429	he	561	" It goes gobble , gobble , gobble , "
176418	176428	176861	176861	He	561	" It 's good to be jolly at times , "
176882	176884	176987	176987	Trafford	394	" dallars "
176978	176985	176987	176987	Trafford	394	" Think what he 's doing ! "
177003	177196	177204	177204	Marjorie	323	" We imagined this was a free , simple - souled man leading an unsophisticated life on the very edge of humanity , and really he is as much a dependant of your woman 's world , Marjorie , as any sweated seamstress in a Marylebone slum . Lord ! how far those pretty wasteful hands of women reach ! All these poor broken and starving beasts he finds and slaughters are , from the point of view of our world , just furs . Furs ! Poor little snarling unfortunates ! Their pelts will be dressed and prepared because women who have never dreamt of this bleak wilderness desire them . They will get at last into Regent Street shops , and Bond Street shops , and shops in Fifth Avenue and in Paris and Berlin , they will make delightful deep muffs , with scent and little bags and powder puffs and all sorts of things tucked away inside , and long wraps for tall women , and jolly little frames of soft fur for pretty faces , and dainty coats and rugs for expensive little babies in Kensington Gardens . "
177198	177202	177204	177204	Marjorie	323	" I wonder , "
177206	177218	177233	177233	she	323	" if I could buy one perhaps . As a memento . "
177229	177232	177233	177233	she	323	" Oh ! "
177236	177247	177258	177258	Trafford	394	" I did n't mean to ! The old Eve ! "
177248	177256	177258	177258	Trafford	394	" The old Adam is with her , "
177260	177311	177317	177317	Marjorie	323	" He 's wanting to give it her .... We do n't cease to be human , Madge , you know , because we 've got an idea now of just where we are . I wonder , which would you like ? I dare say we could arrange it . "
177312	177315	177329	177329	she	323	" No , "
177322	177328	177329	177329	she	323	" It would be jolly , "
177332	177357	177366	177366	Trafford	394	" All the same , you know — and just to show you — I'm not going to let you buy me that fur . "
177358	177364	177373	177373	Marjorie	323	" I 'd like to , "
177368	177371	177373	177373	Marjorie	323	" No , "
177383	177437	177451	177451	he	4683	" I mean it . I 've got more to do than you in the way of reforming . It 's just because always I 've let my life be made up of such little things that I must n't . Indeed I must n't . Do n't make things hard for me . "
177446	177450	177451	177451	he	4683	" Very well , "
177454	177462	177470	177470	he	4683	" But I 'd have liked to . "
177464	177469	177470	177470	he	4683	" You 're right , "
177477	177484	177581	177581	he	4683	" Oh ! I 'm right . "
177577	177580	177581	177581	he	4683	" Ugh ! "
177588	177591	177713	177713	he	561	" Oh ! "
177708	177712	177859	177859	he	561	" ' M'm , "
177855	177858	177870	177870	Trafford	394	" Well , "
177865	177868	178185	178185	Marjorie	323	" Well , "
178169	178177	178465	178465	he	4713	" Everyone well , love from all . "
178461	178464	178465	178465	he	4713	" Marjorie , "
178468	178476	178502	178502	him	4713	" d'you remember ? Old donkey cart ? "
178505	178553	None	None	None	None	" You know , that old cart ! Under the overhanging trees ! So thick and green they met overhead ! You know ! When you and I had our first talk together ! In the lane . It was n't so fast as this , eh ? "
