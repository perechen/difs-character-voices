2562	2572	2539	2539	German	204	" A striking girl that Miss Harleth unlike others . "
2573	2603	2539	2539	German	204	" Yes , she has got herself up as a sort of serpent now all green and silver , and winds her neck about a little more than usual . "
2604	2634	2539	2539	German	204	" Oh , she must always be doing something extraordinary . She is that kind of girl , I fancy . Do you think her pretty , Mr. Vandernoodt ? "
2635	2651	2539	2539	German	204	" Very . A man might risk hanging for her I mean a fool might . "
2652	2666	2539	2539	German	204	" You like a nez retroussť , then , and long narrow eyes ? "
2667	2676	2539	2539	German	204	" When they go with such an ensemble . "
2677	2683	2539	2539	German	204	" The ensemble du serpent ? "
2684	2700	2539	2539	German	204	" If you will . Woman was tempted by a serpent ; why not man ? "
2701	2729	2539	2539	German	204	" She is certainly very graceful ; but she wants a tinge of color in her cheeks . It is a sort of Lamia beauty she has . "
2730	2791	2539	2539	German	204	" On the contrary , I think her complexion one of her chief charms . It is a warm paleness ; it looks thoroughly healthy . And that delicate nose with its gradual little upward curve is distracting . And then her mouth there never was a prettier mouth , the lips curled backward so finely , eh , Mackworth ? "
2792	2833	2539	2539	German	204	" Think so ? I can not endure that sort of mouth . It looks so self - complacent , as if it knew its own beauty the curves are too immovable . I like a mouth that trembles more . "
2834	2844	2846	2847	a dowager	860	" For my part , I think her odious , "
2849	2870	2846	2847	a dowager	860	" It is wonderful what unpleasant girls get into vogue . Who are these Langens ? Does anybody know them ? "
2871	2916	2539	2539	German	204	" They are quite comme il faut . I have dined with them several times at the Russie . The baroness is English . Miss Harleth calls her cousin . The girl herself is thoroughly well - bred , and as clever as possible . "
2917	2925	2846	2847	a dowager	860	" Dear me ! and the baron ? "
2927	2934	2539	2539	German	204	" A very good furniture picture . "
2935	2946	2948	2948	Mackworth	207	" Your baroness is always at the roulette - table , "
2950	2961	2948	2948	Mackworth	207	" I fancy she has taught the girl to gamble . "
2962	2997	2539	2539	German	204	" Oh , the old woman plays a very sober game ; drops a ten - franc piece here and there . The girl is more headlong . But it is only a freak . "
2998	3018	2948	2948	Mackworth	207	" I hear she has lost all her winnings to - day . Are they rich ? Who knows ? "
3019	3031	3033	3034	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" Ah , who knows ? Who knows that about anybody ? "
3110	3118	3120	3120	Gwendolen	289	" Mr. Vandernoodt , you know everybody , "
3142	3150	3134	3134	she	289	" Who is that near the door ? "
3151	3174	3134	3134	she	289	" There are half a dozen near the door . Do you mean that old Adonis in the George the Fourth wig ? "
3175	3194	3134	3134	she	289	" No , no ; the dark - haired young man on the right with the dreadful expression . "
3195	3212	3134	3134	she	289	" Dreadful , do you call it ? I think he is an uncommonly fine fellow . "
3213	3219	3134	3134	she	289	" But who is he ? "
3220	3233	3134	3134	she	289	" He is lately come to our hotel with Sir Hugo Mallinger . "
3234	3239	3134	3134	she	289	" Sir Hugo Mallinger ? "
3240	3248	3134	3134	she	289	" Yes . Do you know him ? "
3249	3252	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" No . "
3257	3286	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" He has a place near us , but he never comes to it . What did you say was the name of that gentleman near the door ? "
3287	3292	3134	3134	she	289	" Deronda Mr. Deronda . "
3293	3304	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" What a delightful name ! Is he an Englishman ? "
3305	3326	3134	3134	she	289	" Yes . He is reported to be rather closely related to the baronet . You are interested in him ? "
3327	3341	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" Yes . I think he is not like young men in general . "
3342	3353	3134	3134	she	289	" And you do n't admire young men in general ? "
3354	3386	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" Not in the least . I always know what they will say . I ca n't at all guess what this Mr. Deronda would say . What does he say ? "
3387	3421	3134	3134	she	289	" Nothing , chiefly . I sat with his party for a good hour last night on the terrace , and he never spoke and was not smoking either . He looked bored . "
3422	3438	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" Another reason why I should like to know him . I am always bored . "
3439	3465	3134	3134	she	289	" I should think he would be charmed to have an introduction . Shall I bring it about ? Will you allow it , baroness ? "
3466	3494	3253	3253	Gwendolen	289	" Why not ? since he is related to Sir Hugo Mallinger . It is a new rŰle of yours , Gwendolen , to be always bored , "
3507	3522	3134	3134	she	289	" Until now you have always seemed eager about something from morning till night . "
3523	3571	3496	3498	Madame von Langen	211	" That is just because I am bored to death . If I am to leave off play I must break my arm or my collar - bone . I must make something happen ; unless you will go into Switzerland and take me up the Matterhorn . "
3572	3586	3603	3604	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" Perhaps this Mr. Deronda 's acquaintance will do instead of the Matterhorn . "
3587	3590	3496	3498	Madame von Langen	211	" Perhaps . "
4514	4518	4519	4519	Her	289	" Poor mamma ! "
6215	6243	6296	6296	Deronda	289	" A stranger who has found Miss Harleth 's necklace returns it to her with the hope that she will not again risk the loss of it . "
6283	6286	6298	6298	he	936	" the stranger "
6390	6687	6387	6389	the ' stranger	938	" were he and no other , it would be something too gross for her to let him know that she had divined this , and to meet him again with that recognition in their minds . He knew very well that he was entangling her in helpless humiliation : it was another way of smiling at her ironically , and taking the air of a supercilious mentor . Gwendolen felt the bitter tears of mortification rising and rolling down her cheeks . No one had ever before dared to treat her with irony and contempt . One thing was clear : she must carry out her resolution to quit this place at once ; it was impossible for her to reappear in the public salon , still less stand at the gaming - table with the risk of seeing Deronda . Now came an importunate knock at the door : breakfast was ready . Gwendolen with a passionate movement thrust necklace , cambric , scrap of paper , and all into her nťcessaire , pressed her handkerchief against her face , and after pausing a minute or two to summon back her proud self - control , went to join her friends . Such signs of tears and fatigue as were left seemed accordant enough with the account she at once gave of her having sat up to do her packing , instead of waiting for help from her friend 's maid . There was much protestation , as she had expected , against her traveling alone , but she persisted in refusing any arrangements for companionship . She would be put into the ladies ' compartment and go right on . She could rest exceedingly well in the train , and was afraid of nothing .

7807	7826	7778	7778	Gwendolen	289	" Why did you marry again , mamma ? It would have been nicer if you had not . "
7857	7865	7847	7847	she	330	" You have no feeling , child ! "
8547	8560	8562	8563	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Well , dear , what do you think of the place , "
8574	8581	8583	8583	Gwendolen	289	" I think it is charming , "
8587	8617	8583	8583	Gwendolen	289	" A romantic place ; anything delightful may happen in it ; it would be a good background for anything . No one need be ashamed of living here . "
8618	8627	8717	8717	she	330	" There is certainly nothing common about it . "
8628	8691	8693	8693	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , it would do for fallen royalty or any sort of grand poverty . We ought properly to have been living in splendor , and have come down to this . It would have been as romantic as could be . But I thought my uncle and aunt Gascoigne would be here to meet us , and my cousin Anna , "
8702	8707	8709	8710	Mrs. Davilow	330	" We are early , "
8726	8734	8717	8717	she	330	" You expect Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne ? "
8735	8838	8717	8717	she	330	" Yes , madam ; they were here yesterday to give particular orders about the fires and the dinner . But as to fires , I 've had 'em in all the rooms for the last week , and everything is well aired . I could wish some of the furniture paid better for all the cleaning it 's had , but I think you 'll see the brasses have been done justice to . I think when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne come , they 'll tell you nothing has been neglected . They 'll be here at five , for certain . "
8969	8978	8980	8980	Gwendolen	289	" Mamma , mamma , pray come here ! "
8993	9032	8982	8983	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Here is an organ . I will be Saint Cecilia : some one shall paint me as Saint Cecilia . Jocosa this was her name for Miss Merry , let down my hair . See , mamma ? "
9104	9112	9098	9099	Mrs. Davilow	330	" A charming picture , my dear ! "
9156	9166	9167	9167	she	330	" What a queer , quaint , picturesque room ! "
9175	9217	9167	9167	she	330	" I like these old embroidered chairs , and the garlands on the wainscot , and the pictures that may be anything . That one with the ribs nothing but ribs and darkness I should think that is Spanish , mamma . "
9218	9223	9236	9236	she	1058	" Oh , Gwendolen ! "
9289	9293	9295	9296	Mrs. Davilow	330	" How horrible ! "
9325	9338	9311	9311	Isabel	227	" You will never stay in this room by yourself , Gwendolen . "
9339	9358	9363	9363	her	289	" How dare you open things which were meant to be shut up , you perverse little creature ? "
9386	9427	9379	9379	she	289	" There is a lock where is the key ? Let the key be found , or else let one be made , and let nobody open it again ; or rather , let the key be brought to me . "
9453	9465	9435	9435	Gwendolen	289	" Let us go up to our own room , mamma . "
9507	9519	9521	9521	Bugle	234	" I do n't know what you mean , Mrs. Startin , "
9551	9572	9574	9575	Mrs. Startin	235	" I mean the young lady that 's to command us all - and well worthy for looks and figure , "
9579	9588	9574	9575	Mrs. Startin	235	" She 'll know what key it is . "
9589	9608	9609	9609	Gwendolen	289	" If you have laid out what we want , go and see to the others , Bugle , "
9648	9654	9614	9614	she	289	" I will help mamma . "
9690	9712	9714	9715	Mrs. Davilow	330	" That is a becoming glass , Gwendolen ; or is it the black and gold color that sets you off ? "
9743	9759	9761	9761	Gwendolen	289	" I should make a tolerable St. Cecilia with some white roses on my head , "
9763	9826	9761	9761	Gwendolen	289	" only how about my nose , mamma ? I think saint 's noses never in the least turn up . I wish you had given me your perfectly straight nose ; it would have done for any sort of character a nose of all work . Mine is only a happy nose ; it would not do so well for tragedy . "
9827	9845	9847	9848	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh , my dear , any nose will do to be miserable with in this world , "
9872	9877	9879	9879	Gwendolen	289	" Now , mamma , "
9898	9930	9879	9879	Gwendolen	289	" do n't begin to be dull here . It spoils all my pleasure , and everything may be so happy now . What have you to be gloomy about now ? "
9931	9936	9938	9939	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Nothing , dear , "
9954	9966	9938	9939	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It is always enough for me to see you happy . "
9967	9975	9977	9977	Gwendolen	289	" But you should be happy yourself , "
9992	10060	9977	9977	Gwendolen	289	" Can nobody be happy after they are quite young ? You have made me feel sometimes as if nothing were of any use . With the girls so troublesome , and Jocosa so dreadfully wooden and ugly , and everything make - shift about us , and you looking so dull what was the use of my being anything ? But now you might be happy . "
10061	10068	10070	10071	Mrs. Davilow	330	" So I shall , dear , "
10082	10097	10099	10099	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , but really . Not with a sort of make - believe , "
10105	10129	10099	10099	Gwendolen	289	" See what a hand and arm ! much more beautiful than mine . Any one can see you were altogether more beautiful . "
10130	10150	10070	10071	Mrs. Davilow	330	" No , no , dear ; I was always heavier . Never half so charming as you are . "
10151	10186	10099	10099	Gwendolen	289	" Well , but what is the use of my being charming , if it is to end in my being dull and not minding anything ? Is that what marriage always comes to ? "
10187	10212	10070	10071	Mrs. Davilow	330	" No , child , certainly not . Marriage is the only happy state for a woman , as I trust you will prove . "
10213	10286	10287	10287	Gwendolen	289	" I will not put up with it if it is not a happy state . I am determined to be happy at least not to go on muddling away my life as other people do , being and doing nothing remarkable . I have made up my mind not to let other people interfere with me as they have done . Here is some warm water ready for you , mamma , "
10331	10343	10320	10321	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I am sure I have never crossed you , Gwendolen . "
10344	10357	10287	10287	Gwendolen	289	" You often want me to do what I do n't like . "
10358	10367	10320	10321	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You mean , to give Alice lessons ? "
10368	10441	10287	10287	Gwendolen	289	" Yes . And I have done it because you asked me . But I do n't see why I should , else . It bores me to death , she is so slow . She has no ear for music , or language , or anything else . It would be much better for her to be ignorant , mamma : it is her rŰle , she would do it well . "
10442	10472	10320	10321	Mrs. Davilow	330	" That is a hard thing to say of your poor sister , Gwendolen , who is so good to you , and waits on you hand and foot . "
10473	10522	10287	10287	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't see why it is hard to call things by their right names , and put them in their proper places . The hardship is for me to have to waste my time on her . Now let me fasten up your hair , mamma . "
10523	10589	10320	10321	Mrs. Davilow	330	" We must make haste ; your uncle and aunt will be here soon . For heaven 's sake , do n't be scornful to them , my dear child ! or to your cousin Anna , whom you will always be going out with . Do promise me , Gwendolen . You know , you ca n't expect Anna to be equal to you . "
10590	10600	10602	10602	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't want her to be equal , "
11369	11377	11352	11363	the acrid , unsuccessful kind , whose secret history is summed up	1105	" Sold , but not paid for . "
11510	11519	11508	11508	he	1106	" You have outgrown Anna , my dear , "
11544	11572	11573	11573	He	1106	" She is not so old as you by a year , but her growing days are certainly over . I hope you will be excellent companions . "
11648	11682	11625	11625	Gwendolen	289	" A companion is just what I want . I am so glad we are come to live here . And mamma will be much happier now she is near you , aunt . "
11867	11874	11876	11876	Gwendolen	289	" You have brothers , Anna , "
11885	11893	11876	11876	Gwendolen	289	" I think you are enviable there . "
11894	11897	11899	11899	Anna	229	" Yes , "
11903	11956	11899	11899	Anna	229	" I am very fond of them ; but of course their education is a great anxiety to papa . He used to say they made me a tomboy . I really was a great romp with Rex . I think you will like Rex . He will come home before Christmas . "
11957	11981	11983	11983	Gwendolen	289	" I remember I used to think you rather wild and shy ; but it is difficult now to imagine you a romp , "
11987	12086	11876	11876	Gwendolen	289	" Of course , I am altered now ; I am come out , and all that . But in reality I like to go blackberrying with Edwy and Lotta as well as ever . I am not very fond of going out ; but I dare say I shall like it better now you will be often with me . I am not at all clever , and I never know what to say . It seems so useless to say what everybody knows , and I can think of nothing else , except what papa says . "
12087	12098	12100	12100	Gwendolen	289	" I shall like going out with you very much , "
12109	12116	12100	12100	Gwendolen	289	" Are you fond of riding ? "
12117	12154	11876	11876	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , but we have only one Shetland pony amongst us . Papa says he ca n't afford more , besides the carriage - horses and his own nag ; he has so many expenses . "
12155	12169	12171	12171	Gwendolen	289	" I intend to have a horse and ride a great deal now , "
12179	12188	12171	12171	Gwendolen	289	" Is the society pleasant in this neighborhood ? "
12189	12259	11876	11876	Gwendolen	289	" Papa says it is , very . There are the clergymen all about , you know ; and the Quallons , and the Arrowpoints , and Lord Brackenshaw , and Sir Hugo Mallinger 's place , where there is nobody that 's very nice , because we make picnics there and two or three families at Wanchester : oh , and old Mrs. Vulcany , at Nuttingwood , and "
12326	12345	12351	12351	his	1106	" And it is always worth while to make a little sacrifice for a good style of house , "
12372	12485	12351	12351	his	1106	" especially where there is only a lady at the head . All the best people will call upon you ; and you need give no expensive dinners . Of course , I have to spend a good deal in that way ; it is a large item . But then I get my house for nothing . If I had to pay three hundred a year for my house I could not keep a table . My boys are too great a drain on me . You are better off than we are , in proportion ; there is no great drain on you now , after your house and carriage . "
12486	12509	12511	12512	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" I assure you , Fanny , now that the children are growing up , I am obliged to cut and contrive , "
12514	12609	12511	12512	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" I am not a good manager by nature , but Henry has taught me . He is wonderful for making the best of everything ; he allows himself no extras , and gets his curates for nothing . It is rather hard that he has not been made a prebendary or something , as others have been , considering the friends he has made and the need there is for men of moderate opinions in all respects . If the Church is to keep its position , ability and character ought to tell . "
12610	12708	12710	12711	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Oh , my dear Nancy , you forget the old story thank Heaven , there are three hundred as good as I. And ultimately , we shall have no reason to complain , I am pretty sure . There could hardly be a more thorough friend than Lord Brackenshaw your landlord , you know , Fanny . Lady Brackenshaw will call upon you . And I have spoken for Gwendolen to be a member of our Archery Club the Brackenshaw Archery Club the most select thing anywhere . That is , if she has no objection , "
12720	12729	12731	12731	Gwendolen	289	" I should like it of all things , "
12733	12746	12747	12747	she	289	" There is nothing I enjoy more than taking aim and hitting , "
12757	12947	12969	12969	Gwendolen	289	" Our Anna , poor child , is too short - sighed for archery . But I consider myself a first - rate shot , and you shall practice with me . I must make you an accomplished archer before our great meeting in July . In fact , as to neighborhood , you could hardly be better placed . There are the Arrowpoints they are some of our best people . Miss Arrowpoint is a delightful girl she has been presented at Court . They have a magnificent place Quetcham Hall worth seeing in point of art ; and their parties , to which you are sure to be invited , are the best things of the sort we have . The archdeacon is intimate there , and they have always a good kind of people staying in the house . Mrs. Arrowpoint is peculiar , certainly ; something of a caricature , in fact ; but well - meaning . And Miss Arrowpoint is as nice as possible . It is not all young ladies who have mothers as handsome and graceful as yours and Anna 's . "
12972	12991	12961	12961	wife	1135	" My uncle and aunt , at least , are happy : they are not dull and dismal . "
13275	13289	13267	13267	she	289	" Mamma , you have not spoken to my uncle about my riding . "
13290	13311	13313	13314	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Gwendolen desires above all things to have a horse to ride a pretty , light , lady 's horse , "
13321	13330	13313	13314	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Do you think we can manage it ? "
13362	13371	13373	13374	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" We could lend her the pony sometimes , "
13392	13415	13417	13417	Gwendolen	289	" That might be inconveniencing others , aunt , and would be no pleasure to me . I can not endure ponies , "
13419	13433	13417	13417	Gwendolen	289	" I would rather give up some other indulgence and have a horse . "
13459	13492	13494	13495	Mrs. Davilow	330	" She rides so well . She has had lessons , and the riding - master said she had so good a seat and hand she might be trusted with any mount , "
13527	13548	13550	13551	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" There is the price of the horse a good sixty with the best chance , and then his keep , "
13572	13594	13550	13551	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" There are the carriage - horses already a heavy item . And remember what you ladies cost in toilet now . "
13595	13605	13607	13608	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I really wear nothing but two black dresses , "
13612	13641	13607	13608	Mrs. Davilow	330	" And the younger girls , of course , require no toilet at present . Besides , Gwendolen will save me so much by giving her sisters lessons . "
13653	13674	13643	13644	Mrs. Davilow	330	" If it were not for that , I must really have a more expensive governess , and masters besides . "
13688	13697	13699	13700	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" That is good that is decidedly good , "
13748	13760	13762	13763	Mrs. Davilow	330	" The dear child has had no indulgences , no pleasures , "
13770	13811	13762	13763	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I feel the expense is rather imprudent in this first year of our settling . But she really needs the exercise she needs cheering . And if you were to see her on horseback , it is something splendid . "
13812	13823	13825	13826	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" It is what we could not afford for Anna , "
13828	13846	13825	13826	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" But she , dear child , would ride Lotta 's donkey and think it good enough . "
13878	13891	13893	13894	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Certainly , a fine woman never looks better than on horseback , "
13896	13916	13893	13894	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" And Gwendolen has the figure for it . I do n't say the thing should not be considered . "
13917	13939	13941	13942	Mrs. Davilow	330	" We might try it for a time , at all events . It can be given up , if necessary , "
13944	13966	13893	13894	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Well , I will consult Lord Brackenshaw 's head groom . He is my fidus Achates in the horsey way . "
13967	13970	13972	13973	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Thanks , "
13978	13984	13972	13973	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You are very kind . "
13985	13991	13993	13994	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" That he always is , "
14012	14068	14010	14010	she	330	" I thought you were almost too indulgent about the horse for Gwendolen . She ought not to claim so much more than your own daughter would think of . Especially before we see how Fanny manages on her income . And you really have enough to do without taking all this trouble on yourself . "
14069	14194	14010	14010	she	330	" My dear Nancy , one must look at things from every point of view . This girl is really worth some expense : you do n't often see her equal . She ought to make a first - rate marriage , and I should not be doing my duty if I spared my trouble in helping her forward . You know yourself she has been under a disadvantage with such a father - in - law , and a second family , keeping her always in the shade . I feel for the girl , And I should like your sister and her family now to have the benefit of your having married rather a better specimen of our kind than she did . "
14195	14262	14010	14010	she	330	" Rather better ! I should think so . However , it is for me to be grateful that you will take so much on your shoulders for the sake of my sister and her children . I am sure I would not grudge anything to poor Fanny . But there is one thing I have been thinking of , though you have never mentioned it . "
14263	14268	14010	14010	she	330	" What is that ? "
14269	14285	14010	14010	she	330	" The boys . I hope they will not be falling in love with Gwendolen . "
14286	14421	14010	14010	she	330	" Do n't presuppose anything of the kind , my dear , and there will be no danger . Rex will never be at home for long together , and Warham is going to India . It is the wiser plan to take it for granted that cousins will not fall in love . If you begin with precautions , the affair will come in spite of them . One must not undertake to act for Providence in these matters , which can no more be held under the hand than a brood of chickens . The boys will have nothing , and Gwendolen will have nothing . They ca n't marry . At the worst there would only be a little crying , and you ca n't save boys and girls from that . "
14463	14492	14010	14010	she	330	" Gorgibus . Je te dis que le mariage est une chose sainte et sacrťe : et que c'est faire en honnetes gens , que de dťbuter par la .
14493	14557	14558	14558	MOLIERE	257	" Madelon . Mon Dieu ! que si tout le monde vous ressemblait , un roman serait bientŰt fini ! La belle chose que ce serait , si d'abord Cyrus ťpousait Mandane , et qu'Aronce de plain - pied fut mariť a Clťlie ! Laissez - nous faire a loisir le tissu de notre roman , et n'en pressez pas tant la conclusion . "
15177	15190	15192	15193	Miss Merry	228	" Gwendolen will not rest without having the world at her feet , "
15435	15438	15439	15439	she	289	" education , "
15712	15720	15708	15709	the maid	958	" This will never do for Miss Harleth "
16471	16488	16494	16494	Gwendolen	289	" Her wit Values itself so highly , that to her All matter else seems weak . "
16834	16841	16843	16844	the archdeacon	7817	" Who is that with Gascoigne ? "
16886	16893	16876	16897	a hopeful young scholar , who had already suggested some " not less elegant than ingenious , " emendations of Greek texts	1252	" not less elegant than ingenious , "
16905	16924	16876	16897	a hopeful young scholar , who had already suggested some " not less elegant than ingenious , " emendations of Greek texts	1252	" By George ! who is that girl with the awfully well - set head and jolly figure ? "
17057	17072	17074	17075	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" She is not really so handsome if you come to examine her features , "
17087	17111	17074	17075	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" It is a certain style she has , which produces a great effect at first , but afterward she is less agreeable . "
17480	17500	17501	17502	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You are fond of books as well as of music , riding , and archery , I hear , "
17523	17536	17501	17502	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Catherine will be very glad to have so sympathetic a neighbor . "
17578	17612	17573	17573	she	289	" It is I who am fortunate . Miss Arrowpoint will teach me what good music is . I shall be entirely a learner . I hear that she is a thorough musician . "
17613	17686	17878	17879	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Catherine has certainly had every advantage . We have a first - rate musician in the house now Herr Klesmer ; perhaps you know all his compositions . You must allow me to introduce him to you . You sing , I believe . Catherine plays three instruments , but she does not sing . I hope you will let us hear you . I understand you are an accomplished singer . "
17687	17709	17573	17573	she	289	" Oh , no ! ' die Kraft ist schwach , allein die Lust ist gross , ' as Mephistopheles says . "
17710	17734	17878	17879	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Ah , you are a student of Goethe . Young ladies are so advanced now . I suppose you have read everything . "
17735	17826	17573	17573	she	289	" No , really . I shall be so glad if you will tell me what to read . I have been looking into all the books in the library at Offendene , but there is nothing readable . The leaves all stick together and smell musty . I wish I could write books to amuse myself , as you can ! How delightful it must be to write books after one 's own taste instead of reading other people 's ! Home - made books must be so nice . "
17858	17868	17856	17856	Gwendolen	289	" I would give anything to write a book ! "
17869	17876	17878	17879	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" And why should you not ? "
17883	17917	17878	17879	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You have but to begin as I did . Pen , ink , and paper are at everybody 's command . But I will send you all I have written with pleasure . "
17918	17970	17972	17972	Gwendolen	289	" Thanks . I shall be so glad to read your writings . Being acquainted with authors must give a peculiar understanding of their books : one would be able to tell then which parts were funny and which serious . I am sure I often laugh in the wrong place . "
17983	18014	17973	17973	herself	289	" In Shakespeare , you know , and other great writers that we can never see . But I always want to know more than there is in the books . "
18015	18035	18037	18038	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" If you are interested in any of my subjects I can lend you many extra sheets in manuscript , "
18058	18102	17972	17972	Gwendolen	289	" These are things I dare say I shall publish eventually : several friends have urged me to do so , and one does n't like to be obstinate . My Tasso , for example I could have made it twice the size . "
18103	18109	18111	18111	Gwendolen	289	" I dote on Tasso , "
18113	18207	17972	17972	Gwendolen	289	" Well , you shall have all my papers , if you like . So many , you know , have written about Tasso ; but they are all wrong . As to the particular nature of his madness , and his feelings for Leonora , and the real cause of his imprisonment , and the character of Leonora , who , in my opinion , was a cold - hearted woman , else she would have married him in spite of her brother they are all wrong . I differ from everybody . "
18208	18213	18215	18215	Gwendolen	289	" How very interesting ! "
18217	18250	18215	18215	Gwendolen	289	" I like to differ from everybody . I think it is so stupid to agree . That is the worst of writing your opinions ; and make people agree with you . "
18284	18305	18272	18272	Gwendolen	289	" I know nothing of Tasso except the Gerusalemme Liberata , which we read and learned by heart at school . "
18306	18353	18263	18263	her	253	" Ah , his life is more interesting than his poetry , I have constructed the early part of his life as a sort of romance . When one thinks of his father Bernardo , and so on , there is much that must be true . "
18354	18362	18364	18364	Gwendolen	289	" Imagination is often truer than fact , "
18387	18412	18369	18369	she	289	" I shall be so glad to learn all about Tasso and his madness especially . I suppose poets are always a little mad . "
18413	18433	18369	18369	she	289	" To be sure ' the poet 's eye in a fine frenzy rolling ' ; and somebody says of Marlowe
18454	18455	18440	18440	he	1278	" "
18467	18472	18477	18477	them	1281	" said Gwendolen innocently . "
18491	18491	18484	18485	Mad people	1282	"
18529	18537	18539	18540	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Ah , here comes Herr Klesmer , "
18935	18938	18940	18941	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" Charming ? "
19038	19059	19022	19022	she	289	" It would be too cruel to a great musician . You can not like to hear poor amateur singing . "
19060	19070	19072	19073	Herr Klesmer	265	" No , truly ; but that makes nothing , "
19114	19128	19108	19108	they	276	" That makes nothing . It is always acceptable to see you sing . "
19220	19290	19172	19173	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" Imagine what I have to go through with this professor ! He can hardly tolerate anything we English do in music . We can only put up with his severity , and make use of it to find out the worst that can be said of us . It is a little comfort to know that ; and one can bear it when every one else is admiring . "
19291	19306	19311	19311	herself	289	" I should be very much obliged to him for telling me the worst , "
19313	19335	19311	19311	herself	289	" I dare say I have been extremely ill taught , in addition to having no talent only liking for music . "
19351	19365	19367	19368	Herr Klesmer	265	" Yes , it is true : you have not been well taught , "
19383	19510	19372	19372	Woman	7660	" Still , you are not quite without gifts . You sing in tune , and you have a pretty fair organ . But you produce your notes badly ; and that music which you sing is beneath you . It is a form of melody which expresses a puerile state of culture a dawdling , canting , see - saw kind of stuff the passion and thought of people without any breadth of horizon . There is a sort of self - satisfied folly about every phrase of such melody ; no cries of deep , mysterious passion no conflict no sense of the universal . It makes men small as they listen to it . Sing now something larger . And I shall see . "
19511	19522	19524	19524	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , not now by - and - by , "
19576	19624	19570	19571	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" Yes , by - and - by . I always require half an hour to get up my courage after being criticised by Herr Klesmer . We will ask him to play to us now : he is bound to show us what is good music . "
19812	19825	19827	19828	young Clintock	279	" I wish you would sing to us again , Miss Harleth , "
19864	19913	19857	19858	Herr Klesmer	265	" That is the style of music for me . I never can make anything of this tip - top playing . It is like a jar of leeches , where you can never tell either beginnings or endings . I could listen to your singing all day . "
19914	19934	19936	19937	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Yes , we should be glad of something popular now another song from you would be a relaxation , "
19948	19996	19998	19998	Gwendolen	289	" That must be because you are in a puerile state of culture , and have no breadth of horizon . I have just learned that . I have been taught how bad my taste is , and am feeling growing pains . They are never pleasant , "
20032	20042	20019	20020	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Well , we will not press anything disagreeably , "
20089	20098	20107	20107	his	279	" I am glad you like this neighborhood , "
20114	20131	20181	20182	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Exceedingly . There seems to be a little of everything and not much of anything . "
20132	20139	20181	20182	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" That is rather equivocal praise . "
20140	20180	20181	20182	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Not with me . I like a little of everything ; a little absurdity , for example , is very amusing . I am thankful for a few queer people ; but much of them is a bore . "
20215	20228	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" I think there should be more croquet , for one thing , "
20232	20315	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" I am usually away , but if I were more here I should go in for a croquet club . You are one of the archers , I think . But depend upon it croquet is the game of the future . It wants writing up , though . One of our best men has written a poem on it , in four cantos ; as good as Pope . I want him to publish it You never read anything better . "
20316	20334	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" I shall study croquet to - morrow . I shall take to it instead of singing . "
20335	20366	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" No , no , not that ; but do take to croquet . I will send you Jenning 's poem if you like . I have a manuscript copy . "
20367	20376	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" Is he a great friend of yours ? "
20377	20382	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" Well , rather . "
20383	20446	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" Oh , if he is only rather , I think I will decline . Or , if you send it to me , will you promise not to catechise me upon it and ask me which part I like best ? Because it is not so easy to know a poem without reading it as to know a sermon without listening . "
20447	20450	20229	20230	young Clintock	279	" Decidedly , "
20455	20472	20451	20452	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" this girl is double and satirical . I shall be on my guard against her . "
20543	20571	20572	20572	FONTENELLE	282	" Croyez - vous m'avoir humiliťe pour m'avoir appris que la terre tourne autour du soleil ? Je vous jure que je ne m'en estime pas moins . "
21718	21729	21731	21731	Gwendolen	289	" Do I look as well as Rachel , mamma ? "
21759	21767	21769	21770	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You have better arms than Rachel , "
21772	21798	21769	21770	Mrs. Davilow	330	" your arms would do for anything , Gwen . But your voice is not so tragic as hers ; it is not so deep . "
21799	21810	21812	21812	Gwendolen	289	" I can make it deeper , if I like , "
21823	21857	21817	21817	she	289	" I think a higher voice is more tragic : it is more feminine ; and the more feminine a woman is , the more tragic it seems when she does desperate actions . "
21858	21866	21868	21869	Mrs. Davilow	330	" There may be something in that , "
21873	21911	21868	21869	Mrs. Davilow	330	" But I do n't know what good there is in making one 's blood creep . And if there is anything horrible to be done , I should like it to be left to the men . "
21912	21943	21817	21817	she	289	" Oh , mamma , you are so dreadfully prosaic ! As if all the great poetic criminals were not women ! I think the men are poor cautious creatures . "
21944	21975	21868	21869	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Well , dear , and you who are afraid to be alone in the night I do n't think you would be very bold in crime , thank God . "
21976	21986	21988	21988	Gwendolen	289	" I am not talking about reality , mamma , "
22018	22084	22002	22002	she	289	" Anna , do ask my uncle to let us get up some charades at the rectory . Mr. Middleton and Warham could act with us just for practice . Mamma says it will not do to have Mr. Middleton consulting and rehearsing here . He is a stick , but we could give him suitable parts . Do ask , or else I will . "
22085	22126	22002	22002	she	289	" Oh , not till Rex comes . He is so clever , and such a dear old thing , and he will act Napoleon looking over the sea . He looks just like Napoleon . Rex can do anything . "
22127	22141	22143	22143	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't in the least believe in your Rex , Anna , "
22149	22177	22143	22143	Gwendolen	289	" He will turn out to be like those wretched blue and yellow water - colors of his which you hang up in your bedroom and worship . "
22178	22186	22188	22188	Anna	229	" Very well , you will see , "
22190	22241	22188	22188	Anna	229	" It is not that I know what is clever , but he has got a scholarship already , and papa says he will get a fellowship , and nobody is better at games . He is cleverer than Mr. Middleton , and everybody but you call Mr. Middleton clever . "
22242	22300	22143	22143	Gwendolen	289	" So he may be in a dark - lantern sort of way . But he is a stick . If he had to say , ' Perdition catch my soul , but I do love her , ' he would say it in just the same tone as , ' Here endeth the second lesson . ' "
22301	22306	22308	22308	Anna	229	" Oh , Gwendolen ! "
22316	22381	22308	22308	Anna	229	" And it is very unkind of you to speak so of him , for he admires you very much . I heard Warham say one day to mamma , ' Middleton is regularly spooney upon Gwendolen . ' She was very angry with him ; but I know what it means . It is what they say at college for being in love . "
22382	22389	22391	22391	Gwendolen	289	" How can I help it ? "
22396	22406	22391	22391	Gwendolen	289	" Perdition catch my soul if I love him . "
22407	22441	22308	22308	Anna	229	" No , of course ; papa , I think , would not wish it . And he is to go away soon . But it makes me sorry when you ridicule him . "
22442	22454	22456	22456	Gwendolen	289	" What shall you do to me when I ridicule Rex ? "
22460	22471	22473	22473	Anna	229	" Now , Gwendolen , dear , you will not ? "
22481	22576	22473	22473	Anna	229	" I could not bear it . But there really is nothing in him to ridicule . Only you may find out things . For no one ever thought of laughing at Mr. Middleton before you . Every one said he was nice - looking , and his manners perfect . I am sure I have always been frightened at him because of his learning and his square - cut coat , and his being a nephew of the bishop 's , and all that . But you will not ridicule Rex promise me . "
22587	22595	22596	22596	she	229	" You are a dear little coz , "
22613	22640	22596	22596	she	229	" I do n't ever want to do anything that will vex you . Especially if Rex is to make everything come off charades and everything . "
22790	22795	22881	22881	she	289	" what some fellows did "

24021	24031	24033	24034	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Something pleasant , children , I beseech you , "
24036	24045	24033	24034	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I ca n't have any Greek wickedness . "
24046	24057	24059	24059	Gwendolen	289	" It is no worse than Christian wickedness , mamma , "
24072	24077	24079	24079	Rex	241	" And less scandalous , "
24081	24128	24079	24079	Rex	241	" Besides , one thinks of it as all gone by and done with . What do you say to Briseis being led away ? I would be Achilles , and you would be looking round at me after the print we have at the rectory . "
24129	24139	24141	24141	Gwendolen	289	" That would be a good attitude for me , "
24156	24179	24151	24151	she	289	" No . It will not do . There must be three men in proper costume , else it will be ridiculous . "
24180	24185	24187	24187	Rex	241	" I have it , "
24194	24226	24227	24227	he	241	" Hermione as the statue in Winter 's Tale ? I will be Leontes , and Miss Merry , Paulina , one on each side . Our dress wo n't signify , "
24232	24253	24227	24227	he	241	" it will be more Shakespearian and romantic if Leontes looks like Napoleon , and Paulina like a modern spinster . "
24644	24652	24654	24656	Paulina Mrs. Davilow	330	" Music , awake her , strike ! "
24948	24956	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" A magnificent bit of plastik that ! "
24975	24983	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" Was it part of the play ? "
24984	25003	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" Oh , no , surely not . Miss Harleth was too much affected . A sensitive creature ! "
25004	25024	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" Dear me ! I was not aware that there was a painting behind that panel ; were you ? "
25025	25047	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" No ; how should I ? Some eccentricity in one of the Earl 's family long ago , I suppose . "
25048	25058	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" How very painful ! Pray shut it up . "
25059	25076	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" Was the door locked ? It is very mysterious . It must be the spirits . "
25077	25085	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" But there is no medium present . "
25086	25105	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" How do you know that ? We must conclude that there is , when such things happen . "
25106	25129	24958	24958	Klesmer	265	" Oh , the door was not locked ; it was probably the sudden vibration from the piano that sent it open . "
25210	25217	25192	25193	the rector	1395	" it will not start open again "
25268	25291	25263	25263	Klesmer	265	" We have to thank you for devising a perfect climax : you could not have chosen a finer bit of plastik , "
25671	25706	25663	25663	Gwendolen	289	" I know the door was locked before the housekeeper gave me the key , for I tried it myself afterward . Some one must have been to my drawer and taken the key . "
25742	25749	25734	25734	she	289	" Please forgive me , Gwendolen . "

27172	27180	27182	27182	Anna	229	" Where are you going , Rex ? "
27226	27239	27205	27205	she	229	" Going to see the hounds throw off at the Three Barns . "
27240	27248	27250	27250	Anna	229	" Are you going to take Gwendolen ? "
27254	27262	27205	27205	she	229	" She told you , did she ? "
27263	27276	27205	27205	she	229	" No , but I thought Does papa know you are going ? "
27277	27297	27205	27205	she	229	" Not that I am aware of . I do n't suppose he would trouble himself about the matter . "
27298	27307	27205	27205	she	229	" You are going to use his horse ? "
27308	27318	27205	27205	she	229	" He knows I do that whenever I can . "
27319	27331	27333	27333	Anna	229	" Do n't let Gwendolen ride after the hounds , Rex , "
27344	27348	27350	27350	Rex	241	" Why not ? "
27356	27378	27205	27205	she	229	" Papa and mamma and aunt Davilow all wish her not to . They think it is not right for her . "
27379	27394	27423	27423	Rex	241	" Why should you suppose she is going to do what is not right ? "
27395	27401	27403	27403	Anna	229	" Gwendolen minds nobody sometimes , "
27413	27421	27423	27423	Rex	241	" Then she would not mind me , "
27435	27452	27423	27423	Rex	241	" Oh Rex , I can not bear it . You will make yourself very unhappy . "
27459	27473	27475	27475	Rex	241	" Nannie , Nannie , what on earth is the matter with you ? "
27494	27509	27511	27513	the poor child	1437	" She will not care for you one bit I know she never will ! "
28224	28244	28246	28246	Rex	241	" Anna had got it into her head that you would want to ride after the hounds this morning , "
28268	28272	28274	28274	Gwendolen	289	" Did she ? "
28278	28286	28274	28274	Gwendolen	289	" What a little clairvoyant she is ! "
28287	28291	28293	28293	Rex	241	" Shall you ? "
28318	28368	28274	28274	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't know . I ca n't tell what I shall do till I get there . Clairvoyants are often wrong : they foresee what is likely . I am not fond of what is likely : it is always dull . I do what is unlikely . "
28369	28431	28274	28274	Gwendolen	289	" Ah , there you tell me a secret . When once I knew what people in general would be likely to do , I should know you would do the opposite . So you would have come round to a likelihood of your own sort . I shall be able to calculate on you . You could n't surprise me . "
28432	28452	28454	28454	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , I could . I should turn round and do what was likely for people in general , "
28461	28489	28274	28274	Gwendolen	289	" You see you ca n't escape some sort of likelihood . And contradictoriness makes the strongest likelihood of all . You must give up a plan . "
28490	28506	28274	28274	Gwendolen	289	" No , I shall not . My plan is to do what pleases me . "
28595	28606	28608	28608	he	241	" Can you manage to feel only what pleases you ? "
28610	28652	28576	28576	her	289	" Of course not ; that comes from what other people do . But if the world were pleasanter , one would only feel what was pleasant . Girls ' lives are so stupid : they never do what they like . "
28653	28712	28576	28576	her	289	" I thought that was more the case of the men . They are forced to do hard things , and are often dreadfully bored , and knocked to pieces too . And then , if we love a girl very dearly we want to do as she likes , so after all you have your own way . "
28713	28732	28576	28576	her	289	" I do n't believe it . I never saw a married woman who had her own way . "
28733	28741	28743	28743	Rex	241	" What should you like to do ? "
28753	28787	28789	28789	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , I do n't know ! go to the North Pole , or ride steeple - chases , or go to be a queen in the East like Lady Hester Stanhope , "
28817	28828	28802	28802	she	289	" You do n't mean you would never be married ? "
28829	28852	28802	28802	she	289	" No ; I did n't say that . Only when I married , I should not do as other women do . "
28853	28878	28880	28880	Rex	241	" You might do just as you liked if you married a man who loved you more dearly than anything else in the world , "
28903	28910	28880	28880	Rex	241	" I know one who does . "
28911	28924	28926	28926	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't talk of Mr. Middleton , for heaven 's sake , "
28940	28957	28926	28926	Gwendolen	289	" that is Anna 's chant . I hear the hounds . Let us go on . "
29482	29495	29497	29498	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" Glad to see you here this fine morning , Miss Harleth , "
29529	29567	29500	29527	a middle - aged peer of aristocratic seediness in stained pink , with easy - going manners which would have made the threatened deluge seem of no consequence	1481	" We shall have a first - rate run . A pity you did n't go with us . Have you ever tried your little chestnut at a ditch ? you would n't be afraid , eh ? "
29568	29576	29578	29578	Gwendolen	289	" Not the least in the world , "
29594	29609	29585	29585	she	289	" I have often taken him at some rails and a ditch too , near "
29610	29616	29638	29638	he	247	" Ah , by Jove ! "
30173	30246	30261	30261	his	241	" Lord , sir , let me shove it in again for you ! I 's seen Nash , the bone - setter , do it , and done it myself for our little Sally twice over . It 's all one and the same , shoulders is . If you 'll trusten to me and tighten your mind up a bit , I 'll do it for you in no time . "
30247	30254	30256	30256	Rex	241	" Come then , old fellow , "
30302	30390	30299	30299	Joel	310	" Ah , sir , you are n't used to it , that 's how it is . I 's see lots and lots o ' joints out . I see a man with his eye pushed out once that was a rum go as ever I see . You ca n't have a bit o ' fun wi'out such sort o ' things . But it went in again . I 's swallowed three teeth mysen , as sure as I 'm alive . Now , sirrey "
30397	30409	30395	30395	Primrose	309	" come alonk you musn't make believe as you ca n't . "
30634	30640	30641	30641	he	310	" What is the matter ? "
30651	30668	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I 'm very sorry , sir ; Primrose has fallen down and broken his knees . "
30669	30677	30679	30680	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Where have you been with him ? "
30695	30707	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" To the Three Barns to see the hounds throw off . "
30708	30717	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" And you were fool enough to follow ? "
30718	30741	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Yes , sir . I did n't go at any fences , but the horse got his leg into a hole . "
30742	30754	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" And you got hurt yourself , I hope , eh ! "
30755	30785	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I got my shoulder put out , but a young blacksmith put it in again for me . I 'm just a little battered , that 's all . "
30786	30792	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Well , sit down . "
30793	30814	30612	30613	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I 'm very sorry about the horse , sir ; I knew it would be a vexation to you . "
30815	30823	30825	30826	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" And what has become of Gwendolen ? "
30868	30907	30864	30864	he	241	" I am anxious to know I should like to go or send at once to Offendene but she rides so well , and I think she would keep up there would most likely be many round her . "
30908	30921	30923	30924	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I suppose it was she who led you on , eh ? "
30946	30985	30934	30934	his	7898	" It was natural for her to want to go : she did n't intend it beforehand she was led away by the spirit of the thing . And , of course , I went when she went . "
31003	31096	30986	30987	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" But now you observe , young gentleman , that you are not furnished with a horse which will enable you to play the squire to your cousin . You must give up that amusement . You have spoiled my nag for me , and that is enough mischief for one vacation . I shall beg you to get ready to start for Southampton to - morrow and join Stilfox , till you go up to Oxford with him . That will be good for your bruises as well as your studies . "
31118	31132	31149	31149	Rex	241	" I hope you will not insist on my going immediately , sir . "
31133	31140	31149	31149	Rex	241	" Do you feel too ill ? "
31141	31147	31149	31149	Rex	241	" No , not that but "
31174	31189	31165	31165	he	241	" I want to go to Offendene , but I can go this evening . "
31190	31211	31212	31212	Rex	241	" I am going there myself . I can bring word about Gwendolen , if that is what you want . "
31248	31271	31232	31232	He	241	" Father , I ca n't go away without telling her that I love her , and knowing that she loves me . "
31326	31437	31313	31313	He	241	" My dear boy , you are too young to be taking momentous , decisive steps of that sort . This is a fancy which you have got into your head during an idle week or two : you must set to work at something and dismiss it . There is every reason against it . An engagement at your age would be totally rash and unjustifiable ; and moreover , alliances between first cousins are undesirable . Make up your mind to a brief disappointment . Life is full of them . We have all got to be broken in ; and this is a mild beginning for you . "
31438	31476	31478	31478	Rex	241	" No , not mild . I ca n't bear it . I shall be good for nothing . I should n't mind anything , if it were settled between us . I could do anything then , "
31482	31524	31478	31478	Rex	241	" But it 's of no use to pretend that I will obey you . I ca n't do it . If I said I would , I should be sure to break my word . I should see Gwendolen again . "
31525	31549	31551	31552	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Well , wait till to - morrow morning , that we may talk of the matter again you will promise me that , "
31756	31790	31746	31747	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Still , I do hope you will not do it again , Gwendolen . I should never have a moment 's quiet . Her father died by an accident , you know . "
31806	31811	31813	31813	Gwendolen	289	" Mamma , dear , "
31836	31848	31828	31829	Mrs. Davilow	330	" children do n't take after their parents in broken legs . "
31878	31895	31871	31871	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , he must have been left far behind , and gone home in despair , "
31933	31947	31922	31923	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Well , the exploit has ended better for you than for Rex . "
31948	31974	31976	31976	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , I dare say he had to make a terrible round . You have not taught Primrose to take the fences , uncle , "
31990	31997	31999	32000	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Rex has had a fall , "
32034	32048	32030	32030	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , poor fellow ! he is not hurt , I hope ? "
32087	32093	32076	32077	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Good heavens ! There ! "
32099	32114	32094	32095	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" He put his shoulder out , and got some bruises , I believe . "
32152	32165	32143	32143	her	289	" Oh , poor fellow ! it is nothing serious , then ? "
32191	32270	32175	32175	he	1523	" He got his arm set again rather oddly . Some blacksmith not a parishioner of mine was on the field a loose fish , I suppose , but handy , and set the arm for him immediately . So after all , I believe , I and Primrose come off worst . The horse 's knees are cut to pieces . He came down in a hole , it seems , and pitched Rex over his head . "
32329	32344	32357	32357	he	1106	" You are a pretty young lady to laugh at other people 's calamities , "
32376	32426	32357	32357	he	1106	" Pray forgive me , uncle . Now Rex is safe , it is so droll to fancy the figure he and Primrose would cut in a lane all by themselves only a blacksmith running up . It would make a capital caricature of ' Following the Hounds . ' "
32508	32519	32521	32522	Mrs. Davilow	330	" How can you laugh at broken bones , child ? "
32530	32551	32552	32552	she	330	" I wish we had never allowed you to have the horse . You will see that we were wrong , "
32563	32577	32552	32552	she	330	" at least I was , to encourage her in asking for it . "
32578	32585	32587	32588	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Yes , seriously , Gwendolen , "
32606	32754	32587	32588	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I strongly recommend you I shall ask you to oblige me so far not to repeat your adventure of to - day . Lord Brackenshaw is very kind , but I feel sure that he would concur with me in what I say . To be spoken of as ' the young lady who hunts ' by way of exception , would give a tone to the language about you which I am sure you would not like . Depend upon it , his lordship would not choose that Lady Beatrice or Lady Maria should hunt in this part of the country , if they were old enough to do so . When you are married , it will be different : you may do whatever your husband sanctions . But if you intend to hunt , you must marry a man who can keep horses . "
32755	32777	32779	32779	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't know why I should do anything so horrible as to marry without that prospect , at least , "
32823	32833	32835	32836	Mrs. Davilow	330	" She always speaks in that way about marriage , "
32838	32852	32835	32836	Mrs. Davilow	330	" but it will be different when she has seen the right person . "
32853	32869	32871	32872	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Her heart has never been in the least touched , that you know of ? "
32881	32923	32877	32877	her	330	" It was only last night she said to me , ' Mamma , I wonder how girls manage to fall in love . It is easy to make them do it in books . But men are too ridiculous . ' "
32946	32954	32944	32944	he	1535	" How are your bruises , Rex ? "
32955	32972	32944	32944	he	1535	" Oh , not very mellow yet , sir ; only beginning to turn a little . "
32973	32986	32944	32944	he	1535	" You do n't feel quite ready for a journey to Southampton ? "
32987	32991	32993	32993	Rex	241	" Not quite , "
33003	33024	32944	32944	he	1535	" Well , you can wait till to - morrow , and go to say goodbye to them at Offendene . "
33106	33120	33126	33126	she	230	" I can only be thankful that she does n't care about him , "
33134	33216	33126	33126	she	230	" There are things in Gwendolen I can not reconcile myself to . My Anna is worth two of her , with all her beauty and talent . It looks very ill in her that she will not help in the schools with Anna not even in the Sunday - school . What you or I advise is of no consequence to her : and poor Fannie is completely under her thumb . But I know you think better of her , "
33225	33317	33318	33319	Presently Rex	241	" Oh , my dear , there is no harm in the girl . It is only that she has a high spirit , and it will not do to hold the reins too tight . The point is , to get her well married . She has a little too much fire in her for her present life with her mother and sisters . It is natural and right that she should be married soon not to a poor man , but one who can give her a fitting position . "
33533	33538	33529	33529	he	241	" Where is Gwendolen ? "
33558	33573	33574	33574	Rex	241	" I sent up her breakfast this morning . She needed a long rest . "
33589	33605	33574	33574	Rex	241	" Aunt , I want to speak to Gwendolen I want to see her alone . "
33606	33625	33627	33628	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Very well , dear ; go into the drawing - room . I will send her there , "
34142	34164	34136	34136	she	289	" I hope you are not much hurt , Rex ; I deserve that you should reproach me for your accident . "
34165	34170	34172	34172	Rex	241	" Not at all , "
34187	34228	34172	34172	Rex	241	" There is hardly any thing the matter with me . I am so glad you had the pleasure : I would willingly pay for it by a tumble , only I was sorry to break the horse 's knees . "
34261	34277	34279	34279	Rex	241	" My father wants me to go to Southampton for the rest of the vacation , "
34287	34303	34305	34305	Gwendolen	289	" Southampton ! That 's a stupid place to go to , is n't it ? "
34309	34323	34305	34305	Gwendolen	289	" It would be to me , because you would not be there . "
34326	34337	34281	34281	his	241	" Should you mind about me going away , Gwendolen ? "
34338	34352	34354	34354	Gwendolen	289	" Of course . Every one is of consequence in this dreary country , "
34385	34406	34408	34408	Rex	241	" Are you angry with me , Gwendolen ? Why do you treat me in this way all at once ? "
34438	34467	34430	34430	Gwendolen	289	" Treat you ? Nonsense ! I am only rather cross . Why did you come so very early ? You must expect to find tempers in dishabille . "
34468	34485	34487	34487	Rex	241	" Be as cross with me as you like only do n't treat me with indifference , "
34491	34513	34487	34487	Rex	241	" All the happiness of my life depends on your loving me if only a little better than any one else . "
34540	34553	34554	34554	she	289	" Pray do n't make love to me ! I hate it ! "
34671	34683	34664	34664	she	289	" Oh I am tired of them all in the books . "
34745	34765	34740	34740	he	241	" Is that last word you have to say to me , Gwendolen ? Will it always be so ? "
34800	34817	34798	34798	she	289	" About making love ? Yes . But I do n't dislike you for anything else . "
34829	34834	34825	34825	he	241	" good - bye . "
34907	34918	34920	34921	the mother	1566	" My child , my child , what is it ? "
35008	35027	34997	34997	her	289	" Oh , mamma , what can become of my life ? there is nothing worth living for ! "
35028	35033	35039	35039	she	330	" Why , dear ? "
35053	35070	34997	34997	her	289	" I shall never love anybody . I ca n't love people . I hate them . "
35071	35084	35039	35039	she	330	" The time will come , dear , the time will come . "
35113	35128	35109	35109	she	289	" I ca n't bear any one to be very near me but you . "
35171	35176	35163	35163	Joy	320	" To - morrow . "
35187	35192	35163	35163	Joy	320	" To - morrow . "
35308	35313	35314	35314	His	241	" Let me alone . "
35376	35384	35366	35366	his	7898	" God bless you , my boy . "
35468	35486	35502	35503	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" Perhaps it is wicked of me , but I think I never can love her again , "
35523	35612	35512	35512	she	230	" I know of course it is better , and we ought to be thankful that she is not in love with the poor boy ; but really . Henry , I think she is hard ; she has the heart of a coquette . I can not help thinking that she must have made him believe something , or the disappointment would not have taken hold of him in that way . And some blame attaches to poor Fanny ; she is quite blind about that girl . "
35618	35680	35613	35614	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" The less said on that point the better , Nancy . I ought to have been more awake myself . As to the boy , be thankful if nothing worse ever happens to him . Let the thing die out as quickly as possible ; and especially with regard to Gwendolen let it be as if it had never been . "
35813	35816	35817	35817	he	241	" Nannie ! "
35853	35860	35844	35844	she	1581	" What a plague I am ! "
36135	36141	36143	36143	he	241	" Do speak to me . "
36146	36171	36172	36172	Rex	241	" I 'll tell you what I 'm thinking of , Nannie . I will go to Canada , or somewhere of that sort . "
36183	36192	36143	36143	he	241	" Oh , Rex , not for always ! "
36193	36229	36172	36172	Rex	241	" Yes , to get my bread there . I should like to build a hut , and work hard at clearing , and have everything wild about me , and a great wide quiet . "
36230	36238	36240	36240	Anna	229	" And not take me with you ? "
36248	36253	36172	36172	Rex	241	" How could I ? "
36254	36345	36172	36172	Rex	241	" I should like it better than anything ; and settlers go with their families . I would sooner go there than stay here in England . I could make the fires , and mend the clothes , and cook the food ; and I could learn how to make the bread before we went . It would be nicer than anything like playing at life over again , as we used to do when we made our tent with the drugget , and had our little plates and dishes . "
36346	36356	36172	36172	Rex	241	" Father and mother would not let you go . "
36357	36387	36172	36172	Rex	241	" Yes , I think they would , when I explained everything . It would save money ; and papa would have more to bring up the boys with . "
36463	36469	36471	36472	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Well , my children ! "
36490	36502	36504	36504	Anna	229	" May we sit down with you a little , papa ? "
36506	36513	36504	36504	Anna	229	" Rex has something to say . "
36514	36520	36504	36504	Anna	229	" With all my heart . "
36714	36726	36727	36727	Rex	241	" You know all about what has upset me , father , "
36735	36795	36731	36732	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I am quite done up for life in this part of the world . I am sure it will be no use my going back to Oxford . I could n't do any reading . I should fail , and cause you expense for nothing . I want to have your consent to take another course , sir . "
36816	36841	36842	36842	Rex	241	" If you would allow me a small outfit , I should like to go to the colonies and work on the land there . "
36851	36854	36806	36806	his	241	" the colonies "
36876	36885	36887	36887	Anna	229	" Oh , and with me , papa , "
36901	36980	36887	36887	Anna	229	" Rex would want some one to take care of him , you know some one to keep house . And we shall never , either of us , be married . And I should cost nothing , and I should be so happy . I know it would be hard to leave you and mamma ; but there are all the others to bring up , and we two should be no trouble to you any more . "
37036	37069	37009	37009	he	1619	" You will admit that my experience gives me some power of judging for you , and that I can probably guide you in practical matters better than you can guide yourself ? "
37076	37081	37070	37070	Rex	241	" Yes , sir . "
37082	37110	37009	37009	he	1619	" And perhaps you will admit though I do n't wish to press that point that you are bound in duty to consider my judgment and wishes ? "
37111	37125	37070	37070	Rex	241	" I have never yet placed myself in opposition to you , sir . "
37158	37237	37009	37009	he	1619	" But you will do so if you persist in setting your mind toward a rash and foolish procedure , and deafening yourself to considerations which my experience of life assures me of . You think , I suppose , that you have had a shock which has changed all your inclinations , stupefied your brains , unfitted you for anything but manual labor , and given you a dislike to society ? Is that what you believe ? "
37238	37335	37009	37009	he	1619	" Something like that . I shall never be up to the sort of work I must do to live in this part of the world . I have not the spirit for it . I shall never be the same again . And without any disrespect to you , father , I think a young fellow should be allowed to choose his way of life , if he does nobody any harm . There are plenty to stay at home , and those who like might be allowed to go where there are empty places . "
37336	37495	37009	37009	he	1619	" But suppose I am convinced on good evidence as I am that this state of mind of yours is transient , and that if you went off as you propose , you would by - and - by repent , and feel that you had let yourself slip back from the point you have been gaining by your education till now ? Have you not strength of mind enough to see that you had better act on my assurance for a time , and test it ? In my opinion , so far from agreeing with you that you should be free to turn yourself into a colonist and work in your shirt - sleeves with spade and hatchet in my opinion you have no right whatever to expatriate yourself until you have honestly endeavored to turn to account the education you have received here . I say nothing of the grief to your mother and me . "
37496	37516	37518	37518	Rex	241	" I 'm very sorry ; but what can I do ? I ca n't study that 's certain , "
37520	37620	37009	37009	he	1619	" Not just now , perhaps . You will have to miss a term . I have made arrangements for you how you are to spend the next two months . But I confess I am disappointed in you , Rex . I thought you had more sense than to take up such ideas to suppose that because you have fallen into a very common trouble , such as most men have to go through , you are loosened from all bonds of duty just as if your brain had softened and you were no longer a responsible being . "
37670	37673	37642	37643	his father	7898	" the colonies "
37742	37751	37753	37754	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" You assent to my arrangement , then ? "
37780	37796	37777	37777	Rex	241	" I 'll try what I can do , sir . I ca n't promise . "
37825	37830	37831	37831	she	229	" Oh , papa , "
37846	37860	37831	37831	she	229	" it is very hard for him . Does n't he look ill ? "
37861	37902	37838	37838	her	229	" Yes , but he will soon be better ; it will all blow over . And now , Anna , be as quiet as a mouse about it all . Never let it be mentioned when he is gone . "
37903	37933	37831	37831	she	229	" No , papa . But I would not be like Gwendolen for any thing to have people fall in love with me so . It is very dreadful . "
37976	38005	37962	37962	she	229	" I should have done with going out , and gloves , and crinoline , and having to talk when I am taken to dinner and all that ! "
39311	39327	39303	39303	She	230	" It would be a mercy , Fanny , if that girl were well married ! "
39360	39371	39355	39355	she	230	" You will not get her to marry for your pleasure "
39394	39445	39390	39391	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" I hear Mr. Grandcourt has got two places of his own , but he comes to Diplow for the hunting . It is to be hoped he will set a good example in the neighborhood . Have you heard what sort of a young man he is , Henry ? "
39760	39764	39728	39728	she	330	" what may be "
39906	39926	39899	39900	the mother	1566	" It would not signify about her being in love , if she would only accept the right person . "
39994	40002	39978	39979	Madame Roland	327	" Tu seras heureuse , ma chere . "
40003	40011	39978	39979	Madame Roland	327	" Oui , maman , comme toi . "
40220	40248	40200	40200	Gwendolen	289	" How I pity all the other girls at the Archery Meeting all thinking of Mr. Grandcourt ! And they have not a shadow of a chance . "
40272	40299	40262	40262	Gwendolen	289	" Now you know they have not , mamma . You and my uncle and aunt you all intend him to fall in love with me . "
40311	40333	40300	40301	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh , my , dear , that is not so certain . Miss Arrowpoint has charms which you have not . "
40334	40483	40300	40301	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I know , but they demand thought . My arrow will pierce him before he has time for thought . He will declare himself my slave I shall send him round the world to bring me back the wedding ring of a happy woman in the meantime all the men who are between him and the title will die of different diseases he will come back Lord Grandcourt but without the ring and fall at my feet . I shall laugh at him he will rise in resentment I shall laugh more he will call for his steed and ride to Quetcham , where he will find Miss Arrowpoint just married to a needy musician , Mrs. Arrowpoint tearing her cap off , and Mr. Arrowpoint standing by . Exit Lord Grandcourt , who returns to Diplow , and , like M. Jabot , change de linge . "
40598	40615	40623	40624	the witch	1742	" Why , what kind of a man do you imagine him to be , Gwendolen ? "
40616	40621	40623	40624	the witch	1742	" Let me see ! "
40647	40795	40623	40624	the witch	1742	" Short just above my shoulder crying to make himself tall by turning up his mustache and keeping his beard long a glass in his right eye to give him an air of distinction a strong opinion about his waistcoat , but uncertain and trimming about the weather , on which he will try to draw me out . He will stare at me all the while , and the glass in his eye will cause him to make horrible faces , especially when he smiles in a flattering way . I shall cast down my eyes in consequence , and he will perceive that I am not indifferent to his attentions . I shall dream that night that I am looking at the extraordinary face of a magnified insect and the next morning he will make an offer of his hand ; the sequel as before . "
40796	40824	40623	40624	the witch	1742	" That is a portrait of some one you have seen already , Gwen . Mr. Grandcourt may be a delightful young man for what you know . "
40825	40830	40832	40832	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , yes , "
40856	40912	40844	40844	her	289	" I wonder what sort of behavior a delightful young man would have ? I know he would have hunters and racers , and a London house and two country - houses one with battlements and another with a veranda . And I feel sure that with a little murdering he might get a title . "
40960	41011	40953	40953	she	330	" Do n't talk in that way , child , for heaven 's sake ! you do read such books they give you such ideas of everything . I declare when your aunt and I were your age we knew nothing about wickedness . I think it was better so . "
41012	41026	41028	41028	Gwendolen	289	" Why did you not bring me up in that way , mamma ? "
41061	41077	41048	41048	she	289	" Mamma , mamma ! I was only speaking in fun . I meant nothing . "
41078	41085	41087	41089	poor Mrs. Davilow	330	" How could I , Gwendolen ? "
41108	41124	41101	41101	she	330	" Your will was always too strong for me if everything else had been different . "
41135	41150	41152	41152	Gwendolen	289	" Dear mamma , I do n't find fault with you I love you , "
41157	41177	41152	41152	Gwendolen	289	" How can you help what I am ? Besides , I am very charming . Come , now . "
41191	41221	41152	41152	Gwendolen	289	" Really I am contented with myself . I like myself better than I should have liked my aunt and you . How dreadfully dull you must have been ! "
41642	41665	41640	41640	she	289	" Mamma , I see now why girls are glad to be married to escape being expected to please everybody but themselves . "
42599	42604	42611	42620	the young maidens , having a different principle of discrimination	1816	" anything you like , "
42866	42869	42832	42832	They	1825	" killing something "
43181	43192	43194	43195	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" That girl is like a high - mettled racer , "
43206	43214	43194	43195	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" First chop ! tremendously pretty too , "
43228	43236	43194	43195	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" I never saw her look better . "
43967	43977	43979	43980	young Clintock	279	" What extreme guys those artistic fellows usually are ? "
43984	44013	43979	43980	young Clintock	279	" Do look at the figure he cuts , bowing with his hand on his heart to Lady Brackenshaw and Mrs. Arrowpoint 's feather just reaching his shoulder . "
44014	44022	44024	44024	Gwendolen	289	" You are one of the profane , "
44026	44057	44024	44024	Gwendolen	289	" You are blind to the majesty of genius . Herr Klesmer smites me with awe ; I feel crushed in his presence ; my courage all oozes from me . "
44058	44068	43979	43980	young Clintock	279	" Ah , you understand all about his music . "
44069	44074	44076	44076	Gwendolen	289	" No , indeed , "
44083	44097	44076	44076	Gwendolen	289	" it is he who understands all about mine and thinks it pitiable . "
44120	44145	43979	43980	young Clintock	279	" It is not addressed to the ears of the future , I suppose . I 'm glad of that : it suits mine . "
44146	44179	44076	44076	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , you are very kind . But how remarkably well Miss Arrowpoint looks to - day ! She would make quite a fine picture in that gold - colored dress . "
44180	44189	43979	43980	young Clintock	279	" Too splendid , do n't you think ? "
44190	44209	44076	44076	Gwendolen	289	" Well , perhaps a little too symbolical too much like the figure of Wealth in an allegory . "
44347	44357	44359	44360	Lady Brackenshaw	251	" How does the scoring stand , I wonder ? "
44399	44415	44384	44385	Her lord	1873	" It seems to me that Miss Harleth is likely to win the gold arrow . "
44416	44456	44458	44459	his lordship	1482	" Gad , I think she will , if she carries it on ! she is running Juliet Fenn hard . It is wonderful for one in her first year . Catherine is not up to her usual mark , "
44471	44505	44458	44459	his lordship	1482	" But she got the gold arrow last time . And there 's a luck even in these games of skill . That 's better . It gives the hinder ones a chance . "
44506	44517	44523	44523	she	1877	" Catherine will be very glad for others to win , "
44625	44625	44620	44620	one	884	"
44626	44633	44635	44636	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" Ay , to be sure , "
44648	44748	44635	44636	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" For my part , I am not magnanimous ; I should like to win . But , confound it ! I never have the chance now . I 'm getting old and idle . The young ones beat me . As old Nestor says the gods do n't give us everything at one time : I was a young fellow once , and now I am getting an old and wise one . Old , at any rate ; which is a gift that comes to everybody if they live long enough , so it raises no jealousy . "
44757	44779	44781	44782	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Oh , my lord , people who have been neighbors twenty years must not talk to each other about age , "
44784	44819	44781	44782	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Years , as the Tuscans say , are made for the letting of houses . But where is our new neighbor ? I thought Mr. Grandcourt was to be here to - day . "
44820	44838	44845	44845	his	1482	" Ah , by the way , so he was . The time 's getting on too , "
44848	44887	44845	44845	his	1482	" But he only got to Diplow the other day . He came to us on Tuesday and said he had been a little bothered . He may have been pulled in another direction . Why , Gascoigne ! "
44911	44938	44845	44845	his	1482	" this is a little too bad ; you not only beat us yourself , but you bring up your niece to beat all the archeresses . "
44939	44954	44964	44964	his	1395	" It is rather scandalous in her to get the better of elder members , "
44969	44995	44964	44964	his	1395	" But it is not my doing , my lord . I only meant her to make a tolerable figure , without surpassing any one . "
44996	45005	45007	45007	Gwendolen	289	" It is not my fault , either , "
45013	45026	45007	45007	Gwendolen	289	" If I am to aim , I ca n't help hitting . "
45027	45042	45054	45054	his	247	" Ay , ay , that may be a fatal business for some people , "
45062	45152	45059	45060	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" The time 's getting on , as you say . But Grandcourt is always late . I notice in town he 's always late , and he 's no bowman understands nothing about it . But I told him he must come ; he would see the flower of the neighborhood here . He asked about you had seen Arrowpoint 's card . I think you had not made his acquaintance in town . He has been a good deal abroad . People do n't know him much . "
45153	45160	45162	45163	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" No ; we are strangers , "
45165	45191	45162	45163	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" But that is not what might have been expected . For his uncle Sir Hugo Mallinger and I are great friends when we meet . "
45192	45214	45216	45217	his lordship	1482	" I do n't know ; uncles and nephews are not so likely to be seen together as uncles and nieces , "
45224	45250	45216	45217	his lordship	1482	" But just come with me one instant , Gascoigne , will you ? I want to speak a word about the clout - shooting . "
46100	46142	46091	46092	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" Miss Harleth , here is a gentleman who is not willing to wait any longer for an introduction . He has been getting Mrs. Davilow to send me with him . Will you allow me to introduce Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt ? "
46575	46581	46624	46624	she	289	" He is not ridiculous . "
46658	46669	46673	46673	He	325	" I used to think archery was a great bore , "
46700	46708	46710	46710	Gwendolen	289	" Are you converted to - day ? "
46733	46755	46716	46716	she	289	" Yes , since I saw you shooting . In things of this sort one generally sees people missing and simpering . "
46756	46770	46716	46716	she	289	" I suppose you are a first - rate shot with a rifle . "
46797	46804	46716	46716	she	289	" I have left off shooting . "
46805	46857	46716	46716	she	289	" Oh then you are a formidable person . People who have done things once and left them off make one feel very contemptible , as if one were using cast - off fashions . I hope you have not left off all follies , because I practice a great many . "
46871	46878	46716	46716	she	289	" What do you call follies ? "
46879	46906	46716	46716	she	289	" Well , in general I think , whatever is agreeable is called a folly . But you have not left off hunting , I hear . "
46937	46943	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" One must do something . "
46944	46964	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" And do you care about the turf ? or is that among the things you have left off ? "
47002	47031	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" I run a horse now and then ; but I do n't go in for the thing as some men do . Are you fond of horses ? "
47032	47069	47073	47073	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , indeed : I never like my life so well as when I am on horseback , having a great gallop . I think of nothing . I only feel myself strong and happy . "
47096	47102	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" Do you like danger ? "
47103	47147	47073	47073	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't know . When I am on horseback I never think of danger . It seems to me that if I broke my bones I should not feel it . I should go at anything that came in my way . "
47168	47203	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" You would perhaps like tiger - hunting or pig - sticking . I saw some of that for a season or two in the East . Everything here is poor stuff after that . "
47204	47213	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" You are fond of danger , then ? "
47250	47265	46969	46969	Gwendolen	289	" One must have something or other . But one gets used to it . "
47266	47319	47348	47348	she	289	" I begin to think I am very fortunate , because everything is new to me : it is only that I ca n't get enough of it . I am not used to anything except being dull , which I should like to leave off as you have left off shooting . "
47377	47383	47357	47357	she	289	" Why are you dull ? "
47384	47408	47413	47413	Gwendolen	289	" This is a dreadful neighborhood . There is nothing to be done in it . That is why I practiced my archery . "
47447	47465	47357	47357	she	289	" You have made yourself queen of it . I imagine you will carry the first prize . "
47466	47488	47357	47357	she	289	" I do n't know that . I have great rivals . Did you not observe how well Miss Arrowpoint shot ? "
47522	47532	47357	47357	she	289	" Miss Arrowpoint . No that is , yes . "
47533	47573	47574	47574	Gwendolen	289	" Shall we go now and hear what the scoring says ? Every one is going to the other end now shall we join them ? I think my uncle is looking toward me . He perhaps wants me . "
47705	47716	47718	47719	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" You have just missed the gold arrow , Gwendolen , "
47721	47730	47718	47719	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Miss Juliet Fenn scores eight above you . "
47731	47757	47759	47759	Gwendolen	289	" I am very glad to hear it . I should have felt that I was making myself too disagreeable taking the best of everything , "
47839	47843	47835	47837	the new English	1941	" intending bridegrooms , "
48106	48116	48128	48128	her	289	" I wonder which style Miss Arrowpoint admires most , "
48205	48216	48217	48217	she	289	" Shall we meet again in the ball - room ? "
48228	48230	48217	48217	she	289	" yes "
48242	48250	48252	48253	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You were wrong for once Gwendolen , "
48265	48271	48217	48217	she	289	" In what , mamma ? "
48272	48290	48217	48217	she	289	" About Mr. Grandcourt 's appearance and manners . You ca n't find anything ridiculous in him . "
48291	48309	48311	48311	Gwendolen	289	" I suppose I could if I tried , but I do n't want to do it , "
48447	48451	48454	48454	he	247	" The fact is "
48620	48641	48643	48643	Gwendolen	289	" She knows , as I do , that our friends are ready to quarrel over a husband for us , "
48645	48657	48643	48643	Gwendolen	289	" and she is determined not to enter into the quarrel . "
48658	48671	48677	48677	she	330	" I think Miss Arrowpoint has the best manners I ever saw , "
48704	48712	48714	48714	Gwendolen	289	" I wish I were like her , "
48716	48728	48677	48677	she	330	" Why ? Are you getting discontented with yourself , Gwen ? "
48729	48743	48714	48714	Gwendolen	289	" No ; but I am discontented with things . She seems contented . "
48744	48769	48677	48677	she	330	" I am sure you ought to be satisfied to - day . You must have enjoyed the shooting . I saw you did . "
48770	48788	48790	48790	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , that is over now , and I do n't know what will come next , "
48935	48942	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" The dancing will come next , "
48946	48954	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You are sure to enjoy that . "
48955	48980	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I shall only dance in the quadrille . I told Mr. Clintock so . I shall not waltz or polk with any one . "
48981	48995	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Why in the world do you say that all on a sudden ? "
48996	49008	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I ca n't bear having ugly people so near me . "
49009	49018	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Whom do you mean by ugly people ? "
49019	49024	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh , plenty . "
49025	49036	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Mr. Clintock , for example , is not ugly . "
49044	49054	48944	48945	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Well , I hate woolen cloth touching me . "
49055	49058	49060	49061	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Fancy ! "
49077	49087	49060	49061	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Gwendolen says she will not waltz or polk . "
49088	49099	49101	49102	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" She is rather given to whims , I think , "
49106	49142	49101	49102	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" It would be more becoming in her to behave as other young ladies do on such an occasion as this ; especially when she has had the advantage of first - rate dancing lessons . "
49143	49164	49171	49172	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" Why should I dance if I do n't like it , aunt ? It is not in the catechism . "
49165	49169	49171	49172	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" My dear ! "
49303	49313	49270	49272	a dancing man	1978	" Are you under a vow , Miss Harleth ? "
49314	49324	49270	49272	a dancing man	1978	" Why are you so cruel to us all ? "
49325	49333	49371	49371	he	1106	" You waltzed with me in February . "
49334	49342	49270	49272	a dancing man	1978	" And you who waltz so perfectly ! "
49379	49386	49387	49387	He	1106	" Gwendolen has usually good reasons . "
49758	49774	49736	49748	that wide - glancing personage , who saw everything and nothing by turns	1991	" Mr. Grandcourt is a man of taste . He likes to see you dancing . "
49775	49788	49790	49790	Gwendolen	289	" Perhaps he likes to look at what is against his taste , "
49805	49820	49797	49797	she	289	" He may be so tired of admiring that he likes disgust for variety . "
49821	49831	49833	49833	Klesmer	265	" Those words are not suitable to your lips , "
49857	49868	49797	49797	she	289	" Are you as critical of words as of music ? "
49869	49896	49797	49797	she	289	" Certainly I am . I should require your words to be what your face and form are always among the meanings of a noble music . "
49897	49936	49797	49797	she	289	" That is a compliment as well as a correction . I am obliged for both . But do you know I am bold enough to wish to correct you , and require you to understand a joke ? "
49937	49946	49948	49950	the terrible Klesmer	265	" One may understand jokes without liking them , "
49952	50034	50036	50036	Klesmer	265	" I have had opera books sent me full of jokes ; it was just because I understood them that I did not like them . The comic people are ready to challenge a man because he looks grave . ' You do n't see the witticism , sir ? ' ' No , sir , but I see what you meant . ' Then I am what we call ticketed as a fellow without esprit . But , in fact , "
50054	50064	50036	50036	Klesmer	265	" I am very sensible to wit and humor . "
50065	50074	50076	50076	Gwendolen	289	" I am glad you tell me that , "
50114	50128	50129	50129	she	289	" Pray , who is that standing near the card - room door ? "
50151	50162	50129	50129	she	289	" He is a friend of yours , I think . "
50163	50195	50129	50129	she	289	" No , no ; an amateur I have seen in town ; Lush , a Mr. Lush too fond of Meyerbeer and Scribe too fond of the mechanical - dramatic . "
50196	50223	50224	50224	Klesmer	265	" Thanks . I wanted to know whether you thought his face and form required that his words should be among the meanings of noble music ? "
50288	50302	50303	50303	he	265	" May I ask if you are tired of dancing , Miss Harleth ? "
50314	50320	50282	50282	his	265	" Not in the least . "
50321	50334	50282	50282	his	265	" Will you do me the honor the next or another quadrille ? "
50335	50343	50345	50345	Gwendolen	289	" I should have been very happy , "
50351	50382	50345	50345	Gwendolen	289	" but I am engaged for the next to Mr. Clintock and indeed I perceive that I am doomed for every quadrille ; I have not one to dispose of . "
50437	50446	50447	50447	he	325	" I am unfortunate in being too late , "
50456	50469	50471	50471	Gwendolen	289	" It seemed to me that you did not care for dancing , "
50473	50488	50471	50471	Gwendolen	289	" I thought it might be one of the things you had left off . "
50489	50502	50504	50504	Grandcourt	325	" Yes , but I have not begun to dance with you , "
50519	50532	50513	50513	he	325	" You make dancing a new thing , as you make archery . "
50533	50539	50513	50513	he	325	" Is novelty always agreeable ? "
50540	50547	50513	50513	he	325	" No , no not always . "
50548	50577	50513	50513	he	325	" Then I do n't know whether to feel flattered or not . When you had once danced with me there would be no more novelty in it . "
50578	50590	50513	50513	he	325	" On the contrary , there would probably be much more . "
50591	50601	50513	50513	he	325	" That is deep . I do n't understand . "
50602	50614	50513	50513	he	325	" It is difficult to make Miss Harleth understand her power ? "
50632	50646	50620	50621	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I think she does not generally strike people as slow to understand . "
50647	50650	50652	50652	Gwendolen	289	" Mamma , "
50659	50677	50652	50652	Gwendolen	289	" I am adorably stupid , and want everything explained to me when the meaning is pleasant . "
50678	50691	50693	50693	Grandcourt	325	" If you are stupid , I admit that stupidity is adorable , "
50714	50726	50727	50727	Gwendolen	289	" I begin to think that my cavalier has forgotten me , "
50734	50743	50727	50727	Gwendolen	289	" I see the quadrille is being formed . "
50744	50751	50753	50753	Grandcourt	325	" He deserves to be renounced , "
50755	50763	50765	50765	Gwendolen	289	" I think he is very pardonable , "
50767	50775	50777	50778	Mrs. Davilow	330	" There must have been some misunderstanding , "
50780	50794	50777	50778	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Mr. Clintock was too anxious about the engagement to have forgotten it . "
50804	50859	50797	50798	Lady Brackenshaw	251	" Miss Harleth , Mr. Clintock has charged me to express to you his deep regret that he was obliged to leave without having the pleasure of dancing with you again . An express came from his father , the archdeacon ; something important ; he was to go . He was au dťsespoir . "
50860	50875	50877	50877	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , he was very good to remember the engagement under the circumstances , "
50879	50888	50877	50877	Gwendolen	289	" I am sorry he was called away . "
50902	50913	50915	50915	Grandcourt	325	" Then I can profit by Mr. Clintock 's misfortune ? "
50917	50930	50915	50915	Grandcourt	325	" May I hope that you will let me take his place ? "
50931	50945	50877	50877	Gwendolen	289	" I shall be very happy to dance the next quadrille with you . "
51184	51208	51175	51176	The heiress	1875	" I hope you will vote with us , Miss Harleth , and Mr. Grandcourt too , though he is not an archer . "
51334	51362	51308	51309	Mr. Lush	343	" Diplow would be a good place for the meeting , and more convenient : there 's a fine bit between the oaks toward the north gate . "
51495	51503	51490	51490	she	289	" I should like to continue walking . "
51625	51634	51612	51612	Grandcourt	325	" Do you like this kind of thing ? "
51709	51712	51713	51713	she	289	" Yes , "
51721	51725	51713	51713	she	289	" kind of thing "
51860	51873	51836	51837	her mamma	890	" Gwendolen , dear , let me present Mr. Lush to you . "
51948	51957	51939	51939	she	289	" I want to put on my burnous . "
52008	52014	52005	52005	he	343	" Pray , permit me ? "
52039	52045	52016	52016	she	289	" No , thank you . "
52104	52113	52115	52116	Mr. Grandcourt	325	" You had perhaps better put it on , "
52127	52136	52138	52138	Gwendolen	289	" Thanks ; perhaps it would be wise , "
52523	52562	52563	52563	SHAKESPEARE	347	" O gentlemen , the time of life is short ; To spend that shortness basely were too long , If life did ride upon a dial 's point , Still ending at the arrival of an hour . "
53151	53160	53162	53162	Grandcourt	325	" Turn out that brute , will you ? "
53253	53265	53241	53241	he	343	" Shall you ride or drive to Quetcham to - day ? "
53266	53274	53241	53241	he	343	" I am not going to Quetcham . "
53275	53282	53241	53241	he	343	" You did not go yesterday . "
53295	53305	53241	53241	he	343	" I suppose you sent my card and inquiries . "
53306	53343	53241	53241	he	343	" I went myself at four , and said you were sure to be there shortly . They would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the intention . Especially if you go to - day . "
53355	53365	53352	53352	Grandcourt	325	" What men are invited here with their wives ? "
53374	53400	53366	53366	Lush	343	" The Captain and Mrs. Torrington come next week . Then there are Mr. Hollis and Lady Flora , and the Cushats and the Gogoffs . "
53401	53407	53409	53409	Grandcourt	325	" Rather a ragged lot , "
53415	53460	53409	53409	Grandcourt	325	" Why did you ask the Gogoffs ? When you write invitations in my name , be good enough to give me a list , instead of bringing down a giantess on me without my knowledge . She spoils the look of the room . "
53461	53474	53366	53366	Lush	343	" You invited the Gogoffs yourself when you met them in Paris . "
53475	53497	53409	53409	Grandcourt	325	" What has my meeting them in Paris to do with it ? I told you to give me a list . "
53560	53572	53637	53637	he	343	" Are there any other couples you would like to invite ? "
53573	53601	53637	53637	he	343	" Yes ; think of some decent people , with a daughter or two . And one of your damned musicians . But not a comic fellow . "
53602	53631	53632	53632	Lush	343	" I wonder if Klesmer would consent to come to us when he leaves Quetcham . Nothing but first - class music will go down with Miss Arrowpoint . "
53698	53716	53680	53680	he	325	" What in the name of nonsense have I to do with Miss Arrowpoint and her music ? "
53717	53722	53724	53724	Lush	343	" Well , something , "
53728	53754	53724	53724	Lush	343	" You need not give yourself much trouble , perhaps . But some forms must be gone through before a man can marry a million . "
53755	53769	53680	53680	he	325	" Very likely . But I am not going to marry a million . "
53770	53791	53724	53724	Lush	343	" That 's a pity to fling away an opportunity of this sort , and knock down your own plans . "
53792	53801	53680	53680	he	325	" Your plans , I suppose you mean . "
53802	53827	53724	53724	Lush	343	" You have some debts , you know , and things may turn out inconveniently after all . The heirship is not absolutely certain . "
53838	53907	53957	53957	he	343	" It really is a fine opportunity . The father and mother ask for nothing better , I can see , and the daughter 's looks and manners require no allowances , any more than if she had n't a sixpence . She is not beautiful ; but equal to carrying any rank . And she is not likely to refuse such prospects as you can offer her . "
53908	53912	53680	53680	he	325	" Perhaps not . "
53913	53928	53957	53957	he	343	" The father and mother would let you do anything you like with them . "
53929	53941	53680	53680	he	325	" But I should not like to do anything with them . "
53966	53989	53957	53957	he	343	" Good God , Grandcourt ! after your experience , will you let a whim interfere with your comfortable settlement in life ? "
53990	54004	53957	53957	he	343	" Spare your oratory . I know what I am going to do . "
54005	54008	53957	53957	he	343	" What ? "
54039	54049	53957	53957	he	343	" I am going to marry the other girl . "
54050	54057	53957	53957	he	343	" Have you fallen in love ? "
54065	54073	53957	53957	he	343	" I am going to marry her . "
54074	54085	53957	53957	he	343	" You have made her an offer already , then ? "
54086	54089	53957	53957	he	343	" No . "
54090	54121	53957	53957	he	343	" She is a young lady with a will of her own , I fancy . Extremely well fitted to make a rumpus . She would know what she liked . "
54122	54129	54131	54131	Grandcourt	325	" She does n't like you , "
54140	54144	54146	54146	Lush	343	" Perfectly true , "
54156	54174	54146	54146	Lush	343	" However , if you and she are devoted to each other , that will be enough . "
54252	54258	54232	54232	he	343	" Check , old boy ! "
54782	54791	54779	54780	CHAPTER XIII	356	" Philistia , be thou glad of me ! "
55526	55537	55518	55519	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Is he a man she would be happy with ? "
55550	55570	55576	55576	she	330	" Well , perhaps as happy as she would be with any one else or as most other women are "
55604	55608	55597	55597	her	330	" mean circumstances . "
55816	55826	55800	55800	she	289	" not going to do as other women did . "
55889	55898	55899	55899	he	325	" How do you like Criterion 's paces ? "
55918	55966	55899	55899	he	325	" He is delightful to ride . I should like to have a leap with him , if it would not frighten mamma . There was a good wide channel we passed five minutes ago . I should like to have a gallop back and take it . "
55967	55977	56141	56141	Grandcourt	325	" Pray do . We can take it together . "
55978	55997	55899	55899	he	325	" No , thanks . Mamma is so timid if she saw me it might make her ill . "
55998	56012	56141	56141	Grandcourt	325	" Let me go and explain . Criterion would take it without fail . "
56013	56051	55899	55899	he	325	" No indeed you are very kind but it would alarm her too much . I dare take any leap when she is not by ; but I do it and do n't tell her about it . "
56052	56064	56141	56141	Grandcourt	325	" We can let the carriage pass and then set off . "
56065	56084	56086	56086	Gwendolen	289	" No , no , pray do n't think of it any more : I spoke quite randomly , "
56102	56114	56141	56141	Grandcourt	325	" But Mrs. Davilow knows I shall take care of you . "
56115	56134	56141	56141	Grandcourt	325	" Yes , but she would think of you as having to take care of my broken neck . "
56148	56163	56141	56141	Grandcourt	325	" I should like to have the right always to take care of you . "
56217	56253	56198	56198	she	289	" Oh , I am not sure that I want to be taken care of : if I chose to risk breaking my neck , I should like to be at liberty to do it . "
56336	56340	56342	56342	Grandcourt	325	" Damn her ! "
56926	56938	56906	56906	his	325	" This is a bore . Shall we go up there ? "
56939	56948	56950	56950	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , certainly since we are exploring , "
56994	57010	56992	56992	Grandcourt	325	" There is nothing to be seen here : the thing was not worth climbing . "
57064	57074	57076	57076	Grandcourt	325	" What sort of a place do you prefer ? "
57078	57111	57076	57076	Grandcourt	325	" Different places are agreeable in their way . On the whole , I think , I prefer places that are open and cheerful . I am not fond of anything sombre . "
57112	57121	57020	57020	She	289	" Your place of Offendene is too sombre . "
57122	57128	57076	57076	Grandcourt	325	" It is , rather . "
57129	57140	57020	57020	She	289	" You will not remain there long , I hope . "
57141	57158	57076	57076	Grandcourt	325	" Oh , yes , I think so . Mamma likes to be near her sister . "
57165	57184	57020	57020	She	289	" It is not to be supposed that you will always live there , though Mrs. Davilow may . "
57185	57292	57020	57020	She	289	" I do n't know . We women ca n't go in search of adventures to find out the North - West Passage or the source of the Nile , or to hunt tigers in the East . We must stay where we grow , or where the gardeners like to transplant us . We are brought up like the flowers , to look as pretty as we can , and be dull without complaining . That is my notion about the plants ; they are often bored , and that is the reason why some of them have got poisonous . What do you think ? "
57310	57320	57322	57322	Grandcourt	325	" I quite agree . Most things are bores , "
57356	57364	57348	57348	he	325	" But a woman can be married . "
57365	57370	57351	57351	his	325	" Some women can . "
57371	57382	57348	57348	he	325	" You , certainly , unless you are obstinately cruel . "
57383	57397	57351	57351	his	325	" I am not sure that I am not both cruel and obstinate . "
57485	57499	57483	57483	he	325	" Are you as uncertain about yourself as you make others about you ? "
57500	57518	57483	57483	he	325	" I am quite uncertain about myself ; I do n't know how uncertain others may be . "
57519	57532	57534	57534	Grandcourt	325	" And you wish them to understand that you do n't care ? "
57546	57553	57554	57554	Gwendolen	289	" I did not say that , "
57596	57603	57605	57605	Grandcourt	325	" You do care , then , "
57617	57623	57625	57625	Gwendolen	289	" Ha ! my whip ! "
57780	57786	57788	57788	Grandcourt	325	" It is all coquetting , "
57790	57801	57788	57788	Grandcourt	325	" the next time I beckon she will come down . "
58707	58714	58715	58715	she	289	" Something has happened , dear ? "
58805	58818	58800	58800	she	289	" Mr. Grandcourt has been saying something ? Tell me , dear . "
58826	58836	58800	58800	she	289	" What am I to tell you , mamma ? "
58842	58871	58872	58873	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I am sure something has agitated you . You ought to confide in me , Gwen . You ought not to leave me in doubt and anxiety . "
58880	58891	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" Mamma , dear , please do n't be miserable , "
58899	58913	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" It only makes me more so . I am in doubt myself . "
58914	58921	58923	58924	Mrs. Davilow	330	" About Mr. Grandcourt 's intentions ? "
58932	58939	58941	58941	Gwendolen	289	" No ; not at all , "
58963	58973	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" About whether you will accept him , then ? "
58974	58977	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" Precisely . "
58978	58987	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" Have you given him a doubtful answer ? "
58988	58998	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" I have given him no answer at all . "
58999	59011	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" He has spoken so that you could not misunderstand him ? "
59012	59022	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" As far as I would let him speak . "
59023	59030	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" You expect him to persevere ? "
59047	59058	59031	59032	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You do n't consider that you have discouraged him ? "
59059	59065	58893	58893	Gwendolen	289	" I dare say not . "
59066	59075	59077	59078	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I thought you liked him , dear , "
59082	59111	59112	59112	Gwendolen	289	" So I do , mamma , as liking goes . There is less to dislike about him than about most men . He is quiet and distinguť . "
59142	59173	59140	59140	she	289	" Indeed he has all the qualities that would make a husband tolerable battlement , veranda , stable , etc . , no grins and no glass in his eye . "
59174	59197	59140	59140	she	289	" Do be serious with me for a moment , dear . Am I to understand that you mean to accept him ? "
59198	59210	59212	59212	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , pray , mamma , leave me to myself , "
59829	59832	59827	59827	he	1106	" made much "
59844	59848	59849	59849	he	1106	" My dear , "
59868	59929	59849	59849	he	1106	" I want to speak to you on a subject which is more momentous than any other with regard to your welfare . You will guess what I mean . But I shall speak to you with perfect directness : in such matters I consider myself bound to act as your father . You have no objection , I hope ? "
59930	59947	59949	59949	Gwendolen	289	" Oh dear , no , uncle . You have always been very kind to me , "
60029	60098	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" It is naturally a satisfaction to me that the prospect of a marriage for you advantageous in the highest degree has presented itself so early . I do not know exactly what has passed between you and Mr. Grandcourt , but I presume there can be little doubt , from the way in which he has distinguished you , that he desires to make you his wife . "
60112	60124	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" Have you any doubt of that yourself , my dear ? "
60125	60148	60150	60150	Gwendolen	289	" I suppose that is what he has been thinking of . But he may have changed his mind to - morrow , "
60152	60167	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" Why to - morrow ? Has he made advances which you have discouraged ? "
60168	60190	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" I think he meant he began to make advances but I did not encourage them . I turned the conversation . "
60191	60206	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" Will you confide in me so far as to tell me your reasons ? "
60207	60220	60221	60221	Gwendolen	289	" I am not sure that I had any reasons , uncle . "
60226	60293	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" You are quite capable of reflecting , Gwendolen . You are aware that this is not a trivial occasion , and it concerns your establishment for life under circumstances which may not occur again . You have a duty here both to yourself and your family . I wish to understand whether you have any ground for hesitating as to your acceptance of Mr. Grandcourt . "
60294	60302	60303	60303	Gwendolen	289	" I suppose I hesitate without grounds . "
60314	60322	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" Is he disagreeable to you personally ? "
60323	60326	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" No . "
60327	60340	60106	60107	her uncle	1106	" Have you heard anything of him which has affected you disagreeably ? "
60375	60390	60392	60392	Gwendolen	289	" I have heard nothing about him except that he is a great match , "
60398	60406	60392	60392	Gwendolen	289	" and that affects me very agreeably . "
60407	60602	60603	60603	Gwendolen	289	" Then , my dear Gwendolen , I have nothing further to say than this : you hold your fortune in your own hands a fortune such as rarely happens to a girl in your circumstances a fortune in fact which almost takes the question out of the range of mere personal feeling , and makes your acceptance of it a duty . If Providence offers you power and position especially when unclogged by any conditions that are repugnant to you your course is one of responsibility , into which caprice must not enter . A man does not like to have his attachment trifled with : he may not be at once repelled these things are matters of individual disposition . But the trifling may be carried too far . And I must point out to you that in case Mr. Grandcourt were repelled without your having refused him without your having intended ultimately to refuse him , your situation would be a humiliating and painful one . I , for my part , should regard you with severe disapprobation , as the victim of nothing else than your own coquetry and folly . "
60689	60699	60700	60700	His	1106	" I mean this in kindness , my dear . "
60705	60714	60716	60716	Gwendolen	289	" I am aware of that , uncle , "
60735	60780	60781	60781	She	289	" I am not foolish . I know that I must be married some time before it is too late . And I do n't see how I could do better than marry Mr. Grandcourt . I mean to accept him , if possible . "
60909	60914	60915	60915	he	1395	" My dear Gwendolen , "
60927	61059	60915	60915	he	1395	" I trust that you will find in marriage a new fountain of duty and affection . Marriage is the only true and satisfactory sphere of a woman , and if your marriage with Mr. Grandcourt should be happily decided upon , you will have , probably , an increasing power , both of rank and wealth , which may be used for the benefit of others . These considerations are something higher than romance ! You are fitted by natural gifts for a position which , considering your birth and early prospects , could hardly be looked forward to as in the ordinary course of things ; and I trust that you will grace it , not only by those personal gifts , but by a good and consistent life . "
61060	61069	61071	61071	Gwendolen	289	" I hope mamma will be the happier , "
61445	61469	61436	61436	she	2211	" Did you suppose I should come wandering about here by myself ? Why should I not bring all four if I liked ? "
61470	61475	61477	61477	Lush	343	" Oh , certainly , "
61572	61590	61564	61564	he	343	" I will take , nay , I will lay odds that the marriage will never happen . "
61860	61873	61997	61997	she	289	" You do n't feel inclined to go a thousand miles away ? "
61874	61880	61997	61997	she	289	" Not exactly so far . "
61881	61907	61997	61997	she	289	" It was a sad omission not to have written again before this . Ca n't you write how before we set out this morning ? "
61908	61943	61997	61997	she	289	" It is not so pressing . To - morrow will do . You see they leave town to - day . I must write to Dover . They will be there till Monday . "
61944	61957	61997	61997	she	289	" Shall I write for you , dear if it teases you ? "
61973	61988	61967	61967	her	289	" Oh no , let it be ; I will write to - morrow . "
62006	62014	61997	61997	she	289	" Dear , old , beautiful mamma ! "
62015	62022	61997	61997	she	289	" Old , child , truly . "
62023	62061	61997	61997	she	289	" Please do n't , mamma ! I meant old for darling . You are hardly twenty - five years older than I am . When you talk in that way my life shrivels up before me . "
62062	62080	61997	61997	she	289	" One can have a great deal of happiness in twenty - five years , my dear . "
62081	62090	62092	62092	Gwendolen	289	" I must lose no time in beginning , "
62096	62108	62092	62092	Gwendolen	289	" The sooner I get my palaces and coaches the better . "
62109	62120	62122	62123	Mrs. Davilow	330	" And a good husband who adores you , Gwen , "
62700	62717	62697	62697	Grandcourt	325	" Do you know how long it is since I first saw you in this dress ? "
62718	62733	62735	62735	Gwendolen	289	" The archery meeting was on the 25th , and this is the 13th , "
62739	62761	62735	62735	Gwendolen	289	" I am not good at calculating , but I will venture to say that it must be nearly three weeks . "
62771	62780	62768	62768	he	325	" That is a great loss of time . "
62781	62802	62859	62859	he	325	" That your knowing me has caused you ? Pray do n't be uncomplimentary ; I do n't like it . "
62806	62819	62768	62768	he	325	" It is because of the gain that I feel the loss . "
62831	62843	62827	62827	She	289	" He is really very ingenious . He never speaks stupidly . "
62862	62883	62859	62859	he	325	" The gain of knowing you makes me feel the time I lose in uncertainty . Do you like uncertainty ? "
62884	62892	62894	62894	Gwendolen	289	" I think I do , rather , "
62905	62912	62894	62894	Gwendolen	289	" There is more in it . "
62940	62949	62913	62913	Grandcourt	325	" Do you mean more torment for me ? "
62983	62992	62980	62980	she	289	" No , that would make me sorry . "
63161	63218	63220	63221	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Mr. Grandcourt is not equal as a man to his uncle , Sir Hugo Mallinger too languid . To be sure , Mr. Grandcourt is a much younger man , but I should n't wonder if Sir Hugo were to outlive him , notwithstanding the difference of years . It is ill calculating on successions , "
63227	63232	63234	63235	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It is indeed , "
63822	63829	63817	63817	her	289	" It is come in time . "
63960	63972	63974	63975	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" We shall alight on him by - and - by , "
63977	63985	63974	63975	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" he ca n't be gone far . "
64061	64072	64058	64058	her	289	" Can he too be starting away from a decision ? "
64090	64094	64058	64058	her	289	" Starting away , "
64212	64227	64203	64203	his	325	" You 'll be kind enough to go to the devil , will you ? "
64334	64340	64329	64329	they	2293	" As you like it ; "
64505	64515	64517	64517	Gwendolen	289	" How far are we from Green Arbor now ? "
64530	64567	64517	64517	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , not more than half a mile , taking along the avenue we 're going to cross up there : but I shall take round a Couple of miles , by the High Cross . "
64777	64781	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" Miss Harleth ? "
64786	64789	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" Yes . "
64797	64804	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" Have you accepted Mr. Grandcourt ? "
64805	64808	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" No . "
64809	64849	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" I have promised to tell you something . And you will promise to keep my secret . However you may decide you will not tell Mr. Grandcourt , or any one else , that you have seen me ? "
64850	64854	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" I promise . "
64855	64924	64783	64784	the lady	2303	" My name is Lydia Glasher . Mr. Grandcourt ought not to marry any one but me . I left my husband and child for him nine years ago . Those two children are his , and we have two others girls who are older . My husband is dead now , and Mr. Grandcourt ought to marry me . He ought to make that boy his heir . "
64997	65006	64993	64993	Gwendolen	289	" I will not interfere with your wishes . "
65021	65076	65016	65016	her	289	" You are very attractive , Miss Harleth . But when he first knew me , I too was young . Since then my life has been broken up and embittered . It is not fair that he should be happy and I miserable , and my boy thrust out of sight for another . "
65133	65141	65107	65107	she	289	" I am a woman 's life . "
65142	65152	65153	65153	she	289	" Have you anything more to say to me ? "
65181	65208	65177	65177	Everyone	1390	" Nothing . You know what I wished you to know . You can inquire about me if you like . My husband was Colonel Glasher . "
65209	65215	65217	65217	Gwendolen	289	" Then I will go , "
65368	65436	65366	65366	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , I have been rather silly . I lingered behind to look at the Whispering Stones , and the rest hurried on after something , so I lost sight of them . I thought it best to come home by the short way the avenue that the warden had told me of . I 'm not sorry after all . I had had enough walking . "
65437	65449	65451	65452	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Your party did not meet Mr. Grandcourt , I presume , "
65458	65461	65463	65463	Gwendolen	289	" No , "
65477	65511	65463	65463	Gwendolen	289	" And we did n't see any carvings on the trees , either . Where can he be ? I should think he has fallen into the pool or had an apoplectic fit . "
65575	65590	65592	65592	Gwendolen	289	" If you have no objection , mamma , I will order the carriage , "
65594	65607	65592	65592	Gwendolen	289	" I am tired . And every one will be going soon . "
65648	65655	65657	65658	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" Ah , there you are ! "
65676	65729	65657	65658	Lord Brackenshaw	247	" We thought at first you had alighted on Grandcourt and he had taken you home . Lush said so . But after that we met Grandcourt . However , we did n't suppose you could be in any danger . The warden said he had told you a near way back . "
65730	65735	65737	65737	Grandcourt	325	" You are going ? "
65772	65779	65781	65781	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , we are going , "
65799	65809	65790	65790	she	289	" May I call at Offendene to - morrow ? "
65810	65818	65820	65820	Gwendolen	289	" Oh yes , if you like , "
65880	65896	65897	65897	she	289	" I got in , mamma , because I wished to be on this side , "
65949	65998	65946	65946	Gwendolen	289	" I intend to join the Langens at Dover , mamma . I shall pack up immediately on getting home , and set off by the early train . I shall be at Dover almost as soon as they are ; we can let them know by telegraph . "
65999	66014	65934	65935	The mother	1566	" Good heavens , child ! what can be your reason for saying so ? "
66015	66032	65946	65946	Gwendolen	289	" My reason for saying it , mamma , is that I mean to do it . "
66033	66043	65934	65935	The mother	1566	" But why do you mean to do it ? "
66044	66051	65946	65946	Gwendolen	289	" I wish to go away . "
66052	66072	65934	65935	The mother	1566	" Is it because you are offended with Mr. Grandcourt 's odd behavior in walking off to - day ? "
66073	66103	65946	65946	Gwendolen	289	" It is useless to enter into such questions . I am not going in any case to marry Mr. Grandcourt . Do n't interest yourself further about it . "
66104	66144	65934	65935	The mother	1566	" What can I say to your uncle , Gwendolen ? Consider the position you place me in . You led him to believe only last night that you had made up your mind in favor of Mr. Grandcourt . "
66145	66166	66168	66168	Gwendolen	289	" I am very sorry to cause you annoyance , mamma , dear , but I ca n't help it , "
66178	66243	66168	66168	Gwendolen	289	" Whatever you or my uncle may think or do , I shall not alter my resolve , and I shall not tell my reason . I do n't care what comes of it . I do n't care if I never marry any one . There is nothing worth caring for . I believe all men are bad , and I hate them . "
66244	66256	66258	66259	Mrs. Davilow	330	" But need you set off in this way , Gwendolen , "
66265	66311	66168	66168	Gwendolen	289	" Now mamma , do n't interfere with me . If you have ever had any trouble in your own life , remember it and do n't interfere with me . If I am to be miserable , let it be by my own choice . "
66668	66678	66679	66681	SIR THOMAS BROWNE	288	" Festina lente celerity should be contempered with cunctation . "

68895	68905	68886	68887	Sir Hugo	209	" Did you play much at Baden , Grandcourt ? "
68906	68921	68886	68887	Sir Hugo	209	" No ; I looked on and betted a little with some Russians there . "
68922	68927	68886	68887	Sir Hugo	209	" Had you luck ? "
68928	68936	68886	68887	Sir Hugo	209	" What did I win , Lush ? "
68937	68945	68947	68947	Lush	343	" You brought away about two hundred , "
68949	68963	68965	68966	Sir Hugo	209	" You are not here for the sake of the play , then ? "
68968	68985	68987	68987	Grandcourt	325	" No ; I do n't care about play now . It 's a confounded strain , "
69021	69041	69043	69044	Sir Hugo	209	" The fact is , somebody should invent a mill to do amusements for you , my dear fellow , "
69046	69121	69043	69044	Sir Hugo	209	" as the Tartars get their praying done . But I agree with you ; I never cared for play . It 's monotonous knits the brain up into meshes . And it knocks me up to watch it now . I suppose one gets poisoned with the bad air . I never stay here more than ten minutes . But where 's your gambling beauty , Deronda ? Have you seen her lately ? "
69122	69127	69129	69129	Deronda	289	" She 's gone , "
69133	69143	69145	69146	Sir Hugo	209	" An uncommonly fine girl , a perfect Diana , "
69153	69228	69145	69146	Sir Hugo	209	" Really worth a little straining to look at her . I saw her winning , and she took it as coolly as if she had known it all beforehand . The same day Deronda happened to see her losing like wildfire , and she bore it with immense pluck . I suppose she was cleaned out , or was wise enough to stop in time . How do you know she 's gone ? "
69229	69238	69240	69240	Deronda	289	" Oh , by the Visitor - list , "
69248	69281	69240	69240	Deronda	289	" Vandernoodt told me her name was Harleth , and she was with the Baron and Baroness von Langen . I saw by the list that Miss Harleth was no longer there . "
69383	69392	69379	69379	he	343	" Do you know those people the Langens ? "
69393	69414	69379	69379	he	343	" I have talked with them a little since Miss Harleth went away . I knew nothing of them before . "
69415	69424	69379	69379	he	343	" Where is she gone do you know ? "
69425	69431	69433	69433	Deronda	289	" She is gone home , "
69465	69487	69454	69454	he	343	" But it is possible you know her . Her home is not far from Diplow : Offendene , near Winchester . "
69562	69570	69557	69557	officials	2422	" What did you say , sir ? "
69625	69632	69621	69621	his	325	" Yes , I know her , "
69647	69654	69656	69659	Sir Hugo of Lush	2424	" What of her , eh ? "
69670	69690	69662	69663	the three	2425	" She must be a new - comer at Offendene . Old Blenny lived there after the dowager died . "
69691	69699	69701	69701	Lush	372	" A little too much of her , "
69722	69727	69729	69730	the baronet	7684	" Why ? how ? "
69744	69755	69756	69756	Lush	372	" He has been on the brink of marrying her , "
69760	69884	69756	69756	Lush	372	" But I hope it 's off now . She 's a niece of the clergyman Gascoigne at Pennicote . Her mother is a widow with a brood of daughters . This girl will have nothing , and is as dangerous as gunpowder . It would be a foolish marriage . But she has taken a freak against him , for she ran off here without notice , when he had agreed to call the next day . The fact is , he 's here after her ; but he was in no great hurry , and between his caprice and hers they are likely enough not to get together again . But of course he has lost his chance with the heiress . "
69890	69912	69885	69885	Grandcourt	325	" What a beastly den this is ! a worse hole than Baden . I shall go back to the hotel . "
69924	69970	69921	69922	the baronet	7684	" Rather a pretty story . That girl has something in her . She must be worth running after has de l'imprťvu . I think her appearance on the scene has bettered my chance of getting Diplow , whether the marriage comes off or not . "
69971	69984	69986	69986	Deronda	289	" I should hope a marriage like that would not come off , "
69994	70007	70009	70010	Sir Hugo	209	" What ! are you a little touched with the sublime lash ? "
70027	70036	70009	70010	Sir Hugo	209	" Are you inclined to run after her ? "
70037	70042	70044	70044	Deronda	289	" On the contrary , "
70046	70058	70044	70044	Deronda	289	" I should rather be inclined to run away from her . "
70059	70084	70086	70087	Sir Hugo	209	" Why , you would easily cut out Grandcourt . A girl with her spirit would think you the finer match of the two , "
70117	70129	70131	70131	Deronda	289	" I suppose pedigree and land belong to a fine match , "
70135	70158	70160	70161	Sir Hugo	209	" The best horse will win in spite of pedigree , my boy . You remember Napoleon 's mot Je suis un ancetre "
70186	70199	70201	70201	Deronda	289	" I am not sure that I want to be an ancestor , "
70203	70216	70201	70201	Deronda	289	" It does n't seem to me the rarest sort of origination . "
70217	70229	70231	70232	Sir Hugo	209	" You wo n't run after the pretty gambler , then ? "
70239	70243	70201	70201	Deronda	289	" Decidedly not . "

70583	70601	70566	70566	he	209	" Mr. Fraser , how was it that the popes and cardinals always had so many nephews ? "
70644	70652	70602	70603	The tutor	2445	" Their own children were called nephews . "
70653	70656	70658	70658	Deronda	289	" Why ? "
70660	70690	70602	70603	The tutor	2445	" It was just for the propriety of the thing ; because , as you know very well , priests do n't marry , and the children were illegitimate . "
70781	70805	70776	70777	the baronet	7684	" You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little one ; that is why I take care of you . "

72670	72677	72679	72680	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , well , well ! "

74247	74268	74232	74233	Sir Hugo	209	" What is it , my boy ? Have you heard anything that has put you out of spirits lately ? "
74285	74299	74301	74302	Sir Hugo	209	" All changes are painful when people have been happy , you know , "
74321	74352	74305	74305	his	209	" You ca n't be educated exactly as I wish you to be without our parting . And I think you will find a great deal to like at school . "
74373	74381	74305	74305	his	209	" Am I to go to school ? "
74382	74439	74305	74305	his	209	" Yes , I mean you to go to Eton . I wish you to have the education of an English gentleman ; and for that it is necessary that you should go to a public school in preparation for the university : Cambridge I mean you to go to ; it was my own university . "
74447	74455	74457	74458	Sir Hugo	209	" What do you say , sirrah ? "
74462	74471	74473	74473	Daniel	197	" I should like to be a gentleman , "
74479	74496	74473	74473	Daniel	197	" and go to school , if that is what a gentleman 's son must do . "
74529	74542	74526	74526	he	209	" And so you wo n't mind about leaving your old Nunc ? "
74543	74549	74551	74551	Daniel	197	" Yes , I shall , "
74564	74579	74551	74551	Daniel	197	" But sha n't I come home and be with you in the holidays ? "
74580	74586	74588	74589	Sir Hugo	209	" Oh yes , generally , "
74591	74618	74588	74589	Sir Hugo	209	" But now I mean you to go at once to a new tutor , to break the change for you before you go to Eton . "
74758	74775	74777	74777	Daniel	197	" Do you think I shall know much less than the other boys , Mr. Fraser ? "
74795	74804	74808	74808	Fraser	379	" There are dunces to be found everywhere , "
74810	74835	74808	74808	Fraser	379	" You 'll not be the biggest ; but you 've not the makings of a Porson in you , or a Leibnitz either . "
74836	74849	74851	74851	Daniel	197	" I do n't want to be a Porson or a Leibnitz , "
74853	74867	74851	74851	Daniel	197	" I would rather be a greater leader , like Pericles or Washington . "
74868	74887	74889	74889	Fraser	379	" Ay , ay ; you 've a notion they did with little parsing , and less algebra , "
75945	75956	75940	75940	he	197	" What do you intend me to be , sir ? "
76025	76205	76342	76342	Deronda	197	" Whatever your inclination leads you to , my boy . I thought it right to give you the option of the army , but you shut the door on that , and I was glad . I do n't expect you to choose just yet by - and - by , when you have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among older men . The university has a good wide opening into the forum . There are prizes to be won , and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a man 's taste . From what I see and hear , I should think you can take up anything you like . You are in the deeper water with your classics than I ever got into , and if you are rather sick of that swimming , Cambridge is the place where you can go into mathematics with a will , and disport yourself on the dry sand as much as you like . I floundered along like a carp . "
76206	76217	76219	76219	Daniel	197	" I suppose money will make some difference , sir , "
76222	76235	76219	76219	Daniel	197	" I shall have to keep myself by - and - by . "
76236	76341	76342	76342	Deronda	197	" Not exactly . I recommend you not to be extravagant yes , yes , I know you are not inclined to that ; but you need not take up anything against the grain . You will have a bachelor 's income enough for you to look about with . Perhaps I had better tell you that you may consider yourself secure of seven hundred a year . You might make yourself a barrister be a writer take up politics . I confess that is what would please me best . I should like to have you at my elbow and pulling with me . "
76521	76750	76516	76516	his	209	" I am glad you have done some good reading outside your classics , and have got a grip of French and German . The truth is , unless a man can get the prestige and income of a Don and write donnish books , it 's hardly worth while for him to make a Greek and Latin machine of himself and be able to spin you out pages of the Greek dramatists at any verse you 'll give him as a cue . That 's all very fine , but in practical life nobody does give you the cue for pages of Greek . In fact , it 's a nicety of conversation which I would have you attend to much quotation of any sort , even in English is bad . It tends to choke ordinary remark . One could n't carry on life comfortably without a little blindness to the fact that everything had been said better than we can put it ourselves . But talking of Dons , I have seen Dons make a capital figure in society ; and occasionally he can shoot you down a cart - load of learning in the right place , which will tell in politics . Such men are wanted ; and if you have any turn for being a Don , I say nothing against it . "
76751	76790	76516	76516	his	209	" I think there 's not much chance of that . Quicksett and Puller are both stronger than I am . I hope you will not be much disappointed if I do n't come out with high honors . "
76791	76923	76516	76516	his	209	" No , no . I should like you to do yourself credit , but for God 's sake do n't come out as a superior expensive kind of idiot , like young Brecon , who got a Double First , and has been learning to knit braces ever since . What I wish you to get is a passport in life . I do n't go against our university system : we want a little disinterested culture to make head against cotton and capital , especially in the House . My Greek has all evaporated ; if I had to construe a verse on a sudden , I should get an apoplectic fit . But it formed my taste . I dare say my English is the better for it . "
77131	77146	77152	77152	him	2686	" Deronda would have been first - rate if he had had more ambition , "

79070	79119	79060	79060	Hans	406	" Old fellow , while you are hoisting me you are risking yourself . With your mathematical cram one may be like Moses or Mahomet or somebody of that sort who had to cram , and forgot in one day what it had taken him forty to learn . "
79422	79464	79418	79418	he	197	" If you had got the scholarship , Sir Hugo would have thought that you asked to leave us with a better grace . You have spoiled your luck for my sake , and I can do nothing to amend it . "
79465	79493	79418	79418	he	197	" Yes , you can ; you are to be a first - rate fellow . I call that a first - rate investment of my luck . "
79494	79561	79418	79418	he	197	" Oh , confound it ! You save an ugly mongrel from drowning , and expect him to cut a fine figure . The poets have made tragedies enough about signing one 's self over to wickedness for the sake of getting something plummy ; I shall write a tragedy of a fellow who signed himself over to be good , and was uncomfortable ever after . "
79730	79746	79721	79721	he	209	" So you do n't want to be an Englishman to the backbone after all ? "
79747	79779	79721	79721	he	209	" I want to be an Englishman , but I want to understand other points of view . And I want to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies . "
79780	79931	79721	79721	he	209	" I see ; you do n't want to be turned out in the same mould as every other youngster . And I have nothing to say against your doffing some of our national prejudices . I feel the better myself for having spent a good deal of my time abroad . But , for God 's sake , keep an English cut , and do n't become indifferent to bad tobacco ! And , my dear boy , it is good to be unselfish and generous ; but do n't carry that too far . It will not do to give yourself to be melted down for the benefit of the tallow - trade ; you must know where to find yourself . However , I shall put no vote on your going . Wait until I can get off Committee , and I 'll run over with you . "

84179	84184	84186	84186	Deronda	289	" Why should I ? "
84188	84195	84186	84186	Deronda	289	" I am not so foolish . "

84205	84227	84186	84186	Deronda	289	" So are many Christians . But I should not think it fair for you to despise me because of that . "

I thought I might find my mother again God would guide me . But then I despaired . This morning when the light came , I felt as if one word kept sounding within me Never ! never ! But now I begin to think "

86132	86152	86130	86130	Amy	423	" it is the last you have heard . Everything that pleases you is the best in its turn . "
86153	86163	86165	86165	Kate	422	" It is hardly to be called a story , "
86167	86209	86165	86165	Kate	422	" It is a bit of history brought near us with a strong telescope . We can see the soldiers ' faces : no , it is more than that we can hear everything we can almost hear their hearts beat . "
86210	86220	86222	86222	Mab	424	" I do n't care what you call it , "
86229	86284	86285	86285	She	424	" Call it a chapter in Revelations . It makes me want to do something good , something grand . It makes me so sorry for everybody . It makes me like Schiller I want to take the world in my arms and kiss it . I must kiss you instead , little mother ? "
86295	86310	86312	86312	Amy	423	" Whenever you are in that mood , Mab , down goes your work , "
86314	86329	86312	86312	Amy	423	" It would be doing something good to finish your cushion without soiling it . "
86330	86335	86340	86340	she	424	" Oh oh oh ! "
86350	86363	86340	86340	she	424	" I wish I had three wounded conscripts to take care of . "
86364	86377	86379	86379	Amy	423	" You would spill their beef - tea while you were talking , "
86381	86392	86394	86395	the mother	1566	" Poor Mab ! do n't be hard on her , "
86397	86425	86394	86395	the mother	1566	" Give me the embroidery now , child . You go on with your enthusiasm , and I will go on with the pink and white poppy . "
86426	86440	86442	86442	Kate	422	" Well , ma , I think you are more caustic than Amy , "
86456	86461	86463	86463	Mab	424	" Oh oh oh ! "
86472	86513	86463	86463	Mab	424	" I wish something wonderful would happen . I feel like the deluge . The waters of the great deep are broken up , and the windows of heaven are opened . I must sit down and play the scales . "
86547	86551	86553	86554	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Dear me ! "
86559	86572	86573	86573	She	418	" it is after ten , and Phoebe is gone to bed . "
86583	86587	86573	86573	She	418	" Mr. Deronda ! "
86609	86619	86598	86598	Mab	424	" There now ! something is going to happen . "
86656	86671	86672	86672	Deronda	289	" I know I am trusting to your goodness in a most extraordinary way , "
86682	86744	86672	86672	Deronda	289	" but you can imagine how helpless I feel with a young creature like this on my hands . I could not go with her among strangers , and in her nervous state I should dread taking her into a house full of servants . I have trusted to your mercy . I hope you will not think my act unwarrantable . "
86745	86776	86785	86786	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" On the contrary . You have honored me by trusting me . I see your difficulty . Pray bring her in . I will go and prepare the girls . "
86795	86886	86785	86786	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Here is somebody to take care of instead of your wounded conscripts , Mab : a poor girl who was going to drown herself in despair . Mr. Deronda found her only just in time to save her . He brought her along in his boat , and did not know what else it would be safe to do with her , so he has trusted us and brought her here . It seems she is a Jewess , but quite refined , he says knowing Italian and music . "
86959	86995	86937	86937	Deronda	289	" I have brought you to some of the kindest people in the world : there are daughters like you . It is a happy home . Will you let me take you to them ? "
87128	87137	87124	87125	the mother	1566	" You must be weary , poor child . "
87138	87154	87156	87156	Mab	424	" We will take care of you we will comfort you we will love you , "
87273	87292	87265	87265	her	418	" I am a stranger . I am a Jewess . You might have thought I was wicked . "
87293	87303	87306	87306	Mab	424	" No , we are sure you are good , "
87308	87326	87328	87329	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" We think no evil of you , poor child . You shall be safe with us , "
87331	87352	87328	87329	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Come now and sit down . You must have some food , and then you must go to rest . "
87363	87381	87359	87359	Deronda	289	" You will have no more fears with these friends ? You will rest to - night ? "
87382	87402	87403	87404	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Oh , I should not fear . I should rest . I think these are the ministering angels . "
87438	87540	87403	87404	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" My name is Mirah Lapidoth . I am come a long way , all the way from Prague by myself . I made my escape . I ran away from dreadful things . I came to find my mother and brother in London . I had been taken from my mother when I was little , but I thought I could find her again . I had trouble the houses were all gone I could not find her . It has been a long while , and I had not much money . That is why I am in distress . "
87541	87550	87552	87552	Mab	424	" Our mother will be good to you , "
87554	87564	87552	87552	Mab	424	" See what a nice little mother she is ! "
87565	87571	87573	87573	Kate	422	" Do sit down now , "
87654	87671	87672	87672	he	426	" Will you allow me to come again and inquire perhaps at five to - morrow ? "
87678	87693	87672	87672	he	426	" Yes , pray ; we shall have had time to make acquaintance then . "
87694	87699	87701	87701	Deronda	289	" Good - bye , "
87754	87810	87742	87742	She	289	" The God of our fathers bless you and deliver you from all evil as you have delivered me . I did not believe there was any man so good . None before have thought me worthy of the best . You found me poor and miserable , yet you have given me the best . "
87835	87879	87880	87880	STERNE	431	" I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba , and say , ' Tis all barren ' : and so it is : and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers . "
89321	89387	89318	89319	CHAPTER XX	435	" It will hardly be denied that even in this frail and corrupted world , we sometimes meet persons who , in their very mien and aspect , as well as in the whole habit of life , manifest such a signature and stamp of virtue , as to make our judgment of them a matter of intuition rather than the result of continued examination . "
89547	89556	89558	89558	Mab	424	" Oh , if you please , mamma ? "
89576	89627	89571	89571	she	424	" look at the slippers , how beautiful they fit ! I declare she is like the Queen Budoor ' two delicate feet , the work of the protecting and all - recompensing Creator , support her ; and I wonder how they can sustain what is above them . ' "
89651	89673	89674	89674	She	418	" One could hardly imagine this creature having an evil thought . But wise people would tell me to be cautious . "
89682	89711	89674	89674	She	418	" I fear the feet have had to sustain their burden a little too often lately . But to - day she will rest and be my companion . "
89712	89728	89730	89730	Mab	424	" And she will tell you so many things and I shall not hear them , "
90063	90091	90057	90057	she	289	" I remember my mother 's face better than anything ; yet I was not seven when I was taken away , and I am nineteen now . "
90092	90098	90100	90101	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I can understand that , "
90103	90114	90100	90101	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" There are some earliest things that last the longest . "
90115	90346	90057	90057	she	289	" Oh , yes , it was the earliest . I think my life began with waking up and loving my mother 's face : it was so near to me , and her arms were round me , and she sang to me . One hymn she sang so often , so often : and then she taught me to sing it with her : it was the first I ever sang . They were always Hebrew hymns she sang ; and because I never knew the meaning of the words they seemed full of nothing but our love and happiness . When I lay in my little bed and it was all white above me , she used to bend over me , between me and the white , and sing in a sweet , low voice . I can dream myself back into that time when I am awake , and it often comes back to me in my sleep my hand is very little , I put it up to her face and she kisses it . Sometimes in my dreams I begin to tremble and think that we are both dead ; but then I wake up and my hand lies like this , and for a moment I hardly know myself . But if I could see my mother again I should know her . "
90347	90357	90359	90360	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You must expect some change after twelve years , "
90364	90416	90359	90360	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" See my grey hair : ten years ago it was bright brown . The days and months pace over us like restless little birds , and leave the marks of their feet backward and forward ; especially when they are like birds with heavy hearts - then they tread heavily . "
90417	90639	90057	90057	she	289	" Ah , I am sure her heart has been heavy for want of me . But to feel her joy if we could meet again , and I could make her know I love her and give her deep comfort after all her mourning ! If that could be , I should mind nothing ; I should be glad that I have lived through my trouble . I did despair . The world seemed miserable and wicked ; none helped me so that I could bear their looks and words ; I felt that my mother was dead , and death was the only way to her . But then in the last moment yesterday , when I longed for the water to close over me and I thought that death was the best image of mercy then goodness came to me living , and I felt trust in the living . And it is strange but I began to hope that she was living too . And now I with you here this morning , peace and hope have come into me like a flood . I want nothing ; I can wait ; because I hope and believe and am grateful oh , so grateful ! You have not thought evil of me you have not despised me . "
90659	90672	90674	90675	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Many others would have felt as we do , my dear , "
90691	90705	90359	90360	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" But I did not meet them they did not come to me . "
90706	90718	90359	90360	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" How was it that you were taken from your mother ? "
90719	91109	90359	90360	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Ah , I am a long while coming to that . It is dreadful to speak of , yet I must tell you I must tell you everything . My father it was he that took me away . I thought we were only going on a little journey ; and I was pleased . There was a box with all my little things in . But we went on board a ship , and got farther and farther away from the land . Then I was ill ; and I thought it would never end it was the first misery , and it seemed endless . But at last we landed . I knew nothing then , and believed what my father said . He comforted me , and told me I should go back to my mother . But it was America we had reached , and it was long years before we came back to Europe . At first I often asked my father when we were going back ; and I tried to learn writing fast , because I wanted to write to my mother ; but one day when he found me trying to write a letter , he took me on his knee and told me that my mother and brother were dead ; that was why we did not go back . I remember my brother a little ; he carried me once ; but he was not always at home . I believed my father when he said that they were dead . I saw them under the earth when he said they were there , with their eyes forever closed . I never thought of its not being true ; and I used to cry every night in my bed for a long while . Then when she came so often to me , in my sleep , I thought she must be living about me though I could not always see her , and that comforted me . I was never afraid in the dark , because of that ; and very often in the day I used to shut my eyes and bury my face and try to see her and to hear her singing . I came to do that at last without shutting my eyes . "
91137	91150	91152	91153	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Still your father was not unkind to you , I hope , "
91164	91987	92010	92010	She	418	" No ; he petted me , and took pains to teach me . He was an actor ; and I found out , after , that the ' Coburg ' I used to hear of his going to at home was a theatre . But he had more to do with the theatre than acting . He had not always been an actor ; he had been a teacher , and knew many languages . His acting was not very good ; I think , but he managed the stage , and wrote and translated plays . An Italian lady , a singer , lived with us a long time . They both taught me , and I had a master besides , who made me learn by heart and recite . I worked quite hard , though I was so little ; and I was not nine when I first went on the stage . I could easily learn things , and I was not afraid . But then and ever since I hated our way of life . My father had money , and we had finery about us in a disorderly way ; always there were men and women coming and going ; there was loud laughing and disputing , strutting , snapping of fingers , jeering , faces I did not like to look at though many petted and caressed me . But then I remembered my mother . Even at first when I understood nothing , I shrank away from all those things outside me into companionship with thoughts that were not like them ; and I gathered thoughts very fast , because I read many things plays and poetry , Shakespeare and Schiller , and learned evil and good . My father began to believe that I might be a great singer : my voice was considered wonderful for a child ; and he had the best teaching for me . But it was painful that he boasted of me , and set me to sing for show at any minute , as if I had been a musical box . Once when I was nine years old , I played the part of a little girl who had been forsaken and did not know it , and sat singing to herself while she played with flowers . I did it without any trouble ; but the clapping and all the sounds of the theatre were hateful to me ; and I never liked the praise I had , because it all seemed very hard and unloving : I missed the love and trust I had been born into . I made a life in my own thoughts quite different from everything about me : I chose what seemed to me beautiful out of the plays and everything , and made my world out of it ; and it was like a sharp knife always grazing me that we had two sorts of life which jarred so with each other women looking good and gentle on the stage , and saying good things as if they felt them , and directly after I saw them with coarse , ugly manners . My father sometimes noticed my shrinking ways ; and Signora said one day , when I had been rehearsing , ' She will never be an artist : she has no notion of being anybody but herself . That does very well now , but by - and - by you will see she will have no more face and action than a singing - bird . ' My father was angry , and they quarreled . I sat alone and cried , because what she had said was like a long unhappy future unrolled before me . I did not want to be an artist ; but this was what my father expected of me . After a while Signora left us , and a governess used to come and give me lessons in different things , because my father began to be afraid of my singing too much ; but I still acted from time to time . Rebellious feelings grew stronger in me , and I wished to get away from this life ; but I could not tell where to go , and I dreaded the world . Besides , I felt it would be wrong to leave my father : I dreaded doing wrong , for I thought I might get wicked and hateful to myself , in the same way that many others seemed hateful to me . For so long , so long I had never felt my outside world happy ; and if I got wicked I should lose my world of happy thoughts where my mother lived with me . That was my childish notion all through those years . Oh how long they were ! "
91994	92005	92007	92008	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Had you no teaching about what was your duty ? "
92016	92018	92020	92020	herself	418	" religion "
92039	92950	92010	92010	She	418	" No only that I ought to do what my father wished . He did not follow our religion at New York , and I think he wanted me not to know much about it . But because my mother used to take me to the synagogue , and I remembered sitting on her knee and looking through the railing and hearing the chanting and singing , I longed to go . One day when I was quite small I slipped out and tried to find the synagogue , but I lost myself a long while till a peddler questioned me and took me home . My father , missing me , had been much in fear , and was very angry . I too had been so frightened at losing myself that it was long before I thought of venturing out again . But after Signora left us we went to rooms where our landlady was a Jewess and observed her religion . I asked her to take me with her to the synagogue ; and I read in her prayer - books and Bible , and when I had money enough I asked her to buy me books of my own , for these books seemed a closer companionship with my mother : I knew that she must have looked at the very words and said them . In that way I have come to know a little of our religion , and the history of our people , besides piecing together what I read in plays and other books about Jews and Jewesses ; because I was sure my mother obeyed her religion . I had left off asking my father about her . It is very dreadful to say it , but I began to disbelieve him . I had found that he did not always tell the truth , and made promises without meaning to keep them ; and that raised my suspicion that my mother and brother were still alive though he had told me they were dead . For in going over the past again as I got older and knew more , I felt sure that my mother had been deceived , and had expected to see us back again after a very little while ; and my father taking me on his knee and telling me that my mother and brother were both dead seemed to me now but a bit of acting , to set my mind at rest . The cruelty of that falsehood sank into me , and I hated all untruth because of it . I wrote to my mother secretly : I knew the street , Colman Street , where we lived , and that it was not Blackfriars Bridge and the Coburg , and that our name was Cohen then , though my father called us Lapidoth , because , he said , it was a name of his forefathers in Poland . I sent my letter secretly ; but no answer came , and I thought there was no hope for me . Our life in America did not last much longer . My father suddenly told me we were to pack up and go to Hamburg , and I was rather glad . I hoped we might get among a different sort of people , and I knew German quite well some German plays almost all by heart . My father spoke it better than he spoke English . I was thirteen then , and I seemed to myself quite old I knew so much , and yet so little . I think other children can not feel as I did . I had often wished that I had been drowned when I was going away from my mother . But I set myself to obey and suffer : what else could I do ? One day when we were on our voyage , a new thought came into my mind . I was not very ill that time , and I kept on deck a good deal . My father acted and sang and joked to amuse people on board , and I used often to hear remarks about him . One day , when I was looking at the sea and nobody took notice of me , I overheard a gentleman say , ' Oh , he is one of those clever Jews a rascal , I should n't wonder . There 's no race like them for cunning in the men and beauty in the women . I wonder what market he means that daughter for . ' When I heard this it darted into my mind that the unhappiness in my life came from my being a Jewess , and that always to the end the world would think slightly of me and that I must bear it , for I should be judged by that name ; and it comforted me to believe that my suffering was part of the affliction of my people , my part in the long song of mourning that has been going on through ages and ages . For if many of our race were wicked and made merry in their wickedness what was that but part of the affliction borne by the just among them , who were despised for the sins of their brethren ? But you have not rejected me . "
92978	92997	92999	93000	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" And we will try to save you from being judged unjustly by others , my poor child , "
93035	93046	92999	93000	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Go on , go on : tell me all . "
93047	93404	93422	93422	my	0	" After that we lived in different towns Hamburg and Vienna , the longest . I began to study singing again : and my father always got money about the theatres . I think he brought a good deal of money from America , I never knew why we left . For some time he was in great spirits about my singing , and he made me rehearse parts and act continually . He looked forward to my coming out in the opera . But by - and - by it seemed that my voice would never be strong enough it did not fulfill its promise . My master at Vienna said , ' Do n't strain it further : it will never do for the public : it is gold , but a thread of gold dust . ' My father was bitterly disappointed : we were not so well off at that time . I think I have not quite told you what I felt about my father . I knew he was fond of me and meant to indulge me , and that made me afraid of hurting him ; but he always mistook what would please me and give me happiness . It was his nature to take everything lightly ; and I soon left off asking him any questions about things that I cared for much , because he always turned them off with a joke . He would even ridicule our own people ; and once when he had been imitating their movements and their tones in praying , only to make others laugh , I could not restrain myself for I always had an anger in my heart about my mother and when we were alone , I said , ' Father , you ought not to mimic our own people before Christians who mock them : would it not be bad if I mimicked you , that they might mock you ? ' But he only shrugged his shoulders and laughed and pinched my chin , and said , ' You could n't do it , my dear . "
93772	94062	93752	93752	I	0	" But soon there came the dreadful time . We had been at Pesth and we came back to Vienna . In spite of what my master Leo had said , my father got me an engagement , not at the opera , but to take singing parts at a suburb theatre in Vienna . He had nothing to do with the theatre then ; I did not understand what he did , but I think he was continually at a gambling house , though he was careful always about taking me to the theatre . I was very miserable . The plays I acted in were detestable to me . Men came about us and wanted to talk to me : women and men seemed to look at me with a sneering smile ; it was no better than a fiery furnace . Perhaps I make it worse than it was you do n't know that life : but the glare and the faces , and my having to go on and act and sing what I hated , and then see people who came to stare at me behind the scenes it was all so much worse than when I was a little girl . I went through with it ; I did it ; I had set my mind to obey my father and work , for I saw nothing better that I could do . But I felt that my voice was getting weaker , and I knew that my acting was not good except when it was not really acting , but the part was one that I could be myself in , and some feeling within me carried me along . That was seldom .
94063	97167	97177	97177	her	418	" Then , in the midst of all this , the news came to me one morning that my father had been taken to prison , and he had sent for me . He did not tell me the reason why he was there , but he ordered me to go to an address he gave me , to see a Count who would be able to get him released . The address was to some public rooms where I was to ask for the Count , and beg him to come to my father . I found him , and recognized him as a gentleman whom I had seen the other night for the first time behind the scenes . That agitated me , for I remembered his way of looking at me and kissing my hand I thought it was in mockery . But I delivered my errand , and he promised to go immediately to my father , who came home again that very evening , bringing the Count with him . I now began to feel a horrible dread of this man , for he worried me with his attentions , his eyes were always on me : I felt sure that whatever else there might be in his mind toward me , below it all there was scorn for the Jewess and the actress . And when he came to me the next day in the theatre and would put my shawl around me , a terror took hold of me ; I saw that my father wanted me to look pleased . The Count was neither very young nor very old ; his hair and eyes were pale ; he was tall and walked heavily , and his face was heavy and grave except when he looked at me . He smiled at me , and his smile went through me with horror : I could not tell why he was so much worse to me than other men . Some feelings are like our hearing : they come as sounds do , before we know their reason . My father talked to me about him when we were alone , and praised him said what a good friend he had been . I said nothing , because I supposed he had got my father out of prison . When the Count came again , my father left the room . He asked me if I liked being on the stage . I said No , I only acted in obedience to my father . He always spoke French , and called me ' petite ange ' and such things , which I felt insulting . I knew he meant to make love to me , and I had it firmly in my mind that a nobleman and one who was not a Jew could have no love for me that was not half contempt . But then he told me that I need not act any longer ; he wished me to visit him at his beautiful place , where I might be queen of everything . It was difficult to me to speak , I felt so shaken with anger : I could only say , ' I would rather stay on the stage forever , ' and I left him there . Hurrying out of the room I saw my father sauntering in the passage . My heart was crushed . I went past him and locked myself up . It had sunk into me that my father was in a conspiracy with that man against me . But the next day he persuaded me to come out : he said that I had mistaken everything , and he would explain : if I did not come out and act and fulfill my engagement , we should be ruined and he must starve . So I went on acting , and for a week or more the Count never came near me . My father changed our lodgings , and kept at home except when he went to the theatre with me . He began one day to speak discouragingly of my acting , and say , I could never go on singing in public I should lose my voice I ought to think of my future , and not put my nonsensical feelings between me and my fortune . He said , ' What will you do ? You will be brought down to sing and beg at people 's doors . You have had a splendid offer and ought to accept it . ' I could not speak : a horror took possession of me when I thought of my mother and of him . I felt for the first time that I should not do wrong to leave him . But the next day he told me that he had put an end to my engagement at the theatre , and that we were to go to Prague . I was getting suspicious of everything , and my will was hardening to act against him . It took us two days to pack and get ready ; and I had it in my mind that I might be obliged to run away from my father , and then I would come to London and try if it were possible to find my mother . I had a little money , and I sold some things to get more . I packed a few clothes in a little bag that I could carry with me , and I kept my mind on the watch . My father 's silence his letting drop that subject of the Count 's offer made me feel sure that there was a plan against me . I felt as if it had been a plan to take me to a madhouse . I once saw a picture of a madhouse , that I could never forget ; it seemed to me very much like some of the life I had seen the people strutting , quarreling , leering the faces with cunning and malice in them . It was my will to keep myself from wickedness ; and I prayed for help . I had seen what despised women were : and my heart turned against my father , for I saw always behind him that man who made me shudder . You will think I had not enough reason for my suspicions , and perhaps I had not , outside my own feeling ; but it seemed to me that my mind had been lit up , and all that might be stood out clear and sharp . If I slept , it was only to see the same sort of things , and I could hardly sleep at all . Through our journey I was everywhere on the watch . I do n't know why , but it came before me like a real event , that my father would suddenly leave me and I should find myself with the Count where I could not get away from him . I thought God was warning me : my mother 's voice was in my soul . It was dark when we reached Prague , and though the strange bunches of lamps were lit it was difficult to distinguish faces as we drove along the street . My father chose to sit outside he was always smoking now and I watched everything in spite of the darkness . I do believe I could see better then than I ever did before : the strange clearness within seemed to have got outside me . It was not my habit to notice faces and figures much in the street ; but this night I saw every one ; and when we passed before a great hotel I caught sight only of a back that was passing in the light of the great bunch of lamps a good way off fell on it . I knew it before the face was turned , as it fell into shadow , I knew who it was . Help came to me . I feel sure help came . I did not sleep that night . I put on my plainest things the cloak and hat I have worn ever since ; and I sat watching for the light and the sound of the doors being unbarred . Some one rose early at four o'clock , to go to the railway . That gave me courage . I slipped out , with my little bag under my cloak , and none noticed me . I had been a long while attending to the railway guide that I might learn the way to England ; and before the sun had risen I was in the train for Dresden . Then I cried for joy . I did not know whether my money would last out , but I trusted . I could sell the things in my bag , and the little rings in my ears , and I could live on bread only . My only terror was lest my father should follow me . But I never paused . I came on , and on , and on , only eating bread now and then . When I got to Brussels I saw that I should not have enough money , and I sold all that I could sell ; but here a strange thing happened . Putting my hand into the pocket of my cloak , I found a half - napoleon . Wondering and wondering how it came there , I remembered that on the way from Cologne there was a young workman sitting against me . I was frightened at every one , and did not like to be spoken to . At first he tried to talk , but when he saw that I did not like it , he left off . It was a long journey ; I ate nothing but a bit of bread , and he once offered me some of the food he brought in , but I refused it . I do believe it was he who put that bit of gold in my pocket . Without it I could hardly have got to Dover , and I did walk a good deal of the way from Dover to London . I knew I should look like a miserable beggar - girl . I wanted not to look very miserable , because if I found my mother it would grieve her to see me so . But oh , how vain my hope was that she would be there to see me come ! As soon as I set foot in London , I began to ask for Lambeth and Blackfriars Bridge , but they were a long way off , and I went wrong . At last I got to Blackfriars Bridge and asked for Colman Street . People shook their heads . None knew it . I saw it in my mind our doorsteps , and the white tiles hung in the windows , and the large brick building opposite with wide doors . But there was nothing like it . At last when I asked a tradesman where the Coburg Theatre and Colman Street were , he said , ' Oh , my little woman , that 's all done away with . The old streets have been pulled down ; everything is new . ' I turned away and felt as if death had laid a hand on me . He said : ' Stop , stop ! young woman ; what is it you 're wanting with Colman Street , eh ? ' meaning well , perhaps . But his tone was what I could not bear ; and how could I tell him what I wanted ? I felt blinded and bewildered with a sudden shock . I suddenly felt that I was very weak and weary , and yet where could I go ? for I looked so poor and dusty , and had nothing with me I looked like a street - beggar . And I was afraid of all places where I could enter . I lost my trust . I thought I was forsaken . It seemed that I had been in a fever of hope delirious all the way from Prague : I thought that I was helped , and I did nothing but strain my mind forward and think of finding my mother ; and now there I stood in a strange world . All who saw me would think ill of me , and I must herd with beggars . I stood on the bridge and looked along the river . People were going on to a steamboat . Many of them seemed poor , and I felt as if it would be a refuge to get away from the streets ; perhaps the boat would take me where I could soon get into a solitude . I had still some pence left , and I bought a loaf when I went on the boat . I wanted to have a little time and strength to think of life and death . How could I live ? And now again it seemed that if ever I were to find my mother again , death was the way to her . I ate , that I might have strength to think . The boat set me down at a place along the river I do n't know where and it was late in the evening . I found some large trees apart from the road , and I sat down under them that I might rest through the night . Sleep must have soon come to me , and when I awoke it was morning . The birds were singing , and the dew was white about me , I felt chill and oh , so lonely ! I got up and walked and followed the river a long way and then turned back again . There was no reason why I should go anywhere . The world about me seemed like a vision that was hurrying by while I stood still with my pain . My thoughts were stronger than I was ; they rushed in and forced me to see all my life from the beginning ; ever since I was carried away from my mother I had felt myself a lost child taken up and used by strangers , who did not care what my life was to me , but only what I could do for them . It seemed all a weary wandering and heart - loneliness as if I had been forced to go to merrymakings without the expectation of joy . And now it was worse . I was lost again , and I dreaded lest any stranger should notice me and speak to me . I had a terror of the world . None knew me ; all would mistake me . I had seen so many in my life who made themselves glad with scorning , and laughed at another 's shame . What could I do ? This life seemed to be closing in upon me with a wall of fire everywhere there was scorching that made me shrink . The high sunlight made me shrink . And I began to think that my despair was the voice of God telling me to die . But it would take me long to die of hunger . Then I thought of my people , how they had been driven from land to land and been afflicted , and multitudes had died of misery in their wandering was I the first ? And in the wars and troubles when Christians were cruelest , our fathers had sometimes slain their children and afterward themselves : it was to save them from being false apostates . That seemed to make it right for me to put an end to my life ; for calamity had closed me in too , and I saw no pathway but to evil . But my mind got into war with itself , for there were contrary things in it . I knew that some had held it wrong to hasten their own death , though they were in the midst of flames ; and while I had some strength left it was a longing to bear if I ought to bear else where was the good of all my life ? It had not been happy since the first years : when the light came every morning I used to think , ' I will bear it . ' But always before I had some hope ; now it was gone . With these thoughts I wandered and wandered , inwardly crying to the Most High , from whom I should not flee in death more than in life though I had no strong faith that He cared for me . The strength seemed departing from my soul ; deep below all my cries was the feeling that I was alone and forsaken . The more I thought the wearier I got , till it seemed I was not thinking at all , but only the sky and the river and the Eternal God were in my soul . And what was it whether I died or lived ? If I lay down to die in the river , was it more than lying down to sleep ? for there too I committed my soul I gave myself up . I could not bear memories any more ; I could only feel what was present in me it was all one longing to cease from my weary life , which seemed only a pain outside the great peace that I might enter into . That was how it was . When the evening came and the sun was gone , it seemed as if that was all I had to wait for . And a new strength came into me to will what I would do . You know what I did . I was going to die . You know what happened did he not tell you ? Faith came to me again ; I was not forsaken . He told you how he found me ? "
97184	97198	97177	97177	her	418	" She 's just a pearl ; the mud has only washed her , "
97235	97247	97249	97249	Deronda	289	" What is your feeling about a search for this mother ? "
97251	97263	97249	97249	Deronda	289	" Have you no fears ? I have , I confess . "
97264	97274	97276	97277	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Oh , I believe the mother 's good , "
97283	97333	97276	97277	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" or was good . She may be dead that 's my fear . A good woman , you may depend : you may know it by the scoundrel the father is . Where did the child get her goodness from ? Wheaten flour has to be accounted for . "
97556	97572	97574	97575	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" We should be very jealous of any one who took the task from us , "
97577	97594	97574	97575	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" She will stay under my roof ; there is Hans 's old room for her . "
97595	97603	97605	97605	Deronda	289	" Will she be content to wait ? "
97609	97711	97574	97575	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" No trouble there . It is not her nature to run into planning and devising : only to submit . See how she submitted to that father ! It was a wonder to herself how she found the will and contrivance to run away from him . About finding her mother , her only notion now is to trust ; since you were sent to save her and we are good to her , she trusts that her mother will be found in the same unsought way . And when she is talking I catch her feeling like a child . "
97769	97779	97781	97782	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Oh , yes ; we will hurry nothing , "
97784	97857	97781	97782	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Rely upon it , she shall be taken tender care of . If you like to give me your address abroad , I will write to let you know how we get on . It is not fair that we should have all the pleasure of her salvation to ourselves . And besides , I want to make believe that I am doing something for you as well as for Mirah . "
97858	97901	97920	97921	the others	7737	" That is no make - believe . What should I have done without you last night ? Everything would have gone wrong . I shall tell Hans that the best of having him for a friend is , knowing his mother . "
97947	97958	97960	97960	Mab	424	" Kate burns a pastille before his portrait every day , "
97962	98014	97960	97960	Mab	424	" And I carry his signature in a little black - silk bag round my neck to keep off the cramp . And Amy says the multiplication - table in his name . We must all do something extra in honor of him , now he has brought you to us . "
98015	98028	98030	98030	Mirah	289	" I suppose he is too great a person to want anything , "
98043	98053	98030	98030	Mirah	289	" He is perhaps very high in the world ? "
98054	98064	98066	98066	Amy	423	" He is very much above us in rank , "
98068	98093	98066	98066	Amy	423	" He is related to grand people . I dare say he leans on some of the satin cushions we prick our fingers over . "
98094	98104	98106	98106	Mirah	289	" I am glad he is of high rank , "
98113	98123	98125	98125	Amy	423	" Now , why are you glad of that ? "
98145	98157	98066	98066	Amy	423	" Because I have always disliked men of high rank before . "
98158	98169	98171	98171	Kate	422	" Oh , Mr. Deronda is not so very high , "
98173	98192	98171	98171	Kate	422	" He need not hinder us from thinking ill of the whole peerage and baronetage if we like . "
98729	98735	98715	98715	she	371	" I will ask Daniel . "
98947	98953	98930	98930	Ignorance	448	" Let there not be , "
100185	100192	100207	100209	Good Miss Merry	228	" Now go away , girls , "
100275	100282	100284	100284	Gwendolen	289	" Never mind , mamma dear , "
100302	100346	100284	100284	Gwendolen	289	" Never mind . I do n't mind . I will do something . I will be something . Things will come right . It seemed worse because I was away . Come now ! you must be glad because I am here . "
100401	100432	100390	100390	she	289	" It was one of her best moments , and the fond mother , forgetting everything below that tide mark , looked at her with a sort of adoration . She said
100433	100452	100390	100390	she	289	" Bless you , my good , good darling ! I can be happy , if you can ! "
100582	100603	100578	100578	she	289	" Keep them all away from us to - day , mamma . Let you and me be alone together . "
100663	100675	100648	100648	She	289	" What have you thought of doing , exactly , mamma ? "
100676	100748	100648	100648	She	289	" Oh , my dear , the next thing to be done is to move away from this house . Mr. Haynes most fortunately is as glad to have it now as he would have been when we took it . Lord Brackenshaw 's agent is to arrange everything with him to the best advantage for us : Bazley , you know ; not at all an ill - natured man . "
100749	100769	100771	100771	Gwendolen	289	" I can not help thinking that Lord Brackenshaw would let you stay here rent - free , mamma , "
100794	100862	100648	100648	She	289	" My dear child , Lord Brackenshaw is in Scotland , and knows nothing about us . Neither your uncle nor I would choose to apply to him . Besides , what could we do in this house without servants , and without money to warm it ? The sooner we are out the better . We have nothing to carry but our clothes , you know ? "
100863	100874	100876	100876	Gwendolen	289	" I suppose you mean to go abroad , then ? "
100891	100915	100917	100918	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh , no , dear , no . How could we travel ? You never did learn anything about income and expenses , "
100937	100950	100932	100932	she	330	" that makes it so much harder for you , my pet . "
100951	100959	100961	100961	Gwendolen	289	" But where are we to go ? "
100983	101006	101007	101008	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It is all decided . A little furniture is to be got in from the rectory all that can be spared . "
101039	101051	101070	101070	she	330	" It is Sawyer 's Cottage we are to go to . "
101074	101105	101070	101070	she	330	" That is impossible . Something else than that ought to have been thought of . My uncle ought not to allow that . I will not submit to it . "
101106	101228	101070	101070	she	330	" My sweet child , what else could have been thought of ? Your uncle , I am sure , is as kind as he can be : but he is suffering himself ; he has his family to bring up . And do you quite understand ? You must remember we have nothing . We shall have absolutely nothing except what he and my sister give us . They have been as wise and active a possible , and we must try to earn something . I and the girls are going to work a table - cloth border for the Ladies ' Charity at Winchester , and a communion cloth that the parishioners are to present to Pennicote Church . "
101288	101302	101303	101303	Gwendolen	289	" But surely somewhere else than Sawyer 's Cottage might have been found , "
101325	101373	101320	101321	an exciseman	3148	" No , indeed , dear . You know houses are scarce , and we may be thankful to get anything so private . It is not so very bad . There are two little parlors and four bedrooms . You shall sit alone whenever you like . "
101399	101437	101390	101390	Gwendolen	289	" I can not conceive that all your property is gone at once , mamma . How can you be sure in so short a time ? It is not a week since you wrote to me . "
101438	101461	101390	101390	Gwendolen	289	" The first news came much earlier , dear . But I would not spoil your pleasure till it was quite necessary . "
101462	101468	101470	101470	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , how vexatious ! "
101477	101535	101536	101536	She	289	" If I had known , I could have brought home the money I had won : and for want of knowing , I stayed and lost it . I had nearly two hundred pounds , and it would have done for us to live on a little while , till I could carry out some plan . "
101546	101563	101536	101536	She	289	" Everything has gone against me . People have come near me only to blight me . "
101566	101568	101569	101569	she	289	" people "
101605	101619	101621	101623	poor Mrs. Davilow	330	" We must resign ourselves to the will of Providence , my child , "
101644	101646	101640	101640	She	289	" people "
101661	101715	101658	101658	Gwendolen	289	" But I do n't resign myself . I shall do what I can against it . What is the good of calling the people 's wickedness Providence ? You said in your letter it was Mr. Lassman 's fault we had lost our money . Has he run away with it all ? "
101716	101752	101640	101640	She	289	" No , dear , you do n't understand . There were great speculations : he meant to gain . It was all about mines and things of that sort . He risked too much . "
101753	101809	101658	101658	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't call that Providence : it was his improvidence with our money , and he ought to be punished . Ca n't we go to law and recover our fortune ? My uncle ought to take measures , and not sit down by such wrongs . We ought to go to law . "
101810	101887	101640	101640	She	289	" My dear child , law can never bring back money lost in that way . Your uncle says it is milk spilled upon the ground . Besides , one must have a fortune to get any law : there is no law for people who are ruined . And our money has only gone along with other 's people 's . We are not the only sufferers : others have to resign themselves besides us . "
101888	101931	101658	101658	Gwendolen	289	" But I do n't resign myself to live at Sawyer 's Cottage and see you working for sixpences and shillings because of that . I shall not do it . I shall do what is more befitting our rank and education . "
101932	101957	101959	101960	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I am sure your uncle and all of us will approve of that , dear , and admire you the more for it , "
101974	102021	101959	101960	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I did n't mean that you should resign yourself to worse when anything better offered itself . Both your uncle and aunt have felt that your abilities and education were a fortune for you , and they have already heard of something within your reach . "
102022	102029	101658	101658	Gwendolen	289	" What is that , mamma ? "
102048	102123	102124	102125	Mrs. Davilow	330	" There are two situations that offer themselves . One is in a bishop 's family , where there are three daughters , and the other is in quite a high class of school ; and in both , your French , and music , and dancing and then your manners and habits as a lady , are exactly what is wanted . Each is a hundred a year and just for the present , "
102132	102158	102124	102125	Mrs. Davilow	330	" to save you from the petty , common way of living that we must go to you would perhaps accept one of the two . "
102159	102173	101658	101658	Gwendolen	289	" What ! be like Miss Graves at Madame Meunier 's ? No . "
102174	102200	102124	102125	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I think , myself , that Dr. Monpert 's would be more suitable . There could be no hardship in a bishop 's family . "
102201	102271	101658	101658	Gwendolen	289	" Excuse me , mamma . There are hardships everywhere for a governess . And I do n't see that it would be pleasanter to be looked down on in a bishop 's family than in any other . Besides , you know very well I hate teaching . Fancy me shut up with three awkward girls something like Alice ! I would rather emigrate than be a governess . "
102370	102384	102386	102386	Gwendolen	289	" I have some ornaments , mamma , and I could sell them , "
102388	102460	102386	102386	Gwendolen	289	" They would make a sum : I want a little sum just to go on with . I dare say Marshall , at Wanchester , would take them : I know he showed me some bracelets once that he said he had bought from a lady . Jocosa might go and ask him . Jocosa is going to leave us , of course . But she might do that first . "
102461	102524	102579	102580	Mrs. Davilow	330	" She would do anything she could , poor , dear soul . I have not told you yet she wanted me to take all her savings her three hundred pounds . I tell her to set up a little school . It will be hard for her to go into a new family now she has been so long with us . "
102525	102537	102539	102539	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , recommend her for the bishop 's daughter 's , "
102551	102563	102548	102548	her	289	" I am sure she will do better than I should . "
102564	102577	102579	102580	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Do take care not to say such things to your uncle , "
102582	102619	102579	102580	Mrs. Davilow	330	" He will be hurt at your despising what he has exerted himself about . But I dare say you have something else in your mind that he might not disapprove , if you consulted him . "
102620	102669	102548	102548	her	289	" There is some one else I want to consult first . Are the Arrowpoint 's at Quetcham still , and is Herr Klesmer there ? But I daresay you know nothing about it , poor , dear mamma . Can Jeffries go on horseback with a note ? "
102670	102744	102579	102580	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh , my dear , Jefferies is not here , and the dealer has taken the horses . But some one could go for us from Leek 's farm . The Arrowpoints are at Quetcham , I know . Miss Arrowpoint left her card the other day : I could not see her . But I do n't know about Herr Klesmer . Do you want to send before to - morrow ? "
102745	102759	102761	102761	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , as soon as possible . I will write a note , "
102765	102775	102777	102778	Mrs. Davilow	330	" What can you be thinking of , Gwen ? "
102795	102809	102811	102811	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't mind what , there 's a dear , good mamma , "
102822	102868	102814	102814	herself	289	" I mean to do something . Never mind what until it is all settled . And then you shall be comforted . The dear face ! it is ten years older in these three weeks . Now , now , now ! do n't cry "
102885	102930	102869	102869	Gwendolen	289	" But mind you do n't contradict me or put hindrances in my way . I must decide for myself . I can not be dictated to by my uncle or any one else . My life is my own affair . And I think "
102939	102957	102932	102932	her	289	" I think I can do better for you than let you live in Sawyer 's Cottage . "
103058	103070	103075	103075	she	289	" Pray get this sent to Quetcham at once , mamma , "
103080	103098	103075	103075	she	289	" The man must be told to wait for an answer . Let no time be lost . "
103356	103361	103403	103403	Gwendolen	289	" taking a situation , "
103462	103464	103458	103464	the first who said " No "	8989	" No "
103515	103524	103510	103510	Gwendolen	289	" pat betwixt too early and too late , "
103773	103776	103758	103758	Nature	459	" only children "
104976	104979	104991	104992	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" how far "
105528	105535	105518	105518	they	3239	" Buy cheap , sell dear . "
105675	105688	105655	105655	he	265	" I had no idea before that you were a political man . "
105711	105748	105655	105655	he	265	" You must have been used to public speaking . You speak uncommonly well , though I do n't agree with you . From what you said about sentiment , I fancy you are a Panslavist . "
105749	105763	105765	105765	Klesmer	265	" No ; my name is Elijah . I am the Wandering Jew , "
105813	105820	105822	105823	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" Herr Klesmer has cosmopolitan ideas , "
105834	105844	105822	105823	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" He looks forward to a fusion of races . "
105845	105851	105853	105854	Mr. Bult	469	" With all my heart , "
105861	105876	105853	105854	Mr. Bult	469	" I was sure he had too much talent to be a mere musician . "
105877	105889	105891	105891	Klesmer	265	" Ah , sir , you are under some mistake there , "
105896	106004	105891	105891	Klesmer	265	" No man has too much talent to be a musician . Most men have too little . A creative artist is no more a mere musician than a great statesman is a mere politician . We are not ingenious puppets , sir , who live in a box and look out on the world only when it is gaping for amusement . We help to rule the nations and make the age as much as any other public men . We count ourselves on level benches with legislators . And a man who speaks effectively through music is compelled to something more difficult than parliamentary eloquence . "
106033	106044	106023	106024	Mr. Bult	469	" Your pianist does not think small beer of himself . "
106045	106055	106057	106058	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" Herr Klesmer is something more than a pianist , "
106062	106084	106057	106058	Miss Arrowpoint	252	" He is a great musician in the fullest sense of the word . He will rank with Schubert and Mendelssohn . "
106085	106094	106096	106097	Mr. Bult	469	" Ah , you ladies understand these things , "
106140	106157	106116	106116	Catherine	264	" Why were you so heated last night with Mr. Bult ? He meant no harm . "
106158	106168	106170	106170	Klesmer	265	" You wish me to be complaisant to him ? "
106175	106190	106096	106097	Mr. Bult	469	" I think it is hardly worth your while to be other than civil . "
106191	106239	106116	106116	Catherine	264	" You find no difficulty in tolerating him , then ? you have a respect for a political platitudinarian as insensible as an ox to everything he ca n't turn into political capital . You think his monumental obtuseness suited to the dignity of the English gentleman . "
106240	106247	106096	106097	Mr. Bult	469	" I did not say that . "
106248	106264	106116	106116	Catherine	264	" You mean that I acted without dignity , and you are offended with me . "
106265	106274	106276	106276	Catherine	264	" Now you are slightly nearer the truth , "
106280	106299	106116	106116	Catherine	264	" Then I had better put my burial - clothes in my portmanteau and set off at once . "
106300	106328	106116	106116	Catherine	264	" I do n't see that . If I have to bear your criticism of my operetta , you should not mind my criticism of your impatience . "
106329	106408	106116	106116	Catherine	264	" But I do mind it . You would have wished me to take his ignorant impertinence about a ' mere musician ' without letting him know his place . I am to hear my gods blasphemed as well as myself insulted . But I beg pardon . It is impossible you should see the matter as I do . Even you ca n't understand the wrath of the artist : he is of another caste for you . "
106409	106414	106416	106416	Catherine	264	" That is true , "
106424	106440	106416	106416	Catherine	264	" He is of a caste to which I look up a caste above mine . "
106467	106550	106465	106465	he	265	" That is finely felt I am grateful . But I had better go , all the same . I have made up my mind to go , for good and all . You can get on exceedingly well without me : your operetta is on wheels it will go of itself . And your Mr. Bull 's company fits me ' wie die Faust ins Auge . ' I am neglecting my engagements . I must go off to St. Petersburg . "
106556	106567	106569	106569	Klesmer	265	" You agree with me that I had better go ? "
106575	106638	106465	106465	he	265	" Certainly ; if that is what your business and feeling prompt . I have only to wonder that you have consented to give us so much of your time in the last year . There must be treble the interest to you anywhere else . I have never thought of you consenting to come here as anything else than a sacrifice . "
106639	106647	106649	106649	Klesmer	265	" Why should I make the sacrifice ? "
106686	106697	106680	106680	he	265	" Ich hab ' dich geliebet und liebe dich noch . "
106698	106704	106706	106706	Catherine	264	" That is the mystery , "
106748	106755	106760	106760	his	265	" You can conceive no motive ? "
106763	106772	106760	106760	his	265	" None that seems in the least probable . "
106773	106807	106723	106723	she	264	" Then I shall tell you . It is because you are to me the chief woman in the world the throned lady whose colors I carry between my heart and my armor . "
106835	106917	106832	106832	Klesmer	265	" This would be the last impertinence in me , if I meant to found anything upon it . That is out of the question . I meant no such thing . But you once said it was your doom to suspect every man who courted you of being an adventurer , and what made you angriest was men 's imputing to you the folly of believing that they courted you for your own sake . Did you not say so ? "
106918	106922	107025	107025	he	265	" Very likely , "
106932	107021	107022	107022	Klesmer	265	" It was a bitter word . Well , at least one man who has seen women as plenty as flowers in May has lingered about you for your own sake . And since he is one whom you can never marry , you will believe him . There is an argument in favor of some other man . But do n't give yourself for a meal to a minotaur like Bult . I shall go now and pack . I shall make my excuses to Mrs. Arrowpoint . "
107035	107044	107047	107047	Catherine	264	" You must take this heap of manuscript , "
107082	107099	107101	107101	Catherine	264	" Why should I not marry the man who loves me , if I love him ? "
107122	107172	107113	107114	a woman	801	" It would be too hard impossible you could not carry it through . I am not worth what you would have to encounter . I will not accept the sacrifice . It would be thought a mťsalliance for you and I should be liable to the worst accusations . "
107173	107200	107101	107101	Catherine	264	" Is it the accusations you are afraid of ? I am afraid of nothing but that we should miss the passing of our lives together . "
107358	107361	107364	107364	she	3257	" Tasso , "
107568	107595	107549	107549	she	253	" If Klesmer has presumed to offer himself to you , your father shall horsewhip him off the premises . Pray , speak , Mr. Arrowpoint . "
107613	107621	107602	107602	his	1507	" This will never do , Cath . "
107622	107625	107627	107628	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Do ! "
107630	107669	107627	107628	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" who in their senses ever thought it would do ? You might as well say poisoning and strangling will not do . It is a comedy you have got up , Catherine . Else you are mad . "
107670	107716	107596	107597	The father	1507	" I am quite sane and serious , mamma , and Herr Klesmer is not to blame . He never thought of my marrying him . I found out that he loved me , and loving him , I told him I would marry him . "
107717	107724	107726	107727	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Leave that unsaid , Catherine , "
107731	107789	107726	107727	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Every one else will say that for you . You will be a public fable . Every one will say that you must have made an offer to a man who has been paid to come to the house who is nobody knows what a gypsy , a Jew , a mere bubble of the earth . "
107790	107796	107798	107798	Catherine	264	" Never mind , mamma , "
107805	107817	107798	107798	Catherine	264	" We all know he is a genius as Tasso was . "
107818	107830	107832	107833	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Those times were not these , nor is Klesmer Tasso , "
107839	107854	107832	107833	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" There is no sting in that sarcasm , except the sting of undutifulness . "
107855	107892	107798	107798	Catherine	264	" I am sorry to hurt you , mamma . But I will not give up the happiness of my life to ideas that I do n't believe in and customs I have no respect for . "
107893	107928	107832	107833	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You have lost all sense of duty , then ? You have forgotten that you are our only child that it lies with you to place a great property in the right hands ? "
107929	107944	107798	107798	Catherine	264	" What are the right hands ? My grandfather gained the property in trade . "
107945	107959	107832	107833	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Mr. Arrowpoint , will you sit by and hear this without speaking ? "
107960	107976	107978	107979	the father	1507	" I am a gentleman , Cath . We expect you to marry a gentleman , "
107984	107996	107998	107999	the mother	1566	" And a man connected with the institutions of this country , "
108001	108022	107998	107999	the mother	1566	" A woman in your position has serious duties . Where duty and inclination clash , she must follow duty . "
108023	108030	108032	108032	Catherine	264	" I do n't deny that , "
108044	108078	108032	108032	Catherine	264	" But one may say very true things and apply them falsely . People can easily take the sacred word duty as a name for what they desire any one else to do . "
108079	108092	107998	107999	the mother	1566	" Your parent 's desire makes no duty for you , then ? "
108093	108109	108032	108032	Catherine	264	" Yes , within reason . But before I give up the happiness of my life "
108110	108122	108124	108125	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Catherine , Catherine , it will not be your happiness , "
108135	108203	108128	108128	her	253	" Well , what seems to me my happiness before I give it up , I must see some better reason than the wish that I should marry a nobleman , or a man who votes with a party that he may be turned into a nobleman . I feel at liberty to marry the man I love and think worthy , unless some higher duty forbids . "
108204	108251	108032	108032	Catherine	264	" And so it does , Catherine , though you are blinded and can not see it . It is a woman 's duty not to lower herself . You are lowering yourself . Mr. Arrowpoint , will you tell your daughter what is her duty ? "
108252	108268	108270	108271	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" You must see , Catherine , that Klesmer is not the man for you , "
108273	108295	108270	108271	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" He wo n't do at the head of estates . He has a deuced foreign look is an unpractical man . "
108296	108385	108032	108032	Catherine	264	" I really ca n't see what that has to do with it , papa . The land of England has often passed into the hands of foreigners Dutch soldiers , sons of foreign women of bad character : if our land were sold to - morrow it would very likely pass into the hands of some foreign merchant on ' Change . It is in everybody 's mouth that successful swindlers may buy up half the land in the country . How can I stem that tide ? "
108386	108398	108400	108401	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" It will never do to argue about marriage , Cath , "
108403	108436	108400	108401	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" It 's no use getting up the subject like a parliamentary question . We must do as other people do . We must think of the nation and the public good . "
108437	108450	108452	108452	Catherine	264	" I ca n't see any public good concerned here , papa , "
108454	108518	108452	108452	Catherine	264	" Why is it to be expected of any heiress that she should carry the property gained in trade into the hands of a certain class ? That seems to be a ridiculous mishmash of superannuated customs and false ambition . I should call it a public evil . People had better make a new sort of public good by changing their ambitions . "
108519	108527	108529	108530	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" That is mere sophistry , Catherine , "
108532	108555	108529	108530	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Because you do n't wish to marry a nobleman , you are not obliged to marry a mountebank or a charlatan . "
108556	108569	108452	108452	Catherine	264	" I can not understand the application of such words , mamma . "
108570	108578	108580	108581	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" No , I dare say not , "
108587	108605	108580	108581	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You have got to a pitch at which we are not likely to understand each other . "
108606	108615	108617	108618	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" It ca n't be done , Cath , "
108634	108654	108617	108618	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" A man like Klesmer ca n't marry such a property as yours . It ca n't be done . "
108655	108663	108665	108666	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" It certainly will not be done , "
108670	108681	108665	108666	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Where is the man ? Let him be fetched . "
108682	108692	108694	108694	Catherine	264	" I can not fetch him to be insulted , "
108696	108704	108694	108694	Catherine	264	" Nothing will be achieved by that . "
108705	108725	108727	108728	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" I suppose you would wish him to know that in marrying you he will not marry your fortune , "
108730	108746	108665	108666	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Certainly ; if it were so , I should wish him to know it . "
108747	108755	108694	108694	Catherine	264	" Then you had better fetch him . "
108767	108770	108771	108771	She	264	" Come . "
108779	108783	108785	108786	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" Herr Klesmer , "
108794	108817	108785	108786	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" it is unnecessary to repeat what has passed between us and our daughter . Mr. Arrowpoint will tell you our resolution . "
108818	108827	108829	108830	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" Your marrying is out of the question , "
108850	108867	108829	108830	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" It is a wild scheme altogether . A man has been called out for less . "
108868	108879	108882	108883	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You have taken a base advantage of our confidence , "
108910	108929	108931	108932	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" The pretension is ridiculous . You had better give it up and leave the house at once , "
108943	108957	108959	108959	Klesmer	265	" I can give up nothing without reference to your daughter 's wish , "
108961	108968	108959	108959	Klesmer	265	" My engagement is to her . "
108969	108978	108980	108981	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" It is useless to discuss the question , "
108983	109016	108980	108981	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" We shall never consent to the marriage . If Catherine disobeys us we shall disinherit her . You will not marry her fortune . It is right you should know that . "
109017	109054	108959	108959	Klesmer	265	" Madam , her fortune has been the only thing I have had to regret about her . But I must ask her if she will not think the sacrifice greater than I am worthy of . "
109055	109063	109065	109065	Catherine	264	" It is no sacrifice to me , "
109067	109095	109065	109065	Catherine	264	" except that I am sorry to hurt my father and mother . I have always felt my fortune to be a wretched fatality of my life . "
109096	109105	109107	109108	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You mean to defy us , then ? "
109110	109118	109120	109120	Catherine	264	" I mean to marry Herr Klesmer , "
109124	109134	109136	109137	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" He had better not count on our relenting , "
109157	109160	109162	109162	Klesmer	265	" Madam , "
109164	109242	109162	109162	Klesmer	265	" certain reasons forbid me to retort . But understand that I consider it out of the power either of you , or of your fortune , to confer on me anything that I value . My rank as an artist is of my own winning , and I would not exchange it for any other . I am able to maintain your daughter , and I ask for no change in my life but her companionship . "
109243	109252	109254	109255	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" You will leave the house , however , "
109257	109263	109265	109265	Klesmer	265	" I go at once , "
109273	109282	109284	109284	Catherine	264	" Let there be no misunderstanding , mamma , "
109286	109302	109284	109284	Catherine	264	" I consider myself engaged to Herr Klesmer , and I intend to marry him . "
109318	109325	109327	109328	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" It 's all very fine , "
109335	109348	109327	109328	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" but what the deuce are we to do with the property ? "
109349	109361	109311	109311	her	1566	" There is Harry Brendall . He can take the name . "
109362	109374	109376	109377	Mr. Arrowpoint	272	" Harry Brendall will get through it all in no time , "
109549	109557	109559	109559	Gwendolen	289	" Pray go to church , mamma , "
109564	109572	109573	109573	He	3221	" I prefer seeing Herr Klesmer alone . "
109590	109599	109601	109602	Mrs. Davilow	330	" That is hardly correct , I think , "
109606	109621	109623	109623	Gwendolen	289	" Our affairs are too serious for us to think of such nonsensical rules , "
109627	109636	109623	109623	Gwendolen	289	" They are insulting as well as ridiculous . "
109637	109655	109697	109697	her	289	" You would not mind Isabel sitting with you ? She would be reading in a corner . "
109656	109694	109623	109623	Gwendolen	289	" No ; she could not : she would bite her nails and stare . It would be too irritating . Trust my judgment , mamma , I must be alone , Take them all to church . "
110107	110111	110105	110105	she	289	" I am beautiful "
110381	110403	110377	110377	her	289	" It is most kind of you to come , Herr Klesmer . I hope you have not thought me presumptuous . "
110404	110417	110419	110419	Klesmer	265	" I took your wish as a command that did me honor , "
110536	110630	110531	110531	she	289	" I wish to consult you , Herr Klesmer . We have lost all our fortune ; we have nothing . I must get my own bread , and I desire to provide for my mamma , so as to save her from any hardship . The only way I can think of and I should like it better than anything is to be an actress to go on the stage . But , of course , I should like to take a high position , and I thought if you thought I could "
110638	110654	110632	110632	Gwendolen	289	" it would be better for me to be a singer to study singing also . "
110674	110678	110679	110679	Gwendolen	289	" I know , "
110690	110773	110679	110679	Gwendolen	289	" I know that my method of singing is very defective ; but I have been ill taught . I could be better taught ; I could study . And you will understand my wish : to sing and act too , like Grisi , is a much higher position . Naturally , I should wish to take as high rank as I can . And I can rely on your judgment . I am sure you will tell me the truth . "
110871	110899	110852	110852	he	265	" You have never seen anything , I think , of artists and their lives ? I mean of musicians , actors , artists of that kind ? "
110900	110905	110907	110907	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , no , "
110930	110936	110938	110938	Klesmer	265	" You are pardon me , "
110945	110969	110938	110938	Klesmer	265	" in coming to a conclusion on such a matter as this , everything must be taken into consideration you are perhaps twenty ? "
110970	110977	110979	110979	Gwendolen	289	" I am twenty - one , "
110988	110997	110979	110979	Gwendolen	289	" Do you think I am too old ? "
111015	111023	111025	111025	Gwendolen	289	" Many persons begin later than others , "
111053	111099	111039	111039	Klesmer	265	" You have probably not thought of an artistic career until now : you did not entertain the notion , the longing what shall I say ? you did not wish yourself an actress , or anything of that sort , till the present trouble ? "
111100	111133	111135	111135	Gwendolen	289	" Not exactly : but I was fond of acting . I have acted ; you saw me , if you remember you saw me here in charades , and as Hermione , "
111144	111149	111150	111150	he	265	" Yes , yes , "
111154	111161	111150	111150	he	265	" I remember I remember perfectly , "
111235	111258	111210	111210	she	289	" I shall be very much obliged to you for taking the trouble to give me your advice , whatever it maybe . "
111259	111263	111265	111265	Klesmer	265	" Miss Harleth , "
111279	111360	111265	111265	Klesmer	265	" I will veil nothing from you in this matter . I should reckon myself guilty if I put a false visage on things made them too black or too white . The gods have a curse for him who willingly tells another the wrong road . And if I misled one who is so young , so beautiful who , I trust , will find her happiness along the right road , I should regard myself as a BŲsewicht . "
111403	111454	111462	111462	Klesmer	265	" You are a beautiful young lady you have been brought up in ease you have done what you would you have not said to yourself , ' I must know this exactly , ' ' I must understand this exactly , ' ' I must do this exactly , ' "
111471	111500	111462	111462	Klesmer	265	" In sum , you have not been called upon to be anything but a charming young lady , whom it is an impoliteness to find fault with . "
111524	111590	111522	111522	he	265	" Well , then , with that preparation , you wish to try the life of an artist ; you wish to try a life of arduous , unceasing work , and uncertain praise . Your praise would have to be earned , like your bread ; and both would come slowly , scantily what do I say ? they may hardly come at all . "
111632	111677	111630	111630	she	289	" I thought that you , being an artist , would consider the life one of the most honorable and delightful . And if I can do nothing better ? I suppose I can put up with the same risks as other people do . "
111678	111683	111685	111685	Klesmer	265	" Do nothing better ? "
111691	111838	111685	111685	Klesmer	265	" No , my dear Miss Harleth , you could do nothing better neither man nor woman could do anything better if you could do what was best or good of its kind . I am not decrying the life of the true artist . I am exalting it . I say , it is out of the reach of any but choice organizations natures framed to love perfection and to labor for it ; ready , like all true lovers , to endure , to wait , to say , I am not yet worthy , but she Art , my mistress is worthy , and I will live to merit her . An honorable life ? Yes . But the honor comes from the inward vocation and the hard - won achievement : there is no honor in donning the life as a livery . "
112044	112138	112035	112035	She	289	" I am quite prepared to bear hardships at first . Of course no one can become celebrated all at once . And it is not necessary that every one should be first - rate either actresses or singers . If you would be so kind as to tell me what steps I should take , I shall have the courage to take them . I do n't mind going up hill . It will be easier than the dead level of being a governess . I will take any steps you recommend . "
112149	112229	112035	112035	She	289	" I will tell you the steps , not that I recommend , but that will be forced upon you . It is all one , so far , what your goal will be excellence , celebrity , second , third rateness it is all one . You must go to town under the protection of your mother . You must put yourself under training musical , dramatic , theatrical : whatever you desire to do you have to learn "
112252	112379	112245	112245	his	265	" I know . You have exercised your talents you recite you sing from the drawing - room standpunkt . My dear Fršulein , you must unlearn all that . You have not yet conceived what excellence is : you must unlearn your mistaken admirations . You must know what you have to strive for , and then you must subdue your mind and body to unbroken discipline . Your mind , I say . For you must not be thinking of celebrity : put that candle out of your eyes , and look only at excellence . You would of course earn nothing you could get no engagement for a long while . You would need money for yourself and your family . But that , "
112394	112401	112381	112381	Klesmer	265	" that could perhaps be found . "
112533	112591	112518	112518	Klesmer	265	" Now , what sort of issue might be fairly expected from all this self - denial ? You would ask that . It is right that your eyes should be open to it . I will tell you truthfully . This issue would be uncertain , and , most probably , would not be worth much . "
112647	112661	112637	112637	She	289	" You think I want talent , or am too old to begin . "
112675	112862	112662	112662	Klesmer	265	" Yes ! The desire and the training should have begun seven years ago or a good deal earlier . A mountebank 's child who helps her father to earn shillings when she is six years old a child that inherits a singing throat from a long line of choristers and learns to sing as it learns to talk , has a likelier beginning . Any great achievement in acting or in music grows with the growth . Whenever an artist has been able to say , ' I came , I saw , I conquered , ' it has been at the end of patient practice . Genius at first is little more than a great capacity for receiving discipline . Singing and acting , like the fine dexterity of the juggler with his cups and balls , require a shaping of the organs toward a finer and finer certainty of effect . Your muscles your whole frame must go like a watch , true , true to a hair . That is the work of spring - time , before habits have been determined . "
112863	112871	112873	112873	Gwendolen	289	" I did not pretend to genius , "
112890	112905	112878	112878	she	289	" I only suppose that I might have a little talent enough to improve . "
112906	112913	112915	112915	Klesmer	265	" I do n't deny that , "
112917	112983	112915	112915	Klesmer	265	" If you had been put in the right track some years ago and had worked well you might now have made a public singer , though I do n't think your voice would have counted for much in public . For the stage your personal charms and intelligence might then have told without the present drawback of inexperience lack of discipline lack of instruction . "
113198	113268	113192	113192	she	289	" I understood , of course , that no one can be a finished actress at once . It may be impossible to tell beforehand whether I should succeed ; but that seems to me a reason why I should try . I should have thought that I might have taken an engagement at a theatre meanwhile , so as to earn money and study at the same time . "
113269	113458	113478	113478	she	289	" Ca n't be done , my dear Miss Harleth I speak plainly it ca n't be done . I must clear your mind of these notions which have no more resemblance to reality than a pantomime . Ladies and gentlemen think that when they have made their toilet and drawn on their gloves they are as presentable on the stage as in a drawing - room . No manager thinks that . With all your grace and charm , if you were to present yourself as an aspirant to the stage , a manager would either require you to pay as an amateur for being allowed to perform or he would tell you to go and be taught trained to bear yourself on the stage , as a horse , however beautiful , must be trained for the circus ; to say nothing of that study which would enable you to personate a character consistently , and animate it with the natural language of face , gesture , and tone . For you to get an engagement fit for you straight away is out of the question . "
113459	113467	113469	113469	Gwendolen	289	" I really can not understand that , "
113483	113536	113478	113478	she	289	" I shall be obliged to you if you will explain how it is that such poor actresses get engaged . I have been to the theatre several times , and I am sure there were actresses who seemed to me to act not at all well and who were quite plain . "
113537	113680	113478	113478	she	289	" Ah , my dear Miss Harleth , that is the easy criticism of the buyer . We who buy slippers toss away this pair and the other as clumsy ; but there went an apprenticeship to the making of them . Excuse me ; you could not at present teach one of those actresses ; but there is certainly much that she could teach you . For example , she can pitch her voice so as to be heard : ten to one you could not do it till after many trials . Merely to stand and move on the stage is an art requires practice . It is understood that we are not now talking of a comparse in a petty theatre who earns the wages of a needle - woman . That is out of the question for you . "
113681	113691	113693	113693	Gwendolen	289	" Of course I must earn more than that , "
113706	113793	113693	113693	Gwendolen	289	" but I think I could soon learn to do tolerably well all those little things you have mentioned . I am not so very stupid . And even in Paris , I am sure , I saw two actresses playing important ladies ' parts who were not at all ladies and quite ugly . I suppose I have no particular talent , but I must think it is an advantage , even on the stage , to be a lady and not a perfect fright . "
113794	113803	113805	113805	Klesmer	265	" Ah , let us understand each other , "
113814	114061	113805	113805	Klesmer	265	" I was speaking of what you would have to go through if you aimed at becoming a real artist if you took music and the drama as a higher vocation in which you would strive after excellence . On that head , what I have said stands fast . You would find after your education in doing things slackly for one - and - twenty years great difficulties in study ; you would find mortifications in the treatment you would get when you presented yourself on the footing of skill . You would be subjected to tests ; people would no longer feign not to see your blunders . You would at first only be accepted on trial . You would have to bear what I may call a glaring insignificance : any success must be won by the utmost patience . You would have to keep your place in a crowd , and after all it is likely you would lose it and get out of sight . If you determine to face these hardships and still try , you will have the dignity of a high purpose , even though you may have chosen unfortunately . You will have some merit , though you may win no prize . You have asked my judgment on your chances of winning . I do n't pretend to speak absolutely ; but measuring probabilities , my judgment is : you will hardly achieve more than mediocrity . "
114103	114106	114109	114109	he	265	" But , "
114125	114332	114109	114109	he	265	" But there are certainly other ideas , other dispositions with which a young lady may take up an art that will bring her before the public . She may rely on the unquestioned power of her beauty as a passport . She may desire to exhibit herself to an admiration which dispenses with skill . This goes a certain way on the stage : not in music : but on the stage , beauty is taken when there is nothing more commanding to be had . Not without some drilling , however : as I have said before , technicalities have in any case to be mastered . But these excepted , we have here nothing to do with art . The woman who takes up this career is not an artist : she is usually one who thinks of entering on a luxurious life by a short and easy road perhaps by marriage that is her most brilliant chance , and the rarest . Still , her career will not be luxurious to begin with : she can hardly earn her own poor bread independently at once , and the indignities she will be liable to are such as I will not speak of . "
114333	114340	114342	114342	Gwendolen	289	" I desire to be independent , "
114358	114413	114352	114352	herself	289	" That was my reason for asking whether I could not get an immediate engagement . Of course I can not know how things go on about theatres . But I thought that I could have made myself independent . I have no money , and I will not accept help from any one . "
114445	114455	114457	114457	Klesmer	265	" That is a hard saying for your friends , "
114472	114589	114457	114457	Klesmer	265	" I have given you pain . That was inevitable . I was bound to put the truth , the unvarnished truth , before you . I have not said I will not say you will do wrong to choose the hard , climbing path of an endeavoring artist . You have to compare its difficulties with those of any less hazardous any more private course which opens itself to you . If you take that more courageous resolve I will ask leave to shake hands with you on the strength of our freemasonry , where we are all vowed to the service of art , and to serve her by helping every fellow - servant . "
114630	114816	114623	114623	Klesmer	265	" Where there is the duty of service there must be the duty of accepting it . The question is not one of personal obligation . And in relation to practical matters immediately affecting your future excuse my permitting myself to mention in confidence an affair of my own . I am expecting an event which would make it easy for me to exert myself on your behalf in furthering your opportunities of instruction and residence in London under the care , that is , of your family without need for anxiety on your part . If you resolve to take art as a bread - study , you need only undertake the study at first ; the bread will be found without trouble . The event I mean is my marriage in fact you will receive this as a matter of confidence my marriage with Miss Arrowpoint , which will more than double such right as I have to be trusted by you as a friend . Your friendship will have greatly risen in value for her by your having adopted that generous labor . "
115051	115149	115025	115025	she	289	" I congratulate you sincerely , Herr Klesmer . I think I never saw any one so admirable as Miss Arrowpoint . And I have to thank you for every sort of kindness this morning . But I ca n't decide now . If I make the resolve you have spoken of , I will use your permission I will let you know . But I fear the obstacles are too great . In any case , I am deeply obliged to you . It was very bold of me to ask you to take this trouble . "
115156	115164	115150	115150	Klesmer	265	" She will never let me know . "
115178	115201	115175	115175	he	265	" Command me at any time . There is an address on this card which will always find me with little delay . "
115277	115294	115265	115265	she	289	" If I take the wrong road , it will not be because of your flattery . "
115295	115314	115316	115316	Klesmer	265	" God forbid that you should take any road but one where you will find and give happiness ! "
115853	115903	115807	115807	his	265	" Too old should have begun seven years ago you will not , at best , achieve more than mediocrity hard , incessant work , uncertain praise bread coming slowly , scantily , perhaps not at all mortifications , people no longer feigning not to see your blunders glaring insignificance "

116227	116233	116235	116237	gentle Mrs. Davilow	330	" Well , my darling , "
116241	116263	116235	116237	gentle Mrs. Davilow	330	" I see by the wheel - marks that Klesmer has been here . Have you been satisfied with the interview ? "
116280	116289	116291	116291	Gwendolen	289	" Satisfied , mamma ? oh , yes , "
116355	116367	116369	116370	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Your uncle and aunt were disappointed at not seeing you , "
116383	116392	116369	116370	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I only said that you wanted rest . "
116393	116399	116401	116401	Gwendolen	289	" Quite right , mamma , "
116415	116435	116437	116438	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Am I not to know anything now , Gwendolen ? Am I always to be in the dark ? "
116459	116470	116472	116472	Gwendolen	289	" There is really nothing to tell now , mamma , "
116480	116502	116472	116472	Gwendolen	289	" I had a mistaken idea about something I could do . Herr Klesmer has undeceived me . That is all . "
116503	116523	116525	116526	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Do n't look and speak in that way , my dear child : I can not bear it , "
116581	116680	116560	116560	her	289	" Mamma , do n't speak to me now . It is useless to cry and waste our strength over what ca n't be altered . You will live at Sawyer 's Cottage , and I am going to the bishop 's daughters . There is no more to be said . Things can not be altered , and who cares ? It makes no difference to any one else what we do . We must try not to care ourselves . We must not give way . I dread giving way . Help me to be quiet . "
116710	116733	116734	116734	WORDSWORTH	479	" I question things but do not find One that will answer to my mind : And all the world appears unkind . "
116858	116867	116869	116869	Gwendolen	289	" How shall you endure it , mamma ? "
116914	116943	116880	116880	her	289	" You and the four girls all in that closet of a room , with the green and yellow paper pressing on your eyes ? And without me ? "
116944	116961	116876	116876	She	289	" It will be some comfort that you have not to bear it too , dear . "
116962	116986	116880	116880	her	289	" If it were not that I must get some money , I would rather be there than go to be a governess . "
116987	117056	116876	116876	She	289	" Do n't set yourself against it beforehand , Gwendolen . If you go to the palace you will have every luxury about you . And you know how much you have always cared for that . You will not find it so hard as going up and down those steep narrow stairs , and hearing the crockery rattle through the house , and the dear girls talking . "
117057	117065	117067	117067	Gwendolen	289	" It is like a bad dream , "
117071	117097	117067	117067	Gwendolen	289	" I can not believe that my uncle will let you go to such a place . He ought to have taken some other steps . "
117098	117113	116876	116876	She	289	" Do n't be unreasonable , dear child . What could he have done ? "
117114	117145	117147	117147	Gwendolen	289	" That was for him to find out . It seems to me a very extraordinary world if people in our position must sink in this way all at once , "
117726	117880	117896	117896	Gwendolen	289	" I felt that there was no time to be lost , Gwendolen ; for a position in a good family where you will have some consideration is not to be had at a moment 's notice . And however long we waited we could hardly find one where you would be better off than at Bishop Mompert 's . I am known to both him and Mrs. Mompert , and that of course is an advantage to you . Our correspondence has gone on favorably ; but I can not be surprised that Mrs. Mompert wishes to see you before making an absolute engagement . She thinks of arranging for you to meet her at Wanchester when she is on her way to town . I dare say you will feel the interview rather trying for you , my dear ; but you will have a little time to prepare your mind . "
117881	117894	117896	117896	Gwendolen	289	" Do you know why she wants to see me , uncle ? "
117938	118073	117934	117935	The rector	1395	" Do n't be alarmed , my dear . She would like to have a more precise idea of you than my report can give . And a mother is naturally scrupulous about a companion for her daughters . I have told her you are very young . But she herself exercises a close supervision over her daughters ' education , and that makes her less anxious as to age . She is a woman of taste and also of strict principle , and objects to having a French person in the house . I feel sure that she will think your manners and accomplishments as good as she is likely to find ; and over the religious and moral tone of the education she , and indeed the bishop himself , will preside . "
118177	118329	118160	118160	he	7656	" I think so highly of the position , that I should have been tempted to try and get it for Anna , if she had been at all likely to meet Mrs. Mompert 's wants . It is really a home , with a continuance of education in the highest sense : ' governess ' is a misnomer . The bishop 's views are of a more decidedly Low Church color than my own he is a close friend of Lord Grampian 's ; but , though privately strict , he is not by any means narrow in public matters . Indeed , he has created as little dislike in his diocese as any bishop on the bench . He has always remained friendly to me , though before his promotion , when he was an incumbent of this diocese , we had a little controversy about the Bible Society . "

118489	118492	118494	118495	the rector	1395	" Yes , "
118503	118555	118494	118495	the rector	1395	" but that is in a school . I should not have the same satisfaction in your taking that . It would be much harder work , you are aware , and not so good in any other respect . Besides , you have not an equal chance of getting it . "
118556	118561	118563	118564	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" Oh dear no , "
118566	118583	118563	118564	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" it would be much less appropriate , You might not have a bedroom to yourself . "
118623	118634	118608	118608	She	289	" When is Mrs. Mompert likely to send for me ? "
118635	118696	118608	118608	She	289	" That is rather uncertain , but she has promised not to entertain any other proposal till she has seen you . She has entered with much feeling into your position . It will be within the next fortnight , probably . But I must be off now . I am going to let part of my glebe uncommonly well . "

118771	118781	118783	118784	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" What a stay Henry is to us all ? "
118794	118799	118801	118802	Mrs. Davilow	330	" He is indeed , "
118806	118822	118801	118802	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I think cheerfulness is a fortune in itself . I wish I had it . "
118823	118831	118833	118834	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" And Rex is just like him , "
118836	118860	118861	118861	she	230	" I must tell you the comfort we have had in a letter from him . I must read you a little bit , "
118949	119081	118939	118939	she	3400	" However , he tells us that our trouble has made a man of him ; he sees a reason for any amount of work : he means to get a fellowship , to take pupils , to set one of his brothers going , to be everything that is most remarkable . The letter is full of fun just like him . He says , ' Tell mother she has put out an advertisement for a jolly good hard - working son , in time to hinder me from taking ship ; and I offer myself for the place . ' The letter came on Friday . I never saw my husband so much moved by anything since Rex was born . It seemed a gain to balance our loss . "
119128	119139	119105	119105	she	289	" Nothing is wrong with you now , is it ? "

120533	120555	120530	120530	she	289	" I suppose I shall begin to pretend by - and - by , but why should I do it now ? "
120647	120650	120651	120651	she	3436	" Mamma , "
120660	120701	120651	120651	she	3436	" I had forgotten these things . Why did n't you remind me of them ? Do see about getting them sold . You will not mind about parting with them . You gave them all to me long ago . "
120711	120729	120731	120732	Mrs. Davilow	330	" If we can do without them , darling , I would rather keep them for you , "
120773	120787	120764	120771	the mother who tried to cheer the daughter	3448	" Why , how came you to put that pocket handkerchief in here ? "
120807	120821	120823	120823	Gwendolen	289	" It happened to be with the necklace I was in a hurry . "
120836	120845	120846	120846	she	289	" Do n't sell the necklace , mamma , "
120868	120916	120846	120846	she	289	" No , dear , no ; it was made out of your dear father 's chain . And I should prefer not selling the other things . None of them are of any great value . All my best ornaments were taken from me long ago . "
120958	120976	120955	120955	she	330	" And these things have not been reckoned on for any expenses . Carry them with you . "
120977	120986	120988	120988	Gwendolen	289	" That would be quite useless , mamma , "
120992	121022	120988	120988	Gwendolen	289	" Governesses do n't wear ornaments . You had better get me a gray frieze livery and a straw poke , such as my aunt 's charity children wear . "
121023	121054	120955	120955	she	330	" No , dear , no ; do n't take that view of it . I feel sure the Momperts will like you the better for being graceful and elegant . "
121055	121084	121086	121086	Gwendolen	289	" I am not at all sure what the Momperts will like me to be . It is enough that I am expected to be what they like , "
121089	121135	121137	121138	the mother	1566	" If there is anything you would object to less anything that could be done instead of your going to the bishop 's , do say so , Gwendolen . Tell me what is in your heart . I will try for anything you wish , "
121142	121157	121137	121138	the mother	1566	" Do n't keep things away from me . Let us bear them together . "
121158	121263	121137	121138	the mother	1566	" Oh , mamma , there is nothing to tell . I ca n't do anything better . I must think myself fortunate if they will have me . I shall get some money for you . That is the only thing I have to think of . I shall not spend any money this year : you will have all the eighty pounds . I do n't know how far that will go in housekeeping ; but you need not stitch your poor fingers to the bone , and stare away all the sight that the tears have left in your dear eyes . "
121305	121316	121318	121319	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Bless you for your tenderness , my good darling ! "
121327	121353	121318	121319	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Do n't despair because there are clouds now . You are so young . There may be great happiness in store for you yet . "
121354	121367	121369	121369	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't see any reason for expecting it , mamma , "
121389	121399	121377	121378	Mrs. Davilow	330	" What did happen between her and Mr. Grandcourt ? "
121400	121409	121411	121411	Gwendolen	289	" I will keep this necklace , mamma , "
121422	121481	121411	121411	Gwendolen	289	" But do get the other things sold , even if they will not bring much . Ask my uncle what to do with them . I shall certainly not use them again . I am going to take the veil . I wonder if all the poor wretches who have ever taken it felt as I do . "
121482	121490	121567	121567	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't exaggerate evils , dear . "
121491	121520	121411	121411	Gwendolen	289	" How can any one know that I exaggerate , when I am speaking of my own feeling ? I did not say what any one else felt . "

122337	122342	122344	122344	Grandcourt	325	" Ah , perhaps , "
122364	122400	122358	122359	Sir Hugo	209	" Oh , my dear , he is not a fool . You must not suppose that he ca n't see a joke . He can play his cards as well as most of us . "
122401	122413	122415	122416	Lady Mallinger	371	" He has never seemed to me a very sensible man , "
122814	122830	122791	122791	he	325	" You had better come over for a run or two when the season begins . "
123084	123097	123099	123100	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , you will let me know the turn of events , "
123102	123139	123099	123100	Sir Hugo	209	" if this marriage seems likely to come off after all , or if anything else happens to make the want of money pressing . My plan would be much better for him than burdening Ryelands . "
123140	123145	123147	123147	Lush	343	" That 's true , "
123149	123336	123147	123147	Lush	343	" only it must not be urged on him just placed in his way that the scent may tickle him . Grandcourt is not a man to be always led by what makes for his own interest ; especially if you let him see that it makes for your interest too . I 'm attached to him , of course . I 've given up everything else for the sake of keeping by him , and it has lasted a good fifteen years now . He would not easily get any one else to fill my place . He 's a peculiar character , is Henleigh Grandcourt , and it has been growing on him of late years . However , I 'm of a constant disposition , and I 've been a sort of guardian to him since he was twenty ; an uncommonly fascinating fellow he was then , to be sure and could be now , if he liked . I 'm attached to him ; and it would be a good deal worse for him if he missed me at his elbow . "
123456	123471	123449	123449	Grandcourt	325	" Are you making all the arrangements for our starting by the Paris train ? "
123472	123482	123484	123484	Lush	343	" I did n't know you meant to start , "
123492	123498	123500	123500	Grandcourt	325	" You might have known , "
123532	123563	123523	123523	he	325	" Just see to everything , will you ? and mind no brute gets into the same carriage with us . And leave my P. P. C. at the Mallingers . "
123753	123758	123802	123802	Grandcourt	325	" the sort of thing "
124538	124541	124529	124529	his	343	" Oh . "
124542	124547	124549	124549	Lush	343	" What is it ? "
124570	124586	124549	124549	Lush	343	" Shut the door , will you ? I ca n't speak into the corridor . "
124608	124615	124616	124616	He	343	" Is Miss Harleth at Offendene ? "
124648	124655	124657	124657	Lush	343	" Well , I hardly know , "
124661	124717	124657	124657	Lush	343	" The family 's utterly done up . They and the Gascoignes too have lost all their money . It 's owing to some rascally banking business . The poor mother has n't a sou , it seems . She and the girls have to huddle themselves into a little cottage like a laborer 's . "
124718	124729	124731	124731	Grandcourt	485	" Do n't lie to me , if you please , "
124739	124752	124731	124731	Grandcourt	485	" It 's not amusing , and it answers no other purpose . "
124753	124759	124761	124761	Lush	343	" What do you mean ? "
124780	124790	124731	124731	Grandcourt	485	" Just tell me the truth , will you ? "
124791	124824	124731	124731	Grandcourt	485	" It 's no invention of mine . I have heard the story from several Bazley , Brackenshaw 's man , for one . He is getting a new tenant for Offendene . "
124825	124842	124844	124844	Grandcourt	485	" I do n't mean that . Is Miss Harleth there , or is she not ? "
124851	124861	124863	124863	Lush	343	" Upon my soul , I ca n't tell , "
124868	124913	124863	124863	Lush	343	" She may have left yesterday . I heard she had taken a situation as governess ; she may be gone to it for what I know . But if you wanted to see her no doubt the mother would send for her back . "
124924	124936	124937	124937	Lush	343	" Send Hutchins to inquire whether she will be there tomorrow . "
125037	125119	125021	125021	he	343	" It would be as well for you to remember , Grandcourt , that you are coming under closer fire now . There can be none of the ordinary flirting done , which may mean everything or nothing . You must make up your mind whether you wish to be accepted ; and more than that , how you would like being refused . Either one or the other . You ca n't be philandering after her again for six weeks . "
125186	125346	125347	125347	Lush	343	" Everything has a more serious look now than it had before . There is her family to be provided for . You could not let your wife 's mother live in beggary . It will be a confoundedly hampering affair . Marriage will pin you down in a way you have n't been used to ; and in point of money you have not too much elbow - room . And after all , what will you get by it ? You are master over your estates , present or future , as far as choosing your heir goes ; it 's a pity to go on encumbering them for a mere whim , which you may repent of in a twelvemonth . I should be sorry to see you making a mess of your life in that way . If there were anything solid to be gained by the marriage , that would be a different affair . "
125413	125428	125401	125401	he	343	" I knew before that you had an objection to my marrying Miss Harleth . "
125439	125450	125430	125430	he	343	" But I never considered that a reason against it . "
125451	125458	125460	125460	Lush	343	" I never supposed you did , "
125467	125583	125460	125460	Lush	343	" It was not that I urged as a reason . I should have thought it might have been a reason against it , after all your experience , that you would be acting like the hero of a ballad , and making yourself absurd and all for what ? You know you could n't make up your mind before . It 's impossible you can care much about her . And as for the tricks she is likely to play , you may judge of that from what you heard at Leubronn . However , what I wished to point out to you was , that there can be no shilly - shally now . "
125584	125587	125589	125589	Grandcourt	485	" Perfectly , "
125602	125637	125589	125589	Grandcourt	485	" I do n't intend that there should be . I dare say it 's disagreeable to you . But if you suppose I care a damn for that you are most stupendously mistaken . "
125638	125643	125645	125645	Lush	343	" Oh , well , "
125664	125743	125645	125645	Lush	343	" if you have made up your mind ! only there 's another aspect of the affair . I have been speaking on the supposition that it was absolutely certain she would accept you , and that destitution would have no choice . But I am not so sure that the young lady is to be counted on . She is kittle cattle to shoe , I think . And she had her reasons for running away before . "
125838	125844	125845	125845	he	343	" She had her reasons , "
125850	125859	125861	125861	Grandcourt	485	" I had come to that conclusion before , "
125867	125881	125845	125845	he	343	" Yes , but I hardly think you know what her reasons were . "
125882	125888	125890	125890	Grandcourt	485	" You do , apparently , "
125907	125960	125845	125845	he	343	" Yes , and you had better know too , that you may judge of the influence you have over her if she swallows her reasons and accepts you . For my own part I would take odds against it . She saw Lydia in Cardell Chase and heard the whole story . "
126097	126101	126080	126080	Grandcourt	485	" What follows ? "
126106	126108	126105	126107	a " mate	9342	" mate "
126114	126117	126105	126107	a " mate	9342	" check : "
126187	126201	126171	126171	his	343	" Oblige me by pushing that pen and paper here , will you ? "
126265	126272	126262	126262	he	343	" Just wait for this letter . "
126286	126298	126300	126300	Grandcourt	485	" Let Hutchins go with it at once , will you ? "
126524	126536	126513	126513	Behold	487	" They 're fair , but I will none of them , "
126725	126762	126691	126691	his	343	" You will find an interest in varied experience , my dear , and I have no doubt you will be a more valuable woman for having sustained such a part as you are called to . "
126763	126776	126778	126778	Gwendolen	289	" I can not pretend to believe that I shall like it , "
126790	126804	126778	126778	Gwendolen	289	" But I am quite aware that I am obliged to bear it . "
126827	126841	126843	126844	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" And your good sense will teach you to behave suitably under it , "
126852	126921	126843	126844	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I feel sure that Mrs. Mompert will be pleased with you . You will know how to conduct yourself to a woman who holds in all senses the relation of a superior to you . This trouble has come on you young , but that makes it in some respects easier , and there is a benefit in all chastisement if we adjust our minds to it . "
127521	127556	127518	127518	She	289	" I have always , ever since I was little , felt that mamma was not a happy woman ; and now I dare say I shall be more unhappy than she has been . "
127597	127627	127594	127595	her mother	903	" Poor mamma ! it will be still worse for her now . I can get a little money for her that is all I shall care about now . "
127678	127687	127696	127696	she	289	" Poor Gwen too is sad and faded now "
127875	127882	127884	127884	Gwendolen	289	" It was nothing , mamma , "
127903	127910	127884	127884	Gwendolen	289	" It is all over now . "
127928	127938	127939	127939	she	289	" What is that letter ? worse news still ? "
127948	127961	127963	127964	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I do n't know what you will think it , dear , "
127973	127983	127963	127964	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You will hardly guess where it comes from . "
127984	127993	127995	127995	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't ask me to guess anything , "
128008	128017	127963	127964	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It is addressed to you , dear . "
128028	128034	128036	128037	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It comes from Diplow , "
128190	128198	128200	128201	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It must be answered , darling , "
128205	128210	128200	128201	Mrs. Davilow	330	" The man waits . "
128527	128536	128540	128540	she	289	" I wish I had never known it ! "
128578	128603	128570	128570	she	330	" It will be necessary for you to write , dear . Or shall I write an answer for you which you will dictate ? "
128604	128609	128611	128611	Gwendolen	289	" No , mamma , "
128618	128629	128611	128611	Gwendolen	289	" But please lay me out the pen and paper . "
128715	128740	128742	128742	Gwendolen	289	" There is really no reason on earth why you should be so alarmed at the man 's waiting a few minutes , mamma , "
128761	128784	128747	128748	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Servants expect nothing else than to wait . It is not to be supposed that I must write on the instant . "
128785	128790	128792	128793	Mrs. Davilow	330	" No , dear , "
128818	128832	128792	128793	Mrs. Davilow	330	" he can wait another quarter of an hour , if you like . "
128871	128888	128889	128889	she	289	" I did not mean him to wait long enough for that needlework to be finished , "
128914	128925	128927	128928	Mrs. Davilow	330	" But if you do n't feel able to decide ? "
128932	128937	128939	128939	Gwendolen	289	" I must decide , "
129049	129060	129062	129063	Mrs. Davilow	330	" If Mr. Grandcourt has only just returned from Leubronn , "
129080	129091	129062	129063	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I wonder whether he has heard of our misfortunes ? "
129092	129105	129107	129107	Gwendolen	289	" That could make no difference to a man in his position , "
129112	129119	129121	129122	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It would to some men , "
129124	129206	129121	129122	Mrs. Davilow	330	" They would not like to take a wife from a family in a state of beggary almost , as we are . Here we are at Offendene with a great shell over us , as usual . But just imagine his finding us at Sawyer 's Cottage . Most men are afraid of being bored or taxed by a wife 's family . If Mr. Grandcourt did know , I think it a strong proof of his attachment to you . "
129395	129417	129392	129392	She	330	" Miss Harleth presents her compliments to Mr. Grandcourt . She will be at home after two o'clock to - morrow . "
129425	129442	129422	129422	she	330	" Pray ring the bell , mamma , if there is any one to answer it . "
129504	129512	129499	129500	Mrs. Davilow	330	" What did you say , Gwen ? "
129513	129523	129525	129525	Gwendolen	289	" I said that I should be at home , "
129535	129556	129499	129500	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You must not expect , because Mr. Grandcourt is coming , that anything is going to happen , mamma . "
129557	129587	129499	129500	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I do n't allow myself to expect anything , dear . I desire you to follow your own feeling . You have never told me what that was . "
129588	129596	129598	129598	Gwendolen	289	" What is the use of telling ? "
129608	129626	129598	129598	Gwendolen	289	" When I have anything pleasant to tell , you may be sure I will tell you . "
129627	129662	129499	129500	Mrs. Davilow	330	" But Mr. Grandcourt will consider that you have already accepted him , in allowing him to come . His note tells you plainly enough that he is coming to make you an offer . "
129663	129678	129598	129598	Gwendolen	289	" Very well ; and I wish to have the pleasure of refusing him . "
129698	129719	129687	129687	Gwendolen	289	" Put down that detestable needle - work , and let us walk in the avenue . I am stifled . "
129790	129803	129805	129805	Gwendolen	289	" Only gather it up easily and make a coil , mamma , "
129807	129819	129821	129822	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Let me bring you some ear - rings , Gwen , "
129897	129904	129892	129892	her	1566	" You do want your earrings ? "
129905	129940	129942	129942	Gwendolen	289	" No , mamma ; I shall not wear any ornaments , and I shall put on my black silk . Black is the only wear when one is going to refuse an offer , "
129965	129975	129977	129978	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Suppose the offer is not made after all , "
129986	129997	129999	129999	Gwendolen	289	" Then that will be because I refuse it beforehand , "
130001	130009	129999	129999	Gwendolen	289	" It comes to the same thing . "
130065	130090	130061	130062	Her mother	903	" She is quite herself again . It must be pleasure in his coming . Can her mind be really made up against him ? "
130218	130224	130239	130239	Grandcourt	325	" God 's will be done "
130580	130589	130570	130570	She	289	" I will not interfere with your wishes . "
130703	130708	130710	130710	her	289	" Mamma managed baldly , "
130754	130771	130773	130773	Gwendolen	289	" I wonder what mamma and my uncle would say if they knew about Mrs. Glasher ! "
130798	130824	130773	130773	Gwendolen	289	" I wonder what anybody would say ; or what they would say to Mr. Grandcourt 's marrying some one else and having other children ! "
130828	130830	130773	130773	Gwendolen	289	" anybody "
130870	130872	130904	130904	she	289	" anybody "
130897	130899	130904	130904	she	289	" anybody "
131229	131233	131184	131184	Grandcourt	325	" poor mamma : "
131621	131632	131633	131633	he	325	" I was disappointed not to find you at Leubronn , "
131650	131671	131633	131633	he	325	" The place was intolerable without you . A mere kennel of a place . Do n't you think so ? "
131672	131684	131686	131686	Gwendolen	289	" I ca n't judge what it would be without myself , "
131701	131731	131686	131686	Gwendolen	289	" With myself I like it well enough to have stayed longer , if I could . But I was obliged to come home on account of family troubles . "
131732	131744	131746	131746	Grandcourt	325	" It was very cruel of you to go to Leubronn , "
131773	131805	131746	131746	Grandcourt	325	" You must have known that it would spoil everything : you knew you were the heart and soul of everything that went on . Are you quite reckless about me ? "
131812	131814	131757	131757	Gwendolen	289	" yes "
131828	131831	131757	131757	Gwendolen	289	" no ; "
131885	131919	131874	131874	he	325	" Perhaps there is some deeper interest ? Some attraction some engagement which it would have been only fair to make me aware of ? Is there any man who stands between us ? "
131926	131935	131939	131939	she	289	" No ; but there is a woman . "
131984	131996	131973	131973	she	289	" I perceive your intention it is most flattering , etc . "
132070	132082	132068	132068	Grandcourt	325	" Am I to understand that some one else is preferred ? "
132118	132120	132104	132104	her	289	" No "
132126	132139	132104	132104	her	289	" What then ? I may not be ready to take you . "
132158	132214	132104	132104	her	289	" The last thing I would do , is to importune you . I should not hope to win you by making myself a bore . If there were no hope for me , I would ask you to tell me so at once , that I might just ride away to no matter where . "
132267	132332	132255	132255	She	289	" I fear you are not aware of what has happened to us . I have lately had to think so much of my mamma 's troubles , that other subjects have been quite thrown into the background . She has lost all her fortune , and we are going to leave this place . I must ask you to excuse my seeming preoccupied . "
132598	132644	132578	132578	Grandcourt	325	" You will tell me now , I hope , that Mrs. Davilow 's loss of fortune will not trouble you further . You will trust me to prevent it from weighing upon her . You will give me the claim to provide against that . "
132798	132804	132805	132805	she	289	" You are very generous , "
132820	132833	132835	132835	Grandcourt	325	" You accept what will make such things a matter of course ? "
132842	132850	132835	132835	Grandcourt	325	" You consent to become my wife ? "
132961	132969	132959	132959	he	325	" Do you command me to go ? "
132982	132985	132987	132987	Gwendolen	289	" No , "
133034	133040	133042	133042	Grandcourt	325	" You accept my devotion ? "
133103	133106	133116	133116	she	289	" Yes , "
133159	133161	133193	133193	he	325	" Yes "
133242	133244	133241	133241	Her	289	" Yes "
133296	133308	133294	133294	she	289	" Will you not see mamma ? I will fetch her . "
133309	133316	133321	133321	his	325	" Let us wait a little , "
133370	133380	133382	133382	Gwendolen	289	" Have you anything else to say to me , "
133386	133400	133402	133402	Grandcourt	325	" Yes I know having things said to you is a great bore , "
133407	133418	133402	133402	Grandcourt	325	" Not when they are things I like to hear . "
133419	133434	133351	133351	Gwendolen	289	" Will it bother you to be asked how soon we can be married ? "
133435	133445	133447	133447	Gwendolen	289	" I think it will , to - day , "
133455	133489	133351	133351	Gwendolen	289	" Not to - day , then , but to - morrow . Think of it before I come to - morrow . In a fortnight or three weeks as soon as possible . "
133490	133503	133505	133505	Gwendolen	289	" Ah , you think you will be tired of my company , "
133507	133539	133505	133505	Gwendolen	289	" I notice when people are married the husband is not so much with his wife as when they are engaged . But perhaps I shall like that better , too . "
133544	133552	133554	133554	Grandcourt	325	" You shall have whatever you like , "
133556	133587	133589	133589	Gwendolen	289	" And nothing that I do n't like ? please say that ; because I think I dislike what I do n't like more than I like what I like , "
133622	133676	133606	133606	Grandcourt	325	" I do n't know this is such a brute of a world , things are always turning up that one does n't like . I ca n't always hinder your being bored . If you like to ride Criterion , I ca n't hinder his coming down by some chance or other . "
133677	133688	133606	133606	Grandcourt	325	" Ah , my friend Criterion , how is he ? "
133689	133730	133606	133606	Grandcourt	325	" He is outside : I made the groom ride him , that you might see him . He had the side - saddle on for an hour or two yesterday . Come to the window and look at him . "
133790	133799	133801	133801	Grandcourt	325	" Will you ride Criterion to - morrow ? "
133803	133813	133801	133801	Grandcourt	325	" If you will , everything shall be arranged . "
133814	133823	133825	133825	Gwendolen	289	" I should like it of all things , "
133827	133847	133825	133825	Gwendolen	289	" I want to lose myself in a gallop again . But now I must go and fetch mamma . "
133848	133858	133860	133860	Grandcourt	325	" Take my arm to the door , then , "
133939	133968	133923	133923	she	289	" Oh , while I think of it there is something I dislike that you can save me from . I do not like Mr. Lush 's company . "
133969	133983	133923	133923	she	289	" You shall not have it . I 'll get rid of him . "
133984	133993	133923	133923	she	289	" You are not fond of him yourself ? "
133994	134015	134017	134017	Grandcourt	325	" Not in the least . I let him hang on me because he has always been a poor devil , "
134026	134060	134017	134017	Grandcourt	325	" They got him to travel with me when I was a lad . He was always that coarse - haired kind of brute sort of cross between a hog and a dilettante . "
134147	134164	134127	134127	Gwendolen	289	" Come down , mamma , and see Mr. Grandcourt . I am engaged to him . "
134165	134170	134172	134173	Mrs. Davilow	330	" My darling child , "
134185	134188	134190	134190	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , "
134211	134252	134190	134190	Gwendolen	289	" Everything is settled . You are not going to Sawyer 's Cottage , I am not going to be inspected by Mrs. Mompert , and everything is to be as I like . So come down with me immediately . "
134263	134286	134339	134340	the rector	1395	" Il est plus aisť de conno tre l'homme en gťnťral que de conno tre un homme en particulier . LA ROCHEFOUCAULD . "
134322	134337	134339	134340	the rector	1395	" My dear , let me congratulate you on having created a strong attachment , "
134342	134402	134339	134340	the rector	1395	" You look serious , and I do n't wonder at it : a lifelong union is a solemn thing . But from the way Mr. Grandcourt has acted and spoken I think we may already see some good arising out of our adversity . It has given you an opportunity of observing your future husband 's delicate liberality . "
134439	134486	134488	134489	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" But I have no doubt that Mr. Grandcourt would have behaved quite as handsomely if you had not gone away to Germany , Gwendolen , and had been engaged to him , as you no doubt might have been , more than a month ago , "
134503	134552	134493	134493	she	230	" But now there is no more room for caprice ; indeed , I trust you have no inclination to any . A woman has a great debt of gratitude to a man who perseveres in making her such an offer . But no doubt you feel properly . "
134553	134566	134568	134568	Gwendolen	289	" I am not at all sure that I do , aunt , "
134574	134589	134568	134568	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't know everything it is proper to feel on being engaged . "
134632	134641	134626	134626	she	229	" I do hope you will be happy , "
134804	134809	134818	134819	the rector	1395	" Sir Charles Grandison . "
134865	134881	134883	134884	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I should like to know exactly what sort of places Ryelands and Gadsmere are , "
134886	134897	134899	134900	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Gadsmere , I believe , is a secondary place , "
134902	134993	134899	134900	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" But Ryelands I know to be one of our finest seats . The park is extensive and the woods of a very valuable order . The house was built by Inigo Jones , and the ceilings are painted in the Italian style . The estate is said to be worth twelve thousand a year , and there are two livings , one a rectory , in the gift of the Grandcourts . There may be some burdens on the land . Still , Mr. Grandcourt was an only child . "
134994	135001	135003	135004	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" It would be most remarkable , "
135006	135041	135042	135042	she	230	" if he were to become Lord Stannery in addition to everything else . Only think : there is the Grandcourt estate , the Mallinger estate , and the baronetcy , and the peerage , "
135061	135077	135058	135058	she	230	" but they say there will be no land coming to him with the peerage . "
135090	135094	135096	135097	the rector	1395	" The peerage , "
135101	135192	135096	135097	the rector	1395	" must be regarded as a remote chance . There are two cousins between the present peer and Mr. Grandcourt . It is certainly a serious reflection how death and other causes do sometimes concentrate inheritances on one man . But an excess of that kind is to be deprecated . To be Sir Mallinger Grandcourt Mallinger I suppose that will be his style with corresponding properties , is a valuable talent enough for any man to have committed to him . Let us hope it will be well used . "
135193	135204	135206	135207	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" And what a position for the wife , Gwendolen ! "
135209	135260	135206	135207	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" a great responsibility indeed . But you must lose no time in writing to Mrs. Mompert , Henry . It is a good thing that you have an engagement of marriage to offer as an excuse , else she might feel offended . She is rather a high woman . "
135261	135269	135271	135271	Gwendolen	289	" I am rid of that horror , "
135464	135474	135475	135475	she	289	" looking on darkness which the blind do see , "
135851	135854	135842	135842	She	289	" Mamma ! "
135855	135860	135862	135863	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Yes , dear , "
135872	135879	135842	135842	She	289	" Let me come to you . "
135928	135971	135914	135915	her mother	903	" I am sorry to wake you , darling , but I thought it better to give you this at once . The groom has brought Criterion ; he has come on another horse , and says he is to stay here . "
136112	136119	136121	136122	Mrs. Davilow	330	" How very kind and delicate ! "
136128	136157	136121	136122	Mrs. Davilow	330	" But I really should like better not to be dependent on a son - in - law . I and the girls could get along very well . "
136158	136173	136175	136175	Gwendolen	289	" Mamma , if you say that again , I will not marry him , "
136179	136197	136199	136200	Mrs. Davilow	330	" My dear child , I trust you are not going to marry only for my sake , "
136327	136338	136340	136341	Mrs. Davilow	330	" What I long for is your happiness , dear , "
136345	136363	136340	136341	Mrs. Davilow	330	" I will not say anything to vex you . Will you not put on the ring ? "
136415	136428	136429	136429	she	289	" I thought the lover always put on the betrothal ring himself , "
136452	136461	136462	136462	she	289	" I know why he has sent it , "
136470	136473	136462	136462	she	289	" Why ? "
136474	136533	136462	136462	she	289	" He would rather make me put it on than ask me to let him do it . Aha ! he is very proud . But so am I. We shall match each other . I should hate a man who went down on his knees , and came fawning on me . He really is not disgusting . "
136534	136543	136462	136462	she	289	" That is very moderate praise , Gwen . "
136544	136555	136557	136557	Gwendolen	289	" No , it is not , for a man , "
136560	136582	136583	136583	she	289	" But now I must get up and dress . Will you come and do my hair , mamma , dear , "
136601	136645	136583	136583	she	289	" and not be so naughty any more as to talk of living in poverty ? You must bear to be made comfortable , even if you do n't like it . And Mr. Grandcourt behaves perfectly , now , does he not ? "
136646	136651	136653	136654	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Certainly he does , "
136811	136886	136796	136796	she	289	" Of what use would it be to her that I should not marry him ? He could have married her if he liked ; but he did not like . Perhaps she is to blame for that . There must be a great deal about her that I know nothing of . And he must have been good to her in many ways , else she would not have wanted to marry him . "
136929	136983	136898	136899	Mrs. Glasher	364	" Perhaps we shall have no children . I hope we shall not . And he might leave the estate to the pretty little boy . My uncle said that Mr. Grandcourt could do as he liked with the estates . Only when Sir Hugo Mallinger dies there will be enough for two . "
137352	137365	137366	137366	she	364	" Go back and make yourself look like a duchess , mamma , "
137379	137405	137366	137366	she	364	" Put your point - lace over your head . I must have you look like a duchess . You must not take things humbly . "
137423	137440	137419	137419	she	364	" It was very good of you to think of everything and send me that packet . "
137441	137453	137454	137454	he	325	" You will tell me if there is anything I forget ? "
137465	137473	137454	137454	he	325	" I will do anything you wish . "
137474	137484	137486	137486	Gwendolen	289	" But I am very unreasonable in my wishes , "
137490	137501	137454	137454	he	325	" Yes , I expect that . Women always are . "
137502	137510	137512	137512	Gwendolen	289	" Then I will not be unreasonable , "
137524	137538	137512	137512	Gwendolen	289	" I will not be told that I am what women always are . "
137539	137546	137548	137548	Grandcourt	325	" I did not say that , "
137558	137567	137554	137554	his	325	" You are what no other woman is . "
137568	137576	137578	137578	Gwendolen	289	" And what is that , pray ? "
137599	137607	137596	137596	he	325	" You are the woman I love . "
137608	137615	137617	137617	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , what nice speeches ! "
137642	137659	137596	137596	he	325	" Give me a nice speech in return . Say when we are to be married . "
137660	137708	137709	137709	Gwendolen	289	" Not yet . Not till we have had a gallop over the downs . I am so thirsty for that , I can think of nothing else . I wish the hunting had begun . Sunday the twentieth , twenty - seventh , Monday , Tuesday . "
137739	137747	137735	137735	she	289	" It will begin in ten days ! "
137748	137759	137761	137761	Grandcourt	325	" Let us be married in ten days , then , "
137763	137774	137761	137761	Grandcourt	325	" and we shall not be bored about the stables . "
137775	137786	137788	137788	Gwendolen	289	" What do women always say in answer to that ? "
137792	137798	137800	137801	the lover	9455	" They agree to it , "
137808	137814	137816	137816	Gwendolen	289	" Then I will not ! "
138320	138330	138315	138315	Grandcourt	325	" And when is the marriage to take place ? "
138469	138474	138463	138463	he	325	" On the tenth . "
138475	138484	138463	138463	he	325	" I suppose you intend to remain here . "
138485	138508	138463	138463	he	325	" We shall go to Ryelands for a little while ; but we shall return here for the sake of the hunting . "
138559	138570	138522	138522	he	325	" You had better make some new arrangement for yourself . "
138571	138581	138583	138583	Lush	343	" What ! I am to cut and run ? "
138595	138601	138522	138522	he	325	" Something of that kind . "
138602	138624	138522	138522	he	325	" The bride objects to me . I hope she will make up to you for the want of my services . "
138625	138638	138640	138640	Grandcourt	325	" I ca n't help your being so damnably disagreeable to women , "
138646	138655	138640	138640	Grandcourt	325	" To one woman , if you please . "
138656	138669	138522	138522	he	325	" It makes no difference since she is the one in question . "
138670	138687	138640	138640	Grandcourt	325	" I suppose I am not to be turned adrift after fifteen years without some provision . "
138688	138698	138522	138522	he	325	" You must have saved something out of me . "
138699	138711	138640	138640	Grandcourt	325	" Deuced little . I have often saved something for you . "
138712	138746	138522	138522	he	325	" You can have three hundred a year . But you must live in town and be ready to look after things when I want you . I shall be rather hard up . "
138747	138774	138640	138640	Grandcourt	325	" If you are not going to be at Ryelands this winter , I might run down there and let you know how Swinton goes on . "
138775	138798	138522	138522	he	325	" If you like . I do n't care a toss where you are , so that you keep out of sight . "
138799	138803	138805	138805	Lush	343	" Much obliged , "
138841	138855	138857	138857	Grandcourt	325	" Perhaps you will not object to packing up as soon as possible , "
138859	138874	138857	138857	Grandcourt	325	" The Torringtons are coming , and Miss Harleth will be riding over here . "
138875	138892	138819	138819	He	343	" With all my heart . Ca n't I be of use in going to Gadsmere . "
138893	138901	138857	138857	Grandcourt	325	" No . I am going myself . "
138902	138916	138819	138819	He	343	" About your being rather hard up . Have you thought of that plan "
138917	138926	138928	138928	Grandcourt	325	" Just leave me alone , will you ? "
140414	140483	140397	140397	Deronda	289	" You see this fine young fellow not such as you see every day , is he ? he belongs to me in a sort of way . I brought him up from a child ; but you would not ticket him off easily , he has notions of his own , and he 's as far as the poles asunder from what I was at his age . "
140572	140618	140620	140621	Sir Hugo	209	" What do you say , Dan ? It would be pleasant enough for you . You have not seen the place for a good many years now , and you might have a famous run with the harriers if you went down next week , "
140623	140632	140634	140634	Deronda	289	" I should not go on that account , "
140679	140701	140668	140668	he	209	" I think Lush 's notion is a good one . And it would be a pity to lose the occasion . "
140702	140719	140721	140721	Deronda	289	" That is a different matter if you think my going of importance to your object , "
140747	140766	140768	140769	Sir Hugo	209	" Why , you will see the fair gambler , the Leubronn Diana , I should n't wonder , "
140773	140789	140790	140790	he	209	" We shall have to invite her to the Abbey , when they are married , "
140807	140816	140818	140819	Lady Mallinger	371	" I can not conceive whom you mean , "
140930	140960	141292	141293	Lady Mallinger	371	" I mean that Grandcourt is going to marry the girl you saw at Leubronn do n't you remember her the Miss Harleth who used to play at roulette . "
140961	140973	141292	141293	Lady Mallinger	371	" Dear me ! Is that a good match for him ? "
140974	140985	140987	140988	Sir Hugo	209	" That depends on the sort of goodness he wants , "
140992	141078	140987	140988	Sir Hugo	209	" However , she and her friends have nothing , and she will bring him expenses . It 's a good match for my purposes , because if I am willing to fork out a sum of money , he may be willing to give up his chance of Diplow , so that we shall have it out and out , and when I die you will have the consolation of going to the place you would like to go to wherever I may go . "
141079	141095	141292	141293	Lady Mallinger	371	" I wish you would not talk of dying in that light way , dear . "
141096	141121	140987	140988	Sir Hugo	209	" It 's rather a heavy way , Lou , for I shall have to pay a heavy sum forty thousand , at least . "
141122	141134	141136	141137	Lady Mallinger	371	" But why are we to invite them to the Abbey ? "
141139	141152	141136	141137	Lady Mallinger	371	" I do not like women who gamble , like Lady Cragstone . "
141153	141268	140987	140988	Sir Hugo	209	" Oh , you will not mind her for a week . Besides , she is not like Lady Cragstone because she gambled a little , any more than I am like a broker because I 'm a Whig . I want to keep Grandcourt in good humor , and to let him see plenty of this place , that he may think the less of Diplow . I do n't know yet whether I shall get him to meet me in this matter . And if Dan were to go over on a visit there , he might hold out the bait to him . It would be doing me a great service . "
141275	141290	141292	141293	Lady Mallinger	371	" Daniel is not fond of Mr. Grandcourt , I think , is he ? "
141300	141315	141317	141317	Deronda	197	" There is no avoiding everybody one does n't happen to be fond of , "
141319	141342	141317	141317	Deronda	197	" I will go to Diplow I do n't know that I have anything better to do since Sir Hugo wishes it . "
141343	141349	141351	141352	Sir Hugo	209	" That 's a trump ! "
141357	141393	141351	141352	Sir Hugo	209	" And if you do n't find it very pleasant , it 's so much experience . Nothing used to come amiss to me when I was young . You must see men and manners . "
141394	141411	141413	141413	Deronda	197	" Yes ; but I have seen that man , and something of his manners too , "
141415	141423	141425	141426	Lady Mallinger	371	" Not nice manners , I think , "
141428	141439	141441	141442	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , you see they succeed with your sex , "
141446	141504	141441	141442	Sir Hugo	209	" And he was an uncommonly good - looking fellow when he was two or three and twenty like his father . He does n't take after his father in marrying the heiress , though . If he had got Miss Arrowpoint and my land too , confound him , he would have had a fine principality . "
142083	142118	142119	142120	WALT WHITMAN	505	" Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice , him or her I shall follow . As the water follows the moon , silently , with fluid steps anywhere around the globe . "
142122	142130	142132	142132	Grandcourt	325	" Now my cousins are at Diplow , "
142134	142188	142132	142132	Grandcourt	325	" will you go there ? to - morrow ? The carriage shall come for Mrs. Davilow . You can tell me what you would like done in the rooms . Things must be put in decent order while we are away at Ryelands . And to - morrow is the only day . "
142512	142522	142506	142506	him	325	" I beg your pardon did I annoy you ? "
142523	142530	142532	142532	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , it was nothing , "
142539	142552	142532	142532	Gwendolen	289	" only I can not bear to be kissed under my ear . "
142685	142695	142668	142668	She	289	" Why is to - morrow the only day ? "
142696	142708	142710	142710	Grandcourt	325	" Because the next day is the first with the hounds , "
142712	142717	142668	142668	She	289	" And after that ? "
142718	142746	142747	142747	Grandcourt	325	" After that I must go away for a couple of days it 's a bore but I shall go one day and come back the next . "
142773	142781	142764	142764	he	325	" You object to my going away ? "
142782	142789	142791	142791	Gwendolen	289	" It 's no use objecting , "
142826	142831	142833	142833	Grandcourt	325	" Yes it is , "
142839	142862	142833	142833	Grandcourt	325	" I will put off going . And I will travel at night , so as only to be away one day . "
142891	142904	142906	142906	Gwendolen	289	" Then do n't put off going , but travel at night , "
142927	142938	142910	142910	she	289	" Then you will go to Diplow to - morrow ? "
142939	142949	142951	142951	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , yes , if you wish it , "
142980	142990	142995	142995	his	325	" How you treat us poor devils of men ! "
142998	143008	142995	142995	his	325	" We are always getting the worst of it . "
143009	143013	143015	143015	Gwendolen	289	" Are you ? "
143069	143077	143060	143061	Mrs. Glasher	364	" Are you always getting the worst ? "
143078	143093	143095	143095	Grandcourt	325	" Yes . Are you as kind to me as I am to you ? "
143283	143320	143281	143281	she	289	" If I were as kind to you as you are to me , that would spoil your generosity : it would no longer be as great as it could be and it is that now . "
143321	143332	143334	143334	Grandcourt	325	" Then I am not to ask for one kiss , "
143359	143363	143365	143365	Gwendolen	289	" Not one ? "
143445	143448	143449	143449	she	289	" Apropos , "
143458	143496	143449	143449	she	289	" is there any one besides Captain and Mrs. Torrington at Diplow ? or do you leave them tete - a - tete ? I suppose he converses in cigars , and she answers with her chignon . "
143497	143505	143507	143507	Grandcourt	325	" She has a sister with her , "
143516	143532	143510	143510	his	325	" and there are two men besides one of them you know , I believe . "
143533	143546	143551	143551	her	289	" Ah , then , I have a poor opinion of him , "
143554	143569	143570	143570	Gwendolen	289	" You saw him at Leubronn young Deronda a young fellow with the Mallingers . "
143600	143607	143608	143608	she	289	" I never spoke to him , "
143618	143624	143608	143608	she	289	" Is he not disagreeable ? "
143625	143631	143636	143636	his	325	" No , not particularly , "
143641	143660	143636	143636	his	325	" He thinks a little too much of himself . I thought he had been introduced to you . "
143661	143685	143608	143608	she	289	" No . Some one told me his name the evening before I came away . That was all . What is he ? "
143686	143702	143636	143636	his	325	" A sort of ward of Sir Hugo Mallinger 's . Nothing of any consequence . "
143703	143715	143717	143717	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , poor creature ! How very unpleasant for him ! "
143730	143740	143741	143741	she	289	" I wonder if it has left off raining ! "
144031	144047	144027	144027	Grandcourt	325	" Deronda , Miss Harleth tells me you were not introduced to her at Leubronn ? "
144048	144058	144060	144060	Deronda	289	" Miss Harleth hardly remembers me , I imagine , "
144072	144082	144060	144060	Deronda	289	" She was intensely occupied when I saw her . "
144103	144114	144116	144116	Gwendolen	289	" On the contrary . I remember you very well , "
144135	144146	144124	144124	herself	289	" You did not approve of my playing at roulette . "
144147	144156	144158	144158	Deronda	289	" How did you come to that conclusion ? "
144162	144174	144176	144176	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , you cast an evil eye on my play , "
144188	144210	144182	144182	her	289	" I began to lose as soon as you came to look on . I had always been winning till then . "
144211	144224	144226	144226	Grandcourt	325	" Roulette in such a kennel as Leubronn is a horrid bore , "
144228	144240	144242	144242	Gwendolen	289	" I found it a bore when I began to lose , "
144622	144679	144612	144612	she	289	" I wonder what he thinks of me , really ? He must have felt interested in me , else he would not have sent me my necklace . I wonder what he thinks of my marriage ? What notions has he to make him so grave about things ? Why is he come to Diplow ? "
144731	144736	144719	144719	she	289	" nothing of any consequence "
144792	144803	144767	144767	she	289	" Shall you hunt to - morrow , Mr. Deronda ? "
144804	144811	144767	144767	she	289	" Yes , I believe so . "
144812	144822	144767	144767	she	289	" You do n't object to hunting , then ? "
144823	144847	144767	144767	she	289	" I find excuses for it . It is a sin I am inclined to when I ca n't get boating or cricketing . "
144848	144856	144858	144858	Gwendolen	289	" Do you object to my hunting ? "
144868	144882	144767	144767	she	289	" I have no right to object to anything you choose to do . "
144883	144896	144898	144898	Gwendolen	289	" You thought you had a right to object to my gambling , "
144900	144919	144921	144921	Deronda	289	" I was sorry for it . I am not aware that I told you of my objection , "
145028	145036	145037	145037	she	289	" You hindered me from gambling again , "
145207	145230	145203	145204	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Was it really so , or only a joke of yours , about Mr. Deronda 's spoiling your play , Gwen ? "
145252	145269	145271	145271	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , it merely happened that he was looking on when I began to lose , "
145275	145280	145271	145271	Gwendolen	289	" I noticed him . "
145281	145322	145365	145365	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't wonder at that : he is a striking young man . He puts me in mind of Italian paintings . One would guess , without being told , that there was foreign blood in his veins . "
145323	145327	145329	145329	Gwendolen	289	" Is there ? "
145331	145358	145365	145365	Gwendolen	289	" Mrs. Torrington says so . I asked particularly who he was , and she told me that his mother was some foreigner of high rank . "
145359	145363	145365	145365	Gwendolen	289	" His mother ? "
145370	145377	145365	145365	Gwendolen	289	" Then who was his father ? "
145378	145438	145365	145365	Gwendolen	289	" Well every one says he is the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger , who brought him up ; though he passes for a ward . She says , if Sir Hugo Mallinger could have done as he liked with his estates , he would have left them to this Mr. Deronda , since he has no legitimate son . "
145579	145582	145561	145569	A dark - eyed woman , no longer young	3838	" to Gwendolen .
145604	145616	145602	145602	she	289	" Mamma , have men generally children before they are married ? "
145617	145624	145626	145627	Mrs. Davilow	330	" No , dear , no , "
145629	145638	145626	145627	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Why do you ask such a question ? "
145650	145661	145663	145663	Gwendolen	289	" If it were so , I ought to know , "
145669	145694	145645	145645	she	289	" You are thinking of what I said about Mr. Deronda and Sir Hugo Mallinger . That is a very unusual case , dear . "
145695	145701	145645	145645	she	289	" Does Lady Mallinger know ? "
145702	145723	145645	145645	she	289	" She knows enough to satisfy her . That is quite clear , because Mr. Deronda has lived with them . "
145724	145733	145645	145645	she	289	" And people think no worse of him ? "
145734	145796	145645	145645	she	289	" Well , of course he is under some disadvantage : it is not as if he were Lady Mallinger 's son . He does not inherit the property , and he is not of any consequence in the world . But people are not obliged to know anything about his birth ; you see , he is very well received . "
145797	145815	145645	145645	she	289	" I wonder whether he knows about it ; and whether he is angry with his father ? "
145816	145828	145645	145645	she	289	" My dear child , why should you think of that ? "
145829	145832	145834	145834	Gwendolen	289	" Why ? "
145844	145867	145834	145834	Gwendolen	289	" Have n't children reason to be angry with their parents ? How can they help their parents marrying or not marrying ? "
146525	146532	146492	146492	she	364	" How can I help it ? "
146548	146581	146542	146542	Gwendolen	289	" How can I help what other people have done ? Things would not come right if I were to turn round now and declare that I would not marry Mr. Grandcourt . "
147085	147097	147071	147071	she	364	" Go on ! I want to speak to Mr. Deronda . "
147174	147206	147162	147162	she	364	" Mr. Deronda , you must enlighten my ignorance . I want to know why you thought it wrong for me to gamble . Is it because I am a woman ? "
147207	147223	147225	147225	Deronda	289	" Not altogether ; but I regretted it the more because you were a woman , "
147249	147376	147377	147377	Deronda	289	" I think it would be better for men not to gamble . It is a besotting kind of taste , likely to turn into a disease . And , besides , there is something revolting to me in raking a heap of money together , and internally chuckling over it , when others are feeling the loss of it . I should even call it base , if it were more than an exceptional lapse . There are enough inevitable turns of fortune which force us to see that our gain is another 's loss : that is one of the ugly aspects of life . One would like to reduce it as much as one could , not get amusement out of exaggerating it . "
147389	147401	147403	147403	Gwendolen	289	" But you do admit that we ca n't help things , "
147424	147450	147467	147467	Gwendolen	289	" I mean that things are so in spite of us ; we ca n't always help it that our gain is another 's loss . "
147451	147466	147467	147467	Gwendolen	289	" Clearly . Because of that , we should help it where we can . "
147492	147506	147481	147481	herself	289	" But why should you regret it more because I am a woman ? "
147507	147521	147467	147467	Gwendolen	289	" Perhaps because we need that you should be better than we are . "
147522	147536	147538	147538	Gwendolen	289	" But suppose we need that men should be better than we are , "
147544	147547	147538	147538	Gwendolen	289	" check ! "
147548	147555	147557	147557	Deronda	289	" That is rather a difficulty , "
147561	147585	147557	147557	Deronda	289	" I suppose I should have said , we each of us think it would be better for the other to be good . "
147586	147604	147606	147606	Gwendolen	289	" You see , I needed you to be better than I was and you thought so , "
147627	147643	147645	147645	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't you want to know what I had to say to Mr. Deronda ? "
147658	147662	147664	147664	Grandcourt	325	" A no , "
147668	147692	147694	147694	Gwendolen	289	" Now that is the first impolite word you have spoken that you do n't wish to hear what I had to say , "
147701	147716	147718	147718	Grandcourt	325	" I wish to hear what you say to me not to other men , "
147720	147750	147772	147772	he	325	" Then you wish to hear this . I wanted to make him tell me why he objected to my gambling , and he gave me a little sermon . "
147751	147759	147761	147761	Gwendolen	289	" Yes but excuse me the sermon . "
148886	148888	148865	148865	she	364	" mamma "
149878	149901	149858	149858	she	363	" If you ever marry another woman I will give them up to her : are you going to marry another woman ? "
150424	150428	150417	150417	herself	364	" How changed ! "
150533	150545	150524	150524	her	364	" Hush , dear ! I think some one is coming . "
150554	150565	150546	150546	Henleigh	325	" Mamma , is it the miller with my donkey ? "
150728	150735	150737	150738	Mrs. Glasher	364	" How far are you come ? "
150749	150753	150754	150754	he	325	" From Diplow , "
150774	150781	150771	150771	she	364	" You are tired , then . "
150782	150810	150771	150771	she	364	" No , I rested at the Junction a hideous hole . These railway journeys are always a confounded bore . But I had coffee and smoked . "
150923	150954	150959	150959	She	364	" I expected to see you it was so long since I had heard from you . I suppose the weeks seem longer at Gadsmere than they do at Diplow , "
150989	150992	150994	150994	Grandcourt	325	" Yes , "
150996	151007	150994	150994	Grandcourt	325	" But you found the money paid into the bank . "
151008	151013	151015	151016	Mrs. Glasher	364	" Oh , yes , "
151048	151051	151052	151052	he	325	" Yes , "
151068	151100	151102	151102	he	325	" the time has gone on at rather a rattling pace with me ; generally it is slow enough . But there has been a good deal happening , as you know "
151109	151115	151117	151117	she	364	" What do I know ? "
151134	151147	151126	151126	he	325	" That I was thinking of marrying . You saw Miss Harleth ? "
151148	151154	151126	151126	he	325	" She told you that ? "
151173	151180	151126	151126	he	325	" No . Lush told me , "
151211	151226	151227	151227	she	364	" Good God ! say at once that you are going to marry her , "
151242	151259	151261	151261	he	325	" Of course , this kind of thing must happen some time or other , Lydia , "
151281	151290	151261	151261	he	325	" You did n't always see the necessity . "
151291	151300	151261	151261	he	325	" Perhaps not . I see it now . "
151596	151626	151587	151587	She	364	" All this is of no consequence to you . I and the children are importunate creatures . You wish to get away again and be with Miss Harleth . "
151627	151706	151587	151587	She	364	" Do n't make the affair more disagreeable than it need be . Lydia . It is of no use to harp on things that ca n't be altered . Of course , its deucedly disagreeable to me to see you making yourself miserable . I 've taken this journey to tell you what you must make up your mind to you and the children will be provided for as usual and there 's an end of it . "
151782	151858	151779	151779	he	4006	" It will be better for you . You may go on living here . But I think of by - and - by settling a good sum on you and the children , and you can live where you like . There will be nothing for you to complain of then . Whatever happens , you will feel secure . Nothing could be done beforehand . Every thing has gone on in a hurry . "
151907	151932	151905	151905	he	4006	" You have never had any reason to fear that I should be illiberal . I do n't care a curse about the money . "
151933	151950	151952	151952	Lydia	363	" If you did care about it , I suppose you would not give it us , "
151959	151969	151970	151970	Grandcourt	325	" That 's a devilishly unfair thing to say , "
151978	151992	151970	151970	Grandcourt	325	" and I advise you not to say that sort of thing again . "
151993	152005	152009	152009	herself	364	" Should you punish me by leaving the children in beggary ? "
152021	152033	152035	152035	Grandcourt	325	" There is no question about leaving the children in beggary , "
152043	152057	152039	152039	his	325	" I advise you not to say things that you will repent of . "
152058	152065	152067	152067	she	363	" I am used to repenting , "
152071	152085	152067	152067	she	363	" Perhaps you will repent . You have already repented of loving me . "
152086	152108	152039	152039	his	325	" All this will only make it uncommonly difficult for us to meet again . What friend have you besides me ? "
152109	152113	152067	152067	she	363	" Quite true . "
152636	152654	152623	152623	his	325	" There is one thing I had to mention , Lydia . My diamonds you have them . "
152655	152662	152663	152663	she	364	" Yes , I have them , "
152735	152745	152719	152719	she	364	" They are in this house , I suppose ? "
152746	152754	152699	152699	she	364	" No ; not in this house . "
152755	152766	152719	152719	she	364	" I thought you said you kept them by you . "
152767	152784	152699	152699	she	364	" When I said so it was true . They are in the bank at Dudley . "
152785	152806	152719	152719	she	364	" Get them away , will you ? I must make an arrangement for your delivering them to some one . "
152807	152830	152699	152699	she	364	" Make no arrangement . They shall be delivered to the person you intended them for . I will make the arrangement . "
152831	152837	152719	152719	she	364	" What do you mean ? "
152838	152871	152699	152699	she	364	" What I say . I have always told you that I would give them up to your wife . I shall keep my word . She is not your wife yet . "
152872	152877	152879	152879	Grandcourt	325	" This is foolery , "
152935	152947	152948	152948	he	325	" The diamonds must be delivered to me before my marriage , "
152952	152960	152948	152948	he	325	" What is your wedding - day ? "
152961	152973	152996	152996	he	325	" The tenth . There is no time to be lost . "
152974	152984	152948	152948	he	325	" And where do you go after the marriage ? "
152999	153034	152996	152996	he	325	" You must appoint a day before then , to get them from the bank and meet me or somebody else I will commission ; it 's a great nuisance , Mention a day . "
153035	153058	152948	152948	he	325	" No ; I shall not do that . They shall be delivered to her safely . I shall keep my word . "
153059	153066	153068	153068	Grandcourt	325	" Do you mean to say , "
153078	153089	153068	153068	Grandcourt	325	" that you will not do as I tell you ? "
153090	153097	153106	153106	her	363	" Yes , I mean that , "
153263	153270	153247	153247	he	325	" Infernal idiots that women are ! "
153271	153302	153304	153304	Lydia	363	" Why will you not tell me where you are going after the marriage ? I could be at the wedding if I liked , and learn in that way , "
153319	153334	153336	153336	Grandcourt	325	" Of course , if you like , you can play the mad woman , "
153343	153369	153336	153336	Grandcourt	325	" It is not to be supposed that you will wait to think what good will come of it or what you owe to me . "
153704	153715	153716	153716	she	4024	" Do n't let us part in anger , Henleigh , "
153726	153807	153808	153808	she	4024	" it is a very little thing I ask . If I were refusing to give anything up that you call yours it would be different : that would be a reason for treating me as if you hated me . But I ask such a little thing . If you will tell me where you are going on the wedding - day I will take care that the diamonds shall be delivered to her without scandal . Without scandal , "
153812	153821	153823	153823	Grandcourt	325	" Such preposterous whims make a woman odious , "
153833	153844	153823	153823	Grandcourt	325	" What is the use of talking to mad people ? "
153845	153859	153863	153863	she	4024	" Yes , I am foolish loneliness has made me foolish indulge me . "
153866	153887	153888	153888	She	4024	" If you will indulge me in this one folly I will be very meek I will never trouble you . "
153901	153910	153888	153888	She	4024	" I will be very meek after that . "
154024	154050	154007	154007	He	325	" Be quiet , and hear what I tell you , I will never forgive you if you present yourself again and make a scene . "
154075	154187	154061	154061	she	4024	" I will not if you will let me have my way I promise you not to thrust myself forward again . I have never broken my word to you how many have you broken to me ? When you gave me the diamonds to wear you were not thinking of having another wife . And I now give them up I do n't reproach you I only ask you to let me give them up in my own way . Have I not borne it well ? Everything is to be taken away from me , and when I ask for a straw , a chip you deny it me . "
154211	154222	154198	154198	she	4033	" I will not bear to have it denied me . "
154266	154274	154262	154262	Grandcourt	325	" We are going to Ryelands then . "
154275	154284	154286	154286	Lydia	363	" They shall be delivered to her there , "
154291	154299	154300	154300	He	325	" Very well , I am going . "
154338	154349	154350	154350	she	363	" Forgive me ; I will never vex you again , "
154362	154372	154357	154357	Her	363	" It is only I who have to forgive . "
154381	154400	154402	154402	Grandcourt	325	" You had better keep that promise . You have made me feel uncommonly ill with your folly , "
154416	154420	154422	154422	Lydia	363	" Poor thing ! "
154516	154521	154522	154522	she	363	" Light a cigar , "

154932	154996	154928	154929	her mother	903	" Oh , child , men 's men : gentle or simple , they 're much of a muchness . I 've heard my mother say Squire Pelton used to take his dogs and a long whip into his wife 's room , and flog 'em there to frighten her ; and my mother was lady's - maid there at the very time . "
154997	155009	155011	155012	the tailor	4062	" That 's unlucky talk for a wedding , Mrs. Girdle , "
155014	155045	155011	155012	the tailor	4062	" A quarrel may end wi ' the whip , but it begins wi ' the tongue , and it 's the women have got the most o ' that . "
155046	155058	155060	155061	Mrs. Girdle	515	" The Lord gave it 'em to use , I suppose , "
155063	155076	155060	155061	Mrs. Girdle	515	" He never meant you to have it all your own way . "
155077	155095	155097	155098	the tailor	4062	" By what I can make out from the gentleman as attends to the grooming at Offendene , "
155100	155120	155097	155098	the tailor	4062	" this Mr. Grandcourt has wonderful little tongue . Everything must be done dummy - like without his ordering . "
155121	155132	155134	155135	Mrs. Girdle	515	" Then he 's the more whip , I doubt , "
155137	155156	155134	155135	Mrs. Girdle	515	" She 's got tongue enough , I warrant her . See , there they come out together ! "
155157	155169	155171	155172	the tailor	4062	" What wonderful long corners she 's got to her eyes ! "
155174	155186	155171	155172	the tailor	4062	" She makes you feel comical when she looks at you . "
155698	155710	155716	155716	she	330	" Thank God you bear it so well , my darling ! "
155760	155787	155789	155789	Gwendolen	289	" Why , you might have said that , if I had been going to Mrs. Mompert 's , you dear , sad , incorrigible mamma ! "
155817	155859	155815	155815	herself	289	" Here am I Mrs. Grandcourt ! what else would you have me , but what I am sure to be ? You know you were ready to die with vexation when you thought that I would not be Mrs. Grandcourt . "
155860	155873	155875	155876	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Hush , hush , my child , for heaven 's sake ! "
155883	155908	155875	155876	Mrs. Davilow	330	" How can I help feeling it when I am parting from you . But I can bear anything gladly if you are happy . "
155909	155917	155922	155922	her	289	" Not gladly , mamma , no ! "
155930	155953	155922	155922	her	289	" Willingly you would bear it , but always sorrowfully . Sorrowing is your sauce ; you can take nothing without it . "
155982	156038	155977	155977	she	289	" And you shall sorrow over my having everything at my beck -and enjoying everything glorious splendid houses and horses and diamonds , I shall have diamonds and going to court and being Lady Certainly and Lady Perhaps and grand here and tantivy there and always loving you better than anybody else in the world . "
156039	156065	156121	156121	she	289	" My sweet child ! But I shall not be jealous if you love your husband better ; and he will expect to be first . "
156080	156102	156069	156069	her	289	" Rather a ridiculous expectation . However , I do n't mean to treat him ill , unless he deserves it . "
156124	156135	156121	156121	she	289	" I wish you were going with me , mamma . "
156174	156191	156164	156165	The rector	1395	" Good - bye ; God bless you ; we shall see you again before long , "
156205	156256	156196	156197	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Let us be thankful , Fanny . She is in a position well suited to her , and beyond what I should have dared to hope for . And few women can have been chosen more entirely for their own sake . You should feel yourself a happy mother . "
156521	156676	156520	156520	somebody	7901	" walking through her own furlong of corridor and under her own ceilings of an out - of - sight loftiness , where her own painted Spring was shedding painted flowers , and her own fore - shortened Zephyrs were blowing their trumpets over her ; while her own servants , lackeys in clothing but men in bulk and shape , were as nought in her presence , and revered the propriety of her insolence to them : being in short the heroine of an admired play without the pains of art ? Was it alone the closeness of this fulfilment which made her heart flutter ? or was it some dim forecast , the insistent penetration of suppressed experience , mixing the expectation of a triumph with the dread of a crisis ? Hers was one of the natures in which exultation inevitably carries an infusion of dread ready to curdle and declare itself .
156696	156703	156692	156693	her husband	1088	" Here we are at home ! "
156884	156890	156892	156892	Grandcourt	485	" These are our dens , "
156894	156910	156892	156892	Grandcourt	485	" You will like to be quiet here till dinner . We shall dine early . "
157013	157040	156995	156999	the new mistress of Ryelands	4106	" Will you tell Hudson when she has put out my dress to leave everything ? I shall not want her again , unless I ring . "
157049	157120	157041	157042	The housekeeper	1053	" Here is a packet , madam , which I was ordered to give into nobody 's hands but yours , when you were alone . The person who brought it said it was a present particularly ordered by Mr. Grandcourt ; but he was not to know of its arrival till he saw you wear it . Excuse me , madam ; I felt it right to obey orders . "
158120	158135	158137	158138	Sir Hugo	209	" And what did you think of the future bride on a nearer survey ? "
158140	158197	158137	158138	Sir Hugo	209	" I thought better of her than I did in Leubronn . Roulette was not a good setting for her ; it brought out something of the demon . At Diplow she seemed much more womanly and attractive less hard and self - possessed . I thought her mouth and eyes had quite a different expression . "
158198	158209	158211	158212	Sir Hugo	209	" Do n't flirt with her too much , Dan , "
158220	158242	158211	158212	Sir Hugo	209	" If you make Grandcourt savage when they come to the Abbey at Christmas , it will interfere with my affairs . "
158243	158252	158137	158138	Sir Hugo	209	" I can stay in town , sir . "
158253	158298	158211	158212	Sir Hugo	209	" No , no . Lady Mallinger and the children ca n't do without you at Christmas . Only do n't make mischief unless you can get up a duel , and manage to shoot Grandcourt , which might be worth a little inconvenience . "
158299	158310	158312	158312	Deronda	197	" I do n't think you ever saw me flirt , "
158317	158326	158328	158329	Sir Hugo	209	" Oh , have n't I , though ? "
158333	158377	158328	158329	Sir Hugo	209	" You are always looking tenderly at the women , and talking to them in a Jesuitical way . You are a dangerous young fellow a kind of Lovelace who will make the Clarissas run after you instead of you running after them . "
158561	158571	158572	158572	she	418	" We are getting fonder of her every day , "
158576	158745	158572	158572	she	418	" At breakfast - time we all look toward the door with expectation to see her come in ; and we watch her and listen to her as if she were a native from a new country . I have not heard a word from her lips that gives me a doubt about her . She is quite contented and full of gratitude . My daughters are learning from her , and they hope to get her other pupils ; for she is anxious not to eat the bread of idleness , but to work , like my girls . Mab says our life has become like a fairy tale , and all she is afraid of is that Mirah will turn into a nightingale again and fly away from us . Her voice is just perfect : not loud and strong , but searching and melting , like the thoughts of what has been . That is the way old people like me feel a beautiful voice . "
158837	158863	158821	158821	Amy	423	" Excuse me , Mirah , but does it seem quite right to you that the women should sit behind rails in a gallery apart ? "
158864	158874	158876	158876	Mirah	289	" Yes , I never thought of anything else , "
158882	158896	158898	158898	Mab	424	" And you like better to see the men with their hats on ? "
158908	158945	158821	158821	Amy	423	" Oh , yes . I like what I have always seen there , because it brings back to me the same feelings the feelings I would not part with for anything else in the world . "
158994	159015	159017	159017	Amy	423	" She says herself she is a very bad Jewess , and does not half know her people 's religion , "
159026	159077	159017	159017	Amy	423	" Perhaps it would gradually melt away from her , and she would pass into Christianity like the rest of the world , if she got to love us very much , and never found her mother . It is so strange to be of the Jews ' religion now . "
159078	159085	159087	159087	Mab	424	" Oh , oh , oh ! "
159089	159124	159087	159087	Mab	424	" I wish I were not such a hideous Christian . How can an ugly Christian , who is always dropping her work , convert a beautiful Jewess , who has not a fault ? "
159125	159133	159135	159136	shrewd Kate	422	" It may be wicked of me , "
159138	159159	159135	159136	shrewd Kate	422	" but I can not help wishing that her mother may not be found . There might be something unpleasant . "
159160	159170	159172	159173	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I do n't think it , my dear , "
159175	159219	159220	159220	she	418	" I believe Mirah is cut out after the pattern of her mother . And what a joy it would be to her to have such a daughter brought back again ! But a mother 's feelings are not worth reckoning , I suppose "
159230	159243	159220	159220	she	418	" and a dead mother is worth more that a living one ? "
159244	159256	159258	159258	Kate	422	" Well , and so she may be , little mother , "
159260	159274	159258	159258	Kate	422	" but we would rather hold you cheaper , and have you alive . "
161033	161040	161022	161022	his	4133	" nicht so leicht zu bekommen . "
161782	161853	161773	161773	he	4133	" Happy the eye which saw all these things ; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul . Happy the eye that saw our temple and the joy of our congregation ; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul . Happy the eye that saw the fingers when tuning every kind of song ; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul . "
161982	162002	161972	161980	that neighbor , who said to him in German	4211	" Excuse me , young gentleman allow me what is your parentage your mother 's family her maiden name ? "
162034	162040	162024	162024	he	4133	" I am an Englishman . "
162521	162531	162540	162540	her	289	" peace on earth and good will to men , "
162562	162589	162559	162559	their	4228	" See how different I am from the miserable creature by the river ! all because you found me and brought me to the very best . "
162590	162600	162602	162602	Deronda	289	" It was my good chance to find you , "
162604	162618	162602	162602	Deronda	289	" Any other man would have been glad to do what I did . "
162619	162632	162634	162634	Mirah	289	" That is not the right way to be thinking about it , "
162643	162668	162637	162637	her	289	" I think of what really was . It was you , and not another , who found me and were good to me . "
162669	162675	162677	162678	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I agree with Mirah , "
162680	162691	162677	162678	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Saint Anybody is a bad saint to pray to . "
162692	162704	162706	162706	Mirah	289	" Besides , Anybody could not have brought me to you , "
162713	162804	162805	162805	She	289	" And I would rather be with you than with any one else in the world except my mother . I wonder if ever a poor little bird , that was lost and could not fly , was taken and put into a warm nest where was a mother and sisters who took to it so that everything came naturally , as if it had been always there . I hardly thought before that the world could ever be as happy and without fear as it is to me now . "
162823	162823	162805	162805	She	289	"
162824	162833	162835	162835	Deronda	289	" What is it you are afraid of ? "
162839	162875	162877	162877	Mirah	289	" That when I am turning at the corner of a street I may meet my father . It seems dreadful that I should be afraid of meeting him . That is my only sorrow , "
162881	162889	162891	162891	Deronda	289	" It is surely not very probable , "
162908	162927	162948	162948	she	289	" Would it be a great grief to you now if you were never to meet your mother ? "
162967	163105	162948	162948	she	289	" I want her to know that I have always loved her , and if she is alive I want to comfort her . She may be dead . If she were I should long to know where she was buried ; and to know whether my brother lives , so that we can remember her together . But I will try not to grieve . I have thought much for so many years of her being dead . And I shall have her with me in my mind , as I have always had . We can never be really parted . I think I have never sinned against her . I have always tried not to do what would hurt her . Only , she might be sorry that I was not a good Jewess . "
163106	163117	163119	163119	Deronda	289	" In what way are you not a good Jewess ? "
163121	163259	162948	162948	she	289	" I am ignorant , and we never observed the laws , but lived among Christians just as they did . But I have heard my father laugh at the strictness of the Jews about their food and all customs , and their not liking Christians . I think my mother was strict ; but she could never want me not to like those who are better to me than any of my own people I have ever known . I think I could obey in other things that she wished but not in that . It is so much easier to me to share in love than in hatred . I remember a play I read in German since I have been here it has come into my mind where the heroine says something like that . "
163260	163263	163265	163265	Deronda	289	" Antigone , "
163267	163299	162948	162948	she	289	" Ah , you know it . But I do not believe that my mother would wish me not to love my best friends . She would be grateful to them . "
163322	163366	163319	163319	she	289	" Oh , if we ever do meet and know each other as we are now , so that I could tell what would comfort her I should be so full of blessedness my soul would know no want but to love her ! "
163367	163374	163376	163377	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" God bless you , child ! "
163402	163490	163395	163395	she	418	" It is curious that Mirah , who remembers her mother so well it is as if she saw her , can not recall her brother the least bit except the feeling of having been carried by him when she was tired , and of his being near her when she was in her mother 's lap . It must be that he was rarely at home . He was already grown up . It is a pity her brother should be quite a stranger to her . "
163491	163503	163505	163505	Mirah	289	" He is good ; I feel sure Ezra is good , "
163509	163553	163505	163505	Mirah	289	" He loved my mother he would take care of her . I remember more of him than that . I remember my mother 's voice once calling , ' Ezra ! ' and then his answering from a distance ' Mother ! ' "
163573	163597	163557	163557	her	289	" and then he came close to us . I feel sure he is good . I have always taken comfort from that . "
163640	163678	163632	163632	Mirah	289	" Is it not wonderful how I remember the voices better than anything else ? I think they must go deeper into us than other things . I have often fancied heaven might be made of voices . "
163679	163685	163687	163687	Mab	424	" Like your singing yes , "
163713	163729	163687	163687	Mab	424	" Ma , do ask Mirah to sing . Mr. Deronda has not heard her . "
163730	163741	163743	163743	Deronda	289	" Would it be disagreeable to you to sing now ? "
163759	163767	163769	163769	Mirah	289	" Oh , I shall like it , "
163771	163782	163769	163769	Mirah	289	" My voice has come back a little with rest . "
164080	164086	164076	164076	She	289	" Per pieta non dirmi addio "
164197	164209	164210	164210	he	4237	" I think I never enjoyed a song more than that , "
164215	164226	164227	164227	she	289	" You like my singing ? I am so glad , "
164236	164301	164227	164227	she	289	" It has been a great pain to me , because it failed in what it was wanted for . But now we think I can use it to get my bread . I have really been taught well . And now I have two pupils , that Miss Meyrick found for me . They pay me nearly two crowns for their two lessons . "
164302	164318	164320	164320	Deronda	289	" I think I know some ladies who would find you many pupils after Christmas , "
164322	164337	164320	164320	Deronda	289	" You would not mind singing before any one who wished to hear you ? "
164338	164375	164376	164376	Mirah	289	" Oh no , I want to do something to get money . I could teach reading and speaking , Mrs. Meyrick thinks . But if no one would learn of me , that is difficult . "
164391	164424	164376	164376	Mirah	289	" I dare say I should find her poor I mean my mother . I should want to get money for her . And I can not always live on charity ; though "
164440	164451	164426	164426	she	289	" it is the sweetest charity in all the world . "
164452	164461	164463	164463	Deronda	289	" I should think you can get rich , "
164467	164491	164463	164463	Deronda	289	" Great ladies will perhaps like you to teach their daughters , We shall see . But now do sing again to us . "
164522	164537	164517	164517	Mab	424	" Oh , Mirah , if you would not mind singing the little hymn . "
164538	164544	164546	164546	Mirah	289	" It is too childish , "
164548	164554	164546	164546	Mirah	289	" It is like lisping . "
164555	164561	164563	164563	Deronda	289	" What is the hymn ? "
164565	164585	164587	164588	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" It is the Hebrew hymn she remembers her mother singing over her when she lay in her cot , "
164590	164600	164602	164602	Deronda	289	" I should like very much to hear it , "
164604	164618	164602	164602	Deronda	289	" if you think I am worthy to hear what is so sacred . "
164619	164628	164630	164630	Mirah	289	" I will sing it if you like , "
164632	164670	164630	164630	Mirah	289	" but I do n't sing real words only here and there a syllable like hers the rest is lisping . Do you know Hebrew ? because if you do , my singing will seem childish nonsense . "
164676	164686	164671	164671	Deronda	289	" It will be quite good Hebrew to me . "
164768	164791	164796	164796	she	289	" If I were ever to know the real words , I should still go on in my old way with them , "
164804	164808	164810	164810	Deronda	289	" Why not ? "
164812	164822	164810	164810	Deronda	289	" The lisped syllables are very full of meaning . "
164823	164828	164830	164831	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Yes , indeed , "
164833	164918	164830	164831	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" A mother hears something of a lisp in her children 's talk to the very last . Their words are not just what everybody else says , though they may be spelled the same . If I were to live till my Hans got old , I should still see the boy in him . A mother 's love , I often say , is like a tree that has got all the wood in it , from the very first it made . "
164919	164930	164932	164932	Deronda	289	" Is not that the way with friendship , too ? "
164936	164947	164932	164932	Deronda	289	" We must not let the mothers be too arrogant . "
164958	164992	164830	164831	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" It is easier to find an old mother than an old friend . Friendships begin with liking or gratitude roots that can be pulled up . Mother 's love begins deeper down . "
164993	165005	165007	165007	Deronda	289	" Like what you were saying about the influence of voices , "
165013	165064	165007	165007	Deronda	289	" I do n't think your hymn would have had more expression for me if I had known the words . I went to the synagogue at Frankfort before I came home , and the service impressed me just as much as if I had followed the words perhaps more . "
165065	165081	165083	165083	Mirah	289	" Oh , was it great to you ? Did it go to your heart ? "
165087	165120	165083	165083	Mirah	289	" I thought none but our people would feel that . I thought it was all shut away like a river in a deep valley , where only heaven saw I mean - "
165135	165139	165141	165141	Deronda	289	" I understand , "
165143	165237	165141	165141	Deronda	289	" But there is not really such a separation deeper down , as Mrs. Meyrick says . Our religion is chiefly a Hebrew religion ; and since Jews are men , their religious feelings must have much in common with those of other men just as their poetry , though in one sense peculiar , has a great deal in common with the poetry of other nations . Still it is to be expected that a Jew would feel the forms of his people 's religion more than one of another race and yet "
165244	165252	165242	165242	his	4244	" that is perhaps not always so . "
165253	165257	165259	165259	Mirah	289	" Ah no , "
165263	165291	165259	165259	Mirah	289	" I have seen that . I have seen them mock . Is it not like mocking your parents ? like rejoicing in your parents ' shame ? "
165292	165321	165323	165323	Deronda	289	" Some minds naturally rebel against whatever they were brought up in , and like the opposite ; they see the faults in what is nearest to them , "
165326	165334	165336	165336	Mirah	289	" But you are not like that , "
165345	165352	165354	165354	Deronda	289	" No , I think not , "
165356	165369	165354	165354	Deronda	289	" but you know I was not brought up as a Jew . "
165370	165378	165380	165380	Mirah	289	" Ah , I am always forgetting , "
165415	165450	165407	165407	he	4244	" Whichever way we take it , we have to tolerate each other ; for if we all went in opposition to our teaching , we must end in difference , just the same . "
165451	165466	165468	165469	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" To be sure . We should go on forever in zig - zags , "
165471	165555	165468	165469	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I think it is very weak - minded to make your creed up by the rule of the contrary . Still one may honor one 's parents , without following their notions exactly , any more than the exact cut of their clothing . My father was a Scotch Calvinist and my mother was a French Calvinist ; I am neither quite Scotch , nor quite French , nor two Calvinists rolled into one , yet I honor my parents ' memory . "
165556	165567	165569	165569	Mirah	289	" But I could not make myself not a Jewess , "
165573	165581	165569	165569	Mirah	289	" even if I changed my belief . "
165582	165623	165625	165626	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" No , my dear . But if Jews and Jewesses went on changing their religion , and making no difference between themselves and Christians , there would come a time when there would be no Jews to be seen , "
165634	165643	165645	165645	Mirah	289	" Oh , please not to say that , "
165651	165785	165645	165645	Mirah	289	" It is the first unkind thing you ever said . I will not begin that . I will never separate myself from my mother 's people . I was forced to fly from my father ; but if he came back in age and weakness and want , and needed me , should I say , ' This is not my father ' ? If he had shame , I must share it . It was he who was given to me for my father , and not another . And so it is with my people . I will always be a Jewess . I will love Christians when they are good , like you . But I will always cling to my people . I will always worship with them . "
165861	165867	165852	165852	they	781	" I am a Jew . "
165868	165881	165883	165884	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Mirah , Mirah , my dear child , you mistake me ! "
165888	165956	165883	165884	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" God forbid I should want you to do anything against your conscience . I was only saying what might be if the world went on . But I had better have left the world alone , and not wanted to be over - wise . Forgive me , come ! we will not try to take you from anybody you feel has more right to you . "
165957	165972	165974	165974	Mirah	289	" I would do anything else for you . I owe you my life , "
165981	165988	165990	165991	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Hush , hush , now , "
165993	166018	165990	165991	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I have been punished enough for wagging my tongue foolishly making an almanac for the Millennium , as my husband used to say . "
166019	166041	166043	166043	Mab	424	" But everything in the world must come to an end some time . We must bear to think of that , "
166114	166146	166111	166111	he	4247	" That ' prospect of everything coming to an end will not guide us far in practice . Mirah 's feelings , she tells us , are concerned with what is . "
166187	166210	166185	166185	she	424	" I only meant that we must have courage to hear things , else there is hardly anything we can talk about . "
166224	166241	166213	166213	herself	424	" What motive has a man to live , if not for the pleasure of discourse ? "
166268	166281	166265	166265	he	4247	" Hans is to share my chambers when he comes at Christmas . "
166282	166291	166293	166294	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You have written to Rome about that ? "
166301	166316	166293	166294	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" How very good and thoughtful of you ! You mentioned Mirah , then ? "
166317	166333	166265	166265	he	4247	" Yes , I referred to her . I concluded he knew everything from you . "
166334	166390	166293	166294	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I must confess my folly . I have not yet written a word about her . I have always been meaning to do it , and yet have ended my letter without saying a word . And I told the girls to leave it to me . However ! Thank you a thousand times . "
166499	166509	166510	166510	he	4249	" I have my hands on the reins now , "
166513	166530	166510	166510	he	4249	" and I will not drop them . I shall go there as little as possible . "
166777	166786	166809	166809	Deronda	289	" This one is the better for me . "
166787	166807	166809	166809	Deronda	289	" I would as soon hold out my finger to be bitten off as set about spoiling her peace , "
166811	166901	166809	166809	Deronda	289	" It was one of the rarest bits of fortune that I should have had friends like the Meyricks to place her with generous , delicate friends without any loftiness in their ways , so that her dependence on them is not only safety but happiness . There could be no refuge to replace that , if it were broken up . But what is the use of my taking the vows and settling everything as it should be , if that marplot Hans comes and upsets it all ? "
167337	167346	167348	167348	his	406	" At least , I will look about , "
167352	167368	167348	167348	his	406	" I may find some special Jewish machinery . I will wait till after Christmas . "
167428	167432	167434	167435	a Rabbi	4277	" No man , "
167443	167455	167434	167435	a Rabbi	4277	" may turn the bones of his father and mother into spoons "
167483	167487	167478	167479	any one	7749	" Why not ? "
168634	168640	168614	168615	a figure	4335	" Good day , sir . "
168681	168685	168687	168687	he	4313	" good day , "
169110	169243	169095	169095	Deronda	289	" Confound it , Dan ! why do n't you make an opportunity of saying these things in public ? You 're wrong , you know . You wo n't succeed . You 've got the massive sentiment the heavy artillery of the country against you . But it 's all the better ground for a young man to display himself on . When I was your age , I should have taken it . And it would be quite as well for you to be in opposition to me here and there . It would throw you more into relief . If you would seize an occasion of this sort to make an impression , you might be in Parliament in no time . And you know that would gratify me . "
169244	169258	169260	169260	Deronda	289	" I am sorry not to do what would gratify you , sir , "
169262	169277	169260	169260	Deronda	289	" But I can not persuade myself to look at politics as a profession . "
169278	169386	169095	169095	Deronda	289	" Why not ? if a man is not born into public life by his position in the country , there 's no way for him but to embrace it by his own efforts . The business of the country must be done her Majesty 's Government carried on , as the old Duke said . And it never could be , my boy , if everybody looked at politics as if they were prophecy , and demanded an inspired vocation . If you are to get into Parliament , it wo n't do to sit still and wait for a call either from heaven or constituents . "
169387	169400	169402	169402	Deronda	289	" I do n't want to make a living out of opinions , "
169404	169450	169402	169402	Deronda	289	" especially out of borrowed opinions . Not that I mean to blame other men . I dare say many better fellows than I do n't mind getting on to a platform to praise themselves , and giving their word of honor for a party . "
169451	169460	169462	169463	Sir Hugo	209	" I 'll tell you what , Dan , "
169465	169569	169462	169463	Sir Hugo	209	" a man who sets his face against every sort of humbug is simply a three - cornered , impracticable fellow . There 's a bad style of humbug , but there is also a good style one that oils the wheels and makes progress possible . If you are to rule men , you must rule them through their own ideas ; and I agree with the Archbishop at Naples who had a St. Januarius procession against the plague . It 's no use having an Order in Council against popular shallowness . There is no action possible without a little acting . "
169570	169583	169585	169585	Deronda	289	" One may be obliged to give way to an occasional necessity , "
169587	169673	169585	169585	Deronda	289	" But it is one thing to say , ' In this particular case I am forced to put on this foolscap and grin , ' and another to buy a pocket foolscap and practice myself in grinning . I ca n't see any real public expediency that does not keep an ideal before it which makes a limit of deviation from the direct path . But if I were to set up for a public man I might mistake my success for public expediency . "
170581	170590	170576	170576	he	4355	" What is the price of this book ? "
170609	170644	170645	170645	He	4396	" There is no mark , and Mr. Ram is not in now . I am keeping the shop while he is gone to dinner . What are you disposed to give for it ? "
170701	170712	170698	170698	he	4355	" Do n't you know how much it is worth ? "
170713	170728	170698	170698	he	4355	" Not its market - price . May I ask have you read it ? "
170729	170748	170698	170698	he	4355	" No . I have read an account of it , which makes me want to buy it . "
170749	170763	170698	170698	he	4355	" You are a man of learning you are interested in Jewish history ? "
170775	170784	170786	170786	Deronda	289	" I am certainly interested in Jewish history , "
170844	170852	170853	170853	Deronda	289	" You are perhaps of our race ? "
170873	170876	170853	170853	Deronda	289	" No . "
170943	170960	170926	170926	he	4396	" I believe Mr. Ram will be satisfied with half - a - crown , sir . "
171023	171028	171006	171006	he	4396	" good - morning . "
171133	171138	171130	171130	he	4396	" Mother ! Mother ! "
171150	171157	171130	171130	he	4396	" Coming , sir coming directly . "
171474	171483	171466	171466	she	4405	" How can I serve you , sir ? "
171484	171498	171500	171500	Deronda	289	" I should like to look at the silver clasps in the window , "
171502	171514	171500	171500	Deronda	289	" the larger ones , please , in the corner there . "
171537	171550	171530	171531	the son	4417	" I 'll reach 'em , mother ; I 'll reach 'em , "
171567	171625	171562	171562	Deronda	289	" Mother 's too proud : she wants to do everything herself . That 's why I called her to wait on you , sir . When there 's a particular gentleman customer , sir , I dare n't do any other than call her . But I ca n't let her do herself mischief with stretching . "
171656	171677	171645	171645	she	4418	" This boy will be at his jokes , but you see he 's the best son in the world , "
171732	171741	171743	171744	the mother	1566	" They are only three guineas , sir , "
171748	171769	171771	171772	the son	4417	" First - rate workmanship , sir worth twice the money ; only I get 'em a bargain from Cologne , "
171791	171794	171781	171783	two new customers	4423	" Addy ! "
171917	171919	171912	171914	The young woman	4434	" Addy "
172062	172070	172054	172054	Deronda	289	" What is your name , sirrah ? "
172071	172076	172078	172080	the small man	4443	" Jacob Alexander Cohen , "
172088	172099	172054	172054	Deronda	289	" You are not named after your father , then ? "
172100	172118	172120	172120	Jacob	547	" No , after my grandfather ; he sells knives and razors and scissors my grandfather does , "
172132	172139	172120	172120	Jacob	547	" He gave me this knife . "
172172	172180	172182	172182	Deronda	289	" Is not that a dangerous plaything ? "
172189	172199	172201	172201	she	4445	" He 'll never hurt himself , bless you ! "
172210	172217	172219	172219	Jacob	547	" Have you got a knife ? "
172250	172260	172262	172262	Deronda	289	" Yes . Do you want to see it ? "
172363	172369	172371	172371	Jacob	547	" Mine 's the best , "
172403	172413	172415	172416	Mr. Cohen	441	" You wo n't find Jacob choosing the worst , "
172445	172454	172429	172429	Deronda	289	" Are these the only grandchildren you have ? "
172455	172464	172465	172465	she	4445	" All . This is my only son , "
172504	172511	172501	172501	he	547	" And you have no daughter ? "
172586	172610	172576	172576	his	2994	" I think you 're a first - rate gentleman in the city , sir , if I may be allowed to guess . "
172611	172614	172616	172616	Deronda	289	" No , "
172623	172633	172616	172616	Deronda	289	" I have nothing to do with the city . "
172634	172656	172658	172659	Mr. Cohen	441	" That 's a bad job . I thought you might be the young principal of a first - rate firm , "
172682	172693	172658	172659	Mr. Cohen	441	" But you understand silver - work , I see . "
172694	172698	172700	172700	Deronda	289	" A little , "
172767	172774	172775	172775	he	441	" To tell you the truth , "
172779	172803	172775	172775	he	441	" my errand is not so much to buy as to borrow . I dare say you go into rather heavy transactions occasionally . "
172804	172984	172775	172775	he	441	" Well , sir , I 've accommodated gentlemen of distinction I 'm proud to say it . I would n't exchange my business with any in the world . There 's none more honorable , nor more charitable , nor more necessary for all classes , from the good lady who wants a little of the ready for the baker , to a gentleman like yourself , sir , who may want it for amusement . I like my business , I like my street , and I like my shop . I would n't have it a door further down . And I would n't be without a pawn - shop , sir , to be the Lord Mayor . It puts you in connection with the world at large . I say it 's like the government revenue it embraces the brass as well as the gold of the country . And a man who does n't get money , sir , ca n't accommodate . Now , what can I do for you , sir ? "
173182	173237	173173	173173	he	548	" I have a fine diamond ring to offer as security not with me at this moment , unfortunately , for I am not in the habit of wearing it . But I will come again this evening and bring it with me . Fifty pounds at once would be a convenience to me . "
173238	173253	173255	173255	Cohen	538	" Well , you know , this evening is the Sabbath , young gentleman , "
173257	173312	173255	173255	Cohen	538	" and I go to the Shool . The shop will be closed . But accommodation is a work of charity ; if you ca n't get here before , and are any ways pressed why , I 'll look at your diamond . You 're perhaps from the West End a longish drive ? "
173313	173335	173336	173336	Deronda	289	" Yes ; and your Sabbath begins early at this season . I could be here by five will that do ? "
173412	173427	173402	173402	he	547	" You are coming again . Have you got any more knives at home ? "
173428	173435	173437	173437	Deronda	289	" I think I have one , "
173444	173459	173461	173461	Jacob	547	" Has it two blades and a hook and a white handle like that ? "
173470	173477	173461	173461	Jacob	547	" I dare say it has ? "
173478	173487	173489	173489	Jacob	547	" Do you like a cork - screw ? "
173507	173510	173512	173512	Deronda	289	" Yes , "
173516	173528	173530	173530	Jacob	547	" Bring your knife , then , and we 'll shwop , "
173624	173631	173633	173634	her mother	903	" Adelaide Rebekah is her name , "
173638	173646	173633	173634	her mother	903	" Speak to the gentleman , lovey . "
173647	173653	173655	173656	Adelaide Rebekah	419	" Shlav'm Shabbes fyock on , "
173658	173666	173668	173669	the father	1507	" Her Sabbath frock , she means , "
173674	173685	173668	173669	the father	1507	" She 'll have her Sabbath frock on this evening . "
173686	173699	173701	173701	Deronda	289	" And will you let me see you in it , Adelaide ? "
173714	173727	173729	173730	her mother	903	" Say yes , lovey yes , if you please , sir , "
173744	173755	173757	173757	Deronda	289	" And will you give me a kiss this evening ? "
173825	173900	173815	173821	the stranger who was an admiring witness	4485	" You see there 's somebody will be disappointed if you do n't come this evening , sir . You wo n't mind sitting down in our family place and waiting a bit for me , if I 'm not in when you come , sir ? I 'll stretch a point to accommodate a gent of your sort . Bring the diamond , and I 'll see what I can do for you . "
174127	174166	174196	174196	she	4494	" Er ist geheissen Israel . Ihn hat verwandelt Hexenspruch in elnen Hund . Aber jeden Freitag Abend , In der Dšmmrungstunde , plŲtzlich Weicht der Zauber , und der Hund Wird aufs Neu ' ein menschlich Wesen . "
174614	174626	174588	174588	He	923	" Is that the sort of thing you want , Jacob ? "
174658	174672	174674	174674	Deronda	289	" Why do you like a hook better than a cork - screw ? "
174676	174711	174674	174674	Deronda	289	" ' Caush I can get hold of things with a hook . A corkscrew wo n't go into anything but corks . But it 's better for you , you can draw corks . "
174712	174720	174722	174722	Deronda	289	" You agree to change , then ? "
174733	174743	174745	174745	Jacob	547	" What else have you got in your pockets ? "
174751	174760	174762	174763	the grandmother	4445	" Hush , hush , Jacob , love , "
174773	174790	174762	174763	the grandmother	4445	" I think I must not tell you that . Our business was with the knives . "
174813	174818	174791	174791	Jacob	547	" I 'll shwop , "
174988	175004	175006	175006	Cohen	547	" Well , sir , you found your welcome in my family , I think , "
175018	175032	175033	175033	he	547	" And you 've been punctual . Nothing like a little stress here , "
175045	175096	175033	175033	he	547	" It 's good for us all in our turn . I 've felt it when I 've had to make up payments . I began to fit every sort of box . It 's bracing to the mind . Now then ! let us see , let us see . "
175097	175106	175108	175108	Deronda	289	" That is the ring I spoke of , "
175116	175150	175108	175108	Deronda	289	" I believe it cost a hundred pounds . It will be a sufficient pledge to you for fifty , I think . I shall probably redeem it in a month or so . "
175199	175243	175185	175185	He	547	" Good , good . We 'll talk of it after our meal . Perhaps you 'll join us , if you 've no objection . Me and my wife'll feel honored , and so will mother ; wo n't you , mother ? "
175316	175319	175306	175306	he	547	" Mordecai ! "
175347	175349	175306	175306	he	547	" Yes "

175853	175869	175871	175871	Cohen	550	" I dare say you know all about it better than we do , sir , "
175894	175903	175905	175907	young Mrs. Cohen	550	" Our baby is named Eu genie Esther , "
175911	175928	175930	175931	the grandmother	4445	" It 's wonderful how the Emperor 's like a cousin of mine in the face , "
175933	175953	175930	175931	the grandmother	4445	" it struck me like lightning when I caught sight of him . I could n't have thought it . "
175954	175971	175973	175974	Mr. Cohen	441	" Mother , and me went to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal Palace , "
175976	176066	175973	175974	Mr. Cohen	441	" I had a fine piece of work to take care of , mother ; she might have been squeezed flat though she was pretty near as lusty then as she is now . I said if I had a hundred mothers I 'd never take one of 'em to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal Palace again ; and you may think a man ca n't afford it when he 's got but one mother not if he 'd ever so big an insurance on her . "
176084	176097	176099	176099	Deronda	289	" Your mother has been a widow a long while , perhaps , "
176105	176117	176099	176099	Deronda	289	" That has made your care for her the more needful . "
176118	176141	176143	176143	Cohen	441	" Ay , ay , it 's a good many yore - zeit since I had to manage for her and myself , "
176146	176162	176143	176143	Cohen	441	" I went early to it . It 's that makes you a sharp knife . "
176163	176174	176176	176176	Jacob	547	" What does what makes a sharp knife , father ? "
176197	176206	176188	176189	The father	1507	" Having your nose put on the grindstone . "
176239	176251	176228	176228	Mordecai	538	" What does that mean putting my nose to the grindstone ? "
176252	176267	176269	176269	Mordecai	538	" It means that you are to bear being hurt without making a noise , "
176303	176309	176283	176283	Jacob	547	" I sha n't though , "
176372	176383	176385	176385	he	547	" I fancy that is the right quarter for learning , "
176408	176419	176403	176403	he	547	" You have been a great student , I imagine ? "
176420	176425	176385	176385	he	547	" I have studied , "
176431	176445	176385	176385	he	547	" And you ? You know German by the book you were buying . "
176446	176462	176464	176464	Deronda	289	" Yes , I have studied in Germany . Are you generally engaged in bookselling ? "
176466	176488	176490	176490	Mordecai	538	" No ; I only go to Mr. Ram 's shop every day to keep it while he goes to meals , "
176535	176541	176532	176532	he	538	" Perhaps you know Hebrew ? "
176542	176553	176532	176532	he	538	" I am sorry to say , not at all . "
176607	176622	176624	176625	Mr. Cohen	441	" I 've had something else to do than to get book - learning . "
176627	176644	176624	176625	Mr. Cohen	441	" I 've had to make myself knowing about useful things . I know stones well , "
176653	176672	176673	176673	he	538	" I 'm not afraid of taking that ring of yours at my own valuation . But now , "
176691	176699	176681	176681	his	538	" what do you want for it ? "
176700	176706	176707	176707	Deronda	289	" Fifty or sixty pounds , "
176745	176776	176720	176720	his	441	" Could n't do you that . Happy to oblige , but could n't go that lengths . Forty pound say forty I 'll let you have forty on it . "
176805	176819	176802	176802	he	538	" Very well , I shall redeem it in a month or so . "
176820	176836	176838	176838	Cohen	441	" Good . I 'll make you out the ticket by - and - by , "
177033	177043	177045	177045	Deronda	289	" That seems to be rather a remarkable man , "
177100	177108	177110	177110	Deronda	289	" Does he belong to your family ? "
177136	177141	177143	177143	Cohen	441	" No , no , "
177145	177197	177143	177143	Cohen	441	" Charity ! charity ! he worked for me , and when he got weaker and weaker I took him in . He 's an incumbrance ; but he brings a blessing down , and he teaches the boy . Besides , he does the repairing at the watches and jewelry . "
177256	177259	177222	177222	his	4565	" accommodation , "
177654	177657	177659	177659	they	4583	" cousin , "
177790	177811	177813	177813	his	538	" I fancy there are some natures one could see growing or degenerating every day , if one watched them , "
177816	178016	177813	177813	his	538	" I suppose some of us go on faster than others : and I am sure she is a creature who keeps strong traces of anything that has once impressed her . That little affair of the necklace , and the idea that somebody thought her gambling wrong , had evidently bitten into her . But such impressibility leads both ways : it may drive one to desperation as soon as to anything better . And whatever fascinations Grandcourt may have for capricious tastes good heavens ! who can believe that he would call out the tender affections in daily companionship ? One might be tempted to horsewhip him for the sake of getting some show of passion into his face and speech . I 'm afraid she married him out of ambition to escape poverty . But why did she run out of his way at first ? The poverty came after , though . Poor thing ! she may have been urged into it . How can one feel anything else than pity for a young creature like that full of unused life ignorantly rash hanging all her blind expectations on that remnant of a human being . "
178050	178052	178049	178052	a " remnant "	9935	" remnant "
178867	178920	178849	178849	he	206	" Men who have seen a good deal of life do n't always end by choosing their wives so well . He has had rather an anecdotic history gone rather deep into pleasures , I fancy , lazy as he is . But , of course , you know all about him . "
178921	178926	178928	178928	Deronda	289	" No , really , "
178935	178951	178928	178928	Deronda	289	" I know little more of him than that he is Sir Hugo 's nephew . "
179068	179081	179083	179084	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" By George , I think she 's handsomer , if anything ! "
179386	179404	179368	179369	Sir Hugo	209	" Deronda , you will like to hear what Mrs. Grandcourt tells me about your favorite Klesmer . "
179463	179483	179458	179459	Sir Hugo	209	" The Arrowpoints have condoned the marriage , and he is spending the Christmas with his bride at Quetcham . "
179484	179514	179516	179516	Deronda	289	" I suppose he will be glad of it for the sake of his wife , else I dare say he would not have minded keeping at a distance , "
179518	179527	179529	179530	Lady Pentreath	554	" It 's a sort of troubadour story , "
179541	179566	179529	179530	Lady Pentreath	554	" I 'm glad to find a little romance left among us . I think our young people now are getting too worldly wise . "
179567	179591	179593	179594	Sir Hugo	209	" It shows the Arrowpoints ' good sense , however , to have adopted the affair , after the fuss in the paper , "
179596	179631	179593	179594	Sir Hugo	209	" And disowning your own child because of a mťsalliance is something like disowning your one eye : everybody knows it 's yours , and you have no other to make an appearance with . "
179632	179645	179647	179648	Lady Pentreath	554	" As to mťsalliance , there 's no blood on any side , "
179650	179679	179647	179648	Lady Pentreath	554	" Old Admiral Arrowpoint was one of Nelson 's men , you know a doctor 's son . And we all know how the mother 's money came . "
179680	179700	179702	179702	Deronda	289	" If they were any mťsalliance in the case , I should say it was on Klesmer 's side , "
179704	179725	179727	179728	Sir Hugo	209	" Ah , you think it is a case of the immortal marrying the mortal . What is your opinion ? "
179734	179763	179765	179765	Gwendolen	289	" I have no doubt that Herr Klesmer thinks himself immortal . But I dare say his wife will burn as much incense before him as he requires , "
179778	179792	179794	179795	Sir Hugo	209	" Do n't you approve of a wife burning incense before her husband ? "
179803	179808	179810	179810	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , yes , "
179812	179824	179810	179810	Gwendolen	289	" if it were only to make others believe in him . "
179836	179859	179825	179825	She	289	" When Herr Klesmer admires his own genius , it will take off some of the absurdity if his wife says Amen . "
179860	179871	179873	179874	Sir Hugo	209	" Klesmer is no favorite of yours , I see , "
179876	179888	179890	179890	Gwendolen	289	" I think very highly of him , I assure you , "
179892	179910	179890	179890	Gwendolen	289	" His genius is quite above my judgment , and I know him to be exceedingly generous . "
180025	180108	180011	180012	Sir Hugo	209	" Is not this a beautiful room ? It was part of the refectory of the Abbey . There was a division made by those pillars and the three arches , and afterward they were built up . Else it was half as large again originally . There used to be rows of Benedictines sitting where we are sitting . Suppose we were suddenly to see the lights burning low and the ghosts of the old monks rising behind all our chairs ! "
180109	180114	180116	180116	Gwendolen	289	" Please do n't ! "
180123	180176	180116	180116	Gwendolen	289	" It is very nice to come after ancestors and monks , but they should know their places and keep underground . I should be rather frightened to go about this house all alone . I suppose the old generations must be angry with us because we have altered things so much . "
180177	180189	180191	180192	Sir Hugo	209	" Oh , the ghosts must be of all political parties , "
180194	180271	180191	180192	Sir Hugo	209	" And those fellows who wanted to change things while they lived and could n't do it must be on our side . But if you would not like to go over the house alone , you will like to go in company , I hope . You and Grandcourt ought to see it all . And we will ask Deronda to go round with us . He is more learned about it than I am . "
180409	180423	180404	180404	she	289	" You do n't know how much I am afraid of Mr. Deronda . "
180424	180436	180438	180439	Sir Hugo	209	" How 's that ? Because you think him too learned ? "
180451	180524	180404	180404	she	289	" No . It is ever since I first saw him at Leubronn . Because when he came to look on at the roulette - table , I began to lose . He cast an evil eye on my play . He did n't approve it . He has told me so . And now whatever I do before him , I am afraid he will cast an evil eye upon it . "
180525	180541	180543	180544	Sir Hugo	209	" Gad ! I 'm rather afraid of him myself when he does n't approve , "
180563	180578	180558	180558	he	209	" I do n't think ladies generally object to have his eyes upon them . "
180603	180613	180614	180614	she	289	" I object to any eyes that are critical , "
180631	180644	180614	180614	she	289	" Are there many of these old rooms left in the Abbey ? "
180645	180726	180558	180558	he	209	" Not many . There is a fine cloistered court with a long gallery above it . But the finest bit of all is turned into stables . It is part of the old church . When I improved the place I made the most of every other bit ; but it was out of my reach to change the stables , so the horses have the benefit of the fine old choir . You must go and see it . "
180727	180741	180743	180743	Gwendolen	289	" I shall like to see the horses as well as the building , "
180745	180765	180767	180768	Sir Hugo	209	" Oh , I have no stud to speak of . Grandcourt will look with contempt at my horses , "
180770	180830	180767	180768	Sir Hugo	209	" I 've given up hunting , and go on in a jog - trot way , as becomes an old gentlemen with daughters . The fact is , I went in for doing too much at this place . We all lived at Diplow for two years while the alterations were going on : Do you like Diplow ? "
180831	180835	180837	180837	Gwendolen	289	" Not particularly , "
180865	180875	180877	180878	Sir Hugo	209	" Ah ! it will not do after Ryelands , "
180883	180907	180909	180910	the baronet	7684	" Grandcourt , I know , took it for the sake of the hunting . But he found something so much better there , "
180916	180931	180913	180913	his	7684	" that he might well prefer it to any other place in the world . "
180932	180940	180942	180942	Gwendolen	289	" It has one attraction for me , "
180953	180962	180942	180942	Gwendolen	289	" that it is within reach of Offendene . "
180963	180968	180970	180971	Sir Hugo	209	" I understand that , "
181429	181438	181439	181439	he	209	" Will you not join in the music ? "
181478	181492	181471	181471	she	289	" I join in it by listening . I am fond of music . "
181493	181500	181451	181451	her	289	" Are you not a musician ? "
181501	181531	181471	181471	she	289	" I have given a great deal of time to music . But I have not talent enough to make it worth while . I shall never sing again . "
181532	181567	181569	181569	Deronda	289	" But if you are fond of music , it will always be worth while in private , for your own delight . I make it a virtue to be content with my middlingness , "
181573	181592	181569	181569	Deronda	289	" it is always pardonable , so that one does not ask others to take it for superiority . "
181593	181600	181605	181605	her	289	" I can not imitate you , "
181611	181664	181605	181605	her	289	" To be middling with me is another phrase for being dull . And the worst fault I have to find with the world is , that it is dull . Do you know , I am going to justify gambling in spite of you . It is a refuge from dullness . "
181665	181673	181675	181675	Deronda	289	" I do n't admit the justification , "
181677	181709	181675	181675	Deronda	289	" I think what we call the dullness of things is a disease in ourselves . Else how can any one find an intense interest in life ? And many do . "
181710	181728	181730	181730	Gwendolen	289	" Ah , I see ! The fault I find in the world is my own fault , "
181751	181764	181748	181748	she	289	" Do you never find fault with the world or with others ? "
181765	181778	181675	181675	Deronda	289	" Oh , yes . When I am in a grumbling mood . "
181779	181810	181748	181748	she	289	" And hate people ? Confess you hate them when they stand in your way when their gain is your loss ? That is your own phrase , you know . "
181811	181840	181675	181675	Deronda	289	" We are often standing in each other 's way when we ca n't help it . I think it is stupid to hate people on that ground . "
181841	181853	181855	181855	Gwendolen	289	" But if they injure you and could have helped it ? "
181897	181912	181887	181887	he	4670	" Why , then , after all , I prefer my place to theirs . "
181913	181921	181923	181923	Gwendolen	289	" There I believe you are right , "
182496	182505	182507	182507	Deronda	289	" What is the use of it all ? "
182521	182652	182507	182507	Deronda	289	" I ca n't do anything to help her nobody can , if she has found out her mistake already . And it seems to me that she has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help her . Strange and piteous to human flesh like that might be , wrapped round with fine raiment , her ears pierced for gems , her head held loftily , her mouth all smiling pretence , the poor soul within her sitting in sick distaste of all things ! But what do I know of her ? There may be a demon in her to match the worst husband , for what I can tell . She was clearly an ill - educated , worldly girl : perhaps she is a coquette . "
182785	182788	182783	182783	her	289	" coquette . "
182877	182912	182871	182872	Sir Hugo	209	" The thaw has gone on like magic , and it 's so pleasant out of doors just now shall we go and see the stables and the other odd bits about the place ? "
182913	182918	182920	182920	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , pray , "
182922	182933	182934	182934	she	289	" You will like to see the stables , Henleigh ? "
182942	182945	182947	182947	Grandcourt	325	" Uncommonly , "
183046	183061	183063	183064	Sir Hugo	209	" Who else is inclined to make the tour of the house and premises ? "
183066	183096	183063	183064	Sir Hugo	209	" The ladies must muffle themselves ; there is only just about time to do it well before sunset . You will go , Dan , wo n't you ? "
183097	183102	183104	183104	Deronda	197	" Oh , yes , "
183118	183137	183139	183140	the baronet	7684	" All meet in the library , then , when they are ready say in half an hour , "
183594	183602	183603	183603	he	197	" Oh , you are there already , "
183613	183623	183603	183603	he	197	" I must go and put on my coat . "
183696	183703	183705	183705	Grandcourt	325	" A you look rather ill , "
183725	183734	183705	183705	Grandcourt	325	" Do you feel equal to the walk ? "
183735	183743	183745	183745	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , I shall like it , "
183757	183777	183779	183780	Sir Hugo	209	" We could put off going over the house , you know , and only go out of doors , "
183789	183795	183797	183797	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , dear no ! "
183803	183816	183797	183797	Gwendolen	289	" let us put off nothing . I want a long walk . "
183935	183944	183946	183947	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , now , to my mind , "
183949	184086	183946	183947	Sir Hugo	209	" that is more interesting standing as it is in the middle of what is frankly four centuries later , than if the whole front had been dressed up in a pretense of the thirteenth century . Additions ought to smack of the time when they are made and carry the stamp of their period . I would n't destroy any old bits , but that notion of reproducing the old is a mistake , I think . At least , if a man likes to do it he must pay for his whistle . Besides , where are you to stop along that road making loopholes where you do n't want to peep , and so on ? You may as well ask me to wear out the stones with kneeling ; eh , Grandcourt ? "
184087	184092	184094	184094	Grandcourt	325	" A confounded nuisance , "
184096	184113	184094	184094	Grandcourt	325	" I hate fellows wanting to howl litanies acting the greatest bores that have ever existed . "
184114	184128	184130	184131	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , yes , that 's what their romanticism must come to , "
184139	184149	184094	184094	Grandcourt	325	" that is if they carry it out logically . "
184150	184177	184179	184179	Deronda	289	" I think that way of arguing against a course because it may be ridden down to an absurdity would soon bring life to a standstill , "
184181	184230	184179	184179	Deronda	289	" It is not the logic of human action , but of a roasting - jack , that must go on to the last turn when it has been once wound up . We can do nothing safely without some judgment as to where we are to stop . "
184231	184243	184245	184246	Sir Hugo	209	" I find the rule of the pocket the best guide , "
184250	184296	184245	184246	Sir Hugo	209	" And as for most of your new - old building , you had need to hire men to scratch and chip it all over artistically to give it an elderly - looking surface ; which at the present rate of labor would not answer . "
184297	184313	184315	184315	Gwendolen	289	" Do you want to keep up the old fashions , then , Mr. Deronda ? "
184338	184410	184245	184246	Sir Hugo	209	" Some of them . I do n't see why we should not use our choice there as we do elsewhere or why either age or novelty by itself is an argument for or against . To delight in doing things because our fathers did them is good if it shuts out nothing better ; it enlarges the range of affection and affection is the broadest basis of good in life . "
184411	184417	184419	184419	Gwendolen	289	" Do you think so ? "
184425	184444	184419	184419	Gwendolen	289	" I should have thought you cared most about ideas , knowledge , wisdom , and all that . "
184445	184457	184459	184459	Deronda	289	" But to care about them is a sort of affection , "
184467	184532	184459	184459	Deronda	289	" Call it attachment ; interest , willing to bear a great deal for the sake of being with them and saving them from injury . Of course , it makes a difference if the objects of interest are human beings ; but generally in all deep affections the objects are a mixture half persons and half ideas sentiments and affections flow in together . "
184533	184541	184543	184543	Gwendolen	289	" I wonder whether I understand that , "
184555	184585	184547	184547	her	289	" I believe I am not very affectionate ; perhaps you mean to tell me , that is the reason why I do n't see much good in life . "
184586	184616	184618	184618	Deronda	289	" No , I did not mean to tell you that ; but I admit that I should think it true if I believed what you say of yourself , "
184632	184645	184647	184647	Gwendolen	289	" I never can get Mr. Deronda to pay me a compliment , "
184649	184667	184647	184647	Gwendolen	289	" I have quite a curiosity to see whether a little flattery can be extracted from him . "
184668	184671	184673	184674	Sir Hugo	209	" Ah ! "
184680	184716	184673	184674	Sir Hugo	209	" the fact is , it is useless to flatter a bride . We give it up in despair . She has been so fed on sweet speeches that every thing we say seems tasteless . "
184717	184721	184723	184723	Gwendolen	289	" Quite true , "
184731	184757	184726	184726	her	289	" Mr. Grandcourt won me by neatly - turned compliments . If there had been one word out of place it would have been fatal . "
184758	184764	184766	184767	Sir Hugo	209	" Do you hear that ? "
184774	184777	184779	184779	Grandcourt	325	" Yes , "
184786	184799	184779	184779	Grandcourt	325	" It 's a deucedly hard thing to keep up , though . "
185082	185109	185110	185110	she	289	" Pray do n't ask us to see two kitchens at once . It makes the heat double . I must really go out of it , "
185143	185156	185141	185141	he	206	" I wondered how long you meant to stay in that damned place "
185188	185200	185175	185175	Gwendolen	289	" It was certainly rather too warm in one 's wraps . "
185673	185680	185681	185681	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , this is glorious ! "
185723	185755	185715	185715	her	289	" This is glorious ! Only I wish there were a horse in every one of the boxes . I would ten times rather have these stables than those at Diplow . "
186007	186017	186019	186019	Grandcourt	325	" Do you take off your hat to horses ? "
186026	186030	186032	186032	Deronda	289	" Why not ? "
186145	186173	186175	186176	Sir Hugo	209	" The fact is , stables dive deeper and deeper into the pocket nowadays , and I am very glad to have got rid of that dťmangeaison , "
186184	186194	186196	186196	Grandcourt	325	" What is a man to do , though ? "
186198	186235	186196	186196	Grandcourt	325	" He must ride . I do n't see what else there is to do . And I do n't call it riding to sit astride a set of brutes with every deformity under the sun . "
186271	186298	186253	186259	the baronet , feeling that the conversation	4776	" Now we are going to see the cloister the finest bit of all in perfect preservation ; the monks might have been walking there yesterday . "
186327	186335	186336	186336	he	325	" You had better take my arm , "
186351	186368	186370	186370	Grandcourt	325	" It 's a great bore being dragged about in this way , and no cigar , "
186372	186380	186370	186370	Grandcourt	325	" I thought you would like it . "
186381	186410	186340	186340	his	325	" Like it ! one eternal chatter . And encouraging those ugly girls inviting one to meet such monsters . How that fat Deronda can bear looking at her "
186411	186427	186370	186370	Grandcourt	325	" Why do you call him fat ? Do you object to him so much ? "
186428	186462	186340	186340	his	325	" Object ? no . What do I care about his being a fat ? It 's of no consequence to me . I 'll invite him to Diplow again if you like . "
186463	186483	186485	186485	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't think he would come . He is too clever and learned to care about us , "
186509	186532	186534	186534	Grandcourt	325	" I never saw that make much difference in a man . Either he is a gentleman , or he is not , "
186706	186729	186730	186730	he	1088	" I wonder whether one oftener learns to love real objects through their representations , or the representations through the real objects , "
186763	186784	186730	186730	he	1088	" When I was a little fellow these capitals taught me to observe and delight in the structure of leaves . "
186785	186800	186802	186803	Juliet Fenn	335	" I suppose you can see every line of them with your eyes shut , "
186805	186849	186802	186803	Juliet Fenn	335	" Yes . I was always repeating them , because for a good many years this court stood for me as my only image of a convent , and whenever I read of monks and monasteries , this was my scenery for them . "
186850	186859	186861	186862	Miss Fenn	335	" You must love this place very much , "
186871	186907	186861	186862	Miss Fenn	335	" So many homes are like twenty others . But this is unique , and you seem to know every cranny of it . I dare say you could never love another home so well . "
186908	186917	186919	186919	Deronda	289	" Oh , I carry it with me , "
186933	186988	186919	186919	Deronda	289	" To most men their early home is no more than a memory of their early years , and I 'm not sure but they have the best of it . The image is never marred . There 's no disappointment in memory , and one 's exaggerations are always on the good side . "
187689	187708	187680	187680	she	289	" Do n't ask me it was my feeling about everything it was the sudden change from home . "
187731	187882	187680	187680	she	289	" I am the grave in which your chance of happiness is buried as well as mine . You had your warning . You have chosen to injure me and my children . He had meant to marry me . He would have married me at last , if you had not broken your word . You will have your punishment . I desire it with all my soul . Will you give him this letter to set him against me and ruin us more me and my children ? Shall you like to stand before your husband with these diamonds on you , and these words of mine in his thoughts and yours ? Will he think you have any right to complain when he has made you miserable ? You took him with your eyes open . The willing wrong you have done me will be your curse . "
188797	188805	188806	188806	she	289	" Am I altogether as you like ? "
188856	188859	188861	188861	Grandcourt	325	" No , "
188899	188910	188887	188887	he	325	" You are not in any way what I like . "
188939	188944	188945	188945	she	289	" Oh , mercy ! "
188959	188967	188945	188945	she	289	" How am I to alter myself ? "
188968	188974	188976	188976	Grandcourt	325	" Put on the diamonds , "
189030	189044	189016	189016	she	289	" Oh , please not . I do n't think diamonds suit me . "
189045	189056	189058	189058	Grandcourt	325	" What you think has nothing to do with it , "
189077	189086	189060	189060	his	325	" I wish you to wear the diamonds . "
189087	189097	189099	189099	Gwendolen	289	" Pray excuse me ; I like these emeralds , "
189162	189180	189182	189182	Grandcourt	325	" Oblige me by telling me your reason for not wearing the diamonds when I desire it , "
189326	189347	189348	189348	she	289	" He delights in making the dogs and horses quail : that is half his pleasure in calling them his , "
189365	189400	189348	189348	she	289	" It will come to be so with me ; and I shall quail . What else is there for me ? I will not say to the world , ' Pity me . ' "
189425	189434	189435	189435	he	325	" You want some one to fasten them , "
189491	189505	189486	189486	herself	289	" What a privilege this is , to have robbed another woman of ! "
189506	189513	189515	189515	Grandcourt	325	" What makes you so cold ? "
189527	189562	189518	189518	he	325	" Pray put plenty of furs on . I hate to see a woman come into a room looking frozen . If you are to appear as a bride at all , appear decently . "
189624	189634	189635	189635	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , yes , mamma , quite happy , "
189644	189674	189635	189635	Gwendolen	289	" Not at all disappointed in Ryelands . It is a much finer place than this larger in every way . But do n't you want some more money ? "
189675	189750	189635	189635	Gwendolen	289	" Did you not know that Mr. Grandcourt left me a letter on your wedding - day ? I am to have eight hundred a year . He wishes me to keep Offendene for the present , while you are at Diplow . But if there were some pretty cottage near the park at Ryelands we might live there without much expense , and I should have you most of the year , perhaps . "
189751	189762	189635	189635	Gwendolen	289	" We must leave that to Mr. Grandcourt , mamma . "
189763	189860	189635	189635	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , certainly . It is exceedingly handsome of him to say that he will pay the rent for Offendene till June . And we can go on very well without any man - servant except Crane , just for out - of - doors . Our good Merry will stay with us and help me to manage everything . It is natural that Mr. Grandcourt should wish me to live in a good style of house in your neighborhood , and I can not decline . So he said nothing about it to you ? "
189861	189876	189635	189635	Gwendolen	289	" No ; he wished me to hear it from you , I suppose . "
189941	189973	189924	189924	she	289	" It is very good of you to provide for mamma . You took a great deal on yourself in marrying a girl who had nothing but relations belonging to her . "
189983	190000	189974	189974	Grandcourt	325	" Of course I was not going to let her live like a gamekeeper 's mother . "
190001	190011	190013	190013	Gwendolen	289	" At least he is not mean about money , "
190015	190026	190013	190013	Gwendolen	289	" and mamma is the better off for my marriage . "
190126	190132	190120	190120	she	289	" manage differently from mamma ; "
190724	190738	190746	190746	she	289	" I wish he could know everything about me without my telling him , "
190782	190815	190825	190825	her	289	" I wish he knew that I am not so contemptible as he thinks me ; that I am in deep trouble , and want to be something better if I could . "
190944	190973	190974	190975	LA FONTAINE	571	" Rien ne pese tant qu'un secret Le porter loin est difficile aux dames : Et je sÁais mesme sur ce fait Bon nombre d'hommes qui sont femmes . "
191042	191068	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" What a washed - out piece of cambric Grandcourt is ! But if he is a favorite of yours , I withdraw the remark . "
191069	191077	191079	191079	Deronda	289	" Not the least in the world , "
191081	191167	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" I thought not . One wonders how he came to have a great passion again ; and he must have had to marry in this way . Though Lush , his old chum , hints that he married this girl out of obstinacy . By George ! it was a very accountable obstinacy . A man might make up his mind to marry her without the stimulus of contradiction . But he must have made himself a pretty large drain of money , eh ? "
191168	191176	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" I know nothing of his affairs . "
191177	191189	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" What ! not of the other establishment he keeps up ? "
191190	191209	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" Diplow ? Of course . He took that of Sir Hugo . But merely for the year . "
191210	191230	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" No , no ; not Diplow : Gadsmere . Sir Hugo knows , I 'll answer for it . "
191263	191445	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" Lush would not altogether own to it , of course . He 's a confident and go - between of Grandcourt 's . But I have it on the best authority . The fact is , there 's another lady with four children at Gadsmere . She has had the upper hand of him these ten years and more , and by what I can understand has it still left her husband for him , and used to travel with him everywhere . Her husband 's dead now ; I found a fellow who was in the same regiment with him , and knew this Mrs. Glasher before she took wing . A fiery dark - eyed woman a noted beauty at that time he thought she was dead . They say she has Grandcourt under her thumb still , and it 's a wonder he did n't marry her , for there 's a very fine boy , and I understand Grandcourt can do absolutely as he pleases with the estates . Lush told me as much as that . "
191446	191456	191458	191458	Deronda	289	" What right had he to marry this girl ? "
191482	191490	191492	191492	Deronda	289	" She can know nothing of it , "
191507	191516	191038	191039	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" Could she have known anything of it ? "
191517	191525	191527	191528	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" It 's rather a piquant picture , "
191529	191632	191527	191528	Mr. Vandernoodt	206	" Grandcourt between two fiery women . For depend upon it this light - haired one has plenty of devil in her . I formed that opinion of her at Leubronn . It 's a sort of Medea and Cre sa business . Fancy the two meeting ! Grandcourt is a new kind of Jason : I wonder what sort of a part he 'll make of it . It 's a dog 's part at best . I think I hear Ristori now , saying , ' Jasone ! Jasone ! ' These fine women generally get hold of a stick . "
191633	191641	191643	191643	Deronda	289	" Grandcourt can bite , I fancy , "
191645	191651	191643	191643	Deronda	289	" He is no stick . "
191652	191785	191817	191817	he	4848	" No , no ; I meant Jason . I ca n't quite make out Grandcourt . But he 's a keen fellow enough uncommonly well built too . And if he comes into all this property , the estates will bear dividing . This girl , whose friends had come to beggary , I understand , may think herself lucky to get him . I do n't want to be hard on a man because he gets involved in an affair of that sort . But he might make himself more agreeable . I was telling him a capital story last night , and he got up and walked away in the middle . I felt inclined to kick him . Do you suppose that is inattention or insolence , now ? "
191786	191805	191807	191807	Deronda	289	" Oh , a mixture . He generally observes the forms : but he does n't listen much , "
191821	191843	191817	191817	he	4848	" I should think there must be some exaggeration or inaccuracy in what you have heard about this lady at Gadsmere . "
191844	191917	191817	191817	he	4848	" Not a bit , depend upon it ; it has all lain snug of late years . People have forgotten all about it . But there the nest is , and the birds are in it . And I know Grandcourt goes there . I have good evidence that he goes there . However , that 's nobody 's business but his own . The affair has sunk below the surface . "
191918	191930	191932	191932	Deronda	289	" I wonder you could have learned so much about it , "
191937	192068	191817	191817	he	4848	" Oh , there are plenty of people who knew all about it ; but such stories get packed away like old letters . They interest me . I like to know the manners of my time contemporary gossip , not antediluvian . These Dryasdust fellows get a reputation by raking up some small scandal about Semiramis or Nitocris , and then we have a thousand and one poems written upon it by all the warblers big and little . But I do n't care a straw about the faux pas of the mummies . You do , though . You are one of the historical men more interested in a lady when she 's got a rag face and skeleton toes peeping out . Does that flatter your imagination ? "
192069	192095	191817	191817	he	4848	" Well , if she had any woes in her love , one has the satisfaction of knowing that she 's well out of them . "
192096	192109	191817	191817	he	4848	" Ah , you are thinking of the Medea , I see . "
192839	192845	192846	192846	he	4867	" Shall I be acceptable ? "
192849	192872	192846	192846	he	4867	" Perhaps I had better go back and look for the others . I suppose they are in the billiard - room . "
192873	192883	192885	192886	Lady Pentreath	554	" No , no ; stay where you are , "
192888	192906	192885	192886	Lady Pentreath	554	" They were all getting tired of me ; let us hear what you have to say . "
192907	192915	192917	192917	Deronda	289	" That is rather an embarrassing appeal , "
192934	192948	192949	192949	he	4867	" I think I had better take the opportunity of mentioning our songstress , "
192956	192963	192949	192949	he	4867	" unless you have done so . "
192964	192971	192973	192974	Lady Mallinger	371	" Oh , the little Jewess ! "
192976	192998	192973	192974	Lady Mallinger	371	" No , I have not mentioned her . It never entered my head that any one here wanted singing lessons . "
192999	193011	193013	193013	Deronda	289	" All ladies know some one else who wants singing lessons , "
193015	193025	193013	193013	Deronda	289	" I have happened to find an exquisite singer , "
193033	193081	193030	193031	Lady Pentreath	554	" She is living with some ladies who are friends of mine the mother and sisters of a man who was my chum at Cambridge . She was on the stage at Vienna ; but she wants to leave that life , and maintain herself by teaching . "
193082	193094	193096	193098	the old lady	4868	" There are swarms of those people , are n't there ? "
193100	193121	193096	193098	the old lady	4868	" Are her lessons to be very cheap or very expensive ? Those are the two baits I know of . "
193122	193133	193135	193135	Deronda	289	" There is another bait for those who hear her , "
193137	193176	193135	193135	Deronda	289	" Her singing is something quite exceptional , I think . She has had such first - rate teaching or rather first - rate instinct with her teaching that you might imagine her singing all came by nature . "
193177	193187	193189	193190	Lady Pentreath	554	" Why did she leave the stage , then ? "
193192	193211	193189	193190	Lady Pentreath	554	" I 'm too old to believe in first - rate people giving up first - rate chances . "
193212	193243	193245	193245	Deronda	289	" Her voice was too weak . It is a delicious voice for a room . You who put up with my singing of Schubert would be enchanted with hers , "
193252	193276	193249	193250	Mrs. Raymond	564	" And I imagine she would not object to sing at private parties or concerts . Her voice is quite equal to that . "
193277	193295	193297	193298	Lady Mallinger	371	" I am to have her in my drawing - room when we go up to town , "
193300	193332	193297	193298	Lady Mallinger	371	" You shall hear her then . I have not heard her myself yet ; but I trust Daniel 's recommendation . I mean my girls to have lessons of her . "
193333	193340	193342	193343	Lady Pentreath	554	" Is it a charitable affair ? "
193345	193353	193342	193343	Lady Pentreath	554	" I ca n't bear charitable music . "
193392	193410	193412	193412	Deronda	289	" It is a charity to those who want to have a good model of feminine singing , "
193414	193437	193439	193439	he	4869	" I think everybody who has ears would benefit by a little improvement on the ordinary style . If you heard Miss Lapidoth "
193443	193455	193439	193439	he	4869	" perhaps you would revoke your resolution to give up singing . "
193456	193467	193469	193469	Gwendolen	289	" I should rather think my resolution would be confirmed , "
193471	193487	193469	193469	Gwendolen	289	" I do n't feel able to follow your advice of enjoying my own middlingness . "
193488	193493	193495	193495	Deronda	289	" For my part , "
193497	193588	193495	193495	Deronda	289	" people who do anything finely always inspirit me to try . I do n't mean that they make me believe I can do it as well . But they make the thing , whatever it may be , seem worthy to be done . I can bear to think my own music not good for much , but the world would be more dismal if I thought music itself not good for much . Excellence encourages one about life generally ; it shows the spiritual wealth of the world . "
193589	193610	193612	193612	Gwendolen	289	" But then , if we ca n't imitate it , it only makes our own life seem the tamer , "
193626	193638	193640	193640	Deronda	289	" That depends on the point of view , I think , "
193642	193719	193640	193640	Deronda	289	" We should have a poor life of it if we were reduced for all our pleasure to our own performances . A little private imitation of what is good is a sort of private devotion to it , and most of us ought to practice art only in the light of private study preparation to understand and enjoy what the few can do for us . I think Miss Lapidoth is one of the few . "
193720	193734	193736	193736	Gwendolen	289	" She must be a very happy person , do n't you think ? "
193754	193760	193762	193764	the independent lady	4870	" I do n't know , "
193766	193778	193762	193764	the independent lady	4870	" I must hear more of her before I say that . "
193779	193798	193800	193801	Juliet Fenn	335	" It may have been a bitter disappointment to her that her voice failed her for the stage , "
193805	193816	193822	193823	Lady Pentreath	554	" I suppose she 's past her best , though , "
193825	193836	193838	193838	Deronda	289	" On the contrary , she has not reached it , "
193840	193846	193838	193838	Deronda	289	" She is barely twenty . "
193847	193852	193854	193855	Lady Mallinger	371	" And very pretty , "
193865	193899	193854	193855	Lady Mallinger	371	" And she has very good manners . I 'm sorry she 's a bigoted Jewess ; I should not like it for anything else , but it does n't matter in singing . "
193900	193928	193930	193931	Lady Pentreath	554	" Well , since her voice is too weak for her to scream much , I 'll tell Lady Clementina to set her on my nine granddaughters , "
193933	193972	193930	193931	Lady Pentreath	554	" and I hope she 'll convince eight of them that they have not voice enough to sing anywhere but at church . My notion is , that many of our girls nowadays want lessons not to sing . "
193973	193982	193984	193984	Gwendolen	289	" I have had my lessons in that , "
193990	194000	193984	193984	Gwendolen	289	" You see Lady Pentreath is on my side . "
194031	194048	194022	194029	the group at the low tea - table	4872	" What imposition is Deronda putting on you , ladies slipping in among you by himself ? "
194049	194064	194066	194067	Lady Pentreath	554	" Wanting to pass off an obscurity on us as better than any celebrity , "
194068	194098	194066	194067	Lady Pentreath	554	" a pretty singing Jewess who is to astonish these young people . You and I , who heard Catalani in her prime , are not so easily astonished . "
194123	194145	194109	194109	he	209	" Well , you know , a Liberal is bound to think that there have been singers since Catalani 's time . "
194146	194182	194103	194103	his	209	" Ah , you are younger than I am . I dare say you are one of the men who ran after Alcharisi . But she married off and left you all in the lurch . "
194183	194245	194247	194248	Sir Hugo	209	" Yes , yes ; it 's rather too bad when these great singers marry themselves into silence before they have a crack in their voices . And the husband is a public robber . I remember Leroux saying , ' A man might as well take down a fine peal of church bells and carry them off to the steppes , "
194397	194413	194390	194390	He	4874	" Are you relenting about the music and looking for something to play or sing ? "
194414	194427	194429	194429	Gwendolen	289	" I am not looking for anything , but I am relenting , "
194437	194444	194390	194390	He	4874	" May I know the reason ? "
194445	194491	194493	194493	Gwendolen	289	" I should like to hear Miss Lapidoth and have lessons from her , since you admire her so much , that is , of course , when we go to town . I mean lessons in rejoicing at her excellence and my own deficiency , "
194504	194518	194520	194520	Deronda	289	" I shall be really glad for you to see and hear her , "
194528	194542	194390	194390	He	4874	" Is she as perfect in every thing else as in her music ? "
194543	194618	194390	194390	He	4874	" I ca n't vouch for that exactly . I have not seen enough of her . But I have seen nothing in her that I could wish to be different . She has had an unhappy life . Her troubles began in early childhood , and she has grown up among very painful surroundings . But I think you will say that no advantages could have given her more grace and truer refinement . "
194619	194629	194390	194390	He	4874	" I wonder what sort of trouble hers were ? "
194630	194654	194390	194390	He	4874	" I have not any very precise knowledge . But I know that she was on the brink of drowning herself in despair . "
194655	194661	194663	194663	Gwendolen	289	" And what hindered her ? "
194671	194693	194694	194694	he	4878	" Some ray or other came which made her feel that she ought to live that it was good to live , "
194699	194721	194694	194694	he	4878	" She is full of piety , and seems capable of submitting to anything when it takes the form of duty . "
194722	194731	194733	194733	Gwendolen	289	" Those people are not to be pitied , "
194737	194759	194733	194733	Gwendolen	289	" I have no sympathy with women who are always doing right . I do n't believe in their great sufferings . "
194771	194776	194778	194778	Deronda	289	" It is true , "
194780	194842	194778	194778	Deronda	289	" that the consciousness of having done wrong is something deeper , more bitter . I suppose we faulty creatures can never feel so much for the irreproachable as for those who are bruised in the struggle with their own faults . It is a very ancient story , that of the lost sheep but it comes up afresh every day . "
194843	194861	194863	194863	Gwendolen	289	" That is a way of speaking it is not acted upon , it is not real , "
194867	194897	194863	194863	Gwendolen	289	" You admire Miss Lapidoth because you think her blameless , perfect . And you know you would despise a woman who had done something you thought very wrong . "
194898	194913	194915	194915	Deronda	289	" That would depend entirely upon her own view of what she had done , "
194917	194931	194933	194933	Gwendolen	289	" You would be satisfied if she were very wretched , I suppose , "
194937	195054	194933	194933	Gwendolen	289	" No , not satisfied full of sorrow for her . It was not a mere way of speaking . I did not mean to say that the finer nature is not more adorable ; I meant that those who would be comparatively uninteresting beforehand may become worthier of sympathy when they do something that awakens in them a keen remorse . Lives are enlarged in different ways . I dare say some would never get their eyes opened if it were not for a violent shock from the consequences of their own actions . And when they are suffering in that way one must care for them more than for the comfortably self - satisfied . "
195117	195130	195132	195133	Sir Hugo	209	" Are you persuading Mrs. Grandcourt to play to us , Dan ? "
195152	195159	195161	195161	Gwendolen	289	" I can not persuade myself , "
195566	195570	195571	195572	Sir Hugo	209	" young Grandcourt , "
195950	196000	195945	195946	Lady Pentreath	554	" I shall stand up for one dance , but I shall choose my partner . Mr. Deronda , you are the youngest man , I mean to dance with you . Nobody is old enough to make a good pair with me . I must have a contrast . "
196816	196831	196832	196832	she	289	" Yes ; I shall not dance any more . Are you not glad ? "
196839	196866	196832	196832	she	289	" you might have felt obliged humbly to offer yourself as a partner , and I feel sure you have danced more than you like already . "
196867	196874	196876	196876	Deronda	289	" I will not deny that , "
196889	196889	196832	196832	she	289	"
196890	196912	196832	196832	she	289	" But will you take trouble for me in another way , and fetch me a glass of that fresh water ? "
197020	197033	197035	197036	the husband	1134	" What is that hideous thing you have got on your wrist ? "
197038	197041	197043	197043	Gwendolen	289	" That ? "
197059	197082	197053	197053	she	289	" it is an old necklace I like to wear . I lost it once , and someone found it for me . "
197113	197157	197180	197180	He	1088	" It is worth while for you to go and look out at one of the windows on that side . You can see the finest possible moonlight on the stone pillars and carving , and shadows waving across it in the wind . "
197158	197170	197172	197172	Gwendolen	289	" I should like to see it . Will you go ? "
197191	197199	197203	197203	his	1088	" No , Deronda will take you , "
197264	197279	197261	197261	he	1088	" Will you take my arm and go , while only servants are there ? "
197624	197645	197622	197622	she	289	" Suppose I had gambled again , and lost the necklace again , what should you have thought of me ? "
197646	197653	197622	197622	she	289	" Worse than I do now . "
197654	197691	197622	197622	she	289	" Then you are mistaken about me . You wanted me not to do that not to make my gain out of another 's loss in that way and I have done a great deal worse . "
197692	197699	197701	197701	Deronda	289	" I ca n't imagine temptations , "
197703	197722	197701	197701	Deronda	289	" Perhaps I am able to understand what you mean . At least I understand self - reproach . "
197748	197772	197776	197776	she	289	" What should you do if you were like me feeling that you were wrong and miserable , and dreading everything to come ? "
197793	197808	197810	197810	Deronda	289	" That is not to be amended by doing one thing only but many , "
197814	197817	197819	197819	Gwendolen	289	" What ? "
197874	197898	197899	197899	She	289	" I mean there are many thoughts and habits that may help us to bear inevitable sorrow . Multitudes have to bear it . "
197912	197992	197901	197901	her	289	" You must tell me then what to think and what to do ; else why did you not let me go on doing as I liked and not minding ? If I had gone on gambling I might have won again , and I might have got not to care for anything else . You would not let me do that . Why should n't I do as I like , and not mind ? Other people do . "
198005	198018	198020	198020	Deronda	289	" I do n't believe you would ever get not to mind , "
198028	198108	198020	198020	Deronda	289	" If it were true that baseness and cruelty made an escape from pain , what difference would that make to people who ca n't be quite base or cruel ? Idiots escape some pain ; but you ca n't be an idiot . Some may do wrong to another without remorse ; but suppose one does feel remorse ? I believe you could never lead an injurious life all reckless lives are injurious , pestilential without feeling remorse . "
198136	198146	198148	198148	Gwendolen	289	" Then tell me what better I can do , "
198152	198217	198237	198237	she	289	" Many things . Look on other lives besides your own . See what their troubles are , and how they are borne . Try to care about something in this vast world besides the gratification of small selfish desires . Try to care for what is best in thought and action something that is good apart from the accidents of your own lot . "
198239	198249	198237	198237	she	289	" You mean that I am selfish and ignorant . "
198261	198272	198258	198258	he	4966	" You will not go on being selfish and ignorant ! "
198321	198328	198330	198330	Deronda	289	" Shall I lead you back ? "
198375	198392	198367	198367	Gwendolen	289	" I am ready to go now . Mr. Deronda will excuse us to Lady Mallinger . "
198393	198396	198398	198398	Deronda	289	" Certainly , "
198400	198410	198398	198398	Deronda	289	" Lord and Lady Pentreath disappeared some time ago . "
198437	198440	198427	198427	Gwendolen	289	" Thanks . "
198479	198483	198468	198468	himself	485	" Sit down . "
198515	198532	198513	198513	he	4966	" Oblige me in future by not showing whims like a mad woman in a play . "
198533	198539	198541	198541	Gwendolen	289	" What do you mean ? "
198543	198596	198513	198513	he	4966	" I suppose there is some understanding between you and Deronda about that thing you have on your wrist . If you have anything to say to him , say it . But do n't carry on a telegraphing which other people are supposed not to see . It 's damnably vulgar . "
198597	198606	198608	198608	Gwendolen	289	" You can know all about the necklace , "
198619	198634	198635	198635	Grandcourt	485	" I do n't want to know . Keep to yourself whatever you like . "
198657	198690	198644	198644	his	4966	" What I care to know I shall know without your telling me . Only you will please to behave as becomes my wife . And not make a spectacle of yourself . "
198691	198702	198513	198513	he	4966	" Do you object to my talking to Mr. Deronda ? "
198703	198768	198644	198644	his	4966	" I do n't care two straws about Deronda , or any other conceited hanger - on . You may talk to him as much as you like . He is not going to take my place . You are my wife . And you will either fill your place properly to the world and to me or you will go to the devil . "
198769	198781	198783	198783	Gwendolen	289	" I never intended anything but to fill my place properly , "
198792	198853	198783	198783	Gwendolen	289	" You put that thing on your wrist , and hid it from me till you wanted him to see it . Only fools go into that deaf and dumb talk , and think they 're secret . You will understand that you are not to compromise yourself . Behave with dignity . That 's all I have to say . "
199093	199098	199099	199099	he	4973	" Shall I ring ? "
199136	199149	199151	199151	he	4973	" The wrong you have done me will be your own curse . "
199169	199183	199151	199151	he	4973	" Why did you put your fangs into me and not into him ? "
199784	199788	199780	199780	her	289	" Mr. Deronda . "
199813	199821	199823	199823	Gwendolen	289	" Am I wrong to come in ? "
199825	199835	199837	199837	Deronda	289	" I thought you were far on your walk , "
199839	199844	199846	199846	Gwendolen	289	" I turned back , "
199848	199869	199823	199823	Gwendolen	289	" Do you intend to go out again ? I could join you now , if you would allow me . "
199870	199886	199888	199888	Gwendolen	289	" No ; I want to say something , and I ca n't stay long , "
199920	200017	199898	199898	she	289	" I want to tell you that it is really so I ca n't help feeling remorse for having injured others . That was what I meant when I said that I had done worse than gamble again and pawn the necklace again something more injurious , as you called it . And I ca n't alter it . I am punished , but I ca n't alter it . You said I could do many things . Tell me again . What should you do what should you feel if you were in my place ? "
200061	200073	200058	200058	Deronda	289	" I should feel something of what you feel deep sorrow . "
200074	200083	200085	200085	Gwendolen	289	" But what would you try to do ? "
200091	200114	200116	200116	Deronda	289	" Order my life so as to make any possible amends , and keep away from doing any sort of injury again , "
200129	200143	200145	200145	Gwendolen	289	" But I ca n't I ca n't ; I must go on , "
200153	200186	200145	200145	Gwendolen	289	" I have thrust out others I have made my gain out of their loss tried to make it tried . And I must go on . I ca n't alter it . "
200259	200365	200252	200252	he	4997	" That is the bitterest of all to wear the yoke of our own wrong - doing . But if you submitted to that as men submit to maiming or life - long incurable disease ? and made the unalterable wrong a reason for more effort toward a good , that may do something to counterbalance the evil ? One who has committed irremediable errors may be scourged by that consciousness into a higher course than is common . There are many examples . Feeling what it is to have spoiled one life may well make us long to save other lives from being spoiled . "
200366	200380	200382	200382	Gwendolen	289	" But you have not wronged any one , or spoiled their lives , "
200386	200396	200397	200397	Deronda	289	" It is only others who have wronged you . "
200404	200459	200397	200397	Deronda	289	" I suppose our keen feeling for ourselves might end in giving us a keen feeling for others , if , when we are suffering acutely , we were to consider that others go through the same sharp experience . That is a sort of remorse before commission . Ca n't you understand that ? "
200460	200467	200469	200469	Gwendolen	289	" I think I do now , "
200471	200510	200511	200511	she	289	" But you were right I am selfish . I have never thought much of any one 's feelings , except my mother 's . I have not been fond of people . But what can I do ? "
200518	200568	200569	200569	she	289	" I must get up in the morning and do what every one else does . It is all like a dance set beforehand . I seem to see all that can be and I am tired and sick of it . And the world is all confusion to me "
200576	200600	200569	200569	she	289	" You say I am ignorant . But what is the good of trying to know more , unless life were worth more ? "
200601	200605	200607	200607	Deronda	289	" This good , "
200628	200713	200618	200618	he	4999	" life would be worth more to you : some real knowledge would give you an interest in the world beyond the small drama of personal desires . It is the curse of your life forgive me of so many lives , that all passion is spent in that narrow round , for want of ideas and sympathies to make a larger home for it . Is there any single occupation of mind that you care about with passionate delight or even independent interest ? "
200739	200907	200734	200734	he	4999	" I take what you said of music for a small example it answers for all larger things you will not cultivate it for the sake of a private joy in it . What sort of earth or heaven would hold any spiritual wealth in it for souls pauperized by inaction ? If one firmament has no stimulus for our attention and awe , I do n't see how four would have it . We should stamp every possible world with the flatness of our own inanity which is necessarily impious , without faith or fellowship . The refuge you are needing from personal trouble is the higher , the religious life , which holds an enthusiasm for something more than our own appetites and vanities . The few may find themselves in it simply by an elevation of feeling ; but for us who have to struggle for our wisdom , the higher life must be a region in which the affections are clad with knowledge . "
200996	201005	200993	200993	she	289	" I will try . I will think . "
201055	201126	201127	201127	Her	289	" You said affection was the best thing , and I have hardly any none about me . If I could , I would have mamma ; but that is impossible . Things have changed to me so in such a short time . What I used not to like I long for now . I think I am almost getting fond of the old things now they are gone . "
201131	201144	201146	201146	Deronda	289	" Take the present suffering as a painful letting in of light , "
201151	201201	201146	201146	Deronda	289	" You are conscious of more beyond the round of your own inclinations you know more of the way in which your life presses on others , and their life on yours . I do n't think you could have escaped the painful process in some form or other . "
201202	201211	201213	201213	Gwendolen	289	" But it is a very cruel form , "
201225	201260	201261	201261	She	289	" I am frightened at everything . I am frightened at myself . When my blood is fired I can do daring things take any leap ; but that makes me frightened at myself . "
201288	201408	201409	201409	Deronda	289	" Turn your fear into a safeguard . Keep your dread fixed on the idea of increasing that remorse which is so bitter to you . Fixed meditation may do a great deal toward defining our longing or dread . We are not always in a state of strong emotion , and when we are calm we can use our memories and gradually change the bias of our fear , as we do our tastes . Take your fear as a safeguard . It is like quickness of hearing . It may make consequences passionately present to you . Try to take hold of your sensibility , and use it as if it were a faculty , like vision . "
201434	201446	201448	201448	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , I know ; I understand what you mean , "
201483	201521	201522	201522	She	289	" But if feelings rose there are some feelings hatred and anger how can I be good when they keep rising ? And if there came a moment when I felt stifled and could bear it no longer "
201631	201690	201629	201629	she	289	" I am grieving you . I am ungrateful . You can help me . I will think of everything . I will try . Tell me it will not be a pain to you that I have dared to speak of my trouble to you ? You began it , you know , when you rebuked me . "
201710	201720	201705	201705	she	289	" It will not be a pain to you ? "
201721	201736	201738	201738	Deronda	289	" Not if it does anything to save you from an evil to come , "
201744	201754	201738	201738	Deronda	289	" otherwise , it will be a lasting pain . "
201755	201778	201779	201779	She	289	" No no it shall not be . It may be it shall be better with me because I have known you . "
201888	201896	201898	201899	Sir Hugo	209	" Has Mrs. Grandcourt been in here ? "
201901	201907	201876	201876	He	209	" Yes , she has . "
201908	201914	201898	201899	Sir Hugo	209	" Where are the others ? "
201915	201926	201876	201876	He	209	" I believe she left them somewhere in the grounds . "
201947	201962	201945	201945	he	209	" I hope you are not playing with fire , Dan you understand me ? "
201963	201971	201973	201973	Deronda	289	" I believe I do , sir , "
201988	202007	201973	201973	Deronda	289	" But there is nothing answering to your metaphor no fire , and therefore no chance of scorching . "
202019	202042	202008	202009	Sir Hugo	209	" So much the better . For , between ourselves , I fancy there may be some hidden gunpowder in that establishment . "
202632	202645	202647	202647	Hans	406	" I knew you would like to see my casts and antiquities , "
202752	202752	202719	202719	you	5035	"
202753	202769	202771	202771	Deronda	289	" Only a fungoid growth , I dare say a growing disease in the lungs , "
202844	202852	202853	202853	he	406	" What do you think of them ? "
202858	202872	202874	202874	Deronda	289	" The full face looks too massive ; otherwise the likenesses are good , "
202884	202893	202895	202895	Hans	406	" No , it is not too massive , "
202899	202961	202962	202962	Hans	406	" I have noted that . There is always a little surprise when one passes from the profile to the full face . But I shall enlarge her scale for Berenice . I am making a Berenice series look at the sketches along there and now I think of it , you are just the model I want for the Agrippa . "
202995	203084	202984	202984	he	406	" No , no , I forgot ; you do n't like sitting for your portrait , confound you ! However , I 've picked up a capital Titus . There are to be five in the series . The first is Berenice clasping the knees of Gessius Florus and beseeching him to spare her people ; I 've got that on the easel . Then , this , where she is standing on the Xystus with Agrippa , entreating the people not to injure themselves by resistance . "
203085	203093	203095	203095	Deronda	289	" Agrippa 's legs will never do , "
203097	203104	203106	203106	Hans	406	" The legs are good realistically , "
203113	203143	203106	203106	Hans	406	" public men are often shaky about the legs ' Their legs , the emblem of their various thought , ' as somebody says in the ' Rehearsal . ' "
203144	203158	203160	203160	Deronda	289	" But these are as impossible as the legs of Raphael 's Alcibiades , "
203162	203169	203171	203171	Hans	406	" Then they are good ideally , "
203173	203240	203171	203171	Hans	406	" Agrippa 's legs were possibly bad ; I idealize that and make them impossibly bad . Art , my Eugenius , must intensify . But never mind the legs now : the third sketch in the series is Berenice exulting in the prospects of being Empress of Rome , when the news has come that Vespasian is declared Emperor and her lover Titus his successor . "
203241	203267	203106	203106	Hans	406	" You must put a scroll in her mouth , else people will not understand that . You ca n't tell that in a picture . "
203268	203324	203171	203171	Hans	406	" It will make them feel their ignorance then an excellent asthetic effect . The fourth is , Titus sending Berenice away from Rome after she has shared his palace for ten years both reluctant , both sad invitus invitam , as Suetonius hath it . I 've found a model for the Roman brute . "
203325	203339	203106	203106	Hans	406	" Shall you make Berenice look fifty ? She must have been that . "
203340	203432	203171	203171	Hans	406	" No , no ; a few mature touches to show the lapse of time . Dark - eyed beauty wears well , hers particularly . But now , here is the fifth : Berenice seated lonely on the ruins of Jerusalem . That is pure imagination . That is what ought to have been perhaps was . Now , see how I tell a pathetic negative . Nobody knows what became of her that is finely indicated by the series coming to a close . There is no sixth picture . "
203464	203541	203448	203448	his	406	" I break off in the Homeric style . The story is chipped off , so to speak , and passes with a ragged edge into nothing le nťant ; can anything be more sublime , especially in French ? The vulgar would desire to see her corpse and burial perhaps her will read and her linen distributed . But now come and look at this on the easel . I have made some way there . "
203542	203550	203552	203552	Deronda	289	" That beseeching attitude is really good , "
203560	203586	203552	203552	Deronda	289	" You have been very industrious in the Christmas holidays ; for I suppose you have taken up the subject since you came to London . "
203595	203598	203600	203600	Hans	406	" No , "
203608	203708	203600	203600	Hans	406	" I made up my mind to the subject before . I take that lucky chance for an augury that I am going to burst on the world as a great painter . I saw a splendid woman in the Trastevere the grandest women there are half Jewesses and she set me hunting for a fine situation of a Jewess at Rome . Like other men of vast learning , I ended by taking what lay on the surface . I 'll show you a sketch of the Trasteverina 's head when I can lay my hands on it . "
203709	203723	203725	203725	Deronda	289	" I should think she would be a more suitable model for Berenice , "
203736	203762	203725	203725	Deronda	289	" Not a bit of it . The model ought to be the most beautiful Jewess in the world , and I have found her . "
203763	203800	203600	203600	Hans	406	" Have you made yourself sure that she would like to figure in that character ? I should think no woman would be more abhorrent to her . Does she quite know what you are doing ? "
203801	203828	203725	203725	Deronda	289	" Certainly . I got her to throw herself precisely into this attitude . Little mother sat for Gessius Florus , and Mirah clasped her knees . "
203845	203857	203859	203859	Deronda	289	" I dare say she knows nothing about Berenice 's history , "
203873	203967	203725	203725	Deronda	289	" Oh , yes , she does ladies ' edition . Berenice was a fervid patriot , but was beguiled by love and ambition into attaching herself to the arch - enemy of her people . Whence the Nemesis . Mirah takes it as a tragic parable , and cries to think what the penitent Berenice suffered as she wandered back to Jerusalem and sat desolate amidst desolation . That was her own phrase . I could n't find it in my heart to tell her I invented that part of the story . "
203968	203974	203976	203976	Deronda	289	" Show me your Trasteverina , "
203989	203998	204000	204000	Hans	406	" Shall you mind turning over that folio ? "
204002	204030	204000	204000	Hans	406	" My studies of heads are all there . But they are in confusion . You will perhaps find her next to a crop - eared undergraduate . "
204046	204069	204044	204044	he	406	" These seem to be all Cambridge heads and bits of country . Perhaps I had better begin at the other end . "
204070	204088	204044	204044	he	406	" No ; you 'll find her about the middle . I emptied one folio into another . "
204089	204097	204099	204099	Deronda	289	" Is this one of your undergraduates ? "
204106	204114	204099	204099	Deronda	289	" It 's an unusually agreeable face . "
204115	204191	204044	204044	he	406	" That ! Oh , that 's a man named Gascoigne Rex Gascoigne . An uncommonly good fellow ; his upper lip , too , is good . I coached him before he got his scholarship . He ought to have taken honors last Easter . But he was ill , and has had to stay up another year . I must look him up . I want to know how he 's going on . "
204192	204200	204202	204202	Deronda	289	" Here she is , I suppose , "
204212	204215	204217	204217	Hans	406	" Ah , "
204225	204234	204217	204217	Hans	406	" too coarse . I was unregenerate then . "
204264	204289	204261	204261	he	5041	" I dare say my scruples are excessive , Meyrick , but I must ask you to oblige me by giving up this notion . "
204301	204355	204290	204290	Hans	406	" What ! my series my immortal Berenice series ? Think of what you are saying , man destroying , as Milton says , not a life but an immortality . Wait before you , answer , that I may deposit the implements of my art and be ready to uproot my hair . "
204416	204446	204414	204414	he	406	" Paint as many Berenices as you like , but I wish you could feel with me perhaps you will , on reflection that you should choose another model . "
204447	204450	204452	204452	Hans	406	" Why ? "
204462	204600	204414	204414	he	406	" Because she may get into such a position that her face is likely to be recognized . Mrs. Meyrick and I are anxious for her that she should be known as an admirable singer . It is right , and she wishes it , that she should make herself independent . And she has excellent chances . One good introduction is secured already , and I am going to speak to Klesmer . Her face may come to be very well known , and well , it is useless to attempt to explain , unless you feel as I do . I believe that if Mirah saw the circumstances clearly , she would strongly object to being exhibited in this way to allowing herself to be used as a model for a heroine of this sort . "
204655	204755	204651	204651	himself	406	" Excuse my laughing , Deronda . You never gave me an advantage over you before . If it had been about anything but my own pictures , I should have swallowed every word because you said it . And so you actually believe that I should get my five pictures hung on the line in a conspicuous position , and carefully studied by the public ? Zounds , man ! cider - cup and conceit never gave me half such a beautiful dream . My pictures are likely to remain as private as the utmost hypersensitiveness could desire . "
204882	205036	204874	204874	he	406	" But even supposing I had a public rushing after my pictures as if they were a railway series including nurses , babies and bonnet - boxes , I ca n't see any justice in your objection . Every painter worth remembering has painted the face he admired most , as often as he could . It is a part of his soul that goes out into his pictures . He diffuses its influence in that way . He puts what he hates into a caricature . He puts what he adores into some sacred , heroic form . If a man could paint the woman he loves a thousand times as the Stella Marts to put courage into the sailors on board a thousand ships , so much the more honor to her . Is n't that better than painting a piece of staring immodesty and calling it by a worshipful name ? "
205037	205065	205067	205067	Deronda	289	" Every objection can be answered if you take broad ground enough , Hans : no special question of conduct can be properly settled in that way , "
205075	205117	205067	205067	Deronda	289	" I might admit all your generalities , and yet be right in saying you ought not to publish Mirah 's face as a model for Berenice . But I give up the question of publicity . I was unreasonable there . "
205123	205235	205118	205118	Deronda	289	" Still , even as a private affair , there might be good reasons for your not indulging yourself too much in painting her from the point of view you mention . You must feel that her situation at present is a very delicate one ; and until she is in more independence , she should be kept as carefully as a bit of Venetian glass , for fear of shaking her out of the safe place she is lodged in . Are you quite sure of your own discretion ? Excuse me , Hans . My having found her binds me to watch over her . Do you understand me ? "
205236	205239	205241	205241	Hans	406	" Perfectly , "
205253	205424	205241	205241	Hans	406	" You have the very justifiable opinion of me that I am likely to shatter all the glass in my way , and break my own skull into the bargain . Quite fair . Since I got into the scrape of being born , everything I have liked best has been a scrape either for myself or somebody else . Everything I have taken to heartily has somehow turned into a scrape . My painting is the last scrape ; and I shall be all my life getting out of it . You think now I shall get into a scrape at home . No ; I am regenerate . You think I must be over head and ears in love with Mirah . Quite right ; so I am . But you think I shall scream and plunge and spoil everything . There you are mistaken excusably , but transcendently mistaken . I have undergone baptism by immersion . Awe takes care of me . Ask the little mother . "
205425	205439	205441	205441	Deronda	289	" You do n't reckon a hopeless love among your scrapes , then , "
205455	205465	205467	205467	Hans	406	" I do n't mean to call mine hopeless , "
205500	205513	205515	205515	Deronda	289	" My dear fellow , you are only preparing misery for yourself , "
205519	205551	205515	205515	Deronda	289	" She would not marry a Christian , even if she loved him . Have you heard her of course you have heard her speak of her people and her religion ? "
205552	205558	205560	205560	Hans	406	" That ca n't last , "
205562	205587	205560	205560	Hans	406	" She will see no Jew who is tolerable . Every male of that race is insupportable , ' insupportably advancing ' his nose . "
205588	205611	205515	205515	Deronda	289	" She may rejoin her family . That is what she longs for . Her mother and brother are probably strict Jews . "
205612	205623	205625	205625	Hans	406	" I 'll turn proselyte , if she wishes it , "
205634	205652	205654	205654	Deronda	289	" Do n't talk nonsense , Hans . I thought you professed a serious love for her , "
205659	205674	205515	205515	Deronda	289	" So I do . You think it desperate , but I do n't . "
205675	205727	205731	205731	he	406	" I know nothing ; I ca n't tell what has happened . We must be prepared for surprises . But I can hardly imagine a greater surprise to me than that there should have seemed to be anything in Mirah 's sentiments for you to found a romantic hope on . "
205736	205750	205752	205752	Hans	406	" I do n't found my romantic hopes on a woman 's sentiments , "
205767	205835	205752	205752	Hans	406	" I go to science and philosophy for my romance . Nature designed Mirah to fall in love with me . The amalgamation of races demands it the mitigation of human ugliness demands it the affinity of contrasts assures it . I am the utmost contrast to Mirah a bleached Christian , who ca n't sing two notes in tune . Who has a chance against me ? "
205836	205857	205859	205859	Deronda	289	" I see now ; it was all persiflage . You do n't mean a word you say , Meyrick , "
205878	205888	205859	205859	Deronda	289	" I was a wiseacre to answer you seriously . "
205889	205900	205902	205902	Hans	406	" Upon my honor I do mean it , though , "
205925	205988	205902	205902	Hans	406	" I am at the confessional . I meant to tell you as soon as you came . My mother says you are Mirah 's guardian , and she thinks herself responsible to you for every breath that falls on Mirah in her house . Well , I love her I worship her I wo n't despair I mean to deserve her . "
205989	206000	206002	206002	Deronda	289	" My dear fellow , you ca n't do it , "
206006	206017	205902	205902	Hans	406	" I should have said , I mean to try . "
206018	206042	205902	205902	Hans	406	" You ca n't keep your resolve , Hans . You used to resolve what you would do for your mother and sisters . "
206043	206055	206057	206057	Hans	406	" You have a right to reproach me , old fellow , "
206061	206067	206069	206069	Deronda	289	" Perhaps I am ungenerous , "
206076	206095	206069	206069	Deronda	289	" Yet it ca n't be ungenerous to warn you that you are indulging mad , Quixotic expectations . "
206096	206106	206108	206108	Hans	406	" Who will be hurt but myself , then ? "
206115	206211	206108	206108	Hans	406	" I am not going to say anything to her unless I felt sure of the answer . I dare not ask the oracles : I prefer a cheerful caliginosity , as Sir Thomas Browne might say . I would rather run my chance there and lose , than be sure of winning anywhere else . And I do n't mean to swallow the poison of despair , though you are disposed to thrust it on me . I am giving up wine , so let me get a little drunk on hope and vanity . "
206212	206226	206228	206228	Deronda	289	" With all my heart , if it will do you any good , "
206695	206720	206722	206722	Mirah	289	" He passes from one figure to another as if he were a bit of flame where you fancied the figures without seeing them , "
206729	206801	206722	206722	Mirah	289	" he is so wonderfully quick . I used never to like comic things on the stage they were dwelt on too long ; but all in one minute Mr. Hans makes himself a blind bard , and then Rienzi addressing the Romans , and then an opera - dancer , and then a desponding young gentleman I am sorry for them all , and yet I laugh , all in one "
206816	206828	206830	206831	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" We hardly thought that Mirah could laugh till Hans came , "
206846	206855	206857	206857	Deronda	289	" Hans seems in great force just now , "
206864	206874	206857	206857	Deronda	289	" I do n't wonder at his enlivening you . "
206875	206887	206889	206890	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" He 's been just perfect ever since he came back , "
206898	206905	206889	206890	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" if it will but last . "
206906	206913	206915	206915	Mirah	289	" It is a great happiness , "
206917	206970	206915	206915	Mirah	289	" to see the son and brother come into this dear home . And I hear them all talk about what they did together when they were little . That seems like heaven , and to have a mother and brother who talk in that way . I have never had it . "
206971	206975	206977	206977	Deronda	289	" Nor I , "
206981	206984	206986	206986	Mirah	289	" No ? "
206990	207004	206986	206986	Mirah	289	" I wish you had . I wish you had had every good . "
207292	207353	207289	207289	she	289	" But Mr. Hans said yesterday that you thought so much of others you hardly wanted anything for yourself . He told us a wonderful story of Buddha giving himself to the famished tigress to save her and her little ones from starving . And he said you were like Buddha . That is what we all imagine of you . "
207354	207361	207363	207363	Deronda	289	" Pray do n't imagine that , "
207375	207416	207363	207363	Deronda	289	" Even if it were true that I thought so much of others , it would not follow that I had no wants for myself . When Buddha let the tigress eat him he might have been very hungry himself . "
207417	207433	207435	207435	Mab	424	" Perhaps if he was starved he would not mind so much about being eaten , "
207439	207457	207459	207459	Mirah	289	" Please do n't think that , Mab ; it takes away the beauty of the action , "
207461	207470	207472	207474	the rational Amy	5065	" But if it were true , Mirah ? "
207485	207498	207472	207474	the rational Amy	5065	" you always take what is beautiful as if it were true . "
207499	207504	207506	207506	Mirah	289	" So it is , "
207510	207535	207506	207506	Mirah	289	" If people have thought what is the most beautiful and the best thing , it must be true . It is always there . "
207536	207546	207548	207548	Amy	423	" Now , Mirah , what do you mean ? "
207550	207555	207557	207557	Deronda	289	" I understand her , "
207564	207592	207593	207593	He	5066	" It is a truth in thought though it may never have been carried out in action . It lives as an idea . Is that it ? "
207610	207628	207630	207630	Mirah	289	" It must be that , because you understand me , but I can not quite explain , "
207640	207654	207656	207656	Amy	423	" But was it beautiful for Buddha to let the tiger eat him ? "
207662	207670	207656	207656	Amy	423	" It would be a bad pattern . "
207671	207681	207683	207683	Mab	424	" The world would get full of fat tigers , "
207693	207701	207702	207702	he	5066	" It is like a passionate word , "
207705	207731	207702	207702	he	5066	" the exaggeration is a flash of fervor . It is an extreme image of what is happening every day - the transmutation of self . "
207732	207744	207746	207746	Mirah	289	" I think I can say what I mean , now , "
207756	207798	207746	207746	Mirah	289	" When the best thing comes into our thoughts , it is like what my mother has been to me . She has been just as really with me as all the other people about me often more really with me . "
207826	207877	207799	207799	Deronda	289	" But we must not get too far away from practical matters . I came , for one thing , to tell of an interview I had yesterday , which I hope Mirah will find to have been useful to her . It was with Klesmer , the great pianist . "
207878	207881	207883	207884	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Ah ? "
207889	207897	207883	207884	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You think he will help her ? "
207898	207930	207977	207977	Deronda	289	" I hope so . He is very much occupied , but has promised to fix a time for receiving and hearing Miss Lapidoth , as we must learn to call her "
207936	207945	207932	207932	Deronda	289	" If she consents to go to him . "
207946	207953	207955	207955	Mirah	289	" I shall be very grateful , "
207957	207976	207955	207955	Mirah	289	" He wants to hear me sing , before he can judge whether I ought to be helped . "
207991	208018	207932	207932	Deronda	289	" It will not be at all trying to you , I hope , if Mrs. Meyrick will kindly go with you to Klesmer 's house . "
208019	208083	207932	207932	Deronda	289	" Oh , no , not at all trying . I have been doing that all my life I mean , told to do things that others may judge of me . And I have gone through a bad trial of that sort . I am prepared to bear it , and do some very small thing . Is Klesmer a severe man ? "
208084	208110	207932	207932	Deronda	289	" He is peculiar , but I have not had experience enough of him to know whether he would be what you would call severe . "
208111	208128	207932	207932	Deronda	289	" I know he is kind - hearted kind in action , if not in speech . "
208129	208142	208144	208144	Mirah	289	" I have been used to be frowned at and not praised , "
208146	208157	208159	208159	Deronda	289	" By the by , Klesmer frowns a good deal , "
208161	208196	208159	208159	Deronda	289	" but there is often a sort of smile in his eyes all the while . Unhappily he wears spectacles , so you must catch him in the right light to see the smile . "
208197	208204	208206	208206	Mirah	289	" I shall not be frightened , "
208208	208231	208206	208206	Mirah	289	" If he were like a roaring lion , he only wants me to sing . I shall do what I can . "
208232	208253	208255	208255	Deronda	289	" Then I feel sure you will not mind being invited to sing in Lady Mallinger 's drawing - room , "
208257	208287	208255	208255	Deronda	289	" She intends to ask you next month , and will invite many ladies to hear you , who are likely to want lessons from you for their daughters . "
208288	208295	208297	208298	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" How fast we are mounting ! "
208303	208315	208297	208298	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You never thought of getting grand so quickly , Mirah . "
208316	208328	208330	208330	Mirah	289	" I am a little frightened at being called Miss Lapidoth , "
208338	208345	208330	208330	Mirah	289	" Might I be called Cohen ? "
208346	208351	208353	208353	Deronda	289	" I understand you , "
208357	208418	208353	208353	Deronda	289	" But I assure you , you must not be called Cohen . The name is inadmissible for a singer . This is one of the trifles in which we must conform to vulgar prejudice . We could choose some other name , however such as singers ordinarily choose an Italian or Spanish name , which would suit your physique . "
208445	208491	208492	208492	she	289	" No . If Cohen will not do , I will keep the name I have been called by . I will not hide myself . I have friends to protect me . And now if my father were very miserable and wanted help no , "
208500	208553	208492	208492	she	289	" I should think , then , that he was perhaps crying as I used to see him , and had nobody to pity him , and I had hidden myself from him . He had none belonging to him but me . Others that made friends with him always left him . "
208554	208566	208568	208569	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Keep to what you feel right , my dear child , "
208571	208581	208568	208569	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I would not persuade you to the contrary . "
208611	208665	208605	208605	Deronda	289	" I am rather base to be angry with Hans . How can he help being in love with her ? But it is too absurdly presumptuous for him even to frame the idea of appropriating her , and a sort of blasphemy to suppose that she could possibly give herself to him . "

Solitude and darkness are my covering , And my heart a tomb ; Smite and shatter it , O Gabriel ! Shatter it as the clay of the founder Around the golden image . "

215636	215659	215630	215630	he	265	" I shall introduce you to Astorga : he is the foster - father of good singing and will give you advice . "
215668	215680	215665	215665	he	265	" Mrs. Klesmer will call before Wednesday , with your permission . "
215681	215692	215694	215695	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" We shall feel that to be a great kindness , "
215697	215704	215706	215706	Klesmer	623	" You will sing to her , "
215713	215743	215706	215706	Klesmer	623	" She is a thorough musician , and has a soul with more ears to it than you will often get in a musician . Your singing will satisfy her :
215757	215757	215752	215752	you	289	"
215758	215768	215770	215770	Mirah	289	" ' Sicher ist 's in alien Fšllen . ' "
215777	215780	215770	215770	Mirah	289	" SchŲn ! "
215833	215843	215829	215829	he	265	" That young lady is musical , I see ! "
215854	215857	215859	215859	Mirah	289	" Yes , "
215865	215872	215859	215859	Mirah	289	" And she has a touch . "
215873	215886	215888	215888	Mab	424	" Oh , please , Mirah a scramble , not a touch , "
215956	215971	215947	215947	Klesmer	623	" Will she like to accompany Miss Lapidoth and hear the music on Wednesday ? "
215972	215983	215985	215986	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" There could hardly be a greater pleasure for her , "
215988	215997	215985	215986	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" She will be most glad and grateful . "
216128	216178	216118	216118	He	5247	" She will do : if she does n't attempt too much and her voice holds out , she can make an income . I know that is the great point : Deronda told me . You are taking care of her . She looks like a good girl . "
216179	216185	216187	216191	the warm - hearted woman	5250	" She is an angel , "
216193	216196	216198	216198	Klesmer	623	" No , "
216232	216243	216223	216223	I	0	" he ended , bowing himself out in this amiable way .
216292	216304	216288	216288	Amy	423	" We can never get her a new dress before Wednesday ! "
216309	216319	216306	216306	Kate	422	" Thank heaven my table is not knocked over ! "
216347	216354	216356	216357	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Now , now , Mab ! "
216359	216370	216356	216357	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" come and sit down reasonably and let us talk ? "
216371	216378	216380	216380	Mab	424	" Yes , let us talk , "
216395	216437	216380	216380	Mab	424	" I am beginning to feel large again . Hans said he was coming this afternoon . I wish he had been here only there would have been no room for him . Mirah , what are you looking sad for ? "
216438	216444	216446	216446	Mirah	289	" I am too happy , "
216448	216466	216446	216446	Mirah	289	" I feel so full of gratitude to you all ; and he was so very kind . "
216467	216473	216475	216475	Mab	424	" Yes , at last , "
216479	216529	216475	216475	Mab	424	" But he might have said something encouraging sooner . I thought him dreadfully ugly when he sat frowning , and only said , ' Con tinue . ' I hated him all the long way from the top of his hair to the toe of his polished boot . "
216530	216541	216543	216543	Kate	422	" Nonsense , Mab ; he has a splendid profile , "
216545	216596	216598	216598	Mab	424	" Now , but not then . I can not bear people to keep their minds bottled up for the sake of letting them off with a pop . They seem to grudge making you happy unless they can make you miserable beforehand . However , I forgive him everything , "
216605	216648	216598	216598	Mab	424	" but he has invited me . I wonder why he fixed on me as the musical one ? Was it because I have a bulging forehead , ma , and peep from under it like a newt from under a stone ? "
216649	216662	216664	216665	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" It was your way of listening to the singing , child , "
216667	216699	216664	216665	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" He has magic spectacles and sees everything through them , depend upon it . But what was that German quotation you were so ready with , Mirah you learned puss ? "
216700	216708	216710	216710	Mirah	289	" Oh , that was not learning , "
216721	216755	216712	216712	her	289	" I said it so many times for a lesson . It means that it is safer to do anything singing or anything else before those who know and understand all about it . "
216756	216770	216772	216772	Amy	423	" That was why you were not one bit frightened , I suppose , "
216774	216792	216772	216772	Amy	423	" But now , what we have to talk about is a dress for you on Wednesday . "
216793	216805	216807	216807	Mirah	289	" I do n't want anything better than this black merino , "
216815	216824	216825	216825	She	289	" Some white gloves and some new bottines . "
216839	216844	216846	216847	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" There comes Hans , "
216849	216875	216846	216847	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Stand still , and let us hear what he says about the dress . Artists are the best people to consult about such things . "
216876	216885	216887	216887	Kate	422	" You do n't consult me , ma , "
216898	216918	216887	216887	Kate	422	" I notice mothers are like the people I deal with the girls ' doings are always priced low . "
216919	216949	216951	216952	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" My dear child , the boys are such a trouble we could never put up with them , if we did n't make believe they were worth more , "
216960	217005	216951	216952	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Hans , we want your opinion about Mirah 's dress . A great event has happened . Klesmer has been here , and she is going to sing at his house on Wednesday among grand people . She thinks this dress will do . "
217006	217011	217013	217013	Hans	606	" Let me see , "
217049	217063	217064	217064	she	289	" This would be thought a very good stage - dress for me , "
217069	217089	217064	217064	she	289	" in a part where I was to come on as a poor Jewess and sing to fashionable Christians . "
217090	217096	217098	217098	Hans	606	" It would be effective , "
217105	217116	217098	217098	Hans	606	" it would stand out well among the fashionable chiffons . "
217117	217133	217135	217135	Amy	423	" But you ought not to claim all the poverty on your side , Mirah , "
217137	217152	217135	217135	Amy	423	" There are plenty of poor Christians and dreadfully rich Jews and fashionable Jewesses . "
217153	217161	217163	217163	Mirah	289	" I did n't mean any harm , "
217165	217193	217163	217163	Mirah	289	" Only I have been used to thinking about my dress for parts in plays . And I almost always had a part with a plain dress . "
217194	217202	217204	217204	Hans	606	" That makes me think it questionable , "
217231	217258	217259	217259	Hans	606	" It looks a little too theatrical . We must not make you a rŰle of the poor Jewess or of being a Jewess at all . "
217282	217304	217306	217306	Mirah	289	" But it is what I am really . I am not pretending anything . I shall never be anything else , "
217308	217316	217306	217306	Mirah	289	" I always feel myself a Jewess . "
217317	217327	217329	217329	Hans	606	" But we ca n't feel that about you , "
217336	217351	217329	217329	Hans	606	" What does it signify whether a perfect woman is a Jewess or not ? "
217352	217369	217371	217371	Mirah	289	" That is your kind way of praising me ; I never was praised so before , "
217393	217405	217406	217406	he	606	" People do n't think of me as a British Christian , "
217414	217430	217406	217406	he	606	" They think of me as an imperfectly handsome young man and an unpromising painter . "
217431	217440	217442	217442	Amy	423	" But you are wandering from the dress , "
217444	217466	217442	217442	Amy	423	" If that will not do , how are we to get another before Wednesday ? and to - morrow Sunday ? "
217467	217473	217475	217475	Mirah	289	" Indeed this will do , "
217479	217488	217475	217475	Mirah	289	" It is all real , you know , "
217494	217527	217490	217490	she	289	" even if it seemed theatrical . Poor Berenice sitting on the ruins any one might say that was theatrical , but I know that this is just what she would do . "
217528	217534	217536	217536	Hans	606	" I am a scoundrel , "
217544	217567	217536	217536	Hans	606	" That is my invention . Nobody knows that she did that . Shall you forgive me for not saying so before ? "
217568	217573	217575	217575	Mirah	289	" Oh , yes , "
217584	217648	217575	217575	Mirah	289	" You knew it was what she would be sure to do a Jewess who had not been faithful who had done what she did and was penitent . She could have no joy but to afflict herself ; and where else would she go ? I think it is very beautiful that you should enter so into what a Jewess would feel . "
217649	217659	217661	217661	Hans	606	" The Jewesses of that time sat on ruins , "
217672	217680	217661	217661	Hans	606	" That makes them convenient for pictures . "
217681	217688	217690	217690	Amy	423	" But the dress the dress , "
217692	217697	217690	217690	Amy	423	" is it settled ? "
217698	217705	217707	217707	Mirah	289	" Yes ; is it not ? "
217728	217736	217717	217717	her	418	" What do you think , Hans ? "
217737	217744	217746	217746	Hans	606	" That dress will not do , "
217750	217818	217746	217746	Hans	606	" She is not going to sit on ruins . You must jump into a cab with her , little mother , and go to Regent Street . It 's plenty of time to get anything you like a black silk dress such as ladies wear . She must not be taken for an object of charity . She has talents to make people indebted to her . "
217819	217837	217839	217840	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I think it is what Mr. Deronda would like for her to have a handsome dress , "
217844	217850	217852	217852	Hans	606	" Of course it is , "
217858	217871	217852	217852	Hans	606	" You may take my word for what a gentleman would feel . "
217872	217886	217888	217888	Mirah	289	" I wish to do what Mr. Deronda would like me to do , "
217929	217945	217947	217947	Kate	422	" Should n't you like to make a study of Klesmer 's head , Hans ? "
217949	217958	217947	217947	Kate	422	" I suppose you have often seen him ? "
217959	217963	217965	217965	Hans	606	" Seen him ! "
218023	218045	218008	218008	he	606	" Perhaps you do n't like this mimicry ; you must always stop my nonsense when you do n't like it . "
218075	218100	218101	218101	she	289	" Thank you . But you have never done anything I did not like . I hardly think he could , belonging to you , "
218144	218224	218225	218225	WORDSWORTH	479	" Within the soul a faculty abides , That with interpositions , which would hide And darken , so can deal , that they become Contingencies of pomp ; and serve to exalt Her native brightness , as the ample moon . In the deep stillness of a summer even . Rising behind a thick and lofty grove . Into a substance glorious as her own , Yea , with her own incorporated , by power Capacious and serene . "
218517	218534	218536	218536	Deronda	289	" I suppose if I got from this man the information I am most anxious about , "
218538	218700	218536	218536	Deronda	289	" I should be contented enough if he felt no disposition to tell me more of himself , or why he seemed to have some expectation from me which was disappointed . The sort of curiosity he stirs would die out ; and yet it might be that he had neared and parted as one can imagine two ships doing , each freighted with an exile who would have recognized the other if the two could have looked out face to face . Not that there is any likelihood of a peculiar tie between me and this poor fellow , whose voyage , I fancy , must soon be over . But I wonder whether there is much of that momentous mutual missing between people who interchange blank looks , or even long for one another 's absence in a crowded place . However , one makes one 's self chances of missing by going on the recruiting sergeant 's plan . "
219124	219135	219137	219137	Deronda	289	" I was very glad to see you standing here , "
219139	219169	219137	219137	Deronda	289	" for I was intending to go on to the book - shop and look for you again . I was there yesterday perhaps they mentioned it to you ? "
219170	219173	219175	219175	Mordecai	538	" Yes , "
219177	219188	219175	219175	Mordecai	538	" that was the reason I came to the bridge . "
219224	219234	219235	219235	he	538	" You knew nothing of my being at Chelsea ? "
219242	219265	219266	219266	Mordecai	538	" No ; but I expected you to come down the river . I have been waiting for you these five years . "
219323	219342	219343	219343	he	538	" It will be a satisfaction to me if I can be of any real use to you , "
219349	219376	219343	219343	he	538	" Shall we get into a cab and drive to wherever you wish to go ? You have probably had walking enough with your short breath . "
219377	219405	219407	219407	Mordecai	538	" Let us go to the book - shop . It will soon be time for me to be there . But now look up the river , "
219448	219607	219446	219446	Deronda	289	" See the sky , how it is slowly fading . I have always loved this bridge : I stood on it when I was a little boy . It is a meeting - place for the spiritual messengers . It is true what the Masters said that each order of things has its angel : that means the full message of each from what is afar . Here I have listened to the messages of earth and sky ; when I was stronger I used to stay and watch for the stars in the deep heavens . But this time just about sunset was always what I loved best . It has sunk into me and dwelt with me fading , slowly fading : it was my own decline : it paused it waited , till at last it brought me my new life my new self who will live when this breath is all breathed out . "
219686	219689	219661	219661	His	538	" madness , "
219818	219824	219815	219815	he	5288	" Let us go now , "
219833	219870	219830	219830	he	5288	" We will get down at the end of the street and walk to the shop . You can look at the books , and Mr. Ram will be going away directly and leave us alone . "
219901	219908	219892	219892	he	5288	" a man of the world . "
219977	220075	219973	219973	he	5288	" I suppose I am in a state of complete superstition , just as if I were awaiting the destiny that could interpret the oracle . But some strong relation there must be between me and this man , since he feels it strongly . Great heaven ! what relation has proved itself more potent in the world than faith even when mistaken than expectation even when perpetually disappointed ? Is my side of the relation to be disappointing or fulfilling ? well , if it is ever possible for me to fulfill I will not disappoint . "
220170	220173	220160	220160	I	0	" Tribute Money "
220347	220351	220344	220344	she	5303	" My boy ! "
220576	220599	220571	220571	He	538	" You can not know what has guided me to you and brought us together at this moment . You are wondering . "
220600	220606	220608	220608	Deronda	289	" I am not impatient , "
220610	220624	220608	220608	Deronda	289	" I am ready to listen to whatever you may wish to disclose . "
220625	220637	220646	220646	he	538	" You see some of the reasons why I needed you , "
220653	220720	220646	220646	he	538	" You see that I am dying . You see that I am as one shut up behind bars by the wayside , who if he spoke to any would be met only by head - shaking and pity . The day is closing the light is fading soon we should not have been able to discern each other . But you have come in time . "
220721	220731	220733	220733	Deronda	289	" I rejoice that I am come in time , "
220742	220752	220737	220737	He	538	" I hope you are not mistaken in me , "
220756	220759	220760	220760	he	538	" mistaken , "
220771	220784	220786	220786	Mordecai	538	" But the hidden reasons why I need you began afar off , "
220788	220879	220786	220786	Mordecai	538	" began in my early years when I was studying in another land . Then ideas , beloved ideas , came to me , because I was a Jew . They were a trust to fulfill , because I was a Jew . They were an inspiration , because I was a Jew , and felt the heart of my race beating within me . They were my life ; I was not fully born till then . I counted this heart , and this breath , and this right hand "
220899	221007	220880	220880	Mordecai	538	" I counted my sleep and my waking , and the work I fed my body with , and the sights that fed my eyes I counted them but as fuel to the divine flame . But I had done as one who wanders and engraves his thought in rocky solitudes , and before I could change my course came care and labor and disease , and blocked the way before me , and bound me with the iron that eats itself into the soul . Then I said , ' How shall I save the life within me from being stifled with this stifled breath ? ' "
221064	221422	221061	221061	Mordecai	538	" But you may misunderstand me . I speak not as an ignorant dreamer as one bred up in the inland valleys , thinking ancient thoughts anew , and not knowing them ancient , never having stood by the great waters where the world 's knowledge passes to and fro . English is my mother - tongue , England is the native land of this body , which is but as a breaking pot of earth around the fruit - bearing tree , whose seed might make the desert rejoice . But my true life was nourished in Holland at the feet of my mother 's brother , a Rabbi skilled in special learning : and when he died I went to Hamburg to study , and afterwards to GŲttingen , that I might take a larger outlook on my people , and on the Gentile world , and drank knowledge at all sources . I was a youth ; I felt free ; I saw our chief seats in Germany ; I was not then in utter poverty . And I had possessed myself of a handicraft . For I said , I care not if my lot be as that of Joshua ben Chananja : after the last destruction he earned his bread by making needles , but in his youth he had been a singer on the steps of the Temple , and had a memory of what was before the glory departed . I said , let my body dwell in poverty , and my hands be as the hands of the toiler : but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance where the treasures of knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope . I knew what I chose . They said , ' He feeds himself on visions , ' and I denied not ; for visions are the creators and feeders of the world . I see , I measure the world as it is , which the vision will create anew . You are not listening to one who raves aloof from the lives of his fellows . "
221438	221491	221427	221427	Deronda	289	" Do me the justice to believe that I was not inclined to call your words raving . I listen that I may know , without prejudgment . I have had experience which gives me a keen interest in the story of a spiritual destiny embraced willingly , and embraced in youth . "
221492	221501	221502	221502	Mordecai	538	" A spiritual destiny embraced willingly in youth ? "
221509	221675	221502	221502	Mordecai	538	" It was the soul fully born within me , and it came in my boyhood . It brought its own world a mediaeval world , where there are men who made the ancient language live again in new psalms of exile . They had absorbed the philosophy of the Gentile into the faith of the Jew , and they still yearned toward a center for our race . One of their souls was born again within me , and awakened amid the memories of their world . It traveled into Spain and Provence ; it debated with Aben - Ezra ; it took ship with Jehuda ha - Levi ; it heard the roar of the Crusaders and the shrieks of tortured Israel . And when its dumb tongue was loosed , it spoke the speech they had made alive with the new blood of their ardor , their sorrow , and their martyred trust : it sang with the cadence of their strain . "
221689	221703	221676	221676	Mordecai	538	" While it is imprisoned in me , it will never learn another . "
221704	221714	221716	221716	Deronda	289	" Have you written entirely in Hebrew , then ? "
221734	221738	221740	221740	Mordecai	538	" Yes yes , "
221749	222063	221740	221740	Mordecai	538	" in my youth I wandered toward that solitude , not feeling that it was a solitude . I had the ranks of the great dead around me ; the martyrs gathered and listened . But soon I found that the living were deaf to me . At first I saw my life spread as a long future : I said part of my Jewish heritage is an unbreaking patience ; part is skill to seek divers methods and find a rooting - place where the planters despair . But there came new messengers from the Eternal . I had to bow under the yoke that presses on the great multitude born of woman : family troubles called me I had to work , to care , not for myself alone . I was left solitary again ; but already the angel of death had turned to me and beckoned , and I felt his skirts continually on my path . I loosed not my effort . I besought hearing and help . I spoke ; I went to men of our people to the rich in influence or knowledge , to the rich in other wealth . But I found none to listen with understanding . I was rebuked for error ; I was offered a small sum in charity . No wonder . I looked poor ; I carried a bundle of Hebrew manuscript with me ; I said , our chief teachers are misleading the hope of our race . Scholar and merchant were both too busy to listen . Scorn stood as interpreter between me and them . One said , ' The book of Mormon would never have answered in Hebrew ; and if you mean to address our learned men , it is not likely you can teach them anything . ' He touched a truth there . "
222076	222097	222099	222099	Deronda	289	" But though you had accustomed yourself to write in Hebrew , few , surely , can use English better , "
222125	222214	222119	222119	his	538	" Too late too late . I can write no more . My writing would be like this gasping breath . But the breath may wake the fount of pity the writing not . If I could write now and used English , I should be as one who beats a board to summon those who have been used to no signal but a bell . My soul has an ear to hear the faults of its own speech . New writing of mine would be like this body "
222219	222263	222217	222217	his	538	" within it there might be the Ruach - ha - kodesh the breath of divine thought but , men would smile at it and say , ' A poor Jew ! ' and the chief smilers would be of my own people . "
222315	222326	222328	222328	Deronda	289	" I feel with you I feel strongly with you , "
222348	222397	222328	222328	Deronda	289	" But forgive me if I speak hastily for what you have actually written there need be no utter burial . The means of publication are within reach . If you will rely on me , I can assure you of all that is necessary to that end . "
222398	222404	222406	222406	Mordecai	538	" That is not enough , "
222422	222471	222406	222406	Mordecai	538	" That is not all my trust in you . You must be not only a hand to me , but a soul believing my belief being moved by my reasons hoping my hope - seeing the vision I point to beholding a glory where I behold it ! "
222527	222639	222524	222524	he	538	" You will be my life : it will be planted afresh ; it will grow . You shall take the inheritance ; it has been gathering for ages . The generations are crowding on my narrow life as a bridge : what has been and what is to be are meeting there ; and the bridge is breaking . But I have found you . You have come in time , You will take the inheritance which the base son refuses because of the tombs which the plow and harrow may not pass over or the gold - seeker disturb : you will take the sacred inheritance of the Jew . "
222815	222843	222801	222801	he	538	" Do you forget what I told you when we first saw each other ? Do you remember that I said I was not of your race ? "
222844	222851	222852	222852	Mordecai	538	" It ca n't be true , "
222899	222905	222887	222887	Deronda	289	" It ca n't be true "
222962	222972	222995	222995	Mordecai	538	" You are not sure of your own origin . "
222973	222980	222982	222982	Daniel	197	" How do you know that ? "
223013	223027	223029	223029	Mordecai	538	" I know it I know it ; what is my life else ? "
223038	223049	223029	223029	Mordecai	538	" Tell me everything : tell me why you deny ? "
223195	223229	223179	223179	he	197	" I have never known my mother . I have no knowledge about her . I have never called any man father . But I am convinced that my father is an Englishman . "
223291	223301	223303	223303	Mordecai	538	" It will be seen it will be declared , "
223307	223404	223303	223303	Mordecai	538	" The world grows , and its frame is knit together by the growing soul ; dim , dim at first , then clearer and more clear , the consciousness discerns remote stirrings . As thoughts move within us darkly , and shake us before they are fully discerned so events so beings : they are knit with us in the growth of the world . You have risen within me like a thought not fully spelled ; my soul is shaken before the words are all there . The rest will come it will come . "
223406	223430	223432	223432	Deronda	289	" We must not lose sight of the fact that the outward event has not always been a fulfillment of the firmest faith , "
223527	223558	223560	223560	Mordecai	538	" You would remind me that I may be under an illusion that the history of our people 's trust has been full of illusion . I face it all . "
223581	223603	223573	223573	he	538	" So it might be with my trust , if you would make it an illusion . But you will not . "
223630	223642	223643	223643	he	538	" What my birth was does not lie in my will , "
223646	223738	223643	223643	he	538	" My sense of claims on me can not be independent of my knowledge there . And I can not promise you that I will try to hasten a disclosure . Feelings which have struck root through half my life may still hinder me from doing what I have never been able to do . Everything must be waited for . I must know more of the truth about my own life , and I must know more of what it would become if it were made a part of yours . "
223761	224079	223742	223742	his	538	" You shall know . What are we met for , but that you should know . Your doubts lie as light as dust on my belief . I know the philosophies of this time and of other times ; if I chose I could answer a summons before their tribunals . I could silence the beliefs which are the mother - tongue of my soul and speak with the rote - learned language of a system , that gives you the spelling of all things , sure of its alphabet covering them all . I could silence them : may not a man silence his awe or his love , and take to finding reasons , which others demand ? But if his love lies deeper than any reasons to be found ? Man finds his pathways : at first they were foot tracks , as those of the beast in the wilderness : now they are swift and invisible : his thought dives through the ocean , and his wishes thread the air : has he found all the pathways yet ? What reaches him , stays with him , rules him : he must accept it , not knowing its pathway . Say , my expectation of you has grown but as false hopes grow . That doubt is in your mind ? Well , my expectation was there , and you are come . Men have died of thirst . But I was thirsty , and the water is on my lips ! What are doubts to me ? In the hour when you come to me and say , ' I reject your soul : I know that I am not a Jew : we have no lot in common ' I shall not doubt . I shall be certain certain that I have been deluded . That hour will never come ! "
224284	224333	224281	224281	He	5319	" It is my wish to meet and satisfy your wishes wherever that is possible to me . It is certain to me at least that I desire not to undervalue your toil and your suffering . Let me know your thoughts . But where can we meet ? "
224334	224341	224343	224343	Mordecai	538	" I have thought of that , "
224345	224367	224343	224343	Mordecai	538	" It is not hard for you to come into this neighborhood later in the evening ? You did so once . "
224368	224377	224379	224379	Deronda	289	" I can manage it very well occasionally , "
224381	224395	224379	224379	Deronda	289	" You live under the same roof with the Cohens , I think ? "
224693	224706	224708	224708	Mordecai	538	" We ca n't meet there : my room is too narrow , "
224722	224768	224708	224708	Mordecai	538	" But there is a tavern not far from here where I sometimes go to a club . It is the Hand and Banner , in the street at the next turning , five doors down . We can have the parlor there any evening . "
224769	224777	224779	224779	Deronda	289	" We can try that for once , "
224781	224807	224779	224779	Deronda	289	" But you will perhaps let me provide you with some lodging , which would give you more freedom and comfort than where you are . "
224808	224871	224708	224708	Mordecai	538	" No ; I need nothing . My outer life is as nought . I will take nothing less precious from you than your soul 's brotherhood . I will think of nothing else yet . But I am glad you are rich . You did not need money on that diamond ring . You had some other motive for bringing it . "
224890	224922	224923	224923	he	538	" it is all one . Had you been in need of the money , the great end would have been that we should meet again . But you are rich ? "
224932	224954	224982	224982	he	538	" Not rich , except in the sense that every one is rich who has more than he needs for himself . "
224955	224965	224967	224967	Mordecai	538	" I desired that your life should be free , "
224970	224977	224967	224967	Mordecai	538	" mine has been a bondage . "
225028	225049	225019	225019	Deronda	289	" Can you tell me why Mrs. Cohen , the mother , must not be spoken to about her daughter ? "
225121	225174	225099	225099	he	538	" I know the reason . But I will not speak even of trivial family affairs which I have heard in the privacy of the family . I dwell in their tent as in a sanctuary . Their history , so far as they injure none other , is their own possession . "
225280	225288	225289	225289	he	538	" I will part from you now , "
225318	225325	225326	225326	he	538	" When will you come back ? "
225333	225379	225302	225302	Mordecai	538	" May I leave that unfixed ? May I ask for you at the Cohens ' any evening after your hour at the book - shop ? There is no objection , I suppose , to their knowing that you and I meet in private ? "
225380	225383	225385	225385	Mordecai	538	" None , "
225387	225422	225385	225385	Mordecai	538	" But the days I wait now are longer than the years of my strength . Life shrinks : what was but a tithe is now the half . My hope abides in you . "
225423	225429	225431	225431	Deronda	289	" I will be faithful , "
225441	225464	225431	225431	Deronda	289	" I will come the first evening I can after seven : on Saturday or Monday , if possible . Trust me . "
225494	225507	225488	225488	he	538	" This is come to pass , and the rest will come . "
225521	225550	225551	225551	ARISTOTLE	636	" This , too is probable , according to that saying of Agathon : ' It is a part of probability that many improbable things will happen . ' "
225960	226337	225954	225955	Sir Hugo	209	" A consumptive Jew , possessed by a fanaticism which obstacles and hastening death intensified , had fixed on Deronda as the antitype of some visionary image , the offspring of wedded hope and despair : despair of his own life , irrepressible hope in the propagation of his fanatical beliefs . The instance was perhaps odd , exceptional in its form , but substantially it was not rare . Fanaticism was not so common as bankruptcy , but taken in all its aspects it was abundant enough . While Mordecai was waiting on the bridge for the fulfillment of his visions , another man was convinced that he had the mathematical key of the universe which would supersede Newton , and regarded all known physicists as conspiring to stifle his discovery and keep the universe locked ; another , that he had the metaphysical key , with just that hair's - breadth of difference from the old wards which would make it fit exactly . Scattered here and there in every direction you might find a terrible person , with more or less power of speech , and with an eye either glittering or preternaturally dull , on the look - out for the man who must hear him ; and in most cases he had volumes which it was difficult to get printed , or if printed to get read . This Mordecai happened to have a more pathetic aspect , a more passionate , penetrative speech than was usual with such monomaniacs ; he was more poetical than a social reformer with colored views of the new moral world in parallelograms , or than an enthusiast in sewage ; still he came under the same class . It would be only right and kind to indulge him a little , to comfort him with such help as was practicable ; but what likelihood was there that his notions had the sort of value he ascribed to them ? In such cases a man of the world knows what to think beforehand . And as to Mordecai 's conviction that he had found a new executive self , it might be preparing for him the worst of disappointments that which presents itself as final . "
226396	226404	226412	226414	the first believer	5348	" Great benefactors of mankind , deliverers , "
226597	226612	226594	226594	we	5352	" Let the ages try the spirits , and see what they are worth ? "
226836	226864	226829	226831	this eager soul	5357	" You must believe my beliefs be moved by my reasons hope my hopes see the vision I point to behold a glory where I behold it ! "
228043	228064	228066	228066	Deronda	289	" My contempt for them binds me to see that I do n't adopt their mistake on a small scale , "
228068	228304	228066	228066	Deronda	289	" and make myself deaf with the assumption that there can not be any momentous relation between this Jew and me , simply because he has clad it in illusory notions . What I can be to him , or he to me , may not at all depend on his persuasion about the way we came together . To me the way seems made up of plainly discernible links . If I had not found Mirah , it is probable that I should not have begun to be specially interested in the Jews , and certainly I should not have gone on that loitering search after an Ezra Cohen which made me pause at Ram 's book - shop and ask the price of Maimon . Mordecai , on his side , had his visions of a disciple , and he saw me by their light ; I corresponded well enough with the image his longing had created . He took me for one of his race . Suppose that his impression the elderly Jew at Frankfort seemed to have something like it suppose in spite of all presumptions to the contrary , that his impression should somehow be proved true , and that I should come actually to share any of the ideas he is devoted to ? This is the only question which really concerns the effect of our meeting on my life .
228305	228385	228386	228387	Here Deronda	289	" But if the issue should be quite different ? well , there will be something painful to go through . I shall almost inevitably have to be an active cause of that poor fellow 's crushing disappointment . Perhaps this issue is the one I had need prepare myself for . I fear that no tenderness of mine can make his suffering lighter . Would the alternative that I should not disappoint him be less painful to me ? "
228497	228502	228503	228503	He	5398	" The bare possibility . "
228556	228562	228551	228551	Deronda	289	" I should be glad . "
228768	228847	228848	228848	ZUNZ	643	" Wenn es eine Stutenleiter von Leiden giebt , so hat Israel die hŲchste Staffel erstiegen ; wen die Dauer der Schmerzen und die Geduld , mit welcher sie ertragen werden , adeln , so nehmen es die Juden mit den Hochgeborenen aller Lšnder auf ; wenn eine Literatur reich genannt wird , die wenige klassische Trauerspiele besitzt , welcher Platz geb hrt dann einer Tragodie die anderthalb Jahrtausende wahrt , gedichtet und dargestellt von den Helden selber ? "
228856	228936	228848	228848	ZUNZ	643	" If there are ranks in suffering , Israel takes precedence of all the nations if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they are borne ennoble , the Jews are among the aristocracy of every land if a literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic tragedies , what shall we say to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years , in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes ? "

229422	229429	229420	229420	Deronda	289	" Is Mordecai in just now ? "
229430	229437	229439	229439	Cohen	538	" Where is he , Addy ? "
229454	229460	229462	229463	his wife	1156	" In the workroom there , "
229471	229478	229480	229480	Cohen	538	" The fact is , sir , "
229482	229511	229480	229480	Cohen	538	" we do n't know what 's come to him this last day or two . He 's always what I may call a little touched , you know "
229519	229589	229513	229513	Cohen	538	" not quite so rational in all things , like you and me ; but he 's mostly wonderful regular and industrious so far as a poor creature can be , and takes as much delight in the boy as anybody could . But this last day or two he 's been moving about like a sleep - walker , or else sitting as still as a wax figure . "
229590	229600	229602	229603	the grandmother	4445	" It 's the disease , poor dear creature , "
229607	229618	229602	229603	the grandmother	4445	" I doubt whether he can stand long against it . "
229619	229634	229638	229639	the younger	4541	" No ; I think its only something he 's got in his head . "
229641	229667	229636	229637	Mrs. Cohen	550	" He 's been turning over writing continually , and when I speak to him it takes him ever so long to hear and answer . "
229668	229678	229680	229680	Cohen	550	" You may think us a little weak ourselves , "
229684	229745	229680	229680	Cohen	550	" But my wife and mother would n't part with him if he was a still worse encumbrance . It is n't that we do n't know the long and short of matters , but it 's our principle . There 's fools do business at a loss and do n't know it . I 'm not one of 'em . "
229746	229756	229758	229759	the grandmother	4445	" Oh , Mordecai carries a blessing inside him , "
229761	229771	229773	229773	Jacob	547	" He 's got something the matter inside him , "
229786	229807	229773	229773	Jacob	547	" He said he could n't talk to me , and he would n't have a bit o ' bun . "
229808	229819	229821	229821	Deronda	289	" So far from wondering at your feeling for him , "
229823	229864	229821	229821	Deronda	289	" I already feel something of the same sort myself . I have lately talked to him at Ram 's book - shop in fact , I promised to call for him here , that we might go out together . "
229865	229872	229874	229874	Cohen	547	" That 's it , then ! "
229880	229946	229947	229947	Cohen	547	" He 's been expecting you , and it 's taken hold of him . I suppose he talks about his learning to you . It 's uncommonly kind of you , sir ; for I do n't suppose there 's much to be got out of it , else it would n't have left him where he is . But there 's the shop . "
229972	229984	229952	229952	Jacob	547	" I 'll call Mordecai for you , if you like . "

229995	230017	229992	229993	his mother	1581	" open the door for the gentleman , and let him go in himself Hush ! do n't make a noise . "
230158	230169	230153	230153	Deronda	289	" I am come for you . Are you ready ? "
230227	230234	230206	230206	Jacob	547	" See my cup and ball ! "
230272	230277	230266	230266	he	547	" Fine , fine ! "
230278	230287	230294	230294	he	547	" You have forgotten your greatcoat and comforter , "
230306	230318	230320	230320	Cohen	550	" He 's come to life again , do you see ? "
230332	230343	230346	230346	his	547	" I told you so : I 'm mostly right . "
230350	230379	230346	230346	his	547	" Well , sir , we must n't detain you now , I suppose ; but I hope this is n't the last time we shall see you . "
230380	230386	230388	230388	Jacob	547	" Shall you come again ? "
230392	230415	230388	230388	Jacob	547	" See , I can catch the ball ; I 'll bet I catch it without stopping , if you come again . "
230416	230422	230424	230424	Deronda	289	" He has clever hands , "
230431	230443	230424	230424	Deronda	289	" Which side of the family does he get them from ? "
230457	230513	230450	230451	her son	2994	" My side . My wife 's family are not in that line . But bless your soul ! ours is a sort of cleverness as good as gutta percha ; you can twist it which way you like . There 's nothing some old gentlemen wo n't do if you set 'em to it . "
230548	230555	230560	230560	Deronda	289	" Old gentlemen , old gentlemen , "
230563	230592	230560	230560	Deronda	289	" I shall never know anything decisive about these people until I ask Cohen pointblank whether he lost a sister named Mirah when she was six years old . "
230665	230676	230678	230678	Deronda	289	" The Cohens seem to have an affection for you , "
230691	230697	230645	230645	their	10677	" And I for them , "
230703	230733	230645	230645	their	10677	" They have the heart of the Israelite within them , though they are as the horse and the mule , without understanding beyond the narrow path they tread . "
230734	230745	230747	230747	Deronda	289	" I have caused you some uneasiness , I fear , "
230749	230770	230747	230747	Deronda	289	" by my slowness in fulfilling my promise . I wished to come yesterday , but I found it impossible . "
230771	230861	230645	230645	their	10677	" Yes yes , I trusted you . But it is true I have been uneasy , for the spirit of my youth has been stirred within me , and this body is not strong enough to bear the beating of its wings . I am as a man bound and imprisoned through long years : behold him brought to speech of his fellow and his limbs set free : he weeps , he totters , the joy within him threatens to break and overthrow the tabernacle of flesh . "
230862	230874	230876	230876	Deronda	289	" You must not speak too much in this evening air , "
230892	230920	230879	230879	Mordecai	538	" Cover your mouth with the woolen scarf . We are going to the Hand and Banner , I suppose , and shall be in private there ? "
230921	231006	230645	230645	their	10677	" No , that is my trouble that you did not come yesterday . For this is the evening of the club I spoke of , and we might not have any minutes alone until late , when all the rest are gone . Perhaps we had better seek another place . But I am used to that only . In new places the outer world presses on me and narrows the inward vision . And the people there are familiar with my face . "
231007	231022	231024	231024	Deronda	289	" I do n't mind the club if I am allowed to go in , "
231026	231055	231024	231024	Deronda	289	" It is enough that you like this place best . If we have not enough time I will come again . What sort of club is it ? "
231056	231228	230645	230645	their	10677	" It is called ' The Philosophers . ' They are few like the cedars of Lebanon poor men given to thought . But none so poor as I am : and sometimes visitors of higher worldly rank have been brought . We are allowed to introduce a friend , who is interested in our topics . Each orders beer or some other kind of drink , in payment for the room . Most of them smoke . I have gone when I could , for there are other men of my race who come , and sometimes I have broken silence . I have pleased myself with a faint likeness between these poor philosophers and the Masters who handed down the thought of our race the great Transmitters , who labored with their hands for scant bread , but preserved and enlarged for us the heritage of memory , and saved the soul of Israel alive as a seed among the tombs . The heart pleases itself with faint resemblances . "
231229	231261	231263	231263	Deronda	289	" I shall be very glad to go and sit among them , if that will suit you . It is a sort of meeting I should like to join in , "
231437	231440	231436	231436	his	5448	" Prometheus Unbound "
231441	231462	231436	231436	his	5448	" As thought by thought is piled , till some great truth Is loosened , and the nations echo round . "
231521	231524	231584	231584	Mordecai	538	" taking something "
231569	231582	231584	231584	Mordecai	538	" I have brought a friend who is interested in our subjects , "
231586	231594	231584	231584	Mordecai	538	" He has traveled and studied much . "
231595	231609	231611	231617	the broad - chested quoter of Shelley	5452	" Is the gentlemen anonymous ? Is he a Great ' Unknown ? ' "
231624	231642	231653	231653	he	5452	" My name is Daniel Deronda . I am unknown , but not in any sense great . "
231670	231675	231677	231679	the broad man	5454	" Hear , hear , "
231681	231704	231705	231705	he	5452	" You recommend the name , sir , and are welcome . Here , Mordecai , come to this corner against me , "
232284	232302	232304	232304	Miller	646	" This is what I call one of our touch - and - go nights , sir , "
232333	232495	232304	232304	Miller	646	" Sometimes we stick pretty close to the point . But tonight our friend Pash , there , brought up the law of progress ; and we got on statistics ; then Lily , there , saying we knew well enough before counting that in the same state of society the same sort of things would happen , and it was no more wonder that quantities should remain the same , than that qualities should remain the same , for in relation to society numbers are qualities the number of drunkards is a quality in society the numbers are an index to the qualities , and give us no instruction , only setting us to consider the causes of difference between different social states Lily saying this , we went off on the causes of social change , and when you came in I was going upon the power of ideas , which I hold to be the main transforming cause . "
232496	232507	232509	232509	Goodwin	654	" I do n't hold with you there , Miller , "
232532	232775	232511	232512	the inlayer	5484	" For either you mean so many sorts of things by ideas that I get no knowledge by what you say , any more than if you said light was a cause ; or else you mean a particular sort of ideas , and then I go against your meaning as too narrow . For , look at it in one way , all actions men put a bit of thought into are ideas say , sowing seed , or making a canoe , or baking clay ; and such ideas as these work themselves into life and go on growing with it , but they ca n't go apart from the material that set them to work and makes a medium for them . It 's the nature of wood and stone yielding to the knife that raises the idea of shaping them , and with plenty of wood and stone the shaping will go on . I look at it , that such ideas as are mixed straight away with all the other elements of life are powerful along with 'em . The slower the mixing , the less power they have . And as to the causes of social change , I look at it in this way ideas are a sort of parliament , but there 's a commonwealth outside and a good deal of the commonwealth is working at change without knowing what the parliament is doing . "
232776	232789	232791	232791	Pash	649	" But if you take ready mixing as your test of power , "
232819	232819	232803	232803	They	5486	"
232820	232831	232833	232833	Marrables	655	" They may act by changing the distribution of gases , "
232835	232866	232833	232833	Marrables	655	" instruments are getting so fine now , men may come to register the spread of a theory by observed changes in the atmosphere and corresponding changes in the nerves . "
232867	232870	232872	232872	Pash	649	" Yes , "
232882	232905	232874	232874	his	649	" there is the idea of nationalities ; I dare say the wild asses are snuffing it , and getting more gregarious . "
232906	232914	232916	232916	Deronda	289	" You do n't share that idea ? "
232936	232948	232950	232950	Mordecai	538	" Say , rather , he does not share that spirit , "
232961	232977	232950	232950	Mordecai	538	" Unless nationality is a feeling , what force can it have as an idea ? "
232978	232983	232985	232985	Pash	649	" Granted , Mordecai , "
232992	233021	232985	232985	Pash	649	" And as the feeling of nationality is dying , I take the idea to be no better than a ghost , already walking to announce the death . "
233022	233037	233039	233039	Deronda	289	" A sentiment may seem to be dying and yet revive into strong life , "
233041	233069	233039	233039	Deronda	289	" Nations have revived . We may live to see a great outburst of force in the Arabs , who are being inspired with a new zeal . "
233070	233075	233077	233077	Mordecai	538	" Amen , amen , "
233105	233113	233115	233115	Pash	649	" That may hold with backward nations , "
233117	233160	233115	233115	Pash	649	" but with us in Europe the sentiment of nationality is destined to die out . It will last a little longer in the quarters where oppression lasts , but nowhere else . The whole current of progress is setting against it . "
233161	233164	233166	233166	Buchan	647	" Ay , "
233189	233357	233166	233166	Buchan	647	" ye've done well to bring us round to the point . Ye're all agreed that societies change not always and everywhere but on the whole and in the long run . Now , with all deference , I would beg t ' observe that we have got to examine the nature of changes before we have a warrant to call them progress , which word is supposed to include a bettering , though I apprehend it to be ill - chosen for that purpose , since mere motion onward may carry us to a bog or a precipice . And the questions I would put are three : Is all change in the direction of progress ? if not , how shall we discern which change is progress and which not ? and thirdly , how far and in what way can we act upon the course of change so as to promote it where it is beneficial , and divert it where it is injurious ? "
233376	233431	233373	233373	Lily	653	" Change and progress are merged in the idea of development . The laws of development are being discovered , and changes taking place according to them are necessarily progressive ; that is to say , it we have any notion of progress or improvement opposed to them , the notion is a mistake . "
233432	233453	233455	233455	Deronda	289	" I really ca n't see how you arrive at that sort of certitude about changes by calling them development , "
233457	233534	233455	233455	Deronda	289	" There will still remain the degrees of inevitableness in relation to our own will and acts , and the degrees of wisdom in hastening or retarding ; there will still remain the danger of mistaking a tendency which should be resisted for an inevitable law that we must adjust ourselves to , which seems to me as bad a superstition or false god as any that has been set up without the ceremonies of philosophising . "
233535	233541	233543	233543	Mordecai	538	" That is a truth , "
233545	233806	233543	233543	Mordecai	538	" Woe to the men who see no place for resistance in this generation ! I believe in a growth , a passage , and a new unfolding of life whereof the seed is more perfect , more charged with the elements that are pregnant with diviner form . The life of a people grows , it is knit together and yet expanded , in joy and sorrow , in thought and action ; it absorbs the thought of other nations into its own forms , and gives back the thought as new wealth to the world ; it is a power and an organ in the great body of the nations . But there may come a check , an arrest ; memories may be stifled , and love may be faint for the lack of them ; or memories may shrink into withered relics the soul of a people , whereby they know themselves to be one , may seem to be dying for want of common action . But who shall say , ' The fountain of their life is dried up , they shall forever cease to be a nation ? ' Who shall say it ? Not he who feels the life of his people stirring within his own . Shall he say , ' That way events are wending , I will not resist ? ' His very soul is resistance , and is as a seed of fire that may enkindle the souls of multitudes , and make a new pathway for events . "
233807	233814	233816	233816	Gideon	650	" I do n't deny patriotism , "
233818	233842	233816	233816	Gideon	650	" but we all know you have a particular meaning , Mordecai . You know Mordecai 's way of thinking , I suppose . "
233866	234020	233862	233862	he	650	" I 'm a rational Jew myself . I stand by my people as a sort of family relations , and I am for keeping up our worship in a rational way . I do n't approve of our people getting baptised , because I do n't believe in a Jew 's conversion to the Gentile part of Christianity . And now we have political equality , there 's no excuse for a pretense of that sort . But I am for getting rid of all of our superstitions and exclusiveness . There 's no reason now why we should n't melt gradually into the populations we live among . That 's the order of the day in point of progress . I would as soon my children married Christians as Jews . And I 'm for the old maxim , ' A man 's country is where he 's well off . ' "
234021	234033	234035	234037	the rapid Pash	649	" That country 's not so easy to find , Gideon , "
234045	234095	234035	234037	the rapid Pash	649	" You get ten shillings a - week more than I do , and have only half the number of children . If somebody will introduce a brisk trade in watches among the ' Jerusalem wares , ' I 'll go eh , Mordecai , what do you say ? "
234227	234493	234223	234223	he	538	" What I say is , let every man keep far away from the brotherhood and inheritance he despises . Thousands on thousands of our race have mixed with the Gentiles as Celt with Saxon , and they may inherit the blessing that belongs to the Gentile . You can not follow them . You are one of the multitudes over this globe who must walk among the nations and be known as Jews , and with words on their lips which mean , ' I wish I had not been born a Jew , I disown any bond with the long travail of my race , I will outdo the Gentile in mocking at our separateness , ' they all the while feel breathing on them the breath of contempt because they are Jews , and they will breathe it back poisonously . Can a fresh - made garment of citizenship weave itself straightway into the flesh and change the slow deposit of eighteen centuries ? What is the citizenship of him who walks among a people he has no hardy kindred and fellowship with , and has lost the sense of brotherhood with his own race ? It is a charter of selfish ambition and rivalry in low greed . He is an alien of spirit , whatever he may be in form ; he sucks the blood of mankind , he is not a man , sharing in no loves , sharing in no subjection of the soul , he mocks it all . Is it not truth I speak , Pash ? "
234494	234500	234502	234502	Pash	649	" Not exactly , Mordecai , "
234504	234557	234502	234502	Pash	649	" if you mean that I think the worse of myself for being a Jew . What I thank our fathers for is that there are fewer blockheads among us than among other races . But perhaps you are right in thinking the Christians do n't like me so well for it . "
234558	234570	234572	234574	the genial Gideon	5491	" Catholics and Protestants have not liked each other much better , "
234576	234621	234572	234574	the genial Gideon	5491	" We must wait patiently for prejudices to die out . Many of our people are on a footing with the best , and there 's been a good filtering of our blood into high families . I am for making our expectations rational . "
234622	234628	234630	234630	Mordecai	538	" And so am I ! "
234659	235022	234648	234648	his	538	" I , too , claim to be a rational Jew . But what is it to be rational what is it to feel the light of the divine reason growing stronger within and without ? It is to see more and more of the hidden bonds that bind and consecrate change as a dependent growth yea , consecrate it with kinship : the past becomes my parent and the future stretches toward me the appealing arms of children . Is it rational to drain away the sap of special kindred that makes the families of men rich in interchanged wealth , and various as the forests are various with the glory of the cedar and the palm ? When it is rational to say , ' I know not my father or my mother , let my children be aliens to me , that no prayer of mine may touch them , ' then it will be rational for the Jew to say , ' I will seek to know no difference between me and the Gentile , I will not cherish the prophetic consciousness of our nationality let the Hebrew cease to be , and let all his memorials be antiquarian trifles , dead as the wall - paintings of a conjectured race . Yet let his child learn by rote the speech of the Greek , where he abjures his fellow - citizens by the bravery of those who fought foremost at Marathon let him learn to say that was noble in the Greek , that is the spirit of an immortal nation ! But the Jew has no memories that bind him to action ; let him laugh that his nation is degraded from a nation ; let him hold the monuments of his law which carried within its frame the breath of social justice , of charity , and of household sanctities let him hold the energy of the prophets , the patient care of the Masters , the fortitude of martyred generations , as mere stuff for a professorship . The business of the Jew in all things is to be even as the rich Gentile . "
235191	235195	235197	235197	he	647	" I submit , "
235199	235212	235197	235197	he	647	" that ye're traveling away from the questions I put concerning progress . "
235213	235221	235223	235223	Miller	646	" Say they 're levanting , Buchan , "
235240	235718	235223	235223	Miller	646	" Never mind . Let us have a Jewish night ; we 've not had one for a long while . Let us take the discussion on Jewish ground . I suppose we 've no prejudice here ; we 're all philosophers ; and we like our friends Mordecai , Pash , and Gideon , as well as if they were no more kin to Abraham than the rest of us . We 're all related through Adam , until further showing to the contrary , and if you look into history we 've all got some discreditable forefathers . So I mean no offence when I say I do n't think any great things of the part the Jewish people have played in the world . What then ? I think they were iniquitously dealt by in past times . And I suppose we do n't want any men to be maltreated , white , black , brown , or yellow I know I 've just given my half - crown to the contrary . And that reminds me , I 've a curious old German book I ca n't read it myself , but a friend of mine was reading out of it to me the other day about the prejudicies against the Jews , and the stories used to be told against 'em , and what do you think one was ? Why , that they 're punished with a bad odor in their bodies ; and that , says the author , date 1715 I 've just been pricing and marking the book this very morning that is true , for the ancients spoke of it . But then , he says , the other things are fables , such as that the odor goes away all at once when they 're baptized , and that every one of the ten tribes , mind you , all the ten being concerned in the crucifixion , has got a particular punishment over and above the smell : Asher , I remember , has the right arm a handbreadth shorter than the left , and Naphthali has pig 's ears and a smell of live pork . What do you think of that ? There 's been a good deal of fun made of rabbinical fables , but in point of fables my opinion is , that all over the world it 's six of one and half - a - dozen of the other . However , as I said before , I hold with the philosophers of the last century that the Jews have played no great part as a people , though Pash will have it they 're clever enough to beat all the rest of the world . But if so , I ask , why have n't they done it ? "
235719	235741	235743	235745	the ready Pash	5498	" For the same reason that the cleverest men in the country do n't get themselves or their ideas into Parliament , "
235747	235757	235743	235745	the ready Pash	5498	" because the blockheads are too many for 'em . "
235758	235765	235767	235767	Mordecai	538	" That is a vain question , "
235769	235886	235767	235767	Mordecai	538	" whether our people would beat the rest of the world . Each nation has its own work , and is a member of the world , enriched by the work of each . But it is true , as Jehuda - ha - Levi first said , that Israel is the heart of mankind , if we mean by heart the core of affection which binds a race and its families in dutiful love , and the reverence for the human body which lifts the needs of our animal life into religion , and the tenderness which is merciful to the poor and weak and to the dumb creature that wears the yoke for us . "
235887	235897	235899	235899	Lily	653	" They 're not behind any nation in arrogance , "
235901	235922	235899	235899	Lily	653	" and if they have got in the rear , it has not been because they were over - modest . "
235923	235933	235935	235935	Miller	646	" Oh , every nation brags in its turn , "
235937	235940	235942	235942	Pash	649	" Yes , "
235944	235954	235942	235942	Pash	649	" and some of them in the Hebrew text . "
235955	235974	235976	235976	Lily	653	" Well , whatever the Jews contributed at one time , they are a stand - still people , "
235978	236013	235976	235976	Lily	653	" They are the type of obstinate adherence to the superannuated . They may show good abilities when they take up liberal ideas , but as a race they have no development in them . "
236014	236019	236021	236021	Mordecai	538	" That is false ! "
236031	236582	236027	236027	his	538	" Let their history be known and examined ; let the seed be sifted , let its beginning be traced to the weed of the wilderness the more glorious will be the energy that transformed it . Where else is there a nation of whom it may be as truly said that their religion and law and moral life mingled as the stream of blood in the heart and made one growth where else a people who kept and enlarged their spiritual store at the very time when they are hated with a hatred as fierce as the forest fires that chase the wild beast from his covert ? There is a fable of the Roman , that swimming to save his life he held the roll of his writings between his teeth and saved them from the waters . But how much more than that is true of our race ? They struggled to keep their place among the nations like heroes yea , when the hand was hacked off , they clung with their teeth ; but when the plow and the harrow had passed over the last visible signs of their national covenant , and the fruitfulness of their land was stifled with the blood of the sowers and planters , they said , ' The spirit is alive , let us make it a lasting habitation lasting because movable so that it may be carried from generation to generation , and our sons unborn may be rich in the things that have been , and possess a hope built on an unchangeable foundation . ' They said it and they wrought it , though often breathing with scant life , as in a coffin , or as lying wounded amid a heap of slain . Hooted and scared like the unknown dog , the Hebrew made himself envied for his wealth and wisdom , and was bled of them to fill the bath of Gentile luxury ; he absorbed knowledge , he diffused it ; his dispersed race was a new Phoenicia working the mines of Greece and carrying their products to the world . The native spirit of our tradition was not to stand still , but to use records as a seed and draw out the compressed virtues of law and prophecy ; and while the Gentile , who had said , ' What is yours is ours , and no longer yours , ' was reading the letter of our law as a dark inscription , or was turning its parchments into shoe - soles for an army rabid with lust and cruelty , our Masters were still enlarging and illuminating with fresh - fed interpretation . But the dispersion was wide , the yoke of oppression was a spiked torture as well as a load ; the exile was forced afar among brutish people , where the consciousness of his race was no clearer to him than the light of the sun to our fathers in the Roman persecution , who had their hiding - place in a cave , and knew not that it was day save by the dimmer burning of their candles . What wonder that multitudes of our people are ignorant , narrow , superstitious ? What wonder ? "
236623	236925	236609	236609	his	538	" What wonder ? The night is unto them , that they have no vision ; in their darkness they are unable to divine ; the sun is gone down over the prophets , and the day is dark above them ; their observances are as nameless relics . But which among the chief of the Gentile nations has not an ignorant multitude ? They scorn our people 's ignorant observance ; but the most accursed ignorance is that which has no observance sunk to the cunning greed of the fox , to which all law is no more than a trap or the cry of the worrying hound . There is a degradation deep down below the memory that has withered into superstition . In the multitudes of the ignorant on three continents who observe our rites and make the confession of the divine Unity , the soul of Judaism is not dead . Revive the organic centre : let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality . Looking toward a land and a polity , our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West which will plant the wisdom and skill of our race so that it may be , as of old , a medium of transmission and understanding . Let that come to pass , and the living warmth will spread to the weak extremities of Israel , and superstition will vanish , not in the lawlessness of the renegade , but in the illumination of great facts which widen feeling , and make all knowledge alive as the young offspring of beloved memories . "
237049	237069	237070	237070	They	5501	" You must hope my hopes see the vision I point to behold a glory where I behold it . "
237318	237548	237316	237316	He	5505	" You have your own way of looking at things , Mordecai , and as you say , your own way seems to you rational . I know you do n't hold with the restoration of Judea by miracle , and so on ; but you are as well aware as I am that the subject has been mixed with a heap of nonsense both by Jews and Christians . And as to the connection of our race with Palestine , it has been perverted by superstition till it 's as demoralizing as the old poor - law . The raff and scum go there to be maintained like able - bodied paupers , and to be taken special care of by the angel Gabriel when they die . It 's no use fighting against facts . We must look where they point ; that 's what I call rationality . The most learned and liberal men among us who are attached to our religion are for clearing our liturgy of all such notions as a literal fulfillment of the prophecies about restoration , and so on . Prune it of a few useless rites and literal interpretations of that sort , and our religion is the simplest of all religions , and makes no barrier , but a union , between us and the rest of the world . "
237549	237558	237560	237560	Pash	649	" As plain as a pike - staff , "
237567	237655	237560	237560	Pash	649	" You pluck it up by the roots , strip off the leaves and bark , shave off the knots , and smooth it at top and bottom ; put it where you will , it will do no harm , it will never sprout . You may make a handle of it , or you may throw it on the bonfire of scoured rubbish . I do n't see why our rubbish is to be held sacred any more than the rubbish of Brahmanism or Buddhism . "
237656	237659	237661	237661	Mordecai	538	" No , "
237663	238226	237661	237661	Mordecai	538	" no , Pash , because you have lost the heart of the Jew . Community was felt before it was called good . I praise no superstition , I praise the living fountains of enlarging belief . What is growth , completion , development ? You began with that question , I apply it to the history of our people . I say that the effect of our separateness will not be completed and have its highest transformation unless our race takes on again the character of a nationality . That is the fulfillment of the religious trust that moulded them into a people , whose life has made half the inspiration of the world . What is it to me that the ten tribes are lost untraceably , or that multitudes of the children of Judah have mixed themselves with the Gentile populations as a river with rivers ? Behold our people still ! Their skirts spread afar ; they are torn and soiled and trodden on ; but there is a jeweled breastplate . Let the wealthy men , the monarchs of commerce , the learned in all knowledge , the skilful in all arts , the speakers , the political counselors , who carry in their veins the Hebrew blood which has maintained its vigor in all climates , and the pliancy of the Hebrew genius for which difficulty means new device let them say , ' we will lift up a standard , we will unite in a labor hard but glorious like that of Moses and Ezra , a labor which shall be a worthy fruit of the long anguish whereby our fathers maintained their separateness , refusing the ease of falsehood . ' They have wealth enough to redeem the soil from debauched and paupered conquerors ; they have the skill of the statesman to devise , the tongue of the orator to persuade . And is there no prophet or poet among us to make the ears of Christian Europe tingle with shame at the hideous obloquy of Christian strife which the Turk gazes at as at the fighting of beasts to which he has lent an arena ? There is store of wisdom among us to found a new Jewish polity , grand , simple , just , like the old a republic where there is equality of protection , an equality which shone like a star on the forehead of our ancient community , and gave it more than the brightness of Western freedom amid the despotisms of the East . Then our race shall have an organic centre , a heart and brain to watch and guide and execute ; the outraged Jew shall have a defense in the court of nations , as the outraged Englishman of America . And the world will gain as Israel gains . For there will be a community in the van of the East which carries the culture and the sympathies of every great nation in its bosom : there will be a land set for a halting - place of enmities , a neutral ground for the East as Belgium is for the West . Difficulties ? I know there are difficulties . But let the spirit of sublime achievement move in the great among our people , and the work will begin . "
238227	238238	238240	238240	Pash	649	" Ay , we may safely admit that , Mordecai , "
238242	238268	238240	238240	Pash	649	" When there are great men on ' Change , and high - flying professors converted to your doctrine , difficulties will vanish like smoke . "
238300	238333	238498	238498	Mordecai	538	" If we look back to the history of efforts which have made great changes , it is astonishing how many of them seemed hopeless to those who looked on in the beginning .
238334	238492	238498	238498	Mordecai	538	" Take what we have all heard and seen something of the effort after the unity of Italy , which we are sure soon to see accomplished to the very last boundary . Look into Mazzini 's account of his first yearning , when he was a boy , after a restored greatness and a new freedom to Italy , and of his first efforts as a young man to rouse the same feelings in other young men , and get them to work toward a united nationality . Almost everything seemed against him ; his countrymen were ignorant or indifferent , governments hostile , Europe incredulous . Of course the scorners often seemed wise . Yet you see the prophecy lay with him . As long as there is a remnant of national consciousness , I suppose nobody will deny that there may be a new stirring of memories and hopes which may inspire arduous action . "
238493	238496	238498	238498	Mordecai	538	" Amen , "
238509	238808	238498	238498	Mordecai	538	" What is needed is the leaven what is needed is the seed of fire . The heritage of Israel is beating in the pulses of millions ; it lives in their veins as a power without understanding , like the morning exultation of herds ; it is the inborn half of memory , moving as in a dream among writings on the walls , which it sees dimly but can not divide into speech . Let the torch of visible community be lit ! Let the reason of Israel disclose itself in a great outward deed , and let there be another great migration , another choosing of Israel to be a nationality whose members may still stretch to the ends of the earth , even as the sons of England and Germany , whom enterprise carries afar , but who still have a national hearth and a tribunal of national opinion . Will any say ' It can not be ' ? Baruch Spinoza had not a faithful Jewish heart , though he had sucked the life of his intellect at the breasts of Jewish tradition . He laid bare his father 's nakedness and said , ' They who scorn him have the higher wisdom . ' Yet Baruch Spinoza confessed , he saw not why Israel should not again be a chosen nation . Who says that the history and literature of our race are dead ? Are they not as living as the history and literature of Greece and Rome , which have inspired revolutions , enkindled the thought of Europe , and made the unrighteous powers tremble ? These were an inheritance dug from the tomb . Ours is an inheritance that has never ceased to quiver in millions of human frames . "
238935	238959	238961	238961	Gideon	650	" It may seem well enough on one side to make so much of our memories and inheritance as you do , Mordecai , "
238963	239035	238961	238961	Gideon	650	" but there 's another side . It is n't all gratitude and harmless glory . Our people have inherited a good deal of hatred . There 's a pretty lot of curses still flying about , and stiff settled rancor inherited from the times of persecution . How will you justify keeping one sort of memory and throwing away the other ? There are ugly debts standing on both sides . "
239036	239048	239050	239050	Mordecai	538	" I justify the choice as all other choice is justified , "
239052	239652	239050	239050	Mordecai	538	" I cherish nothing for the Jewish nation , I seek nothing for them , but the good which promises good to all the nations . The spirit of our religious life , which is one with our national life , is not hatred of aught but wrong . The Master has said , an offence against man is worse than an offence against God . But what wonder if there is hatred in the breasts of Jews , who are children of the ignorant and oppressed what wonder , since there is hatred in the breasts of Christians ? Our national life was a growing light . Let the central fire be kindled again , and the light will reach afar . The degraded and scorned of our race will learn to think of their sacred land , not as a place for saintly beggary to await death in loathsome idleness , but as a republic where the Jewish spirit manifests itself in a new order founded on the old , purified and enriched by the experience our greatest sons have gathered from the life of the ages . How long is it ? only two centuries since a vessel carried over the ocean the beginning of the great North American nation . The people grew like meeting waters they were various in habit and sect there came a time , a century ago , when they needed a polity , and there were heroes of peace among them . What had they to form a polity with but memories of Europe , corrected by the vision of a better ? Let our wise and wealthy show themselves heroes . They have the memories of the East and West , and they have the full vision of a better . A new Persia with a purified religion magnified itself in art and wisdom . So will a new Judaea , poised between East and West a covenant of reconciliation . Will any say , the prophetic vision of your race has been hopelessly mixed with folly and bigotry : the angel of progress has no message for Judaism it is a half - buried city for the paid workers to lay open the waters are rushing by it as a forsaken field ? I say that the strongest principle of growth lies in human choice . The sons of Judah have to choose that God may again choose them . The Messianic time is the time when Israel shall will the planting of the national ensign . The Nile overflowed and rushed onward : the Egyptian could not choose the overflow , but he chose to work and make channels for the fructifying waters , and Egypt became the land of corn . Shall man , whose soul is set in the royalty of discernment and resolve , deny his rank and say , I am an onlooker , ask no choice or purpose of me ? That is the blasphemy of this time . The divine principle of our race is action , choice , resolved memory . Let us contradict the blasphemy , and help to will our own better future and the better future of the world not renounce our higher gift and say , ' Let us be as if we were not among the populations ; ' but choose our full heritage , claim the brotherhood of our nation , and carry into it a new brotherhood with the nations of the Gentiles . The vision is there ; it will be fulfilled . "

240028	240067	240068	240068	KEATS	664	" My spirit is too weak ; mortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep , And each imagined pinnacle and steep Of godlike hardship tells me I must die Like a sick eagle looking at the sky . "
240167	240336	240143	240143	He	538	" In the doctrine of the Cabbala , souls are born again and again in new bodies till they are perfected and purified , and a soul liberated from a worn - out body may join the fellow - soul that needs it , that they may be perfected together , and their earthly work accomplished . Then they will depart from the mortal region , and leave place for new souls to be born out of the store in the eternal bosom . It is the lingering imperfection of the souls already born into the mortal region that hinders the birth of new souls and the preparation of the Messianic time : thus the mind has given shape to what is hidden , as the shadow of what is known , and has spoken truth , though it were only in parable . When my long - wandering soul is liberated from this weary body , it will join yours , and its work will be perfected . "
240377	240393	240374	240374	He	538	" Everything I can in conscience do to make your life effective I will do . "
240394	240399	240401	240401	Mordecai	538	" I know it , "
240415	240445	240401	240401	Mordecai	538	" I heard it . You see it all you are by my side on the mount of vision , and behold the paths of fulfillment which others deny . "
240459	240779	240446	240446	He	538	" You will take up my life where it was broken . I feel myself back in that day when my life was broken . The bright morning sun was on the quay it was at Trieste the garments of men from all nations shone like jewels the boats were pushing off the Greek vessel that would land us at Beyrout was to start in an hour . I was going with a merchant as his clerk and companion . I said , I shall behold the lands and people of the East , and I shall speak with a fuller vision . I breathed then as you do , without labor ; I had the light step and the endurance of youth , I could fast , I could sleep on the hard ground . I had wedded poverty , and I loved my bride for poverty to me was freedom . My heart exulted as if it had been the heart of Moses ben Maimon , strong with the strength of three score years , and knowing the work that was to fill them . It was the first time I had been south ; the soul within me felt its former sun ; and standing on the quay , where the ground I stood on seemed to send forth light , and the shadows had an azure glory as of spirits become visible , I felt myself in the flood of a glorious life , wherein my own small year - counted existence seemed to melt , so that I knew it not ; and a great sob arose within me as at the rush of waters that were too strong a bliss . So I stood there awaiting my companion ; and I saw him not till he said : ' Ezra , I have been to the post and there is your letter . ' "
240780	240783	240785	240785	Deronda	289	" Ezra ! "
240792	240795	240797	240797	Mordecai	538	" Ezra , "
240805	240905	240797	240797	Mordecai	538	" I was expecting a letter ; for I wrote continually to my mother . And that sound of my name was like the touch of a wand that recalled me to the body wherefrom I had been released as it were to mingle with the ocean of human existence , free from the pressure of individual bondage . I opened the letter ; and the name came again as a cry that would have disturbed me in the bosom of heaven , and made me yearn to reach where that sorrow was ' Ezra , my son ! ' "
240961	241128	240958	240958	he	538	" She was a mother of whom it might have come yea , might have come to be said , ' Her children arise up and call her blessed . ' In her I understood the meaning of that Master who , perceiving the footsteps of his mother , rose up and said , ' The Majesty of the Eternal cometh near ! ' And that letter was her cry from the depths of anguish and desolation the cry of a mother robbed of her little ones . I was her eldest . Death had taken four babes one after the other . Then came , late , my little sister , who was , more than all the rest , the desire of my mother 's eyes ; and the letter was a piercing cry to me ' Ezra , my son , I am robbed of her . He has taken her away and left disgrace behind . They will never come again . ' "
241147	241298	241132	241132	his	538	" Mine was the lot of Israel . For the sin of the father my soul must go into exile . For the sin of the father the work was broken , and the day of fulfilment delayed . She who bore me was desolate , disgraced , destitute . I turned back . On the instant I turned her spirit and the spirit of her fathers , who had worthy Jewish hearts , moved within me , and drew me . God , in whom dwells the universe , was within me as the strength of obedience . I turned and traveled with hardship to save the scant money which she would need . I left the sunshine , and traveled into freezing cold . In the last stage I spent a night in exposure to cold and snow . And that was the beginning of this slow death . "
241360	241472	241477	241477	Deronda	289	" But I worked . We were destitute every thing had been seized . And she was ill : the clutch of anguish was too strong for her , and wrought with some lurking disease . At times she could not stand for the beating of her heart , and the images in her brain became as chambers of terror , where she beheld my sister reared in evil . In the dead of night I heard her crying for her child . Then I rose , and we stretched forth our arms together and prayed . We poured forth our souls in desire that Mirah might be delivered from evil . "
241473	241476	241477	241477	Deronda	289	" Mirah ? "
241497	241503	241477	241477	Deronda	289	" Did you say Mirah ? "
241504	241560	241477	241477	Deronda	289	" That was my little sister 's name . After we had prayed for her , my mother would rest awhile . It lasted hardly four years , and in the minute before she died , we were praying the same prayer I aloud , she silently . Her soul went out upon its wings . "
241561	241571	241573	241573	Deronda	289	" Have you never since heard of your sister ? "
241581	241665	241670	241670	his	538	" Never . Never have I heard whether she was delivered according to our prayer . I know not , I know not . Who shall say where the pathways lie ? The poisonous will of the wicked is strong . It poisoned my life it is slowly stifling this breath . Death delivered my mother , and I felt it a blessedness that I was alone in the winters of suffering . But what are the winters now ? they are far off "
241693	241751	241670	241670	his	538	" there is nothing to wail in the withering of my body . The work will be the better done . Once I said the work of this beginning was mine , I am born to do it . Well , I shall do it . I shall live in you . I shall live in you . "
241948	241961	241938	241938	Mordecai	538	" Let us go now . I can not talk any longer . "
243331	243335	243312	243312	She	289	" about things , "
243543	243575	243576	243576	She	289	" He said , I must get more interest in others , and more knowledge , and that I must care about the best things but how am I to begin ? "

243958	243974	243976	243977	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" She disguises it under an air of taking everything as a matter of course , "
243979	244000	243976	243977	Mrs. Arrowpoint	253	" A stranger might suppose that she had condescended rather than risen . I always noticed that doubleness in her . "
244157	244184	244146	244146	Grandcourt	485	" We ca n't be having those people always . Gascoigne talks too much . Country clergy are always bores with their confounded fuss about everything . "

244234	244271	244226	244226	she	289	" Mr. Grandcourt wants to recognize you as little as possible ; and besides it is better you should not see much of my married life , else you might find out that I am miserable . "
244306	244341	244303	244303	Gwendolen	289	" It would not be so nice for you as being near the rectory here , mamma . We shall perhaps be very little at Ryelands . You would miss my aunt and uncle . "

244671	244693	244698	244698	she	289	" Mr. Grandcourt is gone out , so I determined to fill up the time by coming to you , mamma , "
244722	244757	244758	244758	She	289	" That is a punishment to you for not wearing better lace on your head . You did n't think I should come and detect you you dreadfully careless - about - yourself mamma ! "
244768	244774	244779	244779	her	330	" Scold me , dear , "
244787	244824	244776	244777	Mrs. Davilow	330	" But I wish there was something you could eat after your ride instead of these scraps . Let Jocosa make you a cup of chocolate in your old way . You used to like that . "
244837	244870	244834	244834	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , no , a piece of bread , or one of those hard biscuits . I ca n't think about eating . I am come to say good - bye . "
244871	244879	244881	244882	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" What ! going to Ryelands again ? "
244884	244893	244895	244895	Gwendolen	289	" No , we are going to town , "
244914	244924	244926	244927	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" It is rather early to go to town , "
244929	244937	244926	244927	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" and Mr. Grandcourt not in Parliament . "
244938	244966	244968	244968	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , there is only one more day 's hunting to be had , and Henleigh has some business in town with lawyers , I think , "
244970	244984	244968	244968	Gwendolen	289	" I am very glad . I shall like to go to town . "
244985	244995	244997	244998	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You will see your house in Grosvenor Square , "
245019	245022	245024	245024	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , "
245038	245052	245024	245024	Gwendolen	289	" And there is so much to be seen and done in town . "
245053	245061	245063	245064	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" I wish , my dear Gwendolen , "
245073	245223	245063	245064	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" that you would use your influence with Mr. Grandcourt to induce him to enter Parliament . A man of his position should make his weight felt in politics . The best judges are confident that the ministry will have to appeal to the country on this question of further Reform , and Mr. Grandcourt should be ready for the opportunity . I am not quite sure that his opinions and mine accord entirely ; I have not heard him express himself very fully . But I do n't look at the matter from that point of view . I am thinking of your husband 's standing in the country . And he has now come to that stage of life when a man like him should enter into public affairs . A wife has great influence with her husband . Use yours in that direction , my dear . "
245353	245394	245337	245337	her	289	" I should be very glad , uncle . But I think Mr. Grandcourt would not like the trouble of an election at least , unless it could be without his making speeches . I thought candidates always made speeches . "
245395	245403	245405	245406	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" Not necessarily to any great extent , "
245408	245462	245405	245406	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" A man of position and weight can get on without much of it . A county member need have very little trouble in that way , and both out of the House and in it is liked the better for not being a speechifier . Tell Mr. Grandcourt that I say so . "
245463	245473	245475	245475	Gwendolen	289	" Here comes Jocosa with my chocolate after all , "
245650	245664	245665	245665	she	230	" Your uncle and Anna will very likely be in town about Easter , "
245678	245739	245665	245665	she	230	" Dear Rex hopes to come out with honors and a fellowship , and he wants his father and Anna to meet him in London , that they may be jolly together , as he says . I should n't wonder if Lord Brackenshaw invited them , he has been so very kind since he came back to the Castle . "
245740	245754	245759	245759	herself	289	" I hope my uncle will bring Ann to stay in Grosvenor Square , "
245791	245802	245776	245776	she	289	" I am very glad of Rex 's good fortune . "
245803	245816	245818	245824	the rector , to whom this topic	5627	" We must not be premature , and rejoice too much beforehand , "
245851	245895	245818	245824	the rector , to whom this topic	5627	" Not but that I am in correspondence with impartial judges , who have the highest hopes about my son , as a singularly clear - headed young man . And of his excellent disposition and principle I have had the best evidence . "
245896	245907	245909	245910	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" We shall have him a great lawyer some time , "
245912	245917	245919	245919	Gwendolen	289	" How very nice ! "
245940	245948	245950	245951	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Talking of Lord Brackenshaw 's kindness , "
245953	246069	245950	245951	Mrs. Davilow	330	" you do n't know how delightful he has been , Gwendolen . He has begged me to consider myself his guest in this house till I can get another that I like he did it in the most graceful way . But now a house has turned up . Old Mr. Jodson is dead , and we can have his house . It is just what I want ; small , but with nothing hideous to make you miserable thinking about it . And it is only a mile from the Rectory . You remember the low white house nearly hidden by the trees , as we turn up the lane to the church ? "
246070	246082	246084	246084	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , but you have no furniture , poor mamma , "
246091	246112	246114	246115	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh , I am saving money for that . You know who has made me rather rich , dear , "
246124	246139	246118	246118	her	330	" And Jocosa really makes so little do for housekeeping it is quite wonderful . "
246140	246159	246161	246161	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , please let me go up - stairs with you and arrange my hat , mamma , "
246206	246217	246219	246219	Gwendolen	289	" I suppose I shall never see all this again , "
246267	246275	246277	246278	Mrs. Davilow	330	" You are not well , dear ? "
246280	246290	246292	246292	Gwendolen	289	" No ; that chocolate has made me sick , "
246302	246318	246327	246327	she	330	" I should be allowed to come to you if you were ill , darling , "
246353	246358	246360	246360	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , yes , "
246377	246429	246430	246430	She	903	" But you know I never am ill . I am as strong as possible ; and you must not take to fretting about me , but make yourself as happy as you can with the girls . They are better children to you than I have been , you know . "
246439	246454	246430	246430	She	903	" You have always been good , my darling . I remember nothing else . "
246455	246474	246476	246476	Gwendolen	289	" Why , what did I ever do that was good to you , except marry Mr. Grandcourt ? "
246499	246513	246514	246514	She	903	" And I should not have done that unless it had pleased myself . "
246525	246550	246476	246476	Gwendolen	289	" God forbid , child ! I would not have had you marry for my sake . Your happiness by itself is half mine . "
246551	246555	246557	246557	Gwendolen	289	" Very well , "
246564	246588	246557	246557	Gwendolen	289	" then you will please to consider that you are half happy , which is more than I am used to seeing you . "
246605	246684	246593	246593	she	289	" Now I am ready ; but oh , mamma , Mr. Grandcourt gives me a quantity of money , and expects me to spend it , and I ca n't spend it ; and you know I ca n't bear charity children and all that ; and here are thirty pounds . I wish the girls would spend it for me on little things for themselves when you go to the new house . Tell them so . "
246704	246711	246713	246714	Mrs. Davilow	330	" God bless you , dear , "
246716	246732	246713	246714	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It will please them so that you should have thought of them in particular . "
246733	246749	246751	246751	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , they are troublesome things ; but they do n't trouble me now , "
246835	246847	246825	246825	her	289	" I think I am making a very good Mrs. Grandcourt . "
246879	246892	246875	246875	he	1088	" a dog - hutch of a place in a black country ; "
247084	247089	247077	247077	she	289	" must go on . "
247477	247482	247484	247484	Sirius	678	" to be there . "
247598	247610	247586	247623	the Miss Lapidoth who had gone through so much , and was " capable of submitting to anything in the form of duty . " For Gwendolen had remembered nearly every word that Deronda had said about Mirah	289	" capable of submitting to anything in the form of duty . "
247793	247798	247800	247800	he	5659	" O patria mia , "
247927	247930	247926	247929	the " little Jewess	11133	" little Jewess "
247973	247984	247990	247990	her	289	" He thinks I am in the right road now , "
248055	248059	248016	248016	she	289	" damnably vulgar . "
248102	248109	248110	248111	Mr. Lush	343	" amateur too fond of Meyerbeer , "
248471	248508	248468	248468	her	554	" Well , your Jewess is pretty there 's no denying that . But where is her Jewish impudence ? She looks as demure as a nun . I suppose she learned that on the stage . "
248592	248594	248582	248582	Mordecai	538	" Jewess "
248627	248635	248636	248636	Pray	342	" that Vandyke duchess of a beauty . "
248728	248742	248715	248715	he	406	" I thought you could admire no style of woman but your Berenice . "
248743	248753	248755	248755	Hans	406	" That is the style I worship not admire , "
248757	248788	248755	248755	Hans	406	" Other styles of women I might make myself wicked for , but for Berenice I could make myself well , pretty good , which is something much more difficult . "
248789	248792	248794	248794	Deronda	289	" Hush , "
248841	248846	248839	248839	Mirah	289	" O patria mia . "
248931	248951	248978	248978	they	5685	" Non ti difende Nessun de tuoi ! L'armi , qua l'armi : io solo Combatterů , procomberů sol io "
249058	249068	249047	249047	Klesmer	623	" Good , good the crescendo better than before . "
249191	249196	249197	249197	Daniel	197	" the little Jewess , "
249258	249273	249279	249279	he	5682	" But is it not cowardly to make that a reason for turning away ? "
249386	249400	249402	249402	Gwendolen	289	" You must let me say how much I am obliged to you , "
249404	249432	249402	249402	Gwendolen	289	" I had heard from Mr. Deronda that I should have a great treat in your singing , but I was too ignorant to imagine how great . "
249433	249442	249444	249444	Mirah	289	" You are very good to say so , "
249505	249519	249521	249521	Gwendolen	289	" We shall all want to learn of you I , at least , "
249523	249536	249538	249538	she	289	" I sing very badly , as Herr Klesmer will tell you , "
249550	249579	249538	249538	she	289	" but I have been rebuked for not liking to middling , since I can be nothing more . I think that is a different doctrine from yours ? "
249590	249619	249622	249622	he	265	" Not if it means that it would be worth while for you to study further , and for Miss Lapidoth to have the pleasure of helping you . "
249635	249680	249627	249627	Mirah	289	" If you think I could teach you , I shall be very glad . I am anxious to teach , but I have only just begun . If I do it well , it must be by remembering how my master taught me . "
249722	249744	249702	249702	her	289	" You have not been long in London , I think ? but you were perhaps introduced to Mr. Deronda abroad ? "
249745	249748	249750	249750	Mirah	289	" No , "
249752	249766	249750	249750	Mirah	289	" I never saw him before I came to England in the summer . "
249767	249786	249788	249788	Gwendolen	289	" But he has seen you often and heard you sing a great deal , has he not ? "
249823	249843	249702	249702	her	289	" He spoke of you to me with the highest praise . He seemed to know you quite well . "
249844	249854	249856	249856	Mirah	289	" Oh , I was poor and needed help , "
249865	249917	249856	249856	Mirah	289	" and Mr. Deronda has given me the best friends in the world . That is the only way he came to know anything about me because he was sorry for me . I had no friends when I came . I was in distress . I owe everything to him . "
250388	250399	250376	250376	she	289	" Miss Lapidoth is everything you described her to be . "
250400	250410	250412	250412	Deronda	289	" You have been very quick in discovering that , "
250416	250434	250436	250436	Gwendolen	289	" I have not found out all the excellencies you spoke of I do n't mean that , "
250438	250481	250436	250436	Gwendolen	289	" but I think her singing is charming , and herself , too . Her face is lovely not in the least common ; and she is such a complete little person . I should think she will be a great success . "
250594	250602	250590	250590	Gwendolen	289	" You despise me for talking artificially . "
250603	250606	250608	250608	Deronda	289	" No , "
250615	250638	250608	250608	Deronda	289	" I think that is quite excusable sometimes . But I did not think what you were last saying was altogether artificial . "
250639	250649	250651	250651	Gwendolen	289	" There was something in it that displeased you , "
250653	250658	250651	250651	Gwendolen	289	" What was it ? "
250659	250668	250670	250670	Deronda	289	" It is impossible to explain such things , "
250672	250685	250670	250670	Deronda	289	" One can never communicate niceties of feeling about words and manner . "
250686	250697	250699	250699	Gwendolen	289	" You think I am shut out from understanding them , "
250716	250730	250710	250710	she	289	" Have I shown myself so very dense to everything you have said ? "
250749	250754	250756	250756	Deronda	289	" Not at all , "
250764	250794	250795	250795	He	5710	" But experience differs for different people . We do n't all wince at the same things . I have had plenty of proof that you are not dense . "
250800	250818	250820	250820	Gwendolen	289	" But one may feel things and are not able to do anything better for all that , "
250842	250901	250830	250830	Deronda	289	" I begin to think we can only get better by having people about us who raise good feelings . You must not be surprised at anything in me . I think it is too late for me to alter . I do n't know how to set about being wise , as you told me to be . "
250902	250923	250925	250925	Deronda	289	" I seldom find I do any good by my preaching . I might as well have kept from meddling , "
250961	250967	250969	250969	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't say that , "
250996	251088	250969	250969	Gwendolen	289	" If you despair of me , I shall despair . Your saying that I should not go on being selfish and ignorant has been some strength to me . If you say you wish you had not meddled that means you despair of me and forsake me . And then you will decide for me that I shall not be good . It is you who will decide ; because you might have made me different by keeping as near to me as you could , and believing in me . "
251497	251505	251507	251507	Hans	406	" What an enviable fellow you are , "
251529	251529	251507	251507	Hans	406	"
251530	251535	251537	251537	Deronda	289	" Quarrel with her ? "
251542	251635	251537	251537	Deronda	289	" Oh , about theology , of course ; nothing personal . But she told you what you ought to think , and then left you with a grand air which was admirable . Is she an Antinomian if so , tell her I am an Antinomian painter , and introduce me . I should like to paint her and her husband . He has the sort of handsome physique that the Duke ought to have in Lucrezia Borgia if it could go with a fine baritone , which it ca n't . "
251747	251767	251739	251739	he	1088	" Lush will dine with us among the other people to - morrow . You will treat him civilly . "
251794	251809	251779	251779	she	289	" You are breaking your promise to me the first promise you made me . "
251854	251868	251844	251844	she	289	" I thought you did not intend him to frequent the house again . "
251869	251889	251844	251844	she	289	" I want him just now . He is useful to me ; and he must be treated civilly . "
251985	252048	252085	252086	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" If any one should importune me to give a reason why I loved him , I feel it could no otherwise be expressed than by making answer , ' Because it was he , because it was I. ' There is , beyond what I am able to say , I know not what inexplicable power that brought on this union . "
252244	252248	252253	252253	her	418	" the little mother "
252556	252660	252549	252549	She	289	" I am as glad as you are that the pawnbroker is not her brother : there are Ezras and Ezras in the world ; and really it is a comfort to think that all Jews are not like those shopkeepers who will not let you get out of their shops : and besides , what he said to you about his mother and sister makes me bless him . I am sure he 's good . But I never did like anything fanatical . I suppose I heard a little too much preaching in my youth and lost my palate for it . "
252661	252675	252677	252677	Deronda	289	" I do n't think you will find that Mordecai obtrudes any preaching , "
252679	252811	252677	252677	Deronda	289	" He is not what I should call fanatical . I call a man fanatical when his enthusiasm is narrow and hoodwinked , so that he has no sense of proportions , and becomes unjust and unsympathetic to men who are out of his own track . Mordecai is an enthusiast ; I should like to keep that word for the highest order of minds those who care supremely for grand and general benefits to mankind . He is not a strictly orthodox Jew , and is full of allowances for others ; his conformity in many things is an allowance for the condition of other Jews . The people he lives with are as fond of him as possible , and they ca n't in the least understand his ideas . "
252812	252932	253120	253121	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Oh , well , I can live up to the level of the pawnbroker 's mother , and like him for what I see to be good in him ; and for what I do n't see the merits of I will take your word . According to your definition , I suppose one might be fanatical in worshipping common - sense ; for my poor husband used to say the world would be a poor place if there were nothing but common - sense in it . However , Mirah 's brother will have good bedding that I have taken care of ; and I shall have this extra window pasted up with paper to prevent draughts . "
252943	252982	253122	253122	herself	418	" It is a comfort to think that the people of the house are no strangers to me no hypocritical harpies . And when the children know , we shall be able to make the rooms much prettier . "
252983	253010	253012	253012	Deronda	289	" The next stage of the affair is to tell all to Mordecai , and get him to move which may be a more difficult business , "
253014	253028	253030	253031	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" And will you tell Mirah before I say anything to the children ? "
253047	253074	253038	253038	she	418	" No , I think not . Let me tell Hans and the girls the evening before , and they will be away the next morning ? "
253075	253115	253117	253117	Deronda	289	" Yes , that will be best . But do justice to my account of Mordecai or Ezra , as I suppose Mirah will wish to call him : do n't assist their imagination by referring to Habakkuk Mucklewrath , "
253131	253138	253140	253142	the little mother	10303	" Trust me , trust me , "
253144	253190	253140	253142	the little mother	10303	" I shall have to persuade them so hard to be glad , that I shall convert myself . When I am frightened I find it a good thing to have somebody to be angry with for not being brave : it warms the blood . "
253443	253454	253440	253440	Deronda	289	" I suppose Mordecai is at home and expecting me , "
253473	253484	253455	253455	Jacob	547	" What do you want to talk to Mordecai about ? "
253485	253494	253496	253496	Deronda	289	" Something that is very interesting to him , "
253504	253512	253496	253496	Deronda	289	" but that you ca n't understand . "
253513	253519	253521	253521	Jacob	547	" Can you say this ? "
253570	253575	253577	253577	Deronda	289	" No , really , "
253582	253591	253577	253577	Deronda	289	" I ca n't say anything like it . "
253592	253597	253599	253599	Jacob	547	" I thought not , "
253663	253671	253649	253649	he	547	" Mordecai , here 's the young swell "
253835	253849	253823	253823	Mordecai	538	" You are coming to tell me something that my soul longs for . "
253850	253871	253873	253873	Deronda	289	" It is true I have something very weighty to tell you something I trust that you will rejoice in , "
253895	253907	253909	253909	Mordecai	538	" It is all revealed it is made clear to you , "
253920	253946	253909	253909	Mordecai	538	" You are even as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother the heritage is yours there is no doubt to divide us . "
253947	253956	253958	253958	Deronda	289	" I have learned nothing new about myself , "
254025	254028	254029	254029	Deronda	289	" Except , "
254038	254070	254029	254029	Deronda	289	" except that I had really some time ago come into another sort of hidden connection with you , besides what you have spoken of as existing in your own feeling . "
254086	254100	254029	254029	Deronda	289	" I had made the acquaintance of one in whom you are interested . "
254101	254112	254113	254113	Deronda	289	" One who is closely related to your departed mother , "
254133	254144	254131	254131	he	538	" whom she and you held dear above all others . "
254185	254202	254183	254183	he	538	" What was prayed for has come to pass : Mirah has been delivered from evil . "
254223	254234	254219	254219	Deronda	289	" Your sister is worthy of the mother you honored . "
254457	254465	254467	254467	Deronda	289	" It was in search of them , "
254471	254563	254467	254467	Deronda	289	" that I turned into this house : the name Ezra Cohen was just then the most interesting name in the world to me . I confess I had fear for a long while . Perhaps you will forgive me now for having asked you that question about the elder Mrs. Cohen 's daughter . I cared very much what I should find Mirah 's friends to be . But I had found a brother worthy of her when I knew that her Ezra was disguised under the name of Mordecai . "
254564	254574	254450	254450	he	538	" Mordecai is really my name Ezra Mordecai Cohen . "
254575	254586	254588	254588	Deronda	289	" Is there any kinship between this family and yours ? "
254590	254680	254450	254450	he	538	" Only the kinship of Israel . My soul clings to these people , who have sheltered me and given me succor out of the affection that abides in Jewish hearts , as sweet odor in things long crushed and hidden from the outer air . It is good for me to bear with their ignorance and be bound to them in gratitude , that I may keep in mind the spiritual poverty of the Jewish million , and not put impatient knowledge in the stead of loving wisdom . "
254681	254702	254704	254704	Deronda	289	" But you do n't feel bound to continue with them now there is a closer tie to draw you ? "
254718	254893	254704	254704	Deronda	289	" It seems to me right now is it not ? that you should live with your sister ; and I have prepared a home to take you to in the neighborhood of her friends , that she may join you there . Pray grant me this wish . It will enable me to be with you often in the hours when Mirah is obliged to leave you . That is my selfish reason . But the chief reason is , that Mirah will desire to watch over you , and that you ought to give her the guardianship of a brother 's presence . You shall have books about you . I shall want to learn of you , and to take you out to see the river and trees . And you will have the rest and comfort that you will be more and more in need of nay , that I need for you . This is the claim I make on you , now that we have found each other . "
254953	255070	254945	254945	he	5774	" And you would have me hold it doubtful whether you were born a Jew ! Have we not from the first touched each other with invisible fibres have we not quivered together like the leaves from a common stem with stirring from a common root ? I know what I am outwardly , I am one among the crowd of poor I am stricken , I am dying . But our souls know each other . They gazed in silence as those who have long been parted and meet again , but when they found voice they were assured , and all their speech is understanding . The life of Israel is in your veins . "
255117	255167	255168	255168	He	5776	" What you wish of me I will do . And our mother may the blessing of the Eternal be with her in our souls ! would have wished it too . I will accept what your loving kindness has prepared , and Mirah 's home shall be mine . "
255182	255209	255168	255168	He	5776	" But I shall grieve to part from these parents and the little ones . You must tell them , for my heart would fail me . "
255210	255229	255231	255231	Deronda	289	" I felt that you would want me to tell them . Shall we go now at once ? "
255240	255254	255256	255256	Mordecai	538	" Yes ; let us not defer it . It must be done , "
255280	255293	255299	255299	he	5780	" But do not dwell on my sister more than is needful . "
255306	255328	255329	255329	he	5780	" Ask your father to come , and tell Sarah to mind the shop . My friend has something to say , "
255399	255428	255389	255389	he	5780	" Well , sir ! I 'm glad you 're doing us the honor to join our family party again . We are pretty comfortable , I think . "
255565	255584	255585	255585	Deronda	289	" I have just been telling Mordecai of an event that makes a great change in his life , "
255588	255625	255585	255585	Deronda	289	" but I hope you will agree with me that it is a joyful one . Since he thinks of you as his best friends , he wishes me to tell you for him at once . "
255626	255633	255636	255636	Cohen	538	" Relations with money , sir ? "
255656	255662	255664	255664	Deronda	289	" No ; not exactly , "
255668	255698	255664	255664	Deronda	289	" But a very precious relation wishes to be reunited to him a very good and lovely young sister , who will care for his comfort in every way . "
255699	255704	255747	255748	the grandmother	4445	" Married , sir ? "
255705	255711	255664	255664	Deronda	289	" No , not married . "
255712	255718	255747	255748	the grandmother	4445	" But with a maintenance ? "
255719	255737	255664	255664	Deronda	289	" With talents which will secure her a maintenance . A home is already provided for Mordecai . "
255754	255770	255747	255748	the grandmother	4445	" Well , well ! and so you 're going away from us , Mordecai . "
255771	255783	255785	255786	the mother	1566	" And where there 's no children as there is here , "
255792	255804	255806	255807	the grandmother	4445	" No Jacob , and no Adelaide , and no Eugenie ! "
255810	255840	255842	255842	Cohen	547	" Ay , ay , Jacob 's learning ' ill all wear out of him . He must go to school . It 'll be hard times for Jacob , "
255916	255921	255931	255931	he	547	" hard times for Jacob "
256024	256038	256016	256017	His father	7898	" Never mind , old man ; you shall go to the riders , "
256112	256540	256541	256541	Cohen	538	" It 's not as we 're the people to grudge anybody 's good luck , sir , or the portion of their cup being made fuller , as I may say . I 'm not an envious man , and if anybody offered to set up Mordecai in a shop of my sort two doors lower down , I should n't make wry faces about it . I 'm not one of them that had need have a poor opinion of themselves , and be frightened at anybody else getting a chance . If I 'm offal , let a wise man come and tell me , for I 've never heard it yet . And in point of business , I 'm not a class of goods to be in danger . If anybody takes to rolling me , I can pack myself up like a caterpillar , and find my feet when I 'm let alone . And though , as I may say , you 're taking some of our good works from us , which is property bearing interest , I 'm not saying but we can afford that , though my mother and my wife had the good will to wish and do for Mordecai to the last ; and a Jew must not be like a servant who works for reward though I see nothing against a reward if I can get it . And as to the extra outlay in schooling , I 'm neither poor nor greedy I would n't hang myself for sixpence , nor half a crown neither . But the truth of it is , the women and children are fond of Mordecai . You may partly see how it is , sir , by your own sense . A Jewish man is bound to thank God , day by day , that he was not made a woman ; but a woman has to thank God that He has made her according to His will . And we all know what He has made her a child - bearing , tender - hearted thing is the woman of our people . Her children are mostly stout , as I think you 'll say Addy 's are , and she 's not mushy , but her heart is tender . So you must excuse present company , sir , for not being glad all at once . And as to this young lady for by what you say ' young lady ' is the proper term "
256552	256580	256541	256541	Cohen	538	" we shall all be glad for Mordecai 's sake by - and - by , when we cast up our accounts and see where we are . "
256595	256802	256593	256593	Mordecai	538	" Friends , friends ! For food and raiment and shelter I would not have sought better than you have given me . You have sweetened the morsel with love ; and what I thought of as a joy that would be left to me even in the last months of my waning strength was to go on teaching the lad . But now I am as one who had clad himself beforehand in his shroud , and used himself to making the grave his bed , when the divine command sounded in his ears , ' Arise , and go forth ; the night is not yet come . ' For no light matter would I have turned away from your kindness to take another 's . But it has been taught us , as you know , that the reward of one duty is the power to fulfill another so said Ben Azai . You have made your duty to one of the poor among your brethren a joy to you and me ; and your reward shall be that you will not rest without the joy of like deeds in the time to come . And may not Jacob come and visit me ? "
256814	256828	256810	256810	Deronda	289	" Surely that can be managed . It is no further than Brompton . "
256858	256860	256829	256829	Jacob	547	" visit "
256906	256909	256911	256912	the grandmother	4445	" Well , "
256920	256950	256911	256912	the grandmother	4445	" I hope there 'll be nothing in the way of your getting kosher meat , Mordecai . For you 'll have to trust to those you live with . "
256951	256969	256971	256971	Cohen	538	" That 's all right , that 's all right , you may be sure , mother , "
256993	256998	256999	256999	he	538	" So , sir , "
257012	257042	256999	256999	he	538	" it was better than learning you had to talk to Mordecai about ! I wondered to myself at the time . I thought somehow there was a something . "
257043	257059	257061	257061	Deronda	289	" Mordecai will perhaps explain to you how it was that I was seeking him , "
257181	257210	257179	257179	he	538	" Mirah would wish to thank the Cohens for their goodness . You would wish her to do so to come and see them , would you not ? "
257221	257340	257179	257179	he	538	" I can not tell . I fear not . There is a family sorrow , and the sight of my sister might be to them as the fresh bleeding of wounds . There is a daughter and sister who will never be restored as Mirah is . But who knows the pathways ? We are all of us denying or fulfilling prayers and men in their careless deeds walk amidst invisible outstretched arms and pleadings made in vain . In my ears I have the prayers of generations past and to come . My life is as nothing to me but the beginning of fulfilment . And yet I am only another prayer which you will fulfil . "
257353	257370	257371	257371	WORDSWORTH	479	" And you must love him ere to you He will seem worthy of your love . "
257562	257586	257603	257604	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" that bathing of all objects in a solemnity as of sun - set glow , which is begotten of a loving reverential emotion .
257645	257692	257634	257635	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Now , Kate , put out your candle , and all come round the fire cosily . Hans , dear , do leave off laughing at those poems for the ninety - ninth time , and come too . I have something wonderful to tell . "
257693	257725	257727	257727	Kate	422	" As if I did n't know that , ma . I have seen it in the corner of your eye ever so long , and in your pretense of errands , "
257764	257785	257787	257788	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Well , then , if you are so wise , perhaps you know that Mirah 's brother is found ! "
257795	257801	257803	257803	Hans	406	" Oh , confound it ! "
257810	257817	257819	257819	Mab	424	" Hans , that is wicked , "
257821	257828	257819	257819	Mab	424	" Suppose we had lost you ? "
257829	257838	257840	257840	Kate	422	" I can not help being rather sorry , "
257842	257851	257840	257840	Kate	422	" And her mother ? where is she ? "
257852	257858	257819	257819	Mab	424	" Her mother is dead . "
257859	257870	257872	257872	Amy	423	" I hope the brother is not a bad man , "
257874	257891	257893	257893	Hans	406	" Nor a fellow all smiles and jewelry a Crystal Palace Assyrian with a hat on , "
257900	257908	257910	257911	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Were there ever such unfeeling children ? "
257922	257938	257910	257911	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You do n't think the least bit of Mirah 's joy in the matter . "
257939	257951	257953	257953	Kate	422	" You know , ma , Mirah hardly remembers her brother , "
257955	257969	257971	257971	Hans	406	" People who are lost for twelve years should never come back again , "
257973	257981	257971	257971	Hans	406	" They are always in the way . "
257982	257985	257987	257988	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Hans ! "
257992	258006	257987	257988	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" If you had lost me for twenty years , I should have thought "
258007	258013	258014	258014	Hans	406	" I said twelve years , "
258018	258037	258014	258014	Hans	406	" Anywhere about twelve years is the time at which lost relations should keep out of the way . "
258038	258053	258055	258055	Mab	424	" Well , but it 's nice finding people there is something to tell , "
258061	258068	258055	258055	Mab	424	" Did Prince Camaralzaman find him ? "
258087	258097	258098	258098	she	418	" Mr. Deronda has the highest admiration for him , "
258122	258122	258110	258110	he	5817	"
258123	258133	258135	258135	Hans	406	" Deronda is getting perfectly preposterous about those Jews , "
258149	258164	258135	258135	Hans	406	" He wants to do everything he can to encourage Mirah in her prejudices . "
258165	258182	258184	258184	Mab	424	" Oh , for shame , Hans ! to speak in that way of Mr. Deronda , "
258208	258218	258219	258219	Hans	406	" And now we shall never be all together , "
258238	258298	258226	258226	his	406	" but we must have this prophet Elijah to tea with us , and Mirah will think of nothing but sitting on the ruins of Jerusalem . She will be spoiled as an artist mind that she will get as narrow as a nun . Everything will be spoiled our home and everything . I shall take to drinking . "
258299	258306	258308	258308	Kate	422	" Oh , really , Hans , "
258312	258342	258308	258308	Kate	422	" I do think men are the most contemptible animals in all creation . Every one of them must have everything to his mind , else he is unbearable . "
258343	258355	258357	258357	Mab	424	" Oh , oh , oh , it 's very dreadful ! "
258359	258370	258357	258357	Mab	424	" I feel as if ancient Nineveh were come again . "
258371	258399	258401	258401	Amy	423	" I should like to know what is the good of having gone to the university and knowing everything , if you are so childish , Hans , "
258403	258430	258401	258401	Amy	423	" You ought to put up with a man that Providence sends you to be kind to . We shall have to put up with him . "
258431	258457	258459	258459	Hans	406	" I hope you will all of you like the new Lamentations of Jeremiah ' to be continued in our next ' that 's all , "
258467	258540	258459	258459	Hans	406	" It 's no use being one thing more than another if one has to endure the company of those men with a fixed idea , staring blankly at you , and requiring all your remarks to be small foot - notes to their text . If you 're to be under a petrifying wall , you 'd better be an old boot . I do n't feel myself an old boot . "
258544	258551	258459	258459	Hans	406	" Good night , little mother , "
258574	258581	258568	258568	his	406	" Good - night , girls . "
258582	258591	258593	258593	Kate	422	" Suppose Mirah knew how you are behaving , "
258605	258618	258619	258619	she	422	" I should like to see Mirah when Mr. Deronda tells her , "
258626	258635	258619	258619	she	422	" I know she will look so beautiful . "
258887	258900	258869	258869	He	406	" I must keep my old garments by me for a remembrance . "
259104	259115	259116	259116	she	289	" You like to go in that dress , dear ? "
259119	259145	259116	259116	she	289	" My brother is poor , and I want to look as much like him as I can , else he may feel distant from me "
259275	259278	259279	259279	she	289	" Ezra , "
259330	259344	259327	259327	he	538	" That was our mother 's voice . You remember her calling me ? "
259345	259364	259365	259365	Mirah	289	" Yes , and how you answered her ' Mother ! ' and I knew you loved her . "
259407	259418	259429	259429	his	538	" Ah , the dear head , the dear head ? "
259437	259445	259447	259447	Mirah	289	" You are very ill , Ezra , "
259457	259474	259504	259504	her	289	" Yes , dear child , I shall not be long with you in the body , "
259480	259495	259497	259497	Mirah	289	" Oh , I will love you and we will talk to each other , "
259514	259579	259504	259504	her	289	" I will tell you everything , and you will teach me : you will teach me to be a good Jewess what she would have liked me to be . I shall always be with you when I am not working . For I work now . I shall get money to keep us . Oh , I have had such good friends . "
259663	259669	259671	259671	Mirah	289	" See this dear lady ! "
259673	259704	259705	259705	she	289	" I was a stranger , a poor wanderer , and she believed in me , and has treated me as a daughter . Please give my brother your hand , "
259736	259745	259747	259747	Mordecai	538	" The Eternal Goodness has been with you , "
259749	259760	259747	259747	Mordecai	538	" You have helped to fulfill our mother 's prayer . "
259761	259776	259778	259778	Deronda	289	" I think we will go now , shall we ? and return later , "
260038	260041	260012	260012	he	693	" brutes ; "
260808	260810	260797	260797	He	693	" fellows "
260970	261007	260960	260960	he	693	" Nothing makes a woman more of a gawky than looking out after people and showing tempers in public . A woman ought to have good manners . Else it 's intolerable to appear with her . "
261478	261496	261454	261454	Gwendolen	289	" I think of making myself accomplished while we are in town , and having singing lessons . "
261497	261500	261502	261502	Grandcourt	485	" Why ? "
261506	261509	261511	261511	Gwendolen	289	" Why ? "
261517	261598	261511	261511	Gwendolen	289	" because I ca n't eat p tť de foie gras to make me sleepy , and I ca n't smoke , and I ca n't go to the club to make me like to come away again I want a variety of ennui . What would be the most convenient time , when you are busy with your lawyers and people , for me to have lessons from that little Jewess , whose singing is getting all the rage . "
261599	261604	261606	261606	Grandcourt	485	" Whenever you like , "
261664	261704	261659	261659	he	5878	" I do n't see why a lady should sing . Amateurs make fools of themselves . A lady ca n't risk herself in that way in company . And one does n't want to hear squalling in private . "
261705	261720	261725	261725	her	289	" I like frankness : that seems to me a husband 's great charm , "
261764	261767	261768	261768	she	289	" But ; "
261776	261862	261768	261768	she	289	" I suppose you do n't object to Miss Lapidoth 's singing at our party on the fourth ? I thought of engaging her . Lady Brackenshaw had her , you know : and the Raymonds , who are very particular about their music . And Mr. Deronda , who is a musician himself and a first - rate judge , says there is no singing in such good taste as hers for a drawing - room . I think his opinion is an authority . "
261877	261891	261893	261893	Grandcourt	485	" It 's very indecent of Deronda to go about praising that girl , "
261900	261903	261905	261905	Gwendolen	289	" Indecent ! "
261930	261936	261905	261905	Gwendolen	289	" to go about praising . "
261937	261969	261893	261893	Grandcourt	485	" Yes ; and especially when she is patronized by Lady Mallinger . He ought to hold his tongue about her . Men can see what is his relation to her . "
261970	261979	261981	261981	Gwendolen	289	" Men who judge of others by themselves , "
262000	262024	262026	262026	Grandcourt	485	" Of course . And a woman should take their judgment else she is likely to run her head into the wrong place , "
262037	262047	262026	262026	Grandcourt	485	" I suppose you take Deronda for a saint . "
262048	262053	262055	262055	Gwendolen	289	" Oh dear no ! "
262076	262085	262055	262055	Gwendolen	289	" Only a little less of a monster . "
262445	262462	262466	262466	she	289	" It is not true ! What does it matter whether he believes it or not ? "
263074	263096	263061	263061	Gwendolen	289	" Perhaps you wonder to see me perhaps I ought to have written but I wished to make a particular request . "
263097	263110	263112	263112	Mirah	289	" I am glad to see you instead of having a letter , "
263123	263127	263129	263129	Hans	406	" Vandyke duchess , "
263161	263165	263166	263166	Gwendolen	289	" I thought , "
263169	263205	263166	263166	Gwendolen	289	" at least I hoped , you would not object to sing at our house on the 4th in the evening at a party like Lady Brackenshaw 's . I should be so much obliged . "
263206	263220	263222	263222	Mirah	289	" I shall be very happy to sing for you . At ten ? "
263235	263241	263242	263242	she	289	" At ten , please , "
263292	263301	263286	263286	she	289	" Mr. Deronda is in the next room . "
263302	263305	263307	263307	Mirah	289	" Yes , "
263314	263323	263307	263307	Mirah	289	" He is reading Hebrew with my brother . "
263324	263330	263332	263332	Gwendolen	289	" You have a brother ? "
263349	263379	263381	263381	Mirah	289	" Yes , a dear brother who is ill - consumptive , and Mr. Deronda is the best of friends to him , as he has been to me , "
263400	263404	263406	263406	Gwendolen	289	" Tell me , "
263421	263454	263409	263409	her	289	" tell me tell me the truth . You are sure he is quite good . You know no evil of him . Any evil that people say of him is false . "
263500	263626	263498	263498	she	289	" Who are the people that say evil of him ? I would not believe any evil of him , if an angel came to tell it me . He found me when I was so miserable I was going to drown myself ; I looked so poor and forsaken ; you would have thought I was a beggar by the wayside . And he treated me as if I had been a king 's daughter . He took me to the best of women . He found my brother for me . And he honors my brother though he too was poor oh , almost as poor as he could be . And my brother honors him . That is no light thing to say "
263645	263669	263639	263639	she	289	" for my brother is very learned and great - minded . And Mr. Deronda says there are few men equal to him . "
263810	263817	263801	263801	She	289	" Thank you , thank you , "
263835	263852	263854	263854	herself	289	" I must go , I shall see you on the fourth I am so much obliged "
264092	264105	264107	264107	Grandcourt	325	" May I ask where you have been at this extraordinary hour ? "
264109	264132	264134	264134	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , yes ; I have been to Miss Lapidoth 's , to ask her to come and sing for us , "
264152	264163	264165	264165	Grandcourt	325	" And to ask her about her relations with Deronda ? "
264214	264229	264207	264207	she	289	" Yes ; and what you said is false a low , wicked falsehood . "
264230	264238	264240	264240	Grandcourt	325	" She told you so did she ? "
264355	264368	264369	264369	he	325	" It 's of no consequence so far as her singing goes , "
264377	264389	264369	264369	he	325	" You can have her to sing , if you like . "
264404	264518	264396	264396	he	325	" But you will please to observe that you are not to go near that house again . As my wife , you must take my word about what is proper for you . When you undertook to be Mrs. Grandcourt , you undertook not to make a fool of yourself . You have been making a fool of yourself this morning ; and if you were to go on as you have begun , you might soon get yourself talked of at the clubs in a way you would not like . What do you know about the world ? You have married me , and must be guided by my opinion . "
264771	264774	264759	264759	Deronda	289	" reading Hebrew "
264980	264983	264987	264987	he	1088	" confounded nonsense "
265976	266036	265950	265950	his	343	" A Gwendolen , there 's some business about property to be explained . I have told Lush to come and explain it to you . He knows all about these things . I am going out . He can come up now . He 's the only person who can explain . I suppose you 'll not mind . "
266037	266045	266047	266047	Gwendolen	289	" You know that I do mind , "
266054	266061	266062	266062	She	289	" I shall not see him . "
266117	266214	266107	266107	he	5955	" It 's no use making a fuss . There are plenty of brutes in the world that one has to talk to . People with any savoir vivre do n't make a fuss about such things . Some business must be done . You ca n't expect agreeable people to do it . If I employ Lush , the proper thing for you is to take it as a matter of course . Not to make a fuss about it . Not to toss your head and bite your lips about people of that sort . "
266360	266376	266377	266377	he	343	" I have arranged for Lush to come up now , while I am out , "
266393	266402	266377	266377	he	343	" Shall I tell him he may come ? "
266410	266412	266407	266407	she	289	" Yes "
266423	266440	266442	266442	Grandcourt	485	" I shall come back in time to ride , if you like to get ready , "
266447	266455	266457	266457	he	343	" She is in a desperate rage , "
266654	266666	266644	266644	Grandcourt	485	" Do n't make yourself more disagreeable than nature obliges you . "
266667	266671	266673	266673	Lush	343	" That depends , "
266679	266692	266676	266676	he	343	" I will write a brief abstract for Mrs. Grandcourt to read . "
266972	266978	266950	266950	He	343	" How do you do ? "
267092	267125	267079	267079	He	343	" I need hardly say that I should not have presented myself if Mr. Grandcourt had not expressed a strong wish to that effect as no doubt he has mentioned to you . "
267171	267173	267164	267164	his	343	" you "
267224	267316	267206	267206	Lush	343	" My having been in Mr. Grandcourt 's confidence for fifteen years or more since he was a youth , in fact of course gives me a peculiar position . He can speak to me of affairs that he could not mention to any one else ; and , in fact , he could not have employed any one else in this affair . I have accepted the task out of friendship for him . Which is my apology for accepting the task if you would have preferred some one else . "
267359	267422	267426	267426	he	343	" This paper contains some information about Mr. Grandcourt 's will , an abstract of a part he wished you to know if you 'll be good enough to cast your eyes over it . But there is something I had to say by way of introduction which I hope you 'll pardon me for , if it 's not quite agreeable . "
267446	267451	267471	267471	she	289	" not quite agreeable . "
267452	267464	267466	267466	Gwendolen	289	" Say what you have to say without apologizing , please , "
267493	267511	267513	267513	Lush	343	" I have only to remind you of something that occurred before your engagement to Mr. Grandcourt , "
267529	267566	267513	267513	Lush	343	" You met a lady in Cardell Chase , if you remember , who spoke to you of her position with regard to Mr. Grandcourt . She had children with her one a very fine boy . "
267634	267720	267725	267725	Lush	343	" Mr. Grandcourt was aware that you were acquainted with this unfortunate affair beforehand , and he thinks it only right that his position and intentions should be made quite clear to you . It is an affair of property and prospects ; and if there were any objection you had to make , if you would mention it to me it is a subject which of course he would rather not speak about himself if you will be good enough just to read this . "
267823	267839	267814	267814	she	289	" Lay it on the table . And go into the next room , please . "
267858	267881	267845	267845	he	343	" My lady winces considerably . She did n't know what would be the charge for that superfine article , Henleigh Grandcourt . "
268196	268208	268190	268190	she	289	" Tell Mr. Grandcourt that his arrangements are just what I desired "
268865	268874	268876	268876	her	289	" I will insist on being separated from him "
268883	268907	268876	268876	her	289	" I will leave him whether he consents or not . If this boy becomes his heir , I have made an atonement . "
269146	269151	269133	269133	she	289	" insist on separation ! "
269213	269222	269201	269201	she	289	" If I am to have misery anyhow , "
269232	269246	269201	269201	she	289	" I had better have the misery that I can keep to myself . "
269446	269449	269444	269445	Mrs. Grandcourt	485	" run away "
270038	270050	270029	270029	her	289	" You might at least have raised your hat to her , "
270660	270662	270645	270645	she	289	" always "
271131	271151	271120	271120	she	289	" I wish you would come and see me to - morrow between five and six , Mr. Deronda . "
271162	271165	271120	271120	she	289	" Certainly , "
271788	271794	271784	271784	They	6068	" How do you do ? "
271897	271934	271876	271876	she	289	" You will wonder why I begged you to come . I wanted to ask you something . You said I was ignorant . That is true . And what can I do but ask you ? "
271981	271998	271971	271971	He	6067	" My only regret is , that I can be of so little use to you . "
272047	272097	272098	272098	She	289	" I wanted to tell you that I have always been thinking of your advice , but is it any use ? I ca n't make myself different , because things about me raise bad feelings and I must go on I can alter nothing it is no use . "
272120	272243	272107	272107	she	289	" But if I go on I shall get worse . I want not to get worse . I should like to be what you wish . There are people who are good and enjoy great things I know there are . I am a contemptible creature . I feel as if I should get wicked with hating people . I have tried to think that I would go away from everybody . But I ca n't . There are so many things to hinder me . You think , perhaps , that I do n't mind . But I do mind . I am afraid of everything . I am afraid of getting wicked . Tell me what I can do . "
272491	272502	272539	272540	the husband	1134	" Confess everything to your husband ; have nothing concealed : "
272780	272791	272777	272777	he	6070	" I will not stay longer now . Good bye . "
272908	272917	272905	272905	he	6070	" I am going yachting to the Mediterranean . "
272918	272921	272923	272923	Gwendolen	289	" When ? "
272936	272958	272905	272905	he	6070	" The day after to - morrow . The yacht is at Marseilles . Lush is gone to get everything ready . "
272959	272971	272973	272973	Gwendolen	289	" Shall I have mamma to stay with me , then ? "
272993	273002	272905	272905	he	6070	" No ; you will go with me . "
273055	273058	273059	273059	they	6081	" thank you "
273102	273119	273090	273090	Deronda	289	" I shall not see you again for a long while : I am going away , "
273192	273200	273180	273181	Sir Hugo	209	" Come immediately . Something has happened : "
273232	273242	273244	273244	Deronda	289	" It is nothing to grieve you , sir ? "
273288	273304	273286	273286	he	209	" No , Dan , no . Sit down . I have something to say . "
273326	273409	273317	273318	Sir Hugo	209	" Not to grieve me , my boy , no . At least , if there is nothing in it that will grieve you too much . But I hardly expected that this just this would ever happen . There have been reasons why I have never prepared you for it . There have been reasons why I have never told you anything about your parentage . But I have striven in every way not to make that an injury to you . "
273425	273434	273420	273420	He	209	" I have never felt it an injury . "
273519	273590	273511	273511	he	209	" I have acted in obedience to your mother 's wishes . The secrecy was her wish . But now she desires to remove it . She desires to see you . I will put this letter into your hands , which you can look at by - and - by . It will merely tell you what she wishes you to do , and where you will find her . "
273772	273779	273757	273757	his	209	" Is my father also living ? "
273789	273792	273757	273757	his	209	" No . "
273855	273904	273846	273847	the baronet	7684	" Perhaps I was wrong , Dan , to undertake what I did . And perhaps I liked it a little too well having you all to myself . But if you have had any pain which I might have helped , I ask you to forgive me . "
273905	273913	273915	273915	Deronda	289	" The forgiveness has long been there , "
273916	273964	273915	273915	Deronda	289	" The chief pain has always been on account of some one else whom I never knew whom I am now to know . It has not hindered me from feeling an affection for you which has made a large part of all the life I remember . "
273993	274099	274100	274102	BROWNING : Paracelsus	698	" If some mortal , born too soon , Were laid away in some great trance the ages Coming and going all the while till dawned His true time 's advent ; and could then record The words they spoke who kept watch by his bed , Then I might tell more of the breath so light Upon my eyelids , and the fingers warm Among my hair . Youth is confused ; yet never So dull was I but , when that spirit passed , I turned to him , scarce consciously , as turns A water - snake when fairies cross his sleep . "
274446	274458	274441	274441	he	538	" I am going to learn the truth about my birth , "
274522	274536	274538	274538	Mordecai	538	" I will ask to have the child Jacob to stay with me , "
274552	274566	274568	274568	Mirah	289	" I will drive round and ask Mrs. Cohen to let him come , "
274570	274578	274580	274580	Deronda	289	" The grandmother will deny you nothing , "
274582	274596	274597	274597	he	538	" I 'm glad you were a little wrong as well as I , "
274604	274618	274597	274597	he	538	" You thought that old Mrs. Cohen would not bear to see Mirah . "
274619	274625	274627	274627	Mordecai	538	" I undervalued her heart , "
274629	274646	274627	274627	Mordecai	538	" She is capable of rejoicing that another 's plant blooms though her own be withered . "
274647	274667	274669	274669	Mirah	289	" Oh , they are dear good people ; I feel as if we all belonged to each other , "
274680	274694	274696	274696	Deronda	289	" What should you have felt if that Ezra had been your brother ? "
274739	274755	274723	274723	Mirah	289	" He is not a bad man I think he would never forsake any one . "
274802	274811	274778	274779	Her father	923	" If he should come and find us ! "
275102	275109	275110	275111	Sir Hugo	209	" God bless you , Dan ! "
275120	275216	275110	275111	Sir Hugo	209	" Whatever else changes for you , it ca n't change my being the oldest friend you have known , and the one who has all along felt the most for you . I could n't have loved you better if you 'd been my own - only I should have been better pleased with thinking of you always as the future master of the Abbey instead of my fine nephew ; and then you would have seen it necessary for you to take a political line . However things must be as they may . "
275776	275779	275772	275772	he	6121	" I wish "

277525	277532	277502	277502	she	1581	" I knew you would be . "
277579	277594	277557	277557	She	1581	" I am your mother . But you can have no love for me . "

277620	277631	277633	277634	the mother	1566	" I am not like what you thought I was , "
277750	277761	277763	277763	Deronda	289	" I used to think that you might be suffering , "
277773	277787	277763	277763	Deronda	289	" I used to wish that I could be a comfort to you . "
277788	277803	277805	277806	the Princess	6201	" I am suffering . But with a suffering that you ca n't comfort , "
277828	277832	277833	277833	She	6201	" Sit down . "
277857	277878	277851	277851	she	6201	" I am not suffering at this moment . I am at ease now . I am able to talk . "
277932	277935	277936	277936	she	6201	" No , "
277939	278025	277936	277936	she	6201	" I did not send for you to comfort me . I could not know beforehand I do n't know now what you will feel toward me . I have not the foolish notion that you can love me merely because I am your mother , when you have never seen or heard of me in all your life . But I thought I chose something better for you than being with me . I did not think I deprived you of anything worth having . "
278026	278044	278050	278050	she	6204	" You can not wish me to believe that your affection would not have been worth having , "
278062	278073	278075	278076	the princess	6201	" I do n't mean to speak ill of myself , "
278082	278139	278075	278076	the princess	6201	" But I had not much affection to give you . I did not want affection . I had been stifled with it . I wanted to live out the life that was in me , and not to be hampered with other lives . You wonder what I was . I was no princess then . "
278164	278225	278234	278234	her	6201	" No princess in this tame life that I live in now . I was a great singer , and I acted as well as I sang . All the rest were poor beside me . Men followed me from one country to another . I was living a myriad lives in one . I did not want a child . "
278372	278447	278369	278369	her	6201	" I did not want to marry . I was forced into marrying your father forced , I mean , by my father 's wishes and commands ; and besides , it was my best way of getting some freedom . I could rule my husband , but not my father . I had a right to be free . I had a right to seek my freedom from a bondage that I hated . "
278497	278535	278495	278495	she	6201	" And the bondage I hated for myself I wanted to keep you from . What better could the most loving mother have done ? I relieved you from the bondage of having been born a Jew . "
278536	278543	278544	278544	Deronda	289	" Then I am a Jew ? "
278565	278578	278544	278544	Deronda	289	" My father was a Jew , and you are a Jewess ? "
278579	278588	278590	278591	the mother	1566	" Yes , your father was my cousin , "
278616	278623	278625	278625	Deronda	289	" I am glad of it , "
278775	278795	278772	278772	she	1566	" Why do you say you are glad ? You are an English gentleman . I secured you that . "
278796	278815	278820	278820	himself	289	" You did not know what you secured me . How could you choose my birthright for me ? "
278925	278975	278910	278910	she	1581	" I chose for you what I would have chosen for myself . How could I know that you would have the spirit of my father in you ? How could I know that you would love what I hated ? if you really love to be a Jew . "
279133	279142	279143	279143	he	6220	" Forgive me , if I speak hastily , "
279150	279184	279143	279143	he	6220	" Why have you resolved now on disclosing to me what you took care to have me brought up in ignorance of ? Why since you seem angry that I should be glad ? "
279185	279193	279195	279196	the Princess	6201	" Oh the reasons of our actions ! "
279207	279455	279195	279196	the Princess	6201	" When you are as old as I am , it will not seem so simple a question ' Why did you do this ? ' People talk of their motives in a cut and dried way . Every woman is supposed to have the same set of motives , or else to be a monster . I am not a monster , but I have not felt exactly what other women feel or say they feel , for fear of being thought unlike others . When you reproach me in your heart for sending you away from me , you mean that I ought to say I felt about you as other women say they feel about their children . I did not feel that . I was glad to be freed from you . But I did well for you , and I gave you your father 's fortune . Do I seem now to be revoking everything ? Well , there are reasons . I feel many things that I can not understand . A fatal illness has been growing in me for a year . I shall very likely not live another year . I will not deny anything I have done . I will not pretend to love where I have no love . But shadows are rising round me . Sickness makes them . If I have wronged the dead I have but little time to do what I left undone . "
279783	279872	279773	279773	her	4024	" Sir Hugo has written much about you . He tells me you have a wonderful mind you comprehend everything you are wiser than he is with all his sixty years . You say you are glad to know that you were born a Jew . I am not going to tell you that I have changed my mind about that . Your feelings are against mine . You do n't thank me for what I did . Shall you comprehend your mother , or only blame her ? "
279873	279889	279891	279891	Deronda	289	" There is not a fibre within me but makes me wish to comprehend her , "
279899	279937	279891	279891	Deronda	289	" It is a bitter reversal of my longing to think of blaming her . What I have been most trying to do for fifteen years is to have some understanding of those who differ from myself . "
279938	279949	279951	279952	the mother	1566	" Then you have become unlike your grandfather in that . "
279954	280251	279951	279952	the mother	1566	" though you are a young copy of him in your face . He never comprehended me , or if he did , he only thought of fettering me into obedience . I was to be what he called ' the Jewish woman ' under pain of his curse . I was to feel everything I did not feel , and believe everything I did not believe . I was to feel awe for the bit of parchment in the mezuza over the door ; to dread lest a bit of butter should touch a bit of meat ; to think it beautiful that men should bind the tephillin on them , and women not , to adore the wisdom of such laws , however silly they might seem to me . I was to love the long prayers in the ugly synagogue , and the howling , and the gabbling , and the dreadful fasts , and the tiresome feasts , and my father 's endless discoursing about our people , which was a thunder without meaning in my ears . I was to care forever about what Israel had been ; and I did not care at all . I cared for the wide world , and all that I could represent in it . I hated living under the shadow of my father 's strictness . Teaching , teaching for everlasting ' this you must be , ' ' that you must not be ' pressed on me like a frame that got tighter and tighter as I grew . I wanted to live a large life , with freedom to do what every one else did , and be carried along in a great current , not obliged to care . Ah ! "
280263	280304	280253	280253	her	6231	" you are glad to have been born a Jew . You say so . That is because you have not been brought up as a Jew . That separateness seems sweet to you because I saved you from it . "
280305	280322	280324	280324	Deronda	289	" When you resolved on that , you meant that I should never know my origin ? "
280328	280341	280324	280324	Deronda	289	" You have at least changed in your feeling on that point . "
280342	280384	280385	280385	she	6232	" Yes , that was what I meant . That is what I persevered in . And it is not true to say that I have changed . Things have changed in spite of me . I am still the same Leonora "
280393	280411	280412	280412	she	6232	" here within me is the same desire , the same will , the same choice , but "
280448	280489	280490	280490	she	6232	" events come upon us like evil enchantments : and thoughts , feelings , apparitions in the darkness are events are they not ? I do n't consent . We only consent to what we love . I obey something tyrannic "
280496	280554	280490	280490	she	6232	" I am forced to be withered , to feel pain , to be dying slowly . Do I love that ? Well , I have been forced to obey my dead father . I have been forced to tell you that you are a Jew , and deliver to you what he commanded me to deliver . "
280555	280579	280581	280581	Deronda	289	" I beseech you to tell me what moved you when you were young , I mean to take the course you did , "
280609	280651	280581	280581	Deronda	289	" I gather that my grandfather opposed your bent to be an artist . Though my own experience has been quite different , I enter into the painfulness of your struggle . I can imagine the hardship of an enforced renunciation . "
280652	280655	280657	280658	the Princess	6201	" No , "
280673	280862	280661	280661	her	6201	" You are not a woman . You may try but you can never imagine what it is to have a man 's force of genius in you , and yet to suffer the slavery of being a girl . To have a pattern cut out ' this is the Jewish woman ; this is what you must be ; this is what you are wanted for ; a woman 's heart must be of such a size and no larger , else it must be pressed small , like Chinese feet ; her happiness is to be made as cakes are , by a fixed receipt . ' That was what my father wanted . He wished I had been a son ; he cared for me as a make - shift link . His heart was set on his Judaism . He hated that Jewish women should be thought of by the Christian world as a sort of ware to make public singers and actresses of . As if we were not the more enviable for that ! That is a chance of escaping from bondage . "
280863	280871	280873	280873	Deronda	289	" Was my grandfather a learned man ? "
280898	281006	280889	280889	She	1581	" Oh , yes , and a clever physician and good : I do n't deny that he was good . A man to be admired in a play grand , with an iron will . Like the old Foscari before he pardons . But such men turn their wives and daughters into slaves . They would rule the world if they could ; but not ruling the world , they throw all the weight of their will on the necks and souls of women . But nature sometimes thwarts them . My father had no other child than his daughter , and she was like himself . "
281029	281226	281018	281018	she	6237	" Your father was different . Unlike me all lovingness and affection . I knew I could rule him ; and I made him secretly promise me , before I married him , that he would put no hindrance in the way of my being an artist . My father was on his deathbed when we were married : from the first he had fixed his mind on my marrying my cousin Ephraim . And when a woman 's will is as strong as the man 's who wants to govern her , half her strength must be concealment . I meant to have my will in the end , but I could only have it by seeming to obey . I had an awe of my father always I had had an awe of him : it was impossible to help it . I hated to feel awed I wished I could have defied him openly ; but I never could . It was what I could not imagine : I could not act it to myself that I should begin to defy my father openly and succeed . And I never would risk failure . "
281432	281440	281428	281428	he	2994	" Tell me only what is necessary , "
281468	281476	281459	281459	He	2994	" Where was my grandfather 's home ? "
281477	281505	281459	281459	He	2994	" Here in Genoa , where I was married ; and his family had lived here generations ago . But my father had been in various countries . "
281506	281515	281459	281459	He	2994	" You must surely have lived in England ? "
281516	281810	281811	281811	She	6245	" My mother was English a Jewess of Portuguese descent . My father married her in England . Certain circumstances of that marriage made all the difference in my life : through that marriage my father thwarted his own plans . My mother 's sister was a singer , and afterward she married the English partner of a merchant 's house here in Genoa , and they came and lived here eleven years . My mother died when I was eight years old , and my father allowed me to be continually with my Aunt Leonora and be taught under her eyes , as if he had not minded the danger of her encouraging my wish to be a singer , as she had been . But this was it I saw it again and again in my father : he did not guard against consequences , because he felt sure he could hinder them if he liked . Before my aunt left Genoa , I had had enough teaching to bring out the born singer and actress within me : my father did not know everything that was done ; but he knew that I was taught music and singing he knew my inclination . That was nothing to him : he meant that I should obey his will . And he was resolved that I should marry my cousin Ephraim , the only one left of my father 's family that he knew . I wanted not to marry . I thought of all plans to resist it , but at last I found that I could rule my cousin , and I consented . My father died three weeks after we were married , and then I had my way ! "
281835	281851	281828	281828	she	6245	" It has not lasted , though . My father is getting his way now . "
281866	281957	281852	281852	She	6245	" You are like him but milder there is something of your own father in you ; and he made it the labor of his life to devote himself to me : wound up his money - changing and banking , and lived to wait upon me he went against his conscience for me . As I loved the life of my art , so he loved me . Let me look at your hand again : the hand with the ring on . It was your father 's ring . "
282051	282080	282049	282049	he	6247	" Mother ! take us all into your heart the living and the dead . Forgive every thing that hurts you in the past . Take my affection . "
282101	282113	282114	282114	she	6248	" I reject nothing , but I have nothing to give , "
282162	282549	282160	282160	her	6248	" It is better so . We must part again soon and you owe me no duties . I did not wish you to be born . I parted with you willingly . When your father died I resolved that I would have no more ties , but such as I could free myself from . I was the Alcharisi you have heard of : the name had magic wherever it was carried . Men courted me . Sir Hugo Mallinger was one who wished to marry me . He was madly in love with me . One day I asked him , ' Is there a man capable of doing something for love of me , and expecting nothing in return ? ' He said : ' What is it you want done ? ' I said , ' Take my boy and bring him up as an Englishman , and never let him know anything about his parents . ' You were little more than two years old , and were sitting on his foot . He declared that he would pay money to have such a boy . I had not meditated much on the plan beforehand , but as soon as I had spoken about it , it took possession of me as something I could not rest without doing . At first he thought I was not serious , but I convinced him , and he was never surprised at anything . He agreed that it would be for your good , and the finest thing for you . A great singer and actress is a queen , but she gives no royalty to her son . All that happened at Naples . And afterward I made Sir Hugo the trustee of your fortune . That is what I did ; and I had a joy in doing it . My father had tyrannized over me he cared more about a grandson to come than he did about me : I counted as nothing . You were to be such a Jew as he ; you were to be what he wanted . But you were my son , and it was my turn to say what you should be . I said you should not know you were a Jew . "
282550	282568	282570	282570	Deronda	289	" And for months events have been preparing me to be glad that I am a Jew , "
282586	282629	282570	282570	Deronda	289	" It would always have been better that I should have known the truth . I have always been rebelling against the secrecy that looked like shame . It is no shame to have Jewish parents the shame is to disown it . "
282630	282648	282650	282651	his mother	1581	" You say it was a shame to me , then , that I used that secrecy , "
282660	282743	282650	282651	his mother	1581	" There is no shame attaching to me . I have no reason to be ashamed . I rid myself of the Jewish tatters and gibberish that make people nudge each other at sight of us , as if we were tattooed under our clothes , though our faces are as whole as theirs . I delivered you from the pelting contempt that pursues Jewish separateness . I am not ashamed that I did it . It was the better for you . "
282744	282783	282785	282785	Deronda	289	" Then why have you now undone the secrecy ? no , not undone it the effects will never be undone . But why have you now sent for me to tell me that I am a Jew ? "
282816	282823	282825	282826	the Princess	6201	" Why ? ah , why ? "
282869	282957	282858	282858	she	6252	" I ca n't explain ; I can only say what is . I do n't love my father 's religion now any more than I did then . Before I married the second time I was baptized ; I made myself like the people I lived among . I had a right to do it ; I was not like a brute , obliged to go with my own herd . I have not repented ; I will not say that I have repented . But yet "
283016	283237	283000	283000	she	6252	" It is illness , I do n't doubt that it has been gathering illness my mind has gone back : more than a year ago it began . You see my gray hair , my worn look : it has all come fast . Sometimes I am in an agony of pain I dare say I shall be to - night . Then it is as if all the life I have chosen to live , all thoughts , all will , forsook me and left me alone in spots of memory , and I ca n't get away : my pain seems to keep me there . My childhood my girlhood the day of my marriage the day of my father 's death there seems to be nothing since . Then a great horror comes over me : what do I know of life or death ? and what my father called ' right ' may be a power that is laying hold of me that is clutching me now . Well , I will satisfy him . I can not go into the darkness without satisfying him . I have hidden what was his . I thought once I would burn it . I have not burned it . I thank God I have not burned it ! "
283273	283292	283249	283249	Deronda	289	" Will you not spare yourself this evening ? Let us leave the rest till to - morrow . "
283293	283296	283297	283297	she	6257	" No , "
283301	283459	283460	283460	she	6257	" I will confess it all , now that I have come up to it . Often when I am at ease it all fades away ; my whole self comes quite back ; but I know it will sink away again , and the other will come the poor , solitary , forsaken remains of self , that can resist nothing . It was my nature to resist , and say , ' I have a right to resist . ' Well , I say so still when I have any strength in me . You have heard me say it , and I do n't withdraw it . But when my strength goes , some other right forces itself upon me like iron in an inexorable hand ; and even when I am at ease , it is beginning to make ghosts upon the daylight . And now you have made it worse for me , "
283470	283487	283488	283488	she	6257	" but I shall have told you everything . And what reproach is there against me , "
283533	283561	283530	283530	you	6259	" she ended , with a new marvelous alternation . It was as if her mind were breaking into several , one jarring the other into impulsive action .
283562	283568	283570	283570	Deronda	289	" Who is Joseph Kalonymos ? "
283588	284030	284031	284031	She	6265	" Ah ! some vengeance sent him back from the East , that he might see you and come to reproach me . He was my father 's friend . He knew of your birth : he knew of my husband 's death , and once , twenty years ago , after he had been away in the Levant , he came to see me and inquire about you . I told him that you were dead : I meant you to be dead to all the world of my childhood . If I had said that your were living , he would have interfered with my plans : he would have taken on him to represent my father , and have tried to make me recall what I had done . What could I do but say you were dead ? The act was done . If I had told him of it there would have been trouble and scandal and all to conquer me , who would not have been conquered . I was strong then , and I would have had my will , though there might have been a hard fight against me . I took the way to have it without any fight . I felt then that I was not really deceiving : it would have come to the same in the end ; or if not to the same , to something worse . He believed me and begged that I would give up to him the chest that my father had charged me and my husband to deliver to our eldest son . I knew what was in the chest things that had been dinned in my ears since I had had any understanding things that were thrust on my mind that I might feel them like a wall around my life my life that was growing like a tree . Once , after my husband died , I was going to burn the chest . But it was difficult to burn ; and burning a chest and papers looks like a shameful act . I have committed no shameful act except what Jews would call shameful . I had kept the chest , and I gave it to Joseph Kalonymos . He went away mournful , and said , ' If you marry again , and if another grandson is born to him who is departed , I will deliver up the chest to him . ' I bowed in silence . I meant not to marry again no more than I meant to be the shattered woman that I am now . "
284080	284127	284062	284062	her	6265	" But months ago this Kalonymos saw you in the synagogue at Frankfort . He saw you enter the hotel , and he went to ask your name . There was nobody else in the world to whom the name would have told anything about me . "
284128	284137	284139	284139	Deronda	289	" Then it is not my real name ? "
284159	284167	284169	284170	his mother	1581	" Oh , as real as another , "
284174	284516	284169	284170	his mother	1581	" The Jews have always been changing their names . My father 's family had kept the name of Charisi : my husband was a Charisi . When I came out as a singer , we made it Alcharisi . But there had been a branch of the family my father had lost sight of who called themselves Deronda , and when I wanted a name for you , and Sir Hugo said , ' Let it be a foreign name , ' I thought of Deronda . But Joseph Kalonymos had heard my father speak of the Deronda branch , and the name confirmed his suspicion . He began to suspect what had been done . It was as if everything had been whispered to him in the air . He found out where I was . He took a journey into Russia to see me ; he found me weak and shattered . He had come back again , with his white hair , and with rage in his soul against me . He said I was going down to the grave clad in falsehood and robbery falsehood to my father and robbery of my own child . He accused me of having kept the knowledge of your birth from you , and having brought you up as if you had been the son of an English gentleman . Well , it was true ; and twenty years before I would have maintained that I had a right to do it . But I can maintain nothing now . No faith is strong within me . My father may have God on his side . This man 's words were like lion 's teeth upon me . My father 's threats eat into me with my pain . If I tell everything if I deliver up everything what else can be demanded of me ? I can not make myself love the people I have never loved is it not enough that I lost the life I did love ? "
284620	284626	284606	284606	he	6269	" Mother , take comfort ! "
284688	284704	284706	284706	Deronda	289	" Is it not possible that I could be near you often and comfort you ? "
284721	284727	284728	284728	she	6268	" No , not possible , "
284749	284766	284728	284728	she	6268	" I have a husband and five children . None of them know of your existence . "
284781	284788	284789	284789	she	6268	" You wonder why I married , "
284804	284905	284789	284789	she	6268	" I meant never to marry again . I meant to be free and to live for my art . I had parted with you . I had no bonds . For nine years I was a queen . I enjoyed the life I had longed for . But something befell me . It was like a fit of forgetfulness . I began to sing out of tune . They told me of it . Another woman was thrusting herself in my place . I could not endure the prospect of failure and decline . It was horrible to me . "
284925	284997	284906	284906	She	6268	" It drove me to marry . I made believe that I preferred being the wife of a Russian noble to being the greatest lyric actress of Europe ; I made believe I acted that part . It was because I felt my greatness sinking away from me , as I feel my life sinking now . I would not wait till men said , ' She had better go . ' "
285016	285068	284998	284998	She	6268	" I repented . It was a resolve taken in desperation . That singing out of tune was only like a fit of illness ; it went away . I repented ; but it was too late . I could not go back . All things hindered , me all things . "
285142	285150	285136	285136	she	6268	" I can bear no more now . "
285164	285191	285136	285136	she	6268	" Stay . How do I know that I can see you again ? I can not bear to be seen when I am in pain . "
285207	285254	285192	285192	She	6268	" This is addressed to the banking - house in Mainz , where you are to go for your grandfather 's chest . It is a letter written by Joseph Kalonymos : if he is not there himself , this order of his will be obeyed . "
285273	285283	285262	285262	she	6268	" Kneel again , and let me kiss you . "
285303	285317	285318	285318	she	6268	" You see , I had no life left to love you with , "
285326	285362	285318	285318	she	6268	" But there is more fortune for you . Sir Hugo was to keep it in reserve . I gave you all your father 's fortune . They can never accuse me of robbery there . "
285363	285376	285378	285378	Deronda	289	" If you had needed anything I would have worked for you , "
285396	285409	285411	285412	his mother	1581	" I need nothing that the skill of man can give me , "
285424	285449	285411	285412	his mother	1581	" But perhaps now I have satisfied my father 's will , your face will come instead of his your young , loving face . "
285450	285458	285460	285460	Deronda	289	" But you will see me again ? "
285464	285476	285411	285412	his mother	1581	" Yes perhaps . Wait , wait . Leave me now . "
285480	285516	285517	285518	LA ROCHEFOUCAULD	709	" La meme fermetť qui sert a rťsister a l'amour sert aussi a le rendre violent et durable ; et les personnes faibles qui sont toujours agitťes des passions n'en sont presque jamais vťritablement remplies . "

287321	287327	287316	287316	he	6335	" No ! are you ? "
287344	287366	287367	287367	I	0	" A wretch so empty that if e'er there be In nature found the least vacuity ' Twill be in him . "
287521	287611	287496	287496	He	6335	" My good fellow , your attempts at the historic and poetic are simply pitiable . Your brush is just that of a successful portrait - painter it has a little truth and a great facility in falsehood your idealism will never do for gods and goddesses and heroic story , but it may fetch a high price as flattery . Fate , my friend , has made you the hinder wheel rota posterior curras , et in axe secundo run behind , because you ca n't help it . "
287923	287935	287894	287894	he	209	" O night , O blackness , etc . , etc . "
288078	288091	288068	288089	my Lord Bolingbroke , who knew no Hebrew , but " understood that sort of learning and what is writ about it	719	" understood that sort of learning and what is writ about it . "
288144	288155	288133	288133	she	289	" hair is like a flock of goats on Mount Gilead "
288442	288462	288464	288464	Deronda	289	" Already he is beginning to play at love : he is taking the whole affair as a comedy , "
288468	288585	288464	288464	Deronda	289	" he knows very well that there is no chance for him . Just like him never opening his eyes on any possible objection I could have to receive his outpourings about Mirah . Poor old Hans ! If we were under a fiery hail together he would howl like a Greek , and if I did not howl too it would never occur to him that I was as badly off as he . And yet he is tender - hearted and affectionate in intention , and I ca n't say that he is not active in imagining what goes on in other people but then he always imagines it to fit his own inclination . "
289059	289066	289067	289067	Mirah	289	" Ezra , how is it ? "
289073	289090	289067	289067	Mirah	289	" I am continually going to speak to Mr. Deronda as if he were a Jew ? "
289100	289129	289091	289091	He	406	" I suppose it is because he treats us as if he were our brother . But he loves not to have the difference of birth dwelt upon . "
289130	289144	289146	289146	Mirah	289	" He has never lived with his parents , Mr. Hans , says , "
289167	289178	289180	289180	Mordecai	538	" Seek not to know such things from Mr. Hans , "
289197	289214	289185	289185	his	538	" What Daniel Deronda wishes us to know about himself is for him to tell us . "
289240	289251	289252	289252	she	289	" I see no one so great as my brother , "
289284	289463	289260	289260	she	289	" It is difficult to think that he belongs to the same world as those people I used to live amongst . I told you once that they made life seem like a madhouse ; but when I am with Ezra he makes me feel that his life is a great good , though he has suffered so much ; not like me , who wanted to die because I had suffered a little , and only for a little while . His soul is so full , it is impossible for him to wish for death as I did . I get the same sort of feeling from him that I got yesterday , when I was tired , and came home through the park after the sweet rain had fallen and the sunshine lay on the grass and flowers . Everything in the sky and under the sky looked so pure and beautiful that the weariness and trouble and folly seemed only a small part of what is , and I became more patient and hopeful . "
289567	289580	289582	289583	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Is there any fresh trouble on your mind , my dear ? "
289602	289647	289599	289599	she	289	" I am too ready to speak of troubles , I think . It seems unkind to put anything painful into other people 's minds , unless one were sure it would hinder something worse . And perhaps I am too hasty and fearful . "
289648	289704	289711	289711	she	289	" Oh , my dear , mothers are made to like pain and trouble for the sake of their children . Is it because the singing lessons are so few , and are likely to fall off when the season comes to an end ? Success in these things ca n't come all at once . "
289733	289739	289741	289741	Mirah	289	" No , not that , "
289748	289840	289842	289842	he	6379	" I have been a little disappointed because so many ladies said they wanted me to give them or their daughters lessons , and then I never heard of them again , But perhaps after the holidays I shall teach in some schools . Besides , you know , I am as rich as a princess now . I have not touched the hundred pounds that Mrs. Klesmer gave me ; and I should never be afraid that Ezra would be in want of anything , because there is Mr. Deronda , "
289886	289886	289870	289870	I	0	"
289887	289898	289900	289901	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" But there is some other fear on your mind , "
289905	289978	289900	289901	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" a fear of something that may disturb your peace ; Do n't be forecasting evil , dear child , unless it is what you can guard against . Anxiety is good for nothing if we ca n't turn it into a defense . But there 's no defense against all the things that might be . Have you any more reason for being anxious now than you had a month ago ? "
289979	289985	289987	289987	Mirah	289	" Yes , I have , "
289989	290041	289987	289987	Mirah	289	" I have kept it from Ezra . I have not dared to tell him . Pray forgive me that I ca n't do without telling you . I have more reason for being anxious . It is five days ago now . I am quite sure I saw my father . "
290071	290078	290079	290079	Mirah	289	" The year has changed him , "
290083	290199	290079	290079	Mirah	289	" He had already been much altered and worn in the time before I left him . You remember I said how he used sometimes to cry . He was always excited one way or the other . I have told Ezra everything that I told you , and he says that my father had taken to gambling , which makes people easily distressed , and then again exalted . And now it was only a moment that I saw him his face was more haggard , and his clothes were shabby . He was with a much worse - looking man , who carried something , and they were hurrying along after an omnibus . "
290200	290214	289987	289987	Mirah	289	" Well , child , he did not see you , I hope ? "
290215	290471	290079	290079	Mirah	289	" No . I had just come from Mrs. Raymond 's , and I was waiting to cross near the Marble Arch . Soon he was on the omnibus and gone out of sight . It was a dreadful moment . My old life seemed to have come back again , and it was worse than it had ever been before . And I could not help feeling it a new deliverance that he was gone out of sight without knowing that I was there . And yet it hurt me that I was feeling so it seemed hateful in me almost like words I once had to speak in a play , that ' I had warmed my hands in the blood of my kindred . ' For where might my father be going ? What may become of him ? And his having a daughter who would own him in spite of all , might have hindered the worst . Is there any pain like seeing what ought to be the best things in life turned into the worst ? All those opposite feelings were meeting and pressing against each other , and took up all my strength . No one could act that . Acting is slow and poor to what we go through within . I do n't know how I called a cab . I only remember that I was in it when I began to think , ' I can not tell Ezra ; he must not know . ' "
290472	290480	290481	290482	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You are afraid of grieving him ? "
290492	290500	290502	290502	Mirah	289	" Yes and there is something more , "
290522	290720	290508	290508	she	289	" I want to tell you ; I can not tell any one else . I could not have told my own mother : I should have closed it up before her . I feel shame for my father , and it is perhaps strange but the shame is greater before Ezra than before any one else in the world . He desired me to tell him all about my life , and I obeyed him . But it is always like a smart to me to know that those things about my father are in Ezra 's mind . And can you believe it ? when the thought haunts me how it would be if my father were to come and show himself before us both , what seems as if it would scorch me most is seeing my father shrinking before Ezra . That is the truth . I do n't know whether it is a right feeling . But I ca n't help thinking that I would rather try to maintain my father in secret , and bear a great deal in that way , if I could hinder him from meeting my brother . "
290721	290731	290733	290734	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You must not encourage that feeling , Mirah , "
290738	290759	290733	290734	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" It would be very dangerous ; it would be wrong . You must not have concealment of that sort . "
290760	290775	290777	290777	Mirah	289	" But ought I now to tell Ezra that I have seen my father ? "
290785	290788	290789	290790	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" No , "
290795	290886	290789	290790	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" I do n't know that it is necessary to do that . Your father may go away with the birds . It is not clear that he came after you ; you may never see him again . And then your brother will have been spared a useless anxiety . But promise me that if your father sees you gets hold of you in any way again and you will let us all know . Promise me that solemnly , Mirah . I have a right to ask it . "
290907	290960	290897	290897	her	289	" Since you ask it , I do promise . I will bear this feeling of shame . I have been so long used to think that I must bear that sort of inward pain . But the shame for my father burns me more when I think of his meeting Ezra . "
290981	291019	290961	290961	She	289	" And we are his children and he was once young like us and my mother loved him . Oh ! I can not help seeing it all close , and it hurts me like a cruelty . "
292039	292047	292049	292049	Kate	422	" Think of our surprise , Mirah , "
292051	292072	292049	292049	Kate	422	" We were speaking of Mr. Deronda and the Mallingers , and it turns out that Miss Gascoigne knows them . "
292073	292080	292082	292082	Anna	229	" I only knew about them , "
292109	292147	292098	292100	the lovely Jewess	535	" I have not even seen them . But some months ago , my cousin married Sir Hugo Mallinger 's nephew , Mr. Grandcourt , who lived in Sir Hugo 's place at Diplow , near us . "
292148	292151	292153	292153	Mab	424	" There ! "
292159	292177	292153	292153	Mab	424	" Something must come of that . Mrs. Grandcourt , the Vandyke duchess , is your cousin ? "
292178	292188	292190	292190	Anna	229	" Oh , yes ; I was her bridesmaid , "
292192	292303	292190	292190	Anna	229	" Her mamma and mine are sisters . My aunt was much richer before last year , but then she and mamma lost all their fortune . Papa is a clergyman , you know , so it makes very little difference to us , except that we keep no carriage , and have no dinner parties and I like it better . But it was very sad for poor Aunt Davilow , for she could not live with us , because she has four daughters besides Gwendolen ; but then , when she married Mr. Grandcourt , it did not signify so much , because of his being so rich . "
292304	292314	292316	292316	Mab	424	" Oh , this finding out relationships is delightful ! "
292318	292350	292316	292316	Mab	424	" It is like a Chinese puzzle that one has to fit together . I feel sure something wonderful may be made of it , but I ca n't tell what . "
292351	292357	292359	292359	Amy	423	" Dear me , Mab , "
292361	292391	292359	292359	Amy	423	" relationships must branch out . The only difference is , that we happen to know some of the people concerned . Such things are going on every day . "
292392	292410	292412	292412	Mab	424	" And pray , Amy , why do you insist on the number nine being so wonderful ? "
292414	292451	292412	292412	Mab	424	" I am sure that is happening every day . Never mind , Miss Gascoigne ; please go on . And Mr. Deronda ? have you never seen Mr. Deronda ? You must bring him in . "
292452	292461	292463	292463	Anna	229	" No , I have not seen him , "
292465	292629	292463	292463	Anna	229	" but he was at Diplow before my cousin was married , and I have heard my aunt speaking of him to papa . She said what you have been saying about him only not so much : I mean , about Mr. Deronda living with Sir Hugo Mallinger , and being so nice , she thought . We talk a great deal about every one who comes near Pennicote , because it is so seldom there is any one new . But I remember , when I asked Gwendolen what she thought of Mr. Deronda , she said , ' Do n't mention it , Anna : but I think his hair is dark . ' That was her droll way of answering : she was always so lively . It is really rather wonderful that I should come to hear so much about him , all through Mr. Hans knowing Rex , and then my having the pleasure of knowing you , "
292642	292676	292678	292679	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" The pleasure is on our side too ; but the wonder would have been , if you had come to this house without hearing of Mr. Deronda would n't it , Mirah ? "
292712	292722	292724	292725	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" My son calls Mrs. Grandcourt the Vandyke duchess , "
292732	292741	292724	292725	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" he thinks her so striking and picturesque . "
292742	292745	292747	292747	Anna	229	" Yes , "
292749	292775	292747	292747	Anna	229	" Gwendolen was always so beautiful people fell dreadfully in love with her . I thought it a pity , because it made them unhappy . "
292776	292789	292791	292792	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" And how do you like Mr. Grandcourt , the happy lover ? "
292824	292842	292844	292844	Anna	229	" Papa approved of Gwendolen 's accepting him , and my aunt says he is very generous , "
292874	292935	292871	292871	she	229	" else I should have thought he was not very nice rather proud , and not at all lively , like Gwendolen . I should have thought some one younger and more lively would have suited her better . But , perhaps , having a brother who seems to us better than any one makes us think worse of others . "
292936	292944	292946	292946	Mab	424	" Wait till you see Mr. Deronda , "
292951	292960	292946	292946	Mab	424	" Nobody 's brother will do after him . "
292961	292971	292973	292973	Kate	422	" Our brothers must do for people 's husbands , "
292977	292995	292973	292973	Kate	422	" because they will not get Mr. Deronda . No woman will do for him to marry . "
292996	293007	293009	293009	Mab	424	" No woman ought to want him to marry him , "
293014	293046	293009	293009	Mab	424	" I never should . Fancy finding out that he had a tailor 's bill , and used boot - hooks , like Hans . Who ever thought of his marrying ? "
293047	293051	293053	293053	Kate	422	" I have , "
293055	293115	293053	293053	Kate	422	" When I drew a wedding for a frontispiece to ' Hearts and Diamonds , ' I made a sort of likeness to him for the bridegroom , and I went about looking for a grand woman who would do for his countess , but I saw none that would not be poor creatures by the side of him . "
293116	293126	293128	293129	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" You should have seen this Mrs. Grandcourt then , "
293131	293177	293128	293129	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Hans says that she and Mr. Deronda set each other off when they are side by side . She is tall and fair . But you know her , Mirah you can always say something descriptive . What do you think of Mrs. Grandcourt ? "
293178	293191	293193	293193	Mirah	289	" I think she is the Princess of Eboli in Don Carlos , "
293228	293240	293242	293243	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Your comparison is a riddle for me , my dear , "
293247	293258	293260	293260	Mirah	289	" You said that Mrs. Grandcourt was tall and fair , "
293265	293271	293260	293260	Mirah	289	" That is quite true . "
293303	293314	293315	293315	she	418	" Mrs. Grandcourt had thought of having lessons of Mirah , "
293321	293346	293315	293315	she	418	" But many have talked of having lessons , and then have found no time . Fashionable ladies have too much work to do . "
293486	293530	293484	293484	she	418	" Ezra , does it ever hurt your love for Mr. Deronda that so much of his life was all hidden away from you that he is amongst persons and cares about persons who are all so unlike us I mean unlike you ? "
293531	293537	293539	293539	Mordecai	538	" No , assuredly no , "
293541	293565	293539	293539	Mordecai	538	" Rather it is a precious thought to me that he has a preparation which I lacked , and is an accomplished Egyptian . "
293585	293608	293582	293582	he	538	" I have the more to give him , since his treasure differs from mine . That is a blessedness in friendship . "
293614	293617	293618	293618	she	289	" Still , "
293621	293706	293618	293618	she	289	" it would be a trial to your love for him if that other part of his life were like a crowd in which he had got entangled , so that he was carried away from you I mean in his thoughts , and not merely carried out of sight as he is now and not merely for a little while , but continually . How should you bear that ! Our religion commands us to bear . But how should you bear it ? "
293707	293722	293724	293724	Mordecai	538	" Not well , my sister not well ; but it will never happen , "
293955	294003	293951	293951	she	289	" Shall I tell you what is the difference between you and me , Ezra ? You are a spring in the drought , and I am an acorn - cup ; the waters of heaven fill me , but the least little shake leaves me empty . "
294004	294012	294016	294016	He	538	" Why , what has shaken thee ? "
294036	294039	294041	294041	Mirah	289	" Thoughts , "
294043	294068	294041	294041	Mirah	289	" thoughts that come like the breeze and shake me bad people , wrong things , misery and how they might touch our life . "
294069	294096	294101	294101	she	289	" We must take our portion , Mirah . It is there . On whose shoulder would we lay it , that we might be free ? "
294115	294126	294101	294101	she	289	" My desolation does begin to make A better life . "
294183	294197	294177	294177	he	538	" I leave to - day . Come and see me at once . "
294379	294389	294374	294374	He	2994	" You are quite relieved now , I trust ? "
294390	294411	294412	294412	she	6201	" Yes , I am at ease again . Is there anything more that you would like to ask me ? "
294427	294444	294446	294446	Deronda	289	" Can I find the house in Genoa where you used to live with my grandfather ? "
294448	294451	294452	294452	she	6201	" No , "
294463	294556	294452	294452	she	6201	" it is pulled down not to be found . But about our family , and where my father lived at various times you will find all that among the papers in the chest , better than I can tell you . My father , I told you , was a physician . My mother was a Morteira . I used to hear all those things without listening . You will find them all . I was born amongst them without my will . I banished them as soon as I could . "
294568	294595	294557	294557	Deronda	289	" Anything else that I should desire to know from you could only be what it is some satisfaction to your own feeling to tell me . "
294596	294611	294613	294614	the Princess	6201	" I think I have told you everything that could be demanded of me , "
294644	294671	294638	294638	she	6201	" I have done it all . I have confessed all . I will not go through it again . I will save myself from agitation . "
294738	294752	294736	294736	his	6445	" Then are we to part and I never be anything to you ? "
294753	294759	294761	294762	the Princess	6201	" It is better so , "
294771	294808	294809	294809	she	6201	" There could be nothing but hard duty for you , even if it were possible for you to take the place of my son . You would not love me . Do n't deny it , "
294819	294870	294809	294809	she	6201	" I know what is the truth . You do n't like what I did . You are angry with me . You think I robbed you of something . You are on your grandfather 's side , and you will always have a condemnation of me in your heart . "
294921	294940	294917	294917	her	1581	" You are wrong to be angry with me . You are the better for what I did . "
294951	294961	294946	294946	she	1581	" And now tell me what you shall do ? "
294962	294970	294972	294972	Deronda	289	" Do you mean now , immediately , "
294974	294985	294946	294946	she	1581	" or as to the course of my future life ? "
294986	295009	294946	294946	she	1581	" I mean in the future . What difference will it make to you that I have told you about your birth ? "
295010	295016	295018	295018	Deronda	289	" A very great difference , "
295022	295036	295018	295018	Deronda	289	" I can hardly think of anything that would make a greater difference . "
295037	295044	295046	295047	the Princess	6201	" What shall you do then ? "
295053	295073	295046	295047	the Princess	6201	" Make yourself just like your grandfather be what he wished you turn yourself into a Jew like him ? "
295074	295107	295109	295109	Deronda	289	" That is impossible . The effect of my education can never be done away with . The Christian sympathies in which my mind was reared can never die out of me , "
295117	295173	295109	295109	Deronda	289	" But I consider it my duty it is the impulse of my feeling to identify myself , as far as possible , with my hereditary people , and if I can see any work to be done for them that I can give my soul and hand to I shall choose to do it . "
295242	295251	295228	295228	She	1581	" You are in love with a Jewess . "
295257	295268	295252	295252	Deronda	289	" My reasons would be independent of any such fact . "
295269	295281	295283	295284	the Princess	6201	" I know better . I have seen what men are , "
295288	295314	295315	295315	she	1581	" Tell me the truth . She is a Jewess who will not accept any one but a Jew . There are a few such , "
295388	295409	295385	295385	she	1581	" You love her as your father loved me , and she draws you after her as I drew him . "
295440	295459	295433	295433	She	1581	" But I was leading him the other way . And now your grandfather is getting his revenge . "
295460	295463	295465	295465	Deronda	289	" Mother , "
295469	295607	295465	295465	Deronda	289	" do n't let us think of it in that way . I will admit that there may come some benefit from the education you chose for me . I prefer cherishing the benefit with gratitude , to dwelling with resentment on the injury . I think it would have been right that I should have been brought up with the consciousness that I was a Jew , but it must always have been a good to me to have as wide an instruction and sympathy as possible . And now , you have restored me my inheritance events have brought a fuller restitution than you could have made you have been saved from robbing my people of my service and me of my duty : can you not bring your whole soul to consent to this ? "
295648	295685	295640	295640	He	6458	" You have told me that you sought what you held the best for me : open your heart to relenting and love toward my grandfather , who sought what he held the best for you . "
295686	295693	295694	295694	she	1581	" Not for me , no , "
295711	295873	295694	295694	she	1581	" I tell you , he never thought of his daughter except as an instrument . Because I had wants outside his purpose , I was to be put in a frame and tortured . If that is the right law for the world , I will not say that I love it . If my acts were wrong if it is God who is exacting from me that I should deliver up what I withheld who is punishing me because I deceived my father and did not warn him that I should contradict his trust well , I have told everything . I have done what I could . And your soul consents . That is enough . I have after all been the instrument my father wanted . ' I desire a grandson who shall have a true Jewish heart . Every Jew should rear his family as if he hoped that a Deliverer might spring from it . ' "
295911	295919	295921	295921	Deronda	289	" Were those my grandfather 's words ? "
295923	295941	295943	295944	the Princess	6201	" Yes , yes ; and you will find them written . I wanted to thwart him , "
295967	295984	295962	295962	she	6201	" You would have me love what I have hated from the time I was so high "
295997	296048	295986	295986	she	6201	" That can never be . But what does it matter ? His yoke has been on me , whether I loved it or not . You are the grandson he wanted . You speak as men do as if you felt yourself wise . What does it all mean ? "
296097	296247	296089	296089	He	6462	" Mother , do n't say that I feel myself wise . We are set in the midst of difficulties . I see no other way to get any clearness than by being truthful not by keeping back facts which may which should carry obligation within them which should make the only guidance toward duty . No wonder if such facts come to reveal themselves in spite of concealments . The effects prepared by generations are likely to triumph over a contrivance which would bend them all to the satisfaction of self . Your will was strong , but my grandfather 's trust which you accepted and did not fulfill what you call his yoke is the expression of something stronger , with deeper , farther - spreading roots , knit into the foundations of sacredness for all men . You renounced me you still banish me as a son "
296259	296282	296256	296256	Deronda	289	" But that stronger Something has determined that I shall be all the more the grandson whom also you willed to annihilate . "
296311	296316	296302	296302	she	1581	" Sit down again , "
296336	296468	296326	296326	She	1581	" You rebuke me . Well I am the loser . And you are angry because I banish you . What could you do for me but weary your own patience ? Your mother is a shattered woman . My sense of life is little more than a sense of what was except when the pain is present . You reproach me that I parted with you . I had joy enough without you then . Now you are come back to me , and I can not make you a joy . Have you the cursing spirit of the Jew in you ? Are you not able to forgive me ? Shall you be glad to think that I am punished because I was not a Jewish mother to you ? "
296469	296477	296479	296479	Deronda	289	" How can you ask me that ? "
296483	296530	296479	296479	Deronda	289	" Have I not besought you that I might now at least be a son to you ? My grief is that you have declared me helpless to comfort you . I would give up much that is dear for the sake of soothing your anguish . "
296531	296538	296540	296541	his mother	1581	" You shall give up nothing , "
296549	296704	296540	296541	his mother	1581	" You shall be happy . You shall let me think of you as happy . I shall have done you no harm . You have no reason to curse me . You shall feel for me as they feel for the dead whom they say prayers for you shall long that I may be freed from all suffering from all punishment . And I shall see you instead of always seeing your grandfather . Will any harm come to me because I broke his trust in the daylight after he was gone into darkness ? I can not tell : if you think Kaddish will help me say it , say it . You will come between me and the dead . When I am in your mind , you will look as you do now always as if you were a tender son always as if I had been a tender mother . "
296817	296822	296823	296823	she	6468	" Is she beautiful ? "
296828	296831	296833	296833	Deronda	289	" Who ? "
296838	296844	296833	296833	Deronda	289	" The woman you love . "
296860	296863	296854	296854	He	6469	" Yes . "
296864	296868	296913	296914	the Princess	6201	" Not ambitious ? "
296869	296876	296854	296854	He	6469	" No , I think not . "
296877	296889	296913	296914	the Princess	6201	" Not one who must have a path of her own ? "
296890	296903	296854	296854	He	6469	" I think her nature is not given to make great claims . "
296904	296911	296913	296914	the Princess	6201	" She is not like that ? "
296958	297017	296955	296955	she	6201	" Had I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother ? The voice and the genius matched the face . Whatever else was wrong , acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist , though my father 's will was against it . My nature gave me a charter . "
297018	297024	297026	297026	Deronda	289	" I do acknowledge that , "
297056	297063	297065	297066	the Princess	6201	" Will you take the portrait ? "
297071	297087	297065	297066	the Princess	6201	" If she is a kind woman , teach her to think of me kindly . "
297088	297097	297099	297099	Deronda	289	" I shall be grateful for the portrait , "
297101	297129	297099	297099	Deronda	289	" but I ought to say , I have no assurance that she whom I love will have any love for me . I have kept silence . "
297130	297137	297139	297140	the mother	1566	" Who and what is she ? "
297148	297160	297162	297162	Deronda	289	" She was brought up as a singer for the stage , "
297168	297231	297162	297162	Deronda	289	" Her father took her away early from her mother , and her life has been unhappy . She is very young only twenty . Her father wished to bring her up in disregard even in dislike of her Jewish origin , but she has clung with all her affection to the memory of her mother and the fellowship of her people . "
297232	297249	297251	297252	the Princess	6201	" Ah , like you . She is attached to the Judaism she knows nothing of , "
297256	297282	297251	297252	the Princess	6201	" That is poetry fit to last through an opera night . Is she fond of her artist 's life is her singing worth anything ? "
297283	297313	297139	297140	the mother	1566	" Her singing is exquisite . But her voice is not suited to the stage . I think that the artist 's life has been made repugnant to her . "
297314	297357	297251	297252	the Princess	6201	" Why , she is made for you then . Sir Hugo said you were bitterly against being a singer , and I can see that you would never have let yourself be merged in a wife , as your father was . "
297358	297362	297364	297364	Deronda	289	" I repeat , "
297367	297449	297364	297364	Deronda	289	" I repeat that I have no assurance of her love for me , of the possibility that we can ever be united . Other things painful issues may lie before me . I have always felt that I should prepare myself to renounce , not cherish that prospect . But I suppose I might feel so of happiness in general . Whether it may come or not , one should try and prepare one 's self to do without it . "
297450	297458	297464	297464	her	1581	" Do you feel in that way ? "
297489	297548	297476	297476	she	1581	" Poor boy ! I wonder how it would have been if I had kept you with me whether you would have turned your heart to the old things against mine and we should have quarreled your grandfather would have been in you and you would have hampered my life with your young growth from the old root . "
297549	297562	297564	297564	Deronda	289	" I think my affection might have lasted through all our quarreling , "
297571	297586	297564	297564	Deronda	289	" and that would not have hampered surely it would have enriched your life . "
297587	297608	297610	297611	the mother	1566	" Not then , not then I did not want it then I might have been glad of it now , "
297618	297628	297610	297611	the mother	1566	" if I could have been glad of anything . "
297629	297642	297644	297644	Deronda	289	" But you love your other children , and they love you ? "
297648	297653	297654	297654	she	1566	" Oh , yes , "
297674	297677	297678	297678	she	1566	" But , "
297685	297746	297747	297747	she	1566	" I am not a loving woman . That is the truth . It is a talent to love I lack it . Others have loved me and I have acted their love . I know very well what love makes of men and women it is subjection . It takes another for a larger self , enclosing this one , "
297754	297771	297747	297747	she	1566	" I was never willingly subject to any man . Men have been subject to me . "
297772	297786	297788	297788	Deronda	289	" Perhaps the man who was subject was the happier of the two , "
297807	297881	297886	297886	she	1566	" Perhaps but I was happy for a few years I was happy . If I had not been afraid of defeat and failure , I might have gone on . I miscalculated . What then ? It is all over . Another life ! Men talk of ' another life , ' as if it only began on the other side of the grave . I have long entered on another life . "
297983	298007	297969	297969	her	1581	" Good - bye , my son , good - bye . We shall hear no more of each other . Kiss me . "

299818	299840	299813	299813	his	343	" There 's a plantation of sugar - canes at the foot of that rock ; should you like to look ? "
299844	299849	299841	299841	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , please , "
300950	300993	300939	300939	Deronda	289	" Turn your fear into a safeguard . Keep your dread fixed on the idea of increasing your remorse . Take your fear as a safeguard . It is like quickness of hearing . It may make consequences passionately present to you . "
301180	301193	301159	301159	she	289	" I will not mind if I can keep from getting wicked , "
301261	301270	301271	301271	she	289	" How long are we to be yachting ? "
301337	301344	301346	301346	Grandcourt	485	" What else should we do ? "
301348	301411	301346	301346	Grandcourt	485	" I 'm not tired of it . I do n't see why we should n't stay out any length of time . There 's less to bore one in this way . And where would you go to ? I 'm sick of foreign places . And we shall have enough of Ryelands . Would you rather be at Ryeland 's ? "
301412	301417	301419	301419	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , no , "
301440	301451	301431	301431	she	289	" I only wondered how long you would like this . "
301452	301461	301463	301463	Grandcourt	485	" I like yachting longer than anything else , "
301465	301498	301463	301463	Grandcourt	485	" and I had none last year . I suppose you are beginning to tire of it . Women are so confoundedly whimsical . They expect everything to give way to them . "
301499	301506	301508	301508	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , dear , no ! "
301521	301530	301512	301512	her	289	" I never expect you to give way . "
301531	301536	301538	301538	Grandcourt	485	" Why should I ? "
301603	301635	301596	301596	he	1088	" There 's been the devil 's own work in the night . The skipper says we shall have to stay at Genoa for a week while things are set right . "
301636	301642	301644	301644	Gwendolen	289	" Do you mind that ? "
301656	301670	301596	301596	he	1088	" I should think so . Who wants to be broiling at Genoa ? "
301671	301678	301680	301680	Gwendolen	289	" It will be a change , "
301690	301752	301596	301596	he	1088	" I do n't want any change . Besides , the place is intolerable ; and one ca n't move along the roads . I shall go out in a boat , as I used to do , and manage it myself . One can get a few hours every day in that way instead of striving in a damnable hotel . "
301812	301815	301797	301797	she	289	" running away "
302831	302850	302852	302852	Grandcourt	485	" A just ring , please , and tell Gibbs to order some dinner for us at three , "
302876	302925	302867	302867	his	6619	" I 'm going to send Angus to find a little sailing - boat for us to go out in ; one that I can manage , with you at the tiller . It 's uncommonly pleasant these fine evenings the least boring of anything we can do . "
303028	303038	303039	303039	she	289	" I would rather not go in the boat , "
303042	303050	303039	303039	she	289	" Take some one else with you . "
303051	303066	303068	303068	Grandcourt	485	" Very well ; if you do n't go , I shall not go , "
303070	303081	303068	303068	Grandcourt	485	" We shall stay suffocating here , that 's all . "
303082	303093	303095	303095	Gwendolen	289	" I ca n't bear to go in a boat , "
303099	303106	303108	303108	Grandcourt	485	" That is a sudden change , "
303115	303127	303108	303108	Grandcourt	485	" But , since you decline , we shall stay indoors . "
303291	303318	303288	303288	his	6624	" Have you come round yet ? or do you find it agreeable to be out of temper . You make things uncommonly pleasant for me . "
303319	303331	303333	303333	Gwendolen	289	" Why do you want to make them unpleasant for me ? "
303346	303365	303367	303367	Grandcourt	485	" Now , will you be good enough to say what it is you have to complain of ? "
303381	303392	303376	303376	his	6624	" Is it that I stay indoors when you stay ? "
303450	303457	303459	303459	Grandcourt	485	" I hope this is useful , "
303467	303532	303459	303459	Grandcourt	485	" All I can say is , it 's most confoundedly unpleasant . What the devil women can see in this kind of thing , I do n't know . You see something to be got by it , of course . All I can see is , that we shall be shut up here when we might have been having a pleasant sail . "
303533	303540	303542	303542	Gwendolen	289	" Let us go , then , "
303546	303553	303542	303542	Gwendolen	289	" Perhaps we shall be drowned . "
303599	303609	303580	303580	He	1088	" Just be quiet and listen , will you ? "
303640	303647	303649	303649	Grandcourt	485	" Let us understand each other , "
303656	303744	303649	303649	Grandcourt	485	" I know very well what this nonsense means . But if you suppose I am going to let you make a fool of me , just dismiss that notion from your mind . What are you looking forward to , if you ca n't behave properly as my wife ? There is disgrace for you , if you like to have it , but I do n't know anything else ; and as to Deronda , it 's quite clear that he hangs back from you . "
303745	303751	303753	303753	Gwendolen	289	" It 's all false ! "
303757	303807	303753	303753	Gwendolen	289	" You do n't in the least imagine what is in my mind . I have seen enough of the disgrace that comes in that way . And you had better leave me at liberty to speak with any one I like . It will be better for you . "
303808	303818	303820	303820	Grandcourt	485	" You will allow me to judge of that , "
303984	303992	303993	303993	he	6629	" What decision have you come to ? "
304001	304008	303993	303993	he	6629	" What orders shall I give ? "
304009	304016	304018	304018	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , let us go , "
304719	304724	304707	304707	her	289	" God help me ! "
304725	304731	304733	304733	Grandcourt	485	" What is the matter ? "
304740	304745	304747	304747	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , nothing , "
304760	304768	304770	304770	Grandcourt	485	" Do n't you find this pleasant ? "
304772	304775	304814	304814	Grandcourt	485	" Very . "
304776	304788	304814	304814	Grandcourt	485	" You admit now we could n't have done anything better ? "
304789	304809	304811	304811	Gwendolen	289	" No I see nothing better . I think we shall go on always , like the Flying Dutchman , "
304828	304850	304814	304814	Grandcourt	485	" If you like , we can go to Spezia in the morning , and let them take us up there . "
304851	304862	304814	304814	Grandcourt	485	" No ; I shall like nothing better than this . "
304863	304889	304814	304814	Grandcourt	485	" Very well : we 'll do the same to - morrow . But we must be turning in soon . I shall put about . "

305390	305434	305384	305384	Deronda	289	" I will stay over to - night , because it is Friday , and I should like to go to the evening service at the synagogue where they must all have gone ; and besides , I may see the Grandcourts again . "
306407	306420	306385	306385	she	289	" It is come , it is come ! He is dead ! "
306421	306426	306428	306428	Deronda	289	" Hush , hush ! "
306436	306440	306428	306428	Deronda	289	" quiet yourself . "
306450	306481	306428	306428	Deronda	289	" I am a connection of this lady 's husband . If you will get her on to the Italia as quickly as possible , I will undertake everything else . "

307483	307491	307492	307492	she	289	" Will you sit down near me ? "
307495	307503	307492	307492	she	289	" I want to speak very low . "

307657	307660	307650	307650	she	289	" No . "
307661	307681	307694	307694	she	289	" Not by any one else only by me a dead face I shall never get away from it . "
307863	307937	307854	307854	she	289	" You will not say that I ought to tell the world ? you will not say that I ought to be disgraced ? I could not do it . I could not bear it . I can not have my mother know . Not if I were dead . I could not have her know . I must tell you ; but you will not say that any one else should know . "
307938	307947	307949	307949	Deronda	289	" I can say nothing in my ignorance , "
307953	307962	307949	307949	Deronda	289	" except that I desire to help you . "
307963	307984	307854	307854	she	289	" I told you from the beginning as soon as I could I told you I was afraid of myself . "
308009	308088	308002	308002	Her	6750	" I felt a hatred in me that was always working like an evil spirit contriving things . Everything I could do to free myself came into my mind ; and it got worse all things got worse . That is why I asked you to come to me in town . I thought then I would tell you the worst about myself . I tried . But I could not tell everything . And he came in . "
308104	308136	308089	308089	She	6750	" I will tell you everything now . Do you think a woman who cried , and prayed , and struggled to be saved from herself , could be a murderess ? "
308137	308141	308143	308143	Deronda	289	" Great God ! "
308152	308196	308143	308143	Deronda	289	" do n't torture me needlessly . You have not murdered him . You threw yourself into the water with the impulse to save him . Tell me the rest afterward . This death was an accident that you could not have hindered . "
308197	308205	308089	308089	She	6750	" Do n't be impatient with me . "
308234	308392	308143	308143	Deronda	289	" You said you used to say you felt more for those who had done something wicked and were miserable ; you said they might get better they might be scourged into something better . If you had not spoken in that way , Everything would have been worse . I did remember all you said to me . It came to me always . It came to me at the very last that was the reason why I But now , if you can not bear with me when I tell you everything if you turn away from me and forsake me , what shall I do ? Am I worse than I was when you found me and wanted to make me better ? All the wrong I have done was in me then and more and more if you had not come and been patient with me . And now will you forsake me ? "
308474	308481	308441	308441	He	6753	" I will not forsake you . "
308637	308665	308630	308630	She	289	" All sorts of contrivances in my mind but all so difficult . And I fought against them I was terrified at them I saw his dead face "
308679	308749	308667	308667	her	289	" ever so long ago I saw it and I wished him to be dead . And yet it terrified me . I was like two creatures . I could not speak I wanted to kill it was as strong as thirst and then directly I felt beforehand I had done something dreadful , unalterable that would make me like an evil spirit . And it came it came . "
308776	309079	308750	308750	She	289	" It had all been in my mind when I first spoke to you when we were at the Abbey . I had done something then . I could not tell you that . It was the only thing I did toward carrying out my thoughts . They went about over everything ; but they all remained like dreadful dreams all but one . I did one act and I never undid it it is there still as long ago as when we were at Ryelands . There it was something my fingers longed for among the beautiful toys in the cabinet in my boudoir small and sharp like a long willow leaf in a silver sheath . I locked it in the drawer of my dressing - case . I was continually haunted with it and how I should use it . I fancied myself putting it under my pillow . But I never did . I never looked at it again . I dared not unlock the drawer : it had a key all to itself ; and not long ago , when we were in the yacht , I dropped the key into the deep water . It was my wish to drop it and deliver myself . After that I began to think how I could open the drawer without the key : and when I found we were to stay at Genoa , it came into my mind that I could get it opened privately at the hotel . But then , when we were going up the stairs , I met you ; and I thought I should talk to you alone and tell you this everything I could not tell you in town ; and then I was forced to go out in the boat . "
309130	309159	309126	309126	he	6759	" And it has all remained in your imagination . It has gone on only in your thought . To the last the evil temptation has been resisted ? "
309204	309537	309199	309199	she	6758	" No , no ; I will tell you everything as God knows it . I will tell you no falsehood ; I will tell you the exact truth . What should I do else ? I used to think I could never be wicked . I thought of wicked people as if they were a long way off me . Since then I have been wicked . I have felt wicked . And everything has been a punishment to me all the things I used to wish for it is as if they had been made red - hot . The very daylight has often been a punishment to me . Because you know I ought not to have married . That was the beginning of it . I wronged some one else . I broke my promise . I meant to get pleasure for myself , and it all turned to misery . I wanted to make my gain out of another 's loss you remember ? it was like roulette and the money burned into me . And I could not complain . It was as if I had prayed that another should lose and I should win . And I had won , I knew it all I knew I was guilty . When we were on the sea , and I lay awake at night in the cabin , I sometimes felt that everything I had done lay open without excuse nothing was hidden how could anything be known to me only ? it was not my own knowledge , it was God 's that had entered into me , and even the stillness everything held a punishment for me everything but you . I always thought that you would not want me to be punished you would have tried and helped me to be better . And only thinking of that helped me . You will not change you will not want to punish me now ? "
309544	309548	309550	309550	Deronda	289	" God forbid ! "
309629	309825	309832	309832	she	6762	" That all made it so hard when I was forced to go in the boat . Because when I saw you it was an unexpected joy , and I thought I could tell you everything about the locked - up drawer and what I had not told you before . And if I had told you , and knew it was in your mind , it would have less power over me . I hoped and trusted in that . For after all my struggles and my crying , the hatred and rage , the temptation that frightened me , the longing , the thirst for what I dreaded , always came back . And that disappointment when I was quite shut out from speaking to you , and was driven to go in the boat brought all the evil back , as if I had been locked in a prison with it and no escape . Oh , it seems so long ago now since I stepped into that boat ! I could have given up everything in that moment , to have the forked lightning for a weapon to strike him dead . "
309855	309958	309849	309849	she	6762	" If he were here again , what should I do ? I can not wish him here and yet I can not bear his dead face . I was a coward . I ought to have borne contempt . I ought to have gone away gone and wandered like a beggar rather than to stay to feel like a fiend . But turn where I would there was something I could not bear . Sometimes I thought he would kill me if I resisted his will . But now his dead face is there , and I can not bear it . "
309985	310027	309965	309965	she	289	" I have been a cruel woman ! What can I do but cry for help ? I am sinking . Die die you are forsaken go down , go down into darkness . Forsaken no pity I shall be forsaken . "
310310	310319	310306	310306	she	289	" You know I am a guilty woman , "
310332	310346	310347	310347	He	6763	" I know it , but I shall all the less forsake you . "
310413	310420	310404	310404	she	289	" I make you very unhappy . "
310425	310428	310404	310404	she	289	" Oh , "
310449	310485	310440	310440	he	6763	" There is no question of being happy or unhappy . What I most desire at this moment is what will most help you . Tell me all you feel it a relief to tell . "
310589	310609	310585	310585	Deronda	289	" Perhaps you are too weary . Shall I go away , and come again whenever you wish it ? "
310610	310615	310617	310617	Gwendolen	289	" No , no , "
310641	310932	310631	310631	She	289	" I want to tell you what it was that came over me in that boat . I was full of rage at being obliged to go full of rage and I could do nothing but sit there like a galley slave . And then we got away out of the port into the deep and everything was still and we never looked at each other , only he spoke to order me and the very light about me seemed to hold me a prisoner and force me to sit as I did . It came over me that when I was a child I used to fancy sailing away into a world where people were not forced to live with any one they did not like I did not like my father - in - law to come home . And now , I thought , just the opposite had come to me . I had stepped into a boat , and my life was a sailing and sailing away gliding on and no help always into solitude with him , away from deliverance . And because I felt more helpless than ever , my thoughts went out over worse things I longed for worse things I had cruel wishes I fancied impossible ways of I did not want to die myself ; I was afraid of our being drowned together . If it had been any use I should have prayed I should have prayed that something might befall him . I should have prayed that he might sink out of my sight and leave me alone . I knew no way of killing him there , but I did , I did kill him in my thoughts . "
310953	311144	310631	310631	She	289	" But yet , all the while I felt that I was getting more wicked . And what had been with me so much , came to me just then what you once said about dreading to increase my wrong - doing and my remorse I should hope for nothing then . It was all like a writing of fire within me . Getting wicked was misery being shut out forever from knowing what you what better lives were . That had always been coming back to me then but yet with a despair a feeling that it was no use evil wishes were too strong . I remember then letting go the tiller and saying ' God help me ! ' But then I was forced to take it again and go on ; and the evil longings , the evil prayers came again and blotted everything else dim , till , in the midst of them I do n't know how it was he was turning the sail there was a gust he was struck I know nothing I only know that I saw my wish outside me . "
311159	311439	311145	311145	She	6770	" I saw him sink , and my heart gave a leap as if it were going out of me . I think I did not move . I kept my hands tight . It was long enough for me to be glad , and yet to think it was no use he would come up again . And he was come farther off the boat had moved . It was all like lightning . ' The rope ! ' he called out in a voice not his own I hear it now and I stooped for the rope I felt I must I felt sure he could swim , and he would come back whether or not , and I dreaded him . That was in my mind he would come back . But he was gone down again , and I had the rope in my hand no , there he was again his face above the water and he cried again and I held my hand , and my heart said , ' Die ! ' and he sank ; and I felt ' It is done I am wicked , I am lost ! and I had the rope in my hand I do n't know what I thought I was leaping away from myself I would have saved him then . I was leaping from my crime , and there it was close to me as I fell there was the dead face dead , dead . It can never be altered . That was what happened . That was what I did . You know it all . It can never be altered . "
311472	311474	311440	311440	She	6771	" guilty "
311764	311779	311758	311758	he	6772	" It can never be altered it remains unaltered , to alter other things . "
311857	311896	311844	311844	she	289	" You must rest now . Try to rest : try to sleep . And may I see you again this evening to - morrow when you have had some rest ? Let us say no more now . "
311941	311971	311972	311973	MARCUS AURELIUS	736	" The unripe grape , the ripe , and the dried . All things are changes , not into nothing , but into that which is not at present . "
312118	312125	312112	312112	her	289	" How long ago it is ! "
312128	312139	312107	312107	She	289	" Will you sit near me again a little while ? "
312229	312241	312226	312226	her	289	" You will not say that any one else should know ? "
312242	312247	312249	312249	Deronda	289	" Most decidedly not , "
312251	312287	312249	312249	Deronda	289	" There is no action that ought to be taken in consequence . There is no injury that could be righted in that way . There is no retribution that any mortal could apportion justly . "
312306	312334	312304	312304	she	289	" But if I had not had that murderous will that moment if I had thrown the rope on the instant perhaps it would have hindered death ? "
312335	312341	312343	312343	Deronda	289	" No I think not , "
312347	312460	312343	312343	Deronda	289	" If it were true that he could swim , he must have been seized with cramp . With your quickest , utmost effort , it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save him . That momentary murderous will can not , I think , have altered the course of events . Its effect is confined to the motives in your own breast . Within ourselves our evil will is momentous , and sooner or later it works its way outside us it may be in the vitiation that breeds evil acts , but also it may be in the self - abhorrence that stings us into better striving . "
312461	312506	312507	312507	She	6777	" I am saved from robbing others there are others they will have everything they will have what they ought to have . I knew that some time before I left town . You do not suspect me of wrong desires about those things ? "
312511	312519	312521	312521	Deronda	289	" I had not thought of them , "
312523	312534	312521	312521	Deronda	289	" I was thinking too much of the other things . "
312535	312548	312556	312556	she	6777	" Perhaps you do n't quite know the beginning of it all , "
312562	312769	312556	312556	she	6777	" There was some one else he ought to have married . And I knew it , and I told her I would not hinder it . And I went away that was when you first saw me . But then we became poor all at once , and I was very miserable , and I was tempted . I thought , ' I shall do as I like and make everything right . ' I persuaded myself . And it was all different . It was all dreadful . Then came hatred and wicked thoughts . That was how it all came . I told you I was afraid of myself . And I did what you told me I did try to make my fear a safeguard . I thought of what would be if I I felt what would come how I should dread the morning wishing it would be always night and yet in the darkness always seeing something seeing death . If you did not know how miserable I was , you might but now it has all been no use . I can care for nothing but saving the rest from knowing poor mamma , who has never been happy . "
312781	312821	312775	312775	she	6778	" You can not bear to look at me any more . You think I am too wicked . You do not believe that I can become any better worth anything worthy enough I shall always be too wicked to "
312846	312907	312834	312834	He	6779	" I believe that you may become worthier than you have ever yet been worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing . No evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love , and desire to continue in , and make no effort to escape from . You have made efforts you will go on making them . "
312908	312923	312925	312925	Gwendolen	289	" But you were the beginning of them . You must not forsake me , "
312979	313034	312944	312944	her	289	" I will bear any penance . I will lead any life you tell me . But you must not forsake me . You must be near . If you had been near me if I could have said everything to you , I should have been different . You will not forsake me ? "
313035	313046	313048	313048	Deronda	289	" It could never be my impulse to forsake you , "
313190	313242	313188	313188	he	6779	" I expect Sir Hugh Mallinger to arrive by to - morrow night at least ; and I am not without hope that Mrs. Davilow may shortly follow him . Her presence will be the greatest comfort to you it will give you a motive to save her from unnecessary pain ? "
313243	313258	313188	313188	he	6779	" Yes , yes I will try . And you will not go away ? "
313259	313268	313188	313188	he	6779	" Not till after Sir Hugo has come . "
313269	313278	313188	313188	he	6779	" But we shall all go to England ? "
313279	313285	313287	313287	Deronda	289	" As soon as possible , "
313346	313356	313357	313357	she	289	" You will always be with Sir Hugo now ! "
313365	313378	313357	313357	she	289	" You will always live at the Abbey or else at Diplow ? "
313379	313389	313391	313391	Deronda	289	" I am quite uncertain where I shall live , "
313423	313453	313417	313417	she	289	" It is impossible to think how my life will go on . I think now it would be better for me to be poor and obliged to work . "
313454	313478	313480	313480	Deronda	289	" New promptings will come as the days pass . When you are among your friends again , you will discern new duties , "
313482	313503	313504	313504	He	6783	" Make it a task now to get as well and calm as much like yourself as you can , before "
313507	313513	313515	313515	Gwendolen	289	" Before my mother comes , "
313517	313538	313539	313539	she	289	" Ah ! I must be changed . I have not looked at myself . Should you have known me , "
313546	313567	313539	313539	she	289	" if you had met me now ? should you have known me for the one you saw at Leubronn ? "
313568	313577	313579	313579	Deronda	289	" Yes , I should have known you , "
313583	313612	313579	313579	Deronda	289	" The outside change is not great . I should have seen at once that it was you , and that you had gone through some great sorrow . "
313613	313630	313632	313632	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't wish now that you had never seen me ; do n't wish that , "
313641	313650	313652	313652	Deronda	289	" I should despise myself for wishing it , "
313654	313717	313652	313652	Deronda	289	" How could I know what I was wishing ? We must find our duties in what comes to us , not in what we imagine might have been . If I took to foolish wishing of that sort , I should wish not that I had never seen you , but that I had been able to save you from this . "
313718	313726	313728	313728	Gwendolen	289	" You have saved me from worse , "
313735	313766	313728	313728	Gwendolen	289	" I should have been worse if it had not been for you . If you had not been good , I should have been more wicked than I am . "
313767	313778	313780	313780	Deronda	289	" It will be better for me to go now , "
313793	313811	313780	313780	Deronda	289	" Remember what we said of your task to get well and calm before other friends come . "
313906	313923	313924	313925	NICHOLAS BRETON	740	" Much adoe there was , God wot ; He wold love and she wold not . "
314698	314714	314716	314717	his father	7898	" You do n't repent the choice of the law as a profession , Rex ? "
314719	314730	314732	314732	Rex	599	" There is no profession I would choose before it , "
314734	314787	314732	314732	Rex	599	" I should like to end my life as a first - rate judge , and help to draw up a code . I reverse the famous dictum . I should say , ' Give me something to do with making the laws , and let who will make the songs . ' "
314788	314810	314812	314813	the rector	1395	" You will have to stow in an immense amount of rubbish , I suppose that 's the worst of it , "
314815	314951	314812	314813	the rector	1395	" I do n't see that law - rubbish is worse than any other sort . It is not so bad as the rubbishy literature that people choke their minds with . It does n't make one so dull . Our wittiest men have often been lawyers . Any orderly way of looking at things as cases and evidence seems to me better than a perpetual wash of odds and ends bearing on nothing in particular . And then , from a higher point of view , the foundations and the growth of law make the most interesting aspects of philosophy and history . Of course there will be a good deal that is troublesome , drudging , perhaps exasperating . But the great prizes in life ca n't be won easily I see that . "
314952	315045	314812	314813	the rector	1395	" Well , my boy , the best augury of a man 's success in his profession is that he thinks it the finest in the world . But I fancy it so with most work when a man goes into it with a will . Brewitt , the blacksmith , said to me the other day that his ' prentice had no mind to his trade ; ' and yet , sir , ' said Brewitt , ' what would a young fellow have if he does n't like the blacksmithing ? "
315128	315154	315123	315123	he	1395	" Rex will be a distinguished man , Nancy , I am sure of it as sure as Paley 's father was about his son . "
315155	315162	315164	315165	Mrs. Gascoigne	230	" Was Paley an old bachelor ? "
315167	315178	315180	315189	the rector , who did not remember that irrelevant detail	6824	" That is hardly to the point , my dear , "
315245	315249	315250	315251	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Jodson 's . "

316100	316119	316098	316098	he	599	" Can I do anything , aunt ? Can I carry any word to my father from you ? "
316120	316234	316098	316098	he	599	" Yes , dear . Tell him I will be ready he is very good . He says he will go with me to Genoa he will be here at half - past six . Jocosa and Alice , help me to get ready . She is safe Gwendolen is safe but she must be ill . I am sure she must be very ill . Rex , dear Rex and Anna go and and tell your father I will be quite ready . I would not for the world lose another night . And bless him for being ready so soon . I can travel night and day till we get there . "
316301	316338	316299	316299	he	599	" Nannie , I will leave you to say everything to my father . If he wants me immediately , let me know . I shall stay in the shrubbery for ten minutes only ten minutes . "
316483	316486	316452	316452	Gwendolen	289	" Gwendolen free "
316492	316500	316452	316452	Gwendolen	289	" Gwendolen rich , exalted , courted ; "
317244	317403	317237	317237	He	599	" She would never love me ; and that is not the question I could never approach her as a lover in her present position . I am exactly of no consequence at all , and am not likely to be of much consequence till my head is turning gray . But what has that to do with it ? She would not have me on any terms , and I would not ask her . It is a meanness to be thinking about it now no better than lurking about the battle - field to strip the dead ; but there never was more gratuitous sinning . I have nothing to gain there absolutely nothing . Then why ca n't I face the facts , and behave as they demand , instead of leaving my father to suppose that there are matters he ca n't speak to me about , though I might be useful in them ? "
317441	317451	317453	317453	Rex	599	" Can I be of any use , sir ? "
317467	317533	317460	317461	his father	7898	" Yes , my boy ; when I 'm gone , just see to my letters , and answer where necessary , and send me word of everything . Dymock will manage the parish very well , and you will stay with your mother , or , at least , go up and down again , till I come back , whenever that may be . "
317534	317547	317549	317549	Rex	599	" You will hardly be very long , sir , I suppose , "
317558	317569	317570	317570	He	599	" You will perhaps bring my cousin back to England ? "
317591	317595	317596	317596	he	599	" That depends , "
317612	317686	317596	317596	he	599	" Perhaps her mother may stay there with her , and I may come back very soon . This telegram leaves us in ignorance which is rather anxious . But no doubt the arrangements of the will lately made are satisfactory , and there may possibly be an heir yet to be born . In any case , I feel confident that Gwendolen will be liberally I should expect , splendidly provided for . "
317687	317698	317700	317700	Rex	599	" It must have been a great shock for her , "
317713	317722	317700	317700	Rex	599	" I suppose he was a devoted husband . "
317723	317729	317731	317732	the rector	1395	" No doubt of it , "
317740	317757	317731	317732	the rector	1395	" Few men of his position would have come forward as he did under the circumstances . "
317897	317915	317916	317916	SHAKESPEARE	347	" I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul remembering my good friends . "
318694	318699	318701	318702	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , Dan , "
318765	318779	318780	318780	he	209	" I have taken my journey easily , and am in excellent condition , "
318804	318846	318780	318780	he	209	" I did n't hurry in setting off , because I wanted to inquire into things a little , and so I got sight of your letter to Lady Mallinger before I started . But now , how is the widow ? "
318847	318851	318853	318853	Deronda	197	" Getting calmer , "
318855	318897	318853	318853	Deronda	197	" She seems to be escaping the bodily illness that one might have feared for her , after her plunge and terrible excitement . Her uncle and mother came two days ago , and she is being well taken care of . "
318898	318907	318780	318780	he	209	" Any prospect of an heir being born ? "
318908	318940	318853	318853	Deronda	197	" From what Mr. Gascoigne said to me , I conclude not . He spoke as if it were a question whether the widow would have the estates for her life . "
318941	318963	318965	318966	Sir Hugo	209	" It will not be much of a wrench to her affections , I fancy , this loss of the husband ? "
318973	318987	318989	318989	Deronda	197	" The suddenness of the death has been a great blow to her , "
318996	319013	319015	319016	Sir Hugo	209	" I wonder whether Grandcourt gave her any notion what were the provisions of his will ? "
319018	319028	319030	319030	Deronda	197	" Do you know what they are , sir ? "
319032	319038	319040	319041	the baronet	7684	" Yes , I do , "
319045	319289	319040	319041	the baronet	7684	" Gad ! if there is no prospect of a legitimate heir , he has left everything to a boy he had by a Mrs. Glasher ; you know nothing about the affair , I suppose , but she was a sort of wife to him for a good many years , and there are three older children girls . The boy is to take his father 's name ; he is Henleigh already , and he is to be Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt . The Mallinger will be of no use to him , I am happy to say ; but the young dog will have more than enough with his fourteen years ' minority no need to have had holes filled up with my fifty thousand for Diplow that he had no right to : and meanwhile my beauty , the young widow , is to put up with a poor two thousand a year and the house at Gadsmere a nice kind of banishment for her if she chose to shut herself up there , which I do n't think she will . The boy 's mother has been living there of late years . I 'm perfectly disgusted with Grandcourt . I do n't know that I 'm obliged to think the better of him because he 's drowned , though , so far as my affairs are concerned , nothing in his life became him like the leaving it . "
319290	319311	319313	319313	Deronda	197	" In my opinion he did wrong when he married this wife not in leaving his estates to the son , "
319318	319331	319333	319334	Sir Hugo	209	" I say nothing against his leaving the land to the lad , "
319336	319512	319333	319334	Sir Hugo	209	" but since he had married this girl he ought to have given her a handsome provision , such as she could live on in a style fitted to the rank he had raised her to . She ought to have had four or five thousand a year and the London house for her life ; that 's what I should have done for her . I suppose , as she was penniless , her friends could n't stand out for a settlement , else it 's ill trusting to the will a man may make after he 's married . Even a wise man generally lets some folly ooze out of him in his will my father did , I know ; and if a fellow has any spite or tyranny in him , he 's likely to bottle off a good deal for keeping in that sort of document . It 's quite clear Grandcourt meant that his death should put an extinguisher on his wife , if she bore him no heir . "
319513	319535	319537	319537	Deronda	197	" And , in the other case , I suppose everything would have been reversed illegitimacy would have had the extinguisher ? "
319543	319658	319659	319660	Sir Hugo	209	" Precisely Gadsmere and the two thousand . It 's queer . One nuisance is that Grandcourt has made me an executor ; but seeing he was the son of my only brother , I ca n't refuse to act . And I shall mind it less if I can be of any use to the widow . Lush thinks she was not in ignorance about the family under the rose , and the purport of the will . He hints that there was no very good understanding between the couple . But I fancy you are the man who knew most about what Mrs. Grandcourt felt or did not feel eh , Dan ? "
319694	319736	319691	319691	He	209	" She was certainly not happy . They were unsuited to each other . But as to the disposal of the property from all I have seen of her , I should predict that she will be quite contented with it . "
319737	319757	319759	319760	Sir Hugo	209	" Then she is not much like the rest of her sex ; that 's all I can say , "
319767	319927	319759	319760	Sir Hugo	209	" However , she ought to be something extraordinary , for there must be an entanglement between your horoscope and hers eh ? When that tremendous telegram came , the first thing Lady Mallinger said was , ' How very strange that it should be Daniel who sends it ! ' But I have had something of the same sort in my own life . I was once at a foreign hotel where a lady had been left by her husband without money . When I heard of it , and came forward to help her , who should she be but an early flame of mine , who had been fool enough to marry an Austrian baron with a long mustache and short affection ? But it was an affair of my own that called me there nothing to do with knight - errantry , any more than you coming to Genoa had to do with the Grandcourts . "
320054	320112	320032	320033	the baronet	7684	" And about the main business of your coming to Genoa , Dan ? You have not been deeply pained by anything you have learned , I hope ? There is nothing that you feel need change your position in any way ? You know , whatever happens to you must always be of importance to me . "
320113	320126	320128	320128	Deronda	197	" I desire to meet your goodness by perfect confidence , sir , "
320130	320272	320128	320128	Deronda	197	" But I ca n't answer those questions truly by a simple yes or no . Much that I have heard about the past has pained me . And it has been a pain to meet and part with my mother in her suffering state , as I have been compelled to do , But it is no pain it is rather a clearing up of doubts for which I am thankful , to know my parentage . As to the effect on my position , there will be no change in my gratitude to you , sir , for the fatherly care and affection you have always shown me . But to know that I was born a Jew , may have a momentous influence on my life , which I am hardly able to tell you of at present . "
320364	320591	320362	320362	he	7684	" I have long expected something remarkable from you , Dan ; but , for God 's sake , do n't go into any eccentricities ! I can tolerate any man 's difference of opinion , but let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic . At this stage of the world , if a man wants to be taken seriously , he must keep clear of melodrama . Do n't misunderstand me . I am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account . I only think you might easily be led arm in arm with a lunatic , especially if he wanted defending . You have a passion for people who are pelted , Dan . I 'm sorry for them too ; but so far as company goes , it 's a bad ground of selection . However , I do n't ask you to anticipate your inclination in anything you have to tell me . When you make up your mind to a course that requires money , I have some sixteen thousand pounds that have been accumulating for you over and above what you have been having the interest of as income . And now I am come , I suppose you want to get back to England as soon as you can ? "
320592	320618	320620	320620	Deronda	197	" I must go first to Mainz to get away a chest of my grandfather 's , and perhaps to see a friend of his , "
320622	320711	320620	320620	Deronda	197	" Although the chest has been lying there these twenty years , I have an unreasonable sort of nervous eagerness to get it away under my care , as if it were more likely now than before that something might happen to it . And perhaps I am the more uneasy , because I lingered after my mother left , instead of setting out immediately . Yet I ca n't regret that I was here else Mrs. Grandcourt would have had none but servants to act for her . "
320712	320717	320719	320720	Sir Hugo	209	" Yes , yes , "
320739	320756	320719	320720	Sir Hugo	209	" I hope you are not going to set a dead Jew above a living Christian . "
320776	320826	320827	320828	JEREMY TAYLOR	691	" But I shall say no more of this at this time ; for this is to be felt and not to be talked of ; and they who never touched it with their fingers may secretly perhaps laugh at it in their hearts and be never the wiser . "
321064	321078	321060	321060	he	197	" Good ! It is now you who seek me , young man . "
321079	321096	321098	321098	Deronda	197	" Yes ; I seek you with gratitude , as a friend of my grandfather 's , "
321100	321118	321098	321098	Deronda	197	" and I am under an obligation to you for giving yourself much trouble on my account . "
321148	321163	321142	321142	his	706	" So you are no longer angry at being something more than an Englishman ? "
321164	321202	321248	321248	he	706	" On the contrary . I thank you heartily for helping to save me from remaining in ignorance of my parentage , and for taking care of the chest that my grandfather left in trust for me . "
321203	321210	321220	321220	himself	706	" Sit down , sit down , "
321320	321340	321341	321341	he	706	" contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul whose progeny they are , "
321479	321500	321462	321462	He	706	" As thy goodness has been great to the former generations , even so may it be to the latter . "
321509	321623	321506	321506	he	706	" Young man , I rejoice that I was not yet set off again on my travels , and that you are come in time for me to see the image of my friend as he was in his youth no longer perverted from the fellowship of your people no longer shrinking in proud wrath from the touch of him who seemed to be claiming you as a Jew . You come with thankfulness yourself to claim the kindred and heritage that wicked contrivance would have robbed you of . You come with a willing soul to declare , ' I am the grandson of Daniel Charisi . ' Is it not so ? "
321624	321629	321631	321631	Deronda	197	" Assuredly it is , "
321633	321681	321631	321631	Deronda	197	" But let me say that I should at no time have been inclined to treat a Jew with incivility simply because he was a Jew . You can understand that I shrank from saying to a stranger , ' I know nothing of my mother . ' "
321682	321689	321691	321691	Kalonymos	706	" A sin , a sin ! "
321704	321926	321691	321691	Kalonymos	706	" A robbery of our people as when our youths and maidens were reared for the Roman Edom . But it is frustrated . I have frustrated it . When Daniel Charisi may his Rock and his Redeemer guard him ! when Daniel Charisi was a stripling and I was a lad little above his shoulder , we made a solemn vow always to be friends . He said , ' Let us bind ourselves with duty , as if we were sons of the same mother . ' That was his bent from first to last as he said , to fortify his soul with bonds . It was a saying of his , ' Let us bind love with duty ; for duty is the love of law ; and law is the nature of the Eternal . ' So we bound ourselves . And though we were much apart in our later life , the bond has never been broken . When he was dead , they sought to rob him ; but they could not rob him of me . I rescued that remainder of him which he had prized and preserved for his offspring . And I have restored to him the offspring they had robbed him of . I will bring you the chest forthwith . "
321992	321995	322001	322001	his	706	" So ! "
322004	322012	322013	322013	he	706	" And here is the curious key , "
322024	322037	322038	322038	He	706	" Bestow it carefully . I trust you are methodic and wary . "
322062	322076	322078	322078	Deronda	197	" I shall be more careful of this than of any other property , "
322091	322143	322078	322078	Deronda	197	" I never before possessed anything that was a sign to me of so much cherished hope and effort . And I shall never forget that the effort was partly yours . Have you time to tell me more of my grandfather ? Or shall I be trespassing in staying longer ? "
322144	322161	322163	322163	Kalonymos	706	" Stay yet a while . In an hour and eighteen minutes I start for Trieste , "
322170	322222	322163	322163	Kalonymos	706	" and presently my sons will expect my attention . Will you let me make you known to them , so that they may have the pleasure of showing hospitality to my friend 's grandson ? They dwell here in ease and luxury , though I choose to be a wanderer . "
322223	322241	322243	322243	Deronda	197	" I shall be glad if you will commend me to their acquaintance for some future opportunity , "
322245	322298	322243	322243	Deronda	197	" There are pressing claims calling me to England friends who may be much in need of my presence . I have been kept away from them too long by unexpected circumstances . But to know more of you and your family would be motive enough to bring me again to Mainz . "
322299	322439	322163	322163	Kalonymos	706	" Good ! Me you will hardly find , for I am beyond my threescore years and ten , and I am a wanderer , carrying my shroud with me . But my sons and their children dwell here in wealth and unity . The days are changed for us since Karl the Great fetched my ancestors from Italy to bring some tincture of knowledge to our rough German brethren . I and my contemporaries have had to fight for it too . Our youth fell on evil days ; but this we have won ; we increase our wealth in safety , and the learning of all Germany is fed and fattened by Jewish brains though they keep not always their Jewish hearts . Have you been left altogether ignorant of your people 's life , young man ? "
322440	322443	322445	322445	Deronda	197	" No , "
322447	322496	322445	322445	Deronda	197	" I have lately , before I had any true suspicion of my parentage , been led to study everything belonging to their history with more interest than any other subject . It turns out that I have been making myself ready to understand my grandfather a little . "
322597	322726	323189	323189	Deronda	197	" So - you would perhaps have been such a man as he if your education had not hindered ; for you are like him in features : yet not altogether , young man . He had an iron will in his face : it braced up everybody about him . When he was quite young he had already got one deep upright line in his brow . I see none of that in you . Daniel Charisi used to say , ' Better , a wrong will than a wavering ; better a steadfast enemy than an uncertain friend ; better a false belief than no belief at all . ' What he despised most was indifference . He had longer reasons than I can give you . "
322727	322735	322737	322737	Deronda	197	" Yet his knowledge was not narrow ? "
322757	322762	322764	322764	Kalonymos	706	" Narrow ? no , "
322773	323183	322767	322767	his	706	" From his childhood upward , he drank in learning as easily as the plant sucks up water . But he early took to medicine and theories about life and health . He traveled to many countries , and spent much of his substance in seeing and knowing . What he used to insist on was that the strength and wealth of mankind depended on the balance of separateness and communication , and he was bitterly against our people losing themselves among the Gentiles ; ' It 's no better , ' said he , ' than the many sorts of grain going back from their variety into sameness . ' He mingled all sorts of learning ; and in that he was like our Arabic writers in the golden time . We studied together , but he went beyond me . Though we were bosom friends , and he poured himself out to me , we were as different as the inside and outside of the bowl . I stood up for two notions of my own : I took Charisi 's sayings as I took the shape of the trees : they were there , not to be disputed about . It came to the same thing in both of us ; we were both faithful Jews , thankful not to be Gentiles . And since I was a ripe man , I have been what I am now , for all but age - loving to wander , loving transactions , loving to behold all things , and caring nothing about hardship . Charisi thought continually of our people 's future : he went with all his soul into that part of our religion : I , not . So we have freedom , I am content . Our people wandered before they were driven . Young man when I am in the East , I lie much on deck and watch the greater stars . The sight of them satisfies me . I know them as they rise , and hunger not to know more . Charisi was satisfied with no sight , but pieced it out with what had been before and what would come after . Yet we loved each other , and as he said , he bound our love with duty ; we solemnly pledged ourselves to help and defend each other to the last . I have fulfilled my pledge . "
323195	323244	323189	323189	Deronda	197	" And in being faithful to him you have caused justice to be done to me . It would have been a robbery of me too that I should never have known of the inheritance he had prepared for me . I thank you with my whole soul . "
323245	323259	323331	323331	Kalonymos	706	" Be worthy of him , young man . What is your vocation ? "
323291	323301	323289	323289	He	197	" I can not say that I have any . "
323302	323329	323334	323334	his	706	" Get one , get one . The Jew must be diligent . You will call yourself a Jew and profess the faith of your fathers ? "
323347	323355	323357	323357	Deronda	197	" I shall call myself a Jew , "
323372	323456	323357	323357	Deronda	197	" But I will not say that I shall profess to believe exactly as my fathers have believed . Our fathers themselves changed the horizon of their belief and learned of other races . But I think I can maintain my grandfather 's notion of separateness with communication . I hold that my first duty is to my own people , and if there is anything to be done toward restoring or perfecting their common life , I shall make that my vocation . "
323511	323527	323529	323529	Kalonymos	706	" Ah , you argue and you look forward you are Daniel Charisi 's grandson , "
323572	323612	323613	323615	GUIDO GUNICELLI Rossetti	753	" Within the gentle heart Love shelters him , As birds within the green shade of the grove . Before the gentle heart , in Nature 's scheme , Love was not , nor the gentle heart ere Love . "
323879	323900	323877	323877	Mab	424	" O - o - o , Hans ! why do you bring a more horrible noise than my singing ? "
323901	323910	323912	323913	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" What on earth is the wonderful news ? "
323925	323937	323912	323913	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Anything about Italy anything about the Austrians giving up Venice ? "
323938	323948	323950	323950	Hans	406	" Nothing about Italy , but something from Italy , "
323994	324000	323991	323991	We	6958	" What do you think ? "
324028	324032	324034	324035	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Nothing bad ? "
324056	324066	324068	324068	Hans	406	" Not bad for anybody we care much about , "
324072	324105	324068	324068	Hans	406	" rather uncommonly lucky , I think . I never knew anybody die conveniently before . Considering what a dear gazelle I am , I am constantly wondering to find myself alive . "
324106	324112	324114	324114	Mab	424	" Oh me , Hans ! "
324118	324141	324114	324114	Mab	424	" if you must talk of yourself , let it be behind your own back . What is it that has happened ? "
324142	324158	324160	324160	Hans	406	" Duke Alfonso is drowned , and the Duchess is alive , that 's all , "
324176	324260	324160	324160	Hans	406	" But more than all is Deronda was at Genoa in the same hotel with them , and he saw her brought in by the fishermen who had got her out of the water time enough to save her from any harm . It seems they saw her jump in after her husband , which was a less judicious action than I should have expected of the Duchess . However Deronda is a lucky fellow in being there to take care of her . "
324292	324310	324281	324282	Mrs. Meyrick	418	" Poor thing ! she must have been fond of her husband to jump in after him . "
324311	324322	324324	324324	Hans	406	" It was an inadvertence a little absence of mind , "
324342	324416	324333	324333	himself	406	" Who can be fond of a jealous baritone , with freezing glances , always singing asides ? that was the husband 's rŰle , depend upon it . Nothing can be neater than his getting drowned . The Duchess is at liberty now to marry a man with a fine head of hair , and glances that will melt instead of freezing her . And I shall be invited to the wedding . "
324450	324553	324439	324439	she	289	" Mr. Hans , you ought not to speak in that way . Mr. Deronda would not like you to speak so . Why will you say he is lucky why will you use words of that sort about life and death when what is life to one is death to another ? How do you know it would be lucky if he loved Mrs. Grandcourt ? It might be a great evil to him . She would take him away from my brother I know she would . Mr. Deronda would not call that lucky to pierce my brother 's heart . "
324619	324650	324615	324615	he	406	" I am a fool and a brute , and I withdraw every word . I 'll go and hang myself like Judas if it 's allowable to mention him . "
324761	324809	324811	324811	Mab	424	" Mirah is quite right to scold you , Hans . You are always taking Mr. Deronda 's name in vain . And it is horrible , joking in that way about his marrying Mrs. Grandcourt . Men 's minds must be very black , I think , "
324817	324824	324826	324826	Hans	406	" Quite true , my dear , "
324846	324866	324868	324868	Mirah	289	" We had better go on , Mab ; you have not given your full time to the lesson , "
324877	324892	324868	324868	Mirah	289	" Will you sing this again , or shall I sing it to you ? "
324893	324902	324904	324904	Mab	424	" Oh , please sing it to me , "
324979	324990	324974	324974	she	289	" I must go home now . Ezra expects me . "
325037	325045	325021	325023	the little mother	10303	" God bless you , my dear . "
325114	325119	325121	325121	Mab	424	" Now , Hans , "
325134	325162	325121	325121	Mab	424	" you are not going to walk home with Mirah . I am sure she would rather not . You are so dreadfully disagreeable to - day . "
325163	325180	325182	325182	Hans	406	" I shall go to take care of her , if she does not forbid me , "
325879	325884	325877	325877	Hans	406	" Good - bye , "
325907	325918	325896	325896	she	289	" Will you not come in and see my brother ? "
325979	325986	325975	325975	he	406	" If you will let me , "
326250	326257	326259	326259	Mordecai	538	" A letter from Daniel Deronda , "
326265	326298	326300	326300	Mordecai	538	" Brief only saying that he hopes soon to return . Unexpected claims have detained him . The promise of seeing him again is like the bow in the cloud to me , "
326306	326324	326300	326300	Mordecai	538	" and to you it must be a gladness . For who has two friends like him ? "
326996	327025	327028	327028	Mirah	289	" What I have read about and sung about and seen acted , is happening to me this that I am feeling is the love that makes jealousy ; "
327469	327494	327496	327498	the poor child	1437	" I could bear everything that used to be but this is worse this is worse , I used not to have horrible feelings ! "
327593	327599	327600	327600	he	538	" Seest thou , Mirah , "
327609	327882	327600	327600	he	538	" the Shemah , wherein we briefly confess the divine Unity , is the chief devotional exercise of the Hebrew ; and this made our religion the fundamental religion for the whole world ; for the divine Unity embraced as its consequence the ultimate unity of mankind . See , then the nation which has been scoffed at for its separateness , has given a binding theory to the human race . Now , in complete unity a part possesses the whole as the whole possesses every part : and in this way human life is tending toward the image of the Supreme Unity : for as our life becomes more spiritual by capacity of thought , and joy therein , possession tends to become more universal , being independent of gross material contact ; so that in a brief day the soul of man may know in fuller volume the good which has been and is , nay , is to come , than all he could possess in a whole life where he had to follow the creeping paths of the senses . In this moment , my sister , I hold the joy of another 's future within me : a future which these eyes will not see , and which my spirit may not then recognize as mine . I recognize it now , and love it so , that I can lay down this poor life upon its altar and say : ' Burn , burn indiscernibly into that which shall be , which is my love and not me . ' Dost thou understand , Mirah ? "
327883	327887	327889	327889	Mirah	289	" A little , "
327893	327905	327889	327889	Mirah	289	" but my mind is too poor to have felt it . "
327906	327910	327912	327912	Mordecai	538	" And yet , "
327917	328035	327912	327912	Mordecai	538	" women are specially framed for the love which feels possession in renouncing , and is thus a fit image of what I mean . Somewhere in the later Midrash , I think , is the story of a Jewish maiden who loved a Gentile king so well , that this was what she did : she entered into prison and changed clothes with the woman who was beloved by the king , that she might deliver that woman from death by dying in her stead , and leave the king to be happy in his love which was not for her . This is the surpassing love , that loses self in the object of love . "
328036	328043	328045	328045	Mirah	289	" No , Ezra , no , "
328053	328099	328045	328045	Mirah	289	" that was not it . She wanted the king when she was dead to know what she had done , and feel that she was better than the other . It was her strong self , wanting to conquer , that made her die . "
328109	328129	328100	328100	Mordecai	538	" That might be , Mirah . But if she acted so , believing the king would never know . "
328130	328202	327912	327912	Mordecai	538	" You can make the story so in your mind , Ezra , because you are great , and like to fancy the greatest that could be . But I think it was not really like that . The Jewish girl must have had jealousy in her heart , and she wanted somehow to have the first place in the king 's mind . That is what she would die for . "
328203	328258	328100	328100	Mordecai	538	" My sister , thou hast read too many plays , where the writers delight in showing the human passions as indwelling demons , unmixed with the relenting and devout elements of the soul . Thou judgest by the plays , and not by thy own heart , which is like our mother 's . "
328267	328328	327912	327912	Mordecai	538	" Das Gluck ist eine leichte Dirne , Und weilt nicht gern am selben Ort ; Sie streicht das Haar dir von der Stirn Und kusst dich rasch und flattert fort Frau Ungluck hat i m Gegentheile Dich liebefest an 's Herz gedruckt ; Sie sagt , sie habe keine Eile , Setzt sich zu dir ans Bett und strickt . "
328717	328720	328721	328721	She	289	" Mirah ! "
328917	328924	328914	328914	she	289	" It is you , father . "
328925	328936	328937	328937	he	7032	" Why did you run away from me , child ? "
328965	329203	329231	329232	a woman	801	" What were you afraid of ? You knew I never made you do anything against your will . It was for your sake I broke up your engagement in the Vorstadt , because I saw it did n't suit you , and you repaid me by leaving me to the bad times that came in consequence . I had made an easier engagement for you at the Vorstadt Theater in Dresden : I did n't tell you , because I wanted to take you by surprise . And you left me planted there obliged to make myself scarce because I had broken contract . That was hard lines for me , after I had given up everything for the sake of getting you an education which was to be a fortune to you . What father devoted himself to his daughter more than I did to you ? You know how I bore that disappointment in your voice , and made the best of it : and when I had nobody besides you , and was getting broken , as a man must who has had to fight his way with his brains you chose that time to leave me . Who else was it you owed everything to , if not to me ? and where was your feeling in return ? For what my daughter cared , I might have died in a ditch . "
329321	329368	329312	329312	she	289	" You know why I left you , father ; and I had reason to distrust you , because I felt sure that you had deceived my mother . If I could have trusted you , I would have stayed with you and worked for you . "
329369	329380	329382	329382	Lapidoth	289	" I never meant to deceive your mother , Mirah , "
329402	329500	329382	329382	Lapidoth	289	" I meant to take you back to her , but chances hindered me just at the time , and then there came information of her death . It was better for you that I should stay where I was , and your brother could take care of himself . Nobody had any claim on me but you . I had word of your mother 's death from a particular friend , who had undertaken to manage things for me , and I sent him over money to pay expenses . There 's one chance to be sure "
329515	329533	329506	329506	he	7039	" he may have written me lies for the sake of getting the money out of me . "
329549	329560	329539	329539	she	289	" I do n't believe one word of what you say "
329679	329700	329702	329703	the father	1507	" You seem to have done well for yourself , Mirah ? You are in no want , I see , "
329712	329727	329734	329734	she	289	" Good friends who found me in distress have helped me to get work , "
329750	329772	329773	329773	She	289	" I give lessons . I have sung in private houses . I have just been singing at a private concert . "
329783	329796	329773	329773	She	289	" I have very good friends , who know all about me . "
329797	329991	329773	329773	She	289	" And you would be ashamed they should see your father in this plight ? No wonder . I came to England with no prospect , but the chance of finding you . It was a mad quest ; but a father 's heart is superstitious feels a loadstone drawing it somewhere or other . I might have done very well , staying abroad : when I had n't you to take care of , I could have rolled or settled as easily as a ball ; but it 's hard being lonely in the world , when your spirit 's beginning to break . And I thought my little Mirah would repent leaving her father when she came to look back . I 've had a sharp pinch to work my way ; I do n't know what I shall come down to next . Talents like mine are no use in this country . When a man 's getting out at elbows nobody will believe in him . I could n't get any decent employ with my appearance . I 've been obliged to get pretty low for a shilling already . "
330047	330055	330044	330044	he	923	" Where do you live , Mirah ? "
330056	330071	330044	330044	he	923	" Here , in this square . We are not far from the house . "
330072	330076	330044	330044	he	923	" In lodgings ? "
330077	330080	330044	330044	he	923	" Yes . "
330081	330090	330044	330044	he	923	" Any one to take care of you ? "
330091	330094	330096	330096	Mirah	289	" Yes , "
330110	330114	330096	330096	Mirah	289	" my brother . "
330149	330162	330140	330140	he	923	" Ezra ? How did you know how did you find him ? "
330163	330190	330140	330140	he	923	" That would take long to tell . Here we are at the door . My brother would not wish me to close it on you . "
330302	330309	330311	330311	Lapidoth	289	" Stay a minute , Liebchen , "
330319	330329	330311	330311	Lapidoth	289	" what sort of man has Ezra turned out ? "
330330	330338	330340	330340	Mirah	289	" A good man a wonderful man , "
330379	330527	330528	330528	Mirah	289	" But he was very poor when my friends found him for me a poor workman . Once twelve years ago he was strong and happy , going to the East , which he loved to think of ; and my mother called him back because because she had lost me . And he went to her , and took care of her through great trouble , and worked for her till she died died in grief . And Ezra , too , had lost his health and strength . The cold had seized him coming back to my mother , because she was forsaken . For years he has been getting weaker always poor , always working but full of knowledge , and great - minded . All who come near him honor him . To stand before him is like standing before a prophet of God "
330536	330542	330533	330533	her	289	" falsehoods are no use . "
330588	330593	330594	330594	he	923	" Mirah , Liebchen , "
330752	330752	330733	330733	you	289	"
330776	330839	330766	330766	She	289	" I do n't like to deny you what you ask , father ; but I have given a promise not to do things for you in secret . It is hard to see you looking needy ; but we will bear that for a little while ; and then you can have new clothes , and we can pay for them . "
330876	330936	330869	330869	He	8307	" You are a hard and fast young lady you have been learning useful virtues keeping promises not to help your father with a pound or two when you are getting money to dress yourself in silk your father who made an idol of you , and gave up the best part of his life to providing for you . "
330937	330947	330949	330949	Mirah	289	" It seems cruel I know it seems cruel , "
330970	331028	330964	330964	Her	289	" But , father , it is more cruel to break the promises people trust in . That broke my mother 's heart it has broken Ezra 's life . You and I must eat now this bitterness from what has been . Bear it . Bear to come in and be cared for as you are . "
331029	331036	331043	331043	his	7058	" To - morrow , then , "
331095	331148	331067	331067	he	7058	" I 'm a little cut up with all this , Mirah . I shall get up my spirits by to - morrow . If you 've a little money in your pocket , I suppose it is n't against your promise to give me a trifle to buy a cigar with . "
331192	331205	331178	331178	Lapidoth	289	" Good - bye , my little girl to - morrow then ! "
331282	331290	331264	331265	his mother	1581	" May Mirah be delivered from evil . "
331651	331656	331636	331636	she	289	" Ezra , Ezra ! "
331718	331783	331707	331707	she	289	" Ezra , my father ! our father ! He followed me . I wanted him to come in . I said you would let him come in . And he said No , he would not not now , but to - morrow . And he begged for money from me . And I gave him my purse , and he went away . "
331814	331827	331834	331834	his	7890	" Wait for calm , Mirah , and then tell me all , "
331864	331873	331875	331875	Mordecai	538	" He will not come to - morrow , "
331905	331909	331910	331910	he	7890	" Seest thou , "
331914	331968	331910	331910	he	7890	" our lot is the lot of Israel . The grief and the glory are mingled as the smoke and the flame . It is because we children have inherited the good that we feel the evil . These things are wedded for us , as our father was wedded to our mother . "

Nur war dieser K nstlergeist bei ihm , wie bei seinen šgyptischen Landsleuteu , nurauf das Colossale und Unverwustliche gerichtet . Aber nicht vie die Aegypter formirte er seine Kunstwerke aus Backstem und Granit , sondern er baute Menchen - pyramiden , er meisselte Menschen Obelisken , ernahm einen armen Hirtenstamm und Schuf daraus ein Volk , das ebenfalls den Jahrhahunderten , trotzen sollte er Schuf Israel . "
333635	333643	333697	333697	Deronda	197	" Daniel Deronda may he come in ? "
333644	333649	333651	333651	Mordecai	538	" Come ! come ! "
333782	333790	333776	333776	he	197	" Has anything happened ? any trouble ? "
333791	333798	333800	333800	Mordecai	538	" Talk not of trouble now , "
333810	333823	333800	333800	Mordecai	538	" There is joy in your face let the joy be ours . "
333827	333838	333824	333824	Mirah	289	" It is for something he can not tell us . "
333855	333860	333861	333861	he	197	" That is true , "
333866	333916	333861	333861	he	197	" I have a joy which will remain to us even in the worst trouble . I did not tell you the reason of my journey abroad , Mordecai , because never mind I went to learn my parentage . And you were right . I am a Jew . "
333963	333988	333961	333961	his	197	" We have the same people . Our souls have the same vocation . We shall not be separated by life or by death . "
334018	334028	333961	333961	his	197	" Our God and the God of our fathers . "
334133	334145	334146	334146	Deronda	289	" And it is not only that I am a Jew , "
334177	334369	334146	334146	Deronda	289	" but I come of a strain that has ardently maintained the fellowship of our race a line of Spanish Jews that has borne many students and men of practical power . And I possess what will give us a sort of communion with them . My grandfather , Daniel Charisi , preserved manuscripts , family records stretching far back , in the hope that they would pass into the hands of his grandson . And now his hope is fulfilled , in spite of attempts to thwart it by hiding my parentage from me . I possess the chest containing them , with his own papers , and it is down below in this house . I mean to leave it with you , Mordecai , that you may help me to study the manuscripts . Some of them I can read easily enough those in Spanish and Italian . Others are in Hebrew , and , I think , Arabic ; but there seem to be Latin translations . I was only able to look at them cursorily while I stayed at Mainz . We will study them together . "
334626	334891	334619	334619	his	538	" Daniel , from the first , I have said to you , we know not all the pathways . Has there not been a meeting among them , as of the operations in one soul , where an idea being born and breathing draws the elements toward it , and is fed and glows ? For all things are bound together in that Omnipresence which is the place and habitation of the world , and events are of a glass wherethrough our eyes see some of the pathways . And if it seems that the erring and unloving wills of men have helped to prepare you , as Moses was prepared , to serve your people the better , that depends on another order than the law which must guide our footsteps . For the evil will of man makes not a people 's good except by stirring the righteous will of man ; and beneath all the clouds with which our thought encompasses the Eternal , this is clear that a people can be blessed only by having counsellors and a multitude whose will moves in obedience to the laws of justice and love . For see , now , it was your loving will that made a chief pathway , and resisted the effect of evil ; for , by performing the duties of brotherhood to my sister , and seeking out her brother in the flesh , your soul has been prepared to receive with gladness this message of the Eternal , ' behold the multitude of your brethren . ' "
334892	334906	334908	334908	Deronda	289	" It is quite true that you and Mirah have been my teachers , "
334910	334993	334908	334908	Deronda	289	" If this revelation had been made to me before I knew you both , I think my mind would have rebelled against it . Perhaps I should have felt then ' If I could have chosen , I would not have been a Jew . ' What I feel now is that my whole being is a consent to the fact . But it has been the gradual accord between your mind and mine which has brought about that full consent . "
335082	335379	335076	335076	he	7125	" It is through your inspiration that I have discerned what may be my life 's task . It is you who have given shape to what , I believe , was an inherited yearning the effect of brooding , passionate thoughts in many ancestors thoughts that seem to have been intensely present in my grandfather . Suppose the stolen offspring of some mountain tribe brought up in a city of the plain , or one with an inherited genius for painting , and born blind the ancestral life would lie within them as a dim longing for unknown objects and sensations , and the spell - bound habit of their inherited frames would be like a cunningly - wrought musical instrument , never played on , but quivering throughout in uneasy mysterious meanings of its intricate structure that , under the right touch , gives music . Something like that , I think , has been my experience . Since I began to read and know , I have always longed for some ideal task , in which I might feel myself the heart and brain of a multitude some social captainship , which would come to me as a duty , and not be striven for as a personal prize . You have raised the image of such a task for me to bind our race together in spite of heresy . You have said to me ' Our religion united us before it divided us it made us a people before it made Rabbanites and Karaites . ' I mean to try what can be done with that union I mean to work in your spirit . Failure will not be ignoble , but it would be ignoble for me not to try . "
335380	335394	335396	335396	Mordecai	538	" Even as my brother that fed at the breasts of my mother , "
335534	335693	335531	335531	Mordecai	538	" It has begun already the marriage of our souls . It waits but the passing away of this body , and then they who are betrothed shall unite in a stricter bond , and what is mine shall be thine . Call nothing mine that I have written , Daniel ; for though our masters delivered rightly that everything should be quoted in the name of him that said it and their rule is good yet it does not exclude the willing marriage which melts soul into soul , and makes thought fuller as the clear waters are made fuller , where the fullness is inseparable and the clearness is inseparable . For I have judged what I have written , and I desire the body that I gave my thought to pass away as this fleshly body will pass ; but let the thought be born again from our fuller soul which shall be called yours . "
335694	335704	335706	335706	Deronda	289	" You must not ask me to promise that , "
335710	335815	335706	335706	Deronda	289	" I must be convinced first of special reasons for it in the writings themselves . And I am too backward a pupil yet . That blent transmission must go on without any choice of ours ; but what we ca n't hinder must not make our rule for what we ought to choose . I think our duty is faithful tradition where we can attain it . And so you would insist for any one but yourself . Do n't ask me to deny my spiritual parentage , when I am finding the clue of my life in the recognition of natural parentage . "
335816	335829	335831	335831	Mordecai	538	" I will ask for no promise till you see the reason , "
335833	335952	335831	335831	Mordecai	538	" You have said the truth : I would obey the Master 's rule for another . But for years my hope , nay , my confidence , has been , not that the imperfect image of my thought , which is an ill - shaped work of the youthful carver who has seen a heavenly pattern , and trembles in imitating the vision not that this should live , but that my vision and passion should enter into yours yea , into yours ; for he whom I longed for afar , was he not you whom I discerned as mine when you came near ? Nevertheless , you shall judge . For my soul is satisfied . "
335973	335979	335981	335981	he	538	" What moved your parents ? "
335989	336010	335981	335981	he	538	" Nay , I ask not that you should tell me aught concerning others , unless it is your pleasure . "
336011	336020	336022	336022	Deronda	289	" Some time gradually you will know all , "
336024	336061	336022	336022	Deronda	289	" But now tell me more about yourselves , and how the time has passed since I went away . I am sure there has been some trouble . Mirah has been in distress about something . "
336185	336283	336183	336183	Mordecai	538	" To - day there has been a grief . A duty which seemed to have gone far into the distance , has come back and turned its face upon us , and raised no gladness has raised a dread that we must submit to . But for the moment we are delivered from any visible yoke . Let us defer speaking of it as if this evening which is deepening about us were the beginning of the festival in which we must offer the first fruits of our joy , and mingle no mourning with them . "
336308	336366	336298	336298	he	7890	" Are you going ? I must leave almost immediately when I and Mrs. Adam have mounted the precious chest , and I have delivered the key to Mordecai no , Ezra , may I call him Ezra now ? I have learned to think of him as Ezra since I have heard you call him so . "
336367	336373	336375	336375	Mirah	289	" Please call him Ezra , "
337056	337082	337083	337083	DANTE	416	" Questa montagna e tale , Che sempre al cominciar di sotto a grave . E quanto uom piu va su e men fa male . "
337171	337182	337184	337184	Gwendolen	289	" I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again , "
337295	337302	337304	337304	Gwendolen	289	" Are you there , mamma ? "
337348	337360	337391	337391	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , dear ; can I do anything for you ? "
337361	337384	337391	337391	Gwendolen	289	" No , thank you ; only I like so to know you are there . Do you mind my waking you ? "
337398	337406	337391	337391	Gwendolen	289	" I was not asleep , darling . "
337407	337468	337391	337391	Gwendolen	289	" It seemed not real that you were with me . I wanted to make it real . I can bear things if you are with me . But you must not lie awake , anxious about me . You must be happy now . You must let me make you happy now at last else what shall I do ? "
337469	337492	337391	337391	Gwendolen	289	" God bless you , dear ; I have the best happiness I can have , when you make much of me . "
337509	337521	337505	337506	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Let me give you your sleeping - draught , Gwendolen . "
337522	337537	337391	337391	Gwendolen	289	" No , mamma , thank you ; I do n't want to sleep . "
337538	337553	337505	337506	Mrs. Davilow	330	" It would be so good for you to sleep more , my darling . "
337554	337567	337568	337568	Gwendolen	289	" Do n't say what would be good for me , mamma , "
337573	337609	337568	337568	Gwendolen	289	" You do n't know what would be good for me . You and my uncle must not contradict me and tell me anything is good for me when I feel it is not good . "
337627	337637	337624	337625	Presently Gwendolen	289	" I was always naughty to you , mamma . "
337638	337645	337624	337625	Presently Gwendolen	289	" No , dear , no . "
337646	337652	337654	337654	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , I was , "
337657	337671	337654	337654	Gwendolen	289	" It is because I was always wicked that I am miserable now . "
338090	338126	338131	338131	he	1395	" When a young man makes his will in health , he usually counts on living a long while . Probably Mr. Grandcourt did not believe that this will would ever have its present effect . "
338134	338163	338131	338131	he	1395	" The effect is painful in more ways than one . Female morality is likely to suffer from this marked advantage and prominence being given to illegitimate offspring . "
338164	338172	338174	338175	Sir Hugo	209	" Well , in point of fact , "
338449	338449	338424	338447	the fellows in the Crimean war , who were ready to go to the bottom of the sea if their widows were provided for	7203	"
338450	338459	338461	338462	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" It has certainly taken me by surprise , "
338464	338523	338461	338462	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" all the more because , as the one who stood in the place of father to my niece , I had shown my reliance on Mr. Grandcourt 's apparent liberality in money matters by making no claims for her beforehand . That seemed to me due to him under the circumstances . Probably you think me blamable . "
338524	338636	338424	338447	the fellows in the Crimean war , who were ready to go to the bottom of the sea if their widows were provided for	7203	" Not blamable exactly . I respect a man for trusting another . But take my advice . If you marry another niece , though it may be to the Archbishop of Canterbury , bind him down . Your niece ca n't be married for the first time twice over . And if he 's a good fellow , he 'll wish to be bound . But as to Mrs. Grandcourt , I can only say that I feel my relation to her all the nearer because I think that she has not been well treated . And I hope you will urge her to rely on me as a friend . "
338971	338990	338992	338992	Gwendolen	289	" I hope you do n't expect that I am going to be rich and grand , mamma , "
339002	339011	338992	338992	Gwendolen	289	" perhaps I shall have nothing at all . "
339038	339057	339025	339026	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Oh yes , dear , you will have something . Sir Hugo knows all about the will . "
339058	339064	339066	339066	Gwendolen	289	" That will not decide , "
339070	339092	339025	339026	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Surely , dear : Sir Hugo says you are to have two thousand a year and the house at Gadsmere . "
339093	339104	339106	339106	Gwendolen	289	" What I have will depend on what I accept , "
339108	339161	339106	339106	Gwendolen	289	" You and my uncle must not attempt to cross me and persuade me about this . I will do everything I can do to make you happy , but in anything about my husband I must not be interfered with . Is eight hundred a year enough for you , mamma ? "
339162	339179	339180	339181	Mrs. Davilow	330	" More than enough , dear . You must not think of giving me so much . "
339190	339207	339180	339181	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Do you know who is to have the estates and the rest of the money ? "
339208	339211	339213	339213	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , "
339224	339244	339216	339216	her	289	" I know everything . It is all perfectly right , and I wish never to have it mentioned . "
339348	339364	339342	339342	her	289	" Come and sit nearer to me , mamma , and do n't be unhappy . "
339394	339435	339386	339386	Gwendolen	289	" I mean to be very wise ; I do , really . And good oh , so good to you , dear , old , sweet mamma , you wo n't know me . Only you must not cry . "
339804	339808	339803	339803	her	289	" my dear , "
339827	339829	339803	339803	her	289	" we "
339938	339948	339950	339951	the baronet	7684	" I should n't mind about the soot myself , "
339963	340013	339950	339951	the baronet	7684	" Nothing is more healthy . And if one 's business lay there , Gadsmere would be a paradise . It makes quite a feature in Scrogg 's history of the county , with the little tower and the fine piece of water the prettiest print in the book . "
340014	340025	340027	340028	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" A more important place than Offendene , I suppose ? "
340030	340033	340035	340036	the baronet	7684	" Much , "
340040	340082	340035	340036	the baronet	7684	" I was there with my poor brother it is more than a quarter of a century ago , but I remember it very well . The rooms may not be larger , but the grounds are on a different scale . "
340083	340093	340095	340096	Mrs. Davilow	330	" Our poor dear Offendene is empty after all , "
340098	340156	340095	340096	Mrs. Davilow	330	" When it came to the point , Mr. Haynes declared off , and there has been no one to take it since . I might as well have accepted Lord Brackenshaw 's kind offer that I should remain in it another year rent - free : for I should have kept the place aired and warmed . "
340157	340166	340168	340169	Sir Hugo	209	" I hope you 've something snug instead , "
340171	340177	340179	340180	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" A little too snug , "
340191	340200	340179	340180	Mr. Gascoigne	215	" You are rather thick upon the ground . "
340658	340666	340668	340669	Sir Hugo	209	" I do n't mind telling you , "
341331	341371	341316	341316	she	289	" Sir Hugo , I wish to see Mr. Deronda again as soon as possible . I do n't know his address . Will you tell it me , or let him know that I want to see him ? "
341394	341469	341391	341391	he	209	" Upon my word , I do n't know whether he 's at his chambers or the Abbey at this moment . But I 'll make sure of him . I 'll send a note now to his chambers telling him to come , and if he 's at the Abbey I can give him your message and send him up at once . I am sure he will want to obey your wish , "
341807	341831	341832	341832	MILTON	601	" O , welcome , pure - eyed Faith , white - handed Hope , Thou hovering angel , girt with golden wings ! "
342432	342446	342429	342429	She	289	" It was good of you to come . Let us sit down , "
342462	342481	342482	342482	she	289	" I asked you to come because I want you to tell me what I ought to do , "
342488	342579	342482	342482	she	289	" Do n't be afraid of telling me what you think is right , because it seems hard . I have made up my mind to do it . I was afraid once of being poor ; I could not bear to think of being under other people ; and that was why I did something why I married . I have borne worse things now . I think I could bear to be poor , if you think I ought . Do you know about my husband 's will ? "
342580	342588	342590	342590	Deronda	289	" Yes , Sir Hugo told me , "
342601	342622	342624	342624	Gwendolen	289	" Ought I to take anything he has left me ? I will tell you what I have been thinking , "
342632	342760	342624	342624	Gwendolen	289	" Perhaps you may not quite know that I really did think a good deal about my mother when I married . I was selfish , but I did love her , and feel about her poverty ; and what comforted me most at first , when I was miserable , was her being better off because I had married . The thing that would be hardest to me now would be to see her in poverty again ; and I have been thinking that if I took enough to provide for her , and no more nothing for myself it would not be wrong ; for I was very precious to my mother and he took me from her and he meant and if she had known "
342845	342855	342857	342857	Deronda	289	" Do not hurt yourself by speaking of that , "
342861	342912	342913	342913	He	7335	" There is no need ; the case is very simple . I think I can hardly judge wrongly about it . You consult me because I am the only person to whom you have confided the most painful part of your experience : and I can understand your scruples . "
342960	343050	342957	342957	he	7335	" You are conscious of something which you feel to be a crime toward one who is dead . You think that you have forfeited all claim as a wife . You shrink from taking what was his . You want to keep yourself from profiting by his death . Your feeling even urges you to some self - punishment some scourging of the self that disobeyed your better will the will that struggled against temptation . I have known something of that myself . Do I understand you ? "
343051	343068	343070	343070	Gwendolen	289	" Yes at least , I want to be good not like what I have been , "
343072	343103	343070	343070	Gwendolen	289	" I will try to bear what you think I ought to bear . I have tried to tell you the worst about myself . What ought I to do ? "
343104	343118	343120	343120	Deronda	289	" If no one but yourself were concerned in this question of income , "
343122	343240	343120	343120	Deronda	289	" I should hardly dare to urge you against any remorseful prompting ; but I take as a guide now , your feeling about Mrs. Davilow , which seems to me quite just . I can not think that your husband 's dues even to yourself are nullified by any act you have committed . He voluntarily entered into your life , and affected its course in what is always the most momentous way . But setting that aside , it was due from him in his position that he should provide for your mother , and he of course understood that if this will took effect she would share the provision he had made for you . "
343241	343263	343265	343265	Gwendolen	289	" She has had eight hundred a year . What I thought of was to take that and leave the rest , "
343291	343307	343309	343309	Deronda	289	" I think it is not your duty to fix a limit in that way , "
343311	343427	343309	343309	Deronda	289	" You would be making a painful enigma for Mrs. Davilow ; an income from which you shut yourself out must be embittered to her . And your own course would become too difficult . We agreed at Genoa that the burden on your conscience is one what no one ought to be admitted to the knowledge of . The future beneficence of your life will be best furthered by your saving all others from the pain of that knowledge . In my opinion you ought simply to abide by the provisions of your husband 's will , and let your remorse tell only on the use that you will make of your monetary independence . "
343523	343532	343534	343534	Gwendolen	289	" I will do what you tell me , "
343538	343546	343534	343534	Gwendolen	289	" but what else shall I do ? "
343661	343675	343653	343653	he	7336	" You will probably be soon going with Mrs. Davilow into the country . "
343676	343686	343687	343687	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , in a week or ten days . "
343708	343733	343693	343693	her	289	" I want to be kind to them all they can be happier than I can . Is that the best I can do ? "
343734	343749	343751	343751	Deronda	289	" I think so . It is a duty that can not be doubtful , "
343771	343865	343753	343753	He	7336	" Other duties will spring from it . Looking at your life as a debt may seem the dreariest view of things at a distance ; but it can not really be so . What makes life dreary is the want of motive : but once beginning to act with that penitential , loving purpose you have in your mind , there will be unexpected satisfactions there will be newly - opening needs continually coming to carry you on from day to day . You will find your life growing like a plant . "
343913	343959	343911	343911	he	7336	" This sorrow , which has cut down to the root , has come to you while you are so young try to think of it not as a spoiling of your life , but as a preparation for it . Let it be a preparation "
343976	344090	343968	343968	he	7336	" See ! you have been saved from the worst evils that might have come from your marriage , which you feel was wrong . You have had a vision of injurious , selfish action a vision of possible degradation ; think that a severe angel , seeing you along the road of error , grasped you by the wrist and showed you the horror of the life you must avoid . And it has come to you in your spring - time . Think of it as a preparation . You can , you will , be among the best of women , such as make others glad that they were born . "
344268	344275	344263	344263	his	7340	" I must not weary you . "
344298	344306	344307	344307	he	7340	" You look ill yet unlike yourself , "
344316	344323	344324	344324	she	289	" I ca n't sleep much , "
344335	344352	344353	344353	she	289	" Things repeat themselves in me so . They come back they will all come back , "
344364	344373	344375	344375	Deronda	289	" By degrees they will be less insistent , "
344390	344402	344404	344404	Gwendolen	289	" Sir Hugo says he shall come to stay at Diplow , "
344418	344424	344404	344404	Gwendolen	289	" You will come too . "
344425	344428	344430	344430	Deronda	289	" Probably , "
344446	344453	344441	344441	he	7340	" Yes , I shall come , "
344475	344486	344488	344488	Gwendolen	289	" And not again here , before I leave town ? "
344505	344521	344502	344502	Deronda	289	" If I can be of any use if you wish me certainly I will . "
344522	344528	344530	344530	Gwendolen	289	" I must wish it , "
344534	344552	344530	344530	Gwendolen	289	" you know I must wish it . What strength have I ? Who else is there ? "
344578	344584	344575	344575	he	7340	" I will certainly come . "
344626	344634	344635	344635	she	289	" Do n't be unhappy about me , "
344645	344669	344635	344635	she	289	" I shall remember your words every one of them . I shall remember what you believe about me ; I shall try . "
345430	345443	345444	345444	BROWNING	698	" One day still fierce ' mid many a day struck calm . "
345737	345739	345746	345746	he	7361	" Pyramids "
346156	346162	346146	346146	Mirah	289	" Herz , mein Herz , "
346184	346196	346173	346174	Mrs. Adam	546	" A gentleman below says he is your father , miss . "
346197	346205	346207	346207	Mirah	289	" I will go down to him , "
346218	346226	346228	346228	Ezra	538	" No , Mirah , not so , "
346233	346242	346228	346228	Ezra	538	" Let him come up , Mrs. Adam . "
346353	346359	346346	346346	herself	546	" Father , sure enough . "
346437	346454	346435	346435	he	538	" Well , Ezra , my boy , you hardly know me after so many years . "
346455	346463	346465	346465	Ezra	538	" I know you too well father , "
346480	346531	346533	346533	Lapidoth	289	" Ah , you are not pleased with me . I do n't wonder at it . Appearances have been against me . When a man gets into straits he ca n't do just as he would by himself or anybody else , I 've suffered enough , I know , "
346561	346720	346553	346553	he	8093	" Here 's your little purse , my dear . I thought you 'd be anxious about it because of that bit of writing . I 've emptied it , you 'll see , for I had a score to pay for food and lodging . I knew you would like me to clear myself , and here I stand without a single farthing in my pocket at the mercy of my children . You can turn me out if you like , without getting a policeman . Say the word , Mirah ; say , ' Father , I 've had enough of you ; you made a pet of me , and spent your all on me , when I could n't have done without you ; but I can do better without you now , ' say that , and I 'm gone out like a spark . I sha n't spoil your pleasure again . "
346735	346746	346748	346748	Mirah	289	" You know I could never say it , father , "
346775	346784	346786	346786	Ezra	538	" Mirah , my sister , leave us ! "
346864	346879	346841	346841	her	289	" Remember , Ezra you said my mother would not have shut him out . "
346880	346887	346889	346889	Ezra	538	" Trust me , and go , "
347063	347071	347072	347072	Ezra	538	" This home that we have here , "
347075	347360	347072	347072	Ezra	538	" is maintained partly by the generosity of a beloved friend who supports me , and partly by the labors of my sister , who supports herself . While we have a home we will not shut you out from it . We will not cast you out to the mercy of your vices . For you are our father , and though you have broken your bond , we acknowledge ours . But I will never trust you . You absconded with money , leaving your debts unpaid ; you forsook my mother ; you robbed her of her little child and broke her heart ; you have become a gambler , and where shame and conscience were there sits an insatiable desire ; you were ready to sell my sister you had sold her , but the price was denied you . The man who has done these things must never expect to be trusted any more . We will share our food with you you shall have a bed , and clothing . We will do this duty to you , because you are our father . But you will never be trusted . You are an evil man : you made the misery of our mother . That such a man is our father is a brand on our flesh which will not cease smarting . But the Eternal has laid it upon us ; and though human justice were to flog you for crimes , and your body fell helpless before the public scorn , we would still say , ' This is our father ; make way , that we may carry him out of your sight . ' "
347720	347810	347709	347709	his	1507	" Good - bye , Mirah ; your father will not trouble you again . He deserves to die like a dog by the roadside , and he will . If your mother had lived , she would have forgiven me thirty - four years ago I put the ring on her finger under the Chuppa , and we were made one . She would have forgiven me , and we should have spent our old age together . But I have n't deserved it . Good - bye . "
347821	347826	347817	347817	he	7404	" good - bye . "
347856	347863	347853	347853	she	289	" No , father , no ! "
347870	347911	347853	347853	she	289	" Ezra , you have not forbidden him ? Stay , father , and leave off wrong things . Ezra , I can not bear it . How can I say to my father , ' Go and die ! ' "
347912	347919	347920	347920	Ezra	538	" I have not said it , "
347927	347937	347920	347920	Ezra	538	" I have said , stay and be sheltered . "
347938	347955	347957	347957	Mirah	289	" Then you will stay , father and be taken care of and come with me , "
348012	348071	348001	348001	She	289	" This is my sitting - room when I am not with Ezra , and there is a bed - room behind which shall be yours . You will stay and be good , father . Think that you are come back to my mother , and that she has forgiven you she speaks to you through me . "
348517	348527	348528	348528	Ezra	538	" I am become calm in beholding him now , "
348531	348594	348528	348528	Ezra	538	" and I try to think it possible that my sister 's tenderness , and the daily tasting a life of peace , may win him to remain aloof from temptation . I have enjoined her , and she has promised , to trust him with no money . I have convinced her that he will buy with it his own destruction . "
349093	349124	349082	349082	Ezra	538	" Let all the writing be done here ; for I can not trust the papers out of my sight , lest there be an accident by burning or otherwise . "
349753	349779	349750	349750	Deronda	289	" You do n't look much as if you had been in the country , old fellow . Is it Cambridge you have been to ? "
349780	349783	349785	349785	Hans	406	" No , "
349835	349858	349831	349831	he	406	" I 've been to I - don't -know - where No man 's land and a mortally unpleasant country it is . "
349859	349873	349875	349875	Deronda	289	" You do n't mean to say you have been drinking , Hans , "
349887	349964	349831	349831	he	406	" Nothing so good . I 've been smoking opium . I always meant to do it some time or other , to try how much bliss could be got by it ; and having found myself just now rather out of other bliss , I thought it judicious to seize the opportunity . But I pledge you my word I shall never tap a cask of that bliss again . It disagrees with my constitution . "
349965	349984	349831	349831	he	406	" What has been the matter ? You were in good spirits enough when you wrote to me . "
349985	350020	350022	350022	Hans	406	" Oh , nothing in particular . The world began to look seedy a sort of cabbage - garden with all the cabbages cut . A malady of genius , you may be sure , "
350031	350053	350022	350022	Hans	406	" and , in fact , I was tired of being virtuous without reward , especially in this hot London weather . "
350054	350062	350064	350064	Deronda	289	" Nothing else ? No real vexation ? "
350071	350099	350022	350022	Hans	406	" I came to tell you of my own affairs , but I ca n't do it with a good grace if you are to hide yours . "
350100	350109	350111	350111	Hans	406	" Have n't an affair in the world , "
350118	350164	350111	350111	Hans	406	" except a quarrel with a bric - a - brac man . Besides , as it is the first time in our lives that you ever spoke to me about your own affairs , you are only beginning to pay a pretty long debt . "
350196	350210	350211	350211	he	7465	" You laughed at the mystery of my journey to Italy , Hans , "
350214	350318	350211	350211	he	7465	" It was for an object that touched my happiness at the very roots . I had never known anything about my parents , and I really went to Genoa to meet my mother . My father has been long dead died when I was an infant . My mother was the daughter of an eminent Jew ; my father was her cousin . Many things had caused me to think of this origin as almost a probability before I set out . I was so far prepared for the result that I was glad of it glad to find myself a Jew . "
350319	350331	350333	350333	Hans	406	" You must not expect me to look surprised , Deronda , "
350355	350360	350333	350333	Hans	406	" You knew it ? "
350361	350425	350427	350427	Hans	406	" My mother told me . She went to the house the morning after you had been there brother and sister both told her . You may imagine we ca n't rejoice as they do . But whatever you are glad of , I shall come to be glad of in the end when exactly the end may be I ca n't predict , "
350463	350475	350477	350477	Deronda	289	" I quite understand that you ca n't share my feeling , "
350479	350549	350477	350477	Deronda	289	" but I could not let silence lie between us on what casts quite a new light over my future . I have taken up some of Mordecai 's ideas , and I mean to try and carry them out , so far as one man 's efforts can go . I dare say I shall by and by travel to the East and be away for some years . "
350607	350621	350595	350596	Presently Hans	771	" Excuse the question , but does Mrs. Grandcourt know of all this ? "
350622	350634	350636	350636	Deronda	289	" No ; and I must beg of you , Hans , "
350641	350666	350636	350636	Deronda	289	" to cease joking on that subject . Any notions you have are wide of the truth are the very reverse of the truth . "
350667	350684	350686	350686	Hans	406	" I am no more inclined to joke than I shall be at my own funeral , "
350688	350708	350686	350686	Hans	406	" But I am not at all sure that you are aware what are my notions on that subject . "
350709	350713	350715	350715	Deronda	289	" Perhaps not , "
350717	350768	350715	350715	Deronda	289	" But let me say , once for all , that in relation to Mrs. Grandcourt , I never have had , and never shall have the position of a lover . If you have ever seriously put that interpretation on anything you have observed , you are supremely mistaken . "
350790	350802	350804	350804	Hans	406	" Perhaps I have been mistaken in another interpretation , also , "
350808	350813	350804	350804	Hans	406	" What is that ? "
350814	350838	350943	350943	Deronda	289	" That you had no wish to hold the position of a lover toward another woman , who is neither wife nor widow . "
350839	350878	350804	350804	Hans	406	" I ca n't pretend not to understand you , Meyrick . It is painful that our wishes should clash . I hope you will tell me if you have any ground for supposing that you would succeed . "
350879	350892	350894	350894	Hans	406	" That seems rather a superfluous inquiry on your part , Deronda , "
350900	350904	350894	350894	Hans	406	" Why superfluous ? "
350905	350926	350804	350804	Hans	406	" Because you are perfectly convinced on the subject and probably have had the very best evidence to convince you . "
350927	350941	350943	350943	Deronda	289	" I will be more frank with you than you are with me , "
350960	350983	350943	350943	Deronda	289	" I have never had the slightest evidence that I should succeed myself . In fact , I have very little hope . "
351000	351007	351009	351009	Deronda	289	" And in our present situation , "
351031	351110	351028	351028	his	406	" I do n't see how I can deliberately make known my feeling to her . If she could not return it , I should have embittered her best comfort ; for neither she nor I can be parted from her brother , and we should have to meet continually . If I were to cause her that sort of pain by an unwilling betrayal of my feeling , I should be no better than a mischievous animal . "
351111	351126	351128	351128	Hans	406	" I do n't know that I have ever betrayed my feeling to her , "
351137	351157	351132	351132	he	406	" You mean that we are on a level , then ; you have no reason to envy me . "
351158	351165	351167	351167	Hans	406	" Oh , not the slightest , "
351173	351190	351167	351167	Hans	406	" You have measured my conceit and know that it out - tops all your advantages . "
351191	351212	351214	351214	Deronda	289	" I am a nuisance to you , Meyrick . I am sorry , but I ca n't help it , "
351218	351280	351214	351214	Deronda	289	" After what passed between us before , I wished to have this explanation ; and I do n't see that any pretensions of mine have made a real difference to you . They are not likely to make any pleasant difference to myself under present circumstances . Now the father is there did you know that the father is there ? "
351281	351304	351306	351306	Hans	406	" Yes . If he were not a Jew I would permit myself to damn him with faint praise , I mean , "
351313	351399	351446	351446	Hans	406	" She and I meet under greater constraint than ever . Things might go on in this way for two years without my getting any insight into her feeling toward me . That is the whole state of affairs , Hans . Neither you nor I have injured the other , that I can see . We must put up with this sort of rivalry in a hope that is likely enough to come to nothing . Our friendship can bear that strain , surely . "
351400	351407	351409	351409	Hans	406	" No , it ca n't , "
351453	351501	351446	351446	Hans	406	" Our friendship my friendship ca n't bear the strain of behaving to you like an ungrateful dastard and grudging you your happiness . For you are the happiest dog in the world . If Mirah loves anybody better than her brother , you are the man . "
351542	351555	351540	351540	he	406	" It is a good - natured fiction of yours , Hans . "
351556	351627	351540	351540	he	406	" I am not in a good - natured mood . I assure you I found the fact disagreeable when it was thrust on me all the more , or perhaps all the less , because I believed then that your heart was pledged to the duchess . But now , confound you ! you turn out to be in love in the right place a Jew and everything eligible . "
351628	351640	351642	351642	Deronda	289	" Tell me what convinced you there 's a good fellow , "
351653	351720	351540	351540	he	406	" Do n't ask . Little mother was witness . The upshot is , that Mirah is jealous of the duchess , and the sooner you relieve your mind the better . There ! I 've cleared off a score or two , and may be allowed to swear at you for getting what you deserve which is just the very best luck I know of . "
351721	351728	351730	351730	Deronda	289	" God bless you , Hans ! "
351749	351778	351779	351779	COLERIDGE	734	" All thoughts , all passions , all delights , Whatever stirs this mortal frame , All are but ministers of Love , And feed his sacred flame . "
352590	352602	352603	352603	he	406	" This little room is too close for you , Ezra , "
352611	352661	352662	352662	He	406	" The week 's heat we sometimes get here is worse than the heat in Genoa , where one sits in the shaded coolness of large rooms . You must have a better home now . I shall do as I like with you , being the stronger half . "
352669	352714	352665	352665	Ezra	538	" I am straitened for nothing except breath . But you , who might be in a spacious palace , with the wide green country around you , find this a narrow prison . Nevertheless , I can not say , ' Go . ' "
352715	352729	352731	352731	Deronda	289	" Oh , the country would be a banishment while you are here , "
352758	352804	352805	352805	he	406	" This is the happiest room in the world to me . Besides , I will imagine myself in the East , since I am getting ready to go there some day . Only I will not wear a cravat and a heavy ring there , "
352839	352853	352854	352854	he	406	" I have been wearing my memorable ring ever since I came home , "
352863	352907	352854	352854	he	406	" But I am such a Sybarite that I constantly put it off as a burden when I am doing anything . I understand why the Romans had summer rings if they had them . Now then , I shall get on better . "
353598	353624	353585	353585	she	289	" I only came in to see that Ezra had his new draught . I must go directly to Mrs. Meyrick 's to fetch something . "
353625	353634	353636	353636	Deronda	289	" Pray allow me to walk with you , "
353639	353669	353636	353636	Deronda	289	" I must not tire Ezra any further ; besides my brains are melting . I want to go to Mrs. Meyrick 's : may I go with you ? "
353670	353675	353677	353677	Mirah	289	" Oh , yes , "
353771	353785	353762	353762	he	538	" Pray excuse my dishabille I did not mean you to see it , "
353807	353817	353786	353786	he	538	" Good heavens , where is my ring gone ? "
353853	353860	353835	353835	Mirah	289	" Did you lay it down ? "
353861	353864	353866	353866	Deronda	289	" Yes , "
353936	353942	353928	353928	She	289	" Was my father here ? "
353990	353997	353998	353998	she	289	" You have not found it ? "
354018	354027	354003	354003	He	538	" I perhaps put it in my pocket , "
354041	354054	354035	354035	She	289	" It is not there ? you put it on the table , "
354203	354317	354185	354185	he	538	" Mirah , let me think that he is my father as well as yours that we can have no sorrow , no disgrace , no joy apart . I will rather take your grief to be mine than I would take the brightest joy of another woman . Say you will not reject me say you will take me to share all things with you . Say you will promise to be my wife say it now . I have been in doubt so long I have had to hide my love so long . Say that now and always I may prove to you that I love you with complete love . "
354445	354451	354433	354433	she	289	" worthy of the best ; "
354482	354485	354458	354458	she	289	" yes . "
354533	354541	354527	354527	Mirah	289	" Let us go and comfort Ezra . "
354545	354607	354608	354608	WORDSWORTH	479	" The human nature unto which I felt That I belonged , and reverenced with love , Was not a punctual presence , but a spirit Diffused through time and space , with aid derived Of evidence from monuments , erect , Prostrate , or leaning toward their common rest In earth , the widely scattered wreck sublime Of vanished nations . "
355171	355216	355167	355168	the baronet	7684	" Oh , nonsense , my dear ! depend upon it , Dan will not make a fool of himself . He has large notions about Judaism political views which you ca n't understand . No fear but Dan will keep himself head uppermost . "
355396	355436	355394	355394	himself	209	" If it is an unkind cut to the poor thing meaning Gwendolen , the longer she is without knowing it the better , in her present nervous state . And she will best learn it from Dan himself . "
356780	356786	356789	356789	his	406	" in the Gainsborough style , "
356847	356850	356830	356831	a lady	1406	" Fluctuating Rouge "
357087	357103	357067	357067	he	406	" his metal had given a better ring than he would have sworn to beforehand . "
357194	357203	357205	357205	Deronda	289	" When did you come down , Hans ? "
357225	357394	357183	357183	Gwendolen	289	" Oh , ten days ago ; before the time Sir Hugo fixed . I ran down with Rex Gascoigne and stayed at the rectory a day or two . I 'm up in all the gossip of these parts ; I know the state of the wheelwright 's interior , and have assisted at an infant school examination . Sister Anna , with the good upper lip , escorted me , else I should have been mobbed by three urchins and an idiot , because of my long hair and a general appearance which departs from the Pennicote type of the beautiful . Altogether , the village is idyllic . Its only fault is a dark curate with broad shoulders and broad trousers who ought to have gone into the heavy drapery line . The Gascoignes are perfect besides being related to the Vandyke duchess . I caught a glimpse of her in her black robes at a distance , though she does n't show to visitors . "
357395	357404	357406	357406	Deronda	289	" She was not staying at the rectory ? "
357408	357446	357183	357183	Gwendolen	289	" No ; but I was taken to Offendene to see the old house , and as a consequence I saw the duchess ' family . I suppose you have been there and know all about them ? "
357447	357455	357457	357457	Deronda	289	" Yes , I have been there , "
357461	357503	357183	357183	Gwendolen	289	" A fine old place . An excellent setting for a widow with romantic fortunes . And she seems to have had several romances . I think I have found out that there was one between her and my friend Rex . "
357504	357513	357515	357515	Deronda	289	" Not long before her marriage , then ? "
357520	357540	357515	357515	Deronda	289	" for they had only been a year at Offendene . How came you to know anything of it ? "
357541	357722	357183	357183	Gwendolen	289	" Oh not ignorant of what it is to be a miserable devil , I learn to gloat on the signs of misery in others . I found out that Rex never goes to Offendene , and has never seen the duchess since she came back ; and Miss Gascoigne let fall something in our talk about charade - acting for I went through some of my nonsense to please the young ones something that proved to me that Rex was once hovering about his fair cousin close enough to get singed . I do n't know what was her part in the affair . Perhaps the duke came in and carried her off . That is always the way when an exceptionally worthy young man forms an attachment . I understand now why Gascoigne talks of making the law his mistress and remaining a bachelor . But these are green resolves . Since the duke did not get himself drowned for your sake , it may turn out to be for my friend Rex 's sake . Who knows ? "
357723	357735	357737	357737	Deronda	289	" Is it absolutely necessary that Mrs. Grandcourt should marry again ? "
357761	357765	357767	357767	Hans	406	" You monster ! "
357769	357794	357767	357767	Hans	406	" do you want her to wear weeds for you all her life burn herself in perpetual suttee while you are alive and merry ? "
357849	357860	357862	357862	Hans	406	" Why did n't she fall in love with me ? "
357868	357886	357866	357866	himself	406	" She would have had no rivals . No woman ever wanted to discuss theology with me . "
358088	358158	358085	358085	she	289	" You were afraid of coming to see me , because I was so full of grief and despair the last time . But I am not so today . I have been sorry ever since . I have been making it a reason why I should keep up my hope and be as cheerful as I can , because I would not give you any pain about me . "
358206	358216	358217	358217	he	406	" I am in some trouble to - day , "
358226	358337	358217	358217	he	406	" but it is because I have things to tell you which you will almost think it a want of confidence on my part not to have spoken of before . They are things affecting my own life my own future . I shall seem to have made an ill return to you for the trust you have placed in me never to have given you an idea of events that make great changes for me . But when we have been together we have hardly had time to enter into subjects which at the moment were really less pressing to me than the trials you have been going through . "
358443	358471	358427	358427	She	289	" You never thought of anything but what you could do to help me ; and I was so troublesome . How could you tell me things ? "
358472	358479	358481	358481	Deronda	289	" It will perhaps astonish you , "
358483	358496	358481	358481	Deronda	289	" that I have only quite lately known who were my parents . "
358523	358621	358517	358517	Deronda	289	" The reason why you found me in Italy was that I had gone there to learn that in fact , to meet my mother . It was by her wish that I was brought up in ignorance of my parentage . She parted with me after my father 's death , when I was a little creature . But she is now very ill , and she felt that the secrecy ought not to be any longer maintained . Her chief reason had been that she did not wish me to know I was a Jew . "
358622	358626	358627	358627	Gwendolen	289	" A Jew ! "
358718	358726	358701	358701	she	289	" What difference need that have made ? "
358727	358742	358744	358744	Deronda	289	" It has made a great difference to me that I have known it , "
358789	358813	358780	358780	Gwendolen	289	" I hope there is nothing to make you mind . You are just the same as if you were not a Jew . "
358854	358865	358866	358866	he	7582	" The discovery was far from being painful to me , "
358869	358926	358866	358866	he	7582	" I had been gradually prepared for it , and I was glad of it . I had been prepared for it by becoming intimate with a very remarkable Jew , whose ideas have attracted me so much that I think of devoting the best part of my life to some effort at giving them effect . "
359053	359059	359060	359060	he	7582	" That is an object , "
359067	359098	359060	359060	he	7582	" which will by - and - by force me to leave England for some time for some years . I have purposes which will take me to the East . "
359118	359125	359126	359126	she	289	" But you will come back ? "
359198	359203	359205	359205	Deronda	289	" If I live , "
359210	359210	359205	359205	Deronda	289	"
359246	359254	359255	359255	she	289	" What are you going to do ? "
359264	359277	359255	359255	she	289	" Can I understand the ideas , or am I too ignorant ? "
359278	359300	359302	359302	Deronda	289	" I am going to the East to become better acquainted with the condition of my race in various countries there , "
359326	359430	359311	359311	he	7582	" The idea that I am possessed with is that of restoring a political existence to my people , making them a nation again , giving them a national center , such as the English have , though they too are scattered over the face of the globe . That is a task which presents itself to me as a duty ; I am resolved to begin it , however feebly . I am resolved to devote my life to it . At the least , I may awaken a movement in other minds , such as has been awakened in my own . "
359990	359999	359978	359978	her	289	" Is that all you can tell me ? "
360009	360018	360019	360019	he	7603	" The Jew whom I mentioned just now , "
360032	360068	360028	360028	his	7603	" the remarkable man who has greatly influenced my mind , has not perhaps been totally unheard of by you . He is the brother of Miss Lapidoth , whom you have often heard sing . "
360133	360143	360144	360144	Deronda	289	" He is very ill very near death now , "
360168	360179	360181	360181	Gwendolen	289	" Did she tell you that I went to her ? "
360190	360193	360195	360195	Deronda	289	" No , "
360197	360204	360195	360195	Deronda	289	" I do n't understand you . "
360273	360279	360248	360248	she	289	" But can you marry ? "
360280	360283	360285	360285	Deronda	289	" Yes , "
360293	360300	360285	360285	Deronda	289	" I am going to marry . "
360351	360371	360338	360338	she	289	" I said I should be forsaken . I have been a cruel woman . And I am forsaken . "
360408	360419	360420	360420	he	7603	" I am cruel , too , I am cruel , "
360579	360596	360573	360573	she	289	" I said I said it should be better better with me for having known you . "
360624	360632	360633	360633	he	7603	" We shall not be quite parted , "
360636	360653	360633	360633	he	7603	" I will write to you always , when I can , and you will answer ? "
360663	360668	360657	360657	she	289	" I will try . "
360669	360682	360683	360683	Deronda	289	" I shall be more with you than I used to be , "
360699	360740	360683	360683	Deronda	289	" If we had been much together before , we should have felt our differences more , and seemed to get farther apart . Now we can perhaps never see each other again . But our minds may get nearer . "
360910	360962	360901	360901	she	289	" You have been very good to me . I have deserved nothing . I will try try to live . I shall think of you . What good have I been ? Only harm . Do n't let me be harm to you . It shall be the better for me "
361053	361063	361064	361064	she	903	" Gwendolen , dearest , you look very ill , "
361076	361093	361095	361095	Gwendolen	289	" Yes , mamma . But do n't be afraid . I am going to live , "
361141	361156	361138	361139	her mother	903	" Do n't be afraid . I shall live . I mean to live . "
361183	361211	361172	361172	she	289	" Ah , poor mamma ! You have been sitting up with me . Do n't be unhappy . I shall live . I shall be better . "
362134	362150	362151	362152	The Klesmers	776	" To the bride of our dear Daniel Deronda all blessings . H. and L. M. "
362402	362416	362398	362398	himself	538	" Never mind where I die , so that I am with you . "
362433	362450	362428	362428	he	538	" Do not quit me to - day . I shall die before it is ended . "
362561	362622	362546	362546	he	538	" Death is coming to me as the divine kiss which is both parting and reunion which takes me from your bodily eyes and gives me full presence in your soul . Where thou goest , Daniel , I shall go . Is it not begun ? Have I not breathed my soul into you ? We shall live together . "
362715	362757	362706	362706	Mirah	289	" Nothing is here for tears , nothing to wail Or knock the breast ; no weakness , no contempt , Dispraise or blame ; nothing but well and fair , And what may quiet us in a death so noble . "
