1278	1293	1295	1295	Adam	127	" I sha n't loose him till he promises to let the door alone , "
1297	1304	1306	1306	Seth	128	" Come , Ben , lad , "
1313	1360	1306	1306	Seth	128	" do n't let 's have a quarrel about it . You know Adam will have his way . You may 's well try to turn a waggon in a narrow lane . Say you 'll leave the door alone , and make an end on't . "
1361	1368	1370	1370	Ben	131	" I binna frighted at Adam , "
1372	1393	1370	1370	Ben	131	" but I donna mind sayin ' as I 'll let ' t alone at your askin ' , Seth . "
1394	1405	1407	1407	Adam	127	" Come , that 's wise of you , Ben , "
1448	1458	1459	1459	he	131	" Which was ye thinkin ' on , Seth , "
1462	1478	1459	1459	he	131	" the pretty parson 's face or her sarmunt , when ye forgot the panels ? "

2146	2147	2150	2150	Seth	128	" "
2516	2517	2501	2501	he	505	" "
2523	2543	2501	2501	he	505	" said Sandy Jim , who had paused from his planing to shift his planks while Adam was speaking ; "
2580	2581	2562	2563	my wife	518	" "
2592	2598	2590	2590	Adam	127	" observed Seth , gravely . "
2654	2655	2643	2643	he	505	" "
2674	2679	2672	2672	Seth	128	" said Wiry Ben . "
2736	2737	2738	2738	Ne'er	138	" "
2744	2749	2742	2742	Seth	128	" said Wiry Ben , "
2794	2795	2796	2796	Seth	128	" "
2800	2813	2796	2796	Seth	128	" said Adam , taking no notice of the sarcasm against himself , "
2848	2849	2879	2879	thee	533	" "
2862	2866	2856	2856	thee	533	" said Seth , "
2893	3042	2886	2886	thee	533	" All hands worked on in silence for some minutes , until the church clock began to strike six . Before the first stroke had died away , Sandy Jim had loosed his plane and was reaching his jacket ; Wiry Ben had left a screw half driven in , and thrown his screwdriver into his tool - basket ; Mum Taft , who , true to his name , had kept silence throughout the previous conversation , had flung down his hammer as he was in the act of lifting it ; and Seth , too , had straightened his back , and was putting out his hand towards his paper cap . Adam alone had gone on with his work as if nothing had happened . But observing the cessation of the tools , he looked up , and said , in a tone of indignation , "
3093	3120	3074	3074	they	534	" Seth looked a little conscious , and began to be slower in his preparations for going , but Mum Taft broke silence , and said , "
3164	3165	3152	3152	ye	127	" "
3168	3175	3152	3152	ye	127	" said Adam , still wrathful ; "
3252	3253	3256	3256	Adam	127	" "
3258	3263	3271	3271	ee	537	" exclaimed Wiry Ben ; "
3326	3374	3284	3284	y	127	" With this exit speech , which he considered effective , Wiry Ben shouldered his basket and left the workshop , quickly followed by Mum Taft and Sandy Jim . Seth lingered , and looked wistfully at Adam , as if he expected him to say something . "
3385	3392	3284	3284	y	127	" Adam asked , looking up . "
3444	3445	3441	3441	thee	540	" "
3457	3461	3447	3447	I	0	" said Adam . "
3473	3487	3462	3462	Thee	540	" said Seth rather timidly , as he turned to leave the workshop . "
3498	3605	3490	3490	I	0	" Hitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed , only lifting up his head and watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing . But no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket , and begin to twist his apron round his waist , than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his master 's face with patient expectation . If Gyp had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it , but being destitute of that vehicle for his emotions , he was like many other worthy personages , destined to appear more phlegmatic than nature had made him . "
3618	3650	3616	3616	Gyp	142	" said Adam , with the same gentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth . Gyp jumped and gave a short bark , as much as to say , "
3654	3858	3616	3616	Gyp	142	" Poor fellow , he had not a great range of expression . The basket was the one which on workdays held Adam 's and Seth 's dinner ; and no official , walking in procession , could look more resolutely unconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with his basket , trotting at his master 's heels . On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door , took the key out , and carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard . It was a low house , with smooth grey thatch and buff walls , looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light . The leaded windows were bright and speckless , and the door - stone was as clean as a white boulder at ebb tide . On the door - stone stood a clean old woman , in a dark - striped linen gown , a red kerchief , and a linen cap , talking to some speckled fowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory expectation of cold potatoes or barley . The old woman 's sight seemed to be dim , for she did not recognize Adam till he said , "
3878	3879	3876	3876	you	143	" "
3929	3930	3923	3923	I	0	" "
3946	4426	3910	3910	he	548	" Adam hastened with long strides , Gyp close to his heels , out of the workyard , and along the highroad leading away from the village and down to the valley . As he reached the foot of the slope , an elderly horseman , with his portmanteau strapped behind him , stopped his horse when Adam had passed him , and turned round to have another long look at the stalwart workman in paper cap , leather breeches , and dark - blue worsted stockings . Adam , unconscious of the admiration he was exciting , presently struck across the fields , and now broke out into the tune which had all day long been running in his head : Let all thy converse be sincere , Thy conscience as the noonday clear ; For God 's all - seeing eye surveys Thy secret thoughts , thy works and ways . Chapter II The Preaching About a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance of excitement in the village of Hayslope , and through the whole length of its little street , from the Donnithorne Arms to the churchyard gate , the inhabitants had evidently been drawn out of their houses by something more than the pleasure of lounging in the evening sunshine . The Donnithorne Arms stood at the entrance of the village , and a small farmyard and stackyard which flanked it , indicating that there was a pretty take of land attached to the inn , gave the traveller a promise of good feed for himself and his horse , which might well console him for the ignorance in which the weather - beaten sign left him as to the heraldic bearings of that ancient family , the Donnithornes . Mr. Casson , the landlord , had been for some time standing at the door with his hands in his pockets , balancing himself on his heels and toes and looking towards a piece of unenclosed ground , with a maple in the middle of it , which he knew to be the destination of certain grave - looking men and women whom he had observed passing at intervals . Mr. Casson 's person was by no means of that common type which can be allowed to pass without description . On a front view it appeared to consist principally of two spheres , bearing about the same relation to each other as the earth and the moon : that is to say , the lower sphere might be said , at a rough guess , to be thirteen times larger than the upper which naturally performed the function of a mere satellite and tributary . But here the resemblance ceased , for Mr. Casson 's head was not at all a melancholy - looking satellite nor was it a ' spotty globe , "

4715	4728	4729	4729	he	550	" Why , what 's up in your pretty village , landlord ? "
4735	4744	4729	4729	he	550	" There seems to be quite a stir . "
4745	4774	4776	4777	Mr. Casson	146	" It 's a Methodis ' preaching , sir ; it 's been gev hout as a young woman 's a - going to preach on the Green , "
4792	4807	4776	4777	Mr. Casson	146	" Will you please to step in , sir , an ' tek somethink ? "
4808	4848	4729	4729	he	550	" No , I must be getting on to Rosseter . I only want a drink for my horse . And what does your parson say , I wonder , to a young woman preaching just under his nose ? "
4849	5084	4729	4729	he	550	" Parson Irwine , sir , does n't live here ; he lives at Brox'on , over the hill there . The parsonage here 's a tumble - down place , sir , not fit for gentry to live in . He comes here to preach of a Sunday afternoon , sir , an ' puts up his hoss here . It 's a grey cob , sir , an ' he sets great store by't . He 's allays put up his hoss here , sir , iver since before I he d the Donnithorne Arms . I 'm not this countryman , you may tell by my tongue , sir . They 're cur'ous talkers i ' this country , sir ; the gentry 's hard work to hunderstand 'em . I was brought hup among the gentry , sir , an ' got the turn o ' their tongue when I was a bye . Why , what do you think the folks here says for ' hevn't you ? ' - the gentry , you know , says , ' hevn't you ' - well , the people about here says ' hanna yey . ' It 's what they call the dileck as is spoke hereabout , sir . That 's what I 've heared Squire Donnithorne say many a time ; it 's the dileck , says he . "
5085	5090	5092	5093	the stranger	558	" Aye , aye , "
5097	5160	5092	5093	the stranger	558	" I know it very well . But you 've not got many Methodists about here , surely - in this agricultural spot ? I should have thought there would hardly be such a thing as a Methodist to be found about here . You 're all farmers , are n't you ? The Methodists can seldom lay much hold on THEM . "
5161	5323	4729	4729	he	550	" Why , sir , there 's a pretty lot o ' workmen round about , sir . There 's Mester Burge as owns the timber - yard over there , he underteks a good bit o ' building an ' repairs . An ' there 's the stone - pits not far off . There 's plenty of emply i ' this countryside , sir . An ' there 's a fine batch o ' Methodisses at Treddles'on - that 's the market town about three mile off - you 'll maybe ha ' come through it , sir . There 's pretty nigh a score of 'em on the Green now , as come from there . That 's where our people gets it from , though there 's only two men of 'em in all Hayslope : that 's Will Maskery , the wheelwright , and Seth Bede , a young man as works at the carpenterin ' . "
5324	5336	4729	4729	he	550	" The preacher comes from Treddleston , then , does she ? "
5337	5482	5092	5093	the stranger	558	" Nay , sir , she comes out o ' Stonyshire , pretty nigh thirty mile off . But she 's a - visitin ' hereabout at Mester Poyser 's at the Hall Farm - it 's them barns an ' big walnut - trees , right away to the left , sir . She 's own niece to Poyser 's wife , an ' they 'll be fine an ' vexed at her for making a fool of herself i ' that way . But I 've heared as there 's no holding these Methodisses when the maggit 's once got i ' their head : many of 'em goes stark starin ' mad wi ' their religion . Though this young woman 's quiet enough to look at , by what I can make out ; I 've not seen her myself . "
5483	5535	4729	4729	he	550	" Well , I wish I had time to wait and see her , but I must get on . I 've been out of my way for the last twenty minutes to have a look at that place in the valley . It 's Squire Donnithorne 's , I suppose ? "
5536	5635	4729	4729	he	550	" Yes , sir , that 's Donnithorne Chase , that is . Fine hoaks there , is n't there , sir ? I should know what it is , sir , for I 've lived butler there a - going i ' fifteen year . It 's Captain Donnithorne as is th ' heir , sir - Squire Donnithorne 's grandson . He 'll be comin ' of hage this ' ay-'arvest , sir , an ' we shall hev fine doin 's . He owns all the land about here , sir , Squire Donnithorne does . "
5636	5650	5652	5653	the traveller	5323	" Well , it 's a pretty spot , whoever may own it , "
5659	5732	5652	5653	the traveller	5323	" and one meets some fine strapping fellows about too . I met as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my life , about half an hour ago , before I came up the hill - a carpenter , a tall , broad - shouldered fellow with black hair and black eyes , marching along like a soldier . We want such fellows as he to lick the French . "
5733	5846	5652	5653	the traveller	5323	" Aye , sir , that 's Adam Bede , that is , I 'll be bound - Thias Bede 's son everybody knows him hereabout . He 's an uncommon clever stiddy fellow , an ' wonderful strong . Lord bless you , sir - if you 'll hexcuse me for saying so - he can walk forty mile a - day , an ' lift a matter o ' sixty ston ' . He 's an uncommon favourite wi ' the gentry , sir : Captain Donnithorne and Parson Irwine meks a fine fuss wi ' him . But he 's a little lifted up an ' peppery - like . "
5847	5862	5652	5653	the traveller	5323	" Well , good evening to you , landlord ; I must get on . "
5863	5873	5652	5653	the traveller	5323	" Your servant , sir ; good evenin ' . "

7839	7913	7825	7825	he	668	" how are ye t ' naight ? Are ye coom t ' help groon ? They say folks allays groon when they 're hearkenin ' to th ' Methodys , as if they war bad i ' th ' inside . I mane to groon as loud as your cow did th ' other naight , an ' then the praicher ' ull think I 'm i ' th ' raight way . "
7914	7929	7931	7932	Mr. Casson	146	" I 'd advise you not to be up to no nonsense , Chad , "
7938	7971	7931	7932	Mr. Casson	146	" Poyser would n't like to hear as his wife 's niece was treated any ways disrespectful , for all he may n't be fond of her taking on herself to preach . "
7972	7986	7988	7989	Wiry Ben	131	" Aye , an ' she 's a pleasant - looked un too , "
7991	8044	7988	7989	Wiry Ben	131	" I 'll stick up for the pretty women preachin ' ; I know they 'd persuade me over a deal sooner nor th ' ugly men . I shouldna wonder if I turn Methody afore the night 's out , an ' begin to coort the preacher , like Seth Bede . "
8045	8059	8061	8062	Mr. Casson	146	" Why , Seth 's looking rether too high , I should think , "
8064	8081	8061	8062	Mr. Casson	146	" This woman 's kin would n't like her to demean herself to a common carpenter . "
8082	8085	8087	8087	Ben	131	" Tchu ! "
8095	8200	8087	8087	Ben	131	" what 's folks 's kin got to do wi't ? Not a chip . Poyser 's wife may turn her nose up an ' forget bygones , but this Dinah Morris , they tell me , 's as poor as iver she was - works at a mill , an 's much ado to keep hersen . A strappin ' young carpenter as is a ready - made Methody , like Seth , wouldna be a bad match for her . Why , Poysers make as big a fuss wi ' Adam Bede as if he war a nevvy o ' their own . "
8201	8208	8210	8212	Mr. Joshua Rann	159	" Idle talk ! idle talk ! "
8214	8234	8210	8212	Mr. Joshua Rann	159	" Adam an ' Seth 's two men ; you wunna fit them two wi ' the same last . "
8235	8238	8240	8241	Wiry Ben	131	" Maybe , "
8245	8421	8240	8241	Wiry Ben	131	" but Seth 's the lad for me , though he war a Methody twice o'er . I 'm fair beat wi ' Seth , for I 've been teasin ' him iver sin ' we 've been workin ' together , an ' he bears me no more malice nor a lamb . An ' he 's a stout - hearted feller too , for when we saw the old tree all afire a - comin ' across the fields one night , an ' we thought as it war a boguy , Seth made no more ado , but he up to't as bold as a constable . Why , there he comes out o ' Will Maskery 's ; an ' there 's Will hisself , lookin ' as meek as if he couldna knock a nail o ' the head for fear o ' hurtin't . An ' there 's the pretty preacher woman ! My eye , she 's got her bonnet off . I mun go a bit nearer . "
8667	8681	8622	8622	Methodist	134	" I know you think me a pretty woman , too young to preach "
8706	8717	8718	8718	She	141	" But you must think of me as a saint . "
9076	9081	9082	9083	the stranger	558	" A sweet woman , "
9088	9099	9082	9083	the stranger	558	" but surely nature never meant her for a preacher . "
9125	9129	9101	9101	he	558	" makes up , "
9149	9153	9154	9154	she	141	" Dear friends , "
9163	9171	9172	9172	She	141	" let us pray for a blessing . "
9201	9391	9179	9179	her	141	" Saviour of sinners ! When a poor woman laden with sins , went out to the well to draw water , she found Thee sitting at the well . She knew Thee not ; she had not sought Thee ; her mind was dark ; her life was unholy . But Thou didst speak to her , Thou didst teach her , Thou didst show her that her life lay open before Thee , and yet Thou wast ready to give her that blessing which she had never sought . Jesus , Thou art in the midst of us , and Thou knowest all men : if there is any here like that poor woman - if their minds are dark , their lives unholy - if they have come out not seeking Thee , not desiring to be taught ; deal with them according to the free mercy which Thou didst show to her Speak to them , Lord , open their ears to my message , bring their sins to their minds , and make them thirst for that salvation which Thou art ready to give . "
9511	9539	9540	9541	Dear friends	5465	" Dinah opened her eyes again and paused , looking at the group of villagers , who were now gathered rather more closely on her right hand . "
9543	9553	9570	9571	the clergyman	696	" she began , raising her voice a little , "
9798	9896	9773	9773	I	0	" That man of God was Mr. Wesley , who spent his life in doing what our blessed Lord did - preaching the Gospel to the poor - and he entered into his rest eight years ago . I came to know more about him years after , but I was a foolish thoughtless child then , and I remembered only one thing he told us in his sermon . He told us as ' Gospel ' meant ' good news . ' The Gospel , you know , is what the Bible tells us about God . "
10281	10459	10257	10257	he	135	" But perhaps doubts come into your mind like this : Can God take much notice of us poor people ? Perhaps he only made the world for the great and the wise and the rich . It does n't cost him much to give us our little handful of victual and bit of clothing ; but how do we know he cares for us any more than we care for the worms and things in the garden , so as we rear our carrots and onions ? Will God take care of us when we die ? And has he any comfort for us when we are lame and sick and helpless ? Perhaps , too , he is angry with us ; else why does the blight come , and the bad harvests , and the fever , and all sorts of pain and trouble ? For our life is full of trouble , and if God sends us good , he seems to send bad too . How is it ? How is it ? "
10526	10567	10569	10569	you	5465	" Then Dinah told how the good news had been brought , and how the mind of God towards the poor had been made manifest in the life of Jesus , dwelling on its lowliness and its acts of mercy . "
10575	10580	10569	10569	you	5465	" she went on , "
10718	10772	10704	10704	he	168	" Ah , would n't you love such a man if you saw him - if he were here in this village ? What a kind heart he must have ! What a friend he would be to go to in trouble ! How pleasant it must be to be taught by him . "
11004	11057	10987	10987	he	168	" But let us see a little more about what Jesus came on earth for . Another time he said , ' I came to seek and to save that which was lost ' ; and another time , ' I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance . ' "
11075	11257	11071	11071	you	5465	" Hitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his will by the charm of Dinah 's mellow treble tones , which had a variety of modulation like that of a fine instrument touched with the unconscious skill of musical instinct . The simple things she said seemed like novelties , as a melody strikes us with a new feeling when we hear it sung by the pure voice of a boyish chorister ; the quiet depth of conviction with which she spoke seemed in itself an evidence for the truth of her message . He saw that she had thoroughly arrested her hearers . The villagers had pressed nearer to her , and there was no longer anything but grave attention on all faces . She spoke slowly , though quite fluently , often pausing after a question , or before any transition of ideas . There was no change of attitude , no gesture ; the effect of her speech was produced entirely by the inflections of her voice , and when she came to the question , "
11268	11356	11259	11259	God	135	" she uttered it in such a tone of plaintive appeal that the tears came into some of the hardest eyes . The stranger had ceased to doubt , as he had done at the first glance , that she could fix the attention of her rougher hearers , but still he wondered whether she could have that power of rousing their more violent emotions , which must surely be a necessary seal of her vocation as a Methodist preacher , until she came to the words , "
11362	11748	11749	11751	old Feyther Taft	157	" when there was a great change in her voice and manner . She had made a long pause before the exclamation , and the pause seemed to be filled by agitating thoughts that showed themselves in her features . Her pale face became paler ; the circles under her eyes deepened , as they did when tears half - gather without falling ; and the mild loving eyes took an expression of appalled pity , as if she had suddenly discerned a destroying angel hovering over the heads of the people . Her voice became deep and muffled , but there was still no gesture . Nothing could be less like the ordinary type of the Ranter than Dinah . She was not preaching as she heard others preach , but speaking directly from her own emotions and under the inspiration of her own simple faith . But now she had entered into a new current of feeling . Her manner became less calm , her utterance more rapid and agitated , as she tried to bring home to the people their guilt their wilful darkness , their state of disobedience to God - as she dwelt on the hatefulness of sin , the Divine holiness , and the sufferings of the Saviour , by which a way had been opened for their salvation . At last it seemed as if , in her yearning desire to reclaim the lost sheep , she could not be satisfied by addressing her hearers as a body . She appealed first to one and then to another , beseeching them with tears to turn to God while there was yet time ; painting to them the desolation of their souls , lost in sin , feeding on the husks of this miserable world , far away from God their Father ; and then the love of the Saviour , who was waiting and watching for their return . There was many a responsive sigh and groan from her fellow - Methodists , but the village mind does not easily take fire , and a little smouldering vague anxiety that might easily die out again was the utmost effect Dinah 's preaching had wrought in them at present . Yet no one had retired , except the children and "
11753	12128	11749	11751	old Feyther Taft	157	" who being too deaf to catch many words , had some time ago gone back to his inglenook . Wiry Ben was feeling very uncomfortable , and almost wishing he had not come to hear Dinah ; he thought what she said would haunt him somehow . Yet he could n't help liking to look at her and listen to her , though he dreaded every moment that she would fix her eyes on him and address him in particular . She had already addressed Sandy Jim , who was now holding the baby to relieve his wife , and the big soft - hearted man had rubbed away some tears with his fist , with a confused intention of being a better fellow , going less to the Holly Bush down by the Stone - pits , and cleaning himself more regularly of a Sunday . In front of Sandy Jim stood Chad 's Bess , who had shown an unwonted quietude and fixity of attention ever since Dinah had begun to speak . Not that the matter of the discourse had arrested her at once , for she was lost in a puzzling speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction there could be in life to a young woman who wore a cap like Dinah 's . Giving up this inquiry in despair , she took to studying Dinah 's nose , eyes , mouth , and hair , and wondering whether it was better to have such a sort of pale face as that , or fat red cheeks and round black eyes like her own . But gradually the influence of the general gravity told upon her , and she became conscious of what Dinah was saying . The gentle tones , the loving persuasion , did not touch her , but when the more severe appeals came she began to be frightened . Poor Bessy had always been considered a naughty girl ; she was conscious of it ; if it was necessary to be very good , it was clear she must be in a bad way . She could n't find her places at church as Sally Rann could , she had often been tittering when she "
12130	12168	12375	12375	he	5478	" to Mr. Irwine ; and these religious deficiencies were accompanied by a corresponding slackness in the minor morals , for Bessy belonged unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class of feminine characters with whom you may venture to "
12180	12330	12375	12375	he	5478	" All this she was generally conscious of , and hitherto had not been greatly ashamed of it . But now she began to feel very much as if the constable had come to take her up and carry her before the justice for some undefined offence . She had a terrified sense that God , whom she had always thought of as very far off , was very near to her , and that Jesus was close by looking at her , though she could not see him . For Dinah had that belief in visible manifestations of Jesus , which is common among the Methodists , and she communicated it irresistibly to her hearers : she made them feel that he was among them bodily , and might at any moment show himself to them in some way that would strike anguish and penitence into their hearts . "
12333	12356	12375	12375	he	5478	" she exclaimed , turning to the left , with her eyes fixed on a point above the heads of the people . "
12406	12425	12402	12402	ye	767	" she repeated , in a tone of pleading reproach , turning her eyes on the people again . "
12626	12743	12615	12615	he	5478	" All this he bore for you ! For you - and you never think of him ; for you - and you turn your backs on him ; you do n't care what he has gone through for you . Yet he is not weary of toiling for you : he has risen from the dead , he is praying for you at the right hand of God - ' Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . ' And he is upon this earth too ; he is among us ; he is there close to you now ; I see his wounded body and his look of love . "
12763	12946	12748	12749	Bessy Cranage	163	" Poor child ! Poor child ! He is beseeching you , and you do n't listen to him . You think of ear - rings and fine gowns and caps , and you never think of the Saviour who died to save your precious soul . Your cheeks will be shrivelled one day , your hair will be grey , your poor body will be thin and tottering ! Then you will begin to feel that your soul is not saved ; then you will have to stand before God dressed in your sins , in your evil tempers and vain thoughts . And Jesus , who stands ready to help you now , wo n't help you then ; because you wo n't have him to be your Saviour , he will be your judge . Now he looks at you with love and mercy and says , ' Come to me that you may have life ' ; then he will turn away from you , and say , ' Depart from me into ever - lasting fire ! ' "
12987	12994	12995	12995	Dinah	170	" Ah , poor blind child ! "
12999	13097	12995	12995	Dinah	170	" think if it should happen to you as it once happened to a servant of God in the days of her vanity . SHE thought of her lace caps and saved all her money to buy 'em ; she thought nothing about how she might get a clean heart and a right spirit - she only wanted to have better lace than other girls . And one day when she put her new cap on and looked in the glass , she saw a bleeding Face crowned with thorns . That face is looking at you now "
13111	13176	13100	13100	Dinah	170	" Ah , tear off those follies ! Cast them away from you , as if they were stinging adders . They ARE stinging you - they are poisoning your soul - they are dragging you down into a dark bottomless pit , where you will sink for ever , and for ever , and for ever , further away from light and God . "
13221	13225	13218	13218	he	776	" laid hold on "
13259	13286	13287	13287	he	776	" Folks mun ha ' hoss - shoes , praichin ' or no praichin ' : the divil canna lay hould o ' me for that , "
13395	13399	13400	13400	she	170	" Dear friends , "
13405	13601	13400	13400	she	170	" brothers and sisters , whom I love as those for whom my Lord has died , believe me , I know what this great blessedness is ; and because I know it , I want you to have it too . I am poor , like you : I have to get my living with my hands ; but no lord nor lady can be so happy as me , if they have n't got the love of God in their souls . Think what it is - not to hate anything but sin ; to be full of love to every creature ; to be frightened at nothing ; to be sure that all things will turn to good ; not to mind pain , because it is our Father 's will ; to know that nothing - no , not if the earth was to be burnt up , or the waters come and drown us - nothing could part us from God who loves us , and who fills our souls with peace and joy , because we are sure that whatever he wills is holy , just , and good . "
13665	13783	13659	13659	his	135	" Its streams the whole creation reach , So plenteous is the store ; Enough for all , enough for each , Enough for evermore . Dinah had been speaking at least an hour , and the reddening light of the parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her closing words . The stranger , who had been interested in the course of her sermon as if it had been the development of a drama - for there is this sort of fascination in all sincere unpremeditated eloquence , which opens to one the inward drama of the speaker 's emotions - now turned his horse aside and pursued his way , while Dinah said , "
13792	14002	14003	14003	She	787	" ; and as he was still winding down the slope , the voices of the Methodists reached him , rising and falling in that strange blending of exultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence of a hymn . Chapter III After the Preaching IN less than an hour from that time , Seth Bede was walking by Dinah 's side along the hedgerow - path that skirted the pastures and green corn - fields which lay between the village and the Hall Farm . Dinah had taken off her little Quaker bonnet again , and was holding it in her hands that she might have a freer enjoyment of the cool evening twilight , and Seth could see the expression of her face quite clearly as he walked by her side , timidly revolving something he wanted to say to her . It was an expression of unconscious placid gravity - of absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment or with her own personality - an expression that is most of all discouraging to a lover . Her very walk was discouraging : it had that quiet elasticity that asks for no support . Seth felt this dimly ; he said to himself , "
14017	14042	14003	14003	She	787	" and the words he had been summoning rushed back again before they had reached his lips . But another thought gave him courage : "
14062	14128	14129	14129	You	787	" They had been silent for many minutes now , since they had done talking about Bessy Cranage ; Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Seth 's presence , and her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of their being only a few minutes ' walk from the yard - gates of the Hall Farm at last gave Seth courage to speak . "
14147	14148	14145	14145	Dinah	170	" "
14151	14157	14145	14145	Dinah	170	" said Dinah , quietly . "
14330	14331	14313	14313	I	0	" "
14336	14340	14332	14332	God	135	" said Seth . "
14814	14922	14923	14924	Seth Bede	128	" When Seth had once begun to urge his suit , he went on earnestly and almost hurriedly , lest Dinah should speak some decisive word before he had poured forth all the arguments he had prepared . His cheeks became flushed as he went on his mild grey eyes filled with tears , and his voice trembled as he spoke the last sentence . They had reached one of those very narrow passes between two tall stones , which performed the office of a stile in Loamshire , and Dinah paused as she turned towards Seth and said , in her tender but calm treble notes , "
15432	15462	15465	15465	Dinah	170	" Seth was unable to reply , and they walked on in silence . At last , as they were nearly at the yard - gate , he said , "
15679	15680	15654	15654	you	170	" "
15756	15757	15759	15759	you	170	" "
15780	15781	15759	15759	you	170	" "
15804	15818	15796	15796	You	170	" They had now reached the yard - gate , and Seth said , "
15830	15847	15825	15825	Dinah	170	" He paused and hesitated after she had given him her hand , and then said , "
15870	15871	15866	15868	a new leading	850	" "
15928	16612	16650	16650	Seth	128	" Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes , and then passed through the gate , while Seth turned away to walk lingeringly home . But instead of taking the direct road , he chose to turn back along the fields through which he and Dinah had already passed ; and I think his blue linen handkerchief was very wet with tears long before he had made up his mind that it was time for him to set his face steadily homewards . He was but three - and - twenty , and had only just learned what it is to love - to love with that adoration which a young man gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater and better than himself . Love of this sort is hardly distinguishable from religious feeling . What deep and worthy love is so , whether of woman or child , or art or music . Our caresses , our tender words , our still rapture under the influence of autumn sunsets , or pillared vistas , or calm majestic statues , or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness that they are mere waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love and beauty ; our emotion in its keenest moment passes from expression into silence , our love at its highest flood rushes beyond its object and loses itself in the sense of divine mystery . And this blessed gift of venerating love has been given to too many humble craftsmen since the world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have existed in the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago , while there was yet a lingering after - glow from the time when Wesley and his fellow - labourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges , after exhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor . That afterglow has long faded away ; and the picture we are apt to make of Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills , or the deep shade of broad - leaved sycamores , where a crowd of rough men and weary - hearted women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary culture , which linked their thoughts with the past , lifted their imagination above the sordid details of their own narrow lives , and suffused their souls with the sense of a pitying , loving , infinite Presence , sweet as summer to the houseless needy . It is too possible that to some of my readers Methodism may mean nothing more than low - pitched gables up dingy streets , sleek grocers , sponging preachers , and hypocritical jargon - elements which are regarded as an exhaustive analysis of Methodism in many fashionable quarters . That would be a pity ; for I can not pretend that Seth and Dinah were anything else than Methodists - not indeed of that modern type which reads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes , but of a very old - fashioned kind . They believed in present miracles , in instantaneous conversions , in revelations by dreams and visions ; they drew lots , and sought for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at hazard ; having a literal way of interpreting the Scriptures , which is not at all sanctioned by approved commentators ; and it is impossible for me to represent their diction as correct , or their instruction as liberal . Still - if I have read religious history aright - faith , hope , and charity have not always been found in a direct ratio with a sensibility to the three concords , and it is possible - thank Heaven ! - to have very erroneous theories and very sublime feelings . The raw bacon which clumsy Molly spares from her own scanty store that she may carry it to her neighbour 's child to ' stop the fits , "

17424	17447	17449	17449	Adam	127	" Aye , aye , Seth 's at no harm , mother , thee mayst be sure . But where 's father ? "
17474	17497	17515	17515	she	268	" Has n't he done the coffin for Tholer ? There 's the stuff standing just as I left it this morning . "
17498	17503	17505	17505	Lisbeth	268	" Done the coffin ? "
17523	17557	17515	17515	she	268	" Eh , my lad , he went aff to Treddles'on this forenoon , an 's niver come back . I doubt he 's got to th ' ' Waggin Overthrow ' again . "

17724	17728	17730	17730	Adam	127	" Let be ! "
17748	17800	17730	17730	Adam	127	" It 's fine talking about having supper when here 's a coffin promised to be ready at Brox'on by seven o'clock to - morrow morning , and ought to ha ' been there now , and not a nail struck yet . My throat 's too full to swallow victuals . "
17801	17811	17813	17813	Lisbeth	268	" Why , thee canstna get the coffin ready , "
17815	17832	17813	17813	Lisbeth	268	" Thee't work thyself to death . It ' ud take thee all night to do't . "
17833	17898	17730	17730	Adam	127	" What signifies how long it takes me ? Is n't the coffin promised ? Can they bury the man without a coffin ? I 'd work my right hand off sooner than deceive people with lies i ' that way . It makes me mad to think on't . I shall overrun these doings before long . I 've stood enough of 'em . "
17986	18233	17980	17980	she	268	" Nay , my lad , my lad , thee wouldstna go away an ' break thy mother 's heart , an ' leave thy feyther to ruin . Thee wouldstna ha ' 'em carry me to th ' churchyard , an ' thee not to follow me . I shanna rest i ' my grave if I donna see thee at th ' last ; an ' how 's they to let thee know as I 'm a - dyin ' , if thee't gone a - workin ' i ' distant parts , an ' Seth belike gone arter thee , and thy feyther not able to hold a pen for 's hand shakin ' , besides not knowin ' where thee art ? Thee mun forgie thy feyther - thee munna be so bitter again ' him . He war a good feyther to thee afore he took to th ' drink . He 's a clever workman , an ' taught thee thy trade , remember , an 's niver gen me a blow nor so much as an ill word - no , not even in 's drink . Thee wouldstna ha ' ' m go to the workhus - thy own feyther - an ' him as was a fine - growed man an ' handy at everythin ' amost as thee art thysen , five - an'-twenty ' ear ago , when thee wast a baby at the breast . "
18275	18368	18270	18270	Adam	127	" Now , Mother , do n't cry and talk so . Have n't I got enough to vex me without that ? What 's th ' use o ' telling me things as I only think too much on every day ? If I didna think on 'em , why should I do as I do , for the sake o ' keeping things together here ? But I hate to be talking where it 's no use : I like to keep my breath for doing i'stead o ' talking . "
18369	18438	18270	18270	Adam	127	" I know thee dost things as nobody else ' ud do , my lad . But thee't allays so hard upo ' thy feyther , Adam . Thee think'st nothing too much to do for Seth : thee snapp'st me up if iver I find faut wi ' th ' lad . But thee't so angered wi ' thy feyther , more nor wi ' anybody else . "
18439	18551	18552	18552	Lisbeth	268	" That 's better than speaking soft and letting things go the wrong way , I reckon , is n't it ? If I was n't sharp with him he 'd sell every bit o ' stuff i ' th ' yard and spend it on drink . I know there 's a duty to be done by my father , but it is n't my duty to encourage him in running headlong to ruin . And what has Seth got to do with it ? The lad does no harm as I know of . But leave me alone , Mother , and let me get on with the work . "
18745	18754	18755	18755	Adam	127	" Go , Gyp ; go , lad ! "
18991	18996	18988	18988	he	127	" Leave me alone , "

19164	19183	19110	19110	he	127	" Nay , I 'll bide till Seth comes . He wonna be long now , I reckon . "
19229	19234	19235	19235	he	128	" Why , Mother , "
19238	19249	19235	19235	he	128	" how is it as Father 's working so late ? "
19250	19304	19311	19311	she	268	" It 's none o ' thy feyther as is a - workin ' - thee might know that well anoof if thy head warna full o ' chapellin ' - it 's thy brother as does iverything , for there 's niver nobody else i ' th ' way to do nothin' . "
19379	19394	19364	19364	Seth	128	" Addy , how 's this ? What ! Father 's forgot the coffin ? "
19395	19412	19414	19414	Adam	127	" Aye , lad , th ' old tale ; but I shall get it done , "
19430	19444	19414	19414	Adam	127	" Why , what 's the matter with thee ? Thee't in trouble . "
19464	19494	19414	19414	Adam	127	" Yes , Addy , but it 's what must be borne , and ca n't be helped . Why , thee'st never been to the school , then ? "
19495	19505	19507	19507	Adam	127	" School ? No , that screw can wait , "
19513	19528	19530	19530	Seth	128	" Let me take my turn now , and do thee go to bed , "
19532	19590	19530	19530	Seth	128	" No , lad , I 'd rather go on , now I 'm in harness . Thee't help me to carry it to Brox'on when it 's done . I 'll call thee up at sunrise . Go and eat thy supper , and shut the door so as I may n't hear Mother 's talk . "
19628	19645	19647	19647	Lisbeth	268	" Adam 's niver touched a bit o ' victual sin ' home he 's come , "

19886	19897	19899	19899	Seth	128	" Come , Mother , donna grieve thyself in vain , "
19906	20060	19899	19899	Seth	128	" Thee'st not half so good reason to think as Adam ' ull go away as to think he 'll stay with thee . He may say such a thing when he 's in wrath - and he 's got excuse for being wrathful sometimes - but his heart ' ud never let him go . Think how he 's stood by us all when it 's been none so easy - paying his savings to free me from going for a soldier , an ' turnin ' his earnin 's into wood for father , when he 's got plenty o ' uses for his money , and many a young man like him ' ud ha ' been married and settled before now . He 'll never turn round and knock down his own work , and forsake them as it 's been the labour of his life to stand by . "
20061	20071	20073	20073	Lisbeth	268	" Donna talk to me about 's marr'in ' , "
20078	20207	20073	20073	Lisbeth	268	" He 's set 's heart on that Hetty Sorrel , as ' ull niver save a penny , an ' ' ull toss up her head at 's old mother . An ' to think as he might ha ' Mary Burge , an ' be took partners , an ' be a big man wi ' workmen under him , like Mester Burge - Dolly 's told me so o'er and o'er again - if it warna as he 's set 's heart on that bit of a wench , as is o ' no more use nor the gillyflower on the wall . An ' he so wise at bookin ' an ' figurin ' , an ' not to know no better nor that ! "
20208	20310	19770	19770	she	268	" But , Mother , thee know'st we canna love just where other folks ' ud have us . There 's nobody but God can control the heart of man . I could ha ' wished myself as Adam could ha ' made another choice , but I would n't reproach him for what he ca n't help . And I 'm not sure but what he tries to o'ercome it . But it 's a matter as he does n't like to be spoke to about , and I can only pray to the Lord to bless and direct him . "
20311	20375	19770	19770	she	268	" Aye , thee't allays ready enough at prayin ' , but I donna see as thee gets much wi ' thy prayin ' . Thee wotna get double earnin 's o ' this side Yule . Th ' Methodies 'll niver make thee half the man thy brother is , for all they 're a - makin ' a preacher on thee . "
20376	20387	20389	20389	Seth	128	" It 's partly truth thee speak'st there , Mother , "
20393	20492	20389	20389	Seth	128	" Adam 's far before me , an 's done more for me than I can ever do for him . God distributes talents to every man according as He sees good . But thee mustna undervally prayer . Prayer mayna bring money , but it brings us what no money can buy - a power to keep from sin and be content with God 's will , whatever He may please to send . If thee wouldst pray to God to help thee , and trust in His goodness , thee wouldstna be so uneasy about things . "
20493	20605	19770	19770	she	268	" Unaisy ? I 'm i ' th ' right on't to be unaisy . It 's well seen on THEE what it is niver to be unaisy . Thee't gi ' away all thy earnin 's , an ' niver be unaisy as thee'st nothin' laid up again ' a rainy day . If Adam had been as aisy as thee , he 'd niver ha ' had no money to pay for thee . Take no thought for the morrow - take no thought - that 's what thee't allays sayin ' ; an ' what comes on't ? Why , as Adam has to take thought for thee . "
20606	20618	20620	20620	Seth	128	" Those are the words o ' the Bible , Mother , "
20622	20664	20620	20620	Seth	128	" They do n't mean as we should be idle . They mean we should n't be overanxious and worreting ourselves about what 'll happen to - morrow , but do our duty and leave the rest to God 's will . "
20665	20798	19770	19770	she	268	" Aye , aye , that 's the way wi ' thee : thee allays makes a peck o ' thy own words out o ' a pint o ' the Bible 's . I donna see how thee't to know as ' take no thought for the morrow ' means all that . An ' when the Bible 's such a big book , an ' thee canst read all thro't , an ' ha ' the pick o ' the texes , I canna think why thee dostna pick better words as donna mean so much more nor they say . Adam doesna pick a that'n ; I can understan ' the tex as he 's allays a - sayin ' , ' God helps them as helps theirsens . ' "
20799	20804	20806	20806	Seth	128	" Nay , Mother , "
20808	20869	20806	20806	Seth	128	" that 's no text o ' the Bible . It comes out of a book as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddles'on . It was wrote by a knowing man , but overworldly , I doubt . However , that saying 's partly true ; for the Bible tells us we must be workers together with God . "
20870	20945	19770	19770	she	268	" Well , how'm I to know ? It sounds like a tex . But what 's th ' matter wi ' th ' lad ? Thee't hardly atin ' a bit o ' supper . Dostna mean to ha ' no more nor that bit o ' oat - cake ? An ' thee lookst as white as a flick o ' new bacon . What 's th ' matter wi ' thee ? "
20946	20981	21052	21052	he	128	" Nothing to mind about , Mother ; I 'm not hungry . I 'll just look in at Adam again , and see if he 'll let me go on with the coffin . "
20982	20992	20994	20994	Lisbeth	268	" Ha ' a drop o ' warm broth ? "
21005	21007	21052	21052	he	128	" nattering "
21010	21025	21052	21052	he	128	" I 'll set two - three sticks a - light in a minute . "
21026	21038	21040	21040	Seth	128	" Nay , Mother , thank thee ; thee't very good , "
21056	21087	21052	21052	he	128	" Let me pray a bit with thee for Father , and Adam , and all of us - it 'll comfort thee , happen , more than thee thinkst . "
21088	21100	21052	21052	he	128	" Well , I 've nothin' to say again ' it . "
21250	21269	21242	21242	Seth	128	" Wilt only lie down for an hour or two , and let me go on the while ? "
21270	21287	21242	21242	Seth	128	" No , Seth , no . Make Mother go to bed , and go thyself . "
21371	21392	21354	21354	She	268	" Thee canst pick a bit while thee't workin ' . I 'll bring thee another drop o ' water . "
21393	21400	21402	21402	Adam	127	" Aye , Mother , do , "
21406	21413	21402	21402	Adam	127	" I 'm getting very thirsty . "
21680	21691	21693	21693	Adam	127	" So it will go on , worsening and worsening , "
21695	21717	21693	21693	Adam	127	" there 's no slipping uphill again , and no standing still when once you ' ve begun to slip down . "
21764	21776	21755	21756	his father	668	" the little chap had an uncommon notion o ' carpentering . "

22099	22102	22103	22103	Adam	127	" No ! "
22111	22381	22103	22103	Adam	127	" that must never happen again . It ' ud make a poor balance when my doings are cast up at the last , if my poor old mother stood o ' the wrong side . My back 's broad enough and strong enough ; I should be no better than a coward to go away and leave the troubles to be borne by them as are n't half so able . ' They that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak , and not to please themselves . ' There 's a text wants no candle to show't ; it shines by its own light . It 's plain enough you get into the wrong road i ' this life if you run after this and that only for the sake o ' making things easy and pleasant to yourself . A pig may poke his nose into the trough and think o ' nothing outside it ; but if you 've got a man 's heart and soul in you , you ca n't be easy a - making your own bed an ' leaving the rest to lie on the stones . Nay , nay , I 'll never slip my neck out o ' the yoke , and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns . Father 's a sore cross to me , an 's likely to be for many a long year to come . What then ? I 've got th ' health , and the limbs , and the sperrit to bear it . "
22678	22694	22668	22668	he	127	" Eh , it 's a big mystery ; thee know'st but little about it . "
22732	22757	22727	22727	he	127	" May be ; but the bearing o ' the roof and walls was n't right , else it would n't ha ' come down "

23078	23180	23065	23065	Adam	127	" I wo n't open the door again . It 's no use staring about to catch sight of a sound . Maybe there 's a world about us as we ca n't see , but th ' ear 's quicker than the eye and catches a sound from't now and then . Some people think they get a sight on't too , but they 're mostly folks whose eyes are not much use to 'em at anything else . For my part , I think it 's better to see when your perpendicular 's true than to see a ghost . "
23270	23275	23277	23277	Adam	127	" Now , lad , "
23285	23327	23277	23277	Adam	127	" the coffin 's done , and we can take it over to Brox'on , and be back again before half after six . I 'll take a mouthful o ' oat - cake , and then we 'll be off . "
23557	23627	23553	23553	himself	127	" Seth , lad , if Father is n't come home by the time we 've had our breakfast , I think it 'll be as well for thee to go over to Treddles'on and look after him , and thee canst get me the brass wire I want . Never mind about losing an hour at thy work ; we can make that up . What dost say ? "
23628	23633	23635	23635	Seth	128	" I 'm willing , "
23637	23704	23635	23635	Seth	128	" But see what clouds have gathered since we set out . I 'm thinking we shall have more rain . It 'll be a sore time for th ' haymaking if the meadows are flooded again . The brook 's fine and full now : another day 's rain ' ud cover the plank , and we should have to go round by the road . "
23724	23735	23737	23737	Seth	128	" Why , what 's that sticking against the willow ? "
23938	23945	23946	23946	he	127	" I 'll run to Mother , "
23954	23965	23946	23946	he	127	" I 'll be back to thee in a minute . "
24017	24028	24029	24029	she	268	" The lads ' ull be fine an ' hungry , "
24042	24186	24029	24029	she	268	" It 's a good step to Brox'on , an ' it 's hungry air o'er the hill - wi ' that heavy coffin too . Eh ! It 's heavier now , wi ' poor Bob Tholer in't . Howiver , I 've made a drap more porridge nor common this mornin ' . The feyther ' ull happen come in arter a bit . Not as he 'll ate much porridge . He swallers sixpenn'orth o ' ale , an ' saves a hap'orth o ' por - ridge - that 's his way o ' layin ' by money , as I 've told him many a time , an ' am likely to tell him again afore the day 's out . Eh , poor mon , he takes it quiet enough ; there 's no denyin ' that . "

24237	24242	24243	24243	Adam	127	" Hush , Mother , "
24249	24291	24243	24243	Adam	127	" do n't be frightened . Father 's tumbled into the water . Belike we may bring him round again . Seth and me are going to carry him in . Get a blanket and make it hot as the fire . "
25159	25170	25178	25178	she	1022	" There , Dauphin , tell me what that is ! "
25189	25203	25178	25178	she	1022	" I should be sorry to utter a word disagreeable to your feelings . "
25204	25258	25178	25178	she	1022	" Ah , you witch - mother , you sorceress ! How is a Christian man to win a game off you ? I should have sprinkled the board with holy water before we began . You 've not won that game by fair means , now , so do n't pretend it . "
25259	25312	25178	25178	she	1022	" Yes , yes , that 's what the beaten have always said of great conquerors . But see , there 's the sunshine falling on the board , to show you more clearly what a foolish move you made with that pawn . Come , shall I give you another chance ? "
25313	25349	25178	25178	she	1022	" No , Mother , I shall leave you to your own conscience , now it 's clearing up . We must go and plash up the mud a little , mus'n't we , Juno ? "
25382	25408	25370	25370	her	1031	" But I must go upstairs first and see Anne . I was called away to Tholer 's funeral just when I was going before . "
25409	25437	25354	25367	the brown setter , who had jumped up at the sound of the voices	1031	" It 's of no use , child ; she ca n't speak to you . Kate says she has one of her worst headaches this morning . "
25438	25463	25370	25370	her	1031	" Oh , she likes me to go and see her just the same ; she 's never too ill to care about that . "
25576	25597	25567	25568	the servant	1038	" If you please , sir , Joshua Rann wishes to speak with you , if you are at liberty . "
25598	25606	25608	25609	Mrs. Irwine	200	" Let him be shown in here , "
25616	25644	25608	25609	Mrs. Irwine	200	" I always like to hear what Mr. Rann has got to say . His shoes will be dirty , but see that he wipes them Carroll . "
25729	25773	25724	25724	his	173	" Well , Joshua , anything the matter at Hayslope , that you 've come over this damp morning ? Sit down , sit down . Never mind the dogs ; give them a friendly kick . Here , Pug , you rascal ! "
25887	25892	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Thank Your Reverence , "
25915	25957	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" I 'll stand , if you please , as more becoming . I hope I see you an ' Mrs. Irwine well , an ' Miss Irwine - an ' Miss Anne , I hope 's as well as usual . "
25958	25987	28017	28018	Mr. Irwine	173	" Yes , Joshua , thank you . You see how blooming my mother looks . She beats us younger people hollow . But what 's the matter ? "
25988	26259	28017	28018	Mr. Irwine	173	" Why , sir , I had to come to Brox'on to deliver some work , and I thought it but right to call and let you know the goins - on as there 's been i ' the village , such as I hanna seen i ' my time , and I 've lived in it man and boy sixty year come St. Thomas , and collected th ' Easter dues for Mr. Blick before Your Reverence come into the parish , and been at the ringin ' o ' every bell , and the diggin ' o ' every grave , and sung i ' the choir long afore Bartle Massey come from nobody knows where , wi ' his counter - singin ' and fine anthems , as puts everybody out but himself - one takin ' it up after another like sheep a - bleatin ' i ' th ' fold . I know what belongs to bein ' a parish clerk , and I know as I should be wantin ' i ' respect to Your Reverence , an ' church , an ' king , if I was t ' allow such goins - on wi'out speakin ' . I was took by surprise , an ' knowed nothin' on it beforehand , an ' I was so flustered , I was clean as if I 'd lost my tools . I hanna slep ' more nor four hour this night as is past an ' gone ; an ' then it was nothin' but nightmare , as tired me worse nor wakin ' . "
26260	26283	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Why , what in the world is the matter , Joshua ? Have the thieves been at the church lead again ? "
26284	26454	28017	28018	Mr. Irwine	173	" Thieves ! No , sir - an ' yet , as I may say , it is thieves , an ' a - thievin ' the church , too . It 's the Methodisses as is like to get th ' upper hand i ' th ' parish , if Your Reverence an ' His Honour , Squire Donnithorne , doesna think well to say the word an ' forbid it . Not as I 'm a - dictatin ' to you , sir ; I 'm not forgettin ' myself so far as to be wise above my betters . Howiver , whether I 'm wise or no , that 's neither here nor there , but what I 've got to say I say - as the young Methodis woman as is at Mester Poyser 's was a - preachin ' an ' a - prayin ' on the Green last night , as sure as I 'm a - stannin ' afore Your Reverence now . "
26455	26461	26463	26464	Mr. Irwine	173	" Preaching on the Green ! "
26472	26517	28017	28018	Mr. Irwine	173	" What , that pale pretty young woman I 've seen at Poyser 's ? I saw she was a Methodist , or Quaker , or something of that sort , by her dress , but I did n't know she was a preacher . "
26518	26530	26532	26533	Mr. Rann	159	" It 's a true word as I say , sir , "
26553	26586	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" She preached on the Green last night ; an ' she 's laid hold of Chad 's Bess , as the girl 's been i ' fits welly iver sin ' . "
26587	26616	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Well , Bessy Cranage is a hearty - looking lass ; I daresay she 'll come round again , Joshua . Did anybody else go into fits ? "
26617	26833	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" No , sir , I canna say as they did . But there 's no knowin ' what 'll come , if we 're t ' have such preachin 's as that a - goin' on ivery week - there 'll be no livin ' i ' th ' village . For them Methodisses make folks believe as if they take a mug o ' drink extry , an ' make theirselves a bit comfortable , they 'll have to go to hell for't as sure as they 're born . I 'm not a tipplin ' man nor a drunkard - nobody can say it on me - but I like a extry quart at Easter or Christmas time , as is nat'ral when we 're goin' the rounds a - singin ' , an ' folks offer't you for nothin' ; or when I 'm a - collectin ' the dues ; an ' I like a pint wi ' my pipe , an ' a neighbourly chat at Mester Casson 's now an ' then , for I was brought up i ' the Church , thank God , an ' ha ' been a parish clerk this two - an'-thirty year : I should know what the church religion is . "
26834	26852	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Well , what 's your advice , Joshua ? What do you think should be done ? "
26853	27067	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Well , Your Reverence , I 'm not for takin ' any measures again ' the young woman . She 's well enough if she 'd let alone preachin ' ; an ' I hear as she 's a - goin' away back to her own country soon . She 's Mr. Poyser 's own niece , an ' I donna wish to say what 's anyways disrespectful o ' th ' family at th ' Hall Farm , as I 've measured for shoes , little an ' big , welly iver sin ' I 've been a shoemaker . But there 's that Will Maskery , sir as is the rampageousest Methodis as can be , an ' I make no doubt it was him as stirred up th ' young woman to preach last night , an ' he 'll be a - bringin ' other folks to preach from Treddles'on , if his comb is n't cut a bit ; an ' I think as he should be let know as he isna t ' have the makin ' an ' mendin ' o ' church carts an ' implemen 's , let alone stayin ' i ' that house an ' yard as is Squire Donnithorne 's . "
27068	27153	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Well , but you say yourself , Joshua , that you never knew any one come to preach on the Green before ; why should you think they 'll come again ? The Methodists do n't come to preach in little villages like Hayslope , where there 's only a handful of labourers , too tired to listen to them . They might almost as well go and preach on the Binton Hills . Will Maskery is no preacher himself , I think . "
27154	27292	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Nay , sir , he 's no gift at stringin ' the words together wi'out book ; he 'd be stuck fast like a cow i ' wet clay . But he 's got tongue enough to speak disrespectful about 's neebors , for he said as I was a blind Pharisee - a - usin ' the Bible i ' that way to find nick - names for folks as are his elders an ' betters ! - and what 's worse , he 's been heard to say very unbecomin ' words about Your Reverence ; for I could bring them as ' ud swear as he called you a ' dumb dog , ' an ' a ' idle shepherd . ' You 'll forgi'e me for sayin ' such things over again . "
27293	27518	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Better not , better not , Joshua . Let evil words die as soon as they 're spoken . Will Maskery might be a great deal worse fellow than he is . He used to be a wild drunken rascal , neglecting his work and beating his wife , they told me ; now he 's thrifty and decent , and he and his wife look comfortable together . If you can bring me any proof that he interferes with his neighbours and creates any disturbance , I shall think it my duty as a clergyman and a magistrate to interfere . But it would n't become wise people like you and me to be making a fuss about trifles , as if we thought the Church was in danger because Will Maskery lets his tongue wag rather foolishly , or a young woman talks in a serious way to a handful of people on the Green . We must ' live and let live , ' Joshua , in religion as well as in other things . You go on doing your duty , as parish clerk and sexton , as well as you 've always done it , and making those capital thick boots for your neighbours , and things wo n't go far wrong in Hayslope , depend upon it . "
27519	27553	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Your Reverence is very good to say so ; an ' I 'm sensable as , you not livin ' i ' the parish , there 's more upo ' my shoulders . "
27554	27753	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" To be sure ; and you must mind and not lower the Church in people 's eyes by seeming to be frightened about it for a little thing , Joshua . I shall trust to your good sense , now to take no notice at all of what Will Maskery says , either about you or me . You and your neighbours can go on taking your pot of beer soberly , when you 've done your day 's work , like good churchmen ; and if Will Maskery does n't like to join you , but to go to a prayer - meeting at Treddleston instead , let him ; that 's no business of yours , so long as he does n't hinder you from doing what you like . And as to people saying a few idle words about us , we must not mind that , any more than the old church - steeple minds the rooks cawing about it . Will Maskery comes to church every Sunday afternoon , and does his wheelwright 's business steadily in the weekdays , and as long as he does that he must be let alone . "
27754	27848	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Ah , sir , but when he comes to church , he sits an ' shakes his head , an ' looks as sour an ' as coxy when we 're a - singin ' as I should like to fetch him a rap across the jowl - God forgi'e me - an ' Mrs. Irwine , an ' Your Reverence too , for speakin ' so afore you . An ' he said as our Christmas singin ' was no better nor the cracklin ' o ' thorns under a pot . "
27849	27903	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Well , he 's got a bad ear for music , Joshua . When people have wooden heads , you know , it ca n't be helped . He wo n't bring the other people in Hayslope round to his opinion , while you go on singing as well as you do . "
27904	27994	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" Yes , sir , but it turns a man 's stomach t ' hear the Scripture misused i ' that way . I know as much o ' the words o ' the Bible as he does , an ' could say the Psalms right through i ' my sleep if you was to pinch me ; but I know better nor to take 'em to say my own say wi ' . I might as well take the Sacriment - cup home and use it at meals . "
27995	28015	25894	25895	Mr. Rann	159	" That 's a very sensible remark of yours , Joshua ; but , as I said before - - "
28074	28083	28059	28063	some one who paused there	1048	" Godson Arthur - may he come in ? "
28084	28093	28094	28095	Mrs. Irwine	200	" Come in , come in , godson ! "
28148	28154	28189	28191	The young gentleman	1055	" How are you 's ? "
28203	28208	28193	28194	Arthur Donnithorne	211	" the young squire , "
28209	28213	28232	28233	the Hayslope	11	" the heir , "
28215	28219	28220	28220	He	1055	" the captain . "
28396	28413	28392	28393	Captain Donnithorne	154	" But do n't let me interrupt Joshua 's business - he has something to say . "
28414	28422	28424	28424	Joshua	159	" Humbly begging Your Honour 's pardon , "
28429	28452	28424	28424	Joshua	159	" there was one thing I had to say to His Reverence as other things had drove out o ' my head . "
28453	28462	28464	28465	Mr. Irwine	173	" Out with it , Joshua , quickly ! "
28467	28509	28464	28465	Mr. Irwine	173	" Belike , sir , you havena heared as Thias Bede 's dead - drownded this morning , or more like overnight , i ' the Willow Brook , again ' the bridge right i ' front o ' the house . "
28510	28513	28515	28517	both the gentlemen	1068	" Ah ! "
28533	28696	28523	28523	they	1068	" An ' Seth Bede 's been to me this morning to say he wished me to tell Your Reverence as his brother Adam begged of you particular t ' allow his father 's grave to be dug by the White Thorn , because his mother 's set her heart on it , on account of a dream as she had ; an ' they 'd ha ' come theirselves to ask you , but they 've so much to see after with the crowner , an ' that ; an ' their mother 's took on so , an ' wants 'em to make sure o ' the spot for fear somebody else should take it . An ' if Your Reverence sees well and good , I 'll send my boy to tell 'em as soon as I get home ; an ' that 's why I make bold to trouble you wi ' it , His Honour being present . "
28697	28764	28464	28465	Mr. Irwine	173	" To be sure , Joshua , to be sure , they shall have it . I 'll ride round to Adam myself , and see him . Send your boy , however , to say they shall have the grave , lest anything should happen to detain me . And now , good morning , Joshua ; go into the kitchen and have some ale . "
28765	28770	28772	28773	Mr. Irwine	173	" Poor old Thias ! "
28780	28836	28772	28773	Mr. Irwine	173	" I 'm afraid the drink helped the brook to drown him . I should have been glad for the load to have been taken off my friend Adam 's shoulders in a less painful way . That fine fellow has been propping up his father from ruin for the last five or six years . "
28837	28847	28849	28850	Captain Donnithorne	154	" He 's a regular trump , is Adam , "
28852	29101	28849	28850	Captain Donnithorne	154	" When I was a little fellow , and Adam was a strapping lad of fifteen , and taught me carpentering , I used to think if ever I was a rich sultan , I would make Adam my grand - vizier . And I believe now he would bear the exaltation as well as any poor wise man in an Eastern story . If ever I live to be a large - acred man instead of a poor devil with a mortgaged allowance of pocket - money , I 'll have Adam for my right hand . He shall manage my woods for me , for he seems to have a better notion of those things than any man I ever met with ; and I know he would make twice the money of them that my grandfather does , with that miserable old Satchell to manage , who understands no more about timber than an old carp . I 've mentioned the subject to my grandfather once or twice , but for some reason or other he has a dislike to Adam , and I can do nothing . But come , Your Reverence , are you for a ride with me ? It 's splendid out of doors now . We can go to Adam 's together , if you like ; but I want to call at the Hall Farm on my way , to look at the whelps Poyser is keeping for me . "
29102	29113	29115	29116	Mrs. Irwine	200	" You must stay and have lunch first , Arthur , "
29118	29131	29115	29116	Mrs. Irwine	200	" It 's nearly two . Carroll will bring it in directly . "
29132	29143	29145	29146	Mr. Irwine	173	" I want to go to the Hall Farm too , "
29148	29174	29145	29146	Mr. Irwine	173	" to have another look at the little Methodist who is staying there . Joshua tells me she was preaching on the Green last night . "
29175	29181	29183	29184	Captain Donnithorne	154	" Oh , by Jove ! "
29188	29328	29183	29184	Captain Donnithorne	154	" Why , she looks as quiet as a mouse . There 's something rather striking about her , though . I positively felt quite bashful the first time I saw her - she was sitting stooping over her sewing in the sunshine outside the house , when I rode up and called out , without noticing that she was a stranger , ' Is Martin Poyser at home ? ' I declare , when she got up and looked at me and just said , ' He 's in the house , I believe : I 'll go and call him , ' I felt quite ashamed of having spoken so abruptly to her . She looked like St. Catherine in a Quaker dress . It 's a type of face one rarely sees among our common people . "
29329	29341	29343	29344	Mrs. Irwine	200	" I should like to see the young woman , Dauphin , "
29346	29357	29343	29344	Mrs. Irwine	200	" Make her come here on some pretext or other . "
29358	29595	29183	29184	Captain Donnithorne	154	" I do n't know how I can manage that , Mother ; it will hardly do for me to patronize a Methodist preacher , even if she would consent to be patronized by an idle shepherd , as Will Maskery calls me . You should have come in a little sooner , Arthur , to hear Joshua 's denunciation of his neighbour Will Maskery . The old fellow wants me to excommunicate the wheelwright , and then deliver him over to the civil arm - that is to say , to your grandfather - to be turned out of house and yard . If I chose to interfere in this business , now , I might get up as pretty a story of hatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to publish in the next number of their magazine . It would n't take me much trouble to persuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bull - headed fellows that they would be doing an acceptable service to the Church by hunting Will Maskery out of the village with rope - ends and pitchforks ; and then , when I had furnished them with half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk after their exertions , I should have put the climax to as pretty a farce as any of my brother clergy have set going in their parishes for the last thirty years . "
29596	29622	29624	29625	Mrs. Irwine	200	" It is really insolent of the man , though , to call you an ' idle shepherd ' and a ' dumb dog , ' "
29627	29648	29624	29625	Mrs. Irwine	200	" I should be inclined to check him a little there . You are too easy - tempered , Dauphin . "
29649	29795	29809	29809	Carroll	201	" Why , Mother , you do n't think it would be a good way of sustaining my dignity to set about vindicating myself from the aspersions of Will Maskery ? Besides , I 'm not so sure that they ARE aspersions . I AM a lazy fellow , and get terribly heavy in my saddle ; not to mention that I 'm always spending more than I can afford in bricks and mortar , so that I get savage at a lame beggar when he asks me for sixpence . Those poor lean cobblers , who think they can help to regenerate mankind by setting out to preach in the morning twilight before they begin their day 's work , may well have a poor opinion of me . But come , let us have our luncheon . Is n't Kate coming to lunch ? "
29796	29807	29809	29809	Carroll	201	" Miss Irwine told Bridget to take her lunch upstairs , "
29819	29820	29809	29809	Carroll	201	" "
29852	29870	29850	29850	Arthur	211	" Mr. Irwine continued , observing that Captain Donnithorne had taken his arm out of the sling . "
30041	30042	30043	30043	I	0	" "
30062	30067	30053	30053	I	0	" said Mrs. Irwine . "
30205	30206	30196	30196	you	1070	" "
30220	30227	30218	30218	Mother	185	" said Mr. Irwine , smiling . "
30276	30277	30274	30274	Mother	185	" "
30396	30397	30365	30365	I	0	" "
30402	30407	30365	30365	I	0	" said Captain Donnithorne , "
30583	30584	30568	30568	he	1097	" "
30630	30641	30619	30619	I	0	" continued Mr. Irwine , rising to leave the room , "
30654	30692	30644	30644	I	0	" The little matter that Mr. Irwine had to attend to took him up the old stone staircase part of the house was very old and made him pause before a door at which he knocked gently . "
30696	30815	30644	30644	I	0	" said a woman 's voice , and he entered a room so darkened by blinds and curtains that Miss Kate , the thin middle - aged lady standing by the bedside , would not have had light enough for any other sort of work than the knitting which lay on the little table near her . But at present she was doing what required only the dimmest light - sponging the aching head that lay on the pillow with fresh vinegar . It was a small face , that of the poor sufferer ; perhaps it had once been pretty , but now it was worn and sallow . Miss Kate came towards her brother and whispered , "
30834	31122	31123	31124	the gentlefolks	1102	" Anne 's eyes were closed , and her brow contracted as if from intense pain . Mr. Irwine went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed it , a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was worth - while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that . He lingered a moment , looking at her , and then turned away and left the room , treading very gently - he had taken off his boots and put on slippers before he came upstairs . Whoever remembers how many things he has declined to do even for himself , rather than have the trouble of putting on or taking off his boots , will not think this last detail insignificant . And Mr. Irwine 's sisters , as any person of family within ten miles of Broxton could have testified , were such stupid , uninteresting women ! It was quite a pity handsome , clever Mrs. Irwine should have had such commonplace daughters . That fine old lady herself was worth driving ten miles to see , any day ; her beauty , her well - preserved faculties , and her old - fashioned dignity made her a graceful subject for conversation in turn with the King 's health , the sweet new patterns in cotton dresses , the news from Egypt , and Lord Dacey 's lawsuit , which was fretting poor Lady Dacey to death . But no one ever thought of mentioning the Miss Irwines , except the poor people in Broxton village , who regarded them as deep in the science of medicine , and spoke of them vaguely as "
31126	31147	31123	31124	the gentlefolks	1102	" If any one had asked old Job Dummilow who gave him his flannel jacket , he would have answered , "
31153	31167	31168	31169	the gentlefolks	1102	" ; and widow Steene dwelt much on the virtues of the ' stuff "

34769	35146	34754	34754	she	228	" Spinning , indeed ! It is n't spinning as you 'd be at , I 'll be bound , and let you have your own way . I never knew your equals for gallowsness . To think of a gell o ' your age wanting to go and sit with half - a - dozen men ! I 'd ha ' been ashamed to let the words pass over my lips if I 'd been you . And you , as have been here ever since last Michaelmas , and I hired you at Treddles'on stattits , without a bit o ' character - as I say , you might be grateful to be hired in that way to a respectable place ; and you knew no more o ' what belongs to work when you come here than the mawkin i ' the field . As poor a two - fisted thing as ever I saw , you know you was . Who taught you to scrub a floor , I should like to know ? Why , you 'd leave the dirt in heaps i ' the corners - anybody ' ud think you 'd never been brought up among Christians . And as for spinning , why , you 've wasted as much as your wage i ' the flax you 've spoiled learning to spin . And you 've a right to feel that , and not to go about as gaping and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody . Comb the wool for the whittaws , indeed ! That 's what you 'd like to be doing , is it ? That 's the way with you - that 's the road you 'd all like to go , headlongs to ruin . You 're never easy till you 've got some sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself : you think you 'll be finely off when you 're married , I daresay , and have got a three - legged stool to sit on , and never a blanket to cover you , and a bit o ' oat - cake for your dinner , as three children are a - snatching at . "
35147	35162	35164	35164	Molly	189	" I 'm sure I donna want t ' go wi ' the whittaws , "
35179	35225	35164	35164	Molly	189	" on'y we allays used to comb the wool for ' n at Mester Ottley 's ; an ' so I just axed ye . I donna want to set eyes on the whittaws again ; I wish I may never stir if I do . "
35226	35464	34754	34754	she	228	" Mr. Ottley 's , indeed ! It 's fine talking o ' what you did at Mr. Ottley 's . Your missis there might like her floors dirted wi ' whittaws for what I know . There 's no knowing what people WONNA like - such ways as I 've heard of ! I never had a gell come into my house as seemed to know what cleaning was ; I think people live like pigs , for my part . And as to that Betty as was dairymaid at Trent 's before she come to me , she 'd ha ' left the cheeses without turning from week 's end to week 's end , and the dairy thralls , I might ha ' wrote my name on 'em , when I come downstairs after my illness , as the doctor said it was inflammation - it was a mercy I got well of it . And to think o ' your knowing no better , Molly , and been here a - going i ' nine months , and not for want o ' talking to , neither - and what are you stanning there for , like a jack as is run down , instead o ' getting your wheel out ? You 're a rare un for sitting down to your work a little while after it 's time to put by . "
35465	35481	34754	34754	she	228	" Munny , my iron 's twite told ; pease put it down to warm . "
35556	35570	35572	35573	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Cold , is it , my darling ? Bless your sweet face ! "
35599	35620	35583	35583	she	228	" Never mind ! Mother 's done her ironing now . She 's going to put the ironing things away . "
35621	35641	35572	35573	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Munny , I tould ' ike to do into de barn to Tommy , to see de whittawd . "
35642	35657	35659	35660	Mrs. Poyser	228	" No , no , no ; Totty ' ud get her feet wet , "
35667	35680	35659	35660	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Run into the dairy and see cousin Hetty make the butter . "
35681	35694	35696	35696	Totty	242	" I tould ' ike a bit o ' pum - take , "
35750	35758	35760	35761	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Did ever anybody see the like ? "
35777	35806	35760	35761	Mrs. Poyser	228	" The child 's allays i ' mischief if your back 's turned a minute . What shall I do to you , you naughty , naughty gell ? "
35939	36233	35932	35932	she	228	" You look th ' image o ' your Aunt Judith , Dinah , when you sit a - sewing . I could almost fancy it was thirty years back , and I was a little gell at home , looking at Judith as she sat at her work , after she 'd done the house up ; only it was a little cottage , Father 's was , and not a big rambling house as gets dirty i ' one corner as fast as you clean it in another - but for all that , I could fancy you was your Aunt Judith , only her hair was a deal darker than yours , and she was stouter and broader i ' the shoulders . Judith and me allays hung together , though she had such queer ways , but your mother and her never could agree . Ah , your mother little thought as she 'd have a daughter just cut out after the very pattern o ' Judith , and leave her an orphan , too , for Judith to take care on , and bring up with a spoon when SHE was in the graveyard at Stoniton . I allays said that o ' Judith , as she 'd bear a pound weight any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce . And she was just the same from the first o ' my remembering her ; it made no difference in her , as I could see , when she took to the Methodists , only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort o ' cap ; but she 'd never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent . "
36234	36241	36243	36243	Dinah	141	" She was a blessed woman , "
36245	36349	36243	36243	Dinah	141	" God had given her a loving , self - forgetting nature , and He perfected it by grace . And she was very fond of you too , Aunt Rachel . I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way . When she had that bad illness , and I was only eleven years old , she used to say , ' You 'll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel , if I 'm taken from you , for she has a kind heart , ' and I 'm sure I 've found it so . "
36350	36802	35932	35932	she	228	" I do n't know how , child ; anybody ' ud be cunning to do anything for you , I think ; you 're like the birds o ' th ' air , and live nobody knows how . I 'd ha ' been glad to behave to you like a mother 's sister , if you 'd come and live i ' this country where there 's some shelter and victual for man and beast , and folks do n't live on the naked hills , like poultry a - scratching on a gravel bank . And then you might get married to some decent man , and there 'd be plenty ready to have you , if you 'd only leave off that preaching , as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did . And even if you 'd marry Seth Bede , as is a poor wool - gathering Methodist and 's never like to have a penny beforehand , I know your uncle ' ud help you with a pig , and very like a cow , for he 's allays been good - natur'd to my kin , for all they 're poor , and made 'em welcome to the house ; and ' ud do for you , I 'll be bound , as much as ever he 'd do for Hetty , though she 's his own niece . And there 's linen in the house as I could well spare you , for I 've got lots o ' sheeting and table - clothing , and towelling , as is n't made up . There 's a piece o ' sheeting I could give you as that squinting Kitty spun - she was a rare girl to spin , for all she squinted , and the children could n't abide her ; and , you know , the spinning 's going on constant , and there 's new linen wove twice as fast as the old wears out . But where 's the use o ' talking , if ye wonna be persuaded , and settle down like any other woman in her senses , i'stead o ' wearing yourself out with walking and preaching , and giving away every penny you get , so as you 've nothing saved against sickness ; and all the things you 've got i ' the world , I verily believe , ' ud go into a bundle no bigger nor a double cheese . And all because you 've got notions i ' your head about religion more nor what 's i ' the Catechism and the Prayer - book . "
36803	36816	36818	36818	Dinah	141	" But not more than what 's in the Bible , Aunt , "
36820	36832	36818	36818	Dinah	141	" Yes , and the Bible too , for that matter , "
36840	37021	36833	36834	Mrs. Poyser	228	" else why should n't them as know best what 's in the Bible - the parsons and people as have got nothing to do but learn it - do the same as you do ? But , for the matter o ' that , if everybody was to do like you , the world must come to a standstill ; for if everybody tried to do without house and home , and with poor eating and drinking , and was allays talking as we must despise the things o ' the world as you say , I should like to know where the pick o ' the stock , and the corn , and the best new - milk cheeses ' ud have to go . Everybody ' ud be wanting bread made o ' tail ends and everybody ' ud be running after everybody else to preach to 'em , istead o ' bringing up their families , and laying by against a bad harvest . It stands to sense as that ca n't be the right religion . "
37022	37229	36818	36818	Dinah	141	" Nay , dear aunt , you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families . It 's quite right the land should be ploughed and sowed , and the precious corn stored , and the things of this life cared for , and right that people should rejoice in their families , and provide for them , so that this is done in the fear of the Lord , and that they are not unmindful of the soul 's wants while they are caring for the body . We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast , but He gives us different sorts of work , according as He fits us for it and calls us to it . I can no more help spending my life in trying to do what I can for the souls of others , than you could help running if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house ; the voice would go to your heart , you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger , and you could n't rest without running to help her and comfort her . "
37230	37233	37235	37236	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Ah , "
37245	37295	37235	37236	Mrs. Poyser	228	" I know it ' ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours . You 'd make me the same answer , at th ' end . I might as well talk to the running brook and tell it to stan ' still . "
37371	37515	37351	37351	she	228	" If there is n't Captain Donnithorne and Mr. Irwine a - coming into the yard ! I 'll lay my life they 're come to speak about your preaching on the Green , Dinah ; it 's you must answer 'em , for I 'm dumb . I 've said enough a'ready about your bringing such disgrace upo ' your uncle 's family . I would n't ha ' minded if you 'd been Mr. Poyser 's own niece - folks must put up wi ' their own kin , as they put up wi ' their own noses - it 's their own flesh and blood . But to think of a niece o ' mine being cause o ' my husband 's being turned out of his farm , and me brought him no fortin but my savin 's - - "
37516	37523	37525	37525	Dinah	141	" Nay , dear Aunt Rachel , "
37528	37567	37525	37525	Dinah	141	" you 've no cause for such fears . I 've strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I 've done . I did n't preach without direction . "
37568	37581	37583	37584	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Direction ! I know very well what you mean by direction , "
37594	37658	37583	37584	Mrs. Poyser	228	" When there 's a bigger maggot than usual in your head you call it ' direction ' ; and then nothing can stir you - you look like the statty o ' the outside o ' Treddles'on church , a - starin ' and a - smilin ' whether it 's fair weather or foul . I hanna common patience with you . "
37758	37772	37778	37778	his	173	" Well , Mrs. Poyser , how are you after this stormy morning ? "
37782	37797	37774	37775	Mr. Irwine	173	" Our feet are quite dry ; we shall not soil your beautiful floor . "
37798	37808	37810	37811	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Oh , sir , do n't mention it , "
37813	37826	37810	37811	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Will you and the captain please to walk into the parlour ? "
37827	37838	37840	37841	the captain	5836	" No , indeed , thank you , Mrs. Poyser , "
37861	37896	37840	37841	the captain	5836	" I delight in your kitchen . I think it is the most charming room I know . I should like every farmer 's wife to come and look at it for a pattern . "
37897	37914	37916	37917	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Oh , you 're pleased to say so , sir . Pray take a seat , "
37956	37966	37968	37969	Captain Donnithorne	154	" Poyser is not at home , is he ? "
37988	38033	37972	37972	himself	154	" No , sir , he is n't ; he 's gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West , the factor , about the wool . But there 's Father i ' the barn , sir , if he 'd be of any use . "
38034	38090	37968	37969	Captain Donnithorne	154	" No , thank you ; I 'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd . I must come another day and see your husband ; I want to have a consultation with him about horses . Do you know when he 's likely to be at liberty ? "
38091	38215	37972	37972	himself	154	" Why , sir , you can hardly miss him , except it 's o ' Treddles'on market - day - that 's of a Friday , you know . For if he 's anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute . If we 'd got rid o ' the Scantlands , we should have no outlying fields ; and I should be glad of it , for if ever anything happens , he 's sure to be gone to the Scantlands . Things allays happen so contrairy , if they 've a chance ; and it 's an unnat'ral thing to have one bit o ' your farm in one county and all the rest in another . "
38216	38293	37972	37972	himself	154	" Ah , the Scantlands would go much better with Choyce 's farm , especially as he wants dairyland and you 've got plenty . I think yours is the prettiest farm on the estate , though ; and do you know , Mrs. Poyser , if I were going to marry and settle , I should be tempted to turn you out , and do up this fine old house , and turn farmer myself . "
38294	38299	38301	38302	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Oh , sir , "
38307	38540	38301	38302	Mrs. Poyser	228	" you would n't like it at all . As for farming , it 's putting money into your pocket wi ' your right hand and fetching it out wi ' your left . As fur as I can see , it 's raising victual for other folks and just getting a mouthful for yourself and your children as you go along . Not as you 'd be like a poor man as wants to get his bread - you could afford to lose as much money as you liked i ' farming - but it 's poor fun losing money , I should think , though I understan ' it 's what the great folks i ' London play at more than anything . For my husband heard at market as Lord Dacey 's eldest son had lost thousands upo ' thousands to the Prince o ' Wales , and they said my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him . But you know more about that than I do , sir . But , as for farming , sir , I canna think as you 'd like it ; and this house - the draughts in it are enough to cut you through , and it 's my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten , and the rats i ' the cellar are beyond anything . "
38541	38615	37972	37972	himself	154	" Why , that 's a terrible picture , Mrs. Poyser . I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place . But there 's no chance of that . I 'm not likely to settle for the next twenty years , till I 'm a stout gentleman of forty ; and my grandfather would never consent to part with such good tenants as you . "
38616	38845	38846	38847	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Well , sir , if he thinks so well o ' Mr. Poyser for a tenant I wish you could put in a word for him to allow us some new gates for the Five closes , for my husband 's been asking and asking till he 's tired , and to think o ' what he 's done for the farm , and 's never had a penny allowed him , be the times bad or good . And as I 've said to my husband often and often , I 'm sure if the captain had anything to do with it , it would n't be so . Not as I wish to speak disrespectful o ' them as have got the power i ' their hands , but it 's more than flesh and blood ' ull bear sometimes , to be toiling and striving , and up early and down late , and hardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as the cheese may swell , or the cows may slip their calf , or the wheat may grow green again i ' the sheaf - and after all , at th ' end o ' the year , it 's like as if you 'd been cooking a feast and had got the smell of it for your pains . "
38887	38912	38914	38915	the captain	5836	" I 'm afraid I should only do harm instead of good , if I were to speak about the gates , Mrs. Poyser , "
38917	38963	38964	38964	he	5836	" though I assure you there 's no man on the estate I would sooner say a word for than your husband . I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us ; and as for the kitchen , "
38969	39004	38964	38964	he	5836	" I do n't believe there 's one in the kingdom to beat it . By the by , I 've never seen your dairy : I must see your dairy , Mrs. Poyser . "
39005	39045	39046	39048	This Mrs. Poyser	228	" Indeed , sir , it 's not fit for you to go in , for Hetty 's in the middle o ' making the butter , for the churning was thrown late , and I 'm quite ashamed . "
39080	39097	39099	39100	the captain	5836	" Oh , I 've no doubt it 's in capital order . Take me in , "
39620	39633	39616	39616	she	177	" the naughtier the little huzzy behaved , the prettier she looked . "
40183	40203	40209	40209	he	154	" I hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July , Mrs. Poyser , "
40226	40297	40209	40209	he	154	" You know what is to happen then , and I shall expect you to be one of the guests who come earliest and leave latest . Will you promise me your hand for two dances , Miss Hetty ? If I do n't get your promise now , I know I shall hardly have a chance , for all the smart young farmers will take care to secure you . "
40330	40380	40309	40310	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Indeed , sir , you are very kind to take that notice of her . And I 'm sure , whenever you 're pleased to dance with her , she 'll be proud and thankful , if she stood still all the rest o ' th ' evening . "
40381	40414	40415	40416	the captain	5836	" Oh no , no , that would be too cruel to all the other young fellows who can dance . But you will promise me two dances , wo n't you ? "
40455	40463	40452	40452	she	177	" Yes , thank you , sir . "
40464	40520	40452	40452	she	177	" And you must bring all your children , you know , Mrs. Poyser ; your little Totty , as well as the boys . I want all the youngest children on the estate to be there - all those who will be fine young men and women when I 'm a bald old fellow . "
40521	40536	40538	40539	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Oh dear , sir , that ' ull be a long time first , "
40581	40588	40575	40576	The captain	5836	" very full of his jokes , "
40643	40652	40653	40653	he	5836	" But where is Totty to - day ? "
40656	40663	40653	40653	he	5836	" I want to see her . "
40664	40673	40675	40676	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Where IS the little un , Hetty ? "
40678	40687	40675	40676	Mrs. Poyser	228	" She came in here not long ago . "
40688	40705	40706	40708	The proud mother	1317	" I do n't know . She went into the brewhouse to Nancy , I think . "
40754	40769	40771	40772	the Captain	5836	" And do you carry the butter to market when you 've made it ? "
40778	40806	40771	40772	the Captain	5836	" Oh no , sir ; not when it 's so heavy . I 'm not strong enough to carry it . Alick takes it on horseback . "
40807	40872	40771	40772	the Captain	5836	" No , I 'm sure your pretty arms were never meant for such heavy weights . But you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant evenings , do n't you ? Why do n't you have a walk in the Chase sometimes , now it 's so green and pleasant ? I hardly ever see you anywhere except at home and at church . "
40873	40891	40893	40893	Hetty	177	" Aunt does n't like me to go a - walking only when I 'm going somewhere , "
40895	40904	40893	40893	Hetty	177	" But I go through the Chase sometimes . "
40905	40932	40771	40772	the Captain	5836	" And do n't you ever go to see Mrs. Best , the housekeeper ? I think I saw you once in the housekeeper 's room . "
40933	40981	40893	40893	Hetty	177	" It is n't Mrs. Best , it 's Mrs. Pomfret , the lady 's maid , as I go to see . She 's teaching me tent - stitch and the lace - mending . I 'm going to tea with her to - morrow afternoon . "
41068	41073	41075	41076	the captain	5836	" Here she is ! "
41090	41111	41075	41076	the captain	5836	" Here 's Totty ! By the by , what 's her other name ? She was n't christened Totty . "
41112	41182	41075	41076	the captain	5836	" Oh , sir , we call her sadly out of her name . Charlotte 's her christened name . It 's a name i ' Mr. Poyser 's family : his grandmother was named Charlotte . But we began with calling her Lotty , and now it 's got to Totty . To be sure it 's more like a name for a dog than a Christian child . "
41183	41205	41207	41208	the captain	5836	" Totty 's a capital name . Why , she looks like a Totty . Has she got a pocket on ? "
41241	41249	41250	41250	she	242	" It dot notin ' in it , "
41262	41321	41250	41250	she	242	" No ! What a pity ! Such a pretty pocket . Well , I think I 've got some things in mine that will make a pretty jingle in it . Yes ! I declare I 've got five little round silver things , and hear what a pretty noise they make in Totty 's pink pocket . "
41386	41455	41377	41377	Nancy	198	" Oh for shame , you naughty gell ! Not to thank the captain for what he 's given you I 'm sure , sir , it 's very kind of you ; but she 's spoiled shameful ; her father wo n't have her said nay in anything , and there 's no managing her . It 's being the youngest , and th ' only gell . "
41456	41490	41380	41381	her mother	1321	" Oh , she 's a funny little fatty ; I would n't have her different . But I must be going now , for I suppose the rector is waiting for me . "
41493	41498	41377	41377	Nancy	198	" good - bye , "
41630	41655	41601	41601	He	173	" What a well - favoured countenance ! Oh that the good seed might fall on that soil , for it would surely flourish . "
41694	41707	41714	41714	he	173	" You are only a visitor in this neighbourhood , I think ? "
41721	41771	41709	41709	his	173	" No , sir , I come from Snowfield , in Stonyshire . But my aunt was very kind , wanting me to have rest from my work there , because I 'd been ill , and she invited me to come and stay with her for a while . "
41772	41831	41714	41714	he	173	" Ah , I remember Snowfield very well ; I once had occasion to go there . It 's a dreary bleak place . They were building a cotton - mill there ; but that 's many years ago now . I suppose the place is a good deal changed by the employment that mill must have brought . "
41832	41907	41714	41714	he	173	" It IS changed so far as the mill has brought people there , who get a livelihood for themselves by working in it , and make it better for the tradesfolks . I work in it myself , and have reason to be grateful , for thereby I have enough and to spare . But it 's still a bleak place , as you say , sir - very different from this country . "
41908	41929	41709	41709	his	173	" You have relations living there , probably , so that you are attached to the place as your home ? "
41930	42040	41714	41714	he	173	" I had an aunt there once ; she brought me up , for I was an orphan . But she was taken away seven years ago , and I have no other kindred that I know of , besides my Aunt Poyser , who is very good to me , and would have me come and live in this country , which to be sure is a good land , wherein they eat bread without scarceness . But I 'm not free to leave Snowfield , where I was first planted , and have grown deep into it , like the small grass on the hill - top . "
42041	42066	41714	41714	he	173	" Ah , I daresay you have many religious friends and companions there ; you are a Methodist - a Wesleyan , I think ? "
42067	42098	41709	41709	his	173	" Yes , my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society , and I have cause to be thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my earliest childhood . "
42099	42121	41714	41714	he	173	" And have you been long in the habit of preaching ? For I understand you preached at Hayslope last night . "
42122	42140	41714	41714	he	173	" I first took to the work four years since , when I was twenty - one . "
42141	42151	41709	41709	his	173	" Your Society sanctions women 's preaching , then ? "
42152	42322	41714	41714	he	173	" It does n't forbid them , sir , when they 've a clear call to the work , and when their ministry is owned by the conversion of sinners and the strengthening of God 's people . Mrs. Fletcher , as you may have heard about , was the first woman to preach in the Society , I believe , before she was married , when she was Miss Bosanquet ; and Mr. Wesley approved of her undertaking the work . She had a great gift , and there are many others now living who are precious fellow - helpers in the work of the ministry . I understand there 's been voices raised against it in the Society of late , but I can not but think their counsel will come to nought . It is n't for men to make channels for God 's Spirit , as they make channels for the watercourses , and say , ' Flow here , but flow not there . ' "
42323	42395	41714	41714	he	173	" But do n't you find some danger among your people - I do n't mean to say that it is so with you , far from it - but do n't you find sometimes that both men and women fancy themselves channels for God 's Spirit , and are quite mistaken , so that they set about a work for which they are unfit and bring holy things into contempt ? "
42396	42495	41709	41709	his	173	" Doubtless it is so sometimes ; for there have been evil - doers among us who have sought to deceive the brethren , and some there are who deceive their own selves . But we are not without discipline and correction to put a check upon these things . There 's a very strict order kept among us , and the brethren and sisters watch for each other 's souls as they that must give account . They do n't go every one his own way and say , ' Am I my brother 's keeper ? ' "
42496	42524	41709	41709	his	173	" But tell me - if I may ask , and I am really interested in knowing it - how you first came to think of preaching ? "
42525	42839	41714	41714	he	173	" Indeed , sir , I did n't think of it at all - I 'd been used from the time I was sixteen to talk to the little children , and teach them , and sometimes I had had my heart enlarged to speak in class , and was much drawn out in prayer with the sick . But I had felt no call to preach , for when I 'm not greatly wrought upon , I 'm too much given to sit still and keep by myself . It seems as if I could sit silent all day long with the thought of God overflowing my soul - as the pebbles lie bathed in the Willow Brook . For thoughts are so great - are n't they , sir ? They seem to lie upon us like a deep flood ; and it 's my besetment to forget where I am and everything about me , and lose myself in thoughts that I could give no account of , for I could neither make a beginning nor ending of them in words . That was my way as long as I can remember ; but sometimes it seemed as if speech came to me without any will of my own , and words were given to me that came out as the tears come , because our hearts are full and we ca n't help it . And those were always times of great blessing , though I had never thought it could be so with me before a congregation of people . But , sir , we are led on , like the little children , by a way that we know not . I was called to preach quite suddenly , and since then I have never been left in doubt about the work that was laid upon me . "
42840	42860	41714	41714	he	173	" But tell me the circumstances - just how it was , the very day you began to preach . "
42861	43356	41714	41714	he	173	" It was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe , who was an aged man , one of the local preachers , all the way to Hetton - Deeps - that 's a village where the people get their living by working in the lead - mines , and where there 's no church nor preacher , but they live like sheep without a shepherd . It 's better than twelve miles from Snowfield , so we set out early in the morning , for it was summertime ; and I had a wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills , where there 's no trees , you know , sir , as there is here , to make the sky look smaller , but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent , and you feel the everlasting arms around you . But before we got to Hetton , brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling , for he overworked himself sadly , at his years , in watching and praying , and walking so many miles to speak the Word , as well as carrying on his trade of linen - weaving . And when we got to the village , the people were expecting him , for he 'd appointed the time and the place when he was there before , and such of them as cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest , so as others might be drawn to come . But he felt as he could n't stand up to preach , and he was forced to lie down in the first of the cottages we came to . So I went to tell the people , thinking we 'd go into one of the houses , and I would read and pray with them . But as I passed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors , and the hard looks of the men , who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky , I felt a great movement in my soul , and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit entering into my weak body . And I went to where the little flock of people was gathered together , and stepped on the low wall that was built against the green hillside , and I spoke the words that were given to me abundantly . And they all came round me out of all the cottages , and many wept over their sins , and have since been joined to the Lord . That was the beginning of my preaching , sir , and I 've preached ever since . "
43421	43451	43416	43416	He	173	" He must be a miserable prig who would act the pedagogue here : one might as well go and lecture the trees for growing in their own shape . "
43452	43481	43482	43482	he	173	" And you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youth - that you are a lovely young woman on whom men 's eyes are fixed ? "
43486	43606	43416	43416	He	173	" No , I 've no room for such feelings , and I do n't believe the people ever take notice about that . I think , sir , when God makes His presence felt through us , we are like the burning bush : Moses never took any heed what sort of bush it was - he only saw the brightness of the Lord . I 've preached to as rough ignorant people as can be in the villages about Snowfield - men that looked very hard and wild - but they never said an uncivil word to me , and often thanked me kindly as they made way for me to pass through the midst of them . "
43607	43619	43621	43622	Mr. Irwine	173	" THAT I can believe - that I can well believe , "
43626	43648	43621	43622	Mr. Irwine	173	" And what did you think of your hearers last night , now ? Did you find them quiet and attentive ? "
43649	43860	43416	43416	He	173	" Very quiet , sir , but I saw no signs of any great work upon them , except in a young girl named Bessy Cranage , towards whom my heart yearned greatly , when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth , given up to folly and vanity . I had some private talk and prayer with her afterwards , and I trust her heart is touched . But I 've noticed that in these villages where the people lead a quiet life among the green pastures and the still waters , tilling the ground and tending the cattle , there 's a strange deadness to the Word , as different as can be from the great towns , like Leeds , where I once went to visit a holy woman who preaches there . It 's wonderful how rich is the harvest of souls up those high - walled streets , where you seemed to walk as in a prison - yard , and the ear is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil . I think maybe it is because the promise is sweeter when this life is so dark and weary , and the soul gets more hungry when the body is ill at ease . "
43861	43914	43621	43622	Mr. Irwine	173	" Why , yes , our farm - labourers are not easily roused . They take life almost as slowly as the sheep and cows . But we have some intelligent workmen about here . I daresay you know the Bedes ; Seth Bede , by the by , is a Methodist . "
43915	43968	43416	43416	He	173	" Yes , I know Seth well , and his brother Adam a little . Seth is a gracious young man - sincere and without offence ; and Adam is like the patriarch Joseph , for his great skill and knowledge and the kindness he shows to his brother and his parents . "
43969	44014	43621	43622	Mr. Irwine	173	" Perhaps you do n't know the trouble that has just happened to them ? Their father , Matthias Bede , was drowned in the Willow Brook last night , not far from his own door . I 'm going now to see Adam . "
44015	44023	44025	44025	Dinah	141	" Ah , their poor aged mother ! "
44048	44081	44040	44040	she	141	" She will mourn heavily , for Seth has told me she 's of an anxious , troubled heart . I must go and see if I can give her any help . "
44141	44177	44135	44135	his	173	" Good - bye . I hear you are going away soon ; but this will not be the last visit you will pay your aunt - so we shall meet again , I hope . "
44203	44227	44200	44200	she	141	" I 've never asked after Mrs. Irwine and the Miss Irwines , sir ; I hope they 're as well as usual . "
44228	44271	44200	44200	she	141	" Yes , thank you , Mrs. Poyser , except that Miss Anne has one of her bad headaches to - day . By the by , we all liked that nice cream - cheese you sent us - my mother especially . "
44272	44354	44200	44200	she	141	" I 'm very glad , indeed , sir . It is but seldom I make one , but I remembered Mrs. Irwine was fond of 'em . Please to give my duty to her , and to Miss Kate and Miss Anne . They 've never been to look at my poultry this long while , and I 've got some beautiful speckled chickens , black and white , as Miss Kate might like to have some of amongst hers . "
44355	44374	44376	44377	the rector	999	" Well , I 'll tell her ; she must come and see them . Good - bye , "
44383	44391	44393	44394	Captain Donnithorne	154	" Just ride slowly on , Irwine , "
44399	44443	44393	44394	Captain Donnithorne	154	" I 'll overtake you in three minutes . I 'm only going to speak to the shepherd about the whelps . Good - bye , Mrs. Poyser ; tell your husband I shall come and have a long talk with him soon . "
44612	44640	44599	44599	she	228	" Why , Mr. Irwine was n't angry , then ? What did he say to you , Dinah ? Did n't he scold you for preaching ? "
44641	44696	44583	44584	Mrs. Poyser	228	" No , he was not at all angry ; he was very friendly to me . I was quite drawn out to speak to him ; I hardly know how , for I had always thought of him as a worldly Sadducee . But his countenance is as pleasant as the morning sunshine . "
44697	44713	44715	44716	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Pleasant ! And what else did y ' expect to find him but pleasant ? "
44723	44912	44715	44716	Mrs. Poyser	228	" I should think his countenance is pleasant indeed ! And him a gentleman born , and 's got a mother like a picter . You may go the country round and not find such another woman turned sixty - six . It 's summat - like to see such a man as that i ' the desk of a Sunday ! As I say to Poyser , it 's like looking at a full crop o ' wheat , or a pasture with a fine dairy o ' cows in it ; it makes you think the world 's comfortable - like . But as for such creaturs as you Methodisses run after , I 'd as soon go to look at a lot o ' bare - ribbed runts on a common . Fine folks they are to tell you what 's right , as look as if they 'd never tasted nothing better than bacon - sword and sour - cake i ' their lives . But what did Mr. Irwine say to you about that fool 's trick o ' preaching on the Green ? "
44913	45014	44583	44584	Mrs. Poyser	228	" He only said he 'd heard of it ; he did n't seem to feel any displeasure about it . But , dear aunt , do n't think any more about that . He told me something that I 'm sure will cause you sorrow , as it does me . Thias Bede was drowned last night in the Willow Brook , and I 'm thinking that the aged mother will be greatly in need of comfort . Perhaps I can be of use to her , so I have fetched my bonnet and am going to set out . "
45015	45035	45037	45038	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Dear heart , dear heart ! But you must have a cup o ' tea first , child , "
45057	45292	44583	44584	Mrs. Poyser	228	" The kettle 's boiling - we 'll have it ready in a minute ; and the young uns ' ull be in and wanting theirs directly . I 'm quite willing you should go and see th ' old woman , for you 're one as is allays welcome in trouble , Methodist or no Methodist ; but , for the matter o ' that , it 's the flesh and blood folks are made on as makes the difference . Some cheeses are made o ' skimmed milk and some o ' new milk , and it 's no matter what you call 'em , you may tell which is which by the look and the smell . But as to Thias Bede , he 's better out o ' the way nor in - God forgi ' me for saying so - for he 's done little this ten year but make trouble for them as belonged to him ; and I think it ' ud be well for you to take a little bottle o ' rum for th ' old woman , for I daresay she 's got never a drop o ' nothing to comfort her inside . Sit down , child , and be easy , for you sha n't stir out till you 've had a cup o ' tea , and so I tell you . "
45372	45375	45376	45376	she	251	" Molly , "
45382	45405	45376	45376	she	251	" just run out and get me a bunch of dock - leaves : the butter 's ready to pack up now . "
45406	45417	45419	45420	her aunt	1245	" D ' you hear what 's happened , Hetty ? "
45422	45431	45376	45376	she	251	" No ; how should I hear anything ? "
45441	45539	45376	45376	she	251	" Not as you 'd care much , I daresay , if you did hear ; for you 're too feather - headed to mind if everybody was dead , so as you could stay upstairs a - dressing yourself for two hours by the clock . But anybody besides yourself ' ud mind about such things happening to them as think a deal more of you than you deserve . But Adam Bede and all his kin might be drownded for what you 'd care - you 'd be perking at the glass the next minute . "
45540	45546	45548	45548	Hetty	251	" Adam Bede - drowned ? "
45573	45581	45583	45583	Dinah	141	" No , my dear , no , "
45601	45635	45587	45588	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Not Adam . Adam 's father , the old man , is drowned . He was drowned last night in the Willow Brook . Mr. Irwine has just told me about it . "
45636	45642	45644	45644	Hetty	251	" Oh , how dreadful ! "
46048	46069	46035	46036	her uncle	1355	" Adam knew a fine sight more o ' the natur o ' things than those as thought themselves his betters "
46135	46589	46130	46130	Adam	127	" a man ; always knew what to say about things , could tell her uncle how to prop the hovel , and had mended the churn in no time ; knew , with only looking at it , the value of the chestnut - tree that was blown down , and why the damp came in the walls , and what they must do to stop the rats ; and wrote a beautiful hand that you could read off , and could do figures in his head - a degree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest farmers of that countryside . Not at all like that slouching Luke Britton , who , when she once walked with him all the way from Broxton to Hayslope , had only broken silence to remark that the grey goose had begun to lay . And as for Mr. Craig , the gardener , he was a sensible man enough , to be sure , but he was knock - kneed , and had a queer sort of sing - song in his talk ; moreover , on the most charitable supposition , he must be far on the way to forty . Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam , and would be pleased for her to marry him . For those were times when there was no rigid demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable artisan , and on the home hearth , as well as in the public house , they might be seen taking their jug of ale together ; the farmer having a latent sense of capital , and of weight in parish affairs , which sustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in conversation . Martin Poyser was not a frequenter of public houses , but he liked a friendly chat over his own home - brewed ; and though it was pleasant to lay down the law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of his farm , it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from a clever fellow like Adam Bede . Accordingly , for the last three years - ever since he had superintended the building of the new barn - Adam had always been made welcome at the Hall Farm , especially of a winter evening , when the whole family , in patriarchal fashion , master and mistress , children and servants , were assembled in that glorious kitchen , at well - graduated distances from the blazing fire . And for the last two years , at least , Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her uncle say , "
46663	46677	46658	46658	Lady	1369	" a remark which Mrs. Poyser always followed up with her cordial assent . "
46680	46685	46658	46658	Lady	1369	" she would say , "
46827	47044	46813	46813	She	886	" These expressions , though figurative , sufficiently indicated the bent of Mrs. Poyser 's mind with regard to Adam ; and though she and her husband might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter of their own , it was clear that they would have welcomed the match with Adam for a penniless niece . For what could Hetty have been but a servant elsewhere , if her uncle had not taken her in and brought her up as a domestic help to her aunt , whose health since the birth of Totty had not been equal to more positive labour than the superintendence of servants and children ? But Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement . Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly conscious of his superiority to her other admirers , she had never brought herself to think of accepting him . She liked to feel that this strong , skilful , keen - eyed man was in her power , and would have been indignant if he had shown the least sign of slipping from under the yoke of her coquettish tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge , who would have been grateful enough for the most trifling notice from him . "
47088	48265	47067	47067	she	189	" And always when Adam stayed away for several weeks from the Hall Farm , and otherwise made some show of resistance to his passion as a foolish one , Hetty took care to entice him back into the net by little airs of meekness and timidity , as if she were in trouble at his neglect . But as to marrying Adam , that was a very different affair ! There was nothing in the world to tempt her to do that . Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his name was mentioned ; she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along the causeway by the window , or advancing towards her unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow ; she felt nothing , when his eyes rested on her , but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not care to look at Mary Burge . He could no more stir in her the emotions that make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant . She saw him as he was - a poor man with old parents to keep , who would not be able , for a long while to come , to give her even such luxuries as she shared in her uncle 's house . And Hetty 's dreams were all of luxuries : to sit in a carpeted parlour , and always wear white stockings ; to have some large beautiful ear - rings , such as were all the fashion ; to have Nottingham lace round the top of her gown , and something to make her handkerchief smell nice , like Miss Lydia Donnithorne 's when she drew it out at church ; and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by anybody . She thought , if Adam had been rich and could have given her these things , she loved him well enough to marry him . But for the last few weeks a new influence had come over Hetty - vague , atmospheric , shaping itself into no self - confessed hopes or prospects , but producing a pleasant narcotic effect , making her tread the ground and go about her work in a sort of dream , unconscious of weight or effort , and showing her all things through a soft , liquid veil , as if she were living not in this solid world of brick and stone , but in a beatified world , such as the sun lights up for us in the waters . Hetty had become aware that Mr. Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of trouble for the chance of seeing her ; that he always placed himself at church so as to have the fullest view of her both sitting and standing ; that he was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm , and always would contrive to say something for the sake of making her speak to him and look at him . The poor child no more conceived at present the idea that the young squire could ever be her lover than a baker 's pretty daughter in the crowd , whom a young emperor distinguishes by an imperial but admiring smile , conceives that she shall be made empress . But the baker 's daughter goes home and dreams of the handsome young emperor , and perhaps weighs the flour amiss while she is thinking what a heavenly lot it must be to have him for a husband . And so , poor Hetty had got a face and a presence haunting her waking and sleeping dreams ; bright , soft glances had penetrated her , and suffused her life with a strange , happy languor . The eyes that shed those glances were really not half so fine as Adam 's , which sometimes looked at her with a sad , beseeching tenderness , but they had found a ready medium in Hetty 's little silly imagination , whereas Adam 's could get no entrance through that atmosphere . For three weeks , at least , her inward life had consisted of little else than living through in memory the looks and words Arthur had directed towards her - of little else than recalling the sensations with which she heard his voice outside the house , and saw him enter , and became conscious that his eyes were fixed on her , and then became conscious that a tall figure , looking down on her with eyes that seemed to touch her , was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful texture with an odour like that of a flower - garden borne on the evening breeze . Foolish thoughts ! But all this happened , you must remember , nearly sixty years ago , and Hetty was quite uneducated - a simple farmer 's girl , to whom a gentleman with a white hand was dazzling as an Olympian god . Until to - day , she had never looked farther into the future than to the next time Captain Donnithorne would come to the Farm , or the next Sunday when she should see him at church ; but now she thought , perhaps he would try to meet her when she went to the Chase to - morrow - and if he should speak to her , and walk a little way , when nobody was by ! That had never happened yet ; and now her imagination , instead of retracing the past , was busy fashioning what would happen to - morrow - whereabout in the Chase she should see him coming towards her , how she should put her new rose - coloured ribbon on , which he had never seen , and what he would say to her to make her return his glance - a glance which she would be living through in her memory , over and over again , all the rest of the day . In this state of mind , how could Hetty give any feeling to Adam 's troubles , or think much about poor old Thias being drowned ? Young souls , in such pleasant delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as butterflies sipping nectar ; they are isolated from all appeals by a barrier of dreams - by invisible looks and impalpable arms . While Hetty 's hands were busy packing up the butter , and her head filled with these pictures of the morrow , Arthur Donnithorne , riding by Mr. Irwine 's side towards the valley of the Willow Brook , had also certain indistinct anticipations , running as an undercurrent in his mind while he was listening to Mr. Irwine 's account of Dinah - indistinct , yet strong enough to make him feel rather conscious when Mr. Irwine suddenly said , "
48290	48318	48279	48279	you	1377	" Arthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever invention would be of any use , so he said , with his accustomed frankness , "
48413	48414	48407	48411	the most charming phiz imaginable	1391	" "
48650	48651	48631	48631	He	127	" "
48746	48747	48739	48739	I	0	" "
48861	48862	48864	48864	you	211	" "
48914	49901	49904	49904	Adam	127	" That is the great advantage of dialogue on horseback ; it can be merged any minute into a trot or a canter , and one might have escaped from Socrates himself in the saddle . The two friends were free from the necessity of further conversation till they pulled up in the lane behind Adam 's cottage . Chapter X Dinah Visits Lisbeth AT five o'clock Lisbeth came downstairs with a large key in her hand : it was the key of the chamber where her husband lay dead . Throughout the day , except in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief , she had been in incessant movement , performing the initial duties to her dead with the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites . She had brought out her little store of bleached linen , which she had for long years kept in reserve for this supreme use . It seemed but yesterday - that time so many midsummers ago , when she had told Thias where this linen lay , that he might be sure and reach it out for her when SHE died , for she was the elder of the two . Then there had been the work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the sacred chamber , and of removing from it every trace of common daily occupation . The small window , which had hitherto freely let in the frosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working man 's slumber , must now be darkened with a fair white sheet , for this was the sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in ceiled houses . Lisbeth had even mended a long - neglected and unnoticeable rent in the checkered bit of bed - curtain ; for the moments were few and precious now in which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love for the still corpse , to which in all her thoughts she attributed some consciousness . Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them : they can be injured by us , they can be wounded ; they know all our penitence , all our aching sense that their place is empty , all the kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence . And the aged peasant woman most of all believes that her dead are conscious . Decent burial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of for herself through years of thrift , with an indistinct expectation that she should know when she was being carried to the churchyard , followed by her husband and her sons ; and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life were to be done in seeing that Thias was buried decently before her - under the white thorn , where once , in a dream , she had thought she lay in the coffin , yet all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white blossoms that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be churched after Adam was born . But now she had done everything that could be done to - day in the chamber of death - had done it all herself , with some aid from her sons in lifting , for she would let no one be fetched to help her from the village , not being fond of female neighbours generally ; and her favourite Dolly , the old housekeeper at Mr. Burge 's , who had come to condole with her in the morning as soon as she heard of Thias 's death , was too dim - sighted to be of much use . She had locked the door , and now held the key in her hand , as she threw herself wearily into a chair that stood out of its place in the middle of the house floor , where in ordinary times she would never have consented to sit . The kitchen had had none of her attention that day ; it was soiled with the tread of muddy shoes and untidy with clothes and other objects out of place . But what at another time would have been intolerable to Lisbeth 's habits of order and cleanliness seemed to her now just what should be : it was right that things should look strange and disordered and wretched , now the old man had come to his end in that sad way ; the kitchen ought not to look as if nothing had happened . Adam , overcome with the agitations and exertions of the day after his night of hard work , had fallen asleep on a bench in the workshop ; and Seth was in the back kitchen making a fire of sticks that he might get the kettle to boil , and persuade his mother to have a cup of tea , an indulgence which she rarely allowed herself . There was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and threw herself into the chair . She looked round with blank eyes at the dirt and confusion on which the bright afternoon 's sun shone dismally ; it was all of a piece with the sad confusion of her mind - that confusion which belongs to the first hours of a sudden sorrow , when the poor human soul is like one who has been deposited sleeping among the ruins of a vast city , and wakes up in dreary amazement , not knowing whether it is the growing or the dying day - not knowing why and whence came this illimitable scene of desolation , or why he too finds himself desolate in the midst of it . At another time Lisbeth 's first thought would have been , "
49906	50010	49904	49904	Adam	127	" but the sudden death of her husband had restored him in these hours to that first place in her affections which he had held six - and - twenty years ago . She had forgotten his faults as we forget the sorrows of our departed childhood , and thought of nothing but the young husband 's kindness and the old man 's patience . Her eyes continued to wander blankly until Seth came in and began to remove some of the scattered things , and clear the small round deal table that he might set out his mother 's tea upon it . "
50017	50024	50025	50025	I	0	" she said , rather peevishly . "
50037	50043	50035	50035	Mother	544	" answered Seth , tenderly . "
50070	50071	50051	50051	I	0	" "
50103	50117	50090	50092	a - be	1422	" she went on , the tears coming when she began to speak , "
50461	50587	50456	50456	he	1442	" Here Lisbeth broke from words into moans , swaying herself backwards and forwards on her chair . Seth , always timid in his behaviour towards his mother , from the sense that he had no influence over her , felt it was useless to attempt to persuade or soothe her till this passion was past ; so he contented himself with tending the back kitchen fire and folding up his father 's clothes , which had been hanging out to dry since morning - afraid to move about in the room where his mother was , lest he should irritate her further . But after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for some minutes , she suddenly paused and said aloud to herself , "
50637	50660	50661	50661	Adam	127	" Seth overheard this , and coming into the kitchen again , as his mother rose from her chair , he said , "
50684	50685	50676	50676	He	127	" "
50737	51167	51173	51174	my lad	5599	" Adam was seated on a rough bench , his head supported by his arm , which rested from the shoulder to the elbow on the long planing - table in the middle of the workshop . It seemed as if he had sat down for a few minutes ' rest and had fallen asleep without slipping from his first attitude of sad , fatigued thought . His face , unwashed since yesterday , looked pallid and clammy ; his hair was tossed shaggily about his forehead , and his closed eyes had the sunken look which follows upon watching and sorrow . His brow was knit , and his whole face had an expression of weariness and pain . Gyp was evidently uneasy , for he sat on his haunches , resting his nose on his master 's stretched - out leg , and dividing the time between licking the hand that hung listlessly down and glancing with a listening air towards the door . The poor dog was hungry and restless , but would not leave his master , and was waiting impatiently for some change in the scene . It was owing to this feeling on Gyp 's part that , when Lisbeth came into the workshop and advanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she could , her intention not to awaken him was immediately defeated ; for Gyp 's excitement was too great to find vent in anything short of a sharp bark , and in a moment Adam opened his eyes and saw his mother standing before him . It was not very unlike his dream , for his sleep had been little more than living through again , in a fevered delirious way , all that had happened since daybreak , and his mother with her fretful grief was present to him through it all . The chief difference between the reality and the vision was that in his dream Hetty was continually coming before him in bodily presence - strangely mingling herself as an actor in scenes with which she had nothing to do . She was even by the Willow Brook ; she made his mother angry by coming into the house ; and he met her with her smart clothes quite wet through , as he walked in the rain to Treddleston , to tell the coroner . But wherever Hetty came , his mother was sure to follow soon ; and when he opened his eyes , it was not at all startling to see her standing near him . "
51176	51210	51173	51174	my lad	5599	" Lisbeth burst out immediately , her wailing impulse returning , for grief in its freshness feels the need of associating its loss and its lament with every change of scene and incident , "
51431	51532	51533	51533	I	0	" Here Lisbeth paused , but Adam sat in pained silence - he could not speak otherwise than tenderly to his mother to - day , but he could not help being irritated by this plaint . It was not possible for poor Lisbeth to know how it affected Adam any more than it is possible for a wounded dog to know how his moans affect the nerves of his master . Like all complaining women , she complained in the expectation of being soothed , and when Adam said nothing , she was only prompted to complain more bitterly . "
51681	51711	51712	51712	Thee	1463	" Adam , unable to bear this any longer , rose silently from the bench and walked out of the workshop into the kitchen . But Lisbeth followed him . "
51756	51765	51744	51744	he	1470	" Adam turned round at once and said , "
51784	51883	51777	51777	Seth	128	" They went upstairs , and for five minutes all was silence . Then the key was turned again , and there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs . But Adam did not come down again ; he was too weary and worn - out to encounter more of his mother 's querulous grief , and he went to rest on his bed . Lisbeth no sooner entered the kitchen and sat down than she threw her apron over her head , and began to cry and moan and rock herself as before . Seth thought , "
51897	51972	51884	51884	She	1474	" ; and he went into the back kitchen again , to tend his little fire , hoping that he should presently induce her to have some tea . Lisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five minutes , giving a low moan with every forward movement of her body , when she suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers , and a sweet treble voice said to her , "
51992	52278	51976	51977	the Lord	697	" Lisbeth paused , in a listening attitude , without removing her apron from her face . The voice was strange to her . Could it be her sister 's spirit come back to her from the dead after all those years ? She trembled and dared not look . Dinah , believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for the sorrowing woman , said no more just yet , but quietly took off her bonnet , and then , motioning silence to Seth , who , on hearing her voice , had come in with a beating heart , laid one hand on the back of Lisbeth 's chair and leaned over her , that she might be aware of a friendly presence . Slowly Lisbeth drew down her apron , and timidly she opened her dim dark eyes . She saw nothing at first but a face - a pure , pale face , with loving grey eyes , and it was quite unknown to her . Her wonder increased ; perhaps it WAS an angel . But in the same instant Dinah had laid her hand on Lisbeth 's again , and the old woman looked down at it . It was a much smaller hand than her own , but it was not white and delicate , for Dinah had never worn a glove in her life , and her hand bore the traces of labour from her childhood upwards . Lisbeth looked earnestly at the hand for a moment , and then , fixing her eyes again on Dinah 's face , said , with something of restored courage , but in a tone of surprise , "
52287	52288	52282	52285	a workin ' woman	1479	" "
52310	52311	52297	52297	I	0	" "
52314	52322	52323	52323	ye	1478	" said Lisbeth slowly , still wondering ; "
52377	52378	52379	52379	I	0	" "
52496	52497	52500	52500	I	0	" "
52524	52542	52517	52517	he	128	" said Lisbeth fretfully , her overpowering sense of pain returning , now her wonder was gone . "
52733	52748	52725	52726	a journeyman	1497	" Here Lisbeth began to cry and rock herself again ; and Dinah said , "
52894	52895	52885	52885	You	1499	" "
53110	53264	53265	53265	Thee	1511	" Dinah took care not to betray that she had had her tea , and accepted Lisbeth 's invitation very readily , for the sake of persuading the old woman herself to take the food and drink she so much needed after a day of hard work and fasting . Seth was so happy now Dinah was in the house that he could not help thinking her presence was worth purchasing with a life in which grief incessantly followed upon grief ; but the next moment he reproached himself - it was almost as if he were rejoicing in his father 's sad death . Nevertheless the joy of being with Dinah WOULD triumph - it was like the influence of climate , which no resistance can overcome . And the feeling even suffused itself over his face so as to attract his mother 's notice , while she was drinking her tea . "
53380	53387	53388	53388	I	0	" here Lisbeth turned to Dinah . "
53510	53511	53563	53563	I	0	" "
53514	53560	53563	53563	I	0	" said Dinah , careful not to oppose any feeling of Lisbeth 's , for her reliance , in her smallest words and deeds , on a divine guidance , always issued in that finest woman 's tact which proceeds from acute and ready sympathy ; "
53615	53616	53641	53641	mother	544	" "
53619	53634	53641	53641	mother	544	" said Lisbeth , taking the cup and speaking in a less querulous tone , "
53654	53655	53664	53664	mother	544	" "
53701	53702	53686	53686	she	701	" "
53795	53972	53788	53789	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Dinah , seeing that Lisbeth 's attention was attracted , told her the story of her early life - how she had been brought up to work hard , and what sort of place Snowfield was , and how many people had a hard life there - all the details that she thought likely to interest Lisbeth . The old woman listened , and forgot to be fretful , unconsciously subject to the soothing influence of Dinah 's face and voice . After a while she was persuaded to let the kitchen be made tidy ; for Dinah was bent on this , believing that the sense of order and quietude around her would help in disposing Lisbeth to join in the prayer she longed to pour forth at her side . Seth , meanwhile , went out to chop wood , for he surmised that Dinah would like to be left alone with his mother . Lisbeth sat watching her as she moved about in her still quick way , and said at last , "
54031	54032	54027	54027	they	5433	" "
54045	54049	54043	54043	'em	1540	" said Dinah ; "
54114	54115	54118	54118	I	0	" "
54212	54213	54201	54201	they	1553	" "
54216	54220	54221	54221	they	1553	" said Dinah , "

54373	54374	54369	54369	THEY'RE	1564	" "
54377	54381	54369	54369	THEY'RE	1564	" said Dinah , "
54597	54598	54589	54589	he	5962	" "
54607	54611	54589	54589	he	5962	" said Lisbeth . "
54724	54848	54716	54716	he	5962	" Dinah and Seth were both inwardly offering thanks for the greater quietness of spirit that had come over Lisbeth . This was what Dinah had been trying to bring about , through all her still sympathy and absence from exhortation . From her girlhood upwards she had had experience among the sick and the mourning , among minds hardened and shrivelled through poverty and ignorance , and had gained the subtlest perception of the mode in which they could best be touched and softened into willingness to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning . As Dinah expressed it , ' she was never left to herself ; but it was always given her when to keep silence and when to speak . "
55289	55305	55306	55306	he	127	" There 's nothing but what 's bearable as long as a man can work , "
55311	55391	55306	55306	he	127	" the natur o ' things does n't change , though it seems as if one 's own life was nothing but change . The square o ' four is sixteen , and you must lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight , is as true when a man 's miserable as when he 's happy ; and the best o ' working is , it gives you a grip hold o ' things outside your own lot . "
55757	55766	55768	55768	Dinah	268	" How do you do , Adam Bede ? "
55788	55807	55768	55768	Dinah	268	" I trust you feel rested and strengthened again to bear the burden and heat of the day . "
56022	56046	56047	56047	he	127	" I was quite taken by surprise ; it was very good of you to come and see my mother in her trouble , "
56071	56082	56083	56083	he	127	" I hope my mother was thankful to have you , "
56096	56099	56101	56101	Dinah	268	" Yes , "
56141	56142	56132	56132	She	268	" "
56154	56176	56179	56180	Mr. Irwine	173	" said Adam , his thoughts reverting to some one there ; he wondered whether SHE had felt anything about it . "
56264	56389	56233	56233	They	1615	" Dinah , with her sympathetic divination , knew quite well that Adam was longing to hear if Hetty had said anything about their trouble ; she was too rigorously truthful for benevolent invention , but she had contrived to say something in which Hetty was tacitly included . Love has a way of cheating itself consciously , like a child who plays at solitary hide - and - seek ; it is pleased with assurances that it all the while disbelieves . Adam liked what Dinah had said so much that his mind was directly full of the next visit he should pay to the Hall Farm , when Hetty would perhaps behave more kindly to him than she had ever done before . "
56400	56406	56391	56391	you	268	" he said to Dinah . "
56490	56491	56481	56481	her	1080	" "
56542	56549	56525	56525	she	1625	" Adam went on , smiling , "
56566	56663	56664	56664	You	268	" Hitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in motionless silence , seated on his haunches , and alternately looking up in his master 's face to watch its expression and observing Dinah 's movements about the kitchen . The kind smile with which Adam uttered the last words was apparently decisive with Gyp of the light in which the stranger was to be regarded , and as she turned round after putting aside her sweeping - brush , he trotted towards her and put up his muzzle against her hand in a friendly way . "
56671	56675	56677	56677	he	142	" said Adam , "
56685	56686	56677	56677	he	142	" "
56690	56700	56701	56701	I	0	" said Dinah , patting the rough grey coat , "
56779	57022	57023	57023	Ye	1631	" Seth came down now , and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah ; he wanted Adam to know how much better she was than all other women . But after a few words of greeting , Adam drew him into the workshop to consult about the coffin , and Dinah went on with her cleaning . By six o'clock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as clean as she could have made it herself . The window and door were open , and the morning air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood , thyme , and sweet - briar from the patch of garden by the side of the cottage . Dinah did not sit down at first , but moved about , serving the others with the warm porridge and the toasted oat - cake , which she had got ready in the usual way , for she had asked Seth to tell her just what his mother gave them for breakfast . Lisbeth had been unusually silent since she came downstairs , apparently requiring some time to adjust her ideas to a state of things in which she came down like a lady to find all the work done , and sat still to be waited on . Her new sensations seemed to exclude the remembrance of her grief . At last , after tasting the porridge , she broke silence : "
57032	57038	57023	57023	Ye	1631	" she said to Dinah ; "
57163	57164	57165	57165	Makeshift	272	" "
57169	57173	57165	57165	Makeshift	272	" said Adam . "

57257	57258	57259	57259	Dinah	268	" "
57261	57265	57259	57259	Dinah	268	" said Seth , "

57296	57300	57277	57277	We	1643	" said Lisbeth , "
57328	57347	57348	57348	I	0	" she added , in a tone of complaining affection , as Dinah sat down by her side , "
57387	57388	57368	57368	I	0	" "
57401	57405	57406	57406	I	0	" said Dinah . "

57503	57507	57475	57475	he	1442	" said Adam , "

57704	57708	57697	57697	I	0	" said Seth , "

57781	57785	57775	57775	I	0	" said Dinah ; "

57905	57909	57928	57928	ha	1677	" said Lisbeth , "
57982	57991	57993	57993	thee	1676	" she went on , looking at Adam , "
58048	58049	58050	58050	Donna	188	" "
58055	58059	58053	58053	mother	544	" said Adam . "
58080	58095	58071	58071	I	0	" He had finished his breakfast now , and rose as he was speaking . "
58102	58106	58071	58071	I	0	" asked Lisbeth . "
58114	58115	58118	58118	mother	544	" "
58120	58124	58118	58118	mother	544	" said Adam ; "
58141	58142	58118	58118	mother	544	" "
58150	58161	58118	58118	mother	544	" Lisbeth burst out in an eager , wailing tone ; "
58213	58214	58218	58218	mother	544	" "
58247	58248	58237	58237	thee	1676	" "
58332	58349	58320	58320	I	0	" Adam 's eyes met Seth 's , which looked from Dinah to him rather wistfully . "
58354	58358	58352	58352	Mother	185	" he said , "
58425	58426	58412	58412	I	0	" "
58431	58439	58412	58412	I	0	" persisted Lisbeth , beginning to cry , "
58510	58511	58496	58496	He	128	" "
58522	58539	58540	58540	Mother	185	" said Seth , gently , though his voice told that he spoke with some effort ; "
58559	58695	58546	58546	I	0	" He passed into the workshop immediately , followed by Adam ; while Lisbeth , automatically obeying her old habits , began to put away the breakfast things , as if she did not mean Dinah to take her place any longer . Dinah said nothing , but presently used the opportunity of quietly joining the brothers in the workshop . They had already got on their aprons and paper caps , and Adam was standing with his left hand on Seth 's shoulder , while he pointed with the hammer in his right to some boards which they were looking at . Their backs were turned towards the door by which Dinah entered , and she came in so gently that they were not aware of her presence till they heard her voice saying , "
58699	58733	58734	58734	I	0	" Seth started , and they both turned round . Dinah looked as if she did not see Adam , and fixed her eyes on Seth 's face , saying with calm kindness , "
58768	58769	58771	58771	you	128	" "
58794	58813	58814	58814	You	128	" There was a little tremor in Seth 's voice . Dinah put out her hand and said , "
58840	58886	58887	58887	I	0	" She turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly as she had entered it . Adam had been observing her closely all the while , but she had not looked at him . As soon as she was gone , he said , "
58908	58943	58899	58899	She	1712	" Seth 's soul rushed to his eyes and lips : he had never yet confessed his secret to Adam , but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment , as he answered , "
58992	58993	58977	58977	She	1712	" "
59057	59079	59048	59048	she	1712	" No more was said . Seth set out to the village , and Adam began his work on the coffin . "
59089	59099	59080	59080	God	135	" he thought , as he lifted the board . "
59193	59295	59296	59296	I	0	" Chapter XII In the Wood THAT same Thursday morning , as Arthur Donnithorne was moving about in his dressing - room seeing his well - looking British person reflected in the old - fashioned mirrors , and stared at , from a dingy olive - green piece of tapestry , by Pharaoh 's daughter and her maidens , who ought to have been minding the infant Moses , he was holding a discussion with himself , which , by the time his valet was tying the black silk sling over his shoulder , had issued in a distinct practical resolution . "
59310	59315	59296	59296	I	0	" he said aloud . "
59340	59385	59316	59316	I	0	" The low whistle , which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution , here broke out into his loudest ringing tenor , and the corridor , as he hurried along it , echoed to his favourite song from the Beggar 's Opera , "
59397	59561	59316	59316	I	0	" Not an heroic strain ; nevertheless Arthur felt himself very heroic as he strode towards the stables to give his orders about the horses . His own approbation was necessary to him , and it was not an approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously ; it must be won by a fair amount of merit . He had never yet forfeited that approbation , and he had considerable reliance on his own virtues . No young man could confess his faults more candidly ; candour was one of his favourite virtues ; and how can a man 's candour be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of ? But he had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous kind - impetuous , warm - blooded , leonine ; never crawling , crafty , reptilian . It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything mean , dastardly , or cruel . "
59592	59849	59850	59852	a good fellow	1730	" Unhappily , there is no inherent poetical justice in hobbles , and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their worst consequences on the prime offender , in spite of his loudly expressed wish . It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme of things that Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides himself . He was nothing if not good - natured ; and all his pictures of the future , when he should come into the estate , were made up of a prosperous , contented tenantry , adoring their landlord , who would be the model of an English gentleman - mansion in first - rate order , all elegance and high taste - jolly housekeeping , finest stud in Loamshire - purse open to all public objects - in short , everything as different as possible from what was now associated with the name of Donnithorne . And one of the first good actions he would perform in that future should be to increase Irwine 's income for the vicarage of Hayslope , so that he might keep a carriage for his mother and sisters . His hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and trousers . It was an affection partly filial , partly fraternal - fraternal enough to make him like Irwine 's company better than that of most younger men , and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from incurring Irwine 's disapprobation . You perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was "
59853	60114	60569	60569	You	1731	" - all his college friends thought him such . He could n't bear to see any one uncomfortable ; he would have been sorry even in his angriest moods for any harm to happen to his grandfather ; and his Aunt Lydia herself had the benefit of that soft - heartedness which he bore towards the whole sex . Whether he would have self - mastery enough to be always as harmless and purely beneficent as his good - nature led him to desire , was a question that no one had yet decided against him ; he was but twenty - one , you remember , and we do n't inquire too closely into character in the case of a handsome generous young fellow , who will have property enough to support numerous peccadilloes - who , if he should unfortunately break a man 's legs in his rash driving , will be able to pension him handsomely ; or if he should happen to spoil a woman 's existence for her , will make it up to her with expensive bon - bons , packed up and directed by his own hand . It would be ridiculous to be prying and analytic in such cases , as if one were inquiring into the character of a confidential clerk . We use round , general , gentlemanly epithets about a young man of birth and fortune ; and ladies , with that fine intuition which is the distinguishing attribute of their sex , see at once that he is "
60117	60175	60569	60569	You	1731	" The chances are that he will go through life without scandalizing any one ; a seaworthy vessel that no one would refuse to insure . Ships , certainly , are liable to casualties , which sometimes make terribly evident some flaw in their construction that would never have been discoverable in smooth water ; and many a "
60179	60568	60569	60569	You	1731	" through a disastrous combination of circumstances , has undergone a like betrayal . But we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable auguries concerning Arthur Donnithorne , who this morning proves himself capable of a prudent resolution founded on conscience . One thing is clear : Nature has taken care that he shall never go far astray with perfect comfort and satisfaction to himself ; he will never get beyond that border - land of sin , where he will be perpetually harassed by assaults from the other side of the boundary . He will never be a courtier of Vice , and wear her orders in his button - hole . It was about ten o'clock , and the sun was shining brilliantly ; everything was looking lovelier for the yesterday 's rain . It is a pleasant thing on such a morning to walk along the well - rolled gravel on one 's way to the stables , meditating an excursion . But the scent of the stables , which , in a natural state of things , ought to be among the soothing influences of a man 's life , always brought with it some irritation to Arthur . There was no having his own way in the stables ; everything was managed in the stingiest fashion . His grandfather persisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt whom no sort of lever could move out of his old habits , and who was allowed to hire a succession of raw Loamshire lads as his subordinates , one of whom had lately tested a new pair of shears by clipping an oblong patch on Arthur 's bay mare . This state of things is naturally embittering ; one can put up with annoyances in the house , but to have the stable made a scene of vexation and disgust is a point beyond what human flesh and blood can be expected to endure long together without danger of misanthropy . Old John 's wooden , deep - wrinkled face was the first object that met Arthur 's eyes as he entered the stable - yard , and it quite poisoned for him the bark of the two bloodhounds that kept watch there . He could never speak quite patiently to the old blockhead . "
60604	60605	60601	60601	you	1731	" "
60616	60736	60611	60611	I	0	" said old John very deliberately , following the young master into the stable . John considered a young master as the natural enemy of an old servant , and young people in general as a poor contrivance for carrying on the world . Arthur went in for the sake of patting Meg , declining as far as possible to see anything in the stables , lest he should lose his temper before breakfast . The pretty creature was in one of the inner stables , and turned her mild head as her master came beside her . Little Trot , a tiny spaniel , her inseparable companion in the stable , was comfortably curled up on her back . "
60745	60753	60739	60739	Meg	277	" said Arthur , patting her neck , "
60763	60764	60739	60739	Meg	277	" "
60778	60782	60770	60770	I	0	" said John . "
60789	60790	60767	60767	your	277	" "
60798	60799	60800	60800	Lamed	281	" "
60810	60811	60807	60807	you	277	" "
60850	60876	60838	60838	she	277	" The judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what ensued . You understand that there was a great deal of strong language , mingled with soothing "
60881	61076	60838	60838	she	277	" while the leg was examined ; that John stood by with quite as much emotion as if he had been a cunningly carved crab - tree walking - stick , and that Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed the iron gates of the pleasure - ground without singing as he went . He considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed . There was not another mount in the stable for himself and his servant besides Meg and Rattler . It was vexatious ; just when he wanted to get out of the way for a week or two . It seemed culpable in Providence to allow such a combination of circumstances . To be shut up at the Chase with a broken arm when every other fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at Windsor - shut up with his grandfather , who had the same sort of affection for him as for his parchment deeds ! And to be disgusted at every turn with the management of the house and the estate ! In such circumstances a man necessarily gets in an ill humour , and works off the irritation by some excess or other . "
61088	61094	60838	60838	she	277	" he muttered to himself , "
61132	61365	61130	61130	Gawaine	284	" Behind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one . If he lunched with Gawaine and lingered chatting , he should not reach the Chase again till nearly five , when Hetty would be safe out of his sight in the housekeeper 's room ; and when she set out to go home , it would be his lazy time after dinner , so he should keep out of her way altogether . There really would have been no harm in being kind to the little thing , and it was worth dancing with a dozen ballroom belles only to look at Hetty for half an hour . But perhaps he had better not take any more notice of her ; it might put notions into her head , as Irwine had hinted ; though Arthur , for his part , thought girls were not by any means so soft and easily bruised ; indeed , he had generally found them twice as cool and cunning as he was himself . As for any real harm in Hetty 's case , it was out of the question : Arthur Donnithorne accepted his own bond for himself with perfect confidence . So the twelve o'clock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne ; and by good fortune Halsell Common lay in his road and gave him some fine leaps for Rattler . Nothing like "
61367	61532	61533	61534	The cap'n	1736	" a few bushes and ditches for exorcising a demon ; and it is really astonishing that the Centaurs , with their immense advantages in this way , have left so bad a reputation in history . After this , you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although Gawaine was at home , the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared the last stroke of three when Arthur returned through the entrance - gates , got down from the panting Rattler , and went into the house to take a hasty luncheon . But I believe there have been men since his day who have ridden a long way to avoid a rencontre , and then galloped hastily back lest they should miss it . It is the favourite stratagem of our passions to sham a retreat , and to turn sharp round upon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our own . "
61545	61574	61533	61534	The cap'n	1736	" said Dalton the coachman , whose person stood out in high relief as he smoked his pipe against the stable wall , when John brought up Rattler . "
61590	61594	61579	61579	he	1737	" growled John . "
61610	61876	61597	61597	he	1737	" observed Dalton - and the joke appeared to him so good that , being left alone upon the scene , he continued at intervals to take his pipe from his mouth in order to wink at an imaginary audience and shake luxuriously with a silent , ventral laughter , mentally rehearsing the dialogue from the beginning , that he might recite it with effect in the servants ' hall . When Arthur went up to his dressing - room again after luncheon , it was inevitable that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the day should flash across his mind ; but it was impossible for him now to dwell on the remembrance - impossible to recall the feelings and reflections which had been decisive with him then , any more than to recall the peculiar scent of the air that had freshened him when he first opened his window . The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like an ill - stemmed current ; he was amazed himself at the force with which this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him : he was even rather tremulous as he brushed his hair - pooh ! it was riding in that break - neck way . It was because he had made a serious affair of an idle matter , by thinking of it as if it were of any consequence . He would amuse himself by seeing Hetty to - day , and get rid of the whole thing from his mind . It was all Irwine 's fault . "
61899	62776	61883	61883	I	0	" However , it was just the sort of day for lolling in the Hermitage , and he would go and finish Dr. Moore 's Zeluco there before dinner . The Hermitage stood in Fir - tree Grove - the way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall Farm . So nothing could be simpler and more natural : meeting Hetty was a mere circumstance of his walk , not its object . Arthur 's shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of the Chase than might have been expected from the shadow of a tired man on a warm afternoon , and it was still scarcely four o'clock when he stood before the tall narrow gate leading into the delicious labyrinthine wood which skirted one side of the Chase , and which was called Fir - tree Grove , not because the firs were many , but because they were few . It was a wood of beeches and limes , with here and there a light silver - stemmed birch - just the sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs : you see their white sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs , or peeping from behind the smooth - sweeping outline of a tall lime ; you hear their soft liquid laughter - but if you look with a too curious sacrilegious eye , they vanish behind the silvery beeches , they make you believe that their voice was only a running brooklet , perhaps they metamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel that scampers away and mocks you from the topmost bough . It was not a grove with measured grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon , but with narrow , hollow - shaped , earthy paths , edged with faint dashes of delicate moss - paths which look as if they were made by the free will of the trees and underwood , moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen of the white - footed nymphs . It was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne passed , under an avenue of limes and beeches . It was a still afternoon - the golden light was lingering languidly among the upper boughs , only glancing down here and there on the purple pathway and its edge of faintly sprinkled moss : an afternoon in which destiny disguises her cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil , encloses us in warm downy wings , and poisons us with violet - scented breath . Arthur strolled along carelessly , with a book under his arm , but not looking on the ground as meditative men are apt to do ; his eyes WOULD fix themselves on the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely appear before long . Ah ! There she comes . First a bright patch of colour , like a tropic bird among the boughs ; then a tripping figure , with a round hat on , and a small basket under her arm ; then a deep - blushing , almost frightened , but bright - smiling girl , making her curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance , as Arthur came up to her . If Arthur had had time to think at all , he would have thought it strange that he should feel fluttered too , be conscious of blushing too - in fact , look and feel as foolish as if he had been taken by surprise instead of meeting just what he expected . Poor things ! It was a pity they were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have stood face to face , eyeing each other with timid liking , then given each other a little butterfly kiss , and toddled off to play together . Arthur would have gone home to his silk - curtained cot , and Hetty to her home - spun pillow , and both would have slept without dreams , and to - morrow would have been a life hardly conscious of a yesterday . Arthur turned round and walked by Hetty 's side without giving a reason . They were alone together for the first time . What an overpowering presence that first privacy is ! He actually dared not look at this little butter - maker for the first minute or two . As for Hetty , her feet rested on a cloud , and she was borne along by warm zephyrs ; she had forgotten her rose - coloured ribbons ; she was no more conscious of her limbs than if her childish soul had passed into a water - lily , resting on a liquid bed and warmed by the midsummer sun - beams . It may seem a contradiction , but Arthur gathered a certain carelessness and confidence from his timidity : it was an entirely different state of mind from what he had expected in such a meeting with Hetty ; and full as he was of vague feeling , there was room , in those moments of silence , for the thought that his previous debates and scruples were needless . "
62791	62802	62777	62777	You	1740	" he said at last , looking down at Hetty ; "
62820	62821	62824	62824	sir	5336	" "
62826	62865	62824	62824	sir	5336	" Hetty answered , with a tremulous , almost whispering voice . She did n't know one bit how to speak to a gentleman like Mr. Arthur , and her very vanity made her more coy of speech . "
62876	62877	62880	62880	sir	5336	" "
62897	62898	62887	62887	she	249	" "
62909	62910	62907	62907	she	249	" "
62955	62956	62947	62947	she	249	" "
62969	62970	62960	62960	YOU	5336	" "
62981	63011	63012	63012	I	0	" Hetty spoke more audibly now , but still rather tremulously ; she thought , perhaps she seemed as stupid to Captain Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to her . "
63023	63024	63025	63025	She	249	" "
63067	63068	63061	63062	Miss Donnithorne	266	" "
63096	63097	63091	63091	you	5336	" "
63102	63103	63091	63091	you	5336	" "
63139	63140	63145	63145	sir	5336	" "
63147	63148	63145	63145	sir	5336	" "
63171	63172	63145	63145	sir	5336	" "
63217	63218	63201	63202	My aunt	701	" "
63232	63243	63247	63247	he	265	" A deep blush overspread Hetty 's face and neck . "
63270	63339	63264	63264	I	0	" she said hastily , and the tears of vexation had come so fast that before she had done speaking a bright drop rolled down her hot cheek . Then she felt ashamed to death that she was crying , and for one long instant her happiness was all gone . But in the next she felt an arm steal round her , and a gentle voice said , "
63390	63720	63384	63384	you	177	" Arthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him , and was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty . Hetty lifted her long dewy lashes , and met the eyes that were bent towards her with a sweet , timid , beseeching look . What a space of time those three moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her ! Love is such a simple thing when we have only one - and - twenty summers and a sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance , as if she were a bud first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning . Such young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches that touch softly and are at rest ; they mingle as easily as two brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple with ever - interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding - places . While Arthur gazed into Hetty 's dark beseeching eyes , it made no difference to him what sort of English she spoke ; and even if hoops and powder had been in fashion , he would very likely not have been sensible just then that Hetty wanted those signs of high breeding . But they started asunder with beating hearts : something had fallen on the ground with a rattling noise ; it was Hetty 's basket ; all her little workwoman 's matters were scattered on the path , some of them showing a capability of rolling to great lengths . There was much to be done in picking up , and not a word was spoken ; but when Arthur hung the basket over her arm again , the poor child felt a strange difference in his look and manner . He just pressed her hand , and said , with a look and tone that were almost chilling to her , "
63748	64505	63736	63736	You	1756	" Without waiting for her to speak , he turned away from her and hurried back towards the road that led to the Hermitage , leaving Hetty to pursue her way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in bewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness . Would he meet her again as she came home ? Why had he spoken almost as if he were displeased with her ? And then run away so suddenly ? She cried , hardly knowing why . Arthur too was very uneasy , but his feelings were lit up for him by a more distinct consciousness . He hurried to the Hermitage , which stood in the heart of the wood , unlocked the door with a hasty wrench , slammed it after him , pitched Zeluco into the most distant corner , and thrusting his right hand into his pocket , first walked four or five times up and down the scanty length of the little room , and then seated himself on the ottoman in an uncomfortable stiff way , as we often do when we wish not to abandon ourselves to feeling . He was getting in love with Hetty - that was quite plain . He was ready to pitch everything else - no matter where - for the sake of surrendering himself to this delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself . It was no use blinking the fact now - they would get too fond of each other , if he went on taking notice of her - and what would come of it ? He should have to go away in a few weeks , and the poor little thing would be miserable . He MUST NOT see her alone again ; he must keep out of her way . What a fool he was for coming back from Gawaine 's ! He got up and threw open the windows , to let in the soft breath of the afternoon , and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt round the Hermitage . The soft air did not help his resolution , as he leaned out and looked into the leafy distance . But he considered his resolution sufficiently fixed : there was no need to debate with himself any longer . He had made up his mind not to meet Hetty again ; and now he might give himself up to thinking how immensely agreeable it would be if circumstances were different - how pleasant it would have been to meet her this evening as she came back , and put his arm round her again and look into her sweet face . He wondered if the dear little thing were thinking of him too - twenty to one she was . How beautiful her eyes were with the tear on their lashes ! He would like to satisfy his soul for a day with looking at them , and he MUST see her again - he must see her , simply to remove any false impression from her mind about his manner to her just now . He would behave in a quiet , kind way to her - just to prevent her from going home with her head full of wrong fancies . Yes , that would be the best thing to do after all . It was a long while - more than an hour before Arthur had brought his meditations to this point ; but once arrived there , he could stay no longer at the Hermitage . The time must be filled up with movement until he should see Hetty again . And it was already late enough to go and dress for dinner , for his grandfather 's dinner - hour was six . Chapter XIII Evening in the Wood IT happened that Mrs. Pomfret had had a slight quarrel with Mrs. Best , the housekeeper , on this Thursday morning - a fact which had two consequences highly convenient to Hetty . It caused Mrs. Pomfret to have tea sent up to her own room , and it inspired that exemplary lady 's maid with so lively a recollection of former passages in Mrs. Best 's conduct , and of dialogues in which Mrs. Best had decidedly the inferiority as an interlocutor with Mrs. Pomfret , that Hetty required no more presence of mind than was demanded for using her needle , and throwing in an occasional "
64507	64509	64703	64705	such pretty wives	1761	" or "
64512	64651	64703	64705	such pretty wives	1761	" She would have wanted to put on her hat earlier than usual ; only she had told Captain Donnithorne that she usually set out about eight o'clock , and if he SHOULD go to the Grove again expecting to see her , and she should be gone ! Would he come ? Her little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory and dubious expectation . At last the minute - hand of the old - fashioned brazen - faced timepiece was on the last quarter to eight , and there was every reason for its being time to get ready for departure . Even Mrs. Pomfret 's preoccupied mind did not prevent her from noticing what looked like a new flush of beauty in the little thing as she tied on her hat before the looking - glass . "
64665	64671	64652	64653	That child	1758	" was her inward comment . "
64799	65537	64778	64778	them	1763	" Hetty walked hastily across the short space of pleasure - ground which she had to traverse , dreading to meet Mr. Craig , to whom she could hardly have spoken civilly . How relieved she was when she had got safely under the oaks and among the fern of the Chase ! Even then she was as ready to be startled as the deer that leaped away at her approach . She thought nothing of the evening light that lay gently in the grassy alleys between the fern , and made the beauty of their living green more visible than it had been in the overpowering flood of noon : she thought of nothing that was present . She only saw something that was possible : Mr. Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again along the Fir - tree Grove . That was the foreground of Hetty 's picture ; behind it lay a bright hazy something - days that were not to be as the other days of her life had been . It was as if she had been wooed by a river - god , who might any time take her to his wondrous halls below a watery heaven . There was no knowing what would come , since this strange entrancing delight had come . If a chest full of lace and satin and jewels had been sent her from some unknown source , how could she but have thought that her whole lot was going to change , and that to - morrow some still more bewildering joy would befall her ? Hetty had never read a novel ; if she had ever seen one , I think the words would have been too hard for her ; how then could she find a shape for her expectations ? They were as formless as the sweet languid odours of the garden at the Chase , which had floated past her as she walked by the gate . She is at another gate now - that leading into Fir - tree Grove . She enters the wood , where it is already twilight , and at every step she takes , the fear at her heart becomes colder . If he should not come ! Oh , how dreary it was - the thought of going out at the other end of the wood , into the unsheltered road , without having seen him . She reaches the first turning towards the Hermitage , walking slowly - he is not there . She hates the leveret that runs across the path ; she hates everything that is not what she longs for . She walks on , happy whenever she is coming to a bend in the road , for perhaps he is behind it . No . She is beginning to cry : her heart has swelled so , the tears stand in her eyes ; she gives one great sob , while the corners of her mouth quiver , and the tears roll down . She does n't know that there is another turning to the Hermitage , that she is close against it , and that Arthur Donnithorne is only a few yards from her , full of one thought , and a thought of which she only is the object . He is going to see Hetty again : that is the longing which has been growing through the last three hours to a feverish thirst . Not , of course , to speak in the caressing way into which he had unguardedly fallen before dinner , but to set things right with her by a kindness which would have the air of friendly civility , and prevent her from running away with wrong notions about their mutual relation . If Hetty had known he was there , she would not have cried ; and it would have been better , for then Arthur would perhaps have behaved as wisely as he had intended . As it was , she started when he appeared at the end of the side - alley , and looked up at him with two great drops rolling down her cheeks . What else could he do but speak to her in a soft , soothing tone , as if she were a bright - eyed spaniel with a thorn in her foot ? "
65566	65606	65558	65558	I	0	" Hetty was blushing so , she did n't know whether she was happy or miserable . To be crying again - what did gentlemen think of girls who cried in that way ? She felt unable even to say "
65609	65645	65558	65558	I	0	" but could only look away from him and wipe the tears from her cheek . Not before a great drop had fallen on her rose - coloured strings - she knew that quite well . "
65669	65679	65680	65680	I	0	" Hetty turned her head towards him , whispered , "
65687	65721	65722	65722	You	0	" and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him . That look was too much : he must have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too lovingly in return . "
65749	65948	65747	65747	you	0	" Ah , he does n't know in the least what he is saying . This is not what he meant to say . His arm is stealing round the waist again ; it is tightening its clasp ; he is bending his face nearer and nearer to the round cheek ; his lips are meeting those pouting child - lips , and for a long moment time has vanished . He may be a shepherd in Arcadia for aught he knows , he may be the first youth kissing the first maiden , he may be Eros himself , sipping the lips of Psyche - it is all one . There was no speaking for minutes after . They walked along with beating hearts till they came within sight of the gate at the end of the wood . Then they looked at each other , not quite as they had looked before , for in their eyes there was the memory of a kiss . But already something bitter had begun to mingle itself with the fountain of sweets : already Arthur was uncomfortable . He took his arm from Hetty 's waist , and said , "
65968	65977	65961	65961	I	0	" he added , pulling out his watch . "
66018	66058	66928	66928	her	0	" He took her hand , and looked at her half - sadly , half with a constrained smile . Hetty 's eyes seemed to beseech him not to go away yet ; but he patted her cheek and said "
66062	66917	66928	66928	her	0	" again . She was obliged to turn away from him and go on . As for Arthur , he rushed back through the wood , as if he wanted to put a wide space between himself and Hetty . He would not go to the Hermitage again ; he remembered how he had debated with himself there before dinner , and it had all come to nothing - worse than nothing . He walked right on into the Chase , glad to get out of the Grove , which surely was haunted by his evil genius . Those beeches and smooth limes - there was something enervating in the very sight of them ; but the strong knotted old oaks had no bending languor in them - the sight of them would give a man some energy . Arthur lost himself among the narrow openings in the fern , winding about without seeking any issue , till the twilight deepened almost to night under the great boughs , and the hare looked black as it darted across his path . He was feeling much more strongly than he had done in the morning : it was as if his horse had wheeled round from a leap and dared to dispute his mastery . He was dissatisfied with himself , irritated , mortified . He no sooner fixed his mind on the probable consequences of giving way to the emotions which had stolen over him to - day - of continuing to notice Hetty , of allowing himself any opportunity for such slight caresses as he had been betrayed into already - than he refused to believe such a future possible for himself . To flirt with Hetty was a very different affair from flirting with a pretty girl of his own station : that was understood to be an amusement on both sides , or , if it became serious , there was no obstacle to marriage . But this little thing would be spoken ill of directly , if she happened to be seen walking with him ; and then those excellent people , the Poysers , to whom a good name was as precious as if they had the best blood in the land in their veins - he should hate himself if he made a scandal of that sort , on the estate that was to be his own some day , and among tenants by whom he liked , above all , to be respected . He could no more believe that he should so fall in his own esteem than that he should break both his legs and go on crutches all the rest of his life . He could n't imagine himself in that position ; it was too odious , too unlike him . And even if no one knew anything about it , they might get too fond of each other , and then there could be nothing but the misery of parting , after all . No gentleman , out of a ballad , could marry a farmer 's niece . There must be an end to the whole thing at once . It was too foolish . And yet he had been so determined this morning , before he went to Gawaine 's ; and while he was there something had taken hold of him and made him gallop back . It seemed he could n't quite depend on his own resolution , as he had thought he could ; he almost wished his arm would get painful again , and then he should think of nothing but the comfort it would be to get rid of the pain . There was no knowing what impulse might seize him to - morrow , in this confounded place , where there was nothing to occupy him imperiously through the livelong day . What could he do to secure himself from any more of this folly ? There was but one resource . He would go and tell Irwine - tell him everything . The mere act of telling it would make it seem trivial ; the temptation would vanish , as the charm of fond words vanishes when one repeats them to the indifferent . In every way it would help him to tell Irwine . He would ride to Broxton Rectory the first thing after breakfast to - morrow . Arthur had no sooner come to this determination than he began to think which of the paths would lead him home , and made as short a walk thither as he could . He felt sure he should sleep now : he had had enough to tire him , and there was no more need for him to think . Chapter XIV The Return Home WHILE that parting in the wood was happening , there was a parting in the cottage too , and Lisbeth had stood with Adam at the door , straining her aged eyes to get the last glimpse of Seth and Dinah , as they mounted the opposite slope . "
66930	66944	66920	66920	I	0	" she said to Adam , as they turned into the house again . "
67045	67046	67049	67049	Mother	185	" "
67083	67084	67073	67073	she	0	" "
67172	67173	67168	67169	Seth allays	128	" "
67178	67184	67185	67186	the figures	1777	" said Adam , laughing , "
67295	67296	67282	67282	You	1783	" "
67425	67622	67623	67624	Seth Bede	128	" To the feminine mind in some of its moods , all things that might be receive a temporary charm from comparison with what is ; and since Adam did not want to marry Dinah himself , Lisbeth felt rather peevish on that score - as peevish as she would have been if he HAD wanted to marry her , and so shut himself out from Mary Burge and the partnership as effectually as by marrying Hetty . It was more than half - past eight when Adam and his mother were talking in this way , so that when , about ten minutes later , Hetty reached the turning of the lane that led to the farmyard gate , she saw Dinah and Seth approaching it from the opposite direction , and waited for them to come up to her . They , too , like Hetty , had lingered a little in their walk , for Dinah was trying to speak words of comfort and strength to Seth in these parting moments . But when they saw Hetty , they paused and shook hands ; Seth turned homewards , and Dinah came on alone . "
67636	67645	67623	67624	Seth Bede	128	" she said , as she reached Hetty , "
67657	67984	67647	67647	he	128	" Hetty answered with a dimpled smile , as if she did not quite know what had been said ; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling self - engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah 's calm pitying face , with its open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets of its own , but in feelings which it longed to share with all the world . Hetty liked Dinah as well as she had ever liked any woman ; how was it possible to feel otherwise towards one who always put in a kind word for her when her aunt was finding fault , and who was always ready to take Totty off her hands - little tiresome Totty , that was made such a pet of by every one , and that Hetty could see no interest in at all ? Dinah had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty during her whole visit to the Hall Farm ; she had talked to her a great deal in a serious way , but Hetty did n't mind that much , for she never listened : whatever Dinah might say , she almost always stroked Hetty 's cheek after it , and wanted to do some mending for her . Dinah was a riddle to her ; Hetty looked at her much in the same way as one might imagine a little perching bird that could only flutter from bough to bough , to look at the swoop of the swallow or the mounting of the lark ; but she did not care to solve such riddles , any more than she cared to know what was meant by the pictures in the Pilgrim 's Progress , or in the old folio Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a Sunday . Dinah took her hand now and drew it under her own arm . "
67996	68000	67985	67985	You	1793	" she said . "
68163	68174	68157	68157	you	1799	" She paused a moment , but Hetty said nothing . "
68185	68190	68209	68209	They	1800	" Dinah went on , "
68365	68366	68363	68363	Hetty	177	" "
68369	68994	68363	68363	Hetty	177	" said Hetty abstractedly , for her mind had been all the while in the wood , and she would have found it difficult to say what she was assenting to . Dinah saw she was not inclined to talk , but there would not have been time to say much more , for they were now at the yard - gate . The still twilight , with its dying western red and its few faint struggling stars , rested on the farm - yard , where there was not a sound to be heard but the stamping of the cart - horses in the stable . It was about twenty minutes after sunset . The fowls were all gone to roost , and the bull - dog lay stretched on the straw outside his kennel , with the black - and - tan terrier by his side , when the falling - to of the gate disturbed them and set them barking , like good officials , before they had any distinct knowledge of the reason . The barking had its effect in the house , for , as Dinah and Hetty approached , the doorway was filled by a portly figure , with a ruddy black - eyed face which bore in it the possibility of looking extremely acute , and occasionally contemptuous , on market - days , but had now a predominant after - supper expression of hearty good - nature . It is well known that great scholars who have shown the most pitiless acerbity in their criticism of other men 's scholarship have yet been of a relenting and indulgent temper in private life ; and I have heard of a learned man meekly rocking the twins in the cradle with his left hand , while with his right he inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who had betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew . Weaknesses and errors must be forgiven - alas ! they are not alien to us - but the man who takes the wrong side on the momentous subject of the Hebrew points must be treated as the enemy of his race . There was the same sort of antithetic mixture in Martin Poyser : he was of so excellent a disposition that he had been kinder and more respectful than ever to his old father since he had made a deed of gift of all his property , and no man judged his neighbours more charitably on all personal matters ; but for a farmer , like Luke Britton , for example , whose fallows were not well cleaned , who did n't know the rudiments of hedging and ditching , and showed but a small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock , Martin Poyser was as hard and implacable as the north - east wind . Luke Britton could not make a remark , even on the weather , but Martin Poyser detected in it a taint of that unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable in all his farming operations . He hated to see the fellow lift the pewter pint to his mouth in the bar of the Royal George on market - day , and the mere sight of him on the other side of the road brought a severe and critical expression into his black eyes , as different as possible from the fatherly glance he bent on his two nieces as they approached the door . Mr. Poyser had smoked his evening pipe , and now held his hands in his pockets , as the only resource of a man who continues to sit up after the day 's business is done . "
69006	69021	68999	68999	ye're	1812	" he said , when they reached the little gate leading into the causeway . "
69076	69077	69063	69063	He	6335	" "
69089	69093	69078	69078	She	5304	" said Dinah , "
69175	69176	69162	69162	she	5304	" "
69182	69192	69177	69177	Adam	127	" said Mr. Poyser , misunderstanding Dinah 's wish . "
69261	69270	69271	69271	I	0	" he added , making way for them ; "
69282	69333	69271	69271	I	0	" The tall buildings round the yard shut out a good deal of the sky , but the large window let in abundant light to show every corner of the house - place . Mrs. Poyser , seated in the rocking - chair , which had been brought out of the "
69339	69570	69271	69271	I	0	" was trying to soothe Totty to sleep . But Totty was not disposed to sleep ; and when her cousins entered , she raised herself up and showed a pair of flushed cheeks , which looked fatter than ever now they were defined by the edge of her linen night - cap . In the large wicker - bottomed arm - chair in the left - hand chimney - nook sat old Martin Poyser , a hale but shrunken and bleached image of his portly black - haired son - his head hanging forward a little , and his elbows pushed backwards so as to allow the whole of his forearm to rest on the arm of the chair . His blue handkerchief was spread over his knees , as was usual indoors , when it was not hanging over his head ; and he sat watching what went forward with the quiet OUTWARD glance of healthy old age , which , disengaged from any interest in an inward drama , spies out pins upon the floor , follows one 's minutest motions with an unexpectant purposeless tenacity , watches the flickering of the flame or the sun - gleams on the wall , counts the quarries on the floor , watches even the hand of the clock , and pleases itself with detecting a rhythm in the tick . "
69585	69590	69583	69583	Hetty	177	" said Mrs. Poyser . "
69759	69760	69761	69761	I	0	" "
69770	69787	69761	69761	I	0	" said Hetty , in a pettish tone , with a slight toss of her head . "
69815	69816	69832	69832	you	0	" "
69883	69970	69973	69973	munny	1834	" The fact was , Hetty had really forgotten the difference of the clocks when she told Captain Donnithorne that she set out at eight , and this , with her lingering pace , had made her nearly half an hour later than usual . But here her aunt 's attention was diverted from this tender subject by Totty , who , perceiving at length that the arrival of her cousins was not likely to bring anything satisfactory to her in particular , began to cry , "
69975	69981	69973	69973	munny	1834	" in an explosive manner . "
70012	70043	69973	69973	munny	1834	" said Mrs. Poyser , leaning back and rocking the chair , while she tried to make Totty nestle against her . But Totty only cried louder , and said , "
70048	70091	69973	69973	munny	1834	" So the mother , with that wondrous patience which love gives to the quickest temperament , sat up again , and pressed her cheek against the linen night - cap and kissed it , and forgot to scold Hetty any longer . "
70096	70106	70094	70094	Hetty	177	" said Martin Poyser , in a conciliatory tone , "
70178	70179	70156	70156	I	0	" "
70187	70191	70185	70185	Uncle	1842	" said Dinah ; "
70214	70215	70203	70204	Mrs. Bede	291	" "
70223	70232	70216	70216	I	0	" said Hetty , taking off her hat . "
70244	70245	70240	70240	Aunt	1843	" "
70255	70260	70240	70240	Aunt	1843	" said Mrs. Poyser . "
70318	70337	70360	70360	i	0	" Hetty complied silently by going towards the pantry , and Mrs. Poyser went on speaking to Dinah . "

70735	70756	70733	70733	Rachel	179	" said Mr. Poyser , as his wife seemed to hesitate , seeing that Totty was at last nestling quietly , "

70810	70852	70797	70797	she	242	" said Mrs. Poyser . Hetty went close to the rocking - chair , and stood without her usual smile , and without any attempt to entice Totty , simply waiting for her aunt to give the child into her hands . "
70886	70943	70872	70872	Totty	242	" Before her mother had done speaking , Totty had given her answer in an unmistakable manner , by knitting her brow , setting her tiny teeth against her underlip , and leaning forward to slap Hetty on the arm with her utmost force . Then , without speaking , she nestled to her mother again . "
70948	70959	70872	70872	Totty	242	" said Mr. Poyser , while Hetty stood without moving , "

71019	71070	71013	71013	she	242	" Dinah , having taken off her bonnet and shawl , had hitherto kept quietly seated in the background , not liking to thrust herself between Hetty and what was considered Hetty 's proper work . But now she came forward , and , putting out her arms , said , "
71102	71178	71095	71095	she	242	" Totty turned her face towards Dinah , and looked at her an instant , then lifted herself up , put out her little arms , and let Dinah lift her from her mother 's lap . Hetty turned away without any sign of ill humour , and , taking her hat from the table , stood waiting with an air of indifference , to see if she should be told to do anything else . "
71198	71214	71189	71189	Alick	230	" said Mrs. Poyser , rising with an appearance of relief from her low chair . "
71239	71353	71237	71237	Father	174	" The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors , and old Martin prepared to move , by gathering up his blue handkerchief , and reaching his bright knobbed walnut - tree stick from the corner . Mrs. Poyser then led the way out of the kitchen , followed by the gandfather , and Dinah with Totty in her arms - all going to bed by twilight , like the birds . Mrs. Poyser , on her way , peeped into the room where her two boys lay ; just to see their ruddy round cheeks on the pillow , and to hear for a moment their light regular breathing . "
71362	71380	71356	71356	Hetty	177	" said Mr. Poyser , in a soothing tone , as he himself turned to go upstairs . "
71414	74611	71237	71237	Father	174	" Chapter XV The Two Bed - Chambers HETTY and Dinah both slept in the second story , in rooms adjoining each other , meagrely furnished rooms , with no blinds to shut out the light , which was now beginning to gather new strength from the rising of the moon - more than enough strength to enable Hetty to move about and undress with perfect comfort . She could see quite well the pegs in the old painted linen - press on which she hung her hat and gown ; she could see the head of every pin on her red cloth pin - cushion ; she could see a reflection of herself in the old - fashioned looking - glass , quite as distinct as was needful , considering that she had only to brush her hair and put on her night - cap . A queer old looking - glass ! Hetty got into an ill temper with it almost every time she dressed . It had been considered a handsome glass in its day , and had probably been bought into the Poyser family a quarter of a century before , at a sale of genteel household furniture . Even now an auctioneer could say something for it : it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it ; it had a firm mahogany base , well supplied with drawers , which opened with a decided jerk and sent the contents leaping out from the farthest corners , without giving you the trouble of reaching them ; above all , it had a brass candle - socket on each side , which would give it an aristocratic air to the very last . But Hetty objected to it because it had numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror , which no rubbing would remove , and because , instead of swinging backwards and forwards , it was fixed in an upright position , so that she could only get one good view of her head and neck , and that was to be had only by sitting down on a low chair before her dressing - table . And the dressing - table was no dressing - table at all , but a small old chest of drawers , the most awkward thing in the world to sit down before , for the big brass handles quite hurt her knees , and she could n't get near the glass at all comfortably . But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences to prevent them from performing their religious rites , and Hetty this evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual . Having taken off her gown and white kerchief , she drew a key from the large pocket that hung outside her petticoat , and , unlocking one of the lower drawers in the chest , reached from it two short bits of wax candle - secretly bought at Treddleston - and stuck them in the two brass sockets . Then she drew forth a bundle of matches and lighted the candles ; and last of all , a small red - framed shilling looking - glass , without blotches . It was into this small glass that she chose to look first after seating herself . She looked into it , smiling and turning her head on one side , for a minute , then laid it down and took out her brush and comb from an upper drawer . She was going to let down her hair , and make herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia Donnithorne 's dressing - room . It was soon done , and the dark hyacinthine curves fell on her neck . It was not heavy , massive , merely rippling hair , but soft and silken , running at every opportunity into delicate rings . But she pushed it all backward to look like the picture , and form a dark curtain , throwing into relief her round white neck . Then she put down her brush and comb and looked at herself , folding her arms before her , still like the picture . Even the old mottled glass could n't help sending back a lovely image , none the less lovely because Hetty 's stays were not of white satin - such as I feel sure heroines must generally wear - but of a dark greenish cotton texture . Oh yes ! She was very pretty . Captain Donnithorne thought so . Prettier than anybody about Hayslope - prettier than any of the ladies she had ever seen visiting at the Chase - indeed it seemed fine ladies were rather old and ugly - and prettier than Miss Bacon , the miller 's daughter , who was called the beauty of Treddleston . And Hetty looked at herself to - night with quite a different sensation from what she had ever felt before ; there was an invisible spectator whose eye rested on her like morning on the flowers . His soft voice was saying over and over again those pretty things she had heard in the wood ; his arm was round her , and the delicate rose - scent of his hair was with her still . The vainest woman is never thoroughly conscious of her own beauty till she is loved by the man who sets her own passion vibrating in return . But Hetty seemed to have made up her mind that something was wanting , for she got up and reached an old black lace scarf out of the linen - press , and a pair of large ear - rings out of the sacred drawer from which she had taken her candles . It was an old old scarf , full of rents , but it would make a becoming border round her shoulders , and set off the whiteness of her upper arm . And she would take out the little ear - rings she had in her ears - oh , how her aunt had scolded her for having her ears bored ! - and put in those large ones . They were but coloured glass and gilding , but if you did n't know what they were made of , they looked just as well as what the ladies wore . And so she sat down again , with the large ear - rings in her ears , and the black lace scarf adjusted round her shoulders . She looked down at her arms : no arms could be prettier down to a little way below the elbow - they were white and plump , and dimpled to match her cheeks ; but towards the wrist , she thought with vexation that they were coarsened by butter - making and other work that ladies never did . Captain Donnithorne could n't like her to go on doing work : he would like to see her in nice clothes , and thin shoes , and white stockings , perhaps with silk clocks to them ; for he must love her very much - no one else had ever put his arm round her and kissed her in that way . He would want to marry her and make a lady of her ; she could hardly dare to shape the thought - yet how else could it be ? Marry her quite secretly , as Mr. James , the doctor 's assistant , married the doctor 's niece , and nobody ever found it out for a long while after , and then it was of no use to be angry . The doctor had told her aunt all about it in Hetty 's hearing . She did n't know how it would be , but it was quite plain the old Squire could never be told anything about it , for Hetty was ready to faint with awe and fright if she came across him at the Chase . He might have been earth - born , for what she knew . It had never entered her mind that he had been young like other men ; he had always been the old Squire at whom everybody was frightened . Oh , it was impossible to think how it would be ! But Captain Donnithorne would know ; he was a great gentleman , and could have his way in everything , and could buy everything he liked . And nothing could be as it had been again : perhaps some day she should be a grand lady , and ride in her coach , and dress for dinner in a brocaded silk , with feathers in her hair , and her dress sweeping the ground , like Miss Lydia and Lady Dacey , when she saw them going into the dining - room one evening as she peeped through the little round window in the lobby ; only she should not be old and ugly like Miss Lydia , or all the same thickness like Lady Dacey , but very pretty , with her hair done in a great many different ways , and sometimes in a pink dress , and sometimes in a white one - she did n't know which she liked best ; and Mary Burge and everybody would perhaps see her going out in her carriage - or rather , they would HEAR of it : it was impossible to imagine these things happening at Hayslope in sight of her aunt . At the thought of all this splendour , Hetty got up from her chair , and in doing so caught the little red - framed glass with the edge of her scarf , so that it fell with a bang on the floor ; but she was too eagerly occupied with her vision to care about picking it up ; and after a momentary start , began to pace with a pigeon - like stateliness backwards and forwards along her room , in her coloured stays and coloured skirt , and the old black lace scarf round her shoulders , and the great glass ear - rings in her ears . How pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress ! It would be the easiest folly in the world to fall in love with her : there is such a sweet babylike roundness about her face and figure ; the delicate dark rings of hair lie so charmingly about her ears and neck ; her great dark eyes with their long eye - lashes touch one so strangely , as if an imprisoned frisky sprite looked out of them . Ah , what a prize the man gets who wins a sweet bride like Hetty ! How the men envy him who come to the wedding breakfast , and see her hanging on his arm in her white lace and orange blossoms . The dear , young , round , soft , flexible thing ! Her heart must be just as soft , her temper just as free from angles , her character just as pliant . If anything ever goes wrong , it must be the husband 's fault there : he can make her what he likes - that is plain . And the lover himself thinks so too : the little darling is so fond of him , her little vanities are so bewitching , he would n't consent to her being a bit wiser ; those kittenlike glances and movements are just what one wants to make one 's hearth a paradise . Every man under such circumstances is conscious of being a great physiognomist . Nature , he knows , has a language of her own , which she uses with strict veracity , and he considers himself an adept in the language . Nature has written out his bride 's character for him in those exquisite lines of cheek and lip and chin , in those eyelids delicate as petals , in those long lashes curled like the stamen of a flower , in the dark liquid depths of those wonderful eyes . How she will dote on her children ! She is almost a child herself , and the little pink round things will hang about her like florets round the central flower ; and the husband will look on , smiling benignly , able , whenever he chooses , to withdraw into the sanctuary of his wisdom , towards which his sweet wife will look reverently , and never lift the curtain . It is a marriage such as they made in the golden age , when the men were all wise and majestic and the women all lovely and loving . It was very much in this way that our friend Adam Bede thought about Hetty ; only he put his thoughts into different words . If ever she behaved with cold vanity towards him , he said to himself it is only because she does n't love me well enough ; and he was sure that her love , whenever she gave it , would be the most precious thing a man could possess on earth . Before you despise Adam as deficient in penetration , pray ask yourself if you were ever predisposed to believe evil of any pretty woman - if you ever COULD , without hard head - breaking demonstration , believe evil of the ONE supremely pretty woman who has bewitched you . No : people who love downy peaches are apt not to think of the stone , and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it . Arthur Donnithorne , too , had the same sort of notion about Hetty , so far as he had thought of her nature of all . He felt sure she was a dear , affectionate , good little thing . The man who awakes the wondering tremulous passion of a young girl always thinks her affectionate ; and if he chances to look forward to future years , probably imagines himself being virtuously tender to her , because the poor thing is so clingingly fond of him . God made these dear women so - and it is a convenient arrangement in case of sickness . After all , I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way sometimes , and must think both better and worse of people than they deserve . Nature has her language , and she is not unveracious ; but we do n't know all the intricacies of her syntax just yet , and in a hasty reading we may happen to extract the very opposite of her real meaning . Long dark eyelashes , now - what can be more exquisite ? I find it impossible not to expect some depth of soul behind a deep grey eye with a long dark eyelash , in spite of an experience which has shown me that they may go along with deceit , peculation , and stupidity . But if , in the reaction of disgust , I have betaken myself to a fishy eye , there has been a surprising similarity of result . One begins to suspect at length that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals ; or else , that the eyelashes express the disposition of the fair one 's grandmother , which is on the whole less important to us . No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hetty 's ; and now , while she walks with her pigeon - like stateliness along the room and looks down on her shoulders bordered by the old black lace , the dark fringe shows to perfection on her pink cheek . They are but dim ill - defined pictures that her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future ; but of every picture she is the central figure in fine clothes ; Captain Donnithorne is very close to her , putting his arm round her , perhaps kissing her , and everybody else is admiring and envying her - especially Mary Burge , whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the side of Hetty 's resplendent toilette . Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with this dream of the future - any loving thought of her second parents - of the children she had helped to tend - of any youthful companion , any pet animal , any relic of her own childhood even ? Not one . There are some plants that have hardly any roots : you may tear them from their native nook of rock or wall , and just lay them over your ornamental flower - pot , and they blossom none the worse . Hetty could have cast all her past life behind her and never cared to be reminded of it again . I think she had no feeling at all towards the old house , and did not like the Jacob 's Ladder and the long row of hollyhocks in the garden better than other flowers - perhaps not so well . It was wonderful how little she seemed to care about waiting on her uncle , who had been a good father to her - she hardly ever remembered to reach him his pipe at the right time without being told , unless a visitor happened to be there , who would have a better opportunity of seeing her as she walked across the hearth . Hetty did not understand how anybody could be very fond of middle - aged people . And as for those tiresome children , Marty and Tommy and Totty , they had been the very nuisance of her life - as bad as buzzing insects that will come teasing you on a hot day when you want to be quiet . Marty , the eldest , was a baby when she first came to the farm , for the children born before him had died , and so Hetty had had them all three , one after the other , toddling by her side in the meadow , or playing about her on wet days in the half - empty rooms of the large old house . The boys were out of hand now , but Totty was still a day - long plague , worse than either of the others had been , because there was more fuss made about her . And there was no end to the making and mending of clothes . Hetty would have been glad to hear that she should never see a child again ; they were worse than the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to be taken special care of in lambing time ; for the lambs WERE got rid of sooner or later . As for the young chickens and turkeys , Hetty would have hated the very word "
74614	74819	71237	71237	Father	174	" if her aunt had not bribed her to attend to the young poultry by promising her the proceeds of one out of every brood . The round downy chicks peeping out from under their mother 's wing never touched Hetty with any pleasure ; that was not the sort of prettiness she cared about , but she did care about the prettiness of the new things she would buy for herself at Treddleston Fair with the money they fetched . And yet she looked so dimpled , so charming , as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the hen - coop , that you must have been a very acute personage indeed to suspect her of that hardness . Molly , the housemaid , with a turn - up nose and a protuberant jaw , was really a tender - hearted girl , and , as Mrs. Poyser said , a jewel to look after the poultry ; but her stolid face showed nothing of this maternal delight , any more than a brown earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it . It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral deficiencies hidden under the "
74822	74883	74884	74884	She	1876	" of beauty , so it is not surprising that Mrs. Poyser , with her keenness and abundant opportunity for observation , should have formed a tolerably fair estimate of what might be expected from Hetty in the way of feeling , and in moments of indignation she had sometimes spoken with great openness on the subject to her husband . "
75025	75026	75016	75016	her	177	" "
75031	75036	75016	75016	her	177	" said Mr. Poyser , "
75090	75091	75092	75092	I	0	" "
75260	76554	76664	76664	you	1897	" Hetty stood sufficiently in awe of her aunt to be anxious to conceal from her so much of her vanity as could be hidden without too great a sacrifice . She could not resist spending her money in bits of finery which Mrs. Poyser disapproved ; but she would have been ready to die with shame , vexation , and fright if her aunt had this moment opened the door , and seen her with her bits of candle lighted , and strutting about decked in her scarf and ear - rings . To prevent such a surprise , she always bolted her door , and she had not forgotten to do so to - night . It was well : for there now came a light tap , and Hetty , with a leaping heart , rushed to blow out the candles and throw them into the drawer . She dared not stay to take out her ear - rings , but she threw off her scarf , and let it fall on the floor , before the light tap came again . We shall know how it was that the light tap came , if we leave Hetty for a short time and return to Dinah , at the moment when she had delivered Totty to her mother 's arms , and was come upstairs to her bedroom , adjoining Hetty 's . Dinah delighted in her bedroom window . Being on the second story of that tall house , it gave her a wide view over the fields . The thickness of the wall formed a broad step about a yard below the window , where she could place her chair . And now the first thing she did on entering her room was to seat herself in this chair and look out on the peaceful fields beyond which the large moon was rising , just above the hedgerow elms . She liked the pasture best where the milch cows were lying , and next to that the meadow where the grass was half - mown , and lay in silvered sweeping lines . Her heart was very full , for there was to be only one more night on which she would look out on those fields for a long time to come ; but she thought little of leaving the mere scene , for , to her , bleak Snowfield had just as many charms . She thought of all the dear people whom she had learned to care for among these peaceful fields , and who would now have a place in her loving remembrance for ever . She thought of the struggles and the weariness that might lie before them in the rest of their life 's journey , when she would be away from them , and know nothing of what was befalling them ; and the pressure of this thought soon became too strong for her to enjoy the unresponding stillness of the moonlit fields . She closed her eyes , that she might feel more intensely the presence of a Love and Sympathy deeper and more tender than was breathed from the earth and sky . That was often Dinah 's mode of praying in solitude . Simply to close her eyes and to feel herself enclosed by the Divine Presence ; then gradually her fears , her yearning anxieties for others , melted away like ice - crystals in a warm ocean . She had sat in this way perfectly still , with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light resting on her calm face , for at least ten minutes when she was startled by a loud sound , apparently of something falling in Hetty 's room . But like all sounds that fall on our ears in a state of abstraction , it had no distinct character , but was simply loud and startling , so that she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted it rightly . She rose and listened , but all was quiet afterwards , and she reflected that Hetty might merely have knocked something down in getting into bed . She began slowly to undress ; but now , owing to the suggestions of this sound , her thoughts became concentrated on Hetty - that sweet young thing , with life and all its trials before her - the solemn daily duties of the wife and mother - and her mind so unprepared for them all , bent merely on little foolish , selfish pleasures , like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long toilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness . Dinah felt a double care for Hetty , because she shared Seth 's anxious interest in his brother 's lot , and she had not come to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well enough to marry him . She saw too clearly the absence of any warm , self - devoting love in Hetty 's nature to regard the coldness of her behaviour towards Adam as any indication that he was not the man she would like to have for a husband . And this blank in Hetty 's nature , instead of exciting Dinah 's dislike , only touched her with a deeper pity : the lovely face and form affected her as beauty always affects a pure and tender mind , free from selfish jealousies . It was an excellent divine gift , that gave a deeper pathos to the need , the sin , the sorrow with which it was mingled , as the canker in a lily - white bud is more grievous to behold than in a common pot - herb . By the time Dinah had undressed and put on her night - gown , this feeling about Hetty had gathered a painful intensity ; her imagination had created a thorny thicket of sin and sorrow , in which she saw the poor thing struggling torn and bleeding , looking with tears for rescue and finding none . It was in this way that Dinah 's imagination and sympathy acted and reacted habitually , each heightening the other . She felt a deep longing to go now and pour into Hetty 's ear all the words of tender warning and appeal that rushed into her mind . But perhaps Hetty was already asleep . Dinah put her ear to the partition and heard still some slight noises , which convinced her that Hetty was not yet in bed . Still she hesitated ; she was not quite certain of a divine direction ; the voice that told her to go to Hetty seemed no stronger that the other voice which said that Hetty was weary , and that going to her now in an unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more obstinately . Dinah was not satisfied without a more unmistakable guidance than those inward voices . There was light enough for her , if she opened her Bible , to discern the text sufficiently to know what it would say to her . She knew the physiognomy of every page , and could tell on what book she opened , sometimes on what chapter , without seeing title or number . It was a small thick Bible , worn quite round at the edges . Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge , where the light was strongest , and then opened it with her forefinger . The first words she looked at were those at the top of the left - hand page : "
76571	76662	76664	76664	you	1897	" That was enough for Dinah ; she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus , when Paul had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning . She hesitated no longer , but , opening her own door gently , went and tapped on Hetty 's . We know she had to tap twice , because Hetty had to put out her candles and throw off her black lace scarf ; but after the second tap the door was opened immediately . Dinah said , "
76672	76817	76664	76664	you	1897	" and Hetty , without speaking , for she was confused and vexed , opened the door wider and let her in . What a strange contrast the two figures made , visible enough in that mingled twilight and moonlight ! Hetty , her cheeks flushed and her eyes glistening from her imaginary drama , her beautiful neck and arms bare , her hair hanging in a curly tangle down her back , and the baubles in her ears . Dinah , covered with her long white dress , her pale face full of subdued emotion , almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has returned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love . They were nearly of the same height ; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she put her arm round Hetty 's waist and kissed her forehead . "
76829	76857	76818	76818	I	0	" she said , in her sweet clear voice , which was irritating to Hetty , mingling with her own peevish vexation like music with jangling chains , "
76918	76919	76912	76912	you	1898	" "
76923	77005	76912	76912	you	1898	" said Hetty , hastily turning round and reaching the second chair in the room , glad that Dinah looked as if she did not notice her ear - rings . Dinah sat down , and Hetty began to brush together her hair before twisting it up , doing it with that air of excessive indifference which belongs to confused self - consciousness . But the expression of Dinah 's eyes gradually relieved her ; they seemed unobservant of all details . "
77009	77013	77006	77007	Dear Hetty	296	" she said , "
77137	77138	77131	77131	you	296	" "
77141	77148	77131	77131	you	296	" said Hetty , rather frightened . "
77166	77191	77161	77161	you	296	" Hetty had seated herself as she tied on her cap , and now Dinah leaned forwards and took her hands as she answered , "
77353	77650	77658	77658	Dinah	141	" Dinah paused and released Hetty 's hands that she might not hinder her . Hetty sat quite still ; she felt no response within herself to Dinah 's anxious affection ; but Dinah 's words uttered with solemn pathetic distinctness , affected her with a chill fear . Her flush had died away almost to paleness ; she had the timidity of a luxurious pleasure - seeking nature , which shrinks from the hint of pain . Dinah saw the effect , and her tender anxious pleading became the more earnest , till Hetty , full of a vague fear that something evil was some time to befall her , began to cry . It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand the higher , the higher nature commands a complete view of the lower . But I think the higher nature has to learn this comprehension , as we learn the art of vision , by a good deal of hard experience , often with bruises and gashes incurred in taking things up by the wrong end , and fancying our space wider than it is . Dinah had never seen Hetty affected in this way before , and , with her usual benignant hopefulness , she trusted it was the stirring of a divine impulse . She kissed the sobbing thing , and began to cry with her for grateful joy . But Hetty was simply in that excitable state of mind in which there is no calculating what turn the feelings may take from one moment to another , and for the first time she became irritated under Dinah 's caress . She pushed her away impatiently , and said , with a childish sobbing voice , "
77684	77703	77679	77679	you	141	" Poor Dinah felt a pang . She was too wise to persist , and only said mildly , "
77732	78913	78929	78929	gentleman	1913	" She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had been a ghost ; but once by the side of her own bed , she threw herself on her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that filled her heart . As for Hetty , she was soon in the wood again - her waking dreams being merged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary and confused .

We are more distinctly conscious that rude penances are out of the question for gentlemen in an enlightened age , and that mortal sin is not incompatible with an appetite for muffins . An assault on our pockets , which in more barbarous times would have been made in the brusque form of a pistol - shot , is quite a well - bred and smiling procedure now it has become a request for a loan thrown in as an easy parenthesis between the second and third glasses of claret . Still , there was this advantage in the old rigid forms , that they committed you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed : when you have put your mouth to one end of a hole in a stone wall and are aware that there is an expectant ear at the other end , you are more likely to say what you came out with the intention of saying than if you were seated with your legs in an easy attitude under the mahogany with a companion who will have no reason to be surprised if you have nothing particular to say . However , Arthur Donnithorne , as he winds among the pleasant lanes on horseback in the morning sunshine , has a sincere determination to open his heart to the rector , and the swirling sound of the scythe as he passes by the meadow is all the pleasanter to him because of this honest purpose . He is glad to see the promise of settled weather now , for getting in the hay , about which the farmers have been fearful ; and there is something so healthful in the sharing of a joy that is general and not merely personal , that this thought about the hay - harvest reacts on his state of mind and makes his resolution seem an easier matter . A man about town might perhaps consider that these influences were not to be felt out of a child 's story - book ; but when you are among the fields and hedgerows , it is impossible to maintain a consistent superiority to simple natural pleasures . Arthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching the Broxton side of the hill , when , at a turning in the road , he saw a figure about a hundred yards before him which it was impossible to mistake for any one else than Adam Bede , even if there had been no grey , tailless shepherd - dog at his heels . He was striding along at his usual rapid pace , and Arthur pushed on his horse to overtake him , for he retained too much of his boyish feeling for Adam to miss an opportunity of chatting with him . I will not say that his love for that good fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage : our friend Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome , and to have his handsome deeds recognized . Adam looked round as he heard the quickening clatter of the horse 's heels , and waited for the horseman , lifting his paper cap from his head with a bright smile of recognition . Next to his own brother Seth , Adam would have done more for Arthur Donnithorne than for any other young man in the world . There was hardly anything he would not rather have lost than the two - feet ruler which he always carried in his pocket ; it was Arthur 's present , bought with his pocket - money when he was a fair - haired lad of eleven , and when he had profited so well by Adam 's lessons in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every female in the house with gifts of superfluous thread - reels and round boxes . Adam had quite a pride in the little squire in those early days , and the feeling had only become slightly modified as the fair - haired lad had grown into the whiskered young man . Adam , I confess , was very susceptible to the influence of rank , and quite ready to give an extra amount of respect to every one who had more advantages than himself , not being a philosopher or a proletaire with democratic ideas , but simply a stout - limbed clever carpenter with a large fund of reverence in his nature , which inclined him to admit all established claims unless he saw very clear grounds for questioning them . He had no theories about setting the world to rights , but he saw there was a great deal of damage done by building with ill - seasoned timber - by ignorant men in fine clothes making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like without knowing the bearings of things - by slovenly joiners ' work , and by hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining somebody ; and he resolved , for his part , to set his face against such doings . On these points he would have maintained his opinion against the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either ; but he felt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people who were more knowing than himself . He saw as plainly as possible how ill the woods on the estate were managed , and the shameful state of the farm - buildings ; and if old Squire Donnithorne had asked him the effect of this mismanagement , he would have spoken his opinion without flinching , but the impulse to a respectful demeanour towards a "
78915	78928	78929	78929	gentleman	1913	" would have been strong within him all the while . The word "
78930	78945	78929	78929	gentleman	1913	" had a spell for Adam , and , as he often said , he "
78964	79102	78953	78953	he	1914	" I must remind you again that Adam had the blood of the peasant in his veins , and that since he was in his prime half a century ago , you must expect some of his characteristics to be obsolete . Towards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adam 's was assisted by boyish memories and personal regard so you may imagine that he thought far more of Arthur 's good qualities , and attached far more value to very slight actions of his , than if they had been the qualities and actions of a common workman like himself . He felt sure it would be a fine day for everybody about Hayslope when the young squire came into the estate - such a generous open - hearted disposition as he had , and an "
79104	79143	79218	79218	sir	5336	" notion about improvements and repairs , considering he was only just coming of age . Thus there was both respect and affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur Donnithorne rode up . "
79152	79178	79150	79150	you	127	" said Arthur , holding out his hand . He never shook hands with any of the farmers , and Adam felt the honour keenly . "

79768	79793	79766	79766	Adam	127	" said Arthur , remembering what Mr. Irwine had said about a probable hitch in the love - making between Adam and Mary Burge , "

80085	80108	80083	80083	Adam	127	" said Arthur , after a pause , in which he had looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his side . "

80153	80164	80151	80151	sir	5336	" said Adam , looking round at Arthur and smiling . "
80242	80261	80262	80262	I	0	" Arthur did not laugh , for he was preoccupied with some thought that made him say presently , "
80345	80346	80328	80328	your	127	" "
80349	80361	80328	80328	your	127	" said Adam , slowly , after a moment 's hesitation , "

80636	80640	80631	80631	I	0	" said Arthur . "

80939	81257	80933	80933	Adam	127	" Arthur gave his horse to the groom at the rectory gate , and walked along the gravel towards the door which opened on the garden . He knew that the rector always breakfasted in his study , and the study lay on the left hand of this door , opposite the dining - room . It was a small low room , belonging to the old part of the house - dark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the walls ; yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the open window . For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it , which stood on a scagliola pillar in front of the ready - spread bachelor breakfast - table , and by the side of this breakfast - table was a group which would have made any room enticing . In the crimson damask easy - chair sat Mr. Irwine , with that radiant freshness which he always had when he came from his morning toilet ; his finely formed plump white hand was playing along Juno 's brown curly back ; and close to Juno 's tail , which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure , the two brown pups were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises . On a cushion a little removed sat Pug , with the air of a maiden lady , who looked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses , which she made as little show as possible of observing . On the table , at Mr. Irwine 's elbow , lay the first volume of the Foulis AEschylus , which Arthur knew well by sight ; and the silver coffee - pot , which Carroll was bringing in , sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a bachelor breakfast . "
81274	81292	81268	81268	You	211	" said Mr. Irwine , as Arthur paused and stepped in over the low window - sill . "
81341	81342	81329	81329	you	211	" "
81354	81358	81329	81329	you	211	" said Arthur ; "
81405	81555	81394	81394	I	0	" Arthur was anxious not to imply that he came with any special purpose . He had no sooner found himself in Mr. Irwine 's presence than the confidence which he had thought quite easy before , suddenly appeared the most difficult thing in the world to him , and at the very moment of shaking hands he saw his purpose in quite a new light . How could he make Irwine understand his position unless he told him those little scenes in the wood ; and how could he tell them without looking like a fool ? And then his weakness in coming back from Gawaine 's , and doing the very opposite of what he intended ! Irwine would think him a shilly - shally fellow ever after . However , it must come out in an unpremeditated way ; the conversation might lead up to it . "
81570	81575	81556	81556	I	0	" said Mr. Irwine . "
81779	81780	81809	81812	Cras ingens iterabimus aequor	1986	" "

82458	82771	82451	82451	you	2002	" Arthur winced under this speech , for keen old Mrs. Irwine 's opinion about him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen . This , to be sure , was only another reason for persevering in his intention , and getting an additional security against himself . Nevertheless , at this point in the conversation , he was conscious of increased disinclination to tell his story about Hetty . He was of an impressible nature , and lived a great deal in other people 's opinions and feelings concerning himself ; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate friend , who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such serious internal struggle as he came to confide , rather shook his own belief in the seriousness of the struggle . It was not , after all , a thing to make a fuss about ; and what could Irwine do for him that he could not do for himself ? He would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg 's lameness - go on Rattler , and let Pym follow as well as he could on the old hack . That was his thought as he sugared his coffee ; but the next minute , as he was lifting the cup to his lips , he remembered how thoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine . No ! He would not be vacillating again - he WOULD do what he had meant to do , this time . So it would be well not to let the personal tone of the conversation altogether drop . If they went to quite indifferent topics , his difficulty would be heightened . It had required no noticeable pause for this rush and rebound of feeling , before he answered , "
82837	82838	82834	82835	a woman	886	" "
82993	83023	82987	82991	the chorus in the Prometheus	2031	" The smile that flitted across Arthur 's face was a faint one , and instead of following Mr. Irwine 's playful lead , he said , quite seriously - "
83093	83094	83077	83077	he	505	" "
83179	83180	83184	83184	one	5409	" "
83205	83206	83211	83212	a man	505	" "

83405	83532	83549	83549	I	0	" In asking this question , Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away , threw himself back in his chair , and looked straight at Arthur . He really suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something , and thought of smoothing the way for him by this direct question . But he was mistaken . Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink of confession , Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it than ever . The conversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intended - it would quite mislead Irwine - he would imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty , while there was no such thing . He was conscious of colouring , and was annoyed at his boyishness . "
83539	83548	83549	83549	I	0	" he said as indifferently as he could . "
83584	83987	83992	83992	Arthur	211	" Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of Arthur 's which had a sort of backstairs influence , not admitted to himself ? Our mental business is carried on much in the same way as the business of the State : a great deal of hard work is done by agents who are not acknowledged . In a piece of machinery , too , I believe there is often a small unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal to do with the motion of the large obvious ones . Possibly there was some such unrecognized agent secretly busy in Arthur 's mind at this moment - possibly it was the fear lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession to the rector a serious annoyance , in case he should NOT be able quite to carry out his good resolutions ? I dare not assert that it was not so . The human soul is a very complex thing . The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine 's mind as he looked inquiringly at Arthur , but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed the thought which had quickly followed - that there could be nothing serious in that direction . There was no probability that Arthur ever saw her except at church , and at her own home under the eye of Mrs. Poyser ; and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no more serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing her so as to rouse the little chit 's vanity , and in this way perturb the rustic drama of her life . Arthur would soon join his regiment , and be far away : no , there could be no danger in that quarter , even if Arthur 's character had not been a strong security against it . His honest , patronizing pride in the good - will and respect of everybody about him was a safeguard even against foolish romance , still more against a lower kind of folly . If there had been anything special on Arthur 's mind in the previous conversation , it was clear he was not inclined to enter into details , and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a friendly curiosity . He perceived a change of subject would be welcome , and said , "
84058	84153	84043	84043	you	211	" The opportunity was gone . While Arthur was hesitating , the rope to which he might have clung had drifted away - he must trust now to his own swimming . In ten minutes from that time , Mr. Irwine was called for on business , and Arthur , bidding him good - bye , mounted his horse again with a sense of dissatisfaction , which he tried to quell by determining to set off for Eagledale without an hour 's delay . Book Two Chapter XVII In Which the Story Pauses a Little "
84165	84174	84162	84163	a pagan	2052	" I hear one of my readers exclaim . "
84215	84494	84162	84163	a pagan	2052	" Certainly I could , if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist to represent things as they never have been and never will be . Then , of course , I might refashion life and character entirely after my own liking ; I might select the most unexceptionable type of clergyman and put my own admirable opinions into his mouth on all occasions . But it happens , on the contrary , that my strongest effort is to avoid any such arbitrary picture , and to give a faithful account of men and things as they have mirrored themselves in my mind . The mirror is doubtless defective , the outlines will sometimes be disturbed , the reflection faint or confused ; but I feel as much bound to tell you as precisely as I can what that reflection is , as if I were in the witness - box , narrating my experience on oath . Sixty years ago - it is a long time , so no wonder things have changed - all clergymen were not zealous ; indeed , there is reason to believe that the number of zealous clergymen was small , and it is probable that if one among the small minority had owned the livings of Broxton and Hayslope in the year 1799 , you would have liked him no better than you like Mr. Irwine . Ten to one , you would have thought him a tasteless , indiscreet , methodistical man . It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium required by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste ! Perhaps you will say , "
84632	85338	85380	85383	clumsy , ugly people	2060	" But , my good friend , what will you do then with your fellow - parishioner who opposes your husband in the vestry ? With your newly appointed vicar , whose style of preaching you find painfully below that of his regretted predecessor ? With the honest servant who worries your soul with her one failing ? With your neighbour , Mrs. Green , who was really kind to you in your last illness , but has said several ill - natured things about you since your convalescence ? Nay , with your excellent husband himself , who has other irritating habits besides that of not wiping his shoes ? These fellow - mortals , every one , must be accepted as they are : you can neither straighten their noses , nor brighten their wit , nor rectify their dispositions ; and it is these people - amongst whom your life is passed - that it is needful you should tolerate , pity , and love : it is these more or less ugly , stupid , inconsistent people whose movements of goodness you should be able to admire - for whom you should cherish all possible hopes , all possible patience . And I would not , even if I had the choice , be the clever novelist who could create a world so much better than this , in which we get up in the morning to do our daily work , that you would be likely to turn a harder , colder eye on the dusty streets and the common green fields - on the real breathing men and women , who can be chilled by your indifference or injured by your prejudice ; who can be cheered and helped onward by your fellow - feeling , your forbearance , your outspoken , brave justice . So I am content to tell my simple story , without trying to make things seem better than they were ; dreading nothing , indeed , but falsity , which , in spite of one 's best efforts , there is reason to dread . Falsehood is so easy , truth so difficult . The pencil is conscious of a delightful facility in drawing a griffin - the longer the claws , and the larger the wings , the better ; but that marvellous facility which we mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we want to draw a real unexaggerated lion . Examine your words well , and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false , it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth , even about your own immediate feelings - much harder than to say something fine about them which is NOT the exact truth . It is for this rare , precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in many Dutch paintings , which lofty - minded people despise . I find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence , which has been the fate of so many more among my fellow - mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence , of tragic suffering or of world - stirring actions . I turn , without shrinking , from cloud - borne angels , from prophets , sibyls , and heroic warriors , to an old woman bending over her flower - pot , or eating her solitary dinner , while the noonday light , softened perhaps by a screen of leaves , falls on her mob - cap , and just touches the rim of her spinning - wheel , and her stone jug , and all those cheap common things which are the precious necessaries of life to her - or I turn to that village wedding , kept between four brown walls , where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with a high - shouldered , broad - faced bride , while elderly and middle - aged friends look on , with very irregular noses and lips , and probably with quart - pots in their hands , but with an expression of unmistakable contentment and goodwill . "
85341	85347	85380	85383	clumsy , ugly people	2060	" says my idealistic friend , "
85385	85425	85380	85383	clumsy , ugly people	2060	" But bless us , things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome , I hope ? I am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have not been ugly , and even among those "
85431	86532	85380	85383	clumsy , ugly people	2060	" the British , squat figures , ill - shapen nostrils , and dingy complexions are not startling exceptions . Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst us . I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying ; yet to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them , and their miniatures - flattering , but still not lovely - are kissed in secret by motherly lips . I have seen many an excellent matron , who could have never in her best days have been handsome , and yet she had a packet of yellow love - letters in a private drawer , and sweet children showered kisses on her sallow cheeks . And I believe there have been plenty of young heroes , of middle stature and feeble beards , who have felt quite sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana , and yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a wife who waddles . Yes ! Thank God ; human feeling is like the mighty rivers that bless the earth : it does not wait for beauty - it flows with resistless force and brings beauty with it . All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form ! Let us cultivate it to the utmost in men , women , and children - in our gardens and in our houses . But let us love that other beauty too , which lies in no secret of proportion , but in the secret of deep human sympathy . Paint us an angel , if you can , with a floating violet robe , and a face paled by the celestial light ; paint us yet oftener a Madonna , turning her mild face upward and opening her arms to welcome the divine glory ; but do not impose on us any aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of Art those old women scraping carrots with their work - worn hands , those heavy clowns taking holiday in a dingy pot - house , those rounded backs and stupid weather - beaten faces that have bent over the spade and done the rough work of the world - those homes with their tin pans , their brown pitchers , their rough curs , and their clusters of onions . In this world there are so many of these common coarse people , who have no picturesque sentimental wretchedness ! It is so needful we should remember their existence , else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes . Therefore , let Art always remind us of them ; therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a life to the faithful representing of commonplace things - men who see beauty in these commonplace things , and delight in showing how kindly the light of heaven falls on them . There are few prophets in the world ; few sublimely beautiful women ; few heroes . I ca n't afford to give all my love and reverence to such rarities : I want a great deal of those feelings for my every - day fellow - men , especially for the few in the foreground of the great multitude , whose faces I know , whose hands I touch for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy . Neither are picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as your common labourer , who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but creditably with his own pocket - knife . It is more needful that I should have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat , than with the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathers - more needful that my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of gentle goodness in the faulty people who sit at the same hearth with me , or in the clergyman of my own parish , who is perhaps rather too corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson , than at the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay , or at the sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived by an able novelist . And so I come back to Mr. Irwine , with whom I desire you to be in perfect charity , far as he may be from satisfying your demands on the clerical character . Perhaps you think he was not - as he ought to have been - a living demonstration of the benefits attached to a national church ? But I am not sure of that ; at least I know that the people in Broxton and Hayslope would have been very sorry to part with their clergyman , and that most faces brightened at his approach ; and until it can be proved that hatred is a better thing for the soul than love , I must believe that Mr. Irwine 's influence in his parish was a more wholesome one than that of the zealous Mr. Ryde , who came there twenty years afterwards , when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his fathers . It is true , Mr. Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the Reformation , visited his flock a great deal in their own homes , and was severe in rebuking the aberrations of the flesh - put a stop , indeed , to the Christmas rounds of the church singers , as promoting drunkenness and too light a handling of sacred things . But I gathered from Adam Bede , to whom I talked of these matters in his old age , that few clergymen could be less successful in winning the hearts of their parishioners than Mr. Ryde . They learned a great many notions about doctrine from him , so that almost every church - goer under fifty began to distinguish as well between the genuine gospel and what did not come precisely up to that standard , as if he had been born and bred a Dissenter ; and for some time after his arrival there seemed to be quite a religious movement in that quiet rural district .

88051	88539	88031	88031	I	0	" Adam , you perceive , was a warm admirer , perhaps a partial judge , of Mr. Irwine , as , happily , some of us still are of the people we have known familiarly . Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty order of minds who pant after the ideal , and are oppressed by a general sense that their emotions are of too exquisite a character to find fit objects among their everyday fellowmen . I have often been favoured with the confidence of these select natures , and find them to concur in the experience that great men are overestimated and small men are insupportable ; that if you would love a woman without ever looking back on your love as a folly , she must die while you are courting her ; and if you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism , you must never make a pilgrimage to see the hero . I confess I have often meanly shrunk from confessing to these accomplished and acute gentlemen what my own experience has been . I am afraid I have often smiled with hypocritical assent , and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting nature of our illusions , which any one moderately acquainted with French literature can command at a moment 's notice . Human converse , I think some wise man has remarked , is not rigidly sincere . But I herewith discharge my conscience , and declare that I have had quite enthusiastic movements of admiration towards old gentlemen who spoke the worst English , who were occasionally fretful in their temper , and who had never moved in a higher sphere of influence than that of parish overseer ; and that the way in which I have come to the conclusion that human nature is lovable - the way I have learnt something of its deep pathos , its sublime mysteries - has been by living a great deal among people more or less commonplace and vulgar , of whom you would perhaps hear nothing very surprising if you were to inquire about them in the neighbourhoods where they dwelt . Ten to one most of the small shopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them . For I have observed this remarkable coincidence , that the select natures who pant after the ideal , and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great enough to command their reverence and love , are curiously in unison with the narrowest and pettiest . For example , I have often heard Mr. Gedge , the landlord of the Royal Oak , who used to turn a bloodshot eye on his neighbours in the village of Shepperton , sum up his opinion of the people in his own parish - and they were all the people he knew - in these emphatic words : "
88577	88658	88567	88569	a poor lot	2127	" I think he had a dim idea that if he could migrate to a distant parish , he might find neighbours worthy of him ; and indeed he did subsequently transfer himself to the Saracen 's Head , which was doing a thriving business in the back street of a neighbouring market - town . But , oddly enough , he has found the people up that back street of precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants of Shepperton - "

88791	88792	88795	88795	Aunt	2134	" "
88797	88801	88795	88795	Aunt	2134	" said Hetty , "
88836	89157	88825	88825	I	0	" Hetty was coming downstairs , and Mrs. Poyser , in her plain bonnet and shawl , was standing below . If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses , that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock . For her hat was trimmed with pink , and her frock had pink spots , sprinkled on a white ground . There was nothing but pink and white about her , except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes . Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself , for she could hardly keep from smiling , as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things . So she turned without speaking , and joined the group outside the house door , followed by Hetty , whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on . And now the little procession set off . Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab , with a red - and - green waistcoat and a green watch - ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached , pendant like a plumb - line from that promontory where his watch - pocket was situated ; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck ; and excellent grey ribbed stockings , knitted by Mrs. Poyser 's own hand , setting off the proportions of his leg . Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg , and suspected that the growing abuse of top - boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf . Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face , which was good humour itself as he said , "
89167	89188	89164	89165	little uns	2137	" and giving his arm to his wife , led the way through the causeway gate into the yard . The "
89191	89539	88825	88825	I	0	" addressed were Marty and Tommy , boys of nine and seven , in little fustian tailed coats and knee - breeches , relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes , looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one . Hetty walked between them , and behind came patient Molly , whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road ; for Totty , having speedily recovered from her threatened fever , had insisted on going to church to - day , and especially on wearing her red - and - black necklace outside her tippet . And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon , for there had been heavy showers in the morning , though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon . You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard . The cocks and hens seemed to know it , and made only crooning subdued noises ; the very bull - dog looked less savage , as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual . The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour . It was asleep itself on the moss - grown cow - shed ; on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings ; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw , while her largest young one found an excellent spring - bed on his mother 's fat ribs ; on Alick , the shepherd , in his new smock - frock , taking an uneasy siesta , half - sitting , half - standing on the granary steps . Alick was of opinion that church , like other luxuries , was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind . "
89552	89614	88825	88825	I	0	" was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question . I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence ; indeed , I know that his mind was not of a speculative , negative cast , and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day , Easter Sunday , and "
89617	89646	88825	88825	I	0	" But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies , like other non - productive employments , were intended for people who had leisure . "
89659	89664	89667	89667	he	174	" said Martin Poyser . "
89691	89692	89685	89685	him	174	" "
89714	89719	89720	89720	they	2141	" said Mrs. Poyser ; "
89755	89895	89896	89896	They	2141	" Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching , and held it wide open , leaning on his stick - pleased to do this bit of work ; for , like all old men whose life has been spent in labour , he liked to feel that he was still useful - that there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing - and that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on . He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays , but not very regularly at other times ; on wet Sundays , or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism , he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead . "
89914	89924	89903	89903	i	0	" he said , as his son came up . "
89995	89996	90021	90022	the parson	1493	" "
90001	90006	90021	90022	the parson	1493	" said the son , "
90017	90018	90021	90022	the parson	1493	" "
90034	90073	90027	90028	the parson	1493	" said Grandfather to the black - eyed youngsters in knee - breeches , conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling , a little , secretly , during the sermon . "
90080	90084	90085	90085	Me	0	" said Totty . "
90101	90109	90085	90085	Me	0	" Grandad , shaking with laughter at this "
90114	90449	90085	90085	Me	0	" slowly transferred his stick to his left hand , which held the gate open , and slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation . And when they were all gone , the old man leaned on the gate again , watching them across the lane along the Home Close , and through the far gate , till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge . For the hedgerows in those days shut out one 's view , even on the better - managed farms ; and this afternoon , the dog - roses were tossing out their pink wreaths , the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory , the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach , peeping high up out of a holly bush , and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path . There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass : at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other , extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way ; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars , and beside her the liver - coloured foal with its head towards its mother 's flank , apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence . The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser 's own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village , and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along , while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all . The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent , so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their "
90451	90476	90085	90085	Me	0	" - an exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects . "
90483	90516	90479	90481	that shorthorned Sally	2154	" she said , as they entered the Home Close , and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her with a sleepy eye . "
90575	90576	90566	90566	I	0	" "
90587	90592	90593	90593	they	2157	" said Mr. Poyser ; "

90807	90850	90853	90853	them	2167	" said Mr. Poyser , secretly proud of his wife 's superior power of putting two and two together ; indeed , on recent market - days he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns . "
90902	90931	90959	90959	she	172	" Mrs. Poyser continued , as Totty , who had been set down now the road was dry , toddled on in front of her father and mother . "

91112	91123	91104	91104	Hetty	177	" said Mr. Poyser , with rather a contemptuous emphasis , "

91790	91811	91818	91819	the Methodists	494	" said Mr. Poyser , with as near an approach to a snarl as his good - nature would allow ; "
91909	91910	91907	91907	Hetty	177	" "
91916	91931	91907	91907	Hetty	177	" said Mrs. Poyser , who had looked back while her husband was speaking , "
91983	92026	91978	91978	'em	2217	" Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field , so they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile , and awaited the loiterers Totty observing with complacency , "
92036	92210	92211	92211	Lawks	320	" The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy , who saw a perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows , and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers . Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow - hammer on the boughs of the great ash , and while he was peeping , he missed the sight of a white - throated stoat , which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy . Then there was a little greenfinch , just fledged , fluttering along the ground , and it seemed quite possible to catch it , till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush . Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things , so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy , and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told , and said "
92213	92250	92211	92211	Lawks	320	" whenever she was expected to wonder . Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them that her aunt was angry ; but Marty ran on first , shouting , "
92262	92278	92260	92260	Mother	185	" with the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault . "
92281	92295	92260	92260	Mother	185	" said Mrs. Poyser , really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant surprise , "
92308	92309	92260	92260	Mother	185	" "
92339	92340	92332	92332	she	2223	" "

92442	92446	92447	92447	you	185	" said Marty , "

92502	92532	92533	92533	Mother	185	" The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their eldest - born 's acuteness ; but on Tommy 's round face there was a cloud . "
92535	92543	92533	92533	Mother	185	" he said , half - crying , "
92562	92563	92564	92564	Munny	240	" "
92577	92581	92564	92564	Munny	240	" said Totty . "

92625	92662	92564	92564	Munny	240	" This dreadful threat had the desired effect , and through the two remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption , notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles , alias "
92665	92753	92564	92564	Munny	240	" which the lads looked at wistfully . The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to - morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser , who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest ; but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any field - work , however early in the morning , on a Sunday ; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen ' sweltered "
92805	92823	92824	92824	he	215	" It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so , "

92837	92929	92824	92824	he	215	" But it 's poor foolishness to think o ' saving by going against your conscience . There 's that Jim Wakefield , as they used to call ' Gentleman Wakefield , ' used to do the same of a Sunday as o ' weekdays , and took no heed to right or wrong , as if there was nayther God nor devil . An ' what 's he come to ? Why , I saw him myself last market - day a - carrying a basket wi ' oranges in't . "
92930	92937	92939	92940	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Ah , to be sure , "
92944	93033	92939	92940	Mrs. Poyser	228	" you make but a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi ' wickedness . The money as is got so 's like to burn holes i ' your pocket . I 'd niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i ' the rightful way . And as for the weather , there 's One above makes it , and we must put up wi't : it 's nothing of a plague to what the wenches are . "

96803	96843	96785	96785	He	127	" Father , you know it was all right between us ; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad ; you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then ! "
96956	96965	96966	96966	Adam	127	" Ah ! I was always too hard , "
96971	97236	96969	96969	himself	127	" It 's a sore fault in me as I 'm so hot and out o ' patience with people when they do wrong , and my heart gets shut up against 'em , so as I ca n't bring myself to forgive 'em . I see clear enough there 's more pride nor love in my soul , for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th ' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him . And there went plenty o ' pride and temper to the strokes , as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins . Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself . It 's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still , but the real tough job for me ' ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride . It seems to me now , if I was to find Father at home to - night , I should behave different ; but there 's no knowing - perhaps nothing ' ud be a lesson to us if it did n't come too late . It 's well we should feel as life 's a reckoning we ca n't make twice over ; there 's no real making amends in this world , any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right .

98935	99088	98918	98919	Mr. Craig	265	" I hope y ' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th ' other day . If ye want vegetables while ye're in trouble , ye know where to come to . It 's well known I 'm not giving other folks ' things away , for when I 've supplied the house , the garden s my own spekilation , and it isna every man th ' old squire could get as ' ud be equil to the undertaking , let alone asking whether he 'd be willing I 've got to run my calkilation fine , I can tell you , to make sure o ' getting back the money as I pay the squire .

Why , I know upo ' good authority as it 's a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high , an ' they live upo ' spoon - meat mostly . I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o ' the French . I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur . Why , it ' ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him ; his arm 's thicker nor a Frenchman 's body , I 'll be bound , for they pinch theirsells in wi ' stays ; and it 's easy enough , for they 've got nothing i ' their insides .

99364	99379	99381	99381	Adam	127	" Where IS the captain , as he wasna at church to - day ? "
99383	99402	99381	99381	Adam	127	" I was talking to him o ' Friday , and he said nothing about his going away . "
99403	99492	99493	99494	Mr. Craig	265	" Oh , he 's only gone to Eagledale for a bit o ' fishing ; I reckon he 'll be back again afore many days are o'er , for he 's to be at all th ' arranging and preparing o ' things for the comin ' o ' age o ' the 30th o ' July . But he 's fond o ' getting away for a bit , now and then . Him and th ' old squire fit one another like frost and flowers . "

I 'll never be no other than a good son to thee as long as we live . But a man has other feelings besides what he owes to 's father and mother , and thee oughtna to want to rule over me body and soul . And thee must make up thy mind as I 'll not give way to thee where I 've a right to do what I like . So let us have no more words about it . "
103511	103514	103516	103516	Lisbeth	268	" Eh , "

104147	104166	104167	104167	Adam	127	" You may come into the dairy if you will , for I canna justly leave the cheese . "
104185	104200	104202	104203	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Why , you might think you war come to a dead - house , "
104213	104329	104202	104203	Mrs. Poyser	228	" they 're all i ' the meadow ; but Martin 's sure to be in afore long , for they 're leaving the hay cocked to - night , ready for carrying first thing to - morrow . I 've been forced t ' have Nancy in , upo ' ' count as Hetty must gether the red currants to - night ; the fruit allays ripens so contrairy , just when every hand 's wanted . An ' there 's no trustin ' the children to gether it , for they put more into their own mouths nor into the basket ; you might as well set the wasps to gether the fruit . "
104358	104392	104355	104355	he	127	" I could be looking at your spinning - wheel , then , and see what wants doing to it . Perhaps it stands in the house , where I can find it ? "
104393	104544	104202	104203	Mrs. Poyser	228	" No , I 've put it away in the right - hand parlour ; but let it be till I can fetch it and show it you . I 'd be glad now if you 'd go into the garden and tell Hetty to send Totty in . The child ' ull run in if she 's told , an ' I know Hetty 's lettin ' her eat too many currants . I 'll be much obliged to you , Mr. Bede , if you 'll go and send her in ; an ' there 's the York and Lankester roses beautiful in the garden now - you 'll like to see 'em . But you 'd like a drink o ' whey first , p'r'aps ; I know you 're fond o ' whey , as most folks is when they hanna got to crush it out . "
104545	104552	104554	104554	Adam	127	" Thank you , Mrs. Poyser , "
104556	104579	104554	104554	Adam	127	" a drink o ' whey 's allays a treat to me . I 'd rather have it than beer any day . "
104580	104585	104587	104588	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Aye , aye , "
104610	104718	104587	104588	Mrs. Poyser	228	" the smell o ' bread 's sweet t ' everybody but the baker . The Miss Irwines allays say , ' Oh , Mrs. Poyser , I envy you your dairy ; and I envy you your chickens ; and what a beautiful thing a farm - house is , to be sure ! ' An ' I say , ' Yes ; a farm - house is a fine thing for them as look on , an ' do n't know the liftin ' , an ' the stannin ' , an ' the worritin ' o ' th ' inside as belongs to't . ' "
104719	104747	104749	104749	Adam	127	" Why , Mrs. Poyser , you would n't like to live anywhere else but in a farm - house , so well as you manage it , "
104755	104837	104749	104749	Adam	127	" and there can be nothing to look at pleasanter nor a fine milch cow , standing up to'ts knees in pasture , and the new milk frothing in the pail , and the fresh butter ready for market , and the calves , and the poultry . Here 's to your health , and may you allays have strength to look after your own dairy , and set a pattern t ' all the farmers ' wives in the country . "
104973	104982	104984	104985	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Have a little more , Mr. Bede ? "
104994	105015	104984	104985	Mrs. Poyser	228	" No , thank you ; I 'll go into the garden now , and send in the little lass . "
105016	105033	105034	105034	Adam	127	" Aye , do ; and tell her to come to her mother in the dairy . "

105649	105692	105693	105693	He	127	" There now , Totty , you 've got your cherries . Run into the house with 'em to Mother - she wants you - she 's in the dairy . Run in this minute - there 's a good little girl . "
105745	105763	105765	105765	Adam	127	" Tommy , my lad , take care you 're not shot for a little thieving bird , "
105920	105925	105926	105926	he	127	" I frightened you , "
105953	105961	105943	105943	Hetty	177	" let ME pick the currants up . "
106053	106063	106064	106064	she	177	" There 's not many more currants to get , "
106067	106076	106064	106064	she	177	" I shall soon ha ' done now . "
106077	106083	106085	106085	Adam	127	" I 'll help you , "
106982	106987	106989	106989	Hetty	177	" That 'll do , "
106996	107014	106989	106989	Hetty	177	" Aunt wants me to leave some on the trees . I 'll take 'em in now . "
107015	107027	107029	107029	Adam	127	" It 's very well I came to carry the basket , "
107030	107045	106989	106989	Hetty	177	" for it ' ud ha ' been too heavy for your little arms . "
107046	107059	106989	106989	Hetty	177	" No ; I could ha ' carried it with both hands . "
107060	107066	107068	107068	Adam	127	" Oh , I daresay , "
107072	107105	107068	107068	Adam	127	" and been as long getting into the house as a little ant carrying a caterpillar . Have you ever seen those tiny fellows carrying things four times as big as themselves ? "
107106	107109	107111	107111	Hetty	177	" No , "
107125	107194	107111	107111	Hetty	177	" Oh , I used to watch 'em often when I was a lad . But now , you see , I can carry the basket with one arm , as if it was an empty nutshell , and give you th ' other arm to lean on . Wo n't you ? Such big arms as mine were made for little arms like yours to lean on . "
107224	107232	107233	107233	she	177	" Have you ever been to Eagledale ? "
107242	107245	107247	107247	Adam	127	" Yes , "
107259	107313	107247	107247	Adam	127	" Ten years ago , when I was a lad , I went with father to see about some work there . It 's a wonderful sight - rocks and caves such as you never saw in your life . I never had a right notion o ' rocks till I went there . "
107314	107324	107233	107233	she	177	" How long did it take to get there ? "
107325	107542	107543	107544	Poor Adam	127	" Why , it took us the best part o ' two days ' walking . But it 's nothing of a day 's journey for anybody as has got a first - rate nag . The captain ' ud get there in nine or ten hours , I 'll be bound , he 's such a rider . And I should n't wonder if he 's back again to - morrow ; he 's too active to rest long in that lonely place , all by himself , for there 's nothing but a bit of a inn i ' that part where he 's gone to fish . I wish he 'd got th ' estate in his hands ; that ' ud be the right thing for him , for it ' ud give him plenty to do , and he 'd do't well too , for all he 's so young ; he 's got better notions o ' things than many a man twice his age . He spoke very handsome to me th ' other day about lending me money to set up i ' business ; and if things came round that way , I 'd rather be beholding to him nor to any man i ' the world . "
107618	107626	107627	107627	Adam	127	" How pretty the roses are now ! "
107636	107683	107684	107684	He	127	" See ! I stole the prettiest , but I didna mean to keep it myself . I think these as are all pink , and have got a finer sort o ' green leaves , are prettier than the striped uns , do n't you ? "
107699	107705	107706	107706	he	127	" It smells very sweet , "
107709	107744	107706	107706	he	127	" those striped uns have no smell . Stick it in your frock , and then you can put it in water after . It ' ud be a pity to let it fade . "
107863	107866	107867	107867	he	127	" Ah , "
107870	108020	107867	107867	he	127	" that 's like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase ; they 've mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i ' their hair , but somehow I do n't like to see 'em they allays put me i ' mind o ' the painted women outside the shows at Treddles'on Fair . What can a woman have to set her off better than her own hair , when it curls so , like yours ? If a woman 's young and pretty , I think you can see her good looks all the better for her being plain dressed . Why , Dinah Morris looks very nice , for all she wears such a plain cap and gown . It seems to me as a woman 's face doesna want flowers ; it 's almost like a flower itself . I 'm sure yours is . "
108021	108027	108029	108029	Hetty	177	" Oh , very well , "
108045	108084	108029	108029	Hetty	177	" I 'll put one o ' Dinah 's caps on when we go in , and you 'll see if I look better in it . She left one behind , so I can take the pattern . "
108085	108246	108247	108247	He	2636	" Nay , nay , I do n't want you to wear a Methodist cap like Dinah 's . I daresay it 's a very ugly cap , and I used to think when I saw her here as it was nonsense for her to dress different t ' other people ; but I never rightly noticed her till she came to see mother last week , and then I thought the cap seemed to fit her face somehow as th ' acorn - cup fits th ' acorn , and I should n't like to see her so well without it . But you 've got another sort o ' face ; I 'd have you just as you are now , without anything t ' interfere with your own looks . It 's like when a man 's singing a good tune - you do n't want t ' hear bells tinkling and interfering wi ' the sound . "
108483	108485	108487	108489	Tim the ploughman	164	" whups "
108631	108749	108588	108588	herself	228	" that would wear into holes in no time , but good homespun that would last for two generations . The cold veal , the fresh lettuces , and the stuffed chine might well look tempting to hungry men who had dined at half - past twelve o'clock . On the large deal table against the wall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans , ready for Alick and his companions ; for the master and servants ate their supper not far off each other ; which was all the pleasanter , because if a remark about to - morrow morning 's work occurred to Mr. Poyser , Alick was at hand to hear it . "
108761	108766	108754	108754	I	0	" said Mr. Poyser . "
108828	108829	108830	108830	Hetty	177	" "
108832	108853	108830	108830	Hetty	177	" said Mrs. Poyser , as she looked into the basket of currants to see if the fruit was fine , "
108929	109162	108918	108918	she	189	" This was said in a lower tone than usual , while her husband was talking to Adam ; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of propriety , and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated sharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her . That would not be fair - play : every woman was young in her turn , and had her chances of matrimony , which it was a point of honour for other women not to spoil - just as one market - woman who has sold her own eggs must not try to balk another of a customer . Hetty made haste to run away upstairs , not easily finding an answer to her aunt 's question , and Mrs. Poyser went out to see after Marty and Tommy and bring them in to supper . Soon they were all seated - the two rosy lads , one on each side , by the pale mother , a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle . Alick too was come in , and was seated in his far corner , eating cold broad beans out of a large dish with his pocket - knife , and finding a flavour in them which he would not have exchanged for the finest pineapple . "
109178	109193	109196	109196	she	2656	" said Mrs. Poyser , when she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine . "
109245	109246	109247	109247	She	2656	" "
109256	109261	109247	109247	She	2656	" said Mr. Poyser . "
109275	109276	109267	109267	her	2656	" "
109280	109285	109278	109278	her	2656	" said Mrs. Poyser . "
109390	109480	109481	109481	Molly	343	" Mrs. Poyser 's attention was here diverted by the appearance of Molly , carrying a large jug , two small mugs , and four drinking - cans , all full of ale or small beer - an interesting example of the prehensile power possessed by the human hand . Poor Molly 's mouth was rather wider open than usual , as she walked along with her eyes fixed on the double cluster of vessels in her hands , quite innocent of the expression in her mistress 's eye . "
109526	109620	109521	109521	I	0	" Molly had not seen the lightning , and the thunder shook her nerves the more for the want of that preparation . With a vague alarmed sense that she must somehow comport herself differently , she hastened her step a little towards the far deal table , where she might set down her cans - caught her foot in her apron , which had become untied , and fell with a crash and a splash into a pool of beer ; whereupon a tittering explosion from Marty and Tommy , and a serious "
109623	109637	109521	109521	I	0	" from Mr. Poyser , who saw his draught of ale unpleasantly deferred . "
109642	109672	109639	109639	you	343	" resumed Mrs. Poyser , in a cutting tone , as she rose and went towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully to pick up the fragments of pottery . "
109874	109928	109864	109864	anybody	492	" Poor Molly 's tears were dropping fast by this time , and in her desperation at the lively movement of the beer - stream towards Alick 's legs , she was converting her apron into a mop , while Mrs. Poyser , opening the cupboard , turned a blighting eye upon her . "
109931	109936	109864	109864	anybody	492	" she went on , "
110046	110153	110156	110156	anybody	492	" Mrs. Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the brown - and - white jug in her hand , when she caught sight of something at the other end of the kitchen ; perhaps it was because she was already trembling and nervous that the apparition had so strong an effect on her ; perhaps jug - breaking , like other crimes , has a contagious influence . However it was , she stared and started like a ghost - seer , and the precious brown - and - white jug fell to the ground , parting for ever with its spout and handle . "
110161	110181	110156	110156	anybody	492	" she said , with a suddenly lowered tone , after a moment 's bewildered glance round the room . "
110206	110207	110156	110156	anybody	492	" "
110221	110238	110216	110216	i	0	" said her husband , who had now joined in the laugh of the young ones . "
110250	110255	110216	110216	i	0	" rejoined Mrs. Poyser ; "
110376	110582	110348	110348	you	177	" A new outbreak of laughter , while Mrs. Poyser was speaking , was caused , less by her sudden conversion to a fatalistic view of jug - breaking than by that strange appearance of Hetty , which had startled her aunt . The little minx had found a black gown of her aunt 's , and pinned it close round her neck to look like Dinah 's , had made her hair as flat as she could , and had tied on one of Dinah 's high - crowned borderless net caps . The thought of Dinah 's pale grave face and mild grey eyes , which the sight of the gown and cap brought with it , made it a laughable surprise enough to see them replaced by Hetty 's round rosy cheeks and coquettish dark eyes . The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her , clapping their hands , and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he looked up from his beans . Under cover of the noise , Mrs. Poyser went into the back kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great pewter measure , which had some chance of being free from bewitchment . "
110594	110615	110592	110592	Methodist	134	" said Mr. Poyser , with that comfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only sees in stout people . "
110646	110647	110648	110648	Adam	127	" "
110662	110670	110671	110671	He	127	" said Hetty , sitting down demurely . "
110680	110681	110671	110671	He	127	" "
110686	110695	110671	110671	He	127	" said Adam , looking at her admiringly ; "
110728	110729	110717	110717	I	0	" "
110741	110759	110760	110760	Thee	2689	" said Mr. Poyser to his wife , who now came back and took her seat again . "
110767	110768	110760	110760	Thee	2689	" "
110776	110781	110773	110773	I	0	" said Mrs. Poyser ; "
111079	111180	111181	111181	You	2704	" Mrs. Poyser , you perceive , was aware that nothing would be so likely to expel the comic as the terrible . Tommy , who was of a susceptible disposition , and very fond of his mother , and who had , besides , eaten so many cherries as to have his feelings less under command than usual , was so affected by the dreadful picture she had made of the possible future that he began to cry ; and the good - natured father , indulgent to all weaknesses but those of negligent farmers , said to Hetty , "
111201	111258	111199	111199	'em	2707	" Hetty went upstairs again , and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable diversion ; for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap , which could not be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs. Poyser ; and then followed a discussion on the secrets of good brewing , the folly of stinginess in "
111261	111337	111199	111199	'em	2707	" and the doubtful economy of a farmer 's making his own malt . Mrs. Poyser had so many opportunities of expressing herself with weight on these subjects that by the time supper was ended , the ale - jug refilled , and Mr. Poyser 's pipe alight she was once more in high good humour , and ready , at Adam 's request , to fetch the broken spinning - wheel for his inspection . "
111340	111349	111199	111199	'em	2707	" said Adam , looking at it carefully , "
111429	111438	111419	111419	I	0	" he continued , looking at Mr. Poyser , "
111532	111550	111506	111509	a man at Rosseter	2717	" Mr. Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a step towards Adam 's becoming a "
111555	111681	111506	111509	a man at Rosseter	2717	" and Mrs. Poyser gave her approbation to the scheme of the movable kitchen cupboard , which was to be capable of containing grocery , pickles , crockery , and house - linen in the utmost compactness without confusion . Hetty , once more in her own dress , with her neckerchief pushed a little backwards on this warm evening , was seated picking currants near the window , where Adam could see her quite well . And so the time passed pleasantly till Adam got up to go . He was pressed to come again soon , but not to stay longer , for at this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of being sleepy at five o'clock in the morning . "
111689	111693	111682	111682	I	0	" said Adam , "
111732	111733	111726	111726	him	344	" "
111736	111741	111726	111726	him	344	" said Mr. Poyser , "
111766	111767	111759	111759	we	2720	" "
111785	111795	111769	111769	you	0	" said Mrs. Poyser , folding up her knitting . "
111804	111808	111798	111799	Mester Massey	344	" said Adam . "
111852	111853	111841	111841	himself	344	" "
111866	111871	111857	111857	him	344	" said Mrs. Poyser , "

111912	111917	111918	111918	I	0	" said old Martin . "

111970	111976	111962	111962	I	0	" said Adam , laughing , "
112007	112050	112005	112005	Hetty	177	" Hetty could only smile and not shake hands , for hers were dyed and damp with currant - juice ; but all the rest gave a hearty shake to the large palm that was held out to them , and said , "
112057	112058	112005	112005	Hetty	177	" "
112067	112081	112005	112005	Hetty	177	" said Mr. Poyser , when Adam was out of on the causeway . "
112148	112835	112838	112838	Bill	306	" Hetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants , so her uncle did not see the little toss of the head with which she answered him . To ride in a spring - cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now . Chapter XXI The Night - School and the Schoolmaster Bartle Massey 's was one of a few scattered houses on the edge of a common , which was divided by the road to Treddleston . Adam reached it in a quarter of an hour after leaving the Hall Farm ; and when he had his hand on the door - latch , he could see , through the curtainless window , that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks , lighted by thin dips . When he entered , a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey merely nodded , leaving him to take his place where he pleased . He had not come for the sake of a lesson to - night , and his mind was too full of personal matters , too full of the last two hours he had passed in Hetty 's presence , for him to amuse himself with a book till school was over ; so he sat down in a corner and looked on with an absent mind . It was a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost weekly for years ; he knew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle Massey 's handwriting which hung over the schoolmaster 's head , by way of keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils ; he knew the backs of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall above the pegs for the slates ; he knew exactly how many grains were gone out of the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters ; he had long ago exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think how the bunch of leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native element ; and from the place where he sat , he could make nothing of the old map of England that hung against the opposite wall , for age had turned it of a fine yellow brown , something like that of a well - seasoned meerschaum . The drama that was going on was almost as familiar as the scene , nevertheless habit had not made him indifferent to it , and even in his present self - absorbed mood , Adam felt a momentary stirring of the old fellow - feeling , as he looked at the rough men painfully holding pen or pencil with their cramped hands , or humbly labouring through their reading lesson . The reading class now seated on the form in front of the schoolmaster 's desk consisted of the three most backward pupils . Adam would have known it only by seeing Bartle Massey 's face as he looked over his spectacles , which he had shifted to the ridge of his nose , not requiring them for present purposes . The face wore its mildest expression : the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their more acute angle of compassionate kindness , and the mouth , habitually compressed with a pout of the lower lip , was relaxed so as to be ready to speak a helpful word or syllable in a moment . This gentle expression was the more interesting because the schoolmaster 's nose , an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one side , had rather a formidable character ; and his brow , moreover , had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament : the blue veins stood out like cords under the transparent yellow skin , and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency to baldness , for the grey bristly hair , cut down to about an inch in length , stood round it in as close ranks as ever . "
112842	112857	112838	112838	Bill	306	" Bartle was saying in a kind tone , as he nodded to Adam , "
112892	112893	112894	112894	Bill	306	" "
112895	112966	112838	112838	Bill	306	" was a sturdy fellow , aged four - and - twenty , an excellent stone - sawyer , who could get as good wages as any man in the trade of his years ; but he found a reading lesson in words of one syllable a harder matter to deal with than the hardest stone he had ever had to saw . The letters , he complained , were so "
112980	113042	112894	112894	Bill	306	" the sawyer 's business not being concerned with minute differences such as exist between a letter with its tail turned up and a letter with its tail turned down . But Bill had a firm determination that he would learn to read , founded chiefly on two reasons : first , that Tom Hazelow , his cousin , could read anything "
113046	113272	112894	112894	Bill	306	" whether it was print or writing , and Tom had sent him a letter from twenty miles off , saying how he was prospering in the world and had got an overlooker 's place ; secondly , that Sam Phillips , who sawed with him , had learned to read when he was turned twenty , and what could be done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips , Bill considered , could be done by himself , seeing that he could pound Sam into wet clay if circumstances required it . So here he was , pointing his big finger towards three words at once , and turning his head on one side that he might keep better hold with his eye of the one word which was to be discriminated out of the group . The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey must possess was something so dim and vast that Bill 's imagination recoiled before it : he would hardly have ventured to deny that the schoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about the regular return of daylight and the changes in the weather . The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type : he was a Methodist brickmaker who , after spending thirty years of his life in perfect satisfaction with his ignorance , had lately "
113276	113460	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" and along with it the desire to read the Bible . But with him , too , learning was a heavy business , and on his way out to - night he had offered as usual a special prayer for help , seeing that he had undertaken this hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soul - that he might have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish evil memories and the temptations of old habit - or , in brief language , the devil . For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher , and was suspected , though there was no good evidence against him , of being the man who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg . However that might be , it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to , which was coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist preacher at Treddleston , a great change had been observed in the brickmaker ; and though he was still known in the neighbourhood by his old sobriquet of "
113463	113721	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" there was nothing he held in so much horror as any further transactions with that evil - smelling element . He was a broad - chested fellow with a fervid temperament , which helped him better in imbibing religious ideas than in the dry process of acquiring the mere human knowledge of the alphabet . Indeed , he had been already a little shaken in his resolution by a brother Methodist , who assured him that the letter was a mere obstruction to the Spirit , and expressed a fear that Brimstone was too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up . The third beginner was a much more promising pupil . He was a tall but thin and wiry man , nearly as old as Brimstone , with a very pale face and hands stained a deep blue . He was a dyer , who in the course of dipping homespun wool and old women 's petticoats had got fired with the ambition to learn a great deal more about the strange secrets of colour . He had already a high reputation in the district for his dyes , and he was bent on discovering some method by which he could reduce the expense of crimsons and scarlets . The druggist at Treddleston had given him a notion that he might save himself a great deal of labour and expense if he could learn to read , and so he had begun to give his spare hours to the night - school , resolving that his "
113724	113777	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" should lose no time in coming to Mr. Massey 's day - school as soon as he was old enough . It was touching to see these three big men , with the marks of their hard labour about them , anxiously bending over the worn books and painfully making out , "
113783	113784	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" "
113790	113791	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" "
113796	113987	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" - a very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single words all alike except in the first letter . It was almost as if three rough animals were making humble efforts to learn how they might become human . And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle Massey 's nature , for such full - grown children as these were the only pupils for whom he had no severe epithets and no impatient tones . He was not gifted with an imperturbable temper , and on music - nights it was apparent that patience could never be an easy virtue to him ; but this evening , as he glances over his spectacles at Bill Downes , the sawyer , who is turning his head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness before the letters d - r - y , his eyes shed their mildest and most encouraging light . After the reading class , two youths between sixteen and nineteen came up with the imaginary bills of parcels , which they had been writing out on their slates and were now required to calculate "
113991	114052	113461	113461	Brimstone	347	" - a test which they stood with such imperfect success that Bartle Massey , whose eyes had been glaring at them ominously through his spectacles for some minutes , at length burst out in a bitter , high - pitched tone , pausing between every sentence to rap the floor with a knobbed stick which rested between his legs . "
114651	114772	114774	114774	he	2741	" With this final sentence , Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than ever with his knobbed stick , and the discomfited lads got up to go with a sulky look . The other pupils had happily only their writing - books to show , in various stages of progress from pot - hooks to round text ; and mere pen - strokes , however perverse , were less exasperating to Bartle than false arithmetic . He was a little more severe than usual on Jacob Storey 's Z 's , of which poor Jacob had written a pageful , all with their tops turned the wrong way , with a puzzled sense that they were not right ' somehow . "
114797	114822	114790	114790	he	2741	" to finish off th ' alphabet , like , though ampusand would ha ' done as well , for what he could see . "
114835	114840	114834	114834	their	2742	" Good - nights , "
114855	114866	114842	114842	Adam	127	" Shall I put the candles out , Mr. Massey ? "
114867	114900	114902	114902	Bartle	206	" Yes , my boy , yes , all but this , which I 'll carry into the house ; and just lock the outer door , now you 're near it , "
115125	115138	115140	115141	the schoolmaster	7486	" Well , Vixen , well then , how are the babbies ? "
115238	115253	115255	115255	Adam	127	" Why , you 've got a family , I see , Mr. Massey ? "
115266	115280	115255	115255	Adam	127	" How 's that ? I thought it was against the law here . "
115281	115308	115310	115310	Bartle	206	" Law ? What 's the use o ' law when a man 's once such a fool as to let a woman into his house ? "
115344	115399	115336	115336	he	206	" If I 'd known Vixen was a woman , I 'd never have held the boys from drowning her ; but when I 'd got her into my hand , I was forced to take to her . And now you see what she 's brought me to - the sly , hypocritical wench "
115437	115481	115426	115426	her	353	" and contrived to be brought to bed on a Sunday at church - time . I 've wished again and again I 'd been a bloody minded man , that I could have strangled the mother and the brats with one cord . "
115482	115497	115499	115499	Adam	127	" I 'm glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church , "
115501	115531	115426	115426	her	353	" I was afraid you must be ill for the first time i ' your life . And I was particularly sorry not to have you at church yesterday . "
115532	115546	115548	115548	Bartle	206	" Ah , my boy , I know why , I know why , "
115574	115644	115645	115645	Bartel	354	" You 've had a rough bit o ' road to get over since I saw you - a rough bit o ' road . But I 'm in hopes there are better times coming for you . I 've got some news to tell you . But I must get my supper first , for I 'm hungry , I 'm hungry . Sit down , sit down . "
115871	115910	115912	115912	Bartle	206	" Now , then , my boy , draw up , draw up . We 'll not talk about business till we 've had our supper . No man can be wise on an empty stomach . But , "
115920	115976	115977	115977	He	206	" I must give Vixen her supper too , confound her ! Though she 'll do nothing with it but nourish those unnecessary babbies . That 's the way with these women - they 've got no head - pieces to nourish , and so their food all runs either to fat or to brats . "
116011	116021	116023	116023	Adam	127	" I 've had my supper , Mr. Massey , "
116063	116064	116055	116055	they	5386	" "
116072	116087	116065	116065	I	0	" said Bartle dryly , cutting his bread and not shrinking from the crust . "
116223	116224	116227	116228	Mr. Massey	349	" "
116230	116249	116227	116228	Mr. Massey	349	" said Adam , who took his old friend 's whim more seriously than usual to - night , "
116296	116297	116277	116278	a wife	816	" "
116858	116931	116934	116934	Vixen	353	" Bartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his invective that he had forgotten his supper , and only used the knife for the purpose of rapping the table with the haft . But towards the close , the raps became so sharp and frequent , and his voice so quarrelsome , that Vixen felt it incumbent on her to jump out of the hamper and bark vaguely . "
116936	116945	116934	116934	Vixen	353	" snarled Bartle , turning round upon her . "
116966	117110	116959	116959	your	353	" Vixen returned to her hamper again in humiliation , and her master continued his supper in a silence which Adam did not choose to interrupt ; he knew the old man would be in a better humour when he had had his supper and lighted his pipe . Adam was used to hear him talk in this way , but had never learned so much of Bartle 's past life as to know whether his view of married comfort was founded on experience . On that point Bartle was mute , and it was even a secret where he had lived previous to the twenty years in which happily for the peasants and artisans of this neighbourhood he had been settled among them as their only schoolmaster . If anything like a question was ventured on this subject , Bartle always replied , "
117128	117150	117228	117228	they	2823	" and the Loamshire men would as soon have thought of asking for a particular town or village in Africa as in "
117154	117155	117228	117228	they	2823	" "
117162	117184	117228	117228	they	2823	" said Bartle , at last , when he had poured out his second mug of ale and lighted his pipe , "
117210	117211	117228	117228	they	2823	" "
117214	117218	117228	117228	they	2823	" said Adam , "
117224	117225	117228	117228	they	2823	" "
117279	117338	117339	117339	Satchell	326	" Here Bartle gave a series of fierce and rapid puffs , looking earnestly the while at Adam . Your impatient loquacious man has never any notion of keeping his pipe alight by gentle measured puffs ; he is always letting it go nearly out , and then punishing it for that negligence . At last he said , "
117387	117388	117382	117382	he	2825	" "
117391	117395	117382	117382	he	2825	" said Adam , "
117560	117561	117545	117545	I	0	" "
117572	117576	117568	117568	I	0	" said Bartle , "

117801	117805	117793	117793	they	2855	" said Adam ; "
117815	117816	117819	117819	he	126	" "
118014	118015	118016	118016	I	0	" "
118027	118031	118024	118025	Mr. Massey	349	" said Adam . "
118082	118083	118076	118076	he	7317	" "
118097	118101	118090	118090	You	146	" said Bartle . "
118832	118833	118823	118826	th ' old squire	7317	" "
118844	118849	118823	118826	th ' old squire	7317	" said Bartle meditatively . "
118882	118883	118877	118878	the captain	5836	" "
118891	118895	118896	118897	the squire	2294	" said Adam ; "
119051	119052	119070	119070	you	5849	" "
119368	119420	119431	119431	you	2912	" During this rather heated exhortation to coolness and discretion the pipe had gone out , and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking a light furiously , after which he puffed with fierce resolution , fixing his eye still on Adam , who was trying not to laugh . "
119437	119449	119434	119435	Mr. Massey	349	" Adam began , as soon as he felt quite serious , "
119625	119626	119617	119617	I	0	" "
119646	119690	119631	119631	we	2914	" said Bartle , taking up his stick . Vixen was at once on her legs , and without further words the three walked out into the starlight , by the side of Bartle 's potato - beds , to the little gate . "
119707	119725	119701	119701	you	2912	" said the old man , as he closed the gate after Adam and leaned against it . "
119730	119833	119701	119701	you	2912	" said Adam , striding along towards the streak of pale road . He was the only object moving on the wide common . The two grey donkeys , just visible in front of the gorse bushes , stood as still as limestone images - as still as the grey - thatched roof of the mud cottage a little farther on . Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed into the darkness , while Vixen , in a state of divided affection , had twice run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her puppies . "
119838	119847	119701	119701	you	2912	" muttered the schoolmaster , as Adam disappeared , "
120015	120044	120006	120006	he	753	" Here Vixen tucked her tail between her legs and ran forward into the house . Subjects are sometimes broached which a well - bred female will ignore . "
120058	120062	120063	120063	She	2922	" continued Bartle . "
120079	120437	120438	120442	the heir " was born	7588	" Book Three Chapter XXII Going to the Birthday Feast THE thirtieth of July was come , and it was one of those half - dozen warm days which sometimes occur in the middle of a rainy English summer . No rain had fallen for the last three or four days , and the weather was perfect for that time of the year : there was less dust than usual on the dark - green hedge - rows and on the wild camomile that starred the roadside , yet the grass was dry enough for the little children to roll on it , and there was no cloud but a long dash of light , downy ripple , high , high up in the far - off blue sky . Perfect weather for an outdoor July merry - making , yet surely not the best time of year to be born in . Nature seems to make a hot pause just then : all the loveliest flowers are gone ; the sweet time of early growth and vague hopes is past ; and yet the time of harvest and ingathering is not come , and we tremble at the possible storms that may ruin the precious fruit in the moment of its ripeness . The woods are all one dark monotonous green ; the waggon - loads of hay no longer creep along the lanes , scattering their sweet - smelling fragments on the blackberry branches ; the pastures are often a little tanned , yet the corn has not got its last splendour of red and gold ; the lambs and calves have lost all traces of their innocent frisky prettiness , and have become stupid young sheep and cows . But it is a time of leisure on the farm - that pause between hay - and corn - harvest , and so the farmers and labourers in Hayslope and Broxton thought the captain did well to come of age just then , when they could give their undivided minds to the flavour of the great cask of ale which had been brewed the autumn after "
120440	120690	120063	120063	She	2922	" was born , and was to be tapped on his twenty - first birthday . The air had been merry with the ringing of church - bells very early this morning , and every one had made haste to get through the needful work before twelve , when it would be time to think of getting ready to go to the Chase . The midday sun was streaming into Hetty 's bedchamber , and there was no blind to temper the heat with which it fell on her head as she looked at herself in the old specked glass . Still , that was the only glass she had in which she could see her neck and arms , for the small hanging glass she had fetched out of the next room - the room that had been Dinah 's - would show her nothing below her little chin ; and that beautiful bit of neck where the roundness of her cheek melted into another roundness shadowed by dark delicate curls . And to - day she thought more than usual about her neck and arms ; for at the dance this evening she was not to wear any neckerchief , and she had been busy yesterday with her spotted pink - and - white frock , that she might make the sleeves either long or short at will . She was dressed now just as she was to be in the evening , with a tucker made of "
120692	121100	120438	120442	the heir " was born	7588	" lace , which her aunt had lent her for this unparalleled occasion , but with no ornaments besides ; she had even taken out her small round ear - rings which she wore every day . But there was something more to be done , apparently , before she put on her neckerchief and long sleeves , which she was to wear in the day - time , for now she unlocked the drawer that held her private treasures . It is more than a month since we saw her unlock that drawer before , and now it holds new treasures , so much more precious than the old ones that these are thrust into the corner . Hetty would not care to put the large coloured glass ear - rings into her ears now ; for see ! she has got a beautiful pair of gold and pearls and garnet , lying snugly in a pretty little box lined with white satin . Oh , the delight of taking out that little box and looking at the ear - rings ! Do not reason about it , my philosphical reader , and say that Hetty , being very pretty , must have known that it did not signify whether she had on any ornaments or not ; and that , moreover , to look at ear - rings which she could not possibly wear out of her bedroom could hardly be a satisfaction , the essence of vanity being a reference to the impressions produced on others ; you will never understand women 's natures if you are so excessively rational . Try rather to divest yourself of all your rational prejudices , as much as if you were studying the psychology of a canary bird , and only watch the movements of this pretty round creature as she turns her head on one side with an unconscious smile at the ear - rings nestled in the little box . Ah , you think , it is for the sake of the person who has given them to her , and her thoughts are gone back now to the moment when they were put into her hands . No ; else why should she have cared to have ear - rings rather than anything else ? And I know that she had longed for ear - rings from among all the ornaments she could imagine . "
121106	121130	120438	120442	the heir " was born	7588	" Arthur had said , pretending to pinch them one evening , as Hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat . "
121141	122175	120438	120442	the heir " was born	7588	" she said in a moment , almost before she knew what she was saying - the wish lay so close to her lips , it WOULD flutter past them at the slightest breath . And the next day - it was only last week - Arthur had ridden over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them . That little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the prettiest bit of childishness ; he had never heard anything like it before ; and he had wrapped the box up in a great many covers , that he might see Hetty unwrapping it with growing curiosity , till at last her eyes flashed back their new delight into his . No , she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the ear - rings , for now she is taking them out of the box , not to press them to her lips , but to fasten them in her ears - only for one moment , to see how pretty they look , as she peeps at them in the glass against the wall , with first one position of the head and then another , like a listening bird . It is impossible to be wise on the subject of ear - rings as one looks at her ; what should those delicate pearls and crystals be made for , if not for such ears ? One can not even find fault with the tiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out ; perhaps water - nixies , and such lovely things without souls , have these little round holes in their ears by nature , ready to hang jewels in . And Hetty must be one of them : it is too painful to think that she is a woman , with a woman 's destiny before her - a woman spinning in young ignorance a light web of folly and vain hopes which may one day close round her and press upon her , a rancorous poisoned garment , changing all at once her fluttering , trivial butterfly sensations into a life of deep human anguish . But she can not keep in the ear - rings long , else she may make her uncle and aunt wait . She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them up . Some day she will be able to wear any ear - rings she likes , and already she lives in an invisible world of brilliant costumes , shimmering gauze , soft satin , and velvet , such as the lady 's maid at the Chase has shown her in Miss Lydia 's wardrobe . She feels the bracelets on her arms , and treads on a soft carpet in front of a tall mirror . But she has one thing in the drawer which she can venture to wear to - day , because she can hang it on the chain of dark - brown berries which she has been used to wear on grand days , with a tiny flat scent - bottle at the end of it tucked inside her frock ; and she must put on her brown berries - her neck would look so unfinished without it . Hetty was not quite as fond of the locket as of the ear - rings , though it was a handsome large locket , with enamelled flowers at the back and a beautiful gold border round the glass , which showed a light - brown slightly waving lock , forming a background for two little dark rings . She must keep it under her clothes , and no one would see it . But Hetty had another passion , only a little less strong than her love of finery , and that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in her bosom . She would always have worn it , if she had dared to encounter her aunt 's questions about a ribbon round her neck . So now she slipped it on along her chain of dark - brown berries , and snapped the chain round her neck . It was not a very long chain , only allowing the locket to hang a little way below the edge of her frock . And now she had nothing to do but to put on her long sleeves , her new white gauze neckerchief , and her straw hat trimmed with white to - day instead of the pink , which had become rather faded under the July sun . That hat made the drop of bitterness in Hetty 's cup to - day , for it was not quite new - everybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white ribbon - and Mary Burge , she felt sure , would have a new hat or bonnet on . She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton stockings : they really were very nice indeed , and she had given almost all her spare money for them . Hetty 's dream of the future could not make her insensible to triumph in the present . To be sure , Captain Donnithorne loved her so that he would never care about looking at other people , but then those other people did n't know how he loved her , and she was not satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for a short space . The whole party was assembled in the house - place when Hetty went down , all of course in their Sunday clothes ; and the bells had been ringing so this morning in honour of the captain 's twenty - first birthday , and the work had all been got done so early , that Marty and Tommy were not quite easy in their minds until their mother had assured them that going to church was not part of the day 's festivities . Mr. Poyser had once suggested that the house should be shut up and left to take care of itself ; "
122178	122182	120438	120442	the heir " was born	7588	" said he , "
122231	122240	122241	122241	I	0	" But Mrs. Poyser answered with great decision : "
122377	122378	122371	122371	he	2938	" "
122387	122392	122371	122371	he	2938	" said Mr. Poyser ; "
122498	122775	122492	122492	Alick	230	" Mrs. Poyser accepted this compromise , but thought it advisable to bar and bolt to the utmost ; and now , at the last moment before starting , Nancy , the dairy - maid , was closing the shutters of the house - place , although the window , lying under the immediate observation of Alick and the dogs , might have been supposed the least likely to be selected for a burglarious attempt . The covered cart , without springs , was standing ready to carry the whole family except the men - servants . Mr. Poyser and the grandfather sat on the seat in front , and within there was room for all the women and children ; the fuller the cart the better , because then the jolting would not hurt so much , and Nancy 's broad person and thick arms were an excellent cushion to be pitched on . But Mr. Poyser drove at no more than a walking pace , that there might be as little risk of jolting as possible on this warm day , and there was time to exchange greetings and remarks with the foot - passengers who were going the same way , specking the paths between the green meadows and the golden cornfields with bits of movable bright colour - a scarlet waistcoat to match the poppies that nodded a little too thickly among the corn , or a dark - blue neckerchief with ends flaunting across a brand - new white smock - frock . All Broxton and all Hayslope were to be at the Chase , and make merry there in honour of "
122779	122932	123076	123076	Totty	242	" ; and the old men and women , who had never been so far down this side of the hill for the last twenty years , were being brought from Broxton and Hayslope in one of the farmer 's waggons , at Mr. Irwine 's suggestion . The church - bells had struck up again now - a last tune , before the ringers came down the hill to have their share in the festival ; and before the bells had finished , other music was heard approaching , so that even Old Brown , the sober horse that was drawing Mr. Poyser 's cart , began to prick up his ears . It was the band of the Benefit Club , which had mustered in all its glory - that is to say , in bright - blue scarfs and blue favours , and carrying its banner with the motto , "
122938	122978	123076	123076	Totty	242	" encircling a picture of a stone - pit . The carts , of course , were not to enter the Chase . Every one must get down at the lodges , and the vehicles must be sent back . "
122989	123042	123043	123043	I	0	" said Mrs. Poyser , as she got down from the cart , and saw the groups scattered under the great oaks , and the boys running about in the hot sunshine to survey the tall poles surmounted by the fluttering garments that were to be the prize of the successful climbers . "
123122	123123	123113	123114	Mrs. Best	248	" "
123132	123137	123113	123114	Mrs. Best	248	" said Mr. Poyser . "
123190	123191	123188	123188	Father	174	" "
123196	123221	123188	123188	Father	174	" said old Martin , walking slowly under the shade of the lodge porch , from which he could see the aged party descend . "
123241	123288	123224	123225	Jacob Taft	362	" He felt himself quite a youngster , with a long life before him , as he saw the Hayslope patriarch , old Feyther Taft , descend from the waggon and walk towards him , in his brown nightcap , and leaning on his two sticks . "
123294	123328	123291	123292	Mester Taft	363	" shouted old Martin , at the utmost stretch of his voice - for though he knew the old man was stone deaf , he could not omit the propriety of a greeting - "
123352	123353	123354	123355	Your sarvant	2954	" "
123362	123796	123359	123360	your sarvant	2954	" said Feyther Taft in a treble tone , perceiving that he was in company . The aged group , under care of sons or daughters , themselves worn and grey , passed on along the least - winding carriage - road towards the house , where a special table was prepared for them ; while the Poyser party wisely struck across the grass under the shade of the great trees , but not out of view of the house - front , with its sloping lawn and flower - beds , or of the pretty striped marquee at the edge of the lawn , standing at right angles with two larger marquees on each side of the open green space where the games were to be played . The house would have been nothing but a plain square mansion of Queen Anne 's time , but for the remnant of an old abbey to which it was united at one end , in much the same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high and prim at the end of older and lower farm - offices . The fine old remnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches , but the sun was now on the taller and more advanced front , the blinds were all down , and the house seemed asleep in the hot midday . It made Hetty quite sad to look at it : Arthur must be somewhere in the back rooms , with the grand company , where he could not possibly know that she was come , and she should not see him for a long , long while - not till after dinner , when they said he was to come up and make a speech . But Hetty was wrong in part of her conjecture . No grand company was come except the Irwines , for whom the carriage had been sent early , and Arthur was at that moment not in a back room , but walking with the rector into the broad stone cloisters of the old abbey , where the long tables were laid for all the cottage tenants and the farm - servants . A very handsome young Briton he looked to - day , in high spirits and a bright - blue frock - coat , the highest mode - his arm no longer in a sling . So open - looking and candid , too ; but candid people have their secrets , and secrets leave no lines in young faces . "
123801	123812	123359	123360	your sarvant	2954	" he said , as they entered the cool cloisters , "
123905	123906	123887	123887	he	5867	" "
123920	123925	123910	123910	you	2960	" said Mr. Irwine . "
124040	124041	124014	124014	You	2960	" "
124126	124209	124217	124217	they	2974	" They went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long gallery above the cloisters , a gallery where all the dusty worthless old pictures had been banished for the last three generations - mouldy portraits of Queen Elizabeth and her ladies , General Monk with his eye knocked out , Daniel very much in the dark among the lions , and Julius Caesar on horseback , with a high nose and laurel crown , holding his Commentaries in his hand . "
124226	124230	124217	124217	they	2974	" said Arthur . "
124380	124381	124368	124368	you	2996	" "
124388	124393	124368	124368	you	2996	" said Mr. Irwine . "
124405	124406	124394	124394	I	0	" "
124419	124423	124394	124394	I	0	" said Arthur . "
124457	124466	124467	124467	My	0	" he continued , as they sat down . "
124475	124476	124467	124468	My grandfather	5867	" "
124482	124483	124480	124480	Adam	127	" "
124776	124777	124787	124787	woman	678	" "
124866	125105	125132	125132	he	173	" Well , I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him and he seemed to hesitate at first . His objection was that he thought he should not be able to satisfy my grandfather . But I begged him as a personal favour to me not to let any reason prevent him from accepting the place , if he really liked the employment and would not be giving up anything that was more profitable to him . And he assured me he should like it of all things - it would be a great step forward for him in business , and it would enable him to do what he had long wished to do , to give up working for Burge . He says he shall have plenty of time to superintend a little business of his own , which he and Seth will carry on , and will perhaps be able to enlarge by degrees . So he has agreed at last , and I have arranged that he shall dine with the large tenants to - day ; and I mean to announce the appointment to them , and ask them to drink Adam 's health . It 's a little drama I 've got up in honour of my friend Adam . He 's a fine fellow , and I like the opportunity of letting people know that I think so . "
125106	125123	125125	125126	Mr. Irwine	173	" A drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a pretty part to play , "
125142	125225	125137	125137	he	173	" My part , you know , is always that of the old fogy who sees nothing to admire in the young folks . I do n't like to admit that I 'm proud of my pupil when he does graceful things . But I must play the amiable old gentleman for once , and second your toast in honour of Adam . Has your grandfather yielded on the other point too , and agreed to have a respectable man as steward ? "
125226	125230	125232	125232	Arthur	211	" Oh no , "
125255	125326	125137	125137	he	173	" He 's got some project or other about letting the Chase Farm and bargaining for a supply of milk and butter for the house . But I ask no questions about it - it makes me too angry . I believe he means to do all the business himself , and have nothing in the shape of a steward . It 's amazing what energy he has , though . "
125327	125338	125340	125341	Mr. Irwine	173	" Well , we 'll go to the ladies now , "
125346	125366	125340	125341	Mr. Irwine	173	" I want to tell my mother what a splendid throne you 've prepared for her under the marquee . "
125367	125379	125381	125381	Arthur	211	" Yes , and we must be going to luncheon too , "
125383	125404	125381	125381	Arthur	211	" It must be two o'clock , for there is the gong beginning to sound for the tenants ' dinners . "
125498	125503	125504	125504	he	127	" Seth , lad , "
125507	125577	125504	125504	he	127	" the captain has sent to say I 'm to dine upstairs - he wishes it particular , Mr. Mills says , so I suppose it ' ud be behaving ill for me not to go . But I do n't like sitting up above thee and mother , as if I was better than my own flesh and blood . Thee't not take it unkind , I hope ? "
125578	125585	125587	125587	Seth	128	" Nay , nay , lad , "
125589	125669	125587	125587	Seth	128	" thy honour 's our honour ; and if thee get'st respect , thee'st won it by thy own deserts . The further I see thee above me , the better , so long as thee feel'st like a brother to me . It 's because o ' thy being appointed over the woods , and it 's nothing but what 's right . That 's a place o ' trust , and thee't above a common workman now . "
125670	125673	125675	125675	Adam	127	" Aye , "
125677	125770	125675	125675	Adam	127	" but nobody knows a word about it yet . I have n't given notice to Mr. Burge about leaving him , and I do n't like to tell anybody else about it before he knows , for he 'll be a good bit hurt , I doubt . People ' ull be wondering to see me there , and they 'll like enough be guessing the reason and asking questions , for there 's been so much talk up and down about my having the place , this last three weeks . "
125771	125811	125812	125812	Adam	127	" Well , thee canst say thee wast ordered to come without being told the reason . That 's the truth . And mother ' ull be fine and joyful about it . Let 's go and tell her . "
125948	125950	125952	125952	Hetty	177	" joked "
125973	125979	125981	125981	Adam	127	" Well , Mester Massey , "
125987	126007	125981	125981	Adam	127	" I 'm going to dine upstairs with you to - day : the captain 's sent me orders . "
126008	126011	126013	126013	Bartle	206	" Ah ! "
126024	126053	126013	126013	Bartle	206	" Then there 's something in the wind - there 's something in the wind . Have you heard anything about what the old squire means to do ? "
126054	126059	126061	126061	Adam	127	" Why , yes , "
126063	126114	126061	126061	Adam	127	" I 'll tell you what I know , because I believe you can keep a still tongue in your head if you like , and I hope you 'll not let drop a word till it 's common talk , for I 've particular reasons against its being known . "
126115	126168	125981	125981	Adam	127	" Trust to me , my boy , trust to me . I 've got no wife to worm it out of me and then run out and cackle it in everybody 's hearing . If you trust a man , let him be a bachelor - let him be a bachelor . "
126169	126267	126013	126013	Bartle	206	" Well , then , it was so far settled yesterday that I 'm to take the management o ' the woods . The captain sent for me t ' offer it me , when I was seeing to the poles and things here and I 've agreed to't . But if anybody asks any questions upstairs , just you take no notice , and turn the talk to something else , and I 'll be obliged to you . Now , let us go on , for we 're pretty nigh the last , I think . "
126268	126278	126280	126280	Bartle	206	" I know what to do , never fear , "
126285	126344	126280	126280	Bartle	206	" The news will be good sauce to my dinner . Aye , aye , my boy , you 'll get on . I 'll back you for an eye at measuring and a head - piece for figures , against any man in this county and you 've had good teaching - you 've had good teaching . "
126384	126390	126377	126377	Adam	127	" It stands to sense , "
126396	126438	126391	126392	Mr. Casson	146	" as old Mr. Poyser , as is th ' oldest man i ' the room , should sit at top o ' the table . I was n't butler fifteen year without learning the rights and the wrongs about dinner . "
126439	126444	126446	126447	old Martin	215	" Nay , nay , "
126449	126489	126446	126447	old Martin	215	" I'n gi'en up to my son ; I 'm no tenant now : let my son take my place . Th ' ould foulks ha ' had their turn : they mun make way for the young uns . "
126490	126510	126512	126513	Luke Britton	264	" I should ha ' thought the biggest tenant had the best right , more nor th ' oldest , "
126525	126541	126512	126513	Luke Britton	264	" there 's Mester Holdsworth has more land nor anybody else on th ' estate . "
126542	126545	126547	126548	Mr. Poyser	208	" Well , "
126581	126582	126512	126513	Luke Britton	264	" "
126590	126611	126587	126588	Mester Massey	344	" said Mr. Craig , who , being a neutral in the dispute , had no interest but in conciliation ; "
126639	126640	126636	126637	Mr. Massey	349	" "
126647	126651	126654	126654	he	3038	" said Bartle ; "
126673	126812	126665	126667	the next broadest	3041	" This happy mode of settling the dispute produced much laughter - a smaller joke would have sufficed for that Mr. Casson , however , did not feel it compatible with his dignity and superior knowledge to join in the laugh , until it turned out that he was fixed on as the second broadest man . Martin Poyser the younger , as the broadest , was to be president , and Mr. Casson , as next broadest , was to be vice . Owing to this arrangement , Adam , being , of course , at the bottom of the table , fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson , who , too much occupied with the question of precedence , had not hitherto noticed his entrance . Mr. Casson , we have seen , considered Adam "
126820	126856	126665	126667	the next broadest	3041	" : he thought the gentry made more fuss about this young carpenter than was necessary ; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson , although he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years . "
126873	126882	126862	126862	you	342	" he said , when Adam sat down . "
126894	126895	126883	126883	You	342	" "
126901	126918	126898	126899	Mr. Casson	146	" said Adam , in his strong voice , that could be heard along the table ; "
126946	126947	126936	126936	I	0	" "
126952	126959	126936	126936	I	0	" said several voices at once , "
126976	126977	126979	126979	ye'll	3048	" "
126997	127002	126995	126995	ye	3048	" said Mr. Chowne . "
127013	127014	127015	127015	Peeh	370	" "
127017	127022	127015	127015	Peeh	370	" said Mr. Craig ; "
127112	127113	127103	127103	He	3051	" "
127118	127125	127103	127103	He	3051	" said Bartle Massey , contemptuously ; "
127197	127198	127186	127186	I	0	" "
127217	127222	127211	127211	they	5433	" said Mr. Craig . "
127237	127251	127231	127235	a scolding , nagging woman	3057	" Bartle went on , without deigning to notice Mr. Craig 's remark . "
127301	127454	127276	127278	the Scotch tunes	3059	" Adam minded the less about sitting by Mr. Casson , because this position enabled him to see Hetty , who was not far off him at the next table . Hetty , however , had not even noticed his presence yet , for she was giving angry attention to Totty , who insisted on drawing up her feet on to the bench in antique fashion , and thereby threatened to make dusty marks on Hetty 's pink - and - white frock . No sooner were the little fat legs pushed down than up they came again , for Totty 's eyes were too busy in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum pudding was for her to retain any consciousness of her legs . Hetty got quite out of patience , and at last , with a frown and pout , and gathering tears , she said , "
127481	127482	127468	127468	she	242	" "
127498	127503	127492	127492	She	5962	" said the mother . "
127524	128038	128039	128040	My grandfather	5867	" Adam was looking at Hetty , and saw the frown , and pout , and the dark eyes seeming to grow larger with pettish half - gathered tears . Quiet Mary Burge , who sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that Adam 's eyes were fixed on her , thought that so sensible a man as Adam must be reflecting on the small value of beauty in a woman whose temper was bad . Mary was a good girl , not given to indulge in evil feelings , but she said to herself , that , since Hetty had a bad temper , it was better Adam should know it . And it was quite true that if Hetty had been plain , she would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that moment , and no one 's moral judgment upon her would have been in the least beguiled . But really there was something quite charming in her pettishness : it looked so much more like innocent distress than ill humour ; and the severe Adam felt no movement of disapprobation ; he only felt a sort of amused pity , as if he had seen a kitten setting up its back , or a little bird with its feathers ruffled . He could not gather what was vexing her , but it was impossible to him to feel otherwise than that she was the prettiest thing in the world , and that if he could have his way , nothing should ever vex her any more . And presently , when Totty was gone , she caught his eye , and her face broke into one of its brightest smiles , as she nodded to him . It was a bit of flirtation - she knew Mary Burge was looking at them . But the smile was like wine to Adam . Chapter XXIV The Health - Drinking WHEN the dinner was over , and the first draughts from the great cask of birthday ale were brought up , room was made for the broad Mr. Poyser at the side of the table , and two chairs were placed at the head . It had been settled very definitely what Mr. Poyser was to do when the young squire should appear , and for the last five minutes he had been in a state of abstraction , with his eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite , and his hands busy with the loose cash and other articles in his breeches pockets . When the young squire entered , with Mr. Irwine by his side , every one stood up , and this moment of homage was very agreeable to Arthur . He liked to feel his own importance , and besides that , he cared a great deal for the good - will of these people : he was fond of thinking that they had a hearty , special regard for him . The pleasure he felt was in his face as he said , "
128090	128122	128123	128123	Captain	3067	" All eyes were now turned on Mr. Poyser , who , with his hands still busy in his pockets , began with the deliberateness of a slow - striking clock . "
128506	128777	128778	128778	I	0	" Hereupon a glorious shouting , a rapping , a jingling , a clattering , and a shouting , with plentiful da capo , pleasanter than a strain of sublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first time . Arthur had felt a twinge of conscience during Mr. Poyser 's speech , but it was too feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being praised . Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole ? If there was something in his conduct that Poyser would n't have liked if he had known it , why , no man 's conduct will bear too close an inspection ; and Poyser was not likely to know it ; and , after all , what had he done ? Gone a little too far , perhaps , in flirtation , but another man in his place would have acted much worse ; and no harm would come - no harm should come , for the next time he was alone with Hetty , he would explain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had passed . It was necessary to Arthur , you perceive , to be satisfied with himself . Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions for the future , which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be uncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr. Poyser 's slow speech was finished , and when it was time for him to speak he was quite light - hearted . "
128789	128793	128780	128780	you	3093	" Arthur said , "
129208	129255	129256	129256	he	5867	" Perhaps there was no one present except Mr. Irwine who thoroughly understood and approved Arthur 's graceful mode of proposing his grandfather 's health . The farmers thought the young squire knew well enough that they hated the old squire , and Mrs. Poyser said , "
129270	129301	129256	129256	he	5867	" The bucolic mind does not readily apprehend the refinements of good taste . But the toast could not be rejected and when it had been drunk , Arthur said , "
129692	129835	129672	129672	I.	0	" This toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting to the last , and it certainly was the most picturesque moment in the scene when Mr. Irwine got up to speak , and all the faces in the room were turned towards him . The superior refinement of his face was much more striking than that of Arthur 's when seen in comparison with the people round them . Arthur 's was a much commoner British face , and the splendour of his new - fashioned clothes was more akin to the young farmer 's taste in costume than Mr. Irwine 's powder and the well - brushed but well - worn black , which seemed to be his chosen suit for great occasions ; for he had the mysterious secret of never wearing a new - looking coat . "
129848	129852	129672	129672	I.	0	" he said , "
130400	130417	130378	130378	I	0	" As Mr. Irwine paused , Arthur jumped up and , filling his glass , said , "
130438	130457	130378	130378	I	0	" No hearer , not even Bartle Massey , was so delighted with this toast as Mr. Poyser . "
130460	130684	130685	130685	I	0	" as his first speech had been , he would have started up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity of such a course . As it was , he found an outlet for his feeling in drinking his ale unusually fast , and setting down his glass with a swing of his arm and a determined rap . If Jonathan Burge and a few others felt less comfortable on the occasion , they tried their best to look contented , and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill apparently unanimous . Adam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends . He was a good deal moved by this public tribute - very naturally , for he was in the presence of all his little world , and it was uniting to do him honour . But he felt no shyness about speaking , not being troubled with small vanity or lack of words ; he looked neither awkward nor embarrassed , but stood in his usual firm upright attitude , with his head thrown a little backward and his hands perfectly still , in that rough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent , honest , well - built workmen , who are never wondering what is their business in the world . "
130692	130696	130685	130685	I	0	" he said . "
131138	131324	131327	131327	you	3182	" There were various opinions about Adam 's speech : some of the women whispered that he did n't show himself thankful enough , and seemed to speak as proud as could be ; but most of the men were of opinion that nobody could speak more straightfor'ard , and that Adam was as fine a chap as need to be . While such observations were being buzzed about , mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a bailiff , and whether he was going to have a steward , the two gentlemen had risen , and were walking round to the table where the wives and children sat . There was none of the strong ale here , of course , but wine and dessert - sparkling gooseberry for the young ones , and some good sherry for the mothers . Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table , and Totty was now seated in her lap , bending her small nose deep down into a wine - glass in search of the nuts floating there . "
131333	131337	131327	131327	you	3182	" said Arthur . "
131355	131356	131327	131327	you	3182	" "
131389	131390	131381	131381	you	5336	" "
131404	131411	131395	131395	you	5336	" said Mr. Irwine , laughing . "
131468	131469	131461	131461	he	6066	" "
131482	131495	131473	131473	I	0	" Arthur said , looking round at the apple - cheeked children . "
131535	131948	131527	131527	them	3192	" He walked on , speaking to the mothers and patting the children , while Mr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a distance , that no one 's attention might be disturbed from the young squire , the hero of the day . Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty , but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side . The foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent ; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect , even when she knows it to be the mask of love ? Hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable day she had had for a long while , a moment of chill daylight and reality came across her dream : Arthur , who had seemed so near to her only a few hours before , was separated from her , as the hero of a great procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd . Chapter XXV The Games THE great dance was not to begin until eight o'clock , but for any lads and lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass before then , there was music always at hand - for was not the band of the Benefit Club capable of playing excellent jigs , reels , and hornpipes ? And , besides this , there was a grand band hired from Rosseter , who , with their wonderful wind - instruments and puffed - out cheeks , were themselves a delightful show to the small boys and girls . To say nothing of Joshua Rann 's fiddle , which , by an act of generous forethought , he had provided himself with , in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to prefer dancing to a solo on that instrument . Meantime , when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of the house , the games began . There were , of course , well - soaped poles to be climbed by the boys and youths , races to be run by the old women , races to be run in sacks , heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men , and a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of walking as many yards possible on one leg - feats in which it was generally remarked that Wiry Ben , being "
131959	132267	131527	131527	them	3192	" was sure to be pre - eminent . To crown all , there was to be a donkey - race - that sublimest of all races , conducted on the grand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody else 's donkey , and the sorriest donkey winning . And soon after four o'clock , splendid old Mrs. Irwine , in her damask satin and jewels and black lace , was led out by Arthur , followed by the whole family party , to her raised seat under the striped marquee , where she was to give out the prizes to the victors . Staid , formal Miss Lydia had requested to resign that queenly office to the royal old lady , and Arthur was pleased with this opportunity of gratifying his godmother 's taste for stateliness . Old Mr. Donnithorne , the delicately clean , finely scented , withered old man , led out Miss Irwine , with his air of punctilious , acid politeness ; Mr. Gawaine brought Miss Lydia , looking neutral and stiff in an elegant peach - blossom silk ; and Mr. Irwine came last with his pale sister Anne . No other friend of the family , besides Mr. Gawaine , was invited to - day ; there was to be a grand dinner for the neighbouring gentry on the morrow , but to - day all the forces were required for the entertainment of the tenants . There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee , dividing the lawn from the park , but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the victors , and the groups of people standing , or seated here and there on benches , stretched on each side of the open space from the white marquees up to the sunk fence . "
132277	132307	131527	131527	them	3192	" said the old lady , in her deep voice , when she was seated , and looked round on the bright scene with its dark - green background ; "
132350	132351	132352	132352	You	0	" "
132360	132364	132352	132352	You	0	" said Arthur , "
132377	132378	132368	132368	I	0	" "
132491	132492	132485	132485	I	0	" "
132503	132508	132501	132501	Mother	185	" said Mr. Irwine . "
132582	132583	132578	132578	she	3207	" "
132621	132622	132615	132615	I	0	" "
132629	132646	132626	132626	you	0	" said old Mr. Donnithorne , who was holding a double glass up to his eyes , "

132791	132792	132777	132789	a man who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars	3213	" "
132795	132799	132777	132789	a man who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars	3213	" said Arthur , "
132821	132822	132823	132827	The long - legged one	3215	" "
132847	132848	132851	132852	the Poysers	167	" "
132864	132869	132854	132854	Mother	185	" said Miss Irwine . "
132883	132884	132881	132881	her	228	" "
132891	132905	132888	132888	I	0	" said the old lady , giving a gracious bow to Mrs. Poyser . "
132948	132949	132941	132946	that pretty girl with dark eyes	3218	" "
132955	132961	132952	132953	Hetty Sorrel	177	" said Miss Lydia Donnithorne , "
133002	133003	132988	132988	she	177	" "
133025	133030	133019	133019	you	544	" said Miss Irwine . "
133049	133060	133045	133045	she	177	" said Mrs. Irwine , continuing to look at Hetty . "
133141	133285	133288	133288	Mother	185	" Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was speaking of her . He feigned not to hear , and to be occupied with something on the opposite side . But he saw her plainly enough without looking ; saw her in heightened beauty , because he heard her beauty praised - for other men 's opinion , you know , was like a native climate to Arthur 's feelings : it was the air on which they thrived the best , and grew strong . Yes ! She was enough to turn any man 's head : any man in his place would have done and felt the same . And to give her up after all , as he was determined to do , would be an act that he should always look back upon with pride . "
133290	133301	133288	133288	Mother	185	" and Mr. Irwine , replying to her last words ; "
133388	133389	133384	133384	he	5903	" "
133406	133407	133384	133384	he	5903	" "
133544	133545	133536	133538	the coarsest fellow	3242	" "
133566	133571	133563	133563	I	0	" said Mr. Gawaine . "
133591	133593	133572	133572	She	3240	" The "
133597	133814	133563	133563	I	0	" was our old acquaintance Bessy Cranage , otherwise Chad 's Bess , whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had undergone an exaggeration of colour , which , if she had happened to be a heavenly body , would have made her sublime . Bessy , I am sorry to say , had taken to her ear - rings again since Dinah 's departure , and was otherwise decked out in such small finery as she could muster . Any one who could have looked into poor Bessy 's heart would have seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and Hetty 's . The advantage , perhaps , would have been on Bessy 's side in the matter of feeling . But then , you see , they were so very different outside ! You would have been inclined to box Bessy 's ears , and you would have longed to kiss Hetty . Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race , partly from mere hedonish gaiety , partly because of the prize . Some one had said there were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes , and she approached the marquee , fanning herself with her handkerchief , but with exultation sparkling in her round eyes . "
133826	133854	133572	133572	She	3240	" said Miss Lydia , taking a large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to Mrs. Irwine before Bessy came up , "
133865	133866	133867	133867	You	3245	" "
133884	133888	133882	133882	Aunt	3247	" said Arthur . "
133913	133914	133907	133911	one of the older women	3249	" "
133926	133936	133915	133915	I	0	" said Miss Lydia , adjusting her own lace ; "
133970	134004	133964	133968	the old woman who wins	3252	" This speech of Miss Lydia 's produced rather a mocking expression in Mrs. Irwine 's face as she looked at Arthur , while Bessy came up and dropped a series of curtsies . "
134012	134019	134010	134010	mother	544	" said Mr. Irwine , kindly , "
134033	134034	134030	134031	the blacksmith	631	" "
134041	134046	134030	134031	the blacksmith	631	" said Mrs. Irwine . "
134077	134141	134065	134065	you	163	" Bessy 's lip fell as she saw the ugly , heavy gown - which felt so hot and disagreeable too , on this July day , and was such a great ugly thing to carry . She dropped her curtsies again , without looking up , and with a growing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth , and then turned away . "
134145	134149	134142	134143	Poor girl	3258	" said Arthur ; "
134167	134168	134169	134169	She	3258	" "
134178	134183	134171	134176	a bold - looking young person	3259	" observed Miss Lydia . "
134194	134307	134169	134169	She	3258	" Arthur silently resolved that he would make Bessy a present of money before the day was over , that she might buy something more to her mind ; but she , not aware of the consolation in store for her , turned out of the open space , where she was visible from the marquee , and throwing down the odious bundle under a tree , began to cry - very much tittered at the while by the small boys . In this situation she was descried by her discreet matronly cousin , who lost no time in coming up , having just given the baby into her husband 's charge . "
134316	134330	134314	134314	ye	3260	" said Bess the matron , taking up the bundle and examining it . "
134414	134415	134407	134407	I	0	" "
134427	134448	134424	134424	I	0	" said Bess the maiden , with a pettish movement , beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself . "
134466	134979	134459	134459	ye	3260	" said the disinterested cousin , walking quickly away with the bundle , lest Chad 's Bess should change her mind . But that bonny - cheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits that secured her from any rankling grief ; and by the time the grand climax of the donkey - race came on , her disappointment was entirely lost in the delightful excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey by hisses , while the boys applied the argument of sticks . But the strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the arguments urged , which , well considered , requires as great a mental force as the direct sequence ; and the present donkey proved the first - rate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill just when the blows were thickest . Great was the shouting of the crowd , radiant the grinning of Bill Downes the stone - sawyer and the fortunate rider of this superior beast , which stood calm and stiff - legged in the midst of its triumph . Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men , and Bill was made happy with a splendid pocket - knife , supplied with blades and gimlets enough to make a man at home on a desert island . He had hardly returned from the marquee with the prize in his hand , when it began to be understood that Wiry Ben proposed to amuse the company , before the gentry went to dinner , with an impromptu and gratuitous performance - namely , a hornpipe , the main idea of which was doubtless borrowed ; but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and complex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality . Wiry Ben 's pride in his dancing - an accomplishment productive of great effect at the yearly Wake - had needed only slightly elevating by an extra quantity of good ale to convince him that the gentry would be very much struck with his performance of his hornpipe ; and he had been decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann , who observed that it was nothing but right to do something to please the young squire , in return for what he had done for them . You will be the less surprised at this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had requested Mr. Rann to accompany him on the fiddle , and Joshua felt quite sure that though there might not be much in the dancing , the music would make up for it . Adam Bede , who was present in one of the large marquees , where the plan was being discussed , told Ben he had better not make a fool of himself - a remark which at once fixed Ben 's determination : he was not going to let anything alone because Adam Bede turned up his nose at it . "
134988	134994	134459	134459	ye	3260	" said old Mr. Donnithorne . "

135030	135034	135006	135007	the clerk	3266	" said Arthur ; "

135079	135084	135077	135077	him	131	" said Mr. Irwine ; "
135129	135151	135116	135116	me	0	" Miss Anne rose assentingly , and the good brother took her away , while Joshua 's preliminary scrapings burst into the "
135155	135278	135116	135116	me	0	" from which he intended to pass to a variety of tunes , by a series of transitions which his good ear really taught him to execute with some skill . It would have been an exasperating fact to him , if he had known it , that the general attention was too thoroughly absorbed by Ben 's dancing for any one to give much heed to the music . Have you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance ? Perhaps you have only seen a ballet rustic , smiling like a merry countryman in crockery , with graceful turns of the haunch and insinuating movements of the head . That is as much like the real thing as the "
135281	135355	135116	135116	me	0	" is like the song of birds . Wiry Ben never smiled : he looked as serious as a dancing monkey - as serious as if he had been an experimental philosopher ascertaining in his own person the amount of shaking and the varieties of angularity that could be given to the human limbs . To make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped marquee , Arthur clapped his hands continually and cried "
135358	135396	135116	135116	me	0	" But Ben had one admirer whose eyes followed his movements with a fervid gravity that equalled his own . It was Martin Poyser , who was seated on a bench , with Tommy between his legs . "
135404	135411	135412	135412	He	3272	" he said to his wife . "

135617	136349	135611	135611	he	3272	" Chapter XXVI The Dance ARTHUR had chosen the entrance - hall for the ballroom : very wisely , for no other room could have been so airy , or would have had the advantage of the wide doors opening into the garden , as well as a ready entrance into the other rooms . To be sure , a stone floor was not the pleasantest to dance on , but then , most of the dancers had known what it was to enjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen quarries . It was one of those entrance - halls which make the surrounding rooms look like closets - with stucco angels , trumpets , and flower - wreaths on the lofty ceiling , and great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls , alternating with statues in niches . Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with green boughs , and Mr. Craig had been proud to show his taste and his hothouse plants on the occasion . The broad steps of the stone staircase were covered with cushions to serve as seats for the children , who were to stay till half - past nine with the servant - maids to see the dancing , and as this dance was confined to the chief tenants , there was abundant room for every one . The lights were charmingly disposed in coloured - paper lamps , high up among green boughs , and the farmers ' wives and daughters , as they peeped in , believed no scene could be more splendid ; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and queen lived , and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins and acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how things went on in the great world . The lamps were already lit , though the sun had not long set , and there was that calm light out of doors in which we seem to see all objects more distinctly than in the broad day . It was a pretty scene outside the house : the farmers and their families were moving about the lawn , among the flowers and shrubs , or along the broad straight road leading from the east front , where a carpet of mossy grass spread on each side , studded here and there with a dark flat - boughed cedar , or a grand pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with its branches , all tipped with a fringe of paler green . The groups of cottagers in the park were gradually diminishing , the young ones being attracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from the windows of the gallery in the abbey , which was to be their dancing - room , and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go home quietly . One of these was Lisbeth Bede , and Seth went with her - not from filial attention only , for his conscience would not let him join in dancing . It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth : Dinah had never been more constantly present with him than in this scene , where everything was so unlike her . He saw her all the more vividly after looking at the thoughtless faces and gay - coloured dresses of the young women - just as one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured Madonna the more when it has been for a moment screened from us by a vulgar head in a bonnet . But this presence of Dinah in his mind only helped him to bear the better with his mother 's mood , which had been becoming more and more querulous for the last hour . Poor Lisbeth was suffering from a strange conflict of feelings . Her joy and pride in the honour paid to her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the conflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam came to tell her that Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the dancers in the hall . Adam was getting more and more out of her reach ; she wished all the old troubles back again , for then it mattered more to Adam what his mother said and did . "
136362	136366	135611	135611	he	3272	" she said , "
136404	136405	136418	136418	Mother	185	" "
136420	136436	136418	136418	Mother	185	" said Adam , who was determined to be gentle to her to - day . "
136495	136496	136483	136483	thee	3285	" "
136539	136540	136518	136518	She	1451	" "
136545	136549	136543	136543	Mother	185	" said Adam , "
136594	136613	136590	136590	I	0	" He said this with some effort , for he really longed to be near Hetty this evening . "
136701	136702	136683	136683	she	5612	" "
136726	136808	136720	136720	Gyp	142	" said Adam , turning away towards the gate of the pleasure - grounds , where he hoped he might be able to join the Poysers , for he had been so occupied throughout the afternoon that he had had no time to speak to Hetty . His eye soon detected a distant group , which he knew to be the right one , returning to the house along the broad gravel road , and he hastened on to meet them . "
136824	136837	136811	136811	Adam	127	" said Mr. Poyser , who was carrying Totty on his arm . "
136897	136898	136893	136893	she	177	" "
136912	136929	136901	136901	I	0	" said Adam , already tempted to change his mind , as he looked at Hetty . "
136932	136937	136901	136901	I	0	" said Mr. Poyser . "
137046	137047	137022	137022	You	3303	" "
137052	137057	137022	137022	You	3303	" said Mrs. Poyser , "
137116	137117	137102	137102	you	3303	" "
137127	137143	137120	137122	Hetty ' ull	177	" said Adam , yielding either to Mrs. Poyser 's argument or to something else , "
137153	137154	137144	137144	I	0	" "
137165	137169	137155	137155	I	0	" said Hetty ; "
137181	137182	137170	137170	I	0	" "
137185	137190	137170	137170	I	0	" said Mr. Poyser , "
137241	137302	137239	137239	'em	3310	" Adam felt the justice of Mr. Poyser 's observation : it would not do for him to dance with no one besides Hetty ; and remembering that Jonathan Burge had some reason to feel hurt to - day , he resolved to ask Miss Mary to dance with him the first dance , if she had no other partner . "
137312	137317	137239	137239	'em	3310	" said Mr. Poyser ; "
137345	137607	137608	137608	I	0	" When they had entered the hall , and the three children under Molly 's charge had been seated on the stairs , the folding - doors of the drawing - room were thrown open , and Arthur entered in his regimentals , leading Mrs. Irwine to a carpet - covered dais ornamented with hot - house plants , where she and Miss Anne were to be seated with old Mr. Donnithorne , that they might look on at the dancing , like the kings and queens in the plays . Arthur had put on his uniform to please the tenants , he said , who thought as much of his militia dignity as if it had been an elevation to the premiership . He had not the least objection to gratify them in that way : his uniform was very advantageous to his figure . The old squire , before sitting down , walked round the hall to greet the tenants and make polite speeches to the wives : he was always polite ; but the farmers had found out , after long puzzling , that this polish was one of the signs of hardness . It was observed that he gave his most elaborate civility to Mrs. Poyser to - night , inquiring particularly about her health , recommending her to strengthen herself with cold water as he did , and avoid all drugs . Mrs. Poyser curtsied and thanked him with great self - command , but when he had passed on , she whispered to her husband , "
137633	137650	137623	137624	Old Harry	358	" Mr. Poyser had no time to answer , for now Arthur came up and said , "
137692	138565	137685	137685	she	701	" The wife 's pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted honour as Arthur led her to the top of the room ; but Mr. Poyser , to whom an extra glass had restored his youthful confidence in his good looks and good dancing , walked along with them quite proudly , secretly flattering himself that Miss Lydia had never had a partner in HER life who could lift her off the ground as he would . In order to balance the honours given to the two parishes , Miss Irwine danced with Luke Britton , the largest Broxton farmer , and Mr. Gawaine led out Mrs. Britton . Mr. Irwine , after seating his sister Anne , had gone to the abbey gallery , as he had agreed with Arthur beforehand , to see how the merriment of the cottagers was prospering . Meanwhile , all the less distinguished couples had taken their places : Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr. Craig , and Mary Burge by Adam ; and now the music struck up , and the glorious country - dance , best of all dances , began . Pity it was not a boarded floor ! Then the rhythmic stamping of the thick shoes would have been better than any drums . That merry stamping , that gracious nodding of the head , that waving bestowal of the hand - where can we see them now ? That simple dancing of well - covered matrons , laying aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy , remembering but not affecting youth , not jealous but proud of the young maidens by their side - that holiday sprightliness of portly husbands paying little compliments to their wives , as if their courting days were come again - those lads and lasses a little confused and awkward with their partners , having nothing to say - it would be a pleasant variety to see all that sometimes , instead of low dresses and large skirts , and scanning glances exploring costumes , and languid men in lacquered boots smiling with double meaning . There was but one thing to mar Martin Poyser 's pleasure in this dance : it was that he was always in close contact with Luke Britton , that slovenly farmer . He thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into his eye in the crossing of hands ; but then , as Miss Irwine was opposite to him instead of the offensive Luke , he might freeze the wrong person . So he gave his face up to hilarity , unchilled by moral judgments . How Hetty 's heart beat as Arthur approached her ! He had hardly looked at her to - day : now he must take her hand . Would he press it ? Would he look at her ? She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of feeling . Now he was there - he had taken her hand - yes , he was pressing it . Hetty turned pale as she looked up at him for an instant and met his eyes , before the dance carried him away . That pale look came upon Arthur like the beginning of a dull pain , which clung to him , though he must dance and smile and joke all the same . Hetty would look so , when he told her what he had to tell her ; and he should never be able to bear it - he should be a fool and give way again . Hetty 's look did not really mean so much as he thought : it was only the sign of a struggle between the desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should betray the desire to others . But Hetty 's face had a language that transcended her feelings . There are faces which nature charges with a meaning and pathos not belonging to the single human soul that flutters beneath them , but speaking the joys and sorrows of foregone generations - eyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been and is somewhere , but not paired with these eyes - perhaps paired with pale eyes that can say nothing ; just as a national language may be instinct with poetry unfelt by the lips that use it . That look of Hetty 's oppressed Arthur with a dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed delight in it , that she loved him too well . There was a hard task before him , for at that moment he felt he would have given up three years of his youth for the happiness of abandoning himself without remorse to his passion for Hetty . These were the incongruous thoughts in his mind as he led Mrs. Poyser , who was panting with fatigue , and secretly resolving that neither judge nor jury should force her to dance another dance , to take a quiet rest in the dining - room , where supper was laid out for the guests to come and take it as they chose . "
138584	138591	138573	138573	she	177	" said the good innocent woman ; "
138623	138624	138614	138614	I	0	" "
138631	138640	138626	138626	you	0	" said Arthur , not without a twinge . "
138664	138849	138653	138653	Mills	368	" He hurried away to seek another matronly partner , for due honour must be paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones ; and the country - dances , and the stamping , and the gracious nodding , and the waving of the hands , went on joyously . At last the time had come for the fourth dance - longed for by the strong , grave Adam , as if he had been a delicate - handed youth of eighteen ; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love ; and Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty 's hand for more than a transient greeting - had never danced with her but once before . His eyes had followed her eagerly to - night in spite of himself , and had taken in deeper draughts of love . He thought she behaved so prettily , so quietly ; she did not seem to be flirting at all she smiled less than usual ; there was almost a sweet sadness about her . "
138854	138859	138852	138852	her	3320	" he said inwardly ; "
138890	139050	139052	139052	me	0	" And then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from work , and drawing Hetty to his side , and feeling her cheek softly pressed against his , till he forgot where he was , and the music and the tread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of the wind , for what he knew . But now the third dance was ended , and he might go up to her and claim her hand . She was at the far end of the hall near the staircase , whispering with Molly , who had just given the sleeping Totty into her arms before running to fetch shawls and bonnets from the landing . Mrs. Poyser had taken the two boys away into the dining - room to give them some cake before they went home in the cart with Grandfather and Molly was to follow as fast as possible . "
139056	139065	139052	139052	me	0	" said Adam , as Molly turned upstairs ; "
139076	139220	139066	139067	the children	5515	" Hetty was glad of the relief , for to hold Totty in her arms , standing , was not at all a pleasant variety to her . But this second transfer had the unfortunate effect of rousing Totty , who was not behind any child of her age in peevishness at an unseasonable awaking . While Hetty was in the act of placing her in Adam 's arms , and had not yet withdrawn her own , Totty opened her eyes , and forthwith fought out with her left fist at Adam 's arm , and with her right caught at the string of brown beads round Hetty 's neck . The locket leaped out from her frock , and the next moment the string was broken , and Hetty , helpless , saw beads and locket scattered wide on the floor . "
139227	139239	139066	139067	the children	5515	" she said , in a loud frightened whisper to Adam ; "
139245	139339	139066	139067	the children	5515	" Adam had already seen where the locket fell , for it had attracted his glance as it leaped out of her frock . It had fallen on the raised wooden dais where the band sat , not on the stone floor ; and as Adam picked it up , he saw the glass with the dark and light locks of hair under it . It had fallen that side upwards , so the glass was not broken . He turned it over on his hand , and saw the enamelled gold back . "
139345	139371	139066	139067	the children	5515	" he said , as he held it towards Hetty , who was unable to take it because both her hands were occupied with Totty . "
139386	139399	139379	139379	I	0	" said Hetty , who had been pale and was now red . "
139403	139409	139410	139410	You	0	" said Adam , gravely . "
139429	139524	139417	139417	I	0	" he added , quietly closing his hand over it , that she might not think he wanted to look at it again . By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl , and as soon as she had taken Totty , Adam placed the locket in Hetty 's hand . She took it with an air of indifference and put it in her pocket , in her heart vexed and angry with Adam because he had seen it , but determined now that she would show no more signs of agitation . "
139527	139531	139532	139532	they	3324	" she said , "
139544	140353	140354	140354	I	0	" Adam assented silently . A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him . Had Hetty a lover he did n't know of ? For none of her relations , he was sure , would give her a locket like that ; and none of her admirers , with whom he was acquainted , was in the position of an accepted lover , as the giver of that locket must be . Adam was lost in the utter impossibility of finding any person for his fears to alight on . He could only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in Hetty 's life unknown to him ; that while he had been rocking himself in the hope that she would come to love him , she was already loving another . The pleasure of the dance with Hetty was gone ; his eyes , when they rested on her , had an uneasy questioning expression in them ; he could think of nothing to say to her ; and she too was out of temper and disinclined to speak . They were both glad when the dance was ended . Adam was determined to stay no longer ; no one wanted him , and no one would notice if he slipped away . As soon as he got out of doors , he began to walk at his habitual rapid pace , hurrying along without knowing why , busy with the painful thought that the memory of this day , so full of honour and promise to him , was poisoned for ever . Suddenly , when he was far on through the Chase , he stopped , startled by a flash of reviving hope . After all , he might be a fool , making a great misery out of a trifle . Hetty , fond of finery as she was , might have bought the thing herself . It looked too expensive for that - it looked like the things on white satin in the great jeweller 's shop at Rosseter . But Adam had very imperfect notions of the value of such things , and he thought it could certainly not cost more than a guinea . Perhaps Hetty had had as much as that in Christmas boxes , and there was no knowing but she might have been childish enough to spend it in that way ; she was such a young thing , and she could n't help loving finery ! But then , why had she been so frightened about it at first , and changed colour so , and afterwards pretended not to care ? Oh , that was because she was ashamed of his seeing that she had such a smart thing - she was conscious that it was wrong for her to spend her money on it , and she knew that Adam disapproved of finery . It was a proof she cared about what he liked and disliked . She must have thought from his silence and gravity afterwards that he was very much displeased with her , that he was inclined to be harsh and severe towards her foibles . And as he walked on more quietly , chewing the cud of this new hope , his only uneasiness was that he had behaved in a way which might chill Hetty 's feeling towards him . For this last view of the matter must be the true one . How could Hetty have an accepted lover , quite unknown to him ? She was never away from her uncle 's house for more than a day ; she could have no acquaintances that did not come there , and no intimacies unknown to her uncle and aunt . It would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her by a lover . The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was her own ; he could form no guess about the light hair under it , for he had not seen it very distinctly . It might be a bit of her father 's or mother 's , who had died when she was a child , and she would naturally put a bit of her own along with it . And so Adam went to bed comforted , having woven for himself an ingenious web of probabilities - the surest screen a wise man can place between himself and the truth . His last waking thoughts melted into a dream that he was with Hetty again at the Hall Farm , and that he was asking her to forgive him for being so cold and silent . And while he was dreaming this , Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance and saying to her in low hurried tones , "
140376	140589	140354	140354	I	0	" And Hetty 's foolish joys and hopes , which had flown away for a little space , scared by a mere nothing , now all came fluttering back , unconscious of the real peril . She was happy for the first time this long day , and wished that dance would last for hours . Arthur wished it too ; it was the last weakness he meant to indulge in ; and a man never lies with more delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has persuaded himself that he shall subdue it to - morrow . But Mrs. Poyser 's wishes were quite the reverse of this , for her mind was filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of to - morrow morning 's cheese in consequence of these late hours . Now that Hetty had done her duty and danced one dance with the young squire , Mr. Poyser must go out and see if the cart was come back to fetch them , for it was half - past ten o'clock , and notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his part that it would be bad manners for them to be the first to go , Mrs. Poyser was resolute on the point , "

140605	140620	140602	140603	Mrs. Poyser	228	" said old Mr. Donnithorne , as she came to curtsy and take leave ; "

140867	140889	140811	140811	i	0	" said Mr. Poyser , who was in his merriest mood , and felt that he had had a great day , "
141024	141711	141008	141008	you	228	" Book Four Chapter XXVII A crisis IT was beyond the middle of August - nearly three weeks after the birthday feast . The reaping of the wheat had begun in our north midland county of Loamshire , but the harvest was likely still to be retarded by the heavy rains , which were causing inundations and much damage throughout the country . From this last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope farmers , on their pleasant uplands and in their brook - watered valleys , had not suffered , and as I can not pretend that they were such exceptional farmers as to love the general good better than their own , you will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the rapid rise in the price of bread , so long as there was hope of gathering in their own corn undamaged ; and occasional days of sunshine and drying winds flattered this hope . The eighteenth of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before . Grand masses of cloud were hurried across the blue , and the great round hills behind the Chase seemed alive with their flying shadows ; the sun was hidden for a moment , and then shone out warm again like a recovered joy ; the leaves , still green , were tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind ; around the farmhouses there was a sound of clapping doors ; the apples fell in the orchards ; and the stray horses on the green sides of the lanes and on the common had their manes blown about their faces . And yet the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun was shining . A merry day for the children , who ran and shouted to see if they could top the wind with their voices ; and the grown - up people too were in good spirits , inclined to believe in yet finer days , when the wind had fallen . If only the corn were not ripe enough to be blown out of the husk and scattered as untimely seed ! And yet a day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man . For if it be true that Nature at certain moments seems charged with a presentiment of one individual lot must it not also be true that she seems unmindful unconscious of another ? For there is no hour that has not its births of gladness and despair , no morning brightness that does not bring new sickness to desolation as well as new forces to genius and love . There are so many of us , and our lots are so different , what wonder that Nature 's mood is often in harsh contrast with the great crisis of our lives ? We are children of a large family , and must learn , as such children do , not to expect that our hurts will be made much of - to be content with little nurture and caressing , and help each other the more . It was a busy day with Adam , who of late had done almost double work , for he was continuing to act as foreman for Jonathan Burge , until some satisfactory person could be found to supply his place , and Jonathan was slow to find that person . But he had done the extra work cheerfully , for his hopes were buoyant again about Hetty . Every time she had seen him since the birthday , she had seemed to make an effort to behave all the more kindly to him , that she might make him understand she had forgiven his silence and coldness during the dance . He had never mentioned the locket to her again ; too happy that she smiled at him - still happier because he observed in her a more subdued air , something that he interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness and seriousness . "
141714	141767	141008	141008	you	228	" he thought , again and again , ' she 's only seventeen ; she 'll be thoughtful enough after a while . And her aunt allays says how clever she is at the work . She 'll make a wife as Mother'll have no occasion to grumble at , after all . "
141830	141850	141851	141852	Mrs. Poyser	228	" She 's takin ' too much likin ' to them folks i ' the house keeper 's room , "
141855	141895	141851	141852	Mrs. Poyser	228	" For my part , I was never overfond o ' gentlefolks 's servants - they 're mostly like the fine ladies ' fat dogs , nayther good for barking nor butcher 's meat , but on'y for show . "
142021	142030	142031	142031	she	177	" Oh , do come in with me ! "

143950	143955	143957	143957	Arthur	211	" Well , Adam , "
143959	144077	143957	143957	Arthur	211	" you 've been looking at the fine old beeches , eh ? They 're not to be come near by the hatchet , though ; this is a sacred grove . I overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as I was coming to my den - the Hermitage , there . She ought not to come home this way so late . So I took care of her to the gate , and asked for a kiss for my pains . But I must get back now , for this road is confoundedly damp . Good - night , Adam . I shall see you to - morrow - to say good - bye , you know . "
144163	144170	144172	144172	Adam	127	" Stop a bit , sir , "
144184	144195	144196	144196	Arthur	211	" I 've got a word to say to you . "
144376	144384	144373	144373	he	211	" What do you mean , Adam ? "
144385	144390	144393	144393	Adam	127	" I mean , sir "
144406	144450	144393	144393	Adam	127	" I mean , sir , that you do n't deceive me by your light words . This is not the first time you 've met Hetty Sorrel in this grove , and this is not the first time you 've kissed her . "
144497	144505	144488	144488	He	211	" Well , sir , what then ? "
144506	144627	144488	144488	He	211	" Why , then , instead of acting like th ' upright , honourable man we 've all believed you to be , you 've been acting the part of a selfish light - minded scoundrel . You know as well as I do what it 's to lead to when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young woman like Hetty , and gives her presents as she 's frightened for other folks to see . And I say it again , you 're acting the part of a selfish light - minded scoundrel though it cuts me to th ' heart to say so , and I 'd rather ha ' lost my right hand . "
144628	144636	144638	144638	Arthur	211	" Let me tell you , Adam , "
144653	144743	144638	144638	Arthur	211	" you 're not only devilishly impertinent , but you 're talking nonsense . Every pretty girl is not such a fool as you , to suppose that when a gentleman admires her beauty and pays her a little attention , he must mean something particular . Every man likes to flirt with a pretty girl , and every pretty girl likes to be flirted with . The wider the distance between them , the less harm there is , for then she 's not likely to deceive herself . "
144744	144755	144757	144757	Adam	127	" I do n't know what you mean by flirting , "
144759	144938	144757	144757	Adam	127	" but if you mean behaving to a woman as if you loved her , and yet not loving her all the while , I say that 's not th ' action of an honest man , and what is n't honest does come t ' harm . I 'm not a fool , and you 're not a fool , and you know better than what you 're saying . You know it could n't be made public as you 've behaved to Hetty as y ' have done without her losing her character and bringing shame and trouble on her and her relations . What if you meant nothing by your kissing and your presents ? Other folks wo n't believe as you 've meant nothing ; and do n't tell me about her not deceiving herself . I tell you as you 've filled her mind so with the thought of you as it 'll mayhap poison her life , and she 'll never love another man as ' ud make her a good husband . "
145009	145014	145015	145015	he	211	" Well , Adam , "
145025	145139	145015	145015	he	211	" you 're perhaps right . Perhaps I 've gone a little too far in taking notice of the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then . You 're such a grave , steady fellow , you do n't understand the temptation to such trifling . I 'm sure I would n't bring any trouble or annoyance on her and the good Poysers on any account if I could help it . But I think you look a little too seriously at it . You know I 'm going away immediately , so I sha n't make any more mistakes of the kind . But let us say good - night "
145149	145166	145141	145141	Arthur	211	" and talk no more about the matter . The whole thing will soon be forgotten . "
145167	145173	145174	145174	Adam	127	" No , by God ! "
145374	145570	145571	145572	Poor Adam	127	" No , it 'll not be soon forgot , as you 've come in between her and me , when she might ha ' loved me - it 'll not soon be forgot as you 've robbed me o ' my happiness , while I thought you was my best friend , and a noble - minded man , as I was proud to work for . And you 've been kissing her , and meaning nothing , have you ? And I never kissed her i ' my life - but I 'd ha ' worked hard for years for the right to kiss her . And you make light of it . You think little o ' doing what may damage other folks , so as you get your bit o ' trifling , as means nothing . I throw back your favours , for you 're not the man I took you for . I 'll never count you my friend any more . I 'd rather you 'd act as my enemy , and fight me where I stand - it 's all th ' amends you can make me . "
145829	145832	145833	145833	he	127	" What ! "
145836	145858	145833	145833	he	127	" wo n't you fight me like a man ? You know I wo n't strike you while you stand so . "
145859	145865	145867	145867	Arthur	211	" Go away , Adam , "
145869	145878	145867	145867	Arthur	211	" I do n't want to fight you . "
145879	145882	145884	145884	Adam	127	" No , "
145888	145914	145884	145884	Adam	127	" you do n't want to fight me - you think I 'm a common man , as you can injure without answering for it . "
145915	145923	145925	145925	Arthur	211	" I never meant to injure you , "
145931	145940	145925	145925	Arthur	211	" I did n't know you loved her . "
145941	145950	145952	145952	Adam	127	" But you 've made her love you , "
145954	145973	145952	145952	Adam	127	" You 're a double - faced man - I 'll never believe a word you say again . "
145974	145982	145984	145984	Arthur	211	" Go away , I tell you , "
145988	145995	145984	145984	Arthur	211	" or we shall both repent . "
145996	145999	146001	146001	Adam	127	" No , "
146008	146043	146001	146001	Adam	127	" I swear I wo n't go away without fighting you . Do you want provoking any more ? I tell you you 're a coward and a scoundrel , and I despise you . "
146514	146523	146524	146524	he	211	" Do you feel any pain , sir ? "
146570	146579	146580	146580	Adam	127	" Do you feel any hurt , sir ? "
146614	146620	146621	146621	he	127	" Lay my head down , "
146626	146636	146621	146621	he	127	" and get me some water if you can . "
146707	146721	146723	146723	Adam	127	" Can you drink a drop out o ' your hand , sir ? "
146735	146738	146740	146740	Arthur	211	" No , "
146742	146754	146740	146740	Arthur	211	" dip my cravat in and souse it on my head . "
146779	146788	146789	146789	Adam	127	" Do you feel any hurt inside sir ? "
146792	146798	146800	146800	Arthur	211	" No - no hurt , "
146805	146811	146800	146800	Arthur	211	" but rather done up . "
146818	146830	146815	146815	he	211	" I suppose I fainted away when you knocked me down . "
146831	146839	146841	146841	Adam	127	" Yes , sir , thank God , "
146843	146850	146841	146841	Adam	127	" I thought it was worse . "
146851	146871	146800	146800	Arthur	211	" What ! You thought you 'd done for me , eh ? Come help me on my legs . "
146872	146880	146881	146881	Arthur	211	" I feel terribly shaky and dizzy , "
146893	146918	146881	146881	Arthur	211	" that blow of yours must have come against me like a battering - ram . I do n't believe I can walk alone . "
146919	146932	146934	146934	Adam	127	" Lean on me , sir ; I 'll get you along , "
146936	146971	146934	146934	Adam	127	" Or , will you sit down a bit longer , on my coat here , and I 'll prop y ' up . You 'll perhaps be better in a minute or two . "
146972	146975	146977	146977	Arthur	211	" No , "
146979	147020	146977	146977	Arthur	211	" I 'll go to the Hermitage - I think I 've got some brandy there . There 's a short road to it a little farther on , near the gate . If you 'll just help me on . "
147209	147219	147220	147220	he	211	" You 'll see my hunting - bottle somewhere , "
147223	147234	147220	147220	he	211	" A leather case with a bottle and glass in . "
147244	147255	147256	147256	he	127	" There 's very little brandy in it , sir , "
147274	147280	147256	147256	he	127	" hardly this little glassful . "
147281	147288	147290	147290	Arthur	211	" Well , give me that , "
147309	147357	147306	147306	Adam	127	" Had n't I better run to th ' house , sir , and get some more brandy ? I can be there and back pretty soon . It 'll be a stiff walk home for you , if you do n't have something to revive you . "
147358	147401	147306	147306	Adam	127	" Yes - go . But do n't say I 'm ill . Ask for my man Pym , and tell him to get it from Mills , and not to say I 'm at the Hermitage . Get some water too . "
147643	147648	147649	147649	Arthur	211	" That 's right , "
147652	147664	147649	147649	Arthur	211	" I 'm tremendously in want of some brandy - vigour . "
147665	147679	147681	147681	Adam	127	" I 'm glad to see you 've got a light , sir , "
147683	147697	147681	147681	Adam	127	" I 've been thinking I 'd better have asked for a lanthorn . "
147698	147720	147649	147649	Arthur	211	" No , no ; the candle will last long enough - I shall soon be up to walking home now . "
147721	147736	147738	147738	Adam	127	" I ca n't go before I 've seen you safe home , sir , "
147742	147757	147738	147738	Adam	127	" No : it will be better for you to stay - sit down . "
148073	148084	148085	148085	he	211	" You begin to feel more yourself again , sir , "
148107	148139	148085	148085	he	211	" Yes : I do n't feel good for much - very lazy , and not inclined to move ; but I 'll go home when I 've taken this dose . "
148149	148208	148209	148209	He	127	" My temper got the better of me , and I said things as was n't true . I 'd no right to speak as if you 'd known you was doing me an injury : you 'd no grounds for knowing it ; I 've always kept what I felt for her as secret as I could . "
148217	148296	148213	148213	he	127	" And perhaps I judged you too harsh - I 'm apt to be harsh - and you may have acted out o ' thoughtlessness more than I should ha ' believed was possible for a man with a heart and a conscience . We 're not all put together alike , and we may misjudge one another . God knows , it 's all the joy I could have now , to think the best of you . "
148516	148526	148527	148527	he	127	" Say no more about our anger , Adam , "
148546	148622	148527	148527	he	127	" I forgive your momentary injustice - it was quite natural , with the exaggerated notions you had in your mind . We shall be none the worse friends in future , I hope , because we 've fought . You had the best of it , and that was as it should be , for I believe I 've been most in the wrong of the two . Come , let us shake hands . "
148634	148649	148650	148650	he	127	" I do n't like to say ' No ' to that , sir , "
148653	148730	148650	148650	he	127	" but I ca n't shake hands till it 's clear what we mean by't . I was wrong when I spoke as if you 'd done me an injury knowingly , but I was n't wrong in what I said before , about your behaviour t ' Hetty , and I ca n't shake hands with you as if I held you my friend the same as ever till you 've cleared that up better . "
148761	148842	148758	148758	he	211	" I do n't know what you mean by clearing up , Adam . I 've told you already that you think too seriously of a little flirtation . But if you are right in supposing there is any danger in it - I 'm going away on Saturday , and there will be an end of it . As for the pain it has given you , I 'm heartily sorry for it . I can say no more . "
148939	148950	148951	148951	he	211	" It 'll be better for me to speak plain , "
148958	149157	148951	148951	he	211	" though it 's hard work . You see , sir , this is n't a trifle to me , whatever it may be to you . I 'm none o ' them men as can go making love first to one woman and then t ' another , and do n't think it much odds which of 'em I take . What I feel for Hetty 's a different sort o ' love , such as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and God as has given it to 'em . She 's more nor everything else to me , all but my conscience and my good name . And if it 's true what you 've been saying all along - and if it 's only been trifling and flirting as you call it , as 'll be put an end to by your going away - why , then , I 'd wait , and hope her heart ' ud turn to me after all . I 'm loath to think you 'd speak false to me , and I 'll believe your word , however things may look . "
149158	149172	149174	149174	Arthur	211	" You would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it , "
149203	149221	149189	149189	he	211	" You seem to forget that , in suspecting me , you are casting imputations upon her . "
149222	149227	149228	149228	Adam	127	" Nay , sir , "
149262	149389	149238	149238	he	127	" Nay , sir , things do n't lie level between Hetty and you . You 're acting with your eyes open , whatever you may do ; but how do you know what 's been in her mind ? She 's all but a child - as any man with a conscience in him ought to feel bound to take care on . And whatever you may think , I know you 've disturbed her mind . I know she 's been fixing her heart on you , for there 's a many things clear to me now as I did n't understand before . But you seem to make light o ' what she may feel - you do n't think o ' that . "
149390	149400	149401	149401	Arthur	211	" Good God , Adam , let me alone ! "
149406	149416	149401	149401	Arthur	211	" I feel it enough without your worrying me . "
149432	149442	149443	149443	Adam	127	" Well , then , if you feel it , "
149448	149658	149443	149443	Adam	127	" if you feel as you may ha ' put false notions into her mind , and made her believe as you loved her , when all the while you meant nothing , I 've this demand to make of you - I 'm not speaking for myself , but for her . I ask you t ' undeceive her before you go away . Y'aren't going away for ever , and if you leave her behind with a notion in her head o ' your feeling about her the same as she feels about you , she 'll be hankering after you , and the mischief may get worse . It may be a smart to her now , but it 'll save her pain i ' th ' end . I ask you to write a letter - you may trust to my seeing as she gets it . Tell her the truth , and take blame to yourself for behaving as you 'd no right to do to a young woman as is n't your equal . I speak plain , sir , but I ca n't speak any other way . There 's nobody can take care o ' Hetty in this thing but me . "
149659	149671	149673	149673	Arthur	211	" I can do what I think needful in the matter , "
149685	149701	149673	149673	Arthur	211	" without giving promises to you . I shall take what measures I think proper . "
149702	149705	149707	149707	Adam	127	" No , "
149715	149781	149707	149707	Adam	127	" that wo n't do . I must know what ground I 'm treading on . I must be safe as you 've put an end to what ought never to ha ' been begun . I do n't forget what 's owing to you as a gentleman , but in this thing we 're man and man , and I ca n't give up . "
149794	149814	149791	149791	Arthur	211	" I 'll see you to - morrow . I can bear no more now ; I 'm ill . "
149832	149840	149841	149841	Adam	127	" You wo n't see her again ! "
149864	149891	149892	149892	Adam	127	" Either tell me she can never be my wife - tell me you 've been lying - or else promise me what I 've said . "
149950	149958	149945	149945	he	211	" I promise ; let me go . "
149987	149999	150001	150001	Adam	127	" You 're not well enough to walk alone , sir , "
150003	150009	150001	150001	Adam	127	" Take my arm again . "
150040	150067	150030	150030	he	211	" I believe I must trouble you . It 's getting late now , and there may be an alarm set up about me at home . "
150093	150103	150104	150104	Adam	127	" I must pick up the tools , sir , "
150107	150130	150104	150104	Adam	127	" They 're my brother 's . I doubt they 'll be rusted . If you 'll please to wait a minute . "
150169	150181	150165	150165	He	127	" Thank you ; I need n't trouble you any further . "
150182	150200	150202	150202	Adam	127	" What time will it be conven'ent for me to see you to - morrow , sir ? "
150204	150218	150220	150220	Arthur	211	" You may send me word that you 're here at five o'clock , "
150222	150226	150220	150220	Arthur	211	" not before . "
150227	150234	150236	150236	Adam	127	" Good - night , sir , "
150314	150349	150288	150288	he	211	" And see that my mare is saddled at half - past eight , and tell my grandfather when he 's down that I 'm better this morning and am gone for a ride . "
153209	153224	153226	153228	sour old John	276	" I thought they said th ' young mester war took ill last night , "
153243	153260	153226	153228	sour old John	276	" He 's been ridin ' fit to split the mare i ' two this forenoon . "
153261	153273	153275	153277	the facetious coachman	3524	" That 's happen one o ' the symptims , John , "
153279	153295	153297	153297	John	276	" Then I wish he war let blood for ' t , that 's all , "
153430	153487	153427	153427	Adam	127	" In the enclosed letter I have written everything you wish . I leave it to you to decide whether you will be doing best to deliver it to Hetty or to return it to me . Ask yourself once more whether you are not taking a measure which may pain her more than mere silence . "
153510	153512	153500	153500	We	3527	" A.D. "
153513	153530	153532	153532	Adam	127	" Perhaps he 's i ' th ' right on ' t not to see me , "
153534	153691	153532	153532	Adam	127	" It 's no use meeting to say more hard words , and it 's no use meeting to shake hands and say we 're friends again . We 're not friends , an ' it 's better not to pretend it . I know forgiveness is a man 's duty , but , to my thinking , that can only mean as you 're to give up all thoughts o ' taking revenge : it can never mean as you 're t ' have your old feelings back again , for that 's not possible . He 's not the same man to me , and I ca n't feel the same towards him . God help me ! I do n't know whether I feel the same towards anybody : I seem as if I 'd been measuring my work from a false line , and had got it all to measure over again . "
153882	153894	153895	153896	Mr. Poyser	208	" Come , you 'll go on with us , Adam , "
153940	153976	153937	153937	Adam	127	" Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this evening , if it keeps fine , Hetty ? I 've something partic'lar to talk to you about . "
153980	153984	153985	153985	She	177	" Very well . "
154122	154126	154119	154119	he	127	" to tell . "

154561	154579	154580	154580	She	177	" I shall come again at Christmas , and then we will see what can be done . "
154802	154811	154791	154791	Hetty	177	" I 'll go with her , Aunt . "
154859	154863	154846	154847	the boys	6127	" cob - nut "
154983	154994	154995	154995	he	127	" After what I saw on Thursday night , Hetty , "
154998	155125	154995	154995	he	127	" you wo n't think me making too free in what I 'm going to say . If you was being courted by any man as ' ud make you his wife , and I 'd known you was fond of him and meant to have him , I should have no right to speak a word to you about it ; but when I see you 're being made love to by a gentleman as can never marry you , and doesna think o ' marrying you , I feel bound t ' interfere for you . I ca n't speak about it to them as are i ' the place o ' your parents , for that might bring worse trouble than 's needful . "
155179	155190	155191	155191	he	127	" You 're so young , you know , Hetty , "
155198	155318	155191	155191	he	127	" and y ' have n't seen much o ' what goes on in the world . It 's right for me to do what I can to save you from getting into trouble for want o ' your knowing where you 're being led to . If anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a gentleman and having fine presents from him , they 'd speak light on you , and you 'd lose your character . And besides that , you 'll have to suffer in your feelings , wi ' giving your love to a man as can never marry you , so as he might take care of you all your life . "
155443	155455	155456	155456	she	177	" You 've no right to say as I love him , "
155561	155571	155572	155572	he	127	" I doubt it must be so , Hetty , "
155577	155704	155572	155572	he	127	" for I canna believe you 'd let any man kiss you by yourselves , and give you a gold box with his hair , and go a - walking i ' the Grove to meet him , if you didna love him . I 'm not blaming you , for I know it ' ud begin by little and little , till at last you 'd not be able to throw it off . It 's him I blame for stealing your love i ' that way , when he knew he could never make you the right amends . He 's been trifling with you , and making a plaything of you , and caring nothing about you as a man ought to care . "
155705	155720	155721	155721	Hetty	177	" Yes , he does care for me ; I know better nor you , "
155740	155745	155747	155747	Adam	127	" Nay , Hetty , "
155749	155863	155747	155747	Adam	127	" if he 'd cared for you rightly , he 'd never ha ' behaved so . He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and presents , and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of 'em too . But I know better nor that . I ca n't help thinking as you 've been trusting to his loving you well enough to marry you , for all he 's a gentleman . And that 's why I must speak to you about it , Hetty , for fear you should be deceiving yourself . It 's never entered his head the thought o ' marrying you . "
155864	155876	155878	155878	Hetty	177	" How do you know ? How durst you say so ? "
155940	156070	156071	156071	Hetty	177	" Perhaps you ca n't believe me , Hetty , because you think too well of him - because you think he loves you better than he does . But I 've got a letter i ' my pocket , as he wrote himself for me to give you . I 've not read the letter , but he says he 's told you the truth in it . But before I give you the letter , consider , Hetty , and do n't let it take too much hold on you . It wouldna ha ' been good for you if he 'd wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you : it ' ud ha ' led to no happiness i ' th ' end . "
156132	156222	156122	156122	he	127	" Do n't you bear me ill will , Hetty , because I 'm the means o ' bringing you this pain . God knows I 'd ha ' borne a good deal worse for the sake o ' sparing it you . And think - there 's nobody but me knows about this , and I 'll take care of you as if I was your brother . You 're the same as ever to me , for I do n't believe you 've done any wrong knowingly . "
156292	156305	156307	156307	Adam	127	" You 're in the right not to read it just yet , "
156309	156348	156307	156307	Adam	127	" Read it when you 're by yourself . But stay out a little bit longer , and let us call the children : you look so white and ill , your aunt may take notice of it . "
156446	156451	156453	156453	Adam	127	" Hegh , Totty , "
156455	156477	156453	156453	Adam	127	" come and ride on my shoulder - ever so high - you 'll touch the tops o ' the trees . "
156559	156568	156569	156569	she	883	" Bless your sweet face , my pet , "
156613	156631	156594	156594	She	883	" You go and draw some ale , Hetty ; the gells are both at the cheese . "
156840	156845	156838	156838	he	127	" Good - bye , "
157064	157074	157075	157075	he	127	" Her head was allays likely to be turned , "
157078	157145	157075	157075	he	127	" when a gentleman , with his fine manners , and fine clothes , and his white hands , and that way o ' talking gentlefolks have , came about her , making up to her in a bold way , as a man could n't do that was only her equal ; and it 's much if she 'll ever like a common man now . "
157174	157523	157146	157146	He	127	" I 'm a roughish fellow , altogether ; I do n't know , now I come to think on't , what there is much for a woman to like about me ; and yet I might ha ' got another wife easy enough , if I had n't set my heart on her . But it 's little matter what other women think about me , if she ca n't love me . She might ha ' loved me , perhaps , as likely as any other man - there 's nobody hereabouts as I 'm afraid of , if he had n't come between us ; but now I shall belike be hateful to her because I 'm so different to him . And yet there 's no telling - she may turn round the other way , when she finds he 's made light of her all the while . She may come to feel the vally of a man as ' ud be thankful to be bound to her all his life . But I must put up with it whichever way it is - I 've only to be thankful it 's been no worse . I am not th ' only man that 's got to do without much happiness i ' this life . There 's many a good bit o ' work done with a bad heart . It 's God 's will , and that 's enough for us : we should n't know better how things ought to be than He does , I reckon , if we was to spend our lives i ' puzzling . But it ' ud ha ' gone near to spoil my work for me , if I 'd seen her brought to sorrow and shame , and through the man as I 've always been proud to think on . Since I 've been spared that , I 've no right to grumble . When a man 's got his limbs whole , he can bear a smart cut or two . "
157568	157578	157579	157579	he	127	" I thought thee'dst be at home before me , "
157591	157602	157579	157579	he	127	" for I 'm later than usual to - night . "
157603	157672	157579	157579	he	127	" Well , I 'm later too , for I got into talk , after meeting , with John Barnes , who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection , and I 'd a question to ask him about his experience . It 's one o ' them subjects that lead you further than y ' expect - they do n't lie along the straight road . "
157773	157778	157779	157779	Adam	127	" Seth , lad , "
157791	157803	157779	157779	Adam	127	" hast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away ? "
157804	157807	157809	157809	Seth	128	" Yes , "
157811	157924	157809	157809	Seth	128	" She told me I might write her word after a while , how we went on , and how mother bore up under her trouble . So I wrote to her a fortnight ago , and told her about thee having a new employment , and how Mother was more contented ; and last Wednesday , when I called at the post at Treddles'on , I found a letter from her . I think thee'dst perhaps like to read it , but I didna say anything about it because thee'st seemed so full of other things . It 's quite easy t ' read - she writes wonderful for a woman . "
157948	158000	157938	157938	Adam	127	" Aye , lad , I 've got a tough load to carry just now - thee mustna take it ill if I 'm a bit silenter and crustier nor usual . Trouble doesna make me care the less for thee . I know we shall stick together to the last . "
158001	158031	158047	158047	Adam	127	" I take nought ill o ' thee , Adam . I know well enough what it means if thee't a bit short wi ' me now and then . "
158032	158045	158047	158047	Adam	127	" There 's Mother opening the door to look out for us , "
158055	158079	158047	158047	Adam	127	" She 's been sitting i ' the dark as usual . Well , Gyp , well , art glad to see me ? "
158109	158147	158047	158047	Adam	127	" Eh , my lads ! Th ' hours war ne'er so long sin ' I war born as they'n been this blessed Sunday night . What can ye both ha ' been doin' till this time ? "
158148	158159	158161	158161	Adam	127	" Thee shouldstna sit i ' the dark , Mother , "
158163	158171	158161	158161	Adam	127	" that makes the time seem longer . "
158172	158280	158047	158047	Adam	127	" Eh , what am I to do wi ' burnin ' candle of a Sunday , when there 's on'y me an ' it 's sin to do a bit o ' knittin ' ? The daylight 's long enough for me to stare i ' the booke as I canna read . It ' ud be a fine way o ' shortenin ' the time , to make it waste the good candle . But which on you 's for ha'in ' supper ? Ye mun ayther be clemmed or full , I should think , seein ' what time o ' night it is . "
158281	158288	158290	158290	Seth	128	" I 'm hungry , Mother , "
158309	158316	158318	158318	Adam	127	" I 've had my supper , "
158320	158325	158326	158326	he	127	" Here , Gyp , "
158348	158358	158360	158360	Lisbeth	268	" Thee needstna be gi'in ' th ' dog , "
158362	158393	158360	158360	Lisbeth	268	" I'n fed him well a'ready . I 'm not like to forget him , I reckon , when he 's all o ' thee I can get sight on . "
158394	158401	158403	158403	Adam	127	" Come , then , Gyp , "
158405	158423	158403	158403	Adam	127	" we 'll go to bed . Good - night , Mother ; I 'm very tired . "
158424	158432	158433	158433	Lisbeth	268	" What ails him , dost know ? "
158444	158499	158433	158433	Lisbeth	268	" He 's like as if he was struck for death this day or two - he 's so cast down . I found him i ' the shop this forenoon , arter thee wast gone , a - sittin ' an ' doin' nothin' - not so much as a booke afore him . "
158500	158515	158517	158517	Seth	128	" He 's a deal o ' work upon him just now , Mother , "
158519	158568	158517	158517	Seth	128	" and I think he 's a bit troubled in his mind . Do n't you take notice of it , because it hurts him when you do . Be as kind to him as you can , Mother , and do n't say anything to vex him . "
158569	158610	158611	158611	Adam	127	" Eh , what dost talk o ' my vexin ' him ? An ' what am I like to be but kind ? I 'll ma ' him a kettle - cake for breakfast i ' the mornin ' . "
158822	159217	158793	158793	Joseph	258	" My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be near her in the day of trouble . Speak to her of me , and tell her I often bear her in my thoughts at evening time , when I am sitting in the dim light as I did with her , and we held one another 's hands , and I spoke the words of comfort that were given to me . Ah , that is a blessed time , is n't it , Seth , when the outward light is fading , and the body is a little wearied with its work and its labour . Then the inward light shines the brighter , and we have a deeper sense of resting on the Divine strength . I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes , and it is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for evermore . For then , the very hardship , and the sorrow , and the blindness , and the sin I have beheld and been ready to weep over - yea , all the anguish of the children of men , which sometimes wraps me round like sudden darkness - I can bear with a willing pain , as if I was sharing the Redeemer 's cross . For I feel it , I feel it - infinite love is suffering too - yea , in the fulness of knowledge it suffers , it yearns , it mourns ; and that is a blind self - seeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth . Surely it is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow , while there is sorrow and sin in the world : sorrow is then a part of love , and love does not seek to throw it off . It is not the spirit only that tells me this - I see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel . Is there not pleading in heaven ? Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that crucified body wherewith he ascended ? And is He not one with the Infinite Love itself - as our love is one with our sorrow ? "
159351	159508	159509	159509	I	0	" In my outward lot , which you ask about , I have all things and abound . I have had constant work in the mill , though some of the other hands have been turned off for a time , and my body is greatly strengthened , so that I feel little weariness after long walking and speaking . What you say about staying in your own country with your mother and brother shows me that you have a true guidance ; your lot is appointed there by a clear showing , and to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like laying a false offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven to kindle it . My work and my joy are here among the hills , and I sometimes think I cling too much to my life among the people here , and should be rebellious if I was called away . "
159684	159741	159677	159677	You	3601	" We shall see each other again in the body , I trust , though , it may be , not for a long while ; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are desirous to have me for a short space among them , when I have a door opened me again to leave Snowfield . "
159836	159840	159826	159826	Your	3608	" DINAH MORRIS . "
159841	159898	159899	159899	Adam	127	" I have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen moves slow . And so I am straitened , and say but little of what is in my mind . Greet your mother for me with a kiss . She asked me to kiss her twice when we parted . "
159928	159934	159936	159936	Seth	384	" Hast read the letter ? "
159938	159941	159943	159943	Adam	127	" Yes , "
159945	160040	159943	159943	Adam	127	" I do n't know what I should ha ' thought of her and her letter if I 'd never seen her : I daresay I should ha ' thought a preaching woman hateful . But she 's one as makes everything seem right she says and does , and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I read the letter . It 's wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice . She 'd make thee rare and happy , Seth ; she 's just the woman for thee . "
160041	160051	160053	160053	Seth	384	" It 's no use thinking o ' that , "
160057	160077	160053	160053	Seth	384	" She spoke so firm , and she 's not the woman to say one thing and mean another . "
160078	160150	159943	159943	Adam	127	" Nay , but her feelings may grow different . A woman may get to love by degrees - the best fire dosna flare up the soonest . I 'd have thee go and see her by and by : I 'd make it convenient for thee to be away three or four days , and it ' ud be no walk for thee - only between twenty and thirty mile . "
160151	160174	160176	160176	Seth	384	" I should like to see her again , whether or no , if she wouldna be displeased with me for going , "
160178	160185	160187	160187	Adam	127	" She 'll be none displeased , "
160198	160230	160187	160187	Adam	127	" It might be a great happiness to us all if she 'd have thee , for mother took to her so wonderful and seemed so contented to be with her . "
160231	160234	160236	160236	Seth	384	" Aye , "
160241	160258	160236	160236	Seth	384	" and Dinah 's fond o ' Hetty too ; she thinks a deal about her . "
160271	160275	160259	160259	Adam	127	" good - night "
160474	160644	160466	160466	Arthur	211	" DEAREST HETTY - I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you , and I shall never forget our love . I shall be your true friend as long as life lasts , and I hope to prove this to you in many ways . If I say anything to pain you in this letter , do not believe it is for want of love and tenderness towards you , for there is nothing I would not do for you , if I knew it to be really for your happiness . I can not bear to think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them away ; and if I followed only my own inclinations , I should be with her at this moment instead of writing . It is very hard for me to part from her - harder still for me to write words which may seem unkind , though they spring from the truest kindness . "
160995	161095	161096	161096	I	0	" And since I can not marry you , we must part - we must try not to feel like lovers any more . I am miserable while I say this , but nothing else can be . Be angry with me , my sweet one , I deserve it ; but do not believe that I shall not always care for you - always be grateful to you - always remember my Hetty ; and if any trouble should come that we do not now foresee , trust in me to do everything that lies in my power .

163086	163100	163101	163101	he	208	" Why , what 's put that into your head , my wench ? "
163114	163130	163101	163101	he	208	" I should like it - I should like it better than farm - work . "
163131	163219	163220	163221	Mr. Poyser	208	" Nay , nay ; you fancy so because you donna know it , my wench . It would n't be half so good for your health , nor for your luck i ' life . I 'd like you to stay wi ' us till you 've got a good husband : you 're my own niece , and I would n't have you go to service , though it was a gentleman 's house , as long as I 've got a home for you . "
163231	163237	163239	163239	Hetty	177	" I like the needlework , "
163241	163249	163239	163239	Hetty	177	" and I should get good wages . "
163250	163262	163264	163265	Mr. Poyser	208	" Has your aunt been a bit sharp wi ' you ? "
163274	163319	163264	163265	Mr. Poyser	208	" You mustna mind that , my wench - she does it for your good . She wishes you well ; an ' there is n't many aunts as are no kin to you ' ud ha ' done by you as she has . "
163320	163329	163331	163331	Hetty	177	" No , it is n't my aunt , "
163333	163342	163331	163331	Hetty	177	" but I should like the work better . "
163343	163449	163264	163265	Mr. Poyser	208	" It was all very well for you to learn the work a bit - an ' I gev my consent to that fast enough , sin ' Mrs. Pomfret was willing to teach you . For if anything was t ' happen , it 's well to know how to turn your hand to different sorts o ' things . But I niver meant you to go to service , my wench ; my family 's ate their own bread and cheese as fur back as anybody knows , hanna they , Father ? You wouldna like your grand - child to take wage ?

163656	163687	163642	163642	Martin	215	" She 'd but bad luck . But Hetty 's got as good a chance o ' getting a solid , sober husband as any gell i ' this country . "

She thinks it ' ud be a finer life than being wi ' them as are akin to her and ha ' brought her up sin ' she war no bigger nor Marty . She thinks there 's nothing belongs to being a lady 's maid but wearing finer clothes nor she was born to , I 'll be bound . It 's what rag she can get to stick on her as she 's thinking on from morning till night , as I often ask her if she would n't like to be the mawkin i ' the field , for then she 'd be made o ' rags inside and out . I 'll never gi ' my consent to her going for a lady 's maid , while she 's got good friends to take care on her till she 's married to somebody better nor one o ' them valets , as is neither a common man nor a gentleman , an ' must live on the fat o ' the land , an 's like enough to stick his hands under his coat - tails and expect his wife to work for him . "
164182	164187	164189	164190	Mr. Poyser	208	" Aye , aye , "
164192	164247	164189	164190	Mr. Poyser	208	" we must have a better husband for her nor that , and there 's better at hand . Come , my wench , give over crying and get to bed . I 'll do better for you nor letting you go for a lady 's maid . Let 's hear no more on't . "
164256	164292	164253	164253	he	208	" I canna make it out as she should want to go away , for I thought she 'd got a mind t ' Adam Bede . She 's looked like it o ' late . "
164293	164427	163813	163813	he	208	" Eh , there 's no knowing what she 's got a liking to , for things take no more hold on her than if she was a dried pea . I believe that gell , Molly - as is aggravatin ' enough , for the matter o ' that - but I believe she 'd care more about leaving us and the children , for all she 's been here but a year come Michaelmas , nor Hetty would . But she 's got this notion o ' being a lady 's maid wi ' going among them servants - we might ha ' known what it ' ud lead to when we let her go to learn the fine work . But I 'll put a stop to it pretty quick . "
164428	164446	164448	164449	Mr. Poyser	208	" Thee'dst be sorry to part wi ' her , if it was n't for her good , "
164451	164462	164448	164449	Mr. Poyser	208	" She 's useful to thee i ' the work . "
164463	164601	163813	163813	he	208	" Sorry ? Yes , I 'm fonder on her nor she deserves - a little hard - hearted hussy , wanting to leave us i ' that way . I ca n't ha ' had her about me these seven year , I reckon , and done for her , and taught her everything wi'out caring about her . An ' here I 'm having linen spun , an ' thinking all the while it 'll make sheeting and table - clothing for her when she 's married , an ' she 'll live i ' the parish wi ' us , and never go out of our sights - like a fool as I am for thinking aught about her , as is no better nor a cherry wi ' a hard stone inside it . "
164602	164615	164617	164618	Mr. Poyser	208	" Nay , nay , thee mustna make much of a trifle , "
164622	164668	164617	164618	Mr. Poyser	208	" She 's fond on us , I 'll be bound ; but she 's young , an ' gets things in her head as she ca n't rightly give account on . Them young fillies ' ull run away often wi'-ou ; knowing why . "
164913	164916	164918	164918	you	3670	" Strange ! "
164922	164956	164918	164918	you	3670	" this rush of impulse to - wards a course that might have seemed the most repugnant to her present state of mind , and in only the second night of her sadness ! "
165021	165035	165057	165058	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Let that man bear the loss who loosed it from its moorings . "
165059	165064	165057	165058	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Has Her Say Out "
165186	165192	165193	165193	he	146	" I see him myself , "
165196	165460	165193	165193	he	146	" I see him coming along by the Crab - tree Meadow on a bald - faced hoss . I 'd just been t ' hev a pint - it was half after ten i ' the fore - noon , when I hev my pint as reg'lar as the clock - and I says to Knowles , as druv up with his waggon , ' You 'll get a bit o ' barley to - day , Knowles , ' I says , ' if you look about you ' ; and then I went round by the rick - yard , and towart the Treddles'on road , and just as I come up by the big ash - tree , I see the man i ' top - boots coming along on a bald - faced hoss - I wish I may never stir if I did n't . And I stood still till he come up , and I says , ' Good morning , sir , ' I says , for I wanted to hear the turn of his tongue , as I might know whether he was a this - country man ; so I says , ' Good morning , sir : it 'll ' old hup for the barley this morning , I think . There 'll be a bit got hin , if we 've good luck . ' And he says , ' Eh , ye may be raight , there 's noo tallin ' , ' he says , and I knowed by that "
165469	165505	165463	165464	Mr. Casson	146	" as he did n't come from a hundred mile off . I daresay he 'd think me a hodd talker , as you Loamshire folks allays does hany one as talks the right language . "
165506	165511	165513	165514	Bartle Massey	206	" The right language ! "
165518	165543	165513	165514	Bartle Massey	206	" You 're about as near the right language as a pig 's squeaking is like a tune played on a key - bugle . "
165544	165552	165554	165555	Mr. Casson	146	" Well , I do n't know , "
165562	165595	165554	165555	Mr. Casson	146	" I should think a man as has lived among the gentry from a by , is likely to know what 's the right language pretty nigh as well as a schoolmaster . "
165596	165603	165605	165605	Bartle	206	" Aye , aye , man , "
165614	165653	165605	165605	Bartle	206	" you talk the right language for you . When Mike Holdsworth 's goat says ba - a - a , it 's all right - it ' ud be unnatural for it to make any other noise . "
165738	165776	165728	165729	Martin Poyser	215	" never went boozin ' with that set at Casson 's , a - sittin ' soakin ' in drink , and looking as wise as a lot o ' cod - fish wi ' red faces . "
165901	165942	165896	165896	she	5437	" I shouldna wonder if he 's come about that man as is a - going to take the Chase Farm , wanting Poyser to do something for him without pay . But Poyser 's a fool if he does . "
166015	166023	166025	166027	the old squire	6830	" Good - day , Mrs. Poyser , "
166052	166079	166048	166049	Mrs. Poyser	228	" allays aggravated me : it was as if you was a insect , and he was going to dab his finger - nail on you . "
166085	166091	166082	166082	she	5437	" Your servant , sir , "
166130	166140	166106	166106	she	5437	" Is your husband at home , Mrs. Poyser ? "
166141	166176	166232	166233	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Yes , sir ; he 's only i ' the rick - yard . I 'll send for him in a minute , if you 'll please to get down and step in . "
166177	166217	166232	166233	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Thank you ; I will do so . I want to consult him about a little matter ; but you are quite as much concerned in it , if not more . I must have your opinion too . "
166218	166230	166232	166233	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Hetty , run and tell your uncle to come in , "
166278	166287	166289	166290	Mr. Donnithorne	211	" What a fine old kitchen this is ! "
166319	166346	166296	166296	He	211	" And you keep it so exquisitely clean , Mrs. Poyser . I like these premises , do you know , beyond any on the estate . "
166347	166442	166296	166296	He	211	" Well , sir , since you 're fond of 'em , I should be glad if you 'd let a bit o ' repairs be done to 'em , for the boarding 's i ' that state as we 're like to be eaten up wi ' rats and mice ; and the cellar , you may stan ' up to your knees i ' water in't , if you like to go down ; but perhaps you 'd rather believe my words . Wo n't you please to sit down , sir ? "
166443	166474	166476	166477	the squire	2294	" Not yet ; I must see your dairy . I have not seen it for years , and I hear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter , "
166499	166544	166296	166296	He	211	" I think I see the door open , there . You must not be surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter . I do n't expect that Mrs. Satchell 's cream and butter will bear comparison with yours . "
166545	166586	166296	166296	He	211	" I ca n't say , sir , I 'm sure . It 's seldom I see other folks 's butter , though there 's some on it as one 's no need to see - the smell 's enough . "
166587	166595	166597	166598	Mr. Donnithorne	211	" Ah , now this I like , "
166615	166712	166597	166598	Mr. Donnithorne	211	" I 'm sure I should like my breakfast better if I knew the butter and cream came from this dairy . Thank you , that really is a pleasant sight . Unfortunately , my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp : I 'll sit down in your comfortable kitchen . Ah , Poyser , how do you do ? In the midst of business , I see , as usual . I 've been looking at your wife 's beautiful dairy - the best manager in the parish , is she not ? "
166739	166742	166744	166744	he	208	" pitching . "
166778	166789	166790	166790	he	208	" Will you please to take this chair , sir ? "
166804	166811	166790	166790	he	208	" you 'll find it easy . "
166812	166826	166828	166830	the old gentleman	3710	" No , thank you , I never sit in easy - chairs , "
166842	166890	166828	166830	the old gentleman	3710	" Do you know , Mrs. Poyser - sit down , pray , both of you - I 've been far from contented , for some time , with Mrs. Satchell 's dairy management . I think she has not a good method , as you have . "
166891	166903	166905	166906	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Indeed , sir , I ca n't speak to that , "
166989	167080	166967	166968	Mr. Poyser	208	" And now , Poyser , as Satchell is laid up , I am intending to let the Chase Farm to a respectable tenant . I 'm tired of having a farm on my own hands - nothing is made the best of in such cases , as you know . A satisfactory bailiff is hard to find ; and I think you and I , Poyser , and your excellent wife here , can enter into a little arrangement in consequence , which will be to our mutual advantage . "
167081	167084	167086	167087	Mr. Poyser	208	" Oh , "
167105	167116	167118	167119	Mrs. Poyser	228	" If I 'm called upon to speak , sir , "
167132	167200	167118	167119	Mrs. Poyser	228	" you know better than me ; but I do n't see what the Chase Farm is t ' us - we 've cumber enough wi ' our own farm . Not but what I 'm glad to hear o ' anybody respectable coming into the parish ; there 's some as ha ' been brought in as has n't been looked on i ' that character . "
167201	167255	167118	167119	Mrs. Poyser	228	" You 're likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbour , I assure you - such a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little plan I 'm going to mention , especially as I hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as his . "
167256	167315	167118	167119	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Indeed , sir , if it 's anything t ' our advantage , it 'll be the first offer o ' the sort I 've heared on . It 's them as take advantage that get advantage i ' this world , I think . Folks have to wait long enough afore it 's brought to 'em . "
167316	167323	167325	167326	the squire	2294	" The fact is , Poyser , "
167337	167506	167329	167330	Mrs. Poyser	228	" there is too much dairy land , and too little plough land , on the Chase Farm to suit Thurle 's purpose - indeed , he will only take the farm on condition of some change in it : his wife , it appears , is not a clever dairy - woman , like yours . Now , the plan I 'm thinking of is to effect a little exchange . If you were to have the Hollow Pastures , you might increase your dairy , which must be so profitable under your wife 's management ; and I should request you , Mrs. Poyser , to supply my house with milk , cream , and butter at the market prices . On the other hand , Poyser , you might let Thurle have the Lower and Upper Ridges , which really , with our wet seasons , would be a good riddance for you . There is much less risk in dairy land than corn land . "
167648	167653	167639	167639	he	208	" What dost say ? "
167712	167831	167834	167835	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Say ? Why , I say you may do as you like about giving up any o ' your corn - land afore your lease is up , which it wo n't be for a year come next Michaelmas , but I 'll not consent to take more dairy work into my hands , either for love or money ; and there 's nayther love nor money here , as I can see , on'y other folks 's love o ' theirselves , and the money as is to go into other folks 's pockets . I know there 's them as is born t ' own the land , and them as is born to sweat on't "
167842	167918	167834	167835	Mrs. Poyser	228	" and I know it 's christened folks 's duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood ' ull bear it ; but I 'll not make a martyr o ' myself , and wear myself to skin and bone , and worret myself as if I was a churn wi ' butter a - coming in't , for no landlord in England , not if he was King George himself . "
167919	167932	167934	167935	the squire	2294	" No , no , my dear Mrs. Poyser , certainly not , "
167946	168018	167934	167935	the squire	2294	" you must not overwork yourself ; but do n't you think your work will rather be lessened than increased in this way ? There is so much milk required at the Abbey that you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the addition to your dairy ; and I believe selling the milk is the most profitable way of disposing of dairy produce , is it not ? "
168019	168026	168028	168029	Mr. Poyser	208	" Aye , that 's true , "
168057	168061	168063	168064	Mrs. Poyser	228	" I daresay , "
168085	168307	168068	168068	her	228	" I daresay it 's true for men as sit i ' th ' chimney - corner and make believe as everything 's cut wi ' ins an ' outs to fit int ' everything else . If you could make a pudding wi ' thinking o ' the batter , it ' ud be easy getting dinner . How do I know whether the milk ' ull be wanted constant ? What 's to make me sure as the house wo n't be put o ' board wage afore we 're many months older , and then I may have to lie awake o ' nights wi ' twenty gallons o ' milk on my mind - and Dingall ' ull take no more butter , let alone paying for it ; and we must fat pigs till we 're obliged to beg the butcher on our knees to buy 'em , and lose half of 'em wi ' the measles . And there 's the fetching and carrying , as ' ud be welly half a day 's work for a man an ' hoss - that 's to be took out o ' the profits , I reckon ? But there 's folks ' ud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to carry away the water . "
168308	168326	168328	168329	the squire	2294	" That difficulty - about the fetching and carrying - you will not have , Mrs. Poyser , "
168350	168362	168328	168329	the squire	2294	" Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony . "
168363	168449	168461	168461	his	2294	" Oh , sir , begging your pardon , I 've never been used t ' having gentlefolks 's servants coming about my back places , a - making love to both the gells at once and keeping 'em with their hands on their hips listening to all manner o ' gossip when they should be down on their knees a - scouring . If we 're to go to ruin , it shanna be wi ' having our back kitchen turned into a public . "
168450	168455	168457	168458	the squire	2294	" Well , Poyser , "
168482	168588	168469	168470	Mrs. Poyser	228	" you can turn the Hollows into feeding - land . I can easily make another arrangement about supplying my house . And I shall not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour . I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three years , when the present one expires ; otherwise , I daresay Thurle , who is a man of some capital , would be glad to take both the farms , as they could be worked so well together . But I do n't want to part with an old tenant like you . "
168674	168687	168689	168690	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Well , sir , I think as it 's rether hard ... "
168723	169039	169041	169042	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Then , sir , if I may speak - as , for all I 'm a woman , and there 's folks as thinks a woman 's fool enough to stan ' by an ' look on while the men sign her soul away , I 've a right to speak , for I make one quarter o ' the rent , and save another quarter - I say , if Mr. Thurle 's so ready to take farms under you , it 's a pity but what he should take this , and see if he likes to live in a house wi ' all the plagues o ' Egypt in't - wi ' the cellar full o ' water , and frogs and toads hoppin ' up the steps by dozens - and the floors rotten , and the rats and mice gnawing every bit o ' cheese , and runnin ' over our heads as we lie i ' bed till we expect 'em to eat us up alive - as it 's a mercy they hanna eat the children long ago . I should like to see if there 's another tenant besides Poyser as ' ud put up wi ' never having a bit o ' repairs done till a place tumbles down - and not then , on'y wi ' begging and praying and having to pay half - and being strung up wi ' the rent as it 's much if he gets enough out o ' the land to pay , for all he 's put his own money into the ground beforehand . See if you 'll get a stranger to lead such a life here as that : a maggot must be born i ' the rotten cheese to like it , I reckon . You may run away from my words , sir , "
169118	169324	169114	169115	his master	5293	" You may run away from my words , sir , and you may go spinnin ' underhand ways o ' doing us a mischief , for you 've got Old Harry to your friend , though nobody else is , but I tell you for once as we 're not dumb creatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha ' got the lash i ' their hands , for want o ' knowing how t ' undo the tackle . An ' if I 'm th ' only one as speaks my mind , there 's plenty o ' the same way o ' thinking i ' this parish and the next to ' t , for your name 's no better than a brimstone match in everybody 's nose - if it isna two - three old folks as you think o ' saving your soul by giving 'em a bit o ' flannel and a drop o ' porridge . An ' you may be right i ' thinking it 'll take but little to save your soul , for it 'll be the smallest savin ' y ' iver made , wi ' all your scrapin ' . "
169500	169506	169508	169509	Mr. Poyser	208	" Thee'st done it now , "
169529	169539	169541	169542	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Yes , I know I 've done it , "
169544	169652	169541	169542	Mrs. Poyser	228	" but I 've had my say out , and I shall be th ' easier for't all my life . There 's no pleasure i ' living if you 're to be corked up for ever , and only dribble your mind out by the sly , like a leaky barrel . I sha n't repent saying what I think , if I live to be as old as th ' old squire ; and there 's little likelihood - for it seems as if them as are n't wanted here are th ' only folks as are n't wanted i ' th ' other world . "
169653	169669	169671	169672	Mr. Poyser	208	" But thee wutna like moving from th ' old place , this Michaelmas twelvemonth , "
169674	169701	169671	169672	Mr. Poyser	208	" and going into a strange parish , where thee know'st nobody . It 'll be hard upon us both , and upo ' Father too . "
169702	169738	169740	169741	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Eh , it 's no use worreting ; there 's plenty o ' things may happen between this and Michaelmas twelvemonth . The captain may be master afore them , for what we know , "
169770	169776	169778	169779	Mr. Poyser	208	" I'M none for worreting , "
169795	169839	169783	169783	his	208	" but I should be loath to leave th ' old place , and the parish where I was bred and born , and Father afore me . We should leave our roots behind us , I doubt , and niver thrive again . "
170026	170030	170020	170021	the Poysers	167	" put upon , "
170058	170060	170081	170082	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Bony "
170194	170201	170203	170204	Mr. Irwine	173	" No , no , Mother , "
170206	170262	170203	170204	Mr. Irwine	173	" it was a little bit of irregular justice on Mrs. Poyser 's part , but a magistrate like me must not countenance irregular justice . There must be no report spread that I have taken notice of the quarrel , else I shall lose the little good influence I have over the old man . "
170263	170278	170280	170281	Mrs. Irwine	200	" Well , I like that woman even better than her cream - cheeses , "
170283	170307	170280	170281	Mrs. Irwine	200	" She has the spirit of three men , with that pale face of hers . And she says such sharp things too . "
170308	170388	170203	170204	Mr. Irwine	173	" Sharp ! Yes , her tongue is like a new - set razor . She 's quite original in her talk too ; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with proverbs . I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craig - that he was like a cock , who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow . Now that 's an AEsop 's fable in a sentence . "
170389	170412	170414	170415	Mrs. Irwine	200	" But it will be a bad business if the old gentleman turns them out of the farm next Michaelmas , eh ? "
170417	170483	170414	170415	Mrs. Irwine	200	" Oh , that must not be ; and Poyser is such a good tenant that Donnithorne is likely to think twice , and digest his spleen rather than turn them out . But if he should give them notice at Lady Day , Arthur and I must move heaven and earth to mollify him . Such old parishioners as they are must not go . "
170484	170498	170500	170501	Mrs. Irwine	200	" Ah , there 's no knowing what may happen before Lady day , "
170503	170551	170500	170501	Mrs. Irwine	200	" It struck me on Arthur 's birthday that the old man was a little shaken : he 's eighty - three , you know . It 's really an unconscionable age . It 's only women who have a right to live as long as that . "
170552	170568	170570	170571	Mr. Irwine	173	" When they 've got old - bachelor sons who would be forlorn without them , "
170599	170610	170500	170501	Mrs. Irwine	200	" There 's no knowing what may happen before Lady day "
170720	170744	170717	170718	the girl	5762	" closer tempered , and sometimes she seemed as if there 'd be no drawing a word from her with cart - ropes , "
171020	171030	171016	171017	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Come , Hetty , where have you been ? "
171184	171188	171189	171189	he	127	" Poor thing ! "
171194	171227	171189	171189	he	127	" that 's allays likely . It 's because she 's had her first heartache . But she 's got a spirit to bear up under it . Thank God for that . "
172309	172313	172303	172303	he	127	" good - bye "
173078	173083	173084	173084	He	208	" keep her company . "
173220	173274	173214	173214	he	127	" Now , then , which is the stoutest walker ? Him as gets to th ' home - gate first shall be the first to go with me to Binton Coppice on the donkey . But Tommy must have the start up to the next stile , because he 's the smallest . "
173305	173316	173297	173297	he	127	" Wo n't you hang on my arm , Hetty ? "
173581	173610	173578	173578	he	127	" I 'm going to tell your uncle some news that 'll surprise him , Hetty ; and I think he 'll be glad to hear it too . "
173611	173616	173617	173617	Hetty	177	" What 's that ? "
173621	173643	173617	173617	Hetty	177	" Why , Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his business , and I 'm going to take it . "
173824	173836	173819	173819	he	127	" Hetty , dear Hetty , what are you crying for ? "
173928	173961	173925	173925	he	127	" I could afford to be married now , Hetty - I could make a wife comfortable ; but I shall never want to be married if you wo n't have me . "
174078	174106	174063	174063	he	127	" Do you really love me , Hetty ? Will you be my own wife , to love and take care of as long as I live ? "
174177	174192	174173	174173	He	127	" I may tell your uncle and aunt , may n't I , Hetty ? "
174197	174200	174173	174173	He	127	" Yes . "
174259	174272	174274	174274	Adam	127	" I hope you have no objections against me for her husband , "
174276	174296	174274	174274	Adam	127	" I 'm a poor man as yet , but she shall want nothing as I can work for . "
174297	174300	174302	174303	Mr. Poyser	208	" Objections ? "
174315	174320	174313	174313	his	2581	" Nay , nay . "
174321	174401	174313	174313	his	2581	" What objections can we ha ' to you , lad ? Never mind your being poorish as yet ; there 's money in your head - piece as there 's money i ' the sown field , but it must ha ' time . You'n got enough to begin on , and we can do a deal tow'rt the bit o ' furniture you 'll want . Thee'st got feathers and linen to spare - plenty , eh ? "
174452	174466	174467	174467	she	228	" It ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen , "
174472	174498	174467	174467	she	228	" when I never sell a fowl but what 's plucked , and the wheel 's a - going every day o ' the week . "
174499	174505	174507	174508	Mr. Poyser	208	" Come , my wench , "
174515	174528	174529	174529	Hetty	177	" come and kiss us , and let us wish you luck . "
174542	174545	174546	174546	he	3869	" There ! "
174555	174621	174622	174622	he	3869	" go and kiss your aunt and your grandfather . I 'm as wishful t ' have you settled well as if you was my own daughter ; and so 's your aunt , I 'll be bound , for she 's done by you this seven ' ear , Hetty , as if you 'd been her own . Come , come , now , "
174642	174662	174622	174622	he	3869	" Adam wants a kiss too , I 'll warrant , and he 's a right to one now . "
174674	174684	174663	174663	Hetty	177	" Come , Adam , then , take one , "
174689	174698	174699	174699	Adam	127	" else y ' arena half a man . "
174945	174950	174952	174953	Mr. Poyser	208	" Well , well , "
174957	175004	174952	174953	Mr. Poyser	208	" we needna fix everything to - night . We must take time to consider . You canna think o ' getting married afore Easter . I 'm not for long courtships , but there must be a bit o ' time to make things comfortable . "
175005	175012	175014	175015	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Aye , to be sure , "
175022	175035	175014	175015	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Christian folks ca n't be married like cuckoos , I reckon . "
175036	175045	175047	175048	Mr. Poyser	208	" I 'm a bit daunted , though , "
175050	175074	175047	175048	Mr. Poyser	208	" when I think as we may have notice to quit , and belike be forced to take a farm twenty mile off . "
175075	175078	175080	175082	the old man	6335	" Eh , "
175107	175141	175142	175142	he	6335	" it 's a poor tale if I mun leave th ' ould spot an be buried in a strange parish . An ' you 'll happen ha ' double rates to pay , "
175151	175161	175163	175163	Martin	215	" Well , thee mustna fret beforehand , father , "
175167	175205	175163	175163	Martin	215	" Happen the captain ' ull come home and make our peace wi ' th ' old squire . I build upo ' that , for I know the captain 'll see folks righted if he can . "
175293	175296	175303	175303	his	127	" run up "
175367	175381	175364	175364	Hetty	177	" Yes ; I 'd as soon she lived with us as not . "
175429	175443	175418	175418	Seth	384	" it was no use - Dinah 's heart wasna turned towards marrying . "
175499	175564	175472	175472	she	177	" Eh , my lad , I 'll be as still as th ' ould tabby , an ' ne'er want to do aught but th ' offal work , as she wonna like t ' do . An ' then we needna part the platters an ' things , as ha ' stood on the shelf together sin ' afore thee wast born . "
175739	175762	175718	175719	Mr. Poyser	208	" doubted the lass was o'erdoing it - she must have a bit o ' rest when her aunt could come downstairs . "
175837	175859	175835	175835	she	177	" it was because they were not for th ' outside , else she 'd ha ' bought 'em fast enough . "
177316	177398	177312	177312	he	1355	" I wish Dinah ' ud come again now , for she 'd be a comfort to your aunt when you 're gone . What do you think , my wench , o ' going to see her as soon as you can be spared and persuading her to come back wi ' you ? You might happen persuade her wi ' telling her as her aunt wants her , for all she writes o ' not being able to come . "
177423	177432	177419	177419	she	177	" It 's so far off , Uncle . "
177668	177684	177685	177685	he	127	" I wish I could go with you and take care of you , Hetty , "
177699	177717	177685	177685	he	127	" but you wo n't stay much beyond a week - the time ' ull seem long . "
177783	177791	177793	177793	Adam	127	" God bless her for loving me , "
178303	178321	178290	178290	he	3976	" He 's pretty nigh six foot , I 'll be bound , isna he , now ? "
178322	178325	178327	178327	Hetty	177	" Who ? "
178332	178356	178327	178327	Hetty	177	" Why , the sweetheart as you 've left behind , or else him as you 're goin' arter - which is it ? "
178444	178449	178451	178452	the coachman	3985	" Hegh , hegh ! "
178467	178497	178451	178452	the coachman	3985	" you munna take it too ser'ous ; if he 's behaved ill , get another . Such a pretty lass as you can get a sweetheart any day . "
178791	178815	178775	178775	he	5325	" Well , I ca n't rightly say . Windsor must be pretty nigh London , for it 's where the king lives , "
178820	178889	178775	178775	he	5325	" Anyhow , you 'd best go t ' Ashby next - that 's south'ard . But there 's as many places from here to London as there 's houses in Stoniton , by what I can make out . I 've never been no traveller myself . But how comes a lone young woman like you to be thinking o ' taking such a journey as that ? "
178890	178905	178907	178907	Hetty	177	" I 'm going to my brother - he 's a soldier at Windsor , "
178917	178942	178907	178907	Hetty	177	" I ca n't afford to go by the coach ; do you think there 's a cart goes toward Ashby in the morning ? "
178943	178985	178775	178775	he	5325	" Yes , there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started from ; but you might run over the town before you found out . You 'd best set off and walk , and trust to summat overtaking you . "
180283	180300	180302	180302	Hetty	177	" Could you take me up in your waggon , if you 're going towards Ashby ? "
180304	180312	180302	180302	Hetty	177	" I 'll pay you for it . "
180313	180316	180318	180320	the big fellow	4028	" Aw , "
180333	180380	180318	180320	the big fellow	4028	" I can take y ' up fawst enough wi'out bein ' paid for't if you dooant mind lyin ' a bit closish a - top o ' the wool - packs . Where do you coom from ? And what do you want at Ashby ? "
180381	180397	180302	180302	Hetty	177	" I come from Stoniton . I 'm going a long way - to Windsor . "
180398	180408	180302	180302	Hetty	177	" What ! Arter some service , or what ? "
180409	180421	180302	180302	Hetty	177	" Going to my brother - he 's a soldier there . "
180422	180521	180302	180302	Hetty	177	" Well , I 'm going no furder nor Leicester - and fur enough too - but I 'll take you , if you dooant mind being a bit long on the road . Th ' hosses wooant feel YOUR weight no more nor they feel the little doog there , as I puck up on the road a fortni't agoo . He war lost , I b'lieve , an 's been all of a tremble iver sin ' . Come , gi ' us your basket an ' come behind and let me put y ' in . "
180578	180590	181331	181331	you	4030	" ; he himself was going to eat his dinner at this "
180593	181250	181252	181252	him	4030	" Late at night they reached Leicester , and so this second day of Hetty 's journey was past . She had spent no money except what she had paid for her food , but she felt that this slow journeying would be intolerable for her another day , and in the morning she found her way to a coach - office to ask about the road to Windsor , and see if it would cost her too much to go part of the distance by coach again . Yes ! The distance was too great - the coaches were too dear - she must give them up ; but the elderly clerk at the office , touched by her pretty anxious face , wrote down for her the names of the chief places she must pass through . This was the only comfort she got in Leicester , for the men stared at her as she went along the street , and for the first time in her life Hetty wished no one would look at her . She set out walking again ; but this day she was fortunate , for she was soon overtaken by a carrier 's cart which carried her to Hinckley , and by the help of a return chaise , with a drunken postilion - who frightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi , and shouting hilarious remarks at her , twisting himself backwards on his saddle - she was before night in the heart of woody Warwickshire : but still almost a hundred miles from Windsor , they told her . Oh what a large world it was , and what hard work for her to find her way in it ! She went by mistake to Stratford - on - Avon , finding Stratford set down in her list of places , and then she was told she had come a long way out of the right road . It was not till the fifth day that she got to Stony Stratford . That seems but a slight journey as you look at the map , or remember your own pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon . But how wearily long it was to Hetty ! It seemed to her as if this country of flat fields , and hedgerows , and dotted houses , and villages , and market - towns - all so much alike to her indifferent eyes - must have no end , and she must go on wandering among them for ever , waiting tired at toll - gates for some cart to come , and then finding the cart went only a little way - a very little way - to the miller 's a mile off perhaps ; and she hated going into the public houses , where she must go to get food and ask questions , because there were always men lounging there , who stared at her and joked her rudely . Her body was very weary too with these days of new fatigue and anxiety ; they had made her look more pale and worn than all the time of hidden dread she had gone through at home . When at last she reached Stony Stratford , her impatience and weariness had become too strong for her economical caution ; she determined to take the coach for the rest of the way , though it should cost her all her remaining money . She would need nothing at Windsor but to find Arthur . When she had paid the fare for the last coach , she had only a shilling ; and as she got down at the sign of the Green Man in Windsor at twelve o'clock in the middle of the seventh day , hungry and faint , the coachman came up , and begged her to "
181254	181329	181252	181252	him	4030	" She put her hand in her pocket and took out the shilling , but the tears came with the sense of exhaustion and the thought that she was giving away her last means of getting food , which she really required before she could go in search of Arthur . As she held out the shilling , she lifted up her dark tear - filled eyes to the coachman 's face and said , "
181337	181338	181331	181331	you	4030	" "
181343	181349	181331	181331	you	4030	" he said , gruffly , "
181359	181419	181422	181423	young woman	4031	" The landlord of the Green Man had stood near enough to witness this scene , and he was a man whose abundant feeding served to keep his good nature , as well as his person , in high condition . And that lovely tearful face of Hetty 's would have found out the sensitive fibre in most men . "
181428	181432	181422	181423	young woman	4031	" he said , "
181452	181465	181447	181447	I	0	" He took her into the bar and said to his wife , "
181483	181669	181478	181478	she	5393	" - for Hetty 's tears were falling fast . They were merely hysterical tears : she thought she had no reason for weeping now , and was vexed that she was too weak and tired to help it . She was at Windsor at last , not far from Arthur . She looked with eager , hungry eyes at the bread and meat and beer that the landlady brought her , and for some minutes she forgot everything else in the delicious sensations of satisfying hunger and recovering from exhaustion . The landlady sat opposite to her as she ate , and looked at her earnestly . No wonder : Hetty had thrown off her bonnet , and her curls had fallen down . Her face was all the more touching in its youth and beauty because of its weary look , and the good woman 's eyes presently wandered to her figure , which in her hurried dressing on her journey she had taken no pains to conceal ; moreover , the stranger 's eye detects what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed . "
181680	181694	181672	181672	you	4035	" she said , glancing while she spoke at Hetty 's ringless hand . "
181700	181701	181696	181696	you	4035	" "
181704	181730	181696	181696	you	4035	" said Hetty , roused by this question to exert more self - command , and feeling the better for the food she had taken . "
181763	181835	181752	181752	you	4035	" Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit of paper : it was the end of Arthur 's letter on which he had written his address . While she was speaking , the landlord had come in and had begun to look at her as earnestly as his wife had done . He took up the piece of paper which Hetty handed across the table , and read the address . "
181846	181880	181840	181840	you	0	" he said . It is in the nature of innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business of their own to ask as many questions as possible before giving any information . "
181891	181895	181881	181881	I	0	" said Hetty . "
181903	181908	181899	181901	no gentleman there	4039	" returned the landlord . "
181938	181939	181928	181928	I	0	" "
181945	181970	181942	181943	Captain Donnithorne	154	" said Hetty tremulously , her heart beginning to beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should find Arthur at once . "
181978	181985	181971	181972	Captain Donnithorne	154	" said the landlord , slowly . "
182016	182017	182007	182014	a servant by the name o ' Pym	4042	" "
182021	182025	182026	182026	you	0	" said Hetty ; "
182034	182035	182032	182032	he	154	" "
182061	182062	182111	182111	I	0	" "
182070	182104	182066	182066	She	4043	" said the landlady , hastening to support Hetty , who had lost her miserable consciousness and looked like a beautiful corpse . They carried her to the sofa and loosened her dress . "
182114	182126	182111	182111	I	0	" said the landlord , as he brought in some water . "
182140	182145	182146	182146	She	4043	" said the wife . "
182219	182220	182196	182196	He	4049	" "
182232	182237	182238	182238	She	4043	" said the husband . "
182261	182262	182238	182238	She	4043	" "
182284	182301	182275	182275	she	4043	" said the landlady , who on any charitable construction must have been supposed to have more "
182303	182307	182309	182309	she	4043	" than beauty . "
182321	182629	182309	182309	she	4043	" Chapter XXXVII The Journey in Despair HETTY was too ill through the rest of that day for any questions to be addressed to her - too ill even to think with any distinctness of the evils that were to come . She only felt that all her hope was crushed , and that instead of having found a refuge she had only reached the borders of a new wilderness where no goal lay before her . The sensations of bodily sickness , in a comfortable bed , and with the tendance of the good - natured landlady , made a sort of respite for her ; such a respite as there is in the faint weariness which obliges a man to throw himself on the sand instead of toiling onward under the scorching sun . But when sleep and rest had brought back the strength necessary for the keenness of mental suffering - when she lay the next morning looking at the growing light which was like a cruel task - master returning to urge from her a fresh round of hated hopeless labour - she began to think what course she must take , to remember that all her money was gone , to look at the prospect of further wandering among strangers with the new clearness shed on it by the experience of her journey to Windsor . But which way could she turn ? It was impossible for her to enter into any service , even if she could obtain it . There was nothing but immediate beggary before her . She thought of a young woman who had been found against the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday , nearly dead with cold and hunger - a tiny infant in her arms . The woman was rescued and taken to the parish . "
182633	182719	182309	182309	she	4043	" You can perhaps hardly understand the effect of that word on a mind like Hetty 's , brought up among people who were somewhat hard in their feelings even towards poverty , who lived among the fields , and had little pity for want and rags as a cruel inevitable fate such as they sometimes seem in cities , but held them a mark of idleness and vice - and it was idleness and vice that brought burdens on the parish . To Hetty the "
182721	183044	182309	182309	she	4043	" was next to the prison in obloquy , and to ask anything of strangers - to beg - lay in the same far - off hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her life thought it impossible she could ever come near . But now the remembrance of that wretched woman whom she had seen herself , on her way from church , being carried into Joshua Rann 's , came back upon her with the new terrible sense that there was very little now to divide HER from the same lot . And the dread of bodily hardship mingled with the dread of shame ; for Hetty had the luxurious nature of a round soft - coated pet animal . How she yearned to be back in her safe home again , cherished and cared for as she had always been ! Her aunt 's scolding about trifles would have been music to her ears now ; she longed for it ; she used to hear it in a time when she had only trifles to hide . Could she be the same Hetty that used to make up the butter in the dairy with the Guelder roses peeping in at the window - she , a runaway whom her friends would not open their doors to again , lying in this strange bed , with the knowledge that she had no money to pay for what she received , and must offer those strangers some of the clothes in her basket ? It was then she thought of her locket and ear - rings , and seeing her pocket lie near , she reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her . There were the locket and ear - rings in the little velvet - lined boxes , and with them there was a beautiful silver thimble which Adam had bought her , the words "
183047	183880	183881	183881	I	0	" making the ornament of the border ; a steel purse , with her one shilling in it ; and a small red - leather case , fastening with a strap . Those beautiful little ear - rings , with their delicate pearls and garnet , that she had tried in her ears with such longing in the bright sunshine on the 30th of July ! She had no longing to put them in her ears now : her head with its dark rings of hair lay back languidly on the pillow , and the sadness that rested about her brow and eyes was something too hard for regretful memory . Yet she put her hands up to her ears : it was because there were some thin gold rings in them , which were also worth a little money . Yes , she could surely get some money for her ornaments : those Arthur had given her must have cost a great deal of money . The landlord and landlady had been good to her ; perhaps they would help her to get the money for these things . But this money would not keep her long . What should she do when it was gone ? Where should she go ? The horrible thought of want and beggary drove her once to think she would go back to her uncle and aunt and ask them to forgive her and have pity on her . But she shrank from that idea again , as she might have shrunk from scorching metal . She could never endure that shame before her uncle and aunt , before Mary Burge , and the servants at the Chase , and the people at Broxton , and everybody who knew her . They should never know what had happened to her . What could she do ? She would go away from Windsor - travel again as she had done the last week , and get among the flat green fields with the high hedges round them , where nobody could see her or know her ; and there , perhaps , when there was nothing else she could do , she should get courage to drown herself in some pond like that in the Scantlands . Yes , she would get away from Windsor as soon as possible : she did n't like these people at the inn to know about her , to know that she had come to look for Captain Donnithorne . She must think of some reason to tell them why she had asked for him . With this thought she began to put the things back into her pocket , meaning to get up and dress before the landlady came to her . She had her hand on the red - leather case , when it occurred to her that there might be something in this case which she had forgotten - something worth selling ; for without knowing what she should do with her life , she craved the means of living as long as possible ; and when we desire eagerly to find something , we are apt to search for it in hopeless places . No , there was nothing but common needles and pins , and dried tulip - petals between the paper leaves where she had written down her little money - accounts . But on one of these leaves there was a name , which , often as she had seen it before , now flashed on Hetty 's mind like a newly discovered message . The name was - Dinah Morris , Snowfield . There was a text above it , written , as well as the name , by Dinah 's own hand with a little pencil , one evening that they were sitting together and Hetty happened to have the red case lying open before her . Hetty did not read the text now : she was only arrested by the name . Now , for the first time , she remembered without indifference the affectionate kindness Dinah had shown her , and those words of Dinah in the bed - chamber - that Hetty must think of her as a friend in trouble . Suppose she were to go to Dinah , and ask her to help her ? Dinah did not think about things as other people did . She was a mystery to Hetty , but Hetty knew she was always kind . She could n't imagine Dinah 's face turning away from her in dark reproof or scorn , Dinah 's voice willingly speaking ill of her , or rejoicing in her misery as a punishment . Dinah did not seem to belong to that world of Hetty 's , whose glance she dreaded like scorching fire . But even to her Hetty shrank from beseeching and confession . She could not prevail on herself to say , "
183886	184201	183885	183885	Dinah	141	" : she only thought of that as a possible alternative , if she had not courage for death . The good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come downstairs soon after herself , neatly dressed , and looking resolutely self - possessed . Hetty told her she was quite well this morning . She had only been very tired and overcome with her journey , for she had come a long way to ask about her brother , who had run away , and they thought he was gone for a soldier , and Captain Donnithorne might know , for he had been very kind to her brother once . It was a lame story , and the landlady looked doubtfully at Hetty as she told it ; but there was a resolute air of self - reliance about her this morning , so different from the helpless prostration of yesterday , that the landlady hardly knew how to make a remark that might seem like prying into other people 's affairs . She only invited her to sit down to breakfast with them , and in the course of it Hetty brought out her ear - rings and locket , and asked the landlord if he could help her to get money for them . Her journey , she said , had cost her much more than she expected , and now she had no money to get back to her friends , which she wanted to do at once . It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments , for she had examined the contents of Hetty 's pocket yesterday , and she and her husband had discussed the fact of a country girl having these beautiful things , with a stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been miserably deluded by the fine young officer . "
184204	184219	184225	184226	the jeweller	4058	" said the landlord , when Hetty had spread the precious trifles before him , "
184268	184277	184259	184259	you	4061	" he added , looking at her inquiringly . "
184285	184302	184259	184259	you	4061	" said Hetty , hastily , ' so as I can get money to go back . "
184303	184320	184321	184321	he	4062	" And they might think the things were stolen , as you wanted to sell 'em , "
184325	184344	184321	184321	he	4062	" for it is n't usual for a young woman like you to have fine jew'llery like that . "
184355	184362	184363	184363	she	177	" I belong to respectable folks , "
184366	184373	184363	184363	she	177	" I 'm not a thief . "
184374	184387	184389	184390	the landlady	8628	" No , that you are n't , I 'll be bound , "
184392	184402	184389	184390	the landlady	8628	" and you 'd no call to say that , "
184409	184425	184389	184390	the landlady	8628	" The things were gev to her : that 's plain enough to be seen . "
184426	184436	184438	184439	the husband	812	" I did n't mean as I thought so , "
184443	184467	184438	184439	the husband	812	" but I said it was what the jeweller might think , and so he would n't be offering much money for 'em . "
184468	184471	184473	184474	the wife	6945	" Well , "
184525	184682	184687	184687	you	4070	" I will not say that in this accommodating proposition the landlady had no regard whatever to the possible reward of her good nature in the ultimate possession of the locket and ear - rings : indeed , the effect they would have in that case on the mind of the grocer 's wife had presented itself with remarkable vividness to her rapid imagination . The landlord took up the ornaments and pushed out his lips in a meditative manner . He wished Hetty well , doubtless ; but pray , how many of your well - wishers would decline to make a little gain out of you ? Your landlady is sincerely affected at parting with you , respects you highly , and will really rejoice if any one else is generous to you ; but at the same time she hands you a bill by which she gains as high a percentage as possible . "
184697	184707	184687	184687	you	4070	" said the well - wisher , at length . "
184711	184738	184687	184687	you	4070	" answered Hetty , fixing on the sum she set out with , for want of any other standard , and afraid of asking too much . "
184751	184756	184741	184741	I	0	" said the landlord ; "
184788	184789	184778	184780	The Green Man	4073	" "
184805	184831	184799	184799	you	0	" said Hetty , relieved at the thought that she would not have to go to the jeweller 's and be stared at and questioned . "
184846	184851	184840	184840	you	4070	" said the landlady , "
184872	184873	184840	184840	you	4070	" "
184876	184981	184840	184840	you	4070	" said Hetty indifferently . The husband and wife were equally content with this arrangement . The husband thought , if the ornaments were not redeemed , he could make a good thing of it by taking them to London and selling them . The wife thought she would coax the good man into letting her keep them . And they were accommodating Hetty , poor thing - a pretty , respectable - looking young woman , apparently in a sad case . They declined to take anything for her food and bed : she was quite welcome . And at eleven o'clock Hetty said "
184985	187240	184840	184840	you	4070	" to them with the same quiet , resolute air she had worn all the morning , mounting the coach that was to take her twenty miles back along the way she had come . There is a strength of self - possession which is the sign that the last hope has departed . Despair no more leans on others than perfect contentment , and in despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the sense of dependence . Hetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make life hateful to her ; and no one , she said to herself , should ever know her misery and humiliation . No ; she would not confess even to Dinah . She would wander out of sight , and drown herself where her body would never be found , and no one should know what had become of her . When she got off this coach , she began to walk again , and take cheap rides in carts , and get cheap meals , going on and on without distinct purpose , yet strangely , by some fascination , taking the way she had come , though she was determined not to go back to her own country . Perhaps it was because she had fixed her mind on the grassy Warwickshire fields , with the bushy tree - studded hedgerows that made a hiding - place even in this leafless season . She went more slowly than she came , often getting over the stiles and sitting for hours under the hedgerows , looking before her with blank , beautiful eyes ; fancying herself at the edge of a hidden pool , low down , like that in the Scantlands ; wondering if it were very painful to be drowned , and if there would be anything worse after death than what she dreaded in life . Religious doctrines had taken no hold on Hetty 's mind . She was one of those numerous people who have had godfathers and godmothers , learned their catechism , been confirmed , and gone to church every Sunday , and yet , for any practical result of strength in life , or trust in death , have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian feeling . You would misunderstand her thoughts during these wretched days , if you imagined that they were influenced either by religious fears or religious hopes . She chose to go to Stratford - on - Avon again , where she had gone before by mistake , for she remembered some grassy fields on her former way towards it - fields among which she thought she might find just the sort of pool she had in her mind . Yet she took care of her money still ; she carried her basket ; death seemed still a long way off , and life was so strong in her . She craved food and rest - she hastened towards them at the very moment she was picturing to herself the bank from which she would leap towards death . It was already five days since she had left Windsor , for she had wandered about , always avoiding speech or questioning looks , and recovering her air of proud self - dependence whenever she was under observation , choosing her decent lodging at night , and dressing herself neatly in the morning , and setting off on her way steadily , or remaining under shelter if it rained , as if she had a happy life to cherish . And yet , even in her most self - conscious moments , the face was sadly different from that which had smiled at itself in the old specked glass , or smiled at others when they glanced at it admiringly . A hard and even fierce look had come in the eyes , though their lashes were as long as ever , and they had all their dark brightness . And the cheek was never dimpled with smiles now . It was the same rounded , pouting , childish prettiness , but with all love and belief in love departed from it - the sadder for its beauty , like that wondrous Medusa - face , with the passionate , passionless lips . At last she was among the fields she had been dreaming of , on a long narrow pathway leading towards a wood . If there should be a pool in that wood ! It would be better hidden than one in the fields . No , it was not a wood , only a wild brake , where there had once been gravel - pits , leaving mounds and hollows studded with brushwood and small trees . She roamed up and down , thinking there was perhaps a pool in every hollow before she came to it , till her limbs were weary , and she sat down to rest . The afternoon was far advanced , and the leaden sky was darkening , as if the sun were setting behind it . After a little while Hetty started up again , feeling that darkness would soon come on ; and she must put off finding the pool till to - morrow , and make her way to some shelter for the night . She had quite lost her way in the fields , and might as well go in one direction as another , for aught she knew . She walked through field after field , and no village , no house was in sight ; but there , at the corner of this pasture , there was a break in the hedges ; the land seemed to dip down a little , and two trees leaned towards each other across the opening . Hetty 's heart gave a great heat as she thought there must be a pool there . She walked towards it heavily over the tufted grass , with pale lips and a sense of trembling . It was as if the thing were come in spite of herself , instead of being the object of her search . There it was , black under the darkening sky : no motion , no sound near . She set down her basket , and then sank down herself on the grass , trembling . The pool had its wintry depth now : by the time it got shallow , as she remembered the pools did at Hayslope , in the summer , no one could find out that it was her body . But then there was her basket - she must hide that too . She must throw it into the water - make it heavy with stones first , and then throw it in . She got up to look about for stones , and soon brought five or six , which she laid down beside her basket , and then sat down again . There was no need to hurry - there was all the night to drown herself in . She sat leaning her elbow on the basket . She was weary , hungry . There were some buns in her basket - three , which she had supplied herself with at the place where she ate her dinner . She took them out now and ate them eagerly , and then sat still again , looking at the pool . The soothed sensation that came over her from the satisfaction of her hunger , and this fixed dreamy attitude , brought on drowsiness , and presently her head sank down on her knees . She was fast asleep . When she awoke it was deep night , and she felt chill . She was frightened at this darkness - frightened at the long night before her . If she could but throw herself into the water ! No , not yet . She began to walk about that she might get warm again , as if she would have more resolution then . Oh how long the time was in that darkness ! The bright hearth and the warmth and the voices of home , the secure uprising and lying down , the familiar fields , the familiar people , the Sundays and holidays with their simple joys of dress and feasting - all the sweets of her young life rushed before her now , and she seemed to be stretching her arms towards them across a great gulf . She set her teeth when she thought of Arthur . She cursed him , without knowing what her cursing would do . She wished he too might know desolation , and cold , and a life of shame that he dared not end by death . The horror of this cold , and darkness , and solitude - out of all human reach - became greater every long minute . It was almost as if she were dead already , and knew that she was dead , and longed to get back to life again . But no : she was alive still ; she had not taken the dreadful leap . She felt a strange contradictory wretchedness and exultation : wretchedness , that she did not dare to face death ; exultation , that she was still in life - that she might yet know light and warmth again . She walked backwards and forwards to warm herself , beginning to discern something of the objects around her , as her eyes became accustomed to the night - the darker line of the hedge , the rapid motion of some living creature - perhaps a field - mouse - rushing across the grass . She no longer felt as if the darkness hedged her in . She thought she could walk back across the field , and get over the stile ; and then , in the very next field , she thought she remembered there was a hovel of furze near a sheepfold . If she could get into that hovel , she would be warmer . She could pass the night there , for that was what Alick did at Hayslope in lambing - time . The thought of this hovel brought the energy of a new hope . She took up her basket and walked across the field , but it was some time before she got in the right direction for the stile . The exercise and the occupation of finding the stile were a stimulus to her , however , and lightened the horror of the darkness and solitude . There were sheep in the next field , and she startled a group as she set down her basket and got over the stile ; and the sound of their movement comforted her , for it assured her that her impression was right - this was the field where she had seen the hovel , for it was the field where the sheep were . Right on along the path , and she would get to it . She reached the opposite gate , and felt her way along its rails and the rails of the sheep - fold , till her hand encountered the pricking of the gorsy wall . Delicious sensation ! She had found the shelter . She groped her way , touching the prickly gorse , to the door , and pushed it open . It was an ill - smelling close place , but warm , and there was straw on the ground . Hetty sank down on the straw with a sense of escape . Tears came - she had never shed tears before since she left Windsor - tears and sobs of hysterical joy that she had still hold of life , that she was still on the familiar earth , with the sheep near her . The very consciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her : she turned up her sleeves , and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life . Soon warmth and weariness lulled her in the midst of her sobs , and she fell continually into dozing , fancying herself at the brink of the pool again - fancying that she had jumped into the water , and then awaking with a start , and wondering where she was . But at last deep dreamless sleep came ; her head , guarded by her bonnet , found a pillow against the gorsy wall , and the poor soul , driven to and fro between two equal terrors , found the one relief that was possible to it - the relief of unconsciousness . Alas ! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun . It seemed to Hetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into another dream - that she was in the hovel , and her aunt was standing over her with a candle in her hand . She trembled under her aunt 's glance , and opened her eyes . There was no candle , but there was light in the hovel - the light of early morning through the open door . And there was a face looking down on her ; but it was an unknown face , belonging to an elderly man in a smock - frock . "
187252	187326	187245	187245	you	4075	" the man said roughly . Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than she had done in her momentary dream under her aunt 's glance . She felt that she was like a beggar already - found sleeping in that place . But in spite of her trembling , she was so eager to account to the man for her presence here , that she found words at once . "
187332	187336	187327	187327	I	0	" she said . "
187372	187460	187362	187362	you	4080	" She got up as she was speaking , and put her hands to her bonnet to adjust it , and then laid hold of her basket . The man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze , without giving her any answer , for some seconds . Then he turned away and walked towards the door of the hovel , but it was not till he got there that he stood still , and , turning his shoulder half - round towards her , said , "
187489	187500	187479	187479	you	0	" he added , with a tone of gruff reproof . "
187513	187514	187479	187479	you	0	" "
187517	187521	187479	187479	you	0	" said Hetty , "
187551	187552	187537	187537	you	0	" "
187573	187582	187583	187583	Anybody	492	" the man said , still more gruffly . "
187599	187704	187589	187591	a wild woman	4086	" Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man , and still more at this last suggestion that she looked like a wild woman . As she followed him out of the hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for telling her the way , and then he would not suppose she was wild . As he stopped to point out the road to her , she put her hand in her pocket to get the six - pence ready , and when he was turning away , without saying good - morning , she held it out to him and said , "
187718	187730	187709	187709	you	4087	" He looked slowly at the sixpence , and then said , "
187771	188698	187764	187766	a mad woman	4090	" The man left her without further speech , and Hetty held on her way . Another day had risen , and she must wander on . It was no use to think of drowning herself - she could not do it , at least while she had money left to buy food and strength to journey on . But the incident on her waking this morning heightened her dread of that time when her money would be all gone ; she would have to sell her basket and clothes then , and she would really look like a beggar or a wild woman , as the man had said . The passionate joy in life she had felt in the night , after escaping from the brink of the black cold death in the pool , was gone now . Life now , by the morning light , with the impression of that man 's hard wondering look at her , was as full of dread as death - it was worse ; it was a dread to which she felt chained , from which she shrank and shrank as she did from the black pool , and yet could find no refuge from it . She took out her money from her purse , and looked at it . She had still two - and - twenty shillings ; it would serve her for many days more , or it would help her to get on faster to Stonyshire , within reach of Dinah . The thought of Dinah urged itself more strongly now , since the experience of the night had driven her shuddering imagination away from the pool . If it had been only going to Dinah - if nobody besides Dinah would ever know - Hetty could have made up her mind to go to her . The soft voice , the pitying eyes , would have drawn her . But afterwards the other people must know , and she could no more rush on that shame than she could rush on death . She must wander on and on , and wait for a lower depth of despair to give her courage . Perhaps death would come to her , for she was getting less and less able to bear the day 's weariness . And yet - such is the strange action of our souls , drawing us by a lurking desire towards the very ends we dread - Hetty , when she set out again from Norton , asked the straightest road northwards towards Stonyshire , and kept it all that day . Poor wandering Hetty , with the rounded childish face and the hard , unloving , despairing soul looking out of it - with the narrow heart and narrow thoughts , no room in them for any sorrows but her own , and tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness ! My heart bleeds for her as I see her toiling along on her weary feet , or seated in a cart , with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road before her , never thinking or caring whither it tends , till hunger comes and makes her desire that a village may be near . What will be the end , the end of her objectless wandering , apart from all love , caring for human beings only through her pride , clinging to life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it ? God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such misery ! Chapter XXXVIII The Quest THE first ten days after Hetty 's departure passed as quietly as any other days with the family at the Hall Farm , and with Adam at his daily work . They had expected Hetty to stay away a week or ten days at least , perhaps a little longer if Dinah came back with her , because there might then be something to detain them at Snowfield . But when a fortnight had passed they began to feel a little surprise that Hetty did not return ; she must surely have found it pleasanter to be with Dinah than any one could have supposed . Adam , for his part , was getting very impatient to see her , and he resolved that , if she did not appear the next day Saturday , he would set out on Sunday morning to fetch her . There was no coach on a Sunday , but by setting out before it was light , and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way , he would arrive pretty early at Snowfield , and bring back Hetty the next day - Dinah too , if she were coming . It was quite time Hetty came home , and he would afford to lose his Monday for the sake of bringing her . His project was quite approved at the Farm when he went there on Saturday evening . Mrs. Poyser desired him emphatically not to come back without Hetty , for she had been quite too long away , considering the things she had to get ready by the middle of March , and a week was surely enough for any one to go out for their health . As for Dinah , Mrs. Poyser had small hope of their bringing her , unless they could make her believe the folks at Hayslope were twice as miserable as the folks at Snowfield . "
188701	188711	187764	187766	a mad woman	4090	" said Mrs. Poyser , by way of conclusion , "
188768	188769	188817	188817	Dinah	141	" "
188774	188792	188817	188817	Dinah	141	" said Mr. Poyser , who certainly had the air of a man perfectly heart - whole , "
188840	188975	188823	188823	she	141	" So at daybreak , on Sunday , Adam set off . Seth went with him the first mile or two , for the thought of Snowfield and the possibility that Dinah might come again made him restless , and the walk with Adam in the cold morning air , both in their best clothes , helped to give him a sense of Sunday calm . It was the last morning in February , with a low grey sky , and a slight hoar - frost on the green border of the road and on the black hedges . They heard the gurgling of the full brooklet hurrying down the hill , and the faint twittering of the early birds . For they walked in silence , though with a pleased sense of companionship . "
188982	189005	188823	188823	she	141	" said Adam , laying his hand on Seth 's shoulder and looking at him affectionately as they were about to part . "
189025	189026	189027	189027	I	0	" "
189037	189042	189033	189033	I	0	" said Seth cheerfully . "
189061	189615	189046	189048	an old bachelor	3234	" The'y turned away from each other , and Seth walked leisurely homeward , mentally repeating one of his favourite hymns - he was very fond of hymns : Dark and cheerless is the morn Unaccompanied by thee : Joyless is the day 's return Till thy mercy 's beams I see : Till thou inward light impart , Glad my eyes and warm my heart . Visit , then , this soul of mine , Pierce the gloom of sin and grief - Fill me , Radiancy Divine , Scatter all my unbelief . More and more thyself display , Shining to the perfect day . Adam walked much faster , and any one coming along the Oakbourne road at sunrise that morning must have had a pleasant sight in this tall broad - chested man , striding along with a carriage as upright and firm as any soldier 's , glancing with keen glad eyes at the dark - blue hills as they began to show themselves on his way . Seldom in Adam 's life had his face been so free from any cloud of anxiety as it was this morning ; and this freedom from care , as is usual with constructive practical minds like his , made him all the more observant of the objects round him and all the more ready to gather suggestions from them towards his own favourite plans and ingenious contrivances . His happy love - the knowledge that his steps were carrying him nearer and nearer to Hetty , who was so soon to be his - was to his thoughts what the sweet morning air was to his sensations : it gave him a consciousness of well - being that made activity delightful . Every now and then there was a rush of more intense feeling towards her , which chased away other images than Hetty ; and along with that would come a wondering thankfulness that all this happiness was given to him - that this life of ours had such sweetness in it . For Adam had a devout mind , though he was perhaps rather impatient of devout words , and his tenderness lay very close to his reverence , so that the one could hardly be stirred without the other . But after feeling had welled up and poured itself out in this way , busy thought would come back with the greater vigour ; and this morning it was intent on schemes by which the roads might be improved that were so imperfect all through the country , and on picturing all the benefits that might come from the exertions of a single country gentleman , if he would set himself to getting the roads made good in his own district . It seemed a very short walk , the ten miles to Oakbourne , that pretty town within sight of the blue hills , where he break - fasted . After this , the country grew barer and barer : no more rolling woods , no more wide - branching trees near frequent homesteads , no more bushy hedgerows , but greystone walls intersecting the meagre pastures , and dismal wide - scattered greystone houses on broken lands where mines had been and were no longer . "
189620	189626	189046	189048	an old bachelor	3234	" said Adam to himself . "
189715	189736	189688	189688	she	141	" And when at last he came in sight of Snowfield , he thought it looked like a town that was "
189742	189967	189688	189688	she	141	" though the stream through the valley where the great mill stood gave a pleasant greenness to the lower fields . The town lay , grim , stony , and unsheltered , up the side of a steep hill , and Adam did not go forward to it at present , for Seth had told him where to find Dinah . It was at a thatched cottage outside the town , a little way from the mill - an old cottage , standing sideways towards the road , with a little bit of potato - ground before it . Here Dinah lodged with an elderly couple ; and if she and Hetty happened to be out , Adam could learn where they were gone , or when they would be at home again . Dinah might be out on some preaching errand , and perhaps she would have left Hetty at home . Adam could not help hoping this , and as he recognized the cottage by the roadside before him , there shone out in his face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a near joy . He hurried his step along the narrow causeway , and rapped at the door . It was opened by a very clean old woman , with a slow palsied shake of the head . "
189974	189978	189969	189970	Dinah Morris	141	" said Adam . "
189983	190007	189969	189970	Dinah Morris	141	" said the old woman , looking up at this tall stranger with a wonder that made her slower of speech than usual . "
190015	190029	190009	190009	you	4112	" she added , retiring from the door , as if recollecting herself . "
190045	190046	190043	190043	ye	4112	" "
190049	190055	190043	190043	ye	4112	" said Adam , entering . "
190081	190082	190067	190067	He	128	" "
190127	190174	190119	190120	My man	8145	" Adam sat down patiently , not liking to hurry the shaking old woman with questions , but looking eagerly towards the narrow twisting stairs in one corner , for he thought it was possible Hetty might have heard his voice and would come down them . "
190184	190195	190176	190176	you	4112	" said the old woman , standing opposite to him . "
190210	190211	190198	190198	you	4112	" "
190214	190218	190198	190198	you	4112	" said Adam , "
190252	190264	190236	190239	the other young woman	4121	" The old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air . "
190271	190275	190236	190239	the other young woman	4121	" she said . "
190333	190456	190326	190326	You	4112	" she went on , opening a door and not noticing the effect of her words on Adam . He rose and followed her , and darted an eager glance into the little room with its narrow bed , the portrait of Wesley on the wall , and the few books lying on the large Bible . He had had an irrational hope that Hetty might be there . He could not speak in the first moment after seeing that the room was empty ; an undefined fear had seized him - something had happened to Hetty on the journey . Still the old woman was so slow of ; speech and apprehension , that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all . "
190465	190469	190461	190461	ye	4129	" she said . "
190484	190485	190471	190471	ye	4129	" "
190492	190498	190487	190487	Hetty	177	" said Adam , abruptly ; "
190503	190504	190501	190501	she	4131	" "
190512	190520	190505	190505	I	0	" said the old woman , wonderingly . "
190530	190531	190523	190523	anybody	492	" "
190555	190556	190552	190553	Dinah Morris	141	" "
190565	190566	190570	190570	you	4129	" "
190612	190613	190602	190602	You	4129	" "
190668	190703	190706	190708	a young woman	5337	" The old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adam 's face . But he was not stunned or confounded : he was thinking eagerly where he could inquire about Hetty . "
190747	190903	190738	190738	I	0	" He hastened out of the cottage , and the old woman followed him to the gate , watching him sadly with her shaking head as he almost ran towards the town . He was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne coach stopped . No ! No young woman like Hetty had been seen there . Had any accident happened to the coach a fortnight ago ? No . And there was no coach to take him back to Oakbourne that day . Well , he would walk : he could n't stay here , in wretched inaction . But the innkeeper , seeing that Adam was in great anxiety , and entering into this new incident with the eagerness of a man who passes a great deal of time with his hands in his pockets looking into an obstinately monotonous street , offered to take him back to Oakbourne in his own "
190906	191087	190738	190738	I	0	" this very evening . It was not five o'clock ; there was plenty of time for Adam to take a meal and yet to get to Oakbourne before ten o'clock . The innkeeper declared that he really wanted to go to Oakbourne , and might as well go to - night ; he should have all Monday before him then . Adam , after making an ineffectual attempt to eat , put the food in his pocket , and , drinking a draught of ale , declared himself ready to set off . As they approached the cottage , it occurred to him that he would do well to learn from the old woman where Dinah was to be found in Leeds : if there was trouble at the Hall Farm - he only half - admitted the foreboding that there would be - the Poysers might like to send for Dinah . But Dinah had not left any address , and the old woman , whose memory for names was infirm , could not recall the name of the "
191090	192363	190738	190738	I	0	" who was Dinah 's chief friend in the Society at Leeds . During that long , long journey in the taxed cart , there was time for all the conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope . In the very first shock of discovering that Hetty had not been to Snowfield , the thought of Arthur had darted through Adam like a sharp pang , but he tried for some time to ward off its return by busying himself with modes of accounting for the alarming fact , quite apart from that intolerable thought . Some accident had happened . Hetty had , by some strange chance , got into a wrong vehicle from Oakbourne : she had been taken ill , and did not want to frighten them by letting them know . But this frail fence of vague improbabilities was soon hurled down by a rush of distinct agonizing fears . Hetty had been deceiving herself in thinking that she could love and marry him : she had been loving Arthur all the while ; and now , in her desperation at the nearness of their marriage , she had run away . And she was gone to him . The old indignation and jealousy rose again , and prompted the suspicion that Arthur had been dealing falsely - had written to Hetty - had tempted her to come to him - being unwilling , after all , that she should belong to another man besides himself . Perhaps the whole thing had been contrived by him , and he had given her directions how to follow him to Ireland - for Adam knew that Arthur had been gone thither three weeks ago , having recently learnt it at the Chase . Every sad look of Hetty 's , since she had been engaged to Adam , returned upon him now with all the exaggeration of painful retrospect . He had been foolishly sanguine and confident . The poor thing had n't perhaps known her own mind for a long while ; had thought that she could forget Arthur ; had been momentarily drawn towards the man who offered her a protecting , faithful love . He could n't bear to blame her : she never meant to cause him this dreadful pain . The blame lay with that man who had selfishly played with her heart - had perhaps even deliberately lured her away . At Oakbourne , the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a young woman as Adam described getting out of the Treddleston coach more than a fortnight ago - was n't likely to forget such a pretty lass as that in a hurry - was sure she had not gone on by the Buxton coach that went through Snowfield , but had lost sight of her while he went away with the horses and had never set eyes on her again . Adam then went straight to the house from which the Stonition coach started : Stoniton was the most obvious place for Hetty to go to first , whatever might be her destination , for she would hardly venture on any but the chief coach - roads . She had been noticed here too , and was remembered to have sat on the box by the coachman ; but the coachman could not be seen , for another man had been driving on that road in his stead the last three or four days . He could probably be seen at Stoniton , through inquiry at the inn where the coach put up . So the anxious heart - stricken Adam must of necessity wait and try to rest till morning - nay , till eleven o'clock , when the coach started . At Stoniton another delay occurred , for the old coachman who had driven Hetty would not be in the town again till night . When he did come he remembered Hetty well , and remembered his own joke addressed to her , quoting it many times to Adam , and observing with equal frequency that he thought there was something more than common , because Hetty had not laughed when he joked her . But he declared , as the people had done at the inn , that he had lost sight of Hetty directly she got down . Part of the next morning was consumed in inquiries at every house in the town from which a coach started - all in vain , for you know Hetty did not start from Stonition by coach , but on foot in the grey morning - and then in walking out to the first toll - gates on the different lines of road , in the forlorn hope of finding some recollection of her there . No , she was not to be traced any farther ; and the next hard task for Adam was to go home and carry the wretched tidings to the Hall Farm . As to what he should do beyond that , he had come to two distinct resolutions amidst the tumult of thought and feeling which was going on within him while he went to and fro . He would not mention what he knew of Arthur Donnithorne 's behaviour to Hetty till there was a clear necessity for it : it was still possible Hetty might come back , and the disclosure might be an injury or an offence to her . And as soon as he had been home and done what was necessary there to prepare for his further absence , he would start off to Ireland : if he found no trace of Hetty on the road , he would go straight to Arthur Donnithorne and make himself certain how far he was acquainted with her movements . Several times the thought occurred to him that he would consult Mr. Irwine , but that would be useless unless he told him all , and so betrayed the secret about Arthur . It seems strange that Adam , in the incessant occupation of his mind about Hetty , should never have alighted on the probability that she had gone to Windsor , ignorant that Arthur was no longer there . Perhaps the reason was that he could not conceive Hetty 's throwing herself on Arthur uncalled ; he imagined no cause that could have driven her to such a step , after that letter written in August . There were but two alternatives in his mind : either Arthur had written to her again and enticed her away , or she had simply fled from her approaching marriage with himself because she found , after all , she could not love him well enough , and yet was afraid of her friends ' anger if she retracted . With this last determination on his mind , of going straight to Arthur , the thought that he had spent two days in inquiries which had proved to be almost useless , was torturing to Adam ; and yet , since he would not tell the Poysers his conviction as to where Hetty was gone , or his intention to follow her thither , he must be able to say to them that he had traced her as far as possible . It was after twelve o'clock on Tuesday night when Adam reached Treddleston ; and , unwilling to disturb his mother and Seth , and also to encounter their questions at that hour , he threw himself without undressing on a bed at the "
192367	192993	190738	190738	I	0	" and slept hard from pure weariness . Not more than four hours , however , for before five o'clock he set out on his way home in the faint morning twilight . He always kept a key of the workshop door in his pocket , so that he could let himself in ; and he wished to enter without awaking his mother , for he was anxious to avoid telling her the new trouble himself by seeing Seth first , and asking him to tell her when it should be necessary . He walked gently along the yard , and turned the key gently in the door ; but , as he expected , Gyp , who lay in the workshop , gave a sharp bark . It subsided when he saw Adam , holding up his finger at him to impose silence , and in his dumb , tailless joy he must content himself with rubbing his body against his master 's legs . Adam was too heart - sick to take notice of Gyp 's fondling . He threw himself on the bench and stared dully at the wood and the signs of work around him , wondering if he should ever come to feel pleasure in them again , while Gyp , dimly aware that there was something wrong with his master , laid his rough grey head on Adam 's knee and wrinkled his brows to look up at him . Hitherto , since Sunday afternoon , Adam had been constantly among strange people and in strange places , having no associations with the details of his daily life , and now that by the light of this new morning he was come back to his home and surrounded by the familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm , the reality - the hard , inevitable reality of his troubles pressed upon him with a new weight . Right before him was an unfinished chest of drawers , which he had been making in spare moments for Hetty 's use , when his home should be hers . Seth had not heard Adam 's entrance , but he had been roused by Gyp 's bark , and Adam heard him moving about in the room above , dressing himself . Seth 's first thoughts were about his brother : he would come home to - day , surely , for the business would be wanting him sadly by to - morrow , but it was pleasant to think he had had a longer holiday than he had expected . And would Dinah come too ? Seth felt that that was the greatest happiness he could look forward to for himself , though he had no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to marry him ; but he had often said to himself , it was better to be Dinah 's friend and brother than any other woman 's husband . If he could but be always near her , instead of living so far off ! He came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen into the workshop , intending to let out Gyp ; but he stood still in the doorway , smitten with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated listlessly on the bench , pale , unwashed , with sunken blank eyes , almost like a drunkard in the morning . But Seth felt in an instant what the marks meant - not drunkenness , but some great calamity . Adam looked up at him without speaking , and Seth moved forward towards the bench , himself trembling so that speech did not come readily . "
193002	193019	192994	192994	God	135	" he said , in a low voice , sitting down on the bench beside Adam , "
193024	193092	193000	193000	Addy	127	" Adam was unable to speak . The strong man , accustomed to suppress the signs of sorrow , had felt his heart swell like a child 's at this first approach of sympathy . He fell on Seth 's neck and sobbed . Seth was prepared for the worst now , for , even in his recollections of their boyhood , Adam had never sobbed before . "
193103	193122	193125	193125	lad	5286	" he asked , in a low tone , when Adam raised his head and was recovering himself . "
193179	193203	193174	193174	she	4145	" Seth was silent from utter astonishment : he knew nothing that could suggest to him a reason for Hetty 's going away . "
193214	193221	193222	193222	She	4145	" he said , at last . "
193246	193259	193230	193230	She	4145	" said Adam . He had determined to mention no further reason . "
193265	193269	193262	193262	Mother	185	" said Seth . "
193275	193276	193262	193262	Mother	185	" "
193282	193306	193262	193262	Mother	185	" said Adam , rising from the bench and pushing the hair from his face , as if he wanted to rouse himself . "
193375	193410	193367	193367	I	0	" Adam moved towards the door of the workshop , but after a step or two he turned round , and , meeting Seth 's eyes with a calm sad glance , he said , "
193448	193466	193467	193467	Brother	384	" Seth was pale and trembling : he felt there was some terrible secret under all this . "
193469	193479	193480	193480	Brother	3167	" he said , faintly - he never called Adam "
193481	193487	193488	193488	I	0	" except in solemn moments - "
193506	193507	193501	193501	God	135	" "
193512	193516	193501	193501	God	135	" said Adam , "
193535	193870	193522	193522	I	0	" The thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother , she would only distress him by words , half of blundering affection , half of irrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she had always foreseen , brought back some of his habitual firmness and self - command . He had felt ill on his journey home - he told her when she came down - had stayed all night at Tredddleston for that reason ; and a bad headache , that still hung about him this morning , accounted for his paleness and heavy eyes . He determined to go to the village , in the first place , attend to his business for an hour , and give notice to Burge of his being obliged to go on a journey , which he must beg him not to mention to any one ; for he wished to avoid going to the Hall Farm near breakfast - time , when the children and servants would be in the house - place , and there must be exclamations in their hearing about his having returned without Hetty . He waited until the clock struck nine before he left the work - yard at the village , and set off , through the fields , towards the Farm . It was an immense relief to him , as he came near the Home Close , to see Mr. Poyser advancing towards him , for this would spare him the pain of going to the house . Mr. Poyser was walking briskly this March morning , with a sense of spring business on his mind : he was going to cast the master 's eye on the shoeing of a new cart - horse , carrying his spud as a useful companion by the way . His surprise was great when he caught sight of Adam , but he was not a man given to presentiments of evil . "
193901	193902	193905	193905	I	0	" "
193911	193930	193905	193905	I	0	" said Adam , turning round , to indicate that he wished to walk back with Mr. Poyser . "
193933	193944	193945	193945	ye	127	" said Martin , looking with sharper attention at Adam , "
193954	193955	193905	193905	I	0	" "
193958	193964	193905	193905	I	0	" said Adam , heavily . "
193978	193992	193971	193971	I	0	" Mr. Poyser 's good - natured face showed signs of troubled astonishment . "
194003	194016	194018	194018	I	0	" he said , his thoughts flying at once to bodily accident . "
194060	194061	194044	194044	I	0	" "
194072	194098	194099	194099	She	177	" said Martin , standing still , so puzzled and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself felt as a trouble by him . "
194105	194109	194099	194099	She	177	" said Adam . "
194134	194192	194128	194128	She	177	" Martin was silent for a minute or two , looking on the ground and rooting up the grass with his spud , without knowing what he was doing . His usual slowness was always trebled when the subject of speech was painful . At last he looked up , right in Adam 's face , saying , "
194261	194283	194284	194284	I	0	" Adam could say nothing ; and Mr. Poyser , after pursuing his walk for a little while , went on , "
194331	194343	194325	194325	I	0	" - he added , shaking his head slowly and sadly - "
194373	194414	194358	194358	she	177	" Adam had the strongest motives for encouraging this supposition in Mr. Poyser , and he even tried to believe that it might possibly be true . He had no warrant for the certainty that she was gone to Arthur . "
194423	194433	194435	194435	she	177	" he said , as quietly as he could , "
194484	194485	194486	194486	I	0	" "
194497	194502	194492	194492	I	0	" said Martin decisively . "
194579	194580	194567	194567	She	141	" "
194623	194624	194621	194621	you	4168	" "
194638	194645	194625	194625	She	141	" said Mr. Poyser , indignantly , "
194656	194657	194658	194658	I	0	" "
194667	194671	194661	194661	you	0	" said Adam , "
194681	194682	194673	194673	I	0	" "
194710	194711	194673	194673	I	0	" "
194714	194718	194719	194719	I	0	" said Adam , "
194755	194756	194764	194765	soonest mended	4180	" "
194806	195125	195126	195126	I	0	" There was something in Martin Poyser 's throat at that moment which caused him to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion . Yet Adam knew what they meant all the better , and the two honest men grasped each other 's hard hands in mutual understanding . There was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off . He had told Seth to go to the Chase and leave a message for the squire , saying that Adam Bede had been obliged to start off suddenly on a journey - and to say as much , and no more , to any one else who made inquiries about him . If the Poysers learned that he was gone away again , Adam knew they would infer that he was gone in search of Hetty . He had intended to go right on his way from the Hall Farm , but now the impulse which had frequently visited him before - to go to Mr. Irwine , and make a confidant of him - recurred with the new force which belongs to a last opportunity . He was about to start on a long journey - a difficult one - by sea - and no soul would know where he was gone . If anything happened to him ? Or , if he absolutely needed help in any matter concerning Hetty ? Mr. Irwine was to be trusted ; and the feeling which made Adam shrink from telling anything which was her secret must give way before the need there was that she should have some one else besides himself who would be prepared to defend her in the worst extremity . Towards Arthur , even though he might have incurred no new guilt , Adam felt that he was not bound to keep silence when Hetty 's interest called on him to speak . "
195131	195167	195126	195126	I	0	" said Adam , when these thoughts , which had spread themselves through hours of his sad journeying , now rushed upon him in an instant , like a wave that had been slowly gathering ; "
195185	195551	195552	195552	I	0	" Chapter XXXIX The Tidings ADAM turned his face towards Broxton and walked with his swiftest stride , looking at his watch with the fear that Mr. Irwine might be gone out - hunting , perhaps . The fear and haste together produced a state of strong excitement before he reached the rectory gate , and outside it he saw the deep marks of a recent hoof on the gravel . But the hoofs were turned towards the gate , not away from it , and though there was a horse against the stable door , it was not Mr. Irwine 's : it had evidently had a journey this morning , and must belong to some one who had come on business . Mr. Irwine was at home , then ; but Adam could hardly find breath and calmness to tell Carroll that he wanted to speak to the rector . The double suffering of certain and uncertain sorrow had begun to shake the strong man . The butler looked at him wonderingly , as he threw himself on a bench in the passage and stared absently at the clock on the opposite wall . The master had somebody with him , he said , but he heard the study door open - the stranger seemed to be coming out , and as Adam was in a hurry , he would let the master know at once . Adam sat looking at the clock : the minute - hand was hurrying along the last five minutes to ten with a loud , hard , indifferent tick , and Adam watched the movement and listened to the sound as if he had had some reason for doing so . In our times of bitter suffering there are almost always these pauses , when our consciousness is benumbed to everything but some trivial perception or sensation . It is as if semi - idiocy came to give us rest from the memory and the dread which refuse to leave us in our sleep . Carroll , coming back , recalled Adam to the sense of his burden . He was to go into the study immediately . "
195564	195583	195584	195584	he	4183	" the butler added , from mere incontinence of remark , as he preceded Adam to the door , "
195605	195726	195601	195601	he	4183	" Adam took no notice of the words : he could not care about other people 's business . But when he entered the study and looked in Mr. Irwine 's face , he felt in an instant that there was a new expression in it , strangely different from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him before . A letter lay open on the table , and Mr. Irwine 's hand was on it , but the changed glance he cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to preoccupation with some disagreeable business , for he was looking eagerly towards the door , as if Adam 's entrance were a matter of poignant anxiety to him . "
195736	195758	195734	195734	Adam	127	" he said , in that low constrainedly quiet tone which a man uses when he is determined to suppress agitation . "
195763	195836	195837	195837	I	0	" He pointed to a chair just opposite to him , at no more than a yard 's distance from his own , and Adam sat down with a sense that this cold manner of Mr. Irwine 's gave an additional unexpected difficulty to his disclosure . But when Adam had made up his mind to a measure , he was not the man to renounce it for any but imperative reasons . "
195844	195848	195850	195851	the gentleman	4188	" he said , "
195910	195923	195905	195905	I	0	" Mr. Irwine nodded slowly , and Adam went on rather tremulously , "
195977	196006	196007	196007	She	177	" Mr. Irwine started up from his chair , as if involuntarily , but then , determined to control himself , walked to the window and looked out . "
196097	196109	196083	196083	I	0	" Mr. Irwine came back from the window and sat down . "
196122	196126	196111	196111	you	5336	" he said . "
196141	196145	196131	196131	she	177	" said Adam . "
196185	196265	196179	196180	somebody else	5847	" A gleam of something - it was almost like relief or joy - came across the eager anxiety of Mr. Irwine 's face at that moment . Adam was looking on the ground , and paused a little : the next words were hard to speak . But when he went on , he lifted up his head and looked straight at Mr. Irwine . He would do the thing he had resolved to do , without flinching . "
196279	196283	196272	196272	I	0	" he said , "
196313	196360	196363	196363	Adam	127	" Mr. Irwine , as if all self - control had forsaken him , grasped Adam 's arm , which lay on the table , and , clutching it tightly like a man in pain , said , with pale lips and a low hurried voice , "
196377	196425	196363	196363	Adam	127	" Adam , surprised at the violence of Mr. Irwine 's feeling , repented of the words that had passed his lips and sat in distressed silence . The grasp on his arm gradually relaxed , and Mr. Irwine threw himself back in his chair , saying , "
196434	196435	196436	196437	That man	8355	" "
196791	197051	197052	197052	Adam	127	" During Adam 's narrative , Mr. Irwine had had time to recover his self - mastery in spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon him . It was a bitter remembrance to him now - that morning when Arthur breakfasted with him and seemed as if he were on the verge of a confession . It was plain enough now what he had wanted to confess . And if their words had taken another turn ... if he himself had been less fastidious about intruding on another man 's secrets ... it was cruel to think how thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt and misery . He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination which the present sheds back upon the past . But every other feeling as it rushed upon his was thrown into abeyance by pity , deep respectful pity , for the man who sat before him - already so bruised , going forth with sad blind resignedness to an unreal sorrow , while a real one was close upon him , too far beyond the range of common trial for him ever to have feared it . His own agitation was quelled by a certain awe that comes over us in the presence of a great anguish , for the anguish he must inflict on Adam was already present to him . Again he put his hand on the arm that lay on the table , but very gently this time , as he said solemnly : "
197125	197157	197119	197119	God	135	" The two pale faces looked at each other ; in Adam 's there was trembling suspense , in Mr. Irwine 's hesitating , shrinking pity . But he went on . "
197182	197217	197174	197174	She	177	" Adam started up from his chair , as if he thought he could have leaped to her that moment . But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said , persuasively , "
197224	197230	197220	197220	Adam	127	" So he sat down . "
197263	197283	197220	197220	Adam	127	" Adam 's lips moved tremulously , but no sound came . They moved again , and he whispered , "
197287	197288	197220	197220	Adam	127	" "
197299	197332	197294	197294	she	177	" It was as if an insulting blow had brought back the spirit of resistance into Adam . The blood rushed to his face , and he said , loudly and sharply , "
197336	197337	197294	197294	she	177	" "
197349	197350	197294	197294	she	177	" "
197355	197393	197294	197294	she	177	" Adam almost shouted , starting up from his chair and making a stride towards the door ; but he turned round again , setting his back against the bookcase , and looking fiercely at Mr. Irwine . "
197415	197416	197417	197417	God	135	" "
197433	197434	197430	197430	she	177	" "
197442	197447	197430	197430	she	177	" said Adam violently . "
197452	197453	197430	197430	she	177	" "
197630	197631	197636	197636	they	4229	" "
197646	197664	197665	197665	I	0	" said Adam , still violently , with an effort that seemed to shake his whole frame . "
197685	197686	197707	197707	she	177	" "
197722	197796	197720	197720	Adam	127	" Adam took the letter between his shaking hands and tried to fix his eyes steadily on it . Mr. Irwine meanwhile went out to give some orders . When he came back , Adam 's eyes were still on the first page - he could n't read - he could not put the words together and make out what they meant . He threw it down at last and clenched his fist . "
197802	197806	197799	197799	HIS	4231	" he said ; "
197898	197949	197950	197950	I	0	" The image called up by these last words gave a new direction to poor Adam 's maddened feelings . He was silent , looking at the corner of the room as if he saw something there . Then he burst out again , in a tone of appealing anguish , "
197978	198106	198107	198107	She	177	" Mr. Irwine had sat down again in silence . He was too wise to utter soothing words at present , and indeed , the sight of Adam before him , with that look of sudden age which sometimes comes over a young face in moments of terrible emotion - the hard bloodless look of the skin , the deep lines about the quivering mouth , the furrows in the brow - the sight of this strong firm man shattered by the invisible stroke of sorrow , moved him so deeply that speech was not easy . Adam stood motionless , with his eyes vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or two ; in that short space he was living through all his love again . "
198115	198134	198107	198107	She	177	" he said , still without moving his eyes , as if he were only talking to himself : "
198182	198201	198202	198202	I	0	" He was silent again for a few moments , and then he said , with fierce abruptness , "
198278	198333	198272	198272	I	0	" In the act of going towards the door , Adam paused automatically and looked about for his hat , quite unconscious where he was or who was present with him . Mr. Irwine had followed him , and now took him by the arm , saying , in a quiet but decided tone , "
198452	198478	198432	198432	I	0	" While Mr. Irwine was speaking , Adam recovered his consciousness of the actual scene . He rubbed his hair off his forehead and listened . "
198481	198487	198432	198432	I	0	" Mr. Irwine went on , "
198566	198606	198607	198607	You	127	" In reality , Mr. Irwine proposed this journey to Stoniton for Adam 's own sake . Movement , with some object before him , was the best means of counteracting the violence of suffering in these first hours . "
198617	198628	198615	198615	Adam	127	" he said again , after a moment 's pause . "
198645	198646	198637	198637	Hetty	177	" "
198651	198655	198637	198637	Hetty	177	" said Adam , "
198673	198674	198677	198677	them	4250	" "
198719	198805	198808	198808	Dauphin	196	" Chapter XL The Bitter Waters Spread MR . IRWINE returned from Stoniton in a post - chaise that night , and the first words Carroll said to him , as he entered the house , were , that Squire Donnithorne was dead - found dead in his bed at ten o'clock that morning - and that Mrs. Irwine desired him to say she should be awake when Mr. Irwine came home , and she begged him not to go to bed without seeing her . "
198810	198822	198808	198808	Dauphin	196	" Mrs. Irwine said , as her son entered her room , "
198894	198895	198882	198882	I	0	" "
198903	198908	198898	198898	they	4253	" said Mr. Irwine . "

198976	199005	198966	198966	He	399	" Mr. Irwine could not help giving a slight groan : he was worn with anxiety and exertion , and his mother 's light words were almost intolerable . "
199042	199043	199046	199046	Mother	185	" "
199065	199066	199067	199067	You	404	" "

199138	199247	199253	199253	sir	5336	" Mr. Irwine gave up his intention of sending a letter to meet Arthur , since it would not now hasten his return : the news of his grandfather 's death would bring him as soon as he could possibly come . He could go to bed now and get some needful rest , before the time came for the morning 's heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm and to Adam 's home . Adam himself was not come back from Stoniton , for though he shrank from seeing Hetty , he could not bear to go to a distance from her again . "
199255	199262	199253	199253	sir	5336	" he said to the rector , "
199333	199415	199321	199321	I	0	" Adam had not been shaken in his belief that Hetty was innocent of the crime she was charged with , for Mr. Irwine , feeling that the belief in her guilt would be a crushing addition to Adam 's load , had kept from him the facts which left no hope in his own mind . There was not any reason for thrusting the whole burden on Adam at once , and Mr. Irwine , at parting , only said , "
199448	199449	199436	199436	Her	4262	" "
199468	199476	199456	199456	people	489	" said Adam , with bitter earnestness . "

199594	199599	199587	199587	your	127	" said Mr. Irwine , "
199629	200000	199613	199613	I	0	" Mr. Irwine felt it hard upon him that he should have to tell of Arthur 's sad part in the story of sin and sorrow - he who cared for Arthur with fatherly affection , who had cared for him with fatherly pride . But he saw clearly that the secret must be known before long , even apart from Adam 's determination , since it was scarcely to be supposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her obstinate silence . He made up his mind to withhold nothing from the Poysers , but to tell them the worst at once , for there was no time to rob the tidings of their suddenness . Hetty 's trial must come on at the Lent assizes , and they were to be held at Stoniton the next week . It was scarcely to be hoped that Martin Poyser could escape the pain of being called as a witness , and it was better he should know everything as long beforehand as possible . Before ten o'clock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall Farm was a house of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse than death . The sense of family dishonour was too keen even in the kind - hearted Martin Poyser the younger to leave room for any compassion towards Hetty . He and his father were simple - minded farmers , proud of their untarnished character , proud that they came of a family which had held up its head and paid its way as far back as its name was in the parish register ; and Hetty had brought disgrace on them all - disgrace that could never be wiped out . That was the all - conquering feeling in the mind both of father and son - the scorching sense of disgrace , which neutralised all other sensibility - and Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to observe that Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her husband . We are often startled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions ; the reason is , that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke of traditional impressions . "
200018	200040	200001	200001	I	0	" said Martin the younger when Mr. Irwine was gone , while the old grandfather was crying in the opposite chair , "

200883	200908	200854	200854	i	0	" Before Alick arrived with the message , Lisbeth 's thoughts too had already flown to Dinah , and she had said to Seth , "
201038	201039	201032	201032	Adam	127	" "
201054	201069	201052	201052	Dinah	141	" said Seth , as his mother sobbed and rocked herself to and fro . "
201073	201096	201071	201071	her	141	" said Lisbeth , looking up and pausing from her grief , like a crying child who hears some promise of consolation . "
201110	201111	201107	201107	they	4341	" "
201142	201143	201137	201137	thee	4340	" "

201312	201652	201304	201304	she	141	" Alick came now with the message , and Seth , finding that Mrs. Poyser was writing to Dinah , gave up the intention of writing himself ; but he went to the Hall Farm to tell them all he could suggest about the address of the letter , and warn them that there might be some delay in the delivery , from his not knowing an exact direction . On leaving Lisbeth , Mr. Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge , who had also a claim to be acquainted with what was likely to keep Adam away from business for some time ; and before six o'clock that evening there were few people in Broxton and Hayslope who had not heard the sad news . Mr. Irwine had not mentioned Arthur 's name to Burge , and yet the story of his conduct towards Hetty , with all the dark shadows cast upon it by its terrible consequences , was presently as well known as that his grandfather was dead , and that he was come into the estate . For Martin Poyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or two neighbours who ventured to come and shake him sorrowfully by the hand on the first day of his trouble ; and Carroll , who kept his ears open to all that passed at the rectory , had framed an inferential version of the story , and found early opportunities of communicating it . One of those neighbours who came to Martin Poyser and shook him by the hand without speaking for some minutes was Bartle Massey . He had shut up his school , and was on his way to the rectory , where he arrived about half - past seven in the evening , and , sending his duty to Mr. Irwine , begged pardon for troubling him at that hour , but had something particular on his mind . He was shown into the study , where Mr. Irwine soon joined him . "
201657	201692	201655	201655	Bartle	206	" said Mr. Irwine , putting out his hand . That was not his usual way of saluting the schoolmaster , but trouble makes us treat all who feel with us very much alike . "
201696	201697	201655	201655	Bartle	206	" "
201716	201720	201711	201711	sir	5336	" said Bartle . "

201940	201990	201991	201991	You	5336	" Bartle was heated by the exertion of walking fast in an agitated frame of mind , and was not able to check himself on this first occasion of venting his feelings . But he paused now to rub his moist forehead , and probably his moist eyes also . "
201998	202012	201991	201991	You	5336	" he said , when this pause had given him time to reflect , "
202073	202074	202058	202058	you	5336	" "
202085	202090	202083	202083	Bartle	206	" said Mr. Irwine . "

202525	202546	202516	202516	he	127	" Bartle added , taking out his spectacles and putting them on , as if they would assist his imagination . "
202558	202563	202549	202549	I	0	" said Mr. Irwine . "
202633	202734	202735	202735	I	0	" Mr. Irwine , who was involuntarily uttering his own thoughts rather than addressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence , had in his mind the possibility that the spirit of vengeance to - wards Arthur , which was the form Adam 's anguish was continually taking , might make him seek an encounter that was likely to end more fatally than the one in the Grove . This possibility heightened the anxiety with which he looked forward to Arthur 's arrival . But Bartle thought Mr. Irwine was referring to suicide , and his face wore a new alarm . "
202748	202752	202740	202740	I	0	" he said , "

203148	203181	203143	203143	I	0	" Bartle hurried away from the rectory , evading Carroll 's conversational advances , and saying in an exasperated tone to Vixen , whose short legs pattered beside him on the gravel , "
203274	203472	203474	203474	he	4410	" Chapter XLI The Eve of the Trial AN upper room in a dull Stoniton street , with two beds in it - one laid on the floor . It is ten o'clock on Thursday night , and the dark wall opposite the window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled with the light of the one dip candle by which Bartle Massey is pretending to read , while he is really looking over his spectacles at Adam Bede , seated near the dark window . You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told . His face has got thinner this last week : he has the sunken eyes , the neglected beard of a man just risen from a sick - bed . His heavy black hair hangs over his forehead , and there is no active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off , that he may be more awake to what is around him . He has one arm over the back of the chair , and he seems to be looking down at his clasped hands . He is roused by a knock at the door . "
203477	203513	203474	203474	he	4410	" said Bartle Massey , rising hastily and unfastening the door . It was Mr. Irwine . Adam rose from his chair with instinctive respect , as Mr. Irwine approached him and took his hand . "
203520	203535	203518	203518	Adam	127	" he said , sitting down on the chair which Bartle placed for him , "
203587	203614	203616	203616	you	0	" Adam took his chair again mechanically , and Bartle , for whom there was no chair remaining , sat on the bed in the background . "
203622	203627	203616	203616	you	0	" said Adam tremulously . "

203827	203856	203857	203857	I	0	" Adam 's head was hanging down again , and he did not speak . There was silence for a few minutes , and then Mr. Irwine said , "
203985	204050	203979	203979	She	4412	" Adam started up from his chair and seized his hat , which lay on the table . But he stood still then , and looked at Mr. Irwine , as if he had a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter . Bartle Massey rose quietly , turned the key in the door , and put it in his pocket . "
204056	204062	203979	203979	She	4412	" said Adam at last . "
204069	204076	203979	203979	She	4412	" said Mr. Irwine , quietly . "
204110	204111	204100	204100	you	127	" "
204120	204138	204112	204112	You	0	" said Adam , looking hard at Mr. Irwine and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion . "
204241	204242	204243	204243	I	0	" "
204251	204256	204249	204249	Adam	127	" said Mr. Irwine . "
204290	204291	204272	204272	I	0	" "
204300	204305	204293	204293	you	0	" said Adam indignantly . "
204332	204333	204334	204334	Adam	127	" "
204441	204442	204432	204432	you	127	" "
204450	204461	204432	204432	you	127	" Adam groaned out , sinking on his chair again ; "
204523	204556	204515	204515	she	4236	" Adam 's voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone , as if he were only talking to himself ; but now he said abruptly , looking at Mr. Irwine , "
204584	204585	204576	204576	She	4236	" "
204597	204603	204595	204595	Adam	127	" Mr. Irwine answered gently . "
204861	204862	204875	204875	I	0	" "
204868	204874	204875	204875	I	0	" said Adam , bitterly ; "
205073	205074	205101	205101	you	4447	" "
205341	205403	205323	205323	you	4447	" Adam was silent : the last words had called up a vivid image of the past , and Mr. Irwine left him to his thoughts , while he spoke to Bartle Massey about old Mr. Donnithorne 's funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind . But at length Adam turned round and said , in a more subdued tone , "
205423	205424	205425	205425	He	208	" "
205473	205474	205463	205463	he	208	" "
205492	205493	205484	205484	Seth	128	" "
205526	205538	205520	205520	they	4463	" Adam sat ruminating a little while , and then said , "
205632	205633	205630	205630	you	0	" "
205694	205695	205691	205691	his	4468	" "
205709	205714	205691	205691	his	4468	" said Adam sadly . "
205734	205739	205723	205723	I	0	" said Mr. Irwine , "
205782	206294	205775	205775	you	127	" Chapter XLII The Morning of the Trial AT one o'clock the next day , Adam was alone in his dull upper room ; his watch lay before him on the table , as if he were counting the long minutes . He had no knowledge of what was likely to be said by the witnesses on the trial , for he had shrunk from all the particulars connected with Hetty 's arrest and accusation . This brave active man , who would have hastened towards any danger or toil to rescue Hetty from an apprehended wrong or misfortune , felt himself powerless to contemplate irremediable evil and suffering . The susceptibility which would have been an impelling force where there was any possibility of action became helpless anguish when he was obliged to be passive , or else sought an active outlet in the thought of inflicting justice on Arthur . Energetic natures , strong for all strenuous deeds , will often rush away from a hopeless sufferer , as if they were hard - hearted . It is the overmastering sense of pain that drives them . They shrink by an ungovernable instinct , as they would shrink from laceration . Adam had brought himself to think of seeing Hetty , if she would consent to see him , because he thought the meeting might possibly be a good to her - might help to melt away this terrible hardness they told him of . If she saw he bore her no ill will for what she had done to him , she might open her heart to him . But this resolution had been an immense effort - he trembled at the thought of seeing her changed face , as a timid woman trembles at the thought of the surgeon 's knife , and he chose now to bear the long hours of suspense rather than encounter what seemed to him the more intolerable agony of witnessing her trial . Deep unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism , a regeneration , the initiation into a new state . The yearning memories , the bitter regret , the agonized sympathy , the struggling appeals to the Invisible Right - all the intense emotions which had filled the days and nights of the past week , and were compressing themselves again like an eager crowd into the hours of this single morning , made Adam look back on all the previous years as if they had been a dim sleepy existence , and he had only now awaked to full consciousness . It seemed to him as if he had always before thought it a light thing that men should suffer , as if all that he had himself endured and called sorrow before was only a moment 's stroke that had never left a bruise . Doubtless a great anguish may do the work of years , and we may come out from that baptism of fire with a soul full of new awe and new pity . "
206298	206318	206296	206296	God	135	" Adam groaned , as he leaned on the table and looked blankly at the face of the watch , "
206379	206441	206371	206371	Hetty	177	" Adam started and looked round towards the door . Vixen had begun to whimper , and there was a sound of a stick and a lame walk on the stairs . It was Bartle Massey come back . Could it be all over ? Bartle entered quietly , and , going up to Adam , grasped his hand and said , "
206466	206516	206455	206456	the folks	5360	" Adam 's heart beat so violently he was unable to speak - he could only return the pressure of his friend 's hand - and Bartle , drawing up the other chair , came and sat in front of him , taking off his hat and his spectacles . "
206527	206531	206455	206456	the folks	5360	" he observed , "
206552	206593	206544	206544	I	0	" The old man made this trivial remark , thinking it better not to respond at all to Adam 's agitation : he would gather , in an indirect way , that there was nothing decisive to communicate at present . "
206597	206604	206605	206605	I	0	" he said , rising again , "
206645	206665	206666	206666	I	0	" he went on , bringing forward the bottle and the loaf and pouring some wine into a cup , "
206689	206701	206707	206708	Mr. Massey	349	" Adam pushed the cup gently away and said , entreatingly , "
206724	206725	206721	206721	they	4483	" "
206901	206902	206921	206921	they	4483	" "
206913	206917	206921	206921	they	4483	" said Adam . "
206942	206943	206935	206935	they	4483	" "
207059	207087	207089	207089	me	0	" Bartle had made the right sort of appeal . Adam , with an air of quiet obedience , took up the cup and drank a little . "
207094	207099	207091	207091	SHE	4493	" he said presently . "
207388	207389	207390	207390	God	135	" "
207401	207418	207398	207399	Mr. Massey	349	" said Adam , in a low voice , laying his hand on Bartle 's arm . "
207547	207548	207525	207525	himself	173	" "
207561	207565	207568	207568	you	4513	" said Adam . "
207579	207580	207571	207572	Mr. Massey	349	" "
207709	207710	207707	207707	Adam	127	" "
207728	207732	207713	207713	nobody	543	" said Adam . "
207782	207783	207766	207766	They	4535	" "
207794	207822	207786	207787	one man	3071	" said Adam bitterly . Presently he drew himself up and looked fixedly out of the window , apparently turning over some new idea in his mind . "
207826	207839	207823	207824	Mr. Massey	349	" he said at last , pushing the hair off his forehead , "
207935	207966	207926	207927	Mr. Massey	349	" There was a decision in Adam 's manner which would have prevented Bartle from opposing him , even if he had wished to do so . He only said , "
208001	208700	207997	207997	you	349	" Nerved by an active resolution , Adam took a morsel of bread and drank some wine . He was haggard and unshaven , as he had been yesterday , but he stood upright again , and looked more like the Adam Bede of former days . Chapter XLIII The Verdict THE place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand old hall , now destroyed by fire . The midday light that fell on the close pavement of human heads was shed through a line of high pointed windows , variegated with the mellow tints of old painted glass . Grim dusty armour hung in high relief in front of the dark oaken gallery at the farther end , and under the broad arch of the great mullioned window opposite was spread a curtain of old tapestry , covered with dim melancholy figures , like a dozing indistinct dream of the past . It was a place that through the rest of the year was haunted with the shadowy memories of old kings and queens , unhappy , discrowned , imprisoned ; but to - day all those shadows had fled , and not a soul in the vast hall felt the presence of any but a living sorrow , which was quivering in warm hearts . But that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt hitherto , now when Adam Bede 's tall figure was suddenly seen being ushered to the side of the prisoner 's dock . In the broad sunlight of the great hall , among the sleek shaven faces of other men , the marks of suffering in his face were startling even to Mr. Irwine , who had last seen him in the dim light of his small room ; and the neighbours from Hayslope who were present , and who told Hetty Sorrel 's story by their firesides in their old age , never forgot to say how it moved them when Adam Bede , poor fellow , taller by the head than most of the people round him , came into court and took his place by her side . But Hetty did not see him . She was standing in the same position Bartle Massey had described , her hands crossed over each other and her eyes fixed on them . Adam had not dared to look at her in the first moments , but at last , when the attention of the court was withdrawn by the proceedings he turned his face towards her with a resolution not to shrink . Why did they say she was so changed ? In the corpse we love , it is the likeness we see - it is the likeness , which makes itself felt the more keenly because something else was and is not . There they were - the sweet face and neck , with the dark tendrils of hair , the long dark lashes , the rounded cheek and the pouting lips - pale and thin , yes , but like Hetty , and only Hetty . Others thought she looked as if some demon had cast a blighting glance upon her , withered up the woman 's soul in her , and left only a hard despairing obstinacy . But the mother 's yearning , that completest type of the life in another life which is the essence of real human love , feels the presence of the cherished child even in the debased , degraded man ; and to Adam , this pale , hard - looking culprit was the Hetty who had smiled at him in the garden under the apple - tree boughs - she was that Hetty 's corpse , which he had trembled to look at the first time , and then was unwilling to turn away his eyes from . But presently he heard something that compelled him to listen , and made the sense of sight less absorbing . A woman was in the witness - box , a middle - aged woman , who spoke in a firm distinct voice . She said , "
209062	209098	209123	209123	I	0	" The witness then stated that in the night a child was born , and she identified the baby - clothes then shown to her as those in which she had herself dressed the child . "
209655	209872	209643	209643	she	4583	" The effect of this evidence on Adam was electrical ; it gave him new force . Hetty could not be guilty of the crime - her heart must have clung to her baby - else why should she have taken it with her ? She might have left it behind . The little creature had died naturally , and then she had hidden it . Babies were so liable to death - and there might be the strongest suspicions without any proof of guilt . His mind was so occupied with imaginary arguments against such suspicions , that he could not listen to the cross - examination by Hetty 's counsel , who tried , without result , to elicit evidence that the prisoner had shown some movements of maternal affection towards the child . The whole time this witness was being examined , Hetty had stood as motionless as before : no word seemed to arrest her ear . But the sound of the next witness 's voice touched a chord that was still sensitive , she gave a start and a frightened look towards him , but immediately turned away her head and looked down at her hands as before . This witness was a man , a rough peasant . He said : "
210403	210437	210397	210399	a little baby	4603	" At these words a thrill ran through the court . Hetty was visibly trembling ; now , for the first time , she seemed to be listening to what a witness said . "
210733	211201	210721	210721	She	4493	" Adam had given a faint groan of despair while this witness was speaking . He had hidden his face on his arm , which rested on the boarding in front of him . It was the supreme moment of his suffering : Hetty was guilty ; and he was silently calling to God for help . He heard no more of the evidence , and was unconscious when the case for the prosecution had closed - unconscious that Mr. Irwine was in the witness - box , telling of Hetty 's unblemished character in her own parish and of the virtuous habits in which she had been brought up . This testimony could have no influence on the verdict , but it was given as part of that plea for mercy which her own counsel would have made if he had been allowed to speak for her - a favour not granted to criminals in those stern times . At last Adam lifted up his head , for there was a general movement round him . The judge had addressed the jury , and they were retiring . The decisive moment was not far off Adam felt a shuddering horror that would not let him look at Hetty , but she had long relapsed into her blank hard indifference . All eyes were strained to look at her , but she stood like a statue of dull despair . ' There was a mingled rustling , whispering , and low buzzing throughout the court during this interval . The desire to listen was suspended , and every one had some feeling or opinion to express in undertones . Adam sat looking blankly before him , but he did not see the objects that were right in front of his eyes - the counsel and attorneys talking with an air of cool business , and Mr. Irwine in low earnest conversation with the judge - did not see Mr. Irwine sit down again in agitation and shake his head mournfully when somebody whispered to him . The inward action was too intense for Adam to take in outward objects until some strong sensation roused him . It was not very long , hardly more than a quarter of an hour , before the knock which told that the jury had come to their decision fell as a signal for silence on every ear . It is sublime - that sudden pause of a great multitude which tells that one soul moves in them all . Deeper and deeper the silence seemed to become , like the deepening night , while the jurymen 's names were called over , and the prisoner was made to hold up her hand , and the jury were asked for their verdict . "
211204	211350	210721	210721	She	4493	" It was the verdict every one expected , but there was a sigh of disappointment from some hearts that it was followed by no recommendation to mercy . Still the sympathy of the court was not with the prisoner . The unnaturalness of her crime stood out the more harshly by the side of her hard immovability and obstinate silence . Even the verdict , to distant eyes , had not appeared to move her , but those who were near saw her trembling . The stillness was less intense until the judge put on his black cap , and the chaplain in his canonicals was observed behind him . Then it deepened again , before the crier had had time to command silence . If any sound were heard , it must have been the sound of beating hearts . The judge spoke , "
211354	211418	210721	210721	She	4493	" The blood rushed to Hetty 's face , and then fled back again as she looked up at the judge and kept her wide - open eyes fixed on him , as if fascinated by fear . Adam had not yet turned towards her , there was a deep horror , like a great gulf , between them . But at the words "
211432	211519	211520	211521	Poor Grandfather	4623	" a piercing shriek rang through the hall . It was Hetty 's shriek . Adam started to his feet and stretched out his arms towards her . But the arms could not reach her : she had fallen down in a fainting - fit , and was carried out of court . Chapter XLIV Arthur 's Return When Arthur Donnithorne landed at Liverpool and read the letter from his Aunt Lydia , briefly announcing his grand - father 's death , his first feeling was , "
211562	213495	213496	213497	Poor Grandfather	4623	" It is impossible to say that his grief was deeper than that . Pity and softened memory took place of the old antagonism , and in his busy thoughts about the future , as the chaise carried him rapidly along towards the home where he was now to be master , there was a continually recurring effort to remember anything by which he could show a regard for his grandfather 's wishes , without counteracting his own cherished aims for the good of the tenants and the estate . But it is not in human nature - only in human pretence - for a young man like Arthur , with a fine constitution and fine spirits , thinking well of himself , believing that others think well of him , and having a very ardent intention to give them more and more reason for that good opinion - it is not possible for such a young man , just coming into a splendid estate through the death of a very old man whom he was not fond of , to feel anything very different from exultant joy . Now his real life was beginning ; now he would have room and opportunity for action , and he would use them . He would show the Loamshire people what a fine country gentleman was ; he would not exchange that career for any other under the sun . He felt himself riding over the hills in the breezy autumn days , looking after favourite plans of drainage and enclosure ; then admired on sombre mornings as the best rider on the best horse in the hunt ; spoken well of on market - days as a first - rate landlord ; by and by making speeches at election dinners , and showing a wonderful knowledge of agriculture ; the patron of new ploughs and drills , the severe upbraider of negligent landowners , and withal a jolly fellow that everybody must like - happy faces greeting him everywhere on his own estate , and the neighbouring families on the best terms with him . The Irwines should dine with him every week , and have their own carriage to come in , for in some very delicate way that Arthur would devise , the lay - impropriator of the Hayslope tithes would insist on paying a couple of hundreds more to the vicar ; and his aunt should be as comfortable as possible , and go on living at the Chase , if she liked , in spite of her old - maidish ways - at least until he was married , and that event lay in the indistinct background , for Arthur had not yet seen the woman who would play the lady - wife to the first - rate country gentleman . These were Arthur 's chief thoughts , so far as a man 's thoughts through hours of travelling can be compressed into a few sentences , which are only like the list of names telling you what are the scenes in a long long panorama full of colour , of detail , and of life . The happy faces Arthur saw greeting him were not pale abstractions , but real ruddy faces , long familiar to him : Martin Poyser was there - the whole Poyser family . What - Hetty ? Yes ; for Arthur was at ease about Hetty - not quite at ease about the past , for a certain burning of the ears would come whenever he thought of the scenes with Adam last August , but at ease about her present lot . Mr. Irwine , who had been a regular correspondent , telling him all the news about the old places and people , had sent him word nearly three months ago that Adam Bede was not to marry Mary Burge , as he had thought , but pretty Hetty Sorrel . Martin Poyser and Adam himself had both told Mr. Irwine all about it - that Adam had been deeply in love with Hetty these two years , and that now it was agreed they were to be married in March . That stalwart rogue Adam was more susceptible than the rector had thought ; it was really quite an idyllic love affair ; and if it had not been too long to tell in a letter , he would have liked to describe to Arthur the blushing looks and the simple strong words with which the fine honest fellow told his secret . He knew Arthur would like to hear that Adam had this sort of happiness in prospect . Yes , indeed ! Arthur felt there was not air enough in the room to satisfy his renovated life , when he had read that passage in the letter . He threw up the windows , he rushed out of doors into the December air , and greeted every one who spoke to him with an eager gaiety , as if there had been news of a fresh Nelson victory . For the first time that day since he had come to Windsor , he was in true boyish spirits . The load that had been pressing upon him was gone , the haunting fear had vanished . He thought he could conquer his bitterness towards Adam now - could offer him his hand , and ask to be his friend again , in spite of that painful memory which would still make his ears burn . He had been knocked down , and he had been forced to tell a lie : such things make a scar , do what we will . But if Adam were the same again as in the old days , Arthur wished to be the same too , and to have Adam mixed up with his business and his future , as he had always desired before the accursed meeting in August . Nay , he would do a great deal more for Adam than he should otherwise have done , when he came into the estate ; Hetty 's husband had a special claim on him - Hetty herself should feel that any pain she had suffered through Arthur in the past was compensated to her a hundredfold . For really she could not have felt much , since she had so soon made up her mind to marry Adam . You perceive clearly what sort of picture Adam and Hetty made in the panorama of Arthur 's thoughts on his journey homeward . It was March now ; they were soon to be married : perhaps they were already married . And now it was actually in his power to do a great deal for them . Sweet - sweet little Hetty ! The little puss had n't cared for him half as much as he cared for her ; for he was a great fool about her still - was almost afraid of seeing her - indeed , had not cared much to look at any other woman since he parted from her . That little figure coming towards him in the Grove , those dark - fringed childish eyes , the lovely lips put up to kiss him - that picture had got no fainter with the lapse of months . And she would look just the same . It was impossible to think how he could meet her : he should certainly tremble . Strange , how long this sort of influence lasts , for he was certainly not in love with Hetty now . He had been earnestly desiring , for months , that she should marry Adam , and there was nothing that contributed more to his happiness in these moments than the thought of their marriage . It was the exaggerating effect of imagination that made his heart still beat a little more quickly at the thought of her . When he saw the little thing again as she really was , as Adam 's wife , at work quite prosaically in her new home , he should perhaps wonder at the possibility of his past feelings . Thank heaven it had turned out so well ! He should have plenty of affairs and interests to fill his life now , and not be in danger of playing the fool again . Pleasant the crack of the post - boy 's whip ! Pleasant the sense of being hurried along in swift ease through English scenes , so like those round his own home , only not quite so charming . Here was a market - town - very much like Treddleston - where the arms of the neighbouring lord of the manor were borne on the sign of the principal inn ; then mere fields and hedges , their vicinity to a market - town carrying an agreeable suggestion of high rent , till the land began to assume a trimmer look , the woods were more frequent , and at length a white or red mansion looked down from a moderate eminence , or allowed him to be aware of its parapet and chimneys among the dense - looking masses of oaks and elms - masses reddened now with early buds . And close at hand came the village : the small church , with its red - tiled roof , looking humble even among the faded half - timbered houses ; the old green gravestones with nettles round them ; nothing fresh and bright but the children , opening round eyes at the swift post - chaise ; nothing noisy and busy but the gaping curs of mysterious pedigree . What a much prettier village Hayslope was ! And it should not be neglected like this place : vigorous repairs should go on everywhere among farm - buildings and cottages , and travellers in post - chaises , coming along the Rosseter road , should do nothing but admire as they went . And Adam Bede should superintend all the repairs , for he had a share in Burge 's business now , and , if he liked , Arthur would put some money into the concern and buy the old man out in another year or two . That was an ugly fault in Arthur 's life , that affair last summer , but the future should make amends . Many men would have retained a feeling of vindictiveness towards Adam , but he would not - he would resolutely overcome all littleness of that kind , for he had certainly been very much in the wrong ; and though Adam had been harsh and violent , and had thrust on him a painful dilemma , the poor fellow was in love , and had real provocation . No , Arthur had not an evil feeling in his mind towards any human being : he was happy , and would make every one else happy that came within his reach . And here was dear old Hayslope at last , sleeping , on the hill , like a quiet old place as it was , in the late afternoon sunlight , and opposite to it the great shoulders of the Binton Hills , below them the purplish blackness of the hanging woods , and at last the pale front of the Abbey , looking out from among the oaks of the Chase , as if anxious for the heir 's return . "
213551	213893	213545	213545	she	414	" The wheels of Arthur 's chaise had been anxiously listened for at the Chase , for to - day was Friday , and the funeral had already been deferred two days . Before it drew up on the gravel of the courtyard , all the servants in the house were assembled to receive him with a grave , decent welcome , befitting a house of death . A month ago , perhaps , it would have been difficult for them to have maintained a suitable sadness in their faces , when Mr. Arthur was come to take possession ; but the hearts of the head - servants were heavy that day for another cause than the death of the old squire , and more than one of them was longing to be twenty miles away , as Mr. Craig was , knowing what was to become of Hetty Sorrel - pretty Hetty Sorrel - whom they used to see every week . They had the partisanship of household servants who like their places , and were not inclined to go the full length of the severe indignation felt against him by the farming tenants , but rather to make excuses for him ; nevertheless , the upper servants , who had been on terms of neighbourly intercourse with the Poysers for many years , could not help feeling that the longed - for event of the young squire 's coming into the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness . To Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked grave and sad : he himself was very much touched on seeing them all again , and feeling that he was in a new relation to them . It was that sort of pathetic emotion which has more pleasure than pain in it - which is perhaps one of the most delicious of all states to a good - natured man , conscious of the power to satisfy his good nature . His heart swelled agreeably as he said , "
213903	214049	213896	213896	Mills	368	" But now Mr. Bygate , the lawyer , who had been in the house ever since the death , came forward to give deferential greetings and answer all questions , and Arthur walked with him towards the library , where his Aunt Lydia was expecting him . Aunt Lydia was the only person in the house who knew nothing about Hetty . Her sorrow as a maiden daughter was unmixed with any other thoughts than those of anxiety about funeral arrangements and her own future lot ; and , after the manner of women , she mourned for the father who had made her life important , all the more because she had a secret sense that there was little mourning for him in other hearts . But Arthur kissed her tearful face more tenderly than he had ever done in his life before . "
214053	214064	213896	213896	Mills	368	" he said affectionately , as he held her hand , "
214094	214095	214074	214074	you	179	" "
214106	214136	214104	214104	Arthur	211	" poor Miss Lydia began , pouring out her little plaints , and Arthur sat down to listen with impatient patience . When a pause came , he said : "
214171	214172	214161	214161	I	0	" "
214186	214205	214184	214184	Mills	368	" he said to the butler , who seemed to be lingering uneasily about the entrance - hall . "
214232	214495	214502	214502	he	4635	" On entering the small anteroom which was called a dressing - room , but which Arthur really used only to lounge and write in , he just cast his eyes on the writing - table , and saw that there were several letters and packets lying there ; but he was in the uncomfortable dusty condition of a man who has had a long hurried journey , and he must really refresh himself by attending to his toilette a little , before he read his letters . Pym was there , making everything ready for him , and soon , with a delightful freshness about him , as if he were prepared to begin a new day , he went back into his dressing - room to open his letters . The level rays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the window , and as Arthur seated himself in his velvet chair with their pleasant warmth upon him , he was conscious of that quiet well - being which perhaps you and I have felt on a sunny afternoon when , in our brightest youth and health , life has opened a new vista for us , and long to - morrows of activity have stretched before us like a lovely plain which there was no need for hurrying to look at , because it was all our own . The top letter was placed with its address upwards : it was in Mr. Irwine 's handwriting , Arthur saw at once ; and below the address was written , "
214505	214580	214581	214581	I	0	" Nothing could have been less surprising to him than a letter from Mr. Irwine at that moment : of course , there was something he wished Arthur to know earlier than it was possible for them to see each other . At such a time as that it was quite natural that Irwine should have something pressing to say . Arthur broke the seal with an agreeable anticipation of soon seeing the writer . "
214637	214689	214629	214629	I	0	" I will not attempt to add by one word of reproach to the retribution that is now falling on you : any other words that I could write at this moment must be weak and unmeaning by the side of those in which I must tell you the simple fact . "
214710	214899	214901	214901	them	4637	" ... Arthur read no more . He started up from his chair and stood for a single minute with a sense of violent convulsion in his whole frame , as if the life were going out of him with horrible throbs ; but the next minute he had rushed out of the room , still clutching the letter - he was hurrying along the corridor , and down the stairs into the hall . Mills was still there , but Arthur did not see him , as he passed like a hunted man across the hall and out along the gravel . The butler hurried out after him as fast as his elderly limbs could run : he guessed , he knew , where the young squire was going . When Mills got to the stables , a horse was being saddled , and Arthur was forcing himself to read the remaining words of the letter . He thrust it into his pocket as the horse was led up to him , and at that moment caught sight of Mills ' anxious face in front of him . "
214910	215009	214902	214902	I	0	" he said in a muffled tone of agitation - sprang into the saddle , and set off at a gallop . Chapter XLV In the Prison NEAR sunset that evening an elderly gentleman was standing with his back against the smaller entrance - door of Stoniton jail , saying a few last words to the departing chaplain . The chaplain walked away , but the elderly gentleman stood still , looking down on the pavement and stroking his chin with a ruminating air , when he was roused by a sweet clear woman 's voice , saying , "
215021	215039	215018	215018	you	0	" He turned his head and looked fixedly at the speaker for a few moments without answering . "
215046	215052	215040	215040	I	0	" he said at last . "
215066	215067	215054	215054	you	0	" "
215085	215086	215075	215075	you	0	" "
215099	215100	215091	215091	you	0	" "
215140	215141	215132	215132	you	0	" "
215166	215167	215158	215158	you	0	" "
215234	215235	215238	215238	you	0	" "
215255	215256	215257	215257	I	0	" "
215299	215300	215286	215286	I	0	" "
215330	215331	215314	215314	She	4648	" "
215352	215353	215314	215314	She	4648	" "
215358	215369	215314	215314	She	4648	" said the elderly gentleman , ringing and gaining admission , "
215380	215485	215372	215372	you	0	" Dinah mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl as soon as they were within the prison court , from the habit she had of throwing them off when she preached or prayed , or visited the sick ; and when they entered the jailer 's room , she laid them down on a chair unthinkingly . There was no agitation visible in her , but a deep concentrated calmness , as if , even when she was speaking , her soul was in prayer reposing on an unseen support . After speaking to the jailer , the magistrate turned to her and said , "
215600	215601	215597	215597	he	5855	" "
215636	215637	215615	215615	you	5336	" "
215693	215694	215688	215688	I	0	" "
215705	215810	215703	215703	you	5336	" As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey , the solemn evening light seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day , and the sweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on this background of gloom . The turnkey looked askance at her all the while , but never spoke . He somehow felt that the sound of his own rude voice would be grating just then . He struck a light as they entered the dark corridor leading to the condemned cell , and then said in his most civil tone , "
215836	215837	215823	215823	I	0	" "
215845	215849	215843	215843	you	5336	" said Dinah . "
215857	215858	215850	215850	I	0	" "
215863	216005	216006	216006	Hetty	177	" said the jailer , turning the harsh key in the lock and opening the door wide enough to admit Dinah . A jet of light from his lantern fell on the opposite corner of the cell , where Hetty was sitting on her straw pallet with her face buried in her knees . It seemed as if she were asleep , and yet the grating of the lock would have been likely to waken her . The door closed again , and the only light in the cell was that of the evening sky , through the small high grating - enough to discern human faces by . Dinah stood still for a minute , hesitating to speak because Hetty might be asleep , and looking at the motionless heap with a yearning heart . Then she said , softly , "
216008	216054	216055	216055	Hetty	177	" There was a slight movement perceptible in Hetty 's frame - a start such as might have been produced by a feeble electrical shock - but she did not look up . Dinah spoke again , in a tone made stronger by irrepressible emotion , "
216061	216091	216092	216092	Hetty	177	" Again there was a slight startled movement through Hetty 's frame , and without uncovering her face , she raised her head a little , as if listening . "
216100	216159	216094	216094	Dinah	141	" After a moment 's pause , Hetty lifted her head slowly and timidly from her knees and raised her eyes . The two pale faces were looking at each other : one with a wild hard despair in it , the other full of sad yearning love . Dinah unconsciously opened her arms and stretched them out . "
216186	216212	216175	216175	you	177	" Hetty kept her eyes fixed on Dinah 's face - at first like an animal that gazes , and gazes , and keeps aloof . "
216241	216607	216608	216608	Hetty	177	" Slowly , while Dinah was speaking , Hetty rose , took a step forward , and was clasped in Dinah 's arms . They stood so a long while , for neither of them felt the impulse to move apart again . Hetty , without any distinct thought of it , hung on this something that was come to clasp her now , while she was sinking helpless in a dark gulf ; and Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign that her love was welcomed by the wretched lost one . The light got fainter as they stood , and when at last they sat down on the straw pallet together , their faces had become indistinct . Not a word was spoken . Dinah waited , hoping for a spontaneous word from Hetty , but she sat in the same dull despair , only clutching the hand that held hers and leaning her cheek against Dinah 's . It was the human contact she clung to , but she was not the less sinking into the dark gulf . Dinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat beside her . She thought suffering and fear might have driven the poor sinner out of her mind . But it was borne in upon her , as she afterwards said , that she must not hurry God 's work : we are overhasty to speak - as if God did not manifest himself by our silent feeling , and make his love felt through ours . She did not know how long they sat in that way , but it got darker and darker , till there was only a pale patch of light on the opposite wall : all the rest was darkness . But she felt the Divine presence more and more - nay , as if she herself were a part of it , and it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was willing the rescue of this helpless one . At last she was prompted to speak and find out how far Hetty was conscious of the present . "
216610	216615	216608	216608	Hetty	177	" she said gently , "
216628	216629	216617	216617	you	177	" "
216632	216637	216617	216617	you	177	" Hetty answered slowly , "
216642	216643	216640	216640	Dinah	141	" "
216679	216680	216663	216663	I	0	" "
216683	216696	216663	216663	I	0	" said Hetty . Then , after a pause , she added , "
216726	216742	216713	216713	They	4684	" As Hetty said the last words , she clung closer to Dinah , shuddering . "
216807	216808	216809	216809	You	177	" "
216824	216825	216817	216817	You	177	" "
216866	216875	216860	216864	some one close to you	4688	" Hetty said , in a frightened whisper , "
216878	216879	216860	216864	some one close to you	4688	" "
216993	216994	216991	216991	God	135	" "
217025	217026	217027	217027	My	0	" "
217145	217146	217121	217121	you	177	" "
217156	217164	217148	217148	I	0	" Hetty said , with sullen sadness . "
217495	217526	217527	217527	Hetty	177	" Hetty obeyed Dinah 's movement , and sank on her knees . They still held each other 's hands , and there was long silence . Then Dinah said , "
217544	217561	217562	217562	Dinah	141	" Still there was silence . At last Hetty spoke , in a tone of beseeching - "
217580	217597	217598	217598	Jesus	168	" Dinah held the clinging hand , and all her soul went forth in her voice : "
217762	217932	217933	217933	Saviour	169	" See , Lord , I bring her , as they of old brought the sick and helpless , and thou didst heal them . I bear her on my arms and carry her before thee . Fear and trembling have taken hold on her , but she trembles only at the pain and death of the body . Breathe upon her thy life - giving Spirit , and put a new fear within her - the fear of her sin . Make her dread to keep the accursed thing within her soul . Make her feel the presence of the living God , who beholds all the past , to whom the darkness is as noonday ; who is waiting now , at the eleventh hour , for her to turn to him , and confess her sin , and cry for mercy - now , before the night of death comes , and the moment of pardon is for ever fled , like yesterday that returneth not . "
218012	218140	217993	217993	thou	4711	" Yea , Lord , I see thee , coming through the darkness coming , like the morning , with healing on thy wings . The marks of thy agony are upon thee - I see , I see thou art able and willing to save - thou wilt not let her perish for ever . Come , mighty Saviour ! Let the dead hear thy voice . Let the eyes of the blind be opened . Let her see that God encompasses her . Let her tremble at nothing but at the sin that cuts her off from him . Melt the hard heart . Unseal the closed lips : make her cry with her whole soul , ' Father , I have sinned . ' ... "
218141	218144	218145	218145	Hetty	177	" Dinah , "
218157	218174	218150	218150	her	177	" I will speak ... I will tell ... I wo n't hide it any more . "
218240	218285	218237	218237	Hetty	177	" I did do it , Dinah ... I buried it in the wood ... the little baby ... and it cried ... I heard it cry ... ever such a way off ... all night ... and I went back because it cried . "
218300	218629	218630	218630	Hetty	177	" But I thought perhaps it would n't die - there might somebody find it . I did n't kill it - I did n't kill it myself . I put it down there and covered it up , and when I came back it was gone .... It was because I was so very miserable , Dinah ... I did n't know where to go ... and I tried to kill myself before , and I could n't . Oh , I tried so to drown myself in the pool , and I could n't . I went to Windsor - I ran away - did you know ? I went to find him , as he might take care of me ; and he was gone ; and then I did n't know what to do . I daredn't go back home again - I could n't bear it . I could n't have bore to look at anybody , for they 'd have scorned me . I thought o ' you sometimes , and thought I 'd come to you , for I did n't think you 'd be cross with me , and cry shame on me . I thought I could tell you . But then the other folks ' ud come to know it at last , and I could n't bear that . It was partly thinking o ' you made me come toward Stoniton ; and , besides , I was so frightened at going wandering about till I was a beggar - woman , and had nothing ; and sometimes it seemed as if I must go back to the farm sooner than that . Oh , it was so dreadful , Dinah ... I was so miserable ... I wished I 'd never been born into this world . I should never like to go into the green fields again - I hated 'em so in my misery . "
218649	219235	219236	219236	Hetty	177	" And then I got to Stoniton , and I began to feel frightened that night , because I was so near home . And then the little baby was born , when I did n't expect it ; and the thought came into my mind that I might get rid of it and go home again . The thought came all of a sudden , as I was lying in the bed , and it got stronger and stronger ... I longed so to go back again ... I could n't bear being so lonely and coming to beg for want . And it gave me strength and resolution to get up and dress myself . I felt I must do it ... I did n't know how ... I thought I 'd find a pool , if I could , like that other , in the corner of the field , in the dark . And when the woman went out , I felt as if I was strong enough to do anything ... I thought I should get rid of all my misery , and go back home , and never let 'em know why I ran away I put on my bonnet and shawl , and went out into the dark street , with the baby under my cloak ; and I walked fast till I got into a street a good way off , and there was a public , and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread . And I walked on and on , and I hardly felt the ground I trod on ; and it got lighter , for there came the moon - oh , Dinah , it frightened me when it first looked at me out o ' the clouds - it never looked so before ; and I turned out of the road into the fields , for I was afraid o ' meeting anybody with the moon shining on me . And I came to a haystack , where I thought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night . There was a place cut into it , where I could make me a bed , and I lay comfortable , and the baby was warm against me ; and I must have gone to sleep for a good while , for when I woke it was morning , but not very light , and the baby was crying . And I saw a wood a little way off ... I thought there 'd perhaps be a ditch or a pond there ... and it was so early I thought I could hide the child there , and get a long way off before folks was up . And then I thought I 'd go home - I 'd get rides in carts and go home and tell 'em I 'd been to try and see for a place , and could n't get one . I longed so for it , Dinah , I longed so to be safe at home . I do n't know how I felt about the baby . I seemed to hate it - it was like a heavy weight hanging round my neck ; and yet its crying went through me , and I daredn't look at its little hands and face . But I went on to the wood , and I walked about , but there was no water .... "
219258	219919	219248	219248	she	177	" I came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf , and I sat down on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do . And all of a sudden I saw a hole under the nut - tree , like a little grave . And it darted into me like lightning - I 'd lay the baby there and cover it with the grass and the chips . I could n't kill it any other way . And I 'd done it in a minute ; and , oh , it cried so , Dinah - I could n't cover it quite up - I thought perhaps somebody ' ud come and take care of it , and then it would n't die . And I made haste out of the wood , but I could hear it crying all the while ; and when I got out into the fields , it was as if I was held fast - I could n't go away , for all I wanted so to go . And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody ' ud come . I was very hungry , and I 'd only a bit of bread left , but I could n't go away . And after ever such a while - hours and hours - the man came - him in a smock - frock , and he looked at me so , I was frightened , and I made haste and went on . I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby . And I went right on , till I came to a village , a long way off from the wood , and I was very sick , and faint , and hungry . I got something to eat there , and bought a loaf . But I was frightened to stay . I heard the baby crying , and thought the other folks heard it too - and I went on . But I was so tired , and it was getting towards dark . And at last , by the roadside there was a barn - ever such a way off any house - like the barn in Abbot 's Close , and I thought I could go in there and hide myself among the hay and straw , and nobody ' ud be likely to come . I went in , and it was half full o ' trusses of straw , and there was some hay too . And I made myself a bed , ever so far behind , where nobody could find me ; and I was so tired and weak , I went to sleep .... But oh , the baby 's crying kept waking me , and I thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of me . But I must have slept a long while at last , though I did n't know , for when I got up and went out of the barn , I did n't know whether it was night or morning . But it was morning , for it kept getting lighter , and I turned back the way I 'd come . I could n't help it , Dinah ; it was the baby 's crying made me go - and yet I was frightened to death . I thought that man in the smock - frock ' ud see me and know I put the baby there . But I went on , for all that . I 'd left off thinking about going home - it had gone out o ' my mind . I saw nothing but that place in the wood where I 'd buried the baby ... I see it now . Oh Dinah ! shall I allays see it ? "
219937	220150	219933	219933	she	177	" I met nobody , for it was very early , and I got into the wood .... I knew the way to the place ... the place against the nut - tree ; and I could hear it crying at every step .... I thought it was alive .... I do n't know whether I was frightened or glad ... I do n't know what I felt . I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry . I do n't know what I felt till I saw the baby was gone . And when I 'd put it there , I thought I should like somebody to find it and save it from dying ; but when I saw it was gone , I was struck like a stone , with fear . I never thought o ' stirring , I felt so weak . I knew I could n't run away , and everybody as saw me ' ud know about the baby . My heart went like a stone . I could n't wish or try for anything ; it seemed like as if I should stay there for ever , and nothing ' ud ever change . But they came and took me away . "
220195	220220	220187	220187	Hetty	177	" Dinah , do you think God will take away that crying and the place in the wood , now I 've told everything ? "
220221	220246	220187	220187	Hetty	177	" Let us pray , poor sinner . Let us fall on our knees again , and pray to the God of all mercy . "
220286	220298	220269	220270	Bartle Massey	206	" Adam , here 's a visitor wants to see you . "
220352	220358	220359	220359	he	206	" Is it any news ? "
220362	220370	220372	220372	Bartle	206	" Keep yourself quiet , my lad , "
220374	220469	220470	220470	Bartle	206	" keep quiet . It 's not what you 're thinking of . It 's the young Methodist woman come from the prison . She 's at the bottom o ' the stairs , and wants to know if you think well to see her , for she has something to say to you about that poor castaway ; but she would n't come in without your leave , she said . She thought you 'd perhaps like to go out and speak to her . These preaching women are not so back'ard commonly , "
220475	220482	220484	220484	Adam	127	" Ask her to come in , "
220554	220568	220545	220545	she	141	" Be comforted , Adam Bede , the Lord has not forsaken her . "
220569	220577	220578	220578	Adam	127	" Bless you for coming to her , "
220581	220593	220578	220578	Adam	127	" Mr. Massey brought me word yesterday as you was come . "
220643	220653	220635	220635	he	206	" Sit down , young woman , sit down , "
220669	220681	220683	220683	Dinah	141	" Thank you , friend ; I wo n't sit down , "
220685	220758	220683	220683	Dinah	141	" for I must hasten back . She entreated me not to stay long away . What I came for , Adam Bede , was to pray you to go and see the poor sinner and bid her farewell . She desires to ask your forgiveness , and it is meet you should see her to - day , rather than in the early morning , when the time will be short . "
220773	220779	220780	220780	he	127	" It wo n't be , "
220783	220815	220780	220780	he	127	" it 'll be put off - there 'll perhaps come a pardon . Mr. Irwine said there was hope . He said , I need n't quite give it up . "
220816	220825	220827	220827	Dinah	141	" That 's a blessed thought to me , "
220835	220848	220827	220827	Dinah	141	" It 's a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast . "
220849	220856	220857	220857	she	141	" But let what will be , "
220861	221034	220857	220857	she	141	" You will surely come , and let her speak the words that are in her heart . Although her poor soul is very dark and discerns little beyond the things of the flesh , she is no longer hard . She is contrite , she has confessed all to me . The pride of her heart has given way , and she leans on me for help and desires to be taught . This fills me with trust , for I can not but think that the brethren sometimes err in measuring the Divine love by the sinner 's knowledge . She is going to write a letter to the friends at the Hall Farm for me to give them when she is gone , and when I told her you were here , she said , ' I should like to say good - bye to Adam and ask him to forgive me . ' You will come , Adam ? Perhaps you will even now come back with me . "
221035	221040	221041	221041	Adam	127	" I ca n't , "
221044	221096	221097	221097	He	127	" I ca n't say good - bye while there 's any hope . I 'm listening , and listening - I ca n't think o ' nothing but that . It ca n't be as she 'll die that shameful death - I ca n't bring my mind to it . "
221130	221181	221124	221124	he	127	" I will come , Dinah ... to - morrow morning ... if it must be . I may have more strength to bear it , if I know it must be . Tell her , I forgive her ; tell her I will come - at the very last . "
221182	221196	221198	221198	Dinah	141	" I will not urge you against the voice of your own heart , "
221200	221266	221198	221198	Dinah	141	" I must hasten back to her , for it is wonderful how she clings now , and was not willing to let me out of her sight . She used never to make any return to my affection before , but now tribulation has opened her heart . Farewell , Adam . Our heavenly Father comfort you and strengthen you to bear all things . "
221308	221313	221303	221303	she	141	" Farewell , friend , "
221326	221329	221331	221331	Bartle	206	" Well , "
221344	221402	221331	221331	Bartle	206	" if there must be women to make trouble in the world , it 's but fair there should be women to be comforters under it ; and she 's one - she 's one . It 's a pity she 's a Methodist ; but there 's no getting a woman without some foolishness or other . "
221456	221466	221467	221467	Bartle	206	" What does it matter to me , lad ? "
221470	221502	221467	221467	Bartle	206	" a night 's sleep more or less ? I shall sleep long enough , by and by , underground . Let me keep thee company in trouble while I can . "
221584	221667	221576	221576	he	127	" If I could ha ' done anything to save her - if my bearing anything would ha ' done any good ... but t ' have to sit still , and know it , and do nothing ... it 's hard for a man to bear ... and to think o ' what might ha ' been now , if it had n't been for HIM .... O God , it 's the very day we should ha ' been married . "
221668	221674	221676	221676	Bartle	206	" Aye , my lad , "
221679	221736	221676	221676	Bartle	206	" it 's heavy - it 's heavy . But you must remember this : when you thought of marrying her , you 'd a notion she 'd got another sort of a nature inside her . You did n't think she could have got hardened in that little while to do what she 's done . "
221737	221745	221747	221747	Adam	127	" I know - I know that , "
221749	221842	221747	221747	Adam	127	" I thought she was loving and tender - hearted , and would n't tell a lie , or act deceitful . How could I think any other way ? And if he 'd never come near her , and I 'd married her , and been loving to her , and took care of her , she might never ha ' done anything bad . What would it ha ' signified - my having a bit o ' trouble with her ? It ' ud ha ' been nothing to this . "
221843	221916	221576	221576	he	127	" There 's no knowing , my lad - there 's no knowing what might have come . The smart 's bad for you to bear now : you must have time - you must have time . But I 've that opinion of you , that you 'll rise above it all and be a man again , and there may good come out of this that we do n't see . "
221917	221924	221926	221926	Adam	127	" Good come out of it ! "
221929	222024	221926	221926	Adam	127	" That does n't alter th ' evil : HER ruin ca n't be undone . I hate that talk o ' people , as if there was a way o ' making amends for everything . They 'd more need be brought to see as the wrong they do can never be altered . When a man 's spoiled his fellow - creatur 's life , he 's no right to comfort himself with thinking good may come out of it . Somebody else 's good does n't alter her shame and misery . "
222025	222032	222034	222034	Bartle	206	" Well , lad , well , "
222053	222094	222045	222045	his	206	" it 's likely enough I talk foolishness . I 'm an old fellow , and it 's a good many years since I was in trouble myself . It 's easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient . "
222095	222099	222101	222101	Adam	127	" Mr. Massey , "
222104	222128	222101	222101	Adam	127	" I 'm very hot and hasty . I owe you something different ; but you must n't take it ill of me . "
222129	222137	222045	222045	his	206	" Not I , lad - not I. "
222173	222185	222187	222187	Adam	127	" Let us go to the prison now , Mr. Massey , "
222200	222214	222187	222187	Adam	127	" If there 's any news come , we shall hear about it . "
222326	222339	222318	222318	he	127	" The cart is to set off at half - past seven . "
222724	222731	222732	222732	Dinah	141	" Speak to him , Hetty , "
222735	222744	222732	222732	Dinah	141	" tell him what is in your heart . "
222754	222777	222778	222778	Adam	127	" Adam ... I'm very sorry ... I behaved very wrong to you ... will you forgive me ... before I die ? "
222786	222800	222778	222778	Adam	127	" Yes , I forgive thee Hetty . I forgave thee long ago . "
222928	222945	222919	222919	she	177	" Will you kiss me again , Adam , for all I 've been so wicked ? "
222972	222977	222978	222978	Hetty	177	" And tell him , "
222987	223040	222978	222978	Hetty	177	" tell him ... for there 's nobody else to tell him ... as I went after him and could n't find him ... and I hated him and cursed him once ... but Dinah says I should forgive him ... and I try ... for else God wo n't forgive me . "
223269	223276	223277	223277	Dinah	141	" Close your eyes , Hetty , "
223280	223290	223277	223277	Dinah	141	" and let us pray without ceasing to God . "
223769	223779	223780	223780	he	127	" Seth and me are sure to find work , "
223783	223934	223780	223780	he	127	" A man that 's got our trade at his finger - ends is at home everywhere ; and we must make a new start . My mother wo n't stand in the way , for she 's told me , since I came home , she 'd made up her mind to being buried in another parish , if I wished it , and if I 'd be more comfortable elsewhere . It 's wonderful how quiet she 's been ever since I came back . It seems as if the very greatness o ' the trouble had quieted and calmed her . We shall all be better in a new country , though there 's some I shall be loath to leave behind . But I wo n't part from you and yours , if I can help it , Mr. Poyser . Trouble 's made us kin . "
223935	223940	223942	223942	Martin	215	" Aye , lad , "
223944	224014	223942	223942	Martin	215	" We 'll go out o ' hearing o ' that man 's name . But I doubt we shall ne'er go far enough for folks not to find out as we 've got them belonging to us as are transported o'er the seas , and were like to be hanged . We shall have that flyin ' up in our faces , and our children 's after us . "
224053	224059	224060	224060	he	127	" But to - morrow , "
224065	224096	224060	224060	he	127	" I 'll go to work again . I shall learn to like it again some time , maybe ; and it 's right whether I like it or not . "
224261	224277	224278	224278	he	127	" I 'll go and see it again to - night for the last time , "
224281	224332	224278	224278	he	127	" it 'll do me good ; it 'll make me feel over again what I felt when I 'd knocked him down . I felt what poor empty work it was , as soon as I 'd done it , before I began to think he might be dead . "
224788	224791	224792	224792	he	211	" Adam , "
224797	224828	224829	224829	He	211	" it may be a good thing that we have met here , for I wished to see you . I should have asked to see you to - morrow . "
224837	224849	224833	224833	Adam	127	" I know it is painful to you to meet me , "
224854	224868	224850	224850	Arthur	211	" but it is not likely to happen again for years to come . "
224869	224874	224876	224876	Adam	127	" No , sir , "
224880	224917	224876	224876	Adam	127	" that was what I meant to write to you to - morrow , as it would be better all dealings should be at an end between us , and somebody else put in my place . "
224936	225045	224932	224932	he	211	" It was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you . I do n't want to lessen your indignation against me , or ask you to do anything for my sake . I only wish to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil consequences of the past , which is unchangeable . I do n't mean consequences to myself , but to others . It is but little I can do , I know . I know the worst consequences will remain ; but something may be done , and you can help me . Will you listen to me patiently ? "
225046	225051	225053	225053	Adam	127	" Yes , sir , "
225059	225095	225053	225053	Adam	127	" I 'll hear what it is . If I can help to mend anything , I will . Anger ' ull mend nothing , I know . We 've had enough o ' that . "
225096	225104	225106	225106	Arthur	211	" I was going to the Hermitage , "
225108	225125	225106	225106	Arthur	211	" Will you go there with me and sit down ? We can talk better there . "
225245	225260	225242	225242	Arthur	211	" I 'm going away , Adam ; I 'm going into the army . "
225300	225309	225310	225310	Arthur	211	" What I want to say to you , "
225313	225370	225310	225310	Arthur	211	" is this : one of my reasons for going away is that no one else may leave Hayslope - may leave their home on my account . I would do anything , there is no sacrifice I would not make , to prevent any further injury to others through my - through what has happened . "
225476	225527	225473	225473	he	127	" The time 's past for that , sir . A man should make sacrifices to keep clear of doing a wrong ; sacrifices wo n't undo it when it 's done . When people 's feelings have got a deadly wound , they ca n't be cured with favours . "
225528	225531	225533	225533	Arthur	211	" Favours ! "
225537	225625	225533	225533	Arthur	211	" no ; how can you suppose I meant that ? But the Poysers - Mr. Irwine tells me the Poysers mean to leave the place where they have lived so many years - for generations . Do n't you see , as Mr. Irwine does , that if they could be persuaded to overcome the feeling that drives them away , it would be much better for them in the end to remain on the old spot , among the friends and neighbours who know them ? "
225626	225631	225633	225633	Adam	127	" That 's true , "
225636	225736	225633	225633	Adam	127	" But then , sir , folks 's feelings are not so easily overcome . It 'll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to a strange place , among strange faces , when he 's been bred up on the Hall Farm , and his father before him ; but then it ' ud be harder for a man with his feelings to stay . I do n't see how the thing 's to be made any other than hard . There 's a sort o ' damage , sir , that ca n't be made up for . "
225908	225943	225905	225905	he	211	" But people may make injuries worse by unreasonable conduct - by giving way to anger and satisfying that for the moment , instead of thinking what will be the effect in the future . "
225956	225966	225954	225954	landlord	5334	" he added presently , with still more eagerness - "
226145	226156	226157	226157	You	127	" Arthur paused a moment and then added , pleadingly , "
226222	226294	226216	226216	He	173	" Adam could not help being moved : it was impossible for him not to feel that this was the voice of the honest warm - hearted Arthur whom he had loved and been proud of in old days ; but nearer memories would not be thrust away . He was silent ; yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that induced him to go on , with growing earnestness . "
226449	226470	226471	226471	I	0	" Arthur was silent again for a little while , and then said , with some agitation in his voice , "
226504	226523	226493	226493	I	0	" Adam made a hasty movement on his chair and looked on the ground . Arthur went on , "
226567	226601	226553	226553	You	127	" Arthur rose from his seat with the last words , and went to one of the windows , looking out and turning his back on Adam , as he continued , passionately , "
226649	226718	226636	226636	you	127	" There was silence for several minutes , for the struggle in Adam 's mind was not easily decided . Facile natures , whose emotions have little permanence , can hardly understand how much inward resistance he overcame before he rose from his seat and turned towards Arthur . Arthur heard the movement , and turning round , met the sad but softened look with which Adam said , "
226880	226914	226915	226915	I	0	" Adam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man who is resolved to leave nothing unsaid that he is bound to say ; but he went on with more hesitation . "
226947	226983	226984	226984	Adam	127	" Arthur 's white hand was in Adam 's large grasp in an instant , and with that action there was a strong rush , on both sides , of the old , boyish affection . "
226986	226996	226984	226984	Adam	127	" Arthur said , impelled to full confession now , "
227126	227141	227115	227115	I	0	" They sat down again opposite each other , and Adam said , tremulously , "
227153	227154	227147	227147	you	4819	" "
227162	227166	227160	227160	Adam	127	" Arthur said ; "
227239	227240	227243	227243	sir	5336	" "
227245	227263	227243	227243	sir	5336	" said Adam , for the first time feeling his own pain merged in sympathy for Arthur , "
227302	227303	227295	227295	I	0	" "
227315	227420	227307	227309	that sweet woman	4829	" Arthur said , pursuing his own thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adam 's words , ' she says she shall stay with her to the very last moment - till she goes ; and the poor thing clings to her as if she found some comfort in her . I could worship that woman ; I do n't know what I should do if she were not there . Adam , you will see her when she comes back . I could say nothing to her yesterday - nothing of what I felt towards her . Tell her , "
227448	227520	227440	227440	he	211	" tell her I asked you to give her this in remembrance of me - of the man to whom she is the one source of comfort , when he thinks of ... I know she does n't care about such things - or anything else I can give her for its own sake . But she will use the watch - I shall like to think of her using it . "
227521	227531	227532	227532	Adam	127	" I 'll give it to her , sir , "
227535	227557	227532	227532	Adam	127	" and tell her your words . She told me she should come back to the people at the Hall Farm . "
227558	227570	227572	227572	Arthur	211	" And you will persuade the Poysers to stay , Adam ? "
227592	227613	227572	227572	Arthur	211	" You will stay yourself , and help Mr. Irwine to carry out the repairs and improvements on the estate ? "
227614	227631	227633	227633	Adam	127	" There 's one thing , sir , that perhaps you do n't take account of , "
227639	227740	227633	227633	Adam	127	" and that was what made me hang back longer . You see , it 's the same with both me and the Poysers : if we stay , it 's for our own worldly interest , and it looks as if we 'd put up with anything for the sake o ' that . I know that 's what they 'll feel , and I ca n't help feeling a little of it myself . When folks have got an honourable independent spirit , they do n't like to do anything that might make 'em seem base - minded . "
227741	227818	227572	227572	Arthur	211	" But no one who knows you will think that , Adam . That is not a reason strong enough against a course that is really more generous , more unselfish than the other . And it will be known - it shall be made known , that both you and the Poysers stayed at my entreaty . Adam , do n't try to make things worse for me ; I 'm punished enough without that . "
227819	227826	227827	227827	Adam	127	" No , sir , no , "
227837	227918	227827	227827	Adam	127	" God forbid I should make things worse for you . I used to wish I could do it , in my passion - but that was when I thought you did n't feel enough . I 'll stay , sir , I 'll do the best I can . It 's all I 've got to think of now - to do my work well and make the world a bit better place for them as can enjoy it . "
227919	227944	227572	227572	Arthur	211	" Then we 'll part now , Adam . You will see Mr. Irwine to - morrow , and consult with him about everything . "
227945	227953	227955	227955	Adam	127	" Are you going soon , sir ? "
227957	227988	227955	227955	Adam	127	" As soon as possible - after I 've made the necessary arrangements . Good - bye , Adam . I shall think of you going about the old place . "
227989	228000	227572	227572	Arthur	211	" Good - bye , sir . God bless you . "
228355	228358	228341	228341	Totty	242	" Baby , "
228481	228492	228493	228494	Mrs. Poyser	228	" I never saw the like to you , Dinah , "
228498	228639	228493	228494	Mrs. Poyser	228	" when you 've once took anything into your head : there 's no more moving you than the rooted tree . You may say what you like , but I do n't believe that 's religion ; for what 's the Sermon on the Mount about , as you 're so fond o ' reading to the boys , but doing what other folks ' ud have you do ? But if it was anything unreasonable they wanted you to do , like taking your cloak off and giving it to 'em , or letting 'em slap you i ' the face , I daresay you 'd be ready enough . It 's only when one ' ud have you do what 's plain common sense and good for yourself , as you 're obstinate th ' other way . "
228640	228646	228648	228648	Dinah	141	" Nay , dear Aunt , "
228660	228687	228653	228653	she	141	" I 'm sure your wish ' ud be a reason for me to do anything that I did n't feel it was wrong to do . "
228688	228964	228493	228494	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Wrong ! You drive me past bearing . What is there wrong , I should like to know , i ' staying along wi ' your own friends , as are th ' happier for having you with 'em an ' are willing to provide for you , even if your work did n't more nor pay 'em for the bit o ' sparrow 's victual y ' eat and the bit o ' rag you put on ? An ' who is it , I should like to know , as you 're bound t ' help and comfort i ' the world more nor your own flesh and blood - an ' me th ' only aunt you 've got above - ground , an ' am brought to the brink o ' the grave welly every winter as comes , an ' there 's the child as sits beside you ' ull break her little heart when you go , an ' the grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth , an ' your uncle ' ull miss you so as never was - a - lighting his pipe an ' waiting on him , an ' now I can trust you wi ' the butter , an ' have had all the trouble o ' teaching you , and there 's all the sewing to be done , an ' I must have a strange gell out o ' Treddles'on to do it - an ' all because you must go back to that bare heap o ' stones as the very crows fly over an ' wo n't stop at . "
228965	228970	228972	228972	Dinah	141	" Dear Aunt Rachel , "
228982	229133	228972	228972	Dinah	141	" it 's your kindness makes you say I 'm useful to you . You do n't really want me now , for Nancy and Molly are clever at their work , and you 're in good health now , by the blessing of God , and my uncle is of a cheerful countenance again , and you have neighbours and friends not a few - some of them come to sit with my uncle almost daily . Indeed , you will not miss me ; and at Snowfield there are brethren and sisters in great need , who have none of those comforts you have around you . I feel that I am called back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast . I feel drawn again towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the word of life to the sinful and desolate . "
229134	229140	229142	229143	Mrs. Poyser	228	" You feel ! Yes , "
229154	229378	229142	229143	Mrs. Poyser	228	" that 's allays the reason I 'm to sit down wi ' , when you 've a mind to do anything contrairy . What do you want to be preaching for more than you 're preaching now ? Do n't you go off , the Lord knows where , every Sunday a - preaching and praying ? An ' have n't you got Methodists enow at Treddles'on to go and look at , if church - folks 's faces are too handsome to please you ? An ' is n't there them i ' this parish as you 've got under hand , and they 're like enough to make friends wi ' Old Harry again as soon as your back 's turned ? There 's that Bessy Cranage - she 'll be flaunting i ' new finery three weeks after you 're gone , I 'll be bound . She 'll no more go on in her new ways without you than a dog ' ull stand on its hind - legs when there 's nobody looking . But I suppose it doesna matter so much about folks 's souls i ' this country , else you 'd be for staying with your own aunt , for she 's none so good but what you might help her to be better . "
229415	229503	229402	229402	she	228	" See there ! It 's tea - time ; an ' if Martin 's i ' the rick - yard , he 'll like a cup . Here , Totty , my chicken , let mother put your bonnet on , and then you go out into the rick - yard and see if Father 's there , and tell him he must n't go away again without coming t ' have a cup o ' tea ; and tell your brothers to come in too . "
229529	229546	229547	229547	she	228	" You talk o ' them gells Nancy and Molly being clever i ' their work , "
229551	229690	229547	229547	she	228	" it 's fine talking . They 're all the same , clever or stupid - one ca n't trust 'em out o ' one 's sight a minute . They want somebody 's eye on 'em constant if they 're to be kept to their work . An ' suppose I 'm ill again this winter , as I was the winter before last ? Who 's to look after 'em then , if you 're gone ? An ' there 's that blessed child - something 's sure t ' happen to her - they 'll let her tumble into the fire , or get at the kettle wi ' the boiling lard in't , or some mischief as ' ull lame her for life ; an ' it 'll be all your fault , Dinah . "
229691	229694	229696	229696	Dinah	141	" Aunt , "
229698	229856	229696	229696	Dinah	141	" I promise to come back to you in the winter if you 're ill . Do n't think I will ever stay away from you if you 're in real want of me . But , indeed , it is needful for my own soul that I should go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all things too richly to enjoy - at least that I should go away for a short space . No one can know but myself what are my inward needs , and the besetments I am most in danger from . Your wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own desires ; it is a temptation that I must resist , lest the love of the creature should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly light . "
229857	229872	229874	229875	Mrs. Poyser	228	" It passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury , "
229885	229966	229878	229878	she	228	" It 's true there 's good victual enough about you , as nobody shall ever say I do n't provide enough and to spare , but if there 's ever a bit o ' odds an ' ends as nobody else ' ud eat , you 're sure to pick it out ... but look there ! There 's Adam Bede a - carrying the little un in . I wonder how it is he 's come so early . "
229997	230042	229878	229878	she	228	" Oh for shame , Totty ! Little gells o ' five year old should be ashamed to be carried . Why , Adam , she 'll break your arm , such a big gell as that ; set her down - for shame ! "
230043	230048	230050	230050	Adam	127	" Nay , nay , "
230052	230072	230050	230050	Adam	127	" I can lift her with my hand - I 've no need to take my arm to it . "
230108	230123	230125	230125	Adam	127	" You 're surprised to see me at this hour o ' the day , "
230127	230134	230136	230137	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Yes , but come in , "
230144	230154	230136	230137	Mrs. Poyser	228	" there 's no bad news , I hope ? "
230155	230161	230162	230162	Adam	127	" No , nothing bad , "
230219	230231	230233	230233	Adam	127	" It 's an errand to you brought me , Dinah , "
230247	230323	230324	230324	Adam	127	" mother 's a bit ailing , and she 's set her heart on your coming to stay the night with her , if you 'll be so kind . I told her I 'd call and ask you as I came from the village . She overworks herself , and I ca n't persuade her to have a little girl t ' help her . I do n't know what 's to be done . "
230351	230422	230347	230348	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Look there now ! I told you there was folks enow t ' help i ' this parish , wi'out going further off . There 's Mrs. Bede getting as old and cas'alty as can be , and she wo n't let anybody but you go a - nigh her hardly . The folks at Snowfield have learnt by this time to do better wi'out you nor she can . "
230423	230446	230448	230448	Dinah	141	" I 'll put my bonnet on and set off directly , if you do n't want anything done first , Aunt , "
230455	230499	230448	230448	Dinah	141	" Yes , I do want something done . I want you t ' have your tea , child ; it 's all ready - and you 'll have a cup , Adam , if y ' arena in too big a hurry . "
230500	230539	230347	230348	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Yes , I 'll have a cup , please ; and then I 'll walk with Dinah . I 'm going straight home , for I 've got a lot o ' timber valuations to write out . "
230540	230551	230553	230554	Mr. Poyser	208	" Why , Adam , lad , are you here ? "
230587	230605	230347	230348	Mrs. Poyser	228	" How is it we 've got sight o ' you so long before foddering - time ? "
230606	230615	230617	230617	Adam	127	" I came on an errand for Mother , "
230619	230643	230617	230617	Adam	127	" She 's got a touch of her old complaint , and she wants Dinah to go and stay with her a bit . "
230644	230658	230660	230661	Mr. Poyser	208	" Well , we 'll spare her for your mother a little while , "
230663	230677	230660	230661	Mr. Poyser	208	" But we wonna spare her for anybody else , on'y her husband . "
230678	230681	230683	230697	Marty , who was at the most prosaic and literal period of the boyish mind	4849	" Husband ! "
230699	230709	230683	230697	Marty , who was at the most prosaic and literal period of the boyish mind	4849	" Why , Dinah has n't got a husband . "
230710	230714	230716	230717	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Spare her ? "
230737	230802	230730	230730	herself	228	" But we must spare her , it seems , and not for a husband neither , but for her own megrims . Tommy , what are you doing to your little sister 's doll ? Making the child naughty , when she 'd be good if you 'd let her . You shanna have a morsel o ' cake if you behave so . "
230841	230858	230859	230860	Mrs. Poyser	228	" What do you think Dinah 's been a - telling me since dinner - time ? "
230868	230879	230881	230882	Mr. Poyser	208	" Eh ! I 'm a poor un at guessing , "
230884	230922	230881	230882	Mr. Poyser	208	" Why , she means to go back to Snowfield again , and work i ' the mill , and starve herself , as she used to do , like a creatur as has got no friends . "
231076	231106	231068	231068	Adam	127	" Why , I hoped Dinah was settled among us for life . I thought she 'd given up the notion o ' going back to her old country . "
231107	231112	231114	231115	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Thought ! Yes , "
231117	231163	231114	231115	Mrs. Poyser	228	" and so would anybody else ha ' thought , as had got their right end up'ards . But I suppose you must be a Methodist to know what a Methodist ' ull do . It 's ill guessing what the bats are flying after . "
231164	231184	231186	231187	Mr. Poyser	208	" Why , what have we done to you . Dinah , as you must go away from us ? "
231197	231222	231186	231187	Mr. Poyser	208	" It 's like breaking your word , welly , for your aunt never had no thought but you 'd make this your home . "
231223	231228	231230	231230	Dinah	141	" Nay , Uncle , "
231238	231266	231230	231230	Dinah	141	" When I first came , I said it was only for a time , as long as I could be of any comfort to my aunt . "
231267	231285	231287	231288	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Well , an ' who said you 'd ever left off being a comfort to me ? "
231290	231322	231287	231288	Mrs. Poyser	228	" If you didna mean to stay wi ' me , you 'd better never ha ' come . Them as ha ' never had a cushion do n't miss it . "
231323	231328	231330	231331	Mr. Poyser	208	" Nay , nay , "
231339	231413	231330	231331	Mr. Poyser	208	" Thee mustna say so ; we should ha ' been ill off wi'out her , Lady day was a twelvemont ' . We mun be thankful for that , whether she stays or no . But I canna think what she mun leave a good home for , to go back int ' a country where the land , most on't , isna worth ten shillings an acre , rent and profits . "
231414	231436	231438	231439	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Why , that 's just the reason she wants to go , as fur as she can give a reason , "
231441	231530	231438	231439	Mrs. Poyser	228	" She says this country 's too comfortable , an ' there 's too much t ' eat , an ' folks arena miserable enough . And she 's going next week . I canna turn her , say what I will . It 's allays the way wi ' them meek - faced people ; you may 's well pelt a bag o ' feathers as talk to 'em . But I say it isna religion , to be so obstinate - is it now , Adam ? "
231569	231643	231561	231561	he	127	" Nay , I ca n't find fault with anything Dinah does . I believe her thoughts are better than our guesses , let 'em be what they may . I should ha ' been thankful for her to stay among us , but if she thinks well to go , I would n't cross her , or make it hard to her by objecting . We owe her something different to that . "
231701	231710	231712	231712	Totty	242	" Mother , what 's Dinah crying for ? "
231714	231722	231712	231712	Totty	242	" She is n't a naughty dell . "
231723	231731	231733	231734	Mr. Poyser	208	" Thee'st gone a bit too fur , "
231736	231774	231733	231734	Mr. Poyser	208	" We 've no right t ' interfere with her doing as she likes . An ' thee'dst be as angry as could be wi ' me , if I said a word against anything she did . "
231775	231787	231789	231790	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Because you 'd very like be finding fault wi'out reason , "
231792	231921	231789	231790	Mrs. Poyser	228	" But there 's reason i ' what I say , else I shouldna say it . It 's easy talking for them as ca n't love her so well as her own aunt does . An ' me got so used to her ! I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared sheep when she 's gone from me . An ' to think of her leaving a parish where she 's so looked on . There 's Mr. Irwine makes as much of her as if she was a lady , for all her being a Methodist , an ' wi ' that maggot o ' preaching in her head - God forgi'e me if I 'm i ' the wrong to call it so . "
231922	231925	231927	231928	Mr. Poyser	208	" Aye , "
231933	232022	231927	231928	Mr. Poyser	208	" but thee dostna tell Adam what he said to thee about it one day . The missis was saying , Adam , as the preaching was the only fault to be found wi ' Dinah , and Mr. Irwine says , ' But you must n't find fault with her for that , Mrs. Poyser ; you forget she 's got no husband to preach to . I 'll answer for it , you give Poyser many a good sermon . ' The parson had thee there , "
232030	232044	232023	232024	Mr. Poyser	208	" I told Bartle Massey on it , an ' he laughed too . "
232045	232073	232075	232076	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Yes , it 's a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a - staring at one another with a pipe i ' their mouths , "
232078	232139	232075	232076	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Give Bartle Massey his way and he 'd have all the sharpness to himself . If the chaff - cutter had the making of us , we should all be straw , I reckon . Totty , my chicken , go upstairs to cousin Dinah , and see what she 's doing , and give her a pretty kiss . "
232195	232207	232209	232210	Mr. Poyser	208	" You 're rare and busy now - eh , Adam ? "
232212	232236	232209	232210	Mr. Poyser	208	" Burge 's getting so bad wi ' his asthmy , it 's well if he 'll ever do much riding about again . "
232237	232253	232255	232255	Adam	127	" Yes , we 've got a pretty bit o ' building on hand now , "
232257	232274	232255	232255	Adam	127	" what with the repairs on th ' estate , and the new houses at Treddles'on . "
232275	232303	232305	232306	Mr. Poyser	208	" I 'll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit o ' land is for him and Mary to go to , "
232308	232357	232305	232306	Mr. Poyser	208	" He 'll be for laying by business soon , I 'll warrant , and be wanting you to take to it all and pay him so much by th ' ' ear . We shall see you living on th ' hill before another twelvemont 's over . "
232358	232361	232363	232363	Adam	127	" Well , "
232365	232434	232363	232363	Adam	127	" I should like t ' have the business in my own hands . It is n't as I mind much about getting any more money . We 've enough and to spare now , with only our two selves and mother ; but I should like t ' have my own way about things - I could try plans then , as I ca n't do now . "
232435	232450	232452	232453	Mr. Poyser	208	" You get on pretty well wi ' the new steward , I reckon ? "
232455	232652	232452	232453	Mr. Poyser	208	" Yes , yes ; he 's a sensible man enough ; understands farming - he 's carrying on the draining , and all that , capital . You must go some day towards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations they 're making . But he 's got no notion about buildings . You can so seldom get hold of a man as can turn his brains to more nor one thing ; it 's just as if they wore blinkers like th ' horses and could see nothing o ' one side of 'em . Now , there 's Mr. Irwine has got notions o ' building more nor most architects ; for as for th ' architects , they set up to be fine fellows , but the most of 'em do n't know where to set a chimney so as it sha n't be quarrelling with a door . My notion is , a practical builder that 's got a bit o ' taste makes the best architect for common things ; and I 've ten times the pleasure i ' seeing after the work when I 've made the plan myself . "
232710	232735	232704	232704	he	127	" Well , lad , I 'll bid you good - bye now , for I 'm off to the rick - yard again . "
232762	232772	232773	232773	Adam	127	" You 're ready , I see , Dinah , "
232793	232794	232795	232795	Mother	185	" "
232797	232806	232795	232795	Mother	185	" said Totty , with her treble pipe , "
232817	232818	232807	232807	Dinah	141	" "
232823	232828	232829	232830	little gells	4857	" said the mother , "
232835	232874	232829	232830	little gells	4857	" Whereupon the father , shaking with silent laughter , set Totty on the white deal table and desired her to kiss him . Mr. and Mrs. Poyser , you perceive , had no correct principles of education . "
232890	232895	232888	232888	Dinah	141	" said Mrs. Poyser : "
232909	233023	233024	233024	You	4858	" So , when the good - byes had been said , Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm together . Chapter L In the Cottage ADAM did not ask Dinah to take his arm when they got out into the lane . He had never yet done so , often as they had walked together , for he had observed that she never walked arm - in - arm with Seth , and he thought , perhaps , that kind of support was not agreeable to her . So they walked apart , though side by side , and the close poke of her little black bonnet hid her face from him . "
233042	233064	233040	233040	Dinah	141	" Adam said , with the quiet interest of a brother , who has no anxiety for himself in the matter . "
233078	233079	233071	233071	they	4861	" "
233264	233265	233266	233266	You	4864	" "
233272	233276	233266	233266	You	4864	" said Adam . "
233412	233548	233549	233549	I	0	" Dinah made no answer , and they walked on in silence for some yards , till they came to the stone stile , where , as Adam had passed through first and turned round to give her his hand while she mounted the unusually high step , she could not prevent him from seeing her face . It struck him with surprise , for the grey eyes , usually so mild and grave , had the bright uneasy glance which accompanies suppressed agitation , and the slight flush in her cheeks , with which she had come downstairs , was heightened to a deep rose - colour . She looked as if she were only sister to Dinah . Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some moments , and then he said , "
233638	233657	233631	233631	I	0	" Poor Adam ! Thus do men blunder . Dinah made no answer , but she presently said , "
233676	233700	233659	233659	you	0	" Dinah always called Arthur so ; she had never lost the image of him as she had seen him in the prison . "
233703	233707	233659	233659	you	0	" said Adam . "
233860	233861	233862	233862	He	4870	" "
233885	233889	233878	233878	I	0	" said Dinah . "
233964	233965	233978	233978	Moses	256	" "
233968	233972	233978	233978	Moses	256	" said Adam , "
234068	234106	234051	234051	somebody	7010	" They were both glad to talk of subjects that were not personal , and in this way they went on till they passed the bridge across the Willow Brook , when Adam turned round and said , "
234131	234132	234122	234122	he	128	" "
234141	234276	234135	234135	I	0	" Adam remembered now that Seth had come home much depressed on Sunday evening , a circumstance which had been very unusual with him of late , for the happiness he had in seeing Dinah every week seemed long to have outweighed the pain of knowing she would never marry him . This evening he had his habitual air of dreamy benignant contentment , until he came quite close to Dinah and saw the traces of tears on her delicate eyelids and eyelashes . He gave one rapid glance at his brother , but Adam was evidently quite outside the current of emotion that had shaken Dinah : he wore his everyday look of unexpectant calm . Seth tried not to let Dinah see that he had noticed her face , and only said , "
234312	234365	234299	234299	She	185	" When they entered the cottage , Lisbeth was seated in her arm - chair , too tired with setting out the evening meal , a task she always performed a long time beforehand , to go and meet them at the door as usual , when she heard the approaching footsteps . "
234375	234385	234368	234368	child	5576	" she said , when Dinah went towards her . "
234405	234406	234407	234408	Dear friend	1499	" "
234410	234418	234407	234408	Dear friend	1499	" said Dinah , taking her hand , "
234436	234437	234431	234431	I	0	" "
234566	234610	234561	234561	me	0	" Dinah was moving away , but Lisbeth held her fast , while she was taking off her bonnet , and looked at her face as one looks into a newly gathered snowdrop , to renew the old impressions of purity and gentleness . "
234619	234626	234627	234627	thee'st	4887	" said Lisbeth , in astonishment ; "
234634	234635	234627	234627	thee'st	4887	" "
234646	234670	234671	234671	You	4887	" said Dinah , who did not wish just now to call forth Lisbeth 's remonstrances by disclosing her intention to leave Hayslope . "
234696	234906	234687	234687	I	0	" Lisbeth was pacified by this prospect . And she had the whole evening to talk with Dinah alone ; for there was a new room in the cottage , you remember , built nearly two years ago , in the expectation of a new inmate ; and here Adam always sat when he had writing to do or plans to make . Seth sat there too this evening , for he knew his mother would like to have Dinah all to herself . There were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in the cottage . On one side there was the broad - shouldered , large - featured , hardy old woman , in her blue jacket and buff kerchief , with her dim - eyed anxious looks turned continually on the lily face and the slight form in the black dress that were either moving lightly about in helpful activity , or seated close by the old woman 's arm - chair , holding her withered hand , with eyes lifted up towards her to speak a language which Lisbeth understood far better than the Bible or the hymn - book . She would scarcely listen to reading at all to - night . "
234915	234919	234920	234920	We	4893	" she said . "
234948	234988	234941	234941	thy	4894	" On the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like each other in the midst of their unlikeness : Adam with knit brows , shaggy hair , and dark vigorous colour , absorbed in his "
234990	235069	235071	235071	I	0	" ; Seth , with large rugged features , the close copy of his brother 's , but with thin , wavy , brown hair and blue dreamy eyes , as often as not looking vaguely out of the window instead of at his book , although it was a newly bought book - Wesley 's abridgment of Madame Guyon 's life , which was full of wonder and interest for him . Seth had said to Adam , "
235094	235095	235082	235082	I	0	" "
235100	235104	235082	235082	I	0	" Adam answered , "
235123	235161	235162	235164	th ' lad	5625	" And often , when Seth was quite unconscious , Adam , as he paused after drawing a line with his ruler , looked at his brother with a kind smile dawning in his eyes . He knew "
235193	236251	235188	235188	they	4899	" and in the last year or so , Adam had been getting more and more indulgent to Seth . It was part of that growing tenderness which came from the sorrow at work within him . For Adam , though you see him quite master of himself , working hard and delighting in his work after his inborn inalienable nature , had not outlived his sorrow - had not felt it slip from him as a temporary burden , and leave him the same man again . Do any of us ? God forbid . It would be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling if we won nothing but our old selves at the end of it - if we could return to the same blind loves , the same self - confident blame , the same light thoughts of human suffering , the same frivolous gossip over blighted human lives , the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which we have sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness . Let us rather be thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force , only changing its form , as forces do , and passing from pain into sympathy - the one poor word which includes all our best insight and our best love . Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had completely taken place in Adam yet . There was still a great remnant of pain , and this he felt would subsist as long as her pain was not a memory , but an existing thing , which he must think of as renewed with the light of every new morning . But we get accustomed to mental as well as bodily pain , without , for all that , losing our sensibility to it . It becomes a habit of our lives , and we cease to imagine a condition of perfect ease as possible for us . Desire is chastened into submission , and we are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our grief in silence and act as if we were not suffering . For it is at such periods that the sense of our lives having visible and invisible relations , beyond any of which either our present or prospective self is the centre , grows like a muscle that we are obliged to lean on and exert . That was Adam 's state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow . His work , as you know , had always been part of his religion , and from very early days he saw clearly that good carpentry was God 's will - was that form of God 's will that most immediately concerned him . But now there was no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality , no holiday - time in the working - day world , no moment in the distance when duty would take off her iron glove and breast - plate and clasp him gently into rest . He conceived no picture of the future but one made up of hard - working days such as he lived through , with growing contentment and intensity of interest , every fresh week . Love , he thought , could never be anything to him but a living memory - a limb lopped off , but not gone from consciousness . He did not know that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within him ; that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible , nay , necessary to him , that his nature should intertwine with another . Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were more precious to him than they used to be - that he clung more to his mother and Seth , and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or imagination of any small addition to their happiness . The Poysers , too - hardly three or four days passed but he felt the need of seeing them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with them . He would have felt this , probably , even if Dinah had not been with them , but he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put her above all other friends in the world . Could anything be more natural ? For in the darkest moments of memory the thought of her always came as the first ray of returning comfort . The early days of gloom at the Hall Farm had been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her presence ; and in the cottage , too , for she had come at every spare moment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth , who had been stricken with a fear that subdued even her querulousness at the sight of her darling Adam 's grief - worn face . He had become used to watching her light quiet movements , her pretty loving ways to the children , when he went to the Hall Farm ; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music ; to think everything she said and did was just right , and could not have been better . In spite of his wisdom , he could not find fault with her for her overindulgence of the children , who had managed to convert Dinah the preacher , before whom a circle of rough men had often trembled a little , into a convenient household slave - though Dinah herself was rather ashamed of this weakness , and had some inward conflict as to her departure from the precepts of Solomon . Yes , there was one thing that might have been better ; she might have loved Seth and consented to marry him . He felt a little vexed , for his brother 's sake , and he could not help thinking regretfully how Dinah , as Seth 's wife , would have made their home as happy as it could be for them all - how she was the one being that would have soothed their mother 's last days into peacefulness and rest . "
236263	236271	236255	236255	she	4900	" Adam had said sometimes to himself , "
236475	236704	236442	236442	God	135	" This self - reproof had recurred strongly to Adam 's mind when he gathered from Dinah 's face that he had wounded her by referring to his wish that she had accepted Seth , and so he had endeavoured to put into the strongest words his confidence in her decision as right - his resignation even to her going away from them and ceasing to make part of their life otherwise than by living in their thoughts , if that separation were chosen by herself . He felt sure she knew quite well enough how much he cared to see her continually - to talk to her with the silent consciousness of a mutual great remembrance . It was not possible she should hear anything but self - renouncing affection and respect in his assurance that he was contented for her to go away ; and yet there remained an uneasy feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the right thing - that , somehow , Dinah had not understood him . Dinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning , for she was downstairs about five o'clock . So was Seth , for , through Lisbeth 's obstinate refusal to have any woman - helper in the house , he had learned to make himself , as Adam said , "
236711	237091	236442	236442	God	135	" that he might save his mother from too great weariness ; on which ground I hope you will not think him unmanly , any more than you can have thought the gallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made the gruel for his invalid sister . Adam , who had sat up late at his writing , was still asleep , and was not likely , Seth said , to be down till breakfast - time . Often as Dinah had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months , she had never slept in the cottage since that night after Thias 's death , when , you remember , Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a modified approval to her porridge . But in that long interval Dinah had made great advances in household cleverness , and this morning , since Seth was there to help , she was bent on bringing everything to a pitch of cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser . The cottage was far from that standard at present , for Lisbeth 's rheumatism had forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante scouring and polishing . When the kitchen was to her mind , Dinah went into the new room , where Adam had been writing the night before , to see what sweeping and dusting were needed there . She opened the window and let in the fresh morning air , and the smell of the sweet - brier , and the bright low - slanting rays of the early sun , which made a glory about her pale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush , and swept , singing to herself in a very low tone - like a sweet summer murmur that you have to listen for very closely - one of Charles Wesley 's hymns : Eternal Beam of Light Divine , Fountain of unexhausted love , In whom the Father 's glories shine , Through earth beneath and heaven above ; Jesus ! the weary wanderer 's rest , Give me thy easy yoke to bear ; With steadfast patience arm my breast , With spotless love and holy fear . Speak to my warring passions , "
237094	237101	236442	236442	God	135	" Say to my trembling heart , "
237105	237289	237290	237290	Seth	128	" Thy power my strength and fortress is , For all things serve thy sovereign will . She laid by the brush and took up the duster ; and if you had ever lived in Mrs. Poyser 's household , you would know how the duster behaved in Dinah 's hand - how it went into every small corner , and on every ledge in and out of sight - how it went again and again round every bar of the chairs , and every leg , and under and over everything that lay on the table , till it came to Adam 's papers and rulers and the open desk near them . Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated , looking at them with a longing but timid eye . It was painful to see how much dust there was among them . As she was looking in this way , she heard Seth 's step just outside the open door , towards which her back was turned , and said , raising her clear treble , "
237302	237303	237290	237290	Seth	128	" "
237319	237439	237290	237290	Seth	128	" said a deep strong voice , not Seth 's . It was as if Dinah had put her hands unawares on a vibrating chord . She was shaken with an intense thrill , and for the instant felt nothing else ; then she knew her cheeks were glowing , and dared not look round , but stood still , distressed because she could not say good - morning in a friendly way . Adam , finding that she did not look round so as to see the smile on his face , was afraid she had thought him serious about his wrathfulness , and went up to her , so that she was obliged to look at him . "
237454	237460	237442	237442	You	4913	" he said , smilingly . "
237463	237473	237442	237442	You	4913	" said Dinah , looking up with timid eyes , "
237504	237505	237491	237493	the man Moses	4916	" "
237510	237519	237520	237520	I	0	" said Adam , looking at her affectionately , "
237559	237700	237701	237701	Dinah	141	" They began their little task together , but Dinah had not recovered herself sufficiently to think of any remark , and Adam looked at her uneasily . Dinah , he thought , had seemed to disapprove him somehow lately ; she had not been so kind and open to him as she used to be . He wanted her to look at him , and be as pleased as he was himself with doing this bit of playful work . But Dinah did not look at him - it was easy for her to avoid looking at the tall man - and when at last there was no more dusting to be done and no further excuse for him to linger near her , he could bear it no longer , and said , in rather a pleading tone , "
237730	237767	237772	237772	Adam	127	" The question surprised her , and relieved her by giving a new course to her feeling . She looked up at him now , quite earnestly , almost with the tears coming , and said , "
237780	237781	237776	237776	you	127	" "
237802	237806	237808	237808	you	141	" said Adam . "
237895	237896	237893	237893	Dinah	141	" "
237902	237914	237893	237893	Dinah	141	" said Dinah , trembling , but trying to speak calmly , "
237977	237990	237991	237991	I	0	" Adam saw that it pained her to be obliged to answer . "
238001	238005	237999	237999	Dinah	141	" he said . "
238023	238199	238016	238016	Seth	128	" That is a simple scene , reader . But it is almost certain that you , too , have been in love - perhaps , even , more than once , though you may not choose to say so to all your feminine friends . If so , you will no more think the slight words , the timid looks , the tremulous touches , by which two human souls approach each other gradually , like two little quivering rain - streams , before they mingle into one - you will no more think these things trivial than you will think the first - detected signs of coming spring trivial , though they be but a faint indescribable something in the air and in the song of the birds , and the tiniest perceptible budding on the hedge - row branches . Those slight words and looks and touches are part of the soul 's language ; and the finest language , I believe , is chiefly made up of unimposing words , such as "
238202	238206	238016	238016	Seth	128	" ' sound , "
238210	238211	238016	238016	Seth	128	" "
238213	238231	238016	238016	Seth	128	" - words really not worth looking at , or hearing , in themselves , any more than "
238233	238238	238016	238016	Seth	128	" or ' sawdust . "
238300	238302	238355	238355	she	141	" light "
238304	238307	238355	238355	she	141	" music , "
238376	238382	238383	238383	Dinah	141	" For a long while , "
238396	238415	238417	238417	Lisbeth	268	" Then it 'll be for all my life , an ' I shall ne'er see thee again , "
238419	238465	238417	238417	Lisbeth	268	" Long while ! I'n got no long while t ' live . An ' I shall be took bad an ' die , an ' thee canst ne'er come a - nigh me , an ' I shall die a - longing for thee . "
238532	238534	238490	238490	she	268	" contrairiness "
238544	238554	238498	238498	She	268	" couldna ' ha ' one o ' the lads "
238560	238569	238570	238570	she	268	" Thee couldstna put up wi ' Seth , "
238573	238768	238570	238570	she	268	" He isna cliver enough for thee , happen , but he 'd ha ' been very good t ' thee - he 's as handy as can be at doin' things for me when I 'm bad , an ' he 's as fond o ' the Bible an ' chappellin ' as thee art thysen . But happen , thee'dst like a husband better as isna just the cut o ' thysen : the runnin ' brook isna athirst for th ' rain . Adam ' ud ha ' done for thee - I know he would - an ' he might come t ' like thee well enough , if thee'dst stop . But he 's as stubborn as th ' iron bar - there 's no bending him no way but 's own . But he 'd be a fine husband for anybody , be they who they will , so looked - on an ' so cliver as he is . And he 'd be rare an ' lovin' : it does me good on'y a look o ' the lad 's eye when he means kind tow'rt me . "
238862	238873	238874	238874	Dinah	141	" The God of love and peace be with them , "
238886	238928	238878	238878	she	141	" Make them glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted them , and the years wherein they have seen evil . It is thy will that I should part from them ; let me have no will but thine . "
238982	238994	238996	238996	her	141	" Thee't see her again o ' Sunday afore she goes , "
239000	239028	238996	238996	her	141	" If thee wast good for anything , thee'dst make her come in again o ' Sunday night wi ' thee , and see me once more . "
239029	239034	239036	239036	Seth	128	" Nay , Mother , "
239038	239087	239036	239036	Seth	128	" Dinah ' ud be sure to come again if she saw right to come . I should have no need to persuade her . She only thinks it ' ud be troubling thee for nought , just to come in to say good - bye over again . "
239088	239117	239119	239119	Lisbeth	268	" She 'd ne'er go away , I know , if Adam ' ud be fond on her an ' marry her , but everything 's so contrairy , "
239146	239162	239163	239163	he	128	" What ! Has she said anything o ' that sort to thee , Mother ? "
239171	239200	239163	239163	he	128	" Said ? Nay , she 'll say nothin' . It 's on'y the men as have to wait till folks say things afore they find 'em out . "
239201	239221	239318	239319	His mother	885	" Well , but what makes thee think so , Mother ? What 's put it into thy head ? "
239222	239317	239318	239319	His mother	885	" It 's no matter what 's put it into my head . My head 's none so hollow as it must get in , an ' nought to put it there . I know she 's fond on him , as I know th ' wind 's comin ' in at the door , an ' that 's anoof . An ' he might be willin ' to marry her if he know'd she 's fond on him , but he 'll ne'er think on't if somebody doesna put it into 's head . "
239374	239381	239382	239382	he	128	" Nay , Mother , nay , "
239387	239481	239382	239382	he	128	" thee mustna think o ' speaking o ' such things to Adam . Thee'st no right to say what Dinah 's feelings are if she hasna told thee , and it ' ud do nothing but mischief to say such things to Adam . He feels very grateful and affectionate toward Dinah , but he 's no thoughts towards her that ' ud incline him to make her his wife , and I do n't believe Dinah ' ud marry him either . I do n't think she 'll marry at all . "
239482	239485	239487	239487	Lisbeth	268	" Eh , "
239491	239521	239487	239487	Lisbeth	268	" Thee think'st so 'cause she wouldna ha ' thee . She 'll ne'er marry thee ; thee mightst as well like her t ' ha ' thy brother . "
239526	239529	239530	239530	he	128	" Mother , "
239538	239593	239530	239530	he	128	" do n't think that of me . I should be as thankful t ' have her for a sister as thee wouldst t ' have her for a daughter . I 've no more thoughts about myself in that thing , and I shall take it hard if ever thee say'st it again . "
239594	239616	239382	239382	he	128	" Well , well , then thee shouldstna cross me wi ' sayin ' things arena as I say they are . "
239617	239622	239624	239624	Seth	128	" But , Mother , "
239626	239679	239624	239624	Seth	128	" thee'dst be doing Dinah a wrong by telling Adam what thee think'st about her . It ' ud do nothing but mischief , for it ' ud make Adam uneasy if he doesna feel the same to her . And I 'm pretty sure he feels nothing o ' the sort . "
239680	239833	239382	239382	he	128	" Eh , donna tell me what thee't sure on ; thee know'st nought about it . What 's he allays goin' to the Poysers ' for , if he didna want t ' see her ? He goes twice where he used t ' go once . Happen he knowsna as he wants t ' see her ; he knowsna as I put salt in 's broth , but he 'd miss it pretty quick if it warna there . He 'll ne'er think o ' marrying if it isna put into 's head , an ' if thee'dst any love for thy mother , thee'dst put him up to't an ' not let her go away out o ' my sight , when I might ha ' her to make a bit o ' comfort for me afore I go to bed to my old man under the white thorn . "
239834	239839	239841	239841	Seth	128	" Nay , Mother , "
239843	239932	239841	239841	Seth	128	" thee mustna think me unkind , but I should be going against my conscience if I took upon me to say what Dinah 's feelings are . And besides that , I think I should give offence to Adam by speaking to him at all about marrying ; and I counsel thee not to do't . Thee may'st be quite deceived about Dinah . Nay , I 'm pretty sure , by words she said to me last Sabbath , as she 's no mind to marry . "
239933	239961	239962	239962	Lisbeth	268	" Eh , thee't as contrairy as the rest on 'em . If it war summat I didna want , it ' ud be done fast enough . "
240787	240823	240771	240771	he	127	" Why , Mother , thee look'st rare and hearty this morning . Eh , Gyp wants me t ' look at him . He ca n't abide to think I love thee the best . "
240923	240932	240920	240920	she	268	" That 's her - that 's Dinah . "
240949	240965	240933	240933	Adam	127	" It is a bit like her ; but Dinah 's prettier , I think . "
240966	240984	240985	240985	Adam	127	" Well , then , if thee think'st her so pretty , why arn't fond on her ? "
240991	241006	240985	240985	Adam	127	" Why , Mother , dost think I do n't set store by Dinah ? "
241007	241010	241012	241012	Lisbeth	268	" Nay , "
241041	241075	240985	240985	Adam	127	" What 's th ' use o ' settin ' store by things as are thirty mile off ? If thee wast fond enough on her , thee wouldstna let her go away . "
241076	241092	241094	241094	Adam	127	" But I 've no right t ' hinder her , if she thinks well , "
241134	241146	241131	241131	she	268	" But she wouldna think well if thee wastna so contrairy . "
241157	241162	241163	241163	Adam	127	" Contrairy , mother ? "
241173	241183	241163	241163	Adam	127	" What have I done ? What dost mean ? "
241184	241208	241210	241210	Lisbeth	268	" Why , thee't never look at nothin' , nor think o ' nothin' , but thy figurin , an ' thy work , "
241216	241276	241210	241210	Lisbeth	268	" An ' dost think thee canst go on so all thy life , as if thee wast a man cut out o ' timber ? An ' what wut do when thy mother 's gone , an ' nobody to take care on thee as thee gett'st a bit o ' victual comfortable i ' the mornin ' ? "
241277	241288	241290	241290	Adam	127	" What hast got i ' thy mind , Mother ? "
241297	241320	241290	241290	Adam	127	" I canna see what thee't driving at . Is there anything I could do for thee as I do n't do ? "
241321	241365	241163	241163	Adam	127	" Aye , an ' that there is . Thee might'st do as I should ha ' somebody wi ' me to comfort me a bit , an ' wait on me when I 'm bad , an ' be good to me . "
241366	241428	241210	241210	Lisbeth	268	" Well , Mother , whose fault is it there isna some tidy body i ' th ' house t ' help thee ? It isna by my wish as thee hast a stroke o ' work to do . We can afford it - I 've told thee often enough . It ' ud be a deal better for us . "
241429	241502	241503	241503	Adam	127	" Eh , what 's the use o ' talking o ' tidy bodies , when thee mean'st one o ' th ' wenches out o ' th ' village , or somebody from Treddles'on as I ne'er set eyes on i ' my life ? I 'd sooner make a shift an ' get into my own coffin afore I die , nor ha ' them folks to put me in . "
241552	241602	241548	241548	she	268	" Thee mightst know well enough who ' tis I 'd like t ' ha ' wi ' me . It isna many folks I send for t ' come an ' see me . I reckon . An ' thee'st had the fetchin ' on her times enow . "
241603	241613	241615	241615	Adam	127	" Thee mean'st Dinah , Mother , I know , "
241617	241729	241548	241548	she	268	" But it 's no use setting thy mind on what ca n't be . If Dinah ' ud be willing to stay at Hayslope , it is n't likely she can come away from her aunt 's house , where they hold her like a daughter , and where she 's more bound than she is to us . If it had been so that she could ha ' married Seth , that ' ud ha ' been a great blessing to us , but we ca n't have things just as we like in this life . Thee must try and make up thy mind to do without her . "
241730	241799	241800	241800	Adam	127	" Nay , but I canna ma ' up my mind , when she 's just cut out for thee ; an ' nought shall ma ' me believe as God didna make her an ' send her there o ' purpose for thee . What 's it sinnify about her bein ' a Methody ! It ' ud happen wear out on her wi ' marryin ' . "
241879	241882	241883	241883	he	127	" Mother , "
241888	241935	241883	241883	he	127	" thee't talking wild . Do n't let me hear thee say such things again . It 's no good talking o ' what can never be . Dinah 's not for marrying ; she 's fixed her heart on a different sort o ' life . "
241936	241940	241942	241942	Lisbeth	268	" Very like , "
241946	242006	241942	241942	Lisbeth	268	" very like she 's none for marr'ing , when them as she 'd be willin ' t ' marry wonna ax her . I shouldna ha ' been for marr'ing thy feyther if he 'd ne'er axed me ; an ' she 's as fond o ' thee as e'er I war o ' Thias , poor fellow . "
242132	242162	242117	242117	he	127	" What dost say such things for , Mother , when thee'st got no foundation for 'em ? Thee know'st nothing as gives thee a right to say that . "
242163	242295	242097	242097	she	885	" Then I knowna nought as gi'es me a right to say as the year 's turned , for all I feel it fust thing when I get up i ' th ' morning . She isna fond o ' Seth , I reckon , is she ? She doesna want to marry HIM ? But I can see as she doesna behave tow'rt thee as she daes tow'rt Seth . She makes no more o ' Seth 's coming a - nigh her nor if he war Gyp , but she 's all of a tremble when thee't a - sittin ' down by her at breakfast an ' a - looking at her . Thee think'st thy mother knows nought , but she war alive afore thee wast born . "
242296	242308	242310	242310	Adam	127	" But thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love ? "
242313	242377	242310	242310	Adam	127	" Eh , what else should it mane ? It isna hate , I reckon . An ' what should she do but love thee ? Thee't made to be loved - for where 's there a straighter cliverer man ? An ' what 's it sinnify her bein ' a Methody ? It 's on'y the marigold i ' th ' parridge . "
242509	242545	242505	242505	She	268	" An ' thee't find out as thee't poorly aff when she 's gone . Thee't fonder on her nor thee know'st . Thy eyes follow her about , welly as Gyp 's follow thee . "
242986	243007	242974	242974	he	127	" Did Seth say anything to thee about when he was coming home ? Will he be back to dinner ? "
243008	243042	242974	242974	he	127	" Aye , lad , he 'll be back for a wonder . He isna gone to Treddles'on . He 's gone somewhere else a - preachin ' and a - prayin ' . "
243043	243053	243055	243055	Adam	127	" Hast any notion which way he 's gone ? "
243057	243079	243055	243055	Adam	127	" Nay , but he aften goes to th ' Common . Thee know'st more o 's goings nor I do . "
243375	243380	243382	243382	Adam	127	" Where hast been ? "
243391	243399	243401	243401	Seth	128	" I 've been to the Common , "
243403	243652	243401	243401	Seth	128	" Dinah 's been speaking the Word to a little company of hearers at Brimstone 's , as they call him . They 're folks as never go to church hardly - them on the Common - but they 'll go and hear Dinah a bit . She 's been speaking with power this forenoon from the words , ' I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . ' And there was a little thing happened as was pretty to see . The women mostly bring their children with 'em , but to - day there was one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year old , that I never saw there before . He was as naughty as could be at the beginning while I was praying , and while we was singing , but when we all sat down and Dinah began to speak , th ' young un stood stock still all at once , and began to look at her with 's mouth open , and presently he ran away from 's mother and went to Dinah , and pulled at her , like a little dog , for her to take notice of him . So Dinah lifted him up and held th ' lad on her lap , while she went on speaking ; and he was as good as could be till he went to sleep - and the mother cried to see him . "
243653	243665	243667	243667	Adam	127	" It 's a pity she shouldna be a mother herself , "
243698	243722	243736	243736	her	4998	" There was something peculiar in his brother 's tone , which made Seth steal a glance at his face before he answered . "
243738	243742	243736	243736	her	4998	" he answered . "
243776	243777	243765	243765	She	4998	" "
243797	243803	243781	243781	she	4998	" said Adam rather shyly . "
243806	243814	243825	243825	she	4998	" said Seth , after some hesitation , "
243908	243909	243879	243879	she	141	" "
243913	244005	243879	243879	she	141	" said Adam , earnestly , ' suppose there was a man as ' ud let her do just the same and not interfere with her - she might do a good deal o ' what she does now , just as well when she was married as when she was single . Other women of her sort have married - that 's to say , not just like her , but women as preached and attended on the sick and needy . There 's Mrs. Fletcher as she talks of . "
244030	244042	244015	244015	He	128	" Why , wouldst like her to marry THEE , Brother ? "
244054	244072	244043	244043	Adam	127	" Wouldst be hurt if she was to be fonder o ' me than o ' thee ? "
244073	244076	244078	244078	Seth	128	" Nay , "
244081	244101	244078	244078	Seth	128	" how canst think it ? Have I felt thy trouble so little that I shouldna feel thy joy ? "
244118	244133	244115	244115	Seth	128	" I 'd no notion as thee'dst ever think of her for a wife . "
244134	244147	244149	244149	Adam	127	" But is it o ' any use to think of her ? "
244151	244220	244149	244149	Adam	127	" What dost say ? Mother 's made me as I hardly know where I am , with what she 's been saying to me this forenoon . She says she 's sure Dinah feels for me more than common , and ' ud be willing t ' have me . But I 'm afraid she speaks without book . I want to know if thee'st seen anything . "
244221	244231	244233	244233	Seth	128	" It 's a nice point to speak about , "
244235	244266	244267	244267	Seth	128	" and I 'm afraid o ' being wrong ; besides , we 've no right t ' intermeddle with people 's feelings when they would n't tell 'em themselves . "
244270	244277	244278	244278	he	128	" But thee mightst ask her , "
244282	244365	244278	244278	he	128	" She took no offence at me for asking , and thee'st more right than I had , only thee't not in the Society . But Dinah does n't hold wi ' them as are for keeping the Society so strict to themselves . She does n't mind about making folks enter the Society , so as they 're fit t ' enter the kingdom o ' God . Some o ' the brethren at Treddles'on are displeased with her for that . "
244366	244378	244380	244380	Adam	127	" Where will she be the rest o ' the day ? "
244382	244396	244398	244398	Seth	128	" She said she should n't leave the farm again to - day , "
244400	244427	244398	244398	Seth	128	" because it 's her last Sabbath there , and she 's going t ' read out o ' the big Bible wi ' the children . "
244436	244474	244428	244428	Adam	127	" Then I 'll go this afternoon ; for if I go to church , my thoughts ' ull be with her all the while . They must sing th ' anthem without me to - day . "
244508	244514	244517	244517	he	230	" but th ' young missis "
244530	244532	244517	244517	he	230	" everybody "
244661	244679	244651	244651	he	127	" I came to see you , Dinah : I knew the rest were not at home . "
244796	244809	244814	244814	herself	141	" Your mother is not ill again , I hope , Adam ? "
244816	244825	244814	244814	herself	141	" Seth said she was well this morning . "
244826	244837	244839	244839	Adam	127	" No , she 's very hearty to - day , "
244858	244868	244869	244869	Dinah	141	" There 's nobody at home , you see , "
244872	244892	244869	244869	Dinah	141	" but you 'll wait . You 've been hindered from going to church to - day , doubtless . "
244893	244896	244897	244897	Adam	127	" Yes , "
244908	244920	244905	244905	he	127	" I was thinking about you : that was the reason . "
244972	245011	244968	244968	she	141	" Do not be careful and troubled for me , Adam . I have all things and abound at Snowfield . And my mind is at rest , for I am not seeking my own will in going . "
245012	245021	245023	245023	Adam	127	" But if things were different , Dinah , "
245027	245040	245023	245023	Adam	127	" If you knew things that perhaps you do n't know now .... "
245153	245156	245157	245157	he	127	" Dinah , "
245168	245189	245157	245157	he	127	" I love you with my whole heart and soul . I love you next to God who made me . "
245234	245263	245229	245229	he	127	" Do n't tell me you ca n't love me , Dinah . Do n't tell me we must part and pass our lives away from one another . "
245290	245307	245282	245282	she	141	" Yes , dear Adam , we must submit to another Will . We must part . "
245308	245323	245324	245324	Adam	127	" Not if you love me , Dinah - not if you love me , "
245328	245344	245282	245282	she	141	" Tell me - tell me if you can love me better than a brother ? "
245389	245463	245386	245386	she	141	" Yes , Adam , my heart is drawn strongly towards you ; and of my own will , if I had no clear showing to the contrary , I could find my happiness in being near you and ministering to you continually . I fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with others ; nay , I fear I should forget the Divine presence , and seek no love but yours . "
245500	245505	245506	245506	Adam	127	" Then , Dinah , "
245511	245603	245506	245506	Adam	127	" how can there be anything contrary to what 's right in our belonging to one another and spending our lives together ? Who put this great love into our hearts ? Can anything be holier than that ? For we can help one another in everything as is good . I 'd never think o ' putting myself between you and God , and saying you ought n't to do this and you ought n't to do that . You 'd follow your conscience as much as you do now . "
245604	245609	245610	245610	Dinah	141	" Yes , Adam , "
245613	245795	245506	245506	Adam	127	" I know marriage is a holy state for those who are truly called to it , and have no other drawing ; but from my childhood upwards I have been led towards another path ; all my peace and my joy have come from having no life of my own , no wants , no wishes for myself , and living only in God and those of his creatures whose sorrows and joys he has given me to know . Those have been very blessed years to me , and I feel that if I was to listen to any voice that would draw me aside from that path , I should be turning my back on the light that has shone upon me , and darkness and doubt would take hold of me . We could not bless each other , Adam , if there were doubts in my soul , and if I yearned , when it was too late , after that better part which had once been given me and I had put away from me . "
245796	245858	245506	245506	Adam	127	" But if a new feeling has come into your mind , Dinah , and if you love me so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people , is n't that a sign that it 's right for you to change your life ? Does n't the love make it right when nothing else would ? "
245859	246017	245506	245506	Adam	127	" Adam , my mind is full of questionings about that ; for now , since you tell me of your strong love towards me , what was clear to me has become dark again . I felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards you , and that your heart was not as mine ; and the thought of you had taken hold of me , so that my soul had lost its freedom , and was becoming enslaved to an earthly affection , which made me anxious and careful about what should befall myself . For in all other affection I had been content with any small return , or with none ; but my heart was beginning to hunger after an equal love from you . And I had no doubt that I must wrestle against that as a great temptation , and the command was clear that I must go away . "
246018	246080	245506	245506	Adam	127	" But now , dear , dear Dinah , now you know I love you better than you love me ... it 's all different now . You wo n't think o ' going . You 'll stay , and be my dear wife , and I shall thank God for giving me my life as I never thanked him before . "
246081	246213	246214	246214	Dinah	141	" Adam , it 's hard to me to turn a deaf ear ... you know it 's hard ; but a great fear is upon me . It seems to me as if you were stretching out your arms to me , and beckoning me to come and take my ease and live for my own delight , and Jesus , the Man of Sorrows , was standing looking towards me , and pointing to the sinful , and suffering , and afflicted . I have seen that again and again when I have been sitting in stillness and darkness , and a great terror has come upon me lest I should become hard , and a lover of self , and no more bear willingly the Redeemer 's cross . "
246228	246231	246232	246232	she	141	" Adam , "
246236	246276	246232	246232	she	141	" you would n't desire that we should seek a good through any unfaithfulness to the light that is in us ; you would n't believe that could be a good . We are of one mind in that . "
246277	246282	246284	246284	Adam	127	" Yes , Dinah , "
246287	246427	246284	246284	Adam	127	" I 'll never be the man t ' urge you against your conscience . But I ca n't give up the hope that you may come to see different . I do n't believe your loving me could shut up your heart - it 's only adding to what you 've been before , not taking away from it . For it seems to me it 's the same with love and happiness as with sorrow - the more we know of it the better we can feel what other people 's lives are or might be , and so we shall only be more tender to 'em , and wishful to help 'em . The more knowledge a man has , the better he 'll do 's work ; and feeling 's a sort o ' knowledge . "
246453	246600	246450	246450	his	127	" And you can do almost as much as you do now . I wo n't ask you to go to church with me of a Sunday . You shall go where you like among the people , and teach 'em ; for though I like church best , I do n't put my soul above yours , as if my words was better for you to follow than your own conscience . And you can help the sick just as much , and you 'll have more means o ' making 'em a bit comfortable ; and you 'll be among all your own friends as love you , and can help 'em and be a blessing to 'em till their dying day . Surely , Dinah , you 'd be as near to God as if you was living lonely and away from me . "
246642	246847	246625	246625	she	141	" Adam there is truth in what you say , and there 's many of the brethren and sisters who have greater strength than I have , and find their hearts enlarged by the cares of husband and kindred . But I have not faith that it would be so with me , for since my affections have been set above measure on you , I have had less peace and joy in God . I have felt as it were a division in my heart . And think how it is with me , Adam . That life I have led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness since my childhood ; and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls me to another land that I know not , I can not but fear that my soul might hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken ; and where doubt enters there is not perfect love . I must wait for clearer guidance . I must go from you , and we must submit ourselves entirely to the Divine Will . We are sometimes required to lay our natural lawful affections on the altar . "
246884	246911	246874	246874	his	127	" But you may come to feel satisfied ... to feel that you may come to me again , and we may never part , Dinah ? "
246912	246978	246855	246855	Dinah	141	" We must submit ourselves , Adam . With time , our duty will be made clear . It may be when I have entered on my former life , I shall find all these new thoughts and wishes vanish , and become as things that were not . Then I shall know that my calling is not towards marriage . But we must wait . "
246979	246982	246984	246984	Adam	127	" Dinah , "
246987	247046	246984	246984	Adam	127	" you ca n't love me so well as I love you , else you 'd have no doubts . But it 's natural you should n't , for I 'm not so good as you . I ca n't doubt it 's right for me to love the best thing God 's ever given me to know . "
247047	247138	246855	246855	Dinah	141	" Nay , Adam . It seems to me that my love for you is not weak , for my heart waits on your words and looks , almost as a little child waits on the help and tenderness of the strong on whom it depends . If the thought of you took slight hold of me , I should not fear that it would be an idol in the temple . But you will strengthen me - you will not hinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost . "
247139	247163	246984	246984	Adam	127	" Let us go out into the sunshine , Dinah , and walk together . I 'll speak no word to disturb you . "
247186	247193	247183	247183	Adam	127	" Take my arm , Dinah , "
247272	247285	247291	247291	he	208	" Hey - day ! There 's Adam along wi ' Dinah , "
247301	247314	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" I couldna think how he happened away from church . Why , "
247325	247336	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" what dost think has just jumped into my head ? "
247337	247363	247291	247291	he	208	" Summat as hadna far to jump , for it 's just under our nose . You mean as Adam 's fond o ' Dinah . "
247364	247376	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" Aye ! hast ever had any notion of it before ? "
247377	247384	247386	247387	Mrs. Poyser	228	" To be sure I have , "
247402	247428	247386	247387	Mrs. Poyser	228	" I 'm not one o ' those as can see the cat i ' the dairy an ' wonder what she 's come after . "
247429	247440	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" Thee never saidst a word to me about it . "
247441	247480	247386	247387	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Well , I are n't like a bird - clapper , forced to make a rattle when the wind blows on me . I can keep my own counsel when there 's no good i ' speaking . "
247481	247497	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" But Dinah 'll ha ' none o ' him . Dost think she will ? "
247498	247501	247503	247504	Mrs. Poyser	228	" Nay , "
247533	247534	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" "
247551	247572	247316	247317	good Martin	215	" said Martin , turning his head on one side , as if in pleased contemplation of his new idea . "
247582	247583	247574	247574	ha	5032	" "
247754	247755	247756	247756	Dinah	141	" "
247758	247768	247769	247769	mother	544	" said Tommy , running forward to meet her , "
247788	247812	247784	247784	you	141	" a comment which Tommy followed up by seizing Dinah with both arms , and dancing along by her side with incommodious fondness . "
247828	247833	247820	247820	i	0	" said Mr. Poyser . "
247838	247839	247840	247840	I	0	" "
247853	247857	247846	247846	she	141	" said Adam . "
247950	247951	247941	247943	The missis wunna	5054	" "
247954	247958	247941	247943	The missis wunna	5054	" said Adam , "
248002	248003	248000	248000	Dinah	141	" "
248008	248013	248000	248000	Dinah	141	" said Mr. Poyser . "
248020	248021	248014	248014	We	5049	" "
248032	248037	248022	248022	She	141	" observed Mrs. Poyser . "
248074	248190	248880	248880	I	0	" Dinah smiled , but gave no promise to stay , and they talked of other things through the rest of the walk , lingering in the sunshine to look at the great flock of geese grazing , at the new corn - ricks , and at the surprising abundance of fruit on the old pear - tree ; Nancy and Molly having already hastened home , side by side , each holding , carefully wrapped in her pocket - handkerchief , a prayer - book , in which she could read little beyond the large letters and the Amens . Surely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk through the fields from "
248193	248717	248880	248880	I	0	" - as such walks used to be in those old leisurely times , when the boat , gliding sleepily along the canal , was the newest locomotive wonder ; when Sunday books had most of them old brown - leather covers , and opened with remarkable precision always in one place . Leisure is gone - gone where the spinning - wheels are gone , and the pack - horses , and the slow waggons , and the pedlars , who brought bargains to the door on sunny afternoons . Ingenious philosophers tell you , perhaps , that the great work of the steam - engine is to create leisure for mankind . Do not believe them : it only creates a vacuum for eager thought to rush in . Even idleness is eager now - eager for amusement ; prone to excursion - trains , art museums , periodical literature , and exciting novels ; prone even to scientific theorizing and cursory peeps through microscopes . Old Leisure was quite a different personage . He only read one newspaper , innocent of leaders , and was free from that periodicity of sensations which we call post - time . He was a contemplative , rather stout gentleman , of excellent digestion ; of quiet perceptions , undiseased by hypothesis ; happy in his inability to know the causes of things , preferring the things themselves . He lived chiefly in the country , among pleasant seats and homesteads , and was fond of sauntering by the fruit - tree wall and scenting the apricots when they were warmed by the morning sunshine , or of sheltering himself under the orchard boughs at noon , when the summer pears were falling . He knew nothing of weekday services , and thought none the worse of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him to sleep from the text to the blessing ; liking the afternoon service best , because the prayers were the shortest , and not ashamed to say so ; for he had an easy , jolly conscience , broad - backed like himself , and able to carry a great deal of beer or port - wine , not being made squeamish by doubts and qualms and lofty aspirations . Life was not a task to him , but a sinecure . He fingered the guineas in his pocket , and ate his dinners , and slept the sleep of the irresponsible , for had he not kept up his character by going to church on the Sunday afternoons ? Fine old Leisure ! Do not be severe upon him , and judge him by our modern standard . He never went to Exeter Hall , or heard a popular preacher , or read Tracts for the Times or Sartor Resartus . Chapter LIII The Harvest Supper As Adam was going homeward , on Wednesday evening , in the six o'clock sunlight , he saw in the distance the last load of barley winding its way towards the yard - gate of the Hall Farm , and heard the chant of "
248721	248831	248880	248880	I	0	" rising and sinking like a wave . Fainter and fainter , and more musical through the growing distance , the falling dying sound still reached him , as he neared the Willow Brook . The low westering sun shone right on the shoulders of the old Binton Hills , turning the unconscious sheep into bright spots of light ; shone on the windows of the cottage too , and made them a - flame with a glory beyond that of amber or amethyst . It was enough to make Adam feel that he was in a great temple , and that the distant chant was a sacred song . "
248836	248840	248880	248880	I	0	" he thought , "
248983	249220	249223	249223	Adam	127	" He expected to see Dinah again this evening , and get leave to accompany her as far as Oakbourne ; and then he would ask her to fix some time when he might go to Snowfield , and learn whether the last best hope that had been born to him must be resigned like the rest . The work he had to do at home , besides putting on his best clothes , made it seven before he was on his way again to the Hall Farm , and it was questionable whether , with his longest and quickest strides , he should be there in time even for the roast beef , which came after the plum pudding , for Mrs. Poyser 's supper would be punctual . Great was the clatter of knives and pewter plates and tin cans when Adam entered the house , but there was no hum of voices to this accompaniment : the eating of excellent roast beef , provided free of expense , was too serious a business to those good farm - labourers to be performed with a divided attention , even if they had had anything to say to each other - which they had not . And Mr. Poyser , at the head of the table , was too busy with his carving to listen to Bartle Massey 's or Mr. Craig 's ready talk . "
249225	249248	249223	249223	Adam	127	" said Mrs. Poyser , who was standing and looking on to see that Molly and Nancy did their duty as waiters , "
249281	249548	249549	249550	Tom Saft	431	" Adam looked anxiously round for a fourth woman 's figure , but Dinah was not there . He was almost afraid of asking about her ; besides , his attention was claimed by greetings , and there remained the hope that Dinah was in the house , though perhaps disinclined to festivities on the eve of her departure . It was a goodly sight - that table , with Martin Poyser 's round good - humoured face and large person at the head of it helping his servants to the fragrant roast beef and pleased when the empty plates came again . Martin , though usually blest with a good appetite , really forgot to finish his own beef to - night - it was so pleasant to him to look on in the intervals of carving and see how the others enjoyed their supper ; for were they not men who , on all the days of the year except Christmas Day and Sundays , ate their cold dinner , in a makeshift manner , under the hedgerows , and drank their beer out of wooden bottles - with relish certainly , but with their mouths towards the zenith , after a fashion more endurable to ducks than to human bipeds . Martin Poyser had some faint conception of the flavour such men must find in hot roast beef and fresh - drawn ale . He held his head on one side and screwed up his mouth , as he nudged Bartle Massey , and watched half - witted Tom Tholer , otherwise known as "
249552	249621	249549	249550	Tom Saft	431	" receiving his second plateful of beef . A grin of delight broke over Tom 's face as the plate was set down before him , between his knife and fork , which he held erect , as if they had been sacred tapers . But the delight was too strong to continue smouldering in a grin - it burst out the next instant in a long - drawn "
249626	249692	249693	249694	Tom Saft	431	" followed by a sudden collapse into utter gravity , as the knife and fork darted down on the prey . Martin Poyser 's large person shook with his silent unctuous laugh . He turned towards Mrs. Poyser to see if she too had been observant of Tom , and the eyes of husband and wife met in a glance of good - natured amusement . "
249695	249909	249549	249550	Tom Saft	431	" was a great favourite on the farm , where he played the part of the old jester , and made up for his practical deficiencies by his success in repartee . His hits , I imagine , were those of the flail , which falls quite at random , but nevertheless smashes an insect now and then . They were much quoted at sheep - shearing and haymaking times , but I refrain from recording them here , lest Tom 's wit should prove to be like that of many other bygone jesters eminent in their day - rather of a temporary nature , not dealing with the deeper and more lasting relations of things . Tom excepted , Martin Poyser had some pride in his servants and labourers , thinking with satisfaction that they were the best worth their pay of any set on the estate . There was Kester Bale , for example Beale , probably , if the truth were known , but he was called Bale , and was not conscious of any claim to a fifth letter , the old man with the close leather cap and the network of wrinkles on his sun - browned face . Was there any man in Loamshire who knew better the "
249911	250203	249549	249550	Tom Saft	431	" of all farming work ? He was one of those invaluable labourers who can not only turn their hand to everything , but excel in everything they turn their hand to . It is true Kester 's knees were much bent outward by this time , and he walked with a perpetual curtsy , as if he were among the most reverent of men . And so he was ; but I am obliged to admit that the object of his reverence was his own skill , towards which he performed some rather affecting acts of worship . He always thatched the ricks - for if anything were his forte more than another , it was thatching - and when the last touch had been put to the last beehive rick , Kester , whose home lay at some distance from the farm , would take a walk to the rick - yard in his best clothes on a Sunday morning and stand in the lane , at a due distance , to contemplate his own thatching walking about to get each rick from the proper point of view . As he curtsied along , with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden globes at the summits of the beehive ricks , which indeed were gold of the best sort , you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan act of adoration . Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to have stockings full of coin , concerning which his master cracked a joke with him every pay - night : not a new unseasoned joke , but a good old one , that had been tried many times before and had worn well . "
250213	250450	250209	250211	a merry mon	5064	" Kester frequently remarked ; for having begun his career by frightening away the crows under the last Martin Poyser but one , he could never cease to account the reigning Martin a young master . I am not ashamed of commemorating old Kester . You and I are indebted to the hard hands of such men - hands that have long ago mingled with the soil they tilled so faithfully , thriftily making the best they could of the earth 's fruits , and receiving the smallest share as their own wages . Then , at the end of the table , opposite his master , there was Alick , the shepherd and head - man , with the ruddy face and broad shoulders , not on the best terms with old Kester ; indeed , their intercourse was confined to an occasional snarl , for though they probably differed little concerning hedging and ditching and the treatment of ewes , there was a profound difference of opinion between them as to their own respective merits . When Tityrus and Meliboeus happen to be on the same farm , they are not sentimentally polite to each other . Alick , indeed , was not by any means a honeyed man . His speech had usually something of a snarl in it , and his broad - shouldered aspect something of the bull - dog expression - "
250466	250492	250459	250459	I	0	" But he was honest even to the splitting of an oat - grain rather than he would take beyond his acknowledged share , and as "
250496	251421	251424	251424	boys	9960	" with his master 's property as if it had been his own - throwing very small handfuls of damaged barley to the chickens , because a large handful affected his imagination painfully with a sense of profusion . Good - tempered Tim , the waggoner , who loved his horses , had his grudge against Alick in the matter of corn . They rarely spoke to each other , and never looked at each other , even over their dish of cold potatoes ; but then , as this was their usual mode of behaviour towards all mankind , it would be an unsafe conclusion that they had more than transient fits of unfriendliness . The bucolic character at Hayslope , you perceive , was not of that entirely genial , merry , broad - grinning sort , apparently observed in most districts visited by artists . The mild radiance of a smile was a rare sight on a field - labourer 's face , and there was seldom any gradation between bovine gravity and a laugh . Nor was every labourer so honest as our friend Alick . At this very table , among Mr. Poyser 's men , there is that big Ben Tholoway , a very powerful thresher , but detected more than once in carrying away his master 's corn in his pockets - an action which , as Ben was not a philosopher , could hardly be ascribed to absence of mind . However , his master had forgiven him , and continued to employ him , for the Tholoways had lived on the Common time out of mind , and had always worked for the Poysers . And on the whole , I daresay , society was not much the worse because Ben had not six months of it at the treadmill , for his views of depredation were narrow , and the House of Correction might have enlarged them . As it was , Ben ate his roast beef to - night with a serene sense of having stolen nothing more than a few peas and beans as seed for his garden since the last harvest supper , and felt warranted in thinking that Alick 's suspicious eye , for ever upon him , was an injury to his innocence . But NOW the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn , leaving a fair large deal table for the bright drinking - cans , and the foaming brown jugs , and the bright brass candlesticks , pleasant to behold . NOW , the great ceremony of the evening was to begin - the harvest - song , in which every man must join . He might be in tune , if he liked to be singular , but he must not sit with closed lips . The movement was obliged to be in triple time ; the rest was ad libitum . As to the origin of this song - whether it came in its actual state from the brain of a single rhapsodist , or was gradually perfected by a school or succession of rhapsodists , I am ignorant . There is a stamp of unity , of individual genius upon it , which inclines me to the former hypothesis , though I am not blind to the consideration that this unity may rather have arisen from that consensus of many minds which was a condition of primitive thought , foreign to our modern consciousness . Some will perhaps think that they detect in the first quatrain an indication of a lost line , which later rhapsodists , failing in imaginative vigour , have supplied by the feeble device of iteration . Others , however , may rather maintain that this very iteration is an original felicity , to which none but the most prosaic minds can be insensible . The ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony . That is perhaps a painful fact , but then , you know , we can not reform our forefathers . During the first and second quatrain , sung decidedly forte , no can was filled . Here 's a health unto our master , The founder of the feast ; Here 's a health unto our master And to our mistress ! And may his doings prosper , Whate'er he takes in hand , For we are all his servants , And are at his command . But now , immediately before the third quatrain or chorus , sung fortissimo , with emphatic raps of the table , which gave the effect of cymbals and drum together , Alick 's can was filled , and he was bound to empty it before the chorus ceased . Then drink , boys , drink ! And see ye do not spill , For if ye do , ye shall drink two , For ' tis our master 's will . When Alick had gone successfully through this test of steady - handed manliness , it was the turn of old Kester , at his right hand - and so on , till every man had drunk his initiatory pint under the stimulus of the chorus . Tom Saft - the rogue - took care to spill a little by accident ; but Mrs. Poyser too officiously , Tom thought interfered to prevent the exaction of the penalty . To any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse of obvious why the "
251428	251538	251424	251424	boys	9960	" should have such an immediate and often - repeated encore ; but once entered , he would have seen that all faces were at present sober , and most of them serious - it was the regular and respectable thing for those excellent farm - labourers to do , as much as for elegant ladies and gentlemen to smirk and bow over their wine - glasses . Bartle Massey , whose ears were rather sensitive , had gone out to see what sort of evening it was at an early stage in the ceremony , and had not finished his contemplation until a silence of five minutes declared that "
251545	251636	251541	251541	boys	9960	" was not likely to begin again for the next twelvemonth . Much to the regret of the boys and Totty : on them the stillness fell rather flat , after that glorious thumping of the table , towards which Totty , seated on her father 's knee , contributed with her small might and small fist . When Bartle re - entered , however , there appeared to be a general desire for solo music after the choral . Nancy declared that Tim the waggoner knew a song and was "
251647	251654	251642	251642	i	0	" whereupon Mr. Poyser said encouragingly , "
251666	251708	251657	251657	Tim	164	" Tim looked sheepish , tucked down his head , and said he could n't sing , but this encouraging invitation of the master 's was echoed all round the table . It was a conversational opportunity : everybody could say , "
251713	251758	251711	251711	Tim	164	" except Alick , who never relaxed into the frivolity of unnecessary speech . At last , Tim 's next neighbour , Ben Tholoway , began to give emphasis to his speech by nudges , at which Tim , growing rather savage , said , "
251779	251799	251767	251767	I	0	" A good - tempered waggoner 's patience has limits , and Tim was not to be urged further . "
251812	251828	251806	251806	ye're	271	" said Ben , willing to show that he was not discomfited by this check . "
251841	252012	252013	252013	I	0	" The amatory David was a young man of an unconscious abstracted expression , which was due probably to a squint of superior intensity rather than to any mental characteristic ; for he was not indifferent to Ben 's invitation , but blushed and laughed and rubbed his sleeve over his mouth in a way that was regarded as a symptom of yielding . And for some time the company appeared to be much in earnest about the desire to hear David 's song . But in vain . The lyricism of the evening was in the cellar at present , and was not to be drawn from that retreat just yet . Meanwhile the conversation at the head of the table had taken a political turn . Mr. Craig was not above talking politics occasionally , though he piqued himself rather on a wise insight than on specific information . He saw so far beyond the mere facts of a case that really it was superfluous to know them . "
252023	252036	252013	252013	I	0	" he observed to - night , as he filled his pipe , "
252276	252277	252257	252257	you	5074	" "
252282	252297	252298	252298	they	5082	" said Martin Poyser , listening with an air of much intelligence and edification , "
252317	252318	252314	252314	I	0	" "
252325	252330	252321	252321	I	0	" continued Mr. Craig , "

252431	252450	252417	252417	I	0	" observed Mrs. Poyser , who was now seated near her husband , with Totty on her lap - "
252473	252474	252464	252465	Old Harry	358	" "
252480	252507	252508	252508	I	0	" said Mr. Poyser , turning his head on one side in a dubitative manner and giving a precautionary puff to his pipe between each sentence , "
252563	252564	252561	252561	'em	5094	" "
252572	252577	252561	252561	'em	5094	" said Mr. Craig , "
252829	252857	252820	252820	he	265	" Mr. Craig paused a moment with an emphatic stare after this triumphant specimen of Socratic argument , and then added , thumping the table rather fiercely , "
252921	252922	252911	252911	you	5107	" "
252932	252959	252911	252911	you	5107	" said Mr. Poyser , impressed at once with the political bearings of the fact and with its striking interest as an anecdote in natural history . "
252964	252968	252962	252962	Craig	265	" said Adam , "
253080	253129	253062	253062	ud	5114	" Mr. Poyser looked doubtfully at Mr. Craig , puzzled by this opposition of authorities . Mr. Irwine 's testimony was not to be disputed ; but , on the other hand , Craig was a knowing fellow , and his view was less startling . Martin had never "
253132	253217	253062	253062	ud	5114	" of the French being good for much . Mr. Craig had found no answer but such as was implied in taking a long draught of ale and then looking down fixedly at the proportions of his own leg , which he turned a little outward for that purpose , when Bartle Massey returned from the fireplace , where he had been smoking his first pipe in quiet , and broke the silence by saying , as he thrust his forefinger into the canister , "
253259	253260	253248	253248	you	127	" "
253266	253270	253263	253264	Mr. Massey	349	" said Adam . "
253289	253290	253291	253291	She	5121	" "
253301	253316	253295	253295	Adam	127	" said Mr. Poyser , reminded of Dinah for the first time this evening . "
253362	253381	253350	253350	she	5121	" Mrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam had come in , but she had had "
253384	253391	253348	253348	I	0	" to mention the bad news . "
253394	253404	253348	253348	I	0	" said Bartle , with an air of disgust . "
253419	253420	253417	253417	Adam	127	" "
253433	253438	253431	253431	Bartle	206	" said Mr. Poyser . "

253548	253553	253554	253554	one	5409	" said Mrs. Poyser ; "
253618	253643	253607	253607	THEY	629	" Martin Poyser shook with delighted laughter and winked at Adam , as much as to say the schoolmaster was in for it now . "
253646	253651	253607	253607	THEY	629	" said Bartle sneeringly , "
253690	253691	253663	253663	They	486	" "
253695	253700	253663	253663	They	486	" said Mrs. Poyser , "

254027	254033	254025	254025	Craig	265	" said Mr. Poyser jocosely , "

254069	254089	254057	254058	the women	486	" said Mr. Craig , willing to conciliate Mrs. Poyser and setting a high value on his own compliments , "
254106	254107	254102	254104	a managing woman	5153	" "
254115	254121	254122	254122	you	265	" said Bartle , dryly ; "
254213	254214	254202	254202	they	664	" "
254221	254236	254202	254202	they	664	" said Mr. Poyser , throwing himself back and looking merrily at his wife . "
254239	254252	254202	254202	they	664	" answered Mrs. Poyser , with dangerous fire kindling in her eye . "
254295	254347	254348	254348	My	0	" Mrs. Poyser would probably have brought her rejoinder to a further climax , if every one 's attention had not at this moment been called to the other end of the table , where the lyricism , which had at first only manifested itself by David 's sotto voce performance of "
254357	254389	254348	254348	My	0	" had gradually assumed a rather deafening and complex character . Tim , thinking slightly of David 's vocalization , was impelled to supersede that feeble buzz by a spirited commencement of "
254394	254543	254390	254392	Three Merry Mowers	442	" but David was not to be put down so easily , and showed himself capable of a copious crescendo , which was rendering it doubtful whether the rose would not predominate over the mowers , when old Kester , with an entirely unmoved and immovable aspect , suddenly set up a quavering treble - as if he had been an alarum , and the time was come for him to go off . The company at Alick 's end of the table took this form of vocal entertainment very much as a matter of course , being free from musical prejudices ; but Bartle Massey laid down his pipe and put his fingers in his ears ; and Adam , who had been longing to go ever since he had heard Dinah was not in the house , rose and said he must bid good - night . "
254552	254556	254544	254544	I	0	" said Bartle ; "

She was fearful lest the strength of her feeling towards him should hinder her from waiting and listening faithfully for the ultimate guiding voice from within . "
255036	255040	255028	255028	her	5166	" he thought . "
255110	255814	255105	255105	I	0	" That was Adam 's wise resolution , and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got from the remembrance of Dinah 's confession that Sunday afternoon . There is a wonderful amount of sustenance in the first few words of love . But towards the middle of October the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly , and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion . The weeks were unusually long : Dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind . Let a woman say what she will after she has once told a man that she loves him , he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second . He treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her , and makes light of all difficulties . But that sort of glow dies out : memory gets sadly diluted with time , and is not strong enough to revive us . Adam was no longer so confident as he had been . He began to fear that perhaps Dinah 's old life would have too strong a grasp upon her for any new feeling to triumph . If she had not felt this , she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort ; but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him . As Adam 's confidence waned , his patience waned with it , and he thought he must write himself . He must ask Dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful . He sat up late one night to write her a letter , but the next morning he burnt it , afraid of its effect . It would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips , for her presence reconciled him to her will . You perceive how it was : Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah , and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage , a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn . But what harm could he do by going to Snowfield ? Dinah could not be displeased with him for it . She had not forbidden him to go . She must surely expect that he would go before long . By the second Sunday in October this view of the case had become so clear to Adam that he was already on his way to Snowfield , on horseback this time , for his hours were precious now , and he had borrowed Jonathan Burge 's good nag for the journey . What keen memories went along the road with him ! He had often been to Oakbourne and back since that first journey to Snowfield , but beyond Oakbourne the greystone walls , the broken country , the meagre trees , seemed to be telling him afresh the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart . But no story is the same to us after a lapse of time - or rather , we who read it are no longer the same interpreters - and Adam this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey country , thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past . That is a base and selfish , even a blasphemous , spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed another , because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves . Adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him ; he could never thank God for another 's misery . And if I were capable of that narrow - sighted joy in Adam 's behalf , I should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself . He would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said , "
255863	256115	256138	256138	her	5175	" But it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain . Surely it is not possible to feel otherwise , any more than it would be possible for a man with cataract to regret the painful process by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day . The growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty , bringing with it a sense of added strength . We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner , or a philosopher to his less complete formula . Something like this sense of enlarged being was in Adam 's mind this Sunday morning , as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past . His feeling towards Dinah , the hope of passing his life with her , had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him . Tender and deep as his love for Hetty had been - so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away - his love for Dinah was better and more precious to him , for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow . "
256129	256135	256138	256138	her	5175	" he said to himself , "
256269	256675	256703	256703	her	5179	" It was more than two o'clock in the afternoon when Adam came in sight of the grey town on the hill - side and looked searchingly towards the green valley below , for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill . The scene looked less harsh in the soft October sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring , and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide - stretching woodless regions - that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky - had a milder , more soothing influence than usual , on this almost cloudless day . Adam 's doubts and fears melted under this influence as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him . He seemed to see Dinah 's gentle face assuring him , with its looks alone , of all he longed to know . He did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour , but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate , that he might ask where she was gone to - day . He had set his mind on following her and bringing her home . She was gone to Sloman 's End , a hamlet about three miles off , over the hill , the old woman told him - had set off directly after morning chapel , to preach in a cottage there , as her habit was . Anybody at the town would tell him the way to Sloman 's End . So Adam got on his horse again and rode to the town , putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord , from whose friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards Sloman 's End . With all his haste it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off , and he thought that as Dinah had gone so early , she would perhaps already be near returning . The little , grey , desolate - looking hamlet , unscreened by sheltering trees , lay in sight long before he reached it , and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn . "
256687	256691	256692	256692	I	0	" Adam thought . "
256710	256939	256692	256692	I	0	" He walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again , and seated himself on a loose stone , against the low wall , to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill . He chose this spot , almost at the top of the hill , because it was away from all eyes - no house , no cattle , not even a nibbling sheep near - no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky . She was much longer coming than he expected . He waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her , while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer . At last he saw the little black figure coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill . Slowly , Adam thought , but Dinah was really walking at her usual pace , with a light quiet step . Now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill , but Adam would not move yet ; he would not meet her too soon ; he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness . And now he began to fear lest he should startle her too much . "
256942	256971	256692	256692	I	0	" he thought , ' she 's not one to be overstartled ; she 's always so calm and quiet , as if she was prepared for anything . "
257114	257117	257103	257103	He	127	" Dinah ! "
257134	257137	257138	257138	Adam	127	" Dinah ! "
257263	257266	257267	257267	she	141	" Adam , "
257270	257340	257267	257267	she	141	" it is the Divine Will . My soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life I live without you . And this moment , now you are with me , and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same love . I have a fulness of strength to bear and do our heavenly Father 's Will that I had lost before . "
257350	257366	257341	257341	Adam	127	" Then we 'll never part any more , Dinah , till death parts us . "
257625	257628	257611	257612	Mr. Mills	368	" the family "
258314	258319	258364	258364	he	208	" God bless you 's "
258472	258481	258468	258468	his	159	" Oh what a joyful thing it is , "
258502	258514	258516	258517	Mr. Irwine	173	" That 's a bit of good news to cheer Arthur , "
258527	258541	258516	258517	Mr. Irwine	173	" I shall write to him the first thing when we get home . "
258731	258738	258739	258739	Dinah	141	" I see him , Seth , "
258749	258765	258739	258739	Dinah	141	" Let us go and meet him . Come , Lisbeth , come with Mother . "
258805	258811	258813	258813	Dinah	141	" Come , Uncle Seth , "
258815	258824	258825	258825	Seth	128	" Aye , aye , we 're coming , "
258871	258881	258883	258883	Dinah	141	" Better take him on thy arm , Seth , "
258895	258903	258883	258883	Dinah	141	" He 's troublesome to thee so . "
258904	258926	258935	258935	his	127	" Nay , nay : Addy likes a ride on my shoulder . I can carry him so for a bit . "
258973	258979	258981	258981	Seth	443	" Where didst see him ? "
258992	259002	258981	258981	Seth	443	" I ca n't catch sight of him anywhere . "
259003	259011	259013	259013	Dinah	141	" Between the hedges by the roadside , "
259015	259029	259013	259013	Dinah	141	" I saw his hat and his shoulder . There he is again . "
259030	259046	259048	259048	Seth	443	" Trust thee for catching sight of him if he 's anywhere to be seen , "
259052	259087	259048	259048	Seth	443	" Thee't like poor mother used to be . She was always on the look out for Adam , and could see him sooner than other folks , for all her eyes got dim . "
259088	259097	259099	259099	Dinah	141	" He 's been longer than he expected , "
259115	259123	259099	259099	Dinah	141	" it 's nigh upon seven now . "
259124	259138	259140	259140	Seth	443	" Aye , they 'd have a deal to say to one another , "
259142	259167	259140	259140	Seth	443	" and the meeting ' ud touch 'em both pretty closish . Why , it 's getting on towards eight years since they parted . "
259168	259171	259173	259173	Dinah	141	" Yes , "
259175	259237	259173	259173	Dinah	141	" Adam was greatly moved this morning at the thought of the change he should see in the poor young man , from the sickness he has undergone , as well as the years which have changed us all . And the death of the poor wanderer , when she was coming back to us , has been sorrow upon sorrow . "
259238	259243	259245	259245	Seth	443	" See , Addy , "
259258	259269	259245	259245	Seth	443	" there 's Father coming - at the far stile . "
259330	259340	259341	259341	he	127	" Well , youngster , must I take you ? "
259382	259393	259394	259394	Adam	127	" It 's cut me a good deal , Dinah , "
259405	259412	259414	259414	Dinah	141	" Didst find him greatly altered ? "
259416	259521	259414	259414	Dinah	141	" Why , he 's altered and yet not altered . I should ha ' known him anywhere . But his colour 's changed , and he looks sadly . However , the doctors say he 'll soon be set right in his own country air . He 's all sound in th ' inside ; it 's only the fever shattered him so . But he speaks just the same , and smiles at me just as he did when he was a lad . It 's wonderful how he 's always had just the same sort o ' look when he smiles . "
259522	259534	259536	259536	Dinah	141	" I 've never seen him smile , poor young man , "
259538	259550	259552	259552	Adam	127	" But thee wilt see him smile , to - morrow , "
259554	259605	259606	259606	Adam	127	" He asked after thee the first thing when he began to come round , and we could talk to one another . ' I hope she is n't altered , ' he said , ' I remember her face so well . ' I told him ' no , ' "
259620	259672	259606	259606	Adam	127	" only a bit plumper , as thee'dst a right to be after seven year . ' I may come and see her to - morrow , may n't I ? ' he said ; ' I long to tell her how I 've thought of her all these years . ' "
259673	259684	259686	259686	Dinah	141	" Didst tell him I 'd always used the watch ? "
259688	259782	259686	259686	Dinah	141	" Aye ; and we talked a deal about thee , for he says he never saw a woman a bit like thee . ' I shall turn Methodist some day , ' he said , ' when she preaches out of doors , and go to hear her . ' And I said , ' Nay , sir , you ca n't do that , for Conference has forbid the women preaching , and she 's given it up , all but talking to the people a bit in their houses . ' "
259783	259786	259788	259788	Seth	443	" Ah , "
259800	259841	259788	259788	Seth	443	" and a sore pity it was o ' Conference ; and if Dinah had seen as I did , we 'd ha ' left the Wesleyans and joined a body that ' ud put no bonds on Christian liberty . "
259842	259849	259851	259851	Adam	127	" Nay , lad , nay , "
259950	259978	259937	259937	I	0	" Seth was silent . This was a standing subject of difference rarely alluded to , and Dinah , wishing to quit it at once , said , "
259999	260000	260004	260004	he	445	" "
260142	260154	260130	260131	Mr. Irwine	173	" Adam was silent a little while , and then said , "
260260	260275	260254	260254	you	0	" There 's a sort of wrong that can never be made up for . "
260277	260278	260254	260254	you	0	" "
260294	260298	260283	260283	Mr.	5280	" said Seth . "
260303	260307	260283	260283	Mr.	5280	" said Dinah . "
