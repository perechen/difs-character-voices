1317	1382	1311	1311	she	199	" these young parsons is so high and so scornful , they set everybody beneath their ' fit . ' They treat her with less than civility , just because she does n't keep a servant , but does the work of the house herself , as her mother did afore her ; then they are always speaking against Yorkshire ways and Yorkshire folk , "
1408	1437	1388	1389	Mrs. Gale	199	" The old parsons is worth the whole lump of college lads ; they know what belongs to good manners , and is kind to high and low . "

Its elegy was chanted in the kitchen by Abraham , Mrs. Gale 's son and heir , a youth of six summers ; he had reckoned upon the reversion thereof , and when his mother brought down the empty platter , he lifted up his voice and wept sore .

2770	2804	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" O Mr. Helstone , is it you , sir ? I could hardly see you for the darkness ; it is so soon dark now . Will you walk in , sir ? "
2805	2825	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" I want to know first whether it is worth my while walking in . Whom have you upstairs ? "
2826	2832	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" The curates , sir . "
2833	2840	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" What ! all of them ? "
2841	2846	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" Yes , sir . "
2847	2852	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" Been dining here ? "
2853	2858	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" Yes , sir . "
2859	2864	2737	2738	Mr. Gale	205	" That will do . "
2922	2925	2926	2926	he	723	" Hey ! "
2937	2946	2934	2935	Mr. Gale	205	" Have you often this sort of work ? "
2961	2975	2977	2977	he	205	" They 're young , you know , sir - they 're young , "
2980	3026	3035	3035	he	205	" Young ! They want caning . Bad boys - bad boys ! And if you were a Dissenter , John Gale , instead of being a good Churchman , they 'd do the like - they 'd expose themselves ; but I 'll - - "
3176	3179	3180	3180	he	205	" What ! "
3208	3317	3180	3180	he	205	" what ! has the miracle of Pentecost been renewed ? Have the cloven tongues come down again ? Where are they ? The sound filled the whole house just now . I heard the seventeen languages in full action : Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus and Asia , Phrygia and Pamphylia , in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene , strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes , Cretes and Arabians ; every one of these must have had its representative in this room two minutes since . "
3318	3327	3329	3330	Mr. Donne	195	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Helstone , "
3332	3347	3329	3330	Mr. Donne	195	" take a seat , pray , sir . Have a glass of wine ? "
3363	3447	3354	3359	The falcon in the black coat	734	" What do I talk about the gift of tongues ? Gift , indeed ! I mistook the chapter , and book , and Testament - gospel for law , Acts for Genesis , the city of Jerusalem for the plain of Shinar . It was no gift but the confusion of tongues which has gabbled me deaf as a post . You , apostles ? What ! you three ? Certainly not ; three presumptuous Babylonish masons - neither more nor less ! "
3448	3477	3180	3180	he	205	" I assure you , sir , we were only having a little chat together over a glass of wine after a friendly dinner - settling the Dissenters ! "
3478	3567	3354	3359	The falcon in the black coat	734	" Oh ! settling the Dissenters , were you ? Was Malone settling the Dissenters ? It sounded to me much more like settling his co - apostles . You were quarrelling together , making almost as much noise - you three alone - as Moses Barraclough , the preaching tailor , and all his hearers are making in the Methodist chapel down yonder , where they are in the thick of a revival . I know whose fault it is . - It is yours , Malone . "
3568	3573	3180	3180	he	205	" Mine , sir ? "
3574	3675	3354	3359	The falcon in the black coat	734	" Yours , sir . Donne and Sweeting were quiet before you came , and would be quiet if you were gone . I wish , when you crossed the Channel , you had left your Irish habits behind you . Dublin student ways wo n't do here . The proceedings which might pass unnoticed in a wild bog and mountain district in Connaught will , in a decent English parish , bring disgrace on those who indulge in them , and , what is far worse , on the sacred institution of which they are merely the humble appendages . "
3795	3800	3801	3801	he	206	" I met Supplehough , "
3804	4012	3801	3801	he	206	" plodding through the mud this wet night , going to preach at Milldean opposition shop . As I told you , I heard Barraclough bellowing in the midst of a conventicle like a possessed bull ; and I find you , gentlemen , tarrying over your half - pint of muddy port wine , and scolding like angry old women . No wonder Supplehough should have dipped sixteen adult converts in a day - which he did a fortnight since ; no wonder Barraclough , scamp and hypocrite as he is , should attract all the weaver - girls in their flowers and ribbons , to witness how much harder are his knuckles than the wooden brim of his tub ; as little wonder that you , when you are left to yourselves , without your rectors - myself , and Hall , and Boultby - to back you , should too often perform the holy service of our church to bare walls , and read your bit of a dry discourse to the clerk , and the organist , and the beadle . But enough of the subject . I came to see Malone . - I have an errand unto thee , O captain ! "
4013	4018	4020	4020	Malone	196	" What is it ? "
4023	4037	4020	4020	Malone	196	" There can be no funeral to take at this time of day . "
4038	4046	3801	3801	he	206	" Have you any arms about you ? "
4047	4058	4060	4060	he	196	" Arms , sir ? - yes , and legs . "
4066	4073	3801	3801	he	206	" Bah ! weapons I mean . "
4074	4109	3801	3801	he	206	" I have the pistols you gave me yourself . I never part with them . I lay them ready cocked on a chair by my bedside at night . I have my blackthorn . "
4110	4122	3801	3801	he	206	" Very good . Will you go to Hollow 's Mill ? "
4123	4132	3801	3801	he	206	" What is stirring at Hollow 's Mill ? "
4133	4203	3801	3801	he	206	" Nothing as yet , nor perhaps will be ; but Moore is alone there . He has sent all the workmen he can trust to Stilbro ' ; there are only two women left about the place . It would be a nice opportunity for any of his well - wishers to pay him a visit , if they knew how straight the path was made before them . "
4204	4223	3801	3801	he	206	" I am none of his well - wishers , sir . I do n't care for him . "
4224	4233	3801	3801	he	206	" Soh ! Malone , you are afraid . "
4234	4289	3801	3801	he	206	" You know me better than that . If I really thought there was a chance of a row I would go : but Moore is a strange , shy man , whom I never pretend to understand ; and for the sake of his sweet company only I would not stir a step . "
4290	4373	3801	3801	he	206	" But there is a chance of a row ; if a positive riot does not take place - of which , indeed , I see no signs - yet it is unlikely this night will pass quite tranquilly . You know Moore has resolved to have new machinery , and he expects two wagon - loads of frames and shears from Stilbro ' this evening . Scott , the overlooker , and a few picked men are gone to fetch them . "
4374	4387	3801	3801	he	206	" They will bring them in safely and quietly enough , sir . "
4388	4529	3801	3801	he	206	" Moore says so , and affirms he wants nobody . Some one , however , he must have , if it were only to bear evidence in case anything should happen . I call him very careless . He sits in the counting - house with the shutters unclosed ; he goes out here and there after dark , wanders right up the hollow , down Fieldhead Lane , among the plantations , just as if he were the darling of the neighbourhood , or - being , as he is , its detestation - bore a ' charmed life , ' as they say in tale - books . He takes no warning from the fate of Pearson , nor from that of Armitage - shot , one in his own house and the other on the moor . "
4530	4544	4546	4547	Mr. Sweeting	197	" But he should take warning , sir , and use precautions too , "
4549	4565	4546	4547	Mr. Sweeting	197	" and I think he would if he heard what I heard the other day . "
4566	4574	3801	3801	he	206	" What did you hear , Davy ? "
4575	4583	4546	4547	Mr. Sweeting	197	" You know Mike Hartley , sir ? "
4584	4591	3801	3801	he	206	" The Antinomian weaver ? Yes . "
4592	4654	4546	4547	Mr. Sweeting	197	" When Mike has been drinking for a few weeks together , he generally winds up by a visit to Nunnely vicarage , to tell Mr. Hall a piece of his mind about his sermons , to denounce the horrible tendency of his doctrine of works , and warn him that he and all his hearers are sitting in outer darkness . "
4655	4666	3801	3801	he	206	" Well , that has nothing to do with Moore . "
4667	4683	4546	4547	Mr. Sweeting	197	" Besides being an Antinomian , he is a violent Jacobin and leveller , sir . "
4684	4783	3801	3801	he	206	" I know . When he is very drunk , his mind is always running on regicide . Mike is not unacquainted with history , and it is rich to hear him going over the list of tyrants of whom , as he says , ' the revenger of blood has obtained satisfaction . ' The fellow exults strangely in murder done on crowned heads or on any head for political reasons . I have already heard it hinted that he seems to have a queer hankering after Moore . Is that what you allude to , Sweeting ? "
4784	4889	4891	4891	Sweeting	197	" You use the proper term , sir . Mr. Hall thinks Mike has no personal hatred of Moore . Mike says he even likes to talk to him and run after him , but he has a hankering that Moore should be made an example of . He was extolling him to Mr. Hall the other day as the mill - owner with the most brains in Yorkshire , and for that reason he affirms Moore should be chosen as a sacrifice , an oblation of a sweet savour . Is Mike Hartley in his right mind , do you think , sir ? "
4894	4920	3801	3801	he	206	" Ca n't tell , Davy . He may be crazed , or he may be only crafty , or perhaps a little of both . "
4921	4930	3801	3801	he	206	" He talks of seeing visions , sir . "
4931	4972	3801	3801	he	206	" Ay ! He is a very Ezekiel or Daniel for visions . He came just when I was going to bed last Friday night to describe one that had been revealed to him in Nunnely Park that very afternoon . "
4973	4983	4985	4985	Sweeting	197	" Tell it , sir . What was it ? "
4987	5028	3801	3801	he	206	" Davy , thou hast an enormous organ of wonder in thy cranium . Malone , you see , has none . Neither murders nor visions interest him . See what a big vacant Saph he looks at this moment . "
5029	5038	3801	3801	he	206	" Saph ! Who was Saph , sir ? "
5039	5107	3801	3801	he	206	" I thought you would not know . You may find it out . It is biblical . I know nothing more of him than his name and race ; but from a boy upwards I have always attached a personality to Saph . Depend on it he was honest , heavy , and luckless . He met his end at Gob by the hand of Sibbechai . "
5108	5115	3801	3801	he	206	" But the vision , sir ? "
5116	5405	3801	3801	he	206	" Davy , thou shalt hear . Donne is biting his nails , and Malone yawning , so I will tell it but to thee . Mike is out of work , like many others , unfortunately . Mr. Grame , Sir Philip Nunnely 's steward , gave him a job about the priory . According to his account , Mike was busy hedging rather late in the afternoon , but before dark , when he heard what he thought was a band at a distance - bugles , fifes , and the sound of a trumpet ; it came from the forest , and he wondered that there should be music there . He looked up . All amongst the trees he saw moving objects , red , like poppies , or white , like may - blossom . The wood was full of them ; they poured out and filled the park . He then perceived they were soldiers - thousands and tens of thousands ; but they made no more noise than a swarm of midges on a summer evening . They formed in order , he affirmed , and marched , regiment after regiment , across the park . He followed them to Nunnely Common ; the music still played soft and distant . On the common he watched them go through a number of evolutions . A man clothed in scarlet stood in the centre and directed them . They extended , he declared , over fifty acres . They were in sight half an hour ; then they marched away quite silently . The whole time he heard neither voice nor tread - nothing but the faint music playing a solemn march . "
5406	5414	3801	3801	he	206	" Where did they go , sir ? "
5415	5526	3801	3801	he	206	" Towards Briarfield . Mike followed them . They seemed passing Fieldhead , when a column of smoke , such as might be vomited by a park of artillery , spread noiseless over the fields , the road , the common , and rolled , he said , blue and dim , to his very feet . As it cleared away he looked again for the soldiers , but they were vanished ; he saw them no more . Mike , like a wise Daniel as he is , not only rehearsed the vision but gave the interpretation thereof . It signifies , he intimated , bloodshed and civil conflict . "
5527	5535	5537	5537	Sweeting	221	" Do you credit it , sir ? "
5539	5557	3801	3801	he	206	" Do you , Davy ? - But come , Malone ; why are you not off ? "
5558	5581	3801	3801	he	206	" I am rather surprised , sir , you did not stay with Moore yourself . You like this kind of thing . "
5582	5825	3801	3801	he	206	" So I should have done , had I not unfortunately happened to engage Boultby to sup with me on his way home from the Bible Society meeting at Nunnely . I promised to send you as my substitute ; for which , by - the - bye , he did not thank me . He would much rather have had me than you , Peter . Should there be any real need of help I shall join you . The mill - bell will give warning . Meantime , go - unless turning suddenly to Messrs. Sweeting and Donne - unless Davy Sweeting or Joseph Donne prefers going . - What do you say , gentlemen ? The commission is an honourable one , not without the seasoning of a little real peril ; for the country is in a queer state , as you all know , and Moore and his mill and his machinery are held in sufficient odium . There are chivalric sentiments , there is high - beating courage , under those waistcoats of yours , I doubt not . Perhaps I am too partial to my favourite Peter . Little David shall be the champion , or spotless Joseph . - Malone , you are but a great floundering Saul after all , good only to lend your armour . Out with your firearms ; fetch your shillelah . It is there - in the corner . "
5863	5878	5880	5881	Mr. Donne	195	" I never touch them . I never did touch anything of the kind , "
5883	5893	5895	5895	Sweeting	221	" I am almost a stranger to Mr. Moore , "
5897	5951	5895	5895	Sweeting	221	" If you never touched a pistol , try the feel of it now , great satrap of Egypt . As to the little minstrel , he probably prefers encountering the Philistines with no other weapon than his flute . - Get their hats , Peter . They 'll both of 'em go . "
5952	5969	5971	5971	Sweeting	221	" No , sir ; no , Mr. Helstone . My mother would n't like it , "
5973	5991	5993	5993	Donne	195	" And I make it a rule never to get mixed up in affairs of the kind , "
6021	6055	6056	6056	he	204	" he never felt more in tune for a shindy in his life , and that he wished a score of greasy cloth - dressers might beat up Moore 's quarters that night , "
6288	6292	6326	6326	his	204	" black - blue "
6354	6359	6360	6360	he	204	" Tramp , tramp , "
6382	6521	6360	6360	he	204	" through the mire - filled cart ruts , where the flags were exchanged for soft mud . He looked but for certain landmarks - the spire of Briarfield Church ; farther on , the lights of Redhouse . This was an inn ; and when he reached it , the glow of a fire through a half - curtained window , a vision of glasses on a round table , and of revellers on an oaken settle , had nearly drawn aside the curate from his course . He thought longingly of a tumbler of whisky - and - water . In a strange place he would instantly have realized the dream ; but the company assembled in that kitchen were Mr. Helstone 's own parishioners ; they all knew him . He sighed , and passed on .
6801	6811	6752	6752	she	772	" Mr. Moore is at home , I suppose ? "
6812	6823	6752	6752	she	772	" Yes , sir , but he is not in . "
6824	6833	6752	6752	she	772	" Not in ! Where is he then ? "
6834	6845	6752	6752	she	772	" At the mill - in the counting - house . "
6854	6862	6752	6752	she	772	" Are the wagons come , Sarah ? "
6947	6954	6932	6932	he	204	" I 'll go to him , "
6983	6985	6932	6932	he	204	" hands "
7051	7065	7018	7018	he	204	" Is it Joe Scott ? What news of the wagons , Joe ? "
7066	7079	7175	7176	the speaker	782	" No ; it 's myself . Mr. Helstone would send me . "
7080	7086	7018	7018	he	204	" Oh ! Mr. Malone . "
7116	7163	7175	7176	the speaker	782	" I beg you will come in , Mr. Malone . I regret extremely Mr. Helstone should have thought it necessary to trouble you so far . There was no necessity - I told him so - and on such a night ; but walk forwards . "
7370	7386	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Comfortable quarters you have here , Mr. Moore ; and all snug to yourself . "
7387	7409	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Yes , but my sister would be glad to see you , if you would prefer stepping into the house . "
7410	7444	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Oh no ! The ladies are best alone , I never was a lady 's man . You do n't mistake me for my friend Sweeting , do you , Mr. Moore ? "
7445	7466	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Sweeting ! Which of them is that ? The gentleman in the chocolate overcoat , or the little gentleman ? "
7467	7498	8330	8330	Moore	230	" The little one - he of Nunnely ; the cavalier of the Misses Sykes , with the whole six of whom he is in love , ha ! ha ! "
7499	7520	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Better be generally in love with all than specially with one , I should think , in that quarter . "
7521	7556	8330	8330	Moore	230	" But he is specially in love with one besides , for when I and Donne urged him to make a choice amongst the fair bevy , he named - which do you think ? "
7567	7576	7563	7564	Mr. Moore	230	" Dora , of course , or Harriet . "
7577	7597	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Ha ! ha ! you 've an excellent guess . But what made you hit on those two ? "
7598	7649	7563	7564	Mr. Moore	230	" Because they are the tallest , the handsomest , and Dora , at least , is the stoutest ; and as your friend Mr. Sweeting is but a little slight figure , I concluded that , according to a frequent rule in such cases , he preferred his contrast . "
7650	7670	8330	8330	Moore	230	" You are right ; Dora it is . But he has no chance , has he , Moore ? "
7671	7680	7563	7564	Mr. Moore	230	" What has Mr. Sweeting besides his curacy ? "
7700	7744	8330	8330	Moore	230	" What has Sweeting ? Why , David has his harp , or flute , which comes to the same thing . He has a sort of pinchbeck watch ; ditto , ring ; ditto , eyeglass . That 's what he has . "
7745	7758	8330	8330	Moore	230	" How would he propose to keep Miss Sykes in gowns only ? "
7759	7813	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Ha ! ha ! Excellent ! I 'll ask him that next time I see him . I 'll roast him for his presumption . But no doubt he expects old Christopher Sykes would do something handsome . He is rich , is he not ? They live in a large house . "
7814	7822	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Sykes carries on an extensive concern . "
7823	7832	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Therefore he must be wealthy , eh ? "
7833	7893	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Therefore he must have plenty to do with his wealth , and in these times would be about as likely to think of drawing money from the business to give dowries to his daughters as I should be to dream of pulling down the cottage there , and constructing on its ruins a house as large as Fieldhead . "
7894	7908	8330	8330	Moore	230	" Do you know what I heard , Moore , the other day ? "
7909	7935	8330	8330	Moore	230	" No . Perhaps that I was about to effect some such change . Your Briarfield gossips are capable of saying that or sillier things . "
7936	8015	8330	8330	Moore	230	" That you were going to take Fieldhead on a lease I thought it looked a dismal place , by - the - bye , to - night , as I passed it , and that it was your intention to settle a Miss Sykes there as mistress - to be married , in short , ha ! ha ! Now , which is it ? Dora , I am sure . You said she was the handsomest . "
8016	8234	8330	8330	Moore	230	" I wonder how often it has been settled that I was to be married since I came to Briarfield . They have assigned me every marriageable single woman by turns in the district . Now it was the two Misses Wynns - first the dark , then the light one ; now the red - haired Miss Armitage ; then the mature Ann Pearson . At present you throw on my shoulders all the tribe of the Misses Sykes . On what grounds this gossip rests God knows . I visit nowhere ; I seek female society about as assiduously as you do , Mr. Malone . If ever I go to Whinbury , it is only to give Sykes or Pearson a call in their counting - house , where our discussions run on other topics than matrimony , and our thoughts are occupied with other things than courtships , establishments , dowries . The cloth we ca n't sell , the hands we ca n't employ , the mills we ca n't run , the perverse course of events generally , which we can not alter , fill our hearts , I take it , pretty well at present , to the tolerably complete exclusion of such figments as love - making , etc . "
8235	8324	8330	8330	Moore	230	" I go along with you completely , Moore . If there is one notion I hate more than another , it is that of marriage - I mean marriage in the vulgar weak sense , as a mere matter of sentiment - two beggarly fools agreeing to unite their indigence by some fantastic tie of feeling . Humbug ! But an advantageous connection , such as can be formed in consonance with dignity of views and permanency of solid interests , is not so bad - eh ? "
8325	8328	8330	8330	Moore	230	" No , "
8373	8376	8378	8378	he	230	" Hark ! "
8380	8386	8378	8378	he	230	" Did you hear wheels ? "
8406	8417	8418	8418	he	230	" It is only the sound of the wind rising , "
8421	8447	8418	8418	he	230	" and the rivulet a little swollen , rushing down the hollow . I expected those wagons at six ; it is near nine now . "
8448	8468	8470	8470	Malone	196	" Seriously , do you suppose that the putting up of this new machinery will bring you into danger ? "
8472	8480	8470	8470	Malone	196	" Helstone seems to think it will . "
8481	8533	8418	8418	he	230	" I only wish the machines - the frames - were safe here , and lodged within the walls of this mill . Once put up , I defy the frame - breakers . Let them only pay me a visit and take the consequences . My mill is my castle . "
8534	8541	8543	8543	Malone	196	" One despises such low scoundrels , "
8552	8582	8543	8543	Malone	196	" I almost wish a party would call upon you to - night ; but the road seemed extremely quiet as I came along . I saw nothing astir . "
8583	8590	8418	8418	he	230	" You came by the Redhouse ? "
8591	8594	8543	8543	Malone	196	" Yes . "
8595	8616	8418	8418	he	230	" There would be nothing on that road . It is in the direction of Stilbro ' the risk lies . "
8617	8625	8543	8543	Malone	196	" And you think there is risk ? "
8626	8739	8418	8418	he	230	" What these fellows have done to others they may do to me . There is only this difference : most of the manufacturers seem paralyzed when they are attacked . Sykes , for instance , when his dressing - shop was set on fire and burned to the ground , when the cloth was torn from his tenters and left in shreds in the field , took no steps to discover or punish the miscreants : he gave up as tamely as a rabbit under the jaws of a ferret . Now I , if I know myself , should stand by my trade , my mill , and my machinery . "
8740	8781	8543	8543	Malone	196	" Helstone says these three are your gods ; that the ' Orders in Council ' are with you another name for the seven deadly sins ; that Castlereagh is your Antichrist , and the war - party his legions . "
8782	8829	8418	8418	he	230	" Yes ; I abhor all these things because they ruin me . They stand in my way . I can not get on . I can not execute my plans because of them . I see myself baffled at every turn by their untoward effects . "
8830	8840	8543	8543	Malone	196	" But you are rich and thriving , Moore ? "
8841	8899	8418	8418	he	230	" I am very rich in cloth I can not sell . You should step into my warehouse yonder , and observe how it is piled to the roof with pieces . Roakes and Pearson are in the same condition . America used to be their market , but the Orders in Council have cut that off . "
8930	8936	8938	8939	Mr. Moore	230	" And then to think , "
8963	9057	9058	9058	He	230	" to think that these ridiculous gossips of Whinbury and Briarfield will keep pestering one about being married ! As if there was nothing to be done in life but to ' pay attention , ' as they say , to some young lady , and then to go to church with her , and then to start on a bridal tour , and then to run through a round of visits , and then , I suppose , to be ' having a family . ' Oh , que le diable emporte ! "
9079	9101	9065	9065	he	230	" I believe women talk and think only of these things , and they naturally fancy men 's minds similarly occupied . "
9102	9109	9111	9111	Malone	196	" Of course - of course , "
9113	9119	9111	9111	Malone	196	" but never mind them . "
9151	9155	9157	9157	he	230	" Mr. Malone , "
9159	9173	9157	9157	he	230	" you must require refreshment after your wet walk . I forget hospitality . "
9174	9179	9181	9181	Malone	196	" Not at all , "
9208	9214	9216	9216	he	230	" It is my fancy , "
9218	9312	9216	9216	he	230	" to have every convenience within myself , and not to be dependent on the feminity in the cottage yonder for every mouthful I eat or every drop I drink . I often spend the evening and sup here alone , and sleep with Joe Scott in the mill . Sometimes I am my own watchman . I require little sleep , and it pleases me on a fine night to wander for an hour or two with my musket about the hollow . Mr. Malone , can you cook a mutton chop ? "
9313	9327	9375	9376	The curate	790	" Try me . I 've done it hundreds of times at college . "
9328	9356	9216	9216	he	230	" There 's a dishful , then , and there 's the gridiron . Turn them quickly . You know the secret of keeping the juices in ? "
9357	9374	9375	9376	The curate	790	" Never fear me ; you shall see . Hand a knife and fork , please . "
9486	9493	9576	9576	he	791	" Is it you , Sarah ? "
9494	9509	9576	9576	he	791	" Yes , sir . Will you come to supper , please , sir ? "
9510	9543	9576	9576	he	791	" No ; I shall not be in to - night ; I shall sleep in the mill . So lock the doors , and tell your mistress to go to bed . "
9547	9556	9558	9558	Malone	196	" You have your household in proper order , "
9583	9654	9576	9576	he	791	" You are not under petticoat government , like poor Sweeting , a man - whew ! how the fat spits ! it has burnt my hand - destined to be ruled by women . Now you and I , Moore - there 's a fine brown one for you , and full of gravy - you and I will have no gray mares in our stables when we marry . "
9655	9679	9576	9576	he	791	" I do n't know ; I never think about it . If the gray mare is handsome and tractable , why not ? "
9680	9691	9576	9576	he	791	" The chops are done . Is the punch brewed ? "
9692	9724	9576	9576	he	791	" There is a glassful . Taste it . When Joe Scott and his minions return they shall have a share of this , provided they bring home the frames intact . "

11961	11969	11972	11972	Moore	216	" Is all right , I say ? "
12003	12019	11986	11987	Some one	5537	" Ay , ay , divil ; all 's raight ! We 've smashed 'em . "

12360	12443	12495	12495	he	913	" Your hellish machinery is shivered to smash on Stilbro ' Moor , and your men are lying bound hand and foot in a ditch by the roadside . Take this as a warning from men that are starving , and have starving wives and children to go home to when they have done this deed . If you get new machines , or if you otherwise go on as you have done , you shall hear from us again . Beware ! "
12444	12486	12495	12495	he	913	" Hear from you again ? Yes , I 'll hear from you again , and you shall hear from me . I 'll speak to you directly . On Stilbro ' Moor you shall hear from me in a moment . "
12549	12589	12546	12546	he	913	" Go into the mill , Sarah - there is the key - and ring the mill - bell as loud as you can . Afterwards you will get another lantern and help me to light up the front . "

12765	12770	12747	12763	a little man in a shovel hat , sitting erect on the back of a shaggy pony	923	" rode lightly in , "
12965	13071	13199	13200	Mr. Helstone	206	" Well , Moore , what is your business with us ? I thought you would want us to - night - me and the hetman here patting his pony 's neck , and Tom and his charger . When I heard your mill - bell I could sit still no longer , so I left Boultby to finish his supper alone . But where is the enemy ? I do not see a mask or a smutted face present ; and there is not a pane of glass broken in your windows . Have you had an attack , or do you expect one ? "
13072	13088	13090	13090	Moore	230	" Oh , not at all ! I have neither had one nor expect one , "
13093	13130	13090	13090	Moore	230	" I only ordered the bell to be rung because I want two or three neighbours to stay here in the Hollow while I and a couple or so more go over to Stilbro ' Moor . "
13131	13146	13199	13200	Mr. Helstone	206	" To Stilbro ' Moor ! What to do ? To meet the wagons ? "
13147	13157	13090	13090	Moore	230	" The wagons are come home an hour ago . "
13158	13170	13199	13200	Mr. Helstone	206	" Then all 's right . What more would you have ? "
13171	13198	13090	13090	Moore	230	" They came home empty ; and Joe Scott and company are left on the moor , and so are the frames . Read that scrawl . "
13215	13291	13090	13090	Moore	230	" Hum ! They 've only served you as they serve others . But , however , the poor fellows in the ditch will be expecting help with some impatience . This is a wet night for such a berth . I and Tom will go with you . Malone may stay behind and take care of the mill . What is the matter with him ? His eyes seem starting out of his head . "
13292	13301	13090	13090	Moore	230	" He has been eating a mutton chop . "
13302	13337	13090	13090	Moore	230	" Indeed ! - Peter Augustus , be on your guard . Eat no more mutton chops to - night . You are left here in command of these premises - an honourable post ! "
13338	13346	13090	13090	Moore	230	" Is anybody to stay with me ? "
13347	13403	13090	13090	Moore	230	" As many of the present assemblage as choose . - My lads , how many of you will remain here , and how many will go a little way with me and Mr. Moore on the Stilbro ' road , to meet some men who have been waylaid and assaulted by frame - breakers ? "
13862	13866	13851	13851	your	941	" the cloth ; "
14432	14441	14442	14442	he	230	" Does your Peninsular news please you still ? "
14445	14451	14457	14458	the rector	932	" What do you mean ? "
14460	14476	14457	14458	the rector	932	" I mean , have you still faith in that Baal of a Lord Wellington ? "
14477	14485	14457	14458	the rector	932	" And what do you mean now ? "
14486	14522	14457	14458	the rector	932	" Do you still believe that this wooden - faced and pebble - hearted idol of England has power to send fire down from heaven to consume the French holocaust you want to offer up ? "
14523	14545	14457	14458	the rector	932	" I believe Wellington will flog Bonaparte 's marshals into the sea the day it pleases him to lift his arm . "
14546	14606	14457	14458	the rector	932	" But , my dear sir , you ca n't be serious in what you say . Bonaparte 's marshals are great men , who act under the guidance of an omnipotent master - spirit . Your Wellington is the most humdrum of commonplace martinets , whose slow , mechanical movements are further cramped by an ignorant home government . "
14607	14643	14457	14458	the rector	932	" Wellington is the soul of England . Wellington is the right champion of a good cause , the fit representative of a powerful , a resolute , a sensible , and an honest nation . "
14644	14706	14457	14458	the rector	932	" Your good cause , as far as I understand it , is simply the restoration of that filthy , feeble Ferdinand to a throne which he disgraced . Your fit representative of an honest people is a dull - witted drover , acting for a duller - witted farmer ; and against these are arrayed victorious supremacy and invincible genius . "
14707	14749	14457	14458	the rector	932	" Against legitimacy is arrayed usurpation ; against modest , single - minded , righteous , and brave resistance to encroachment is arrayed boastful , double - tongued , selfish , and treacherous ambition to possess . God defend the right ! "
14750	14757	14457	14458	the rector	932	" God often defends the powerful . "
14758	15055	14457	14458	the rector	932	" What ! I suppose the handful of Israelites standing dryshod on the Asiatic side of the Red Sea was more powerful than the host of the Egyptians drawn up on the African side ? Were they more numerous ? Were they better appointed ? Were they more mighty , in a word - eh ? Do n't speak , or you 'll tell a lie , Moore ; you know you will . They were a poor , overwrought band of bondsmen . Tyrants had oppressed them through four hundred years ; a feeble mixture of women and children diluted their thin ranks ; their masters , who roared to follow them through the divided flood , were a set of pampered Ethiops , about as strong and brutal as the lions of Libya . They were armed , horsed , and charioted ; the poor Hebrew wanderers were afoot . Few of them , it is likely , had better weapons than their shepherds ' crooks or their masons ' building - tools ; their meek and mighty leader himself had only his rod . But bethink you , Robert Moore , right was with them ; the God of battles was on their side . Crime and the lost archangel generalled the ranks of Pharaoh , and which triumphed ? We know that well . ' The Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians , and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea - shore ' - yea , ' the depths covered them , they sank to the bottom as a stone . ' The right hand of the Lord became glorious in power ; the right hand of the Lord dashed in pieces the enemy ! "
15056	15111	14457	14458	the rector	932	" You are all right ; only you forget the true parallel . France is Israel , and Napoleon is Moses . Europe , with her old overgorged empires and rotten dynasties , is corrupt Egypt ; gallant France is the Twelve Tribes , and her fresh and vigorous Usurper the Shepherd of Horeb . "
15112	15119	14457	14458	the rector	932	" I scorn to answer you . "
15144	15252	14457	14458	the rector	932	" Oh , in Italy he was as great as any Moses ! He was the right thing there , fit to head and organize measures for the regeneration of nations . It puzzles me to this day how the conqueror of Lodi should have condescended to become an emperor , a vulgar , a stupid humbug ; and still more how a people who had once called themselves republicans should have sunk again to the grade of mere slaves . I despise France ! If England had gone as far on the march of civilization as France did , she would hardly have retreated so shamelessly . "
15253	15272	15274	15274	Helstone	246	" You do n't mean to say that besotted imperial France is any worse than bloody republican France ? "
15277	15350	14457	14458	the rector	932	" I mean to say nothing , but I can think what I please , you know , Mr. Helstone , both about France and England ; and about revolutions , and regicides , and restorations in general ; and about the divine right of kings , which you often stickle for in your sermons , and the duty of non - resistance , and the sanity of war , and - - "
15403	15415	15438	15439	another voice	990	" Nah , maister ; did th ' wagons hit home ? "
15423	15430	15438	15439	another voice	990	" Can that be Joe Scott ? "
15431	15436	15438	15439	another voice	990	" Ay , ay ! "
15485	15535	15707	15707	somebody	996	" Ay , Mr. Moore , it 's Joe Scott . I 'm bringing him back to you in a bonny pickle . I fand him on the top of the moor yonder , him and three others . What will you give me for restoring him to you ? "
15536	15571	15707	15707	somebody	996	" Why , my thanks , I believe ; for I could better have afforded to lose a better man . That is you , I suppose , Mr. Yorke , by your voice ? "
15572	15701	15707	15707	somebody	996	" Ay , lad , it 's me . I was coming home from Stilbro ' market , and just as I got to the middle of the moor , and was whipping on as swift as the wind for these , they say , are not safe times , thanks to a bad government ! , I heard a groan . I pulled up . Some would have whipt on faster ; but I 've naught to fear that I know of . I do n't believe there 's a lad in these parts would harm me - at least , I 'd give them as good as I got if they offered to do it . I said , ' Is there aught wrong anywhere ? ' "
15868	15868	15853	15855	t ' others	1001	"
15869	15882	15837	15837	Scott	218	" Well , I am greatly obliged to you , Mr. Yorke . "
15883	15948	15853	15855	t ' others	1001	" Are you , my lad ? You know you 're not . However , here are the rest approaching . And here , by the Lord , is another set with lights in their pitchers , like the army of Gideon ; and as we 've th ' parson wi ' , us - good - evening , Mr. Helstone - we'se do . "
15969	16075	15964	15965	That individual	1003	" We 're eleven strong men , and there 's both horses and chariots amang us . If we could only fall in wi ' some of these starved ragamuffins of frame - breakers we could win a grand victory . We could iv'ry one be a Wellington - that would please ye , Mr. Helstone - and sich paragraphs as we could contrive for t ' papers ! Briarfield suld be famous . But we'se hev a column and a half i ' th ' Stilbro ' Courier ower this job , as it is , I dare say . I'se expect no less . "
16076	16096	16098	16099	the rector	932	" And I 'll promise you no less , Mr. Yorke , for I 'll write the article myself , "
16101	16160	15964	15965	That individual	1003	" To be sure - sartainly ! And mind ye recommend weel that them ' at brake t ' bits o ' frames , and teed Joe Scott 's legs wi ' band , suld be hung without benefit o ' clergy . It 's a hanging matter , or suld be . No doubt o ' that . "
16161	16173	16175	16175	Moore	230	" If I judged them I 'd give them short shrift ! "
16177	16205	16175	16175	Moore	230	" But I mean to let them quite alone this bout , to give them rope enough , certain that in the end they will hang themselves . "
16206	16221	15964	15965	That individual	1003	" Let them alone , will ye , Moore ? Do you promise that ? "
16222	16254	16175	16175	Moore	230	" Promise ! No . All I mean to say is , I shall give myself no particular trouble to catch them ; but if one falls in my way - - "
16255	16331	15964	15965	That individual	1003	" You 'll snap him up , of course . Only you would rather they would do something worse than merely stop a wagon before you reckon with them . Well , we 'll say no more on the subject at present . Here we are at my door , gentlemen , and I hope you and the men will step in . You will none of you be the worse of a little refreshment . "
16524	16751	16511	16511	he	245	" The gentlemen were ushered in at the front entrance . They found themselves in a matted hall , lined almost to the ceiling with pictures . Through this they were conducted to a large parlour , with a magnificent fire in the grate - the most cheerful of rooms it appeared as a whole , and when you came to examine details , the enlivening effect was not diminished . There was no splendour , but there was taste everywhere , unusual taste - the taste , you would have said , of a travelled man , a scholar , and a gentleman . A series of Italian views decked the walls . Each of these was a specimen of true art . A connoisseur had selected them ; they were genuine and valuable . Even by candle - light the bright clear skies , the soft distances , with blue air quivering between the eye and the hills , the fresh tints , and well - massed lights and shadows , charmed the view . The subjects were all pastoral , the scenes were all sunny . There was a guitar and some music on a sofa ; there were cameos , beautiful miniatures ; a set of Grecian - looking vases on the mantelpiece ; there were books well arranged in two elegant bookcases .
16810	16816	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" E'en as you will , "
16821	16916	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" I reckon you 're thinking of Eastern customs , Mr. Helstone , and you 'll not eat nor drink under my roof , feared we suld be forced to be friends ; but I am not so particular or superstitious . You might sup the contents of that decanter , and you might give me a bottle of the best in your own cellar , and I 'd hold myself free to oppose you at every turn still - in every vestry - meeting and justice - meeting where we encountered one another . "
16917	16931	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" It is just what I should expect of you , Mr. Yorke . "
16932	16960	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" Does it agree wi ' ye now , Mr. Helstone , to be riding out after rioters , of a wet night , at your age ? "
16961	16998	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" It always agrees with me to be doing my duty ; and in this case my duty is a thorough pleasure . To hunt down vermin is a noble occupation , fit for an archbishop . "
16999	17040	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" Fit for ye , at ony rate . But where 's t ' curate ? He 's happen gone to visit some poor body in a sick gird , or he 's happen hunting down vermin in another direction . "
17041	17053	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" He is doing garrison - duty at Hollow 's Mill . "
17054	17068	16818	16819	Mr. Yorke	245	" You left him a sup o ' wine , I hope , Bob "
17074	17081	17071	17072	Mr. Moore	230	" to keep his courage up ? "
17113	17156	17097	17097	Moore	230	" Move it , Robert ! Get up , my lad ! That place is mine . Take the sofa , or three other chairs , if you will , but not this . It belangs to me , and nob'dy else . "
17157	17170	17172	17172	Moore	216	" Why are you so particular to that chair , Mr. Yorke ? "
17183	17223	17082	17082	He	230	" My father war afore me , and that 's all t ' answer I sall gie thee ; and it 's as good a reason as Mr. Helstone can give for the main feck o ' his notions . "

17238	17269	17082	17082	He	230	" Nay ; Robert 's not ready , or rather , I 'm not ready to part wi ' him . He 's an ill lad , and wants correcting . "
17270	17280	17082	17082	He	230	" Why , sir ? What have I done ? "
17281	17289	17082	17082	He	230	" Made thyself enemies on every hand . "
17290	17315	17082	17082	He	230	" What do I care for that ? What difference does it make to me whether your Yorkshire louts hate me or like me ? "
17316	17362	17082	17082	He	230	" Ay , there it is . The lad is a mak ' of an alien amang us . His father would never have talked i ' that way . - Go back to Antwerp , where you were born and bred , mauvaise tete ! "
17363	17388	17082	17082	He	230	" Mauvaise tete vous - meme ; je ne fais que mon devoir ; quant a vos lourdauds de paysans , je m'en moque ! "
17389	17409	17411	17411	Yorke	245	" En ravanche , mon garçon , nos lourdauds de paysans se moqueront de toi ; sois en certain , "
17425	17446	17082	17082	He	230	" C'est bon ! c'est bon ! Et puisque cela m'est égal , que mes amis ne s'en inquietent pas . "
17447	17459	17082	17082	He	230	" Tes amis ! Ou sont - ils , tes amis ? "
17460	17537	17082	17082	He	230	" Je fais écho , ou sont - ils ? et je suis fort aise que l'écho seul y répond . Au diable les amis ! Je me souviens encore du moment ou mon pere et mes oncles Gérard appellerent autour d'eux leurs amis , et Dieu sait si les amis se sont empressés d'accourir a leur secours ! Tenez , M. Yorke , ce mot , ami , m'irrite trop ; ne m'en parlez plus . "
17538	17543	17082	17082	He	230	" Comme tu voudras . "

21608	21714	21605	21605	he	245	" What chance was there of reason being heard in a land that was king - ridden , priest - ridden , peer - ridden ; where a lunatic was the nominal monarch , an unprincipled debauchee the real ruler ; where such an insult to common sense as hereditary legislators was tolerated ; where such a humbug as a bench of bishops , such an arrogant abuse as a pampered , persecuting established church was endured and venerated ; where a standing army was maintained , and a host of lazy parsons and their pauper families were kept on the fat of the land ? "
21732	21784	21785	21785	he	206	" that in the course of his life he had met with two or three instances where sentiments of this sort had been very bravely maintained so long as health , strength , and worldly prosperity had been the allies of him who professed them ; but there came a time , "
21788	21847	21848	21848	he	206	" to all men , ' when the keepers of the house should tremble ; when they should be afraid of that which is high , and fear should be in the way ; ' and that time was the test of the advocate of anarchy and rebellion , the enemy of religion and order . Ere now , "
21851	21945	21848	21848	he	206	" he had been called upon to read those prayers our church has provided for the sick by the miserable dying - bed of one of her most rancorous foes ; he had seen such a one stricken with remorse , solicitous to discover a place for repentance , and unable to find any , though he sought it carefully with tears . He must forewarn Mr. Yorke that blasphemy against God and the king was a deadly sin , and that there was such a thing as ' judgment to come . ' "
21948	22042	22043	22043	he	245	" believed fully that there was such a thing as judgment to come . If it were otherwise , it would be difficult to imagine how all the scoundrels who seemed triumphant in this world , who broke innocent hearts with impunity , abused unmerited privileges , were a scandal to honourable callings , took the bread out of the mouths of the poor , browbeat the humble , and truckled meanly to the rich and proud , were to be properly paid off in such coin as they had earned . But , "
22046	22081	22043	22043	he	245	" whenever he got low - spirited about such - like goings - on , and their seeming success in this mucky lump of a planet , he just reached down t ' owd book "
22091	22123	22124	22124	he	245	" opened it like at a chance , and he was sure to light of a verse blazing wi ' a blue brimstone low that set all straight . He knew , "

22197	22244	22166	22167	Mr. Helstone	206	" Ay , ay . You 'll recollect , Mr. Helstone , that Ignorance was carried away from the very gates of heaven , borne through the air , and thrust in at a door in the side of the hill which led down to hell . "
22245	22300	22188	22189	the bourne	1199	" Nor have I forgotten , Mr. Yorke , that Vain - Confidence , not seeing the way before him , fell into a deep pit , which was on purpose there made by the prince of the grounds , to catch vainglorious fools withal , and was dashed to pieces with his fall . "
22301	22304	22306	22307	Mr. Moore	230	" Now , "
22361	22492	22345	22345	him	230	" you have both sufficiently blackballed each other , and proved how cordially you detest each other , and how wicked you think each other . For my part , my hate is still running in such a strong current against the fellows who have broken my frames that I have none to spare for my private acquaintance , and still less for such a vague thing as a sect or a government . But really , gentlemen , you both seem very bad by your own showing - worse than ever I suspected you to be . - I dare not stay all night with a rebel and blasphemer like you , Yorke ; and I hardly dare ride home with a cruel and tyrannical ecclesiastic like Mr. Helstone . "
22493	22503	22505	22506	the rector	932	" I am going , however , Mr. Moore , "
22509	22520	22505	22506	the rector	932	" Come with me or not , as you please . "
22521	22537	22539	22539	Yorke	245	" Nay , he shall not have the choice ; he shall go with you , "

22779	22836	22750	22750	He	1211	" Not a stiver , mon garçon - which means , my lad . Get up , and we 'll take a turn through the mill before the hands come in , and I 'll explain my future plans . We 'll have the machinery yet , Joseph . You never heard of Bruce , perhaps ? "
22837	22880	22902	22902	Joe	218	" And th ' arrand spider ? Yes , but I hev . I 've read th ' history o ' Scotland , and happen knaw as mich on't as ye ; and I understand ye to mean to say ye'll persevere . "
22881	22885	22750	22750	He	1211	" I do . "
22886	22900	22902	22902	Joe	218	" Is there mony o ' your mak ' i ' your country ? "
22917	22927	22750	22750	He	1211	" In my country ! Which is my country ? "
22928	22937	22750	22750	He	1211	" Why , France - is n't it ? "
22938	22965	22750	22750	He	1211	" Not it , indeed ! The circumstance of the French having seized Antwerp , where I was born , does not make me a Frenchman . "
22966	22971	22750	22750	He	1211	" Holland , then ? "
22972	22987	22750	22750	He	1211	" I am not a Dutchman . Now you are confounding Antwerp with Amsterdam . "
22988	22991	22750	22750	He	1211	" Flanders ? "
22992	23086	22750	22750	He	1211	" I scorn the insinuation , Joe ! I a Flamand ! Have I a Flemish face - the clumsy nose standing out , the mean forehead falling back , the pale blue eyes ' a fleur de tete ' ? Am I all body and no legs , like a Flamand ? But you do n't know what they are like , those Netherlanders . Joe , I 'm an Anversois . My mother was an Anversoise , though she came of French lineage , which is the reason I speak French . "
23087	23123	22750	22750	He	1211	" But your father war Yorkshire , which maks ye a bit Yorkshire too ; and onybody may see ye're akin to us , ye're so keen o ' making brass , and getting forrards . "
23124	23194	22750	22750	He	1211	" Joe , you 're an impudent dog ; but I 've always been accustomed to a boorish sort of insolence from my youth up . The ' classe ouvriere ' - that is , the working people in Belgium - bear themselves brutally towards their employers ; and by brutally , Joe , I mean brutalement - which , perhaps , when properly translated , should be roughly . "
23195	23301	22750	22750	He	1211	" We allus speak our minds i ' this country ; and them young parsons and grand folk fro ' London is shocked at wer ' incivility ; ' and we like weel enough to gi'e 'em summat to be shocked at , 'cause it 's sport to us to watch 'em turn up the whites o ' their een , and spreed out their bits o ' hands , like as they 're flayed wi ' bogards , and then to hear 'em say , nipping off their words short like , ' Dear ! dear ! Whet seveges ! How very corse ! ' "
23302	23320	22750	22750	He	1211	" You are savages , Joe . You do n't suppose you 're civilized , do you ? "
23321	23541	22750	22750	He	1211	" Middling , middling , maister . I reckon ' at us manufacturing lads i ' th ' north is a deal more intelligent , and knaws a deal more nor th ' farming folk i ' th ' south . Trade sharpens wer wits ; and them that 's mechanics like me is forced to think . Ye know , what wi ' looking after machinery and sich like , I 've getten into that way that when I see an effect , I look straight out for a cause , and I oft lig hold on't to purpose ; and then I like reading , and I 'm curious to knaw what them that reckons to govern us aims to do for us and wi ' us . And there 's many ' cuter nor me ; there 's many a one amang them greasy chaps ' at smells o ' oil , and amang them dyers wi ' blue and black skins , that has a long head , and that can tell what a fooil of a law is , as well as ye or old Yorke , and a deal better nor soft uns like Christopher Sykes o ' Whinbury , and greet hectoring nowts like yond ' Irish Peter , Helstone 's curate . "
23542	23555	22750	22750	He	1211	" You think yourself a clever fellow , I know , Scott . "
23556	23624	22750	22750	He	1211	" Ay ! I 'm fairish . I can tell cheese fro ' chalk , and I 'm varry weel aware that I 've improved sich opportunities as I have had , a deal better nor some ' at reckons to be aboon me ; but there 's thousands i ' Yorkshire that 's as good as me , and a two - three that 's better . "
23625	23915	22750	22750	He	1211	" You 're a great man - you 're a sublime fellow ; but you 're a prig , a conceited noodle with it all , Joe ! You need not to think that because you 've picked up a little knowledge of practical mathematics , and because you have found some scantling of the elements of chemistry at the bottom of a dyeing vat , that therefore you 're a neglected man of science ; and you need not to suppose that because the course of trade does not always run smooth , and you , and such as you , are sometimes short of work and of bread , that therefore your class are martyrs , and that the whole form of government under which you live is wrong . And , moreover , you need not for a moment to insinuate that the virtues have taken refuge in cottages and wholly abandoned slated houses . Let me tell you , I particularly abominate that sort of trash , because I know so well that human nature is human nature everywhere , whether under tile or thatch , and that in every specimen of human nature that breathes , vice and virtue are ever found blended , in smaller or greater proportions , and that the proportion is not determined by station . I have seen villains who were rich , and I have seen villains who were poor , and I have seen villains who were neither rich nor poor , but who had realized Agar 's wish , and lived in fair and modest competency . The clock is going to strike six . Away with you , Joe , and ring the mill bell . "
25039	25051	25115	25115	He	1275	" Eh , bien ! Tu ne déjeunes pas ce matin ? "
25081	25088	25115	25115	He	1275	" Is breakfast ready , Hortense ? "
25089	25100	25115	25115	He	1275	" Certainly ; it has been ready half an hour . "
25101	25114	25115	25115	He	1275	" Then I am ready too . I have a canine hunger . "
25397	25402	25391	25391	she	1282	" go her household ways "
25733	25737	25731	25731	she	274	" des moyens , "
25888	25937	25864	25864	she	274	" Quelle idée ! to destroy them . Quelle action honteuse ! On voyait bien que les ouvriers de ce pays étaient a la fois betes et méchants . C'était absolument comme les domestiques anglais , les servantes surtout : rien d'insupportable comme cette Sara , par exemple ! "
25938	25945	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" She looks clean and industrious , "
25950	26112	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Looks ! I do n't know how she looks , and I do not say that she is altogether dirty or idle , mais elle est d'une insolence ! She disputed with me a quarter of an hour yesterday about the cooking of the beef ; she said I boiled it to rags , that English people would never be able to eat such a dish as our bouilli , that the bouillon was no better than greasy warm water , and as to the choucroute , she affirms she can not touch it ! That barrel we have in the cellar - delightfully prepared by my own hands - she termed a tub of hog - wash , which means food for pigs . I am harassed with the girl , and yet I can not part with her lest I should get a worse . You are in the same position with your workmen , pauvre cher frere ! "
26113	26127	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" I am afraid you are not very happy in England , Hortense . "
26128	26339	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" It is my duty to be happy where you are , brother ; but otherwise there are certainly a thousand things which make me regret our native town . All the world here appears to me ill - bred mal - élevé . I find my habits considered ridiculous . If a girl out of your mill chances to come into the kitchen and find me in my jupon and camisole preparing dinner for you know I can not trust Sarah to cook a single dish , she sneers . If I accept an invitation out to tea , which I have done once or twice , I perceive I am put quite into the background ; I have not that attention paid me which decidedly is my due . Of what an excellent family are the Gérards , as we know , and the Moores also ! They have a right to claim a certain respect , and to feel wounded when it is withheld from them . In Antwerp I was always treated with distinction ; here , one would think that when I open my lips in company I speak English with a ridiculous accent , whereas I am quite assured that I pronounce it perfectly . "
26340	26359	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Hortense , in Antwerp we were known rich ; in England we were never known but poor . "
26360	26463	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Precisely , and thus mercenary are mankind . Again , dear brother , last Sunday , if you recollect , was very wet ; accordingly I went to church in my neat black sabots , objects one would not indeed wear in a fashionable city , but which in the country I have ever been accustomed to use for walking in dirty roads . Believe me , as I paced up the aisle , composed and tranquil , as I am always , four ladies , and as many gentlemen , laughed and hid their faces behind their prayer - books . "
26464	26493	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Well , well ! do n't put on the sabots again . I told you before I thought they were not quite the thing for this country . "
26494	26584	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" But , brother , they are not common sabots , such as the peasantry wear . I tell you , they are sabots noirs , tres propres , tres convenables . At Mons and Leuze - cities not very far removed from the elegant capital of Brussels - it is very seldom that the respectable people wear anything else for walking in winter . Let any one try to wade the mud of the Flemish chaussées in a pair of Paris brodequins , on m'en dirait des nouvelles ! "
26585	26636	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Never mind Mons and Leuze and the Flemish chaussées ; do at Rome as the Romans do . And as to the camisole and jupon , I am not quite sure about them either . I never see an English lady dressed in such garments . Ask Caroline Helstone . "
26637	26667	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Caroline ! I ask Caroline ? I consult her about my dress ? It is she who on all points should consult me . She is a child . "
26668	26691	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" She is eighteen , or at least seventeen - old enough to know all about gowns , petticoats , and chaussures . "
26692	26731	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Do not spoil Caroline , I entreat you , brother . Do not make her of more consequence than she ought to be . At present she is modest and unassuming : let us keep her so . "
26732	26744	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" With all my heart . Is she coming this morning ? "
26745	26761	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" She will come at ten , as usual , to take her French lesson . "
26762	26776	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" You do n't find that she sneers at you , do you ? "
26777	26832	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" She does not . She appreciates me better than any one else here ; but then she has more intimate opportunities of knowing me . She sees that I have education , intelligence , manner , principles - all , in short , which belongs to a person well born and well bred . "
26833	26842	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Are you at all fond of her ? "
26843	26917	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" For fond I can not say . I am not one who is prone to take violent fancies , and , consequently , my friendship is the more to be depended on . I have a regard for her as my relative ; her position also inspires interest , and her conduct as my pupil has hitherto been such as rather to enhance than diminish the attachment that springs from other causes . "
26918	26926	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" She behaves pretty well at lessons ? "
26927	26988	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" To me she behaves very well ; but you are conscious , brother , that I have a manner calculated to repel over - familiarity , to win esteem , and to command respect . Yet , possessed of penetration , I perceive clearly that Caroline is not perfect , that there is much to be desired in her . "
26989	27013	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Give me a last cup of coffee , and while I am drinking it amuse me with an account of her faults . "
27014	27148	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Dear brother , I am happy to see you eat your breakfast with relish , after the fatiguing night you have passed . Caroline , then , is defective ; but with my forming hand and almost motherly care she may improve . There is about her an occasional something - a reserve , I think - which I do not quite like , because it is not sufficiently girlish and submissive ; and there are glimpses of an unsettled hurry in her nature , which put me out . Yet she is usually most tranquil , too dejected and thoughtful indeed sometimes . In time , I doubt not , I shall make her uniformly sedate and decorous , without being unaccountably pensive . I ever disapprove what is not intelligible . "
27149	27173	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" I do n't understand your account in the least . What do you mean by ' unsettled hurries , ' for instance ? "
27174	27599	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" An example will , perhaps , be the most satisfactory explanation . I sometimes , you are aware , make her read French poetry by way of practice in pronunciation . She has in the course of her lessons gone through much of Corneille and Racine , in a very steady , sober spirit , such as I approve . Occasionally she showed , indeed , a degree of languor in the perusal of those esteemed authors , partaking rather of apathy than sobriety ; and apathy is what I can not tolerate in those who have the benefit of my instructions - besides , one should not be apathetic in studying standard works . The other day I put into her hands a volume of short fugitive pieces . I sent her to the window to learn one by heart , and when I looked up I saw her turning the leaves over impatiently , and curling her lip , absolutely with scorn , as she surveyed the little poems cursorily . I chid her . ' Ma cousine , ' said she , ' tout cela m'ennuie a la mort . ' I told her this was improper language . ' Dieu ! ' she exclaimed , ' il n'y a donc pas deux lignes de poësie dans toute la littérature française ? ' I inquired what she meant . She begged my pardon with proper submission . Ere long she was still . I saw her smiling to herself over the book . She began to learn assiduously . In half an hour she came and stood before me , presented the volume , folded her hands , as I always require her to do , and commenced the repetition of that short thing by Chénier , ' La Jeune Captive . ' If you had heard the manner in which she went through this , and in which she uttered a few incoherent comments when she had done , you would have known what I meant by the phrase ' unsettled hurry . ' One would have thought Chénier was more moving than all Racine and all Corneille . You , brother , who have so much sagacity , will discern that this disproportionate preference argues an ill - regulated mind ; but she is fortunate in her preceptress . I will give her a system , a method of thought , a set of opinions ; I will give her the perfect control and guidance of her feelings . "
27600	27623	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Be sure you do , Hortense . Here she comes . That was her shadow passed the window , I believe . "
27624	27654	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Ah ! truly . She is too early - half an hour before her time . - My child , what brings you here before I have breakfasted ? "
27693	27741	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" I came in haste to see how you were , Hortense , and how Robert was too . I was sure you would be both grieved by what happened last night . I did not hear till this morning . My uncle told me at breakfast . "
27742	27760	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Ah ! it is unspeakable . You sympathize with us ? Your uncle sympathizes with us ? "
27761	27793	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" My uncle is very angry - but he was with Robert , I believe , was he not ? - Did he not go with you to Stilbro ' Moor ? "
27794	27820	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Yes , we set out in very martial style , Caroline ; but the prisoners we went to rescue met us half - way . "
27821	27828	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Of course nobody was hurt ? "
27829	27852	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Why , no ; only Joe Scott 's wrists were a little galled with being pinioned too tightly behind his back . "
27853	27870	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" You were not there ? You were not with the wagons when they were attacked ? "
27871	27893	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" No . One seldom has the fortune to be present at occurrences at which one would particularly wish to assist . "
27894	27912	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Where are you going this morning ? I saw Murgatroyd saddling your horse in the yard . "
27913	27922	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" To Whinbury . It is market day . "
27923	27942	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Mr. Yorke is going too . I met him in his gig . Come home with him . "
27943	27946	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Why ? "
27947	27970	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Two are better than one , and nobody dislikes Mr. Yorke - at least , poor people do not dislike him . "
27971	27985	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Therefore he would be a protection to me , who am hated ? "
27986	28013	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Who are misunderstood . That , probably , is the word . Shall you be late ? - Will he be late , Cousin Hortense ? "
28014	28040	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" It is too probable . He has often much business to transact at Whinbury . Have you brought your exercise - book , child ? "
28041	28053	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Yes . - What time will you return , Robert ? "
28054	28071	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" I generally return at seven . Do you wish me to be at home earlier ? "
28072	28098	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" Try rather to be back by six . It is not absolutely dark at six now , but by seven daylight is quite gone . "
28099	28129	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" And what danger is to be apprehended , Caroline , when daylight is gone ? What peril do you conceive comes as the companion of darkness for me ? "
28130	28174	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" I am not sure that I can define my fears , but we all have a certain anxiety at present about our friends . My uncle calls these times dangerous . He says , too , that mill - owners are unpopular . "
28175	28243	25946	25947	Mr. Moore	230	" And I am one of the most unpopular ? Is not that the fact ? You are reluctant to speak out plainly , but at heart you think me liable to Pearson 's fate , who was shot at - not , indeed , from behind a hedge , but in his own house , through his staircase window , as he was going to bed . "
28244	28257	28259	28259	Caroline	279	" Anne Pearson showed me the bullet in the chamber - door , "
28279	28283	28284	28284	she	279	" You know , "
28287	28323	28284	28284	she	279	" there is a hedge all the way along the road from here to Whinbury , and there are the Fieldhead plantations to pass ; but you will be back by six - or before ? "
28324	28329	28331	28331	Hortense	239	" Certainly he will , "
28333	28359	28331	28331	Hortense	239	" And now , my child , prepare your lessons for repetition , while I put the peas to soak for the purée at dinner . "
28368	28380	28382	28383	Mr. Moore	230	" You suspect I have many enemies , then , Caroline , "
28385	28397	28382	28383	Mr. Moore	230	" and doubtless you know me to be destitute of friends ? "
28398	28438	28284	28284	she	279	" Not destitute , Robert . There is your sister , your brother Louis , whom I have never seen ; there is Mr. Yorke , and there is my uncle - besides , of course , many more . "
28442	28455	28457	28457	he	216	" You would be puzzled to name your ' many more , ' "
28459	28533	28457	28457	he	216	" But show me your exercise - book . What extreme pains you take with the writing ! My sister , I suppose , exacts this care . She wants to form you in all things after the model of a Flemish school - girl . What life are you destined for , Caroline ? What will you do with your French , drawing , and other accomplishments , when they are acquired ? "
28534	28589	28590	28590	She	1310	" You may well say , when they are acquired ; for , as you are aware , till Hortense began to teach me , I knew precious little . As to the life I am destined for , I can not tell . I suppose to keep my uncle 's house till - - "
28593	28601	28457	28457	he	216	" Till what ? Till he dies ? "
28602	28639	28457	28457	he	216	" No . How harsh to say that ! I never think of his dying . He is only fifty - five . But till - in short , till events offer other occupations for me . "
28640	28652	28457	28457	he	216	" A remarkably vague prospect ! Are you content with it ? "
28653	28690	28457	28457	he	216	" I used to be , formerly . Children , you know , have little reflection , or rather their reflections run on ideal themes . There are moments now when I am not quite satisfied . "
28691	28694	28457	28457	he	216	" Why ? "
28695	28705	28457	28457	he	216	" I am making no money - earning nothing . "
28706	28725	28457	28457	he	216	" You come to the point , Lina . You too , then , wish to make money ? "
28726	28773	28457	28457	he	216	" I do . I should like an occupation ; and if I were a boy , it would not be so difficult to find one . I see such an easy , pleasant way of learning a business , and making my way in life . "
28774	28784	28457	28457	he	216	" Go on . Let us hear what way . "
28785	28863	28457	28457	he	216	" I could be apprenticed to your trade - the cloth - trade . I could learn it of you , as we are distant relations . I would do the counting - house work , keep the books , and write the letters , while you went to market . I know you greatly desire to be rich , in order to pay your father 's debts ; perhaps I could help you to get rich . "
28864	28874	28457	28457	he	216	" Help me ? You should think of yourself . "
28875	28892	28457	28457	he	216	" I do think of myself ; but must one for ever think only of oneself ? "
28893	28925	28457	28457	he	216	" Of whom else do I think ? Of whom else dare I think ? The poor ought to have no large sympathies ; it is their duty to be narrow . "
28926	28932	28457	28457	he	216	" No , Robert - - "
28933	29024	28457	28457	he	216	" Yes , Caroline . Poverty is necessarily selfish , contracted , grovelling , anxious . Now and then a poor man 's heart , when certain beams and dews visit it , may smell like the budding vegetation in yonder garden on this spring day , may feel ripe to evolve in foliage , perhaps blossom ; but he must not encourage the pleasant impulse ; he must invoke Prudence to check it , with that frosty breath of hers , which is as nipping as any north wind . "
29025	29033	28457	28457	he	216	" No cottage would be happy then . "
29034	29084	28457	28457	he	216	" When I speak of poverty , I do not so much mean the natural , habitual poverty of the working - man , as the embarrassed penury of the man in debt . My grub - worm is always a straitened , struggling , care - worn tradesman . "
29085	29137	28457	28457	he	216	" Cherish hope , not anxiety . Certain ideas have become too fixed in your mind . It may be presumptuous to say it , but I have the impression that there is something wrong in your notions of the best means of attaining happiness , as there is in - - "
29141	29149	28457	28457	he	216	" I am all ear , Caroline . "
29150	29176	28457	28457	he	216	" In courage ! let me speak the truth - in your manner - mind , I say only manner - to these Yorkshire workpeople . "
29177	29191	28457	28457	he	216	" You have often wanted to tell me that , have you not ? "
29192	29200	28457	28457	he	216	" Yes ; often - very often . "
29201	29242	28457	28457	he	216	" The faults of my manner are , I think , only negative . I am not proud . What has a man in my position to be proud of ? I am only taciturn , phlegmatic , and joyless . "
29243	29268	28457	28457	he	216	" As if your living cloth - dressers were all machines like your frames and shears . In your own house you seem different . "
29269	29333	28457	28457	he	216	" To those of my own house I am no alien , which I am to these English clowns . I might act the benevolent with them , but acting is not my forte . I find them irrational , perverse ; they hinder me when I long to hurry forward . In treating them justly I fulfil my whole duty towards them . "
29334	29347	28457	28457	he	216	" You do n't expect them to love you , of course ? "
29348	29353	28457	28457	he	216	" Nor wish it . "
29354	29357	29363	29363	her	1311	" Ah ! "
29415	29436	29399	29399	she	1311	" I suppose I am not an affectionate man , Caroline . The attachment of a very few suffices me . "
29437	29456	29564	29564	he	1312	" If you please , Robert , will you mend me a pen or two before you go ? "
29457	29493	29399	29399	she	1311	" First let me rule your book , for you always contrive to draw the lines aslant . There now . And now for the pens . You like a fine one , I think ? "
29494	29511	29564	29564	he	1312	" Such as you generally make for me and Hortense ; not your own broad points . "
29512	29547	29399	29399	she	1311	" If I were of Louis 's calling I might stay at home and dedicate this morning to you and your studies , whereas I must spend it in Skyes 's wool - warehouse . "
29548	29555	29564	29564	he	1312	" You will be making money . "
29556	29562	29399	29399	she	1311	" More likely losing it . "
29586	29620	29621	29621	He	1312	" There , Fred is ready for me ; I must go . I 'll take one look to see what the spring has done in the south border , too , first . "
29714	29721	29683	29683	He	216	" Now , good - morning . "
29722	29752	29753	29753	He	1312	" Thank you , Robert . It is pretty ; it looks , as it lies there , like sparkles of sunshine and blue sky . Good - morning . "
29812	29818	29819	29819	he	1312	" I forgot my gloves , "
29842	29854	29839	29839	he	1312	" You have no binding engagement at home perhaps , Caroline ? "
29855	29884	29839	29839	he	1312	" I never have . Some children 's socks , which Mrs. Ramsden has ordered , to knit for the Jew 's basket ; but they will keep . "
29885	29975	29839	29839	he	1312	" Jew 's basket be - sold ! Never was utensil better named . Anything more Jewish than it - its contents and their prices - can not be conceived . But I see something , a very tiny curl , at the corners of your lip , which tells me that you know its merits as well as I do . Forget the Jew 's basket , then , and spend the day here as a change . Your uncle wo n't break his heart at your absence ? "
29979	29982	29976	29976	She	1323	" No . "
29983	29993	29995	29995	Moore	216	" The old Cossack ! I dare say not , "
29997	30056	29976	29976	She	1323	" Then stay and dine with Hortense ; she will be glad of your company . I shall return in good time . We will have a little reading in the evening . The moon rises at half - past eight , and I will walk up to the rectory with you at nine . Do you agree ? "
30127	30132	30135	30135	Moore	216	" Good - morning , "

31773	31803	31770	31770	she	1376	" I would employ that means often . I would keep it bright with use , and not let it lie for weeks aside , till it gets rusty . "
32080	32099	32065	32065	she	232	" I never dished such stuff i ' my life afore ; it 's not fit for dogs . "

33389	33426	33386	33387	Mademoiselle Moore	274	" consequently I feel assured that my brother will not return till then . Indeed I should be sorry if he did . We will have coffee . It would be vain to wait for him . "
33427	33441	33580	33582	the young lady	1410	" I am tired . May I leave my work now , cousin ? "
33442	33491	33386	33387	Mademoiselle Moore	274	" You may , since it grows too dark to see to do it well . Fold it up ; put it carefully in your bag ; then step into the kitchen and desire Sarah to bring in the gouter , or tea , as you call it . "
33492	33506	33580	33582	the young lady	1410	" But it has not yet struck six . He may still come . "
33507	33527	33386	33387	Mademoiselle Moore	274	" He will not , I tell you . I can calculate his movements . I understand my brother . "
33570	33578	33580	33582	the young lady	1410	" You are to bring in coffee , "
33608	33635	33590	33590	she	1410	" How low you seem , miss ! But it 's all because your cousin keeps you so close to work . It 's a shame ! "
33636	33644	33580	33582	the young lady	1410	" Nothing of the kind , Sarah , "
33650	33693	33590	33590	she	1410	" Oh ! but I know it is . You 're fit to cry just this minute , for nothing else but because you 've sat still the whole day . It would make a kitten dull to be mewed up so . "
33694	33711	33590	33590	she	1410	" Sarah , does your master often come home early from market when it is wet ? "
33712	33733	33590	33590	she	1410	" Never , hardly ; but just to - day , for some reason , he has made a difference . "
33734	33740	33590	33590	she	1410	" What do you mean ? "
33741	33792	33590	33590	she	1410	" He is come . I am certain I saw Murgatroyd lead his horse into the yard by the back - way , when I went to get some water at the pump five minutes since . He was in the counting - house with Joe Scott , I believe . "
33793	33798	33590	33590	she	1410	" You are mistaken . "
33799	33813	33590	33590	she	1410	" What should I be mistaken for ? I know his horse surely ? "
33814	33822	33590	33590	she	1410	" But you did not see himself ? "
33823	33883	33590	33590	she	1410	" I heard him speak , though . He was saying something to Joe Scott about having settled all concerning ways and means , and that there would be a new set of frames in the mill before another week passed , and that this time he would get four soldiers from Stilbro ' barracks to guard the wagon . "
33884	33893	33590	33590	she	1410	" Sarah , are you making a gown ? "
33894	33903	33590	33590	she	1410	" Yes . Is it a handsome one ? "
33904	33947	33590	33590	she	1410	" Beautiful ! Get the coffee ready . I 'll finish cutting out that sleeve for you , and I 'll give you some trimming for it . I have some narrow satin ribbon of a colour that will just match it . "
33948	33956	33590	33590	she	1410	" You 're very kind , miss . "
33957	33997	33590	33590	she	1410	" Be quick ; there 's a good girl . But first put your master 's shoes on the hearth : he will take his boots off when he comes in . I hear him ; he is coming . "
33998	34008	33590	33590	she	1410	" Miss , you are cutting the stuff wrong . "
34009	34027	33590	33590	she	1410	" So I am ; but it is only a snip . There is no harm done . "
34107	34122	34123	34123	she	279	" We had ceased to expect you . They asserted you would not come , "
34126	34141	34223	34223	He	1412	" But I promised to return soon . You expected me , I suppose ? "
34142	34182	34233	34233	him	1412	" No , Robert ; I dared not when it rained so fast . And you are wet and chilled . Change everything . If you took cold , I should - we should blame ourselves in some measure . "
34183	34222	34223	34223	He	1412	" I am not wet through : my riding - coat is waterproof . Dry shoes are all I require . There - the fire is pleasant after facing the cold wind and rain for a few miles . "
34331	34334	34336	34336	she	1416	" Oh ! "
34347	34379	34336	34336	she	1416	" I was miserable when I thought you would not come . I am almost too happy now . Are you happy , Robert ? Do you like to come home ? "
34380	34393	34308	34308	Moore	230	" I think I do - to - night , at least . "
34394	34414	34336	34336	she	1416	" Are you certain you are not fretting about your frames , and your business , and the war ? "
34415	34420	34308	34308	Moore	230	" Not just now . "
34421	34443	34336	34336	she	1416	" Are you positive you do n't feel Hollow 's Cottage too small for you , and narrow , and dismal ? "
34444	34451	34308	34308	Moore	230	" At this moment , no . "
34452	34471	34336	34336	she	1416	" Can you affirm that you are not bitter at heart because rich and great people forget you ? "
34472	34506	34308	34308	Moore	230	" No more questions . You are mistaken if you think I am anxious to curry favour with rich and great people . I only want means - a position - a career . "
34507	34530	34336	34336	she	1416	" Which your own talent and goodness shall win you . You were made to be great ; you shall be great . "
34531	34598	34308	34308	Moore	230	" I wonder now , if you spoke honestly out of your heart , what recipe you would give me for acquiring this same greatness ; but I know it - better than you know it yourself . Would it be efficacious ? Would it work ? Yes - poverty , misery , bankruptcy . Oh , life is not what you think it , Lina ! "
34599	34608	34336	34336	she	1416	" But you are what I think you . "
34609	34614	34308	34308	Moore	230	" I am not . "
34615	34622	34336	34336	she	1416	" You are better , then ? "
34623	34627	34308	34308	Moore	230	" Far worse . "
34628	34640	34336	34336	she	1416	" No ; far better . I know you are good . "
34641	34648	34308	34308	Moore	230	" How do you know it ? "
34649	34661	34336	34336	she	1416	" You look so , and I feel you are so . "
34662	34669	34308	34308	Moore	230	" Where do you feel it ? "
34670	34675	34336	34336	she	1416	" In my heart . "
34676	34696	34308	34308	Moore	230	" Ah ! You judge me with your heart , Lina : you should judge me with your head . "
34697	34722	34336	34336	she	1416	" I do ; and then I am quite proud of you . Robert , you can not tell all my thoughts about you . "
34752	34760	34762	34762	he	230	" Think meanly of me , Lina , "
34764	34798	34762	34762	he	230	" Men , in general , are a sort of scum , very different to anything of which you have an idea . I make no pretension to be better than my fellows . "
34799	34827	34868	34868	She	1417	" If you did , I should not esteem you so much . It is because you are modest that I have such confidence in your merit . "
34828	34834	34835	34835	he	230	" Are you flattering me ? "
34854	34857	34858	34858	she	1417	" No , "
34883	34897	34868	34868	She	1417	" You do n't care whether I think you flatter me or not ? "
34898	34901	34868	34868	She	1417	" No . "
34902	34912	34868	34868	She	1417	" You are so secure of your own intentions ? "
34913	34918	34868	34868	She	1417	" I suppose so . "
34919	34926	34868	34868	She	1417	" What are they , Caroline ? "
34927	34953	34868	34868	She	1417	" Only to ease my mind by expressing for once part of what I think , and then to make you better satisfied with yourself . "
34954	34966	34868	34868	She	1417	" By assuring me that my kinswoman is my sincere friend ? "
34967	34979	34868	34868	She	1417	" Just so . I am your sincere friend , Robert . "
34980	34995	34868	34868	She	1417	" And I am - what chance and change shall make me , Lina . "
34996	35003	34868	34868	She	1417	" Not my enemy , however ? "
35046	35051	35012	35013	her mistress	1415	" café au lait , "
35075	35086	35089	35089	mademoiselle	274	" the nature of coffee to be boiled in water , "
35093	35098	35089	35089	mademoiselle	274	" un breuvage royal , "
35139	35146	35131	35131	Caroline	279	" Not my enemy , Robert ? "
35160	35165	35148	35148	Moore	216	" Could I be ? "
35200	35207	35191	35191	she	279	" conduite indigne de cette méchante créature "
35339	35347	35337	35337	her	274	" ces paysannes anglaises étaient tout insupportables . "
35355	35360	35337	35337	her	274	" bonne cuisiniere anversoise , "
35411	35426	35408	35409	St. Paul	192	" it is a shame for a woman to go with her head uncovered ; "
35475	35486	35488	35489	Mr. Moore	230	" Shall I try and get you an Antwerp girl ? "
35506	35511	35488	35489	Mr. Moore	230	" Merci du cadeau ! "
35516	35542	35488	35489	Mr. Moore	230	" An Antwerp girl would not stay here ten days , sneered at as she would be by all the young coquines in your factory ; "
35546	35609	35488	35489	Mr. Moore	230	" You are very good , dear brother - excuse my petulance - but truly my domestic trials are severe , yet they are probably my destiny ; for I recollect that our revered mother experienced similar sufferings , though she had the choice of all the best servants in Antwerp . Domestics are in all countries a spoiled and unruly set . "
35799	35862	35767	35767	she	239	" She sang the songs he asked for , with feeling ; they reminded her of a parent to whom she had been truly attached ; they reminded her of her young days . She observed , too , that Caroline listened with naive interest ; this augmented her good - humour ; and the exclamation at the close of the song , "
35873	35885	35863	35863	I	0	" achieved the business , and rendered her charming for the evening .
35907	35911	36007	36007	mademoiselle	274	" As Rome , "
35916	35997	36007	36007	mademoiselle	274	" had not been built in a day , so neither had Mademoiselle Gérard Moore 's education been completed in a week , or by merely wishing to be clever . It was effort that had accomplished that great work . She was ever remarkable for her perseverance , for her industry . Her masters had remarked that it was as delightful as it was uncommon to find so much talent united with so much solidity , and so on . "
36073	36082	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" What shall we do now , Caroline ? "
36095	36103	36105	36105	she	239	" What shall we do , Robert ? "
36108	36112	36105	36105	she	239	" You decide . "
36113	36119	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" Not play at chess ? "
36120	36123	36105	36105	she	239	" No . "
36124	36131	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" Nor draughts , nor backgammon ? "
36132	36154	36105	36105	she	239	" No , no ; we both hate silent games that only keep one 's hands employed , do n't we ? "
36155	36167	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" I believe we do . Then shall we talk scandal ? "
36168	36189	36105	36105	she	239	" About whom ? Are we sufficiently interested in anybody to take a pleasure in pulling their character to pieces ? "
36190	36213	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" A question that comes to the point . For my part , unamiable as it sounds , I must say no . "
36214	36317	36105	36105	she	239	" And I too . But it is strange , though we want no third - fourth , I mean she hastily and with contrition glanced at Hortense , living person among us - so selfish we are in our happiness - though we do n't want to think of the present existing world , it would be pleasant to go back to the past , to hear people that have slept for generations in graves that are perhaps no longer graves now , but gardens and fields , speak to us and tell us their thoughts , and impart their ideas . "
36318	36333	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" Who shall be the speaker ? What language shall he utter ? French ? "
36334	36374	36105	36105	she	239	" Your French forefathers do n't speak so sweetly , nor so solemnly , nor so impressively as your English ancestors , Robert . To - night you shall be entirely English . You shall read an English book . "
36375	36381	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" An old English book ? "
36382	36498	36105	36105	she	239	" Yes , an old English book - one that you like ; and I will choose a part of it that is toned quite in harmony with something in you . It shall waken your nature , fill your mind with music ; it shall pass like a skilful hand over your heart , and make its strings sound . Your heart is a lyre , Robert ; but the lot of your life has not been a minstrel to sweep it , and it is often silent . Let glorious William come near and touch it . You will see how he will draw the English power and melody out of its chords . "
36499	36505	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" I must read Shakespeare ? "
36506	36536	36105	36105	she	239	" You must have his spirit before you ; you must hear his voice with your mind 's ear ; you must take some of his soul into yours . "
36537	36554	36084	36085	Mr. Moore	230	" With a view to making me better ? Is it to operate like a sermon ? "
36555	36590	36105	36105	she	239	" It is to stir you , to give you new sensations . It is to make you feel your life strongly - not only your virtues , but your vicious , perverse points . "
36591	36599	36601	36601	Hortense	239	" Dieu ! que dit - elle ? "
36635	36678	36105	36105	she	239	" Never mind her , sister ; let her talk . Now just let her say anything she pleases to - night . She likes to come down hard upon your brother sometimes . It amuses me , so let her alone . "
36699	36704	36705	36705	she	279	" Here 's Shakespeare , "
36708	36740	36705	36705	she	279	" and there 's ' Coriolanus . ' Now , read , and discover by the feelings the reading will give you at once how low and how high you are . "
36741	36756	36931	36931	Caroline	279	" Come , then , sit near me , and correct when I mispronounce . "
36757	36771	36705	36705	she	279	" I am to be the teacher then , and you my pupil ? "
36772	36779	36931	36931	Caroline	279	" Ainsi , soit - il ! "
36780	36794	36705	36705	she	279	" And Shakespeare is our science , since we are going to study ? "
36795	36800	36931	36931	Caroline	279	" It appears so . "
36801	36833	36705	36705	she	279	" And you are not going to be French , and sceptical , and sneering ? You are not going to think it a sign of wisdom to refuse to admire ? "
36834	36840	36931	36931	Caroline	279	" I do n't know . "
36841	36871	36705	36705	she	279	" If you do , Robert , I 'll take Shakespeare away ; and I 'll shrivel up within myself , and put on my bonnet and go home . "
36872	36880	36931	36931	Caroline	279	" Sit down . Here I begin . "
36881	36891	36893	36893	mademoiselle	274	" One minute , if you please , brother , "
36895	36930	36893	36893	mademoiselle	274	" When the gentleman of a family reads , the ladies should always sew . - Caroline , dear child , take your embroidery . You may get three sprigs done to - night . "
36935	36979	36931	36931	Caroline	279	" I ca n't see by lamp - light ; my eyes are tired , and I ca n't do two things well at once . If I sew , I can not listen ; if I listen , I can not sew . "
36980	36988	36990	36990	Hortense	239	" Fi , donc ! Quel enfantillage ! "
37001	37045	37046	37046	He	230	" Permit her to neglect the embroidery for this evening . I wish her whole attention to be fixed on my accent ; and to ensure this , she must follow the reading with her eyes - she must look at the book . "
37074	37076	37094	37094	He	230	" Coriolanus "
37138	37147	37148	37148	she	279	" There 's a vicious point hit already , "
37151	37178	37179	37179	He	230	" You sympathize with that proud patrician who does not sympathize with his famished fellow - men , and insults them . There , go on . "
37512	37517	37510	37510	He	230	" the grim appearance , "
37521	37527	37510	37510	He	230	" bearing command in it , "
37528	37537	37510	37510	He	230	" the noble vessel with its tackle torn . "
37561	37572	37558	37558	Caroline	279	" There I see another glimpse of brotherhood in error . "
37669	37677	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" Now , have you felt Shakespeare ? "
37692	37697	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" I think so . "
37698	37709	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" And have you felt anything in Coriolanus like you ? "
37710	37715	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" Perhaps I have . "
37716	37726	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" Was he not faulty as well as great ? "
37730	37755	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" And what was his fault ? What made him hated by the citizens ? What caused him to be banished by his countrymen ? "
37756	37764	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" What do you think it was ? "
37765	37769	37679	37679	Caroline	279	" I ask again -
37844	37844	37838	37838	he	1460	"
37845	37853	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" Well , answer yourself , Sphinx . "
37854	37903	37838	37838	he	1460	" It was a spice of all ; and you must not be proud to your workpeople ; you must not neglect chances of soothing them ; and you must not be of an inflexible nature , uttering a request as austerely as if it were a command . "
37904	37923	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" That is the moral you tack to the play . What puts such notions into your head ? "
37924	37961	37838	37838	he	1460	" A wish for your good , a care for your safety , dear Robert , and a fear , caused by many things which I have heard lately , that you will come to harm . "
37962	37969	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" Who tells you these things ? "
37970	38012	37838	37838	he	1460	" I hear my uncle talk about you . He praises your hard spirit , your determined cast of mind , your scorn of low enemies , your resolution not ' to truckle to the mob , ' as he says . "
38013	38023	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" And would you have me truckle to them ? "
38024	38079	37838	37838	he	1460	" No , not for the world . I never wish you to lower yourself ; but somehow I can not help thinking it unjust to include all poor working - people under the general and insulting name of ' the mob , ' and continually to think of them and treat them haughtily . "
38080	38099	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" You are a little democrat , Caroline . If your uncle knew , what would he say ? "
38100	38136	37838	37838	he	1460	" I rarely talk to my uncle , as you know , and never about such things . He thinks everything but sewing and cooking above women 's comprehension , and out of their line . "
38137	38152	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" And do you fancy you comprehend the subjects on which you advise me ? "
38153	38239	37838	37838	he	1460	" As far as they concern you , I comprehend them . I know it would be better for you to be loved by your workpeople than to be hated by them , and I am sure that kindness is more likely to win their regard than pride . If you were proud and cold to me and Hortense , should we love you ? When you are cold to me , as you are sometimes , can I venture to be affectionate in return ? "
38240	38305	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" Now , Lina , I 've had my lesson both in languages and ethics , with a touch on politics ; it is your turn . Hortense tells me you were much taken by a little piece of poetry you learned the other day , a piece by poor André Chénier - ' La Jeune Captive . ' Do you remember it still ? "
38306	38311	37838	37838	he	1460	" I think so . "
38312	38335	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" Repeat it , then . Take your time and mind your accent ; especially let us have no English u ' s. "
38369	38421	38336	38336	Caroline	279	" Mon beau voyage encore est si loin de sa fin ! Je pars , et des ormeaux qui bordent le chemin J'ai passé le premiers a peine . Au banquet de la vie a peine commencé , Un instant seulement mes levres ont pressé La coupe en mes mains encore pleine .
38422	38477	38505	38505	her	279	" Je ne suis qu'au printemps - je veux voir la moisson ; Et comme le soleil , de saison en saison , Je veux achever mon année , Brillante sur ma tige , et l'honneur du jardin Je n'ai vu luire encore que les feux du matin , Je veux achever ma journée ! "
38653	38660	38661	38661	she	279	" Is that pretty well repeated ? "
38672	38679	38643	38643	she	279	" I really do n't know . "
38680	38692	38639	38639	she	279	" Why do n't you know ? Have you not listened ? "
38693	38707	38643	38643	she	279	" Yes - and looked . You are fond of poetry , Lina ? "
38708	38735	38639	38639	she	279	" When I meet with real poetry , I can not rest till I have learned it by heart , and so made it partly mine . "
38766	38774	38775	38775	she	232	" Then the evening is gone already , "
38778	38794	38775	38775	she	232	" and it will be long , I suppose , before I pass another here . "
38820	38834	38836	38836	Robert	216	" You would have no objection to come here oftener of an evening ? "
38862	38891	38839	38839	he	216	" I like to come here ; but I have no desire to be intrusive . I am not hinting to be asked ; you must understand that . "
38892	38940	38839	38839	he	216	" Oh ! I understand thee , child . You sometimes lecture me for wishing to be rich , Lina ; but if I were rich , you should live here always - at any rate , you should live with me wherever my habitation might be . "
38941	38969	38839	38839	he	216	" That would be pleasant ; and if you were poor - ever so poor - it would still be pleasant . Good - night , Robert . "
38970	38982	38839	38839	he	216	" I promised to walk with you up to the rectory . "
38983	39037	38839	38839	he	216	" I know you did ; but I thought you had forgotten , and I hardly knew how to remind you , though I wished to do it . But would you like to go ? It is a cold night , and as Fanny is come , there is no necessity - - "
39038	39051	38839	38839	he	216	" Here is your muff ; do n't wake Hortense - come . "
39171	39191	39192	39192	he	216	" This wo n't do ! There 's weakness - there 's downright ruin in all this . However , "
39199	39226	39192	39192	he	216	" the frenzy is quite temporary . I know it very well ; I have had it before . It will be gone to - morrow . "
39941	39948	39927	39928	his niece	1506	" Good - night , uncle . "
39949	39969	39911	39911	his	1340	" Hey ! You 've been gadding abroad all day - visiting , dining out , and what not ! "
39970	39976	39927	39928	his niece	1506	" Only at the cottage . "
39977	39985	39911	39911	his	1340	" And have you learned your lessons ? "
39986	39989	39927	39928	his niece	1506	" Yes . "
39990	39996	39911	39911	his	1340	" And made a shirt ? "
39997	40003	39927	39928	his niece	1506	" Only part of one . "
40004	40052	39911	39911	his	1340	" Well , that will do . Stick to the needle , learn shirt - making and gown - making and piecrust - making , and you 'll be a clever woman some day . Go to bed now . I 'm busy with a pamphlet here . "
40254	40266	40268	40268	her	1507	" When people love , the next step is they marry , "
40271	40571	40268	40268	her	1507	" Now , I love Robert , and I feel sure that Robert loves me . I have thought so many a time before ; to - day I felt it . When I looked up at him after repeating Chénier 's poem , his eyes what handsome eyes he has ! sent the truth through my heart . Sometimes I am afraid to speak to him , lest I should be too frank , lest I should seem forward - for I have more than once regretted bitterly overflowing , superfluous words , and feared I had said more than he expected me to say , and that he would disapprove what he might deem my indiscretion ; now , to - night I could have ventured to express any thought , he was so indulgent . How kind he was as we walked up the lane ! He does not flatter or say foolish things ; his love - making friendship , I mean ; of course I do n't yet account him my lover , but I hope he will be so some day is not like what we read of in books , - it is far better - original , quiet , manly , sincere . I do like him ; I would be an excellent wife to him if he did marry me ; I would tell him of his faults for he has a few faults , but I would study his comfort , and cherish him , and do my best to make him happy . Now , I am sure he will not be cold to - morrow . I feel almost certain that to - morrow evening he will either come here , or ask me to go there . "
40750	40755	40746	40747	his niece	1506	" a fine girl . "
40888	40907	40884	40885	Mr. Helstone	206	" they were like other fools who had just paired - insensible to inconvenience just for the moment . "
40944	40947	40949	40949	she	279	" Uncle , "
40951	40971	40949	40949	she	279	" whenever you speak of marriage you speak of it scornfully . Do you think people should n't marry ? "
40972	40987	41057	41058	Mr. Helstone	206	" It is decidedly the wisest plan to remain single , especially for women . "
40988	40994	40949	40949	she	279	" Are all marriages unhappy ? "
40995	41016	41057	41058	Mr. Helstone	206	" Millions of marriages are unhappy . If everybody confessed the truth , perhaps all are more or less so . "
41017	41035	40949	40949	she	279	" You are always vexed when you are asked to come and marry a couple . Why ? "
41036	41056	41057	41058	Mr. Helstone	206	" Because one does not like to act as accessory to the commission of a piece of pure folly . "
41100	41104	41106	41106	she	279	" But why , "

41132	41164	41106	41106	she	279	" They tire of each other - they tire of each other in a month . A yokefellow is not a companion ; he or she is a fellow - sufferer . "
41198	41219	41106	41106	she	279	" One would think you had never been married , uncle . One would think you were an old bachelor . "
41220	41227	41106	41106	she	279	" Practically , I am so . "
41228	41244	41106	41106	she	279	" But you have been married . Why were you so inconsistent as to marry ? "
41245	41257	41106	41106	she	279	" Every man is mad once or twice in his life . "
41258	41278	41106	41106	she	279	" So you tired of my aunt , and my aunt of you , and you were miserable together ? "
41298	41328	41106	41106	she	279	" Did she not suit you ? Was she not good - tempered ? Did you not get used to her ? Were you not sorry when she died ? "

41361	41406	41338	41338	his	206	" understand this : it is vulgar and puerile to confound generals with particulars . In every case there is the rule and there are the exceptions . Your questions are stupid and babyish . Ring the bell , if you have done breakfast . "
42030	42071	42081	42081	his	206	" You term marriage miserable , I suppose , from what you saw of my father and mother 's . If my mother suffered what I suffered when I was with papa , she must have had a dreadful life . "
42161	42176	42156	42156	he	206	" Your father and mother ? Who has been talking to you about them ? "
42177	42198	42156	42156	he	206	" Nobody ; but I remember something of what papa was , and I pity mamma . Where is she ? "
42200	42205	42156	42156	he	206	" Where is she ? "
42226	42231	42233	42234	Mr. Helstone	206	" I hardly know , "
42236	42308	42233	42234	Mr. Helstone	206	" I was little acquainted with her . I have not heard from her for years : but wherever she is , she thinks nothing of you ; she never inquires about you . I have reason to believe she does not wish to see you . Come , it is school - time . You go to your cousin at ten , do n't you ? The clock has struck . "
42493	42500	42501	42501	she	279	" He has not his peer , "
42504	42573	42501	42501	she	279	" He is as handsome as he is intelligent . What a keen eye he has ! What clearly - cut , spirited features - thin and serious , but graceful ! I do like his face , I do like his aspect , I do like him so much - better than any of those shuffling curates , for instance - better than anybody ; bonny Robert ! "

43417	43452	43358	43358	She	303	" Then whudder awa , thou bitter biting blast , And sough through the scrunty tree , And smoor me up in the snaw fu ' fast , And n'er let the sun me see !
43453	43492	43358	43358	She	303	" Oh , never melt awa , thou wreath o ' snaw , That 's sae kind in graving me ; But hide me frae the scorn and guffaw O ' villains like Robin - a - Ree ! "
43882	43892	43865	43865	his	1340	" How am I to get through this day ? "

45340	45385	45337	45338	Miss Mary	307	" mamma and all of us . We even persuaded papa to go . Hannah would insist upon it . But he fell asleep while Mr. Langweilig , the German Moravian minister , was speaking . I felt quite ashamed , he nodded so . "
45386	45393	45395	45395	Hannah	308	" And there was Dr. Broadbent , "

45781	45796	45798	45799	Mrs. Sykes	306	" Really , since you have company already , I think we will stay , "
45801	45819	45798	45799	Mrs. Sykes	306	" We shall be quite a pleasant little party . I always like to meet the clergy . "

46269	46276	46278	46278	Eliza	312	" What a lot on 'em ! "
46284	46313	46324	46326	the young mistress	1701	" And I put off the baking to - day because I thought there would be bread plenty to fit while morning . We shall never have enow . "
46314	46322	46359	46359	she	279	" Are there any tea - cakes ? "
46328	46357	46367	46367	Caroline	279	" Only three and a loaf . I wish these fine folk would stay at home till they 're asked ; and I want to finish trimming my hat "
46362	46365	46367	46367	Caroline	279	" Then , "
46381	46413	46324	46326	the young mistress	1701	" Fanny must run down to Briarfield and buy some muffins and crumpets and some biscuits . And do n't be cross , Eliza ; we ca n't help it now . "
46414	46425	46445	46445	she	279	" And which tea - things are we to have ? "
46426	46443	46445	46445	she	279	" Oh , the best , I suppose . I 'll get out the silver service . "
46469	46478	46524	46524	she	279	" And mun we have th ' urn ? "
46479	46523	46540	46540	she	279	" Yes ; and now get it ready as quickly as you can , for the sooner we have tea over the sooner they will go - at least , I hope so . Heigh - ho ! I wish they were gone , "
46536	46539	46540	46540	she	279	" Still , "
46553	46694	47172	47172	Donne	195	" if Robert would but come even now how bright all would be ! How comparatively easy the task of amusing these people if he were present ! There would be an interest in hearing him talk though he never says much in company and in talking in his presence . There can be no interest in hearing any of them , or in speaking to them . How they will gabble when the curates come in , and how weary I shall grow with listening to them ! But I suppose I am a selfish fool . These are very respectable gentlefolks . I ought , no doubt , to be proud of their countenance . I do n't say they are not as good as I am - far from it - but they are different from me . "
47195	47203	47365	47365	he	196	" How d'ye do , Miss Helstone ? "
47374	47387	47365	47365	he	196	" Have you had a walk to - day , Miss Helstone ? "
47390	47399	47365	47365	he	196	" Have you seen your cousin Moore lately ? "
47402	47415	48825	48825	he	1777	" Does your class at the Sunday school keep up its number ? "
48817	48824	48837	48837	Donne	195	" For whom are we waiting ? "
48828	48835	48865	48865	Helstone	279	" For me , I believe , "
48860	48863	48879	48879	he	1777	" Tut ! "
48871	48877	48922	48922	himself	1777	" Let us return thanks , "
48933	48954	50034	50034	You	279	r"le which , he thought , had given him such a felicitous distinction , drawing upon him such flattering general notice .
50038	50056	50111	50111	he	216	" Fanny will tell him Mr. Helstone is with company , and then he will go away . "
50103	50110	50111	50111	he	216	" Since your master is engaged , "
50114	50142	50262	50262	She	279	" just show me into the dining - room . Bring me pen and ink . I will write a short note and leave it for him . "
50271	50286	50514	50514	she	279	" I only left the drawing - room a minute for a little quiet . "
50502	50512	50468	50468	he	230	" Shall I tell my uncle you are here ? "
50523	50545	50478	50478	his	230	" No ; I can say to you all I had to say to him . You will be my messenger ? "
50546	50551	50468	50468	he	230	" Yes , Robert . "
50552	50617	50478	50478	his	230	" Then you may just inform him that I have got a clue to the identity of one , at least , of the men who broke my frames ; that he belongs to the same gang who attacked Sykes and Pearson 's dressing - shop , and that I hope to have him in custody to - morrow . You can remember that ? "
50618	50622	50640	50640	she	1824	" Oh yes ! "
50648	50654	50468	50468	he	230	" Will you prosecute him ? "
50655	50658	50640	50640	she	1824	" Doubtless . "
50659	50664	50468	50468	he	230	" No , Robert . "
50665	50672	50640	50640	she	1824	" And why no , Caroline ? "
50673	50687	50468	50468	he	230	" Because it will set all the neighbourhood against you more than ever . "
50688	50723	50640	50640	she	1824	" That is no reason why I should not do my duty , and defend my property . This fellow is a great scoundrel , and ought to be incapacitated from perpetrating further mischief . "
50724	50794	50806	50806	he	216	" But his accomplices will take revenge on you . You do not know how the people of this country bear malice . It is the boast of some of them that they can keep a stone in their pocket seven years , turn it at the end of that time , keep it seven years longer , and hurl it and hit their mark ' at last . ' "
50798	50804	50806	50806	he	216	" A most pithy vaunt , "
50808	50853	50872	50872	She	1825	" one that redounds vastly to the credit of your dear Yorkshire friends . But do n't fear for me , Lina . I am on my guard against these lamb - like compatriots of yours . Do n't make yourself uneasy about me . "
50854	50871	50872	50872	She	1825	" How can I help it ? You are my cousin . If anything happened - - "
50875	50900	50468	50468	he	230	" Nothing will happen , Lina . To speak in your own language , there is a Providence above all - is there not ? "
50901	50912	50872	50872	She	1825	" Yes , dear Robert . May He guard you ! "
50913	50931	50468	50468	he	230	" And if prayers have efficacy , yours will benefit me . You pray for me sometimes ? "
50932	50949	50872	50872	She	1825	" Not sometimes , Robert . You , and Louis , and Hortense are always remembered . "
50950	51038	50468	50468	he	230	" So I have often imagined . It has occurred to me when , weary and vexed , I have myself gone to bed like a heathen , that another had asked forgiveness for my day , and safety for my night . I do n't suppose such vicarial piety will avail much , but the petitions come out of a sincere breast , from innocent lips . They should be acceptable as Abel 's offering ; and doubtless would be , if the object deserved them . "
51039	51048	50872	50872	She	1825	" Annihilate that doubt . It is groundless . "
51049	51187	50872	50872	She	1825	" When a man has been brought up only to make money , and lives to make it , and for nothing else , and scarcely breathes any other air than that of mills and markets , it seems odd to utter his name in a prayer , or to mix his idea with anything divine ; and very strange it seems that a good , pure heart should take him in and harbour him , as if he had any claim to that sort of nest . If I could guide that benignant heart , I believe I should counsel it to exclude one who does not profess to have any higher aim in life than that of patching up his broken fortune , and wiping clean from his bourgeois scutcheon the foul stain of bankruptcy . "
51208	51227	50872	50872	She	1825	" Indeed , I only think - or I will only think - of you as my cousin , "
51233	51312	50872	50872	She	1825	" I am beginning to understand things better than I did , Robert , when you first came to England - better than I did a week , a day ago . I know it is your duty to try to get on , and that it wo n't do for you to be romantic ; but in future you must not misunderstand me if I seem friendly . You misunderstood me this morning , did you not ? "
51313	51320	50872	50872	She	1825	" What made you think so ? "
51321	51328	50872	50872	She	1825	" Your look - your manner . "
51329	51337	50872	50872	She	1825	" But look at me now - - "
51338	51354	50872	50872	She	1825	" Oh ! you are different now . At present I dare speak to you . "
51355	51382	50872	50872	She	1825	" Yet I am the same , except that I have left the tradesman behind me in the Hollow . Your kinsman alone stands before you . "
51383	51392	50872	50872	She	1825	" My cousin Robert - not Mr. Moore . "
51393	51404	50872	50872	She	1825	" Not a bit of Mr. Moore . Caroline - - "
51441	51448	50872	50872	She	1825	" I must go , Robert . "
51449	51537	52004	52005	Joe Scott	218	" Yes , you must go , or they will come in and find us here ; and I , rather than meet all that host in the passage , will take my departure through the window . Luckily it opens like a door . One minute only - put down the candle an instant - good - night . I kiss you because we are cousins , and , being cousins , one - two - three kisses are allowable . Caroline , good - night . "
52022	52029	52089	52089	he	216	" He 's comed , sir , "
52124	52131	52204	52205	Mr. Moore	230	" raight dahn warm for Febewerry . "
52192	52202	52180	52180	he	216	" You have what is necessary , I suppose ? "
52207	52216	52361	52361	he	216	" Ay , ay ! all 's right . "
52295	52309	52333	52335	the fustian gentleman	1842	" Help yourself ; there 's water in that jar in the corner . "
52310	52331	52354	52354	he	216	" I dunnut knaw that there 's mich need , for all a body is dry thirsty in a morning , "
52343	52353	52405	52406	his visitor	1844	" Will you tak naught yourseln , Mr. Moore ? "
52398	52403	52405	52406	his visitor	1844	" Yah'd as good , "
52408	52438	52361	52361	he	216	" it ' uld set ye up wald a sup o ' this stuff . Uncommon good hollands . Ye get it fro ' furrin parts , I'se think ? "
52439	52442	52405	52406	his visitor	1844	" Ay ! "
52443	52473	52485	52485	Moore	230	" Tak my advice and try a glass on't . Them lads ' at 's coming 'll keep ye talking , nob'dy knows how long . Ye'll need propping . "
52474	52483	52405	52406	his visitor	1844	" Have you seen Mr. Sykes this morning ? "
52487	52550	52405	52406	his visitor	1844	" I seed him a hauf an hour - nay , happen a quarter of an hour sin ' , just afore I set off . He said he aimed to come here , and I sudn't wonder but ye'll have old Helstone too . I seed 'em saddling his little nag as I passed at back o ' t ' rectory . "
52591	52593	52596	52597	Harry Scott	319	" Boy "
52612	52623	52664	52668	the personage with the staff	1850	" take my horse and lead him into the stable . "
52642	52661	52664	52668	the personage with the staff	1850	" Beautiful morning , Moore . How do , my boy ? Ha ! whom have we here ? "
52670	52731	52664	52668	the personage with the staff	1850	" Sugden ! What ! you 're going to work directly ? On my word , you lose no time . But I come to ask explanations . Your message was delivered to me . Are you sure you are on the right scent ? How do you mean to set about the business ? Have you got a warrant ? "
52732	52736	52664	52668	the personage with the staff	1850	" Sugden has . "
52737	52752	52664	52668	the personage with the staff	1850	" Then you are going to seek him now ? I 'll accompany you . "
52753	52781	52664	52668	the personage with the staff	1850	" You will be spared that trouble , sir ; he is coming to seek me . I 'm just now sitting in state waiting his arrival . "
52782	52793	52852	52852	he	218	" And who is it ? One of my parishioners ? "
52856	52874	52852	52852	he	218	" It 's a friend of yours , Mr. Helstone , a gentleman you often speak of . "
52875	52889	52852	52852	he	218	" Indeed ! His name , Joe ? You look well this morning . "
52890	52909	52915	52916	the rector	932	" Only the Rev. Moses Barraclough ; t ' tub orator you call him sometimes , I think . "
52910	52913	52928	52928	himself	932	" Ah ! "
52934	52964	52852	52852	he	218	" ah ! could n't have supposed it . Why , the pious man never was a workman of yours , Moore . He 's a tailor by trade . "
52965	52986	52928	52928	himself	932	" And so much the worse grudge I owe him , for interfering and setting my discarded men against me . "
52987	53010	53018	53018	Joe	218	" And Moses was actually present at the battle of Stilbro ' Moor ? He went there , wooden leg and all ? "
53011	53016	53018	53018	Joe	218	" Ay , sir , "
53020	53053	52928	52928	himself	932	" he went there on horseback , that his leg might n't be noticed . He was the captain , and wore a mask . The rest only had their faces blackened . "
53054	53062	53073	53073	Joe	218	" And how was he found out ? "
53063	53071	53073	53073	Joe	218	" I 'll tell you , sir , "
53075	53237	53247	53247	Helstone	206	" T ' maister 's not so fond of talking . I 've no objections . He courted Sarah , Mr. Moore 's sarvant lass , and so it seems she would have nothing to say to him ; she either did n't like his wooden leg or she 'd some notion about his being a hypocrite . Happen for women is queer hands ; we may say that amang werseln when there 's none of 'em nigh she 'd have encouraged him , in spite of his leg and his deceit , just to pass time like . I 've known some on 'em do as mich , and some o ' t ' bonniest and mimmest - looking , too - ay , I 've seen clean , trim young things , that looked as denty and pure as daisies , and wi ' time a body fun ' 'em out to be nowt but stinging , venomed nettles . "
53238	53245	52928	52928	himself	932	" Joe 's a sensible fellow , "
53249	53414	53426	53427	Mr. Moore	230	" Howsiver , Sarah had another string to her bow . Fred Murgatroyd , one of our lads , is for her ; and as women judge men by their faces - and Fred has a middling face , while Moses is none so handsome , as we all knaw - the lass took on wi ' Fred . A two - three months sin ' , Murgatroyd and Moses chanced to meet one Sunday night ; they 'd both come lurking about these premises wi ' the notion of counselling Sarah to tak a bit of a walk wi ' them . They fell out , had a tussle , and Fred was worsted , for he 's young and small , and Barraclough , for all he has only one leg , is almost as strong as Sugden there - indeed , anybody that hears him roaring at a revival or a love - feast may be sure he 's no weakling . "
53415	53422	53426	53427	Mr. Moore	230	" Joe , you 're insupportable , "
53429	53611	53666	53666	he	292	" You spin out your explanation as Moses spins out his sermons . The long and short of it is , Murgatroyd was jealous of Barraclough ; and last night , as he and a friend took shelter in a barn from a shower , they heard and saw Moses conferring with some associates within . From their discourse it was plain he had been the leader , not only at Stilbro ' Moor , but in the attack on Sykes 's property . Moreover they planned a deputation to wait on me this morning , which the tailor is to head , and which , in the most religious and peaceful spirit , is to entreat me to put the accursed thing out of my tent . I rode over to Whinbury this morning , got a constable and a warrant , and I am now waiting to give my friend the reception he deserves . Here , meantime , comes Sykes . Mr. Helstone , you must spirit him up . He feels timid at the thoughts of prosecuting . "
53647	53665	53675	53675	Moore	230	" Have they been ? Are they gone ? Have you got him ? Is it over ? "
53669	53673	53675	53675	Moore	230	" Not yet , "
53679	53686	53622	53623	Mr. Sykes	292	" We are waiting for them . "
53687	53718	53727	53727	Moore	230	" They 'll not come ; it 's near noon . Better give it up . It will excite bad feeling - make a stir - cause perhaps fatal consequences . "
53719	53725	53727	53727	Moore	230	" You need not appear , "
53729	53746	53622	53623	Mr. Sykes	292	" I shall meet them in the yard when they come ; you can stay here . "
53747	53776	53791	53791	he	230	" But my name must be seen in the law proceedings . A wife and family , Mr. Moore - a wife and family make a man cautious . "
53781	53789	53791	53791	he	230	" Give way , if you please , "
53793	53847	53862	53863	Mr. Helstone	206	" leave me to myself . I have no objection to act alone ; only be assured you will not find safety in submission . Your partner Pearson gave way , and conceded , and forbore . Well , that did not prevent them from attempting to shoot him in his own house . "
53848	53860	54020	54020	Moore	230	" My dear sir , take a little wine and water , "
54013	54018	54141	54142	the host	1862	" Take another glass , "
54128	54139	54186	54186	he	206	" Quite prudent , and take them by all means , "
54175	54184	54186	54186	he	206	" You , sir , as a clergyman , "
54188	54327	54408	54408	he	1141	" may feel it disagreeable to be present amidst scenes of hurry and flurry , and , I may say , peril . I dare say your nerves wo n't stand it . You 're a man of peace , sir ; but we manufacturers , living in the world , and always in turmoil , get quite belligerent . Really , there 's an ardour excited by the thoughts of danger that makes my heart pant . When Mrs. Sykes is afraid of the house being attacked and broke open - as she is every night - I get quite excited . I could n't describe to you , sir , my feelings . Really , if anybody was to come - thieves or anything - I believe I should enjoy it , such is my spirit . "
54391	54407	54871	54871	Helstone	279	" Enough is as good as a feast , is it not , Mr. Sykes ? "
54821	54827	54977	54977	Scott	218	" lord of the creation , "
54935	54938	54977	54977	Scott	218	" Whisht ! "

54988	55005	55015	55015	Joe	218	" might we inquire if your master be within , and is to be spoken to ? "
55006	55013	54977	54977	Scott	218	" He 's within , ay , "
55018	55026	54977	54977	Scott	218	" Would you then , if you please "
55029	55031	54977	54977	Scott	218	" you "
55033	55048	55059	55059	Joe	218	" have the goodness to tell him that twelve gentlemen wants to see him . "
55049	55057	55059	55059	Joe	218	" He 'd happen ax what for , "
55061	55075	55086	55086	Joe	218	" I mught as weel tell him that at t ' same time . "
55076	55081	55086	55086	Joe	218	" For a purpose , "
55089	55109	55059	55059	Joe	218	" Please , sir , there 's twelve gentlemen wants to see ye , ' for a purpose . ' "
55110	55128	55289	55289	Moore	216	" Good , Joe ; I 'm their man . - Sugden , come when I whistle . "
55279	55287	55306	55307	Mr. Barraclough	322	" Good - morning , Mr. Barraclough , "
55295	55301	55317	55317	he	322	" Peace be unto you ! "
55321	55366	55375	55375	Barraclough	322	" I 'm obliged to you . Peace is an excellent thing ; there 's nothing I more wish for myself . But that is not all you have to say to me , I suppose ? I imagine peace is not your purpose ? "
55367	55373	55375	55375	Barraclough	322	" As to our purpose , "
55377	55410	55317	55317	he	322	" it 's one that may sound strange and perhaps foolish to ears like yours , for the childer of this world is wiser in their generation than the childer of light . "
55411	55428	55460	55460	his	322	" To the point , if you please , and let me hear what it is . "
55429	55458	55460	55460	his	322	" Ye'se hear , sir . If I can not get it off , there 's eleven behint can help me . It is a grand purpose , and "
55470	55484	55460	55460	his	322	" it 's the Looard 's own purpose , and that 's better . "
55485	55522	55460	55460	his	322	" Do you want a subscription to a new Ranter 's chapel , Mr. Barraclough ? Unless your errand be something of that sort , I can not see what you have to do with it . "
55523	55571	55574	55574	he	322	" I had n't that duty on my mind , sir ; but as Providence has led ye to mention the subject , I 'll make it i ' my way to tak ony trifle ye may have to spare ; the smallest contribution will be acceptable . "
55600	55611	55645	55645	Moore	216	" If I gave you sixpence you would drink it . "
55636	55643	55645	55645	Moore	216	" You seem a fine fellow , "
55652	55709	55773	55773	he	1896	" you do n't care for showing me that you are a double - dyed hypocrite , that your trade is fraud . You expect indeed to make me laugh at the cleverness with which you play your coarsely farcical part , while at the same time you think you are deceiving the men behind you . "
55767	55771	55869	55869	he	1896	" Mr. Moore , "
55810	55868	55869	55869	he	1896	" it might , perhaps , justly be said that reason rather than peace is our purpose . We come , in the first place , to request you to hear reason ; and should you refuse , it is my duty to warn you , in very decided terms , that measures will be had resort to "
55872	56040	56044	56049	the other members of the deputation	1899	" which will probably terminate in - in bringing you to a sense of the unwisdom , of the - the foolishness which seems to guide and guard your proceedings as a tradesman in this manufacturing part of the country . Hem ! Sir , I would beg to allude that as a furriner , coming from a distant coast , another quarter and hemisphere of this globe , thrown , as I may say , a perfect outcast on these shores - the cliffs of Albion - you have not that understanding of huz and wer ways which might conduce to the benefit of the working - classes . If , to come at once to partic'lars , you 'd consider to give up this here miln , and go without further protractions straight home to where you belong , it ' ud happen be as well . I can see naught ageean such a plan . - What hev ye to say tull't , lads ? "
56055	56060	56072	56073	Joe Scott	218	" Hear , hear ! "
56061	56070	56072	56073	Joe Scott	218	" Brayvo , Noah o ' Tim 's ! "
56081	56117	56148	56148	he	212	" Moses'll niver beat that . Cliffs o ' Albion , and t ' other hemisphere ! My certy ! Did ye come fro ' th ' Antarctic Zone , maister ? Moses is dished . "
56140	56147	56157	56157	he	212	" Noah o ' Tim 's , "
56174	56346	56157	56157	he	212	" Or iver you set up the pole o ' your tent amang us , Mr. Moore , we lived i ' peace and quietness - yea , I may say , in all loving - kindness . I am not myself an aged person as yet , but I can remember as far back as maybe some twenty year , when hand - labour were encouraged and respected , and no mischief - maker had ventured to introduce these here machines which is so pernicious . Now , I 'm not a cloth - dresser myself , but by trade a tailor . Howsiver , my heart is of a softish nature . I 'm a very feeling man , and when I see my brethren oppressed , like my great namesake of old , I stand up for 'em ; for which intent I this day speak with you face to face , and advises you to part wi ' your infernal machinery , and tak on more hands . "
56347	56360	56157	56157	he	212	" What if I do n't follow your advice , Mr. Barraclough ? "
56361	56375	56157	56157	he	212	" The Looard pardon you ! The Looard soften your heart , sir ! "
56376	56389	56157	56157	he	212	" Are you in connection with the Wesleyans now , Mr. Barraclough ? "
56390	56404	56157	56157	he	212	" Praise God ! Bless His name ! I 'm a joined Methody ! "
56405	56554	56826	56826	He	1900	" Which in no respect prevents you from being at the same time a drunkard and a swindler . I saw you one night a week ago laid dead - drunk by the roadside , as I returned from Stilbro ' market ; and while you preach peace , you make it the business of your life to stir up dissension . You no more sympathize with the poor who are in distress than you sympathize with me . You incite them to outrage for bad purposes of your own ; so does the individual called Noah of Tim 's . You two are restless , meddling , impudent scoundrels , whose chief motive - principle is a selfish ambition , as dangerous as it is puerile . The persons behind you are some of them honest though misguided men ; but you two I count altogether bad . "
56561	56825	56859	56859	he	1900	" Silence ! You have had your say , and now I will have mine . As to being dictated to by you , or any Jack , Jem , or Jonathan on earth , I shall not suffer it for a moment . You desire me to quit the country ; you request me to part with my machinery . In case I refuse , you threaten me . I do refuse - point - blank ! Here I stay , and by this mill I stand , and into it will I convey the best machinery inventors can furnish . What will you do ? The utmost you can do - and this you will never dare to do - is to burn down my mill , destroy its contents , and shoot me . What then ? Suppose that building was a ruin and I was a corpse - what then , you lads behind these two scamps ? Would that stop invention or exhaust science ? Not for the fraction of a second of time ! Another and better gig - mill would rise on the ruins of this , and perhaps a more enterprising owner come in my place . Hear me ! I 'll make my cloth as I please , and according to the best lights I have . In its manufacture I will employ what means I choose . Whoever , after hearing this , shall dare to interfere with me may just take the consequences . An example shall prove I 'm in earnest . "
56850	56857	56859	56859	he	1900	" You were at Stilbro ' , "
56861	56905	56951	56951	he	1900	" I have proof of that . You were on the moor , you wore a mask , you knocked down one of my men with your own hand - you ! a preacher of the gospel ! - Sugden , arrest him ! "
56943	56949	56951	56951	he	1900	" Both barrels are loaded , "
56953	56962	57103	57103	he	1896	" I 'm quite determined ! Keep off ! "
57090	57101	57103	57103	he	1896	" I 've not much faith i ' Moses Barraclough , "
57105	57396	57411	57411	Moore	230	" and I would speak a word to you myseln , Mr. Moore . It 's out o ' no ill - will that I 'm here , for my part ; it 's just to mak a effort to get things straightened , for they 're sorely a - crooked . Ye see we 're ill off - varry ill off ; wer families is poor and pined . We 're thrown out o ' work wi ' these frames ; we can get nought to do ; we can earn nought . What is to be done ? Mun we say , wisht ! and lig us down and dee ? Nay ; I 've no grand words at my tongue 's end , Mr. Moore , but I feel that it wad be a low principle for a reasonable man to starve to death like a dumb cratur . I willn't do't . I 'm not for shedding blood : I 'd neither kill a man nor hurt a man ; and I 'm not for pulling down mills and breaking machines - for , as ye say , that way o ' going on'll niver stop invention ; but I 'll talk - I 'll mak as big a din as ever I can . Invention may be all right , but I know it is n't right for poor folks to starve . Them that governs mun find a way to help us ; they mun make fresh orderations . Ye'll say that 's hard to do . So mich louder mun we shout out then , for so much slacker will t ' Parliament - men be to set on to a tough job . "
57397	57409	57411	57411	Moore	230	" Worry the Parliament - men as much as you please , "
57413	57433	57443	57444	the workman	1912	" but to worry the mill - owners is absurd , and I for one wo n't stand it . "
57434	57441	57443	57444	the workman	1912	" Ye're a raight hard un ! "
57446	57468	57411	57411	Moore	230	" Willn't ye gie us a bit o ' time ? Willn't ye consent to mak your changes rather more slowly ? "
57469	57484	57443	57444	the workman	1912	" Am I the whole body of clothiers in Yorkshire ? Answer me that . "
57485	57489	57411	57411	Moore	230	" Ye're yourseln . "
57490	57607	57443	57444	the workman	1912	" And only myself . And if I stopped by the way an instant , while others are rushing on , I should be trodden down . If I did as you wish me to do , I should be bankrupt in a month ; and would my bankruptcy put bread into your hungry children 's mouths ? William Farren , neither to your dictation nor to that of any other will I submit . Talk to me no more about machinery . I will have my own way . I shall get new frames in to - morrow . If you broke these , I would still get more . I 'll never give in . "
57656	57669	57816	57816	Moore	230	" failed in the disposing of a chance he was lord of . "
57825	57832	58029	58029	He	295	" I 'll never give in , "
58051	58058	58223	58223	he	295	" first of a thunder - shower "
58211	58222	58195	58195	he	295	" Is it you , William ? How are you ? "
58226	58244	58432	58432	he	295	" Middling , Mr. Hall . How are ye ? Will ye step in and rest ye ? "
58437	58450	58492	58492	William	295	" And how are you all ? How do you get on ? "
58484	58490	58492	58492	William	295	" We get on poorly , "
58494	58529	58432	58432	he	295	" we 're all out of work . I 've selled most o ' t ' household stuff , as ye may see ; and what we 're to do next , God knows . "
58530	58538	58492	58492	William	295	" Has Mr. Moore turned you off ? "
58539	58575	58432	58432	he	295	" He has turned us off ; and I 've sich an opinion of him now that I think if he 'd tak me on again to - morrow I would n't work for him . "
58576	58588	58492	58492	William	295	" It is not like you to say so , William . "
58589	58638	58432	58432	he	295	" I know it is n't ; but I 'm getting different to mysel ' ; I feel I am changing . I wadn't heed if t ' bairns and t ' wife had enough to live on ; but they 're pinched - they 're pined - - "
58639	58683	58744	58744	he	223	" Well , my lad , and so are you ; I see you are . These are grievous times ; I see suffering wherever I turn . William , sit down . Grace , sit down . Let us talk it over . "
58732	58735	58761	58761	he	223	" Whisht ! "
58756	58760	58761	58761	he	223	" Sad times , "
58764	58790	58761	58761	he	223	" and they last long . It is the will of God . His will be done . But He tries us to the utmost . "
58795	58816	58761	58761	he	223	" You 've no money , William , and you 've nothing you could sell to raise a small sum ? "
58817	58870	58761	58761	he	223	" No . I 've selled t ' chest o ' drawers , and t ' clock , and t ' bit of a mahogany stand , and t ' wife 's bonny tea - tray and set o ' cheeney ' at she brought for a portion when we were we d. "
58871	58902	58909	58910	his wife	1160	" And if somebody lent you a pound or two , could you make any good use of it ? Could you get into a new way of doing something ? "
58914	58948	58761	58761	he	223	" Ay , I 'm sure he could , sir . He 's a very contriving chap is our William . If he 'd two or three pounds he could begin selling stuff . "
58949	58955	58962	58962	William	295	" Could you , William ? "
58956	58960	58962	58962	William	295	" Please God , "
58965	58995	59005	59005	Grace	332	" I could buy groceries , and bits o ' tapes , and thread , and what I thought would sell , and I could begin hawking at first . "
58996	59003	59005	59005	Grace	332	" And you know , sir , "
59007	59057	58962	58962	William	295	" you 're sure William would neither drink , nor idle , nor waste , in any way . He 's my husband , and I should n't praise him ; but I will say there 's not a soberer , honester man i ' England nor he is . "
59058	59104	59005	59005	Grace	332	" Well , I 'll speak to one or two friends , and I think I can promise to let him have L5 in a day or two - as a loan , ye mind , not a gift . He must pay it back . "
59105	59118	58962	58962	William	295	" I understand , sir . I 'm quite agreeable to that . "
59119	59192	59221	59221	he	223	" Meantime , there 's a few shillings for you , Grace , just to keep the pot boiling till custom comes . - Now , bairns , stand up in a row and say your catechism , while your mother goes and buys some dinner ; for you 've not had much to - day , I 'll be bound . - You begin , Ben . What is your name ? "
59241	59248	59258	59258	they	1950	" God bless you , sir ! "
59249	59257	59346	59346	Sykes	292	" God bless you , my friends ! "
59369	59412	59421	59421	Moore	230	" Come , sir ; your road and mine lie partly together . Had we not better bear each other company ? We 'll bid Moore good - morning , and leave him to the happy fancies he seems disposed to indulge . "
59413	59419	59433	59433	Helstone	246	" And where is Sugden ? "
59426	59431	59433	59433	Helstone	246	" Ah , ha ! "
59435	59575	59585	59585	Moore	230	" I 've not been quite idle while you were busy . I 've been helping you a little ; I flatter myself not injudiciously . I thought it better not to lose time ; so , while you were parleying with that down - looking gentleman - Farren I think his name is - I opened this back window , shouted to Murgatroyd , who was in the stable , to bring Mr. Sykes 's gig round ; then I smuggled Sugden and brother Moses - wooden leg and all - through the aperture , and saw them mount the gig always with our good friend Sykes 's permission , of course . Sugden took the reins - he drives like Jehu - and in another quarter of an hour Barraclough will be safe in Stilbro ' jail . "
59576	59583	59596	59596	he	230	" Very good ; thank you , "
59587	59595	59773	59773	he	218	" and good - morning , gentlemen , "
59725	59748	59801	59801	He	230	" could wish Mr. Moore to take a bit of a walk up th ' Hollow . It would do him good . "
59817	59835	59801	59801	He	230	" Joe , do you know those Farrens ? They are not well off , I suppose ? "
59836	59887	59801	59801	He	230	" They can not be well off , sir , when they 've not had work as a three month . Ye'd see yoursel ' ' at William 's sorely changed - fair paired . They 've selled most o ' t ' stuff out o ' th ' house . "
59888	59896	59801	59801	He	230	" He was not a bad workman ? "
59897	59912	59801	59801	He	230	" Ye never had a better , sir , sin ' ye began trade . "
59913	59922	59801	59801	He	230	" And decent people - the whole family ? "
59923	60000	59801	59801	He	230	" Niver dacenter . Th ' wife 's a raight ca nt body , and as clean - ye mught eat your porridge off th ' house floor . They 're sorely comed down . I wish William could get a job as gardener or summat i ' that way ; he understands gardening weel . He once lived wi ' a Scotchman that tached him the mysteries o ' that craft , as they say . "
60001	60021	59801	59801	He	230	" Now , then , you can go , Joe . You need not stand there staring at me . "
60022	60031	59801	59801	He	230	" Ye've no orders to give , sir ? "
60032	60043	60398	60398	their	1974	" None , but for you to take yourself off . "
60402	60441	60378	60379	the singers	1974	" Oh ! who can explain This struggle for life , This travail and pain , This trembling and strife ? Plague , earthquake , and famine , And tumult and war , The wonderful coming Of Jesus declare !
60442	60481	60398	60398	their	1974	" For every fight Is dreadful and loud : The warrior 's delight Is slaughter and blood , His foes overturning , Till all shall expire : And this is with burning , And fuel , and fire ! "
60498	60504	60398	60398	their	1974	" I 've found liberty ! "
60505	60516	60398	60398	their	1974	" Doad o ' Bill 's has fun ' liberty ! "
60530	60567	60398	60398	their	1974	" What a mercy is this ! What a heaven of bliss ! How unspeakably happy am I ! Gathered into the fold , With Thy people enrolled , With Thy people to live and to die !
60568	60600	60398	60398	their	1974	" Oh , the goodness of God In employing a clod His tribute of glory to raise ; His standard to bear , And with triumph declare His unspeakable riches of grace !
60601	60637	60398	60398	their	1974	" Oh , the fathomless love That has deigned to approve And prosper the work of my hands . With my pastoral crook I went over the brook , And behold I am spread into bands !
60638	60681	60398	60398	their	1974	" Who , I ask in amaze , Hath begotten me these ? And inquire from what quarter they came . My full heart it replies , They are born from the skies , And gives glory to God and the Lamb ! "
60716	60745	60398	60398	their	1974	" Sleeping on the brink of sin , Tophet gaped to take us in ; Mercy to our rescue flew , Broke the snare , and brought us through .
60746	60773	60398	60398	their	1974	" Here , as in a lion 's den , Undevoured we still remain , Pass secure the watery flood , Hanging on the arm of God .
60774	60778	60398	60398	their	1974	" Here - - "
60799	60828	62887	62887	he	245	" Here we raise our voices higher , Shout in the refiner 's fire , Clap our hands amidst the flame , Glory give to Jesus ' name ! "
62890	62901	62969	62969	their	2076	" Mark and Martin , do n't anger your brother . "
62962	62967	63709	63710	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Concede , conciliate , "
63703	63707	63784	63785	Robert Moore	216	" Come in , "
63776	63780	63928	63928	she	340	" come in ! "
63920	63927	63928	63928	she	340	" Well , is it you ? "
63945	63964	63980	63980	he	230	" What are you roving about at this time of night for ? You should be at home . "
63965	63979	63988	63989	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Can a single man be said to have a home , madam ? "
63983	63986	63928	63928	she	340	" Pooh ! "
64033	64067	64075	64076	Mr. Yorke	245	" pooh ! you need not talk nonsense to me ; a single man can have a home if he likes . Pray , does not your sister make a home for you ? "
64068	64072	64075	64076	Mr. Yorke	245	" Not she , "
64078	64129	64141	64142	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Hortense is an honest lass . But when I was Robert 's age I had five or six sisters , all as decent and proper as she is ; but you see , Hesther , for all that it did not hinder me from looking out for a wife . "
64130	64139	64190	64190	she	340	" And sorely he has repented marrying me , "
64165	64188	64190	64190	she	340	" He has repented it in sackcloth and ashes , Robert Moore , as you may well believe when you see his punishment "
64196	64279	64190	64190	she	340	" Who would burden themselves with such a set of great , rough lads as those , if they could help it ? It is not only bringing them into the world , though that is bad enough , but they are all to feed , to clothe , to rear , to settle in life . Young sir , when you feel tempted to marry , think of our four sons and two daughters , and look twice before you leap . "
64280	64304	64330	64330	she	340	" I am not tempted now , at any rate . I think these are not times for marrying or giving in marriage . "
64333	64380	64436	64436	she	342	" I make little account of the wisdom of a Solomon of your age ; it will be upset by the first fancy that crosses you . Meantime , sit down , sir . You can talk , I suppose , as well sitting as standing ? "
64427	64434	64436	64436	she	342	" You talk of marrying him , "
64453	64496	64436	64436	she	342	" and he is married now , or as good . He promised that I should be his wife last summer , the first time he saw me in my new white frock and blue sash . Did n't he , father ? "
64514	64519	64436	64436	she	342	" namby - pamby . "
64520	64554	64571	64571	Jessy	342	" Ay , my little lassie , he promised ; I 'll bear witness . But make him say it over again now , Jessy . Such as he are only false loons . "
64555	64569	64592	64593	Mr. Yorke	245	" He is not false . He is too bonny to be false , "
64587	64590	64592	64593	Mr. Yorke	245	" Bonny ! "
64595	64614	64633	64634	the father	1944	" That 's the reason that he should be , and proof that he is , a scoundrel . "
64615	64625	64633	64634	the father	1944	" But he looks too sorrowful to be false , "
64638	64659	64675	64676	Mr. Yorke	245	" If he was always laughing , I should think he forgot promises soon , but Mr. Moore never laughs . "
64660	64673	64686	64686	Rose	341	" Your sentimental buck is the greatest cheat of all , Rose , "
64678	64684	64633	64634	the father	1944	" He 's not sentimental , "
64704	64716	64633	64634	the father	1944	" How do you know I am not sentimental , Rose ? "
64717	64728	64738	64739	Mr. Yorke	245	" Because I heard a lady say you were not . "
64729	64736	64738	64739	Mr. Yorke	245	" Voila , qui devient intéressant ! "
64748	64783	64802	64802	her	340	" A lady ! That has quite a romantic twang . We must guess who it is . - Rosy , whisper the name low to your father . Do n't let him hear . "
64784	64795	64798	64799	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Rose , do n't be too forward to talk , "
64809	64832	64843	64843	Jessy	342	" nor Jessy either . It becomes all children , especially girls , to be silent in the presence of their elders . "
64833	64841	64881	64881	she	341	" Why have we tongues , then ? "
64884	64892	64881	64881	she	341	" And why especially girls , mother ? "
64893	64915	64923	64923	Moore	230	" Firstly , because I say so ; and secondly , because discretion and reserve are a girl 's best wisdom . "
64916	64921	64923	64923	Moore	230	" My dear madam , "
64925	64985	64993	64993	Jessy	342	" what you say is excellent - it reminds me , indeed , of my dear sister 's observations ; but really it is not applicable to these little ones . Let Rose and Jessy talk to me freely , or my chief pleasure in coming here is gone . I like their prattle ; it does me good . "
64986	64991	64993	64993	Jessy	342	" Does it not ? "
64995	65017	64881	64881	she	341	" More good than if the rough lads came round you . - You call them rough , mother , yourself . "
65018	65042	65052	65052	she	2125	" Yes , mignonne , a thousand times more good . I have rough lads enough about me all day long , poulet . "
65043	65050	65147	65147	she	2126	" There are plenty of people , "
65054	65145	65444	65445	Mr. Moore	230	" who take notice of the boys . All my uncles and aunts seem to think their nephews better than their nieces , and when gentlemen come here to dine , it is always Matthew , and Mark , and Martin that are talked to , and never Rose and me . Mr. Moore is our friend , and we 'll keep him . - But mind , Rose , he 's not so much your friend as he is mine . He is my particular acquaintance ; remember that ! "
65423	65442	65465	65465	She	341	" Now , Rose , tell me the name of this lady who denied that I was sentimental , "
65469	65481	65465	65465	She	341	" I ca n't . I do n't know her name . "
65482	65499	65465	65465	She	341	" Describe her to me . What was she like ? Where did you see her ? "
65500	65555	65465	65465	She	341	" When Jessy and I went to spend the day at Whinbury with Kate and Susan Pearson , who were just come home from school , there was a party at Mrs. Pearson 's , and some grown - up ladies were sitting in a corner of the drawing - room talking about you . "
65556	65564	65465	65465	She	341	" Did you know none of them ? "
65565	65578	65465	65465	She	341	" Hannah , and Harriet , and Dora , and Mary Sykes . "
65579	65589	65465	65465	She	341	" Good . Were they abusing me , Rosy ? "
65590	65626	65465	65465	She	341	" Some of them were . They called you a misanthrope . I remember the word . I looked for it in the dictionary when I came home . It means a man - hater . "
65627	65631	65465	65465	She	341	" What besides ? "
65632	65642	65648	65649	Mr. Yorke	245	" Hannah Sykes said you were a solemn puppy . "
65643	65646	65648	65649	Mr. Yorke	245	" Better ! "
65653	65678	65692	65692	Moore	230	" Oh , excellent ! Hannah ! that 's the one with the red hair - a fine girl , but half - witted . "
65679	65690	65692	65692	Moore	230	" She has wit enough for me , it appears , "
65694	65708	65465	65465	She	341	" A solemn puppy , indeed ! Well , Rose , go on . "
65709	65746	65775	65775	she	340	" Miss Pearson said she believed there was a good deal of affectation about you , and that with your dark hair and pale face you looked to her like some sort of a sentimental noodle . "
65760	65773	65775	65775	she	340	" You see in what esteem you are held behind your back , "
65777	65809	65820	65820	Moore	230	" yet I believe that Miss Pearson would like to catch you . She set her cap at you when you first came into the country , old as she is . "
65810	65818	65465	65465	She	341	" And who contradicted her , Rosy ? "
65822	65922	65933	65933	Jessy	342	" A lady whom I do n't know , because she never visits here , though I see her every Sunday at church . She sits in the pew near the pulpit . I generally look at her , instead of looking at my prayer - book , for she is like a picture in our dining - room , that woman with the dove in her hand - at least she has eyes like it , and a nose too , a straight nose , that makes all her face look , somehow , what I call clear . "
65923	65931	65933	65933	Jessy	342	" And you do n't know her ! "
65942	66116	66248	66248	Moore	216	" That 's so like Rose . Mr. Moore , I often wonder in what sort of a world my sister lives . I am sure she does not live all her time in this . One is continually finding out that she is quite ignorant of some little matter which everybody else knows . To think of her going solemnly to church every Sunday , and looking all service - time at one particular person , and never so much as asking that person 's name . She means Caroline Helstone , the rector 's niece . I remember all about it . Miss Helstone was quite angry with Anne Pearson . She said , ' Robert Moore is neither affected nor sentimental ; you mistake his character utterly , or rather not one of you here knows anything about it . ' Now , shall I tell you what she is like ? I can tell what people are like , and how they are dressed , better than Rose can . "
66117	66122	65933	65933	Jessy	342	" Let us hear . "
66123	66247	66271	66271	he	216	" She is nice ; she is fair ; she has a pretty white slender throat ; she has long curls , not stiff ones - they hang loose and soft , their colour is brown but not dark ; she speaks quietly , with a clear tone ; she never makes a bustle in moving ; she often wears a gray silk dress ; she is neat all over - her gowns , and her shoes , and her gloves always fit her . She is what I call a lady , and when I am as tall as she is , I mean to be like her . Shall I suit you if I am ? Will you really marry me ? "
66279	66293	66271	66271	he	216	" Oh ! you wo n't have me ? You push me away . "
66294	66316	66271	66271	he	216	" Why , Jessy , you care nothing about me . You never come to see me now at the Hollow . "
66317	66325	66389	66392	one of the boys	2136	" Because you do n't ask me . "
66398	66434	66440	66441	his father	5844	" I know that Miss Helstone you have all been palavering about . She 's an ugly girl . I hate her . I hate all womenites . I wonder what they were made for . "
66435	66438	66518	66519	The senior	2141	" Martin ! "
66472	66517	66518	66519	The senior	2141	" Martin , my lad , thou'rt a swaggering whelp now ; thou wilt some day be an outrageous puppy . But stick to those sentiments of thine . See , I 'll write down the words now i ' my pocket - book . "
66533	66559	66440	66441	his father	5844	" Ten years hence , Martin , if thou and I be both alive at that day , I 'll remind thee of that speech . "
66560	66607	66621	66622	his wife	1160	" I 'll say the same then . I mean always to hate women . They 're such dolls ; they do nothing but dress themselves finely , and go swimming about to be admired . I 'll never marry . I 'll be a bachelor . "
66608	66619	66621	66622	his wife	1160	" Stick to it ! stick to it ! - Hesther "
66624	66726	66440	66441	his father	5844	" I was like him when I was his age - a regular misogamist ; and , behold ! by the time I was three - and - twenty - being then a tourist in France and Italy , and the Lord knows where - I curled my hair every night before I went to bed , and wore a ring i ' my ear , and would have worn one i ' my nose if it had been the fashion , and all that I might make myself pleasing and charming to the ladies . Martin will do the like . "
66727	66862	66621	66622	his wife	1160	" Will I ? Never ! I 've more sense . What a guy you were , father ! As to dressing , I make this vow : I 'll never dress more finely than as you see me at present . - Mr. Moore , I 'm clad in blue cloth from top to toe , and they laugh at me , and call me sailor at the grammar - school . I laugh louder at them , and say they are all magpies and parrots , with their coats one colour , and their waistcoats another , and their trousers a third . I 'll always wear blue cloth , and nothing but blue cloth . It is beneath a human being 's dignity to dress himself in parti - coloured garments . "
66863	66898	66965	66965	he	344	" Ten years hence , Martin , no tailor 's shop will have choice of colours varied enough for thy exacting taste ; no perfumer 's stores essences exquisite enough for thy fastidious senses . "
66959	66963	66965	66965	he	344	" Mr. Moore , "
66967	67117	67154	67155	Mr. Moore	230	" you think perhaps it was a compliment on Miss Caroline Helstone 's part to say you were not sentimental . I thought you appeared confused when my sisters told you the words , as if you felt flattered . You turned red , just like a certain vain little lad at our school , who always thinks proper to blush when he gets a rise in the class . For your benefit , Mr. Moore , I 've been looking up the word ' sentimental ' in the dictionary , and I find it to mean ' tinctured with sentiment . ' On examining further , ' sentiment ' is explained to be thought , idea , notion . A sentimental man , then , is one who has thoughts , ideas , notions ; an unsentimental man is one destitute of thought , idea , or notion . "
67145	67152	67154	67155	Mr. Moore	230	" Ma foi ! mon ami , "
67159	67169	67154	67155	Mr. Moore	230	" ce sont vraiment des enfants terribles , que les v"tres
67171	67171	67203	67203	she	341	"
67188	67201	67203	67203	she	341	" There are different kinds of thoughts , ideas , and notions , "
67205	67241	67252	67252	Moore	230	" good and bad . Sentimental must refer to the bad , or Miss Helstone must have taken it in that sense , for she was not blaming Mr. Moore ; she was defending him . "
67242	67250	67267	67267	Rose	341	" That 's my kind little advocate ! "
67259	67265	67267	67267	Rose	341	" She was defending him , "
67269	67291	67301	67301	Martin	345	" as I should have done had I been in her place , for the other ladies seemed to speak spitefully . "
67292	67299	67301	67301	Martin	345	" Ladies always do speak spitefully , "
67303	67314	67315	67315	Matthew	343	" It is the nature of womenites to be spiteful . "
67327	67345	67366	67366	Martin	345	" What a fool Martin is , to be always gabbling about what he does not understand ! "
67346	67364	67385	67387	the elder brother	2143	" It is my privilege , as a freeman , to gabble on whatever subject I like , "
67368	67383	67385	67387	the elder brother	2143	" You use it , or rather abuse it , to such an extent , "
67389	67401	67423	67423	he	345	" that you prove you ought to have been a slave . "
67402	67422	67423	67423	he	345	" A slave ! a slave ! That to a Yorke , and from a Yorke ! This fellow , "
67439	67483	67489	67489	Matthew	343	" this fellow forgets , what every cottier in Briarfield knows , that all born of our house have that arched instep under which water can flow - proof that there has not been a slave of the blood for three hundred years . "
67484	67487	67499	67500	Mr. Yorke	245	" Mountebank ! "
67491	67497	67499	67500	Mr. Yorke	245	" Lads , be silent ! "
67503	67523	67565	67566	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Martin , you are a mischief - maker . There would have been no disturbance but for you . "
67524	67554	67562	67562	Matthew	343	" Indeed ! Is that correct ? Did I begin , or did Matthew ? Had I spoken to him when he accused me of gabbling like a fool ? "
67555	67560	67627	67627	Martin	345	" A presumptuous fool ! "
67599	67625	67652	67653	Mr. Yorke	245	" I do n't see why I should bear insolence from Matthew Yorke , or what right he has to use bad language to me , "
67629	67650	67669	67669	Martin	345	" He has no right , my lad ; but forgive your brother until seventy - and - seven times , "
67656	67667	67689	67690	the father	1944	" Always alike , and theory and practice always adverse ! "
67678	67687	67689	67690	the father	1944	" Where art thou going , my son ? "
67692	67713	67754	67754	he	345	" Somewhere where I shall be safe from insult , if in this house I can find any such place . "
67742	67753	67785	67785	Rose	341	" I suppose there is no objection to my withdrawing ? "
67757	67772	67811	67811	she	341	" No . Go , my lad ; but remember not to bear malice . "
67819	67843	67923	67923	he	230	" Martin is grieved , and you are glad ; but I would rather be Martin than you . I dislike your nature . "
67929	67938	67968	67968	Moore	230	" May I speak a word with you ? "
67957	67966	67923	67923	he	230	" Have you employment for a good workman ? "
67970	67997	67923	67923	he	230	" A nonsense question in these times , when you know that every master has many good workmen to whom he can not give full employment . "
67998	68012	67923	67923	he	230	" You must oblige me by taking on this man , if possible . "
68013	68029	67923	67923	he	230	" My lad , I can take on no more hands to oblige all England . "
68030	68044	67923	67923	he	230	" It does not signify ; I must find him a place somewhere . "
68045	68050	67923	67923	he	230	" Who is he ? "
68051	68055	67923	67923	he	230	" William Farren . "
68056	68070	67923	67923	he	230	" I know William . A right - down honest man is William . "
68071	68207	67923	67923	he	230	" He has been out of work three months . He has a large family . We are sure they can not live without wages . He was one of the deputation of cloth - dressers who came to me this morning to complain and threaten . William did not threaten . He only asked me to give them rather more time - to make my changes more slowly . You know I can not do that : straitened on all sides as I am , I have nothing for it but to push on . I thought it would be idle to palaver long with them . I sent them away , after arresting a rascal amongst them , whom I hope to transport - a fellow who preaches at the chapel yonder sometimes . "
68208	68213	67923	67923	he	230	" Not Moses Barraclough ? "
68214	68217	67923	67923	he	230	" Yes . "
68218	68248	67923	67923	he	230	" Ah ! you 've arrested him ? Good ! Then out of a scoundrel you 're going to make a martyr . You 've done a wise thing . "
68249	68287	68297	68298	Mr. Yorke	245	" I 've done a right thing . Well , the short and the long of it is , I 'm determined to get Farren a place , and I reckon on you to give him one . "
68288	68295	68297	68298	Mr. Yorke	245	" This is cool , however ! "
68300	68371	67923	67923	he	230	" What right have you to reckon on me to provide for your dismissed workmen ? What do I know about your Farrens and your Williams ? I 've heard he 's an honest man , but am I to support all the honest men in Yorkshire ? You may say that would be no great charge to undertake ; but great or little , I 'll none of it . "
68372	68387	68297	68298	Mr. Yorke	245	" Come , Mr. Yorke , what can you find for him to do ? "
68388	68420	67923	67923	he	230	" I find ! You 'll make me use language I 'm not accustomed to use . I wish you would go home . Here is the door ; set off . "
68431	68460	67923	67923	he	230	" You ca n't give him work in your mill - good ; but you have land . Find him some occupation on your land , Mr. Yorke . "
68461	68482	67923	67923	he	230	" Bob , I thought you cared nothing about our lourdauds de paysans . I do n't understand this change . "
68483	68551	67923	67923	he	230	" I do . The fellow spoke to me nothing but truth and sense . I answered him just as roughly as I did the rest , who jabbered mere gibberish . I could n't make distinctions there and then . His appearance told what he had gone through lately clearer than his words ; but where is the use of explaining ? Let him have work . "
68552	68572	67923	67923	he	230	" Let him have it yourself . If you are so very much in earnest , strain a point . "
68573	68714	68735	68736	Mr. Yorke	245	" If there was a point left in my affairs to strain , I would strain it till it cracked again ; but I received letters this morning which showed me pretty clearly where I stand , and it is not far off the end of the plank . My foreign market , at any rate , is gorged . If there is no change - if there dawns no prospect of peace - if the Orders in Council are not , at least , suspended , so as to open our way in the West - I do not know where I am to turn . I see no more light than if I were sealed in a rock , so that for me to pretend to offer a man a livelihood would be to do a dishonest thing . "
68715	68733	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Come , let us take a turn on the front . It is a starlight night , "
68763	68770	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Settle about Farren at once , "
68775	68797	67923	67923	he	230	" You have large fruit - gardens at Yorke Mills . He is a good gardener . Give him work there . "
68798	68835	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Well , so be it . I 'll send for him to - morrow , and we 'll see . And now , my lad , you 're concerned about the condition of your affairs ? "
68836	68896	67923	67923	he	230	" Yes , a second failure - which I may delay , but which , at this moment , I see no way finally to avert - would blight the name of Moore completely ; and you are aware I had fine intentions of paying off every debt and re - establishing the old firm on its former basis . "
68897	68908	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" You want capital - that 's all you want . "
68909	68929	67923	67923	he	230	" Yes ; but you might as well say that breath is all a dead man wants to live . "
68930	69012	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" I know - I know capital is not to be had for the asking ; and if you were a married man , and had a family , like me , I should think your case pretty nigh desperate ; but the young and unencumbered have chances peculiar to themselves . I hear gossip now and then about your being on the eve of marriage with this miss and that ; but I suppose it is none of it true ? "
69013	69111	67923	67923	he	230	" You may well suppose that . I think I am not in a position to be dreaming of marriage . Marriage ! I can not bear the word ; it sounds so silly and utopian . I have settled it decidedly that marriage and love are superfluities , intended only for the rich , who live at ease , and have no need to take thought for the morrow ; or desperations - the last and reckless joy of the deeply wretched , who never hope to rise out of the slough of their utter poverty . "
69112	69150	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" I should not think so if I were circumstanced as you are . I should think I could very likely get a wife with a few thousands , who would suit both me and my affairs . "
69151	69156	67923	67923	he	230	" I wonder where ? "
69157	69167	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Would you try if you had a chance ? "
69168	69187	67923	67923	he	230	" I do n't know . It depends on - in short , it depends on many things . "
69188	69196	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Would you take an old woman ? "
69197	69207	67923	67923	he	230	" I 'd rather break stones on the road . "
69208	69219	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" So would I. Would you take an ugly one ? "
69220	69282	67923	67923	he	230	" Bah ! I hate ugliness and delight in beauty . My eyes and heart , Yorke , take pleasure in a sweet , young , fair face , as they are repelled by a grim , rugged , meagre one . Soft delicate lines and hues please , harsh ones prejudice me . I wo n't have an ugly wife . "
69283	69290	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Not if she were rich ? "
69291	69338	67923	67923	he	230	" Not if she were dressed in gems . I could not love - I could not fancy - I could not endure her . My taste must have satisfaction , or disgust would break out in despotism , or worse - freeze to utter iciness . "
69339	69386	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" What ! Bob , if you married an honest , good - natured , and wealthy lass , though a little hard - favoured , could n't you put up with the high cheek - bones , the rather wide mouth , and reddish hair ? "
69387	69417	67923	67923	he	230	" I 'll never try , I tell you . Grace at least I will have , and youth and symmetry - yes , and what I call beauty . "
69418	69456	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" And poverty , and a nursery full of bairns you can neither clothe nor feed , and very soon an anxious , faded mother ; and then bankruptcy , discredit - a life - long struggle . "
69457	69464	67923	67923	he	230	" Let me alone , Yorke . "
69465	69489	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" If you are romantic , Robert , and especially if you are already in love , it is of no use talking . "
69490	69514	67923	67923	he	230	" I am not romantic . I am stripped of romance as bare as the white tenters in that field are of cloth . "
69515	69541	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Always use such figures of speech , lad ; I can understand them . And there is no love affair to disturb your judgment ? "
69542	69560	67923	67923	he	230	" I thought I had said enough on that subject before . Love for me ? Stuff ! "
69561	69599	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" Well , then , if you are sound both in heart and head , there is no reason why you should not profit by a good chance if it offers ; therefore , wait and see . "
69600	69608	67923	67923	he	230	" You are quite oracular , Yorke . "
69609	69646	68772	68773	Mr. Moore	230	" I think I am a bit i ' that line . I promise ye naught and I advise ye naught ; but I bid ye keep your heart up , and be guided by circumstances . "
69647	69660	67923	67923	he	230	" My namesake the physician 's almanac could not speak more guardedly . "
69661	69718	70689	70689	he	216	" In the meantime , I care naught about ye , Robert Moore : ye are nothing akin to me or mine , and whether ye lose or find a fortune it maks no difference to me . Go home , now . It has stricken ten . Miss Hortense will be wondering where ye are . "
70679	70681	70689	70689	he	216	" unhasting "
70684	70687	71521	71521	he	206	" unresting ; "
71526	71529	71788	71788	he	206	" horsewhip ; "
71781	71787	71738	71738	he	206	" Do you hear me ? "
71791	71796	71859	71859	She	279	" Yes , uncle . "
71797	71809	71738	71738	he	206	" Of course you mean to attend to what I say ? "
71810	71815	71859	71859	She	279	" Yes , certainly . "
71816	71849	71856	71856	Caroline	279	" And there must be no letter - scribbling to your cousin Hortense - no intercourse whatever . I do not approve of the principles of the family . They are Jacobinical . "
71850	71854	72291	72291	her	279	" Very well , "
72320	72323	72356	72366	a " man of business , " to enter into it	2243	" business , "
72357	72362	72434	72434	she	279	" man of business , "
72428	72433	72434	72434	she	279	" Different , indeed , "
72437	72595	72743	72743	she	2252	" is Robert 's mental condition to mine . I think only of him ; he has no room , no leisure , to think of me . The feeling called love is and has been for two years the predominant emotion of my heart - always there , always awake , always astir . Quite other feelings absorb his reflections and govern his faculties . He is rising now , going to leave the church , for service is over . Will he turn his head towards this pew ? No , not once . He has not one look for me . That is hard . A kind glance would have made me happy till to - morrow . I have not got it ; he would not give it ; he is gone . Strange that grief should now almost choke me , because another human being 's eye has failed to greet mine . "
72748	72754	73147	73147	she	279	" fit for Sunday reading . "
73152	73211	73226	73226	she	279	" I have to live , perhaps , till seventy years . As far as I know , I have good health ; half a century of existence may lie before me . How am I to occupy it ? What am I to do to fill the interval of time which spreads between me and the grave ? "
73215	73225	73226	73226	she	279	" I shall not be married , it appears , "
73229	73365	73377	73377	she	2258	" I suppose , as Robert does not care for me , I shall never have a husband to love , nor little children to take care of . Till lately I had reckoned securely on the duties and affections of wife and mother to occupy my existence . I considered , somehow , as a matter of course , that I was growing up to the ordinary destiny , and never troubled myself to seek any other ; but now I perceive plainly I may have been mistaken . Probably I shall be an old maid . I shall live to see Robert married to some one else , some rich lady . I shall never marry . What was I created for , I wonder ? Where is my place in the world ? "
73370	73376	73377	73377	she	2258	" Ah ! I see , "
73381	73646	73881	73883	vicar of Whinbury	2262	" that is the question which most old maids are puzzled to solve . Other people solve it for them by saying , ' Your place is to do good to others , to be helpful whenever help is wanted . ' That is right in some measure , and a very convenient doctrine for the people who hold it ; but I perceive that certain sets of human beings are very apt to maintain that other sets should give up their lives to them and their service , and then they requite them by praise ; they call them devoted and virtuous . Is this enough ? Is it to live ? Is there not a terrible hollowness , mockery , want , craving , in that existence which is given away to others , for want of something of your own to bestow it on ? I suspect there is . Does virtue lie in abnegation of self ? I do not believe it . Undue humility makes tyranny ; weak concession creates selfishness . The Romish religion especially teaches renunciation of self , submission to others , and nowhere are found so many grasping tyrants as in the ranks of the Romish priesthood . Each human being has his share of rights . I suspect it would conduce to the happiness and welfare of all if each knew his allotment , and held to it as tenaciously as the martyr to his creed . Queer thoughts these that surge in my mind . Are they right thoughts ? I am not certain .
73647	73836	73988	73988	she	2264	" Well , life is short at the best . Seventy years , they say , pass like a vapour , like a dream when one awaketh ; and every path trod by human feet terminates in one bourne - the grave , the little chink in the surface of this great globe , the furrow where the mighty husbandman with the scythe deposits the seed he has shaken from the ripe stem ; and there it falls , decays , and thence it springs again , when the world has rolled round a few times more . So much for the body . The soul meantime wings its long flight upward , folds its wings on the brink of the sea of fire and glass , and gazing down through the burning clearness , finds there mirrored the vision of the Christian 's triple Godhead - the sovereign Father , the mediating Son , the Creator Spirit . Such words , at least , have been chosen to express what is inexpressible , to describe what baffles description . The soul 's real hereafter who shall guess ? "
73992	73997	74012	74013	the girl	5967	" It is cold . "
73998	74010	74012	74013	the girl	5967	" You are very diligent at that sewing , Miss Caroline , "
74020	74029	73965	73965	her	2264	" I am tired of it , Fanny . "
74030	74053	74012	74013	the girl	5967	" Then why do you go on with it ? Put it down . Read , or do something to amuse you . "
74054	74070	73965	73965	her	2264	" It is solitary in this house , Fanny . Do n't you think so ? "
74071	74146	74012	74013	the girl	5967	" I do n't find it so , miss . Me and Eliza are company for one another ; but you are quite too still . You should visit more . Now , be persuaded : go upstairs and dress yourself smart , and go and take tea , in a friendly way , with Miss Mann or Miss Ainley . I am certain either of those ladies would be delighted to see you . "
74147	74171	73965	73965	her	2264	" But their houses are dismal : they are both old maids . I am certain old maids are a very unhappy race . "
74172	74196	74012	74013	the girl	5967	" Not they , miss . They ca n't be unhappy ; they take such care of themselves . They are all selfish . "
74197	74293	73965	73965	her	2264	" Miss Ainley is not selfish , Fanny . She is always doing good . How devotedly kind she was to her step - mother as long as the old lady lived ; and now when she is quite alone in the world , without brother or sister , or any one to care for her , how charitable she is to the poor , as far as her means permit ! Still nobody thinks much of her , or has pleasure in going to see her ; and how gentlemen always sneer at her ! "
74294	74318	74329	74329	Caroline	279	" They should n't , miss . I believe she is a good woman . But gentlemen think only of ladies ' looks . "
74319	74327	74329	74329	Caroline	279	" I 'll go and see her , "
74334	74399	74430	74430	she	301	" and if she asks me to stay to tea , I 'll stay . How wrong it is to neglect people because they are not pretty , and young , and merry ! And I will certainly call to see Miss Mann too . She may not be amiable , but what has made her unamiable ? What has life been to her ? "
74417	74429	74430	74430	she	301	" You 'll not be an old maid , Miss Caroline , "
74456	74468	74811	74811	Caroline	279	" there are no signs of an old maid about you . "
74830	74861	74869	74869	he	216	" Ah ! Robert , you do not like old maids . I , too , should come under the lash of your sarcasm if I were an old maid . "
74862	74868	74869	74869	he	216	" You an old maid ! "
74873	74959	75064	75065	old maids	6745	" A piquant notion suggested by lips of that tint and form . I can fancy you , though , at forty , quietly dressed , pale and sunk , but still with that straight nose , white forehead , and those soft eyes . I suppose , too , you will keep your voice , which has another ' timbre ' than that hard , deep organ of Miss Mann 's . Courage , Cary ! Even at fifty you will not be repulsive . "
74960	74975	74869	74869	he	216	" Miss Mann did not make herself , or tune her voice , Robert . "
74976	75027	76883	76883	she	279	" Nature made her in the mood in which she makes her briars and thorns ; whereas for the creation of some women she reserves the May morning hours , when with light and dew she wooes the primrose from the turf and the lily from the wood - moss . "
76877	76881	77570	77570	her	279	" a saint ; "
77562	77568	77570	77570	her	279	" I will bestir myself , "
77573	77586	78504	78504	she	279	" and try to be wise if I can not be good . "
78499	78502	79605	79605	her	279	" queer , "
79588	79603	79605	79605	her	279	" Oh , had he but been alone ! had he but seen me ! "
79608	79692	79735	79736	Mr. Helstone	206	" He would have said something . He would have given me his hand . He does , he must , love me a little . He would have shown some token of affection . In his eye , on his lips , I should have read comfort ; but the chance is lost . The wind , the cloud 's shadow , does not pass more silently , more emptily than he . I have been mocked , and Heaven is cruel ! "
79738	79756	79790	79790	he	206	" Have you any objection , uncle , to my inquiring for a situation in a family ? "
79784	79789	79790	79790	he	206	" What whim now ? "
79793	79803	79816	79816	she	279	" Are you bewitched ? What can you mean ? "
79804	79815	79920	79920	he	206	" I am not well , and need a change , "
79909	79919	79920	79920	he	206	" What on earth is the matter with you ? "
79923	79933	80394	80394	He	2437	" What is wrong ? How are you ailing ? "
79950	79979	80394	80394	He	2437	" Look out for a situation , indeed ! For what situation are you fit ? What have you been doing with yourself ? You are not well . "
79980	79991	80394	80394	He	2437	" I should be well if I went from home . "
79992	80138	80394	80394	He	2437	" These women are incomprehensible . They have the strangest knack of startling you with unpleasant surprises . To - day you see them bouncing , buxom , red as cherries , and round as apples ; to - morrow they exhibit themselves effete as dead weeds , blanched and broken down . And the reason of it all ? That 's the puzzle . She has her meals , her liberty , a good house to live in , and good clothes to wear , as usual . A while since that sufficed to keep her handsome and cheery , and there she sits now a poor , little , pale , puling chit enough . Provoking ! Then comes the question , What is to be done ? I suppose I must send for advice . Will you have a doctor , child ? "
80139	80167	80394	80394	He	2437	" No , uncle , I do n't want one . A doctor could do me no good . I merely want change of air and scene . "
80168	80203	80394	80394	He	2437	" Well , if that be the caprice , it shall be gratified . You shall go to a watering - place . I do n't mind the expense . Fanny shall accompany you . "
80204	80229	80394	80394	He	2437	" But , uncle , some day I must do something for myself ; I have no fortune . I had better begin now . "
80230	80259	80394	80394	He	2437	" While I live , you shall not turn out as a governess , Caroline . I will not have it said that my niece is a governess . "
80260	80303	80394	80394	He	2437	" But the later in life one makes a change of that sort , uncle , the more difficult and painful it is . I should wish to get accustomed to the yoke before any habits of ease and independence are formed . "
80304	80380	80394	80394	He	2437	" I beg you will not harass me , Caroline . I mean to provide for you . I have always meant to provide for you . I will purchase an annuity . Bless me ! I am but fifty - five ; my health and constitution are excellent . There is plenty of time to save and take measures . Do n't make yourself anxious respecting the future . Is that what frets you ? "
80381	80393	80405	80405	he	2437	" No , uncle ; but I long for a change . "
80397	80403	80405	80405	he	2437	" There speaks the woman ! "
80407	80431	80394	80394	He	2437	" the very woman ! A change ! a change ! Always fantastical and whimsical ! Well , it 's in her sex . "
80432	80443	80405	80405	he	2437	" But it is not fantasy and whim , uncle . "
80444	80450	80394	80394	He	2437	" What is it then ? "
80451	80472	80405	80405	he	2437	" Necessity , I think . I feel weaker than formerly . I believe I should have more to do . "
80473	80535	80394	80394	He	2437	" Admirable ! She feels weak , and therefore she should be set to hard labour - ' clair comme le jour , ' as Moore - confound Moore ! You shall go to Cliff Bridge ; and there are two guineas to buy a new frock . Come , Cary , never fear . We 'll find balm in Gilead . "
80536	80549	80405	80405	he	2437	" Uncle , I wish you were less generous and more - - "
80550	80554	80596	80596	he	1340	" More what ? "
80599	80613	80596	80596	he	1340	" The fact is , you do n't know precisely what you want . "
80614	80621	80596	80596	he	1340	" Only to be a governess . "
80622	80673	80685	80685	herself	279	" Pooh ! mere nonsense ! I 'll not hear of governessing . Do n't mention it again . It is rather too feminine a fancy . I have finished breakfast . Ring the bell . Put all crotchets out of your head , and run away and amuse yourself . "
80674	80681	81133	81133	they	1717	" What with ? My doll ? "
81138	81141	81188	81188	they	2452	" disappointed , "
81206	81208	81188	81188	they	2452	" love "
81223	81225	81358	81358	his	1340	" disappointed "
81362	81403	81358	81358	his	1340	" Come , child , you are always stooping over palette , or book , or sampler ; leave that tinting work . By - the - bye , do you put your pencil to your lips when you paint ? "
81404	81413	81358	81358	his	1340	" Sometimes , uncle , when I forget . "
81414	81477	81358	81358	his	1340	" Then it is that which is poisoning you . The paints are deleterious , child . There is white lead and red lead , and verdigris , and gamboge , and twenty other poisons in those colour cakes . Lock them up ! lock them up ! Get your bonnet on . I want you to make a call with me . "
81478	81484	81358	81358	his	1340	" With you , uncle ? "
81518	81538	81358	81358	his	1340	" Quick ! quick ! I am always busy , you know . I have no time to lose . "
81555	81559	81539	81539	She	279	" To Fieldhead . "
81560	81578	81358	81358	his	1340	" Fieldhead ! What ! to see old James Booth , the gardener ? Is he ill ? "
81579	81589	81539	81539	She	279	" We are going to see Miss Shirley Keeldar . "
81590	81605	81358	81358	his	1340	" Miss Keeldar ! Is she coming to Yorkshire ? Is she at Fieldhead ? "
81606	81656	81539	81539	She	279	" She is . She has been there a week . I met her at a party last night - that party to which you would not go . I was pleased with her . I choose that you shall make her acquaintance . It will do you good . "
81657	81668	81358	81358	his	1340	" She is now come of age , I suppose ? "
81669	81729	81539	81539	She	279	" She is come of age , and will reside for a time on her property . I lectured her on the subject ; I showed her her duty . She is not intractable . She is rather a fine girl ; she will teach you what it is to have a sprightly spirit . Nothing lackadaisical about her . "
81730	81763	81358	81358	his	1340	" I do n't think she will want to see me , or to have me introduced to her . What good can I do her ? How can I amuse her ? "
81764	81772	81539	81539	She	279	" Pshaw ! Put your bonnet on . "
81773	81780	81358	81358	his	1340	" Is she proud , uncle ? "
81781	81824	81539	81539	She	279	" Do n't know . You hardly imagine she would show her pride to me , I suppose ? A chit like that would scarcely presume to give herself airs with the rector of her parish , however rich she might be . "
81825	81837	81358	81358	his	1340	" No . But how did she behave to other people ? "
81838	81877	82186	82186	reader	619	" Did n't observe . She holds her head high , and probably can be saucy enough where she dare . She would n't be a woman otherwise . There ! Away now for your bonnet at once ! "
82213	82251	82206	82206	you	2478	" is - very execrable and inhuman . Whoever , having the bowels of humanity , has seen servants scrubbing at these polished wooden walls with beeswaxed cloths on a warm May day must allow that they are "
82259	82331	82956	82956	her	2499	" and I can not but secretly applaud the benevolent barbarian who had painted another and larger apartment of Fieldhead - the drawing - room , to wit , formerly also an oak - room - of a delicate pinky white , thereby earning for himself the character of a Hun , but mightily enhancing the cheerfulness of that portion of his abode , and saving future housemaids a world of toil .
82978	83004	83017	83017	he	206	" I knew you would come to see me , though you do think Mr. Yorke has made me a Jacobin . Good - morning . "
83005	83015	83017	83017	he	206	" But we 'll not have you a Jacobin , "
83019	83064	83073	83073	she	2500	" No , Miss Shirley ; they shall not steal the flower of my parish from me . Now that you are amongst us , you shall be my pupil in politics and religion ; I 'll teach you sound doctrine on both points . "
83065	83072	83073	83073	she	2500	" Mrs. Pryor has anticipated you , "
83082	83138	83205	83205	She	2503	" Mrs. Pryor , you know , was my governess , and is still my friend ; and of all the high and rigid Tories she is queen ; of all the stanch churchwomen she is chief . I have been well drilled both in theology and history , I assure you , Mr. Helstone . "
83238	83251	83346	83346	he	206	" Miss Keeldar thinks as you think , I hope , madam . "
83252	83265	83346	83346	he	206	" Difference of age and difference of temperament occasion difference of sentiment , "
83270	83293	83310	83311	Mr. Helstone	206	" It can scarcely be expected that the eager and young should hold the opinions of the cool and middle - aged . "
83294	83308	83310	83311	Mr. Helstone	206	" Oh ! oh ! we are independent ; we think for ourselves ! "
83313	83344	83380	83380	he	206	" We are a little Jacobin , for anything I know - a little freethinker , in good earnest . Let us have a confession of faith on the spot . "
83374	83379	83346	83346	he	206	" Say your creed , "
83383	83389	83394	83394	She	2505	" The Apostles ' Creed ? "
83390	83393	83394	83394	She	2505	" Yes . "
83401	83413	83394	83394	She	2505	" Now for St. Athanasius 's . That 's the test ! "
83414	83433	83539	83539	she	2505	" Let me gather up my flowers . Here is Tartar coming ; he will tread upon them . "
83529	83533	83565	83565	she	2505	" Thank you , "
83555	83564	83574	83575	Miss Keeldar	372	" Is this your daughter , Mr. Helstone ? "
83568	83573	83824	83824	they	1570	" My niece Caroline . "
83834	83840	83895	83896	Mr. Helstone	206	" fins , gracieux , spirituels "
83883	83893	83913	83913	she	372	" You see she is only a feeble chick , "
83898	83912	83870	83870	her	372	" She looks young - younger than I. - How old are you ? "
83933	83940	83870	83870	her	372	" Eighteen years and six months . "
83941	83949	83981	83982	the rector	932	" And I am twenty - one . "
83972	83979	83981	83982	the rector	932	" And St. Athanasius 's Creed ? "
83984	83994	84023	84023	She	372	" You believe it all , do n't you ? "
83995	84022	84161	84161	she	372	" I ca n't remember it quite all . I will give you a nosegay , Mr. Helstone , when I have given your niece one . "
84152	84160	84202	84203	the rector	932	" Are you tired with your walk ? "
84164	84183	84197	84197	she	372	" No - not in the least . It is but a short distance - but a mile . "
84184	84196	84202	84203	the rector	932	" You look pale . - Is she always so pale ? "
84205	84219	84202	84203	the rector	932	" She used to be as rosy as the reddest of your flowers . "
84220	84237	84202	84203	the rector	932	" Why is she altered ? What has made her pale ? Has she been ill ? "
84238	84247	84202	84203	the rector	932	" She tells me she wants a change . "
84248	84272	84202	84203	the rector	932	" She ought to have one . You ought to give her one . You should send her to the sea - coast . "
84273	84299	84314	84315	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I will , ere summer is over . Meantime , I intend her to make acquaintance with you , if you have no objection . "
84300	84311	84314	84315	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I am sure Miss Keeldar will have no objection , "
84317	84342	84354	84354	Shirley	372	" I think I may take it upon me to say that Miss Helstone 's frequent presence at Fieldhead will be esteemed a favour . "
84343	84352	84372	84372	she	372	" You speak my sentiments precisely , ma'am , "
84356	84371	84372	84372	she	372	" and I thank you for anticipating me . - Let me tell you , "
84380	84472	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" that you also ought to thank my governess . It is not every one she would welcome as she has welcomed you . You are distinguished more than you think . This morning , as soon as you are gone , I shall ask Mrs. Pryor 's opinion of you . I am apt to rely on her judgment of character , for hitherto I have found it wondrous accurate . Already I foresee a favourable answer to my inquiries . - Do I not guess rightly , Mrs. Pryor ? "
84473	84503	84372	84372	she	372	" My dear , you said but now you would ask my opinion when Miss Helstone was gone . I am scarcely likely to give it in her presence . "
84504	84580	84591	84592	her pupil	1351	" No ; and perhaps it will be long enough before I obtain it . - I am sometimes sadly tantalized , Mr. Helstone , by Mrs. Pryor 's extreme caution . Her judgments ought to be correct when they come , for they are often as tardy of delivery as a Lord Chancellor 's . On some people 's characters I can not get her to pronounce a sentence , entreat as I may . "
84586	84589	84622	84622	she	375	" Yes , "
84594	84621	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I know what that smile means . You are thinking of my gentleman - tenant . - Do you know Mr. Moore of the Hollow ? "
84627	84655	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Ay ! ay ! Your tenant - so he is . You have seen a good deal of him , no doubt , since you came ? "
84656	84828	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I have been obliged to see him . There was business to transact . Business ! Really the word makes me conscious I am indeed no longer a girl , but quite a woman and something more . I am an esquire ! Shirley Keeldar , Esquire , ought to be my style and title . They gave me a man 's name ; I hold a man 's position . It is enough to inspire me with a touch of manhood ; and when I see such people as that stately Anglo - Belgian - that Gérard Moore - before me , gravely talking to me of business , really I feel quite gentlemanlike . You must choose me for your churchwarden , Mr. Helstone , the next time you elect new ones . They ought to make me a magistrate and a captain of yeomanry . Tony Lumpkin 's mother was a colonel , and his aunt a justice of the peace . Why should n't I be ? "
84829	84866	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" With all my heart . If you choose to get up a requisition on the subject , I promise to head the list of signatures with my name . But you were speaking of Moore ? "
84867	84976	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Ah ! yes . I find it a little difficult to understand Mr. Moore , to know what to think of him , whether to like him or not . He seems a tenant of whom any proprietor might be proud - and proud of him I am , in that sense ; but as a neighbour , what is he ? Again and again I have entreated Mrs. Pryor to say what she thinks of him , but she still evades returning a direct answer . I hope you will be less oracular , Mr. Helstone , and pronounce at once . Do you like him ? "
84977	84995	84581	84582	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Not at all , just now . His name is entirely blotted from my good books . "
84996	85007	85023	85023	Caroline	279	" What is the matter ? What has he done ? "
85008	85017	85079	85079	Shirley	372	" My uncle and he disagree on politics , "
85070	85077	85089	85090	the rector	932	" What are Moore 's politics ? "
85081	85087	85089	85090	the rector	932	" Those of a tradesman , "
85092	85121	85089	85090	the rector	932	" narrow , selfish , and unpatriotic . The man is eternally writing and speaking against the continuance of the war . I have no patience with him . "
85122	85146	85089	85090	the rector	932	" The war hurts his trade . I remember he remarked that only yesterday . But what other objection have you to him ? "
85147	85152	85168	85168	Shirley	372	" That is enough . "
85153	85166	85168	85168	Shirley	372	" He looks the gentleman , in my sense of the term , "
85170	85181	85182	85182	Caroline	279	" and it pleases me to think he is such . "
85202	85207	85242	85242	she	372	" Decidedly he is . "
85231	85241	85242	85242	she	372	" You are his friend , at any rate , "
85245	85253	85225	85225	her	372	" You defend him in his absence . "
85254	85264	85225	85225	her	372	" I am both his friend and his relative , "
85270	85277	85242	85242	she	372	" Robert Moore is my cousin . "
85278	85300	85432	85432	she	375	" Oh , then , you can tell me all about him . Just give me a sketch of his character . "
85420	85430	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" Be sure you wear it for my sake , "
85434	85442	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" Next my heart , of course , "
85447	85513	85522	85522	Shirley	372	" Mrs. Pryor , take care of this future magistrate , this churchwarden in perspective , this captain of yeomanry , this young squire of Briarfield , in a word . Do n't let him exert himself too much ; do n't let him break his neck in hunting ; especially , let him mind how he rides down that dangerous hill near the Hollow . "
85514	85520	85522	85522	Shirley	372	" I like a descent , "
85524	85544	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" I like to clear it rapidly ; and especially I like that romantic Hollow with all my heart . "
85545	85554	85522	85522	Shirley	372	" Romantic , with a mill in it ? "
85555	85577	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" Romantic with a mill in it . The old mill and the white cottage are each admirable in its way . "
85578	85588	85522	85522	Shirley	372	" And the counting - house , Mr. Keeldar ? "
85589	85612	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" The counting - house is better than my bloom - coloured drawing - room . I adore the counting - house . "
85613	85631	85522	85522	Shirley	372	" And the trade ? The cloth , the greasy wool , the polluting dyeing - vats ? "
85632	85641	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" The trade is to be thoroughly respected . "
85642	85652	85522	85522	Shirley	372	" And the tradesman is a hero ? Good ! "
85653	85670	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" I am glad to hear you say so . I thought the tradesman looked heroic . "
85699	85720	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" Captain Keeldar , you have no mercantile blood in your veins . Why are you so fond of trade ? "
85721	85744	85444	85444	Helstone	279	" Because I am a mill - owner , of course . Half my income comes from the works in that Hollow . "
85745	85756	85775	85775	she	2526	" Do n't enter into partnership - that 's all . "
85757	85774	85775	85775	she	2526	" You 've put it into my head ! you 've put it into my head ! "
85783	85793	86102	86102	she	375	" It will never get out . Thank you . "
86116	86161	86292	86293	Mrs. Pryor	375	" My dear , do not allow that habit of alluding to yourself as a gentleman to be confirmed . It is a strange one . Those who do not know you , hearing you speak thus , would think you affected masculine manners . "
86286	86290	86302	86302	Shirley	372	" My dear ! "
86295	86300	86302	86302	Shirley	372	" Was I whistling ? "
86304	86327	86250	86250	she	372	" I forgot . I beg your pardon , ma'am . I had resolved to take care not to whistle before you . "
86328	86363	86302	86302	Shirley	372	" But , Miss Keeldar , where did you learn to whistle ? You must have got the habit since you came down into Yorkshire . I never knew you guilty of it before . "
86364	86376	86250	86250	she	372	" Oh ! I learned to whistle a long while ago . "
86377	86382	86302	86302	Shirley	372	" Who taught you ? "
86383	86440	86250	86250	she	372	" No one . I took it up by listening , and I had laid it down again . But lately , yesterday evening , as I was coming up our lane , I heard a gentleman whistling that very tune in the field on the other side of the hedge , and that reminded me . "
86441	86447	86302	86302	Shirley	372	" What gentleman was it ? "
86448	86510	86511	86512	Mrs. Pryor	375	" We have only one gentleman in this region , ma'am , and that is Mr. Moore - at least he is the only gentleman who is not gray - haired . My two venerable favourites , Mr. Helstone and Mr. Yorke , it is true , are fine old beaus , infinitely better than any of the stupid young ones . "
86516	86526	86250	86250	she	372	" You do not like Mr. Helstone , ma'am ? "
86527	86540	86511	86512	Mrs. Pryor	375	" My dear , Mr. Helstone 's office secures him from criticism . "
86541	86554	86250	86250	she	372	" You generally contrive to leave the room when he is announced . "
86555	86566	86511	86512	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Do you walk out this morning , my dear ? "
86567	86601	86250	86250	she	372	" Yes , I shall go to the rectory , and seek and find Caroline Helstone , and make her take some exercise . She shall have a breezy walk over Nunnely Common . "
86602	86641	86511	86512	Mrs. Pryor	375	" If you go in that direction , my dear , have the goodness to remind Miss Helstone to wrap up well , as there is a fresh wind , and she appears to me to require care . "
86642	86661	86250	86250	she	372	" You shall be minutely obeyed , Mrs. Pryor . Meantime , will you not accompany us yourself ? "
86662	86693	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" No , my love ; I should be a restraint upon you . I am stout , and can not walk so quickly as you would wish to do . "
86867	86880	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" I know how the heath would look on such a day , "
86884	86904	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" purple - black - a deeper shade of the sky - tint , and that would be livid . "
86905	86950	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" Yes , quite livid , with brassy edges to the clouds , and here and there a white gleam , more ghastly than the lurid tinge , which , as you looked at it , you momentarily expected would kindle into blinding lightning . "
86951	86956	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" Did it thunder ? "
86957	86994	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" It muttered distant peals , but the storm did not break till evening , after we had reached our inn - that inn being an isolated house at the foot of a range of mountains . "
86995	87007	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" Did you watch the clouds come down over the mountains ? "
87008	87055	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" I did . I stood at the window an hour watching them . The hills seemed rolled in a sullen mist , and when the rain fell in whitening sheets , suddenly they were blotted from the prospect ; they were washed from the world . "
87056	87092	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" I have seen such storms in hilly districts in Yorkshire ; and at their riotous climax , while the sky was all cataract , the earth all flood , I have remembered the Deluge . "
87093	87126	86882	86882	Caroline	279	" It is singularly reviving after such hurricanes to feel calm return , and from the opening clouds to receive a consolatory gleam , softly testifying that the sun is not quenched . "
87127	87145	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" Miss Keeldar , just stand still now , and look down at Nunnely dale and wood . "
87317	87325	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" Our England is a bonny island , "
87329	87339	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" and Yorkshire is one of her bonniest nooks . "
87340	87348	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" You are a Yorkshire girl too ? "
87349	87385	87406	87406	she	279	" I am - Yorkshire in blood and birth . Five generations of my race sleep under the aisles of Briarfield Church . I drew my first breath in the old black hall behind us . "
87399	87404	87413	87413	Shirley	372	" We are compatriots , "
87408	87411	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes , "
87420	87424	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" And that , "
87434	87439	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" that is Nunnwood ? "
87440	87444	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" It is . "
87445	87451	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" Were you ever there ? "
87452	87457	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Many a time . "
87458	87465	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" In the heart of it ? "
87466	87469	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes . "
87470	87476	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" What is it like ? "
87477	87552	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" It is like an encampment of forest sons of Anak . The trees are huge and old . When you stand at their roots , the summits seem in another region . The trunks remain still and firm as pillars , while the boughs sway to every breeze . In the deepest calm their leaves are never quite hushed , and in high wind a flood rushes , a sea thunders above you . "
87553	87564	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" Was it not one of Robin Hood 's haunts ? "
87565	87610	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes , and there are mementos of him still existing . To penetrate into Nunnwood , Miss Keeldar , is to go far back into the dim days of old . Can you see a break in the forest , about the centre ? "
87611	87616	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" Yes , distinctly . "
87617	87673	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" That break is a dell - a deep , hollow cup , lined with turf as green and short as the sod of this common . The very oldest of the trees , gnarled mighty oaks , crowd about the brink of this dell . In the bottom lie the ruins of a nunnery . "
87674	87769	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" We will go - you and I alone , Caroline - to that wood , early some fine summer morning , and spend a long day there . We can take pencils and sketch - books , and any interesting reading book we like ; and of course we shall take something to eat . I have two little baskets , in which Mrs. Gill , my housekeeper , might pack our provisions , and we could each carry our own . It would not tire you too much to walk so far ? "
87770	87902	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Oh no ; especially if we rested the whole day in the wood . And I know all the pleasantest spots . I know where we could get nuts in nutting time ; I know where wild strawberries abound ; I know certain lonely , quite untrodden glades , carpeted with strange mosses , some yellow as if gilded , some a sober gray , some gem - green . I know groups of trees that ravish the eye with their perfect , picture - like effects - rude oak , delicate birch , glossy beech , clustered in contrast ; and ash trees stately as Saul , standing isolated ; and superannuated wood - giants clad in bright shrouds of ivy . Miss Keeldar , I could guide you . "
87903	87912	87327	87327	Shirley	372	" You would be dull with me alone ? "
87913	87938	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" I should not . I think we should suit ; and what third person is there whose presence would not spoil our pleasure ? "
87939	87962	87981	87981	Caroline	279	" Indeed , I know of none about our own ages - no lady at least ; and as to gentlemen - - "
87963	87979	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" An excursion becomes quite a different thing when there are gentlemen of the party , "
87983	87999	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" I agree with you - quite a different thing to what we were proposing . "
88000	88034	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" We were going simply to see the old trees , the old ruins ; to pass a day in old times , surrounded by olden silence , and above all by quietude . "
88035	88110	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" You are right ; and the presence of gentlemen dispels the last charm , I think . If they are of the wrong sort , like your Malones , and your young Sykes , and Wynnes , irritation takes the place of serenity . If they are of the right sort , there is still a change ; I can hardly tell what change - one easy to feel , difficult to describe . "
88111	88118	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" We forget Nature , imprimis . "
88119	88165	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" And then Nature forgets us , covers her vast calm brow with a dim veil , conceals her face , and withdraws the peaceful joy with which , if we had been content to worship her only , she would have filled our hearts . "
88166	88174	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" What does she give us instead ? "
88175	88199	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" More elation and more anxiety ; an excitement that steals the hours away fast , and a trouble that ruffles their course . "
88200	88216	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Our power of being happy lies a good deal in ourselves , I believe , "
88221	88324	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" I have gone to Nunnwood with a large party - all the curates and some other gentry of these parts , together with sundry ladies - and I found the affair insufferably tedious and absurd ; and I have gone quite alone , or accompanied but by Fanny , who sat in the woodman 's hut and sewed , or talked to the goodwife , while I roamed about and made sketches , or read ; and I have enjoyed much happiness of a quiet kind all day long . But that was when I was young - two years ago . "
88325	88337	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Did you ever go with your cousin , Robert Moore ? "
88338	88343	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes ; once . "
88344	88356	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" What sort of a companion is he on these occasions ? "
88357	88370	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" A cousin , you know , is different to a stranger . "
88371	88412	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" I am aware of that ; but cousins , if they are stupid , are still more insupportable than strangers , because you can not so easily keep them at a distance . But your cousin is not stupid ? "
88413	88419	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" No ; but - - "
88420	88423	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Well ? "
88424	88477	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" If the company of fools irritates , as you say , the society of clever men leaves its own peculiar pain also . Where the goodness or talent of your friend is beyond and above all doubt , your own worthiness to be his associate often becomes a matter of question . "
88478	88605	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Oh ! there I can not follow you . That crotchet is not one I should choose to entertain for an instant . I consider myself not unworthy to be the associate of the best of them - of gentlemen , I mean - though that is saying a great deal . Where they are good , they are very good , I believe . Your uncle , by - the - bye , is not a bad specimen of the elderly gentleman . I am always glad to see his brown , keen , sensible old face , either in my own house or any other . Are you fond of him ? Is he kind to you ? Now , speak the truth . "
88606	88661	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" He has brought me up from childhood , I doubt not , precisely as he would have brought up his own daughter , if he had had one ; and that is kindness . But I am not fond of him . I would rather be out of his presence than in it . "
88662	88676	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Strange , when he has the art of making himself so agreeable . "
88677	88744	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes , in company ; but he is stern and silent at home . As he puts away his cane and shovel - hat in the rectory hall , so he locks his liveliness in his book - case and study - desk : the knitted brow and brief word for the fireside ; the smile , the jest , the witty sally for society . "
88745	88750	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Is he tyrannical ? "
88751	88798	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Not in the least . He is neither tyrannical nor hypocritical . He is simply a man who is rather liberal than good - natured , rather brilliant than genial , rather scrupulously equitable than truly just - if you can understand such superfine distinctions . "
88799	88853	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" Oh yes ! Good - nature implies indulgence , which he has not ; geniality , warmth of heart , which he does not own ; and genuine justice is the offspring of sympathy and considerateness , of which , I can well conceive , my bronzed old friend is quite innocent . "
88854	88916	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" I often wonder , Shirley , whether most men resemble my uncle in their domestic relations ; whether it is necessary to be new and unfamiliar to them in order to seem agreeable or estimable in their eyes ; and whether it is impossible to their natures to retain a constant interest and affection for those they see every day . "
88917	89052	88218	88218	Caroline	279	" I do n't know . I ca n't clear up your doubts . I ponder over similar ones myself sometimes . But , to tell you a secret , if I were convinced that they are necessarily and universally different from us - fickle , soon petrifying , unsympathizing - I would never marry . I should not like to find out that what I loved did not love me , that it was weary of me , and that whatever effort I might make to please would hereafter be worse than useless , since it was inevitably in its nature to change and become indifferent . That discovery once made , what should I long for ? To go away , to remove from a presence where my society gave no pleasure . "
89053	89063	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" But you could not if you were married . "
89064	89156	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" No , I could not . There it is . I could never be my own mistress more . A terrible thought ! It suffocates me ! Nothing irks me like the idea of being a burden and a bore - an inevitable burden , a ceaseless bore ! Now , when I feel my company superfluous , I can comfortably fold my independence round me like a mantle , and drop my pride like a veil , and withdraw to solitude . If married , that could not be . "
89157	89172	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I wonder we do n't all make up our minds to remain single , "
89176	89229	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" We should if we listened to the wisdom of experience . My uncle always speaks of marriage as a burden ; and I believe whenever he hears of a man being married he invariably regards him as a fool , or , at any rate , as doing a foolish thing . "
89230	89250	89277	89277	Caroline	279	" But , Caroline , men are not all like your uncle . Surely not . I hope not . "
89256	89275	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" I suppose we each find an exception in the one we love , till we are married , "
89279	89531	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I suppose so . And this exception we believe to be of sterling materials . We fancy it like ourselves ; we imagine a sense of harmony . We think his voice gives the softest , truest promise of a heart that will never harden against us ; we read in his eyes that faithful feeling - affection . I do n't think we should trust to what they call passion at all , Caroline . I believe it is a mere fire of dry sticks , blazing up and vanishing . But we watch him , and see him kind to animals , to little children , to poor people . He is kind to us likewise , good , considerate . He does not flatter women , but he is patient with them , and he seems to be easy in their presence , and to find their company genial . He likes them not only for vain and selfish reasons , but as we like him - because we like him . Then we observe that he is just , that he always speaks the truth , that he is conscientious . We feel joy and peace when he comes into a room ; we feel sadness and trouble when he leaves it . We know that this man has been a kind son , that he is a kind brother . Will any one dare to tell me that he will not be a kind husband ? "
89532	89556	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" My uncle would affirm it unhesitatingly . ' He will be sick of you in a month , ' he would say . "
89557	89566	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Mrs. Pryor would seriously intimate the same . "
89567	89578	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Mrs. Yorke and Miss Mann would darkly suggest ditto . "
89579	89595	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" If they are true oracles , it is good never to fall in love . "
89596	89606	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Very good , if you can avoid it . "
89607	89615	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I choose to doubt their truth . "
89616	89627	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" I am afraid that proves you are already caught . "
89628	89645	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Not I. But if I were , do you know what soothsayers I would consult ? "
89646	89651	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Let me hear . "
89652	89712	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Neither man nor woman , elderly nor young : the little Irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door ; the mouse that steals out of the cranny in the wainscot ; the bird that in frost and snow pecks at my window for a crumb ; the dog that licks my hand and sits beside my knee . "
89713	89727	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" Did you ever see any one who was kind to such things ? "
89728	89748	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Did you ever see any one whom such things seemed instinctively to follow , like , rely on ? "
89749	89807	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" We have a black cat and an old dog at the rectory . I know somebody to whose knee that black cat loves to climb , against whose shoulder and cheek it likes to purr . The old dog always comes out of his kennel and wags his tail , and whines affectionately when somebody passes . "
89808	89816	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" And what does that somebody do ? "
89817	89868	87426	87427	Miss Keeldar	372	" He quietly strokes the cat , and lets her sit while he conveniently can ; and when he must disturb her by rising , he puts her softly down , and never flings her from him roughly . He always whistles to the dog and gives him a caress . "
89869	89878	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Does he ? It is not Robert ? "
89879	89885	89892	89892	Shirley	372	" But it is Robert . "
89886	89890	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Handsome fellow ! "
89901	89925	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Is he not handsome ? Has he not fine eyes and well - cut features , and a clear , princely forehead ? "
89926	89944	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" He has all that , Caroline . Bless him ! he is both graceful and good . "
89945	89968	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I was sure you would see that he was . When I first looked at your face I knew you would . "
89969	90018	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I was well inclined to him before I saw him . I liked him when I did see him . I admire him now . There is charm in beauty for itself , Caroline ; when it is blent with goodness , there is a powerful charm . "
90019	90027	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" When mind is added , Shirley ? "
90028	90034	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Who can resist it ? "
90035	90048	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Remember my uncle , Mesdames Pryor , Yorke , and Mann . "
90049	90122	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Remember the croaking of the frogs of Egypt . He is a noble being . I tell you when they are good they are the lords of the creation - they are the sons of God . Moulded in their Maker 's image , the minutest spark of His spirit lifts them almost above mortality . Indisputably , a great , good , handsome man is the first of created things . "
90123	90127	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Above us ? "
90128	90175	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I would scorn to contend for empire with him - I would scorn it . Shall my left hand dispute for precedence with my right ? Shall my heart quarrel with my pulse ? Shall my veins be jealous of the blood which fills them ? "
90176	90190	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Men and women , husbands and wives , quarrel horribly , Shirley . "
90191	90213	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Poor things ! Poor , fallen , degenerate things ! God made them for another lot , for other feelings . "
90214	90227	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" But are we men 's equals , or are we not ? "
90228	90253	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Nothing ever charms me more than when I meet my superior - one who makes me sincerely feel that he is my superior . "
90254	90261	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Did you ever meet him ? "
90262	90330	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" I should be glad to see him any day . The higher above me , so much the better . It degrades to stoop ; it is glorious to look up . What frets me is , that when I try to esteem , I am baffled ; when religiously inclined , there are but false gods to adore . I disdain to be a pagan . "
90331	90348	89174	89174	Caroline	279	" Miss Keeldar , will you come in ? We are here at the rectory gates . "
90349	90423	90855	90856	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Not to - day , but to - morrow I shall fetch you to spend the evening with me . Caroline Helstone , if you really are what at present to me you seem , you and I will suit . I have never in my whole life been able to talk to a young lady as I have talked to you this morning . Kiss me - and good - bye . "
90846	90853	90855	90856	Mrs. Pryor	375	" That is a beautiful face , "
90872	90899	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" The features may be termed perfect ; no statuary 's chisel could improve them . It is a portrait from the life , I presume ? "
90900	90909	90855	90856	Mrs. Pryor	375	" It is a portrait of Mrs. Helstone . "
90910	90922	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Of Mrs. Matthewson Helstone ? Of your uncle 's wife ? "
90923	90948	90855	90856	Mrs. Pryor	375	" It is , and is said to be a good likeness . Before her marriage she was accounted the beauty of the district . "
90949	90991	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I should say she merited the distinction . What accuracy in all the lineaments ! It is , however , a passive face . The original could not have been what is generally termed ' a woman of spirit . ' "
90992	91004	90855	90856	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I believe she was a remarkably still , silent person . "
91005	91041	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" One would scarcely have expected , my dear , that your uncle 's choice should have fallen on a partner of that description . Is he not fond of being amused by lively chat ? "
91042	91085	90855	90856	Mrs. Pryor	375	" In company he is . But he always says he could never do with a talking wife . He must have quiet at home . You go out to gossip , he affirms ; you come home to read and reflect . "
91086	91104	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Mrs. Matthewson lived but a few years after her marriage , I think I have heard ? "
91105	91110	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" About five years . "
91111	91117	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Well , my dear , "
91126	91170	91119	91120	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I trust it is understood that you will frequently come to Fieldhead . I hope you will . You must feel lonely here , having no female relative in the house ; you must necessarily pass much of your time in solitude . "
91171	91193	91213	91213	she	375	" I am inured to it . I have grown up by myself . May I arrange your shawl for you ? "
91201	91212	91213	91213	she	375	" Should you chance to require help in your studies , "
91216	91222	91258	91258	She	279	" you may command me . "
91231	91251	91295	91295	Caroline	279	" I hope to have frequent conversations with you . I should wish to be of use to you . "
91299	91339	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" The likeness that hangs near the window , you will see , is my uncle , taken twenty years ago ; the other , to the left of the mantelpiece , is his brother James , my father . "
91340	91349	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" They resemble each other in some measure , "
91354	91373	91380	91380	Caroline	279	" yet a difference of character may be traced in the different mould of the brow and mouth . "
91374	91378	91380	91380	Caroline	279	" What difference ? "
91388	91434	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" James Helstone - that is , my father - is generally considered the best - looking of the two . Strangers , I remark , always exclaim , ' What a handsome man ! ' Do you think his picture handsome , Mrs. Pryor ? "
91435	91449	91380	91380	Caroline	279	" It is much softer or finer featured than that of your uncle . "
91450	91477	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" But where or what is the difference of character to which you alluded ? Tell me . I wish to see if you guess right . "
91478	91504	91380	91380	Caroline	279	" My dear , your uncle is a man of principle . His forehead and his lips are firm , and his eye is steady . "
91505	91526	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Well , and the other ? Do not be afraid of offending me . I always like the truth . "
91527	91591	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Do you like the truth ? It is well for you . Adhere to that preference - never swerve thence . The other , my dear , if he had been living now , would probably have furnished little support to his daughter . It is , however , a graceful head - taken in youth , I should think . My dear "
91595	91604	91380	91380	Caroline	279	" you acknowledge an inestimable value in principle ? "
91605	91618	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I am sure no character can have true worth without it . "
91619	91632	91380	91380	Caroline	279	" You feel what you say ? You have considered the subject ? "
91633	91644	91351	91352	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Often . Circumstances early forced it upon my attention . "
91645	91704	92255	92255	She	372	" The lesson was not lost , then , though it came so prematurely . I suppose the soil is not light nor stony , otherwise seed falling in that season never would have borne fruit . My dear , do not stand in the air of the door ; you will take cold . Good - afternoon . "
92266	92270	92255	92255	She	372	" all that property "
92276	92303	93032	93032	she	372	" comprising an excellent cloth - mill , dyehouse , warehouse , together with the messuage , gardens , and outbuildings , termed Hollow 's Cottage ; "
93041	93084	93112	93112	she	372	" Obscurest night involved the sky , The Atlantic billows roared , When such a destined wretch as I , Washed headlong from on board , Of friends , of hope , of all bereft , His floating home for ever left . "
93106	93110	93032	93032	she	372	" Go on , "
93114	93130	93162	93164	no formidable auditor	2615	" Then you go on too . I was only repeating ' The Castaway . ' "
93131	93146	93205	93205	her	372	" I know . If you can remember it all , say it all . "
93223	93227	93653	93653	she	372	" The Castaway , "
93268	93310	93326	93326	Caroline	279	" No voice divine the storm allayed , No light propitious shone , When , snatched from all effectual aid , We perished - each alone ! But I beneath a rougher sea , And whelmed in deeper gulfs than he . "
93311	93324	93340	93341	Miss Keeldar	372	" I hope William Cowper is safe and calm in heaven now , "
93328	93338	93653	93653	she	372	" Do you pity what he suffered on earth ? "
93343	93476	93653	93653	she	372	" Pity him , Shirley ? What can I do else ? He was nearly broken - hearted when he wrote that poem , and it almost breaks one 's heart to read it . But he found relief in writing it - I know he did ; and that gift of poetry - the most divine bestowed on man - was , I believe , granted to allay emotions when their strength threatens harm . It seems to me , Shirley , that nobody should write poetry to exhibit intellect or attainment . Who cares for that sort of poetry ? Who cares for learning - who cares for fine words in poetry ? And who does not care for feeling - real feeling - however simply , even rudely expressed ? "
93477	93564	93653	93653	she	372	" It seems you care for it , at all events ; and certainly , in hearing that poem , one discovers that Cowper was under an impulse strong as that of the wind which drove the ship - an impulse which , while it would not suffer him to stop to add ornament to a single stanza , filled him with force to achieve the whole with consummate perfection . You managed to recite it with a steady voice , Caroline . I wonder thereat . "
93565	93643	93653	93653	she	372	" Cowper 's hand did not tremble in writing the lines . Why should my voice falter in repeating them ? Depend on it , Shirley , no tear blistered the manuscript of ' The Castaway . ' I hear in it no sob of sorrow , only the cry of despair ; but , that cry uttered , I believe the deadly spasm passed from his heart , that he wept abundantly , and was comforted . "
93658	93680	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" One could have loved Cowper , if it were only for the sake of having the privilege of comforting him . "
93681	93689	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" You never would have loved Cowper , "
93694	93705	93653	93653	she	372	" He was not made to be loved by woman . "
93706	93712	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" What do you mean ? "
93713	93799	93653	93653	she	372	" What I say . I know there is a kind of natures in the world - and very noble , elevated natures too - whom love never comes near . You might have sought Cowper with the intention of loving him , and you would have looked at him , pitied him , and left him , forced away by a sense of the impossible , the incongruous , as the crew were borne from their drowning comrade by ' the furious blast . ' "
93800	93811	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" You may be right . Who told you this ? "
93812	93866	93653	93653	she	372	" And what I say of Cowper , I should say of Rousseau . Was Rousseau ever loved ? He loved passionately ; but was his passion ever returned ? I am certain , never . And if there were any female Cowpers and Rousseaus , I should assert the same of them . "
93867	93879	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" Who told you this , I ask ? Did Moore ? "
93880	93931	93653	93653	she	372	" Why should anybody have told me ? Have I not an instinct ? Can I not divine by analogy ? Moore never talked to me either about Cowper , or Rousseau , or love . The voice we hear in solitude told me all I know on these subjects . "
93932	93944	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" Do you like characters of the Rousseau order , Caroline ? "
93945	94018	93653	93653	she	372	" Not at all , as a whole . I sympathize intensely with certain qualities they possess . Certain divine sparks in their nature dazzle my eyes , and make my soul glow . Then , again , I scorn them . They are made of clay and gold . The refuse and the ore make a mass of weakness : taken altogether , I feel them unnatural , unhealthy , repulsive . "
94019	94073	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" I dare say I should be more tolerant of a Rousseau than you would , Cary . Submissive and contemplative yourself , you like the stern and the practical . By the way , you must miss that Cousin Robert of yours very much , now that you and he never meet . "
94074	94078	93653	93653	she	372	" I do . "
94079	94086	93691	93691	Caroline	279	" And he must miss you ? "
94087	94093	94102	94102	Shirley	372	" That he does not . "
94094	94100	94102	94102	Shirley	372	" I can not imagine , "
94129	94161	94102	94102	Shirley	372	" I can not imagine but that he was fond of you , since he took so much notice of you , talked to you , and taught you so much . "
94162	94191	94261	94262	Miss Keeldar	372	" He never was fond of me ; he never professed to be fond of me . He took pains to prove that he only just tolerated me . "
94253	94259	94261	94262	Miss Keeldar	372	" Of course , then , "
94264	94273	94228	94228	her	279	" you only just tolerated him in return ? "
94274	94533	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Shirley , men and women are so different ; they are in such a different position . Women have so few things to think about , men so many . You may have a friendship for a man , while he is almost indifferent to you . Much of what cheers your life may be dependent on him , while not a feeling or interest of moment in his eyes may have reference to you . Robert used to be in the habit of going to London , sometimes for a week or a fortnight together . Well , while he was away , I found his absence a void . There was something wanting ; Briarfield was duller . Of course , I had my usual occupations ; still I missed him . As I sat by myself in the evenings , I used to feel a strange certainty of conviction I can not describe , that if a magician or a genius had , at that moment , offered me Prince Ali 's tube you remember it in the ' Arabian Nights ' ? , and if , with its aid , I had been enabled to take a view of Robert - to see where he was , how occupied - I should have learned , in a startling manner , the width of the chasm which gaped between such as he and such as I. I knew that , however my thoughts might adhere to him , his were effectually sundered from me . "
94534	94537	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Caroline , "
94543	94556	94228	94228	her	279	" do n't you wish you had a profession - a trade ? "
94557	94601	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" I wish it fifty times a day . As it is , I often wonder what I came into the world for . I long to have something absorbing and compulsory to fill my head and hands and to occupy my thoughts . "
94602	94612	94228	94228	her	279	" Can labour alone make a human being happy ? "
94613	94659	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" No ; but it can give varieties of pain , and prevent us from breaking our hearts with a single tyrant master - torture . Besides , successful labour has its recompense ; a vacant , weary , lonely , hopeless life has none . "
94660	94679	94228	94228	her	279	" But hard labour and learned professions , they say , make women masculine , coarse , unwomanly . "
94680	94787	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" And what does it signify whether unmarried and never - to - be - married women are unattractive and inelegant or not ? Provided only they are decent , decorous , and neat , it is enough . The utmost which ought to be required of old maids , in the way of appearance , is that they should not absolutely offend men 's eyes as they pass them in the street ; for the rest , they should be allowed , without too much scorn , to be as absorbed , grave , plain - looking , and plain - dressed as they please . "
94788	94804	94228	94228	her	279	" You might be an old maid yourself , Caroline , you speak so earnestly . "
94805	94835	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" I shall be one . It is my destiny . I will never marry a Malone or a Sykes ; and no one else will ever marry me . "
94862	94873	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Lina - did not Moore call you Lina sometimes ? "
94874	94891	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes . It is sometimes used as the abbreviation of Caroline in his native country . "
94892	94939	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Well , Lina , do you remember my one day noticing an inequality in your hair - a curl wanting on that right side - and your telling me that it was Robert 's fault , as he had once cut therefrom a long lock ? "
94940	94943	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Yes . "
94944	94968	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" If he is , and always was , as indifferent to you as you say , why did he steal your hair ? "
94969	95213	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" I do n't know - yes , I do . It was my doing , not his . Everything of that sort always was my doing . He was going from home - to London , as usual ; and the night before he went , I had found in his sister 's workbox a lock of black hair - a short , round curl . Hortense told me it was her brother 's , and a keepsake . He was sitting near the table . I looked at his head . He has plenty of hair ; on the temples were many such round curls . I thought he could spare me one . I knew I should like to have it , and I asked for it . He said , on condition that he might have his choice of a tress from my head . So he got one of my long locks of hair , and I got one of his short ones . I keep his , but I dare say he has lost mine . It was my doing , and one of those silly deeds it distresses the heart and sets the face on fire to think of ; one of those small but sharp recollections that return , lacerating your self - respect like tiny penknives , and forcing from your lips , as you sit alone , sudden , insane - sounding interjections . "
95214	95217	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" Caroline ! "
95218	95292	94539	94540	Miss Keeldar	372	" I do think myself a fool , Shirley , in some respects ; I do despise myself . But I said I would not make you my confessor , for you can not reciprocate foible for foible ; you are not weak . How steadily you watch me now ! Turn aside your clear , strong , she - eagle eye ; it is an insult to fix it on me thus . "
95293	95318	95351	95351	She	372	" What a study of character you are - weak , certainly , but not in the sense you think ! - Come in ! "
95366	95373	95380	95381	Miss Keeldar	372	" From Mr. Moore , ma'am . "
95374	95378	95395	95396	the heiress	2505	" Bring candles , "
95387	95393	95737	95737	Caroline	279	" A communication on business , "
95727	95735	95768	95768	she	372	" Shirley , why do you cry ? "
95758	95767	95768	95768	she	372	" Because it pleases me mightily to cry , "
95771	95817	95751	95751	her	372	" My heart is both sad and glad . But why , you good , patient child - why do you not bear me company ? I only weep tears , delightful and soon wiped away ; you might weep gall , if you choose . "
95818	95825	95768	95768	she	372	" Why should I weep gall ? "
95826	95832	95751	95751	her	372	" Mateless , solitary bird ! "
95838	95848	95751	95751	her	372	" And are not you too mateless , Shirley ? "
95849	95855	95751	95751	her	372	" At heart - no . "
95856	95865	95886	95886	she	372	" Oh ! who nestles there , Shirley ? "
95880	95885	95886	95886	she	372	" I have dreamed , "
95889	95902	96189	96189	Shirley	372	" a mere day - dream - certainly bright , probably baseless ! "
96177	96185	96540	96540	Caroline	279	" Is it Mrs. Pryor and Shirley ? "
96528	96538	96540	96540	Caroline	279	" But I used to be closer to him , "
96542	96824	96976	96976	Shirley	372	" He felt no obligation to treat me with homage ; I needed only kindness . He used to hold my hand ; he does not touch hers . And yet Shirley is not proud where she loves . There is no haughtiness in her aspect now , only a little in her port - what is natural to and inseparable from her , what she retains in her most careless as in her most guarded moments . Robert must think , as I think , that he is at this instant looking down on a fine face ; and he must think it with a man 's brain , not with mine . She has such generous yet soft fire in her eyes . She smiles - what makes her smile so sweet ? I saw that Robert felt its beauty , and he must have felt it with his man 's heart , not with my dim woman 's perceptions . They look to me like two great happy spirits . Yonder silvered pavement reminds me of that white shore we believe to be beyond the death - flood . They have reached it ; they walk there united . And what am I , standing here in shadow , shrinking into concealment , my mind darker than my hiding - place ? I am one of this world , no spirit - a poor doomed mortal , who asks , in ignorance and hopelessness , wherefore she was born , to what end she lives ; whose mind for ever runs on the question , how she shall at last encounter , and by whom be sustained through death .
96825	96973	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" This is the worst passage I have come to yet ; still I was quite prepared for it . I gave Robert up , and gave him up to Shirley , the first day I heard she was come , the first moment I saw her - rich , youthful , and lovely . She has him now . He is her lover . She is his darling . She will be far more his darling yet when they are married . The more Robert knows of Shirley the more his soul will cleave to her . They will both be happy , and I do not grudge them their bliss ; but I groan under my own misery . Some of my suffering is very acute . Truly I ought not to have been born ; they should have smothered me at the first cry . "
97047	97072	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I can not conceive why nature did not give you a bulldog 's head , for you have all a bulldog 's tenacity , "
97076	97087	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Not a flattering idea . Am I so ignoble ? "
97088	97124	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" And something also you have of the same animal 's silent ways of going about its work . You give no warning ; you come noiselessly behind , seize fast , and hold on . "
97125	97151	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" This is guess - work . You have witnessed no such feat on my part . In your presence I have been no bulldog . "
97152	97183	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Your very silence indicates your race . How little you talk in general , yet how deeply you scheme ! You are far - seeing ; you are calculating . "
97184	97275	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I know the ways of these people . I have gathered information of their intentions . My note last night informed you that Barraclough 's trial had ended in his conviction and sentence to transportation . His associates will plot vengeance . I shall lay my plans so as to counteract or at least be prepared for theirs - that is all . Having now given you as clear an explanation as I can , am I to understand that for what I propose doing I have your approbation ? "
97276	97293	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I shall stand by you so long as you remain on the defensive . Yes . "
97294	97341	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Good ! Without any aid - even opposed or disapproved by you - I believe I should have acted precisely as I now intend to act , but in another spirit . I now feel satisfied . On the whole , I relish the position . "
97342	97378	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I dare say you do . That is evident . You relish the work which lies before you still better than you would relish the execution of a government order for army - cloth . "
97379	97386	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I certainly feel it congenial . "
97387	97425	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" So would old Helstone . It is true there is a shade of difference in your motives - many shades , perhaps . Shall I speak to Mr. Helstone ? I will , if you like . "
97426	97470	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Act as you please . Your judgment , Miss Keeldar , will guide you accurately . I could rely on it myself in a more difficult crisis . But I should inform you Mr. Helstone is somewhat prejudiced against me at present . "
97471	97506	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I am aware - I have heard all about your differences . Depend upon it , they will melt away . He can not resist the temptation of an alliance under present circumstances . "
97507	97522	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I should be glad to have him ; he is of true metal . "
97523	97529	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I think so also . "
97530	97547	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" An old blade , and rusty somewhat , but the edge and temper still excellent . "
97548	97568	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Well , you shall have him , Mr. Moore - that is , if I can win him . "
97569	97576	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Whom can you not win ? "
97577	97590	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Perhaps not the rector ; but I will make the effort . "
97591	97604	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Effort ! He will yield for a word - a smile . "
97605	97641	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" By no means . It will cost me several cups of tea , some toast and cake , and an ample measure of remonstrances , expostulations , and persuasions . It grows rather chill . "
97642	97692	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I perceive you shiver . Am I acting wrongly to detain you here ? Yet it is so calm - I even feel it warm - and society such as yours is a pleasure to me so rare . If you were wrapped in a thicker shawl - - "
97693	97738	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I might stay longer , and forget how late it is , which would chagrin Mrs. Pryor . We keep early and regular hours at Fieldhead , Mr. Moore ; and so , I am sure , does your sister at the cottage . "
97739	97765	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Yes ; but Hortense and I have an understanding the most convenient in the world , that we shall each do as we please . "
97766	97774	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" How do you please to do ? "
97775	97808	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Three nights in the week I sleep in the mill - but I require little rest - and when it is moonlight and mild I often haunt the Hollow till daybreak . "
97809	97860	97870	97870	Moore	230	" When I was a very little girl , Mr. Moore , my nurse used to tell me tales of fairies being seen in that Hollow . That was before my father built the mill , when it was a perfectly solitary ravine . You will be falling under enchantment . "
97861	97868	97892	97893	Miss Keeldar	372	" I fear it is done , "
97877	97890	97901	97901	he	230	" But there are worse things than fairies to be guarded against , "
97895	97900	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Things more perilous , "
97904	97946	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Far more so . For instance , how would you like to meet Michael Hartley , that mad Calvinist and Jacobin weaver ? They say he is addicted to poaching , and often goes abroad at night with his gun . "
97947	97978	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I have already had the luck to meet him . We held a long argument together one night . A strange little incident it was ; I liked it . "
97979	97999	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Liked it ? I admire your taste ! Michael is not sane . Where did you meet him ? "
98000	98044	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" In the deepest , shadiest spot in the glen , where the water runs low , under brushwood . We sat down near that plank bridge . It was moonlight , but clouded , and very windy . We had a talk . "
98045	98049	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" On politics ? "
98050	98081	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" And religion . I think the moon was at the full , and Michael was as near crazed as possible . He uttered strange blasphemy in his Antinomian fashion . "
98082	98105	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Excuse me , but I think you must have been nearly as mad as he , to sit listening to him . "
98106	98233	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" There is a wild interest in his ravings . The man would be half a poet , if he were not wholly a maniac ; and perhaps a prophet , if he were not a profligate . He solemnly informed me that hell was foreordained my inevitable portion ; that he read the mark of the beast on my brow ; that I had been an outcast from the beginning . God 's vengeance , he said , was preparing for me , and affirmed that in a vision of the night he had beheld the manner and the instrument of my doom . I wanted to know further , but he left me with these words , ' The end is not yet . ' "
98234	98242	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Have you ever seen him since ? "
98243	98373	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" About a month afterwards , in returning from market , I encountered him and Moses Barraclough , both in an advanced stage of inebriation . They were praying in frantic sort at the roadside . They accosted me as Satan , bid me avaunt , and clamoured to be delivered from temptation . Again , but a few days ago , Michael took the trouble of appearing at the counting - house door , hatless , in his shirt - sleeves - his coat and castor having been detained at the public - house in pledge . He delivered himself of the comfortable message that he could wish Mr. Moore to set his house in order , as his soul was likely shortly to be required of him . "
98374	98383	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Do you make light of these things ? "
98384	98404	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" The poor man had been drinking for weeks , and was in a state bordering on delirium tremens . "
98405	98423	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" What then ? He is the more likely to attempt the fulfilment of his own prophecies . "
98424	98441	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" It would not do to permit incidents of this sort to affect one 's nerves . "
98442	98449	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Mr. Moore , go home ! "
98450	98454	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" So soon ? "
98455	98470	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Pass straight down the fields , not round by the lade and plantations . "
98471	98477	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" It is early yet . "
98478	98506	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" It is late . For my part , I am going in . Will you promise me not to wander in the Hollow to - night ? "
98507	98513	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" If you wish it . "
98514	98529	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" I do wish it . May I ask whether you consider life valueless ? "
98530	98548	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" By no means . On the contrary , of late I regard my life as invaluable . "
98549	98553	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Of late ? "
98554	98616	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Existence is neither aimless nor hopeless to me now , and it was both three months ago . I was then drowning , and rather wished the operation over . All at once a hand was stretched to me - such a delicate hand I scarcely dared trust it ; its strength , however , has rescued me from ruin . "
98617	98623	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" Are you really rescued ? "
98624	98637	97074	97074	Shirley	372	" For the time . Your assistance has given me another chance . "
98638	98663	98952	98952	she	279	" Live to make the best of it . Do n't offer yourself as a target to Michael Hartley ; and good - night ! "
98941	98950	98952	98952	she	279	" Because I have been making my dress , "
98954	98978	98993	98993	Shirley	372	" These fine sunny days began to make me ashamed of my winter merino , so I have furbished up a lighter garment . "
98979	98991	98993	98993	Shirley	372	" In which you look as I like to see you , "
98995	99015	99050	99050	she	375	" You are a lady - like little person , Caroline . - Is she not , Mrs. Pryor ? "
99065	99090	99107	99107	Caroline	279	" You get somewhat thin , my love , and somewhat pale . Do you sleep well ? your eyes have a languid look . "
99098	99105	99107	99107	Caroline	279	" I sometimes dream melancholy dreams , "
99109	99189	99092	99092	she	375	" and if I lie awake for an hour or two in the night , I am continually thinking of the rectory as a dreary old place . You know it is very near the churchyard . The back part of the house is extremely ancient , and it is said that the out - kitchens there were once enclosed in the churchyard , and that there are graves under them . I rather long to leave the rectory . "
99190	99200	99107	99107	Caroline	279	" My dear , you are surely not superstitious ? "
99201	99276	99282	99282	Shirley	372	" No , Mrs. Pryor ; but I think I grow what is called nervous . I see things under a darker aspect than I used to do . I have fears I never used to have - not of ghosts , but of omens and disastrous events ; and I have an inexpressible weight on my mind which I would give the world to shake off , and I can not do it . "
99277	99280	99282	99282	Shirley	372	" Strange ! "
99284	99290	99315	99315	Caroline	279	" I never feel so . "
99296	99313	99315	99315	Caroline	279	" Fine weather , pleasant days , pleasant scenes , are powerless to give me pleasure , "
99317	99377	99387	99388	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Calm evenings are not calm to me . Moonlight , which I used to think mild , now only looks mournful . Is this weakness of mind , Mrs. Pryor , or what is it ? I can not help it . I often struggle against it . I reason ; but reason and effort make no difference . "
99378	99385	99315	99315	Caroline	279	" You should take more exercise , "
99390	99406	99315	99315	Caroline	279	" Exercise ! I exercise sufficiently . I exercise till I am ready to drop . "
99407	99417	99315	99315	Caroline	279	" My dear , you should go from home . "
99418	99467	99474	99474	Shirley	372	" Mrs. Pryor , I should like to go from home , but not on any purposeless excursion or visit . I wish to be a governess , as you have been . It would oblige me greatly if you would speak to my uncle on the subject . "
99468	99471	99474	99474	Shirley	372	" Nonsense ! "
99476	99509	99516	99517	Mrs. Pryor	375	" What an idea ! Be a governess ! Better be a slave at once . Where is the necessity of it ? Why should you dream of such a painful step ? "
99510	99514	99516	99517	Mrs. Pryor	375	" My dear , "
99519	99543	99315	99315	Caroline	279	" you are very young to be a governess , and not sufficiently robust . The duties a governess undertakes are often severe . "
99544	99556	99563	99563	Shirley	372	" And I believe I want severe duties to occupy me . "
99557	99561	99590	99590	she	375	" Occupy you ! "
99565	99589	99590	99590	she	375	" When are you idle ? I never saw a more industrious girl than you . You are always at work . Come , "
99593	99627	99590	99590	she	375	" come and sit by my side , and take some tea to refresh you . You do n't care much for my friendship , then , that you wish to leave me ? "
99628	99653	99697	99697	she	375	" Indeed I do , Shirley ; and I do n't wish to leave you . I shall never find another friend so dear . "
99682	99696	99697	99697	she	375	" If you think so , you had better make much of me , "
99700	99796	99590	99590	she	375	" and not run away from me . I hate to part with those to whom I am become attached . Mrs. Pryor there sometimes talks of leaving me , and says I might make a more advantageous connection than herself . I should as soon think of exchanging an old - fashioned mother for something modish and stylish . As for you - why , I began to flatter myself we were thoroughly friends ; that you liked Shirley almost as well as Shirley likes you , and she does not stint her regard . "
99797	99822	99697	99697	she	375	" I do like Shirley . I like her more and more every day . But that does not make me strong or happy . "
99823	99889	99903	99903	she	372	" And would it make you strong or happy to go and live as a dependent amongst utter strangers ? It would not . And the experiment must not be tried ; I tell you it would fail . It is not in your nature to bear the desolate life governesses generally lead ; you would fall ill . I wo n't hear of it . "
99911	100017	100065	100066	Miss Helstone	279	" Why , it is my daily pleasure now to look out for the little cottage bonnet and the silk scarf glancing through the trees in the lane , and to know that my quiet , shrewd , thoughtful companion and monitress is coming back to me ; that I shall have her sitting in the room to look at , to talk to or to let alone , as she and I please . This may be a selfish sort of language - I know it is - but it is the language which naturally rises to my lips , therefore I utter it . "
100018	100027	99903	99903	she	372	" I would write to you , Shirley . "
100028	100064	100193	100194	her uncle	1340	" And what are letters ? Only a sort of pis aller . Drink some tea , Caroline . Eat something - you eat nothing . Laugh and be cheerful , and stay at home . "
100181	100186	100317	100317	Shirley	372	" take a situation ; "
100307	100315	100317	100317	Shirley	372	" Now , is your mind quieted ? "
100319	100328	100317	100317	Shirley	372	" Will you consent to stay at home ? "
100329	100342	100317	100317	Shirley	372	" I shall not leave it against the approbation of my friends , "
100347	100363	100528	100528	she	372	" but I think in time they will be obliged to think as I do . "
100521	100527	100528	100528	she	372	" Having destroyed your plan , "
100531	100598	100518	100518	Shirley	372	" which I hope I have done , I shall construct a new one of my own . Every summer I make an excursion . This season I propose spending two months either at the Scotch lochs or the English lakes - that is , I shall go there provided you consent to accompany me . If you refuse , I shall not stir a foot . "
100599	100607	100528	100528	she	372	" You are very good , Shirley . "
100608	100776	100786	100786	Caroline	279	" I would be very good if you would let me . I have every disposition to be good . It is my misfortune and habit , I know , to think of myself paramount to anybody else ; but who is not like me in that respect ? However , when Captain Keeldar is made comfortable , accommodated with all he wants , including a sensible , genial comrade , it gives him a thorough pleasure to devote his spare efforts to making that comrade happy . And should we not be happy , Caroline , in the Highlands ? We will go to the Highlands . We will , if you can bear a sea - voyage , go to the Isles - the Hebrides , the Shetland , the Orkney Islands . Would you not like that ? I see you would . - Mrs. Pryor , I call you to witness . Her face is all sunshine at the bare mention of it . "
100777	100784	100823	100823	she	372	" I should like it much , "
100813	100822	100823	100823	she	372	" Come ; I can bestow a benefit , "
100826	100989	101002	101003	Miss Helstone	279	" I can do a good deed with my cash . My thousand a year is not merely a matter of dirty bank - notes and jaundiced guineas let me speak respectfully of both , though , for I adore them , but , it may be , health to the drooping , strength to the weak , consolation to the sad . I was determined to make something of it better than a fine old house to live in , than satin gowns to wear , better than deference from acquaintance and homage from the poor . Here is to begin . This summer , Caroline , Mrs. Pryor and I go out into the North Atlantic , beyond the Shetland , perhaps to the Faroe Isles . We will see seals in Suderoe , and , doubtless , mermaids in Stromoe . - Caroline is laughing , Mrs. Pryor . I made her laugh ; I have done her good . "
100990	100999	101002	101003	Miss Helstone	279	" I shall like to go , Shirley , "
101005	101119	100823	100823	she	372	" I long to hear the sound of waves - ocean - waves - and to see them as I have imagined them in dreams , like tossing banks of green light , strewed with vanishing and reappearing wreaths of foam , whiter than lilies . I shall delight to pass the shores of those lone rock - islets where the sea - birds live and breed unmolested . We shall be on the track of the old Scandinavians - of the Norsemen . We shall almost see the shores of Norway . This is a very vague delight that I feel , communicated by your proposal , but it is a delight . "
101120	101160	101002	101003	Miss Helstone	279	" Will you think of Fitful Head now when you lie awake at night , of gulls shrieking round it , and waves tumbling in upon it , rather than of the graves under the rectory back - kitchen ? "
101161	101227	100823	100823	she	372	" I will try ; and instead of musing about remnants of shrouds , and fragments of coffins , and human bones and mould , I will fancy seals lying in the sunshine on solitary shores , where neither fisherman nor hunter ever come ; of rock crevices full of pearly eggs bedded in seaweed ; of unscared birds covering white sands in happy flocks . "
101228	101245	101002	101003	Miss Helstone	279	" And what will become of that inexpressible weight you said you had on your mind ? "
101246	101325	100823	100823	she	372	" I will try to forget it in speculation on the sway of the whole great deep above a herd of whales rushing through the livid and liquid thunder down from the frozen zone - a hundred of them , perhaps , wallowing , flashing , rolling in the wake of a patriarch bull , huge enough to have been spawned before the Flood , such a creature as poor Smart had in his mind when he said , -
101340	101340	100823	100823	she	372	"
101341	101409	100823	100823	she	372	" I hope our bark will meet with no such shoal , or herd as you term it , Caroline . I suppose you fancy the sea - mammoths pasturing about the bases of the ' everlasting hills , ' devouring strange provender in the vast valleys through and above which sea - billows roll . I should not like to be capsized by the patriarch bull . "
101410	101421	100823	100823	she	372	" I suppose you expect to see mermaids , Shirley ? "
101422	101739	101963	101963	She	372	" One of them , at any rate - I do not bargain for less - and she is to appear in some such fashion as this . I am to be walking by myself on deck , rather late of an August evening , watching and being watched by a full harvest moon . Something is to rise white on the surface of the sea , over which that moon mounts silent and hangs glorious . The object glitters and sinks . It rises again . I think I hear it cry with an articulate voice ; I call you up from the cabin ; I show you an image , fair as alabaster , emerging from the dim wave . We both see the long hair , the lifted and foam - white arm , the oval mirror brilliant as a star . It glides nearer ; a human face is plainly visible - a face in the style of yours - whose straight , pure excuse the word , it is appropriate - whose straight , pure lineaments paleness does not disfigure . It looks at us , but not with your eyes . I see a preternatural lure in its wily glance . It beckons . Were we men , we should spring at the sign - the cold billow would be dared for the sake of the colder enchantress ; being women , we stand safe , though not dreadless . She comprehends our unmoved gaze ; she feels herself powerless ; anger crosses her front ; she can not charm , but she will appal us ; she rises high , and glides all revealed on the dark wave - ridge . Temptress - terror ! monstrous likeness of ourselves ! Are you not glad , Caroline , when at last , and with a wild shriek , she dives ? "
101740	101762	100823	100823	she	372	" But , Shirley , she is not like us . We are neither temptresses , nor terrors , nor monsters . "
101763	101793	101963	101963	She	372	" Some of our kind , it is said , are all three . There are men who ascribe to ' woman , ' in general , such attributes . "
101794	101798	101801	101802	Mrs. Pryor	375	" My dears , "
101804	101823	100823	100823	she	372	" does it not strike you that your conversation for the last ten minutes has been rather fanciful ? "
101824	101839	101801	101802	Mrs. Pryor	375	" But there is no harm in our fancies ; is there , ma'am ? "
101840	101870	101879	101879	Shirley	372	" We are aware that mermaids do not exist ; why speak of them as if they did ? How can you find interest in speaking of a nonentity ? "
101871	101877	101801	101802	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I do n't know , "
101881	101915	101932	101932	she	372	" My dear , I think there is an arrival . I heard a step in the lane while you were talking ; and is not that the garden - gate which creaks ? "
101922	101930	102103	102103	he	230	" Yes , there is some one , "
102093	102102	102103	102103	he	230	" I am just returned from Stilbro ' , "
102114	102131	102144	102144	she	372	" and I thought I would call to impart to you the result of my mission . "
102132	102143	102144	102144	she	372	" You did right not to keep me in suspense , "
102147	102180	102197	102197	he	230	" and your visit is well timed . Sit down . We have not finished tea . Are you English enough to relish tea , or do you faithfully adhere to coffee ? "
102185	102195	102197	102197	he	230	" I am learning to be a naturalized Englishman , "
102199	102210	102444	102444	he	230	" my foreign habits are leaving me one by one . "
102436	102443	102444	102444	he	230	" I went to the barracks , "
102447	102515	102524	102524	Shirley	372	" and had an interview with Colonel Ryde . He approved my plans , and promised the aid I wanted . Indeed , he offered a more numerous force than I require - half a dozen will suffice . I do n't intend to be swamped by redcoats . They are needed for appearance rather than anything else . My main reliance is on my own civilians . "
102516	102522	102534	102534	Moore	230	" And on their captain , "
102526	102532	102565	102565	Shirley	372	" What , Captain Keeldar ? "
102560	102563	102565	102565	Shirley	372	" No , "
102571	102591	102603	102603	Moore	403	" Captain Gérard Moore , who trusts much to the prowess of his own right arm , I believe . "
102592	102601	102610	102610	he	230	" Furnished with his counting - house ruler , "
102614	102733	103235	103235	Caroline	279	" I received by this evening 's post a note from the Home Secretary in answer to mine . It appears they are uneasy at the state of matters here in the north ; they especially condemn the supineness and pusillanimity of the mill - owners . They say , as I have always said , that inaction , under present circumstances , is criminal , and that cowardice is cruelty , since both can only encourage disorder , and lead finally to sanguinary outbreaks . There is the note - I brought it for your perusal ; and there is a batch of newspapers , containing further accounts of proceedings in Nottingham , Manchester , and elsewhere . "
103228	103233	103183	103184	the heiress	2505	" How is Hortense ? "
103238	103253	103235	103235	Caroline	279	" Very well ; but she complains of being unemployed . She misses you . "
103254	103275	103183	103184	the heiress	2505	" Tell her that I miss her , and that I write and read a portion of French every day . "
103276	103300	103235	103235	Caroline	279	" She will ask if you sent your love ; she is always particular on that point . You know she likes attention . "
103301	103334	103183	103184	the heiress	2505	" My best love - my very best . And say to her that whenever she has time to write me a little note I shall be glad to hear from her . "
103335	103350	103235	103235	Caroline	279	" What if I forget ? I am not the surest messenger of compliments . "
103351	103371	103183	103184	the heiress	2505	" No , do n't forget , Robert . It is no compliment ; it is in good earnest . "
103372	103382	103235	103235	Caroline	279	" And must , therefore , be delivered punctually . "
103383	103388	103183	103184	the heiress	2505	" If you please . "
103389	103434	103694	103694	she	372	" Hortense will be ready to shed tears . She is tenderhearted on the subject of her pupil ; yet she reproaches you sometimes for obeying your uncle 's injunctions too literally . Affection , like love , will be unjust now and then . "
103680	103693	103740	103740	He	216	" And are you glad or sad for all these menacing tidings ? "
103700	103739	104214	104214	She	279	" Not precisely either ; but I certainly am instructed . I see that our only plan is to be firm . I see that efficient preparation and a resolute attitude are the best means of averting bloodshed . "
104221	104228	104229	104229	Shirley	372	" Good - night , Shirley ! "
104233	104244	104214	104214	She	279	" What ! so soon ? Are you going already ? "
104245	104251	104229	104229	Shirley	372	" It is past nine . "
104252	104284	104290	104290	Caroline	279	" I never heard the clock . You will come again to - morrow , and you will be happy to - night , will you not ? Remember our plans . "
104285	104288	104290	104290	Caroline	279	" Yes , "
104292	104298	104392	104392	she	279	" I have not forgotten . "
104386	104391	104420	104420	he	216	" Good - night ! "
104413	104419	104392	104392	she	279	" You are going home ? "
104428	104431	104392	104392	she	279	" Yes . "
104432	104439	104392	104392	she	279	" Is Fanny come for you ? "
104440	104443	104392	104392	she	279	" Yes . "
104444	104477	104552	104552	he	216	" I may as well accompany you a step of the way ; not up to the rectory , though , lest my old friend Helstone should shoot me from the window . "
104543	104551	104552	104552	he	216	" You may run on , Fanny , "
104558	104564	104638	104638	Moore	216	" we shall overtake you . "
104625	104636	104638	104638	Moore	216	" And there is no doubt the liking is mutual , "
104640	104677	104621	104621	she	279	" If she professes friendship , be certain she is sincere . She can not feign ; she scorns hypocrisy . And , Caroline , are we never to see you at Hollow 's Cottage again ? "
104678	104691	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I suppose not , unless my uncle should change his mind . "
104692	104699	104621	104621	she	279	" Are you much alone now ? "
104700	104719	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Yes , a good deal . I have little pleasure in any society but Miss Keeldar 's . "
104720	104728	104621	104621	she	279	" Have you been quite well lately ? "
104729	104732	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Quite . "
104733	104772	104621	104621	she	279	" You must take care of yourself . Be sure not to neglect exercise . Do you know I fancied you somewhat altered - a little fallen away , and pale . Is your uncle kind to you ? "
104773	104784	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Yes ; he is just as he always is . "
104785	104813	104621	104621	she	279	" Not too tender , that is to say - not too protective and attentive . And what ails you , then ? Tell me , Lina . "
104814	104819	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Nothing , Robert . "
104825	104858	104638	104638	Moore	216	" That is to say , nothing that you will tell me . I am not to be taken into confidence . Separation is then quite to estrange us , is it ? "
104859	104872	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I do not know . Sometimes I almost fear it is . "
104873	104898	104638	104638	Moore	216	" But it ought not to have that effect . ' Should auld acquaintance be forgot , and days o ' lang syne ? ' "
104899	104907	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Robert , I do n't forget . "
104908	104927	104638	104638	Moore	216	" It is two months , I should think , Caroline , since you were at the cottage . "
104928	104937	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Since I was within it - yes . "
104938	104949	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Have you ever passed that way in your walk ? "
104950	105035	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I have come to the top of the fields sometimes of an evening and looked down . Once I saw Hortense in the garden watering her flowers , and I know at what time you light your lamp in the counting - house . I have waited for it to shine out now and then , and I have seen you bend between it and the window . I knew it was you ; I could almost trace the outline of your form . "
105036	105058	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I wonder I never encountered you . I occasionally walk to the top of the Hollow 's fields after sunset . "
105059	105080	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I know you do . I had almost spoken to you one night , you passed so near me . "
105081	105100	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Did I ? I passed near you , and did not see you ! Was I alone ? "
105101	105114	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I saw you twice , and neither time were you alone . "
105115	105134	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Who was my companion ? Probably nothing but Joe Scott , or my own shadow by moonlight . "
105135	105207	104638	104638	Moore	216	" No ; neither Joe Scott nor your shadow , Robert . The first time you were with Mr. Yorke ; and the second time what you call your shadow was a shape with a white forehead and dark curls , and a sparkling necklace round its neck . But I only just got a glimpse of you and that fairy shadow ; I did not wait to hear you converse . "
105208	105302	104638	104638	Moore	216	" It appears you walk invisible . I noticed a ring on your hand this evening ; can it be the ring of Gyges ? Henceforth , when sitting in the counting - house by myself , perhaps at dead of night , I shall permit myself to imagine that Caroline may be leaning over my shoulder reading with me from the same book , or sitting at my side engaged in her own particular task , and now and then raising her unseen eyes to my face to read there my thoughts . "
105303	105331	104638	104638	Moore	216	" You need fear no such infliction . I do not come near you ; I only stand afar off , watching what may become of you . "
105332	105413	104638	104638	Moore	216	" When I walk out along the hedgerows in the evening after the mill is shut , or at night when I take the watchman 's place , I shall fancy the flutter of every little bird over its nest , the rustle of every leaf , a movement made by you ; tree - shadows will take your shape ; in the white sprays of hawthorn I shall imagine glimpses of you . Lina , you will haunt me . "
105414	105440	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I will never be where you would not wish me to be , nor see nor hear what you would wish unseen and unheard . "
105441	105549	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I shall see you in my very mill in broad daylight . Indeed , I have seen you there once . But a week ago I was standing at the top of one of my long rooms ; girls were working at the other end , and amongst half a dozen of them , moving to and fro , I seemed to see a figure resembling yours . It was some effect of doubtful light or shade , or of dazzling sunbeam . I walked up to this group . What I sought had glided away ; I found myself between two buxom lasses in pinafores . "
105550	105568	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I shall not follow you into your mill , Robert , unless you call me there . "
105569	105810	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Nor is that the only occasion on which imagination has played me a trick . One night , when I came home late from market , I walked into the cottage parlour thinking to find Hortense ; but instead of her I thought I found you . There was no candle in the room ; my sister had taken the light upstairs with her . The window - blind was not drawn , and broad moonbeams poured through the panes . There you were , Lina , at the casement , shrinking a little to one side in an attitude not unusual with you . You were dressed in white , as I have seen you dressed at an evening party . For half a second your fresh , living face seemed turned towards me , looking at me ; for half a second my idea was to go and take your hand , to chide you for your long absence , and welcome your present visit . Two steps forward broke the spell . The drapery of the dress changed outline ; the tints of the complexion dissolved , and were formless . Positively , as I reached the spot , there was nothing left but the sweep of a white muslin curtain , and a balsam plant in a flower - pot , covered with a flush of bloom . ' Sic transit , ' et cetera . "
105811	105826	104638	104638	Moore	216	" It was not my wraith , then ? I almost thought it was . "
105827	105845	104638	104638	Moore	216	" No ; only gauze , crockery , and pink blossom - a sample of earthly illusions . "
105846	105863	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I wonder you have time for such illusions , occupied as your mind must be . "
105864	105932	104638	104638	Moore	216	" So do I. But I find in myself , Lina , two natures - one for the world and business , and one for home and leisure . Gérard Moore is a hard dog , brought up to mill and market ; the person you call your cousin Robert is sometimes a dreamer , who lives elsewhere than in Cloth - hall and counting - house . "
105933	105974	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Your two natures agree with you . I think you are looking in good spirits and health . You have quite lost that harassed air which it often pained one to see in your face a few months ago . "
105975	106004	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Do you observe that ? Certainly I am disentangled of some difficulties . I have got clear of some shoals , and have more sea - room . "
106005	106023	104638	104638	Moore	216	" And , with a fair wind , you may now hope to make a prosperous voyage ? "
106024	106067	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I may hope it - yes - but hope is deceptive . There is no controlling wind or wave . Gusts and swells perpetually trouble the mariner 's course ; he dare not dismiss from his mind the expectation of tempest . "
106068	106101	104638	104638	Moore	216	" But you are ready for a breeze ; you are a good seaman , an able commander . You are a skilful pilot , Robert ; you will weather the storm . "
106102	106153	104638	104638	Moore	216	" My kinswoman always thinks the best of me , but I will take her words for a propitious omen . I will consider that in meeting her to - night I have met with one of those birds whose appearance is to the sailor the harbinger of good luck . "
106154	106218	104638	104638	Moore	216	" A poor harbinger of good luck is she who can do nothing , who has no power . I feel my incapacity . It is of no use saying I have the will to serve you when I can not prove it . Yet I have that will . I wish you success . I wish you high fortune and true happiness . "
106219	106307	104638	104638	Moore	216	" When did you ever wish me anything else ? What is Fanny waiting for ? I told her to walk on . Oh ! we have reached the churchyard . Then we are to part here , I suppose . We might have sat a few minutes in the church porch , if the girl had not been with us . It is so fine a night , so summer - mild and still , I have no particular wish to return yet to the Hollow . "
106308	106321	106326	106326	Moore	216	" But we can not sit in the porch now , Robert . "
106334	106358	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Perhaps not . But tell Fanny to go in . Say we are coming . A few minutes will make no difference . "
106365	106388	104638	104638	Moore	216	" My uncle will be coming out to take his usual sentinel round , and he always surveys the church and churchyard . "
106389	106471	106487	106487	Caroline	279	" And if he does ? If it were not for Fanny , who knows we are here , I should find pleasure in dodging and eluding him . We could be under the east window when he is at the porch ; as he came round to the north side we could wheel off to the south ; we might at a pinch hide behind some of the monuments . That tall erection of the Wynnes would screen us completely . "
106472	106485	106487	106487	Caroline	279	" Robert , what good spirits you have ! Go ! go ! "
106490	106498	104638	104638	Moore	216	" I hear the front door - - "
106499	106516	106487	106487	Caroline	279	" I do n't want to go ; on the contrary , I want to stay . "
106517	106539	104638	104638	Moore	216	" You know my uncle will be terribly angry . He forbade me to see you because you are a Jacobin . "
106540	106545	106487	106487	Caroline	279	" A queer Jacobin ! "
106546	106560	104638	104638	Moore	216	" Go , Robert , he is coming ; I hear him cough . "
106561	106577	106590	106590	Caroline	279	" Diable ! It is strange - what a pertinacious wish I feel to stay ! "
106578	106588	104638	104638	Moore	216	" You remember what he did to Fanny 's - "
106597	106599	106645	106645	he	216	" Sweetheart "
106639	106644	106645	106645	he	216	" Fanny 's sweetheart ? "
106650	106714	106792	106792	Moore	216	" He gave him a shower - bath under the pump , did he not ? He 'd do as much for me , I dare say , with pleasure . I should like to provoke the old Turk - not , however , against you . But he would make a distinction between a cousin and a lover , would he not ? "
106715	106776	106792	106792	Moore	216	" Oh , he would not think of you in that way , of course not ; his quarrel with you is entirely political . Yet I should not like the breach to be widened , and he is so testy . Here he is at the garden gate . For your own sake and mine , Robert , go ! "
106811	106816	106882	106882	He	216	" Good - night ! "
106885	106887	107210	107210	She	1506	" dodge "
107199	107209	107331	107331	she	1506	" wee sma ' hours ayont the twal ' . "
107348	107376	107555	107555	her	1506	" I am not cherishing love dreams ; I am only thinking because I can not sleep . Of course , I know he will marry Shirley . "
107542	107553	107579	107579	she	1506	" Of course , I know he will marry Shirley , "
107565	107578	107579	107579	she	1506	" And he ought to marry her . She can help him , "
107583	107594	107579	107579	she	1506	" But I shall be forgotten when they are married , "
107601	107935	108076	108076	her	2726	" Oh ! I shall be wholly forgotten ! And what - what shall I do when Robert is taken quite from me ? Where shall I turn ? My Robert ! I wish I could justly call him mine . But I am poverty and incapacity ; Shirley is wealth and power . And she is beauty too , and love . I can not deny it . This is no sordid suit . She loves him - not with inferior feelings . She loves , or will love , as he must feel proud to be loved . Not a valid objection can be made . Let them be married , then . But afterwards I shall be nothing to him . As for being his sister , and all that stuff , I despise it . I will either be all or nothing to a man like Robert ; no feeble shuffling or false ca nt is endurable . Once let that pair be united , and I will certainly leave them . As for lingering about , playing the hypocrite , and pretending to calm sentiments of friendship , when my soul will be wrung with other feelings , I shall not descend to such degradation . As little could I fill the place of their mutual friend as that of their deadly foe ; as little could I stand between them as trample over them . Robert is a first - rate man - in my eyes . I have loved , do love , and must love him . I would be his wife if I could ; as I can not , I must go where I shall never see him . There is but one alternative - to cleave to him as if I were a part of him , or to be sundered from him wide as the two poles of a sphere . - Sunder me then , Providence . Part us speedily . "
108046	108055	108076	108076	her	2726	" the crackling of thorns under a pot . "
108056	108074	108096	108097	Miss Helstone	279	" What do you mean by not coming to see me this afternoon , as you promised ? "
108086	108094	108116	108116	she	372	" I was not in the humour , "
108112	108115	108116	108116	she	372	" No , "
108119	108169	108246	108246	she	372	" I see you are not in the humour for loving me . You are in one of your sunless , inclement moods , when one feels a fellow - creature 's presence is not welcome to you . You have such moods . Are you aware of it ? "
108170	108180	108116	108116	she	372	" Do you mean to stay long , Shirley ? "
108181	108217	108246	108246	she	372	" Yes . I am come to have my tea , and must have it before I go . I shall take the liberty , then , of removing my bonnet , without being asked . "
108235	108245	108246	108246	she	372	" A pretty expression you have in your countenance , "
108265	108301	108246	108246	she	372	" Wonderfully self - supported you look , you solitude - seeking , wounded deer . Are you afraid Shirley will worry you if she discovers that you are hurt , and that you bleed ? "
108302	108309	108246	108246	she	372	" I never do fear Shirley . "
108310	108365	108246	108246	she	372	" But sometimes you dislike her ; often you avoid her . Shirley can feel when she is slighted and shunned . If you had not walked home in the company you did last night , you would have been a different girl to - day . What time did you reach the rectory ? "
108366	108370	108246	108246	she	372	" By ten . "
108371	108398	108246	108246	she	372	" Humph ! You took three - quarters of an hour to walk a mile . Was it you , or Moore , who lingered so ? "
108399	108406	108246	108246	she	372	" Shirley , you talk nonsense . "
108407	108478	108488	108488	she	2729	" He talked nonsense - that I doubt not ; or he looked it , which is a thousand times worse . I see the reflection of his eyes on your forehead at this moment . I feel disposed to call him out , if I could only get a trustworthy second . I feel desperately irritated . I felt so last night , and have felt it all day . "
108479	108487	108488	108488	she	2729	" You do n't ask me why , "
108495	108555	108246	108246	she	372	" you little silent , over - modest thing ; and you do n't deserve that I should pour out my secrets into your lap without an invitation . Upon my word , I could have found it in my heart to have dogged Moore yesterday evening with dire intent . I have pistols , and can use them . "
108556	108571	108488	108488	she	2729	" Stuff , Shirley ! Which would you have shot - me or Robert ? "
108572	108657	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" Neither , perhaps . Perhaps myself - more likely a bat or a tree - bough . He is a puppy , your cousin - a quiet , serious , sensible , judicious , ambitious puppy . I see him standing before me , talking his half - stern , half - gentle talk , bearing me down as I am very conscious he does with his fixity of purpose , etc . ; and then - I have no patience with him ! "
108689	108694	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" You are mistaken , "
108702	108717	108658	108659	Miss Keeldar	372	" Robert is no puppy or male flirt ; I can vouch for that . "
108718	108763	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" You vouch for it ! Do you think I 'll take your word on the subject ? There is no one 's testimony I would not credit sooner than yours . To advance Moore 's fortune you would cut off your right hand . "
108764	108795	108658	108659	Miss Keeldar	372	" But not tell lies . And if I speak the truth , I must assure you that he was just civil to me last night - that was all . "
108796	108831	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" I never asked what he was . I can guess . I saw him from the window take your hand in his long fingers , just as he went out at my gate . "
108832	108856	108875	108876	Miss Keeldar	372	" That is nothing . I am not a stranger , you know . I am an old acquaintance , and his cousin . "
108857	108873	108884	108884	she	372	" I feel indignant , and that is the long and short of the matter , "
108878	108883	108884	108884	she	372	" All my comfort , "
108888	108958	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" is broken up by his manouvres . He keeps intruding between you and me . Without him we should be good friends ; but that six feet of puppyhood makes a perpetually - recurring eclipse of our friendship . Again and again he crosses and obscures the disc I want always to see clear ; ever and anon he renders me to you a mere bore and nuisance . "
108959	108966	108884	108884	she	372	" No , Shirley , no . "
108967	109056	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" He does . You did not want my society this afternoon , and I feel it hard . You are naturally somewhat reserved , but I am a social personage , who can not live alone . If we were but left unmolested , I have that regard for you that I could bear you in my presence for ever , and not for the fraction of a second do I ever wish to be rid of you . You can not say as much respecting me . "
109057	109073	108884	108884	she	372	" Shirley , I can say anything you wish . Shirley , I like you . "
109074	109087	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" You will wish me at Jericho to - morrow , Lina . "
109088	109167	109173	109174	Miss Keeldar	372	" I shall not . I am every day growing more accustomed to - fonder of you . You know I am too English to get up a vehement friendship all at once ; but you are so much better than common - you are so different to every - day young ladies - I esteem you , I value you ; you are never a burden to me - never . Do you believe what I say ? "
109168	109171	109173	109174	Miss Keeldar	372	" Partly , "
109180	109216	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" but you are a peculiar personage . Quiet as you look , there is both a force and a depth somewhere within not easily reached or appreciated . Then you certainly are not happy . "
109217	109231	109173	109174	Miss Keeldar	372	" And unhappy people are rarely good . Is that what you mean ? "
109232	109314	108696	108696	Caroline	279	" Not at all . I mean rather that unhappy people are often preoccupied , and not in the mood for discoursing with companions of my nature . Moreover , there is a sort of unhappiness which not only depresses , but corrodes ; and that , I fear , is your portion . Will pity do you any good , Lina ? If it will , take some from Shirley ; she offers largely , and warrants the article genuine . "
109315	109467	109505	109506	the other	918	" Shirley , I never had a sister - you never had a sister ; but it flashes on me at this moment how sisters feel towards each other - affection twined with their life , which no shocks of feeling can uproot , which little quarrels only trample an instant , that it may spring more freshly when the pressure is removed ; affection that no passion can ultimately outrival , with which even love itself can not do more than compete in force and truth . Love hurts us so , Shirley . It is so tormenting , so racking , and it burns away our strength with its flame . In affection is no pain and no fire , only sustenance and balm . I am supported and soothed when you - that is , you only - are near , Shirley . Do you believe me now ? "
109468	109497	109505	109506	the other	918	" I am always easy of belief when the creed pleases me . We really are friends , then , Lina , in spite of the black eclipse ? "
109498	109503	109505	109506	the other	918	" We really are , "
109519	109524	109505	109506	the other	918	" chance what may . "
109525	109540	109545	109546	the rector	932	" Come , then ; we will talk of something else than the Troubler . "
109555	109588	109835	109835	she	2738	" of which Miss Keeldar was about to talk was not again alluded to till the moment of her departure . She then delayed a few minutes in the passage to say , "
109850	109850	109894	109894	She	372	"
109899	109903	109969	109969	she	372	" casting an eye "
109955	109967	109969	109969	she	372	" I have lectured her on the duty of being careful , "
109971	110289	109924	109924	she	372	" in a way quite new to her . So eloquent was I on the text of economy that I surprised myself ; for , you see , it is altogether a fresh idea . I never thought , much less spoke , on the subject till lately . But it is all theory ; for when I came to the practical part I could retrench nothing . I had not firmness to take off a single pound of butter , or to prosecute to any clear result an inquest into the destiny of either dripping , lard , bread , cold meat , or other kitchen perquisite whatever . I know we never get up illuminations at Fieldhead , but I could not ask the meaning of sundry quite unaccountable pounds of candles . We do not wash for the parish , yet I viewed in silence items of soap and bleaching - powder calculated to satisfy the solicitude of the most anxious inquirer after our position in reference to those articles . Carnivorous I am not , nor is Mrs. Pryor , nor is Mrs. Gill herself , yet I only hemmed and opened my eyes a little wide when I saw butchers ' bills whose figures seemed to prove that fact - falsehood , I mean . Caroline , you may laugh at me , but you ca n't change me . I am a poltroon on certain points ; I feel it . There is a base alloy of moral cowardice in my composition . I blushed and hung my head before Mrs. Gill , when she ought to have been faltering confessions to me . I found it impossible to get up the spirit even to hint , much less to prove , to her that she was a cheat . I have no calm dignity , no true courage about me . "
110290	110330	109969	109969	she	372	" Shirley , what fit of self - injustice is this ? My uncle , who is not given to speak well of women , says there are not ten thousand men in England as genuinely fearless as you . "
110331	110557	109924	109924	she	372	" I am fearless , physically ; I am never nervous about danger . I was not startled from self - possession when Mr. Wynne 's great red bull rose with a bellow before my face , as I was crossing the cowslip lea alone , stooped his begrimed , sullen head , and made a run at me ; but I was afraid of seeing Mrs. Gill brought to shame and confusion of face . You have twice - ten times - my strength of mind on certain subjects , Caroline . You , whom no persuasion can induce to pass a bull , however quiet he looks , would have firmly shown my housekeeper she had done wrong ; then you would have gently and wisely admonished her ; and at last , I dare say , provided she had seemed penitent , you would have very sweetly forgiven her . Of this conduct I am incapable . However , in spite of exaggerated imposition , I still find we live within our means . I have money in hand , and I really must do some good with it . The Briarfield poor are badly off ; they must be helped . What ought I to do , think you , Lina ? Had I not better distribute the cash at once ? "
110558	110673	109969	109969	she	372	" No , indeed , Shirley ; you will not manage properly . I have often noticed that your only notion of charity is to give shillings and half - crowns in a careless , free - handed sort of way , which is liable to continual abuse . You must have a prime minister , or you will get yourself into a series of scrapes . You suggested Miss Ainley yourself ; to Miss Ainley I will apply . And , meantime , promise to keep quiet , and not begin throwing away your money . What a great deal you have , Shirley ! You must feel very rich with all that ? "
110674	110744	109924	109924	she	372	" Yes ; I feel of consequence . It is not an immense sum , but I feel responsible for its disposal ; and really this responsibility weighs on my mind more heavily than I could have expected . They say that there are some families almost starving to death in Briarfield . Some of my own cottagers are in wretched circumstances . I must and will help them . "
110745	110760	109969	109969	she	372	" Some people say we should n't give alms to the poor , Shirley . "
110761	110843	109924	109924	she	372	" They are great fools for their pains . For those who are not hungry , it is easy to palaver about the degradation of charity , and so on : but they forget the brevity of life , as well as its bitterness . We have none of us long to live . Let us help each other through seasons of want and woe as well as we can , without heeding in the least the scruples of vain philosophy . "
110844	110862	109969	109969	she	372	" But you do help others , Shirley . You give a great deal as it is . "
110863	111008	109924	109924	she	372	" Not enough . I must give more , or , I tell you , my brother 's blood will some day be crying to Heaven against me . For , after all , if political incendiaries come here to kindle conflagration in the neighbourhood , and my property is attacked , I shall defend it like a tigress - I know I shall . Let me listen to Mercy as long as she is near me . Her voice once drowned by the shout of ruffian defiance , and I shall be full of impulses to resist and quell . If once the poor gather and rise in the form of the mob , I shall turn against them as an aristocrat ; if they bully me , I must defy : if they attack , I must resist , and I will . "
111009	111015	109969	109969	she	372	" You talk like Robert . "
111016	111109	109924	109924	she	372	" I feel like Robert , only more fierily . Let them meddle with Robert , or Robert 's mill , or Robert 's interests , and I shall hate them . At present I am no patrician , nor do I regard the poor around me as plebeians ; but if once they violently wrong me or mine , and then presume to dictate to us , I shall quite forget pity for their wretchedness and respect for their poverty , in scorn of their ignorance and wrath at their insolence . "
111110	111118	109969	109969	she	372	" Shirley , how your eyes flash ! "
111119	111141	109924	109924	she	372	" Because my soul burns . Would you , any more than me , let Robert be borne down by numbers ? "
111142	111194	111392	111392	her	279	" If I had your power to aid Robert , I would use it as you mean to use it . If I could be such a friend to him as you can be , I would stand by him , as you mean to stand by him , till death . "
111195	111349	113055	113056	Mr. Hall	223	" And now , Lina , though your eyes do n't flash , they glow . You drop your lids ; but I saw a kindled spark . However , it is not yet come to fighting . What I want to do is to prevent mischief . I can not forget , either day or night , that these embittered feelings of the poor against the rich have been generated in suffering : they would neither hate nor envy us if they did not deem us so much happier than themselves . To allay this suffering , and thereby lessen this hate , let me , out of my abundance , give abundantly ; and that the donation may go farther , let it be made wisely . To that intent , we must introduce some clear , calm , practical sense into our councils . So go and fetch Miss Ainley . "
113043	113053	113159	113159	she	372	" I know the hand which drew up that , "
113151	113157	113159	113159	she	372	" This scheme is nothing , "
113162	113187	113268	113268	he	243	" It is only an outline - a mere suggestion . You , gentlemen , are requested to draw up rules of your own . "
113271	113309	113315	113315	Shirley	372	" Well , you are neither my wife nor my daughter , so I 'll be led for once ; but mind - I know I am led . Your little female manouvres do n't blind me . "
113310	113313	113359	113359	she	372	" Oh ! "
113331	113357	113359	113359	she	372	" you must regard me as Captain Keeldar to - day . This is quite a gentleman 's affair - yours and mine entirely , doctor "
113365	113395	114068	114068	she	372	" The ladies there are only to be our aides - de - camp , and at their peril they speak , till we have settled the whole business . "
114055	114066	114068	114068	she	372	" I rather like to entertain a circle of gentlemen , "
114070	114188	114208	114208	Caroline	279	" It is amusing to observe how they enjoy a judiciously concocted repast . For ourselves , you see , these choice wines and these scientific dishes are of no importance to us ; but gentlemen seem to retain something of the naiveté of children about food , and one likes to please them - that is , when they show the becoming , decent self - government of our admirable rectors . I watch Moore sometimes , to try and discover how he can be pleased ; but he has not that child 's simplicity about him . Did you ever find out his accessible point , Caroline ? you have seen more of him than I. "
114189	114206	114271	114271	she	279	" It is not , at any rate , that of my uncle and Dr. Boultby , "
114267	114270	114271	114271	she	279	" But , "
114274	114305	114313	114313	Shirley	372	" I really do n't know what it is , for I never watched Robert in my life but my scrutiny was presently baffled by finding he was watching me . "
114306	114311	114313	114313	Shirley	372	" There it is ! "
114315	114412	114470	114470	she	279	" You ca n't fix your eyes on him but his presently flash on you . He is never off his guard . He wo n't give you an advantage . Even when he does not look at you , his thoughts seem to be busy amongst your own thoughts , tracing your words and actions to their source , contemplating your motives at his ease . Oh ! I know that sort of character , or something in the same style . It is one that piques me singularly . How does it affect you ? "
114457	114469	114481	114481	Shirley	372	" Pique you ? In what way does it pique you ? "
114473	114478	114481	114481	Shirley	372	" Here he comes ! "
114494	114601	114666	114666	Shirley	372	" Here comes a diversion . I never told you of a superb conquest I have made lately - made at those parties to which I can never persuade you to accompany me ; and the thing has been done without effort or intention on my part - that I aver . There is the bell - and , by all that 's delicious ! there are two of them . Do they never hunt , then , except in couples ? You may have one , Lina , and you may take your choice . I hope I am generous enough . Listen to Tartar ! "
114660	114663	114666	114666	Shirley	372	" Listen ! "
114670	114712	114778	114780	the high voice	2840	" You would think that the prelude to a bloody onslaught . They will be frightened . They do n't know old Tartar as I do . They are not aware his uproars are all sound and fury , signifying nothing ! "
114718	114725	114778	114780	the high voice	2840	" Down , sir , down ! "
114762	114768	114778	114780	the high voice	2840	" O Malone , Malone ! "
114769	114776	114791	114791	Shirley	372	" Down ! down ! down ! "
114782	114789	114791	114791	Shirley	372	" He really is worrying them ! "
114793	114814	114881	114884	a group of servants	2845	" They have struck him . A blow is what he is not used to , and will not take . "
114860	114867	114969	114969	you	2854	" Down ! down ! down ! "
114948	114951	114982	114982	he	377	" Gentlemen , "
114989	114989	115102	115102	Shirley	372	"
115091	115100	115102	115102	Shirley	372	" Mr. Malone , how do you do ? "
115115	115155	115163	115163	Malone	196	" That is not the way to the oak parlour ; that is Mrs. Pryor 's apartment . Request your friend Mr. Donne to evacuate . I shall have the greatest pleasure in receiving him in a lower room . "
115156	115161	115194	115194	he	196	" Ha ! ha ! "
115180	115193	115194	115194	he	196	" Really that animal alarmed Donne . He is a little timid , "
115207	115221	115242	115242	her	2861	" I thought it better to follow , in order to reassure him . "
115222	115239	115242	115242	her	2861	" It appears you did . Well , come down , if you please . - John "
115245	115265	116403	116403	he	195	" go upstairs and liberate Mr. Donne . - Take care , Mr. Malone ; the stairs are slippery . "
116415	116434	116400	116400	his	195	" A very dangerous dog that , Miss Keeldar . I wonder you should keep such an animal . "
116435	116458	116403	116403	he	195	" Do you , Mr. Donne ? Perhaps you will wonder more when I tell you I am very fond of him . "
116459	116496	116400	116400	his	195	" I should say you are not serious in the assertion . Ca n't fancy a lady fond of that brute - ' tis so ugly - a mere carter 's dog . Pray hang him . "
116497	116505	116403	116403	he	195	" Hang what I am fond of ! "
116506	116533	116400	116400	his	195	" And purchase in his stead some sweetly pooty pug or poodle - something appropriate to the fair sex . Ladies generally like lap - dogs . "
116534	116541	116403	116403	he	195	" Perhaps I am an exception . "
116542	116566	116400	116400	his	195	" Oh , you ca n't be , you know . All ladies are alike in those matters . That is universally allowed . "
116567	116585	116403	116403	he	195	" Tartar frightened you terribly , Mr. Donne . I hope you wo n't take any harm . "
116586	116609	116612	116613	Mr. Donne	195	" That I shall , no doubt . He gave me a turn I shall not soon forget . When I sor him "
116616	116628	116403	116403	he	195	" about to spring , I thought I should have fainted . "
116629	116645	116612	116613	Mr. Donne	195	" Perhaps you did faint in the bedroom ; you were a long time there . "
116646	116683	116403	116403	he	195	" No ; I bore up that I might hold the door fast . I was determined not to let any one enter . I thought I would keep a barrier between me and the enemy . "
116684	116696	116612	116613	Mr. Donne	195	" But what if your friend Mr. Malone had been worried ? "
116697	116763	116828	116828	Shirley	372	" Malone must take care of himself . Your man persuaded me to come out at last by saying the dog was chained up in his kennel . If I had not been assured of this , I would have remained all day in the chamber . But what is that ? I declare the man has told a falsehood ! The dog is there ! "
116819	116826	116890	116890	he	377	" There are other visitors coming , "
116909	116916	116890	116890	he	377	" What ! Tartar , Tartar ! "
116925	116939	117450	117450	he	195	" do n't you know us ? Good - morning , old boy ! "
117428	117432	117993	117993	Caroline	279	" Thank you ! "
117988	117991	117993	117993	Caroline	279	" And , "
117995	118014	118026	118026	he	223	" you will promise to come to my table , and to sit near me , Mr. Hall ? "
118015	118024	118052	118052	he	223	" I shall not fail , Deo volente , "
118029	118051	118052	118052	he	223	" I have occupied the place on her right hand at these monster tea - drinkings for the last six years , "
118060	118185	118196	118196	Caroline	279	" They made her a Sunday - school teacher when she was a little girl of twelve . She is not particularly self - confident by nature , as you may have observed ; and the first time she had to ' take a tray , ' as the phrase is , and make tea in public , there was some piteous trembling and flushing . I observed the speechless panic , the cups shaking in the little hand , and the overflowing teapot filled too full from the urn . I came to her aid , took a seat near her , managed the urn and the slop - basin , and in fact made the tea for her like any old woman . "
118186	118194	118052	118052	he	223	" I was very grateful to you , "
118198	118334	118347	118347	Caroline	279	" You were . You told me so with an earnest sincerity that repaid me well , inasmuch as it was not like the majority of little ladies of twelve , whom you may help and caress for ever without their evincing any quicker sense of the kindness done and meant than if they were made of wax and wood instead of flesh and nerves . - She kept close to me , Miss Keeldar , the rest of the evening , walking with me over the grounds where the children were playing ; she followed me into the vestry when all were summoned into church ; she would , I believe , have mounted with me to the pulpit , had I not taken the previous precaution of conducting her to the rectory pew . "
118335	118345	118052	118052	he	223	" And he has been my friend ever since , "
118349	118445	118052	118052	he	223	" And always sat at her table , near her tray , and handed the cups - that is the extent of my services . The next thing I do for her will be to marry her some day to some curate or mill - owner . - But mind , Caroline , I shall inquire about the bridegroom 's character ; and if he is not a gentleman likely to render happy the little girl who walked with me hand in hand over Nunnely Common , I will not officiate . So take care . "
118446	118473	118052	118052	he	223	" The caution is useless . I am not going to be married . I shall live single , like your sister Margaret , Mr. Hall . "
118474	118549	118560	118560	Caroline	279	" Very well . You might do worse . Margaret is not unhappy . She has her books for a pleasure , and her brother for a care , and is content . If ever you want a home , if the day should come when Briarfield rectory is yours no longer , come to Nunnely vicarage . Should the old maid and bachelor be still living , they will make you tenderly welcome . "
118550	118558	118567	118567	she	279	" There are your flowers . Now , "
118576	118646	118667	118667	she	279	" you do n't care for a bouquet , but you must give it to Margaret ; only - to be sentimental for once - keep that little forget - me - not , which is a wild flower I gathered from the grass ; and - to be still more sentimental - let me take two or three of the blue blossoms and put them in my souvenir . "
118678	118700	118724	118724	He	2935	" To be kept for the sake of the Rev. Cyril Hall , my friend . May - , 18 - . "
118731	118734	118740	118740	he	2935	" Caroline . "
118735	118738	118756	118756	he	2935	" Now , "
118744	118755	118776	118776	their	688	" I trust we are romantic enough . Miss Keeldar , "
118791	118885	118895	118895	Caroline	279	" I hope you are laughing at this trait of ' exaltation ' in the old gray - headed vicar ; but the fact is , I am so used to comply with the requests of this young friend of yours , I do n't know how to refuse her when she tells me to do anything . You would say it is not much in my way to traffic with flowers and forget - me - nots ; but , you see , when requested to be sentimental , I am obedient . "
118886	118893	118895	118895	Caroline	279	" He is naturally rather sentimental , "
118897	118910	119129	119129	he	2937	" Margaret told me so , and I know what pleases him . "
118911	119128	119188	119188	She	2938	" That you should be good and happy ? Yes ; that is one of my greatest pleasures . May God long preserve to you the blessings of peace and innocence ! By which phrase I mean comparative innocence ; for in His sight , I am well aware , none are pure . What to our human perceptions looks spotless as we fancy angels , is to Him but frailty , needing the blood of His Son to cleanse , and the strength of His Spirit to sustain . Let us each and all cherish humility - I , as you , my young friends ; and we may well do it when we look into our own hearts , and see there temptations , inconsistencies , propensities , even we blush to recognize . And it is not youth , nor good looks , nor grace , nor any gentle outside charm which makes either beauty or goodness in God 's eyes . - Young ladies , when your mirror or men 's tongues flatter you , remember that , in the sight of her Maker , Mary Ann Ainley - a woman whom neither glass nor lips have ever panegyrized - is fairer and better than either of you . She is indeed , "
119205	119205	119226	119226	he	195	"
119222	119225	119230	119230	his	195	" Ahem ! "
119240	119255	119261	119261	Shirley	372	" ahem ! Miss Keeldar , your attention an instant , if you please . "
119256	119259	119261	119261	Shirley	372	" Well , "
119264	119282	119295	119295	Donne	195	" what is it ? I listen . All of me is ear that is not eye . "
119283	119293	119295	119295	Donne	195	" I hope part of you is hand also , "
119305	119336	119298	119298	his	195	" and part purse . It is to the hand and purse I propose to appeal . I came here this morning with a view to beg of you - - "
119337	119351	119295	119295	Donne	195	" You should have gone to Mrs. Gill ; she is my almoner . "
119352	119407	119298	119298	his	195	" To beg of you a subscription to a school . I and Dr. Boultby intend to erect one in the hamlet of Ecclefigg , which is under our vicarage of Whinbury . The Baptists have got possession of it . They have a chapel there , and we want to dispute the ground . "
119408	119424	119295	119295	Donne	195	" But I have nothing to do with Ecclefigg . I possess no property there . "
119425	119440	119447	119447	Shirley	372	" What does that signify ? You 're a churchwoman , ai n't you ? "
119441	119445	119447	119447	Shirley	372	" Admirable creature ! "
119453	119467	119447	119447	Shirley	372	" Exquisite address ! Fine style ! What raptures he excites in me ! "
119471	119479	119295	119295	Donne	195	" I am a churchwoman , certainly . "
119480	119508	119447	119447	Shirley	372	" Then you ca n't refuse to contribute in this case . The population of Ecclefigg are a parcel of brutes ; we want to civilize them . "
119509	119517	119295	119295	Donne	195	" Who is to be the missionary ? "
119518	119523	119447	119447	Shirley	372	" Myself , probably . "
119524	119537	119295	119295	Donne	195	" You wo n't fail through lack of sympathy with your flock . "
119538	119564	119612	119612	Donne	195	" I hope not - I expect success ; but we must have money . There is the paper . Pray give a handsome sum . "
119623	119639	119651	119651	she	372	" and clamorously demanded more . Miss Keeldar flushed up with some indignation and more astonishment .
119640	119649	119612	119612	Donne	195	" At present I shall give no more , "
119653	119686	119699	119699	Donne	195	" Not give more ! Why , I expected you to head the list with a cool hundred . With your property , you should never put down a signature for less . "
119691	119696	119699	119699	Donne	195	" In the south , "
119701	119721	119751	119751	she	372	" a lady with a thousand a year would be ashamed to give five pounds for a public object . "
119745	119749	119751	119751	she	372	" Strange remarks ? "
119753	119765	119751	119751	she	372	" most inconsiderate ! Reproach in return for bounty is misplaced . "
119766	119776	119751	119751	she	372	" Bounty ! Do you call five pounds bounty ? "
119777	119848	119890	119890	he	195	" I do ; and bounty which , had I not given it to Dr. Boultby 's intended school , of the erection of which I approve , and in no sort to his curate , who seems ill - advised in his manner of applying for , or rather extorting , subscriptions - bounty , I repeat , which , but for this consideration , I should instantly reclaim . "
119883	119889	119890	119890	he	195	" Wretched place this Yorkshire , "
119894	119937	119967	119971	the infatuated and unconscious Donne	195	" I could never have formed an idea r of the country had I not seen it . And the people - rich and poor - what a set ! How corse and uncultivated ! They would be scouted in the south . "
119961	119965	119967	119971	the infatuated and unconscious Donne	195	" The rich , "
119973	119993	120029	120029	his	195	" are a parcel of misers , never living as persons with their incomes ought to live . You scarsley "
120035	120140	120152	120152	Shirley	372	" you scarsley ever see a fam'ly where a propa carriage or a reg'la butla is kep ; and as to the poor - just look at them when they come crowding about the church doors on the occasion of a marriage or a funeral , clattering in clogs ; the men in their shirt - sleeves and wool - combers ' aprons , the women in mob - caps and bed - gowns . They positively deserve that one should turn a mad cow in amongst them to rout their rabble - ranks . He - he ! what fun it would be ! "
120141	120150	120163	120163	she	372	" There ! you have reached the climax , "
120155	120162	120184	120184	she	372	" You have reached the climax , "
120173	120183	120184	120184	she	372	" You can not go beyond it , and , "
120189	120198	120233	120233	she	372	" you shall not , in my house . "
120228	120232	120233	120233	she	372	" Walk through , "
120237	120251	120284	120284	he	195	" and pretty quickly , and set foot on this pavement no more . "
120280	120283	120294	120294	he	195	" ton ; "
120344	120347	120360	120360	Shirley	372	" concatenation accordingly "
120349	120358	120360	120360	Shirley	372	" Rid me of you instantly - instantly ! "
120366	120377	120360	120360	Shirley	372	" Madam - a clergyman ! turn out a clergyman ! "
120378	120398	120492	120492	she	372	" Off ! Were you an archbishop you have proved yourself no gentleman , and must go . Quick ! "
120464	120482	120827	120827	he	216	" How dare the pompous priest abuse his flock ! How dare the lisping cockney revile Yorkshire ! "
120820	120826	120827	120827	he	216	" For you are aware , "
120831	121280	120827	120827	he	216	" that I now work Hollow 's Mill entirely on speculation . I sell nothing ; there is no market for my goods . I manufacture for a future day . I make myself ready to take advantage of the first opening that shall occur . Three months ago this was impossible to me ; I had exhausted both credit and capital . You well know who came to my rescue , from what hand I received the loan which saved me . It is on the strength of that loan I am enabled to continue the bold game which , a while since , I feared I should never play more . Total ruin I know will follow loss , and I am aware that gain is doubtful ; but I am quite cheerful . So long as I can be active , so long as I can strive , so long , in short , as my hands are not tied , it is impossible for me to be depressed . One year - nay , but six months - of the reign of the olive , and I am safe ; for , as you say , peace will give an impulse to commerce . In this you are right ; but as to the restored tranquillity of the neighbourhood , as to the permanent good effect of your charitable fund , I doubt . Eleemosynary relief never yet tranquillized the working - classes - it never made them grateful ; it is not in human nature that it should . I suppose , were all things ordered aright , they ought not to be in a position to need that humiliating relief ; and this they feel . We should feel it were we so placed . Besides , to whom should they be grateful ? To you , to the clergy perhaps , but not to us mill - owners . They hate us worse than ever . Then the disaffected here are in correspondence with the disaffected elsewhere . Nottingham is one of their headquarters , Manchester another , Birmingham a third . The subalterns receive orders from their chiefs ; they are in a good state of discipline ; no blow is struck without mature deliberation . In sultry weather you have seen the sky threaten thunder day by day , and yet night after night the clouds have cleared , and the sun has set quietly ; but the danger was not gone - it was only delayed . The long - threatening storm is sure to break at last . There is analogy between the moral and physical atmosphere . "
121281	121286	120827	120827	he	216	" Well , Mr. Moore "
121293	121321	120827	120827	he	216	" take care of yourself . If you think that I have ever done you any good , reward me by promising to take care of yourself . "
121322	121382	120827	120827	he	216	" I do ; I will take close and watchful care . I wish to live , not to die . The future opens like Eden before me ; and still , when I look deep into the shades of my paradise , I see a vision that I like better than seraph or cherub glide across remote vistas . "
121383	121392	120827	120827	he	216	" Do you ? Pray , what vision ? "
121393	121398	123830	123830	he	932	" I see - - "
123791	123794	124335	124335	Shirley	372	" Shabby doings "
124325	124333	124335	124335	Shirley	372	" He was not worth a scene ! "
124339	124439	124807	124807	she	372	" What a fool I was ! To revenge on poor Donne his silly spite at Yorkshire is something like crushing a gnat for attacking the hide of a rhinoceros . Had I been a gentleman , I believe I should have helped him off the premises by dint of physical force . I am glad now I only employed the moral weapon . But he must come near me no more . I do n't like him . He irritates me . There is not even amusement to be had out of him . Malone is better sport . "
124787	124806	125193	125193	her	279	" Peter is worth a scene , and shall have it , if he likes , one day , "
125198	125218	125362	125362	he	206	" What should she bring him ? He must not help himself - he must be served by her . "
125355	125361	125378	125378	He	206	" Ten minutes to two , "
125366	125377	125444	125444	he	206	" Time for all to fall into line . Come . "
125448	125457	125480	125480	he	206	" Grace Boultby and Mary Sykes lead out Whinbury .
125458	125467	125444	125444	he	206	" Margaret Hall and Mary Ann Ainley conduct Nunnely .
125468	125477	125480	125480	he	206	" Caroline Helstone and Shirley Keeldar head Briarfield . "
125485	125501	125822	125822	he	425	" Mr. Donne to Whinbury ; Mr. Sweeting to Nunnely ; Mr. Malone to Briarfield . "
125813	125821	125822	125822	he	425	" There is no battle in prospect , "
125825	125890	125901	125901	Shirley	372	" our country does not want us to fight for it . No foe or tyrant is questioning or threatening our liberty . There is nothing to be done . We are only taking a walk . Keep your hand on the reins , captain , and slack the fire of that spirit . It is not wanted , the more 's the pity . "
125891	125899	125907	125907	she	279	" Take your own advice , doctor , "
125910	126099	126107	126107	Caroline	279	" I 'll borrow of imagination what reality will not give me . We are not soldiers - bloodshed is not my desire - or if we are , we are soldiers of the Cross . Time has rolled back some hundreds of years , and we are bound on a pilgrimage to Palestine . But no ; that is too visionary . I need a sterner dream . We are Lowlanders of Scotland , following a Covenanting captain up into the hills to hold a meeting out of the reach of persecuting troopers . We know that battle may follow prayer ; and as we believe that in the worst issue of battle heaven must be our reward , we are ready and willing to redden the peat - moss with our blood . That music stirs my soul ; it wakens all my life ; it makes my heart beat - not with its temperate daily pulse , but with a new , thrilling vigour . I almost long for danger - for a faith , a land , or at least a lover to defend . "
126100	126105	126107	126107	Caroline	279	" Look , Shirley ! "
126109	126134	126144	126144	she	372	" What is that red speck above Stilbro ' Brow ? You have keener sight than I. Just turn your eagle eye to it . "
126139	126143	126167	126167	she	372	" I see , "
126151	126166	126167	126167	she	372	" there is a line of red . They are soldiers - cavalry soldiers , "
126171	126215	126238	126239	Mr. Helstone	206	" They ride fast . There are six of them . They will pass us . No ; they have turned off to the right . They saw our procession , and avoid it by making a circuit . Where are they going ? "
126216	126225	126167	126167	she	372	" Perhaps they are only exercising their horses . "
126226	126237	126262	126262	he	206	" Perhaps so . We see them no more now . "
126243	126260	126355	126355	his	223	" We shall pass through Royd Lane , to reach Nunnely Common by a short cut , "
126341	126347	126408	126408	Shirley	372	" What is the matter ? "
126400	126406	126408	126408	Shirley	372	" Is it our double ? "
126410	126422	126444	126444	Caroline	279	" our manifold wraith ? Here is a card turned up . "
126423	126442	126457	126458	the curates	688	" If you wanted a battle , you are likely to get one - at least of looks , "
126448	126455	126457	126458	the curates	688	" They shall not pass us ! "
126461	126468	126475	126475	Helstone	279	" we 'll not give way ! "
126469	126473	126475	126475	Helstone	279	" Give way ! "
126481	126542	126457	126458	the curates	688	" who talks of giving way ? You , boys , mind what you are about . The ladies , I know , will be firm . I can trust them . There is not a churchwoman here but will stand her ground against these folks , for the honour of the Establishment . - What does Miss Keeldar say ? "
126543	126550	126475	126475	Helstone	279	" She asks what is it . "
126551	126589	126596	126596	Shirley	372	" The Dissenting and Methodist schools , the Baptists , Independents , and Wesleyans , joined in unholy alliance , and turning purposely into this lane with the intention of obstructing our march and driving us back . "
126590	126594	126596	126596	Shirley	372	" Bad manners ! "
126598	126614	126623	126624	Mr. Hall	223	" and I hate bad manners . Of course , they must have a lesson . "
126615	126621	126623	126624	Mr. Hall	223	" A lesson in politeness , "
126632	126639	126749	126749	He	425	" not an example of rudeness . "
126754	126759	126806	126806	Helstone	425	" Rule , Britannia ! "
126798	126804	126806	126806	Helstone	425	" Now , follow me ! "
126808	126846	127890	127890	she	372	" not at a run , but at a firm , smart pace . Be steady , every child and woman of you . Keep together . Hold on by each other 's skirts , if necessary . "
127907	127976	128142	128142	her	279	" I expect Mr. Moore . I saw him last night , and I made him promise to come with his sister , and to sit at our table . He wo n't fail me , I feel certain ; but I apprehend his coming too late , and being separated from us . Here is a fresh batch arriving ; every place will be taken . Provoking ! "
128135	128141	128470	128470	himself	216	" I expect Mr. Moore , "
128439	128456	128610	128610	she	279	" Wait till after tea , Lina , and then I 'll bring her to you . "
128619	128623	128719	128719	Shirley	372	" insupportable tardiness . "
128705	128717	128719	128719	Shirley	372	" You may sit where you can now , Mr. Moore , "
128724	128780	129151	129151	his	430	" You see there is not an inch of room for you here ; but I discern plenty of space at Mrs. Boultby 's table , between Miss Armitage and Miss Birtwhistle . Go ! John Sykes will be your vis - a - vis , and you will sit with your back towards us . "
129167	129170	129393	129393	she	372	" give way "
129381	129392	129393	129393	she	372	" Would n't have offended either gentleman for the world , "
129396	129505	129525	129525	Moore	230	" I have always been accustomed to treat both with the most respectful consideration , and there , owing to you , how they have been used ! I shall not be happy till I have made it up . I never am happy till I am friends with my neighbours . So to - morrow I must make a pilgrimage to Royd corn - mill , soothe the miller , and praise the grain ; and next day I must call at De Walden - where I hate to go - and carry in my reticule half an oatcake to give to Mr. Sam 's favourite pointers . "
129506	129523	129935	129935	she	239	" You know the surest path to the heart of each swain , I doubt not , "
129926	129934	130560	130560	she	372	" You are a very great stranger , "
130548	130559	130560	130560	she	372	" Let us go to the top of the fields , "
130563	130574	130535	130535	Shirley	372	" I know you do n't like crowds , Caroline . "
130575	130620	130560	130560	she	372	" But it will be depriving you of a pleasure , Shirley , to take you from all these fine people , who court your society so assiduously , and to whom you can , without art or effort , make yourself so pleasant . "
130621	130747	130833	130833	Shirley	372	" Not quite without effort ; I am already tired of the exertion . It is but insipid , barren work , talking and laughing with the good gentlefolks of Briarfield . I have been looking out for your white dress for the last ten minutes . I like to watch those I love in a crowd , and to compare them with others . I have thus compared you . You resemble none of the rest , Lina . There are some prettier faces than yours here . You are not a model beauty like Harriet Sykes , for instance - beside her your person appears almost insignificant - but you look agreeable , you look reflective , you look what I call interesting . "
130748	130757	130560	130560	she	372	" Hush , Shirley ! you flatter me . "
130758	130769	130833	130833	Shirley	372	" I do n't wonder that your scholars like you . "
130770	130780	130560	130560	she	372	" Nonsense , Shirley ! Talk of something else . "
130781	130802	130813	130813	she	279	" We will talk of Moore , then , and we will watch him . I see him even now . "
130803	130806	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" Where ? "
130889	130894	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" There is Moore , "
130921	130970	130979	130979	Caroline	279	" There - can you miss the tall stature and straight port ? He looks amidst the set that surround him like Eliab amongst humbler shepherds - like Saul in a war - council ; and a war - council it is , if I am not mistaken . "
130971	130977	130979	130979	Caroline	279	" Why so , Shirley ? "
130992	131013	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" Robert is just now speaking to my uncle , and they are shaking hands . They are then reconciled . "
131014	131081	131103	131103	she	372	" Reconciled not without good reason , depend on it - making common cause against some common foe . And why , think you , are Messrs. Wynne and Sykes , and Armitage and Ramsden , gathered in such a close circle round them ? And why is Malone beckoned to join them ? Where he is summoned , be sure a strong arm is needed . "
131095	131102	131103	131103	she	372	" They wo n't trust me , "
131106	131119	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" That is always the way when it comes to the point . "
131120	131124	131103	131103	she	372	" What about ? "
131125	131172	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" Can not you feel ? There is some mystery afloat ; some event is expected ; some preparation is to be made , I am certain . I saw it all in Mr. Moore 's manner this evening . He was excited , yet hard . "
131173	131180	131103	131103	she	372	" Hard to you , Shirley ? "
131181	131220	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" Yes , to me . He often is hard to me . We seldom converse tete - a - tete but I am made to feel that the basis of his character is not of eider down . "
131221	131231	131103	131103	she	372	" Yet he seemed to talk to you softly . "
131232	131257	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" Did he not ? Very gentle tones and quiet manner . Yet the man is peremptory and secret : his secrecy vexes me . "
131258	131265	131103	131103	she	372	" Yes , Robert is secret . "
131266	131321	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" Which he has scarcely a right to be with me , especially as he commenced by giving me his confidence . Having done nothing to forfeit that confidence , it ought not to be withdrawn ; but I suppose I am not considered iron - souled enough to be trusted in a crisis . "
131322	131333	131103	131103	she	372	" He fears , probably , to occasion you uneasiness . "
131334	131389	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" An unnecessary precaution . I am of elastic materials , not soon crushed . He ought to know that . But the man is proud . He has his faults , say what you will , Lina . Observe how engaged that group appear . They do not know we are watching them . "
131390	131410	131103	131103	she	372	" If we keep on the alert , Shirley , we shall perhaps find the clue to their secret . "
131411	131456	130896	130896	Shirley	372	" There will be some unusual movements ere long - perhaps to - morrow , possibly to - night . But my eyes and ears are wide open . Mr. Moore , you shall be under surveillance . Be you vigilant also , Lina . "
131457	131481	131491	131491	Shirley	372	" I will . Robert is going ; I saw him turn . I believe he noticed us . They are shaking hands . "
131482	131489	131491	131491	Shirley	372	" Shaking hands , with emphasis , "
131493	131505	131534	131534	Caroline	279	" as if they were ratifying some solemn league and covenant . "
131521	131532	131583	131583	Shirley	372	" And he has not bid us good - bye , "
131573	131581	131583	131583	Shirley	372	" Oh , that is soon remedied ! "
131585	131596	131669	131670	Miss Keeldar	372	" we 'll make him bid us good - bye . "
131597	131608	131669	131670	Miss Keeldar	372	" Make him ! That is not the same thing , "
131613	131621	131669	131670	Miss Keeldar	372	" It shall be the same thing . "
131622	131634	131669	131670	Miss Keeldar	372	" But he is gone ; you ca n't overtake him . "
131635	131652	131669	131670	Miss Keeldar	372	" I know a shorter way than that he has taken . We will intercept him . "
131653	131664	131911	131911	Caroline	279	" But , Shirley , I would rather not go . "
131901	131909	131986	131986	she	279	" I told you not to come , "
131975	131985	131963	131963	She	279	" You omitted to bid us good - bye , "
131989	132039	131986	131986	she	279	" Omitted to bid you good - bye ! Where did you come from ? Are you fairies ? I left two like you , one in purple and one in white , standing at the top of a bank , four fields off , but a minute ago . "
132040	132091	132121	132121	he	216	" You left us there and find us here . We have been watching you , and shall watch you still . You must be questioned one day , but not now . At present all you have to do is to say good - night , and then pass . "
132104	132119	132141	132141	Shirley	372	" Days of fete have their privileges , and so have days of hazard , "
132124	132139	132203	132203	He	216	" Come , do n't moralize . Say good - night , and pass , "
132143	132156	132184	132184	He	216	" Must I say good - night to you , Miss Keeldar ? "
132157	132183	132254	132254	his	216	" Yes , and to Caroline likewise . It is nothing new , I hope . You have bid us both good - night before . "
132275	132293	132254	132254	his	216	" Your debtor bids you good - night ! May you rest safely and serenely till morning . "
132294	132345	132254	132254	his	216	" And you , Mr. Moore - what are you going to do ? What have you been saying to Mr. Helstone , with whom I saw you shake hands ? Why did all those gentlemen gather round you ? Put away reserve for once . Be frank with me . "
132346	132373	132380	132380	Shirley	372	" Who can resist you ? I will be frank . To - morrow , if there is anything to relate , you shall hear it . "
132374	132378	132380	132380	Shirley	372	" Just now , "
132382	132387	132254	132254	his	216	" do n't procrastinate . "
132388	132422	132380	132380	Shirley	372	" But I could only tell half a tale . And my time is limited ; I have not a moment to spare . Hereafter I will make amends for delay by candour . "
132423	132430	132254	132254	his	216	" But are you going home ? "
132431	132434	132380	132380	Shirley	372	" Yes . "
132435	132446	132254	132254	his	216	" Not to leave it any more to - night ? "
132447	132460	132528	132528	he	3321	" Certainly not . At present , farewell to both of you . "
132530	132533	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" Farewell , "
132539	132546	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" There ! it is over , "
132554	132579	132528	132528	he	3321	" We have made him bid us good - night , and yet not lost ground in his esteem , I think , Cary . "
132580	132585	132602	132603	Miss Keeldar	372	" I hope not , "
132591	132600	132602	132603	Miss Keeldar	372	" I consider you very timid and undemonstrative , "
132605	132639	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" Why did you not give Moore your hand when he offered you his ? He is your cousin ; you like him . Are you ashamed to let him perceive your affection ? "
132640	132659	132602	132603	Miss Keeldar	372	" He perceives all of it that interests him . No need to make a display of feeling . "
132660	132685	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" You are laconic ; you would be stoical if you could . Is love , in your eyes , a crime , Caroline ? "
132686	132715	132721	132721	Shirley	372	" Love a crime ! No , Shirley ; love is a divine virtue . But why drag that word into the conversation ? It is singularly irrelevant . "
132716	132719	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" Good ! "
132737	132844	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" Obtrusiveness is a crime , forwardness is a crime , and both disgust ; but love ! no purest angel need blush to love . And when I see or hear either man or woman couple shame with love , I know their minds are coarse , their associations debased . Many who think themselves refined ladies and gentlemen , and on whose lips the word ' vulgarity ' is for ever hovering , can not mention ' love ' without betraying their own innate and imbecile degradation . It is a low feeling in their estimation , connected only with low ideas for them . "
132845	132857	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" You describe three - fourths of the world , Caroline . "
132858	132885	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" They are cold - they are cowardly - they are stupid on the subject , Shirley ! They never loved - they never were loved ! "
132886	132911	132548	132548	Shirley	372	" Thou art right , Lina . And in their dense ignorance they blaspheme living fire , seraph - brought from a divine altar . "
132912	132922	133066	133066	Caroline	279	" They confound it with sparks mounting from Tophet . "
133056	133064	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" How pleasant and calm it is ! "
133068	133079	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" And how hot it will be in the church ! "
133083	133116	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" And what a dreary long speech Dr. Boultby will make ! And how the curates will hammer over their prepared orations ! For my part , I would rather not enter . "
133117	133130	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" But my uncle will be angry if he observes our absence . "
133131	133312	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" I will bear the brunt of his wrath ; he will not devour me . I shall be sorry to miss his pungent speech . I know it will be all sense for the church , and all causticity for schism . He 'll not forget the battle of Royd Lane . I shall be sorry also to deprive you of Mr. Hall 's sincere friendly homily , with all its racy Yorkshireisms ; but here I must stay . The gray church and grayer tombs look divine with this crimson gleam on them . Nature is now at her evening prayers ; she is kneeling before those red hills . I see her prostrate on the great steps of her altar , praying for a fair night for mariners at sea , for travellers in deserts , for lambs on moors , and unfledged birds in woods . Caroline , I see her , and I will tell you what she is like . She is like what Eve was when she and Adam stood alone on earth . "
133313	133324	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" And that is not Milton 's Eve , Shirley . "
133325	133472	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" Milton 's Eve ! Milton 's Eve ! I repeat . No , by the pure Mother of God , she is not ! Cary , we are alone ; we may speak what we think . Milton was great ; but was he good ? His brain was right ; how was his heart ? He saw heaven ; he looked down on hell . He saw Satan , and Sin his daughter , and Death their horrible offspring . Angels serried before him their battalions ; the long lines of adamantine shields flashed back on his blind eyeballs the unutterable splendour of heaven . Devils gathered their legions in his sight ; their dim , discrowned , and tarnished armies passed rank and file before him . Milton tried to see the first woman ; but , Cary , he saw her not . "
133473	133483	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" You are bold to say so , Shirley . "
133484	133590	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" Not more bold than faithful . It was his cook that he saw ; or it was Mrs. Gill , as I have seen her , making custards , in the heat of summer , in the cool dairy , with rose - trees and nasturtiums about the latticed window , preparing a cold collation for the rectors - preserves and ' dulcet creams ; ' puzzled ' what choice to choose for delicacy best ; what order so contrived as not to mix tastes , not well - joined , inelegant , but bring taste after taste , upheld with kindliest change . ' "
133591	133599	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" All very well too , Shirley . "
133600	133638	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" I would beg to remind him that the first men of the earth were Titans , and that Eve was their mother ; from her sprang Saturn , Hyperion , Oceanus ; she bore Prometheus - - "
133639	133650	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" Pagan that you are ! what does that signify ? "
133651	133785	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" I say , there were giants on the earth in those days - giants that strove to scale heaven . The first woman 's breast that heaved with life on this world yielded the daring which could contend with Omnipotence , the strength which could bear a thousand years of bondage , the vitality which could feed that vulture death through uncounted ages , the unexhausted life and uncorrupted excellence , sisters to immortality , which , after millenniums of crimes , struggles , and woes , could conceive and bring forth a Messiah . The first woman was heaven - born . Vast was the heart whence gushed the well - spring of the blood of nations , and grand the undegenerate head where rested the consort - crown of creation . "
133786	133837	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" She coveted an apple , and was cheated by a snake ; but you have got such a hash of Scripture and mythology into your head that there is no making any sense of you . You have not yet told me what you saw kneeling on those hills . "
133838	134021	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" I saw - I now see - a woman - Titan . Her robe of blue air spreads to the outskirts of the heath , where yonder flock is grazing ; a veil white as an avalanche sweeps from her head to her feet , and arabesques of lightning flame on its borders . Under her breast I see her zone , purple like that horizon ; through its blush shines the star of evening . Her steady eyes I can not picture . They are clear , they are deep as lakes , they are lifted and full of worship , they tremble with the softness of love and the lustre of prayer . Her forehead has the expanse of a cloud , and is paler than the early moon , risen long before dark gathers . She reclines her bosom on the ridge of Stilbro ' Moor ; her mighty hands are joined beneath it . So kneeling , face to face she speaks with God . That Eve is Jehovah 's daughter , as Adam was His son . "
134022	134041	133081	133081	Shirley	372	" She is very vague and visionary . Come , Shirley , we ought to go into church . "
134042	134132	134153	134154	Miss Keeldar	372	" Caroline , I will not ; I will stay out here with my mother Eve , in these days called Nature . I love her - undying , mighty being ! Heaven may have faded from her brow when she fell in paradise , but all that is glorious on earth shines there still . She is taking me to her bosom , and showing me her heart . Hush , Caroline ! You will see her and feel as I do , if we are both silent . "
134133	134152	134219	134219	Shirley	372	" I will humour your whim ; but you will begin talking again ere ten minutes are over . "
134224	134227	134254	134254	she	279	" mother . "
134270	134297	134448	134448	Shirley	372	" Oh that the day would come when she would remember her child ! Oh that I might know her , and knowing , love her ! "
134386	134434	134511	134511	Shirley	372	" Caroline , my child , I have a home for you ; you shall live with me . All the love you have needed , and not tasted , from infancy , I have saved for you carefully . Come ; it shall cherish you now . "
134501	134509	134511	134511	Shirley	372	" The same we saw this afternoon , "
134513	134561	134712	134712	Shirley	372	" They have been halting somewhere till now . They wish to be as little noticed as possible , and are seeking their rendezvous at this quiet hour , while the people are at church . Did I not say we should see unusual things ere long ? "
134703	134710	134807	134807	he	6867	" Good - evening , William , "
134797	134806	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" You are not going into the church ? "
135109	135121	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" Who was speaking , William , when you came out ? "
135125	135142	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" A gentleman ye set a deal of store on , Miss Shirley - Mr. Donne . "
135143	135161	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" You look knowing , William . How did you find out my regard for Mr. Donne ? "
135162	135194	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" Ay , Miss Shirley , there 's a gleg light i ' your een sometimes which betrays you . You look raight down scornful sometimes when Mr. Donne is by . "
135195	135204	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" Do you like him yourself , William ? "
135205	135277	135291	135291	Caroline	279	" Me ? I 'm stalled o ' t ' curates , and so is t ' wife . They 've no manners . They talk to poor folk fair as if they thought they were beneath them . They 're allus magnifying their office . It is a pity but their office could magnify them ; but it does nought o ' t ' soart . I fair hate pride . "
135278	135289	135291	135291	Caroline	279	" But you are proud in your own way yourself , "
135293	135384	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" You are what you call house - proud : you like to have everything handsome about you . Sometimes you look as if you were almost too proud to take your wages . When you were out of work , you were too proud to get anything on credit . But for your children , I believe you would rather have starved than gone to the shops without money ; and when I wanted to give you something , what a difficulty I had in making you take it ! "
135385	135581	135291	135291	Caroline	279	" It is partly true , Miss Caroline . Ony day I 'd rather give than take , especially from sich as ye . Look at t ' difference between us . Ye're a little , young , slender lass , and I 'm a great strong man ; I 'm rather more nor twice your age . It is not my part , then , I think , to tak fro ' ye - to be under obligations as they say to ye . And that day ye came to our house , and called me to t ' door , and offered me five shillings , which I doubt ye could ill spare - for ye've no fortin ' , I know - that day I war fair a rebel , a radical , an insurrectionist ; and ye made me so . I thought it shameful that , willing and able as I was to work , I suld be i ' such a condition that a young cratur about the age o ' my own eldest lass suld think it needful to come and offer me her bit o ' brass . "
135582	135593	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" I suppose you were angry with me , William ? "
135594	135718	135291	135291	Caroline	279	" I almost was , in a way . But I forgave ye varry soon . Ye meant well . Ay , I am proud , and so are ye ; but your pride and mine is t ' raight mak - what we call i ' Yorkshire clean pride - such as Mr. Malone and Mr. Donne knows nought about . Theirs is mucky pride . Now , I shall teach my lasses to be as proud as Miss Shirley there , and my lads to be as proud as myseln ; but I dare ony o ' 'em to be like t ' curates . I 'd lick little Michael if I seed him show any signs o ' that feeling . "
135719	135727	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" What is the difference , William ? "
135728	135813	135291	135291	Caroline	279	" Ye know t ' difference weel enow , but ye want me to get a gate o ' talking . Mr. Malone and Mr. Donne is almost too proud to do aught for theirseln ; we are almost too proud to let anybody do aught for us . T ' curates can hardly bide to speak a civil word to them they think beneath them ; we can hardly bide to tak an uncivil word fro ' them that thinks themseln aboon us . "
135814	135840	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" Now , William , be humble enough to tell me truly how you are getting on in the world . Are you well off ? "
135841	135964	135980	135981	Miss Keeldar	372	" Miss Shirley , I am varry well off . Since I got into t ' gardening line , wi ' Mr. Yorke 's help , and since Mr. Hall another o ' t ' raight sort helped my wife to set up a bit of a shop , I 've nought to complain of . My family has plenty to eat and plenty to wear . My pride makes me find means to have an odd pound now and then against rainy days ; for I think I 'd die afore I 'd come to t ' parish ; and me and mine is content . But t ' neighbours is poor yet . I see a great deal of distress . "
135965	135978	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" And , consequently , there is still discontent , I suppose ? "
135983	136020	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" Consequently - ye say right - consequently . In course , starving folk can not be satisfied or settled folk . The country 's not in a safe condition - I 'll say so mich ! "
136021	136037	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" But what can be done ? What more can I do , for instance ? "
136038	136083	136092	136092	Caroline	279	" Do ? Ye can do not mich , poor young lass ! Ye've gi'en your brass ; ye've done well . If ye could transport your tenant , Mr. Moore , to Botany Bay , ye'd happen do better . Folks hate him . "
136084	136090	136092	136092	Caroline	279	" William , for shame ! "
136095	136137	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" If folks do hate him , it is to their disgrace , not his . Mr. Moore himself hates nobody . He only wants to do his duty , and maintain his rights . You are wrong to talk so . "
136138	136157	136163	136163	Shirley	372	" I talk as I think . He has a cold , unfeeling heart , yond ' Moore . "
136158	136161	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" But , "
136188	136188	135123	135123	Shirley	372	"
136189	136472	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" They 'd have less . I know that , and they know that ; and there is many an honest lad driven desperate by the certainty that whichever way he turns he can not better himself ; and there is dishonest men plenty to guide them to the devil , scoundrels that reckons to be the ' people 's friends , ' and that knows nought about the people , and is as insincere as Lucifer . I 've lived aboon forty year in the world , and I believe that ' the people ' will never have any true friends but theirseln and them two or three good folk i ' different stations that is friends to all the world . Human natur ' , taking it i ' th ' lump , is nought but selfishness . It is but excessive few , it is but just an exception here and there , now and then , sich as ye two young uns and me , that , being in a different sphere , can understand t ' one t ' other , and be friends wi'out slavishness o ' one hand or pride o ' t ' other . Them that reckons to be friends to a lower class than their own fro ' political motives is never to be trusted ; they always try to make their inferiors tools . For my own part , I will neither be patronized nor misled for no man 's pleasure . I 've had overtures made to me lately that I saw were treacherous , and I flung 'em back i ' the faces o ' them that offered 'em . "
136473	136482	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" You wo n't tell us what overtures ? "
136483	136508	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" I will not . It would do no good . It would mak no difference . Them they concerned can look after theirseln . "
136509	136517	136553	136553	William	295	" Ay , we'se look after werseln , "
136543	136551	135123	135123	Shirley	372	" I 'll warrant ye , Joe , "
136557	136565	136577	136577	Joe	218	" And I 'll warrant my maister , "
136571	136575	136577	136577	Joe	218	" Young ladies , "
136584	136593	136602	136602	Shirley	372	" ye'd better go into th ' house . "
136594	136600	136858	136858	he	218	" I wonder what for ? "
136684	136698	136858	136858	he	218	" Because there is nought agate that fits women to be consarned in . "
136699	136719	136858	136858	he	218	" Indeed ! There is prayer and preaching agate in that church . Are we not concerned in that ? "
136720	136762	136858	136858	he	218	" Ye have been present neither at the prayer nor preaching , ma'am , if I have observed aright . What I alluded to was politics . William Farren here was touching on that subject , if I 'm not mista'en . "
136763	136793	136858	136858	he	218	" Well , what then ? Politics are our habitual study , Joe . Do you know I see a newspaper every day , and two of a Sunday ? "
136794	136820	136858	136858	he	218	" I should think you 'll read the marriages , probably , miss , and the murders , and the accidents , and sich like ? "
136821	136853	136884	136885	Miss Keeldar	372	" I read the leading articles , Joe , and the foreign intelligence , and I look over the market prices . In short , I read just what gentlemen read . "
136879	136882	136884	136885	Miss Keeldar	372	" Joe , "
136887	136914	136933	136933	Joe	218	" I never yet could ascertain properly whether you are a Whig or a Tory . Pray , which party has the honour of your alliance ? "
136915	136931	136933	136933	Joe	218	" It is rayther difficult to explain where you are sure not to be understood , "
136938	137021	137031	137031	Shirley	372	" but as to being a Tory , I 'd as soon be an old woman , or a young one , which is a more flimsier article still . It is the Tories that carries on the war and ruins trade ; and if I be of any party - though political parties is all nonsense - I 'm of that which is most favourable to peace , and , by consequence , to the mercantile interests of this here land . "
137022	137029	137051	137051	he	218	" So am I , Joe , "
137065	137146	137160	137160	Joe	218	" partly , at least . I have rather a leaning to the agricultural interest , too ; as good reason is , seeing that I do n't desire England to be under the feet of France , and that if a share of my income comes from Hollow 's Mill , a larger share comes from the landed estate around it . It would not do to take any measures injurious to the farmers , Joe , I think ? "
137147	137158	137160	137160	Joe	218	" The dews at this hour is unwholesome for females , "
137162	137211	137247	137247	she	3384	" If you make that remark out of interest in me , I have merely to assure you that I am impervious to cold . I should not mind taking my turn to watch the mill one of these summer nights , armed with your musket , Joe . "
137236	137246	137247	137247	she	3384	" But - to go back to my sheep , "
137250	137324	137051	137051	he	218	" clothier and mill - owner as I am , besides farmer , I can not get out of my head a certain idea that we manufacturers and persons of business are sometimes a little - a very little - selfish and short - sighted in our views , and rather too regardless of human suffering , rather heartless in our pursuit of gain . Do n't you agree with me , Joe ? "
137325	137337	137247	137247	she	3384	" I can not argue where I can not be comprehended , "
137343	137367	137247	137247	she	3384	" Man of mystery ! Your master will argue with me sometimes , Joe . He is not so stiff as you are . "
137368	137379	137247	137247	she	3384	" Maybe not . We 've all our own ways . "
137380	137399	137247	137247	she	3384	" Joe , do you seriously think all the wisdom in the world is lodged in male skulls ? "
137400	137436	137247	137247	she	3384	" I think that women are a kittle and a froward generation ; and I 've a great respect for the doctrines delivered in the second chapter of St. Paul 's first Epistle to Timothy . "
137437	137443	137247	137247	she	3384	" What doctrines , Joe ? "
137444	137489	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" ' Let the woman learn in silence , with all subjection . I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence . For Adam was first formed , then Eve . ' "
137490	137500	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" What has that to do with the business ? "
137504	137529	137535	137536	Joe Scott	218	" That smacks of rights of primogeniture . I 'll bring it up to Mr. Yorke the first time he inveighs against those rights . "
137530	137533	137535	137536	Joe Scott	218	" And , "
137538	137554	137569	137570	Miss Keeldar	372	" Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression . "
137555	137567	137569	137570	Miss Keeldar	372	" More shame to Adam to sin with his eyes open ! "
137572	137596	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" To confess the honest truth , Joe , I never was easy in my mind concerning that chapter . It puzzles me . "
137597	137611	137624	137624	Caroline	279	" It is very plain , miss . He that runs may read . "
137612	137622	137624	137624	Caroline	279	" He may read it in his own fashion , "
137636	137650	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" You allow the right of private judgment , I suppose , Joe ? "
137651	137672	137624	137624	Caroline	279	" My certy , that I do ! I allow and claim it for every line of the holy Book . "
137673	137683	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" Women may exercise it as well as men ? "
137684	137708	137717	137717	Shirley	372	" Nay . Women is to take their husbands ' opinion , both in politics and religion . It 's wholesomest for them . "
137709	137714	137732	137734	the stubborn overlooker	3385	" Oh ! oh ! "
137721	137730	137755	137756	Miss Keeldar	372	" To be sure ; no doubt on't , "
137736	137753	137755	137756	Miss Keeldar	372	" Consider yourself groaned down , and cried shame over , for such a stupid observation , "
137758	137795	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" You might as well say men are to take the opinions of their priests without examination . Of what value would a religion so adopted be ? It would be mere blind , besotted superstition . "
137796	137816	137755	137756	Miss Keeldar	372	" And what is your reading , Miss Helstone , o ' these words o ' St. Paul 's ? "
137817	137958	137502	137502	Shirley	372	" Hem ! I - I account for them in this way . He wrote that chapter for a particular congregation of Christians , under peculiar circumstances ; and besides , I dare say , if I could read the original Greek , I should find that many of the words have been wrongly translated , perhaps misapprehended altogether . It would be possible , I doubt not , with a little ingenuity , to give the passage quite a contrary turn - to make it say , ' Let the woman speak out whenever she sees fit to make an objection . ' ' It is permitted to a woman to teach and to exercise authority as much as may be . Man , meantime , can not do better than hold his peace ; ' and so on . "
137959	137966	137755	137756	Miss Keeldar	372	" That willn't wash , miss . "
137967	138007	138020	138020	Shirley	372	" I dare say it will . My notions are dyed in faster colours than yours , Joe . Mr. Scott , you are a thoroughly dogmatical person , and always were . I like William better than you . "
138008	138018	138020	138020	Shirley	372	" Joe is well enough in his own house , "
138022	138055	137755	137756	Miss Keeldar	372	" I have seen him as quiet as a lamb at home . There is not a better nor a kinder husband in Briarfield . He does not dogmatize to his wife . "
138056	138224	138020	138020	Shirley	372	" My wife is a hard - working , plain woman ; time and trouble has ta'en all the conceit out of her . But that is not the case with you , young misses . And then you reckon to have so much knowledge ; and i ' my thoughts it 's only superficial sort o ' vanities you 're acquainted with . I can tell - happen a year sin ' - one day Miss Caroline coming into our counting - house when I war packing up summat behind t ' great desk , and she did n't see me , and she brought a slate wi ' a sum on it to t ' maister . It war only a bit of a sum in practice , that our Harry would have settled i ' two minutes . She could n't do it . Mr. Moore had to show her how . And when he did show her , she could n't understand him . "
138225	138230	137755	137756	Miss Keeldar	372	" Nonsense , Joe ! "
138231	138380	138020	138020	Shirley	372	" Nay , it 's no nonsense . And Miss Shirley there reckons to hearken to t ' maister when he 's talking ower trade , so attentive like , as if she followed him word for word , and all war as clear as a lady 's looking - glass to her een ; and all t ' while she 's peeping and peeping out o ' t ' window to see if t ' mare stands quiet ; and then looking at a bit of a splash on her riding - skirt ; and then glancing glegly round at wer counting - house cobwebs and dust , and thinking what mucky folk we are , and what a grand ride she 'll have just i ' now ower Nunnely Common . She hears no more o ' Mr. Moore 's talk nor if he spake Hebrew . "
138381	138454	138500	138500	she	372	" Joe , you are a real slanderer . I would give you your answer , only the people are coming out of church . We must leave you . Man of prejudice , good - bye . - William , good - bye . - Children , come up to Fieldhead to - morrow , and you shall choose what you like best out of Mrs. Gill 's store - room . "
138480	138494	138500	138500	she	372	" There will be just light enough to show me the way home , "
138513	138527	138020	138020	Shirley	372	" You must not go alone , Shirley ; Fanny shall accompany you . "
138528	138580	138500	138500	she	372	" That she shall not . Of what need I be afraid in my own parish ? I would walk from Fieldhead to the church any fine midsummer night , three hours later than this , for the mere pleasure of seeing the stars and the chance of meeting a fairy . "
138581	138592	138020	138020	Shirley	372	" But just wait till the crowd is cleared away . "
138593	138657	138737	138737	he	206	" Agreed . There are the five Misses Armitage streaming by . Here comes Mrs. Sykes 's phaeton , Mr. Wynne 's close carriage , Mrs. Birtwhistle 's car . I do n't wish to go through the ceremony of bidding them all good - bye , so we will step into the garden and take shelter amongst the laburnums for an instant . "
138729	138736	138737	138737	he	206	" Oh , I want you ! "
138740	138755	138798	138798	he	932	" I was afraid you were already gone . - Caroline , come here . "
138786	138797	138798	138798	he	932	" I shall not sleep at home to - night , "
138801	138862	138868	138868	Shirley	372	" I have just met with an old friend , and promised to accompany him . I shall return probably about noon to - morrow . Thomas , the clerk , is engaged , and I can not get him to sleep in the house , as I usually do when I am absent for a night . Now - - "
138863	138866	138868	138868	Shirley	372	" Now , "
138870	138909	138798	138798	he	932	" you want me as a gentleman - the first gentleman in Briarfield , in short - to supply your place , be master of the rectory and guardian of your niece and maids while you are away ? "
138910	138949	138868	138868	Shirley	372	" Exactly , captain . I thought the post would suit you . Will you favour Caroline so far as to be her guest for one night ? Will you stay here instead of going back to Fieldhead ? "
138950	138963	138798	138798	he	932	" And what will Mrs. Pryor do ? she expects me home . "
138964	139003	139018	139018	Shirley	372	" I will send her word . Come , make up your mind to stay . It grows late ; the dew falls heavily . You and Caroline will enjoy each other 's society , I doubt not . "
139004	139016	139018	139018	Shirley	372	" I promise you , then , to stay with Caroline , "
139020	139055	138798	138798	he	932	" As you say , we shall enjoy each other 's society . We will not be separated to - night . Now , rejoin your old friend , and fear nothing for us . "
139056	139140	139018	139018	Shirley	372	" If there should chance to be any disturbance in the night , captain ; if you should hear the picking of a lock , the cutting out of a pane of glass , a stealthy tread of steps about the house and I need not fear to tell you , who bear a well - tempered , mettlesome heart under your girl 's ribbon sash , that such little incidents are very possible in the present time , what would you do ? "
139141	139188	138798	138798	he	932	" Do n't know ; faint , perhaps - fall down , and have to be picked up again . But , doctor , if you assign me the post of honour , you must give me arms . What weapons are there in your stronghold ? "
139189	139197	139018	139018	Shirley	372	" You could not wield a sword ? "
139198	139210	138798	138798	he	932	" No ; I could manage the carving - knife better . "
139211	139243	139018	139018	Shirley	372	" You will find a good one in the dining - room sideboard - a lady 's knife , light to handle , and as sharp - pointed as a poniard . "
139244	139266	138798	138798	he	932	" It will suit Caroline . But you must give me a brace of pistols . I know you have pistols . "
139267	139297	139018	139018	Shirley	372	" I have two pairs . One pair I can place at your disposal . You will find them suspended over the mantelpiece of my study in cloth cases . "
139298	139301	138798	138798	he	932	" Loaded ? "
139302	139347	139381	139381	she	3396	" Yes , but not on the cock . Cock them before you go to bed . It is paying you a great compliment , captain , to lend you these . Were you one of the awkward squad you should not have them . "
139348	139380	139401	139401	she	3396	" I will take care . You need delay no longer , Mr. Helstone . You may go now . - He is gracious to me to lend me his pistols , "
139394	139400	139401	139401	she	3396	" But come , Lina , "
139404	139441	139505	139505	she	279	" let us go in and have some supper . I was too much vexed at tea with the vicinage of Mr. Sam Wynne to be able to eat , and now I am really hungry . "
139512	139523	139634	139634	she	279	" Shirley , I hear the beck in the Hollow . "
139654	139723	139734	139734	Shirley	372	" You assigned this to me , then , Shirley , did you ? It is bright , keen - edged , finely tapered ; it is dangerous - looking . I never yet felt the impulse which could move me to direct this against a fellow - creature . It is difficult to fancy that circumstances could nerve my arm to strike home with this long knife . "
139724	139732	139734	139734	Shirley	372	" I should hate to do it , "
139736	139755	139924	139924	she	279	" but I think I could do it , if goaded by certain exigencies which I can imagine . "
139910	139923	139965	139965	she	279	" There is neither spirit nor flesh in the house at present , "
139927	139964	139965	139965	she	279	" which should not be there . It is now near eleven o'clock , fully bedtime ; yet I would rather sit up a little longer , if you do not object , Shirley . Here , "
139968	139990	140012	140013	Miss Keeldar	372	" I have brought the brace of pistols from my uncle 's study . You may examine them at your leisure . "
140001	140010	139991	139991	She	279	" Why would you rather sit up longer ? "
140029	140042	139991	139991	She	279	" Because I have a strange , excited feeling in my heart . "
140043	140047	139991	139991	She	279	" So have I. "
140048	140067	139991	139991	She	279	" Is this state of sleeplessness and restlessness caused by something electrical in the air , I wonder ? "
140068	140086	139991	139991	She	279	" No ; the sky is clear , the stars numberless . It is a fine night . "
140087	140116	139991	139991	She	279	" But very still . I hear the water fret over its stony bed in Hollow 's Copse as distinctly as if it ran below the churchyard wall . "
140117	140142	139991	139991	She	279	" I am glad it is so still a night . A moaning wind or rushing rain would vex me to fever just now . "
140143	140148	139991	139991	She	279	" Why , Shirley ? "
140149	140159	139991	139991	She	279	" Because it would baffle my efforts to listen . "
140160	140168	139991	139991	She	279	" Do you listen towards the Hollow ? "
140169	140186	139991	139991	She	279	" Yes ; it is the only quarter whence we can hear a sound just now . "
140187	140194	140269	140270	Miss Keeldar	372	" The only one , Shirley . "
140253	140267	140269	140270	Miss Keeldar	372	" Mr. Helstone thinks we have no idea which way he is gone , "
140272	140296	140269	140270	Miss Keeldar	372	" nor on what errand , nor with what expectations , nor how prepared . But I guess much ; do not you ? "
140297	140302	140269	140270	Miss Keeldar	372	" I guess something . "
140303	140327	140343	140343	Caroline	279	" All those gentlemen - your cousin Moore included - think that you and I are now asleep in our beds , unconscious . "
140328	140341	140720	140720	She	372	" Caring nothing about them - hoping and fearing nothing for them , "
140679	140682	140718	140718	Shirley	372	" Halt ! "
140710	140716	140835	140835	They	3426	" We must hear this , "
140841	140858	140835	140835	They	3426	" It looks a rambling old building . Who lives in it besides the damned parson ? "
140859	140870	140835	140835	They	3426	" Only three women - his niece and two servants . "
140871	140879	140835	140835	They	3426	" Do you know where they sleep ? "
140880	140892	140835	140835	They	3426	" The lasses behind ; the niece in a front room . "
140893	140897	140835	140835	They	3426	" And Helstone ? "
140898	140916	140835	140835	They	3426	" Yonder is his chamber . He was burning a light , but I see none now . "
140917	140924	140835	140835	They	3426	" Where would you get in ? "
140925	140969	140835	140835	They	3426	" If I were ordered to do his job - and he desarves it - I 'd try yond ' long window ; it opens to the dining - room . I could grope my way upstairs , and I know his chamber . "
140970	140980	140835	140835	They	3426	" How would you manage about the women folk ? "
140981	141016	140835	140835	They	3426	" Let 'em alone except they shrieked , and then I 'd soon quieten 'em . I could wish to find the old chap asleep . If he waked , he 'd be dangerous . "
141017	141022	140835	140835	They	3426	" Has he arms ? "
141023	141032	140835	140835	They	3426	" Firearms , allus - and allus loadened . "
141033	141069	140835	140835	They	3426	" Then you 're a fool to stop us here . A shot would give the alarm . Moore would be on us before we could turn round . We should miss our main object . "
141070	141086	140835	140835	They	3426	" You might go on , I tell you . I 'd engage Helstone alone . "
141117	141122	140835	140835	They	3426	" That spoils all ! "
141127	141155	141198	141198	she	372	" He 'll awake . A noise like that might rouse the dead . You did not say there was a dog . Damn you ! Forward ! "
141191	141197	141201	141201	She	372	" Not a soul remains , "
141206	141210	141257	141257	she	279	" Thank God ! "
141250	141256	141257	141257	she	279	" Thank God for us ! "
141260	141280	141289	141289	Shirley	372	" But what will happen elsewhere ? They have passed us by that they may make sure of others . "
141281	141287	141289	141289	Shirley	372	" They have done well , "
141294	141402	141407	141407	she	372	" The others will defend themselves . They can do it . They are prepared for them . With us it is otherwise . My finger was on the trigger of this pistol . I was quite ready to give that man , if he had entered , such a greeting as he little calculated on ; but behind him followed three hundred . I had neither three hundred hands nor three hundred weapons . I could not have effectually protected either you , myself , or the two poor women asleep under that roof . Therefore I again earnestly thank God for insult and peril escaped . "
141410	141446	141407	141407	she	372	" What is it my duty and wisdom to do next ? Not to stay here inactive , I am glad to say , but , of course , to walk over to the Hollow . "
141447	141454	141407	141407	she	372	" To the Hollow , Shirley ? "
141455	141466	141407	141407	she	372	" To the Hollow . Will you go with me ? "
141467	141474	141407	141407	she	372	" Where those men are gone ? "
141475	141514	141407	141407	she	372	" They have taken the highway ; we should not encounter them . The road over the fields is as safe , silent , and solitary as a path through the air would be . Will you go ? "
141515	141518	141407	141407	she	372	" Yes , "
141561	141592	141407	141407	she	372	" Then we must fasten up these windows , and leave all as secure as we can behind us . Do you know what we are going for , Cary ? "
141593	141603	141407	141407	she	372	" Yes - no - because you wish it . "
141604	141727	141407	141407	she	372	" Is that all ? And are you so obedient to a mere caprice of mine ? What a docile wife you would make to a stern husband ! The moon 's face is not whiter than yours at this moment , and the aspen at the gate does not tremble more than your busy fingers ; and so , tractable and terror - struck , and dismayed and devoted , you would follow me into the thick of real danger ! Cary , let me give your fidelity a motive . We are going for Moore 's sake - to see if we can be of use to him , to make an effort to warn him of what is coming . "
141728	141763	141407	141407	she	372	" To be sure ! I am a blind , weak fool , and you are acute and sensible , Shirley . I will go with you ; I will gladly go with you ! "
141764	141812	141813	141813	Caroline	279	" I do not doubt it . You would die blindly and meekly for me , but you would intelligently and gladly die for Moore . But , in truth , there is no question of death to - night ; we run no risk at all . "
141820	141854	141407	141407	she	372	" Do not fear that I shall not have breath to run as fast as you can possibly run , Shirley . Take my hand . Let us go straight across the fields . "
141855	141863	141813	141813	Caroline	279	" But you can not climb walls ? "
141864	141871	141407	141407	she	372	" To - night I can . "
141872	141890	141813	141813	Caroline	279	" You are afraid of hedges , and the beck which we shall be forced to cross ? "
141891	141897	142084	142085	Miss Keeldar	372	" I can cross it . "
142075	142082	142084	142085	Miss Keeldar	372	" I will carry you across , "
142087	142102	142084	142085	Miss Keeldar	372	" You are light , and I am not weak . Let me try . "
142103	142115	142296	142296	Shirley	372	" If I fall in , you may fish me out , "
142283	142294	142296	142296	Shirley	372	" I thought we were dead at the first explosion , "
142303	142358	142524	142524	Shirley	372	" I felt myself hit in the temples , and I concluded your heart was pierced ; but the reiterated voice was an explanation . Those are signals - it is their way - the attack must be near . We should have had wings . Our feet have not borne us swiftly enough . "
142507	142522	142524	142524	Shirley	372	" Surely he is prepared . Surely that is not Moore meeting them alone ? "
142526	142542	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" It is . We must go to him . I will go to him . "
142543	142549	142524	142524	Shirley	372	" That you will not . "
142550	142569	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" Why did I come , then ? I came only for him . I shall join him . "
142570	142587	142524	142524	Shirley	372	" Fortunately it is out of your power . There is no entrance to the yard . "
142588	142619	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" There is a small entrance at the back , besides the gates in front . It opens by a secret method which I know . I will try it . "
142620	142626	142651	142651	she	372	" Not with my leave . "
142642	142650	142651	142651	she	372	" Not one step shall you stir , "
142656	142687	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" At this moment Moore would be both shocked and embarrassed if he saw either you or me . Men never want women near them in time of real danger . "
142688	142699	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" I would not trouble - I would help him , "
142704	142750	142651	142651	she	372	" How ? - by inspiring him with heroism ? Pooh ! these are not the days of chivalry . It is not a tilt at a tournament we are going to behold , but a struggle about money , and food , and life . "
142751	142763	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" It is natural that I should be at his side . "
142764	142832	142651	142651	she	372	" As queen of his heart ? His mill is his lady - love , Cary ! Backed by his factory and his frames , he has all the encouragement he wants or can know . It is not for love or beauty , but for ledger and broadcloth , he is going to break a spear . Do n't be sentimental ; Robert is not so . "
142833	142844	142627	142628	Miss Keeldar	372	" I could help him ; I will seek him . "
142845	142863	142879	142879	her	279	" Off then - I let you go - seek Moore . You 'll not find him . "
142887	142895	142941	142941	Shirley	372	" Look well there is no mistake ! "
142933	142939	142941	142941	Shirley	372	" Make haste , Lina ! "
142943	142950	142962	142962	she	279	" meet him before he enters . "
142955	142961	142962	142962	she	279	" It is not Robert , "
142965	142977	142915	142916	The figure	3461	" It has neither his height , form , nor bearing . "
142978	143131	142962	142962	she	279	" I saw it was not Robert when I let you go . How could you imagine it ? It is a shabby little figure of a private soldier ; they had posted him as sentinel . He is safe in the mill now . I saw the door open and admit him . My mind grows easier . Robert is prepared . Our warning would have been superfluous ; and now I am thankful we came too late to give it . It has saved us the trouble of a scene . How fine to have entered the counting - house toute éperdue , and to have found oneself in presence of Messrs. Armitage and Ramsden smoking , Malone swaggering , your uncle sneering , Mr. Sykes sipping a cordial , and Moore himself in his cold man - of - business vein ! I am glad we missed it all . "
143132	143145	142915	142916	The figure	3461	" I wonder if there are many in the mill , Shirley ! "
143146	143184	142962	142962	she	279	" Plenty to defend it . The soldiers we have twice seen to - day were going there , no doubt , and the group we noticed surrounding your cousin in the fields will be with him . "
143185	143199	142915	142916	The figure	3461	" What are they doing now , Shirley ? What is that noise ? "
143200	143218	142962	142962	she	279	" Hatchets and crowbars against the yard gates . They are forcing them . Are you afraid ? "
143219	143245	142915	142916	The figure	3461	" No ; but my heart throbs fast . I have a difficulty in standing . I will sit down . Do you feel unmoved ? "
143246	143328	142962	142962	she	279	" Hardly that ; but I am glad I came . We shall see what transpires with our own eyes . We are here on the spot , and none know it . Instead of amazing the curate , the clothier , and the corn - dealer with a romantic rush on the stage , we stand alone with the friendly night , its mute stars , and these whispering trees , whose report our friends will not come to gather . "
143329	143426	143434	143434	Shirley	372	" Shirley , Shirley , the gates are down ! That crash was like the felling of great trees . Now they are pouring through . They will break down the mill doors as they have broken the gate . What can Robert do against so many ? Would to God I were a little nearer him - could hear him speak - could speak to him ! With my will - my longing to serve him - I could not be a useless burden in his way ; I could be turned to some account . "
143427	143432	143470	143470	she	372	" They come on ! "
143436	143469	142962	142962	she	279	" How steadily they march in ! There is discipline in their ranks . I will not say there is courage - hundreds against tens are no proof of that quality - but "
143474	143491	142962	142962	she	279	" there is suffering and desperation enough amongst them . These goads will urge them forwards . "
143492	143514	142962	142962	she	279	" Forwards against Robert ; and they hate him . Shirley , is there much danger they will win the day ? "
143515	143539	143810	143811	the listeners	3480	" We shall see . Moore and Helstone are of ' earth 's first blood ' - no bunglers - no cravens - - "
143801	143805	143834	143834	Caroline	279	" What next ? "
143825	143832	143856	143856	Shirley	372	" He can not be alone ! "
143836	143854	143912	143912	Shirley	372	" I would stake all I have that he is as little alone as he is alarmed , "
143904	143910	143912	143912	Shirley	372	" Moore speaks at last ! "
143914	143932	143949	143949	Caroline	279	" and he seems to have the gift of tongues . That was not a single voice . "
143933	143947	143949	143949	Caroline	279	" He has been forbearing . No one can accuse him of rashness , "
143951	143975	144076	144078	the rebel leader	3492	" Their discharge preceded his . They broke his gates and his windows . They fired at his garrison before he repelled them . "
144081	144088	144076	144078	the rebel leader	3492	" To the back , lads ! "
144095	144104	144114	144115	the order	3493	" Come round ; we will meet you . "
144105	144112	144076	144078	the rebel leader	3492	" To the counting - house ! "
144118	144127	144271	144271	Caroline	279	" Welcome ! we shall have you there ! "
144315	144323	144271	144271	Caroline	279	" How and when would it end ? "
144333	144345	144958	144958	she	372	" Would a juncture arise in which they could be useful ? "
144948	144957	144994	144994	Caroline	279	" This is what I wished to prevent , "
144974	144992	144994	144994	Caroline	279	" But you could not prevent it ; you did your best - it was in vain , "
144997	145004	145023	145023	her	372	" Do n't grieve , Shirley . "
145005	145014	145023	145023	her	372	" I am sorry for those poor fellows , "
145029	145045	144994	144994	Caroline	279	" Are any within the mill hurt , I wonder ? Is that your uncle ? "
145046	145065	145070	145070	her	372	" It is , and there is Mr. Malone ; and , O Shirley , there is Robert ! "
145066	145068	145070	145070	her	372	" Well "
145074	145110	145070	145070	her	372	" do n't squeeze your fingers quite into my hand . I see . There is nothing wonderful in that . We knew he , at least , was here , whoever might be absent . "
145111	145121	145070	145070	her	372	" He is coming here towards us , Shirley ! "
145122	145152	145070	145070	her	372	" Towards the pump , that is to say , for the purpose of washing his hands and his forehead , which has got a scratch , I perceive . "
145153	145168	145070	145070	her	372	" He bleeds , Shirley . Do n't hold me . I must go . "
145169	145174	145070	145070	her	372	" Not a step . "
145175	145182	145070	145070	her	372	" He is hurt , Shirley ! "
145183	145186	145070	145070	her	372	" Fiddlestick ! "
145187	145210	145070	145070	her	372	" But I must go to him . I wish to go so much . I can not bear to be restrained . "
145211	145215	145070	145070	her	372	" What for ? "
145216	145236	145070	145070	her	372	" To speak to him , to ask how he is , and what I can do for him . "
145237	145283	145297	145297	Caroline	279	" To tease and annoy him ; to make a spectacle of yourself and him before those soldiers , Mr. Malone , your uncle , et cetera . Would he like it , think you ? Would you like to remember it a week hence ? "
145284	145295	145070	145070	her	372	" Am I always to be curbed and kept down ? "
145303	145339	145070	145070	her	372	" For his sake , yes ; and still more for your own . I tell you , if you showed yourself now you would repent it an hour hence , and so would Robert . "
145340	145351	145070	145070	her	372	" You think he would not like it , Shirley ? "
145352	145375	145070	145070	her	372	" Far less than he would like our stopping him to say good - night , which you were so sore about . "
145376	145388	145070	145070	her	372	" But that was all play ; there was no danger . "
145389	145401	145070	145070	her	372	" And this is serious work ; he must be unmolested . "
145402	145419	145070	145070	her	372	" I only wish to go to him because he is my cousin - you understand ? "
145420	145469	145566	145566	she	279	" I quite understand . But now , watch him . He has bathed his forehead , and the blood has ceased trickling . His hurt is really a mere graze ; I can see it from hence . He is going to look after the wounded men . "
145546	145565	145588	145589	Miss Keeldar	372	" Shirley , Shirley , I should have liked to speak one word to him before he went , "
145578	145586	145588	145589	Miss Keeldar	372	" Why do you cry , Lina ? "
145594	145642	145657	145658	the other	918	" You ought to be glad instead of sorry . Robert has escaped any serious harm ; he is victorious ; he has been cool and brave in combat ; he is now considerate in triumph . Is this a time - are these causes for weeping ? "
145643	145655	145657	145658	the other	918	" You do not know what I have in my heart , "
145660	145734	145783	145783	She	279	" what pain , what distraction - nor whence it arises . I can understand that you should exult in Robert 's greatness and goodness ; so do I , in one sense , but in another I feel so miserable . I am too far removed from him . I used to be nearer . Let me alone , Shirley . Do let me cry a few minutes ; it relieves me . "
145795	145840	145852	145853	Miss Keeldar	372	" Come , Shirley , we will go home now . I promise not to try to see Robert again till he asks for me . I never will try to push myself on him . I thank you for restraining me just now . "
145841	145850	145862	145862	she	279	" I did it with a good intention , "
145855	145861	145862	145862	she	279	" Now , dear Lina , "
145865	145961	146619	146619	God	249	" let us turn our faces to the cool morning breeze , and walk very quietly back to the rectory . We will steal in as we stole out . None shall know where we have been or what we have seen to - night ; neither taunt nor misconstruction can consequently molest us . To - morrow we will see Robert , and be of good cheer ; but I will say no more , lest I should begin to cry too . I seem hard towards you , but I am not so . "
146629	146637	146782	146782	Shirley	372	" Whom He loveth , He chasteneth . "
146767	146780	146819	146819	she	279	" To - day I shall have much to say to Moore , "
146808	146818	146819	146819	she	279	" He will have to undergo cross - examination , "
146822	146903	146929	146929	She	279	" I dare say he thinks he has outwitted me cleverly . And this is the way men deal with women - still concealing danger from them - thinking , I suppose , to spare them pain . They imagined we little knew where they were to - night . We know they little conjectured where we were . Men , I believe , fancy women 's minds something like those of children . Now , that is a mistake . "
146949	147123	146929	146929	She	279	" If men could see us as we really are , they would be a little amazed ; but the cleverest , the acutest men are often under an illusion about women . They do not read them in a true light ; they misapprehend them , both for good and evil . Their good woman is a queer thing , half doll , half angel ; their bad woman almost always a fiend . Then to hear them fall into ecstasies with each other 's creations - worshipping the heroine of such a poem , novel , drama - thinking it fine , divine ! Fine and divine it may be , but often quite artificial - false as the rose in my best bonnet there . If I spoke all I think on this point , if I gave my real opinion of some first - rate female characters in first - rate works , where should I be ? Dead under a cairn of avenging stones in half an hour . "
147124	147157	146929	146929	She	279	" Shirley , you chatter so , I ca n't fasten you . Be still . And , after all , authors ' heroines are almost as good as authoresses ' heroes . "
147158	147213	146929	146929	She	279	" Not at all . Women read men more truly than men read women . I 'll prove that in a magazine paper some day when I 've time ; only it will never be inserted . It will be ' declined with thanks , ' and left for me at the publisher 's . "
147214	147239	146929	146929	She	279	" To be sure . You could not write cleverly enough . You do n't know enough . You are not learned , Shirley . "
147240	147272	147294	147294	Caroline	279	" God knows I ca n't contradict you , Cary ; I 'm as ignorant as a stone . There 's one comfort , however : you are not much better . "
147278	147292	147297	147297	she	279	" I wonder how Mrs. Pryor and Hortense Moore have passed the night , "
147302	147353	146929	146929	She	279	" Selfish being that I am , I never thought of either of them till just now . They will have heard all the tumult , Fieldhead and the cottage are so near ; and Hortense is timid in such matters - so , no doubt , is Mrs. Pryor . "
147354	147418	147719	147719	Shirley	372	" Take my word for it , Lina , Moore will have contrived to get his sister out of the way . She went home with Miss Mann . He will have quartered her there for the night . As to Mrs. Pryor , I own I am uneasy about her ; but in another half - hour we will be with her . "
147707	147717	147719	147719	Shirley	372	" There are not two opinions on that head , "
147737	147752	147719	147719	Shirley	372	" But what will Fanny and Eliza do ? And if my uncle returns ? "
147753	147902	147918	147918	Caroline	279	" Your uncle will not return yet ; he has other fish to fry . He will be galloping backwards and forwards from Briarfield to Stilbro ' all day , rousing the magistrates in the court - house and the officers at the barracks ; and Fanny and Eliza can have in Joe Scott 's and the clerk 's wives to bear them company . Besides , of course , there is no real danger to be apprehended now . Weeks will elapse before the rioters can again rally , or plan any other attempt ; and I am much mistaken if Moore and Mr. Helstone will not take advantage of last night 's outbreak to quell them altogether . They will frighten the authorities of Stilbro ' into energetic measures . I only hope they will not be too severe - not pursue the discomfited too relentlessly . "
147903	147916	147929	147929	Shirley	372	" Robert will not be cruel . We saw that last night , "
147920	147927	147929	147929	Shirley	372	" But he will be hard , "
147931	147938	148229	148229	she	372	" and so will your uncle . "
148234	148244	148266	148267	a man	5692	" wondered what they were waiting for , then . "
148245	148264	148280	148280	Shirley	372	" We 're just talking a bit over this battle there has been at your mill , mistress , "
148269	148278	148280	148280	Shirley	372	" Talking a bit ! Just like you ! "
148282	148337	148421	148422	a man	5692	" It is a queer thing all the world is so fond of talking over events . You talk if anybody dies suddenly ; you talk if a fire breaks out ; you talk if a mill - owner fails ; you talk if he 's murdered . What good does your talking do ? "
148403	148419	148585	148585	she	372	" We 're no war nor some ' at is aboon us , are we ? "
148426	148485	148585	148585	she	372	" Nor a whit better . You that should be models of industry are just as gossip - loving as the idle . Fine , rich people that have nothing to do may be partly excused for trifling their time away ; you who have to earn your bread with the sweat of your brow are quite inexcusable . "
148486	148504	148585	148585	she	372	" That 's queer , mistress . Suld we never have a holiday because we work hard ? "
148505	148508	148519	148521	the " mistress	8066	" Never , "
148514	148517	148533	148533	her	372	" unless , "
148520	148523	148585	148585	she	372	" mistress , "
148536	148584	148585	148585	she	372	" unless you knew how to make a better use of it than to get together over rum and tea if you are women , or over beer and pipes if you are men , and talk scandal at your neighbours ' expense . Come , friends , "
148596	148631	148669	148669	Shirley	372	" oblige me by taking your cans and going home . I expect several persons to call to - day , and it will be inconvenient to have the avenues to the house crowded . "
148654	148667	148881	148881	she	375	" Thank you , and good - bye to you , friends , "
148875	148880	148881	148881	she	375	" You are aware , "
148905	149054	149063	149063	Shirley	372	" that a body of rioters has attacked Mr. Moore 's mill to - night . We heard the firing and confusion very plainly here ; we none of us slept . It was a sad night . The house has been in great bustle all the morning with people coming and going . The servants have applied to me for orders and directions , which I really did not feel warranted in giving . Mr. Moore has , I believe , sent up for refreshments for the soldiers and others engaged in the defence , for some conveniences also for the wounded . I could not undertake the responsibility of giving orders or taking measures . I fear delay may have been injurious in some instances ; but this is not my house . You were absent , my dear Miss Keeldar . What could I do ? "
149055	149061	149266	149266	She	3638	" Were no refreshments sent ? "
149094	149102	149266	149266	She	3638	" I think not , my dear . "
149103	149119	149266	149266	She	3638	" And nothing for the wounded - no linen , no wine , no bedding ? "
149120	149214	149266	149266	She	3638	" I think not . I can not tell what Mrs. Gill did ; but it seemed impossible to me , at the moment , to venture to dispose of your property by sending supplies to soldiers . Provisions for a company of soldiers sounds formidable . How many there are I did not ask ; but I could not think of allowing them to pillage the house , as it were . I intended to do what was right , yet I did not see the case quite clearly , I own . "
149215	149265	149547	149547	she	1415	" It lies in a nutshell , notwithstanding . These soldiers have risked their lives in defence of my property : I suppose they have a right to my gratitude . The wounded are our fellow - creatures : I suppose we should aid them . - Mrs. Gill ! "
149533	149546	149670	149670	she	385	" They might have come before if their will had been good , "
149662	149668	149854	149855	Mrs. Gill	385	" all of a tremble , "
149740	149753	149764	149765	the housekeeper	3604	" How long is it since that message came from the mill ? "
149754	149762	149854	149855	Mrs. Gill	385	" Not an hour yet , ma'am , "
149768	149826	149859	149859	she	385	" Not an hour ! You might almost as well have said not a day . They will have applied elsewhere by this time . Send a man instantly down to tell them that everything this house contains is at Mr. Moore 's , Mr. Helstone 's , and the soldiers ' service . Do that first . "
149890	149959	149982	149982	Caroline	279	" Let the contents of the larder and the wine - cellar be brought up , put into the hay - carts , and driven down to the Hollow . If there does not happen to be much bread or much meat in the house , go to the butcher and baker , and desire them to send what they have . But I will see for myself . "
149964	149980	149995	149995	she	385	" All will be right soon ; she will get over it in an hour , "
149987	149994	149995	149995	she	385	" Go upstairs , dear madam , "
149999	150029	150075	150075	she	279	" and try to be as calm and easy as you can . The truth is , Shirley will blame herself more than you before the day is over . "
150078	150085	150214	150214	Shirley	372	" if she could be useful . "
150206	150212	150214	150214	Shirley	372	" This is a shame ! "
150220	150227	150339	150339	he	683	" It will strain your arm . "
150327	150338	150568	150568	she	372	" I hope I see Miss Keeldar well this morning ? "
150400	150410	150568	150568	she	372	" Well enough , if she be good enough , "
150415	150483	150593	150593	he	230	" and so is Mr. Moore too , I dare say . To speak truth , I am not anxious about him ; some slight mischance would be only his just due . His conduct has been - we will say strange just now , till we have time to characterize it by a more exact epithet . Meantime , may I ask what brings him here ? "
150484	150562	150623	150623	he	230	" Mr. Helstone and I have just received your message that everything at Fieldhead was at our service . We judged , by the unlimited wording of the gracious intimation , that you would be giving yourself too much trouble . I perceive our conjecture was correct . We are not a regiment , remember - only about half a dozen soldiers and as many civilians . Allow me to retrench something from these too abundant supplies . "
150614	150622	150623	150623	he	230	" The rector must hear of this , "
150626	150647	150649	150649	he	230	" he will make a good story of it . What an excellent army contractor Miss Keeldar would have been ! "
150654	150662	150672	150672	Shirley	372	" It is precisely as I conjectured . "
150663	150670	150672	150672	Shirley	372	" You ought to be thankful , "
150674	150730	150738	150738	Moore	230	" and not mock me . What could I do ? How could I gauge your appetites or number your band ? For aught I knew , there might have been fifty of you at least to victual . You told me nothing ; and then an application to provision soldiers naturally suggests large ideas . "
150731	150736	150758	150758	he	230	" It appears so , "
150754	150757	150758	150758	he	230	" Now , "
150765	150793	150885	150885	she	279	" I think you may take what remains to the Hollow . Your load will be somewhat lighter than the one Miss Keeldar destined you to carry . "
150817	150829	150854	150854	Caroline	279	" There was not a single man hurt on our side , "
150834	150844	150904	150904	she	279	" You were hurt yourself , on the temples , "
150897	150903	150885	150885	she	279	" Are you much hurt ? "
150907	150920	150885	150885	she	279	" As you might scratch your finger with a needle in sewing . "
150921	150930	150991	150991	Moore	230	" Lift your hair and let us see . "
150980	150989	150966	150966	she	279	" How did she know I was hurt ? "
150993	151039	150966	150966	she	279	" By rumour , no doubt . But it is too good in her to trouble herself about you . For my part , it was of your victims I was thinking when I inquired after the wounded . What damage have your opponents sustained ? "
151040	151061	150966	150966	she	279	" One of the rioters , or victims as you call them , was killed , and six were hurt . "
151062	151070	150966	150966	she	279	" What have you done with them ? "
151071	151109	150966	150966	she	279	" What you will perfectly approve . Medical aid was procured immediately ; and as soon as we can get a couple of covered wagons and some clean straw , they will be removed to Stilbro ' . "
151110	151142	150966	150966	she	279	" Straw ! You must have beds and bedding . I will send my wagon directly , properly furnished ; and Mr. Yorke , I am sure , will send his . "
151143	151290	150966	150966	she	279	" You guess correctly ; he has volunteered already . And Mrs. Yorke - who , like you , seems disposed to regard the rioters as martyrs , and me , and especially Mr. Helstone , as murderers - is at this moment , I believe , most assiduously engaged in fitting it up with feather - beds , pillows , bolsters , blankets , etc . The victims lack no attentions , I promise you . Mr. Hall , your favourite parson , has been with them ever since six o'clock , exhorting them , praying with them , and even waiting on them like any nurse ; and Caroline 's good friend , Miss Ainley , that very plain old maid , sent in a stock of lint and linen , something in the proportion of another lady 's allowance of beef and wine . "
151291	151301	150966	150966	she	279	" That will do . Where is your sister ? "
151302	151339	150966	150966	she	279	" Well cared for . I had her securely domiciled with Miss Mann . This very morning the two set out for Wormwood Wells a noted watering - place , and will stay there some weeks . "
151340	151449	150966	150966	she	279	" So Mr. Helstone domiciled me at the rectory ! Mighty clever you gentlemen think you are ! I make you heartily welcome to the idea , and hope its savour , as you chew the cud of reflection upon it , gives you pleasure . Acute and astute , why are you not also omniscient ? How is it that events transpire , under your very noses , of which you have no suspicion ? It should be so , otherwise the exquisite gratification of outmanoeuvring you would be unknown . Ah , friend , you may search my countenance , but you can not read it . "
151461	151477	150966	150966	she	279	" You think me a dangerous specimen of my sex . Do n't you now ? "
151478	151486	150966	150966	she	279	" A peculiar one , at least . "
151487	151495	150966	150966	she	279	" But Caroline - is she peculiar ? "
151496	151503	150966	150966	she	279	" In her way - yes . "
151504	151513	150966	150966	she	279	" Her way ! What is her way ? "
151514	151524	150966	150966	she	279	" You know her as well as I do . "
151525	151545	150966	150966	she	279	" And knowing her , I assert that she is neither eccentric nor difficult of control . Is she ? "
151546	151551	150966	150966	she	279	" That depends - - "
151552	151562	150966	150966	she	279	" However , there is nothing masculine about her ? "
151563	151585	150966	150966	she	279	" Why lay such emphasis on her ? Do you consider her a contrast , in that respect , to yourself ? "
151586	151615	150966	150966	she	279	" You do , no doubt ; but that does not signify . Caroline is neither masculine , nor of what they call the spirited order of women . "
151616	151624	150966	150966	she	279	" I have seen her flash out . "
151625	151655	150966	150966	she	279	" So have I , but not with manly fire . It was a short , vivid , trembling glow , that shot up , shone , vanished - - "
151656	151672	150966	150966	she	279	" And left her scared at her own daring . You describe others besides Caroline . "
151673	151707	151719	151719	Moore	230	" The point I wish to establish is , that Miss Helstone , though gentle , tractable , and candid enough , is still perfectly capable of defying even Mr. Moore 's penetration . "
151708	151717	150966	150966	she	279	" What have you and she been doing ? "
151722	151729	150966	150966	she	279	" Have you had any breakfast ? "
151730	151737	150966	150966	she	279	" What is your mutual mystery ? "
151738	151788	151846	151846	She	279	" If you are hungry , Mrs. Gill will give you something to eat here . Step into the oak parlour , and ring the bell . You will be served as if at an inn ; or , if you like better , go back to the Hollow . "
151789	151818	151932	151932	she	279	" The alternative is not open to me ; I must go back . Good - morning . The first leisure I have I will see you again . "
151920	151931	151932	151932	she	279	" I am deficient in self - confidence and decision , "
151937	152027	151932	151932	she	279	" I always have been deficient in those qualities . Yet I think Miss Keeldar should have known my character well enough by this time to be aware that I always feel an even painful solicitude to do right , to act for the best . The unusual nature of the demand on my judgment puzzled me , especially following the alarms of the night . I could not venture to act promptly for another ; but I trust no serious harm will result from my lapse of firmness . "
152043	152049	152085	152085	she	372	" Caroline , come here , "
152078	152084	152096	152096	Caroline	279	" How is Mrs. Pryor ? "
152088	152094	152115	152115	Shirley	372	" Rather out of spirits , "
152098	152113	152115	152115	Shirley	372	" I have behaved very shamefully , very ungenerously , very ungratefully to her , "
152117	152166	152199	152199	She	375	" How insolent in me to turn on her thus for what , after all , was no fault - only an excess of conscientiousness on her part . But I regret my error most sincerely . Tell her so , and ask if she will forgive me . "
152203	152210	152233	152233	she	372	" Come in , my dear . "
152236	152264	152221	152221	her	372	" You know you must forgive me , Mrs. Pryor . I could not get on at all if there was a misunderstanding between you and me . "
152265	152272	152221	152221	her	372	" I have nothing to forgive , "
152277	152311	152484	152484	he	932	" We will pass it over now , if you please . The final result of the incident is that it proves more plainly than ever how unequal I am to certain crises . "
152464	152483	152538	152538	he	932	" The vials of pharisaical wrath will be emptied on our heads for our share in this business , "
152487	152537	152538	152538	he	932	" but I defy every calumniator . I was there only to support the law , to play my part as a man and a Briton ; which characters I deem quite compatible with those of the priest and Levite , in their highest sense . Your tenant Moore , "
152542	152720	152915	152923	the ' sanguinary , demoniac " rector and curate	8170	" has won my approbation . A cooler commander I would not wish to see , nor a more determined . Besides , the man has shown sound judgment and good sense - first , in being thoroughly prepared for the event which has taken place ; and subsequently , when his well - concerted plans had secured him success , in knowing how to use without abusing his victory . Some of the magistrates are now well frightened , and , like all cowards , show a tendency to be cruel . Moore restrains them with admirable prudence . He has hitherto been very unpopular in the neighbourhood ; but , mark my words , the tide of opinion will now take a turn in his favour . People will find out that they have not appreciated him , and will hasten to remedy their error ; and he , when he perceives the public disposed to acknowledge his merits , will show a more gracious mien than that with which he has hitherto favoured us . "
152920	152938	152944	152944	he	245	" rector and curate . According to him , the cup of ecclesiastical guilt was now full indeed .
152939	152943	152944	152944	he	245	" The church , "
152947	152987	153002	153002	Shirley	372	" was in a bonny pickle now . It was time it came down when parsons took to swaggering amang soldiers , blazing away wi ' bullet and gunpowder , taking the lives of far honester men than themselves . "
152988	153000	153002	153002	Shirley	372	" What would Moore have done if nobody had helped him ? "
153004	153017	153002	153002	Shirley	372	" Drunk as he 'd brewed , eaten as he 'd baked . "
153018	153060	153002	153002	Shirley	372	" Which means you would have left him by himself to face that mob . Good ! He has plenty of courage , but the greatest amount of gallantry that ever garrisoned one human breast could scarce avail against two hundred . "
153061	153084	153002	153002	Shirley	372	" He had the soldiers , those poor slaves who hire out their own blood and spill other folk 's for money . "
153085	153205	153002	153002	Shirley	372	" You abuse soldiers almost as much as you abuse clergymen . All who wear red coats are national refuse in your eyes , and all who wear black are national swindlers . Mr. Moore , according to you , did wrong to get military aid , and he did still worse to accept of any other aid . Your way of talking amounts to this : he should have abandoned his mill and his life to the rage of a set of misguided madmen , and Mr. Helstone and every other gentleman in the parish should have looked on , and seen the building razed and its owner slaughtered , and never stirred a finger to save either . "
153206	153235	153245	153246	Miss Keeldar	372	" If Moore had behaved to his men from the beginning as a master ought to behave , they never would have entertained their present feelings towards him . "
153236	153243	153245	153246	Miss Keeldar	372	" Easy for you to talk , "
153260	153518	153530	153531	Mr. Yorke	245	" you , whose family have lived at Briarmains for six generations , to whose person the people have been accustomed for fifty years , who know all their ways , prejudices , and preferences - easy , indeed , for you to act so as to avoid offending them . But Mr. Moore came a stranger into the district ; he came here poor and friendless , with nothing but his own energies to back him , nothing but his honour , his talent , and his industry to make his way for him . A monstrous crime indeed that , under such circumstances , he could not popularize his naturally grave , quiet manners all at once ; could not be jocular , and free , and cordial with a strange peasantry , as you are with your fellow - townsmen ! An unpardonable transgression that when he introduced improvements he did not go about the business in quite the most politic way , did not graduate his changes as delicately as a rich capitalist might have done ! For errors of this sort is he to be the victim of mob outrage ? Is he to be denied even the privilege of defending himself ? Are those who have the hearts of men in their breasts and Mr. Helstone , say what you will of him , has such a heart to be reviled like malefactors because they stand by him , because they venture to espouse the cause of one against two hundred ? "
153519	153528	153245	153246	Miss Keeldar	372	" Come , come now , be cool , "
153545	153734	153878	153878	he	245	" Cool ! Must I listen coolly to downright nonsense - to dangerous nonsense ? No . I like you very well , Mr. Yorke , as you know , but I thoroughly dislike some of your principles . All that ca nt - excuse me , but I repeat the word - all that ca nt about soldiers and parsons is most offensive in my ears . All ridiculous , irrational crying up of one class , whether the same be aristocrat or democrat - all howling down of another class , whether clerical or military - all exacting injustice to individuals , whether monarch or mendicant - is really sickening to me ; all arraying of ranks against ranks , all party hatreds , all tyrannies disguised as liberties , I reject and wash my hands of . You think you are a philanthropist ; you think you are an advocate of liberty ; but I will tell you this - Mr. Hall , the parson of Nunnely , is a better friend both of man and freedom than Hiram Yorke , the reformer of Briarfield . "
153869	153877	153914	153915	the speaker	782	" What more hast thou to say ? "
153903	153909	154358	154358	I	0	" Say , Mr. Yorke ! "
154368	154368	154759	154759	Shirley	372	"
154369	154392	154358	154358	I	0	" You have an ill opinion of me , Miss Shirley . You never told me so much of your mind before . "
154393	154495	154759	154759	Shirley	372	" I never had an opening . But I have sat on Jessy 's stool by your chair in the back - parlour at Briarmains , for evenings together , listening excitedly to your talk , half admiring what you said , and half rebelling against it . I think you a fine old Yorkshireman , sir . I am proud to have been born in the same county and parish as yourself . Truthful , upright , independent you are , as a rock based below seas ; but also you are harsh , rude , narrow , and merciless . "
154496	154521	154358	154358	I	0	" Not to the poor , lass , nor to the meek of the earth ; only to the proud and high - minded . "
154522	154690	154701	154702	Mr. Yorke	245	" And what right have you , sir , to make such distinctions ? A prouder , a higher - minded man than yourself does not exist . You find it easy to speak comfortably to your inferiors ; you are too haughty , too ambitious , too jealous to be civil to those above you . But you are all alike . Helstone also is proud and prejudiced . Moore , though juster and more considerate than either you or the rector , is still haughty , stern , and , in a public sense , selfish . It is well there are such men as Mr. Hall to be found occasionally - men of large and kind hearts , who can love their whole race , who can forgive others for being richer , more prosperous , or more powerful than they are . Such men may have less originality , less force of character than you , but they are better friends to mankind . "
154691	154699	154358	154358	I	0	" And when is it to be ? "
154707	154714	154358	154358	I	0	" When is what to be ? "
154715	154719	154358	154358	I	0	" The wedding . "
154720	154724	154358	154358	I	0	" Whose wedding ? "
154725	154758	154795	154795	she	372	" Only that of Robert Gérard Moore , Esq . , of Hollow 's Cottage , with Miss Keeldar , daughter and heiress of the late Charles Cave Keeldar of Fieldhead Hall . "
154788	154794	154795	154795	she	372	" That is your revenge , "
154802	154820	154772	154772	her	372	" Would it be a bad match , unworthy of the late Charles Cave Keeldar 's representative ? "
154821	154841	154795	154795	she	372	" My lass , Moore is a gentleman ; his blood is pure and ancient as mine or thine . "
154842	154867	154911	154911	Shirley	372	" And we two set store by ancient blood ? We have family pride , though one of us at least is a republican ? "
154903	154909	155044	155044	She	372	" Moore is a gentleman , "
155052	155070	155034	155034	She	372	" And if Moore is a gentleman , you can be only a lady ; therefore - - "
155071	155082	155044	155044	She	372	" Therefore there would be no inequality in our union . "
155083	155086	155034	155034	She	372	" None . "
155087	155111	155170	155170	he	245	" Thank you for your approbation . Will you give me away when I relinquish the name of Keeldar for that of Moore ? "
155162	155169	155176	155176	She	372	" I do n't understand thee , "
155179	155208	155255	155255	she	372	" Take courage , sir ; you are not singular in your ignorance . But I suppose if Moore understands me that will do , will it not ? "
155209	155230	155255	155255	she	372	" Moore may settle his own matters henceforward for me ; I 'll neither meddle nor make with them further . "
155258	155275	155255	155255	she	372	" Have you been asked to interfere ? Are you questioning me as another 's proxy ? "
155276	155311	156147	156147	she	375	" The Lord save us ! Whoever weds thee must look about him ! Keep all your questions for Robert ; I 'll answer no more on 'em . Good - day , lassie ! "
156176	156216	156226	156227	Miss Helstone	279	" I do hope this sweet air blowing from the hill will do you good , my dear Caroline . I wish I could see something more of colour in these cheeks ; but perhaps you were never florid ? "
156217	156224	156274	156277	the girl of eighteen	3794	" I had red cheeks once , "
156231	156272	156274	156277	the girl of eighteen	3794	" I remember a year - two years ago - when I used to look in the glass , I saw a different face there to what I see now - rounder and rosier . But when we are young , "
156279	156289	156296	156297	Mrs. Pryor	375	" our minds are careless and our lives easy . "
156290	156294	156296	156297	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Do you , "
156327	156362	156431	156432	Mrs. Pryor	375	" do you , at your age , fret yourself with cares for the future ? Believe me , you had better not . Let the morrow take thought for the things of itself . "
156363	156397	156296	156297	Mrs. Pryor	375	" True , dear madam . It is not over the future I pine . The evil of the day is sometimes oppressive - too oppressive - and I long to escape it . "
156398	156430	156470	156470	she	279	" That is - the evil of the day - that is - your uncle perhaps is not - you find it difficult to understand - he does not appreciate - - "
156462	156469	156704	156704	She	3797	" Oh , that is nothing , "
156473	156703	156704	156704	She	3797	" My uncle and I get on very well . We never quarrel - I do n't call him harsh - he never scolds me . Sometimes I wish somebody in the world loved me , but I can not say that I particularly wish him to have more affection for me than he has . As a child , I should perhaps have felt the want of attention , only the servants were very kind to me ; but when people are long indifferent to us , we grow indifferent to their indifference . It is my uncle 's way not to care for women and girls , unless they be ladies that he meets in company . He could not alter , and I have no wish that he should alter , as far as I am concerned . I believe it would merely annoy and frighten me were he to be affectionate towards me now . But you know , Mrs. Pryor , it is scarcely living to measure time as I do at the rectory . The hours pass , and I get them over somehow , but I do not live . I endure existence , but I rarely enjoy it . Since Miss Keeldar and you came I have been - I was going to say happier , but that would be untrue . "
156707	156725	156440	156440	she	375	" How untrue ? You are fond of Miss Keeldar , are you not , my dear ? "
156726	156766	156704	156704	She	3797	" Very fond of Shirley . I both like and admire her . But I am painfully circumstanced . For a reason I can not explain I want to go away from this place , and to forget it . "
156767	157263	156440	156440	she	375	" You told me before you wished to be a governess ; but , my dear , if you remember , I did not encourage the idea . I have been a governess myself great part of my life . In Miss Keeldar 's acquaintance I esteem myself most fortunate . Her talents and her really sweet disposition have rendered my office easy to me ; but when I was young , before I married , my trials were severe , poignant . I should not like a - - I should not like you to endure similar ones . It was my lot to enter a family of considerable pretensions to good birth and mental superiority , and the members of which also believed that ' on them was perceptible ' an unusual endowment of the ' Christian graces ; ' that all their hearts were regenerate , and their spirits in a peculiar state of discipline . I was early given to understand that ' as I was not their equal , ' so I could not expect ' to have their sympathy . ' It was in no sort concealed from me that I was held a ' burden and a restraint in society . ' The gentlemen , I found , regarded me as a ' tabooed woman , ' to whom ' they were interdicted from granting the usual privileges of the sex , ' and yet ' who annoyed them by frequently crossing their path . ' The ladies too made it plain that they thought me ' a bore . ' The servants , it was signified , ' detested me ; ' why , I could never clearly comprehend . My pupils , I was told , ' however much they might love me , and how deep soever the interest I might take in them , could not be my friends . ' It was intimated that I must ' live alone , and never transgress the invisible but rigid line which established the difference between me and my employers . ' My life in this house was sedentary , solitary , constrained , joyless , toilsome . The dreadful crushing of the animal spirits , the ever - prevailing sense of friendlessness and homelessness consequent on this state of things began ere long to produce mortal effects on my constitution . I sickened . The lady of the house told me coolly I was the victim of ' wounded vanity . ' She hinted that if I did not make an effort to quell my ' ungodly discontent , ' to cease ' murmuring against God 's appointment , ' and to cultivate the profound humility befitting my station , my mind would very likely ' go to pieces ' on the rock that wrecked most of my sisterhood - morbid self - esteem - and that I should die an inmate of a lunatic asylum .
157264	157422	156704	156704	She	3797	" I said nothing to Mrs. Hardman - it would have been useless ; but to her eldest daughter I one day dropped a few observations , which were answered thus . There were hardships , she allowed , in the position of a governess . ' Doubtless they had their trials ; but , ' she averred , with a manner it makes me smile now to recall - ' but it must be so . She ' Miss H. ' had neither view , hope , nor wish to see these things remedied ; for in the inherent constitution of English habits , feelings , and prejudices there was no possibility that they should be . Governesses , ' she observed , ' must ever be kept in a sort of isolation . It is the only means of maintaining that distance which the reserve of English manners and the decorum of English families exact . '
157423	157523	156440	156440	she	375	" I remember I sighed as Miss Hardman quitted my bedside . She caught the sound , and turning , said severely , ' I fear , Miss Grey , you have inherited in fullest measure the worst sin of our fallen nature - the sin of pride . You are proud , and therefore you are ungrateful too . Mamma pays you a handsome salary , and if you had average sense you would thankfully put up with much that is fatiguing to do and irksome to bear , since it is so well made worth your while . '
157524	157624	157631	157632	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Miss Hardman , my love , was a very strong - minded young lady , of most distinguished talents . The aristocracy are decidedly a very superior class , you know , both physically , and morally , and mentally ; as a high Tory I acknowledge that . I could not describe the dignity of her voice and mien as she addressed me thus ; still , I fear she was selfish , my dear . I would never wish to speak ill of my superiors in rank , but I think she was a little selfish . "
157625	157629	157631	157632	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I remember , "
157638	157758	156440	156440	she	375	" another of Miss H. 's observations , which she would utter with quite a grand air . ' WE , ' she would say - ' WE need the imprudences , extravagances , mistakes , and crimes of a certain number of fathers to sow the seed from which WE reap the harvest of governesses . The daughters of trades - people , however well educated , must necessarily be underbred , and as such unfit to be inmates of OUR dwellings , or guardians of OUR children 's minds and persons . WE shall ever prefer to place those about OUR offspring who have been born and bred with somewhat of the same refinement as OURSELVES . ' "
157759	157828	157631	157632	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Miss Hardman must have thought herself something better than her fellow - creatures , ma'am , since she held that their calamities , and even crimes , were necessary to minister to her convenience . You say she was religious . Her religion must have been that of the Pharisee who thanked God that he was not as other men are , nor even as that publican . "
157829	158090	158115	158116	Mrs. Pryor	375	" My dear , we will not discuss the point . I should be the last person to wish to instil into your mind any feeling of dissatisfaction with your lot in life , or any sentiment of envy or insubordination towards your superiors . Implicit submission to authorities , scrupulous deference to our betters under which term I , of course , include the higher classes of society , are , in my opinion , indispensable to the well - being of every community . All I mean to say , my dear , is that you had better not attempt to be a governess , as the duties of the position would be too severe for your constitution . Not one word of disrespect would I breathe towards either Mrs. or Miss Hardman ; only , recalling my own experience , I can not but feel that , were you to fall under auspices such as theirs , you would contend a while courageously with your doom , then you would pine and grow too weak for your work ; you would come home - if you still had a home - broken down . Those languishing years would follow of which none but the invalid and her immediate friends feel the heart - sickness and know the burden . Consumption or decline would close the chapter . Such is the history of many a life . I would not have it yours . My dear , we will now walk about a little , if you please . "
158106	158110	158126	158126	her	375	" My dear , "
158132	158167	158207	158207	she	279	" the young , especially those to whom nature has been favourable , often - frequently - anticipate - look forward to - to marriage as the end , the goal of their hopes . "
158199	158206	158207	158207	she	279	" They do , and naturally , "
158219	158247	158256	158257	Mrs. Pryor	375	" They look forward to marriage with some one they love as the brightest , the only bright destiny that can await them . Are they wrong ? "
158248	158254	158294	158294	she	279	" Oh , my dear ! "
158289	158293	158294	158294	she	279	" My dear , "
158297	158303	158265	158265	she	375	" life is an illusion . "
158304	158331	158294	158294	she	279	" But not love ! Love is real - the most real , the most lasting , the sweetest and yet the bitterest thing we know . "
158332	158408	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" My dear , it is very bitter . It is said to be strong - strong as death ! Most of the cheats of existence are strong . As to their sweetness , nothing is so transitory ; its date is a moment , the twinkling of an eye . The sting remains for ever . It may perish with the dawn of eternity , but it tortures through time into its deepest night . "
158409	158417	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" Yes , it tortures through time , "
158421	158429	158294	158294	she	279	" except when it is mutual love . "
158430	158450	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" Mutual love ! My dear , romances are pernicious . You do not read them , I hope ? "
158451	158483	158493	158494	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Sometimes - whenever I can get them , indeed . But romance - writers might know nothing of love , judging by the way in which they treat of it . "
158484	158491	158493	158494	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Nothing whatever , my dear , "
158497	158550	158561	158561	Caroline	279	" nor of marriage ; and the false pictures they give of those subjects can not be too strongly condemned . They are not like reality . They show you only the green , tempting surface of the marsh , and give not one faithful or truthful hint of the slough underneath . "
158551	158559	158561	158561	Caroline	279	" But it is not always slough , "
158563	158586	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" There are happy marriages . Where affection is reciprocal and sincere , and minds are harmonious , marriage must be happy . "
158587	158655	158666	158666	Caroline	279	" It is never wholly happy . Two people can never literally be as one . There is , perhaps , a possibility of content under peculiar circumstances , such as are seldom combined ; but it is as well not to run the risk - you may make fatal mistakes . Be satisfied , my dear . Let all the single be satisfied with their freedom . "
158656	158664	158666	158666	Caroline	279	" You echo my uncle 's words ! "
158674	158702	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" You speak like Mrs. Yorke in her most gloomy moments , like Miss Mann when she is most sourly and hypochondriacally disposed . This is terrible ! "
158703	158778	158793	158793	Caroline	279	" No , it is only true . O child , you have only lived the pleasant morning time of life ; the hot , weary noon , the sad evening , the sunless night , are yet to come for you . Mr. Helstone , you say , talks as I talk ; and I wonder how Mrs. Matthewson Helstone would have talked had she been living . She died ! she died ! "
158779	158791	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" And , alas ! my own mother and father - - "
158801	158806	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" What of them ? "
158807	158818	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" Did I never tell you that they were separated ? "
158819	158825	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" I have heard it . "
158826	158837	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" They must , then , have been very miserable . "
158838	158850	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" You see all facts go to prove what I say . "
158851	158865	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" In this case there ought to be no such thing as marriage . "
158866	158898	158419	158419	Caroline	279	" There ought , my dear , were it only to prove that this life is a mere state of probation , wherein neither rest nor recompense is to be vouchsafed . "
158899	158908	158946	158947	the lady	2491	" But your own marriage , Mrs. Pryor ? "
158938	158944	158946	158947	the lady	2491	" My marriage was unhappy , "
158954	158959	158969	158969	Caroline	279	" but yet - - "
158963	158967	158969	158969	Caroline	279	" But yet , "
158971	158976	158989	158989	she	2491	" not immitigably wretched ? "
158977	158988	158989	158989	she	2491	" Not in its results , at least . No , "
158997	159125	159134	159134	They	3802	" God mingles something of the balm of mercy even in vials of the most corrosive woe . He can so turn events that from the very same blind , rash act whence sprang the curse of half our life may flow the blessing of the remainder . Then I am of a peculiar disposition - I own that - far from facile , without address , in some points eccentric . I ought never to have married . Mine is not the nature easily to find a duplicate or likely to assimilate with a contrast . I was quite aware of my own ineligibility ; and if I had not been so miserable as a governess , I never should have married ; and then - - "
159155	159271	159134	159134	They	3802	" And then , my dear , Mr. - that is , the gentleman I married - was , perhaps , rather an exceptional than an average character . I hope , at least , the experience of few has been such as mine was , or that few have felt their sufferings as I felt mine . They nearly shook my mind ; relief was so hopeless , redress so unattainable . But , my dear , I do not wish to dishearten ; I only wish to warn you , and to prove that the single should not be too anxious to change their state , as they may change for the worse . "
159272	159330	159134	159134	They	3802	" Thank you , my dear madam . I quite understand your kind intentions , but there is no fear of my falling into the error to which you allude . I , at least , have no thoughts of marriage , and for that reason I want to make myself a position by some other means . "
159331	159532	159134	159134	They	3802	" My dear , listen to me . On what I am going to say I have carefully deliberated , having , indeed , revolved the subject in my thoughts ever since you first mentioned your wish to obtain a situation . You know I at present reside with Miss Keeldar in the capacity of companion . Should she marry and that she will marry ere long many circumstances induce me to conclude , I shall cease to be necessary to her in that capacity . I must tell you that I possess a small independency , arising partly from my own savings , and partly from a legacy left me some years since . Whenever I leave Fieldhead I shall take a house of my own . I could not endure to live in solitude . I have no relations whom I care to invite to close intimacy ; for , as you must have observed , and as I have already avowed , my habits and tastes have their peculiarities . To you , my dear , I need not say I am attached ; with you I am happier than I have ever been with any living thing "
159540	159583	159758	159758	Caroline	279	" Your society I should esteem a very dear privilege - an inestimable privilege , a comfort , a blessing . You shall come to me , then . Caroline , do you refuse me ? I hope you can love me ? "
159593	159601	159758	159758	Caroline	279	" Indeed , I do love you , "
159606	159621	159630	159631	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I should like to live with you . But you are too kind . "
159622	159627	159630	159631	Mrs. Pryor	375	" All I have , "
159633	159662	159758	159758	Caroline	279	" I would leave to you . You should be provided for . But never again say I am too kind . You pierce my heart , child ! "
159663	159679	159630	159631	Mrs. Pryor	375	" But , my dear madam - this generosity - I have no claim - - "
159680	159739	159758	159758	Caroline	279	" Hush ! you must not talk about it . There are some things we can not bear to hear . Oh ! it is late to begin , but I may yet live a few years . I can never wipe out the past , but perhaps a brief space in the future may yet be mine . "
159772	159782	159833	159833	she	2491	" I love you dearly . Do n't cry . "
159828	159832	159850	159850	she	2491	" Poor thing ! "
159841	159849	159850	159850	she	2491	" poor lonely lamb ! But come , "
159854	159862	160111	160111	They	3820	" come ; we must go home . "

161803	161829	161896	161896	She	3886	" I will try , ma'am , some time ; but it is so comfortable to do as one has always been accustomed to do . "
161830	161855	161896	161896	She	3886	" My dear , let me beg of you to put that book down . You are trying your eyes by the doubtful firelight . "

161964	162182	162617	162617	she	372	" new throned and glorious , suffice to make earth an Eden , life a poem , for Shirley . A still , deep , inborn delight glows in her young veins , unmingled , untroubled , not to be reached or ravished by human agency , because by no human agency bestowed - the pure gift of God to His creature , the free dower of Nature to her child . This joy gives her experience of a genii - life . Buoyant , by green steps , by glad hills , all verdure and light , she reaches a station scarcely lower than that whence angels looked down on the dreamer of Bethel , and her eye seeks , and her soul possesses , the vision of life as she wishes it . No , not as she wishes it ; she has not time to wish . The swift glory spreads out , sweeping and kindling , and multiplies its splendours faster than Thought can effect his combinations , faster than Aspiration can utter her longings . Shirley says nothing while the trance is upon her - she is quite mute ; but if Mrs. Pryor speaks to her now , she goes out quietly , and continues her walk upstairs in the dim gallery .
162630	162638	163152	163152	she	279	" How did she like her relatives ? "
163137	163151	163152	163152	she	279	" I never find Miss Ainley oppressed with despondency or lost in grief , "
163155	163439	163444	163444	she	3925	" yet her cottage is a still , dim little place , and she is without a bright hope or near friend in the world . I remember , though , she told me once she had tutored her thoughts to tend upwards to heaven . She allowed there was , and ever had been , little enjoyment in this world for her , and she looks , I suppose , to the bliss of the world to come . So do nuns , with their close cell , their iron lamp , their robe strait as a shroud , their bed narrow as a coffin . She says often she has no fear of death - no dread of the grave ; no more , doubtless , had St. Simeon Stylites , lifted up terrible on his wild column in the wilderness ; no more has the Hindu votary stretched on his couch of iron spikes . Both these having violated nature , their natural likings and antipathies are reversed ; they grow altogether morbid . I do fear death as yet , but I believe it is because I am young . Poor Miss Ainley would cling closer to life if life had more charms for her . God surely did not create us and cause us to live with the sole end of wishing always to die . I believe in my heart we were intended to prize life and enjoy it so long as we retain it . Existence never was originally meant to be that useless , blank , pale , slow - trailing thing it often becomes to many , and is becoming to me among the rest .
163440	163443	163444	163444	she	3925	" Nobody , "

I believe single women should have more to do - better chances of interesting and profitable occupation than they possess now . And when I speak thus I have no impression that I displease God by my words ; that I am either impious or impatient , irreligious or sacrilegious . My consolation is , indeed , that God hears many a groan , and compassionates much grief which man stops his ears against , or frowns on with impotent contempt . I say impotent , for I observe that to such grievances as society can not readily cure it usually forbids utterance , on pain of its scorn , this scorn being only a sort of tinselled cloak to its deformed weakness . People hate to be reminded of ills they are unable or unwilling to remedy . Such reminder , in forcing on them a sense of their own incapacity , or a more painful sense of an obligation to make some unpleasant effort , troubles their ease and shakes their self - complacency . Old maids , like the houseless and unemployed poor , should not ask for a place and an occupation in the world ; the demand disturbs the happy and rich - it disturbs parents . Look at the numerous families of girls in this neighbourhood - the Armitages , the Birtwhistles , the Sykeses . The brothers of these girls are every one in business or in professions ; they have something to do . Their sisters have no earthly employment but household work and sewing , no earthly pleasure but an unprofitable visiting , and no hope , in all their life to come , of anything better . This stagnant state of things makes them decline in health . They are never well , and their minds and views shrink to wondrous narrowness . The great wish , the sole aim of every one of them is to be married , but the majority will never marry ; they will die as they now live . They scheme , they plot , they dress to ensnare husbands . The gentlemen turn them into ridicule ; they do n't want them ; they hold them very cheap . They say - I have heard them say it with sneering laughs many a time - the matrimonial market is overstocked . Fathers say so likewise , and are angry with their daughters when they observe their manouvres - they order them to stay at home . What do they expect them to do at home ? If you ask , they would answer , sew and cook . They expect them to do this , and this only , contentedly , regularly , uncomplainingly , all their lives long , as if they had no germs of faculties for anything else - a doctrine as reasonable to hold as it would be that the fathers have no faculties but for eating what their daughters cook or for wearing what they sew . Could men live so themselves ? Would they not be very weary ? And when there came no relief to their weariness , but only reproaches at its slightest manifestation , would not their weariness ferment it time to frenzy ? Lucretia , spinning at midnight in the midst of her maidens , and Solomon 's virtuous woman are often quoted as patterns of what ' the sex , ' as they say , ought to be . I do n't know . Lucretia , I dare say , was a most worthy sort of person , much like my cousin Hortense Moore ; but she kept her servants up very late . I should not have liked to be amongst the number of the maidens . Hortense would just work me and Sarah in that fashion , if she could , and neither of us would bear it . The ' virtuous woman , ' again , had her household up in the very middle of the night ; she ' got breakfast over , ' as Mrs. Sykes says , before one o'clock a.m. ; but she had something more to do than spin and give out portions . She was a manufacturer - she made fine linen and sold it ; she was an agriculturist - she bought estates and planted vineyards . That woman was a manager . She was what the matrons hereabouts call ' a clever woman . ' On the whole , I like her a good deal better than Lucretia ; but I do n't believe either Mr. Armitage or Mr. Sykes could have got the advantage of her in a bargain . Yet I like her . ' Strength and honour were her clothing ; the heart of her husband safely trusted in her . She opened her mouth with wisdom ; in her tongue was the law of kindness ; her children rose up and called her blessed ; her husband also praised her . ' King of Israel ! your model of a woman is a worthy model ! But are we , in these days , brought up to be like her ? Men of Yorkshire ! do your daughters reach this royal standard ? Can they reach it ? Can you help them to reach it ? Can you give them a field in which their faculties may be exercised and grow ? Men of England ! look at your poor girls , many of them fading around you , dropping off in consumption or decline ; or , what is worse , degenerating to sour old maids - envious , back - biting , wretched , because life is a desert to them ; or , what is worst of all , reduced to strive , by scarce modest coquetry and debasing artifice , to gain that position and consideration by marriage which to celibacy is denied . Fathers ! can not you alter these things ? Perhaps not all at once ; but consider the matter well when it is brought before you , receive it as a theme worthy of thought ; do not dismiss it with an idle jest or an unmanly insult . You would wish to be proud of your daughters , and not to blush for them ; then seek for them an interest and an occupation which shall raise them above the flirt , the manouvrer , the mischief - making tale - bearer . Keep your girls ' minds narrow and fettered ; they will still be a plague and a care , sometimes a disgrace to you . Cultivate them - give them scope and work ; they will be your gayest companions in health , your tenderest nurses in sickness , your most faithful prop in age . "
164790	164794	164821	164821	she	301	" Miss Caroline ! "
164799	164802	164876	164876	Fanny	301	" Fanny ! "
164863	164874	164915	164915	she	5967	" Joe Scott 's son , Harry , brought it , "
164931	164939	164915	164915	she	5967	" Harry Scott ! who sent him ? "
164940	164947	165080	165080	she	239	" He came from the Hollow . "
165068	165076	165407	165407	she	477	" meilleure amie , Hortense Gérard Moore . "
165319	165365	165371	165371	her	239	" Robert may come home while you are in his house , and then , at least , you may look in his face - at least you may give him your hand ; perhaps , for a minute , you may sit beside him . "
165366	165369	165696	165696	she	477	" Silence ! "
165673	165690	165696	165696	she	477	" You would expect to find me alone , from what I said in my note , "
165703	165719	165935	165935	she	477	" but it was written this morning : since dinner , company has come in . "
165952	165954	166311	166312	the petitioner	3980	" gossips "
166300	166309	166311	166312	the petitioner	3980	" My mother is not civil to you , "
166323	166387	166404	166405	Mrs. Yorke	340	" and Rose there takes no notice of you ; it is their way . If , instead of you , a white angel , with a crown of stars , had come into the room , mother would nod stiffly , and Rose never lift her head at all ; but I will be your friend - I have always liked you . "
166388	166402	166419	166419	Jessie	342	" Jessie , curb that tongue of yours , and repress your forwardness ! "
166407	166417	166419	166419	Jessie	342	" But , mother , you are so frozen ! "
166421	166529	166546	166546	Rose	341	" Miss Helstone has never done you any harm ; why ca n't you be kind to her ? You sit so stiff , and look so cold , and speak so dry - what for ? That 's just the fashion in which you treat Miss Shirley Keeldar and every other young lady who comes to our house . And Rose there is such an aut - aut - I have forgotten the word , but it means a machine in the shape of a human being . However , between you , you will drive every soul away from Briarmains ; Martin often says so . "
166530	166544	166586	166586	she	341	" I am an automaton ? Good ! Let me alone , then , "
166576	166585	166714	166715	Mrs. Radcliffe	479	" Miss Helstone , how do you do ? "
166718	166722	166734	166734	Rose	341	" The Italian . "
166748	166753	166766	166767	Rose ere	341	" Are you ready ? "
166758	166764	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Do you like it ? "
166770	166789	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Long since , when I read it as a child , I was wonderfully taken with it . "
166790	166793	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Why ? "
166794	166814	166734	166734	Rose	341	" It seemed to open with such promise - such foreboding of a most strange tale to be unfolded . "
166815	166851	166734	166734	Rose	341	" And in reading it you feel as if you were far away from England - really in Italy - under another sort of sky - that blue sky of the south which travellers describe . "
166852	166861	166734	166734	Rose	341	" You are sensible of that , Rose ? "
166862	166873	166734	166734	Rose	341	" It makes me long to travel , Miss Helstone . "
166874	166892	166734	166734	Rose	341	" When you are a woman , perhaps , you may be able to gratify your wish . "
166893	166945	166734	166734	Rose	341	" I mean to make a way to do so , if one is not made for me . I can not live always in Briarfield . The whole world is not very large compared with creation . I must see the outside of our own round planet , at least . "
166946	166953	166734	166734	Rose	341	" How much of its outside ? "
166954	167002	166734	166734	Rose	341	" First this hemisphere where we live ; then the other . I am resolved that my life shall be a life . Not a black trance like the toad 's , buried in marble ; nor a long , slow death like yours in Briarfield rectory . "
167003	167014	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Like mine ! what can you mean , child ? "
167015	167085	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Might you not as well be tediously dying as for ever shut up in that glebe - house - a place that , when I pass it , always reminds me of a windowed grave ? I never see any movement about the door . I never hear a sound from the wall . I believe smoke never issues from the chimneys . What do you do there ? "
167086	167097	166734	166734	Rose	341	" I sew , I read , I learn lessons . "
167098	167103	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Are you happy ? "
167104	167120	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Should I be happy wandering alone in strange countries as you wish to do ? "
167121	167245	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Much happier , even if you did nothing but wander . Remember , however , that I shall have an object in view ; but if you only went on and on , like some enchanted lady in a fairy tale , you might be happier than now . In a day 's wandering you would pass many a hill , wood , and watercourse , each perpetually altering in aspect as the sun shone out or was overcast ; as the weather was wet or fair , dark or bright . Nothing changes in Briarfield rectory . The plaster of the parlour ceilings , the paper on the walls , the curtains , carpets , chairs , are still the same . "
167246	167253	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Is change necessary to happiness ? "
167254	167257	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Yes . "
167258	167265	166734	166734	Rose	341	" Is it synonymous with it ? "
167266	167284	167296	167296	she	342	" I do n't know ; but I feel monotony and death to be almost the same . "
167289	167295	167306	167306	Caroline	279	" Is n't she mad ? "
167299	167304	167306	167306	Caroline	279	" But , Rose , "
167308	167340	166734	166734	Rose	341	" I fear a wanderer 's life , for me at least , would end like that tale you are reading - in disappointment , vanity , and vexation of spirit . "
167341	167350	167306	167306	Caroline	279	" Does ' The Italian ' so end ? "
167351	167360	166734	166734	Rose	341	" I thought so when I read it . "
167361	167403	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Better to try all things and find all empty than to try nothing and leave your life a blank . To do this is to commit the sin of him who buried his talent in a napkin - despicable sluggard ! "
167404	167407	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Rose , "
167426	167426	167537	167537	she	340	"
167427	167536	167537	167537	she	340	" Right , mother ! And if my Master has given me ten talents , my duty is to trade with them , and make them ten talents more . Not in the dust of household drawers shall the coin be interred . I will not deposit it in a broken - spouted teapot , and shut it up in a china closet among tea - things . I will not commit it to your work - table to be smothered in piles of woollen hose . I will not prison it in the linen press to find shrouds among the sheets . And least of all , mother "
167544	167578	167579	167579	She	340	" least of all will I hide it in a tureen of cold potatoes , to be ranged with bread , butter , pastry , and ham on the shelves of the larder . "
167586	167674	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Mother , the Lord who gave each of us our talents will come home some day , and will demand from all an account . The teapot , the old stocking - foot , the linen rag , the willow - pattern tureen will yield up their barren deposit in many a house . Suffer your daughters , at least , to put their money to the exchangers , that they may be enabled at the Master 's coming to pay Him His own with usury . "
167675	167691	167579	167579	She	340	" Rose , did you bring your sampler with you , as I told you ? "
167692	167697	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Yes , mother . "
167698	167709	167729	167730	her mother	5452	" Sit down , and do a line of marking . "
167733	167744	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Do you think yourself oppressed now - a victim ? "
167745	167750	167729	167730	her mother	5452	" No , mother . "
167751	167773	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Yet , as far as I understood your tirade , it was a protest against all womanly and domestic employment . "
167774	167804	167729	167730	her mother	5452	" You misunderstood it , mother . I should be sorry not to learn to sew . You do right to teach me , and to make me work . "
167805	167821	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Even to the mending of your brothers ' stockings and the making of sheets ? "
167822	167825	167729	167730	her mother	5452	" Yes . "
167826	167840	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Where is the use of ranting and spouting about it , then ? "
167841	167909	167923	167924	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Am I to do nothing but that ? I will do that , and then I will do more . Now , mother , I have said my say . I am twelve years old at present , and not till I am sixteen will I speak again about talents . For four years I bind myself an industrious apprentice to all you can teach me . "
167910	167921	167923	167924	Mrs. Yorke	340	" You see what my daughters are , Miss Helstone , "
167926	167970	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" how precociously wise in their own conceits ! ' I would rather this , I prefer that ' - such is Jessie 's cuckoo song ; while Rose utters the bolder cry , ' I will , and I will not ! ' "
167971	168033	168044	168045	Mrs. Yorke	340	" I render a reason , mother ; besides , if my cry is bold , it is only heard once in a twelvemonth . About each birthday the spirit moves me to deliver one oracle respecting my own instruction and management . I utter it and leave it ; it is for you , mother , to listen or not . "
168034	168042	168044	168045	Mrs. Yorke	340	" I would advise all young ladies , "
168047	168101	168116	168116	Caroline	279	" to study the characters of such children as they chance to meet with before they marry and have any of their own to consider well how they would like the responsibility of guiding the careless , the labour of persuading the stubborn , the constant burden and task of training the best . "
168102	168114	168116	168116	Caroline	279	" But with love it need not be so very difficult , "
168118	168133	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" Mothers love their children most dearly - almost better than they love themselves . "
168134	168159	168116	168116	Caroline	279	" Fine talk ! very sentimental ! There is the rough , practical part of life yet to come for you , young miss . "
168160	168230	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" But , Mrs. Yorke , if I take a little baby into my arms - any poor woman 's infant , for instance - I feel that I love that helpless thing quite peculiarly , though I am not its mother . I could do almost anything for it willingly , if it were delivered over entirely to my care - if it were quite dependent on me . "
168231	168318	168116	168116	Caroline	279	" You feel ! Yes , yes ! I dare say , now . You are led a great deal by your feelings , and you think yourself a very sensitive personage , no doubt . Are you aware that , with all these romantic ideas , you have managed to train your features into an habitually lackadaisical expression , better suited to a novel - heroine than to a woman who is to make her way in the real world by dint of common sense ? "
168319	168334	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" No ; I am not at all aware of that , Mrs. Yorke . "
168335	168363	168116	168116	Caroline	279	" Look in the glass just behind you . Compare the face you see there with that of any early - rising , hard - working milkmaid . "
168364	168448	167409	167410	Mrs. Yorke	340	" My face is a pale one , but it is not sentimental ; and most milkmaids , however red and robust they may be , are more stupid and less practically fitted to make their way in the world than I am . I think more , and more correctly , than milkmaids in general do ; consequently , where they would often , for want of reflection , act weakly , I , by dint of reflection , should act judiciously . "
168449	168468	168116	168116	Caroline	279	" Oh no ! you would be influenced by your feelings ; you would be guided by impulse . "
168469	168543	168594	168596	the ungenial matron	3986	" Of course I should often be influenced by my feelings . They were given me to that end . Whom my feelings teach me to love I must and shall love ; and I hope , if ever I have a husband and children , my feelings will induce me to love them . I hope , in that case , all my impulses will be strong in compelling me to love . "
168600	168660	168723	168723	she	340	" Do n't waste your dramatic effects . That was well said - it was quite fine ; but it is lost on two women - an old wife and an old maid . There should have been a disengaged gentleman present . - Is Mr. Robert nowhere hid behind the curtains , do you think , Miss Moore ? "
168716	168721	168723	168723	she	340	" Straightforward Miss Moore ! "
168726	168776	168816	168816	she	239	" It is like you to understand my question so literally and answer it so simply . Your mind comprehends nothing of intrigue . Strange things might go on around you without your being the wiser ; you are not of the class the world calls sharp - witted . "
168802	168815	168850	168851	Mrs. Yorke	340	" I have ever been noted for sagacity and discernment from childhood , "
168834	168848	168850	168851	Mrs. Yorke	340	" You never plotted to win a husband , I 'll be bound , "
168853	168872	169035	169035	She	3990	" and you have not the benefit of previous experience to aid you in discovering when others plot . "
169054	169060	169065	169065	she	3990	" mother of the herd . "
169071	169140	169065	169065	she	3990	" Your cousin Hortense is an excellent sister , Miss Helstone . Such ladies as come to try their life 's luck here at Hollow 's Cottage may , by a very little clever female artifice , cajole the mistress of the house , and have the game all in their own hands . You are fond of your cousin 's society , I dare say , miss ? "
169141	169147	169065	169065	she	3990	" Of which cousin 's ? "
169148	169159	169065	169065	she	3990	" Oh , of the lady 's , of course . "
169160	169174	169065	169065	she	3990	" Hortense is , and always has been , most kind to me . "
169175	169192	169199	169199	Caroline	279	" Every sister with an eligible single brother is considered most kind by her spinster friends . "
169193	169197	169065	169065	she	3990	" Mrs. Yorke , "
169240	169251	169065	169065	she	3990	" Mrs. Yorke , may I ask what you mean ? "
169252	169273	169065	169065	she	3990	" To give you a lesson on the cultivation of rectitude , to disgust you with craft and false sentiment . "
169274	169281	169065	169065	she	3990	" Do I need this lesson ? "
169282	169374	169065	169065	she	3990	" Most young ladies of the present day need it . You are quite a modern young lady - morbid , delicate , professing to like retirement ; which implies , I suppose , that you find little worthy of your sympathies in the ordinary world . The ordinary world - every - day honest folks - are better than you think them , much better than any bookish , romancing chit of a girl can be who hardly ever puts her nose over her uncle the parson 's garden wall . "
169375	169597	169709	169709	she	3995	" Consequently of whom you know nothing . Excuse me - indeed , it does not matter whether you excuse me or not - you have attacked me without provocation ; I shall defend myself without apology . Of my relations with my two cousins you are ignorant . In a fit of ill - humour you have attempted to poison them by gratuitous insinuations , which are far more crafty and false than anything with which you can justly charge me . That I happen to be pale , and sometimes to look diffident , is no business of yours ; that I am fond of books , and indisposed for common gossip , is still less your business ; that I am a ' romancing chit of a girl ' is a mere conjecture on your part . I never romanced to you nor to anybody you know . That I am the parson 's niece is not a crime , though you may be narrow - minded enough to think it so . You dislike me . You have no just reason for disliking me ; therefore keep the expression of your aversion to yourself . If at any time in future you evince it annoyingly , I shall answer even less scrupulously than I have done now . "
169686	169708	169709	169709	she	3995	" She has spirit in her , after all . - Always speak as honestly as you have done just now , "
169712	169718	169678	169678	she	3995	" and you 'll do . "
169719	169727	169709	169709	she	3995	" I repel a recommendation so offensive , "
169745	169809	169821	169822	little Jessie	342	" I reject counsel poisoned by insinuation . It is my right to speak as I think proper ; nothing binds me to converse as you dictate . So far from always speaking as I have done just now , I shall never address any one in a tone so stern or in language so harsh , unless in answer to unprovoked insult . "
169810	169819	169842	169842	She	341	" Mother , you have found your match , "
169846	169908	169930	169930	her	340	" No ; Miss Helstone is not my mother 's match , for she allows herself to be vexed . My mother would wear her out in a few weeks . Shirley Keeldar manages better . - Mother , you have never hurt Miss Keeldar 's feelings yet . She wears armour under her silk dress that you can not penetrate . "
169936	169960	170338	170338	She	342	" she could gain no command over them . A look from their father had more influence with them than a lecture from her .
170351	170355	170507	170512	the fat " Adonis of fifty	8604	" hired butcher . "
170509	170513	171156	171156	Caroline	279	" Adonis of fifty "
171149	171154	171177	171177	she	279	" So must I , "
171165	171176	171177	171177	she	279	" This is all folly - heart - breaking folly , "
171180	171346	171483	171483	she	4039	" In the first place , though I should stay till dark there will be no arrival ; because I feel in my heart , Fate has written it down in to - day 's page of her eternal book , that I am not to have the pleasure I long for . In the second place , if he stepped in this moment , my presence here would be a chagrin to him , and the consciousness that it must be so would turn half my blood to ice . His hand would , perhaps , be loose and chill if I put mine into it ; his eye would be clouded if I sought its beam . I should look up for that kindling , something I have seen in past days , when my face , or my language , or my disposition had at some happy moment pleased him ; I should discover only darkness . I had better go home . "
171466	171482	171483	171483	she	4039	" But they say she actually will not let Mr. Sympson and his family go , "
171486	171546	171557	171557	Caroline	279	" They wanted much to return to the south last week , to be ready for the reception of the only son , who is expected home from a tour . She insists that her cousin Henry shall come and join his friends here in Yorkshire . I dare say she partly does it to oblige Robert and myself . "
171547	171555	171557	171557	Caroline	279	" How to oblige Robert and you ? "
171559	171581	171589	171589	Sarah	232	" Why , my child , you are dull . Do n't you know - you must often have heard - - "
171582	171587	171589	171589	Sarah	232	" Please , ma'am , "
171595	171622	171557	171557	Caroline	279	" the preserves that you told me to boil in treacle - the congfiters , as you call them - is all burnt to the pan . "
171623	171644	171768	171768	She	274	" Les confitures ! Elles sont brulées ? Ah , quelle négligence coupable ! Coquine de cuisiniere , fille insupportable ! "
171760	171763	171914	171914	He	4055	" mélasse , "
171904	171913	172053	172054	Another person	4060	" Was it - was it - Robert ? "
171961	171971	171979	171979	he	218	" Now , I thowt I heerd a crack ? "
171975	171978	171979	171979	he	218	" And , "
171983	172052	172053	172054	Another person	4060	" as t ' maister 's comed , and as he 'll enter through this hoyle , I con sidered it desirable to step in and let ye know . A household o ' women is nivver fit to be comed on wi'out warning . Here he is . - Walk forrard , sir . They war playing up queerly , but I think I 've quietened 'em . "
172070	172150	172249	172249	Robert	481	" What d'ye mean by being all i ' darkness ? Sarah , thou quean , canst t ' not light a candle ? It war sundown an hour syne . He 'll brak his shins agean some o ' yer pots , and tables , and stuff . - Tak tent o ' this baking - bowl , sir ; they 've set it i ' yer way , fair as if they did it i ' malice . "
172209	172224	172249	172249	Robert	481	" Mon Dieu ! mon Dieu ! Est - ce que je m'y attendais ? "
172233	172244	172347	172347	Hortense	239	" Et tu te portes toujours bien , bonne sour ? "
172340	172345	172347	172347	Hortense	239	" Caroline ! Caroline ! "
172353	172359	172365	172366	Miss Helstone	279	" venez voir mon frere ! "
172360	172363	172365	172366	Miss Helstone	279	" Strange , "
172368	172410	172549	172549	Caroline	279	" passing strange ! What does this unwonted excitement about such an every - day occurrence as a return from market portend ? She has not lost her senses , has she ? Surely the burnt treacle has not crazed her ? "
172541	172547	172549	172549	Caroline	279	" What is the matter ? "
172551	172562	172572	172572	Hortense	239	" Is my sight wrong ? Is it my cousin ? "
172563	172570	172614	172614	he	481	" Certainly it is your cousin , "
172609	172612	172614	172614	he	481	" Well , "
172624	172629	172597	172597	Robert	481	" which is which ? "
172630	172637	172642	172642	He	481	" Ah , this is you ! "
172645	172673	172674	172674	She	279	" I believe it is me . And do you know who he is ? You never saw him before , but you have heard of him . "
172681	172705	172614	172614	he	481	" It can be only one person - your brother , since it is so like you ; my other cousin , Louis . "
172706	172748	172674	172674	She	279	" Clever little Odipus ! you would have baffled the Sphinx ! But now , see us together . - Change places ; change again , to confuse her , Louis . - Which is the old love now , Lina ? "
172749	172795	172808	172809	the newcomer	4071	" As if it were possible to make a mistake when you speak ! You should have told Hortense to ask . But you are not so much alike . It is only your height , your figure , and complexion that are so similar . "
172796	172806	173132	173132	she	279	" And I am Robert , am I not ? "
173123	173131	173132	173132	she	279	" How could I think them alike ? "
173136	173149	173578	173578	she	489	" I see now it is Hortense Louis resembles , not Robert . "
173571	173577	173578	173578	she	489	" They came from Fieldhead , "
173581	173607	173646	173646	Louis	489	" intended as a gift to you , no doubt . We know who is the favourite there ; not I , I 'm sure . "
173630	173644	173654	173654	Hortense	489	" We are to understand , then , that Robert is the favourite ? "
173648	173652	173654	173654	Hortense	489	" Mon cher , "
173656	173672	173703	173703	Caroline	279	" Robert - c'est tout ce qu'il y a de plus précieux au monde ; a c"té
173695	173702	173703	173703	Caroline	279	" she added , appealing to Caroline .
173709	173712	173734	173734	Louis	489	" Yes , "
173726	173732	173754	173754	he	4087	" Et toi , Robert ? "
173736	173747	174007	174007	she	279	" When you shall have an opportunity , ask herself , "
174001	174006	174018	174018	Her	279	" Am I ill ? "
174037	174048	174422	174422	she	279	" I look well ; why can I not eat ? "
174425	174480	174422	174422	she	279	" I have sent Fanny to Fieldhead to fetch a few things for me , such as I shall want during a short stay here . It is my wish to remain with you till you are better . Your uncle kindly permits my attendance . Will it to yourself be acceptable , Caroline ? "
174481	174546	174578	174578	Caroline	279	" I am sorry you should take such needless trouble . I do not feel very ill , but I can not refuse resolutely . It will be such comfort to know you are in the house , to see you sometimes in the room ; but do n't confine yourself on my account , dear Mrs. Pryor . Fanny nurses me very well . "
174589	174602	174573	174573	she	4110	" Are you free from pain ? Are you tolerably at ease ? "
174623	174631	174644	174644	She	4110	" I think I am almost happy . "
174632	174643	174644	174644	She	4110	" You wish to drink ? Your lips are parched . "
174657	174668	174644	174644	She	4110	" Have you eaten anything to - day , Caroline ? "
174669	174675	174644	174644	She	4110	" I can not eat . "
174676	174697	174759	174759	Caroline	279	" But soon your appetite will return ; it must return - that is , I pray God it may . "
174741	174757	174799	174799	she	375	" I shall hardly wish to get well , that I may keep you always , "
174787	174798	174799	174799	she	375	" You are more used to Fanny than to me , "
174804	174816	174887	174887	she	375	" I should think my attendance must seem strange , officious ? "
174817	174860	174799	174799	she	375	" No ; quite natural , and very soothing . You must have been accustomed to wait on sick people , ma'am . You move about the room so softly , and you speak so quietly , and touch me so gently . "
174861	174882	175371	175371	she	340	" I am dexterous in nothing , my dear . You will often find me awkward , but never negligent . "
175399	175404	175825	175825	Caroline	279	" rich and idle , "
175816	175823	176165	176165	she	279	" May I lie down again ? "
176168	176207	176378	176378	she	279	" Do n't take it from me , Robert ! Do n't ! It is my last comfort ; let me keep it . I never tell any one whose hair it is ; I never show it . "
176356	176377	176378	176378	she	279	" Oh , I should see him once more before all is over ! Heaven might favour me thus far ! "
176381	176392	176783	176783	She	4151	" God grant me a little comfort before I die ! "
176398	176432	176783	176783	She	4151	" But he will not know I am ill till I am gone , and he will come when they have laid me out , and I am senseless , cold , and stiff .
176433	176495	176783	176783	She	4151	" What can my departed soul feel then ? Can it see or know what happens to the clay ? Can spirits , through any medium , communicate with living flesh ? Can the dead at all revisit those they leave ? Can they come in the elements ? Will wind , water , fire , lend me a path to Moore ?
176496	176543	176783	176783	She	4151	" Is it for nothing the wind sounds almost articulately sometimes - sings as I have lately heard it sing at night - or passes the casement sobbing , as if for sorrow to come ? Does nothing , then , haunt it , nothing inspire it ?
176544	176586	176783	176783	She	4151	" Why , it suggested to me words one night ; it poured a strain which I could have written down , only I was appalled , and dared not rise to seek pencil and paper by the dim watch - light .
176587	176663	176783	176783	She	4151	" What is that electricity they speak of , whose changes make us well or ill , whose lack or excess blasts , whose even balance revives ? What are all those influences that are about us in the atmosphere , that keep playing over our nerves like fingers on stringed instruments , and call forth now a sweet note , and now a wail - now an exultant swell , and anon the saddest cadence ?
176664	176782	176934	176935	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Where is the other world ? In what will another life consist ? Why do I ask ? Have I not cause to think that the hour is hasting but too fast when the veil must be rent for me ? Do I not know the Grand Mystery is likely to burst prematurely on me ? Great Spirit , in whose goodness I confide , whom , as my Father , I have petitioned night and morning from early infancy , help the weak creation of Thy hands ! Sustain me through the ordeal I dread and must undergo ! Give me strength ! Give me patience ! Give me - oh , give me FAITH ! "
176926	176932	176934	176935	Mrs. Pryor	375	" How is Mr. Robert ? "
176945	176954	176934	176935	Mrs. Pryor	375	" He was very well when he left . "
176955	176964	177039	177040	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Left ! Is he gone from home ? "
177003	177015	177039	177040	Mrs. Pryor	375	" He is not aware that Miss Helstone is very ill ? "
177016	177034	177110	177110	she	4115	" Oh no ! He thought , like me , that she had only a bad cold . "
177097	177109	177110	177110	she	4115	" I smelt the honeysuckles in the glen this summer morning , "
177113	177124	177170	177171	Mrs. Pryor	375	" as I stood at the counting - house window . "
177159	177168	177170	177171	Mrs. Pryor	375	" My darling , do you know me ? "
177173	177211	177224	177225	the nurse	4117	" I went in to call Robert to breakfast . I have been with him in the garden . He asked me to go . A heavy dew has refreshed the flowers . The peaches are ripening . "
177212	177219	177224	177225	the nurse	4117	" My darling ! my darling ! "
177227	177248	177224	177225	the nurse	4117	" I thought it was daylight - long after sunrise . It looks dark . Is the moon now set ? "
177274	177300	177224	177225	the nurse	4117	" Then it is not morning ? I am not at the cottage ? Who is this ? I see a shape at my bedside . "
177301	177327	177224	177225	the nurse	4117	" It is myself - it is your friend - your nurse - your - - Lean your head on my shoulder . Collect yourself . "
177333	177356	177390	177390	Caroline	279	" O God , take pity ! Give her life , and me strength ! Send me courage ! Teach me words ! "
177382	177388	177390	177390	Caroline	279	" I am better now , "
177394	177443	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" much better . I feel where I am . This is Mrs. Pryor near me . I was dreaming . I talk when I wake up from dreams ; people often do in illness . How fast your heart beats , ma'am ! Do not be afraid . "
177444	177518	177390	177390	Caroline	279	" It is not fear , child - only a little anxiety , which will pass . I have brought you some tea , Cary . Your uncle made it himself . You know he says he can make a better cup of tea than any housewife can . Taste it . He is concerned to hear that you eat so little ; he would be glad if you had a better appetite . "
177519	177528	177542	177542	she	4166	" I am thirsty . Let me drink . "
177533	177541	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" What o'clock is it , ma'am ? "
177545	177549	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Past nine . "
177550	177578	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Not later ? Oh ! I have yet a long night before me . But the tea has made me strong . I will sit up . "
177589	177636	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Thank Heaven ! I am not always equally miserable , and ill , and hopeless . The afternoon has been bad since Hortense went ; perhaps the evening may be better . It is a fine night , I think ? The moon shines clear . "
177637	177657	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Very fine - a perfect summer night . The old church - tower gleams white almost as silver . "
177658	177666	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" And does the churchyard look peaceful ? "
177667	177681	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Yes , and the garden also . Dew glistens on the foliage . "
177682	177703	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Can you see many long weeds and nettles amongst the graves ? or do they look turfy and flowery ? "
177704	177735	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I see closed daisy - heads gleaming like pearls on some mounds . Thomas has mown down the dock - leaves and rank grass , and cleared all away . "
177736	177822	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" I always like that to be done ; it soothes one 's mind to see the place in order . And , I dare say , within the church just now that moonlight shines as softly as in my room . It will fall through the east window full on the Helstone monument . When I close my eyes I seem to see poor papa 's epitaph in black letters on the white marble . There is plenty of room for other inscriptions underneath . "
177823	177866	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" William Farren came to look after your flowers this morning . He was afraid , now you can not tend them yourself , they would be neglected . He has taken two of your favourite plants home to nurse for you . "
177867	177908	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" If I were to make a will , I would leave William all my plants ; Shirley my trinkets - except one , which must not be taken off my neck ; and you , ma'am , my books . "
177913	177925	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" Mrs. Pryor , I feel a longing wish for something . "
177926	177932	177579	177580	Mrs. Pryor	375	" For what , Caroline ? "
177933	177957	177991	177992	Mrs. Pryor	375	" You know I always delight to hear you sing . Sing me a hymn just now . Sing that hymn which begins , -
177990	177990	178204	178204	He	4173	"
178219	178251	178204	178204	He	4173	" Thy word commands our flesh to dust , - ' Return , ye sons of men ; ' All nations rose from earth at first , And turn to earth again .
178252	178277	178204	178204	He	4173	" A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone - Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun .
178278	178307	178204	178204	He	4173	" Time , like an ever - rolling stream , Bears all its sons away ; They fly , forgotten , as a dream Dies at the opening day .
178308	178336	178204	178204	He	4173	" Like flowery fields , the nations stand , Fresh in the morning light ; The flowers beneath the mower 's hand Lie withering ere ' tis night .
178337	178369	178382	178382	Caroline	279	" Our God , our help in ages past , Our hope for years to come , Be Thou our guard while troubles last - O Father , be our home ! "
178370	178380	178382	178382	Caroline	279	" Now sing a song - a Scottish song , "
178390	178402	178457	178457	Caroline	279	" ' Ye banks and braes o ' bonnie Doon . ' "
178435	178455	178502	178504	the young girl	4181	" You are weeping at the pathos of the air . Come here , and I will comfort you , "
178489	178500	178515	178515	she	279	" You often soothe me ; let me soothe you , "
178510	178514	178515	178515	she	279	" I hope , "
178518	178527	178468	178468	She	375	" it is not for me you weep ? "
178532	178552	178502	178504	the young girl	4181	" Do you think I shall not get better ? I do not feel very ill - only weak . "
178553	178584	178468	178468	She	375	" But your mind , Caroline - your mind is crushed . Your heart is almost broken ; you have been so neglected , so repulsed , left so desolate . "
178585	178617	178502	178504	the young girl	4181	" I believe grief is , and always has been , my worst ailment . I sometimes think if an abundant gush of happiness came on me I could revive yet . "
178618	178625	178468	178468	She	375	" Do you wish to live ? "
178626	178634	178502	178504	the young girl	4181	" I have no object in life . "
178635	178642	178468	178468	She	375	" You love me , Caroline ? "
178643	178667	178682	178682	she	375	" Very much - very truly - inexpressibly sometimes . Just now I feel as if I could almost grow to your heart . "
178668	178676	178748	178748	she	375	" I will return directly , dear , "
178738	178746	178748	178748	she	375	" Then , if you love me , "
178758	178826	179327	179327	She	4182	" if you feel as if , to use your own words , you could ' grow to my heart , ' it will be neither shock nor pain for you to know that that heart is the source whence yours was filled ; that from my veins issued the tide which flows in yours ; that you are mine - my daughter - my own child . "
178827	178832	178748	178748	she	375	" Mrs. Pryor - - "
178833	178838	179327	179327	She	4182	" My own child ! "
178839	178851	178748	178748	she	375	" That is - that means - you have adopted me ? "
178852	178899	179327	179327	She	4182	" It means that , if I have given you nothing else , I at least gave you life ; that I bore you , nursed you ; that I am your true mother . No other woman can claim the title ; it is mine . "
178900	178927	178748	178748	she	375	" But Mrs. James Helstone - but my father 's wife , whom I do not remember ever to have seen , she is my mother ? "
178928	179102	179327	179327	She	4182	" She is your mother . James Helstone was my husband . I say you are mine . I have proved it . I thought perhaps you were all his , which would have been a cruel dispensation for me . I find it is not so . God permitted me to be the parent of my child 's mind . It belongs to me ; it is my property - my right . These features are James 's own . He had a fine face when he was young , and not altered by error . Papa , my darling , gave you your blue eyes and soft brown hair ; he gave you the oval of your face and the regularity of your lineaments - the outside he conferred ; but the heart and the brain are mine . The germs are from me , and they are improved , they are developed to excellence . I esteem and approve my child as highly as I do most fondly love her . "
179103	179115	178748	178748	she	375	" Is what I hear true ? Is it no dream ? "
179116	179136	179327	179327	She	4182	" I wish it were as true that the substance and colour of health were restored to your cheek . "
179137	179172	178748	178748	she	375	" My own mother ! is she one I can be so fond of as I can of you ? People generally did not like her - so I have been given to understand . "
179173	179221	179327	179327	She	4182	" They told you that ? Well , your mother now tells you that , not having the gift to please people generally , for their approbation she does not care . Her thoughts are centred in her child . Does that child welcome or reject her ? "
179222	179250	179327	179327	She	4182	" But if you are my mother , the world is all changed to me . Surely I can live . I should like to recover - - "
179251	179326	179341	179341	she	4182	" You must recover . You drew life and strength from my breast when you were a tiny , fair infant , over whose blue eyes I used to weep , fearing I beheld in your very beauty the sign of qualities that had entered my heart like iron , and pierced through my soul like a sword . Daughter ! we have been long parted ; I return now to cherish you again . "
179355	179363	179394	179394	she	4182	" My mother - my own mother ! "
179418	179424	179394	179394	she	4182	" Does my uncle know ? "
179425	179443	179394	179394	she	4182	" Your uncle knows . I told him when I first came to stay with you here . "
179444	179456	179394	179394	she	4182	" Did you recognize me when we first met at Fieldhead ? "
179457	179479	179394	179394	she	4182	" How could it be otherwise ? Mr. and Miss Helstone being announced , I was prepared to see my child . "
179480	179496	179394	179394	she	4182	" It was that , then , which moved you . I saw you disturbed . "
179497	179554	179394	179394	she	4182	" You saw nothing , Caroline ; I can cover my feelings . You can never tell what an age of strange sensation I lived , during the two minutes that elapsed between the report of your name and your entrance . You can never tell how your look , mien , carriage , shook me . "
179555	179562	179394	179394	she	4182	" Why ? Were you disappointed ? "
179563	179589	179394	179394	she	4182	" What will she be like ? I had asked myself ; and when I saw what you were like , I could have dropped . "
179590	179595	179394	179394	she	4182	" Mamma , why ? "
179596	179618	179394	179394	she	4182	" I trembled in your presence . I said , I will never own her ; she shall never know me . "
179619	179646	179394	179394	she	4182	" But I said and did nothing remarkable . I felt a little diffident at the thought of an introduction to strangers - that was all . "
179647	179679	179394	179394	she	4182	" I soon saw you were diffident . That was the first thing which reassured me . Had you been rustic , clownish , awkward , I should have been content . "
179680	179685	179394	179394	she	4182	" You puzzle me . "
179686	179825	179394	179394	she	4182	" I had reason to dread a fair outside , to mistrust a popular bearing , to shudder before distinction , grace , and courtesy . Beauty and affability had come in my way when I was recluse , desolate , young , and ignorant - a toil - worn governess perishing of uncheered labour , breaking down before her time . These , Caroline , when they smiled on me , I mistook for angels . I followed them home ; and when into their hands I had given without reserve my whole chance of future happiness , it was my lot to witness a transfiguration on the domestic hearth - to see the white mask lifted , the bright disguise put away , and opposite me sat down - - O God , I have suffered ! "
179832	179854	179394	179394	she	4182	" I have suffered ! None saw - none knew . There was no sympathy , no redemption , no redress ! "
179855	179866	179394	179394	she	4182	" Take comfort , mother . It is over now . "
179867	179948	179950	179950	she	4189	" It is over , and not fruitlessly . I tried to keep the word of His patience . He kept me in the days of my anguish . I was afraid with terror - I was troubled . Through great tribulation He brought me through to a salvation revealed in this last time . My fear had torment ; He has cast it out . He has given me in its stead perfect love . But , Caroline - - "
179958	179961	180180	180180	mother	6200	" Mother ! "
179962	180179	180180	180180	mother	6200	" I charge you , when you next look on your father 's monument , to respect the name chiselled there . To you he did only good . On you he conferred his whole treasure of beauties , nor added to them one dark defect . All you derived from him is excellent . You owe him gratitude . Leave , between him and me , the settlement of our mutual account . Meddle not . God is the arbiter . This world 's laws never came near us - never ! They were powerless as a rotten bulrush to protect me - impotent as idiot babblings to restrain him ! As you said , it is all over now ; the grave lies between us . There he sleeps , in that church . To his dust I say this night , what I have never said before , ' James , slumber peacefully ! See ! your terrible debt is cancelled ! Look ! I wipe out the long , black account with my own hand ! James , your child atones . This living likeness of you - this thing with your perfect features - this one good gift you gave me has nestled affectionately to my heart , and tenderly called me "
180182	180189	180180	180180	mother	6200	" Husband , rest forgiven ! ' "
180190	180216	180180	180180	mother	6200	" Dearest mother , that is right ! Can papa 's spirit hear us ? Is he comforted to know that we still love him ? "
180217	180261	180180	180180	mother	6200	" I said nothing of love . I spoke of forgiveness . Mind the truth , child ; I said nothing of love ! On the threshold of eternity , should he be there to see me enter , will I maintain that . "
180262	180271	180180	180180	mother	6200	" O mother , you must have suffered ! "
180272	180319	180180	180180	mother	6200	" O child , the human heart can suffer ! It can hold more tears than the ocean holds waters . We never know how deep , how wide it is , till misery begins to unbind her clouds , and fill it with rushing blackness . "
180320	180325	180330	180330	she	4192	" Mother , forget . "
180326	180329	180330	180330	she	4192	" Forget ! "
180341	180367	180388	180389	the parent	4186	" The north pole will rush to the south , and the headlands of Europe be locked into the bays of Australia ere I forget . "
180368	180379	180426	180426	she	375	" Hush , mother ! Rest ! Be at peace ! "
180457	180519	180596	180596	she	4199	" Mamma , let them bring a candle , that I may see you ; and tell my uncle to come into this room by - and - by . I want to hear him say that I am your daughter . And , mamma , take your supper here . Do n't leave me for one minute to - night . "
180520	180595	180596	180596	she	4199	" O Caroline , it is well you are gentle ! You will say to me , Go , and I shall go ; Come , and I shall come ; Do this , and I shall do it . You inherit a certain manner as well as certain features . It will always be ' mamma ' prefacing a mandate - softly spoken , though , from you , thank God ! Well , "
180603	180644	180600	180600	her	4199	" he spoke softly too , once , like a flute breathing tenderness ; and then , when the world was not by to listen , discords that split the nerves and curdled the blood - sounds to inspire insanity . "
180645	180693	180600	180600	her	4199	" It seems so natural , mamma , to ask you for this and that . I shall want nobody but you to be near me , or to do anything for me . But do not let me be troublesome . Check me if I encroach . "
180694	180792	180600	180600	her	4199	" You must not depend on me to check you ; you must keep guard over yourself . I have little moral courage ; the want of it is my bane . It is that which has made me an unnatural parent - which has kept me apart from my child during the ten years which have elapsed since my husband 's death left me at liberty to claim her . It was that which first unnerved my arms and permitted the infant I might have retained a while longer to be snatched prematurely from their embrace . "
180793	180798	180600	180600	her	4199	" How , mamma ? "
180799	181079	180600	180600	her	4199	" I let you go as a babe , because you were pretty , and I feared your loveliness , deeming it the stamp of perversity . They sent me your portrait , taken at eight years old ; that portrait confirmed my fears . Had it shown me a sunburnt little rustic - a heavy , blunt - featured , commonplace child - I should have hastened to claim you ; but there , under the silver paper , I saw blooming the delicacy of an aristocratic flower - ' little lady ' was written on every trait . I had too recently crawled from under the yoke of the fine gentleman - escaped galled , crushed , paralyzed , dying - to dare to encounter his still finer and most fairy - like representative . My sweet little lady overwhelmed me with dismay ; her air of native elegance froze my very marrow . In my experience I had not met with truth , modesty , good principle as the concomitants of beauty . A form so straight and fine , I argued , must conceal a mind warped and cruel . I had little faith in the power of education to rectify such a mind ; or rather , I entirely misdoubted my own ability to influence it . Caroline , I dared not undertake to rear you . I resolved to leave you in your uncle 's hands . Matthewson Helstone I knew , if an austere , was an upright man . He and all the world thought hardly of me for my strange , unmotherly resolve , and I deserved to be misjudged . "
181080	181091	180600	180600	her	4199	" Mamma , why did you call yourself Mrs. Pryor ? "
181092	181236	180600	180600	her	4199	" It was a name in my mother 's family . I adopted it that I might live unmolested . My married name recalled too vividly my married life ; I could not bear it . Besides , threats were uttered of forcing me to return to bondage . It could not be . Rather a bier for a bed , the grave for a home . My new name sheltered me . I resumed under its screen my old occupation of teaching . At first it scarcely procured me the means of sustaining life ; but how savoury was hunger when I fasted in peace ! How safe seemed the darkness and chill of an unkindled hearth when no lurid reflection from terror crimsoned its desolation ! How serene was solitude , when I feared not the irruption of violence and vice ! "
181237	181267	180600	180600	her	4199	" But , mamma , you have been in this neighbourhood before . How did it happen that when you reappeared here with Miss Keeldar you were not recognized ? "
181268	181369	180600	180600	her	4199	" I only paid a short visit , as a bride , twenty years ago , and then I was very different to what I am now - slender , almost as slender as my daughter is at this day . My complexion , my very features are changed ; my hair , my style of dress - everything is altered . You can not fancy me a slim young person , attired in scanty drapery of white muslin , with bare arms , bracelets and necklace of beads , and hair disposed in round Grecian curls above my forehead ? "
181370	181424	181459	181459	he	932	" You must , indeed , have been different . Mamma , I heard the front door open . If it is my uncle coming in , just ask him to step upstairs , and let me hear his assurance that I am truly awake and collected , and not dreaming or delirious . "
181449	181458	180600	180600	her	4199	" She 's not worse , I hope ? "
181463	181479	181485	181485	he	932	" I think her better . She is disposed to converse ; she seems stronger . "
181480	181483	181485	181485	he	932	" Good ! "
181494	181522	181562	181564	The respected ecclesiastic	4204	" Ha , Cary ! how do ? Did you drink my cup of tea ? I made it for you just as I like it myself . "
181523	181561	181625	181625	he	932	" I drank it every drop , uncle . It did me good ; it has made me quite alive . I have a wish for company , so I begged Mrs. Pryor to call you in . "
181615	181624	181625	181625	he	932	" You 'll be up in a trice , "
181634	181697	181612	181612	he	932	" The little weakness will soon pass off ; and then you must drink port wine - a pipe , if you can - and eat game and oysters . I 'll get them for you , if they are to be had anywhere . Bless me ! we 'll make you as strong as Samson before we 're done with you . "
181698	181715	181721	181721	he	932	" Who is that lady , uncle , standing beside you at the bed - foot ? "
181716	181720	181721	181721	he	932	" Good God ! "
181724	181735	181751	181751	Caroline	279	" She 's not wandering , is she , ma'am ? "
181740	181749	181751	181751	Caroline	279	" I am wandering in a pleasant world , "
181760	181787	181736	181737	Mrs. Pryor	375	" and I want you to tell me whether it is real or visionary . What lady is that ? Give her a name , uncle . "
181788	181821	181751	181751	Caroline	279	" We must have Dr. Rile again , ma'am ; or better still , MacTurk . He 's less of a humbug . Thomas must saddle the pony and go for him . "
181822	181847	181880	181880	he	206	" No ; I do n't want a doctor . Mamma shall be my only physician . Now , do you understand , uncle ? "
181884	181897	181906	181906	Caroline	279	" I see daylight . You 've told her then , ma'am ? "
181898	181904	181906	181906	Caroline	279	" And is it true ? "
181913	181920	181880	181880	he	206	" Is she really my mother ? "
181921	181941	181906	181906	Caroline	279	" You wo n't cry , or make any scene , or turn hysterical , if I answer Yes ? "
181942	181974	181880	181880	he	206	" Cry ! I 'd cry if you said No . It would be terrible to be disappointed now . But give her a name . How do you call her ? "
181975	182018	181906	181906	Caroline	279	" I call this stout lady in a quaint black dress , who looks young enough to wear much smarter raiment , if she would - I call her Agnes Helstone . She married my brother James , and is his widow . "
182019	182024	181880	181880	he	206	" And my mother ? "
182025	182057	181880	181880	he	206	" What a little sceptic it is ! Look at her small face , Mrs. Pryor , scarcely larger than the palm of my hand , alive with acuteness and eagerness . "
182061	182126	181906	181906	Caroline	279	" She had the trouble of bringing you into the world at any rate . Mind you show your duty to her by quickly getting well , and repairing the waste of these cheeks . - Heigh - ho ! she used to be plump . What she has done with it all I ca n't , for the life of me , divine . "
182127	182157	181906	181906	Caroline	279	" If wishing to get well will help me , I shall not be long sick . This morning I had no reason and no strength to wish it . "
182172	182210	182384	182384	Helstone	279	" Uncle , if you please , you may send me a little bit of supper - anything you like , from your own plate . That is wiser than going into hysterics , is it not ? "
182211	182370	182411	182411	he	4208	" It is spoken like a sage , Cary . See if I do n't cater for you judiciously . When women are sensible , and , above all , intelligible , I can get on with them . It is only the vague , superfine sensations , and extremely wire - drawn notions , that put me about . Let a woman ask me to give her an edible or a wearable - be the same a roc 's egg or the breastplate of Aaron , a share of St. John 's locusts and honey or the leathern girdle about his loins - I can , at least , understand the demand ; but when they pine for they know not what - sympathy , sentiment , some of these indefinite abstractions - I ca n't do it ; I do n't know it ; I have n't got it . - Madam , accept my arm . "
182405	182410	182411	182411	he	4208	" This is chicken , "
182414	182492	182538	182538	he	4208	" but we 'll have partridge to - morrow . - Lift her up , and put a shawl over her . On my word , I understand nursing . - Now , here is the very same little silver fork you used when you first came to the rectory . That strikes me as being what you may call a happy thought - a delicate attention . Take it , Cary , and munch away cleverly . "
182557	182568	182701	182702	the supplicant	4213	" Good - night , bairnie ! God bless thee ! "
182722	182727	182701	182702	the supplicant	4213	" Spare my beloved , "
182732	182763	182855	182856	the watcher	4216	" Heal my life 's life . Rend not from me what long affection entwines with my whole nature . God of heaven , bend , hear , be clement ! "
182818	182853	183020	183020	Caroline	279	" Oh ! I have had a suffering night . This morning I am worse . I have tried to rise . I can not . Dreams I am unused to have troubled me . "
183029	183045	183064	183064	her	4190	" Mamma , I have slept so well . I only dreamed and woke twice . "
183070	183073	183395	183396	Miss Mann	366	" mamma , "
183359	183362	183869	183869	she	279	" up north "
183847	183853	184264	184264	She	375	" I am so thirsty , "
184257	184263	184307	184307	She	375	" man of the people . "
184312	184338	184307	184307	She	375	" Are you not afraid , my dear , to converse with that person so unreservedly ? He may presume , and become troublesomely garrulous . "
184339	184372	184405	184405	his	295	" William presume , mamma ? You do n't know him . He never presumes . He is altogether too proud and sensitive to do so . William has very fine feelings . "
184397	184401	184734	184734	She	375	" fine feelings . "
184742	184748	184734	184734	She	375	" Mamma , do this ; "
184749	184758	184734	184734	She	375	" Please , mamma , fetch me that ; "
184759	184766	184734	184734	She	375	" Mamma , read to me ; "
184767	184774	184889	184889	she	279	" Sing a little , mamma . "
184930	185021	184889	184889	she	279	" Mamma , I am determined you shall not wear that old gown any more . Its fashion is not becoming ; it is too strait in the skirt . You shall put on your black silk every afternoon . In that you look nice ; it suits you . And you shall have a black satin dress for Sundays - a real satin , not a satinet or any of the shams . And , mamma , when you get the new one , mind you must wear it . "
185022	185052	184889	184889	she	279	" My dear , I thought of the black silk serving me as a best dress for many years yet , and I wished to buy you several things . "
185053	185221	184889	184889	she	279	" Nonsense , mamma . My uncle gives me cash to get what I want . You know he is generous enough ; and I have set my heart on seeing you in a black satin . Get it soon , and let it be made by a dressmaker of my recommending . Let me choose the pattern . You always want to disguise yourself like a grandmother . You would persuade one that you are old and ugly . Not at all ! On the contrary , when well dressed and cheerful you are very comely indeed ; your smile is so pleasant , your teeth are so white , your hair is still such a pretty light colour . And then you speak like a young lady , with such a clear , fine tone , and you sing better than any young lady I ever heard . Why do you wear such dresses and bonnets , mamma , such as nobody else ever wears ? "
185222	185230	184889	184889	she	279	" Does it annoy you , Caroline ? "
185231	185320	185345	185345	she	5452	" Very much ; it vexes me even . People say you are miserly ; and yet you are not , for you give liberally to the poor and to religious societies - though your gifts are conveyed so secretly and quietly that they are known to few except the receivers . But I will be your lady's - maid myself . When I get a little stronger I will set to work , and you must be good , mamma , and do as I bid you . "
185338	185343	185345	185345	she	5452	" My own mamma , "
185360	185412	185345	185345	she	5452	" who belongs to me , and to whom I belong ! I am a rich girl now . I have something I can love well , and not be afraid of loving . Mamma , who gave you this little brooch ? Let me unpin it and look at it . "
185431	185440	185345	185345	she	5452	" Did papa give you this , mamma ? "
185441	185466	185345	185345	she	5452	" My sister gave it me - my only sister , Cary . Would that your Aunt Caroline had lived to see her niece ! "
185467	185483	185345	185345	she	5452	" Have you nothing of papa 's - no trinket , no gift of his ? "
185484	185490	185345	185345	she	5452	" I have one thing . "
185491	185496	185345	185345	she	5452	" That you prize ? "
185497	185502	185345	185345	she	5452	" That I prize . "
185503	185508	185345	185345	she	5452	" Valuable and pretty ? "
185509	185516	185345	185345	she	5452	" Invaluable and sweet to me . "
185517	185530	185345	185345	she	5452	" Show it , mamma . Is it here or at Fieldhead ? "
185531	185549	185345	185345	she	5452	" It is talking to me now , leaning on me . Its arms are round me . "
185550	185597	185345	185345	she	5452	" Ah , mamma , you mean your teasing daughter , who will never let you alone ; who , when you go into your room , can not help running to seek for you ; who follows you upstairs and down , like a dog . "
185598	185620	185345	185345	she	5452	" Whose features still give me such a strange thrill sometimes . I half fear your fair looks yet , child . "
185621	185679	185345	185345	she	5452	" You do n't ; you ca n't . Mamma , I am sorry papa was not good . I do so wish he had been . Wickedness spoils and poisons all pleasant things . It kills love . If you and I thought each other wicked , we could not love each other , could we ? "
185680	185692	185345	185345	she	5452	" And if we could not trust each other , Cary ? "
185693	185853	185345	185345	she	5452	" How miserable we should be ! Mother , before I knew you I had an apprehension that you were not good - that I could not esteem you . That dread damped my wish to see you . And now my heart is elate because I find you perfect - almost ; kind , clever , nice . Your sole fault is that you are old - fashioned , and of that I shall cure you . Mamma , put your work down ; read to me . I like your southern accent ; it is so pure , so soft . It has no rugged burr , no nasal twang , such as almost every one 's voice here in the north has . My uncle and Mr. Hall say that you are a fine reader , mamma . Mr. Hall said he never heard any lady read with such propriety of expression or purity of accent . "
185854	185890	185345	185345	she	5452	" I wish I could reciprocate the compliment , Cary ; but , really , the first time I heard your truly excellent friend read and preach I could not understand his broad northern tongue . "
185891	185906	185345	185345	she	5452	" Could you understand me , mamma ? Did I seem to speak roughly ? "
185907	185951	185345	185345	she	5452	" No . I almost wished you had , as I wished you had looked unpolished . Your father , Caroline , naturally spoke well , quite otherwise than your worthy uncle - correctly , gently , smoothly . You inherit the gift . "
185952	185968	185345	185345	she	5452	" Poor papa ! When he was so agreeable , why was he not good ? "
185969	186016	185345	185345	she	5452	" Why he was as he was - and happily of that you , child , can form no conception - I can not tell . It is a deep mystery . The key is in the hands of his Maker . There I leave it . "
186017	186073	186120	186120	Caroline	279	" Mamma , you will keep stitching , stitching away . Put down the sewing ; I am an enemy to it . It cumbers your lap , and I want it for my head ; it engages your eyes , and I want them for a book . Here is your favourite - Cowper . "
186125	186150	186304	186304	She	372	" You will spoil me , mamma . I always thought I should like to be spoiled , and I find it very sweet . "
186322	186327	186304	186304	She	372	" You are better . "
186333	186359	186432	186432	It	4276	" I see you are safe now ; but take care . God grant your health may be called on to sustain no more shocks ! "
186398	186404	186432	186432	It	4276	" She may be better , "
186408	186423	186447	186447	she	372	" but how weak she still is ! What peril she has come through ! "
186437	186446	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" When will my governess return to me ? "
186450	186457	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" May I tell her all ? "
186483	186487	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" Very good , "
186493	186505	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" very good ! But it is no news to me . "
186506	186513	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" What ! did you know ? "
186514	186706	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" I guessed long since the whole business . I have heard somewhat of Mrs. Pryor 's history - not from herself , but from others . With every detail of Mr. James Helstone 's career and character I was acquainted . An afternoon 's sitting and conversation with Miss Mann had rendered me familiar therewith ; also he is one of Mrs. Yorke 's warning examples - one of the blood - red lights she hangs out to scare young ladies from matrimony . I believe I should have been sceptical about the truth of the portrait traced by such fingers - both these ladies take a dark pleasure in offering to view the dark side of life - but I questioned Mr. Yorke on the subject , and he said , ' Shirley , my woman , if you want to know aught about yond ' James Helstone , I can only say he was a man - tiger . He was handsome , dissolute , soft , treacherous , courteous , cruel - - ' Do n't cry , Cary ; we 'll say no more about it . "
186707	186751	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" I am not crying , Shirley ; or if I am , it is nothing . Go on ; you are no friend if you withhold from me the truth . I hate that false plan of disguising , mutilating the truth . "
186752	186798	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" Fortunately I have said pretty nearly all that I have to say , except that your uncle himself confirmed Mr. Yorke 's words ; for he too scorns a lie , and deals in none of those conventional subterfuges that are shabbier than lies . "
186799	186812	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" But papa is dead ; they should let him alone now . "
186813	186901	186906	186906	she	4278	" They should ; and we will let him alone . Cry away , Cary ; it will do you good . It is wrong to check natural tears . Besides , I choose to please myself by sharing an idea that at this moment beams in your mother 's eye while she looks at you . Every drop blots out a sin . Weep ! your tears have the virtue which the rivers of Damascus lacked . Like Jordan , they can cleanse a leprous memory . "
186902	186905	186906	186906	she	4278	" Madam , "
186913	186984	186993	186993	Caroline	279	" did you think I could be daily in the habit of seeing you and your daughter together - marking your marvellous similarity in many points , observing pardon me your irrepressible emotions in the presence and still more in the absence of your child - and not form my own conjectures ? I formed them , and they are literally correct . I shall begin to think myself shrewd . "
186985	186991	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" And you said nothing ? "
187005	187033	186906	186906	she	4278	" Nothing . I had no warrant to breathe a word on the subject . My business it was not ; I abstained from making it such . "
187034	187051	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" You guessed so deep a secret , and did not hint that you guessed it ? "
187052	187058	186906	186906	she	4278	" Is that so difficult ? "
187059	187066	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" It is not like you . "
187067	187073	186906	186906	she	4278	" How do you know ? "
187074	187085	186459	186459	Caroline	279	" You are not reserved ; you are frankly communicative . "
187086	187135	188490	188490	Caroline	279	" I may be communicative , yet know where to stop . In showing my treasure I may withhold a gem or two - a curious , unbought graven stone - an amulet of whose mystic glitter I rarely permit even myself a glimpse . Good - day . "
188485	188488	188490	188490	Caroline	279	" Shirley , "
188506	188528	188545	188545	she	372	" did you know that my cousin Louis was tutor in your uncle 's family before the Sympsons came down here ? "
188548	188559	188545	188545	she	372	" Yes - of course ; I knew it well . "
188560	188572	188545	188545	she	372	" I thought you must have been aware of the circumstance . "
188573	188579	188545	188545	she	372	" Well ! what then ? "
188580	188597	188545	188545	she	372	" It puzzles me to guess how it chanced that you never mentioned it to me . "
188598	188605	188545	188545	she	372	" Why should it puzzle you ? "
188606	188636	188645	188645	Shirley	372	" It seems odd . I can not account for it . You talk a great deal - you talk freely . How was that circumstance never touched on ? "
188637	188643	188657	188658	her friend	3096	" Because it never was , "
188648	188655	188657	188658	her friend	3096	" You are a singular being ! "
188660	188707	188545	188545	she	372	" I thought I knew you quite well ; I begin to find myself mistaken . You were silent as the grave about Mrs. Pryor , and now again here is another secret . But why you made it a secret is the mystery to me . "
188708	188748	188657	188658	her friend	3096	" I never made it a secret ; I had no reason for so doing . If you had asked me who Henry 's tutor was , I would have told you . Besides , I thought you knew . "
188749	188795	188545	188545	she	372	" I am puzzled about more things than one in this matter . You do n't like poor Louis . Why ? Are you impatient at what you perhaps consider his servile position ? Do you wish that Robert 's brother were more highly placed ? "
188796	188803	188843	188843	Caroline	279	" Robert 's brother , indeed ! "
188838	188841	188843	188843	Caroline	279	" Yes , "
188849	188902	188913	188913	Shirley	372	" Robert 's brother . He is thus closely related to Gérard Moore of the Hollow , though nature has not given him features so handsome or an air so noble as his kinsman ; but his blood is as good , and he is as much a gentleman were he free . "
188903	188911	188957	188957	she	372	" Wise , humble , pious Caroline ! "
188916	188956	188994	188994	Caroline	279	" Men and angels , hear her ! We should not despise plain features , nor a laborious yet honest occupation , should we ? Look at the subject of your panegyric . He is there in the garden , "
188984	188992	188994	188994	Caroline	279	" He is not ugly , Shirley , "
188996	189045	189068	189068	her	372	" he is not ignoble . He is sad ; silence seals his mind . But I believe him to be intelligent ; and be certain , if he had not something very commendable in his disposition , Mr. Hall would never seek his society as he does . "
189061	189066	189049	189049	she	372	" Well , well , "
189071	189162	189207	189207	Louis	497	" On the plea of the man being Cyril Hall 's friend and Robert Moore 's brother , we 'll just tolerate his existence ; wo n't we , Cary ? You believe him to be intelligent , do you ? Not quite an idiot - eh ? Something commendable in his disposition ! - i d est , not an absolute ruffian . Good ! Your representations have weight with me ; and to prove that they have , should he come this way I will speak to him . "
189201	189205	189207	189207	Louis	497	" Old boy ! "
189231	189266	189336	189336	Louis	497	" the autumn sun shines as pleasantly on us as on the fairest and richest . This garden is none of ours , but we enjoy its greenness and perfume , do n't we ? "
189318	189333	189336	189336	Louis	497	" The small brown elves actually remember that I fed them the other day , "
189338	189367	189391	189392	Miss Keeldar	372	" They want some more biscuit . To - day I forgot to save a fragment . Eager little sprites , I have not a crumb for you . "
189381	189387	189449	189449	she	372	" A want easily supplied , "
189444	189447	189449	189449	she	372	" There , "
189451	189460	189470	189471	Louis Moore	497	" there is a providence for the improvident . "
189461	189468	189449	189449	she	372	" This September afternoon is pleasant , "
189490	189495	189449	189449	she	372	" Even for you ? "
189496	189506	189449	189449	she	372	" As pleasant for me as for any monarch . "
189507	189532	189449	189449	she	372	" You take a sort of harsh , solitary triumph in drawing pleasure out of the elements and the inanimate and lower animate creation . "
189533	189614	189654	189654	He	497	" Solitary , but not harsh . With animals I feel I am Adam 's son , the heir of him to whom dominion was given over ' every living thing that moveth upon the earth . ' Your dog likes and follows me . When I go into that yard , the pigeons from your dovecot flutter at my feet . Your mare in the stable knows me as well as it knows you , and obeys me better . "
189615	189631	189637	189637	Louis	497	" And my roses smell sweet to you , and my trees give you shade . "
189632	189635	189637	189637	Louis	497	" And , "
189639	189653	189710	189710	Caroline	279	" no caprice can withdraw these pleasures from me ; they are mine . "
189704	189708	189710	189710	Caroline	279	" You see , "
189713	189725	189732	189732	Shirley	372	" his feelings are so often hurt it makes him morose . "
189726	189730	189732	189732	Shirley	372	" You see , "
189737	189763	189779	189779	Caroline	279	" he is a topic on which you and I shall quarrel if we discuss it often ; so drop it henceforward and for ever . "
189764	189777	189779	189779	Caroline	279	" I suppose he has more than once behaved in this way , "
189783	189837	189875	189878	a " real gentleman	8941	" and that renders Shirley so distant to him . Yet I wonder she can not make allowance for character and circumstances . I wonder the general modesty , manliness , sincerity of his nature do not plead with her in his behalf . She is not often so inconsiderate , so irritable . "
189876	189880	189889	189889	He	295	" real gentleman ; "
189893	189966	190014	190014	Caroline	279	" could do aught for that man . And then to see how t ' bairns liked him , and how t ' wife took to him first minute she saw him . He never went into a house but t ' childer wor about him directly . Them little things wor like as if they 'd a keener sense nor grown - up folks i ' finding our folk 's natures . "
190005	190012	189982	189982	he	223	" But he is so grave , "
190016	190093	190014	190014	Caroline	279	" Grave ! the finest company in the world ! Full of odd , quiet , out - of - the - way humour . Never enjoyed an excursion so much in my life as the one I took with him to the Lakes . His understanding and tastes are so superior , it does a man good to be within their influence ; and as to his temper and nature , I call them fine . "
190094	190113	189982	189982	he	223	" At Fieldhead he looks gloomy , and , I believe , has the character of being misanthropical . "
190114	190166	190014	190014	Caroline	279	" Oh ! I fancy he is rather out of place there - in a false position . The Sympsons are most estimable people , but not the folks to comprehend him . They think a great deal about form and ceremony , which are quite out of Louis 's way . "
190167	190177	189982	189982	he	223	" I do n't think Miss Keeldar likes him . "
190178	190203	190217	190217	Caroline	279	" She does n't know him - she does n't know him ; otherwise she has sense enough to do justice to his merits . "
190204	190215	190421	190421	he	315	" Well , I suppose she does n't know him , "
190409	190420	190421	190421	he	315	" What rubbish Mr. Moore stores up in his desk ! "
190424	190437	190451	190451	He	315	" I hope he wo n't keep my old exercises so carefully . "
190438	190443	190421	190421	he	315	" What is it ? "
190444	190450	190451	190451	He	315	" Old copy - books . "
190473	190489	190451	190451	He	315	" If they are only copy - books , I suppose I may open them ? "
190490	190523	191089	191089	she	4354	" Oh yes , quite freely . Mr. Moore 's desk is half mine - for he lets me keep all sorts of things in it - and I give you leave . "
190581	190591	190647	190647	Henry	315	" Shirley Keeldar , Sympson Grove , - - shire "
190636	190645	191089	191089	she	4354	" They are Shirley 's , you see , "
190650	190669	191089	191089	she	4354	" Did you give them to Mr. Moore ? She wrote them with Mrs. Pryor , I suppose ? "
190670	190700	191089	191089	she	4354	" She wrote them in my schoolroom at Sympson Grove , when she lived with us there . Mr. Moore taught her French ; it is his native language . "
190701	190713	191089	191089	she	4354	" I know . Was she a good pupil , Henry ? "
190714	190770	191089	191089	she	4354	" She was a wild , laughing thing , but pleasant to have in the room . She made lesson - time charming . She learned fast - you could hardly tell when or how . French was nothing to her . She spoke it quick , quick - as quick as Mr. Moore himself . "
190771	190781	191089	191089	she	4354	" Was she obedient ? Did she give trouble ? "
190782	190809	191089	191089	she	4354	" She gave plenty of trouble , in a way . She was giddy , but I liked her . I 'm desperately fond of Shirley . "
190810	190826	191089	191089	she	4354	" Desperately fond - you small simpleton ! You do n't know what you say . "
190827	190852	191089	191089	she	4354	" I am desperately fond of her . She is the light of my eyes . I said so to Mr. Moore last night . "
190853	190863	191089	191089	she	4354	" He would reprove you for speaking with exaggeration . "
190864	190951	191089	191089	she	4354	" He did n't . He never reproves and reproves , as girls ' governesses do . He was reading , and he only smiled into his book , and said that if Miss Keeldar was no more than that , she was less than he took her to be ; for I was but a dim - eyed , short - sighted little chap . I 'm afraid I am a poor unfortunate , Miss Caroline Helstone . I am a cripple , you know . "
190952	190991	191089	191089	she	4354	" Never mind , Henry , you are a very nice little fellow ; and if God has not given you health and strength , He has given you a good disposition and an excellent heart and brain . "
190992	191008	191089	191089	she	4354	" I shall be despised . I sometimes think both Shirley and you despise me . "
191009	191088	191089	191089	she	4354	" Listen , Henry . Generally , I do n't like schoolboys . I have a great horror of them . They seem to me little ruffians , who take an unnatural delight in killing and tormenting birds , and insects , and kittens , and whatever is weaker than themselves . But you are so different I am quite fond of you . You have almost as much sense as a man far more , God wot , "
191094	191115	191089	191089	she	4354	" than many men ; you are fond of reading , and you can talk sensibly about what you read . "
191116	191136	191146	191146	she	372	" I am fond of reading . I know I have sense , and I know I have feeling . "
191142	191145	191146	191146	she	372	" Henry , "
191149	191165	191205	191205	she	372	" I have brought your lunch here . I shall prepare it for you myself . "
191197	191204	191205	191205	she	372	" What are you two about , "
191208	191215	191227	191227	Caroline	279	" ransacking Mr. Moore 's desk ? "
191216	191225	191205	191205	she	372	" Looking at your old copy - books , "
191229	191236	191258	191258	She	372	" My old copy - books ? "
191237	191257	191278	191278	she	372	" French exercise - books . Look here ! They must be held precious ; they are kept carefully . "
191268	191277	191278	191278	she	372	" Did not know one was in existence , "
191281	191314	191205	191205	she	372	" I thought the whole lot had long since lit the kitchen fire , or curled the maid 's hair at Sympson Grove . - What made you keep them , Henry ? "
191315	191361	191375	191375	Shirley	372	" It is not my doing . I should not have thought of it . It never entered my head to suppose copy - books of value . Mr. Moore put them by in the inner drawer of his desk . Perhaps he forgot them . "
191362	191373	191385	191385	she	372	" C'est cela . He forgot them , no doubt , "
191377	191384	191483	191483	she	372	" They are extremely well written , "
191389	191470	191483	191483	she	372	" What a giddy girl you were , Shirley , in those days ! I remember you so well . A slim , light creature whom , though you were so tall , I could lift off the floor . I see you with your long , countless curls on your shoulders , and your streaming sash . You used to make Mr. Moore lively - that is , at first . I believe you grieved him after a while . "
191486	191503	191510	191510	Henry	315	" That was written one winter afternoon . It was a description of a snow scene . "
191504	191508	191510	191510	Henry	315	" I remember , "
191512	191551	191483	191483	she	372	" Mr. Moore , when he read it , cried , ' Voila le Français gagné ! ' He said it was well done . Afterwards you made him draw , in sepia , the landscape you described . "
191552	191562	191510	191510	Henry	315	" You have not forgotten , then , Hal ? "
191563	191628	191483	191483	she	372	" Not at all . We were all scolded that day for not coming down to tea when called . I can remember my tutor sitting at his easel , and you standing behind him , holding the candle , and watching him draw the snowy cliff , the pine , the deer couched under it , and the half - moon hung above . "
191629	191642	191510	191510	Henry	315	" Where are his drawings , Harry ? Caroline should see them . "
191643	191658	191483	191483	she	372	" In his portfolio . But it is padlocked ; he has the key . "
191659	191669	191510	191510	Henry	315	" Ask him for it when he comes in . "
191670	191698	191710	191710	Caroline	279	" You should ask him , Shirley . You are shy of him now . You are grown a proud lady to him ; I notice that . "
191699	191708	191710	191710	Caroline	279	" Shirley , you are a real enigma , "
191715	191744	191762	191763	Miss Keeldar	372	" What queer discoveries I make day by day now ! - I who thought I had your confidence . Inexplicable creature ! even this boy reproves you . "
191745	191760	191710	191710	Caroline	279	" I have forgotten ' auld lang syne , ' you see , Harry , "
191774	191801	191868	191868	her	372	" Which you never should have done . You do n't deserve to be a man 's morning star if you have so short a memory . "
191802	191837	191865	191865	Shirley	372	" A man 's morning star , indeed ! and by ' a man ' is meant your worshipful self , I suppose ? Come , drink your new milk while it is warm . "
191857	191863	191891	191892	the boy	4351	" My poor lame darling ! "
191875	191889	191895	191895	she	372	" Whether do you like me or Mr. Sam Wynne best , Shirley ? "
191904	191919	191895	191895	she	372	" O Harry , Sam Wynne is my aversion ; you are my pet . "
191920	191926	191895	191895	she	372	" Me or Mr. Malone ? "
191927	191935	191895	191895	she	372	" You again , a thousand times . "
191936	191949	191895	191895	she	372	" Yet they are great whiskered fellows , six feet high each . "
191950	191973	191895	191895	she	372	" Whereas , as long as you live , Harry , you will never be anything more than a little pale lameter . "
191974	191980	191895	191895	she	372	" Yes , I know . "
191981	192020	191895	191895	she	372	" You need not be sorrowful . Have I not often told you who was almost as little , as pale , as suffering as you , and yet potent as a giant and brave as a lion ? "
192021	192025	191895	191895	she	372	" Admiral Horatio ? "
192026	192080	191895	191895	she	372	" Admiral Horatio , Viscount Nelson , and Duke of Bronte ; great at heart as a Titan ; gallant and heroic as all the world and age of chivalry ; leader of the might of England ; commander of her strength on the deep ; hurler of her thunder over the flood . "
192081	192126	191895	191895	she	372	" A great man . But I am not warlike , Shirley ; and yet my mind is so restless I burn day and night - for what I can hardly tell - to be - to do - to suffer , I think . "
192127	192230	191895	191895	she	372	" Harry , it is your mind , which is stronger and older than your frame , that troubles you . It is a captive ; it lies in physical bondage . But it will work its own redemption yet . Study carefully not only books but the world . You love nature ; love her without fear . Be patient - wait the course of time . You will not be a soldier or a sailor , Henry ; but if you live you will be - listen to my prophecy - you will be an author , perhaps a poet . "
192231	192266	191895	191895	she	372	" An author ! It is a flash - a flash of light to me ! I will - I will ! I 'll write a book that I may dedicate it to you . "
192267	192317	191895	191895	she	372	" You will write it that you may give your soul its natural release . Bless me ! what am I saying ? more than I understand , I believe , or can make good . Here , Hal - here is your toasted oatcake ; eat and live ! "
192318	192321	191895	191895	she	372	" Willingly ! "
192331	192350	192358	192359	Mr. Hall	223	" I know that fragrance of meal bread . Miss Keeldar , may I come in and partake ? "
192351	192354	191895	191895	she	372	" Mr. Hall "
192373	192434	192455	192456	Mr. Hall	223	" there is a proper luncheon laid out in the dining - room and there are proper people seated round it . You may join that society and share that fare if you please ; but if your ill - regulated tastes lead you to prefer ill - regulated proceedings , step in here , and do as we do . "
192435	192453	192483	192483	he	694	" I approve the perfume , and therefore shall suffer myself to be led by the nose , "
192478	192481	192483	192483	he	694	" Burglars ! "
192486	192494	192455	192456	Mr. Hall	223	" Henry , you merit the ferule . "
192495	192507	192528	192529	the girls	2109	" Give it to Shirley and Caroline ; they did it , "
192519	192525	192528	192529	the girls	2109	" Traitor and false witness ! "
192531	192548	192555	192555	Moore	497	" We never laid hands on a thing , except in the spirit of laudable inquiry ! "
192549	192553	192558	192558	his	497	" Exactly so , "
192562	192579	192594	192594	he	497	" And what have you ferreted out , in your ' spirit of laudable inquiry ' ? "
192587	192592	192594	192594	he	497	" This is empty , "
192596	192602	192609	192609	Caroline	279	" Who has taken - - "
192603	192608	192677	192677	Henry	315	" Here , here ! "
192663	192675	192677	192677	Henry	315	" I thought you would have scolded much more , sir , "
192679	192685	192644	192644	he	497	" The girls deserve reprimand . "
192686	192695	192677	192677	Henry	315	" I leave them to their own consciences . "
192696	192738	192751	192751	Shirley	372	" It accuses them of crimes intended as well as perpetrated , sir . If I had not been here , they would have treated your portfolio as they have done your desk ; but I told them it was padlocked . "
192739	192748	192677	192677	Henry	315	" And will you have lunch with us ? "
192768	192775	192677	192677	Henry	315	" Certainly , if I may . "
192776	192788	192799	192799	Louis	497	" You will be restricted to new milk and Yorkshire oatcake . "
192789	192797	192809	192809	he	497	" Va - pour le lait frais ! "
192801	192807	192823	192823	Henry	315	" But for your oatcake ! "
192814	192821	192823	192823	Henry	315	" He can not eat it , "
192825	192838	192809	192809	he	497	" He thinks it is like bran , raised with sour yeast . "
192839	192860	193228	193228	he	497	" Come , then ; by special dispensation we will allow him a few cracknels , but nothing less homely . "
193221	193227	193228	193228	he	497	" You are overheated now , "
193241	193247	193287	193287	Caroline	279	" let me relieve you . "
193274	193285	193287	193287	Caroline	279	" I should like to see your pictures , Louis , "
193297	193305	193404	193404	Louis	497	" Would not you , Mr. Hall ? "
193306	193379	193388	193388	Henry	315	" To please you , I should ; but , for my own part , I have cut him as an artist . I had enough of him in that capacity in Cumberland and Westmoreland . Many a wetting we got amongst the mountains because he would persist in sitting on a camp - stool , catching effects of rain - clouds , gathering mists , fitful sunbeams , and what not . "
193380	193386	193453	193453	she	372	" Here is the portfolio , "
193442	193452	193464	193464	Louis	497	" He makes us wait to whet our curiosity , "
193456	193462	193464	193464	Louis	497	" You understand opening it , "
193471	193483	193581	193581	she	372	" You spoiled the lock for me once ; try now . "
193575	193580	193581	193581	she	372	" There are callers , "
193584	193694	193695	193696	Louis Moore	497	" and I shall be summoned to the room . A pretty figure - as they say - I am to receive company . I and Henry have been in the garden gathering fruit half the morning . Oh for rest under my own vine and my own fig - tree ! Happy is the slave - wife of the Indian chief , in that she has no drawing - room duty to perform , but can sit at ease weaving mats , and stringing beads , and peacefully flattening her pickaninny 's head in an unmolested corner of her wigwam . I 'll emigrate to the western woods . "
193699	193739	193780	193780	he	2228	" To marry a White Cloud or a Big Buffalo , and after wedlock to devote yourself to the tender task of digging your lord 's maize - field while he smokes his pipe or drinks fire - water . "
193770	193779	193780	193780	he	2228	" I thought you alone , Miss Keeldar , "
193783	193790	193842	193842	he	2228	" I find quite a party . "
193834	193841	193842	193842	he	2228	" I merely wished to announce , "
193846	193874	193898	193898	Shirley	372	" that the family from De Walden Hall , Mr. , Mrs. , the Misses , and Mr. Sam Wynne , are in the drawing - room . "
193881	193896	194024	194024	Caroline	279	" The family from De Walden Hall ! Could n't be a worse set , "
194012	194022	194032	194032	She	279	" Shirley , Shirley , you ought to go , "
194026	194031	194060	194060	she	279	" I wonder why ? "
194056	194059	194060	194060	she	279	" If , "
194068	194111	194132	194133	Mr. Hall	223	" if a majority of the present company maintain that the De Walden Hall people have claims on my civility , I will subdue my inclinations to my duty . Let those who think I ought to go hold up their hands . "
194125	194130	194132	194133	Mr. Hall	223	" You must go , "
194135	194158	194159	194160	Louis Moore	497	" and behave courteously too . You owe many duties to society . It is not permitted you to please only yourself . "
194165	194170	194225	194226	Mr. Hall	223	" Hear , hear ! "
194214	194223	194238	194238	he	223	" There is a curious charm about her , "
194233	194237	194238	194238	he	223	" And now , "
194241	194261	194277	194277	Moore	497	" I must away ; for Sweeting is off to see his mother , and there are two funerals . "
194262	194275	194292	194293	the pupil	1382	" Henry , get your books ; it is lesson - time , "
194285	194290	194317	194317	he	497	" A curious charm ! "
194304	194316	194347	194348	Mr. Moore	497	" True . Is she not a kind of white witch ? "
194320	194329	194347	194348	Mr. Moore	497	" Of whom are you speaking , sir ? "
194330	194336	194347	194348	Mr. Moore	497	" Of my cousin Shirley . "
194337	194346	194505	194505	he	1340	" No irrelevant questions ; study in silence . "
194516	194518	194505	194505	he	1340	" and "
194521	194551	194579	194580	Mr. Sympson	487	" She never yet had accepted his definition ; and it was doubtful whether , in the most important step of her life , she would consent to accept it .
194570	194577	194579	194580	Mr. Sympson	487	" Decidedly suitable ! most proper ! "
194582	194599	194624	194624	he	1340	" A fine unencumbered estate , real substance , good connections . It must be done ! "
194638	194649	194673	194673	She	1506	" No ; I shall not marry Samuel Fawthrop Wynne . "
194650	194672	194692	194692	her	1506	" I ask why . I must have a reason . In all respects he is more than worthy of you . "
194701	194716	194624	194624	he	1340	" And I ask in what sense that young man is worthy of me ? "
194717	194735	194692	194692	her	1506	" He has twice your money , twice your common sense , equal connections , equal respectability . "
194736	194753	194624	194624	he	1340	" Had he my money counted fivescore times I would take no vow to love him . "
194754	194761	194692	194692	her	1506	" Please to state your objections . "
194762	194785	194624	194624	he	1340	" He has run a course of despicable , commonplace profligacy . Accept that as the first reason why I spurn him . "
194786	194794	194692	194692	her	1506	" Miss Keeldar , you shock me ! "
194795	194844	194624	194624	he	1340	" That conduct alone sinks him in a gulf of immeasurable inferiority . His intellect reaches no standard I can esteem : there is a second stumbling - block . His views are narrow , his feelings are blunt , his tastes are coarse , his manners vulgar . "
194845	194864	194692	194692	her	1506	" The man is a respectable , wealthy man ! To refuse him is presumption on your part . "
194865	194884	194624	194624	he	1340	" I refuse point - blank ! Cease to annoy me with the subject ; I forbid it ! "
194885	194900	194692	194692	her	1506	" Is it your intention ever to marry ; or do you prefer celibacy ? "
194901	194914	194624	194624	he	1340	" I deny your right to claim an answer to that question . "
194915	194938	194692	194692	her	1506	" May I ask if you expect some man of title - some peer of the realm - to demand your hand ? "
194939	194953	194624	194624	he	1340	" I doubt if the peer breathes on whom I would confer it . "
194954	194978	194692	194692	her	1506	" Were there insanity in the family , I should believe you mad . Your eccentricity and conceit touch the verge of frenzy . "
194979	194996	194624	194624	he	1340	" Perhaps , ere I have finished , you will see me over - leap it . "
194997	195022	194692	194692	her	1506	" I anticipate no less . Frantic and impracticable girl ! Take warning ! I dare you to sully our name by a mésalliance ! "
195023	195032	194624	194624	he	1340	" Our name ! Am I called Sympson ? "
195033	195055	194692	194692	her	1506	" God be thanked that you are not ! But be on your guard ; I will not be trifled with ! "
195056	195086	194624	194624	he	1340	" What , in the name of common law and common sense , would you or could you do if my pleasure led me to a choice you disapproved ? "
195087	195094	194624	194624	he	1340	" Take care ! take care ! "
195105	195123	194692	194692	her	1506	" Why ? What shadow of power have you over me ? Why should I fear you ? "
195124	195130	194624	194624	he	1340	" Take care , madam ! "
195131	195156	194692	194692	her	1506	" Scrupulous care I will take , Mr. Sympson . Before I marry I am resolved to esteem - to admire - to love . "
195157	195165	194624	194624	he	1340	" Preposterous stuff ! indecorous , unwomanly ! "
195166	195194	194692	194692	her	1506	" To love with my whole heart . I know I speak in an unknown tongue ; but I feel indifferent whether I am comprehended or not . "
195195	195208	194624	194624	he	1340	" And if this love of yours should fall on a beggar ? "
195209	195223	194692	194692	her	1506	" On a beggar it will never fall . Mendicancy is not estimable . "
195224	195245	194624	194624	he	1340	" On a low clerk , a play - actor , a play - writer , or - or - - "
195246	195256	194692	194692	her	1506	" Take courage , Mr. Sympson ! Or what ? "
195257	195268	194624	194624	he	1340	" Any literary scrub , or shabby , whining artist . "

He can not write a note without orthographical errors ; he reads only a sporting paper ; he was the booby of Stilbro ' grammar school ! "
195330	195343	194624	194624	he	1340	" Unladylike language ! Great God ! to what will she come ? "
195350	195361	194624	194624	he	1340	" Never to the altar of Hymen with Sam Wynne . "

197203	197322	197333	197333	Louis	497	" Yond ' brother Robert of yours seems to me to be either a fool or a madman . Two months ago I could have sworn he had the game all in his own hands ; and there he runs the country , and quarters himself up in London for weeks together , and by the time he comes back he 'll find himself checkmated . Louis , ' there is a tide in the affairs of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune , but , once let slip , never returns again . ' I 'd write to Robert , if I were you , and remind him of that . "
197323	197331	197154	197154	she	372	" Robert had views on Miss Keeldar ? "
197344	197364	197333	197333	Louis	497	" Views I suggested to him myself , and views he might have realized , for she liked him . "
197365	197370	197154	197154	she	372	" As a neighbour ? "
197371	197423	197333	197333	Louis	497	" As more than that . I have seen her change countenance and colour at the mere mention of his name . Write to the lad , I say , and tell him to come home . He is a finer gentleman than this bit of a baronet , after all . "
197424	197453	197154	197154	she	372	" Does it not strike you , Mr. Yorke , that for a mere penniless adventurer to aspire to a rich woman 's hand is presumptuous - contemptible ? "
197454	197570	197959	197960	the speaker	782	" Oh , if you are for high notions and double - refined sentiment , I 've naught to say . I 'm a plain , practical man myself , and if Robert is willing to give up that royal prize to a lad - rival - a puling slip of aristocracy - I am quite agreeable . At his age , in his place , with his inducements , I would have acted differently . Neither baronet , nor duke , nor prince should have snatched my sweetheart from me without a struggle . But you tutors are such solemn chaps ; it is almost like speaking to a parson to consult with you . "

197950	197957	198079	198079	She	372	" He would not like it . "
198083	198094	198079	198079	She	372	" Mr. Moore , how are you to - night ? "
198095	198108	198079	198079	She	372	" I have not been very ill , and am now better . "
198109	198130	198079	198079	She	372	" I heard that you complained of thirst . I have brought you some grapes ; can you taste one ? "
198131	198142	198079	198079	She	372	" No ; but I thank you for remembering me . "
198143	198147	198079	198079	She	372	" Just one . "
198184	198218	198079	198079	She	372	" But what , then , can I bring you instead ? You have no wish for fruit ; yet I see that your lips are parched . What beverage do you prefer ? "
198219	198236	198079	198079	She	372	" Mrs. Gill supplies me with toast - and - water . I like it best . "
198243	198253	198079	198079	She	372	" Do you suffer ? - have you pain ? "
198254	198258	198079	198079	She	372	" Very little . "
198259	198265	198079	198079	She	372	" What made you ill ? "
198268	198283	198079	198079	She	372	" I wonder what caused this fever ? To what do you attribute it ? "
198284	198301	198079	198079	She	372	" Miasma , perhaps - malaria . This is autumn , a season fertile in fevers . "
198302	198333	198079	198079	She	372	" I hear you often visit the sick in Briarfield , and Nunnely too , with Mr. Hall . You should be on your guard ; temerity is not wise . "
198334	198369	198079	198079	She	372	" That reminds me , Miss Keeldar , that perhaps you had better not enter this chamber or come near this couch . I do not believe my illness is infectious . I scarcely fear "
198377	198398	198079	198079	She	372	" you will take it ; but why should you run even the shadow of a risk ? Leave me . "
198399	198425	198079	198079	She	372	" Patience , I will go soon ; but I should like to do something for you before I depart - any little service - - "
198426	198433	198079	198079	She	372	" They will miss you below . "
198434	198444	198079	198079	She	372	" No ; the gentlemen are still at table . "
198445	198479	198079	198079	She	372	" They will not linger long . Sir Philip Nunnely is no wine - bibber , and I hear him just now pass from the dining - room to the drawing - room . "
198480	198486	198079	198079	She	372	" It is a servant . "
198487	198498	198079	198079	She	372	" It is Sir Philip ; I know his step . "
198499	198505	198079	198079	She	372	" Your hearing is acute . "
198506	198571	198079	198079	She	372	" It is never dull , and the sense seems sharpened at present . Sir Philip was here to tea last night . I heard you sing to him some song which he had brought you . I heard him , when he took his departure at eleven o'clock , call you out on to the pavement , to look at the evening star . "
198572	198579	198079	198079	She	372	" You must be nervously sensitive . "
198580	198588	198079	198079	She	372	" I heard him kiss your hand . "
198589	198592	198079	198079	She	372	" Impossible ! "
198593	198655	198079	198079	She	372	" No : my chamber is over the hall , the window just above the front door ; the sash was a little raised , for I felt feverish . You stood ten minutes with him on the steps . I heard your discourse , every word , and I heard the salute . - Henry , give me some water . "
198656	198663	198079	198079	She	372	" Let me give it him . "
198681	198688	198079	198079	She	372	" And can I do nothing ? "
198689	198713	198079	198079	She	372	" Nothing ; for you can not guarantee me a night 's peaceful rest , and it is all I at present want . "
198714	198721	198079	198079	She	372	" You do not sleep well ? "
198722	198728	198079	198079	She	372	" Sleep has left me . "
198729	198739	198079	198079	She	372	" Yet you said you were not very ill ? "
198740	198750	198079	198079	She	372	" I am often sleepless when in high health . "
198751	198776	198079	198079	She	372	" If I had power , I would lap you in the most placid slumber - quite deep and hushed , without a dream . "
198777	198787	198079	198079	She	372	" Blank annihilation ! I do not ask that . "
198788	198797	198079	198079	She	372	" With dreams of all you most desire . "
198798	198812	198079	198079	She	372	" Monstrous delusions ! The sleep would be delirium , the waking death . "
198813	198826	198079	198079	She	372	" Your wishes are not so chimerical ; you are no visionary . "
198827	198861	198079	198079	She	372	" Miss Keeldar , I suppose you think so ; but my character is not , perhaps , quite as legible to you as a page of the last new novel might be . "
198862	198909	198079	198079	She	372	" That is possible . But this sleep - I should like to woo it to your pillow , to win for you its favour . If I took a book and sat down and read some pages ? I can well spare half an hour . "
198910	198921	198079	198079	She	372	" Thank you , but I will not detain you . "
198922	198928	198079	198079	She	372	" I would read softly . "
198929	198961	198079	198079	She	372	" It would not do . I am too feverish and excitable to bear a soft , cooing , vibrating voice close at my ear . You had better leave me . "
198962	198969	198079	198079	She	372	" Well , I will go . "
198970	198977	198079	198079	She	372	" And no good - night ? "
198978	198992	198079	198079	She	372	" Yes , sir , yes . Mr. Moore , good - night . "
198996	199015	198079	198079	She	372	" Henry , my boy , go to bed now ; it is time you had some repose . "
199016	199031	198079	198079	She	372	" Sir , it would please me to watch at your bedside all night . "
199032	199047	198079	198079	She	372	" Nothing less called for . I am getting better . There , go . "
199048	199056	198079	198079	She	372	" Give me your blessing , sir . "
199057	199066	198079	198079	She	372	" God bless you , my best pupil ! "
199067	199076	198079	198079	She	372	" You never call me your dearest pupil ! "
199077	199084	199136	199136	her	372	" No , nor ever shall . "

199541	199551	199523	199524	The messenger	4522	" Did Mr. Moore tell you to say that ? "
199552	199589	199708	199708	he	497	" Certainly ; why not ? And now , do come , and let us once more be as we were at Sympson Grove . We used to have pleasant school - hours in those days . "
199694	199706	199708	199708	he	497	" You proposed to read to me a few nights ago , "
199710	199748	199780	199780	She	372	" I could not hear you then . My attention is now at your service . A little renewed practice in French may not be unprofitable . Your accent , I have observed , begins to rust . "
199749	199756	199708	199708	he	497	" What book shall I take ? "
199757	199779	199829	199829	he	497	" Here are the posthumous works of St. Pierre . Read a few pages of the ' Fragments de l'Amazone . ' "
199822	199828	200017	200017	She	372	" Put back your hair , "
200020	200039	200046	200046	She	372	" I ca n't do it . Read me a paragraph , if you please , Mr. Moore . "
200054	200058	200043	200043	she	372	" Tres bien , "
200070	200082	200043	200043	she	372	" C'est presque le Français rattrapé , n'est - ce pas ? "
200083	200098	200043	200043	she	372	" You could not write French as you once could , I dare say ? "
200099	200113	200043	200043	she	372	" Oh no ! I should make strange work of my concords now . "
200114	200129	200043	200043	she	372	" You could not compose the devoir of ' La Premiere Femme Savante ' ? "
200130	200138	200043	200043	she	372	" Do you still remember that rubbish ? "
200139	200143	200043	200043	she	372	" Every line . "
200144	200149	200043	200043	she	372	" I doubt you . "
200150	200161	200043	200043	she	372	" I will engage to repeat it word for word . "
200162	200172	200043	200043	she	372	" You would stop short at the first line . "
200173	200180	200187	200187	He	497	" Challenge me to the experiment . "
200181	200186	200043	200043	she	372	" I challenge you . "
200214	200266	201453	201453	her	5967	" And it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them , that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose . "

201706	201720	201600	201600	She	5967	" Lean towards me , Eva . Enter my arms ; repose thus . "
201721	201736	201600	201600	She	5967	" Thus I lean , O Invisible but felt ! And what art thou ? "
201737	201758	201600	201600	She	5967	" Eva , I have brought a living draught from heaven . Daughter of Man , drink of my cup ! "
201759	201815	201600	201600	She	5967	" I drink : it is as if sweetest dew visited my lips in a full current . My arid heart revives ; my affliction is lightened ; my strait and struggle are gone . And the night changes ! the wood , the hill , the moon , the wide sky - all change ! "
201816	201875	201600	201600	She	5967	" All change , and for ever . I take from thy vision darkness ; I loosen from thy faculties fetters ! I level in thy path obstacles ; I with my presence fill vacancy . I claim as mine the lost atom of life . I take to myself the spark of soul - burning heretofore forgotten ! "
201876	201890	201600	201600	She	5967	" O take me ! O claim me ! This is a god . "
201891	201933	201600	201600	She	5967	" This is a son of God - one who feels himself in the portion of life that stirs you . He is suffered to reclaim his own , and so to foster and aid that it shall not perish hopeless . "
201934	201945	201600	201600	She	5967	" A son of God ! Am I indeed chosen ? "
201946	201995	201600	201600	She	5967	" Thou only in this land . I saw thee that thou wert fair ; I knew thee that thou wert mine . To me it is given to rescue , to sustain , to cherish mine own . Acknowledge in me that Seraph on earth named Genius . "
201996	202053	201600	201600	She	5967	" My glorious Bridegroom ! true Dayspring from on high ! All I would have at last I possess . I receive a revelation . The dark hint , the obscure whisper , which have haunted me from childhood , are interpreted . Thou art He I sought . Godborn , take me , thy bride ! "

202625	202639	202599	202599	Shirley	372	" Were they grammatical errors , or did you object to the substance ? "
202640	202672	202622	202622	she	372	" I never said that the lines I drew were indications of faults at all . You would have it that such was the case , and I refrained from contradiction . "

202863	202899	202908	202908	Shirley	372	" Yes ; you and papa had quarrelled terribly , and you set both him and mamma , and Mrs. Pryor , and everybody , at defiance . You said he had insulted you - - "
202900	202906	202861	202861	Henry	315	" He had insulted me , "
202910	203048	202861	202861	Henry	315	" And you wanted to leave Sympson Grove directly . You packed your things up , and papa threw them out of your trunk ; mamma cried , Mrs. Pryor cried ; they both stood wringing their hands begging you to be patient ; and you knelt on the floor with your things and your up - turned box before you , looking , Shirley , looking - why , in one of your passions . Your features , in such passions , are not distorted ; they are fixed , but quite beautiful . You scarcely look angry , only resolute , and in a certain haste ; yet one feels that at such times an obstacle cast across your path would be split as with lightning . Papa lost heart , and called Mr. Moore . "
203049	203054	202861	202861	Henry	315	" Enough , Henry . "
203055	203339	203352	203352	Moore	497	" No , it is not enough . I hardly know how Mr. Moore managed , except that I recollect he suggested to papa that agitation would bring on his gout ; and then he spoke quietly to the ladies , and got them away ; and afterwards he said to you , Miss Shirley , that it was of no use talking or lecturing now , but that the tea - things were just brought into the schoolroom , and he was very thirsty , and he would be glad if you would leave your packing for the present and come and make a cup of tea for him and me . You came ; you would not talk at first , but soon you softened and grew cheerful . Mr. Moore began to tell us about the Continent , the war , and Bonaparte - subjects we were both fond of listening to . After tea he said we should neither of us leave him that evening ; he would not let us stray out of his sight , lest we should again get into mischief . We sat one on each side of him . We were so happy . I never passed so pleasant an evening . The next day he gave you , missy , a lecture of an hour , and wound it up by marking you a piece to learn in Bossuet as a punishment - lesson - ' Le Cheval Dompté . ' You learned it instead of packing up , Shirley . We heard no more of your running away . Mr. Moore used to tease you on the subject for a year afterwards . "
203340	203350	203352	203352	Moore	497	" She never said a lesson with greater spirit , "
203354	203380	203397	203397	Henry	315	" She then , for the first time , gave me the treat of hearing my native tongue spoken without accent by an English girl . "
203381	203394	203397	203397	Henry	315	" She was as sweet as summer cherries for a month afterwards , "
203399	203415	203430	203431	Miss Keeldar	372	" a good hearty quarrel always left Shirley 's temper better than it found it . "
203416	203428	203451	203451	Moore	497	" You talk of me as if I were not present , "
203441	203449	203451	203451	Moore	497	" Are you sure you are present ? "
203453	203485	203397	203397	Henry	315	" There have been moments since my arrival here when I have been tempted to inquire of the lady of Fieldhead if she knew what had become of my former pupil . "
203486	203492	203451	203451	Moore	497	" She is here now . "
203493	203544	203397	203397	Henry	315	" I see her , and humble enough ; but I would neither advise Harry nor others to believe too implicitly in the humility which one moment can hide its blushing face like a modest little child , and the next lift it pale and lofty as a marble Juno . "
203545	203578	203590	203590	His	497	" One man in times of old , it is said , imparted vitality to the statue he had chiselled ; others may have the contrary gift of turning life to stone . "
203601	203611	203637	203637	he	497	" A strange phrase ; what may it mean ? "
203632	203636	203637	203637	he	497	" You mean , "
203642	203656	203662	203662	Shirley	372	" that some men inspire repugnance , and so chill the kind heart . "
203657	203660	203662	203662	Shirley	372	" Ingenious ! "
203664	203684	203715	203715	he	497	" If the interpretation pleases you , you are welcome to hold it valid . I do n't care . "
203709	203714	203746	203746	Olympia	526	" Behold the metamorphosis ! "
203757	203757	203746	203746	Olympia	526	"
203758	203767	203746	203746	Olympia	526	" I have forgotten the very first line . "
203768	203864	203893	203893	she	372	" Which I have not . My memory , if a slow , is a retentive one . I acquire deliberately both knowledge and liking . The acquisition grows into my brain , and the sentiment into my breast ; and it is not as the rapid - springing produce which , having no root in itself , flourishes verdurous enough for a time , but too soon falls withered away . Attention , Henry ! Miss Keeldar consents to favour you . ' Voyez ce cheval ardent et impétueux , ' so it commences . "
203879	203892	203913	203914	the tutor	4303	" Unless I heard the whole repeated I can not continue it , "
203896	203911	204021	204021	she	372	" Yet it was quickly learned - ' soon gained , soon gone , ' "
204012	204020	204021	204021	she	372	" Recall ' Le Songe d'Athalie , ' "
204024	204029	204105	204106	the girl	5967	" and say it . "
204117	204124	204207	204207	Moore	497	" Le chene et le Roseau , "
204210	204229	204399	204400	The group	3310	" And these are our best pieces ! And we have nothing more dramatic , nervous , natural ! "
204407	204424	204450	204450	Shirley	372	" Pleasures are like poppies spread ; You seize the flower - its bloom is shed . "
204441	204448	204450	204450	Shirley	372	" It is the carriage returned , "
204452	204466	204501	204501	she	372	" and dinner must be just ready , and I am not dressed . "
204491	204500	204501	204501	she	372	" Mr. Sympson and the ladies are returned , "
204504	204513	204530	204530	Henry	315	" and Sir Philip Nunnely is with them . "
204514	204528	204530	204530	Henry	315	" How you did start , and how your hand trembled , Shirley ! "
204543	204623	204624	204624	Moore	497	" But I know why - do n't you , Mr. Moore ? I know what papa intends . He is a little ugly man , that Sir Philip . I wish he had not come . I wish sisters and all of them had stayed at De Walden Hall to dine . - Shirley should once more have made tea for you and me , Mr. Moore , and we would have had a happy evening of it . "
204637	204649	204530	204530	Henry	315	" That was your plan , was it , my boy ? "
204650	204659	204624	204624	Moore	497	" Do n't you approve it , sir ? "
204660	204695	204749	204749	she	372	" I approve nothing utopian . Look Life in its iron face ; stare Reality out of its brassy countenance . Make the tea , Henry ; I shall be back in a minute . "
204739	204748	204749	204749	she	372	" Who will take a walk with me ? "
204755	204763	205097	205097	Isabella	509	" Isabella and Gertrude , will you ? "
205087	205095	205097	205097	Isabella	509	" Is not Shirley coming to luncheon ? "
205099	205106	205181	205181	she	372	" She said she was hungry . "
205158	205164	205177	205178	Miss Keeldar	372	" You are not ill ? "
205170	205175	205407	205407	she	372	" A little sick , "
205418	205423	205453	205453	She	372	" Was she ill ? "
205430	205435	205453	205453	She	372	" I am not . "
205436	205452	205453	205453	She	372	" Did anything weigh on her mind ? Had anything happened to affect her spirits ? "
205459	205483	205453	205453	She	372	" What did they mean by spirits ? She had no spirits , black or white , blue or gray , to affect . "
205484	205496	205453	205453	She	372	" Something must be the matter - she was so altered . "
205497	205533	205453	205453	She	372	" She supposed she had a right to alter at her ease . She knew she was plainer . If it suited her to grow ugly , why need others fret themselves on the subject ? "
205534	205548	205599	205599	she	372	" There must be a cause for the change . What was it ? "
205593	205598	205608	205608	she	372	" Fool ! coward ! "
205604	205607	205608	205608	she	372	" Poltroon ! "
205612	205629	205636	205636	she	372	" if you must tremble , tremble in secret ! Quail where no eye sees you ! "
205630	205635	205636	205636	she	372	" How dare you , "
205641	205672	205839	205839	she	372	" how dare you show your weakness and betray your imbecile anxieties ? Shake them off ; rise above them . If you can not do this , hide them . "
205845	205857	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" I am perfectly well ; I have not an ailment . "
206097	206109	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Henry , make haste . The afternoon is getting on . "
206110	206116	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Is it , sir ? "
206117	206128	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Certainly . Are you nearly ready with that lesson ? "
206129	206132	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" No . "
206133	206138	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Not nearly ready ? "
206139	206147	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" I have not construed a line . "
206161	206186	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" The task presents no difficulties , Henry ; or , if it does , bring them to me . We will work together . "
206187	206197	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Mr. Moore , I can do no work . "
206198	206206	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" My boy , you are ill . "
206207	206226	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Sir , I am not worse in bodily health than usual , but my heart is full . "
206227	206242	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Shut the book . Come hither , Harry . Come to the fireside . "
206280	206304	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" This distress is not occasioned by physical pain , you say , Harry ? You have a grief ; tell it me . "
206305	206335	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Sir , I have such a grief as I never had before . I wish it could be relieved in some way ; I can hardly bear it . "
206336	206362	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" Who knows but , if we talk it over , we may relieve it ? What is the cause ? Whom does it concern ? "
206363	206376	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" The cause , sir , is Shirley ; it concerns Shirley . "
206377	206386	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" Does it ? You think her changed ? "
206387	206402	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" All who know her think her changed - you too , Mr. Moore . "
206403	206442	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" Not seriously - no . I see no alteration but such as a favourable turn might repair in a few weeks ; besides , her own word must go for something : she says she is well . "
206443	206483	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" There it is , sir . As long as she maintained she was well , I believed her . When I was sad out of her sight , I soon recovered spirits in her presence . Now - - "
206484	206562	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" Well , Harry , now . Has she said anything to you ? You and she were together in the garden two hours this morning . I saw her talking , and you listening . Now , my dear Harry , if Miss Keeldar has said she is ill , and enjoined you to keep her secret , do not obey her . For her life 's sake , avow everything . Speak , my boy . "
206563	206593	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" She say she is ill ! I believe , sir , if she were dying , she would smile , and aver , ' Nothing ails me . ' "
206594	206605	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" What have you learned then ? What new circumstance ? "
206606	206618	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" I have learned that she has just made her will . "
206619	206624	206640	206640	Moore	497	" Made her will ? "
206632	206638	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" She told you that ? "
206648	206710	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" She told me quite cheerfully , not as an ominous circumstance , which I felt it to be . She said I was the only person besides her solicitor , Pearson Hall , and Mr. Helstone and Mr. Yorke , who knew anything about it ; and to me , she intimated , she wished specially to explain its provisions . "
206711	206717	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Go on , Harry . "
206718	206858	206247	206248	His tutor	4293	" ' Because , ' she said , looking down on me with her beautiful eyes - oh ! they are beautiful , Mr. Moore ! I love them ! I love her ! She is my star ! Heaven must not claim her ! She is lovely in this world , and fitted for this world . Shirley is not an angel ; she is a woman , and she shall live with men . Seraphs shall not have her ! Mr. Moore , if one of the ' sons of God , ' with wings wide and bright as the sky , blue and sounding as the sea , having seen that she was fair , descended to claim her , his claim should be withstood - withstood by me - boy and cripple as I am . "
206859	206871	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Henry Sympson , go on , when I tell you . "
206872	207212	207228	207228	He	497	" ' Because , ' she said , ' if I made no will , and died before you , Harry , all my property would go to you ; and I do not intend that it should be so , though your father would like it . But you , ' she said , ' will have his whole estate , which is large - larger than Fieldhead . Your sisters will have nothing ; so I have left them some money , though I do not love them , both together , half so much as I love one lock of your fair hair . ' She said these words , and she called me her ' darling , ' and let me kiss her . She went on to tell me that she had left Caroline Helstone some money too ; that this manor house , with its furniture and books , she had bequeathed to me , as she did not choose to take the old family place from her own blood ; and that all the rest of her property , amounting to about twelve thousand pounds , exclusive of the legacies to my sisters and Miss Helstone , she had willed , not to me , seeing I was already rich , but to a good man , who would make the best use of it that any human being could do - a man , she said , that was both gentle and brave , strong and merciful - a man that might not profess to be pious , but she knew he had the secret of religion pure and undefiled before God . The spirit of love and peace was with him . He visited the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and kept himself unspotted from the world . Then she asked , ' Do you approve what I have done , Harry ? ' I could not answer . My tears choked me , as they do now . "
207232	207239	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" What else did she say ? "
207240	207450	207451	207451	Moore	497	" When I had signified my full consent to the conditions of her will , she told me I was a generous boy , and she was proud of me . ' And now , ' she added , ' in case anything should happen , you will know what to say to Malice when she comes whispering hard things in your ear , insinuating that Shirley has wronged you , that she did not love you . You will know that I did love you , Harry ; that no sister could have loved you better - my own treasure . ' Mr. Moore , sir , when I remember her voice , and recall her look , my heart beats as if it would break its strings . She may go to heaven before me - if God commands it , she must ; but the rest of my life - and my life will not be long , I am glad of that now - shall be a straight , quick , thoughtful journey in the path her step has pressed . I thought to enter the vault of the Keeldars before her . Should it be otherwise , lay my coffin by Shirley 's side . "
207471	207526	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" You are wrong , both of you - you harm each other . If youth once falls under the influence of a shadowy terror , it imagines there will never be full sunlight again ; its first calamity it fancies will last a lifetime . What more did she say ? Anything more ? "
207527	207538	207451	207451	Moore	497	" We settled one or two family points between ourselves . "
207539	207549	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" I should rather like to know what - - "
207550	207571	207451	207451	Moore	497	" But , Mr. Moore , you smile . I could not smile to see Shirley in such a mood . "
207572	207606	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" My boy , I am neither nervous , nor poetic , nor inexperienced . I see things as they are ; you do n't as yet . Tell me these family points . "
207607	207677	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Only , sir , she asked me whether I considered myself most of a Keeldar or a Sympson ; and I answered I was Keeldar to the core of the heart and to the marrow of the bones . She said she was glad of it ; for , besides her , I was the only Keeldar left in England . And then we agreed on some matters . "
207678	207681	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Well ? "
207682	207751	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Well , sir , that if I lived to inherit my father 's estate , and her house , I was to take the name of Keeldar , and to make Fieldhead my residence . Henry Shirley Keeldar I said I would be called ; and I will . Her name and her manor house are ages old , and Sympson and Sympson Grove are of yesterday . "
207752	207805	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Come , you are neither of you going to heaven yet . I have the best hopes of you both , with your proud distinctions - a pair of half - fledged eaglets . Now , what is your inference from all you have told me ? Put it into words . "
207806	207816	207451	207451	Moore	497	" That Shirley thinks she is going to die . "
207817	207824	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" She referred to her health ? "
207825	207850	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Not once ; but I assure you she is wasting . Her hands are grown quite thin , and so is her cheek . "
207851	207862	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Does she ever complain to your mother or sisters ? "
207863	207913	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Never . She laughs at them when they question her . Mr. Moore , she is a strange being , so fair and girlish - not a man - like woman at all , not an Amazon , and yet lifting her head above both help and sympathy . "
207914	207935	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Do you know where she is now , Henry ? Is she in the house , or riding out ? "
207936	207947	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Surely not out , sir . It rains fast . "
207948	207984	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" True ; which , however , is no guarantee that she is not at this moment cantering over Rushedge . Of late she has never permitted weather to be a hindrance to her rides . "
207985	208123	207451	207451	Moore	497	" You remember , Mr. Moore , how wet and stormy it was last Wednesday - so wild , indeed , that she would not permit Zoë to be saddled ? Yet the blast she thought too tempestuous for her mare she herself faced on foot ; that afternoon she walked nearly as far as Nunnely . I asked her , when she came in , if she was not afraid of taking cold . ' Not I , ' she said . ' It would be too much good luck for me . I do n't know , Harry , but the best thing that could happen to me would be to take a good cold and fever , and so pass off like other Christians . ' She is reckless , you see , sir . "
208124	208159	206148	206149	Mr. Moore	497	" Reckless indeed ! Go and find out where she is , and if you can get an opportunity of speaking to her without attracting attention , request her to come here a minute . "
208160	208165	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Yes , sir . "
208177	208180	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Harry ! "
208184	208211	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Do not deliver the message formally . Word it as , in former days , you would have worded an ordinary summons to the schoolroom . "
208212	208226	207451	207451	Moore	497	" I see , sir . She will be more likely to obey . "
208227	208233	207451	207451	Moore	497	" And , Harry - - "
208234	208237	207451	207451	Moore	497	" Sir ? "
208238	208257	208285	208285	he	497	" I will call you when I want you . Till then , you are dispensed from lessons . "
208272	208284	208285	208285	he	497	" I can be very cool and very supercilious with Henry , "
208288	208339	208701	208701	He	192	" I can seem to make light of his apprehensions , and look down du haut de ma grandeur on his youthful ardour . To him I can speak as if , in my eyes , they were both children . Let me see if I can keep up the same r"le
208700	208700	208718	208718	he	192	"
208706	208717	208718	208718	he	192	" Will she come , or will she not come ? "
208721	208747	208701	208701	He	192	" How will she take the message ? Naively or disdainfully ? Like a child or like a queen ? Both characters are in her nature .
208748	208819	208701	208701	He	192	" If she comes , what shall I say to her ? How account , firstly , for the freedom of the request ? Shall I apologize to her ? I could in all humility ; but would an apology tend to place us in the positions we ought relatively to occupy in this matter ? I must keep up the professor , otherwise - - I hear a door . "
208827	208929	209085	209085	she	372	" She will refuse me . Henry is entreating her to come ; she declines . My petition is presumption in her eyes . Let her only come , I can teach her to the contrary . I would rather she were a little perverse ; it will steel me . I prefer her cuirassed in pride , armed with a taunt . Her scorn startles me from my dreams ; I stand up myself . A sarcasm from her eyes or lips puts strength into every nerve and sinew I have . Some step approaches , and not Henry 's . "
209076	209084	209064	209064	She	372	" Did you want me , sir ? "
209088	209112	209128	209128	her	372	" I ventured , Miss Keeldar , to send for you - that is , to ask an interview of a few minutes . "
209121	209125	209128	209128	her	372	" Well , sir "
209131	209135	209064	209064	She	372	" what about ? "
209136	209219	209227	209227	she	372	" Be seated first . The subject I would broach is one of some moment . Perhaps I have hardly a right to approach it . It is possible I ought to frame an apology ; it is possible no apology can excuse me . The liberty I have taken arises from a conversation with Henry . The boy is unhappy about your health ; all your friends are unhappy on that subject . It is of your health I would speak . "
209220	209226	209064	209064	She	372	" I am quite well , "
209231	209235	209064	209064	She	372	" Yet changed . "
209236	209248	209064	209064	She	372	" That matters to none but myself . We all change . "
209249	209286	209064	209064	She	372	" Will you sit down ? Formerly , Miss Keeldar , I had some influence with you : have I any now ? May I feel that what I am saying is not accounted positive presumption ? "
209287	209320	209064	209064	She	372	" Let me read some French , Mr. Moore , or I will even take a spell at the Latin grammar , and let us proclaim a truce to all sanitary discussions . "
209321	209333	209064	209064	She	372	" No , no . It is time there were discussions . "
209334	209355	209064	209064	She	372	" Discuss away , then , but do not choose me for your text . I am a healthy subject . "
209356	209372	209064	209064	She	372	" Do you not think it wrong to affirm and reaffirm what is substantially untrue ? "
209373	209390	209064	209064	She	372	" I say I am well . I have neither cough , pain , nor fever . "
209391	209406	209064	209064	She	372	" Is there no equivocation in that assertion ? Is it the direct truth ? "
209407	209412	209426	209426	he	497	" The direct truth . "
209420	209425	209426	209426	he	497	" I can myself , "
209429	209446	209064	209064	She	372	" trace no indications of actual disease . But why , then , are you altered ? "
209447	209452	209426	209426	he	497	" Am I altered ? "
209453	209464	209064	209064	She	372	" We will try . We will seek a proof . "
209465	209468	209426	209426	he	497	" How ? "
209469	209486	209064	209064	She	372	" I ask , in the first place , do you sleep as you used to ? "
209487	209501	209426	209426	he	497	" I do not ; but it is not because I am ill . "
209502	209511	209064	209064	She	372	" Have you the appetite you once had ? "
209512	209524	209426	209426	he	497	" No ; but it is not because I am ill . "
209525	209576	209610	209610	Shirley	372	" You remember this little ring fastened to my watch - chain ? It was my mother 's , and is too small to pass the joint of my little finger . You have many a time sportively purloined it . It fitted your fore - finger . Try now . "
209614	209623	209639	209639	Moore	497	" It is not because I am ill . "
209624	209637	209639	209639	Moore	497	" Not only have you lost sleep , appetite , and flesh , "
209641	209675	209426	209426	he	497	" but your spirits are always at ebb . Besides , there is a nervous alarm in your eye , a nervous disquiet in your manner . These peculiarities were not formerly yours . "
209676	209713	209639	209639	Moore	497	" Mr. Moore , we will pause here . You have exactly hit it . I am nervous . Now , talk of something else . What wet weather we have - steady , pouring rain ! "
209714	209776	209426	209426	he	497	" You nervous ? Yes ; and if Miss Keeldar is nervous , it is not without a cause . Let me reach it . Let me look nearer . The ailment is not physical . I have suspected that . It came in one moment . I know the day . I noticed the change . Your pain is mental . "
209777	209797	209639	209639	Moore	497	" Not at all . It is nothing so dignified - merely nervous . Oh ! dismiss the topic . "
209798	209853	209859	209859	Shirley	372	" When it is exhausted ; not till then . Nervous alarms should always be communicated , that they may be dissipated . I wish I had the gift of persuasion , and could incline you to speak willingly . I believe confession , in your case , would be half equivalent to cure . "
209854	209857	209859	209859	Shirley	372	" No , "
209862	209879	210032	210032	she	372	" I wish that were at all probable ; but I am afraid it is not . "
210021	210031	210032	210032	she	372	" I had better tell you than my aunt , "
210035	210096	210166	210166	she	372	" or than my cousins , or my uncle . They would all make such a bustle , and it is that very bustle I dread - the alarm , the flurry , the éclat . In short , I never liked to be the centre of a small domestic whirlpool . You can bear a little shock - eh ? "
210097	210105	210166	210166	she	372	" A great one , if necessary . "
210141	210165	210166	210166	she	372	" Had I thought it right to go to you , I would never have made a secret of the matter one moment , "
210169	210182	210130	210130	she	372	" I would have told you at once , and asked advice . "
210183	210194	210166	210166	she	372	" Why was it not right to come to me ? "
210195	210278	210326	210326	she	372	" It might be right - I do not mean that ; but I could not do it . I seemed to have no title to trouble you . The mishap concerned me only . I wanted to keep it to myself , and people will not let me . I tell you , I hate to be an object of worrying attention , or a theme for village gossip . Besides , it may pass away without result - God knows ! "
210316	210325	210330	210330	she	372	" Great effects may spring from trivial causes , "
210350	210357	210326	210326	she	372	" Look here , Mr. Moore . "
210384	210405	210330	210330	she	372	" I would not show that to any one in Briarfield but you , because you can take it quietly . "
210406	210423	210326	210326	she	372	" Certainly there is nothing in the little mark to shock . Its history will explain . "
210424	210470	210490	210490	he	497	" Small as it is , it has taken my sleep away , and made me nervous , thin , and foolish ; because , on account of that little mark , I am obliged to look forward to a possibility that has its terrors . "
210480	210489	210490	210490	he	497	" Do you know that you try me ? "
210495	210510	210326	210326	she	372	" I am a patient sort of man , but my pulse is quickening . "
210511	210546	210490	210490	he	497	" Whatever happens , you will befriend me , Mr. Moore ? You will give me the benefit of your self - possession , and not leave me at the mercy of agitated cowards ? "
210547	210567	210326	210326	she	372	" I make no promise now . Tell me the tale , and then exact what pledge you will . "
210568	210685	210700	210700	Moore	497	" It is a very short tale . I took a walk with Isabella and Gertrude one day , about three weeks ago . They reached home before me ; I stayed behind to speak to John . After leaving him , I pleased myself with lingering in the lane , where all was very still and shady . I was tired of chattering to the girls , and in no hurry to rejoin them . As I stood leaning against the gate - pillar , thinking some very happy thoughts about my future life - for that morning I imagined that events were beginning to turn as I had long wished them to turn - - "
210686	210698	210700	210700	Moore	497	" Ah ! Nunnely had been with her the evening before ! "
210703	210871	210326	210326	she	372	" I heard a panting sound ; a dog came running up the lane . I know most of the dogs in this neighbourhood . It was Phobe , one of Mr. Sam Wynne 's pointers . The poor creature ran with her head down , her tongue hanging out ; she looked as if bruised and beaten all over . I called her . I meant to coax her into the house and give her some water and dinner . I felt sure she had been ill - used . Mr. Sam often flogs his pointers cruelly . She was too flurried to know me ; and when I attempted to pat her head , she turned and snatched at my arm . She bit it so as to draw blood , then ran panting on . Directly after , Mr. Wynne 's keeper came up , carrying a gun . He asked if I had seen a dog . I told him I had seen Phobe .
210872	210920	210326	210326	she	372	" ' You had better chain up Tartar , ma'am , ' he said , ' and tell your people to keep within the house . I am after Phobe to shoot her , and the groom is gone another way . She is raging mad . ' "
210956	210977	211268	211268	She	4683	" And you told no one , sought no help , no cure ? You would not come to me ? "
210978	211000	210326	210326	she	372	" I got as far as the schoolroom door ; there my courage failed . I preferred to cushion the matter . "
211001	211020	211268	211268	She	4683	" Why ? What can I demand better in this world than to be of use to you ? "
211021	211027	210326	210326	she	372	" I had no claim . "
211028	211036	211268	211268	She	4683	" Monstrous ! And you did nothing ? "
211037	211113	210326	210326	she	372	" Yes . I walked straight into the laundry , where they are ironing most of the week , now that I have so many guests in the house . While the maid was busy crimping or starching , I took an Italian iron from the fire , and applied the light scarlet glowing tip to my arm . I bored it well in . It cauterized the little wound . Then I went upstairs . "
211114	211123	211268	211268	She	4683	" I dare say you never once groaned ? "
211124	211156	210326	210326	she	372	" I am sure I do n't know . I was very miserable - not firm or tranquil at all , I think . There was no calm in my mind . "
211157	211190	211268	211268	She	4683	" There was calm in your person . I remember listening the whole time we sat at luncheon , to hear if you moved in the room above . All was quiet . "
211191	211209	210326	210326	she	372	" I was sitting at the foot of the bed , wishing Phobe had not bitten me . "
211210	211218	211268	211268	She	4683	" And alone . You like solitude . "
211219	211223	210326	210326	she	372	" Pardon me . "
211224	211229	211268	211268	She	4683	" You disdain sympathy . "
211230	211237	210326	210326	she	372	" Do I , Mr. Moore ? "
211238	211256	211268	211268	She	4683	" With your powerful mind you must feel independent of help , of advice , of society . "
211257	211267	211319	211319	he	497	" So be it , since it pleases you . "
211311	211318	211329	211329	his	497	" If it is not so , "
211332	211339	211329	211329	his	497	" how is it , then ? "
211340	211346	211329	211329	his	497	" I do n't know . "
211347	211366	211329	211329	his	497	" You do know , but you wo n't speak . All must be locked up in yourself . "
211367	211375	211329	211329	his	497	" Because it is not worth sharing . "
211376	211451	211329	211329	his	497	" Because nobody can give the high price you require for your confidence . Nobody is rich enough to purchase it . Nobody has the honour , the intellect , the power you demand in your adviser . There is not a shoulder in England on which you would rest your hand for support , far less a bosom which you would permit to pillow your head . Of course you must live alone . "
211452	211486	211329	211329	his	497	" I can live alone , if need be . But the question is not how to live , but how to die alone . That strikes me in a more grisly light . "
211487	211505	211329	211329	his	497	" You apprehend the effects of the virus ? You anticipate an indefinitely threatening , dreadful doom ? "
211509	211517	211329	211329	his	497	" You are very nervous and womanish . "
211518	211530	211329	211329	his	497	" You complimented me two minutes since on my powerful mind . "
211531	211565	211329	211329	his	497	" You are very womanish . If the whole affair were coolly examined and discussed , I feel assured it would turn out that there is no danger of your dying at all . "
211566	211587	211329	211329	his	497	" Amen ! I am very willing to live , if it please God . I have felt life sweet . "
211588	211619	211329	211329	his	497	" How can it be otherwise than sweet with your endowments and nature ? Do you truly expect that you will be seized with hydrophobia , and die raving mad ? "
211620	211636	211329	211329	his	497	" I expect it , and have feared it . Just now I fear nothing . "
211637	211706	211329	211329	his	497	" Nor do I , on your account . I doubt whether the smallest particle of virus mingled with your blood ; and if it did , let me assure you that , young , healthy , faultlessly sound as you are , no harm will ensue . For the rest , I shall inquire whether the dog was really mad . I hold she was not mad . "
211707	211715	211329	211329	his	497	" Tell nobody that she bit me . "
211716	211763	211329	211329	his	497	" Why should I , when I believe the bite innocuous as a cut of this penknife ? Make yourself easy . I am easy , though I value your life as much as I do my own chance of happiness in eternity . Look up . "
211764	211770	211329	211329	his	497	" Why , Mr. Moore ? "
211771	211790	211329	211329	his	497	" I wish to see if you are cheered . Put your work down ; raise your head . "
211791	211795	211329	211329	his	497	" There - - "
211796	211810	211329	211329	his	497	" Look at me . Thank you . And is the cloud broken ? "
211811	211816	211329	211329	his	497	" I fear nothing . "
211817	211829	211329	211329	his	497	" Is your mind restored to its own natural sunny clime ? "
211830	211842	211329	211329	his	497	" I am very content ; but I want your promise . "
211843	211846	211329	211329	his	497	" Dictate . "
211847	212039	212065	212065	he	497	" You know , in case the worst I have feared should happen , they will smother me . You need not smile . They will ; they always do . My uncle will be full of horror , weakness , precipitation ; and that is the only expedient which will suggest itself to him . Nobody in the house will be self - possessed but you . Now promise to befriend me - to keep Mr. Sympson away from me , not to let Henry come near , lest I should hurt him . Mind - mind that you take care of yourself too . But I shall not injure you ; I know I shall not . Lock the chamber door against the surgeons ; turn them out if they get in . Let neither the young nor the old MacTurk lay a finger on me ; nor Mr. Greaves , their colleague ; and lastly , if I give trouble , with your own hand administer to me a strong narcotic - such a sure dose of laudanum as shall leave no mistake . Promise to do this . "
212080	212093	212065	212065	he	497	" I promise all you ask - without comment , without reservation . "
212094	212203	212065	212065	he	497	" If female help is needed , call in my housekeeper , Mrs. Gill . Let her lay me out if I die . She is attached to me . She wronged me again and again , and again and again I forgave her . She now loves me , and would not defraud me of a pin . Confidence has made her honest ; forbearance has made her kind - hearted . At this day I can trust both her integrity , her courage , and her affection . Call her ; but keep my good aunt and my timid cousins away . Once more , promise . "
212204	212208	212217	212217	she	4687	" I promise . "
212209	212216	212065	212065	he	497	" That is good in you , "
212233	212242	212065	212065	he	497	" Is it good ? Does it comfort ? "
212243	212247	212065	212065	he	497	" Very much . "
212248	212282	212065	212065	he	497	" I will be with you - I and Mrs. Gill only - in any , in every extremity where calm and fidelity are needed . No rash or coward hand shall meddle . "
212283	212290	212065	212065	he	497	" Yet you think me childish ? "
212291	212295	212065	212065	he	497	" I do . "
212296	212303	212065	212065	he	497	" Ah ! you despise me . "
212304	212310	212065	212065	he	497	" Do we despise children ? "
212311	212418	212065	212065	he	497	" In fact , I am neither so strong , nor have I such pride in my strength , as people think , Mr. Moore ; nor am I so regardless of sympathy . But when I have any grief , I fear to impart it to those I love , lest it should pain them ; and to those whom I view with indifference I can not condescend to complain . After all , you should not taunt me with being childish , for if you were as unhappy as I have been for the last three weeks , you too would want some friend . "
212419	212430	212065	212065	he	497	" We all want a friend , do we not ? "
212431	212443	212065	212065	he	497	" All of us that have anything good in our natures . "
212444	212452	212065	212065	he	497	" Well , you have Caroline Helstone . "
212453	212462	212065	212065	he	497	" Yes . And you have Mr. Hall . "
212463	212484	212065	212065	he	497	" Yes . Mrs. Pryor is a wise , good woman . She can counsel you when you need counsel . "
212485	212496	212065	212065	he	497	" For your part , you have your brother Robert . "
212497	212539	212065	212065	he	497	" For any right - hand defections , there is the Rev. Matthewson Helstone , M.A. , to lean upon ; for any left - hand fallings - off there is Hiram Yorke , Esq . Both elders pay you homage . "
212540	212593	212065	212065	he	497	" I never saw Mrs. Yorke so motherly to any young man as she is to you . I do n't know how you have won her heart , but she is more tender to you than she is to her own sons . You have , besides , your sister Hortense . "
212594	212603	212065	212065	he	497	" It appears we are both well provided . "
212604	212609	212065	212065	he	497	" It appears so . "
212610	212618	212065	212065	he	497	" How thankful we ought to be ! "
212619	212622	212065	212065	he	497	" Yes . "
212623	212627	212065	212065	he	497	" How contented ! "
212628	212631	212065	212065	he	497	" Yes . "
212632	212692	212728	212728	he	4689	" For my part , I am almost contented just now , and very thankful . Gratitude is a divine emotion . It fills the heart , but not to bursting ; it warms it , but not to fever . I like to taste leisurely of bliss . Devoured in haste , I do not know its flavour . "
212732	212739	212065	212065	he	497	" Is the shadow quite gone ? "
212740	212780	212728	212728	he	4689	" Wholly . As I was two hours since , and as I am now , are two different states of existence . I believe , Mr. Moore , griefs and fears nursed in silence grow like Titan infants . "
212781	212792	212065	212065	he	497	" You will cherish such feelings no more in silence ? "
212793	212800	212728	212728	he	4689	" Not if I dare speak . "
212801	212816	212065	212065	he	497	" In using the word ' dare , ' to whom do you allude ? "
212817	212821	212728	212728	he	4689	" To you . "
212822	212830	212065	212065	he	497	" How is it applicable to me ? "
212831	212840	212728	212728	he	4689	" On account of your austerity and shyness . "
212841	212849	212065	212065	he	497	" Why am I austere and shy ? "
212850	212856	212728	212728	he	4689	" Because you are proud . "
212857	212863	212065	212065	he	497	" Why am I proud ? "
212864	212880	212728	212728	he	4689	" I should like to know . Will you be good enough to tell me ? "
212881	212900	212065	212065	he	497	" Perhaps , because I am poor , for one reason . Poverty and pride often go together . "
212901	212929	212728	212728	he	4689	" That is such a nice reason . I should be charmed to discover another that would pair with it . Mate that turtle , Mr. Moore . "
212930	212947	212065	212065	he	497	" Immediately . What do you think of marrying to sober Poverty many - tinted Caprice ? "
212948	212953	212728	212728	he	4689	" Are you capricious ? "
212954	212958	212065	212065	he	497	" You are . "
212959	212976	212728	212728	he	4689	" A libel . I am steady as a rock , fixed as the polar star . "
212977	213046	212065	212065	he	497	" I look out at some early hour of the day , and see a fine , perfect rainbow , bright with promise , gloriously spanning the beclouded welkin of life . An hour afterwards I look again : half the arch is gone , and the rest is faded . Still later , the stern sky denies that it ever wore so benign a symbol of hope . "
213047	213075	212728	212728	he	4689	" Well , Mr. Moore , you should contend against these changeful humours . They are your besetting sin . One never knows where to have you . "
213076	213136	212065	212065	he	497	" Miss Keeldar , I had once , for two years , a pupil who grew very dear to me . Henry is dear , but she was dearer . Henry never gives me trouble ; she - well , she did . I think she vexed me twenty - three hours out of the twenty - four - - "
213137	213156	212728	212728	he	4689	" She was never with you above three hours , or at the most six at a time . "
213157	213220	212065	212065	he	497	" She sometimes spilled the draught from my cup , and stole the food from my plate ; and when she had kept me unfed for a day and that did not suit me , for I am a man accustomed to take my meals with reasonable relish , and to ascribe due importance to the rational enjoyment of creature comforts - - "
213221	213250	212728	212728	he	4689	" I know you do . I can tell what sort of dinners you like best - perfectly well . I know precisely the dishes you prefer - - "
213251	213308	212065	212065	he	497	" She robbed these dishes of flavour , and made a fool of me besides . I like to sleep well . In my quiet days , when I was my own man , I never quarrelled with the night for being long , nor cursed my bed for its thorns . She changed all this . "
213309	213314	212728	212728	he	4689	" Mr. Moore - - "
213315	213405	212065	212065	he	497	" And having taken from me peace of mind and ease of life , she took from me herself - quite coolly , just as if , when she was gone , the world would be all the same to me . I knew I should see her again at some time . At the end of two years , it fell out that we encountered again under her own roof , where she was mistress . How do you think she bore herself towards me , Miss Keeldar ? "
213406	213419	212728	212728	he	4689	" Like one who had profited well by lessons learned from yourself . "
213420	213455	212065	212065	he	497	" She received me haughtily . She meted out a wide space between us , and kept me aloof by the reserved gesture , the rare and alienated glance , the word calmly civil . "
213456	213491	212728	212728	he	4689	" She was an excellent pupil ! Having seen you distant , she at once learned to withdraw . Pray , sir , admire in her hauteur a careful improvement on your own coolness . "
213492	213527	212065	212065	he	497	" Conscience , and honour , and the most despotic necessity dragged me apart from her , and kept me sundered with ponderous fetters . She was free : she might have been clement . "
213528	213546	212728	212728	he	4689	" Never free to compromise her self - respect , to seek where she had been shunned . "
213547	213643	212065	212065	he	497	" Then she was inconsistent ; she tantalized as before . When I thought I had made up my mind to seeing in her only a lofty stranger , she would suddenly show me such a glimpse of loving simplicity - she would warm me with such a beam of reviving sympathy , she would gladden an hour with converse so gentle , gay , and kindly - that I could no more shut my heart on her image than I could close that door against her presence . Explain why she distressed me so . "
213644	213710	212728	212728	he	4689	" She could not bear to be quite outcast ; and then she would sometimes get a notion into her head , on a cold , wet day , that the schoolroom was no cheerful place , and feel it incumbent on her to go and see if you and Henry kept up a good fire ; and once there , she liked to stay . "
213711	213730	212065	212065	he	497	" But she should not be changeful . If she came at all , she should come oftener . "
213731	213740	212728	212728	he	4689	" There is such a thing as intrusion . "
213741	213756	212065	212065	he	497	" To - morrow you will not be as you are to - day . "
213757	213766	212728	212728	he	4689	" I do n't know . Will you ? "
213767	213862	212065	212065	he	497	" I am not mad , most noble Berenice ! We may give one day to dreaming , but the next we must awake ; and I shall awake to purpose the morning you are married to Sir Philip Nunnely . The fire shines on you and me , and shows us very clearly in the glass , Miss Keeldar ; and I have been gazing on the picture all the time I have been talking . Look up ! What a difference between your head and mine ! I look old for thirty ! "
213863	213897	213939	213939	he	4690	" You are so grave ; you have such a square brow ; and your face is sallow . I never regard you as a young man , nor as Robert 's junior . "
213898	213938	213939	213939	he	4690	" Do n't you ? I thought not . Imagine Robert 's clear - cut , handsome face looking over my shoulder . Does not the apparition make vividly manifest the obtuse mould of my heavy traits ? There ! "
213942	213957	213973	213973	she	372	" I have been expecting that wire to vibrate this last half - hour . "
213968	213972	213977	213977	she	372	" Mr. Moore , "
213983	214011	213939	213939	he	4690	" have you heard from your brother lately ? Do you know what he means by staying in town so long ? Does he talk of returning ? "
214012	214052	214074	214074	she	372	" He talks of returning ; but what has caused his long absence I can not tell . To speak the truth , I thought none in Yorkshire knew better than yourself why he was reluctant to come home . "
214063	214073	214074	214074	she	372	" Write to him and urge him to come , "
214077	214115	214123	214123	Louis	539	" I know there has been no impolicy in protracting his absence thus far . It is good to let the mill stand , while trade is so bad ; but he must not abandon the county . "
214116	214121	214123	214123	Louis	539	" I am aware , "
214125	214232	214259	214259	its	4691	" that he had an interview with you the evening before he left , and I saw him quit Fieldhead afterwards . I read his countenance , or tried to read it . He turned from me . I divined that he would be long away . Some fine , slight fingers have a wondrous knack at pulverizing a man 's brittle pride . I suppose Robert put too much trust in his manly beauty and native gentlemanhood . Those are better off who , being destitute of advantage , can not cherish delusion . But I will write , and say you advise his return . "
214233	214249	214680	214680	he	539	" Do not say I advise his return , but that his return is advisable . "
214671	214678	214680	214680	he	539	" All the parlours are empty , "
214682	214692	215010	215010	he	539	" I am sick at heart of this cell . "
215005	215009	215010	215010	he	539	" Her mark , "
215013	215142	218155	218155	He	4732	" Here she has been - careless , attractive thing ! - called away in haste , doubtless , and forgetting to return and put all to rights . Why does she leave fascination in her footprints ? Whence did she acquire the gift to be heedless and never offend ? There is always something to chide in her , and the reprimand never settles in displeasure on the heart , but , for her lover or her husband , when it had trickled a while in words , would naturally melt from his lips in a kiss . Better pass half an hour in remonstrating with her than a day in admiring or praising any other woman alive . Am I muttering ? soliloquizing ? Stop that . "
215290	215340	218155	218155	He	4732	" It is nine o'clock ; the carriage will not return before eleven , I am certain . Freedom is mine till then ; till then I may occupy her room , sit opposite her chair , rest my elbow on her table , have her little mementoes about me .
215341	215428	218155	218155	He	4732	" I used rather to like Solitude - to fancy her a somewhat quiet and serious , yet fair nymph ; an Oread , descending to me from lone mountain - passes , something of the blue mist of hills in her array and of their chill breeze in her breath , but much also of their solemn beauty in her mien . I once could court her serenely , and imagine my heart easier when I held her to it - all mute , but majestic .
215429	215493	218155	218155	He	4732	" Since that day I called S. to me in the schoolroom , and she came and sat so near my side ; since she opened the trouble of her mind to me , asked my protection , appealed to my strength - since that hour I abhor Solitude . Cold abstraction , fleshless skeleton , daughter , mother , and mate of Death !
215494	215551	218155	218155	He	4732	" It is pleasant to write about what is near and dear as the core of my heart . None can deprive me of this little book , and through this pencil I can say to it what I will - say what I dare utter to nothing living - say what I dare not think aloud .
215552	215762	218155	218155	He	4732	" We have scarcely encountered each other since that evening . Once , when I was alone in the drawing - room , seeking a book of Henry 's , she entered , dressed for a concert at Stilbro ' . Shyness - her shyness , not mine - drew a silver veil between us . Much ca nt have I heard and read about ' maiden modesty , ' but , properly used , and not hackneyed , the words are good and appropriate words . As she passed to the window , after tacitly but gracefully recognizing me , I could call her nothing in my own mind save ' stainless virgin . ' To my perception , a delicate splendour robed her , and the modesty of girlhood was her halo . I may be the most fatuous , as I am one of the plainest , of men , but in truth that shyness of hers touched me exquisitely ; it flattered my finest sensations . I looked a stupid block , I dare say . I was alive with a life of Paradise , as she turned her glance from my glance , and softly averted her head to hide the suffusion of her cheek .
215763	215808	218155	218155	He	4732	" I know this is the talk of a dreamer - of a rapt , romantic lunatic . I do dream . I will dream now and then ; and if she has inspired romance into my prosaic composition , how can I help it ?
215809	215943	218155	218155	He	4732	" What a child she is sometimes ! What an unsophisticated , untaught thing ! I see her now looking up into my face , and entreating me to prevent them from smothering her , and to be sure and give her a strong narcotic . I see her confessing that she was not so self - sufficing , so independent of sympathy , as people thought . I see the secret tear drop quietly from her eyelash . She said I thought her childish , and I did . She imagined I despised her . Despised her ! It was unutterably sweet to feel myself at once near her and above her - to be conscious of a natural right and power to sustain her , as a husband should sustain his wife .
215944	216055	218155	218155	He	4732	" I worship her perfections ; but it is her faults , or at least her foibles , that bring her near to me , that nestle her to my heart , that fold her about with my love , and that for a most selfish but deeply - natural reason . These faults are the steps by which I mount to ascendency over her . If she rose a trimmed , artificial mound , without inequality , what vantage would she offer the foot ? It is the natural hill , with its mossy breaks and hollows , whose slope invites ascent , whose summit it is pleasure to gain .
216056	216283	218155	218155	He	4732	" To leave metaphor . It delights my eye to look on her . She suits me . If I were a king and she the housemaid that swept my palace - stairs , across all that space between us my eye would recognize her qualities ; a true pulse would beat for her in my heart , though an unspanned gulf made acquaintance impossible . If I were a gentleman , and she waited on me as a servant , I could not help liking that Shirley . Take from her her education ; take her ornaments , her sumptuous dress , all extrinsic advantages ; take all grace , but such as the symmetry of her form renders inevitable ; present her to me at a cottage door , in a stuff gown ; let her offer me there a draught of water , with that smile , with that warm good - will with which she now dispenses manorial hospitality - I should like her . I should wish to stay an hour ; I should linger to talk with that rustic . I should not feel as I now do ; I should find in her nothing divine ; but whenever I met the young peasant , it would be with pleasure ; whenever I left her , it would be with regret .
216284	216819	218155	218155	He	4732	" How culpably careless in her to leave her desk open , where I know she has money ! In the lock hang the keys of all her repositories , of her very jewel - casket . There is a purse in that little satin bag ; I see the tassel of silver beads hanging out . That spectacle would provoke my brother Robert . All her little failings would , I know , be a source of irritation to him . If they vex me it is a most pleasurable vexation . I delight to find her at fault ; and were I always resident with her , I am aware she would be no niggard in thus ministering to my enjoyment . She would just give me something to do , to rectify - a theme for my tutor lectures . I never lecture Henry , never feel disposed to do so . If he does wrong - and that is very seldom , dear , excellent lad ! - a word suffices . Often I do no more than shake my head . But the moment her minois mutin meets my eye , expostulatory words crowd to my lips . From a taciturn man I believe she would transform me into a talker . Whence comes the delight I take in that talk ? It puzzles myself sometimes . The more crâne , malin , taquin is her mood , consequently the clearer occasion she gives me for disapprobation , the more I seek her , the better I like her . She is never wilder than when equipped in her habit and hat , never less manageable than when she and Zoë come in fiery from a race with the wind on the hills ; and I confess it - to this mute page I may confess it - I have waited an hour in the court for the chance of witnessing her return , and for the dearer chance of receiving her in my arms from the saddle . I have noticed again it is to this page only I would make the remark that she will never permit any man but myself to render her that assistance . I have seen her politely decline Sir Philip Nunnely 's aid . She is always mighty gentle with her young baronet , mighty tender for his feelings , forsooth , and of his very thin - skinned amour propre . I have marked her haughtily reject Sam Wynne 's . Now I know - my heart knows it , for it has felt it - that she resigns herself to me unreluctantly . Is she conscious how my strength rejoices to serve her ? I myself am not her slave - I declare it - but my faculties gather to her beauty , like the genii to the glisten of the lamp . All my knowledge , all my prudence , all my calm , and all my power stand in her presence humbly waiting a task . How glad they are when a mandate comes ! What joy they take in the toils she assigns ! Does she know it ?
216820	216962	218155	218155	He	4732	" I have called her careless . It is remarkable that her carelessness never compromises her refinement . Indeed , through this very loophole of character , the reality , depth , genuineness of that refinement may be ascertained . A whole garment sometimes covers meagreness and malformation ; through a rent sleeve a fair round arm may be revealed . I have seen and handled many of her possessions , because they are frequently astray . I never saw anything that did not proclaim the lady - nothing sordid , nothing soiled . In one sense she is as scrupulous as , in another , she is unthinking . As a peasant girl , she would go ever trim and cleanly . Look at the pure kid of this little glove , at the fresh , unsullied satin of the bag .
216963	217359	218155	218155	He	4732	" What a difference there is between S. and that pearl C. H. ! Caroline , I fancy , is the soul of conscientious punctuality and nice exactitude . She would precisely suit the domestic habits of a certain fastidious kinsman of mine - so delicate , dexterous , quaint , quick , quiet - all done to a minute , all arranged to a strawbreadth . She would suit Robert . But what could I do with anything so nearly faultless ? She is my equal , poor as myself . She is certainly pretty : a little Raffaelle head hers - Raffaelle in feature , quite English in expression , all insular grace and purity ; but where is there anything to alter , anything to endure , anything to reprimand , to be anxious about ? There she is , a lily of the valley , untinted , needing no tint . What change could improve her ? What pencil dare to paint ? My sweetheart , if I ever have one , must bear nearer affinity to the rose - a sweet , lively delight guarded with prickly peril . My wife , if I ever marry , must stir my great frame with a sting now and then ; she must furnish use to her husband 's vast mass of patience . I was not made so enduring to be mated with a lamb ; I should find more congenial responsibility in the charge of a young lioness or leopardess . I like few things sweet but what are likewise pungent - few things bright but what are likewise hot . I like the summer day , whose sun makes fruit blush and corn blanch . Beauty is never so beautiful as when , if I tease it , it wreathes back on me with spirit . Fascination is never so imperial as when , roused and half ireful , she threatens transformation to fierceness . I fear I should tire of the mute , monotonous innocence of the lamb ; I should ere long feel as burdensome the nestling dove which never stirred in my bosom ; but my patience would exult in stilling the flutterings and training the energies of the restless merlin . In managing the wild instincts of the scarce manageable bete fauve my powers would revel .
217360	217419	218155	218155	He	4732	" O my pupil ! O Peri ! too mutinous for heaven , too innocent for hell , never shall I do more than see , and worship , and wish for thee . Alas ! knowing I could make thee happy , will it be my doom to see thee possessed by those who have not that power ?
217420	217454	218155	218155	He	4732	" However kindly the hand , if it is feeble , it can not bend Shirley ; and she must be bent . It can not curb her ; and she must be curbed .
217455	217582	218155	218155	He	4732	" Beware , Sir Philip Nunnely ! I never see you walking or sitting at her side , and observe her lips compressed , or her brow knit , in resolute endurance of some trait of your character which she neither admires nor likes , in determined toleration of some weakness she believes atoned for by a virtue , but which annoys her despite that belief ; I never mark the grave glow of her face , the unsmiling sparkle of her eye , the slight recoil of her whole frame when you draw a little too near , and gaze a little too expressively , and whisper a little too warmly - I never witness these things but I think of the fable of Semele reversed .
217583	217713	218155	218155	He	4732	" It is not the daughter of Cadmus I see , nor do I realize her fatal longing to look on Jove in the majesty of his god - head . It is a priest of Juno that stands before me , watching late and lone at a shrine in an Argive temple . For years of solitary ministry he has lived on dreams . There is divine madness upon him . He loves the idol he serves , and prays day and night that his frenzy may be fed , and that the Ox - eyed may smile on her votary . She has heard ; she will be propitious . All Argos slumbers . The doors of the temple are shut ; the priest waits at the altar .
217714	217845	218155	218155	He	4732	" A shock of heaven and earth is felt - not by the slumbering city , only by that lonely watcher , brave and unshaken in his fanaticism . In the midst of silence , with no preluding sound , he is wrapped in sudden light . Through the roof , through the rent , wide - yawning , vast , white - blazing blue of heaven above , pours a wondrous descent , dread as the downrushing of stars . He has what he asked . Withdraw - forbear to look - I am blinded . I hear in that fane an unspeakable sound . Would that I could not hear it ! I see an insufferable glory burning terribly between the pillars . Gods be merciful and quench it !
217846	217918	218155	218155	He	4732	" A pious Argive enters to make an early offering in the cool dawn of morning . There was thunder in the night ; the bolt fell here . The shrine is shivered , the marble pavement round split and blackened . Saturnia 's statue rises chaste , grand , untouched ; at her feet piled ashes lie pale . No priest remains ; he who watched will be seen no more .
217919	217967	218155	218155	He	4732	" There is the carriage ! Let me lock up the desk and pocket the keys . She will be seeking them to - morrow ; she will have to come to me . I hear her : ' Mr. Moore , have you seen my keys ? '
217968	218154	218423	218424	Mr. Yorke	245	" So she will say , in her clear voice , speaking with reluctance , looking ashamed , conscious that this is the twentieth time of asking . I will tantalize her , keep her with me , expecting , doubting ; and when I do restore them , it shall not be without a lecture . Here is the bag , too , and the purse ; the glove - pen - seal . She shall wring them all out of me slowly and separately - only by confession , penitence , entreaty . I never can touch her hand , or a ringlet of her head , or a ribbon of her dress , but I will make privileges for myself . Every feature of her face , her bright eyes , her lips , shall go through each change they know , for my pleasure - display each exquisite variety of glance and curve , to delight , thrill , perhaps more hopelessly to enchain me . If I must be her slave , I will not lose my freedom for nothing . "
218414	218421	218423	218424	Mr. Yorke	245	" I 'll tell him that , "
218433	218448	218911	218911	he	245	" and if that does not bring him home full gallop , nothing will . "
218901	218910	218911	218911	he	245	" But it is a pity , lad , "
218914	218965	219114	219114	he	245	" that you did not hang these four samples of the unwashed . If you had managed that feat , the gentry here would have riven the horses out of the coach , yoked to a score of asses , and drawn you into Stilbro ' like a conquering general . "
219123	219269	219114	219114	he	245	" Bob , I believe you are worsted , and you deserve it . All was smooth . Fortune had fallen in love with you . She had decreed you the first prize in her wheel - twenty thousand pounds ; she only required that you should hold your hand out and take it . And what did you do ? You called for a horse and rode a - hunting to Warwickshire . Your sweetheart - Fortune , I mean - was perfectly indulgent . She said , ' I 'll excuse him ; he 's young . ' She waited , like ' Patience on a monument , ' till the chase was over and the vermin - prey run down . She expected you would come back then , and be a good lad . You might still have had her first prize .
219270	219356	219114	219114	he	245	" It capped her beyond expression , and me too , to find that , instead of thundering home in a breakneck gallop and laying your assize laurels at her feet , you coolly took coach up to London . What you have done there Satan knows ; nothing in this world , I believe , but sat and sulked . Your face was never lily fair , but it is olive green now . You 're not as bonny as you were , man . "
219357	219371	219114	219114	he	245	" And who is to have this prize you talk so much about ? "
219372	219403	219114	219114	he	245	" Only a baronet ; that is all . I have not a doubt in my own mind you 've lost her . She will be Lady Nunnely before Christmas . "
219404	219410	219114	219114	he	245	" Hem ! Quite probable . "
219411	219433	219114	219114	he	245	" But she need not to have been . Fool of a lad ! I swear you might have had her . "
219434	219442	219114	219114	he	245	" By what token , Mr. Yorke ? "
219443	219477	219114	219114	he	245	" By every token - by the light of her eyes , the red of her cheeks . Red they grew when your name was mentioned , though of custom they are pale . "
219478	219488	219114	219114	he	245	" My chance is quite over , I suppose ? "
219489	219535	219114	219114	he	245	" It ought to be . But try ; it is worth trying . I call this Sir Philip milk and water . And then he writes verses , they say - tags rhymes . You are above that , Bob , at all events . "
219536	219557	219114	219114	he	245	" Would you advise me to propose , late as it is , Mr. Yorke - at the eleventh hour ? "
219558	219648	219114	219114	he	245	" You can but make the experiment , Robert . If she has a fancy for you - and , on my conscience , I believe she has or had - she will forgive much . But , my lad , you are laughing . Is it at me ? You had better grin at your own perverseness . I see , however , you laugh at the wrong side of your mouth . You have as sour a look at this moment as one need wish to see . "
219649	219697	219114	219114	he	245	" I have so quarrelled with myself , Yorke . I have so kicked against the pricks , and struggled in a strait waistcoat , and dislocated my wrists with wrenching them in handcuffs , and battered my hard head by driving it against a harder wall . "
219698	219731	219114	219114	he	245	" Ha ! I 'm glad to hear that . Sharp exercise yon ! I hope it has done you good - ta'en some of the self - conceit out of you ? "
219732	219792	219114	219114	he	245	" Self - conceit ? What is it ? Self - respect , self - tolerance even , what are they ? Do you sell the articles ? Do you know anybody who does ? Give an indication . They would find in me a liberal chapman . I would part with my last guinea this minute to buy . "
219793	219821	219114	219114	he	245	" Is it so with you , Robert ? I find that spicy . I like a man to speak his mind . What has gone wrong ? "
219822	219854	219114	219114	he	245	" The machinery of all my nature ; the whole enginery of this human mill ; the boiler , which I take to be the heart , is fit to burst . "
219855	219904	219114	219114	he	245	" That suld be putten i ' print ; it 's striking . It 's almost blank verse . Ye'll be jingling into poetry just e'now . If the afflatus comes , give way , Robert . Never heed me ; I 'll bear it this whet time . "
219905	219932	219114	219114	he	245	" Hideous , abhorrent , base blunder ! You may commit in a moment what you will rue for years - what life can not cancel . "
219933	219985	219114	219114	he	245	" Lad , go on . I call it pie , nuts , sugar - candy . I like the taste uncommonly . Go on . It will do you good to talk . The moor is before us now , and there is no life for many a mile round . "
219986	220021	219114	219114	he	245	" I will talk . I am not ashamed to tell . There is a sort of wild cat in my breast , and I choose that you shall hear how it can yell . "
220022	220118	219114	219114	he	245	" To me it is music . What grand voices you and Louis have ! When Louis sings - tones off like a soft , deep bell - I 've felt myself tremble again . The night is still . It listens . It is just leaning down to you , like a black priest to a blacker penitent . Confess , lad . Smooth naught down . Be candid as a convicted , justified , sanctified Methody at an experience meeting . Make yourself as wicked as Beelzebub . It will ease your mind . "
220119	220162	219114	219114	he	245	" As mean as Mammon , you would say . Yorke , if I got off horseback and laid myself down across the road , would you have the goodness to gallop over me , backwards and forwards , about twenty times ? "
220163	220184	219114	219114	he	245	" Wi ' all the pleasure in life , if there were no such thing as a coroner 's inquest . "
220185	220238	219114	219114	he	245	" Hiram Yorke , I certainly believed she loved me . I have seen her eyes sparkle radiantly when she has found me out in a crowd ; she has flushed up crimson when she has offered me her hand , and said , ' How do you do , Mr. Moore ? '
220239	220333	219114	219114	he	245	" My name had a magical influence over her . When others uttered it she changed countenance - I know she did . She pronounced it herself in the most musical of her many musical tones . She was cordial to me ; she took an interest in me ; she was anxious about me ; she wished me well ; she sought , she seized every opportunity to benefit me . I considered , paused , watched , weighed , wondered . I could come to but one conclusion - this is love .
220334	220565	219114	219114	he	245	" I looked at her , Yorke . I saw in her youth and a species of beauty . I saw power in her . Her wealth offered me the redemption of my honour and my standing . I owed her gratitude . She had aided me substantially and effectually by a loan of five thousand pounds . Could I remember these things ? Could I believe she loved me ? Could I hear wisdom urge me to marry her , and disregard every dear advantage , disbelieve every flattering suggestion , disdain every well - weighed counsel , turn and leave her ? Young , graceful , gracious - my benefactress , attached to me , enamoured of me . I used to say so to myself ; dwell on the word ; mouth it over and over again ; swell over it with a pleasant , pompous complacency , with an admiration dedicated entirely to myself , and unimpaired even by esteem for her ; indeed I smiled in deep secrecy at her naiveté and simplicity in being the first to love , and to show it . That whip of yours seems to have a good heavy handle , Yorke ; you can swing it about your head and knock me out of the saddle , if you choose . I should rather relish a loundering whack . "
220566	220603	219114	219114	he	245	" Tak patience , Robert , till the moon rises and I can see you . Speak plain out - did you love her or not ? I could like to know . I feel curious . "
220604	220727	219114	219114	he	245	" Sir - sir - I say - she is very pretty , in her own style , and very attractive . She has a look , at times , of a thing made out of fire and air , at which I stand and marvel , without a thought of clasping and kissing it . I felt in her a powerful magnet to my interest and vanity . I never felt as if nature meant her to be my other and better self . When a question on that head rushed upon me , I flung it off , saying brutally I should be rich with her and ruined without her - vowing I would be practical , and not romantic . "
220728	220742	219114	219114	he	245	" A very sensible resolve . What mischief came of it , Bob ? "
220743	220802	219114	219114	he	245	" With this sensible resolve I walked up to Fieldhead one night last August . It was the very eve of my departure for Birmingham ; for , you see , I wanted to secure Fortune 's splendid prize . I had previously dispatched a note requesting a private interview . I found her at home , and alone .
220803	220874	219114	219114	he	245	" She received me without embarrassment , for she thought I came on business . I was embarrassed enough , but determined . I hardly know how I got the operation over ; but I went to work in a hard , firm fashion - frightful enough , I dare say . I sternly offered myself - my fine person - with my debts , of course , as a settlement .
220875	220913	219114	219114	he	245	" It vexed me , it kindled my ire , to find that she neither blushed , trembled , nor looked down . She responded , ' I doubt whether I have understood you , Mr. Moore . '
220914	221005	219114	219114	he	245	" And I had to go over the whole proposal twice , and word it as plainly as A B C , before she would fully take it in . And then , what did she do ? Instead of faltering a sweet Yes , or maintaining a soft , confused silence which would have been as good , she started up , walked twice fast through the room , in the way that she only does , and no other woman , and ejaculated , ' God bless me ! '
221006	221057	219114	219114	he	245	" Yorke , I stood on the hearth , backed by the mantelpiece ; against it I leaned , and prepared for anything - everything . I knew my doom , and I knew myself . There was no misunderstanding her aspect and voice . She stopped and looked at me .
221058	221130	219114	219114	he	245	" ' God bless me ! ' she piteously repeated , in that shocked , indignant , yet saddened accent . ' You have made a strange proposal - strange from you ; and if you knew how strangely you worded it and looked it , you would be startled at yourself . You spoke like a brigand who demanded my purse rather than like a lover who asked my heart . '
221131	221167	219114	219114	he	245	" A queer sentence , was it not , Yorke ? And I knew , as she uttered it , it was true as queer . Her words were a mirror in which I saw myself .
221168	221185	219114	219114	he	245	" I looked at her , dumb and wolfish . She at once enraged and shamed me .
221186	221305	219114	219114	he	245	" ' Gérard Moore , you know you do n't love Shirley Keeldar . ' I might have broken out into false swearing - vowed that I did love her ; but I could not lie in her pure face . I could not perjure myself in her truthful presence . Besides , such hollow oaths would have been vain as void . She would no more have believed me than she would have believed the ghost of Judas , had he broken from the night and stood before her . Her female heart had finer perceptions than to be cheated into mistaking my half - coarse , half - cold admiration for true - throbbing , manly love .
221306	221317	219114	219114	he	245	" What next happened ? you will say , Mr. Yorke .
221318	221377	219114	219114	he	245	" Why , she sat down in the window - seat and cried . She cried passionately . Her eyes not only rained but lightened . They flashed , open , large , dark , haughty , upon me . They said , ' You have pained me ; you have outraged me ; you have deceived me . '
221378	221385	219114	219114	he	245	" She added words soon to looks .
221386	221440	219114	219114	he	245	" ' I did respect - I did admire - I did like you , ' she said - ' yes , as much as if you were my brother ; and you - you want to make a speculation of me . You would immolate me to that mill , your Moloch ! '
221441	221465	219114	219114	he	245	" I had the common sense to abstain from any word of excuse , any attempt at palliation . I stood to be scorned .
221466	221492	219114	219114	he	245	" Sold to the devil for the time being , I was certainly infatuated . When I did speak , what do you think I said ?
221493	221511	219114	219114	he	245	" ' Whatever my own feelings were , I was persuaded you loved me , Miss Keeldar . '
221512	221548	219114	219114	he	245	" Beautiful , was it not ? She sat quite confounded . ' Is it Robert Moore that speaks ? ' I heard her mutter . ' Is it a man - or something lower ? '
221549	221578	219114	219114	he	245	" ' Do you mean , ' she asked aloud - ' do you mean you thought I loved you as we love those we wish to marry ? '
221579	221589	219114	219114	he	245	" It was my meaning , and I said so .
221590	221737	219114	219114	he	245	" ' You conceived an idea obnoxious to a woman 's feelings , ' was her answer . ' You have announced it in a fashion revolting to a woman 's soul . You insinuate that all the frank kindness I have shown you has been a complicated , a bold , and an immodest manouvre to ensnare a husband . You imply that at last you come here out of pity to offer me your hand , because I have courted you . Let me say this : Your sight is jaundiced ; you have seen wrong . Your mind is warped ; you have judged wrong . Your tongue betrays you ; you now speak wrong . I never loved you . Be at rest there . My heart is as pure of passion for you as yours is barren of affection for me . '
221738	221746	219114	219114	he	245	" I hope I was answered , Yorke ?
221747	221765	219114	219114	he	245	" ' I seem to be a blind , besotted sort of person , ' was my remark .
221766	221825	219114	219114	he	245	" ' Loved you ! ' she cried . ' Why , I have been as frank with you as a sister - never shunned you , never feared you . You can not , ' she affirmed triumphantly - ' you can not make me tremble with your coming , nor accelerate my pulse by your influence . '
221826	221850	219114	219114	he	245	" I alleged that often , when she spoke to me , she blushed , and that the sound of my name moved her .
221851	221871	219114	219114	he	245	" ' Not for your sake ! ' she declared briefly . I urged explanation , but could get none .
221872	221936	219114	219114	he	245	" ' When I sat beside you at the school feast , did you think I loved you then ? When I stopped you in Maythorn Lane , did you think I loved you then ? When I called on you in the counting - house , when I walked with you on the pavement , did you think I loved you then ? '
221937	221948	219114	219114	he	245	" So she questioned me ; and I said I did .
221949	221989	219114	219114	he	245	" By the Lord ! Yorke , she rose , she grew tall , she expanded and refined almost to flame . There was a trembling all through her , as in live coal when its vivid vermilion is hottest .
221990	222119	219114	219114	he	245	" ' That is to say that you have the worst opinion of me ; that you deny me the possession of all I value most . That is to say that I am a traitor to all my sisters ; that I have acted as no woman can act without degrading herself and her sex ; that I have sought where the incorrupt of my kind naturally scorn and abhor to seek . ' She and I were silent for many a minute . ' Lucifer , Star of the Morning , ' she went on , ' thou art fallen ! You , once high in my esteem , are hurled down ; you , once intimate in my friendship , are cast out . Go ! '
222120	222164	219114	219114	he	245	" I went not . I had heard her voice tremble , seen her lip quiver . I knew another storm of tears would fall , and then I believed some calm and some sunshine must come , and I would wait for it .
222165	222216	219114	219114	he	245	" As fast , but more quietly than before , the warm rain streamed down . There was another sound in her weeping - a softer , more regretful sound . While I watched , her eyes lifted to me a gaze more reproachful than haughty , more mournful than incensed .
222217	222236	219114	219114	he	245	" ' O Moore ! ' said she . It was worse than ' Et tu , Brute ! '
222237	222266	219114	219114	he	245	" I relieved myself by what should have been a sigh , but it became a groan . A sense of Cain - like desolation made my breast ache .
222267	222305	219114	219114	he	245	" ' There has been error in what I have done , ' I said , ' and it has won me bitter wages , which I will go and spend far from her who gave them . '
222306	222355	219114	219114	he	245	" I took my hat . All the time I could not have borne to depart so , and I believed she would not let me . Nor would she but for the mortal pang I had given her pride , that cowed her compassion and kept her silent .
222356	222385	219114	219114	he	245	" I was obliged to turn back of my own accord when I reached the door , to approach her , and to say , ' Forgive me . '
222386	222420	219114	219114	he	245	" ' I could , if there was not myself to forgive too , ' was her reply ; ' but to mislead a sagacious man so far I must have done wrong . '
222421	222466	219114	219114	he	245	" I broke out suddenly with some declamation I do not remember . I know that it was sincere , and that my wish and aim were to absolve her to herself . In fact , in her case self - accusation was a chimera .
222467	222498	219114	219114	he	245	" At last she extended her hand . For the first time I wished to take her in my arms and kiss her . I did kiss her hand many times .
222499	222564	219114	219114	he	245	" ' Some day we shall be friends again , ' she said , ' when you have had time to read my actions and motives in a true light , and not so horribly to misinterpret them . Time may give you the right key to all . Then , perhaps , you will comprehend me , and then we shall be reconciled . '
222565	222578	219114	219114	he	245	" Farewell drops rolled slow down her cheeks . She wiped them away .
222579	222608	222616	222617	Mr. Yorke	245	" ' I am sorry for what has happened - deeply sorry , ' she sobbed . So was I , God knows ! Thus were we severed . "
222609	222614	222629	222630	his companion	983	" A queer tale ! "
222619	222627	222629	222630	his companion	983	" I 'll do it no more , "
222632	222768	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" never more will I mention marriage to a woman unless I feel love . Henceforth credit and commerce may take care of themselves . Bankruptcy may come when it lists . I have done with slavish fear of disaster . I mean to work diligently , wait patiently , bear steadily . Let the worst come , I will take my axe and an emigrant 's berth , and go out with Louis to the West ; he and I have settled it . No woman shall ever again look at me as Miss Keeldar looked , ever again feel towards me as Miss Keeldar felt . In no woman 's presence will I ever again stand at once such a fool and such a knave , such a brute and such a puppy . "
222769	222772	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" Tut ! "
222778	222853	219114	219114	he	245	" you make too much of it ; but still , I say , I am capped . Firstly , that she did not love you ; and secondly , that you did not love her . You are both young ; you are both handsome ; you are both well enough for wit and even for temper - take you on the right side . What ailed you that you could not agree ? "
222854	223189	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" We never have been , never could be at home with each other , Yorke . Admire each other as we might at a distance , still we jarred when we came very near . I have sat at one side of a room and observed her at the other , perhaps in an excited , genial moment , when she had some of her favourites round her - her old beaux , for instance , yourself and Helstone , with whom she is so playful , pleasant , and eloquent . I have watched her when she was most natural , most lively , and most lovely ; my judgment has pronounced her beautiful . Beautiful she is at times , when her mood and her array partake of the splendid . I have drawn a little nearer , feeling that our terms of acquaintance gave me the right of approach . I have joined the circle round her seat , caught her eye , and mastered her attention ; then we have conversed ; and others , thinking me , perhaps , peculiarly privileged , have withdrawn by degrees , and left us alone . Were we happy thus left ? For myself , I must say No . Always a feeling of constraint came over me ; always I was disposed to be stern and strange . We talked politics and business . No soft sense of domestic intimacy ever opened our hearts , or thawed our language and made it flow easy and limpid . If we had confidences , they were confidences of the counting - house , not of the heart . Nothing in her cherished affection in me , made me better , gentler ; she only stirred my brain and whetted my acuteness . She never crept into my heart or influenced its pulse ; and for this good reason , no doubt , because I had not the secret of making her love me . "
223190	223287	219114	219114	he	245	" Well , lad , it is a queer thing . I might laugh at thee , and reckon to despise thy refinements ; but as it is dark night and we are by ourselves , I do n't mind telling thee that thy talk brings back a glimpse of my own past life . Twenty - five years ago I tried to persuade a beautiful woman to love me , and she would not . I had not the key to her nature ; she was a stone wall to me , doorless and windowless . "
223288	223320	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" But you loved her , Yorke ; you worshipped Mary Cave . Your conduct , after all , was that of a man - never of a fortune - hunter . "
223321	223369	219114	219114	he	245	" Ay , I did love her ; but then she was beautiful as the moon we do not see to - night . There is naught like her in these days . Miss Helstone , maybe , has a look of her , but nobody else . "
223370	223378	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" Who has a look of her ? "
223379	223476	219114	219114	he	245	" That black - coated tyrant 's niece - that quiet , delicate Miss Helstone . Many a time I have put on my spectacles to look at the lassie in church , because she has gentle blue een , wi ' long lashes ; and when she sits in shadow , and is very still and very pale , and is , happen , about to fall asleep wi ' the length of the sermon and the heat of the biggin ' , she is as like one of Canova 's marbles as aught else . "
223477	223485	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" Was Mary Cave in that style ? "
223486	223522	219114	219114	he	245	" Far grander ! - less lass - like and flesh - like . You wondered why she had n't wings and a crown . She was a stately , peaceful angel was my Mary . "
223523	223534	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" And you could not persuade her to love you ? "
223535	223560	219114	219114	he	245	" Not with all I could do , though I prayed Heaven many a time , on my bended knees , to help me . "
223561	223622	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" Mary Cave was not what you think her , Yorke . I have seen her picture at the rectory . She is no angel , but a fair , regular - featured , taciturn - looking woman - rather too white and lifeless for my taste . But , supposing she had been something better than she was - - "
223623	223626	222774	222776	the imperturbable Yorke	245	" Robert , "
223630	223717	219114	219114	he	245	" I could fell you off your horse at this moment . However , I 'll hold my hand . Reason tells me you are right and I am wrong . I know well enough that the passion I still have is only the remnant of an illusion . If Miss Cave had possessed either feeling or sense , she could not have been so perfectly impassible to my regard as she showed herself ; she must have preferred me to that copper - faced despot . "
223718	224058	224089	224089	his	245	" Supposing , Yorke , she had been educated no women were educated in those days ; supposing she had possessed a thoughtful , original mind , a love of knowledge , a wish for information , which she took an artless delight in receiving from your lips , and having measured out to her by your hand ; supposing her conversation , when she sat at your side , was fertile , varied , imbued with a picturesque grace and genial interest , quiet flowing but clear and bounteous ; supposing that when you stood near her by chance , or when you sat near her by design , comfort at once became your atmosphere , and content your element ; supposing that whenever her face was under your gaze , or her idea filled your thoughts , you gradually ceased to be hard and anxious , and pure affection , love of home , thirst for sweet discourse , unselfish longing to protect and cherish , replaced the sordid , cankering calculations of your trade ; supposing , with all this , that many a time , when you had been so happy as to possess your Mary 's little hand , you had felt it tremble as you held it , just as a warm little bird trembles when you take it from its nest ; supposing you had noticed her shrink into the background on your entrance into a room , yet if you sought her in her retreat she welcomed you with the sweetest smile that ever lit a fair virgin face , and only turned her eyes from the encounter of your own lest their clearness should reveal too much ; supposing , in short , your Mary had been not cold , but modest ; not vacant , but reflective ; not obtuse , but sensitive ; not inane , but innocent ; not prudish , but pure , - would you have left her to court another woman for her wealth ? "
224072	224078	224089	224089	his	245	" The moon is up , "
224095	224155	224193	224193	he	245	" There she is , rising into the haze , staring at us wi ' a strange red glower . She is no more silver than old Helstone 's brow is ivory . What does she mean by leaning her cheek on Rushedge i ' that way , and looking at us wi ' a scowl and a menace ? "
224156	224187	224193	224193	he	245	" Yorke , if Mary had loved you silently yet faithfully , chastely yet fervently , as you would wish your wife to love , would you have left her ? "
224188	224191	224341	224341	he	245	" Robert ! "
224206	224340	224341	224341	he	245	" Robert ! this is a queer world , and men are made of the queerest dregs that Chaos churned up in her ferment . I might swear sounding oaths - oaths that would make the poachers think there was a bittern booming in Bilberry Moss - that , in the case you put , death only should have parted me from Mary . But I have lived in the world fifty - five years ; I have been forced to study human nature ; and , to speak a dark truth , the odds are , if Mary had loved and not scorned me , if I had been secure of her affection , certain of her constancy , been irritated by no doubts , stung by no humiliations - the odds are "
224351	224361	224370	224370	Ere	4770	" the odds are I should have left her ! "
224415	224537	224370	224370	Ere	4770	" I believe - I daily find it proved - that we can get nothing in this world worth keeping , not so much as a principle or a conviction , except out of purifying flame or through strengthening peril . We err , we fall , we are humbled ; then we walk more carefully . We greedily eat and drink poison out of the gilded cup of vice or from the beggar 's wallet of avarice . We are sickened , degraded ; everything good in us rebels against us ; our souls rise bitterly indignant against our bodies ; there is a period of civil war ; if the soul has strength , it conquers and rules thereafter . "
224538	224554	224925	224925	he	4773	" What art thou going to do now , Robert ? What are thy plans ? "
224555	224924	224965	224965	Moore	481	" For my private plans , I 'll keep them to myself - which is very easy , as at present I have none . No private life is permitted a man in my position - a man in debt . For my public plans , my views are a little altered . While I was in Birmingham I looked a little into reality , considered closely and at their source the causes of the present troubles of this country . I did the same in London . Unknown , I could go where I pleased , mix with whom I would . I went where there was want of food , of fuel , of clothing ; where there was no occupation and no hope . I saw some , with naturally elevated tendencies and good feelings , kept down amongst sordid privations and harassing griefs . I saw many originally low , and to whom lack of education left scarcely anything but animal wants , disappointed in those wants , ahungered , athirst , and desperate as famished animals . I saw what taught my brain a new lesson , and filled my breast with fresh feelings . I have no intention to profess more softness or sentiment than I have hitherto professed ; mutiny and ambition I regard as I have always regarded them . I should resist a riotous mob just as heretofore ; I should open on the scent of a runaway ringleader as eagerly as ever , and run him down as relentlessly , and follow him up to condign punishment as rigorously ; but I should do it now chiefly for the sake and the security of those he misled . Something there is to look to , Yorke , beyond a man 's personal interest , beyond the advancement of well - laid schemes , beyond even the discharge of dishonouring debts . To respect himself , a man must believe he renders justice to his fellow - men . Unless I am more considerate to ignorance , more forbearing to suffering , than I have hitherto been , I shall scorn myself as grossly unjust . - What now ? "
224960	224963	224965	224965	Moore	481	" Yorke , "
224967	224977	225063	225068	a voice speak behind the wall	4780	" ride on ; I must let him drink . "
225078	225087	225063	225068	a voice speak behind the wall	4780	" When the wicked perisheth there is shouting , "
225094	225106	225063	225068	a voice speak behind the wall	4780	" As the whirlwind passeth , so is the wicked no more "
225112	225133	225329	225329	She	372	" terrors take hold of him as waters ; hell is naked before him . He shall die without knowledge . "
225336	225340	225695	225695	Her	4799	" le Professeur Louis "
225699	225722	226263	226264	Louis Moore	539	" This woman is not of mine or my daughters ' kind . I object to her as my son 's wife . "
226256	226262	226495	226495	she	372	" In Sir Philip Nunnely ? "
226498	226501	226663	226663	He	487	" Yes . "
226670	226675	226694	226694	she	372	" strictly private interview . "
226687	226693	226793	226794	Mr. Sympson	487	" Very well , sir , "
226782	226791	226830	226830	he	487	" I have been to De Walden Hall , "
226824	226829	226830	226830	he	487	" I have learned , "
226835	226845	226830	226830	he	487	" I have learned a circumstance which surprises me . "
226861	226906	226912	226912	Shirley	372	" It seems that Nunnely Priory is shut up - that the family are gone back to their place in - - shire . It seems that the baronet - that the baronet - that Sir Philip himself has accompanied his mother and sisters . "
226907	226910	226830	226830	he	487	" Indeed ! "
226914	226930	226830	226830	he	487	" May I ask if you share the amazement with which I received this news ? "
226931	226936	226830	226830	he	487	" No , sir . "
226937	226944	226830	226830	he	487	" Is it news to you ? "
226945	226950	226960	226961	Mr. Sympson	487	" Yes , sir . "
226951	226958	226981	226981	his	487	" I mean - I mean , "
226990	227048	227111	227111	Shirley	372	" I mean to have a thorough explanation . I will not be put off . I - I - shall insist on being heard , and on - on having my own way . My questions must be answered . I will have clear , satisfactory replies . I am not to be trifled with . Silence .
227049	227086	226981	226981	his	487	" It is a strange and an extraordinary thing - a very singular - a most odd thing ! I thought all was right , knew no other ; and there - the family are gone ! "
227087	227100	227111	227111	Shirley	372	" I suppose , sir , they had a right to go . "
227101	227107	227122	227122	she	372	" Sir Philip is gone ! "
227116	227120	227122	227122	she	372	" Bon voyage ! "
227124	227137	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" This will not do ; this must be altered , ma'am . "
227158	227166	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Come , come now , uncle , "
227170	227215	227144	227144	he	487	" do not begin to fret and fume , or we shall make no sense of the business . Ask me what you want to know . I am as willing to come to an explanation as you . I promise you truthful replies . "
227216	227237	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I want - I demand to know , Miss Keeldar , whether Sir Philip has made you an offer ? "
227238	227242	227144	227144	he	487	" He has . "
227243	227248	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You avow it ? "
227249	227265	227144	227144	he	487	" I avow it . But now , go on . Consider that point settled . "
227266	227280	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" He made you an offer that night we dined at the priory ? "
227281	227295	227144	227144	he	487	" It is enough to say that he made it . Go on . "
227296	227323	227144	227144	he	487	" He proposed in the recess - in the room that used to be a picture - gallery - that Sir Monckton converted into it saloon ? "
227327	227370	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You were both examining a cabinet . I saw it all . My sagacity was not at fault - it never is . Subsequently you received a letter from him . On what subject - of what nature were the contents ? "
227371	227375	227144	227144	he	487	" No matter . "
227376	227390	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Ma'am , is that the way in which you speak to me ? "
227400	227415	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" There you sit , silent and sullen - you who promised truthful replies . "
227416	227428	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Sir , I have answered you thus far . Proceed . "
227429	227438	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I should like to see that letter . "
227439	227446	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You can not see it . "
227447	227460	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I must and shall , ma'am ; I am your guardian . "
227461	227474	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Having ceased to be a ward , I have no guardian . "
227475	227488	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Ungrateful being ! Reared by me as my own daughter - - "
227489	227577	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Once more , uncle , have the kindness to keep to the point . Let us both remain cool . For my part , I do not wish to get into a passion ; but , you know , once drive me beyond certain bounds , I care little what I say - I am not then soon checked . Listen ! You have asked me whether Sir Philip made me an offer . That question is answered . What do you wish to know next ? "
227578	227596	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I desire to know whether you accepted or refused him , and know it I will . "
227597	227610	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Certainly , you ought to know it . I refused him . "
227611	227627	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Refused him ! You - you , Shirley Keeldar , refused Sir Philip Nunnely ? "
227628	227632	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I did . "
227651	227664	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" There it is ! There it is ! There it is ! "
227665	227680	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Sincerely speaking , I am sorry , uncle , you are so disappointed . "
227713	227741	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I disappointed ? What is it to me ? Have I an interest in it ? You would insinuate , perhaps , that I have motives ? "
227742	227754	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Most people have motives of some sort for their actions . "
227755	227779	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" She accuses me to my face ! I , that have been a parent to her , she charges with bad motives ! "
227780	227788	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Bad motives I did not say . "
227789	227800	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" And now you prevaricate ; you have no principles ! "
227801	227814	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Uncle , you tire me . I want to go away . "
227815	227834	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Go you shall not ! I will be answered . What are your intentions , Miss Keeldar ? "
227835	227840	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" In what respect ? "
227841	227847	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" In respect of matrimony ? "
227848	227861	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" To be quiet , and to do just as I please . "
227862	227877	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Just as you please ! The words are to the last degree indecorous . "
227878	227898	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Mr. Sympson , I advise you not to become insulting . You know I will not bear that . "
227899	227918	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You read French . Your mind is poisoned with French novels . You have imbibed French principles . "
227919	227937	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" The ground you are treading now returns a mighty hollow sound under your feet . Beware ! "
227938	227956	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" It will end in infamy , sooner or later . I have foreseen it all along . "
227957	227976	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Do you assert , sir , that something in which I am concerned will end in infamy ? "
227977	228005	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" That it will - that it will . You said just now you would act as you please . You acknowledge no rules - no limitations . "
228006	228015	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Silly stuff , and vulgar as silly ! "
228016	228032	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Regardless of decorum , you are prepared to fly in the face of propriety . "
228033	228040	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You tire me , uncle . "
228041	228056	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" What , madam - what could be your reasons for refusing Sir Philip ? "
228057	228126	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" At last there is another sensible question ; I shall be glad to reply to it . Sir Philip is too young for me . I regard him as a boy . All his relations - his mother especially - would be annoyed if he married me . Such a step would embroil him with them . I am not his equal in the world 's estimation . "
228127	228132	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Is that all ? "
228133	228140	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Our dispositions are not compatible . "
228141	228151	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Why , a more amiable gentleman never breathed . "
228152	228207	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" He is very amiable - very excellent - truly estimable ; but not my master - not in one point . I could not trust myself with his happiness . I would not undertake the keeping of it for thousands . I will accept no hand which can not hold me in check . "
228208	228224	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I thought you liked to do as you please . You are vastly inconsistent . "
228225	228284	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" When I promise to obey , it shall be under the conviction that I can keep that promise . I could not obey a youth like Sir Philip . Besides , he would never command me . He would expect me always to rule - to guide - and I have no taste whatever for the office . "
228285	228301	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You no taste for swaggering , and subduing , and ordering , and ruling ? "
228302	228311	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Not my husband ; only my uncle . "
228312	228318	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Where is the difference ? "
228319	228356	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" There is a slight difference - that is certain . And I know full well any man who wishes to live in decent comfort with me as a husband must be able to control me . "
228357	228366	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I wish you had a real tyrant . "
228367	228394	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" A tyrant would not hold me for a day , not for an hour . I would rebel - break from him - defy him . "
228395	228411	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Are you not enough to bewilder one 's brain with your self - contradiction ? "
228412	228421	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" It is evident I bewilder your brain . "
228422	228439	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You talk of Sir Philip being young . He is two - and - twenty . "
228440	228453	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" My husband must be thirty , with the sense of forty . "
228454	228474	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You had better pick out some old man - some white - headed or bald - headed swain . "
228475	228481	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" No , thank you . "
228482	228498	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You could lead some doting fool ; you might pin him to your apron . "
228499	228576	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I might do that with a boy ; but it is not my vocation . Did I not say I prefer a master - one in whose presence I shall feel obliged and disposed to be good ; one whose control my impatient temper must acknowledge ; a man whose approbation can reward , whose displeasure punish me ; a man I shall feel it impossible not to love , and very possible to fear ? "
228577	228640	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" What is there to hinder you from doing all this with Sir Philip ? He is a baronet - a man of rank , property , connections far above yours . If you talk of intellect , he is a poet - he writes verses ; which you , I take it , can not do , with all your cleverness . "
228641	228691	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Neither his title , wealth , pedigree , nor poetry avail to invest him with the power I describe . These are feather - weights ; they want ballast . A measure of sound , solid , practical sense would have stood him in better stead with me . "
228692	228716	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You and Henry rave about poetry ! You used to catch fire like tinder on the subject when you were a girl . "
228717	228744	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" O uncle , there is nothing really valuable in this world , there is nothing glorious in the world to come that is not poetry ! "
228745	228757	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Marry a poet , then , in God 's name ! "
228758	228767	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Show him me , and I will . "
228768	228772	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Sir Philip . "
228773	228788	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Not at all . You are almost as good a poet as he . "
228789	228799	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Madam , you are wandering from the point . "
228800	228841	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Indeed , uncle , I wanted to do so , and I shall be glad to lead you away with me . Do not let us get out of temper with each other ; it is not worth while . "
228842	228862	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Out of temper , Miss Keeldar ! I should be glad to know who is out of temper . "
228863	228870	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I am not , yet . "
228871	228890	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" If you mean to insinuate that I am , I consider that you are guilty of impertinence . "
228891	228905	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You will be soon , if you go on at that rate . "
228906	228924	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" There it is ! With your pert tongue you would try the patience of a Job . "
228925	228931	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I know I should . "
228932	229001	229030	229031	Mr. Sympson	487	" No levity , miss ! This is not a laughing matter . It is an affair I am resolved to probe thoroughly , convinced that there is mischief at the bottom . You described just now , with far too much freedom for your years and sex , the sort of individual you would prefer as a husband . Pray , did you paint from the life ? "
229018	229028	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I shall have an answer to that question , "
229047	229060	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" It was an historical picture , uncle , from several originals . "
229061	229069	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Several originals ! Bless my heart ! "
229070	229079	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I have been in love several times . "
229080	229085	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" This is cynical . "
229086	229093	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" With heroes of many nations . "
229094	229099	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" What next - - "
229100	229104	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" And philosophers . "
229105	229111	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" She is mad - - "
229112	229127	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Do n't ring the bell , uncle ; you will alarm my aunt . "
229128	229140	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Your poor dear aunt , what a niece has she ! "
229141	229147	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Once I loved Socrates . "
229148	229156	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Pooh ! no trifling , ma'am . "
229157	229166	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I admired Themistocles , Leonidas , Epaminondas . "
229167	229172	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Miss Keeldar - - "
229173	229201	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" To pass over a few centuries , Washington was a plain man , but I liked him ; but to speak of the actual present - - "
229202	229209	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Ah ! the actual present . "
229210	229222	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" To quit crude schoolgirl fancies , and come to realities . "
229223	229239	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Realities ! That is the test to which you shall be brought , ma'am . "
229240	229260	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" To avow before what altar I now kneel - to reveal the present idol of my soul - - "
229261	229284	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You will make haste about it , if you please . It is near luncheon time , and confess you shall . "
229285	229322	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Confess I must . My heart is full of the secret . It must be spoken . I only wish you were Mr. Helstone instead of Mr. Sympson ; you would sympathize with me better . "
229323	229355	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Madam , it is a question of common sense and common prudence , not of sympathy and sentiment , and so on . Did you say it was Mr. Helstone ? "
229356	229372	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Not precisely , but as near as may be ; they are rather alike . "
229373	229385	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I will know the name ; I will have particulars . "
229386	229446	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" They positively are rather alike . Their very faces are not dissimilar - a pair of human falcons - and dry , direct , decided both . But my hero is the mightier of the two . His mind has the clearness of the deep sea , the patience of its rocks , the force of its billows . "
229447	229452	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Rant and fustian ! "
229453	229473	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I dare say he can be harsh as a saw - edge and gruff as a hungry raven . "
229474	229489	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Miss Keeldar , does the person reside in Briarfield ? Answer me that . "
229490	229508	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Uncle , I am going to tell you ; his name is trembling on my tongue . "
229509	229514	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Speak , girl ! "
229515	229571	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" That was well said , uncle . ' Speak , girl ! ' It is quite tragic . England has howled savagely against this man , uncle , and she will one day roar exultingly over him . He has been unscared by the howl , and he will be unelated by the shout . "
229572	229582	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I said she was mad . She is . "
229583	229622	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" This country will change and change again in her demeanour to him ; he will never change in his duty to her . Come , cease to chafe , uncle , I 'll tell you his name . "
229623	229632	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You shall tell me , or - - "
229633	229642	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Listen ! Arthur Wellesley , Lord Wellington . "
229671	229697	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Ma'am , you shall tell me this . Will your principles permit you to marry a man without money - a man below you ? "
229698	229705	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Never a man below me . "
229711	229723	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Will you , Miss Keeldar , marry a poor man ? "
229724	229737	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" What right have you , Mr. Sympson , to ask me ? "
229738	229744	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I insist upon knowing . "
229745	229755	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You do n't go the way to know . "
229756	229765	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" My family respectability shall not be compromised . "
229766	229774	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" A good resolution ; keep it . "
229775	229786	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Madam , it is you who shall keep it . "
229787	229801	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Impossible , sir , since I form no part of your family . "
229802	229808	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Do you disown us ? "
229809	229815	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I disdain your dictatorship . "
229816	229825	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Whom will you marry , Miss Keeldar ? "
229826	229848	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Not Mr. Sam Wynne , because I scorn him ; not Sir Philip Nunnely , because I only esteem him . "
229849	229857	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Whom have you in your eye ? "
229858	229863	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Four rejected candidates . "
229864	229877	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Such obstinacy could not be unless you were under improper influence . "
229878	229906	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" What do you mean ? There are certain phrases potent to make my blood boil . Improper influence ! What old woman 's cackle is that ? "
229907	229914	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Are you a young lady ? "
229915	229937	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I am a thousand times better : I am an honest woman , and as such I will be treated . "
229938	229942	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Do you know "
229953	229976	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" do you know the whole neighbourhood teems with rumours respecting you and a bankrupt tenant of yours , the foreigner Moore ? "
229977	229981	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Does it ? "
229982	229993	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" It does . Your name is in every mouth . "
229994	230013	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" It honours the lips it crosses , and I wish to the gods it may purify them . "
230014	230026	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Is it that person who has power to influence you ? "
230027	230036	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Beyond any whose cause you have advocated . "
230037	230045	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Is it he you will marry ? "
230046	230057	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" He is handsome , and manly , and commanding . "
230058	230074	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You declare it to my face ! The Flemish knave ! the low trader ! "
230075	230098	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" He is talented , and venturous , and resolute . Prince is on his brow , and ruler in his bearing . "
230099	230115	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" She glories in it ! She conceals nothing ! No shame , no fear ! "
230116	230141	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" When we speak the name of Moore , shame should be forgotten and fear discarded . The Moores know only honour and courage . "
230142	230149	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" I say she is mad . "
230150	230170	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You have taunted me till my blood is up ; you have worried me till I turn again . "
230171	230192	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" That Moore is the brother of my son 's tutor . Would you let the usher call you sister ? "
230209	230228	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" No , no ; not for a province of possession , not for a century of life . "
230229	230240	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" You can not separate the husband from his family . "
230241	230245	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" What then ? "
230246	230256	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" Mr. Louis Moore 's sister you will be . "
230257	230331	230338	230338	she	4848	" Mr. Sympson , I am sick at heart with all this weak trash ; I will bear no more . Your thoughts are not my thoughts , your aims are not my aims , your gods are not my gods . We do not view things in the same light ; we do not measure them by the same standard ; we hardly speak in the same tongue . Let us part . "
230332	230337	230338	230338	she	4848	" It is not , "
230344	230470	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" it is not that I hate you ; you are a good sort of man . Perhaps you mean well in your way . But we can not suit ; we are ever at variance . You annoy me with small meddling , with petty tyranny ; you exasperate my temper , and make and keep me passionate . As to your small maxims , your narrow rules , your little prejudices , aversions , dogmas , bundle them off . Mr. Sympson , go , offer them a sacrifice to the deity you worship ; I 'll none of them . I wash my hands of the lot . I walk by another creed , light , faith , and hope than you . "
230471	230482	230338	230338	she	4848	" Another creed ! I believe she is an infidel . "
230483	230496	227168	227168	Shirley	372	" An infidel to your religion , an atheist to your god . "
230497	230504	230338	230338	she	4848	" An - atheist ! ! ! "
230505	230778	230924	230924	he	487	" Your god , sir , is the world . In my eyes you too , if not an infidel , are an idolater . I conceive that you ignorantly worship ; in all things you appear to me too superstitious . Sir , your god , your great Bel , your fish - tailed Dagon , rises before me as a demon . You , and such as you , have raised him to a throne , put on him a crown , given him a sceptre . Behold how hideously he governs ! See him busied at the work he likes best - making marriages . He binds the young to the old , the strong to the imbecile . He stretches out the arm of Mezentius , and fetters the dead to the living . In his realm there is hatred - secret hatred ; there is disgust - unspoken disgust ; there is treachery - family treachery ; there is vice - deep , deadly domestic vice . In his dominions children grow unloving between parents who have never loved ; infants are nursed on deception from their very birth ; they are reared in an atmosphere corrupt with lies . Your god rules at the bridal of kings ; look at your royal dynasties ! Your deity is the deity of foreign aristocracies ; analyze the blue blood of Spain ! Your god is the Hymen of France ; what is French domestic life ? All that surrounds him hastens to decay ; all declines and degenerates under his sceptre . Your god is a masked Death . "
230779	230827	230338	230338	she	4848	" This language is terrible ! My daughters and you must associate no longer , Miss Keeldar ; there is danger in such companionship . Had I known you a little earlier - but , extraordinary as I thought you , I could not have believed - - "
230828	230908	230924	230924	he	487	" Now , sir , do you begin to be aware that it is useless to scheme for me ; that in doing so you but sow the wind to reap the whirlwind ? I sweep your cobweb projects from my path , that I may pass on unsullied . I am anchored on a resolve you can not shake . My heart , my conscience shall dispose of my hand - they only . Know this at last . "
230917	230923	230924	230924	he	487	" Never heard such language ! "
230930	230944	230338	230338	she	4848	" never was so addressed in my life - never was so used ! "
230945	230962	230963	230963	He	487	" You are quite confused , sir . You had better withdraw , or I will . "
230967	230981	230924	230924	he	487	" We must leave this place ; they must pack up at once . "
230982	230995	230963	230963	He	487	" Do not hurry my aunt and cousins ; give them time . "
230996	231006	231090	231090	Shirley	372	" No more intercourse ; she 's not proper . "
231076	231088	231105	231105	she	372	" Poor Mr. Sympson ! he is both feeble and vulgar , "
231094	231104	231160	231161	The intruder	4852	" My head aches , and I am tired , "
231171	231175	231355	231356	Louis Moore	497	" Miss Keeldar . "
231330	231334	231384	231384	she	372	" Miss Keeldar , "
231378	231383	231384	231384	she	372	" O Mr. Moore ! "
231387	231403	231355	231356	Louis Moore	497	" I was afraid it was my uncle again : he and I have quarrelled . "
231404	231412	231355	231356	Louis Moore	497	" Mr. Sympson should let you alone , "
231417	231431	231384	231384	she	372	" Can he not see that you are as yet far from strong ? "
231432	231452	231355	231356	Louis Moore	497	" I assure you he did not find me weak . I did not cry when he was here . "
231453	231502	231384	231384	she	372	" He is about to evacuate Fieldhead - so he says . He is now giving orders to his family . He has been in the schoolroom issuing commands in a manner which , I suppose , was a continuation of that with which he has harassed you . "
231503	231511	231660	231660	he	4857	" Are you and Henry to go ? "
231512	231658	231384	231384	she	372	" I believe , as far as Henry is concerned , that was the tenor of his scarcely intelligible directions ; but he may change all to - morrow . He is just in that mood when you can not depend on his consistency for two consecutive hours . I doubt whether he will leave you for weeks yet . To myself he addressed some words which will require a little attention and comment by - and - by , when I have time to bestow on them . At the moment he came in I was busied with a note I had got from Mr. Yorke - so fully busied that I cut short the interview with him somewhat abruptly . I left him raving . Here is the note . I wish you to see it . It refers to my brother Robert . "
231665	231681	231384	231384	she	372	" I shall be glad to hear news of him . Is he coming home ? "
231682	231703	231384	231384	she	372	" He is come . He is in Yorkshire . Mr. Yorke went yesterday to Stilbro ' to meet him . "
231704	231713	231384	231384	she	372	" Mr. Moore , something is wrong - - "
231714	231734	231384	231384	she	372	" Did my voice tremble ? He is now at Briarmains , and I am going to see him . "
231735	231740	231384	231384	she	372	" What has occurred ? "
231741	231770	231384	231384	she	372	" If you turn so pale I shall be sorry I have spoken . It might have been worse . Robert is not dead , but much hurt . "
231771	231787	231384	231384	she	372	" O sir , it is you who are pale . Sit down near me . "
231788	231798	231865	231866	Mr. Yorke	245	" Read the note . Let me open it . "
231860	231864	231865	231866	Mr. Yorke	245	" No doubt , "
231869	231896	231906	231906	Louis	497	" it was done in revenge . It was a pity ill - will had ever been raised ; but that could not be helped now . "
231897	231904	231906	231906	Louis	497	" He is my only brother , "
231914	231943	231865	231866	Mr. Yorke	245	" I can not hear unmoved that ruffians have laid in wait for him , and shot him down , like some wild beast from behind a wall . "
231944	231961	232003	232003	he	497	" Be comforted ; be hopeful . He will get better - I know he will . "
231994	232002	232003	232003	he	497	" Well , give me your hand , "
232006	232027	232049	232049	he	497	" It will be for the first time ; it is in a moment of calamity . Give it me . "
232040	232048	232049	232049	he	497	" I am going to Briarmains now , "
232053	232084	232090	232090	Shirley	372	" I want you to step over to the rectory and tell Caroline Helstone what has happened . Will you do this ? She will hear it best from you . "
232085	232088	232090	232090	Shirley	372	" Immediately , "
232096	232107	232049	232049	he	497	" Ought I to say that there is no danger ? "
232108	232112	232090	232090	Shirley	372	" Say so . "
232113	232126	232049	232049	he	497	" You will come back soon , and let me know more ? "
232127	232135	232090	232090	Shirley	372	" I will either come or write . "
232136	232160	232049	232049	he	497	" Trust me for watching over Caroline . I will communicate with your sister too ; but doubtless she is already with Robert ? "
232161	232174	232090	232090	Shirley	372	" Doubtless , or will be soon . Good - morning now . "
232175	232185	232049	232049	he	497	" You will bear up , come what may . "
232186	232192	232233	232233	he	497	" We shall see that . "
232221	232232	232237	232237	he	497	" I thought I should have had to support her , "
232242	232331	232582	232582	her	4876	" and it is she who has made me strong . That look of pity , that gentle touch ! No down was ever softer , no elixir more potent ! It lay like a snowflake ; it thrilled like lightning . A thousand times I have longed to possess that hand - to have it in mine . I have possessed it ; for five minutes I held it . Her fingers and mine can never be strangers more . Having met once they must meet again . "

234187	234190	234183	234183	she	575	" my dear "
234192	234195	234216	234216	she	575	" honey , "
234223	234226	234268	234268	he	481	" Hush ! "
234273	234282	234299	234299	he	481	" that woman was a dram - drinker . "
234283	234295	234314	234315	the surgeon	4944	" Pooh ! my dear sir , they are all so , "
234305	234312	234314	234315	the surgeon	4944	" But Horsfall has this virtue , "
234317	234329	234489	234489	I	0	" drunk or sober , she always remembers to obey me . "
234498	234500	235444	235444	she	2491	" Reflections "
235448	235458	235492	235492	he	345	" Are you one of Mr. Yorke 's sons ? "
235487	235491	235492	235492	he	345	" I am , "
235509	235517	235605	235606	a lady	6533	" You are Martin , I think ? "
235610	235613	235672	235672	he	345	" Martin , "
235666	235671	235687	235687	she	6533	" I am Martin , "
235675	235683	235687	235687	she	6533	" Are your father and mother well ? "
235701	235707	235749	235750	the lady	2491	" and Rose and Jessie ? "
235708	235713	235687	235687	she	6533	" I suppose so . "
235714	235723	235749	235750	the lady	2491	" My cousin Hortense is still at Briarmains ? "
235724	235728	235687	235687	she	6533	" Oh yes . "
235771	235778	235687	235687	she	6533	" Does your mother like her ? "
235779	235795	235687	235687	she	6533	" They suit so well about the servants they ca n't help liking each other . "
235796	235804	235687	235687	she	6533	" It is cold to - night . "
235805	235813	235687	235687	she	6533	" Why are you out so late ? "
235814	235823	235687	235687	she	6533	" I lost my way in this wood . "
235837	235856	235687	235687	she	6533	" Lost your way in the mighty forest of Briarmains ! You deserve never more to find it . "
235857	235895	235687	235687	she	6533	" I never was here before , and I believe I am trespassing now . You might inform against me if you chose , Martin , and have me fined . It is your father 's wood . "
235896	235922	235687	235687	she	6533	" I should think I knew that . But since you are so simple as to lose your way , I will guide you out . "
235923	235942	235687	235687	she	6533	" You need not . I have got into the track now . I shall be right . Martin "
235947	235953	235989	235989	She	5015	" how is Mr. Moore ? "
235973	235988	235995	235995	She	5015	" Going to die . Nothing can save him . All hope flung overboard ! "
236004	236008	235995	235995	She	5015	" To die ! "
236009	236068	236142	236142	He	576	" To die . All along of the women , my mother and the rest . They did something about his bandages that finished everything . He would have got better but for them . I am sure they should be arrested , cribbed , tried , and brought in for Botany Bay , at the very least . "
236145	236149	236157	236157	He	576	" Miss Helstone ! "
236164	236175	236157	236157	He	576	" Come ; are you uneasy about what I said ? "
236176	236199	236157	236157	He	576	" You know nothing about death , Martin ; you are too young for me to talk to concerning such a thing . "
236200	236271	236157	236157	He	576	" Did you believe me ? It 's all flummery ! Moore eats like three men . They are always making sago or tapioca or something good for him . I never go into the kitchen but there is a saucepan on the fire , cooking him some dainty . I think I will play the old soldier , and be fed on the fat of the land like him . "
236272	236277	236284	236284	she	5018	" Martin ! Martin ! "
236287	236303	236338	236338	he	576	" It is exceedingly wrong of you , Martin . You have almost killed me . "
236344	236346	236456	236456	he	576	" nuts "
236452	236455	236483	236483	he	576	" Eureka ! "
236459	236482	236509	236509	he	576	" I 'll set all straight by - and - by . You are better now , Miss Caroline . Walk forward , "
236553	236577	236509	236509	he	576	" Martin , before we separate , assure me seriously , and on your word of honour , that Mr. Moore is better . "
236578	236588	236509	236509	he	576	" How very much you think of that Moore ! "
236589	236614	236509	236509	he	576	" No - but - many of his friends may ask me , and I wish to be able to give an authentic answer . "
236615	236666	236509	236509	he	576	" You may tell them he is well enough , only idle . You may tell them that he takes mutton chops for dinner , and the best of arrowroot for supper . I intercepted a basin myself one night on its way upstairs , and ate half of it . "
236667	236680	236509	236509	he	576	" And who waits on him , Martin ? who nurses him ? "
236681	236843	236509	236509	he	576	" Nurses him ? The great baby ! Why , a woman as round and big as our largest water - butt - a rough , hard - favoured old girl . I make no doubt she leads him a rich life . Nobody else is let near him . He is chiefly in the dark . It is my belief she knocks him about terribly in that chamber . I listen at the wall sometimes when I am in bed , and I think I hear her thumping him . You should see her fist . She could hold half a dozen hands like yours in her one palm . After all , notwithstanding the chops and jellies he gets , I would not be in his shoes . In fact , it is my private opinion that she eats most of what goes up on the tray to Mr. Moore . I wish she may not be starving him . "
236861	236872	236509	236509	he	576	" You never see him , I suppose , Martin ? "
236873	236891	236921	236921	Martin	576	" I ? No . I do n't care to see him , for my own part . "
236895	236918	236509	236509	he	576	" Did not you come to our house once with Mrs. Pryor , about five weeks since , to ask after him ? "
236923	236926	236509	236509	he	576	" Yes . "
236927	236938	236509	236509	he	576	" I dare say you wished to be shown upstairs ? "
236939	236954	236509	236509	he	576	" We did wish it . We entreated it ; but your mother declined . "
236955	236989	236509	236509	he	576	" Ay ! she declined . I heard it all . She treated you as it is her pleasure to treat visitors now and then . She behaved to you rudely and harshly . "
236990	237033	236509	236509	he	576	" She was not kind ; for you know , Martin , we are relations , and it is natural we should take an interest in Mr. Moore . But here we must part ; we are at your father 's gate . "
237034	237049	236509	236509	he	576	" Very well , what of that ? I shall walk home with you . "
237050	237062	236509	236509	he	576	" They will miss you , and wonder where you are . "
237063	237077	237308	237308	he	576	" Let them . I can take care of myself , I suppose . "
237301	237307	237308	237308	he	576	" She looked like that , "
237317	237331	237337	237337	he	576	" when she sobbed , turned white , and leaned against the tree . "
237332	237336	237337	237337	he	576	" I suppose , "
237358	237630	238165	238165	He	343	" I suppose she is what they call ' in love ' - yes , in love with that long thing in the next chamber . Whisht ! is that Horsfall clattering him ? I wonder he does not yell out . It really sounds as if she had fallen on him tooth and nail ; but I suppose she is making the bed . I saw her at it once . She hit into the mattresses as if she was boxing . It is queer , Zillah they call her Zillah - Zillah Horsfall is a woman , and Caroline Helstone is a woman ; they are two individuals of the same species - not much alike though . Is she a pretty girl , that Caroline ? I suspect she is ; very nice to look at - something so clear in her face , so soft in her eyes . I approve of her looking at me ; it does me good . She has long eyelashes . Their shadow seems to rest where she gazes , and to instil peace and thought . If she behaves well , and continues to suit me as she has suited me to - day , I may do her a good turn . I rather relish the notion of circumventing my mother and that ogress old Horsfall . Not that I like humouring Moore ; but whatever I do I 'll be paid for , and in coin of my own choosing . I know what reward I will claim - one displeasing to Moore , and agreeable to myself . "
238178	238241	238458	238458	he	245	" had been very distinctly audible , and the succession to the armchair and newspaper had appeared to affect him with mental spasms . The spectacle now before him - the apples , the tarts , the tea - cakes , the fowl , ham , and pudding - offered evidence but too well calculated to inflate his opinion of his own sagacity .
238453	238456	238458	238458	he	245	" Sons , "
238460	238483	238560	238560	he	576	" one of you must leave my roof if this occurs again . I will have no Cain and Abel strife here . "
238546	238559	238597	238597	he	576	" It is not worth while to bother myself for that Caroline , "
238593	238596	238597	238597	he	576	" Yes , "
238600	238633	238901	238902	the nurse	4117	" I made her sob , shudder , almost faint . I 'll see her smile before I 've done with her ; besides , I want to outwit all these womenites . "
238905	238937	239086	239086	he	576	" If you please , ma'am , you are invited to step into the back parlour and take some refreshment . You will not be disturbed ; the family are out . "
239078	239085	239102	239102	he	576	" She is long in coming , "
239097	239101	239102	239102	he	576	" I wonder , "
239105	239143	239153	239153	he	576	" what I wish to see her so much for ? She is not coming for me . But I have power over her , and I want her to come that I may use that power . "
239149	239152	239153	239153	he	576	" Now , "
239163	239177	239251	239251	she	5076	" if she fails to come , I shall hate and scorn her . "
239245	239250	239251	239251	she	5076	" Well , Martin , "
239255	239260	239273	239273	Martin	576	" how is he ? "
239261	239271	239273	239273	Martin	576	" It is queer how she thinks of him , "
239275	239325	239251	239251	she	5076	" The blinding snow and bitter cold are nothing to her , I believe ; yet she is but a ' chitty - faced creature , ' as my mother would say . I could find in my heart to wish I had a cloak to wrap her in . "
239338	239344	239251	239251	she	5076	" You have seen him ? "
239345	239348	239251	239251	she	5076	" No . "
239349	239357	239251	239251	she	5076	" Oh ! you promised you would . "
239358	239381	239251	239251	she	5076	" I mean to do better by you than that . Did n't I say I do n't care to see him ? "
239382	239442	239251	239251	she	5076	" But now it will be so long before I get to know any thing certain about him , and I am sick of waiting . Martin , do see him , and give him Caroline Helstone 's regards , and say she wished to know how he was , and if anything could be done for his comfort . "
239443	239448	239251	239251	she	5076	" I wo n't . "
239449	239461	239251	239251	she	5076	" You are changed . You were so friendly last night . "
239462	239478	239251	239251	she	5076	" Come , we must not stand in this wood ; it is too cold . "
239479	239495	239251	239251	she	5076	" But before I go promise me to come again to - morrow with news . "
239496	239562	239251	239251	she	5076	" No such thing . I am much too delicate to make and keep such appointments in the winter season . If you knew what a pain I had in my chest this morning , and how I went without breakfast , and was knocked down besides , you 'd feel the impropriety of bringing me here in the snow . Come , I say . "
239563	239571	239251	239251	she	5076	" Are you really delicate , Martin ? "
239572	239579	239251	239251	she	5076	" Do n't I look so ? "
239580	239586	239251	239251	she	5076	" You have rosy cheeks . "
239587	239601	239251	239251	she	5076	" That 's hectic . Will you come - or you wo n't ? "
239602	239605	239251	239251	she	5076	" Where ? "
239606	239627	239251	239251	she	5076	" With me . I was a fool not to bring a cloak . I would have made you cosy . "
239628	239643	239251	239251	she	5076	" You are going home ; my nearest road lies in the opposite direction . "
239644	239658	239251	239251	she	5076	" Put your arm through mine ; I 'll take care of you . "
239659	239688	239251	239251	she	5076	" But the wall - the hedge - it is such hard work climbing , and you are too slender and young to help me without hurting yourself . "
239689	239697	239251	239251	she	5076	" You shall go through the gate . "
239698	239702	239251	239251	she	5076	" But - - "
239703	239715	239251	239251	she	5076	" But , but - will you trust me or not ? "
239722	239738	239251	239251	she	5076	" I think I will . Anything rather than return as anxious as I came . "
239739	239767	239251	239251	she	5076	" I ca n't answer for that . This , however , I promise you : be ruled by me , and you shall see Moore yourself . "
239768	239773	239251	239251	she	5076	" See him myself ? "
239774	239777	239251	239251	she	5076	" Yourself . "
239778	239788	239251	239251	she	5076	" But , dear Martin , does he know ? "
239789	239804	239251	239251	she	5076	" Ah ! I 'm dear now . No , he does n't know . "
239805	239813	239251	239251	she	5076	" And your mother and the others ? "
239814	239819	239856	239856	he	5079	" All is right . "
239847	239855	239251	239251	she	5076	" Have you made up your mind ? "
239863	239890	239859	239859	She	279	" Decide ; we are just on the spot . I wo n't see him - that I tell you - except to announce your arrival . "
239891	239928	239251	239251	she	5076	" Martin , you are a strange boy , and this is a strange step ; but all I feel is and has been , for a long time , strange . I will see him . "
239929	239941	239859	239859	She	279	" Having said that , you will neither hesitate nor retract ? "
239942	239945	239251	239251	she	5076	" No . "
239946	240058	239859	239859	She	279	" Here we are , then . Do not be afraid of passing the parlour window ; no one will see you . My father and Matthew are at the mill , Mark is at school , the servants are in the back kitchen , Miss Moore is at the cottage , my mother in her bed , and Mrs. Horsfall in paradise . Observe - I need not ring . I open the door ; the hall is empty , the staircase quiet ; so is the gallery . The whole house and all its inhabitants are under a spell , which I will not break till you are gone . "
240059	240066	239251	239251	she	5076	" Martin , I trust you . "
240067	240112	239859	239859	She	279	" You never said a better word . Let me take your shawl . I will shake off the snow and dry it for you . You are cold and wet . Never mind ; there is a fire upstairs . Are you ready ? "
240113	240116	239251	239251	she	5076	" Yes . "
240117	240121	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Follow me . "
240188	240192	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Come in . "
240198	240250	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Mr. Moore , a lady called to inquire after you . None of the women were about . It is washing - day , and the maids are over the crown of the head in soap - suds in the back kitchen , so I asked her to step up . "
240251	240257	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Up here , sir ? "
240258	240275	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Up here , sir ; but if you object , she shall go down again . "
240276	240296	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Is this a place or am I a person to bring a lady to , you absurd lad ? "
240297	240307	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" No ; so I 'll take her off . "
240308	240320	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Martin , you will stay here . Who is she ? "
240321	240335	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Your grandmother from that château on the Scheldt Miss Moore talks about . "
240336	240339	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Martin , "
240348	240354	240362	240362	Moore	477	" do n't be foolish . "
240355	240360	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Is she there ? "
240372	240396	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" She is there , fit to faint . She is standing on the mat , shocked at your want of filial affection . "
240397	240417	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" Martin , you are an evil cross between an imp and a page . What is she like ? "
240418	240432	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" More like me than you ; for she is young and beautiful . "
240433	240445	240193	240194	The boy	4351	" You are to show her forward . Do you hear ? "
240446	240452	240459	240459	Moore	477	" Come , Miss Caroline . "
240453	240457	240502	240502	Martin	576	" Miss Caroline ! "
240490	240500	240502	240502	Martin	576	" I give you a quarter of an hour , "
240508	240558	240616	240618	the meagre man	5091	" no more . Say what you have to say in that time . Till it is past I will wait in the gallery ; nothing shall approach ; I 'll see you safe away . Should you persist in staying longer , I leave you to your fate . "
240607	240614	240616	240618	the meagre man	5091	" You are come at last , "
240628	240635	240703	240704	the girl	5967	" Did you expect me before ? "
240636	240667	240616	240618	the meagre man	5091	" For a month , near two months , we have been very near ; and I have been in sad pain , and danger , and misery , Cary . "
240668	240674	240703	240704	the girl	5967	" I could not come . "
240675	240694	240616	240618	the meagre man	5091	" Could n't you ? But the rectory and Briarmains are very near - not two miles apart . "
240726	240770	240795	240795	his	5094	" When I say I could not come , I mean I could not see you ; for I came with mamma the very day we heard what had happened . Mr. MacTurk then told us it was impossible to admit any stranger . "
240771	240792	240795	240795	his	5094	" But afterwards - every fine afternoon these many weeks past I have waited and listened . Something here , Cary "
240801	240831	240795	240795	his	5094	" told me it was impossible but that you should think of me . Not that I merit thought ; but we are old acquaintance - we are cousins . "
240832	240845	240795	240795	his	5094	" I came again , Robert ; mamma and I came again . "
240846	240871	240795	240795	his	5094	" Did you ? Come , that is worth hearing . Since you came again , we will sit down and talk about it . "
240906	240908	240919	240919	Each	2222	" wuthering "
240933	240941	241734	241734	Moore	481	" So mamma and you came again ? "
240942	241052	241053	241053	Moore	481	" And Mrs. Yorke did treat us strangely . We asked to see you . ' No , ' said she , ' not in my house . I am at present responsible for his life ; it shall not be forfeited for half an hour 's idle gossip . ' But I must not tell you all she said ; it was very disagreeable . However , we came yet again - mamma , Miss Keeldar , and I. This time we thought we should conquer , as we were three against one , and Shirley was on our side . But Mrs. Yorke opened such a battery . "
241056	241062	240919	240919	Each	2222	" What did she say ? "
241063	241132	241053	241053	Moore	481	" Things that astonished us . Shirley laughed at last ; I cried ; mamma was seriously annoyed . We were all three driven from the field . Since that time I have only walked once a day past the house , just for the satisfaction of looking up at your window , which I could distinguish by the drawn curtains . I really dared not come in . "
241133	241142	240919	240919	Each	2222	" I have wished for you , Caroline . "
241143	241173	241053	241053	Moore	481	" I did not know that ; I never dreamt one instant that you thought of me . If I had but most distantly imagined such a possibility - - "
241174	241183	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Mrs. Yorke would still have beaten you . "
241184	241251	241053	241053	Moore	481	" She would not . Stratagem should have been tried , if persuasion failed . I would have come to the kitchen door ; the servants should have let me in , and I would have walked straight upstairs . In fact , it was far more the fear of intrusion - the fear of yourself - that baffled me than the fear of Mrs. Yorke . "
241252	241275	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Only last night I despaired of ever seeing you again . Weakness has wrought terrible depression in me - terrible depression . "
241276	241282	241053	241053	Moore	481	" And you sit alone ? "
241283	241288	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Worse than alone . "
241289	241304	241053	241053	Moore	481	" But you must be getting better , since you can leave your bed ? "
241305	241326	240919	240919	Each	2222	" I doubt whether I shall live . I see nothing for it , after such exhaustion , but decline . "
241327	241338	241053	241053	Moore	481	" You - you shall go home to the Hollow . "
241339	241350	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Dreariness would accompany , nothing cheerful come near me . "
241351	241372	241053	241053	Moore	481	" I will alter this . This shall be altered , were there ten Mrs. Yorkes to do battle with . "
241373	241381	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Cary , you make me smile . "
241382	241398	241053	241053	Moore	481	" Do smile ; smile again . Shall I tell you what I should like ? "
241399	241419	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Tell me anything - only keep talking . I am Saul ; but for music I should perish . "
241420	241439	241053	241053	Moore	481	" I should like you to be brought to the rectory , and given to me and mamma . "
241440	241456	240919	240919	Each	2222	" A precious gift ! I have not laughed since they shot me till now . "
241457	241465	241053	241053	Moore	481	" Do you suffer pain , Robert ? "
241466	241510	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Not so much pain now ; but I am hopelessly weak , and the state of my mind is inexpressible - dark , barren , impotent . Do you not read it all in my face ? I look a mere ghost . "
241511	241545	241053	241053	Moore	481	" Altered ; yet I should have known you anywhere . But I understand your feelings ; I experienced something like it . Since we met , I too have been very ill . "
241546	241550	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Very ill ? "
241551	241605	241053	241053	Moore	481	" I thought I should die . The tale of my life seemed told . Every night , just at midnight , I used to wake from awful dreams ; and the book lay open before me at the last page , where was written ' Finis . ' I had strange feelings . "
241606	241612	240919	240919	Each	2222	" You speak my experience . "
241613	241662	241053	241053	Moore	481	" I believed I should never see you again ; and I grew so thin - as thin as you are now . I could do nothing for myself - neither rise nor lie down ; and I could not eat . Yet you see I am better . "
241663	241688	240919	240919	Each	2222	" Comforter - sad as sweet . I am too feeble to say what I feel ; but while you speak I do feel . "
241689	241733	241747	241747	He	481	" Here I am at your side , where I thought never more to be . Here I speak to you . I see you listen to me willingly - look at me kindly . Did I count on that ? I despaired . "
241755	241765	241053	241053	Moore	481	" May I be spared to make some atonement . "
241771	241776	241053	241053	Moore	481	" And for what ? "
241777	241814	241819	241819	Caroline	279	" We will not touch on it now , Cary ; unmanned as I am , I have not the power to cope with such a topic . Was Mrs. Pryor with you during your illness ? "
241815	241817	241819	241819	Caroline	279	" Yes "
241823	241830	241053	241053	Moore	481	" you know she is mamma ? "
241831	241857	241819	241819	Caroline	279	" I have heard - Hortense told me ; but that tale too I will receive from yourself . Does she add to your happiness ? "
241858	241887	241053	241053	Moore	481	" What ! mamma ? She is dear to me ; how dear I can not say . I was altogether weary , and she held me up . "
241888	241912	241819	241819	Caroline	279	" I deserve to hear that in a moment when I can scarce lift my hand to my head . I deserve it . "
241913	241921	241053	241053	Moore	481	" It is no reproach against you . "
241922	241974	241986	241986	she	5098	" It is a coal of fire heaped on my head ; and so is every word you address to me , and every look that lights your sweet face . Come still nearer , Lina ; and give me your hand - if my thin fingers do not scare you . "
242027	242056	242063	242063	Martin	576	" I 'll keep these things in my heart , Cary ; that kiss I will put by , and you shall hear of it again one day . "
242057	242061	242063	242063	Martin	576	" Come out ! "
242069	242086	241986	241986	she	5098	" come away ; you have had twenty minutes instead of a quarter of an hour . "
242087	242097	242063	242063	Martin	576	" She will not stir yet , you hempseed . "
242098	242107	241986	241986	she	5098	" I dare not stay longer , Robert . "
242108	242115	242125	242125	Martin	576	" Can you promise to return ? "
242116	242123	242125	242125	Martin	576	" No , she ca n't , "
242127	242155	241986	241986	she	5098	" The thing must n't become customary . I ca n't be troubled . It 's very well for once ; I 'll not have it repeated . "
242156	242164	242125	242125	Martin	576	" You 'll not have it repeated . "
242165	242201	241986	241986	she	5098	" Hush ! do n't vex him ; we could not have met to - day but for him . But I will come again , if it is your wish that I should come . "
242202	242220	242125	242125	Martin	576	" It is my wish - my one wish - almost the only wish I can feel . "
242221	242262	242125	242125	Martin	576	" Come this minute . My mother has coughed , got up , set her feet on the floor . Let her only catch you on the stairs , Miss Caroline . You 're not to bid him good - bye "
242270	242276	242125	242125	Martin	576	" you are to march . "
242277	242283	242125	242125	Martin	576	" My shawl , Martin . "
242284	242303	242388	242388	he	5101	" I have it . I 'll put it on for you when you are in the hall . "
242393	242407	242388	242388	he	5101	" Now , Miss Caroline , for all this give me one kiss . "
242430	242442	242930	242931	John Wesley	586	" She is my debtor , and I will be paid . "
242933	242936	242970	242970	Martin	576	" Sermons . "
242960	242968	243015	243016	the mother	802	" Rose will do as she pleases , "
243000	243013	243015	243016	the mother	802	" Rose will do as she is told , and Martin too , "
243018	243025	243090	243091	the father	1944	" I am going to church . "
243081	243088	243129	243130	Mrs. Yorke	340	" It is not fit weather , "
243111	243127	243090	243091	the father	1944	" Martin hates to go to church , but he hates still more to obey , "
243132	243142	243090	243091	the father	1944	" I suppose I am influenced by pure perverseness ? "
243143	243149	243090	243091	the father	1944	" Yes , you are . "
243150	243157	243090	243091	the father	1944	" Mother , I am not . "
243158	243168	243090	243091	the father	1944	" By what , then , are you influenced ? "
243169	243206	243216	243217	Mr. Yorke	245	" By a complication of motives , the intricacies of which I should as soon think of explaining to you as I should of turning myself inside out to exhibit the internal machinery of my frame . "
243207	243214	243216	243217	Mr. Yorke	245	" Hear Martin ! hear him ! "
243219	243277	243290	243290	Martin	576	" I must see and have this lad of mine brought up to the bar . Nature meant him to live by his tongue . Hesther , your third son must certainly be a lawyer ; he has the stock - in - trade - brass , self - conceit , and words - words - words . "
243278	243288	243216	243217	Mr. Yorke	245	" Some bread , Rose , if you please , "
243313	243316	243361	243362	his sire	5143	" dour moods "
243354	243359	243385	243385	he	5143	" But , Martin , "
243364	243384	243385	243385	he	5143	" there is drift all the way ; a man could hardly wade through it . However , lad , "
243401	243460	243488	243488	he	576	" this is a case wherein I would by no means balk the obdurate chap of his will . Go to church by all means . There is a pitiless wind , and a sharp , frozen sleet , besides the depth under foot . Go out into it , since thou prefers it to a warm fireside . "
243477	243487	243488	243488	he	576	" My father has more sense than my mother , "
243491	243514	243515	243515	He	576	" How women miss it ! They drive the nail into the flesh , thinking they are hammering away at insensate stone . "
243520	243668	243802	243802	Martin	576	" Now , if the weather frightens her and it is a real December tempest , or if that Mrs. Pryor objects to her going out , and I should miss her after all , it will vex me ; but , tempest or tornado , hail or ice , she ought to come , and if she has a mind worthy of her eyes and features she will come . She will be here for the chance of seeing me , as I am here for the chance of seeing her . She will want to get a word respecting her confounded sweetheart , as I want to get another flavour of what I think the essence of life - a taste of existence , with the spirit preserved in it , and not evaporated . Adventure is to stagnation what champagne is to flat porter . "
243789	243800	243863	243863	Martin	576	" I 'll scorn her if she does n't come , "
243867	243888	243852	243852	Void	587	" Worthless thing ! vapid thing ! commonplace humbug ! Like all other girls - weakly , selfish , shallow ! "
243895	243966	244287	244287	he	576	" She is not like our picture . Her eyes are not large and expressive ; her nose is not straight , delicate , Hellenic ; her mouth has not that charm I thought it had , which I imagined could beguile me of sullenness in my worst moods . What is she ? A thread - paper , a doll , a toy , a girl , in short . "
244283	244286	244287	244287	he	576	" If , "
244290	244353	244499	244499	his	576	" if she takes no notice of me , if she shows I am not in her thoughts , I shall have a worse , a meaner opinion of her than ever . Most despicable would it be to come for the sake of those sheep - faced Sunday scholars , and not for my sake or that long skeleton Moore 's . "
244533	244549	245953	245953	Martin	576	" I think you had better strike a bargain . Exchange me for Mrs. Pryor . "
244550	244590	244499	244499	his	576	" I was not sure whether you would come this way , Martin , but I thought I would run the chance . There is no such thing as getting a quiet word spoken in the church or churchyard . "
244591	244612	245953	245953	Martin	576	" Will you agree ? - make over Mrs. Pryor to my mother , and put me in her skirts ? "
244613	244629	244499	244499	his	576	" As if I could understand you ! What puts Mrs. Pryor into your head ? "
244630	244642	245953	245953	Martin	576	" You call her ' mamma , ' do n't you ? "
244643	244649	244499	244499	his	576	" She is my mamma . "
244650	244721	245953	245953	Martin	576	" Not possible - or so inefficient , so careless a mamma ; I should make a five times better one . You may laugh . I have no objection to see you laugh . Your teeth - I hate ugly teeth ; but yours are as pretty as a pearl necklace , and a necklace of which the pearls are very fair , even , and well matched too . "
244722	244736	244499	244499	his	576	" Martin , what now ? I thought the Yorkes never paid compliments ? "
244737	244909	245953	245953	Martin	576	" They have not done till this generation ; but I feel as if it were my vocation to turn out a new variety of the Yorke species . I am rather tired of my own ancestors . We have traditions going back for four ages - tales of Hiram , which was the son of Hiram , which was the son of Samuel , which was the son of John , which was the son of Zerubbabel Yorke . All , from Zerubbabel down to the last Hiram , were such as you see my father . Before that there was a Godfrey . We have his picture ; it hangs in Moore 's bedroom ; it is like me . Of his character we know nothing ; but I am sure it was different to his descendants . He has long , curling dark hair ; he is carefully and cavalierly dressed . Having said that he is like me , I need not add that he is handsome . "
244910	244918	244499	244499	his	576	" You are not handsome , Martin . "
244919	244951	245953	245953	Martin	576	" No ; but wait awhile - just let me take my time . I mean to begin from this day to cultivate , to polish , and we shall see . "
244952	244980	244499	244499	his	576	" You are a very strange , a very unaccountable boy , Martin . But do n't imagine you ever will be handsome ; you can not . "
244981	245040	245953	245953	Martin	576	" I mean to try . But we were talking about Mrs. Pryor . She must be the most unnatural mamma in existence , coolly to let her daughter come out in this weather . Mine was in such a rage because I would go to church ; she was fit to fling the kitchen brush after me . "
245041	245062	244499	244499	his	576	" Mamma was very much concerned about me ; but I am afraid I was obstinate . I would go . "
245063	245068	245953	245953	Martin	576	" To see me ? "
245069	245107	244499	244499	his	576	" Exactly ; I thought of nothing else . I greatly feared the snow would hinder you from coming . You do n't know how pleased I was to see you all by yourself in the pew . "
245108	245163	245953	245953	Martin	576	" I came to fulfil my duty , and set the parish a good example . And so you were obstinate , were you ? I should like to see you obstinate , I should . Would n't I have you in good discipline if I owned you ? Let me take the umbrella . "
245164	245178	244499	244499	his	576	" I ca n't stay two minutes ; our dinner will be ready . "
245179	245239	245953	245953	Martin	576	" And so will ours ; and we have always a hot dinner on Sundays . Roast goose to - day , with apple - pie and rice - pudding . I always contrive to know the bill of fare . Well , I like these things uncommonly ; but I 'll make the sacrifice , if you will . "
245240	245275	244499	244499	his	576	" We have a cold dinner . My uncle will allow no unnecessary cooking on the Sabbath . But I must return ; the house would be in commotion if I failed to appear . "
245276	245333	245953	245953	Martin	576	" So will Briarmains , bless you ! I think I hear my father sending out the overlooker and five of the dyers , to look in six directions for the body of his prodigal son in the snow ; and my mother repenting her of her many misdeeds towards me , now I am gone . "
245334	245342	244499	244499	his	576	" Martin , how is Mr. Moore ? "
245343	245357	245953	245953	Martin	576	" That is what you came for , just to say that word . "
245358	245365	244499	244499	his	576	" Come , tell me quickly . "
245366	245423	245953	245953	Martin	576	" Hang him ! he is no worse ; but as ill - used as ever - mewed up , kept in solitary confinement . They mean to make either an idiot or a maniac of him , and take out a commission of lunacy . Horsfall starves him ; you saw how thin he was . "
245424	245435	244499	244499	his	576	" You were very good the other day , Martin . "
245436	245448	245953	245953	Martin	576	" What day ? I am always good - a model . "
245449	245458	244499	244499	his	576	" When will you be so good again ? "
245459	245481	245953	245953	Martin	576	" I see what you are after ; but you 'll not wheedle me - I am no cat's - paw . "
245482	245501	244499	244499	his	576	" But it must be done . It is quite a right thing , and a necessary thing . "
245502	245520	245953	245953	Martin	576	" How you encroach ! Remember , I managed the matter of my own free will before . "
245521	245527	244499	244499	his	576	" And you will again . "
245528	245547	245953	245953	Martin	576	" I wo n't . The business gave me far too much trouble . I like my ease . "
245548	245565	244499	244499	his	576	" Mr. Moore wishes to see me , Martin , and I wish to see him . "
245566	245570	245953	245953	Martin	576	" I dare say "
245573	245586	245953	245953	Martin	576	" It is too bad of your mother to exclude his friends . "
245587	245592	245953	245953	Martin	576	" Tell her so . "
245593	245598	245953	245953	Martin	576	" His own relations . "
245599	245606	245953	245953	Martin	576	" Come and blow her up . "
245607	245642	245953	245953	Martin	576	" You know that would advance nothing . Well , I shall stick to my point . See him I will . If you wo n't help me , I 'll manage without help . "
245643	245658	245953	245953	Martin	576	" Do ; there is nothing like self - reliance , self - dependence . "
245659	245680	245712	245712	Martin	576	" I have no time to reason with you now ; but I consider you provoking . Good - morning . "
245699	245710	245712	245712	Martin	576	" She is not vapid ; she is not shallow , "
245714	245939	246318	246318	He	481	" I shall like to watch , and mark how she will work her way without help . If the storm were not of snow , but of fire - such as came refreshingly down on the cities of the plain - she would go through it to procure five minutes ' speech of that Moore . Now , I consider I have had a pleasant morning . The disappointments got time on ; the fears and fits of anger only made that short discourse pleasanter , when it came at last . She expected to coax me at once . She 'll not manage that in one effort . She shall come again , again , and yet again . It would please me to put her in a passion - to make her cry . I want to discover how far she will go - what she will do and dare - to get her will . It seems strange and new to find one human being thinking so much about another as she thinks about Moore . But it is time to go home ; my appetite tells me the hour . Wo n't I walk into that goose ? and we 'll try whether Matthew or I shall get the largest cut of the apple - pie to - day . "
246340	246343	246380	246380	he	481	" avaunt . "
246374	246379	246427	246427	she	575	" Good - bye ! "
246415	246426	246427	246427	she	575	" And what are you going to leave us for ? "
246430	246455	246462	246462	he	481	" We will keep you , and do anything in the world for you , if you will only stay till you are stronger . "
246456	246461	246462	246462	he	481	" Good - bye ! "
246469	246485	246524	246524	he	481	" You have been a mother to me ; give your wilful son one embrace . "
246509	246523	246494	246494	he	481	" What a trouble - what a burden I have been to you ! "
246527	246538	246494	246494	he	481	" You are the worst trouble now , headstrong youth ! "
246543	246569	246597	246597	Rose	341	" I wonder who is to nurse you at Hollow 's Cottage ? Your sister Hortense knows no more about such matters than a child . "
246570	246586	246676	246676	he	5207	" Thank God ! for I have had nursing enough to last me my life . "
246680	246715	246777	246777	he	5207	" You have a good riddance of me . That was an unlucky shot for you , Yorke ; it turned Briarmains into an hospital . Come and see me at the cottage soon . "
246764	246775	246777	246777	he	5207	" Six months ago I passed out at this gate , "
246779	247063	247149	247149	Moore	239	" a proud , angry , disappointed man . I come back sadder and wiser ; weakly enough , but not worried . A cold , gray , yet quiet world lies round - a world where , if I hope little , I fear nothing . All slavish terrors of embarrassment have left me . Let the worst come , I can work , as Joe Scott does , for an honourable living ; in such doom I yet see some hardship but no degradation . Formerly , pecuniary ruin was equivalent in my eyes to personal dishonour . It is not so now ; I know the difference . Ruin is an evil , but one for which I am prepared ; the day of whose coming I know , for I have calculated . I can yet put it off six months - not an hour longer . If things by that time alter , which is not probable ; if fetters , which now seem indissoluble , should be loosened from our trade of all things the most unlikely to happen , I might conquer in this long struggle yet - I might - good God ! what might I not do ? But the thought is a brief madness ; let me see things with sane eyes . Ruin will come , lay her axe to my fortune 's roots , and hew them down . I shall snatch a sapling , I shall cross the sea , and plant it in American woods . Louis will go with me . Will none but Louis go ? I can not tell - I have no right to ask . "
247144	247147	247149	247149	Moore	239	" Hortense , "
247164	247172	247240	247240	He	5214	" I am pleased to come home . "
247253	247256	247564	247564	He	5223	" Hortense ! "
247257	247261	247240	247240	He	5214	" Mon frere ? "
247262	247277	247564	247564	He	5223	" This little parlour looks very clean and pleasant - unusually bright , somehow . "
247278	247299	247240	247240	He	5214	" It is true , brother ; I have had the whole house thoroughly and scrupulously cleaned in your absence . "
247300	247341	247564	247564	He	5223	" Sister , I think on this first day of your return home you ought to have a friend or so to tea , if it were only to see how fresh and spruce you have made the little place . "
247342	247359	247240	247240	He	5214	" True , brother . If it were not late I might send for Miss Mann . "
247360	247390	247564	247564	He	5223	" So you might ; but it really is too late to disturb that good lady , and the evening is much too cold for her to come out . "
247391	247409	247240	247240	He	5214	" How thoughtful in you , dear Gérard ! We must put it off till another day . "
247410	247433	247564	247564	He	5223	" I want some one to - day , dear sister - some quiet guest , who would tire neither of us . "
247434	247438	247240	247240	He	5214	" Miss Ainley ? "
247439	247480	247564	247564	He	5223	" An excellent person , they say ; but she lives too far off . Tell Harry Scott to step up to the rectory with a request from you that Caroline Helstone should come and spend the evening with you . "
247481	247494	247240	247240	He	5214	" Would it not be better to - morrow , dear brother ? "
247495	247523	247564	247564	He	5223	" I should like her to see the place as it is just now ; its brilliant cleanliness and perfect neatness are so much to your credit . "
247524	247535	247240	247240	He	5214	" It might benefit her in the way of example . "
247536	247547	247564	247564	He	5223	" It might and must ; she ought to come . "
247554	247563	247586	247586	himself	5223	" Sarah , delay tea half an hour . "
247590	247594	247803	247804	Mr. Moore	497	" Miss Helstone . "
247793	247801	248023	248023	Moore	239	" I am pleased to come home , "
248008	248021	248568	248568	she	5239	" Caroline , you look as if you had heard good tidings , "
248034	248038	248568	248568	she	5239	" Do I ? "
248039	248062	248568	248568	she	5239	" I sent for you this evening that I might be cheered ; but you cheer me more than I had calculated . "
248063	248076	248568	248568	she	5239	" I am glad of that . And I really cheer you ? "
248077	248088	248568	248568	she	5239	" You look brightly , move buoyantly , speak musically . "
248089	248098	248568	248568	she	5239	" It is pleasant to be here again . "
248099	248146	248568	248568	she	5239	" Truly it is pleasant ; I feel it so . And to see health on your cheek and hope in your eye is pleasant , Cary ; but what is this hope , and what is the source of this sunshine I perceive about you ? "
248147	248323	248568	248568	she	5239	" For one thing , I am happy in mamma . I love her so much , and she loves me . Long and tenderly she nursed me . Now , when her care has made me well , I can occupy myself for and with her all the day . I say it is my turn to attend to her ; and I do attend to her . I am her waiting - woman as well as her child . I like - you would laugh if you knew what pleasure I have in making dresses and sewing for her . She looks so nice now , Robert ; I will not let her be old - fashioned . And then , she is charming to talk to - full of wisdom , ripe in judgment , rich in information , exhaustless in stores her observant faculties have quietly amassed . Every day that I live with her I like her better , I esteem her more highly , I love her more tenderly . "
248324	248356	248568	248568	she	5239	" That for one thing , then , Cary . You talk in such a way about ' mamma ' it is enough to make one jealous of the old lady . "
248357	248365	248568	248568	she	5239	" She is not old , Robert . "
248366	248374	248568	248568	she	5239	" Of the young lady , then . "
248375	248384	248568	248568	she	5239	" She does not pretend to be young . "
248385	248414	248568	248568	she	5239	" Well , of the matron . But you said ' mamma 's ' affection was one thing that made you happy ; now for the other thing . "
248415	248423	248568	248568	she	5239	" I am glad you are better . "
248424	248428	248568	248568	she	5239	" What besides ? "
248429	248437	248568	248568	she	5239	" I am glad we are friends . "
248438	248443	248568	248568	she	5239	" You and I ? "
248444	248455	248568	248568	she	5239	" Yes . I once thought we never should be . "
248456	248484	248568	248568	she	5239	" Cary , some day I mean to tell you a thing about myself that is not to my credit , and consequently will not please you . "
248485	248501	248568	248568	she	5239	" Ah , do n't ! I can not bear to think ill of you . "
248502	248519	248568	248568	she	5239	" And I can not bear that you should think better of me than I deserve . "
248520	248542	248568	248568	she	5239	" Well , but I half know your ' thing ; ' indeed , I believe I know all about it . "
248543	248548	248568	248568	she	5239	" You do not . "
248549	248555	248568	248568	she	5239	" I believe I do . "
248556	248564	248568	248568	she	5239	" Whom does it concern besides me ? "
248575	248585	248568	248568	she	5239	" Speak , Cary ! Whom does it concern ? "
248597	248611	248568	248568	she	5239	" Tell me ; there is none present but ourselves . Be frank . "
248612	248619	248568	248568	she	5239	" But if I guess wrong ? "
248620	248629	248664	248664	she	5239	" I will forgive . Whisper , Cary . "
248669	248699	248568	248568	she	5239	" Miss Keeldar spent a day at the rectory about a week since . The evening came on very wintry , and we persuaded her to stay all night . "
248700	248710	248664	248664	she	5239	" And you and she curled your hair together ? "
248711	248718	248568	248568	she	5239	" How do you know that ? "
248719	248731	248664	248664	she	5239	" And then you chattered , and she told you - - "
248732	248762	248568	248568	she	5239	" It was not at curling - hair time , so you are not as wise as you think ; and , besides , she did n't tell me . "
248763	248769	248664	248664	she	5239	" You slept together afterwards ? "
248770	248792	248568	248568	she	5239	" We occupied the same room and bed . We did not sleep much ; we talked the whole night through . "
248793	248821	248664	248664	she	5239	" I 'll be sworn you did ! And then it all came out - tant pis . I would rather you had heard it from myself . "
248822	248873	248568	248568	she	5239	" You are quite wrong . She did not tell me what you suspect - she is not the person to proclaim such things ; but yet I inferred something from parts of her discourse . I gathered more from rumour , and I made out the rest by instinct . "
248874	248965	248664	248664	she	5239	" But if she did not tell you that I wanted to marry her for the sake of her money , and that she refused me indignantly and scornfully you need neither start nor blush ; nor yet need you prick your trembling fingers with your needle . That is the plain truth , whether you like it or not - if such was not the subject of her august confidences , on what point did they turn ? You say you talked the whole night through ; what about ? "
248966	248991	248568	248568	she	5239	" About things we never thoroughly discussed before , intimate friends as we have been ; but you hardly expect I should tell you ? "
248992	249019	248664	248664	she	5239	" Yes , yes , Cary ; you will tell me . You said we were friends , and friends should always confide in each other . "
249020	249031	248568	248568	she	5239	" But you are sure you wo n't repeat it ? "
249032	249036	248664	248664	she	5239	" Quite sure . "
249037	249042	248568	248568	she	5239	" Not to Louis ? "
249043	249059	248664	248664	she	5239	" Not even to Louis . What does Louis care for young ladies ' secrets ? "
249060	249071	248568	248568	she	5239	" Robert , Shirley is a curious , magnanimous being . "
249072	249091	248664	248664	she	5239	" I dare say . I can imagine there are both odd points and grand points about her . "
249092	249143	248568	248568	she	5239	" I have found her chary in showing her feelings ; but when they rush out , river - like , and pass full and powerful before you - almost without leave from her - you gaze , wonder ; you admire , and - I think - love her . "
249144	249150	248664	248664	she	5239	" You saw this spectacle ? "
249151	249187	248568	248568	she	5239	" Yes ; at dead of night , when all the house was silent , and starlight and the cold reflection from the snow glimmered in our chamber , then I saw Shirley 's heart . "
249188	249202	248664	248664	she	5239	" Her heart 's core ? Do you think she showed you that ? "
249203	249209	248568	248568	she	5239	" Her heart 's core . "
249210	249216	248664	248664	she	5239	" And how was it ? "
249217	249251	248568	248568	she	5239	" Like a shrine , for it was holy ; like snow , for it was pure ; like flame , for it was warm ; like death , for it was strong . "
249252	249261	248664	248664	she	5239	" Can she love ? tell me that . "
249262	249267	248568	248568	she	5239	" What think you ? "
249268	249279	248664	248664	she	5239	" She has loved none that have loved her yet . "
249280	249289	248568	248568	she	5239	" Who are those that have loved her ? "
249303	249311	248568	248568	she	5239	" She has loved none of these . "
249312	249325	248568	248568	she	5239	" Yet some of them were worthy of a woman 's affection . "
249326	249338	248568	248568	she	5239	" Of some women 's , but not of Shirley 's . "
249339	249349	248568	248568	she	5239	" Is she better than others of her sex ? "
249350	249366	248568	248568	she	5239	" She is peculiar , and more dangerous to take as a wife - rashly . "
249367	249373	248568	248568	she	5239	" I can imagine that . "
249374	249381	248568	248568	she	5239	" She spoke of you - - "
249382	249394	248568	248568	she	5239	" Oh , she did ! I thought you denied it . "
249395	249444	248568	248568	she	5239	" She did not speak in the way you fancy ; but I asked her , and I would make her tell me what she thought of you , or rather how she felt towards you . I wanted to know ; I had long wanted to know . "
249445	249465	248568	248568	she	5239	" So had I ; but let us hear . She thinks meanly , she feels contemptuously , doubtless ? "
249466	249507	248568	248568	she	5239	" She thinks of you almost as highly as a woman can think of a man . You know she can be eloquent . I yet feel in fancy the glow of the language in which her opinion was conveyed . "
249508	249515	248568	248568	she	5239	" But how does she feel ? "
249516	249554	248568	248568	she	5239	" Till you shocked her she said you had shocked her , but she would not tell me how she felt as a sister feels towards a brother of whom she is at once fond and proud . "
249555	249600	248568	248568	she	5239	" I 'll shock her no more , Cary , for the shock rebounded on myself till I staggered again . But that comparison about sister and brother is all nonsense . She is too rich and proud to entertain fraternal sentiments for me . "
249601	249646	248568	248568	she	5239	" You do n't know her , Robert ; and , somehow , I fancy now I had other ideas formerly that you can not know her . You and she are not so constructed as to be able thoroughly to understand each other . "
249647	249687	248568	248568	she	5239	" It may be so . I esteem her , I admire her ; and yet my impressions concerning her are harsh - perhaps uncharitable . I believe , for instance , that she is incapable of love - - "
249688	249694	248568	248568	she	5239	" Shirley incapable of love ! "
249695	249721	248568	248568	she	5239	" That she will never marry . I imagine her jealous of compromising her pride , of relinquishing her power , of sharing her property . "
249722	249730	248568	248568	she	5239	" Shirley has hurt your amour propre . "
249731	249754	248568	248568	she	5239	" She did hurt it ; though I had not an emotion of tenderness , nor a spark of passion for her . "
249755	249772	248568	248568	she	5239	" Then , Robert , it was very wicked in you to want to marry her . "
249773	249827	248568	248568	she	5239	" And very mean , my little pastor , my pretty priestess . I never wanted to kiss Miss Keeldar in my life , though she has fine lips , scarlet and round as ripe cherries ; or , if I did wish it , it was the mere desire of the eye . "
249828	249855	248568	248568	she	5239	" I doubt , now , whether you are speaking the truth . The grapes or the cherries are sour - ' hung too high . ' "
249856	249927	248568	248568	she	5239	" She has a pretty figure , a pretty face , beautiful hair . I acknowledge all her charms and feel none of them , or only feel them in a way she would disdain . I suppose I was truly tempted by the mere gilding of the bait . Caroline , what a noble fellow your Robert is - great , good , disinterested , and then so pure ! "
249928	249949	248568	248568	she	5239	" But not perfect . He made a great blunder once , and we will hear no more about it . "
249950	249979	248568	248568	she	5239	" And shall we think no more about it , Cary ? Shall we not despise him in our heart - gentle but just , compassionate but upright ? "
249980	250010	248568	248568	she	5239	" Never ! We will remember that with what measure we mete it shall be measured unto us , and so we will give no scorn , only affection . "
250011	250047	250063	250063	Moore	481	" Which wo n't satisfy , I warn you of that . Something besides affection - something far stronger , sweeter , warmer - will be demanded one day . Is it there to give ? "
250055	250061	250063	250063	Moore	481	" Be calm , Lina , "
250066	250141	250159	250159	she	279	" I have no intention , because I have no right , to perturb your mind now , nor for months to come . Do n't look as if you would leave me . We will make no more agitating allusions ; we will resume our gossip . Do not tremble ; look me in the face . See what a poor , pale , grim phantom I am - more pitiable than formidable . "
250146	250158	250177	250177	Moore	481	" There is something formidable still , pale as you are , "
250169	250175	250177	250177	Moore	481	" To return to Shirley , "
250179	250192	250177	250177	Moore	481	" is it your opinion that she is ever likely to marry ? "
250193	250197	250177	250177	Moore	481	" She loves . "
250198	250206	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Platonically - theoretically - all humbug ! "
250207	250215	250177	250177	Moore	481	" She loves what I call sincerely . "
250216	250222	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Did she say so ? "
250223	250249	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I can not affirm that she said so . No such confession as ' I love this man or that ' passed her lips . "
250250	250255	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I thought not . "
250256	250436	250177	250177	Moore	481	" But the feeling made its way in spite of her , and I saw it . She spoke of one man in a strain not to be misunderstood . Her voice alone was sufficient testimony . Having wrung from her an opinion on your character , I demanded a second opinion of - another person about whom I had my conjectures , though they were the most tangled and puzzled conjectures in the world . I would make her speak . I shook her , I chid her , I pinched her fingers when she tried to put me off with gibes and jests in her queer provoking way , and at last out it came . The voice , I say , was enough ; hardly raised above a whisper , and yet such a soft vehemence in its tones . There was no confession , no confidence , in the matter . To these things she can not condescend ; but I am sure that man 's happiness is dear to her as her own life . "
250437	250442	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Who is it ? "
250443	250487	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I charged her with the fact . She did not deny , she did not avow , but looked at me . I saw her eyes by the snow - gleam . It was quite enough . I triumphed over her mercilessly . "
250488	250506	250177	250177	Moore	481	" What right had you to triumph ? Do you mean to say you are fancy free ? "
250507	250542	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Whatever I am , Shirley is a bondswoman . Lioness , she has found her captor . Mistress she may be of all round her , but her own mistress she is not . "
250543	250560	250177	250177	Moore	481	" So you exulted at recognizing a fellow - slave in one so fair and imperial ? "
250561	250578	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I did ; Robert , you say right , in one so fair and imperial . "
250579	250588	250177	250177	Moore	481	" You confess it - a fellow -slave ? "
250589	250608	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I confess nothing ; but I say that haughty Shirley is no more free than was Hagar . "
250609	250631	250177	250177	Moore	481	" And who , pray , is the Abraham , the hero of a patriarch who has achieved such a conquest ? "
250632	250659	250177	250177	Moore	481	" You still speak scornfully , and cynically , and sorely ; but I will make you change your note before I have done with you . "
250660	250672	250177	250177	Moore	481	" We will see that . Can she marry this Cupidon ? "
250673	250690	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Cupidon ! he is just about as much a Cupidon as you are a Cyclops . "
250691	250697	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Can she marry him ? "
250698	250703	250177	250177	Moore	481	" You will see . "
250704	250714	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I want to know his name , Cary . "
250715	250719	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Guess it . "
250720	250729	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Is it any one in this neighbourhood ? "
250730	250737	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Yes , in Briarfield parish . "
250738	250760	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Then it is some person unworthy of her . I do n't know a soul in Briarfield parish her equal . "
250761	250764	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Guess . "
250765	250786	250799	250799	Moore	481	" Impossible . I suppose she is under a delusion , and will plunge into some absurdity , after all . "
250790	250797	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Do you approve the choice ? "
250801	250806	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Quite , quite . "
250807	250854	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Then I am puzzled ; for the head which owns this bounteous fall of hazel curls is an excellent little thinking machine , most accurate in its working . It boasts a correct , steady judgment , inherited from ' mamma , ' I suppose . "
250855	250866	250177	250177	Moore	481	" And I quite approve , and mamma was charmed . "
250867	250884	250177	250177	Moore	481	" ' Mamma ' charmed - Mrs. Pryor ! It ca n't be romantic , then ? "
250885	250896	250177	250177	Moore	481	" It is romantic , but it is also right . "
250897	250917	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Tell me , Cary - tell me out of pity ; I am too weak to be tantalized . "
250918	250940	250177	250177	Moore	481	" You shall be tantalized - it will do you no harm ; you are not so weak as you pretend . "
250941	250959	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I have twice this evening had some thoughts of falling on the floor at your feet . "
250960	250974	250177	250177	Moore	481	" You had better not . I shall decline to help you up . "
250975	251012	250177	250177	Moore	481	" And worshipping you downright . My mother was a Roman Catholic . You look like the loveliest of her pictures of the Virgin . I think I will embrace her faith and kneel and adore . "
251013	251036	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Robert , Robert , sit still ; do n't be absurd . I will go to Hortense if you commit extravagances . "
251037	251067	250177	250177	Moore	481	" You have stolen my senses . Just now nothing will come into my mind but les litanies de la sainte Vierge . Rose céleste , reine des anges ! "
251068	251092	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Tour d'ivoire , maison d'or - is not that the jargon ? Well , sit down quietly , and guess your riddle . "
251093	251105	250177	250177	Moore	481	" But ' mamma ' charmed - there 's the puzzle . "
251106	251141	250177	250177	Moore	481	" I 'll tell you what mamma said when I told her . ' Depend upon it , my dear , such a choice will make the happiness of Miss Keeldar 's life . ' "
251142	251165	251180	251180	Caroline	279	" I 'll guess once , and no more . It is old Helstone . She is going to be your aunt . "
251166	251178	251180	251180	Caroline	279	" I 'll tell my uncle ; I 'll tell Shirley ! "
251185	251196	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Guess again , Robert ; your blunders are charming . "
251197	251205	251180	251180	Caroline	279	" It is the parson - Hall . "
251206	251219	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Indeed , no ; he is mine , if you please . "
251220	251258	251180	251180	Caroline	279	" Yours ! Ay , the whole generation of women in Briarfield seem to have made an idol of that priest . I wonder why ; he is bald , sand - blind , gray - haired . "
251259	251281	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Fanny will be here to fetch me before you have solved the riddle , if you do n't make haste . "
251282	251310	251180	251180	Caroline	279	" I 'll guess no more - I am tired ; and then I do n't care . Miss Keeldar may marry le grand Turc for me . "
251311	251316	250177	250177	Moore	481	" Must I whisper ? "
251317	251350	251433	251433	he	481	" That you must , and quickly . Here comes Hortense ; come near , a little nearer , my own Lina . I care for the whisper more than the words . "
251422	251432	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Must I call Shirley a noble creature now ? "
251436	251447	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" If you wish to speak the truth , certainly . "
251448	251454	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Must I forgive her ? "
251455	251472	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Forgive her ? Naughty Robert ! Was she in the wrong , or were you ? "
251473	251484	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Must I at length love her downright , Cary ? "
251505	251519	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Only give the word , and I 'll try to obey you . "
251520	251535	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Indeed , you must not love her ; the bare idea is perverse . "
251536	251581	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" But then she is handsome , peculiarly handsome . Hers is a beauty that grows on you . You think her but graceful when you first see her ; you discover her to be beautiful when you have known her for a year . "
251582	251601	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" It is not you who are to say these things . Now , Robert , be good . "
251602	251642	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" O Cary , I have no love to give . Were the goddess of beauty to woo me , I could not meet her advances . There is no heart which I can call mine in this breast . "
251643	251661	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" So much the better ; you are a great deal safer without . Good - night . "
251662	251683	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Why must you always go , Lina , at the very instant when I most want you to stay ? "
251684	251699	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Because you most wish to retain when you are most certain to lose . "
251700	251719	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Listen ; one other word . Take care of your own heart - do you hear me ? "
251720	251726	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" There is no danger . "
251727	251742	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" I am not convinced of that . The Platonic parson , for instance . "
251743	251748	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Who - Malone ? "
251749	251765	251485	251485	Caroline	279	" Cyril Hall . I owe more than one twinge of jealousy to that quarter . "
251766	251799	256363	256363	I	0	" As to you , you have been flirting with Miss Mann . She showed me the other day a plant you had given her . - Fanny , I am ready . "
252378	252419	256363	256363	I	0	" She is lovelier than ever . Since that little cloud was dispelled all the temporary waste and wanness have vanished . It was marvellous to see how soon the magical energy of youth raised her elastic and revived her blooming .
252420	252567	256363	256363	I	0	" After breakfast this morning , when I had seen her , and listened to her , and , so to speak , felt her , in every sentient atom of my frame , I passed from her sunny presence into the chill drawing - room . Taking up a little gilt volume , I found it to contain a selection of lyrics . I read a poem or two ; whether the spell was in me or in the verse I know not , but my heart filled genially , my pulse rose . I glowed , notwithstanding the frost air . I , too , am young as yet . Though she said she never considered me young , I am barely thirty . There are moments when life , for no other reason than my own youth , beams with sweet hues upon me .
252568	252646	256363	256363	I	0	" It was time to go to the schoolroom . I went . That same schoolroom is rather pleasant in a morning . The sun then shines through the low lattice ; the books are in order ; there are no papers strewn about ; the fire is clear and clean ; no cinders have fallen , no ashes accumulated . I found Henry there , and he had brought with him Miss Keeldar . They were together .
252647	252775	256363	256363	I	0	" I said she was lovelier than ever . She is . A fine rose , not deep but delicate , opens on her cheek . Her eye , always dark , clear , and speaking , utters now a language I can not render ; it is the utterance , seen not heard , through which angels must have communed when there was ' silence in heaven . ' Her hair was always dusk as night and fine as silk , her neck was always fair , flexible , polished ; but both have now a new charm . The tresses are soft as shadow , the shoulders they fall on wear a goddess grace . Once I only saw her beauty , now I feel it .
252776	252862	256363	256363	I	0	" Henry was repeating his lesson to her before bringing it to me . One of her hands was occupied with the book ; he held the other . That boy gets more than his share of privileges ; he dares caress and is caressed . What indulgence and compassion she shows him ! Too much . If this went on , Henry in a few years , when his soul was formed , would offer it on her altar , as I have offered mine .
252863	252981	256363	256363	I	0	" I saw her eyelid flitter when I came in , but she did not look up ; now she hardly ever gives me a glance . She seems to grow silent too ; to me she rarely speaks , and when I am present , she says little to others . In my gloomy moments I attribute this change to indifference , aversion , what not ? In my sunny intervals I give it another meaning . I say , were I her equal , I could find in this shyness coyness , and in that coyness love . As it is , dare I look for it ? What could I do with it if found ?
252982	253053	256363	256363	I	0	" This morning I dared at least contrive an hour 's communion for her and me ; I dared not only wish but will an interview with her . I dared summon solitude to guard us . Very decidedly I called Henry to the door . Without hesitation I said , ' Go where you will , my boy ; but , till I call you , return not here . '
253054	253267	256363	256363	I	0	" Henry , I could see , did not like his dismissal . That boy is young , but a thinker ; his meditative eye shines on me strangely sometimes . He half feels what links me to Shirley ; he half guesses that there is a dearer delight in the reserve with which I am treated than in all the endearments he is allowed . The young , lame , half - grown lion would growl at me now and then , because I have tamed his lioness and am her keeper , did not the habit of discipline and the instinct of affection hold him subdued . Go , Henry ; you must learn to take your share of the bitter of life with all of Adam 's race that have gone before or will come after you . Your destiny can be no exception to the common lot ; be grateful that your love is overlooked thus early , before it can claim any affinity to passion . An hour 's fret , a pang of envy , suffice to express what you feel . Jealousy hot as the sun above the line , rage destructive as the tropic storm , the clime of your sensations ignores - as yet .
253268	253470	256363	256363	I	0	" I took my usual seat at the desk , quite in my usual way . I am blessed in that power to cover all inward ebullition with outward calm . No one who looks at my slow face can guess the vortex sometimes whirling in my heart , and engulfing thought and wrecking prudence . Pleasant is it to have the gift to proceed peacefully and powerfully in your course without alarming by one eccentric movement . It was not my present intention to utter one word of love to her , or to reveal one glimpse of the fire in which I wasted . Presumptuous I never have been ; presumptuous I never will be . Rather than even seem selfish and interested , I would resolutely rise , gird my loins , part and leave her , and seek , on the other side of the globe , a new life , cold and barren as the rock the salt tide daily washes . My design this morning was to take of her a near scrutiny - to read a line in the page of her heart . Before I left I determined to know what I was leaving .
253471	253514	256363	256363	I	0	" I had some quills to make into pens . Most men 's hands would have trembled when their hearts were so stirred ; mine went to work steadily , and my voice , when I called it into exercise , was firm .
253515	253530	256363	256363	I	0	" ' This day week you will be alone at Fieldhead , Miss Keeldar . '
253531	253550	256363	256363	I	0	" ' Yes : I rather think my uncle 's intention to go is a settled one now . '
253551	253558	256363	256363	I	0	" ' He leaves you dissatisfied . '
253559	253568	256363	256363	I	0	" ' He is not pleased with me . '
253569	253587	256363	256363	I	0	" ' He departs as he came - no better for his journey . This is mortifying . '
253588	253608	256363	256363	I	0	" ' I trust the failure of his plans will take from him all inclination to lay new ones . '
253609	253637	256363	256363	I	0	" ' In his way Mr. Sympson honestly wished you well . All he has done or intended to do he believed to be for the best . '
253638	253662	256363	256363	I	0	" ' You are kind to undertake the defence of a man who has permitted himself to treat you with so much insolence . '
253663	253703	256363	256363	I	0	" ' I never feel shocked at , or bear malice for , what is spoken in character ; and most perfectly in character was that vulgar and violent onset against me , when he had quitted you worsted . '
253704	253715	256363	256363	I	0	" ' You cease now to be Henry 's tutor ? '
253716	253775	256363	256363	I	0	" ' I shall be parted from Henry for a while if he and I live we shall meet again somehow , for we love each other and be ousted from the bosom of the Sympson family for ever . Happily this change does not leave me stranded ; it but hurries into premature execution designs long formed . '
253776	253914	256363	256363	I	0	" ' No change finds you off your guard . I was sure , in your calm way , you would be prepared for sudden mutation . I always think you stand in the world like a solitary but watchful , thoughtful archer in a wood . And the quiver on your shoulder holds more arrows than one ; your bow is provided with a second string . Such too is your brother 's wo nt . You two might go forth homeless hunters to the loneliest western wilds ; all would be well with you . The hewn tree would make you a hut , the cleared forest yield you fields from its stripped bosom , the buffalo would feel your rifle - shot , and with lowered horns and hump pay homage at your feet . '
253915	253933	256363	256363	I	0	" ' And any Indian tribe of Blackfeet or Flatheads would afford us a bride , perhaps ? '
253934	253978	256363	256363	I	0	" ' No ' hesitating , ' I think not . The savage is sordid . I think - that is , I hope - you would neither of you share your hearth with that to which you could not give your heart . '
253979	254028	256363	256363	I	0	" ' What suggested the wild West to your mind , Miss Keeldar ? Have you been with me in spirit when I did not see you ? Have you entered into my day - dreams , and beheld my brain labouring at its scheme of a future ? '
254029	254072	256363	256363	I	0	" She had separated a slip of paper for lighting tapers - a spill , as it is called - into fragments . She threw morsel by morsel into the fire , and stood pensively watching them consume . She did not speak .
254073	254088	256363	256363	I	0	" ' How did you learn what you seem to know about my intentions ? '
254089	254107	256363	256363	I	0	" ' I know nothing . I am only discovering them now . I spoke at hazard . '
254108	254298	256363	256363	I	0	" ' Your hazard sounds like divination . A tutor I will never be again ; never take a pupil after Henry and yourself ; not again will I sit habitually at another man 's table - no more be the appendage of a family . I am now a man of thirty ; I have never been free since I was a boy of ten . I have such a thirst for freedom , such a deep passion to know her and call her mine , such a day - desire and night - longing to win her and possess her , I will not refuse to cross the Atlantic for her sake ; her I will follow deep into virgin woods . Mine it shall not be to accept a savage girl as a slave - she could not be a wife . I know no white woman whom I love that would accompany me ; but I am certain Liberty will await me , sitting under a pine . When I call her she will come to my loghouse , and she shall fill my arms . '
254299	254398	256363	256363	I	0	" She could not hear me speak so unmoved , and she was moved . It was right - I meant to move her . She could not answer me , nor could she look at me . I should have been sorry if she could have done either . Her cheek glowed as if a crimson flower through whose petals the sun shone had cast its light upon it . On the white lid and dark lashes of her downcast eye trembled all that is graceful in the sense of half - painful , half - pleasing shame .
254399	254546	256363	256363	I	0	" Soon she controlled her emotion , and took all her feelings under command . I saw she had felt insurrection , and was waking to empire . She sat down . There was that in her face which I could read . It said , I see the line which is my limit ; nothing shall make me pass it . I feel - I know how far I may reveal my feelings , and when I must clasp the volume . I have advanced to a certain distance , as far as the true and sovereign and undegraded nature of my kind permits ; now here I stand rooted . My heart may break if it is baffled ; let it break . It shall never dishonour me ; it shall never dishonour my sisterhood in me . Suffering before degradation ! death before treachery !
254547	254647	256363	256363	I	0	" I , for my part , said , ' If she were poor , I would be at her feet ; if she were lowly , I would take her in my arms . Her gold and her station are two griffins that guard her on each side . Love looks and longs , and dares not ; Passion hovers round , and is kept at bay ; Truth and Devotion are scared . There is nothing to lose in winning her , no sacrifice to make . It is all clear gain , and therefore unimaginably difficult . '
254648	254714	256363	256363	I	0	" Difficult or not , something must be done , something must be said . I could not , and would not , sit silent with all that beauty modestly mute in my presence . I spoke thus , and still I spoke with calm . Quiet as my words were , I could hear they fell in a tone distinct , round , and deep .
254715	254958	256363	256363	I	0	" ' Still , I know I shall be strangely placed with that mountain nymph Liberty . She is , I suspect , akin to that Solitude which I once wooed , and from which I now seek a divorce . These Oreads are peculiar . They come upon you with an unearthly charm , like some starlight evening ; they inspire a wild but not warm delight ; their beauty is the beauty of spirits ; their grace is not the grace of life , but of seasons or scenes in nature . Theirs is the dewy bloom of morning , the languid flush of evening , the peace of the moon , the changefulness of clouds . I want and will have something different . This elfish splendour looks chill to my vision , and feels frozen to my touch . I am not a poet ; I can not live with abstractions . You , Miss Keeldar , have sometimes , in your laughing satire , called me a material philosopher , and implied that I live sufficiently for the substantial . Certainly I feel material from head to foot ; and glorious as Nature is , and deeply as I worship her with the solid powers of a solid heart , I would rather behold her through the soft human eyes of a loved and lovely wife than through the wild orbs of the highest goddess of Olympus .

I wish I could find such a one - pretty enough for me to love , with something of the mind and heart suited to my taste ; not uneducated - honest and modest . I care nothing for attainments , but I would fain have the germ of those sweet natural powers which nothing acquired can rival ; any temper Fate wills - I can manage the hottest . To such a creature as this I should like to be first tutor and then husband . I would teach her my language , my habits and my principles , and then I would reward her with my love . '
255111	255125	256363	256363	I	0	" ' Reward her , lord of the creation - reward her ! ' "

255297	255323	256363	256363	I	0	" I liked this . I had roused her from the pensive mood in which I had first found her . I would stir her further .

255366	255403	256363	256363	I	0	" She charmed me in this mood - waxing disdainful , half insulting ; pride , temper , derision , blent in her large fine eye , that had just now the look of a merlin 's .
255404	255419	256363	256363	I	0	" ' Favour me with your reasons for such an opinion , Miss Keeldar . '

255451	255478	256363	256363	I	0	" ' Accept celibacy ! ' and she made a gesture with her hand as if she gave me something ' take it as your doom ! '
255479	255522	256363	256363	I	0	" ' No ; you can not give what I already have . Celibacy has been mine for thirty years . If you wish to offer me a gift , a parting present , a keepsake , you must change the boon . '

255538	255599	256363	256363	I	0	" I now felt , and looked , and spoke eagerly . I was unwise to quit my sheet - anchor of calm even for an instant ; it deprived me of an advantage and transferred it to her . The little spark of temper dissolved in sarcasm , and eddied over her countenance in the ripples of a mocking smile .

255785	255940	256363	256363	I	0	" We had reached a critical point now , and we halted and looked at each other . She would not give in , I felt . Beyond this I neither felt nor saw . A few moments yet were mine . The end was coming - I heard its rush - but not come . I would dally , wait , talk , and when impulse urged I would act . I am never in a hurry ; I never was in a hurry in my whole life . Hasty people drink the nectar of existence scalding hot ; I taste it cool as dew . I proceeded : ' Apparently , Miss Keeldar , you are as little likely to marry as myself . I know you have refused three - nay , four - advantageous offers , and , I believe , a fifth . Have you rejected Sir Philip Nunnely ? '
255941	255949	256363	256363	I	0	" I put this question suddenly and promptly .

In summer , when you rise early , and run out into the fields to wet your feet with the dew , and freshen your cheek and uncurl your hair with the breeze , you always call him to follow you . You call him sometimes with a whistle that you learned from me . In the solitude of your wood , when you think nobody but Tartar is listening , you whistle the very tunes you imitated from my lips , or sing the very songs you have caught up by ear from my voice . I do not ask whence flows the feeling which you pour into these songs , for I know it flows out of your heart , Miss Keeldar . In the winter evenings Tartar lies at your feet . You suffer him to rest his head on your perfumed lap ; you let him couch on the borders of your satin raiment . His rough hide is familiar with the contact of your hand . I once saw you kiss him on that snow - white beauty spot which stars his broad forehead . It is dangerous to say I am like Tartar ; it suggests to me a claim to be treated like Tartar . '

Oh ' I went on , ' my orphan girl would give me many a kiss ; she would watch on the threshold for my coming home of an evening ; she would run into my arms ; she would keep my hearth as bright as she would make it warm .

I had gone too far not to finish ; I had come too near the end not to drive home to it . All the encumbrance of doubt , all the rubbish of indecision , must be removed at once , and the plain truth must be ascertained . She must take her part , and tell me what it was ; I must take mine and adhere to it .

257550	257601	256389	256389	I	0	" She trembled . She put her hand to mine as if to remove it from the lock . She might as well have tried to loosen , by her soft touch , metal welded to metal . She felt she was powerless , and receded ; and again she trembled .
257602	257679	256389	256389	I	0	" What change I underwent I can not explain , but out of her emotion passed into me a new spirit . I neither was crushed nor elated by her lands and gold ; I thought not of them , cared not for them . They were nothing - dross that could not dismay me .

258097	258166	256389	256389	I	0	" She took the coin out of her apron pocket , and showed it in her palm . I could have trifled with her , but it would not do ; life and death were at stake . Mastering at once the sixpence and the hand that held it , I demanded , ' Am I to die without you , or am I to live for you ? '

258400	258445	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Will you let me breathe , and not bewilder me ? You must not smile at present . The world swims and changes round me . The sun is a dizzying scarlet blaze , the sky a violet vortex whirling over me . '
258446	258515	256389	256389	I	0	" I am a strong man , but I staggered as I spoke . All creation was exaggerated . Colour grew more vivid , motion more rapid , life itself more vital . I hardly saw her for a moment , but I heard her voice - pitilessly sweet . She would not subdue one of her charms in compassion . Perhaps she did not know what I felt .
258516	258533	256389	256389	I	0	" ' You name me leopardess . Remember , the leopardess is tameless , ' said she .
258534	258548	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Tame or fierce , wild or subdued , you are mine . '
258549	258586	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I am glad I know my keeper and am used to him . Only his voice will I follow ; only his hand shall manage me ; only at his feet will I repose . '
258587	258622	256389	256389	I	0	" I took her back to her seat , and sat down by her side . I wanted to hear her speak again . I could never have enough of her voice and her words .
258623	258635	256389	256389	I	0	" ' How much do you love me ? ' I asked .
258636	258654	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Ah ! you know . I will not gratify you - I will not flatter . '
258655	258694	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I do n't know half enough ; my heart craves to be fed . If you knew how hungry and ferocious it is , you would hasten to stay it with a kind word or two . '
258695	258726	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Poor Tartar ! ' said she , touching and patting my hand - ' poor fellow , stalwart friend , Shirley 's pet and favourite , lie down ! '
258727	258744	256389	256389	I	0	" ' But I will not lie down till I am fed with one sweet word . '
258745	258752	256389	256389	I	0	" And at last she gave it .
258753	258782	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Dear Louis , be faithful to me ; never leave me . I do n't care for life unless I may pass it at your side . '
258783	258788	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Something more . '
258789	258807	256389	256389	I	0	" She gave me a change ; it was not her way to offer the same dish twice .
258808	258859	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Sir , ' she said , starting up , ' at your peril you ever again name such sordid things as money , or poverty , or inequality . It will be absolutely dangerous to torment me with these maddening scruples . I defy you to do it . '
258860	258905	256389	256389	I	0	" My face grew hot . I did once more wish I were not so poor or she were not so rich . She saw the transient misery ; and then , indeed , she caressed me . Blent with torment , I experienced rapture .
258906	259035	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Mr. Moore , ' said she , looking up with a sweet , open , earnest countenance , ' teach me and help me to be good . I do not ask you to take off my shoulders all the cares and duties of property , but I ask you to share the burden , and to show me how to sustain my part well . Your judgment is well balanced , your heart is kind , your principles are sound . I know you are wise ; I feel you are benevolent ; I believe you are conscientious . Be my companion through life ; be my guide where I am ignorant ; be my master where I am faulty ; be my friend always ! '
259036	259047	256389	256389	I	0	" ' So help me God , I will ! ' "
259074	259325	256389	256389	I	0	" The Sympsons are gone , but not before discovery and explanation . My manner must have betrayed something , or my looks . I was quiet , but I forgot to be guarded sometimes . I stayed longer in the room than usual ; I could not bear to be out of her presence ; I returned to it , and basked in it , like Tartar in the sun . If she left the oak parlour , instinctively I rose and left it too . She chid me for this procedure more than once . I did it with a vague , blundering idea of getting a word with her in the hall or elsewhere . Yesterday towards dusk I had her to myself for five minutes by the hall fire . We stood side by side ; she was railing at me , and I was enjoying the sound of her voice . The young ladies passed , and looked at us ; we did not separate . Ere long they repassed , and again looked . Mrs. Sympson came ; we did not move . Mr. Sympson opened the dining - room door . Shirley flashed him back full payment for his spying gaze . She curled her lip and tossed her tresses . The glance she gave was at once explanatory and defiant . It said : ' I like Mr. Moore 's society , and I dare you to find fault with my taste . '
259326	259341	256389	256389	I	0	" I asked , ' Do you mean him to understand how matters are ? '
259342	259510	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I do , ' said she ; ' but I leave the development to chance . There will be a scene . I neither invite it nor fear it ; only , you must be present , for I am inexpressibly tired of facing him solus . I do n't like to see him in a rage . He then puts off all his fine proprieties and conventional disguises , and the real human being below is what you would call commun , plat , bas - vilain et un peu méchant . His ideas are not clean , Mr. Moore ; they want scouring with soft soap and fuller 's earth . I think , if he could add his imagination to the contents of Mrs. Gill 's bucking - basket , and let her boil it in her copper , with rain - water and bleaching - powder I hope you think me a tolerable laundress , it would do him incalculable good . '
259511	259696	256389	256389	I	0	" This morning , fancying I heard her descend somewhat early , I was down instantly . I had not been deceived . There she was , busy at work in the breakfast - parlour , of which the housemaid was completing the arrangement and dusting . She had risen betimes to finish some little keepsake she intended for Henry . I got only a cool reception , which I accepted till the girl was gone , taking my book to the window - seat very quietly . Even when we were alone I was slow to disturb her . To sit with her in sight was happiness , and the proper happiness , for early morning - serene , incomplete , but progressive . Had I been obtrusive , I knew I should have encountered rebuff . ' Not at home to suitors ' was written on her brow . Therefore I read on , stole now and then a look , watched her countenance soften and open as she felt I respected her mood , and enjoyed the gentle content of the moment .
259697	259789	256389	256389	I	0	" The distance between us shrank , and the light hoar - frost thawed insensibly . Ere an hour elapsed I was at her side , watching her sew , gathering her sweet smiles and her merry words , which fell for me abundantly . We sat , as we had a right to sit , side by side ; my arm rested on her chair ; I was near enough to count the stitches of her work , and to discern the eye of her needle . The door suddenly opened .
259790	259858	256389	256389	I	0	" I believe , if I had just then started from her , she would have despised me . Thanks to the phlegm of my nature , I rarely start . When I am well - off , bien , comfortable , I am not soon stirred . Bien I was - tres bien - consequently immutable . No muscle moved . I hardly looked to the door .
259859	259885	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Good - morning , uncle , ' said she , addressing that personage , who paused on the threshold in a state of petrifaction .
259886	259903	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Have you been long downstairs , Miss Keeldar , and alone with Mr. Moore ? '
259904	259924	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Yes , a very long time . We both came down early ; it was scarcely light . '
259925	259933	256389	256389	I	0	" ' The proceeding is improper - - '
259934	259960	256389	256389	I	0	" ' It was at first , I was rather cross , and not civil ; but you will perceive that we are now friends . '
259961	259974	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I perceive more than you would wish me to perceive . '
259975	260023	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Hardly , sir , ' said I ; ' we have no disguises . Will you permit me to intimate that any further observations you have to make may as well be addressed to me ? Henceforward I stand between Miss Keeldar and all annoyance . '
260024	260037	256389	256389	I	0	" ' You ! What have you to do with Miss Keeldar ? '
260038	260049	256389	256389	I	0	" ' To protect , watch over , serve her . '
260050	260061	256389	256389	I	0	" ' You , sir - you , the tutor ? '
260062	260089	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Not one word of insult , sir , ' interposed she ; ' not one syllable of disrespect to Mr. Moore in this house . '
260090	260098	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Do you take his part ? '
260099	260107	256389	256389	I	0	" ' His part ? oh yes ! '
260108	260134	256389	256389	I	0	" She turned to me with a sudden fond movement , which I met by circling her with my arm . She and I both rose .
260135	260178	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Good Ged ! ' was the cry from the morning - gown standing quivering at the door . Ged , I think , must be the cognomen of Mr. Sympson 's Lares . When hard pressed he always invokes this idol .
260179	260198	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Come forward , uncle ; you shall hear all . - Tell him all , Louis . '
260199	260238	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I dare him to speak - the beggar ! the knave ! the specious hypocrite ! the vile , insinuating , infamous menial ! - Stand apart from my niece , sir . Let her go ! '
260239	260267	256389	256389	I	0	" She clung to me with energy . ' I am near my future husband , ' she said . ' Who dares touch him or me ? '
260268	260286	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Her husband ! ' He raised and spread his hands . He dropped into a seat .
260287	260335	256389	256389	I	0	" ' A while ago you wanted much to know whom I meant to marry . My intention was then formed , but not mature for communication . Now it is ripe , sun - mellowed , perfect . Take the crimson peach - take Louis Moore ! '
260336	260354	256389	256389	I	0	" ' But ' savagely ' you shall not have him ; he shall not have you . '
260355	260376	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I would die before I would have another . I would die if I might not have him . '
260377	260389	256389	256389	I	0	" He uttered words with which this page shall never be polluted .
260390	260532	256389	256389	I	0	" She turned white as death ; she shook all over ; she lost her strength . I laid her down on the sofa ; just looked to ascertain that she had not fainted - of which , with a divine smile , she assured me . I kissed her ; and then , if I were to perish , I can not give a clear account of what happened in the course of the next five minutes . She has since - through tears , laughter , and trembling - told me that I turned terrible , and gave myself to the demon . She says I left her , made one bound across the room ; that Mr. Sympson vanished through the door as if shot from a cannon . I also vanished , and she heard Mrs. Gill scream .
260533	260690	256389	256389	I	0	" Mrs. Gill was still screaming when I came to my senses . I was then in another apartment - the oak parlour , I think . I held Sympson before me crushed into a chair , and my hand was on his cravat . His eyes rolled in his head ; I was strangling him , I think . The housekeeper stood wringing her hands , entreating me to desist . I desisted that moment , and felt at once as cool as stone . But I told Mrs. Gill to fetch the Red - House Inn chaise instantly , and informed Mr. Sympson he must depart from Fieldhead the instant it came . Though half frightened out of his wits , he declared he would not . Repeating the former order , I added a commission to fetch a constable . I said , ' You shall go , by fair means or foul . '
260691	261061	261064	261064	he	5270	" He threatened prosecution ; I cared for nothing . I had stood over him once before , not quite so fiercely as now , but full as austerely . It was one night when burglars attempted the house at Sympson Grove , and in his wretched cowardice he would have given a vain alarm , without daring to offer defence . I had then been obliged to protect his family and his abode by mastering himself - and I had succeeded . I now remained with him till the chaise came . I marshalled him to it , he scolding all the way . He was terribly bewildered , as well as enraged . He would have resisted me , but knew not how . He called for his wife and daughters to come . I said they should follow him as soon as they could prepare . The smoke , the fume , the fret of his demeanour was inexpressible , but it was a fury incapable of producing a deed . That man , properly handled , must ever remain impotent . I know he will never touch me with the law . I know his wife , over whom he tyrannizes in trifles , guides him in matters of importance . I have long since earned her undying mother 's gratitude by my devotion to her boy . In some of Henry 's ailments I have nursed him - better , she said , than any woman could nurse . She will never forget that . She and her daughters quitted me to - day , in mute wrath and consternation ; but she respects me . When Henry clung to my neck as I lifted him into the carriage and placed him by her side , when I arranged her own wrapping to make her warm , though she turned her head from me , I saw the tears start to her eyes . She will but the more zealously advocate my cause because she has left me in anger . I am glad of this - not for my own sake , but for that of my life and idol - my Shirley . "
261072	261316	256389	256389	I	0	" I am now at Stilbro ' . I have taken up my temporary abode with a friend - a professional man , in whose business I can be useful . Every day I ride over to Fieldhead . How long will it be before I can call that place my home , and its mistress mine ? I am not easy , not tranquil ; I am tantalized , sometimes tortured . To see her now , one would think she had never pressed her cheek to my shoulder , or clung to me with tenderness or trust . I feel unsafe ; she renders me miserable . I am shunned when I visit her ; she withdraws from my reach . Once this day I lifted her face , resolved to get a full look down her deep , dark eyes . Difficult to describe what I read there ! Pantheress ! beautiful forest - born ! wily , tameless , peerless nature ! She gnaws her chain ; I see the white teeth working at the steel ! She has dreams of her wild woods and pinings after virgin freedom . I wish Sympson would come again , and oblige her again to entwine her arms about me . I wish there was danger she should lose me , as there is risk I shall lose her . No ; final loss I do not fear , but long delay - -
261317	261408	261064	261064	he	5270	" It is now night - midnight . I have spent the afternoon and evening at Fieldhead . Some hours ago she passed me , coming down the oak staircase to the hall . She did not know I was standing in the twilight , near the staircase window , looking at the frost - bright constellations . How closely she glided against the banisters ! How shyly shone her large eyes upon me ! How evanescent , fugitive , fitful she looked - slim and swift as a northern streamer !
261409	261613	256389	256389	I	0	" I followed her into the drawing - room . Mrs. Pryor and Caroline Helstone were both there ; she has summoned them to bear her company awhile . In her white evening dress , with her long hair flowing full and wavy , with her noiseless step , her pale cheek , her eye full of night and lightning , she looked , I thought , spirit - like - a thing made of an element , the child of a breeze and a flame , the daughter of ray and raindrop - a thing never to be overtaken , arrested , fixed . I wished I could avoid following her with my gaze as she moved here and there , but it was impossible . I talked with the other ladies as well as I could , but still I looked at her . She was very silent ; I think she never spoke to me - not even when she offered me tea . It happened that she was called out a minute by Mrs. Gill . I passed into the moonlit hall , with the design of getting a word as she returned ; nor in this did I fail .
261614	261629	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Miss Keeldar , stay one instant , ' said I , meeting her .
261630	261640	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Why ? the hall is too cold . '
261641	261661	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' It is not cold for me ; at my side it should not be cold for you . '
261662	261668	256389	256389	I	0	" ' But I shiver . '
261669	261691	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' With fear , I believe . What makes you fear me ? You are quiet and distant . Why ? '
261692	261711	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I may well fear what looks like a great dark goblin meeting me in the moonlight . '
261712	261750	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Do not - do not pass ! Stay with me awhile . Let us exchange a few quiet words . It is three days since I spoke to you alone . Such changes are cruel . '
261751	261799	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I have no wish to be cruel , ' she responded , softly enough . Indeed there was softness in her whole deportment - in her face , in her voice ; but there was also reserve , and an air fleeting , evanishing , intangible .
261800	261855	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' You certainly give me pain , ' said I. ' It is hardly a week since you called me your future husband and treated me as such . Now I am once more the tutor for you . I am addressed as Mr. Moore and sir . Your lips have forgotten Louis . '
261856	261876	256389	256389	I	0	" ' No , Louis , no . It is an easy , liquid name - not soon forgotten . '
261877	261893	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Be cordial to Louis , then ; approach him - let him approach . '
261894	261910	256389	256389	I	0	" ' I am cordial , ' said she , hovering aloof like a white shadow .
261911	261938	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Your voice is very sweet and very low , ' I answered , quietly advancing . ' You seem subdued , but still startled . '
261939	261955	256389	256389	I	0	" ' No - quite calm , and afraid of nothing , ' she assured me .
261956	261964	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Of nothing but your votary . '
261965	261976	256389	256389	I	0	" I bent a knee to the flags at her feet .
261977	262016	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' You see I am in a new world , Mr. Moore . I do n't know myself ; I do n't know you . But rise . When you do so I feel troubled and disturbed . '
262017	262052	256389	256389	I	0	" I obeyed . It would not have suited me to retain that attitude long . I courted serenity and confidence for her , and not vainly . She trusted and clung to me again .
262053	262080	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Now , Shirley , ' I said , ' you can conceive I am far from happy in my present uncertain , unsettled state . '
262081	262113	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Oh yes , you are happy ! ' she cried hastily . ' You do n't know how happy you are . Any change will be for the worse . '
262114	262139	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Happy or not , I can not bear to go on so much longer . You are too generous to require it . '
262140	262158	256389	256389	I	0	" ' Be reasonable , Louis ; be patient ! I like you because you are patient . '
262159	262187	261064	261064	he	5270	" ' Like me no longer , then ; love me instead . Fix our marriage day ; think of it to - night , and decide . '
262188	262212	262412	262413	the public	8169	" She breathed a murmur , inarticulate yet expressive ; darted , or melted , from my arms - and I lost her . "
262436	262439	262412	262413	the public	8169	" Impossible ! "
262445	262448	262486	262486	they	8169	" untrue ! "
262454	262457	263459	263459	You	5340	" inartistic ! "
263453	263458	263941	263944	the Lord of hosts	5366	" dead - thraw . "
263946	263955	263935	263935	their	5365	" thundering with the voice of His excellency . "
263956	263994	263941	263944	the Lord of hosts	5366	" Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow ? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail , which I have reserved against the time of trouble , against the day of battle and war ?

264028	264037	264154	264154	you	5374	" as the blood of a dead man ; "
264150	264153	264886	264886	her	2856	" dotard ; "
264874	264884	264949	264949	she	372	" Go to Mr. Moore , ask Mr. Moore , "
264945	264948	264949	264949	she	372	" Louis , "
264952	264980	265241	265241	she	279	" would never have learned to rule if she had not ceased to govern . The incapacity of the sovereign had developed the powers of the premier . "
265270	265300	265358	265359	the intruder	4852	" I am looking at Venus , mamma . See , she is beautiful . How white her lustre is , compared with the deep red of the bonfires ! "
265344	265356	265358	265359	the intruder	4852	" I have been sitting with ' mamma ' an hour , "
265361	265379	265656	265656	Her	5418	" I have had a long conversation with her . Where , meantime , have you been ? "
265380	265482	265358	265359	the intruder	4852	" To Fieldhead . Shirley is as naughty as ever , Robert . She will neither say Yes nor No to any question put . She sits alone . I can not tell whether she is melancholy or nonchalant . If you rouse her or scold her , she gives you a look , half wistful , half reckless , which sends you away as queer and crazed as herself . What Louis will make of her , I can not tell . For my part , if I were a gentleman , I think I would not dare undertake her . "
265483	265567	265656	265656	Her	5418	" Never mind them . They were cut out for each other . Louis , strange to say , likes her all the better for these freaks . He will manage her , if any one can . She tries him , however . He has had a stormy courtship for such a calm character ; but you see it all ends in victory for him . Caroline , I have sought you to ask an audience . Why are those bells ringing ? "
265568	265592	265358	265359	the intruder	4852	" For the repeal of your terrible law - the Orders you hate so much . You are pleased , are you not ? "
265593	265645	265656	265656	Her	5418	" Yesterday evening at this time I was packing some books for a sea - voyage . They were the only possessions , except some clothes , seeds , roots , and tools , which I felt free to take with me to Canada . I was going to leave you . "
265646	265655	265697	265697	She	5418	" To leave me ? To leave me ? "
265670	265696	265753	265753	she	5418	" Not now - not now . Examine my face - yes , look at me well . Is the despair of parting legible thereon ? "
265738	265752	265859	265859	his	5420	" Will the repeal do you good - much good , immediate good ? "
265756	265856	265993	265993	his	5421	" The repeal of the Orders in Council saves me . Now I shall not turn bankrupt ; now I shall not give up business ; now I shall not leave England ; now I shall be no longer poor ; now I can pay my debts ; now all the cloth I have in my warehouses will be taken off my hands , and commissions given me for much more . This day lays for my fortunes a broad , firm foundation , on which , for the first time in my life , I can securely build . "
265875	265886	265989	265989	He	5421	" You are saved ? Your heavy difficulties are lifted ? "
265887	265899	265993	265993	his	5421	" They are lifted . I breathe . I can act . "
265900	265915	265989	265989	He	5421	" At last ! Oh , Providence is kind ! Thank Him , Robert . "
265916	265922	265993	265993	his	5421	" I do thank Providence . "
265923	265932	265989	265989	He	5421	" And I also , for your sake ! "
265938	265988	266004	266004	he	5421	" Now I can take more workmen , give better wages , lay wiser and more liberal plans , do some good , be less selfish . Now , Caroline , I can have a house - a home which I can truly call mine - and now - - "
265999	266003	266004	266004	he	5421	" And now , "
266007	266022	266139	266139	His	5422	" now I can think of marriage , now I can seek a wife . "
266037	266138	265993	265993	his	5421	" Will Caroline , who meekly hopes to be forgiven as she forgives - will she pardon all I have made her suffer , all that long pain I have wickedly caused her , all that sickness of body and mind she owed to me ? Will she forget what she knows of my poor ambition , my sordid schemes ? Will she let me expiate these things ? Will she suffer me to prove that , as I once deserted cruelly , trifled wantonly , injured basely , I can now love faithfully , cherish fondly , treasure tenderly ? "
266153	266158	266139	266139	His	5422	" Is Caroline mine ? "
266159	266164	265993	265993	his	5421	" Caroline is yours . "
266165	266217	266139	266139	His	5422	" I will prize her . The sense of her value is here , in my heart ; the necessity for her society is blended with my life . Not more jealous shall I be of the blood whose flow moves my pulses than of her happiness and well - being . "
266218	266235	265993	265993	his	5421	" I love you , too , Robert , and will take faithful care of you . "
266236	266322	266340	266340	Moore	481	" Will you take faithful care of me ? Faithful care ! As if that rose should promise to shelter from tempest this hard gray stone ! But she will care for me , in her way . These hands will be the gentle ministrants of every comfort I can taste . I know the being I seek to entwine with my own will bring me a solace , a charity , a purity , to which , of myself , I am a stranger . "
266332	266338	266139	266139	His	5422	" What flutters my dove ? "
266353	266368	266139	266139	His	5422	" Poor mamma ! I am all mamma has . Must I leave her ? "
266369	266389	266139	266139	His	5422	" Do you know , I thought of that difficulty . I and ' mamma ' have discussed it . "
266390	266436	266139	266139	His	5422	" Tell me what you wish , what you would like , and I will consider if it is possible to consent . But I can not desert her , even for you . I can not break her heart , even for your sake . "
266437	266465	266139	266139	His	5422	" She was faithful when I was false - was she not ? I never came near your sick - bed , and she watched it ceaselessly . "
266466	266477	266139	266139	His	5422	" What must I do ? Anything but leave her . "
266478	266488	266139	266139	His	5422	" At my wish you never shall leave her . "
266489	266497	266139	266139	His	5422	" She may live very near us ? "
266498	266518	266139	266139	His	5422	" With us - only she will have her own rooms and servant . For this she stipulates herself . "
266519	266538	266139	266139	His	5422	" You know she has an income , that , with her habits , makes her quite independent ? "
266539	266556	266139	266139	His	5422	" She told me that , with a gentle pride that reminded me of somebody else . "
266557	266570	266139	266139	His	5422	" She is not at all interfering , and incapable of gossip . "
266571	266603	266139	266139	His	5422	" I know her , Cary . But if , instead of being the personification of reserve and discretion , she were something quite opposite , I should not fear her . "
266604	266616	266139	266139	His	5422	" Yet she will be your mother - in - law ? "
266628	266681	266139	266139	His	5422	" Louis and I are not of the order of men who fear their mothers - in - law , Cary . Our foes never have been , nor will be , those of our own household . I doubt not my mother - in - law will make much of me . "
266682	266749	266139	266139	His	5422	" That she will - in her quiet way , you know . She is not demonstrative ; and when you see her silent , or even cool , you must not fancy her displeased ; it is only a manner she has . Be sure to let me interpret for her whenever she puzzles you ; always believe my account of the matter , Robert . "
266750	266824	266139	266139	His	5422	" Oh , implicitly ! Jesting apart , I feel that she and I will suit - on ne peut mieux . Hortense , you know , is exquisitely susceptible - in our French sense of the word - and not , perhaps , always reasonable in her requirements ; yet , dear , honest girl , I never painfully wounded her feelings or had a serious quarrel with her in my life . "
266825	266875	266139	266139	His	5422	" No ; you are most generously considerate , indeed , most tenderly indulgent to her ; and you will be considerate with mamma . You are a gentleman all through , Robert , to the bone , and nowhere so perfect a gentleman as at your own fireside . "
266876	266900	266139	266139	His	5422	" A eulogium I like ; it is very sweet . I am well pleased my Caroline should view me in this light . "
266901	266911	266139	266139	His	5422	" Mamma just thinks of you as I do . "
266912	266919	266139	266139	His	5422	" Not quite , I hope ? "
266920	266973	266139	266139	His	5422	" She does not want to marry you - do n't be vain ; but she said to me the other day , ' My dear , Mr. Moore has pleasing manners ; he is one of the few gentlemen I have seen who combine politeness with an air of sincerity . ' "
266974	266996	266139	266139	His	5422	" ' Mamma ' is rather a misanthropist , is she not ? Not the best opinion of the sterner sex ? "
266997	267052	266139	266139	His	5422	" She forbears to judge them as a whole , but she has her exceptions whom she admires - Louis and Mr. Hall , and , of late , yourself . She did not like you once ; I knew that , because she would never speak of you . But , Robert - - "
267053	267065	266139	266139	His	5422	" Well , what now ? What is the new thought ? "
267066	267075	266139	266139	His	5422	" You have not seen my uncle yet ? "
267076	267125	266139	266139	His	5422	" I have . ' Mamma ' called him into the room . He consents conditionally . If I prove that I can keep a wife , I may have her ; and I can keep her better than he thinks - better than I choose to boast . "
267126	267141	266139	266139	His	5422	" If you get rich you will do good with your money , Robert ? "
267142	267616	266139	266139	His	5422	" I will do good ; you shall tell me how . Indeed , I have some schemes of my own , which you and I will talk about on our own hearth one day . I have seen the necessity of doing good ; I have learned the downright folly of being selfish . Caroline , I foresee what I will now foretell . This war must ere long draw to a close . Trade is likely to prosper for some years to come . There may be a brief misunderstanding between England and America , but that will not last . What would you think if , one day - perhaps ere another ten years elapse - Louis and I divide Briarfield parish betwixt us ? Louis , at any rate , is certain of power and property . He will not bury his talents . He is a benevolent fellow , and has , besides , an intellect of his own of no trifling calibre . His mind is slow but strong . It must work . It may work deliberately , but it will work well . He will be made magistrate of the district - Shirley says he shall . She would proceed impetuously and prematurely to obtain for him this dignity , if he would let her , but he will not . As usual , he will be in no haste . Ere he has been master of Fieldhead a year all the district will feel his quiet influence , and acknowledge his unassuming superiority . A magistrate is wanted ; they will , in time , invest him with the office voluntarily and unreluctantly . Everybody admires his future wife , and everybody will , in time , like him . He is of the pâte generally approved , bon comme le pain - daily bread for the most fastidious , good for the infant and the aged , nourishing for the poor , wholesome for the rich . Shirley , in spite of her whims and oddities , her dodges and delays , has an infatuated fondness for him . She will one day see him as universally beloved as even she could wish . He will also be universally esteemed , considered , consulted , depended on - too much so . His advice will be always judicious , his help always good - natured . Ere long both will be in inconvenient request . He will have to impose restrictions . As for me , if I succeed as I intend to do , my success will add to his and Shirley 's income . I can double the value of their mill property . I can line yonder barren Hollow with lines of cottages and rows of cottage - gardens - - "
267617	267626	266139	266139	His	5422	" Robert ! And root up the copse ? "
267627	267714	266139	266139	His	5422	" The copse shall be firewood ere five years elapse . The beautiful wild ravine shall be a smooth descent ; the green natural terrace shall be a paved street . There shall be cottages in the dark ravine , and cottages on the lonely slopes . The rough pebbled track shall be an even , firm , broad , black , sooty road , bedded with the cinders from my mill ; and my mill , Caroline - my mill shall fill its present yard . "
267715	267734	266139	266139	His	5422	" Horrible ! You will change our blue hill - country air into the Stilbro ' smoke atmosphere . "
267735	267749	266139	266139	His	5422	" I will pour the waters of Pactolus through the valley of Briarfield . "
267750	267760	266139	266139	His	5422	" I like the beck a thousand times better . "
267761	267779	266139	266139	His	5422	" I will get an Act for enclosing Nunnely Common , and parcelling it out into farms . "
267780	267807	266139	266139	His	5422	" Stilbro ' Moor , however , defies you , thank Heaven ! What can you grow in Bilberry Moss ? What will flourish on Rushedge ? "
267808	267866	267937	267937	She	5424	" Caroline , the houseless , the starving , the unemployed shall come to Hollow 's Mill from far and near ; and Joe Scott shall give them work , and Louis Moore , Esq . , shall let them a tenement , and Mrs. Gill shall mete them a portion till the first pay - day . "
267874	267936	267967	267967	Moore	539	" Such a Sunday school as you will have , Cary ! such collections as you will get ! such a day school as you and Shirley and Miss Ainley will have to manage between you ! The mill shall find salaries for a master and mistress , and the squire or the clothier shall give a treat once a quarter . "
267959	267965	267967	267967	Moore	539	" Extravagant day - dreams , "
267975	268001	268316	268316	she	5443	" yet perhaps we may realize some of them . Meantime , the dew is falling . Mrs. Moore , I shall take you in . "
268311	268314	268316	268316	she	5443	" Ay , "
268318	268467	268316	268316	she	5443	" this world has queer changes . I can remember the old mill being built - the very first it was in all the district ; and then I can remember it being pulled down , and going with my lake - lasses companions to see the foundation - stone of the new one laid . The two Mr. Moores made a great stir about it . They were there , and a deal of fine folk besides , and both their ladies ; very bonny and grand they looked . But Mrs. Louis was the grandest ; she always wore such handsome dresses . Mrs. Robert was quieter like . Mrs. Louis smiled when she talked . She had a real , happy , glad , good - natured look ; but she had een that pierced a body through . There is no such ladies nowadays . "
268468	268478	268316	268316	she	5443	" What was the Hollow like then , Martha ? "
268479	268607	None	None	None	None	" Different to what it is now ; but I can tell of it clean different again , when there was neither mill , nor cot , nor hall , except Fieldhead , within two miles of it . I can tell , one summer evening , fifty years syne , my mother coming running in just at the edge of dark , almost fleyed out of her wits , saying she had seen a fairish fairy in Fieldhead Hollow ; and that was the last fairish that ever was seen on this countryside though they 've been heard within these forty years . A lonesome spot it was , and a bonny spot , full of oak trees and nut trees . It is altered now . "
