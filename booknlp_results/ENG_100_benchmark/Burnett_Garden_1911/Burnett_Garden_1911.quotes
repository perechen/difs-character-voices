423	437	416	416	she	31	" I will not let you stay . Send my Ayah to me . "
628	637	638	638	she	31	" Pig ! Pig ! Daughter of Pigs ! "
823	828	819	819	Mary	31	" full of lace . "
864	876	879	879	her	124	" Is it so very bad ? Oh , is it ? "
882	885	886	888	the young man	161	" Awfully , "
895	913	886	888	the young man	161	" Awfully , Mrs. Lennox . You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago . "
921	929	930	930	she	31	" Oh , I know I ought ! "
933	951	930	930	she	31	" I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party . What a fool I was ! "
994	1003	1004	1005	Mrs. Lennox	36	" What is it ? What is it ? "
1008	1014	1016	1018	the boy officer	165	" Some one has died , "
1020	1033	1004	1005	Mrs. Lennox	36	" You did not say it had broken out among your servants . "
1034	1040	1041	1043	the Mem Sahib	31	" I did not know ! "
1046	1055	1057	1057	she	31	" Come with me ! Come with me ! "
1693	1701	1702	1702	she	31	" How queer and quiet it is , "
1705	1723	1702	1702	she	31	" It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake . "
1779	1783	1786	1787	one voice	210	" What desolation ! "
1790	1818	1786	1787	one voice	210	" That pretty , pretty woman ! I suppose the child , too . I heard there was a child , though no one ever saw her . "
1901	1904	1905	1905	he	213	" Barney ! "
1909	1934	1905	1905	he	213	" There is a child here ! A child alone ! In a place like this ! Mercy on us , who is she ! "
1935	1941	1942	1944	the little girl	216	" I am Mary Lennox , "
1965	1971	1954	1955	the man	217	" A place like this ! "
1972	1994	1952	1952	She	31	" I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up . Why does nobody come ? "
1995	2005	2007	2008	the man	217	" It is the child no one ever saw ! "
2015	2022	2007	2008	the man	217	" She has actually been forgotten ! "
2023	2029	2030	2030	Mary	38	" Why was I forgotten ? "
2037	2043	2030	2030	Mary	38	" Why does nobody come ? "
2073	2078	2079	2079	he	222	" Poor little kid ! "
2082	2090	2079	2079	he	222	" There is nobody left to come . "
2544	2562	2563	2563	he	39	" Why do n't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery ? "
2566	2572	2574	2574	he	39	" There in the middle , "
2581	2585	2587	2587	Mary	38	" Go away ! "
2589	2599	2587	2587	Mary	38	" I do n't want boys . Go away ! "
2635	2663	2664	2664	He	39	" Mistress Mary , quite contrary , How does your garden grow ? With silver bells , and cockle shells , And marigolds all in a row . "
2687	2693	2685	2685	they	247	" Mistress Mary , quite contrary "
2708	2713	2705	2705	they	247	" Mistress Mary Quite Contrary "
2731	2740	2741	2741	Basil	39	" You are going to be sent home , "
2746	2761	2741	2741	Basil	39	" at the end of the week . And we 're glad of it . "
2762	2771	2773	2773	Mary	38	" I am glad of it , too , "
2775	2780	2741	2741	Basil	39	" Where is home ? "
2781	2790	2792	2792	Basil	39	" She does n't know where home is ! "
2802	2851	2792	2792	Basil	39	" It 's England , of course . Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent to her last year . You are not going to your grandmama . You have none . You are going to your uncle . His name is Mr. Archibald Craven . "
2852	2861	2863	2863	Mary	38	" I do n't know anything about him , "
2865	2872	2873	2873	Basil	39	" I know you do n't , "
2876	2948	2873	2873	Basil	39	" You do n't know anything . Girls never do . I heard father and mother talking about him . He lives in a great , big , desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him . He 's so cross he wo n't let them , and they would n't come if he would let them . He 's a hunchback , and he 's horrid . "
2949	2956	2958	2958	Mary	38	" I do n't believe you , "
3080	3088	3089	3090	Mrs. Crawford	42	" She is such a plain child , "
3096	3155	3089	3090	Mrs. Crawford	42	" And her mother was such a pretty creature . She had a very pretty manner , too , and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child . The children call her ' Mistress Mary Quite Contrary , ' and though it 's naughty of them , one ca n't help understanding it . "
3156	3212	3074	3075	Mr. Crawford	43	" Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too . It is very sad , now the poor beautiful thing is gone , to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all . "
3213	3223	3225	3226	Mrs. Crawford	42	" I believe she scarcely ever looked at her , "
3228	3291	3225	3226	Mrs. Crawford	42	" When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing . Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow . Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room . "
3461	3474	3475	3475	she	45	" My word ! she 's a plain little piece of goods ! "
3478	3504	3475	3475	she	45	" And we 'd heard that her mother was a beauty . She has n't handed much of it down , has she , ma'am ? "
3505	3515	3516	3517	the officer	264	" Perhaps she will improve as she grows older , "
3525	3549	3516	3517	the officer	264	" If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression , her features are rather good . Children alter so much . "
3550	3560	3562	3563	Mrs. Medlock	45	" She 'll have to alter a good deal , "
3565	3582	3562	3563	Mrs. Medlock	45	" And , there 's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite if you ask me ! "
3946	4030	3930	3930	She	45	" At least , that is what she would have said if she had been asked . She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria 's daughter was going to be married , but she had a comfortable , well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do . She never dared even to ask a question .
4031	4042	4048	4048	his	41	" Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera , "
4054	4088	4048	4048	his	41	" Captain Lennox was my wife 's brother and I am their daughter 's guardian . The child is to be brought here . You must go to London and bring her yourself . "
4163	4178	4179	4180	Mrs. Medlock	45	" A more marred - looking young one I never saw in my life , "
4228	4245	4246	4246	she	45	" I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to , "
4249	4258	4246	4246	she	45	" Do you know anything about your uncle ? "
4259	4262	4264	4264	Mary	38	" No , "
4266	4277	4246	4246	she	45	" Never heard your father and mother talk about him ? "
4278	4281	4283	4283	Mary	38	" No , "
4314	4317	4319	4320	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Humph , "
4347	4369	4343	4343	she	45	" I suppose you might as well be told something to prepare you . You are going to a queer place . "
4398	4507	4508	4508	She	45	" Not but that it 's a grand big place in a gloomy way , and Mr. Craven 's proud of it in his way and that 's gloomy enough , too . The house is six hundred years old and it 's on the edge of the moor , and there 's near a hundred rooms in it , though most of them 's shut up and locked . And there 's pictures and fine old furniture and things that 's been there for ages , and there 's a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground some of them . "
4515	4522	4523	4523	she	45	" But there 's nothing else , "
4579	4582	4584	4585	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Well , "
4587	4595	4584	4585	Mrs. Medlock	45	" What do you think of it ? "
4596	4599	4600	4600	she	38	" Nothing , "
4603	4611	4600	4600	she	38	" I know nothing about such places . "
4623	4626	4627	4627	she	45	" Eh ! "
4630	4644	4627	4627	she	45	" but you are like an old woman . Do n't you care ? "
4645	4650	4652	4652	Mary	38	" It does n't matter "
4654	4661	4652	4652	Mary	38	" whether I care or not . "
4662	4669	4671	4672	Mrs. Medlock	45	" You are right enough there , "
4674	4726	4671	4672	Mrs. Medlock	45	" It does n't . What you 're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I do n't know , unless because it 's the easiest way . He 's not going to trouble himself about you , that 's sure and certain . He never troubles himself about no one . "
4740	4748	4749	4749	she	45	" He 's got a crooked back , "
4752	4780	4749	4749	she	45	" That set him wrong . He was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married . "
4848	4904	4822	4822	she	45	" She was a sweet , pretty thing and he 'd have walked the world over to get her a blade o ' grass she wanted . Nobody thought she 'd marry him , but she did , and people said she married him for his money . But she did n't she did n't , "
4907	4911	4822	4822	she	45	" When she died "
4919	4926	4927	4927	she	38	" Oh ! did she die ! "
4948	4954	4927	4927	she	38	" Riquet a la Houppe . "
4978	4984	4985	4986	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Yes , she died , "
4989	5065	4985	4986	Mrs. Medlock	45	" And it made him queerer than ever . He cares about nobody . He wo n't see people . Most of the time he goes away , and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and wo n't let any one but Pitcher see him . Pitcher 's an old fellow , but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways . "
5201	5206	5208	5208	she	309	" full of lace . "
5215	5232	5234	5235	Mrs. Medlock	45	" You need n't expect to see him , because ten to one you wo n't , "
5237	5311	5234	5235	Mrs. Medlock	45	" And you must n't expect that there will be people to talk to you . You 'll have to play about and look after yourself . You 'll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you 're to keep out of . There 's gardens enough . But when you 're in the house do n't go wandering and poking about . Mr. Craven wo n't have it . "
5312	5322	5324	5326	sour little Mary	38	" I shall not want to go poking about , "
5589	5596	5597	5597	she	45	" You have had a sleep ! "
5600	5624	5597	5597	she	45	" It 's time to open your eyes ! We 're at Thwaite Station and we 've got a long drive before us . "
5728	5736	5737	5737	he	330	" I see tha 's got back , "
5740	5754	5737	5737	he	330	" An ' tha 's browt th ' young ' un with thee . "
5755	5762	5764	5765	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Aye , that 's her , "
5783	5789	5775	5775	her	45	" How 's thy Missus ? "
5790	5804	5775	5775	her	45	" Well enow . Th ' carriage is waitin ' outside for thee . "
5985	5991	5992	5992	she	38	" What is a moor ? "
5999	6014	6015	6016	the woman	140	" Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you 'll see , "
6019	6055	6015	6016	the woman	140	" We 've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor . You wo n't see much because it 's a dark night , but you can see something . "
6261	6273	6275	6276	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Eh ! We 're on the moor now sure enough , "
6335	6347	6349	6349	Mary	38	" It 's it 's not the sea , is it ? "
6357	6363	6365	6366	Mrs. Medlock	45	" No , not it , "
6368	6409	6365	6366	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Nor it is n't fields nor mountains , it 's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom , and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep . "
6410	6428	6430	6430	Mary	38	" I feel as if it might be the sea , if there were water on it , "
6432	6441	6430	6430	Mary	38	" It sounds like the sea just now . "
6442	6452	6453	6454	Mrs. Medlock	45	" That 's the wind blowing through the bushes , "
6457	6485	6453	6454	Mrs. Medlock	45	" It 's a wild , dreary enough place to my mind , though there 's plenty that likes it particularly when the heather 's in bloom . "
6580	6587	6588	6588	she	38	" I do n't like it , "
6593	6600	6602	6602	she	38	" I do n't like it , "
6647	6662	6663	6663	she	45	" Eh , I am glad to see that bit o ' light twinkling , "
6666	6692	6663	6663	she	45	" It 's the light in the lodge window . We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit , at all events . "
6695	6700	6702	6702	she	45	" after a bit , "
6930	6940	6941	6941	he	381	" You are to take her to her room , "
6948	6966	6941	6941	he	381	" He does n't want to see her . He 's going to London in the morning . "
6967	6974	6975	6976	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Very well , Mr. Pitcher , "
6979	6995	6975	6976	Mrs. Medlock	45	" So long as I know what 's expected of me , I can manage . "
6996	7006	7007	7008	Mr. Pitcher	49	" What 's expected of you , Mrs. Medlock , "
7011	7036	7007	7008	Mr. Pitcher	49	" is that you make sure that he 's not disturbed and that he does n't see what he does n't want to see . "
7097	7127	7092	7093	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Well , here you are ! This room and the next are where you 'll live and you must keep to them . Do n't you forget that ! "
7323	7328	7329	7329	she	38	" What is that ? "
7357	7361	7362	7362	she	50	" That there ? "
7365	7368	7338	7338	Martha	50	" Yes . "
7369	7376	7338	7338	Martha	50	" That 's th ' moor , "
7384	7391	7338	7338	Martha	50	" Does tha ' like it ? "
7392	7395	7397	7397	Mary	38	" No , "
7399	7404	7397	7397	Mary	38	" I hate it . "
7405	7415	7416	7416	Martha	50	" That 's because tha'rt not used to it , "
7425	7445	7416	7416	Martha	50	" Tha ' thinks it 's too big an ' bare now . But tha ' will like it . "
7446	7450	7452	7452	Mary	38	" Do you ? "
7454	7461	7463	7463	Martha	50	" Aye , that I do , "
7472	7577	7463	7463	Martha	50	" I just love it . It 's none bare . It 's covered wi ' growin ' things as smells sweet . It 's fair lovely in spring an ' summer when th ' gorse an ' broom an ' heather 's in flower . It smells o ' honey an ' there 's such a lot o ' fresh air an ' th ' sky looks so high an ' th ' bees an ' skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin ' an ' singin ' . Eh ! I would n't live away from th ' moor for anythin ' . "
7634	7639	7628	7628	They	401	" protector of the poor "
7664	7666	7673	7673	Mary	38	" please "
7668	7671	7673	7673	Mary	38	" thank you "
7748	7755	7756	7756	she	38	" You are a strange servant , "
7792	7799	7800	7800	she	50	" Eh ! I know that , "
7803	7939	7800	7800	she	50	" If there was a grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th ' under house - maids . I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I 'd never have been let upstairs . I 'm too common an ' I talk too much Yorkshire . But this is a funny house for all it 's so grand . Seems like there 's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an ' Mrs. Medlock . Mr. Craven , he wo n't be troubled about anythin ' when he 's here , an ' he 's nearly always away . Mrs. Medlock gave me th ' place out o ' kindness . She told me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses . "
7940	7949	7950	7950	Mary	38	" Are you going to be my servant ? "
7969	7977	7978	7978	she	50	" I 'm Mrs. Medlock 's servant , "
7982	8019	7978	7978	she	50	" An ' she 's Mr. Craven 's but I 'm to do the housemaid 's work up here an ' wait on you a bit . But you wo n't need much waitin ' on . "
8020	8028	8030	8030	Mary	38	" Who is going to dress me ? "
8051	8059	8060	8060	she	50	" Canna ' tha ' dress thysen ! "
8063	8076	8078	8078	Mary	38	" What do you mean ? I do n't understand your language , "
8080	8086	8087	8087	Martha	50	" Eh ! I forgot , "
8090	8123	8087	8087	Martha	50	" Mrs. Medlock told me I 'd have to be careful or you would n't know what I was sayin ' . I mean ca n't you put on your own clothes ? "
8124	8127	8129	8129	Mary	38	" No , "
8134	8150	8129	8129	Mary	38	" I never did in my life . My Ayah dressed me , of course . "
8151	8154	8156	8156	Martha	50	" Well , "
8169	8239	8156	8156	Martha	50	" it 's time tha ' should learn . Tha ' can not begin younger . It 'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit . My mother always said she could n't see why grand people 's children did n't turn out fair fools what with nurses an ' bein ' washed an ' dressed an ' took out to walk as if they was puppies ! "
8240	8247	8249	8250	Mistress Mary	38	" It is different in India , "
8267	8277	8278	8278	she	50	" Eh ! I can see it 's different , "
8283	8323	8278	8278	she	50	" I dare say it 's because there 's such a lot o ' blacks there instead o ' respectable white people . When I heard you was comin ' from India I thought you was a black too . "
8331	8334	8335	8335	she	38	" What ! "
8338	8355	8335	8335	she	38	" What ! You thought I was a native . You you daughter of a pig ! "
8362	8370	8371	8371	she	38	" Who are you callin ' names ? "
8374	8489	8371	8371	she	38	" You need n't be so vexed . That 's not th ' way for a young lady to talk . I 've nothin' against th ' blacks . When you read about 'em in tracts they 're always very religious . You always read as a black 's a man an ' a brother . I 've never seen a black an ' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close . When I come in to light your fire this mornin ' I crep ' up to your bed an ' pulled th ' cover back careful to look at you . An ' there you was , "
8492	8505	8371	8371	she	38	" no more black than me for all you 're so yeller . "
8518	8562	8506	8506	Mary	38	" You thought I was a native ! You dared ! You do n't know anything about natives ! They are not people they 're servants who must salaam to you . You know nothing about India . You know nothing about anything ! "
8645	8656	8657	8657	she	50	" Eh ! you must n't cry like that there ! "
8660	8701	8657	8657	she	50	" You must n't for sure . I did n't know you 'd be vexed . I do n't know anythin ' about anythin ' just like you said . I beg your pardon , Miss. Do stop cryin ' . "

9430	9528	9427	9427	she	38	" There 's twelve of us an ' my father only gets sixteen shilling a week . I can tell you my mother 's put to it to get porridge for 'em all . They tumble about on th ' moor an ' play there all day an ' mother says th ' air of th ' moor fattens 'em . She says she believes they eat th ' grass same as th ' wild ponies do . Our Dickon , he 's twelve years old and he 's got a young pony he calls his own . "

And it got to like him so it follows him about an ' it lets him get on its back . Dickon 's a kind lad an ' animals likes him . "

10256	10350	10253	10253	she	45	" You 'll have to learn to play like other children does when they have n't got sisters and brothers . Our Dickon goes off on th ' moor by himself an ' plays for hours . That 's how he made friends with th ' pony . He 's got sheep on th ' moor that knows him , an ' birds as comes an ' eats out of his hand . However little there is to eat , he always saves a bit o ' his bread to coax his pets . "

He come out of th ' nest in th ' other garden an ' when first he flew over th ' wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an ' we got friendly . When he went over th ' wall again th ' rest of th ' brood was gone an ' he was lonely an ' he come back to me . "

They 're almost as friendly as dogs if you know how to get on with 'em . Watch him peckin ' about there an ' lookin ' round at us now an ' again . He knows we 're talkin ' about him . "
12502	12509	12510	12510	he	494	" He 's a conceited one , "
12513	12580	12510	12510	he	494	" He likes to hear folk talk about him . An ' curious bless me , there never was his like for curiosity an ' meddlin ' . He 's always comin ' to see what I 'm plantin ' . He knows all th ' things Mester Craven never troubles hissel ' to find out . He 's th ' head gardener , he is . "

12650	12697	12647	12647	she	38	" There 's no knowin ' . The old ones turn 'em out o ' their nest an ' make 'em fly an ' they 're scattered before you know it . This one was a knowin ' one an ' he knew he was lonely . "

16510	16524	16525	16525	she	38	" What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this ? "
16529	16541	16542	16542	Martha	50	" Try to keep from under each other 's feet mostly , "
16545	16738	16542	16542	Martha	50	" Eh ! there does seem a lot of us then . Mother 's a good - tempered woman but she gets fair moithered . The biggest ones goes out in th ' cow - shed and plays there . Dickon he does n't mind th ' wet . He goes out just th ' same as if th ' sun was shinin ' . He says he sees things on rainy days as does n't show when it 's fair weather . He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th ' bosom of his shirt to keep it warm . Its mother had been killed nearby an ' th ' hole was swum out an ' th ' rest o ' th ' litter was dead . He 's got it at home now . He found a half - drowned young crow another time an ' he brought it home , too , an ' tamed it . It 's named Soot because it 's so black , an ' it hops an ' flies about with him everywhere . "

16866	16882	16884	16884	Mary	38	" If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it , "
16886	16892	16884	16884	Mary	38	" But I have nothing . "
16897	16903	16904	16904	she	50	" Can tha ' knit ? "
16907	16910	16912	16912	Mary	38	" No , "
16914	16920	16893	16893	Martha	50	" Can tha ' sew ? "
16921	16924	16893	16893	Martha	50	" No . "
16925	16931	16893	16893	Martha	50	" Can tha ' read ? "
16932	16935	16893	16893	Martha	50	" Yes . "
16936	16969	16893	16893	Martha	50	" Then why does n't tha , read somethin' , or learn a bit o ' spellin ' ? Tha'st old enough to be learnin ' thy book a good bit now . "
16970	16977	16979	16979	Mary	38	" I have n't any books , "
16981	16990	16979	16979	Mary	38	" Those I had were left in India . "
16991	16997	16999	16999	Martha	50	" That 's a pity , "
17001	17021	16999	16999	Martha	50	" If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th ' library , there 's thousands o ' books there . "
17302	17311	17312	17312	she	38	" Has n't tha ' got good sense ? "
17331	17362	17312	17312	she	38	" Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an ' she 's only four year ' old . Sometimes tha ' looks fair soft in th ' head . "
17836	17843	17845	17845	Mary	38	" Where do you live now ? "
17850	17857	17845	17845	Mary	38	" I wish you were here . "
18102	18109	18111	18111	Mary	38	" Perhaps she slept here once , "
18113	18126	18111	18111	Mary	38	" She stares at me so that she makes me feel queer . "
18494	18510	18512	18512	Mary	38	" If they would n't be so frightened I would take them back with me , "
18591	18602	18603	18603	she	38	" I believe I have taken a wrong turning again , "
18623	18638	18603	18603	she	38	" I do n't know which way to go . How still everything is ! "
18696	18704	18706	18706	Mary	38	" It 's nearer than it was , "
18714	18720	18706	18706	Mary	38	" And it is crying . "
18790	18797	18798	18798	she	45	" What are you doing here ? "
18813	18820	18802	18802	she	45	" What did I tell you ? "
18821	18829	18831	18831	Mary	38	" I turned round the wrong corner , "
18833	18849	18831	18831	Mary	38	" I did n't know which way to go and I heard some one crying . "
18867	18877	18879	18880	the housekeeper	632	" You did n't hear anything of the sort , "
18882	18898	18879	18880	the housekeeper	632	" You come along back to your own nursery or I 'll box your ears . "
18932	18935	18936	18936	she	632	" Now , "
18939	18992	18936	18936	she	632	" you stay where you 're told to stay or you 'll find yourself locked up . The master had better get you a governess , same as he said he would . You 're one that needs some one to look sharp after you . I 've got enough to do . "
19031	19042	19043	19043	she	38	" There was some one crying there was there was ! "
19153	19164	19141	19141	she	38	" Look at the moor ! Look at the moor ! "
19289	19292	19294	19294	Martha	50	" Aye , "
19300	19372	19294	19294	Martha	50	" Th ' storm 's over for a bit . It does like this at this time o ' th ' year . It goes off in a night like it was pretendin ' it had never been here an ' never meant to come again . That 's because th ' springtime 's on its way . It 's a long way off yet , but it 's comin ' . "
19373	19386	19387	19387	Mary	38	" I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England , "
19390	19395	19397	19397	Martha	50	" Eh ! no ! "
19410	19418	19397	19397	Martha	50	" Nowt o ' th ' soart ! "
19419	19425	19427	19427	Mary	38	" What does that mean ? "
19468	19472	19473	19473	she	38	" There now , "
19476	19508	19461	19461	she	50	" I 've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I must n't . ' Nowt o ' th ' soart ' means ' nothin'-of - the - sort , ' "
19513	19630	19461	19461	she	50	" but it takes so long to say it . Yorkshire 's th ' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny . I told thee tha'd like th ' moor after a bit . Just you wait till you see th ' gold - colored gorse blossoms an ' th ' blossoms o ' th ' broom , an ' th ' heather flowerin ' , all purple bells , an ' hundreds o ' butterflies flutterin ' an ' bees hummin ' an ' skylarks soarin ' up an ' singin ' . You 'll want to get out on it as sunrise an ' live out on it all day like Dickon does . "
19631	19638	19640	19640	Mary	38	" Could I ever get there ? "
19668	19674	19676	19676	Martha	50	" I do n't know , "
19678	19713	19676	19676	Martha	50	" Tha 's never used tha ' legs since tha ' was born , it seems to me . Tha ' could n't walk five mile . It 's five mile to our cottage . "
19714	19723	19724	19724	Martha	50	" I should like to see your cottage . "
19791	19800	19801	19801	she	50	" I 'll ask my mother about it , "
19804	19856	19801	19801	she	50	" She 's one o ' them that nearly always sees a way to do things . It 's my day out today an ' I 'm goin' home . Eh ! I am glad . Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o ' mother . Perhaps she could talk to her . "
19857	19863	19865	19865	Mary	38	" I like your mother , "
19867	19875	19877	19877	Martha	50	" I should think tha ' did , "
19882	19889	19891	19891	Mary	38	" I 've never seen her , "
19893	19901	19903	19903	Martha	50	" No , tha ' has n't , "
19938	19996	19905	19905	She	50	" Well , she 's that sensible an ' hard workin ' an ' goodnatured an ' clean that no one could help likin ' her whether they 'd seen her or not . When I 'm goin' home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I 'm crossin ' the moor . "
19997	20002	20004	20004	Mary	38	" I like Dickon , "
20006	20014	20004	20004	Mary	38	" And I 've never seen him . "
20015	20018	20020	20020	Martha	50	" Well , "
20023	20058	20020	20020	Martha	50	" I 've told thee that th ' very birds likes him an ' th ' rabbits an ' wild sheep an ' ponies , an ' th ' foxes themselves . I wonder , "
20064	20072	20020	20020	Martha	50	" what Dickon would think of thee ? "
20073	20080	20082	20082	Mary	38	" He would n't like me , "
20091	20096	20082	20082	Mary	38	" No one does . "
20102	20111	20112	20112	she	50	" How does tha ' like thysel ' ? "
20134	20140	20141	20141	she	38	" Not at all really , "
20144	20153	20141	20141	she	38	" But I never thought of that before . "
20165	20173	20174	20174	she	50	" Mother said that to me once , "
20177	20269	20174	20174	she	50	" She was at her wash - tub an ' I was in a bad temper an ' talkin ' ill of folk , an ' she turns round on me an ' says : ' Tha ' young vixen , tha ' ! There tha ' stands sayin ' tha ' does n't like this one an ' tha ' does n't like that one . How does tha ' like thysel ' ? ' It made me laugh an ' it brought me to my senses in a minute . "
20486	20492	20493	20493	he	57	" Springtime 's comin , ' "
20496	20504	20493	20493	he	57	" Can not tha ' smell it ? "
20512	20522	20523	20523	she	38	" I smell something nice and fresh and damp , "
20526	20535	20536	20536	he	57	" That 's th ' good rich earth , "
20542	20628	20536	20536	he	57	" It 's in a good humor makin ' ready to grow things . It 's glad when plantin ' time comes . It 's dull in th ' winter when it 's got nowt to do . In th ' flower gardens out there things will be stirrin ' down below in th ' dark . Th ' sun 's warmin ' 'em . You 'll see bits o ' green spikes stickin ' out o ' th ' black earth after a bit . "
20629	20635	20637	20637	Mary	38	" What will they be ? "
20639	20655	20536	20536	he	57	" Crocuses an ' snowdrops an ' daffydowndillys . Has tha ' never seen them ? "
20656	20674	20676	20676	Mary	38	" No . Everything is hot , and wet , and green after the rains in India , "
20678	20689	20676	20676	Mary	38	" And I think things grow up in a night . "
20690	20700	20702	20702	Weatherstaff	57	" These wo n't grow up in a night , "
20704	20746	20702	20702	Weatherstaff	57	" Tha'll have to wait for 'em . They 'll poke up a bit higher here , an ' push out a spike more there , an ' uncurl a leaf this day an ' another that . You watch 'em . "
20747	20753	20755	20755	Mary	38	" I am going to , "
20817	20825	20826	20826	she	38	" Do you think he remembers me ? "
20829	20833	20835	20835	Weatherstaff	57	" Remembers thee ! "
20838	20890	20835	20835	Weatherstaff	57	" He knows every cabbage stump in th ' gardens , let alone th ' people . He 's never seen a little wench here before , an ' he 's bent on findin ' out all about thee . Tha 's no need to try to hide anything from him . "
20891	20907	20908	20908	Mary	38	" Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives ? "
20911	20915	20917	20917	Weatherstaff	57	" What garden ? "
20923	20934	20935	20935	She	38	" The one where the old rose - trees are . "
20949	20973	20942	20942	she	38	" Are all the flowers dead , or do some of them come again in the summer ? Are there ever any roses ? "
20974	20978	20980	20981	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Ask him , "
20990	21011	20984	20984	his	57	" He 's the only one as knows . No one else has seen inside it for ten year ' . "
21216	21222	21223	21223	she	38	" You do remember me ! "
21227	21241	21223	21223	she	38	" You do ! You are prettier than anything else in the world ! "
21635	21645	21646	21646	she	38	" Perhaps it has been buried for ten years , "
21652	21662	21646	21646	she	38	" Perhaps it is the key to the garden ! "
22014	22017	22011	22011	she	64	" contrary , "
22233	22241	22242	22242	she	50	" I got up at four o'clock , "
22245	22303	22242	22242	she	50	" Eh ! it was pretty on th ' moor with th ' birds gettin ' up an ' th ' rabbits scamperin ' about an ' th ' sun risin ' . I did n't walk all th ' way . A man gave me a ride in his cart an ' I did enjoy myself . "
22358	22422	22339	22339	She	124	" I had 'em all pipin ' hot when they came in from playin ' on th ' moor . An ' th ' cottage all smelt o ' nice , clean hot bakin ' an ' there was a good fire , an ' they just shouted for joy . Our Dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king . "
22475	22477	22473	22473	Martha	50	" blacks "
22491	22502	22504	22504	Martha	50	" Eh ! they did like to hear about you , "
22506	22533	22504	22504	Martha	50	" They wanted to know all about th ' blacks an ' about th ' ship you came in . I could n't tell 'em enough . "
22539	22554	22555	22555	she	38	" I 'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out , "
22593	22593	22586	22591	the officers going to hunt tigers	695	"
22594	22598	22601	22601	Martha	50	" My word ! "
22603	22640	22601	22601	Martha	50	" It would set 'em clean off their heads . Would tha ' really do that , Miss ? It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once . "
22641	22649	22650	22650	Mary	38	" India is quite different from Yorkshire , "
22661	22681	22650	22650	Mary	38	" I never thought of that . Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me ? "
22682	22702	22704	22704	Martha	50	" Why , our Dickon 's eyes nearly started out o ' his head , they got that round , "
22706	22783	22704	22704	Martha	50	" But mother , she was put out about your seemin ' to be all by yourself like . She said , ' Has n't Mr. Craven got no governess for her , nor no nurse ? ' and I said , ' No , he has n't , though Mrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it , but she says he may n't think of it for two or three years . ' "
22784	22792	22794	22794	Mary	38	" I do n't want a governess , "
22797	22882	22704	22704	Martha	50	" But mother says you ought to be learnin ' your book by this time an ' you ought to have a woman to look after you , an ' she says : ' Now , Martha , you just think how you 'd feel yourself , in a big place like that , wanderin ' about all alone , an ' no mother . You do your best to cheer her up , ' she says , an ' I said I would . "
22892	22899	22900	22900	she	38	" You do cheer me up , "
22903	22911	22900	22900	she	38	" I like to hear you talk . "
22932	22939	22940	22940	she	38	" What does tha ' think , "
22948	22956	22940	22940	she	38	" I 've brought thee a present . "
22957	22961	22963	22964	Mistress Mary	38	" A present ! "
22981	22993	22994	22994	Martha	50	" A man was drivin ' across the moor peddlin ' , "
22997	23162	22994	22994	Martha	50	" An ' he stopped his cart at our door . He had pots an ' pans an ' odds an ' ends , but mother had no money to buy anythin ' . Just as he was goin' away our ' Lizabeth Ellen called out , ' Mother , he 's got skippin'-ropes with red an ' blue handles . ' An ' mother she calls out quite sudden , ' Here , stop , mister ! How much are they ? ' An ' he says ' Tuppence ' , an ' mother she began fumblin ' in her pocket an ' she says to me , ' Martha , tha 's brought me thy wages like a good lass , an ' I 've got four places to put every penny , but I 'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin'-rope , ' an ' she bought one an ' here it is . "
23216	23222	23223	23223	she	700	" What is it for ? "
23227	23230	23233	23233	Martha	50	" For ! "
23235	23279	23233	23233	Martha	50	" Does tha ' mean that they 've not got skippin'-ropes in India , for all they 've got elephants and tigers and camels ! No wonder most of 'em 's black . This is what it 's for ; just watch me . "
23392	23400	23401	23401	she	38	" I could skip longer than that , "
23407	23440	23401	23401	she	38	" I 've skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve , but I was n't as fat then as I am now , an ' I was in practice . "
23453	23458	23459	23459	she	38	" It looks nice , "
23462	23480	23459	23459	she	38	" Your mother is a kind woman . Do you think I could ever skip like that ? "
23481	23487	23489	23489	Martha	50	" You just try it , "
23498	23580	23489	23489	Martha	50	" You ca n't skip a hundred at first , but if you practice you 'll mount up . That 's what mother said . She says , ' Nothin' will do her more good than skippin ' rope . It 's th ' sensiblest toy a child can have . Let her play out in th ' fresh air skippin ' an ' it 'll stretch her legs an ' arms an ' give her some strength in 'em . ' "
23629	23645	23647	23647	Martha	50	" Put on tha ' things and run an ' skip out o ' doors , "
23649	23683	23647	23647	Martha	50	" Mother said I must tell you to keep out o ' doors as much as you could , even when it rains a bit , so as tha ' wrap up warm . "
23721	23724	23725	23725	she	38	" Martha , "
23728	23745	23746	23746	She	38	" they were your wages . It was your two - pence really . Thank you . "
23767	23771	23772	23772	she	38	" Thank you , "
23816	23830	23831	23831	she	50	" Eh ! th ' art a queer , old - womanish thing , "
23834	23849	23813	23813	she	50	" If tha'd been our ' Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have given me a kiss . "
23856	23865	23813	23813	she	50	" Do you want me to kiss you ? "
23870	23876	23877	23877	she	50	" Nay , not me , "
23880	23910	23877	23877	she	50	" If tha ' was different , p'raps tha'd want to thysel ' . But tha ' is n't . Run off outside an ' play with thy rope . "
24110	24113	24114	24114	he	57	" Well ! "
24117	24178	24114	24114	he	57	" Upon my word . P'raps tha ' art a young ' un , after all , an ' p'raps tha 's got child 's blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk . Tha 's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name 's Ben Weatherstaff . I would n't have believed tha ' could do it . "
24179	24185	24186	24186	Mary	38	" I never skipped before , "
24189	24203	24186	24186	Mary	38	" I 'm just beginning . I can only go up to twenty . "
24204	24210	24212	24212	Ben	57	" Tha ' keep on , "
24214	24242	24244	24244	his	57	" Tha ' shapes well enough at it for a young ' un that 's lived with heathen . Just see how he 's watchin ' thee , "
24250	24286	24288	24288	his	57	" He followed after thee yesterday . He 'll be at it again today . He 'll be bound to find out what th ' skippin'-rope is . He 's never seen one . Eh ! "
24294	24314	24288	24288	his	57	" tha ' curiosity will be th ' death of thee sometime if tha ' does n't look sharp . "
24476	24486	24487	24487	she	38	" You showed me where the key was yesterday , "
24490	24508	24487	24487	she	38	" You ought to show me the door today ; but I do n't believe you know ! "
25302	25308	25309	25309	she	38	" How still it is ! "
25312	25316	25309	25309	she	38	" How still ! "
25363	25370	25371	25371	she	38	" No wonder it is still , "
25375	25390	25371	25371	she	38	" I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years . "
25455	25465	25466	25466	she	38	" I wonder if they are all quite dead , "
25469	25484	25466	25466	she	38	" Is it all a quite dead garden ? I wish it was n't . "
25879	25897	25898	25898	she	38	" Yes , they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils , "
25923	25936	25937	25937	she	38	" Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places , "
25940	25951	25937	25937	she	38	" I will go all over the garden and look . "
26016	26025	26026	26026	she	38	" It is n't a quite dead garden , "
26033	26047	26026	26026	she	38	" Even if the roses are dead , there are other things alive . "
26124	26134	26135	26135	she	38	" Now they look as if they could breathe , "
26147	26177	26135	26135	she	38	" I am going to do ever so many more . I 'll do all I can see . If I have n't time today I can come tomorrow . "
26435	26443	26444	26444	she	38	" I shall come back this afternoon , "
26512	26528	26529	26529	she	38	" Two pieces o ' meat an ' two helps o ' rice puddin ' ! "
26532	26552	26529	26529	she	38	" Eh ! mother will be pleased when I tell her what th ' skippin'-rope 's done for thee . "
26610	26613	26614	26614	she	38	" Martha , "
26617	26628	26614	26614	she	38	" what are those white roots that look like onions ? "
26629	26634	26636	26636	Martha	50	" They 're bulbs , "
26638	26706	26636	26636	Martha	50	" Lots o ' spring flowers grow from 'em . Th ' very little ones are snowdrops an ' crocuses an ' th ' big ones are narcissuses an ' jonquils and daffydowndillys . Th ' biggest of all is lilies an ' purple flags . Eh ! they are nice . Dickon 's got a whole lot of 'em planted in our bit o ' garden . "
26707	26715	26717	26717	Mary	38	" Does Dickon know all about them ? "
26727	26754	26636	26636	Martha	50	" Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk . Mother says he just whispers things out o ' th ' ground . "
26755	26775	26777	26777	Mary	38	" Do bulbs live a long time ? Would they live years and years if no one helped them ? "
26780	26788	26790	26790	Martha	50	" They 're things as helps themselves , "
26792	26871	26790	26790	Martha	50	" That 's why poor folk can afford to have 'em . If you do n't trouble 'em , most of ' em'll work away underground for a lifetime an ' spread out an ' have little ' uns . There 's a place in th ' park woods here where there 's snowdrops by thousands . They 're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th ' spring comes . No one knows when they was first planted . "
26872	26881	26883	26883	Mary	38	" I wish the spring was here now , "
26885	26898	26883	26883	Mary	38	" I want to see all the things that grow in England . "
26916	26927	26928	26928	she	38	" I wish I wish I had a little spade , "
26931	26941	26943	26943	Martha	50	" Whatever does tha ' want a spade for ? "
26947	26966	26943	26943	Martha	50	" Art tha ' goin' to take to diggin ' ? I must tell mother that , too . "
27030	27039	27040	27040	she	38	" This is such a big lonely place , "
27055	27175	27040	27040	she	38	" The house is lonely , and the park is lonely , and the gardens are lonely . So many places seem shut up . I never did many things in India , but there were more people to look at natives and soldiers marching by and sometimes bands playing , and my Ayah told me stories . There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff . And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff wo n't speak to me often . I thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he does , and I might make a little garden if he would give me some seeds . "
27183	27187	27188	27188	she	50	" There now ! "
27191	27270	27188	27188	she	50	" if that was n't one of th ' things mother said . She says , ' There 's such a lot o ' room in that big place , why do n't they give her a bit for herself , even if she does n't plant nothin' but parsley an ' radishes ? She 'd dig an ' rake away an ' be right down happy over it . ' Them was the very words she said . "
27271	27275	27277	27277	Mary	38	" Were they ? "
27279	27290	27277	27277	Mary	38	" How many things she knows , does n't she ? "
27291	27294	27296	27296	Martha	50	" Eh ! "
27298	27336	27296	27296	Martha	50	" It 's like she says : ' A woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B C. Children 's as good as ' rithmetic to set you findin ' out things . ' "
27337	27348	27349	27349	Mary	38	" How much would a spade cost a little one ? "
27352	27355	27357	27357	Martha	50	" Well , "
27362	27409	27357	27357	Martha	50	" at Thwaite village there 's a shop or so an ' I saw little garden sets with a spade an ' a rake an ' a fork all tied together for two shillings . An ' they was stout enough to work with , too . "
27410	27421	27423	27423	Mary	38	" I 've got more than that in my purse , "
27425	27443	27423	27423	Mary	38	" Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven . "
27444	27452	27454	27454	Martha	50	" Did he remember thee that much ? "
27456	27488	27423	27423	Mary	38	" Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend . She gives me one every Saturday . I did n't know what to spend it on . "
27489	27497	27499	27499	Martha	50	" My word ! that 's riches , "
27501	27549	27499	27499	Martha	50	" Tha ' can buy anything in th ' world tha ' wants . Th ' rent of our cottage is only one an ' threepence an ' it 's like pullin ' eye - teeth to get it . Now I 've just thought of somethin' , "
27557	27560	27562	27562	Mary	38	" What ? "
27565	27628	27562	27562	Mary	38	" In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o ' flower - seeds for a penny each , and our Dickon he knows which is th ' prettiest ones an ' how to make 'em grow . He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th ' fun of it . Does tha ' know how to print letters ? "
27631	27638	27639	27639	Mary	38	" I know how to write , "
27647	27692	27642	27642	Martha	50	" Our Dickon can only read printin ' . If tha ' could print we could write a letter to him an ' ask him to go an ' buy th ' garden tools an ' th ' seeds at th ' same time . "
27693	27702	27703	27703	Mary	38	" Oh ! you 're a good girl ! "
27706	27745	27703	27703	Mary	38	" You are , really ! I did n't know you were so nice . I know I can print letters if I try . Let 's ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper . "
27746	27755	27757	27757	Martha	50	" I 've got some of my own , "
27759	27785	27757	27757	Martha	50	" I bought 'em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday . I 'll go and get it . "
27810	27817	27818	27818	she	38	" If I have a spade , "
27821	27857	27818	27818	she	38	" I can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds . If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden wo n't be dead at all it will come alive . "
27984	27988	27979	27979	Martha	50	" My Dear Dickon :
28100	28109	28068	28069	Miss Mary	38	" Your loving sister , Martha Phoebe Sowerby . "
28110	28146	28148	28148	Martha	50	" We 'll put the money in th ' envelope an ' I 'll get th ' butcher boy to take it in his cart . He 's a great friend o ' Dickon 's , "
28150	28162	28068	28069	Miss Mary	38	" How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them ? "
28163	28181	28068	28069	Miss Mary	38	" He 'll bring 'em to you himself . He 'll like to walk over this way . "
28182	28185	28187	28187	Mary	38	" Oh ! "
28189	28204	28187	28187	Mary	38	" then I shall see him ! I never thought I should see Dickon . "
28205	28214	28216	28216	Martha	50	" Does tha ' want to see him ? "
28226	28250	28068	28069	Miss Mary	38	" Yes , I do . I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved . I want to see him very much . "
28263	28268	28269	28269	she	38	" Now to think , "
28273	28315	28269	28269	she	38	" to think o ' me forgettin ' that there ; an ' I thought I was goin' to tell you first thing this mornin ' . I asked mother and she said she 'd ask Mrs. Medlock her own self . "
28316	28320	28321	28321	Mary	38	" Do you mean "
28324	28367	28269	28269	she	38	" What I said Tuesday . Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o ' mother 's hot oat cake , an ' butter , an ' a glass o ' milk . "
28411	28422	28423	28423	she	38	" Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go ? "
28429	28453	28423	28423	she	38	" Aye , she thinks she would . She knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage . "
28454	28468	28470	28470	Mary	38	" If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon , "
28482	28495	28470	28470	Mary	38	" She does n't seem to be like the mothers in India . "
28553	28556	28557	28557	she	38	" Martha , "
28560	28572	28557	28557	she	38	" has the scullery - maid had the toothache again today ? "
28578	28585	28586	28586	she	38	" What makes thee ask that ? "
28589	28654	28573	28573	Martha	50	" Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming . And I heard that far - off crying again , just as we heard it the other night . There is n't a wind today , so you see it could n't have been the wind . "
28655	28658	28660	28660	Martha	50	" Eh ! "
28663	28696	28660	28660	Martha	50	" Tha ' must n't go walkin ' about in corridors an ' listenin ' . Mr. Craven would be that there angry there 's no knowin ' what he 'd do . "
28697	28703	28705	28705	Mary	38	" I was n't listening , "
28707	28724	28705	28705	Mary	38	" I was just waiting for you and I heard it . That 's three times . "
28725	28736	28738	28738	Martha	50	" My word ! There 's Mrs. Medlock 's bell , "
28749	28761	28763	28763	Mary	38	" It 's the strangest house any one ever lived in , "
29207	29453	29196	29196	Martha	50	" and about bulbs spreading and making new ones . These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread , like the snowdrops , into thousands . She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers . Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom . During that week of sunshine , she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff . She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth . The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming , so she always walked toward him as silently as possible . But , in fact , he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first . Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company . Then , also , she was more civil than she had been . He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native , and had not known that a cross , sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters , and be merely commanded by them to do things .
29454	29461	29462	29462	he	771	" Tha'rt like th ' robin , "
29480	29496	29462	29462	he	771	" I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from . "
29497	29505	29507	29507	Mary	38	" He 's friends with me now , "
29509	29515	29517	29518	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" That 's like him , "
29520	29577	29517	29518	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Makin ' up to th ' women folk just for vanity an ' flightiness . There 's nothin' he would n't do for th ' sake o ' showin ' off an ' flirtin ' his tail - feathers . He 's as full o ' pride as an egg 's full o ' meat . "
29626	29635	29636	29636	he	771	" How long has tha ' been here ? "
29640	29649	29650	29650	she	38	" I think it 's about a month , "
29653	29663	29664	29664	he	771	" Tha 's beginnin ' to do Misselthwaite credit , "
29667	29721	29664	29664	he	771	" Tha 's a bit fatter than tha ' was an ' tha 's not quite so yeller . Tha ' looked like a young plucked crow when tha ' first came into this garden . Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier , sourer faced young ' un . "
29742	29749	29750	29750	she	38	" I know I 'm fatter , "
29753	29774	29750	29750	she	38	" My stockings are getting tighter . They used to make wrinkles . There 's the robin , Ben Weatherstaff . "
29836	29844	29845	29845	he	57	" Aye , there tha ' art ! "
29848	29932	29845	29845	he	57	" Tha ' can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha 's got no one better . Tha 's been reddenin ' up thy waistcoat an ' polishin ' thy feathers this two weeks . I know what tha 's up to . Tha 's courtin ' some bold young madam somewhere tellin ' thy lies to her about bein ' th ' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an ' ready to fight all th ' rest of 'em . "
29933	29940	29942	29942	Mary	38	" Oh ! look at him ! "
29991	30003	30005	30005	Ben	57	" Tha ' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that , "
30027	30045	30019	30019	he	57	" Tha ' thinks no one can stand out against thee that 's what tha ' thinks . "
30127	30134	30135	30135	he	481	" Well , I 'm danged ! "
30148	30174	30135	30135	he	481	" Tha ' does know how to get at a chap tha ' does ! Tha 's fair unearthly , tha 's so knowin ' . "
30253	30262	30263	30263	she	38	" Have you a garden of your own ? "
30266	30282	30219	30219	he	481	" No . I 'm bachelder an ' lodge with Martin at th ' gate . "
30283	30289	30291	30291	Mary	38	" If you had one , "
30293	30299	30291	30291	Mary	38	" what would you plant ? "
30300	30310	30219	30219	he	481	" Cabbages an ' ' taters an ' onions . "
30311	30322	30324	30324	Mary	38	" But if you wanted to make a flower garden , "
30326	30332	30324	30324	Mary	38	" what would you plant ? "
30333	30346	30219	30219	he	481	" Bulbs an ' sweet - smellin ' things but mostly roses . "
30353	30359	30360	30360	she	38	" Do you like roses ? "
30377	30433	30434	30434	He	57	" Well , yes , I do . I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to . She had a lot in a place she was fond of , an ' she loved 'em like they was children or robins . I 've seen her bend over an ' kiss 'em . "
30444	30455	30434	30434	He	57	" That were as much as ten year ' ago . "
30456	30462	30464	30464	Mary	38	" Where is she now ? "
30469	30472	30473	30473	he	57	" Heaven , "
30485	30493	30478	30478	his	57	" ' cording to what parson says . "
30494	30501	30502	30502	Mary	38	" What happened to the roses ? "
30511	30518	30478	30478	his	57	" They was left to themselves . "
30525	30542	30543	30543	she	38	" Did they quite die ? Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves ? "
30546	30566	30567	30568	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Well , I 'd got to like 'em an ' I liked her an ' she liked 'em , "
30572	30615	30567	30568	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Once or twice a year I 'd go an ' work at 'em a bit prune 'em an ' dig about th ' roots . They run wild , but they was in rich soil , so some of 'em lived . "
30616	30641	30643	30643	Mary	38	" When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry , how can you tell whether they are dead or alive ? "
30645	30680	30567	30568	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Wait till th ' spring gets at 'em wait till th ' sun shines on th ' rain and th ' rain falls on th ' sunshine an ' then tha'll find out . "
30681	30685	30687	30687	Mary	38	" How how ? "
30694	30734	30735	30735	He	57	" Look along th ' twigs an ' branches an ' if tha ' see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an ' there , watch it after th ' warm rain an ' see what happens . "
30746	30765	30766	30766	he	57	" Why does tha ' care so much about roses an ' such , all of a sudden ? "
30784	30800	30801	30801	she	38	" I I want to play that that I have a garden of my own , "
30804	30821	30801	30801	she	38	" I there is nothing for me to do . I have nothing and no one . "
30822	30825	30827	30828	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Well , "
30836	30846	30832	30832	he	57	" that 's true . Tha ' has n't . "
30997	31008	31009	31009	she	38	" Do you go and see those other roses now ? "
31012	31030	31035	31035	his	57	" Not been this year . My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th ' joints . "
31060	31065	31066	31066	he	57	" Now look here ! "
31070	31112	31066	31066	he	57	" Do n't tha ' ask so many questions . Tha'rt th ' worst wench for askin ' questions I 've ever come a cross . Get thee gone an ' play thee . I 've done talkin ' for today . "
31489	31496	31497	31497	he	155	" Do n't tha ' move , "
31500	31506	31497	31497	he	155	" It 'd flight 'em . "
31590	31595	31596	31597	the boy	792	" I 'm Dickon , "
31600	31607	31596	31597	the boy	792	" I know tha'rt Miss Mary . "
31658	31664	31665	31665	he	155	" I got up slow , "
31668	31698	31665	31665	he	155	" because if tha ' makes a quick move it startles 'em . A body ' as to move gentle an ' speak low when wild things is about . "
31742	31750	31751	31751	she	38	" Did you get Martha 's letter ? "
31764	31771	31756	31756	his	155	" That 's why I come . "
31791	31863	31772	31772	He	155	" I 've got th ' garden tools . There 's a little spade an ' rake an ' a fork an ' hoe . Eh ! they are good ' uns . There 's a trowel , too . An ' th ' woman in th ' shop threw in a packet o ' white poppy an ' one o ' blue larkspur when I bought th ' other seeds . "
31864	31873	31874	31874	Mary	38	" Will you show the seeds to me ? "
32001	32014	32015	32015	she	38	" Let us sit down on this log and look at them , "
32061	32073	32074	32074	he	155	" There 's a lot o ' mignonette an ' poppies , "
32077	32126	32074	32074	he	155	" Mignonette 's th ' sweetest smellin ' thing as grows , an ' it 'll grow wherever you cast it , same as poppies will . Them as'll come up an ' bloom if you just whistle to 'em , them 's th ' nicest of all . "
32143	32154	32155	32155	he	155	" Where 's that robin as is callin ' us ? "
32181	32188	32189	32189	she	38	" Is it really calling us ? "
32192	32195	32197	32197	Dickon	54	" Aye , "
32211	32258	32197	32197	Dickon	54	" he 's callin ' some one he 's friends with . That 's same as sayin ' ' Here I am . Look at me . I wants a bit of a chat . ' There he is in the bush . Whose is he ? "
32259	32275	32277	32277	Mary	38	" He 's Ben Weatherstaff 's , but I think he knows me a little , "
32279	32286	32288	32288	Dickon	54	" Aye , he knows thee , "
32295	32319	32290	32290	his	54	" An ' he likes thee . He 's took thee on . He 'll tell me all about thee in a minute . "
32372	32383	32385	32385	Dickon	54	" Aye , he 's a friend o ' yours , "
32387	32394	32396	32396	Mary	38	" Do you think he is ? "
32406	32415	32399	32399	She	38	" Do you think he really likes me ? "
32416	32428	32430	32430	Dickon	54	" He would n't come near thee if he did n't , "
32432	32475	32430	32430	Dickon	54	" Birds is rare choosers an ' a robin can flout a body worse than a man . See , he 's making up to thee now . ' Can not tha ' see a chap ? ' he 's sayin ' . "
32501	32509	32511	32511	Mary	38	" Do you understand everything birds say ? "
32535	32547	32548	32548	he	54	" I think I do , and they think I do , "
32551	32631	32548	32548	he	54	" I 've lived on th ' moor with 'em so long . I 've watched 'em break shell an ' come out an ' fledge an ' learn to fly an ' begin to sing , till I think I 'm one of 'em . Sometimes I think p'raps I 'm a bird , or a fox , or a rabbit , or a squirrel , or even a beetle , an ' I do n't know it . "
32680	32684	32685	32685	he	54	" See here , "
32696	32711	32685	32685	he	54	" I 'll plant them for thee myself . Where is tha ' garden ? "
32766	32781	32782	32782	Dickon	54	" Tha 's got a bit o ' garden , has n't tha ' ? "
32816	32825	32826	32826	he	54	" Would n't they give thee a bit ? "
32829	32838	32826	32826	he	54	" Has n't tha ' got any yet ? "
32851	32860	32861	32861	she	38	" I do n't know anything about boys , "
32865	32905	32861	32861	she	38	" Could you keep a secret , if I told you one ? It 's a great secret . I do n't know what I should do if any one found it out . I believe I should die ! "
32939	32950	32951	32951	he	54	" I 'm keepin ' secrets all th ' time , "
32954	33003	32951	32951	he	54	" If I could n't keep secrets from th ' other lads , secrets about foxes ' cubs , an ' birds ' nests , an ' wild things ' holes , there 'd be naught safe on th ' moor . Aye , I can keep secrets . "
33023	33030	33031	33031	she	38	" I 've stolen a garden , "
33036	33076	33031	33031	she	38	" It is n't mine . It is n't anybody 's . Nobody wants it , nobody cares for it , nobody ever goes into it . Perhaps everything is dead in it already . I do n't know . "
33094	33136	33137	33137	she	38	" I do n't care , I do n't care ! Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they do n't . They 're letting it die , all shut in by itself , "
33169	33176	33177	33177	he	54	" Eh - h - h ! "
33198	33205	33207	33207	Mary	38	" I 've nothing to do , "
33209	33244	33207	33207	Mary	38	" Nothing belongs to me . I found it myself and I got into it myself . I was only just like the robin , and they would n't take it from the robin . "
33245	33250	33252	33252	Dickon	54	" Where is it ? "
33301	33311	33312	33312	she	38	" Come with me and I 'll show you , "
33410	33415	33416	33416	she	38	" It 's this , "
33419	33442	33416	33416	she	38	" It 's a secret garden , and I 'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive . "
33457	33460	33461	33461	he	54	" Eh ! "
33465	33486	33461	33461	he	54	" it is a queer , pretty place ! It 's like as if a body was in a dream . "
33588	33598	33599	33599	he	54	" I never thought I 'd see this place , "
33608	33615	33617	33617	Mary	38	" Did you know about it ? "
33631	33637	33638	33638	he	54	" We must talk low , "
33641	33657	33638	33638	he	54	" or some one'll hear us an ' wonder what 's to do in here . "
33658	33664	33666	33666	Mary	38	" Oh ! I forgot ! "
33679	33687	33688	33688	she	38	" Did you know about the garden ? "
33700	33714	33715	33715	he	54	" Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside , "
33718	33728	33715	33715	he	54	" Us used to wonder what it was like . "
33750	33761	33762	33762	he	54	" Eh ! the nests as'll be here come springtime , "
33765	33812	33762	33762	he	54	" It 'd be th ' safest nestin ' place in England . No one never comin ' near an ' tangles o ' trees an ' roses to build in . I wonder all th ' birds on th ' moor do n't build here . "
33826	33832	33833	33833	she	38	" Will there be roses ? "
33836	33849	33833	33833	she	38	" Can you tell ? I thought perhaps they were all dead . "
33850	33862	33863	33863	he	54	" Eh ! No ! Not them not all of 'em ! "
33866	33870	33863	33863	he	54	" Look here ! "
33917	33932	33933	33933	he	54	" There 's lots o ' dead wood as ought to be cut out , "
33936	33963	33965	33965	he	54	" An ' there 's a lot o ' old wood , but it made some new last year . This here 's a new bit , "
33991	33995	33996	33996	she	38	" That one ? "
33999	34007	33996	33996	she	38	" Is that one quite alive quite ? "
34015	34025	34026	34026	he	54	" It 's as wick as you or me , "
34038	34040	34033	34033	Martha	50	" wick "
34042	34044	34033	34033	Martha	50	" alive "
34046	34049	34033	34033	Martha	50	" lively . "
34050	34058	34059	34059	she	38	" I 'm glad it 's wick ! "
34066	34090	34059	34059	she	38	" I want them all to be wick . Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are . "
34134	34140	34141	34141	he	54	" They 've run wild , "
34144	34189	34191	34191	he	54	" but th ' strongest ones has fair thrived on it . The delicatest ones has died out , but th ' others has growed an ' growed , an ' spread an ' spread , till they 's a wonder . See here ! "
34203	34236	34191	34191	he	54	" A body might think this was dead wood , but I do n't believe it is down to th ' root . I 'll cut it low down an ' see . "
34257	34260	34261	34261	he	54	" There ! "
34265	34283	34261	34261	he	54	" I told thee so . There 's green in that wood yet . Look at it . "
34300	34317	34318	34318	he	54	" When it looks a bit greenish an ' juicy like that , it 's wick , "
34321	34386	34387	34387	he	54	" When th ' inside is dry an ' breaks easy , like this here piece I 've cut off , it 's done for . There 's a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of , an ' if th ' old wood 's cut off an ' it 's dug round , and took care of there 'll be "
34404	34417	34387	34387	he	54	" there 'll be a fountain o ' roses here this summer . "
34575	34578	34579	34579	he	54	" Why ! "
34591	34597	34579	34579	he	54	" Who did that there ? "
34613	34618	34620	34620	Mary	38	" I did it , "
34622	34637	34638	34638	he	54	" Why , I thought tha ' did n't know nothin' about gardenin ' , "
34641	34646	34647	34647	she	38	" I do n't , "
34650	34695	34647	34647	she	38	" but they were so little , and the grass was so thick and strong , and they looked as if they had no room to breathe . So I made a place for them . I do n't even know what they are . "
34709	34715	34716	34716	he	54	" Tha ' was right , "
34719	34754	34716	34716	he	54	" A gardener could n't have told thee better . They 'll grow now like Jack 's bean - stalk . They 're crocuses an ' snowdrops , an ' these here is narcissuses , "
34760	34774	34716	34716	he	54	" an here 's daffydowndillys . Eh ! they will be a sight . "
34783	34799	34800	34800	he	54	" Tha ' has done a lot o ' work for such a little wench , "
34807	34813	34815	34815	Mary	38	" I 'm growing fatter , "
34817	34853	34815	34815	Mary	38	" and I 'm growing stronger . I used always to be tired . When I dig I 'm not tired at all . I like to smell the earth when it 's turned up . "
34854	34862	34863	34863	he	54	" It 's rare good for thee , "
34871	34964	34867	34867	his	54	" There 's naught as nice as th ' smell o ' good clean earth , except th ' smell o ' fresh growin ' things when th ' rain falls on 'em . I get out on th ' moor many a day when it 's rainin ' an ' I lie under a bush an ' listen to th ' soft swish o ' drops on th ' heather an ' I just sniff an ' sniff . My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit 's , mother says . "
34965	34972	34974	34974	Mary	38	" Do you never catch cold ? "
34996	35000	35001	35001	he	54	" Not me , "
35006	35075	35001	35001	he	54	" I never ketched cold since I was born . I was n't brought up nesh enough . I 've chased about th ' moor in all weathers same as th ' rabbits does . Mother says I 've sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year ' to ever get to sniffin ' with cold . I 'm as tough as a white - thorn knobstick . "
35100	35111	35112	35112	he	54	" There 's a lot of work to do here ! "
35121	35133	35134	35134	Mary	38	" Will you come again and help me to do it ? "
35137	35169	35134	35134	Mary	38	" I 'm sure I can help , too . I can dig and pull up weeds , and do whatever you tell me . Oh ! do come , Dickon ! "
35170	35186	35187	35187	he	54	" I 'll come every day if tha ' wants me , rain or shine , "
35191	35214	35187	35187	he	54	" It 's the best fun I ever had in my life shut in here an ' wakenin ' up a garden . "
35215	35221	35223	35223	Mary	38	" If you will come , "
35225	35246	35247	35247	she	38	" if you will help me to make it alive I 'll I do n't know what I 'll do , "
35261	35270	35272	35272	Dickon	54	" I 'll tell thee what tha'll do , "
35279	35320	35272	35272	Dickon	54	" Tha'll get fat an ' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an ' tha'll learn how to talk to th ' robin same as I do . Eh ! we 'll have a lot o ' fun . "
35343	35370	35371	35371	he	54	" I would n't want to make it look like a gardener 's garden , all clipped an ' spick an ' span , would you ? "
35374	35399	35371	35371	he	54	" It 's nicer like this with things runnin ' wild , an ' swingin ' an ' catchin ' hold of each other . "
35400	35409	35411	35411	Mary	38	" Do n't let us make it tidy , "
35414	35428	35411	35411	Mary	38	" It would n't seem like a secret garden if it was tidy . "
35443	35452	35453	35453	he	54	" It 's a secret garden sure enough , "
35456	35481	35453	35453	he	54	" but seems like some one besides th ' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year ' ago . "
35482	35494	35496	35496	Mary	38	" But the door was locked and the key was buried , "
35498	35505	35496	35496	Mary	38	" No one could get in . "
35506	35511	35512	35512	he	54	" That 's true , "
35515	35549	35512	35512	he	54	" It 's a queer place . Seems to me as if there 'd been a bit o ' prunin ' done here an ' there , later than ten year ' ago . "
35550	35559	35561	35561	Mary	38	" But how could it have been done ? "
35578	35585	35586	35586	he	54	" Aye ! how could it ! "
35589	35602	35586	35586	he	54	" With th ' door locked an ' th ' key buried . "
35667	35677	35678	35678	she	38	" Are there any flowers that look like bells ? "
35681	35690	35691	35691	he	54	" Lilies o ' th ' valley does , "
35700	35712	35691	35691	he	54	" an ' there 's Canterbury bells , an ' campanulas . "
35713	35719	35721	35721	Mary	38	" Let 's plant some , "
35723	35793	35721	35721	Mary	38	" There 's lilies o ' th , valley here already ; I saw 'em . They 'll have growed too close an ' we 'll have to separate 'em , but there 's plenty . Th ' other ones takes two years to bloom from seed , but I can bring you some bits o ' plants from our cottage garden . Why does tha ' want 'em ? "
35819	35825	35816	35816	their	819	" Mistress Mary Quite Contrary . "
35826	35838	35840	35841	Mistress Mary	38	" They used to dance round and sing at me . They sang
35886	35886	35868	35868	I	0	"
35903	35913	35893	35893	her	38	" I was n't as contrary as they were . "
35918	35921	35922	35922	he	54	" Eh ! "
35944	36002	35935	35935	he	54	" There does n't seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there 's flowers an ' such like , an ' such lots o ' friendly wild things runnin ' about makin ' homes for themselves , or buildin ' nests an ' singin ' an ' whistlin ' , does there ? "
36019	36022	36023	36023	she	38	" Dickon , "
36026	36057	36023	36023	she	38	" you are as nice as Martha said you were . I like you , and you make the fifth person . I never thought I should like five people . "
36100	36109	36110	36110	he	54	" Only five folk as tha ' likes ? "
36113	36121	36110	36110	he	54	" Who is th ' other four ? "
36122	36128	36129	36129	Mary	38	" Your mother and Martha , "
36137	36145	36129	36129	Mary	38	" and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff . "
36165	36177	36178	36178	he	54	" I know tha ' thinks I 'm a queer lad , "
36181	36197	36178	36178	he	54	" but I think tha ' art th ' queerest little lass I ever saw . "
36251	36258	36259	36259	she	38	" Does tha ' like me ? "
36262	36265	36266	36266	he	54	" Eh ! "
36270	36292	36266	36266	he	54	" that I does . I likes thee wonderful , an ' so does th ' robin , I do believe ! "
36293	36300	36302	36302	Mary	38	" That 's two , then , "
36304	36311	36302	36302	Mary	38	" That 's two for me . "
36347	36354	36355	36355	she	38	" I shall have to go , "
36359	36372	36355	36355	she	38	" And you will have to go too , wo n't you ? "
36376	36387	36388	36388	he	54	" My dinner 's easy to carry about with me , "
36391	36406	36388	36388	he	54	" Mother always lets me put a bit o ' somethin' in my pocket . "
36455	36463	36464	36464	he	54	" It 's oftenest naught but bread , "
36467	36483	36464	36464	he	54	" but I 've got a fine slice o ' fat bacon with it today . "
36500	36509	36510	36510	he	54	" Run on an ' get thy victuals , "
36513	36535	36510	36510	he	54	" I 'll be done with mine first . I 'll get some more work done before I start back home . "
36546	36555	36556	36556	he	54	" I 'll call th ' robin up , "
36559	36584	36556	36556	he	54	" and give him th ' rind o ' th ' bacon to peck at . They likes a bit o ' fat wonderful . "
36646	36656	36657	36657	she	38	" Whatever happens , you you never would tell ? "
36684	36714	36715	36715	he	54	" If tha ' was a missel thrush an ' showed me where thy nest was , does tha ' think I 'd tell any one ? Not me , "
36718	36729	36715	36715	he	54	" Tha ' art as safe as a missel thrush . "
36740	36749	36750	36750	Mary	38	" MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH ? "
36796	36803	36804	36804	she	38	" Tha 's a bit late , "
36807	36814	36804	36804	she	38	" Where has tha ' been ? "
36815	36821	36823	36823	Mary	38	" I 've seen Dickon ! "
36825	36831	36823	36823	Mary	38	" I 've seen Dickon ! "
36832	36839	36841	36841	Martha	50	" I knew he 'd come , "
36844	36852	36841	36841	Martha	50	" How does tha ' like him ? "
36853	36862	36864	36864	Mary	38	" I think I think he 's beautiful ! "
36882	36885	36886	36886	she	50	" Well , "
36889	36916	36886	36886	she	50	" he 's th ' best lad as ever was born , but us never thought he was handsome . His nose turns up too much . "
36917	36925	36927	36927	Mary	38	" I like it to turn up , "
36929	36938	36940	36940	Martha	50	" An ' his eyes is so round , "
36946	36954	36940	36940	Martha	50	" Though they 're a nice color . "
36955	36961	36963	36963	Mary	38	" I like them round , "
36965	36979	36963	36963	Mary	38	" And they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor . "
36985	37022	36940	36940	Martha	50	" Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin ' up at th ' birds an ' th ' clouds . But he has got a big mouth , has n't he , now ? "
37023	37030	37032	37032	Mary	38	" I love his big mouth , "
37035	37044	37032	37032	Mary	38	" I wish mine were just like it . "
37049	37064	37065	37065	she	50	" It 'd look rare an ' funny in thy bit of a face , "
37068	37098	37065	37065	she	50	" But I knowed it would be that way when tha ' saw him . How did tha ' like th ' seeds an ' th ' garden tools ? "
37099	37108	37110	37110	Mary	38	" How did you know he brought them ? "
37112	37145	37189	37189	she	38	" Eh ! I never thought of him not bringin ' 'em . He 'd be sure to bring 'em if they was in Yorkshire . He 's such a trusty lad . "
37201	37210	37211	37211	she	38	" Who did tha ' ask about it ? "
37214	37222	37224	37224	Mary	38	" I have n't asked anybody yet , "
37228	37249	37224	37224	Mary	38	" Well , I would n't ask th ' head gardener . He 's too grand , Mr. Roach is . "
37250	37257	37259	37259	Mary	38	" I 've never seen him , "
37261	37271	37259	37259	Mary	38	" I 've only seen undergardeners and Ben Weatherstaff . "
37272	37284	37286	37286	Martha	50	" If I was you , I 'd ask Ben Weatherstaff , "
37288	37351	37286	37286	Martha	50	" He 's not half as bad as he looks , for all he 's so crabbed . Mr. Craven lets him do what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive , an ' he used to make her laugh . She liked him . Perhaps he 'd find you a corner somewhere out o ' the way . "
37352	37377	37378	37378	Mary	38	" If it was out of the way and no one wanted it , no one could mind my having it , could they ? "
37382	37390	37392	37392	Martha	50	" There would n't be no reason , "
37394	37402	37392	37392	Martha	50	" You would n't do no harm . "
37439	37448	37449	37449	she	50	" I 've got somethin' to tell you , "
37452	37480	37449	37449	she	50	" I thought I 'd let you eat your dinner first . Mr. Craven came back this mornin ' and I think he wants to see you . "
37486	37489	37490	37490	she	38	" Oh ! "
37493	37517	37490	37490	she	38	" Why ! Why ! He did n't want to see me when I came . I heard Pitcher say he did n't . "
37518	37521	37523	37523	Martha	50	" Well , "
37525	37620	37523	37523	Martha	50	" Mrs. Medlock says it 's because o ' mother . She was walkin ' to Thwaite village an ' she met him . She 'd never spoke to him before , but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times . He 'd forgot , but mother had n't an ' she made bold to stop him . I do n't know what she said to him about you but she said somethin' as put him in th ' mind to see you before he goes away again , tomorrow . "
37621	37624	37626	37626	Mary	38	" Oh ! "
37628	37640	37626	37626	Mary	38	" is he going away tomorrow ? I am so glad ! "
37641	37675	37523	37523	Martha	50	" He 's goin' for a long time . He may n't come back till autumn or winter . He 's goin' to travel in foreign places . He 's always doin' it . "
37676	37686	37688	37688	Mary	38	" Oh ! I 'm so glad so glad ! "
37737	37747	37718	37718	he	831	" When do you think he will want to see "
37827	37833	37834	37834	she	45	" Your hair 's rough , "
37838	37868	37834	37834	she	45	" Go and brush it . Martha , help her to slip on her best dress . Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him in his study . "
38019	38023	38015	38016	some one	151	" Come in , "
38048	38056	38057	38057	she	45	" This is Miss Mary , sir , "
38060	38083	38085	38086	Mr. Craven	41	" You can go and leave her here . I will ring for you when I want you to take her away , "
38161	38165	38166	38166	he	1910	" Come here ! "
38221	38226	38227	38227	he	1910	" Are you well ? "
38230	38233	38235	38235	Mary	38	" Yes , "
38237	38246	38257	38257	he	1910	" Do they take good care of you ? "
38247	38250	38257	38257	he	1910	" Yes . "
38262	38268	38269	38269	he	1910	" You are very thin , "
38272	38278	38279	38279	Mary	38	" I am getting fatter , "
38326	38331	38332	38332	he	1910	" I forgot you , "
38335	38364	38332	38332	he	1910	" How could I remember you ? I intended to send you a governess or a nurse , or some one of that sort , but I forgot . "
38365	38368	38370	38370	Mary	38	" Please , "
38372	38374	38370	38370	Mary	38	" Please "
38385	38393	38394	38394	he	1910	" What do you want to say ? "
38397	38408	38410	38410	Mary	38	" I am I am too big for a nurse , "
38412	38425	38410	38410	Mary	38	" And please please do n't make me have a governess yet . "
38436	38445	38446	38446	he	1910	" That was what the Sowerby woman said , "
38458	38467	38468	38468	she	38	" Is she is she Martha 's mother ? "
38471	38478	38479	38479	he	1910	" Yes , I think so , "
38482	38488	38490	38490	Mary	38	" She knows about children , "
38492	38500	38490	38490	Mary	38	" She has twelve . She knows . "
38507	38515	38501	38501	He	1910	" What do you want to do ? "
38516	38525	38526	38526	Mary	38	" I want to play out of doors , "
38537	38557	38531	38531	her	38	" I never liked it in India . It makes me hungry here , and I am getting fatter . "
38563	38577	38578	38578	he	1910	" Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good . Perhaps it will , "
38581	38595	38578	38578	he	1910	" She thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess . "
38596	38613	38615	38615	Mary	38	" It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor , "
38617	38623	38624	38624	he	1910	" Where do you play ? "
38628	38631	38633	38633	Mary	38	" Everywhere , "
38635	38675	38633	38633	Mary	38	" Martha 's mother sent me a skipping - rope . I skip and run and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth . I do n't do any harm . "
38676	38683	38684	38684	he	1910	" Do n't look so frightened , "
38691	38711	38684	38684	he	1910	" You could not do any harm , a child like you ! You may do what you like . "
38745	38749	38750	38750	she	38	" May I ? "
38766	38773	38774	38774	he	1910	" Do n't look so frightened , "
38777	38884	38774	38774	he	1910	" Of course you may . I am your guardian , though I am a poor one for any child . I can not give you time or attention . I am too ill , and wretched and distracted ; but I wish you to be happy and comfortable . I do n't know anything about children , but Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need . I sent for you to - day because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you . Her daughter had talked about you . She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about . "
38885	38892	38893	38893	Mary	38	" She knows all about children , "
38901	38906	38908	38909	Mr. Craven	41	" She ought to , "
38911	38935	38908	38909	Mr. Craven	41	" I thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor , but she said Mrs. Craven had been kind to her . "
38949	39003	38940	38940	him	41	" She is a respectable woman . Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things . Play out of doors as much as you like . It 's a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like . Is there anything you want ? "
39013	39023	38940	38940	him	41	" Do you want toys , books , dolls ? "
39024	39028	39030	39030	Mary	38	" Might I , "
39032	39041	39030	39030	Mary	38	" might I have a bit of earth ? "
39074	39077	39078	39078	he	41	" Earth ! "
39081	39087	39078	39078	he	41	" What do you mean ? "
39088	39103	39104	39104	Mary	38	" To plant seeds in to make things grow to see them come alive , "
39123	39132	39133	39133	he	41	" Do you care about gardens so much , "
39137	39147	39149	39149	Mary	38	" I did n't know about them in India , "
39151	39184	39149	39149	Mary	38	" I was always ill and tired and it was too hot . I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them . But here it is different . "
39198	39204	39205	39205	he	41	" A bit of earth , "
39239	39250	39251	39251	he	41	" You can have as much earth as you want , "
39254	39281	39251	39251	he	41	" You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow . When you see a bit of earth you want , "
39288	39300	39251	39251	he	41	" take it , child , and make it come alive . "
39301	39314	39365	39365	she	38	" May I take it from anywhere if it 's not wanted ? "
39315	39318	39319	39319	he	41	" Anywhere , "
39322	39334	39319	39319	he	41	" There ! You must go now , I am tired . "
39344	39356	39341	39342	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Good - by . I shall be away all summer . "
39374	39378	39379	39380	Mr. Craven	41	" Mrs. Medlock , "
39385	39462	39379	39380	Mr. Craven	41	" now I have seen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant . She must be less delicate before she begins lessons . Give her simple , healthy food . Let her run wild in the garden . Do n't look after her too much . She needs liberty and fresh air and romping about . Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage . "
39477	39480	39474	39474	she	45	" look after "
39516	39522	39523	39523	she	45	" Thank you , sir , "
39526	39612	39523	39523	she	45	" Susan Sowerby and me went to school together and she 's as sensible and good - hearted a woman as you 'd find in a day 's walk . I never had any children myself and she 's had twelve , and there never was healthier or better ones . Miss Mary can get no harm from them . I 'd always take Susan Sowerby 's advice about children myself . She 's what you might call healthy - minded if you understand me . "
39613	39617	39618	39619	Mr. Craven	41	" I understand , "
39622	39634	39618	39619	Mr. Craven	41	" Take Miss Mary away now and send Pitcher to me . "
39676	39683	39685	39685	Mary	38	" I can have my garden ! "
39687	39745	39685	39685	Mary	38	" I may have it where I like ! I am not going to have a governess for a long time ! Your mother is coming to see me and I may go to your cottage ! He says a little girl like me could not do any harm and I may do what I like anywhere ! "
39746	39749	39751	39751	Martha	50	" Eh ! "
39754	39764	39751	39751	Martha	50	" that was nice of him was n't it ? "
39765	39768	39770	39770	Mary	38	" Martha , "
39773	39795	39770	39770	Mary	38	" he is really a nice man , only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together . "
39921	39926	39927	39927	she	50	" He 's gone , "
39931	39945	39927	39927	she	50	" Oh ! was he was he was he only a wood fairy ? "
40058	40064	40055	40055	they	857	" I will cum bak . "
40067	40071	40072	40072	Mary	38	" I AM COLIN "
40093	40096	40098	40098	Martha	50	" Eh ! "
40103	40138	40098	40098	Martha	50	" I never knew our Dickon was as clever as that . That there 's a picture of a missel thrush on her nest , as large as life an ' twice as natural . "
40257	40259	40312	40312	She	38	" wuthering "
40284	40295	40296	40296	she	38	" The rain is as contrary as I ever was , "
40299	40311	40296	40296	she	38	" It came because it knew I did not want it . "
40348	40351	40352	40352	She	38	" wuthering . "
40388	40390	40352	40352	She	38	" wuthered "
40404	40422	40423	40423	she	38	" It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying , "
40465	40473	40474	40474	she	38	" It is n't the wind now , "
40481	40500	40474	40474	she	38	" That is n't the wind . It is different . It is that crying I heard before . "
40594	40605	40606	40606	she	38	" I am going to find out what it is , "
40609	40627	40606	40606	she	38	" Everybody is in bed and I do n't care about Mrs. Medlock I do n't care ! "
41123	41128	41129	41129	he	792	" Who are you ? "
41140	41146	41129	41129	he	792	" Are you a ghost ? "
41147	41154	41155	41155	Mary	38	" No , I am not , "
41165	41170	41155	41155	Mary	38	" Are you one ? "
41210	41213	41214	41214	he	792	" No , "
41223	41228	41214	41214	he	792	" I am Colin . "
41229	41234	41235	41235	she	38	" Who is Colin ? "
41238	41248	41214	41214	he	792	" I am Colin Craven . Who are you ? "
41249	41261	41214	41214	he	792	" I am Mary Lennox . Mr. Craven is my uncle . "
41262	41268	41270	41271	the boy	792	" He is my father , "
41273	41277	41279	41279	Mary	38	" Your father ! "
41281	41297	41279	41279	Mary	38	" No one ever told me he had a boy ! Why did n't they ? "
41298	41302	41303	41303	he	792	" Come here , "
41335	41344	41345	41345	he	792	" You are real , are n't you ? "
41348	41364	41345	41345	he	792	" I have such real dreams very often . You might be one of them . "
41388	41400	41401	41401	she	38	" Rub that and see how thick and warm it is , "
41404	41435	41401	41401	she	38	" I will pinch you a little if you like , to show you how real I am . For a minute I thought you might be a dream too . "
41436	41443	41444	41444	he	792	" Where did you come from ? "
41447	41484	41401	41401	she	38	" From my own room . The wind wuthered so I could n't go to sleep and I heard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was . What were you crying for ? "
41485	41505	41401	41401	she	38	" Because I could n't go to sleep either and my head ached . Tell me your name again . "
41506	41523	41401	41401	she	38	" Mary Lennox . Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here ? "
41550	41553	41554	41554	he	792	" No , "
41557	41562	41554	41554	he	792	" They dare n't . "
41563	41566	41568	41568	Mary	38	" Why ? "
41570	41594	41554	41554	he	792	" Because I should have been afraid you would see me . I wo n't let people see me and talk me over . "
41595	41598	41599	41599	Mary	38	" Why ? "
41609	41671	41554	41554	he	792	" Because I am like this always , ill and having to lie down . My father wo n't let people talk me over either . The servants are not allowed to speak about me . If I live I may be a hunchback , but I sha n't live . My father hates to think I may be like him . "
41672	41682	41683	41683	Mary	38	" Oh , what a queer house this is ! "
41686	41717	41683	41683	Mary	38	" What a queer house ! Everything is a kind of secret . Rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up and you ! Have you been locked up ? "
41718	41744	41554	41554	he	792	" No . I stay in this room because I do n't want to be moved out of it . It tires me too much . "
41745	41754	41755	41755	Mary	38	" Does your father come and see you ? "
41758	41775	41755	41755	Mary	38	" Sometimes . Generally when I am asleep . He does n't want to see me . "
41776	41779	41780	41780	Mary	38	" Why ? "
41799	41836	41755	41755	Mary	38	" My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me . He thinks I do n't know , but I 've heard people talking . He almost hates me . "
41837	41847	41849	41849	Mary	38	" He hates the garden , because she died , "
41855	41859	41860	41861	the boy	792	" What garden ? "
41864	41876	41877	41877	Mary	38	" Oh ! just just a garden she used to like , "
41880	41887	41877	41877	Mary	38	" Have you been here always ? "
41888	41972	41860	41861	the boy	792	" Nearly always . Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside , but I wo n't stay because people stare at me . I used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight , but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said it was stupid . He told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air . I hate fresh air and I do n't want to go out . "
41973	41983	41985	41985	Mary	38	" I did n't when first I came here , "
41987	41998	41985	41985	Mary	38	" Why do you keep looking at me like that ? "
41999	42009	42010	42010	he	888	" Because of the dreams that are so real , "
42015	42030	42010	42010	he	888	" Sometimes when I open my eyes I do n't believe I 'm awake . "
42031	42037	42039	42039	Mary	38	" We 're both awake , "
42059	42092	42041	42041	She	38	" It looks quite like a dream , and it 's the middle of the night , and everybody in the house is asleep everybody but us . We are wide awake . "
42093	42104	42105	42106	the boy	792	" I do n't want it to be a dream , "
42118	42129	42130	42130	she	38	" If you do n't like people to see you , "
42133	42142	42130	42130	she	38	" do you want me to go away ? "
42159	42162	42163	42163	he	792	" No , "
42166	42200	42163	42163	he	792	" I should be sure you were a dream if you went . If you are real , sit down on that big footstool and talk . I want to hear about you . "
42248	42258	42259	42259	she	38	" What do you want me to tell you ? "
42453	42463	42464	42464	he	792	" Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me , "
42468	42487	42464	42464	he	792	" It makes me ill to be angry . No one believes I shall live to grow up . "
42565	42571	42572	42572	he	792	" How old are you ? "
42575	42580	42582	42582	Mary	38	" I am ten , "
42590	42596	42582	42582	Mary	38	" and so are you . "
42597	42604	42605	42605	he	792	" How do you know that ? "
42612	42638	42605	42605	he	792	" Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried . And it has been locked for ten years . "
42653	42670	42671	42671	he	792	" What garden door was locked ? Who did it ? Where was the key buried ? "
42682	42692	42694	42694	Mary	38	" It it was the garden Mr. Craven hates , "
42697	42714	42694	42694	Mary	38	" He locked the door . No one no one knew where he buried the key . "
42715	42724	42725	42725	Colin	81	" What sort of a garden is it ? "
42729	42743	42745	42745	Mary	38	" No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years , "
42814	42822	42824	42824	Mary	38	" They wo n't talk about it , "
42826	42838	42824	42824	Mary	38	" I think they have been told not to answer questions . "
42839	42845	42847	42847	Colin	81	" I would make them , "
42849	42853	42854	42854	Mary	38	" Could you ? "
42876	42889	42890	42890	he	81	" Everyone is obliged to please me . I told you that , "
42893	42920	42890	42890	he	81	" If I were to live , this place would sometime belong to me . They all know that . I would make them tell me . "
42968	42977	42978	42978	she	38	" Do you think you wo n't live ? "
42997	43005	43006	43006	he	904	" I do n't suppose I shall , "
43016	43092	43011	43011	he	904	" Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say I sha n't . At first they thought I was too little to understand and now they think I do n't hear . But I do . My doctor is my father 's cousin . He is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my father is dead . I should think he would n't want me to live . "
43093	43100	43102	43102	Mary	38	" Do you want to live ? "
43104	43107	43108	43108	he	907	" No , "
43118	43144	43108	43108	he	907	" But I do n't want to die . When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry . "
43145	43154	43155	43155	Mary	38	" I have heard you crying three times , "
43158	43174	43175	43175	She	38	" but I did not know who it was . Were you crying about that ? "
43185	43190	43191	43191	he	907	" I dare say , "
43194	43215	43191	43191	he	907	" Let us talk about something else . Talk about that garden . Do n't you want to see it ? "
43216	43219	43221	43221	Mary	38	" Yes , "
43229	43233	43234	43234	he	907	" I do , "
43239	43302	43234	43234	he	907	" I do n't think I ever really wanted to see anything before , but I want to see that garden . I want the key dug up . I want the door unlocked . I would let them take me there in my chair . That would be getting fresh air . I am going to make them open the door . "
43324	43331	43332	43332	he	907	" They have to please me , "
43335	43352	43332	43332	he	907	" I will make them take me there and I will let you go , too . "
43388	43402	43403	43403	she	38	" Oh , do n't do n't do n't do n't do that ! "
43418	43421	43422	43422	he	907	" Why ? "
43425	43434	43422	43422	he	907	" You said you wanted to see it . "
43435	43439	43440	43440	she	38	" I do , "
43450	43473	43447	43447	her	38	" but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again . "
43480	43484	43485	43485	he	907	" A secret , "
43488	43497	43485	43485	he	907	" What do you mean ? Tell me . "
43507	43513	43514	43514	she	38	" You see you see , "
43517	43605	43514	43514	she	38	" if no one knows but ourselves if there was a door , hidden somewhere under the ivy if there was and we could find it ; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind us , and no one knew any one was inside and we called it our garden and pretended that that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest , and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive "
43606	43611	43612	43612	he	909	" Is it dead ? "
43616	43628	43629	43629	she	38	" It soon will be if no one cares for it , "
43633	43641	43629	43629	she	38	" The bulbs will live but the roses "
43653	43658	43659	43659	he	909	" What are bulbs ? "
43664	43691	43642	43642	He	909	" They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops . They are working in the earth now pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming . "
43692	43698	43699	43699	he	909	" Is the spring coming ? "
43702	43720	43699	43699	he	909	" What is it like ? You do n't see it in rooms if you are ill . "
43721	43748	43750	43750	Mary	38	" It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine , and things pushing up and working under the earth , "
43752	43806	43750	43750	Mary	38	" If the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow bigger every day , and see how many roses are alive . Do n't you see ? Oh , do n't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret ? "
43824	43831	43832	43832	he	909	" I never had a secret , "
43835	43869	43832	43832	he	909	" except that one about not living to grow up . They do n't know I know that , so it is a sort of secret . But I like this kind better . "
43870	43883	43885	43885	Mary	38	" If you wo n't make them take you to the garden , "
43887	43955	43885	43885	Mary	38	" perhaps I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime . And then if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair , and if you can always do what you want to do , perhaps perhaps we might find some boy who would push you , and we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden . "
43956	43962	43963	43963	he	910	" I should like that , "
43973	43990	43963	43963	he	910	" I should like that . I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden . "
44061	44081	44082	44082	she	38	" I 'll tell you what I think it would be like , if we could go into it , "
44085	44101	44082	44082	she	38	" It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps . "
44223	44234	44235	44235	he	910	" I did not know birds could be like that , "
44238	44270	44235	44235	he	910	" But if you stay in a room you never see things . What a lot of things you know . I feel as if you had been inside that garden . "
44303	44314	44315	44315	he	910	" I am going to let you look at something , "
44318	44338	44315	44315	he	910	" Do you see that rose - colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel - piece ? "
44370	44373	44374	44374	she	38	" Yes , "
44377	44386	44388	44388	Colin	81	" There is a cord hanging from it , "
44390	44396	44388	44388	Colin	81	" Go and pull it . "
44486	44492	44494	44494	Colin	81	" She is my mother , "
44497	44514	44494	44494	Colin	81	" I do n't see why she died . Sometimes I hate her for doing it . "
44515	44519	44521	44521	Mary	38	" How queer ! "
44523	44538	44539	44539	he	81	" If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always , "
44542	44581	44539	44539	he	81	" I dare say I should have lived , too . And my father would not have hated to look at me . I dare say I should have had a strong back . Draw the curtain again . "
44594	44602	44603	44603	she	38	" She is much prettier than you , "
44606	44632	44603	44603	she	38	" but her eyes are just like yours at least they are the same shape and color . Why is the curtain drawn over her ? "
44637	44644	44645	44645	he	81	" I made them do it , "
44648	44687	44645	44645	he	81	" Sometimes I do n't like to see her looking at me . She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable . Besides , she is mine and I do n't want everyone to see her . "
44700	44716	44717	44717	she	38	" What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here ? "
44720	44731	44732	44732	he	81	" She would do as I told her to do , "
44735	44761	44732	44732	he	81	" And I should tell her that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day . I am glad you came . "
44762	44767	44769	44769	Mary	38	" So am I , "
44771	44782	44783	44783	she	38	" I will come as often as I can , but "
44785	44798	44732	44732	he	81	" I shall have to look every day for the garden door . "
44799	44805	44807	44807	Colin	81	" Yes , you must , "
44809	44819	44807	44807	Colin	81	" and you can tell me about it afterward . "
44839	44850	44851	44851	he	81	" I think you shall be a secret , too , "
44854	44890	44835	44835	he	81	" I will not tell them until they find out . I can always send the nurse out of the room and say that I want to be by myself . Do you know Martha ? "
44891	44900	44902	44902	Mary	38	" Yes , I know her very well , "
44904	44910	44902	44902	Mary	38	" She waits on me . "
44920	44969	44913	44913	his	81	" She is the one who is asleep in the other room . The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha attend to me when she wants to go out . Martha shall tell you when to come here . "
44986	44995	44996	44996	she	38	" Martha knew about you all the time ? "
44999	45021	44978	44978	she	38	" Yes ; she often attends to me . The nurse likes to get away from me and then Martha comes . "
45022	45031	45033	45033	Mary	38	" I have been here a long time , "
45035	45047	45033	45033	Mary	38	" Shall I go away now ? Your eyes look sleepy . "
45048	45061	45062	45062	he	916	" I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me , "
45067	45072	45074	45074	Mary	38	" Shut your eyes , "
45081	45109	45074	45074	Mary	38	" and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India . I will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low . "
45110	45117	45118	45118	he	916	" I should like that perhaps , "
45162	45167	45168	45168	he	916	" That is nice , "
45308	45316	45317	45317	she	38	" What 's the matter with thee ? "
45326	45337	45317	45317	she	38	" Tha ' looks as if tha'd somethin' to say . "
45338	45351	45353	45353	Mary	38	" I have . I have found out what the crying was , "
45371	45377	45378	45378	she	50	" Tha ' has n't ! "
45381	45384	45378	45378	she	50	" Never ! "
45385	45393	45394	45394	Mary	38	" I heard it in the night , "
45398	45420	45394	45394	Mary	38	" And I got up and went to see where it came from . It was Colin . I found him . "
45429	45435	45436	45436	she	50	" Eh ! Miss Mary ! "
45441	45485	45436	45436	she	50	" Tha ' should n't have done it tha ' should n't ! Tha'll get me in trouble . I never told thee nothin' about him but tha'll get me in trouble . I shall lose my place and what 'll mother do ! "
45486	45494	45496	45496	Mary	38	" You wo n't lose your place , "
45498	45518	45496	45496	Mary	38	" He was glad I came . We talked and talked and he said he was glad I came . "
45519	45523	45525	45525	Martha	50	" Was he ? "
45527	45585	45525	45525	Martha	50	" Art tha ' sure ? Tha ' does n't know what he 's like when anything vexes him . He 's a big lad to cry like a baby , but when he 's in a passion he 'll fair scream just to frighten us . He knows us dare n't call our souls our own . "
45586	45592	45594	45594	Mary	38	" He was n't vexed , "
45596	45661	45594	45594	Mary	38	" I asked him if I should go away and he made me stay . He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool and talked to him about India and about the robin and gardens . He would n't let me go . He let me see his mother 's picture . Before I left him I sang him to sleep . "
45668	45675	45676	45676	she	50	" I can scarcely believe thee ! "
45679	45727	45676	45676	she	50	" It 's as if tha'd walked straight into a lion 's den . If he 'd been like he is most times he 'd have throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th ' house . He wo n't let strangers look at him . "
45728	45752	45754	45754	Mary	38	" He let me look at him . I looked at him all the time and he looked at me . We stared ! "
45756	45765	45767	45768	agitated Martha	50	" I do n't know what to do ! "
45770	45795	45767	45768	agitated Martha	50	" If Mrs. Medlock finds out , she 'll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be packed back to mother . "
45796	45822	45824	45824	Mary	38	" He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet . It 's to be a sort of secret just at first , "
45827	45840	45824	45824	Mary	38	" And he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases . "
45841	45853	45855	45855	Martha	50	" Aye , that 's true enough th ' bad lad ! "
45864	45895	45824	45824	Mary	38	" He says Mrs. Medlock must . And he wants me to come and talk to him every day . And you are to tell me when he wants me . "
45896	45899	45901	45901	Martha	50	" Me ! "
45903	45914	45901	45901	Martha	50	" I shall lose my place I shall for sure ! "
45915	45937	45938	45938	Mary	38	" You ca n't if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him , "
45941	45949	45951	45951	Martha	50	" Does tha ' mean to say , "
45957	45965	45951	45951	Martha	50	" that he was nice to thee ! "
45966	45974	45975	45975	Mary	38	" I think he almost liked me , "
45978	45987	45989	45989	Martha	50	" Then tha ' must have bewitched him ! "
45996	46002	46004	46004	Mary	38	" Do you mean Magic ? "
46006	46115	46004	46004	Mary	38	" I 've heard about Magic in India , but I ca n't make it . I just went into his room and I was so surprised to see him I stood and stared . And then he turned round and stared at me . And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was . And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other . And we began to ask each other questions . And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must not . "
46116	46127	46129	46129	Martha	50	" Th ' world 's comin ' to a end ! "
46131	46139	46141	46141	Mary	38	" What is the matter with him ? "
46143	46151	46153	46153	Martha	50	" Nobody knows for sure and certain , "
46155	46222	46153	46153	Martha	50	" Mr. Craven went off his head like when he was born . Th ' doctors thought he 'd have to be put in a ' sylum . It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you . He would n't set eyes on th ' baby . He just raved and said it 'd be another hunchback like him and it 'd better die . "
46223	46229	46230	46230	Mary	38	" Is Colin a hunchback ? "
46233	46241	46230	46230	Mary	38	" He did n't look like one . "
46242	46248	46250	46250	Martha	50	" He is n't yet , "
46252	46374	46250	46250	Martha	50	" But he began all wrong . Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th ' house to set any child wrong . They was afraid his back was weak an ' they 've always been takin ' care of it keepin ' him lyin ' down and not lettin ' him walk . Once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill . Then a big doctor came to see him an ' made them take it off . He talked to th ' other doctor quite rough in a polite way . He said there 'd been too much medicine and too much lettin ' him have his own way . "
46375	46385	46387	46387	Mary	38	" I think he 's a very spoiled boy , "
46389	46401	46403	46403	Martha	50	" He 's th ' worst young nowt as ever was ! "
46405	46568	46403	46403	Martha	50	" I wo n't say as he has n't been ill a good bit . He 's had coughs an ' colds that 's nearly killed him two or three times . Once he had rheumatic fever an ' once he had typhoid . Eh ! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then . He 'd been out of his head an ' she was talkin ' to th ' nurse , thinkin ' he did n't know nothin' , an ' she said , ' He 'll die this time sure enough , an ' best thing for him an ' for everybody . ' An ' she looked at him an ' there he was with his big eyes open , starin ' at her as sensible as she was herself . She did n't know wha'd happen but he just stared at her an ' says , ' You give me some water an ' stop talkin ' . ' "
46569	46577	46579	46579	Mary	38	" Do you think he will die ? "
46581	46652	46403	46403	Martha	50	" Mother says there 's no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air an ' does n't do nothin' but lie on his back an ' read picture - books an ' take medicine . He 's weak and hates th ' trouble o ' bein ' taken out o ' doors , an ' he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill . "
46661	46665	46666	46666	she	38	" I wonder , "
46670	46694	46666	46666	she	38	" if it would not do him good to go out into a garden and watch things growing . It did me good . "
46695	46706	46708	46708	Martha	50	" One of th ' worst fits he ever had , "
46710	46817	46708	46708	Martha	50	" was one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain . He 'd been readin ' in a paper about people gettin ' somethin' he called ' rose cold ' an ' he began to sneeze an ' said he 'd got it an ' then a new gardener as did n't know th ' rules passed by an ' looked at him curious . He threw himself into a passion an ' he said he 'd looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback . He cried himself into a fever an ' was ill all night . "
46818	46836	46838	46838	Mary	38	" If he ever gets angry at me , I 'll never go and see him again , "
46840	46850	46852	46852	Martha	50	" He 'll have thee if he wants thee , "
46854	46867	46852	46852	Martha	50	" Tha ' may as well know that at th ' start . "
46881	46897	46898	46898	she	50	" I dare say th ' nurse wants me to stay with him a bit , "
46901	46911	46898	46898	she	50	" I hope he 's in a good temper . "
46931	46940	46941	46941	she	50	" Well , tha ' has bewitched him , "
46944	47026	46923	46923	she	50	" He 's up on his sofa with his picture - books . He 's told the nurse to stay away until six o'clock . I 'm to wait in the next room . Th ' minute she was gone he called me to him an ' says , ' I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me , and remember you 're not to tell any one . ' You 'd better go as quick as you can . "
47156	47160	47161	47161	he	81	" Come in , "
47164	47174	47161	47161	he	81	" I 've been thinking about you all morning . "
47175	47185	47187	47187	Mary	38	" I 've been thinking about you , too , "
47189	47218	47187	47187	Mary	38	" You do n't know how frightened Martha is . She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away . "
47222	47231	47232	47232	he	81	" Go and tell her to come here , "
47235	47243	47232	47232	he	81	" She is in the next room . "
47264	47277	47278	47278	he	81	" Have you to do what I please or have you not ? "
47281	47292	47293	47293	Martha	50	" I have to do what you please , sir , "
47300	47309	47293	47293	Martha	50	" Has Medlock to do what I please ? "
47310	47316	47318	47318	Martha	50	" Everybody has , sir , "
47320	47348	47293	47293	Martha	50	" Well , then , if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me , how can Medlock send you away if she finds it out ? "
47349	47358	47360	47360	Martha	50	" Please do n't let her , sir , "
47362	47380	47382	47383	Master Craven	41	" I 'll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing , "
47386	47398	47382	47383	Master Craven	41	" She would n't like that , I can tell you . "
47399	47405	47293	47293	Martha	50	" Thank you , sir , "
47410	47420	47293	47293	Martha	50	" I want to do my duty , sir . "
47421	47428	47430	47430	Colin	81	" What I want is your duty "
47435	47447	47430	47430	Colin	81	" I 'll take care of you . Now go away . "
47470	47480	47481	47481	he	81	" Why do you look at me like that ? "
47485	47492	47481	47481	he	81	" What are you thinking about ? "
47493	47501	47464	47464	he	81	" I am thinking about two things . "
47502	47513	47481	47481	he	81	" What are they ? Sit down and tell me . "
47514	47521	47523	47523	Mary	38	" This is the first one , "
47532	47593	47523	47523	Mary	38	" Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah . He had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him . He spoke to his people just as you spoke to Martha . Everybody had to do everything he told them in a minute . I think they would have been killed if they had n't . "
47594	47605	47606	47606	he	924	" I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently , "
47609	47620	47606	47606	he	924	" but first tell me what the second thing was . "
47621	47626	47628	47628	Mary	38	" I was thinking , "
47630	47638	47628	47628	Mary	38	" how different you are from Dickon . "
47639	47644	47645	47645	he	924	" Who is Dickon ? "
47648	47654	47645	47645	he	924	" What a queer name ! "
47702	47715	47716	47716	she	38	" He is Martha 's brother . He is twelve years old , "
47719	47763	47716	47716	she	38	" He is not like any one else in the world . He can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in India charm snakes . He plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen . "
47783	47796	47797	47797	he	54	" There is a picture of a snake - charmer in this , "
47800	47807	47797	47797	he	54	" Come and look at it . "
47826	47832	47833	47833	he	54	" Can he do that ? "
47837	47847	47848	47848	Mary	38	" He played on his pipe and they listened , "
47851	47920	47848	47848	Mary	38	" But he does n't call it Magic . He says it 's because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways . He says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself , he likes them so . I think he asked the robin questions . It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps . "
47942	47950	47951	47951	he	81	" Tell me some more about him , "
47954	47963	47964	47964	Mary	38	" He knows all about eggs and nests , "
47968	48009	47964	47964	Mary	38	" And he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live . He keeps them secret so that other boys wo n't find their holes and frighten them . He knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor . "
48010	48017	48019	48019	Colin	81	" Does he like the moor ? "
48021	48037	48019	48019	Colin	81	" How can he when it 's such a great , bare , dreary place ? "
48038	48046	48048	48048	Mary	38	" It 's the most beautiful place , "
48050	48107	48048	48048	Mary	38	" Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other . They are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather . It 's their world . "
48108	48116	48118	48118	Colin	81	" How do you know all that ? "
48129	48139	48141	48141	Mary	38	" I have never been there once , really , "
48145	48213	48141	48141	Mary	38	" I only drove over it in the dark . I thought it was hideous . Martha told me about it first and then Dickon . When Dickon talks about it you feel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey and all full of bees and butterflies . "
48214	48224	48226	48226	Colin	81	" You never see anything if you are ill , "
48248	48259	48261	48261	Mary	38	" You ca n't if you stay in a room , "
48263	48272	48273	48273	he	81	" I could n't go on the moor , "
48293	48298	48288	48288	she	38	" You might sometime . "
48307	48323	48288	48288	she	38	" Go on the moor ! How could I ? I am going to die . "
48324	48330	48332	48332	Mary	38	" How do you know ? "
48366	48378	48379	48379	he	81	" Oh , I 've heard it ever since I remember , "
48383	48404	48379	48379	he	81	" They are always whispering about it and thinking I do n't notice . They wish I would , too . "
48417	48424	48425	48425	she	38	" If they wished I would , "
48428	48438	48425	48425	she	38	" I would n't . Who wishes you would ? "
48439	48495	48405	48406	Mistress Mary	38	" The servants and of course Dr. Craven because he would get Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor . He dare n't say so , but he always looks cheerful when I am worse . When I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat . I think my father wishes it , too . "
48496	48504	48506	48506	Mary	38	" I do n't believe he does , "
48520	48525	48526	48526	he	81	" Do n't you ? "
48570	48589	48591	48591	Mary	38	" I like the grand doctor from London , because he made them take the iron thing off , "
48594	48604	48591	48591	Mary	38	" Did he say you were going to die ? "
48605	48608	48556	48556	they	928	" No . "
48610	48616	48591	48591	Mary	38	" What did he say ? "
48617	48623	48624	48624	Colin	81	" He did n't whisper , "
48627	48679	48624	48624	Colin	81	" Perhaps he knew I hated whispering . I heard him say one thing quite aloud . He said , ' The lad might live if he would make up his mind to it . Put him in the humor . ' It sounded as if he was in a temper . "
48680	48695	48697	48697	Mary	38	" I 'll tell you who would put you in the humor , perhaps , "
48718	48805	48806	48806	She	38	" I believe Dickon would . He 's always talking about live things . He never talks about dead things or things that are ill . He 's always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying or looking down at the earth to see something growing . He has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about . And he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouth and his cheeks are as red as red as cherries . "
48832	48836	48837	48837	she	38	" See here , "
48840	48878	48837	48837	she	38	" Do n't let us talk about dying ; I do n't like it . Let us talk about living . Let us talk and talk about Dickon . And then we will look at your pictures . "
49112	49127	49128	49128	he	81	" Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of , "
49131	49136	49128	49128	he	81	" We are cousins . "
49211	49215	49218	49219	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Good Lord ! "
49230	49234	49218	49219	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Good Lord ! "
49235	49240	49242	49243	Dr. Craven	86	" What is this ? "
49248	49254	49242	49243	Dr. Craven	86	" What does it mean ? "
49305	49314	49315	49315	he	81	" This is my cousin , Mary Lennox , "
49318	49346	49315	49315	he	81	" I asked her to come and talk to me . I like her . She must come and talk to me whenever I send for her . "
49355	49359	49360	49360	she	45	" Oh , sir "
49363	49391	49360	49360	she	45	" I do n't know how it 's happened . There 's not a servant on the place tha'd dare to talk they all have their orders . "
49392	49398	49400	49400	Colin	81	" Nobody told her anything , "
49402	49425	49400	49400	Colin	81	" She heard me crying and found me herself . I am glad she came . Do n't be silly , Medlock . "
49459	49480	49481	49481	he	86	" I am afraid there has been too much excitement . Excitement is not good for you , my boy , "
49484	49494	49496	49496	Colin	81	" I should be excited if she kept away , "
49506	49532	49498	49498	his	81	" I am better . She makes me better . The nurse must bring up her tea with mine . We will have tea together . "
49556	49565	49567	49568	Mrs. Medlock	45	" He does look rather better , sir , "
49570	49572	49567	49568	Mrs. Medlock	45	" But "
49577	49590	49567	49568	Mrs. Medlock	45	" he looked better this morning before she came into the room . "
49591	49623	49625	49625	Colin	81	" She came into the room last night . She stayed with me a long time . She sang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep , "
49627	49652	49625	49625	Colin	81	" I was better when I wakened up . I wanted my breakfast . I want my tea now . Tell nurse , Medlock . "
49749	49756	49757	49757	he	81	" I want to forget it , "
49762	49776	49757	49757	he	81	" She makes me forget it . That is why I want her . "
49848	49864	49866	49866	Colin	81	" They are always wanting me to eat things when I do n't want to , "
49885	49908	49866	49866	Colin	81	" Now , if you 'll eat I will . Those muffins look so nice and hot . Tell me about Rajahs . "
50053	50079	50080	50081	Mrs. Medlock	45	" You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night , "
50085	50155	50080	50081	Mrs. Medlock	45	" But there 's no saying it 's not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us . He 's not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends . The nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him , but she says she does n't mind staying now you 've gone on duty with her , "
50426	50440	50441	50441	she	50	" Th ' air from th ' moor has done thee good already , "
50445	50488	50441	50441	she	50	" Tha'rt not nigh so yeller and tha'rt not nigh so scrawny . Even tha ' hair does n't slamp down on tha ' head so flat . It 's got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit . "
50489	50495	50497	50497	Mary	38	" It 's like me , "
50499	50516	50497	50497	Mary	38	" It 's growing stronger and fatter . I 'm sure there 's more of it . "
50517	50525	50527	50527	Martha	50	" It looks it , for sure , "
50538	50563	50527	50527	Martha	50	" Tha'rt not half so ugly when it 's that way an ' there 's a bit o ' red in tha ' cheeks . "
50603	50616	50617	50617	she	38	" Why does it make you angry when you are looked at ? "
50622	50628	50629	50629	he	81	" I always hated it , "
50632	50729	50629	50629	he	81	" even when I was very little . Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I should n't live to grow up . Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say ' Poor child ! ' Once when a lady did that I screamed out loud and bit her hand . She was so frightened she ran away . "
50730	50741	50743	50743	Mary	38	" She thought you had gone mad like a dog , "
50750	50759	50761	50761	Colin	81	" I do n't care what she thought , "
50765	50783	50785	50785	Mary	38	" I wonder why you did n't scream and bite me when I came into your room ? "
50794	50805	50806	50806	he	81	" I thought you were a ghost or a dream , "
50809	50829	50806	50806	he	81	" You ca n't bite a ghost or a dream , and if you scream they do n't care . "
50830	50843	50844	50844	Mary	38	" Would you hate it if if a boy looked at you ? "
50858	50864	50865	50865	he	81	" There 's one boy , "
50879	50903	50865	50865	he	81	" there 's one boy I believe I should n't mind . It 's that boy who knows where the foxes live Dickon . "
50904	50914	50916	50916	Mary	38	" I 'm sure you would n't mind him , "
50918	50927	50928	50928	he	81	" The birds do n't and other animals , "
50936	50959	50928	50928	he	81	" perhaps that 's why I should n't . He 's a sort of animal charmer and I am a boy animal . "
51139	51145	51146	51146	she	38	" It 's warm warm ! "
51149	51182	51146	51146	she	38	" It will make the green points push up and up and up , and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth . "
51229	51236	51237	51237	she	38	" It must be very early , "
51240	51272	51237	51237	she	38	" The little clouds are all pink and I 've never seen the sky look like this . No one is up . I do n't even hear the stable boys . "
51283	51297	51277	51277	her	38	" I ca n't wait ! I am going to see the garden ! "
51477	51484	51485	51485	she	38	" It is all different already , "
51488	51520	51485	51485	she	38	" The grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing . This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come . "
51795	51802	51803	51803	she	38	" Oh , Dickon ! Dickon ! "
51807	51828	51803	51803	she	38	" How could you get here so early ! How could you ! The sun has only just got up ! "
51850	51853	51854	51854	he	982	" Eh ! "
51857	52006	51854	51854	he	982	" I was up long before him . How could I have stayed abed ! Th ' world 's all fair begun again this mornin ' , it has . An ' it 's workin ' an ' hummin ' an ' scratchin ' an ' pipin ' an ' nest - buildin ' an ' breathin ' out scents , till you 've got to be out on it ' stead o ' lyin ' on your back . When th ' sun did jump up , th ' moor went mad for joy , an ' I was in the midst of th ' heather , an ' I run like mad myself , shoutin ' an ' singin ' . An ' I come straight here . I could n't have stayed away . Why , th ' garden was lyin ' here waitin ' ! "
52025	52032	52033	52033	she	38	" Oh , Dickon ! Dickon ! "
52036	52046	52033	52033	she	38	" I 'm so happy I can scarcely breathe ! "
52091	52100	52101	52101	he	986	" This is th ' little fox cub , "
52112	52158	52101	52101	he	986	" It 's named Captain . An ' this here 's Soot . Soot he flew across th ' moor with me an ' Captain he run same as if th ' hounds had been after him . They both felt same as I did . "
52195	52199	52201	52201	Dickon	54	" See here ! "
52203	52227	52201	52201	Dickon	54	" See how these has pushed up , an ' these an ' these ! An ' Eh ! Look at these here ! "
52269	52279	52280	52280	she	38	" You never kiss a person in that way , "
52288	52294	52280	52280	she	38	" Flowers are so different . "
52301	52304	52305	52305	he	54	" Eh ! "
52308	52354	52305	52305	he	54	" I 've kissed mother many a time that way when I come in from th ' moor after a day 's roamin ' an ' she stood there at th ' door in th ' sun , lookin ' so glad an ' comfortable . "
52547	52552	52553	52553	he	54	" We munnot stir , "
52559	52604	52553	52553	he	54	" We munnot scarce breathe . I knowed he was mate - huntin ' when I seed him last . It 's Ben Weatherstaff 's robin . He 's buildin ' his nest . He 'll stay here if us do n't fight him . "
52618	52633	52635	52635	Dickon	54	" Us must n't seem as if us was watchin ' him too close , "
52637	52754	52635	52635	Dickon	54	" He 'd be out with us for good if he got th ' notion us was interferin ' now . He 'll be a good bit different till all this is over . He 's settin ' up housekeepin ' . He 'll be shyer an ' readier to take things ill . He 's got no time for visitin ' an ' gossipin ' . Us must keep still a bit an ' try to look as if us was grass an ' trees an ' bushes . Then when he 's got used to seein ' us I 'll chirp a bit an ' he 'll know us'll not be in his way . "
52876	52893	52894	52894	he	54	" It 's part o ' th ' springtime , this nest - buildin ' is , "
52897	52958	52894	52894	he	54	" I warrant it 's been goin' on in th ' same way every year since th ' world was begun . They 've got their way o ' thinkin ' and doin' things an ' a body had better not meddle . You can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if you 're too curious . "
52959	52973	52974	52974	Mary	38	" If we talk about him I ca n't help looking at him , "
52981	52998	52974	52974	Mary	38	" We must talk of something else . There is something I want to tell you . "
52999	53013	53015	53015	Dickon	54	" He 'll like it better if us talks o ' somethin' else , "
53017	53028	53015	53015	Dickon	54	" What is it tha 's got to tell me ? "
53029	53037	53038	53038	she	38	" Well do you know about Colin ? "
53050	53059	53060	53060	he	54	" What does tha ' know about him ? "
53063	53100	53102	53102	Mary	38	" I 've seen him . I have been to talk to him every day this week . He wants me to come . He says I 'm making him forget about being ill and dying , "
53120	53128	53129	53129	he	54	" I am glad o ' that , "
53132	53163	53129	53129	he	54	" I 'm right down glad . It makes me easier . I knowed I must say nothin' about him an ' I do n't like havin' to hide things . "
53164	53173	53175	53175	Mary	38	" Do n't you like hiding the garden ? "
53177	53185	53186	53186	he	54	" I 'll never tell about it , "
53189	53250	53186	53186	he	54	" But I says to mother , ' Mother , ' I says , ' I got a secret to keep . It 's not a bad ' un , tha ' knows that . It 's no worse than hidin ' where a bird 's nest is . Tha ' does n't mind it , does tha ' ? ' "
53259	53265	53266	53266	she	38	" What did she say ? "
53282	53293	53294	53294	he	54	" It was just like her , what she said , "
53297	53341	53294	53294	he	54	" She give my head a bit of a rub an ' laughed an ' she says , ' Eh , lad , tha ' can have all th ' secrets tha ' likes . I 've knowed thee twelve year ' . ' "
53342	53350	53352	53352	Mary	38	" How did you know about Colin ? "
53354	53499	53502	53502	him	997	" Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple , an ' they knowed Mester Craven did n't like him to be talked about . Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs. Craven was such a pretty young lady an ' they was so fond of each other . Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an ' she does n't mind talkin ' to mother before us children , because she knows us has been brought up to be trusty . How did tha ' find out about him ? Martha was in fine trouble th ' last time she came home . She said tha'd heard him frettin ' an ' tha ' was askin ' questions an ' she did n't know what to say . "
53585	53605	53606	53606	he	54	" Them 's just like his mother 's eyes , only hers was always laughin ' , they say , "
53609	53652	53606	53606	he	54	" They say as Mr. Craven ca n't bear to see him when he 's awake an ' it 's because his eyes is so like his mother 's an ' yet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face . "
53653	53662	53664	53664	Mary	38	" Do you think he wants to die ? "
53666	53751	53606	53606	he	54	" No , but he wishes he 'd never been born . Mother she says that 's th ' worst thing on earth for a child . Them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives . Mester Craven he 'd buy anythin ' as money could buy for th ' poor lad but he 'd like to forget as he 's on earth . For one thing , he 's afraid he 'll look at him some day and find he 's growed hunchback . "
53752	53767	53769	53769	Mary	38	" Colin 's so afraid of it himself that he wo n't sit up , "
53771	53796	53769	53769	Mary	38	" He says he 's always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream himself to death . "
53797	53812	53814	53814	Dickon	54	" Eh ! he ought n't to lie there thinkin ' things like that , "
53816	53830	53814	53814	Dickon	54	" No lad could get well as thought them sort o ' things . "
53881	53889	53890	53890	he	54	" When first we got in here , "
53893	53916	53890	53890	he	54	" it seemed like everything was gray . Look round now and tell me if tha ' does n't see a difference . "
53926	53929	53930	53930	she	38	" Why ! "
53933	53961	53930	53930	she	38	" the gray wall is changing . It is as if a green mist were creeping over it . It 's almost like a green gauze veil . "
53962	53965	53967	53967	Dickon	54	" Aye , "
53969	53996	53967	53967	Dickon	54	" An ' it 'll be greener and greener till th ' gray 's all gone . Can tha ' guess what I was thinkin ' ? "
53997	54005	54007	54007	Mary	38	" I know it was something nice , "
54010	54019	54007	54007	Mary	38	" I believe it was something about Colin . "
54020	54069	54071	54071	Dickon	54	" I was thinkin ' that if he was out here he would n't be watchin ' for lumps to grow on his back ; he 'd be watchin ' for buds to break on th ' rose - bushes , an ' he 'd likely be healthier , "
54073	54103	54071	54071	Dickon	54	" I was wonderin ' if us could ever get him in th ' humor to come out here an ' lie under th ' trees in his carriage . "
54104	54126	54128	54128	Mary	38	" I 've been wondering that myself . I 've thought of it almost every time I 've talked to him , "
54130	54225	54128	54128	Mary	38	" I 've wondered if he could keep a secret and I 've wondered if we could bring him here without any one seeing us . I thought perhaps you could push his carriage . The doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobey him . He wo n't go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us . He could order the gardeners to keep away so they would n't find out . "
54238	54250	54251	54251	he	54	" It 'd be good for him , I 'll warrant , "
54254	54312	54251	54251	he	54	" Us'd not be thinkin ' he 'd better never been born . Us'd be just two children watchin ' a garden grow , an ' he 'd be another . Two lads an ' a little lass just lookin ' on at th ' springtime . I warrant it 'd be better than doctor 's stuff . "
54313	54340	54342	54342	Mary	38	" He 's been lying in his room so long and he 's always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer , "
54344	54414	54342	54342	Mary	38	" He knows a good many things out of books but he does n't know anything else . He says he has been too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates gardens and gardeners . But he likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret . I dare n't tell him much but he said he wanted to see it . "
54415	54425	54427	54427	Dickon	54	" Us'll have him out here sometime for sure , "
54429	54487	54427	54427	Dickon	54	" I could push his carriage well enough . Has tha ' noticed how th ' robin an ' his mate has been workin ' while we 've been sittin ' here ? Look at him perched on that branch wonderin ' where it 'd be best to put that twig he 's got in his beak . "
54532	54539	54540	54540	he	54	" Wheres'ever tha ' puts it , "
54543	54584	54540	54540	he	54	" it 'll be all right . Tha ' knew how to build tha ' nest before tha ' came out o ' th ' egg . Get on with thee , lad . Tha'st got no time to lose . "
54585	54598	54599	54599	Mary	38	" Oh , I do like to hear you talk to him ! "
54605	54656	54599	54599	Mary	38	" Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him , and he hops about and looks as if he understood every word , and I know he likes it . Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed . "
54665	54675	54676	54676	he	54	" Tha ' knows us wo n't trouble thee , "
54682	54713	54676	54676	he	54	" Us is near bein ' wild things ourselves . Us is nest - buildin ' too , bless thee . Look out tha ' does n't tell on us . "
54767	54771	54773	54773	MARY	38	" I WON'T ! "
54815	54828	54829	54829	she	38	" Tell Colin that I ca n't come and see him yet , "
54834	54843	54829	54829	she	38	" I 'm very busy in the garden . "
54849	54855	54856	54856	she	50	" Eh ! Miss Mary , "
54859	54874	54856	54856	she	50	" it may put him all out of humor when I tell him that . "
54897	54903	54904	54904	she	38	" I ca n't stay , "
54907	54914	54916	54916	she	38	" Dickon 's waiting for me ; "
54997	55001	55036	55036	his	54	" gardener 's garden "
55016	55028	55029	55029	Dickon	54	" There 'll be apple blossoms an ' cherry blossoms overhead , "
55039	55069	55036	55036	his	54	" An ' there 'll be peach an ' plum trees in bloom against th ' walls , an ' th ' grass'll be a carpet o ' flowers . "
55230	55242	55243	55243	Dickon	54	" Tha 's a good bit stronger than tha ' was , "
55254	55265	55243	55243	Dickon	54	" Tha 's beginning to look different , for sure . "
55275	55285	55286	55286	she	38	" I 'm getting fatter and fatter every day , "
55291	55319	55286	55286	she	38	" Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses . Martha says my hair is growing thicker . It is n't so flat and stringy . "
55341	55348	55350	55350	Dickon	54	" It 'll be fine tomorrow , "
55352	55361	55350	55350	Dickon	54	" I 'll be at work by sunrise . "
55362	55367	55369	55369	Mary	38	" So will I , "
55444	55450	55451	55451	she	38	" What is the matter ? "
55454	55468	55451	55451	she	38	" What did Colin say when you told him I could n't come ? "
55469	55472	55474	55474	Martha	50	" Eh ! "
55476	55517	55474	55474	Martha	50	" I wish tha'd gone . He was nigh goin' into one o ' his tantrums . There 's been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet . He would watch the clock all th ' time . "
55694	55702	55703	55703	she	38	" Why did n't you get up ? "
55706	55720	55721	55721	he	81	" I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming , "
55729	55759	55721	55721	he	81	" I made them put me back in bed this afternoon . My back ached and my head ached and I was tired . Why did n't you come ? "
55760	55770	55772	55772	Mary	38	" I was working in the garden with Dickon , "
55783	55807	55808	55808	he	81	" I wo n't let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of coming to talk to me , "
55842	55858	55859	55859	she	38	" If you send Dickon away , I 'll never come into this room again ! "
55862	55872	55874	55874	Colin	81	" You 'll have to if I want you , "
55876	55881	55883	55883	Mary	38	" I wo n't ! "
55885	55891	55893	55893	Colin	81	" I 'll make you , "
55895	55902	55893	55893	Colin	81	" They shall drag you in . "
55903	55910	55912	55912	Mary	38	" Shall they , Mr. Rajah ! "
55915	55963	55912	55912	Mary	38	" They may drag me in but they ca n't make me talk when they get me here . I 'll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing . I wo n't even look at you . I 'll stare at the floor ! "
56014	56021	56023	56023	Colin	81	" You are a selfish thing ! "
56025	56030	56032	56032	Mary	38	" What are you ? "
56034	56071	56032	56032	Mary	38	" Selfish people always say that . Any one is selfish who does n't do what they want . You 're more selfish than I am . You 're the most selfish boy I ever saw . "
56072	56077	56079	56079	Colin	81	" I 'm not ! "
56081	56117	56079	56079	Colin	81	" I 'm not as selfish as your fine Dickon is ! He keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself . He 's selfish , if you like ! "
56124	56136	56137	56137	she	38	" He 's nicer than any other boy that ever lived ! "
56140	56149	56137	56137	she	38	" He 's he 's like an angel ! "
56164	56169	56170	56170	Colin	81	" A nice angel ! "
56174	56185	56170	56170	Colin	81	" He 's a common cottage boy off the moor ! "
56186	56195	56197	56197	Mary	38	" He 's better than a common Rajah ! "
56199	56207	56197	56197	Mary	38	" He 's a thousand times better ! "
56307	56335	56336	56336	he	81	" I 'm not as selfish as you , because I 'm always ill , and I 'm sure there is a lump coming on my back , "
56339	56348	56336	56336	he	81	" And I am going to die besides . "
56349	56354	56356	56356	Mary	38	" You 're not ! "
56397	56402	56403	56403	he	81	" I 'm not ? "
56406	56419	56403	56403	he	81	" I am ! You know I am ! Everybody says so . "
56420	56427	56429	56429	Mary	38	" I do n't believe it ! "
56432	56472	56429	56429	Mary	38	" You just say that to make people sorry . I believe you 're proud of it . I do n't believe it ! If you were a nice boy it might be true but you 're too nasty ! "
56490	56497	56498	56498	he	81	" Get out of the room ! "
56541	56546	56547	56547	she	38	" I 'm going , "
56550	56558	56547	56547	she	38	" And I wo n't come back ! "
56576	56589	56590	56590	she	38	" I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things , "
56593	56622	56569	56569	she	38	" Dickon brought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all about them . Now I wo n't tell you a single thing ! "
56731	56738	56739	56739	she	38	" What are you laughing at ? "
56743	56750	56752	56753	the nurse	2532	" At you two young ones , "
56755	56785	56787	56787	she	2532	" It 's the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to him that 's as spoiled as himself ; "
56794	56817	56787	56787	she	2532	" If he 'd had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him . "
56818	56825	56752	56753	the nurse	2532	" Is he going to die ? "
56826	56837	56839	56840	the nurse	2532	" I do n't know and I do n't care , "
56842	56852	56839	56840	the nurse	2532	" Hysterics and temper are half what ails him . "
56853	56858	56860	56860	Mary	38	" What are hysterics ? "
56862	56897	56839	56840	the nurse	2532	" You 'll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this but at any rate you 've given him something to have hysterics about , and I 'm glad of it . "
57096	57104	57106	57106	Martha	50	" Mr. Craven sent it to you , "
57108	57121	57106	57106	Martha	50	" It looks as if it had picture - books in it . "
57138	57147	57125	57125	he	81	" Do you want anything dolls toys books ? "
57267	57277	57278	57278	she	38	" I can write better than I can print , "
57281	57304	57278	57278	she	38	" and the first thing I shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am much obliged . "
57501	57503	57505	57505	they	1054	" tantrums "
57528	57543	57544	57544	she	38	" He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired , "
57549	57568	57544	57544	she	38	" And he has been cross today . Perhaps perhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon . "
57581	57590	57591	57591	she	38	" I said I would never go back again "
57597	57636	57591	57591	she	38	" but perhaps , just perhaps , I will go and see if he wants me in the morning . Perhaps he 'll try to throw his pillow at me again , but I think I 'll go . "
57700	57723	57695	57695	she	38	" I 'll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward I believe I 'll go to see him . "
57801	57806	57807	57807	she	38	" It 's Colin , "
57810	57828	57807	57807	she	38	" He 's having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics . How awful it sounds . "
57872	57889	57890	57890	she	38	" I do n't know what to do . I do n't know what to do , "
57894	57901	57890	57890	she	38	" I ca n't bear it . "
58030	58050	58051	58051	she	38	" He ought to be stopped ! Somebody ought to make him stop ! Somebody ought to beat him ! "
58090	58098	58099	58099	she	2532	" He 's worked himself into hysterics , "
58106	58135	58099	58099	she	2532	" He 'll do himself harm . No one can do anything with him . You come and try , like a good child . He likes you . "
58136	58147	58149	58149	Mary	38	" He turned me out of the room this morning , "
58187	58192	58193	58193	she	2532	" That 's right , "
58196	58230	58193	58193	she	2532	" You 're in the right humor . You go and scold him . Give him something new to think of . Do go , child , as quick as ever you can . "
58333	58337	58338	58338	she	38	" You stop ! "
58342	58387	58338	58338	she	38	" You stop ! I hate you ! Everybody hates you ! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death ! You will scream yourself to death in a minute , and I wish you would ! "
58492	58499	58500	58500	she	38	" If you scream another scream , "
58503	58527	58500	58500	she	38	" I 'll scream too and I can scream louder than you can and I 'll frighten you , I 'll frighten you ! "
58563	58569	58570	58570	he	1070	" I ca n't stop ! "
58575	58583	58570	58570	he	1070	" I ca n't I ca n't ! "
58584	58588	58590	58590	Mary	38	" You can ! "
58592	58606	58608	58608	she	38	" Half that ails you is hysterics and temper just hysterics hysterics hysterics ! "
58616	58625	58628	58628	Colin	81	" I felt the lump I felt it , "
58630	58650	58628	58628	Colin	81	" I knew I should . I shall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die , "
58672	58680	58682	58682	Mary	38	" You did n't feel a lump ! "
58685	58722	58682	58682	Mary	38	" If you did it was only a hysterical lump . Hysterics makes lumps . There 's nothing the matter with your horrid back nothing but hysterics ! Turn over and let me look at it ! "
58727	58729	58723	58723	She	38	" hysterics "
58754	58757	58758	58758	she	38	" Nurse , "
58761	58772	58758	58758	she	38	" come here and show me his back this minute ! "
58826	58835	58836	58836	she	2532	" Perhaps he he wo n't let me , "
58857	58869	58850	58850	he	81	" Sh - show her ! She - she'll see then ! "
58983	58992	58993	58993	she	2532	" There 's not a single lump there ! "
58998	59084	58993	58993	she	2532	" There 's not a lump as big as a pin except backbone lumps , and you can only feel them because you 're thin . I 've got backbone lumps myself , and they used to stick out as much as yours do , until I began to get fatter , and I am not fat enough yet to hide them . There 's not a lump as big as a pin ! If you ever say there is again , I shall laugh ! "
59237	59243	59245	59246	the nurse	2532	" I did n't know , "
59248	59284	59245	59246	the nurse	2532	" that he thought he had a lump on his spine . His back is weak because he wo n't try to sit up . I could have told him there was no lump there . "
59298	59304	59305	59305	he	81	" C - could you ? "
59309	59314	59296	59296	her	2532	" Yes , sir . "
59315	59318	59320	59320	Mary	38	" There ! "
59413	59424	59425	59425	he	81	" Do you think I could live to grow up ? "
59449	59482	59438	59438	she	2532	" You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper , and stay out a great deal in the fresh air . "
59553	59565	59566	59566	he	81	" I 'll I 'll go out with you , Mary , "
59569	59580	59566	59566	he	81	" I sha n't hate fresh air if we can find "
59591	59599	59601	59601	he	81	" if we can find the secret garden "
59604	59636	59601	59601	he	81	" I shall like to go out with you if Dickon will come and push my chair . I do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the crow . "
59753	59764	59765	59765	she	38	" You must go back and get your sleep out , "
59768	59794	59765	59765	she	38	" He 'll drop off after a while if he 's not too upset . Then I 'll lie down myself in the next room . "
59795	59811	59812	59812	Mary	38	" Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah ? "
59832	59837	59838	59838	he	81	" Oh , yes ! "
59841	59858	59838	59838	he	81	" It 's such a soft song . I shall go to sleep in a minute . "
59859	59867	59868	59868	Mary	38	" I will put him to sleep , "
59875	59883	59868	59868	Mary	38	" You can go if you like . "
59884	59887	59889	59890	the nurse	2532	" Well , "
59898	59915	59889	59890	the nurse	2532	" If he does n't go to sleep in half an hour you must call me . "
59916	59920	59922	59922	Mary	38	" Very well , "
59948	59953	59954	59954	he	81	" I almost told , "
59957	60011	59954	59954	he	81	" but I stopped myself in time . I wo n't talk and I 'll go to sleep , but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me . Have you do you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret garden ? "
60028	60033	60034	60034	she	38	" Ye - es , "
60037	60056	60034	60034	she	38	" I think I have . And if you will go to sleep I will tell you tomorrow . "
60062	60067	60068	60068	he	81	" Oh , Mary ! "
60071	60132	60068	60068	he	81	" Oh , Mary ! If I could get into it I think I should live to grow up ! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah song you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside ? I am sure it will make me go to sleep . "
60133	60136	60138	60138	Mary	38	" Yes , "
60140	60145	60138	60138	Mary	38	" Shut your eyes . "
60172	60274	60155	60155	she	38	" I think it has been left alone so long that it has grown all into a lovely tangle . I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground almost like a strange gray mist . Some of them have died but many are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses . I think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark . Now the spring has begun perhaps perhaps "
60295	60366	60288	60288	she	38	" Perhaps they are coming up through the grass perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones even now . Perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl and perhaps the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping and creeping over everything . And the birds are coming to look at it because it is so safe and still . And perhaps perhaps perhaps "
60373	60386	60288	60288	she	38	" the robin has found a mate and is building a nest . "
60394	60401	60288	60288	she	38	" THA ' MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME "
60467	60487	60488	60488	Martha	50	" He says he wishes tha ' would please go and see him as soon as tha ' can , "
60491	60633	60488	60488	Martha	50	" It 's queer what a fancy he 's took to thee . Tha ' did give it him last night for sure did n't tha ? Nobody else would have dared to do it . Eh ! poor lad ! He 's been spoiled till salt wo n't save him . Mother says as th ' two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way or always to have it . She does n't know which is th ' worst . Tha ' was in a fine temper tha'self , too . But he says to me when I went into his room , ' Please ask Miss Mary if she 'll please come an ' talk to me ? ' Think o ' him saying please ! Will you go , Miss ? "
60634	60643	60645	60645	Mary	38	" I 'll run and see Dickon first , "
60647	60668	60645	60645	Mary	38	" No , I 'll go and see Colin first and tell him I know what I 'll tell him , "
60713	60720	60721	60721	he	81	" I 'm glad you came , "
60724	60744	60721	60721	he	81	" My head aches and I ache all over because I 'm so tired . Are you going somewhere ? "
60753	60760	60761	60761	she	38	" I wo n't be long , "
60764	60788	60761	60761	she	38	" I 'm going to Dickon , but I 'll come back . Colin , it 's it 's something about the garden . "
60801	60807	60808	60808	he	81	" Oh ! is it ? "
60812	60873	60808	60808	he	81	" I dreamed about it all night I heard you say something about gray changing into green , and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still . I 'll lie and think about it until you come back . "
60904	60915	60916	60916	he	54	" I came over on the pony this mornin ' , "
60919	60956	60916	60916	he	54	" Eh ! he is a good little chap Jump is ! I brought these two in my pockets . This here one he 's called Nut an ' this here other one 's called Shell . "
60960	60962	60958	60958	he	54	" Nut "
60975	60977	60973	60973	he	54	" Shell "
61077	61098	61099	61099	he	54	" Just listen to them birds th ' world seems full of 'em all whistlin ' an ' pipin ' , "
61102	61159	61099	61099	he	54	" Look at 'em dartin ' about , an ' hearken at 'em callin ' to each other . Come springtime seems like as if all th ' world 's callin ' . The leaves is uncurlin ' so you can see 'em an ' , my word , th ' nice smells there is about ! "
61169	61248	61162	61162	his	54	" An ' that poor lad lyin ' shut up an ' seein ' so little that he gets to thinkin ' o ' things as sets him screamin ' . Eh ! my ! we mun get him out here we mun get him watchin ' an listenin ' an ' sniffin ' up th ' air an ' get him just soaked through wi ' sunshine . An ' we munnot lose no time about it . "
61304	61311	61312	61312	she	38	" Aye , that we mun , "
61316	61323	61312	61312	she	38	" Yes , indeed , we must "
61325	61335	61336	61336	she	38	" I 'll tell thee what us'll do first , "
61362	61477	61358	61358	him	54	" He 's took a graidely fancy to thee . He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an ' Captain . When I go back to the house to talk to him I 'll ax him if tha ' canna ' come an ' see him tomorrow mornin ' an ' . bring tha ' creatures wi ' thee an ' then in a bit , when there 's more leaves out , an ' happen a bud or two , we 'll get him to come out an ' tha ' shall push him in his chair an ' we 'll bring him here an ' show him everything . "
61505	61521	61522	61522	Dickon	54	" Tha ' mun talk a bit o ' Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin , "
61525	61573	61522	61522	Dickon	54	" Tha'll make him laugh an ' there 's nowt as good for ill folk as laughin ' is . Mother says she believes as half a hour 's good laugh every mornin ' ' ud cure a chap as was makin ' ready for typhus fever . "
61574	61587	61589	61589	Mary	38	" I 'm going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day , "
61705	61715	61716	61716	he	81	" You smell like flowers and and fresh things , "
61722	61743	61716	61716	he	81	" What is it you smell of ? It 's cool and warm and sweet all at the same time . "
61744	61755	61757	61757	Mary	38	" It 's th ' wind from th ' moor , "
61759	61810	61757	61757	Mary	38	" It comes o ' sittin ' on th ' grass under a tree wi ' Dickon an ' wi ' Captain an ' Soot an ' Nut an ' Shell . It 's th ' springtime an ' out o ' doors an ' sunshine as smells so graidely . "
61843	61849	61850	61850	he	81	" What are you doing ? "
61853	61868	61850	61850	he	81	" I never heard you talk like that before . How funny it sounds . "
61869	61881	61883	61883	Mary	38	" I 'm givin ' thee a bit o ' Yorkshire , "
61886	61951	61883	61883	Mary	38	" I canna ' talk as graidely as Dickon an ' Martha can but tha ' sees I can shape a bit . Does n't tha ' understand a bit o ' Yorkshire when tha ' hears it ? An ' tha ' a Yorkshire lad thysel ' bred an ' born ! Eh ! I wonder tha'rt not ashamed o ' thy face . "
61995	62002	62003	62003	she	45	" Well , upon my word ! "
62025	62041	62020	62020	she	45	" Whoever heard th ' like ! Whoever on earth would ha ' thought it ! "
62217	62226	62227	62227	Colin	81	" Does he really understand everything Dickon says ? "
62230	62238	62240	62240	Mary	38	" It seems as if he does , "
62242	62266	62240	62240	Mary	38	" Dickon says anything will understand if you 're friends with it for sure , but you have to be friends for sure . "
62293	62302	62303	62303	he	81	" I wish I was friends with things , "
62308	62330	62303	62303	he	81	" but I 'm not . I never had anything to be friends with , and I ca n't bear people . "
62331	62338	62340	62340	Mary	38	" Ca n't you bear me ? "
62342	62348	62349	62349	he	81	" Yes , I can , "
62352	62362	62349	62349	he	81	" It 's funny but I even like you . "
62363	62372	62374	62374	Mary	38	" Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him , "
62376	62450	62374	62374	Mary	38	" He said he 'd warrant we 'd both got the same nasty tempers . I think you are like him too . We are all three alike you and I and Ben Weatherstaff . He said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked . But I do n't feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon . "
62451	62461	62349	62349	he	81	" Did you feel as if you hated people ? "
62462	62465	62467	62467	Mary	38	" Yes , "
62472	62491	62467	62467	Mary	38	" I should have detested you if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon . "
62502	62505	62506	62506	he	81	" Mary , "
62509	62546	62506	62506	he	81	" I wish I had n't said what I did about sending Dickon away . I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed at you but but perhaps he is . "
62547	62558	62559	62559	she	38	" Well , it was rather funny to say it , "
62563	62649	62559	62559	she	38	" because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire , but but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor if there was a Yorkshire angel I believe he 'd understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does and they 'd know he was friends for sure . "
62650	62660	62662	62662	Colin	81	" I should n't mind Dickon looking at me , "
62664	62671	62662	62662	Colin	81	" I want to see him . "
62672	62680	62682	62682	Mary	38	" I 'm glad you said that , "
62684	62687	62682	62682	Mary	38	" because because "
62711	62715	62716	62716	he	81	" Because what ? "
62743	62766	62767	62767	she	38	" Can I trust you ? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him . Can I trust you for sure for sure ? "
62782	62786	62770	62770	Her	38	" Yes yes ! "
62787	62808	62767	62767	she	38	" Well , Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning , and he 'll bring his creatures with him . "
62809	62814	62815	62815	Colin	81	" Oh ! Oh ! "
62821	62828	62829	62829	Mary	38	" But that 's not all , "
62839	62866	62829	62829	Mary	38	" The rest is better . There is a door into the garden . I found it . It is under the ivy on the wall . "
62880	62887	62875	62875	Colin	81	" Hooray ! Hooray ! Hooray ! "
62908	62913	62914	62914	he	81	" Oh ! Mary ! "
62922	62942	62944	62944	he	81	" Shall I see it ? Shall I get into it ? Shall I live to get into it ? "
62954	62962	62964	62964	Mary	38	" Of course you 'll see it ! "
62967	62983	62964	62964	Mary	38	" Of course you 'll live to get into it ! Do n't be silly ! "
63053	63064	63065	63065	he	81	" It is just what you thought it would be , "
63070	63093	63065	63065	he	81	" It sounds just as if you had really seen it . You know I said that when you told me first . "
63106	63117	63118	63118	she	38	" I had seen it and I had been in , "
63121	63154	63118	63118	she	38	" I found the key and got in weeks ago . But I dare n't tell you I dare n't because I was so afraid I could n't trust you for sure ! "
63157	63162	63118	63118	she	38	" IT HAS COME ! "
63255	63260	63261	63261	he	86	" How is he ? "
63271	63299	63263	63264	Mrs. Medlock	45	" He will break a blood - vessel in one of those fits some day . The boy is half insane with hysteria and self - indulgence . "
63300	63305	63307	63308	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Well , sir , "
63310	63429	63307	63308	Mrs. Medlock	45	" you 'll scarcely believe your eyes when you see him . That plain sour - faced child that 's almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him . How she 's done it there 's no telling . The Lord knows she 's nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak , but she did what none of us dare do . She just flew at him like a little cat last night , and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming , and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop , and this afternoon well just come up and see , sir . It 's past crediting . "
63515	63530	63531	63531	Colin	81	" Those long spires of blue ones we 'll have a lot of those , "
63535	63545	63531	63531	Colin	81	" They 're called Del - phin - iums . "
63546	63557	63559	63560	Mistress Mary	38	" Dickon says they 're larkspurs made big and grand , "
63562	63569	63559	63560	Mistress Mary	38	" There are clumps there already . "
63587	63602	63603	63604	Dr. Craven	86	" I am sorry to hear you were ill last night , my boy , "
63617	63625	63626	63626	Colin	81	" I 'm better now much better , "
63634	63658	63631	63632	a Rajah	90	" I 'm going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine . I want some fresh air . "
63675	63684	63685	63685	he	86	" It must be a very fine day , "
63688	63700	63685	63685	he	86	" and you must be very careful not to tire yourself . "
63701	63709	63711	63713	the young Rajah	1124	" Fresh air wo n't tire me , "
63758	63768	63769	63769	he	86	" I thought you did not like fresh air , "
63772	63782	63784	63785	the Rajah	90	" I do n't when I am by myself , "
63787	63797	63784	63785	the Rajah	90	" but my cousin is going out with me . "
63798	63806	63808	63809	Dr. Craven	86	" And the nurse , of course ? "
63811	63821	63808	63809	Dr. Craven	86	" No , I will not have the nurse , "
63873	63912	63857	63857	he	1127	" My cousin knows how to take care of me . I am always better when she is with me . She made me better last night . A very strong boy I know will push my carriage . "
63967	63979	63980	63980	he	86	" He must be a strong boy and a steady boy , "
63983	64001	63980	63980	he	86	" And I must know something about him . Who is he ? What is his name ? "
64002	64007	64008	64008	Mary	38	" It 's Dickon , "
64050	64055	64056	64056	he	86	" Oh , Dickon , "
64059	64082	64056	64056	he	86	" If it is Dickon you will be safe enough . He 's as strong as a moor pony , is Dickon . "
64083	64089	64091	64091	Mary	38	" And he 's trusty , "
64093	64104	64091	64091	Mary	38	" He 's th ' trustiest lad i ' Yorkshire . "
64117	64124	64126	64127	Dr. Craven	86	" Did Dickon teach you that ? "
64132	64143	64145	64145	Mary	38	" I 'm learning it as if it was French , "
64149	64175	64145	64145	Mary	38	" It 's like a native dialect in India . Very clever people try to learn them . I like it and so does Colin . "
64176	64181	64182	64182	he	81	" Well , well , "
64185	64209	64182	64182	he	81	" If it amuses you perhaps it wo n't do you any harm . Did you take your bromide last night , Colin ? "
64210	64213	64214	64214	Colin	81	" No , "
64217	64248	64214	64214	Colin	81	" I would n't take it at first and after Mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep in a low voice about the spring creeping into a garden . "
64249	64254	64256	64257	Dr. Craven	86	" That sounds soothing , "
64281	64291	64267	64268	Mistress Mary	38	" You are evidently better , but you must remember "
64292	64300	64302	64303	the Rajah	90	" I do n't want to remember , "
64308	64364	64366	64366	he	86	" When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so . If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it I would have him brought here . "
64386	64401	64366	64366	he	86	" It is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me better . "
64413	64415	64366	64366	he	86	" tantrum "
64483	64488	64489	64489	she	45	" Well , sir , "
64492	64499	64489	64489	she	45	" could you have believed it ? "
64500	64510	64512	64513	the doctor	2517	" It is certainly a new state of affairs , "
64515	64529	64512	64513	the doctor	2517	" And there 's no denying it is better than the old one . "
64530	64541	64543	64544	Mrs. Medlock	45	" I believe Susan Sowerby 's right I do that , "
64546	64621	64543	64544	Mrs. Medlock	45	" I stopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her . And she says to me , ' Well , Sarah Ann , she may n't be a good child , an ' she may n't be a pretty one , but she 's a child , an ' children needs children . ' We went to school together , Susan Sowerby and me . "
64622	64632	64634	64635	Dr. Craven	86	" She 's the best sick nurse I know , "
64637	64657	64634	64635	Dr. Craven	86	" When I find her in a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient . "
64669	64681	64682	64682	she	45	" She 's got a way with her , has Susan , "
64688	64732	64682	64682	she	45	" I 've been thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday . She says , ' Once when I was givin ' th ' children a bit of a preach after they 'd been fightin ' I ses to 'em all , "
64834	64889	64824	64824	you	1142	" ' What children learns from children , ' she says , ' is that there 's no sense in grabbin ' at th ' whole orange peel an ' all . If you do you 'll likely not get even th ' pips , an ' them 's too bitter to eat . ' "
64890	64897	64899	64900	Dr. Craven	86	" She 's a shrewd woman , "
64907	64919	64921	64922	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Well , she 's got a way of saying things , "
64927	64969	64921	64922	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Sometimes I 've said to her , ' Eh ! Susan , if you was a different woman an ' did n't talk such broad Yorkshire I 've seen the times when I should have said you was clever . ' "
65167	65186	65187	65187	he	81	" You 've been out ! You 've been out ! There 's that nice smell of leaves ! "
65220	65226	65227	65227	she	38	" It 's so beautiful ! "
65237	65280	65227	65227	she	38	" You never saw anything so beautiful ! It has come ! I thought it had come that other morning , but it was only coming . It is here now ! It has come , the Spring ! Dickon says so ! "
65281	65285	65287	65287	Colin	81	" Has it ? "
65310	65315	65316	65316	he	81	" Open the window ! "
65331	65339	65316	65316	he	81	" Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets ! "
65376	65382	65383	65383	she	38	" That 's fresh air , "
65386	65443	65383	65383	she	38	" Lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it . That 's what Dickon does when he 's lying on the moor . He says he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if he could live forever and ever . Breathe it and breathe it . "
65461	65476	65477	65477	he	81	" ' Forever and ever ' ! Does it make him feel like that ? "
65518	65528	65529	65529	she	38	" Things are crowding up out of the earth , "
65536	65638	65529	65529	she	38	" And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden . And the rose - bushes look as wick as wick can be , and there are primroses in the lanes and woods , and the seeds we planted are up , and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new - born lamb . "
65864	65876	65877	65877	she	2532	" Are you sure you are not chilly , Master Colin ? "
65880	65883	65825	65826	the nurse	2532	" No , "
65888	65923	65825	65826	the nurse	2532	" I am breathing long breaths of fresh air . It makes you strong . I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast . My cousin will have breakfast with me . "
65987	65998	65983	65984	the cook	1169	" had found his master , and good for him . "
66038	66044	66028	66028	his	1171	" for a good hiding . "
66076	66118	66119	66119	he	81	" A boy , and a fox , and a crow , and two squirrels , and a new - born lamb , are coming to see me this morning . I want them brought upstairs as soon as they come , "
66122	66147	66119	66119	he	81	" You are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants ' hall and keep them there . I want them here . "
66163	66168	66169	66169	she	2532	" Yes , sir , "
66172	66182	66184	66184	Colin	81	" I 'll tell you what you can do , "
66190	66218	66184	66184	Colin	81	" You can tell Martha to bring them here . The boy is Martha 's brother . His name is Dickon and he is an animal charmer . "
66219	66231	66233	66234	the nurse	2532	" I hope the animals wo n't bite , Master Colin , "
66236	66245	66247	66247	Colin	81	" I told you he was a charmer , "
66250	66257	66247	66247	Colin	81	" Charmers ' animals never bite . "
66258	66267	66269	66269	Mary	38	" There are snake - charmers in India , "
66271	66284	66269	66269	Mary	38	" And they can put their snakes ' heads in their mouths . "
66285	66288	66290	66291	the nurse	2532	" Goodness ! "
66322	66334	66335	66335	she	38	" You will begin to get fatter just as I did , "
66338	66356	66335	66335	she	38	" I never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it . "
66357	66364	66366	66366	Colin	81	" I wanted mine this morning , "
66368	66384	66366	66366	Colin	81	" Perhaps it was the fresh air . When do you think Dickon will come ? "
66402	66405	66406	66406	she	38	" Listen ! "
66409	66416	66406	66406	she	38	" Did you hear a caw ? "
66437	66442	66406	66406	she	38	" caw - caw . "
66443	66446	66447	66447	he	81	" Yes , "
66450	66455	66457	66457	Mary	38	" That 's Soot , "
66459	66472	66457	66457	Mary	38	" Listen again . Do you hear a bleat a tiny one ? "
66473	66478	66480	66480	Colin	81	" Oh , yes ! "
66485	66494	66496	66496	Mary	38	" That 's the new - born lamb , "
66498	66503	66496	66496	Mary	38	" He 's coming . "
66558	66565	66567	66567	Martha	50	" If you please , sir , "
66573	66588	66567	66567	Martha	50	" if you please , sir , here 's Dickon an ' his creatures . "
66871	66877	66879	66879	Colin	81	" What is it doing ? "
66881	66887	66879	66879	Colin	81	" What does it want ? "
66888	66894	66896	66896	Dickon	54	" It wants its mother , "
66903	66922	66896	66896	Dickon	54	" I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha'd like to see it feed . "
66939	66947	66948	66948	he	54	" Come on , little ' un , "
66963	66992	66994	66994	he	54	" This is what tha 's after . Tha'll get more out o ' this than tha ' will out o ' silk velvet coats . There now , "
67095	67276	67278	67278	he	1199	" I 'd almost lost him but for his song an ' I was wonderin ' how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he 'd get out o ' th ' world in a minute an ' just then I heard somethin' else far off among th ' gorse bushes . It was a weak bleatin ' an ' I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an ' I knowed it would n't be hungry if it had n't lost its mother somehow , so I set off searchin ' . Eh ! I did have a look for it . I went in an ' out among th ' gorse bushes an ' round an ' round an ' I always seemed to take th ' wrong turnin ' . But at last I seed a bit o ' white by a rock on top o ' th ' moor an ' I climbed up an ' found th ' little ' un half dead wi ' cold an ' clemmin ' . "
67366	67375	67376	67376	he	54	" I couldna ' say that there name , "
67386	67389	67376	67376	he	54	" Aquilegia , "
67390	67462	67376	67376	he	54	" but us calls that a columbine , an ' that there one it 's a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges , but these is garden ones an ' they 're bigger an ' grander . There 's some big clumps o ' columbine in th ' garden . They 'll look like a bed o ' blue an ' white butterflies flutterin ' when they 're out . "
67463	67471	67473	67473	Colin	81	" I 'm going to see them , "
67475	67483	67473	67473	Colin	81	" I am going to see them ! "
67484	67492	67494	67494	Mary	38	" Aye , that tha ' mun , "
67498	67510	67494	67494	Mary	38	" An ' tha ' munnot lose no time about it . "
67513	67523	67473	67473	Colin	81	" I SHALL LIVE FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER ! "
67685	67692	67694	67694	Dickon	54	" They 're same as us , "
67696	67722	67694	67694	Dickon	54	" only they have to build their homes every year . An ' it keeps 'em so busy they fair scuffle to get 'em done . "
67891	67896	67897	67899	the head gardener	1223	" bedding - out plants "
68049	68054	68055	68055	he	78	" Well , well , "
68066	68094	68055	68055	he	78	" what 's to do now ? His Royal Highness that was n't to be looked at calling up a man he 's never set eyes on . "
68168	68179	68185	68185	she	45	" Things are changing in this house , Mr. Roach , "
68204	68218	68219	68219	he	78	" Let 's hope they 're changing for the better , Mrs. Medlock , "
68222	68232	68233	68233	she	45	" They could n't well change for the worse , "
68236	68294	68233	68233	she	45	" and queer as it all is there 's them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under . Do n't you be surprised , Mr. Roach , if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby 's Dickon more at home than you or me could ever be . "
68322	68340	68341	68341	he	78	" He 'd be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine , "
68344	68363	68341	68341	he	78	" And yet it 's not impudence , either . He 's just fine , is that lad . "
68412	68415	68341	68341	he	78	" Caw Caw "
68511	68520	68522	68523	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Here is Mr. Roach , Master Colin , "
68545	68555	68556	68556	he	1223	" Oh , you are Roach , are you ? "
68559	68572	68556	68556	he	1223	" I sent for you to give you some very important orders . "
68573	68579	68581	68581	Roach	78	" Very good , sir , "
68608	68619	68621	68621	Colin	81	" I am going out in my chair this afternoon , "
68623	68691	68621	68621	Colin	81	" If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day . When I go , none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls . No one is to be there . I shall go out about two o'clock and everyone must keep away until I send word that they may go back to their work . "
68692	68698	68700	68701	Mr. Roach	78	" Very good , sir , "
68719	68722	68724	68724	Colin	81	" Mary , "
68730	68750	68724	68724	Colin	81	" what is that thing you say in India when you have finished talking and want people to go ? "
68751	68764	68766	68766	Mary	38	" You say , ' You have my permission to go , ' "
68774	68784	68785	68785	he	90	" You have my permission to go , Roach , "
68788	68798	68785	68785	he	90	" But , remember , this is very important . "
68799	68803	68805	68806	the crow	1249	" Caw Caw ! "
68812	68823	68825	68826	Mr. Roach	78	" Very good , sir . Thank you , sir , "
68858	68862	68863	68863	he	78	" My word ! "
68866	68898	68863	68863	he	78	" he 's got a fine lordly way with him , has n't he ? You 'd think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one Prince Consort and all . "
68900	68903	68905	68906	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Eh ! "
68908	68938	68905	68906	Mrs. Medlock	45	" we 've had to let him trample all over every one of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that 's what folks was born for . "
68939	68952	68954	68955	Mr. Roach	78	" Perhaps he 'll grow out of it , if he lives , "
68957	68967	68969	68970	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Well , there 's one thing pretty sure , "
68972	69019	68969	68970	Mrs. Medlock	45	" If he does live and that Indian child stays here I 'll warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not belong to him , as Susan Sowerby says . And he 'll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter . "
69031	69038	69039	69039	he	81	" It 's all safe now , "
69042	69058	69039	69039	he	81	" And this afternoon I shall see it this afternoon I shall be in it ! "
69109	69119	69120	69120	she	38	" What big eyes you 've got , Colin , "
69123	69142	69120	69120	she	38	" When you are thinking they get as big as saucers . What are you thinking about now ? "
69143	69156	69157	69157	he	81	" I ca n't help thinking about what it will look like , "
69160	69164	69166	69166	Mary	38	" The garden ? "
69168	69172	69173	69173	he	81	" The springtime , "
69176	69213	69173	69173	he	81	" I was thinking that I 've really never seen it before . I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at it . I did n't even think about it . "
69214	69227	69229	69229	Mary	38	" I never saw it in India because there was n't any , "
69266	69372	69246	69246	she	38	" That morning when you ran in and said ' It 's come ! It 's come ! ' , you made me feel quite queer . It sounded as if things were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music . I 've a picture like it in one of my books crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them , everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes . That was why I said , ' Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets ' and told you to throw open the window . "
69373	69377	69379	69379	Mary	38	" How funny ! "
69381	69437	69379	69379	Mary	38	" That 's really just what it feels like . And if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once , what a crowd it would be ! I 'm sure they 'd dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music . "
69504	69515	69516	69516	she	38	" This is one of his good days , sir , "
69529	69542	69516	69516	she	38	" He 's in such good spirits that it makes him stronger . "
69543	69560	69562	69563	Dr. Craven	86	" I 'll call in again later in the afternoon , after he has come in , "
69565	69580	69562	69563	Dr. Craven	86	" I must see how the going out agrees with him . I wish , "
69587	69597	69562	69563	Dr. Craven	86	" that he would let you go with him . "
69598	69620	69622	69623	the nurse	2532	" I 'd rather give up the case this moment , sir , than even stay here while it 's suggested , "
69629	69639	69641	69642	the doctor	2517	" I had n't really decided to suggest it , "
69649	69670	69645	69645	his	2517	" We 'll try the experiment . Dickon 's a lad I 'd trust with a new - born child . "
69715	69723	69724	69724	he	1264	" You have my permission to go , "
69851	69865	69866	69866	he	81	" There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out , "
69869	69880	69866	69866	he	81	" What is that scent the puffs of wind bring ? "
69881	69895	69897	69897	Dickon	54	" It 's gorse on th ' moor that 's openin ' out , "
69899	69911	69897	69897	Dickon	54	" Eh ! th ' bees are at it wonderful today . "
70011	70016	70018	70018	Mary	38	" This is it , "
70020	70036	70018	70018	Mary	38	" This is where I used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder . "
70037	70041	70043	70043	Colin	81	" Is it ? "
70057	70064	70065	70065	he	81	" But I can see nothing , "
70068	70074	70065	70065	he	81	" There is no door . "
70075	70082	70084	70084	Mary	38	" That 's what I thought , "
70099	70109	70111	70111	Mary	38	" That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works , "
70113	70117	70119	70119	Colin	81	" Is it ? "
70130	70141	70142	70142	she	38	" This is where the robin flew over the wall , "
70145	70149	70151	70151	Colin	81	" Is it ? "
70153	70163	70151	70151	Colin	81	" Oh ! I wish he 'd come again ! "
70164	70168	70170	70170	Mary	38	" And that , "
70182	70199	70170	70170	Mary	38	" is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key . "
70205	70212	70213	70213	he	81	" Where ? Where ? There ? "
70254	70258	70260	70260	Mary	38	" And this , "
70272	70303	70305	70305	she	38	" is where I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the wall . And this is the ivy the wind blew back , "
70314	70322	70324	70324	Colin	81	" Oh ! is it is it ! "
70326	70348	70324	70324	Colin	81	" And here is the handle , and here is the door . Dickon push him in push him in quickly ! "
70570	70581	70582	70582	he	81	" I shall get well ! I shall get well ! "
70586	70606	70582	70582	he	81	" Mary ! Dickon ! I shall get well ! And I shall live forever and ever and ever ! "
70929	70936	70937	70937	he	54	" Eh ! it is graidely , "
70940	70976	70937	70937	he	54	" I 'm twelve goin' on thirteen an ' there 's a lot o ' afternoons in thirteen years , but seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this ' ere . "
70977	70986	70988	70988	Mary	38	" Aye , it is a graidely one , "
70997	71013	70991	70991	she	38	" I 'll warrant it 's the graidelest one as ever was in this world . "
71014	71020	71022	71022	Colin	81	" Does tha ' think , "
71027	71044	71022	71022	Colin	81	" as happen it was made loike this ' ere all o ' purpose for me ? "
71045	71049	71051	71051	Mary	38	" My word ! "
71054	71076	71051	71051	Mary	38	" that there is a bit o ' good Yorkshire . Tha'rt shapin ' first - rate that tha ' art . "
71281	71291	71293	71293	Colin	81	" I wonder if we shall see the robin ? "
71295	71305	71307	71307	Dickon	54	" Tha'll see him often enow after a bit , "
71309	71461	71307	71307	Dickon	54	" When th ' eggs hatches out th ' little chap he 'll be kep ' so busy it 'll make his head swim . Tha'll see him flyin ' backward an ' for'ard carryin ' worms nigh as big as himsel ' an ' that much noise goin' on in th ' nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th ' first piece in . An ' gapin ' beaks an ' squawks on every side . Mother says as when she sees th ' work a robin has to keep them gapin ' beaks filled , she feels like she was a lady with nothin' to do . She says she 's seen th ' little chaps when it seemed like th ' sweat must be droppin ' off 'em , though folk ca n't see it . "
71591	71605	71606	71606	he	54	" That 's a very old tree over there , is n't it ? "
71629	71632	71634	71634	Dickon	54	" Yes , "
71657	71672	71673	71673	Colin	81	" The branches are quite gray and there 's not a single leaf anywhere , "
71677	71687	71673	71673	Colin	81	" It 's quite dead , is n't it ? "
71688	71691	71693	71693	Dickon	54	" Aye , "
71695	71743	71693	71693	Dickon	54	" But them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o ' th ' dead wood when they 're full o ' leaves an ' flowers . It wo n't look dead then . It 'll be th ' prettiest of all . "
71753	71766	71768	71768	Colin	81	" It looks as if a big branch had been broken off , "
71770	71778	71768	71768	Colin	81	" I wonder how it was done . "
71779	71788	71790	71790	Dickon	54	" It 's been done many a year , "
71792	71795	71803	71803	his	54	" Eh ! "
71808	71827	71803	71803	his	54	" Look at that robin ! There he is ! He 's been foragin ' for his mate . "
71884	71908	71872	71872	Colin	81	" He 's taking her tea to her . Perhaps it 's five o'clock . I think I 'd like some tea myself . "
71915	71924	71926	71926	Mary	38	" It was Magic which sent the robin , "
71932	71939	71926	71926	Mary	38	" I know it was Magic . "
71983	72000	72001	72001	he	54	" We mun look as if it was n't no different from th ' other trees , "
72005	72034	72001	72001	he	54	" We could n't never tell him how it broke , poor lad . If he says anything about it we mun we mun try to look cheerful . "
72035	72042	72045	72045	Mary	38	" Aye , that we mun , "
72114	72124	72125	72125	he	54	" Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady , "
72132	72205	72125	72125	he	54	" An ' mother she thinks maybe she 's about Misselthwaite many a time lookin ' after Mester Colin , same as all mothers do when they 're took out o ' th ' world . They have to come back , tha ' sees . Happen she 's been in the garden an ' happen it was her set us to work , an ' told us to bring him here . "
72411	72430	72431	72431	he	81	" Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk , "
72434	72445	72431	72431	he	81	" And then you and Dickon can bring it here . "
72638	72648	72649	72649	he	81	" I do n't want this afternoon to go , "
72652	72675	72649	72649	he	81	" but I shall come back tomorrow , and the day after , and the day after , and the day after . "
72676	72689	72691	72691	Mary	38	" You 'll get plenty of fresh air , wo n't you ? "
72693	72702	72703	72703	he	81	" I 'm going to get nothing else , "
72706	72739	72691	72691	Mary	38	" I 've seen the spring now and I 'm going to see the summer . I 'm going to see everything grow here . I 'm going to grow here myself . "
72740	72746	72748	72748	Dickon	54	" That tha ' will , "
72750	72769	72748	72748	Dickon	54	" Us'll have thee walkin ' about here an ' diggin ' same as other folk afore long . "

72825	72841	72821	72821	he	81	" Tha tha 's got legs o ' thine own , same as other folks ! "
72853	72859	72860	72860	he	81	" Nothing really ails them , "
72863	72886	72860	72860	he	81	" but they are so thin and weak . They shake so that I 'm afraid to try to stand on them . "
72896	72909	72910	72910	Dickon	54	" When tha ' stops bein ' afraid tha'lt stand on 'em , "

76299	76347	76296	76296	he	57	" that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow . Tha'rt a Yorkshire lad for sure . An ' tha'rt diggin ' , too . How 'd tha ' like to plant a bit o ' somethin' ? I can get thee a rose in a pot . "
76348	76354	76356	76356	Colin	81	" Go and get it ! "
76361	76366	76356	76356	Colin	81	" Quick ! Quick ! "
76456	76470	76471	76471	he	81	" I want to do it before the sun goes quite quite down , "
76535	76540	76541	76541	he	57	" Here , lad , "
76550	76572	76541	76541	he	57	" Set it in the earth thysel ' same as th ' king does when he goes to a new place . "
76652	76657	76659	76659	Colin	81	" It 's planted ! "
76663	76696	76659	76659	Colin	81	" And the sun is only slipping over the edge . Help me up , Dickon . I want to be standing when it goes . That 's part of the Magic . "
76798	76807	76808	76808	he	1345	" You should not have stayed so long , "
76811	76818	76808	76808	he	1345	" You must not overexert yourself . "
76819	76827	76829	76829	Colin	81	" I am not tired at all , "
76831	76853	76829	76829	Colin	81	" It has made me well . Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon . "
76854	76865	76867	76868	Dr. Craven	86	" I am not sure that I can allow it , "
76870	76880	76867	76868	Dr. Craven	86	" I am afraid it would not be wise . "
76881	76893	76895	76895	Colin	81	" It would not be wise to try to stop me , "
76899	76904	76895	76895	Colin	81	" I am going . "
77064	77073	77074	77074	he	81	" What are you looking at me for ? "
77077	77090	77046	77046	She	38	" I 'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven . "
77091	77096	77098	77098	Colin	81	" So am I , "
77110	77126	77098	77098	Colin	81	" He wo n't get Misselthwaite at all now I 'm not going to die . "
77127	77140	77142	77142	Mary	38	" I 'm sorry for him because of that , of course , "
77144	77182	77142	77142	Mary	38	" but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude . I would never have done it . "
77183	77188	77189	77189	Colin	81	" Am I rude ? "
77193	77211	77213	77213	Mary	38	" If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man , "
77215	77222	77213	77213	Mary	38	" he would have slapped you . "
77223	77229	77231	77231	Colin	81	" But he dare n't , "
77233	77240	77242	77243	Mistress Mary	38	" No , he dare n't , "
77253	77282	77242	77243	Mistress Mary	38	" Nobody ever dared to do anything you did n't like because you were going to die and things like that . You were such a poor thing . "
77283	77286	77288	77288	Colin	81	" But , "
77291	77320	77288	77288	Colin	81	" I am not going to be a poor thing . I wo n't let people think I 'm one . I stood on my feet this afternoon . "
77321	77336	77337	77337	Mary	38	" It is always having your own way that has made you so queer , "
77351	77356	77357	77357	he	81	" Am I queer ? "
77360	77363	77365	77365	Mary	38	" Yes , "
77367	77377	77378	77378	she	38	" very . But you need n't be cross , "
77382	77416	77378	77378	she	38	" because so am I queer and so is Ben Weatherstaff . But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I found the garden . "
77417	77426	77428	77428	Colin	81	" I do n't want to be queer , "
77430	77438	77428	77428	Colin	81	" I am not going to be , "
77474	77481	77482	77482	he	81	" I shall stop being queer , "
77485	77514	77482	77482	he	81	" if I go every day to the garden . There is Magic in there good Magic , you know , Mary . I am sure there is . "
77515	77520	77522	77522	Mary	38	" So am I , "
77524	77533	77534	77534	Colin	81	" Even if it is n't real Magic , "
77537	77549	77534	77534	Colin	81	" we can pretend it is . Something is there something ! "
77550	77555	77557	77557	Mary	38	" It 's Magic , "
77559	77571	77557	77557	Mary	38	" but not black . It 's as white as snow . "
77799	77810	77811	77812	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" She was main fond o ' them she was , "
77815	77872	77811	77812	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" She liked them things as was allus pointin ' up to th ' blue sky , she used to tell . Not as she was one o ' them as looked down on th ' earth not her . She just loved it but she said as th ' blue sky allus looked so joyful . "
78069	78074	78075	78075	he	81	" watching things growing , "
78321	78334	78335	78335	he	81	" Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world , "
78341	78384	78335	78335	he	81	" but people do n't know what it is like or how to make it . Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen . I am going to try and experiment . "
78431	78438	78439	78439	he	81	" Good morning , Ben Weatherstaff , "
78442	78471	78439	78439	he	81	" I want you and Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell you something very important . "
78472	78479	78481	78482	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Aye , aye , sir ! "
78522	78532	78534	78535	the Rajah	90	" I am going to try a scientific experiment , "
78537	78561	78534	78535	the Rajah	90	" When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment . "
78562	78569	78571	78572	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Aye , aye , sir ! "
78701	78712	78713	78713	he	57	" The great scientific discoveries I am going to make , "
78717	78849	78713	78713	he	57	" will be about Magic . Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knows anything about it except a few people in old books and Mary a little , because she was born in India where there are fakirs . I believe Dickon knows some Magic , but perhaps he does n't know he knows it . He charms animals and people . I would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an animal charmer which is a boy charmer , too , because a boy is an animal . I am sure there is Magic in everything , only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us like electricity and horses and steam . "
78867	78874	78875	78875	he	57	" Aye , aye , sir , "
78886	78897	78898	78899	the orator	1375	" When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead , "
78902	79345	78898	78899	the orator	1375	" Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing . One day things were n't there and another they were . I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious . Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific . I keep saying to myself , ' What is it ? What is it ? ' It 's something . It ca n't be nothing ! I do n't know its name so I call it Magic . I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too . Something pushes it up and draws it . Sometimes since I 've been in the garden I 've looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast . Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing . Everything is made out of Magic , leaves and trees , flowers and birds , badgers and foxes and squirrels and people . So it must be all around us . In this garden in all the places . The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man . I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong . I do n't know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come . Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it . When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could , ' You can do it ! You can do it ! ' and I did . I had to try myself at the same time , of course , but her Magic helped me and so did Dickon 's . Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say , ' Magic is in me ! Magic is making me well ! I am going to be as strong as Dickon , as strong as Dickon ! ' And you must all do it , too . That is my experiment Will you help , Ben Weatherstaff ? "
79346	79353	79355	79356	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Aye , aye , sir ! "
79358	79363	79355	79356	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Aye , aye ! "
79364	79452	78898	78899	the orator	1375	" If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds . You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be the same with Magic . If you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things . "
79453	79478	79480	79480	Mary	38	" I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times , "
79482	79507	79509	79510	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" I 've heard Jem Fettleworth 's wife say th ' same thing over thousands o ' times callin ' Jem a drunken brute , "
79513	79548	79509	79510	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Summat allus come o ' that , sure enough . He gave her a good hidin ' an ' went to th ' Blue Lion an ' got as drunk as a lord . "
79565	79568	79569	79569	he	81	" Well , "
79572	79628	79569	79569	he	81	" you see something did come of it . She used the wrong Magic until she made him beat her . If she 'd used the right Magic and had said something nice perhaps he would n't have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet . "
79643	79660	79661	79661	he	57	" Tha'rt a clever lad as well as a straight - legged one , Mester Colin , "
79664	79710	79661	79661	he	57	" Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I 'll give her a bit of a hint o ' what Magic will do for her . She 'd be rare an ' pleased if th ' sinetifik ' speriment worked an ' so ' ud Jem . "
79764	79773	79774	79774	Colin	81	" Do you think the experiment will work ? "
79804	79806	79817	79817	his	54	" creatures "
79824	79827	79828	79828	he	54	" Aye , "
79831	79865	79828	79828	he	54	" that I do . It 'll work same as th ' seeds do when th ' sun shines on 'em . It 'll work for sure . Shall us begin it now ? "
79901	79913	79915	79915	Colin	81	" It will be like sitting in a sort of temple , "
79917	79929	79915	79915	Colin	81	" I 'm rather tired and I want to sit down . "
79930	79933	79935	79935	Dickon	54	" Eh ! "
79937	79957	79935	79935	Dickon	54	" tha ' must n't begin by sayin ' tha'rt tired . Tha ' might spoil th ' Magic . "
79970	79975	79976	79976	he	81	" That 's true , "
79980	79989	79976	79976	he	81	" I must only think of the Magic . "
80033	80040	80031	80031	he	57	" agen ' prayer - meetin 's "
80141	80149	80151	80151	Colin	81	" The ' creatures ' have come , "
80154	80161	80151	80151	Colin	81	" They want to help us . "
80206	80212	80213	80213	he	81	" Now we will begin , "
80216	80232	80213	80213	he	81	" Shall we sway backward and forward , Mary , as if we were dervishes ? "
80233	80245	80247	80248	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" I canna ' do no swayin ' back'ard and for'ard , "
80250	80258	80247	80248	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" I 've got th ' rheumatics . "
80259	80267	80269	80269	Colin	81	" The Magic will take them away , "
80276	80293	80269	80269	Colin	81	" but we wo n't sway until it has done it . We will only chant . "
80294	80302	80304	80305	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" I canna ' do no chantin ' "
80310	80330	80304	80305	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" They turned me out o ' th ' church choir th ' only time I ever tried it . "
80362	80368	80369	80369	he	81	" Then I will chant , "
80383	80467	80373	80373	he	81	" The sun is shining the sun is shining . That is the Magic . The flowers are growing the roots are stirring . That is the Magic . Being alive is the Magic being strong is the Magic . The Magic is in me the Magic is in me . It is in me it is in me . It 's in every one of us . It 's in Ben Weatherstaff 's back . Magic ! Magic ! Come and help ! "
80596	80607	80608	80608	he	81	" Now I am going to walk round the garden , "
80627	80633	80635	80635	Colin	81	" You have been asleep , "
80637	80645	80647	80647	Ben	57	" Nowt o ' th ' sort , "
80649	80668	80647	80647	Ben	57	" Th ' sermon was good enow but I 'm bound to get out afore th ' collection . "
80676	80683	80685	80685	Colin	81	" You 're not in church , "
80687	80691	80693	80693	Ben	57	" Not me , "
80698	80728	80696	80696	himself	57	" Who said I were ? I heard every bit of it . You said th ' Magic was in my back . Th ' doctor calls it rheumatics . "
80735	80742	80743	80743	he	90	" That was the wrong Magic , "
80746	80767	80743	80743	he	90	" You will get better . You have my permission to go to your work . But come back tomorrow . "
80768	80780	80782	80782	Ben	57	" I 'd like to see thee walk round the garden , "
80895	80897	80888	80889	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" creatures "
81003	81010	81011	81011	he	57	" The Magic is in me ! "
81015	81033	81011	81011	he	57	" The Magic is making me strong ! I can feel it ! I can feel it ! "
81109	81118	81119	81119	he	57	" I did it ! The Magic worked ! "
81122	81130	81119	81119	he	57	" That is my first scientific discovery . "
81132	81139	81142	81142	Mary	38	" What will Dr. Craven say ? "
81144	81151	81152	81152	Colin	81	" He wo n't say anything , "
81155	81294	81152	81152	Colin	81	" because he will not be told . This is to be the biggest secret of all . No one is to know anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any other boy . I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in it . I wo n't have people whispering and asking questions and I wo n't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded . Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his study and say ' Here I am ; I am like any other boy . I am quite well and I shall live to be a man . It has been done by a scientific experiment . ' "
81295	81305	81307	81307	Mary	38	" He will think he is in a dream , "
81309	81317	81307	81307	Mary	38	" He wo n't believe his eyes . "
81423	81432	81433	81433	he	81	" He 'll be obliged to believe them , "
81436	81466	81433	81433	he	81	" One of the things I am going to do , after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries , is to be an athlete . "
81467	81483	81485	81486	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" We shall have thee takin ' to boxin ' in a week or so , "
81488	81510	81485	81486	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Tha'lt end wi ' winnin ' th ' Belt an ' bein ' champion prize - fighter of all England . "
81519	81522	81523	81523	he	81	" Weatherstaff , "
81526	81564	81523	81523	he	81	" that is disrespectful . You must not take liberties because you are in the secret . However much the Magic works I shall not be a prize - fighter . I shall be a Scientific Discoverer . "
81565	81572	81574	81574	Ben	57	" Ax pardon ax pardon , sir "
81582	81596	81574	81574	Ben	57	" I ought to have seed it was n't a jokin ' matter , "

They want to live same as we do . If they died I should feel as if I 'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless . "

82373	82397	82398	82398	she	80	" What do they make of it at th ' Manor him being so well an ' cheerful an ' never complainin ' ? "

82484	82608	82481	82481	Dickon	54	" He does it to keep them from guessin ' what 's happened . If the doctor knew he 'd found out he could stand on his feet he 'd likely write and tell Mester Craven . Mester Colin 's savin ' th ' secret to tell himself . He 's goin' to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father comes back an ' then he 's goin' to march into his room an ' show him he 's as straight as other lads .

82723	82905	82720	82720	he	54	" An ' he flies out at John , th ' footman , for not carryin ' him careful enough . He makes himself as helpless lookin ' as he can an ' never lifts his head until we 're out o ' sight o ' th ' house . An ' he grunts an ' frets a good bit when he 's bein ' settled into his chair . Him an ' Miss Mary 's both got to enjoyin ' it an ' when he groans an ' complains she 'll say , ' Poor Colin ! Does it hurt you so much ? Are you so weak as that , poor Colin ? ' but th ' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin ' out laughin ' . When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they 've no breath left to laugh with . An ' they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin 's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin ' , if any of , 'em 's about . "
82906	82918	82920	82921	Mrs. Sowerby	80	" Th ' more they laugh th ' better for 'em ! "
82927	82951	82920	82921	Mrs. Sowerby	80	" Good healthy child laughin 's better than pills any day o ' th ' year . That pair'll plump up for sure . "
82952	82959	82961	82961	Dickon	54	" They are plumpin ' up , "
82963	83038	82961	82961	Dickon	54	" They 're that hungry they do n't know how to get enough to eat without makin ' talk . Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin ' for more food they wo n't believe he 's an invalid at all . Miss Mary says she 'll let him eat her share , but he says that if she goes hungry she 'll get thin an ' they mun both get fat at once . "
83068	83077	83078	83079	Mrs. Sowerby	80	" I 'll tell thee what , lad , "
83086	83190	83078	83079	Mrs. Sowerby	80	" I 've thought of a way to help 'em . When tha ' goes to 'em in th ' mornin 's tha ' shall take a pail o ' good new milk an ' I 'll bake 'em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi ' currants in 'em , same as you children like . Nothin 's so good as fresh milk an ' bread . Then they could take off th ' edge o ' their hunger while they were in their garden an ' th , fine food they get indoors ' ud polish off th ' corners . "
83191	83196	83198	83198	Dickon	54	" Eh ! mother ! "
83201	83249	83198	83198	Dickon	54	" what a wonder tha ' art ! Tha ' always sees a way out o ' things . They was quite in a pother yesterday . They did n't see how they was to manage without orderin ' up more food they felt that empty inside . "
83250	83291	83293	83294	Mrs. Sowerby	80	" They 're two young ' uns growin ' fast , an ' health 's comin ' back to both of 'em . Children like that feels like young wolves an ' food 's flesh an ' blood to 'em , "
83305	83317	83318	83318	she	80	" Eh ! but they 're enjoyin ' theirselves for sure , "
83343	83347	83340	83340	she	80	" play actin ' "
83392	83404	83405	83406	the nurse	2532	" Your appetite . Is improving very much , Master Colin , "
83412	83427	83405	83406	the nurse	2532	" You used to eat nothing , and so many things disagreed with you . "
83428	83434	83436	83436	Colin	81	" Nothing disagrees with me now "
83462	83480	83452	83452	he	81	" At least things do n't so often disagree with me . It 's the fresh air . "
83481	83486	83488	83489	the nurse	2532	" Perhaps it is , "
83500	83511	83488	83489	the nurse	2532	" But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it . "
83512	83519	83521	83521	Mary	38	" How she stared at you ! "
83527	83540	83521	83521	Mary	38	" As if she thought there must be something to find out . "
83541	83551	83553	83553	Colin	81	" I wo n't have her finding out things , "
83555	83565	83553	83553	Colin	81	" No one must begin to find out yet . "
83591	83602	83603	83603	he	86	" You stay out in the garden a great deal , "
83606	83612	83603	83603	he	86	" Where do you go ? "
83625	83637	83638	83638	he	81	" I will not let any one know where I go , "
83641	83674	83638	83638	he	81	" I go to a place I like . Every one has orders to keep out of the way . I wo n't be watched and stared at . You know that ! "
83675	83714	83603	83603	he	86	" You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm I do not think so . The nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before . "
83715	83718	83720	83720	Colin	81	" Perhaps , "
83728	83736	83720	83720	Colin	81	" perhaps it is an unnatural appetite . "
83737	83753	83755	83756	Dr. Craven	86	" I do not think so , as your food seems to agree with you , "
83758	83770	83755	83756	Dr. Craven	86	" You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better . "
83771	83780	83782	83782	Colin	81	" Perhaps perhaps I am bloated and feverish , "
83791	83803	83782	83782	Colin	81	" People who are not going to live are often different . "
83827	83833	83834	83834	he	86	" You are not feverish , "
83838	83878	83834	83834	he	86	" and such flesh as you have gained is healthy . If you can keep this up , my boy , we need not talk of dying . Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement . "
83879	83887	83888	83888	Colin	81	" I wo n't have him told ! "
83893	83986	83888	83888	Colin	81	" It will only disappoint him if I get worse again and I may get worse this very night . I might have a raging fever . I feel as if I might be beginning to have one now . I wo n't have letters written to my father I wo n't I wo n't ! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me . I feel hot already . I hate being written about and being talked over as much as I hate being stared at ! "
83987	83995	83996	83997	Dr. Craven	86	" Hush - h ! my boy , "
84001	84028	83996	83997	Dr. Craven	86	" Nothing shall be written without your permission . You are too sensitive about things . You must not undo the good which has been done . "
84060	84067	84068	84068	he	1418	" The boy is extraordinarily better , "
84071	84115	84068	84068	he	1418	" His advance seems almost abnormal . But of course he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before . Still , he excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him . "
84134	84139	84068	84068	he	1418	" play actin ' . "
84140	84150	84152	84152	Colin	81	" I may be obliged to have a tantrum , "
84155	84224	84152	84152	Colin	81	" I do n't want to have one and I 'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one . Perhaps I could n't have one at all . That lump does n't come in my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones . But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do something . "
84329	84344	84345	84345	Colin	81	" I think we shall have to eat it all this morning , Mary , "
84351	84368	84345	84345	Colin	81	" We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner . "
84395	84400	84401	84401	Colin	81	" I do wish , "
84406	84428	84401	84401	Colin	81	" I do wish the slices of ham were thicker , and one muffin each is not enough for any one . "
84429	84442	84444	84444	Mary	38	" It 's enough for a person who is going to die , "
84451	84494	84444	84444	Mary	38	" but it 's not enough for a person who is going to live . I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window . "
84612	84624	84626	84626	Colin	81	" Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon , "
84628	84657	84626	84626	Colin	81	" It makes her think of ways to do things nice things . She is a Magic person . Tell her we are grateful , Dickon extremely grateful . "
84686	84700	84675	84675	He	81	" Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme . "
85033	85036	85037	85037	he	54	" Yesterday , "
85045	85362	85037	85037	he	54	" I went to Thwaite for mother an ' near th ' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth . He 's the strongest chap on th ' moor . He 's the champion wrestler an ' he can jump higher than any other chap an ' throw th ' hammer farther . He 's gone all th ' way to Scotland for th ' sports some years . He 's knowed me ever since I was a little ' un an ' he 's a friendly sort an ' I axed him some questions . Th ' gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o ' thee , Mester Colin , and I says , ' How did tha ' make tha ' muscles stick out that way , Bob ? Did tha ' do anythin ' extra to make thysel ' so strong ? ' An ' he says ' Well , yes , lad , I did . A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an ' legs an ' every muscle in my body . An ' I says , ' Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em , Bob ? ' an ' he laughed an ' says , ' Art tha ' th ' delicate chap ? ' an ' I says , ' No , but I knows a young gentleman that 's gettin ' well of a long illness an ' I wish I knowed some o ' them tricks to tell him about . ' I did n't say no names an ' he did n't ask none . He 's friendly same as I said an ' he stood up an ' showed me good - natured like , an ' I imitated what he did till I knowed it by heart . "
85369	85375	85376	85376	he	81	" Can you show me ? "
85379	85383	85376	85376	he	81	" Will you ? "
85384	85391	85392	85392	Dickon	54	" Aye , to be sure , "
85398	85435	85392	85392	Dickon	54	" But he says tha ' mun do 'em gentle at first an ' be careful not to tire thysel ' . Rest in between times an ' take deep breaths an ' do n't overdo . "
85436	85442	85444	85444	Colin	81	" I 'll be careful , "
85446	85465	85444	85444	Colin	81	" Show me ! Show me ! Dickon , you are the most Magic boy in the world ! "
85686	85694	85696	85697	the nurse	2532	" They are eating next to nothing , "
85699	85723	85696	85697	the nurse	2532	" They 'll die of starvation if they ca n't be persuaded to take some nourishment . And yet see how they look . "
85724	85727	85729	85730	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Look ! "
85733	85827	85729	85730	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Eh ! I 'm moithered to death with them . They 're a pair of young Satans . Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with . Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them and back it 's sent . She almost cried . She 's afraid she 'll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves . "
86021	86034	86035	86035	he	86	" I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything , "
86038	86066	86035	86035	he	86	" That will not do . You will lose all you have gained and you have gained amazingly . You ate so well a short time ago . "
86067	86077	86079	86079	Colin	81	" I told you it was an unnatural appetite , "
86110	86116	86118	86119	Dr. Craven	86	" What is the matter ? "
86135	86146	86147	86147	she	38	" It was something between a sneeze and a cough , "
86153	86161	86147	86147	she	38	" and it got into my throat . "
86162	86165	86166	86166	she	38	" But , "
86172	86220	86166	86166	she	38	" I could n't stop myself . It just burst out because all at once I could n't help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it . "
86221	86235	86236	86237	Dr. Craven	86	" Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly ? "
86243	86263	86264	86265	Mrs. Medlock	45	" There 's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees , "
86268	86307	86264	86265	Mrs. Medlock	45	" They stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other . And if they want anything different to eat from what 's sent up to them they need only ask for it . "
86308	86311	86313	86314	Dr. Craven	86	" Well , "
86339	86339	86335	86337	a new creature	1448	"
86340	86346	86348	86349	Mrs. Medlock	45	" So is the girl , "
86351	86424	86348	86349	Mrs. Medlock	45	" She 's begun to be downright pretty since she 's filled out and lost her ugly little sour look . Her hair 's grown thick and healthy looking and she 's got a bright color . The glummest , ill - natured little thing she used to be and now her and Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones . Perhaps they 're growing fat on that . "
86425	86430	86432	86433	Dr. Craven	86	" Perhaps they are , "
86435	86440	86432	86433	Dr. Craven	86	" Let them laugh . "
87662	87671	87672	87672	Colin	81	" Now that I am a real boy , "
87676	87775	87672	87672	Colin	81	" my legs and arms and all my body are so full of Magic that I ca n't keep them still . They want to be doing things all the time . Do you know that when I waken in the morning , Mary , when it 's quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy even the trees and things we ca n't really hear I feel as if I must jump out of bed and shout myself . If I did it , just think what would happen ! "
87780	87809	87810	87810	she	38	" The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy and they 'd send for the doctor , "
87839	87848	87849	87849	he	81	" I wish my father would come home , "
87852	87901	87849	87849	he	81	" I want to tell him myself . I 'm always thinking about it but we could n't go on like this much longer . I ca n't stand lying still and pretending , and besides I look too different . I wish it was n't raining today . "
87911	87914	87915	87915	she	38	" Colin , "
87919	87932	87915	87915	she	38	" do you know how many rooms there are in this house ? "
87933	87941	87942	87942	he	81	" About a thousand , I suppose , "
87945	87957	87959	87959	Mary	38	" There 's about a hundred no one ever goes into , "
87961	88019	87959	87959	Mary	38	" And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them . No one ever knew , though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out . I lost my way when I was coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor . That was the second time I heard you crying . "
88027	88036	88037	88037	he	81	" A hundred rooms no one goes into , "
88040	88069	88037	88037	he	81	" It sounds almost like a secret garden . Suppose we go and look at them . Wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went . "
88070	88078	88080	88080	Mary	38	" That 's what I was thinking , "
88082	88128	88080	88080	Mary	38	" No one would dare to follow us . There are galleries where you could run . We could do our exercises . There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants . There are all sorts of rooms . "
88129	88134	88136	88136	Colin	81	" Ring the bell , "
88148	88154	88155	88155	he	81	" I want my chair , "
88158	88211	88155	88155	he	81	" Miss Mary and I are going to look at the part of the house which is not used . John can push me as far as the picture - gallery because there are some stairs . Then he must go away and leave us alone until I send for him again . "
88280	88296	88297	88297	he	81	" I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other , "
88300	88318	88297	88297	he	81	" and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth 's exercises . "
88352	88356	88358	88358	Colin	81	" All these , "
88360	88425	88358	88358	Colin	81	" must be my relations . They lived a long time ago . That parrot one , I believe , is one of my great , great , great , great aunts . She looks rather like you , Mary not as you look now but as you looked when you came here . Now you are a great deal fatter and better looking . "
88426	88431	88433	88433	Mary	38	" So are you , "
88571	88578	88579	88579	Colin	81	" I 'm glad we came , "
88582	88619	88579	88579	Colin	81	" I never knew I lived in such a big queer old place . I like it . We will ramble about every rainy day . We shall always be finding new queer corners and things . "
88684	88689	88690	88690	she	2532	" Look at that ! "
88693	88712	88690	88690	she	2532	" This is a house of mystery , and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it . "
88713	88722	88724	88727	the strong young footman	1534	" If they keep that up every day , "
88730	88772	88728	88728	John	108	" there 'd be small wonder that he weighs twice as much to - day as he did a month ago . I should have to give up my place in time , for fear of doing my muscles an injury . "
88847	88858	88860	88860	Colin	81	" I know what you want me to tell you , "
88870	88902	88860	88860	Colin	81	" I always know when you want me to tell you something . You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back . I am going to keep it like that . "
88903	88906	88908	88908	Mary	38	" Why ? "
88910	89047	88860	88860	Colin	81	" Because it does n't make me angry any more to see her laughing . I wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I could n't lie still . I got up and looked out of the window . The room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord . She looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there . It made me like to look at her . I want to see her laughing like that all the time . I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps . "
89048	89056	89058	89058	Mary	38	" You are so like her now , "
89060	89075	89058	89058	Mary	38	" that sometimes I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy . "
89093	89107	88860	88860	Colin	81	" If I were her ghost my father would be fond of me . "
89108	89119	89121	89121	Mary	38	" Do you want him to be fond of you ? "
89123	89160	88860	88860	Colin	81	" I used to hate it because he was not fond of me . If he grew fond of me I think I should tell him about the Magic . It might make him more cheerful . "
89163	89168	89169	89169	Their	1536	" IT 'S MOTHER ! "
89191	89198	89199	89199	he	81	" I like to do it , "
89202	89259	89199	89199	he	81	" because when I grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise . I can only give short lectures now because I am very young , and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church and he would go to sleep . "
89260	89269	89271	89271	Ben	57	" Th ' best thing about lecturin ' , "
89273	89311	89271	89271	Ben	57	" is that a chap can get up an ' say aught he pleases an ' no other chap can answer him back . I would n't be agen ' lecturin ' a bit mysel ' sometimes . "
89433	89443	89444	89444	he	81	" What are you thinking about , Ben Weatherstaff ? "
89447	89452	89454	89454	Ben	57	" I was thinkin ' "
89456	89500	89454	89454	Ben	57	" as I 'd warrant tha 's , gone up three or four pound this week . I was lookin ' at tha ' calves an ' tha ' shoulders . I 'd like to get thee on a pair o ' scales . "
89501	89517	89519	89519	Colin	81	" It 's the Magic and and Mrs. Sowerby 's buns and milk and things , "
89521	89530	89519	89519	Colin	81	" You see the scientific experiment has succeeded . "
89651	89662	89663	89663	he	81	" The Magic works best when you work , yourself , "
89668	89714	89663	89663	he	81	" You can feel it in your bones and muscles . I am going to read books about bones and muscles , but I am going to write a book about Magic . I am making it up now . I keep finding out things . "
89827	89832	89833	89833	he	81	" Mary ! Dickon ! "
89836	89842	89833	89833	he	81	" Just look at me ! "
89852	89865	89866	89866	he	81	" Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here ? "
89911	89918	89919	89919	he	81	" Aye , that we do , "

89941	89987	89928	89928	she	38	" all at once I remembered it myself when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real . And it is real ! I 'm well I 'm well ! "
89988	89996	89998	89998	Dickon	54	" Aye , that th ' art ! "

I shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows like Dickon and I shall never stop making Magic . I 'm well ! I 'm well ! I feel I feel as if I want to shout out something something thankful , joyful ! "
90168	90177	90178	90178	he	57	" Tha ' might sing th ' Doxology , "
90219	90224	90225	90225	he	57	" What is that ? "
90228	90240	90242	90243	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Dickon can sing it for thee , I 'll warrant , "
90257	90265	90266	90266	he	54	" They sing it i ' church , "
90269	90290	90266	90266	he	54	" Mother says she believes th ' skylarks sings it when they gets up i ' th ' mornin ' . "
90291	90304	90305	90305	Colin	81	" If she says that , it must be a nice song , "
90308	90335	90305	90305	Colin	81	" I 've never been in a church myself . I was always too ill . Sing it , Dickon . I want to hear it . "

90587	90595	90596	90596	he	81	" It is a very nice song , "
90599	90625	90596	90596	he	81	" I like it . Perhaps it means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic . "
90635	90694	90626	90626	He	81	" Perhaps they are both the same thing . How can we know the exact names of everything ? Sing it again , Dickon . Let us try , Mary . I want to sing it , too . It 's my song . How does it begin ? ' Praise God from whom all blessings flow ' ? "

Th ' same thing as set th ' seeds swellin ' an ' th ' sun shinin ' made thee a well lad an ' it 's th ' Good Thing . It is n't like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of our names . Th ' Big Good Thing does n't stop to worrit , bless thee . It goes on makin ' worlds by th ' million worlds like us . Never thee stop believin ' in th ' Big Good Thing an ' knowin ' th ' world 's full of it an ' call it what tha ' likes . Tha ' wert singin ' to it when I come into th ' garden . "
92159	92165	92167	92167	Colin	81	" I felt so joyful , "
92177	92218	92167	92167	Colin	81	" Suddenly I felt how different I was how strong my arms and legs were , you know and how I could dig and stand and I jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen . "
92219	92264	92266	92266	she	1561	" Th ' Magic listened when tha ' sung th ' Doxology . It would ha ' listened to anything tha'd sung . It was th ' joy that mattered . Eh ! lad , lad what 's names to th ' Joy Maker , "
92386	92403	92405	92405	Colin	81	" You see we ca n't help laughing nearly all the time when we are together , "
92407	92435	92405	92405	Colin	81	" And it does n't sound ill at all . We try to choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever . "
92436	92449	92451	92451	Mary	38	" There 's one thing that comes into my mind so often , "
92453	92513	92451	92451	Mary	38	" and I can scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly . I keep thinking suppose Colin 's face should get to look like a full moon . It is n't like one yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day and suppose some morning it should look like one what should we do ! "
92514	92536	92538	92539	Susan Sowerby	54	" Bless us all , I can see tha ' has a good bit o ' play actin ' to do , "

92581	92606	92607	92607	she	1564	" I suppose it ' ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha ' told him in tha ' own way , "

96500	96509	96510	96510	he	41	" I will try to find the key , "
96513	96531	96510	96510	he	41	" I will try to open the door . I must though I do n't know why . "
96592	96600	96601	96601	he	41	" How is Master Colin , Medlock ? "
96604	96609	96581	96581	She	45	" Well , sir , "
96614	96627	96610	96611	Mrs. Medlock	45	" he 's he 's different , in a manner of speaking . "
96628	96631	96632	96632	he	41	" Worse ? "
96641	96649	96650	96650	she	45	" Well , you see , sir , "
96655	96672	96650	96650	she	45	" neither Dr. Craven , nor the nurse , nor me can exactly make him out . "
96673	96678	96635	96636	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Why is that ? "
96679	96712	96650	96650	she	45	" To tell the truth , sir , Master Colin might be better and he might be changing for the worse . His appetite , sir , is past understanding and his ways "
96713	96721	96635	96636	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Has he become more more peculiar ? "
96732	96933	96650	96650	she	45	" That 's it , sir . He 's growing very peculiar when you compare him with what he used to be . He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began to eat something enormous and then he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be . You never knew , sir , perhaps , that out of doors he never would let himself be taken . The things we 've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf . He 'd throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said he could n't be responsible for forcing him . Well , sir , just without warning not long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby 's boy Dickon that could push his chair . He took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon , and Dickon brought his tame animals , and , if you 'll credit it , sir , out of doors he will stay from morning until night . "
96934	96940	97088	97088	he	41	" How does he look ? "
96946	97024	96650	96650	she	45	" If he took his food natural , sir , you 'd think he was putting on flesh but we 're afraid it may be a sort of bloat . He laughs sometimes in a queer way when he 's alone with Miss Mary . He never used to laugh at all . Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once , if you 'll allow him . He never was as puzzled in his life . "
97025	97032	97033	97034	Mr. Craven	41	" Where is Master Colin now ? "
97037	97068	97033	97034	Mr. Craven	41	" In the garden , sir . He 's always in the garden though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they 'll look at him . "
97077	97082	97083	97083	he	41	" In the garden , "
97103	97108	97094	97094	he	41	" In the garden ! "
97666	97672	97673	97673	he	41	" Who What ? Who ! "
97758	97761	97762	97762	he	41	" Father , "
97765	97785	97762	97762	he	41	" I 'm Colin . You ca n't believe it . I scarcely can myself . I 'm Colin . "
97803	97812	97799	97799	he	41	" In the garden ! In the garden ! "
97813	97816	97819	97819	Colin	81	" Yes , "
97821	97874	97819	97819	Colin	81	" It was the garden that did it and Mary and Dickon and the creatures and the Magic . No one knows . We kept it to tell you when you came . I 'm well , I can beat Mary in a race . I 'm going to be an athlete . "
97921	97929	97930	97930	he	81	" Are n't you glad , Father ? "
97933	97950	97930	97930	he	81	" Are n't you glad ? I 'm going to live forever and ever and ever ! "
97980	97990	97991	97991	he	41	" Take me into the garden , my boy , "
97996	98004	97991	97991	he	41	" And tell me all about it . "
98128	98136	98137	98137	he	1733	" I thought it would be dead , "
98140	98147	98149	98149	Colin	81	" Mary thought so at first , "
98151	98157	98149	98149	Colin	81	" But it came alive . "
98299	98302	98303	98303	he	1733	" Now , "
98312	98360	98303	98303	he	1733	" it need not be a secret any more . I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see me but I am never going to get into the chair again . I shall walk back with you , Father to the house . "
98481	98491	98492	98492	she	45	" Did you see either of them , Weatherstaff ? "
98515	98522	98523	98523	he	57	" Aye , that I did , "
98531	98536	98538	98539	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Both of them ? "
98541	98546	98548	98549	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Both of 'em , "
98551	98567	98548	98549	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Thank ye kindly , ma'am , I could sup up another mug of it . "
98568	98571	98573	98574	Mrs. Medlock	45	" Together ? "
98586	98591	98593	98593	Ben	57	" Together , ma'am , "
98605	98624	98548	98549	Ben Weatherstaff	57	" Where was Master Colin ? How did he look ? What did they say to each other ? "
98625	98632	98634	98634	Ben	57	" I didna ' hear that , "
98636	98687	98634	98634	Ben	57	" along o ' only bein ' on th ' stepladder lookin , over th ' wall . But I 'll tell thee this . There 's been things goin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about . An ' what tha'll find out tha'll find out soon . "
98722	98726	98727	98727	he	57	" Look there , "
98730	98746	98727	98727	he	57	" if tha 's curious . Look what 's comin ' across th ' grass . "
