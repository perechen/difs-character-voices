525	531	543	545	The venerable lady	2080	" from my beloved son , "
962	966	968	968	he	687	" We have , "
970	994	968	968	he	687	" but yonder ugly negro boy , who is fetching the trunks , and a passenger who has the state cabin to himself . "
1009	1041	1000	1000	he	686	" Confound you , Franks , and your luck ! The Duke William , which came in last week , brought fourteen , and she is not half of our tonnage . "
1042	1058	1060	1061	the Captain	2104	" And this passenger , who has the whole cabin , do n't pay nothin' , "
1063	1086	1060	1061	the Captain	2104	" Swear now , it will do you good , Mr. Trail , indeed it will . I have tried the medicine . "
1087	1109	1000	1000	he	686	" A passenger take the whole cabin and not pay ? Gracious mercy , are you a fool , Captain Franks ? "
1110	1121	1125	1126	the master	2111	" Ask the passenger himself , for here he comes . "
1165	1269	1143	1143	He	2112	" Gumbo , you idiot , why do n't you fetch the baggage out of the cabin ? Well , shipmate , our journey is ended . You will see all the little folks to - night whom you have been talking about . Give my love to Polly , and Betty , and Little Tommy ; not forgetting my duty to Mrs. Franks . I thought , yesterday , the voyage would never be done , and now I am almost sorry it is over . That little berth in my cabin looks very comfortable now I am going to leave it . "
1300	1319	1296	1297	Captain Franks	687	" This here gentleman is Mr. Trail , sir , whose name you have a - heerd of . "
1320	1331	1333	1334	Mr. Trail	686	" It 's pretty well known in Bristol , sir , "
1338	1354	1356	1357	the Captain	2104	" And this is Mr. Warrington , Madam Esmond Warrington 's son , of Castlewood , "
1392	1478	1371	1375	the owner of the beaver	2117	" Gracious powers , Mr. Warrington ! This is a delight , indeed ! What a crowning mercy that your voyage should have been so prosperous ! You must have my boat to go on shore . Let me cordially and respectfully welcome you to England : let me shake your hand as the son of my benefactress and patroness , Mrs. Esmond Warrington , whose name is known and honoured on Bristol ' Change , I warrant you . Is n't it , Franks ? "
1479	1498	1500	1501	Mr. Franks	696	" There 's no sweeter tobacco comes from Virginia , and no better brand than the Three Castles , "
1523	1627	1500	1501	Mr. Franks	696	" You do n't know what a comfort it is , sir ! you 'll take to it , bless you , as you grow older . Wo n't he , Mr. Trail ? I wish you had ten shiploads of it instead of one . You might have ten shiploads : I 've told Madam Esmond so ; I 've rode over her plantation ; she treats me like a lord when I go to the house ; she do n't grudge me the best of wine , or keep me cooling my heels in the counting - room as some folks does "
1635	1665	1632	1633	Mr. Trail	686	" She is a real born lady , she is ; and might have a thousand hogsheads as easy as her hundreds , if there were but hands enough . "
1666	1692	1694	1695	Mr. Trail	686	" I have lately engaged in the Guinea trade , and could supply her ladyship with any number of healthy young negroes before next fall , "
1699	1711	1713	1715	the young gentleman	2119	" We are averse to the purchase of negroes from Africa , "
1719	1746	1713	1715	the young gentleman	2119	" My grandfather and my mother have always objected to it , and I do not like to think of selling or buying the poor wretches . "
1747	1767	1769	1770	Mr. Trail	686	" It is for their good , my dear young sir ! for their temporal and their spiritual good ! "
1772	1825	1769	1770	Mr. Trail	686	" And we purchase the poor creatures only for their benefit ; let me talk this matter over with you at my own house . I can introduce you to a happy home , a Christian family , and a British merchant 's honest fare . Ca n't I , Captain Franks ? "
1826	1831	1833	1834	the Captain	2104	" Ca n't say , "
1836	1873	1833	1834	the Captain	2104	" Never asked me to take bite or sup at your table . Asked me to psalm - singing once , and to hear Mr. Ward preach : do n't care for them sort of entertainments . "
1892	1953	1888	1888	his	686	" Business is business , my dear young sir , and I know , ' tis only my duty , the duty of all of us , to cultivate the fruits of the earth in their season . As the heir of Lady Esmond 's estate for I speak , I believe , to the heir of that great property ? "
1961	2029	1954	1956	The young gentleman	2119	" I would urge upon you , at the very earliest moment , the propriety , the duty of increasing the ample means with which Heaven has blessed you . As an honest factor , I could not do otherwise ; as a prudent man , should I scruple to speak of what will tend to your profit and mine ? No , my dear Mr. George . "
2030	2042	2044	2046	the young man	2122	" My name is not George ; my name is Henry , "
2061	2092	2044	2046	the young man	2122	" Gracious powers ! what do you mean , sir ? Did you not say you were my lady 's heir ? and is not George Esmond Warrington , Esq . "
2093	2101	2103	2104	Mr. Franks	696	" Hold your tongue , you fool ! "
2124	2144	2103	2104	Mr. Franks	696	" Do n't you see the young gentleman a - swabbing his eyes , and note his black clothes ? "
2145	2177	2191	2191	his	2104	" What do you mean , Captain Franks , by laying your hand on your owners ? Mr. George is the heir ; I know the Colonel 's will well enough . "
2178	2184	2186	2187	the Captain	2104	" Mr. George is there , "
2197	2200	2202	2203	the factor	2127	" Where ? "
2205	2211	2213	2214	the Captain	2104	" Mr. George is there ! "
2230	2290	2219	2219	his	2104	" He is dead a year , sir , come next 9th of July . He would go out with General Braddock on that dreadful business to the Belle Riviere . He and a thousand more never came back again . Every man of them was murdered as he fell . You know the Indian way , Mr. Trail ? "
2303	2539	2293	2294	the Captain	2104	" Horrible ! ai n't it , sir ? horrible ! He was a fine young man , the very picture of this one ; only his hair was black , which is now hanging in a bloody Indian wigwam . He was often and often on board of the Young Rachel , and would have his chests of books broke open on deck before they was landed . He was a shy and silent young gent : not like this one , which was the merriest , wildest young fellow , full of his songs and fun . He took on dreadful at the news ; went to his bed , had that fever which lays so many of 'em by the heels along that swampy Potomac , but he 's got better on the voyage : the voyage makes every one better ; and , in course , the young gentleman ca n't be for ever a - crying after a brother who dies and leaves him a great fortune . Ever since we sighted Ireland he has been quite gay and happy , only he would go off at times , when he was most merry , saying , ' I wish my dearest Georgy could enjoy this here sight along with me , and when you mentioned the t'other 's name , you see , he could n't stand it . ' "
4332	4352	4323	4325	the old man	2276	" You have had a nice ride to Hexton , Master Harry , and the sorrel carried you well . "
4353	4361	4363	4363	Harry	701	" I think you must be Lockwood , "
4444	4459	4438	4438	his	2282	" I have heard of you often . How did you know my name ? "
4460	4468	4470	4472	the old man	2276	" They say I forget most things , "
4478	4592	4470	4472	the old man	2276	" but I ai n't so bad as that quite . Only this mornin ' , when you went out , my darter says , ' Father , do you know why you have a black coat on ? ' ' In course I know why I have a black coat , ' says I. ' My lord is dead . They say ' twas a foul blow , and Master Frank is my lord now , and Master Harry ' why , what have you done since you 've went out this morning ? Why , you have a - grow'd taller and changed your hair though I know I know you . "
4618	4627	4628	4628	she	2285	" Grandfather sometimes does not recollect very well , "
4636	4646	4628	4628	she	2285	" Your honour seems to have heard of Lockwood ? "
4647	4660	4628	4628	she	2285	" And you , have you never heard of Colonel Francis Esmond ? "
4661	4684	4686	4686	Lockwood	712	" He was Captain and Major in Webb 's Foot , and I was with him in two campaigns , sure enough , "
4688	4695	4628	4628	she	2285	" Was n't I , Ponto ? "
4696	4738	4628	4628	she	2285	" The Colonel as married Viscountess Rachel , my late lord 's mother ? and went to live amongst the Indians ? We have heard of him . Sure we have his picture in our gallery , and hisself painted it . "
4739	4759	4628	4628	she	2285	" Went to live in Virginia , and died there seven years ago , and I am his grandson . "
4760	4778	4780	4780	Molly	690	" Lord , your honour ! Why , your honour 's skin 's as white as mine , "
4782	4815	4780	4780	Molly	690	" Grandfather , do you hear this ? His honour is Colonel Esmond 's grandson that used to send you tobacco , and his honour have come all the way from Virginia . "
4816	4823	4825	4827	the young man	2122	" To see you , Lockwood , "
4829	4864	4825	4827	the young man	2122	" and the family . I only set foot on English ground yesterday , and my first visit is for home . I may see the house , though the family are from home ? "
5231	5255	5206	5206	Harry	701	" Henry Esmond Warrington , of Castlewood , in Virginia , arrived in England yesterday staying at the Three Castles in the village . "
5275	5278	5256	5257	The lackeys	2324	" wails , "
6268	6282	6259	6259	Gumbo	689	" You can not go in , sar my master asleep , sar ! "
6332	6340	6342	6344	the young blasphemer	2409	" Beg your pardon , Cousin Warrington , "
6346	6398	6342	6344	the young blasphemer	2409	" are you asleep ? Beg your pardon for riding you over on the bridge . Did n't know you course should n't have done it thought it was a lawyer with a writ dressed in black , you know . Gad ! thought it was Nathan come to nab me . "
6415	6432	6434	6434	Harry	701	" You did me great honour to mistake me for a sheriff's - officer , cousin , "
6447	6510	6434	6434	Harry	701	" Gad ! I thought it was Nathan , and was going to send you souse into the river . But I ask your pardon . You see I had been drinking at the Bell at Hexton , and the punch is good at the Bell at Hexton . Hullo ! you , Davis ! a bowl of punch ; d'you hear ? "
6511	6531	6532	6532	Harry	701	" I have had my share for to - night , cousin , and I should think you have , "
6541	6558	6559	6560	Mr. William	725	" You want me to go , Cousin What's - your - name , I see , "
6566	6694	6559	6560	Mr. William	725	" You want me to go , and they want me to come , and I did n't want to come . I said , I 'd see him hanged first , that 's what I said . Why should I trouble myself to come down all alone of an evening , and look after a fellow I do n't care a pin for ? Zackly what I said . Zackly what Castlewood said . Why the devil should he go down ? Castlewood says , and so said my lady , but the Baroness would have you . It 's all the Baroness 's doing , and if she says a thing , it must be done ; so you must just get up and come . "
6732	6740	6741	6741	he	725	" I tell you what , cousin , "
6744	6766	6741	6741	he	725	" I wo n't move for the Countess , or for the Baroness , or for all the cousins in Castlewood . "
6807	6819	6786	6790	the young gentleman in bed	2414	" Sot , you little tobacconist ! Sot , you Cherokee ! "
6825	6864	6822	6823	Mr. William	725	" Jump out of bed , and I 'll drive my sword through your body . Why did n't I do it to - day when I took you for a bailiff a confounded pettifogging bum - bailiff ! "
6993	7015	7016	7017	the landlord	2412	" He never remembers nothin' about it the next day . He is of a real kind nature , Mr. William , "
7020	7071	7016	7017	the landlord	2412	" and the men get crowns and half - crowns from him by saying that he beat them overnight when he was in liquor . He 's the devil when he 's tipsy , Mr. William , but when he is sober he is the very kindest of young gentlemen . "
7338	7371	7323	7324	Lady Castlewood	721	" Wait till your aunt comes , children ; perhaps the Baroness wo n't like to see the young man ; at least , let us consult her before we ask him . "
7794	7800	7801	7801	she	2319	" That was his place , "
7833	7843	7830	7830	She	2319	" Young gentlemen , that you do n't play . "
7844	7851	7853	7853	Castlewood	721	" Never , on my word , "
7855	7862	7864	7864	Will	734	" Never , ' pon honour , "
7937	7947	7948	7948	she	2319	" The only man of the family was that , "
7981	8007	8014	8014	She	2319	" The Virginian ? What is he good for ? I always thought he was good for nothing but to cultivate tobacco and my grandmother , "
8030	8100	8014	8014	She	2319	" I say he was the best of you all . There never was one of the male Esmonds that had more brains than a goose , except him . He was not fit for this wicked , selfish old world of ours , and he was right to go and live out of it . Where would your father have been , young people , but for him ? "
8101	8110	8112	8113	Lady Maria	690	" Was he particularly kind to our papa ? "
8115	8123	8125	8126	the Countess	2315	" Old stories , my dear Maria ! "
8128	8149	8125	8126	the Countess	2315	" I am sure my dear Earl was very kind to him in giving him that great estate in Virginia . "
8150	8192	8014	8014	She	2319	" Since his brother 's death , the lad who has been here to - day is heir to that . Mr. Draper told me so ! Peste ! I do n't know why my father gave up such a property . "
8193	8202	8204	8205	the Baroness	2319	" Who has been here to - day ? "
8210	8218	8219	8220	my lord	2193	" Harry Esmond Warrington , of Virginia , "
8223	8248	8219	8220	my lord	2193	" a lad whom Will nearly pitched into the river , and whom I pressed my lady the Countess to invite to stay here . "
8249	8272	8014	8014	She	2319	" You mean that one of the Virginian boys has been to Castlewood , and has not been asked to stay here ? "
8273	8285	8219	8220	my lord	2193	" There is but one of them , my dear creature , "
8290	8300	8219	8220	my lord	2193	" The other , you know , has just been "
8301	8308	8014	8014	She	2319	" For shame , for shame ! "
8309	8323	8014	8014	She	2319	" Oh ! it ai n't pleasant , I confess , to be se "
8324	8354	8219	8220	my lord	2193	" Do you mean that a grandson of Henry Esmond , the master of this house , has been here , and none of you have offered him hospitality ? "
8355	8371	8373	8373	Will	734	" Since we did n't know it , and he is staying at the Castles ? "
8375	8390	8392	8394	the old lady	2505	" That he is staying at the Inn , and you are sitting there ! "
8396	8428	8392	8394	the old lady	2505	" This is too bad call somebody to me . Get me my hood I 'll go to the boy myself . Come with me this instant , my Lord Castlewood . "
8439	8446	8447	8447	he	2122	" Madame the Baroness of Bernstein , "
8450	8551	8447	8447	he	2122	" your ladyship is welcome to go ; but as for me , I do n't choose to have such words as ' shameful ' applied to my conduct . I wo n't go and fetch the young gentleman from Virginia , and I propose to sit here and finish this bowl of punch . Eugene ! Do n't Eugene me , madam . I know her ladyship has a great deal of money , which you are desirous should remain in our amiable family . You want it more than I do . Cringe for it I wo n't . "
8597	8623	8586	8586	She	2319	" I had unright when I said the Colonel was the only man of the family . Thou canst , if thou willest , Eugene . "
8632	8663	8665	8666	the Baroness	2319	" If you do not wish an old woman to go out at this hour of the night , let William , at least , go and fetch his cousin , "
8668	8677	8665	8666	the Baroness	2319	" The very thing I proposed to him . "
8678	8688	8690	8691	the daughters	2513	" And so did we and so did we ! "
8696	8710	8712	8713	their mother	2071	" I am sure , I only wanted the dear Baroness 's consent ! "
8715	8729	8712	8713	their mother	2071	" and shall be charmed for my part to welcome our young relative . "
8730	8748	8750	8751	my lord	2193	" Will ! Put on thy pattens and get a lantern , and go fetch the Virginian , "
8753	8766	8768	8768	William	725	" And we will have another bowl of punch when he comes , "
9714	9722	9731	9731	his	2434	" Colonel Esmond 's house in England . "
9847	9857	9858	9858	she	2586	" I knew your grandfather very well , Harry , "
9861	9887	9858	9858	she	2586	" So you came yesterday to see his picture , and they turned you away , though you know the house was his of right ? "
9893	9910	9911	9911	he	701	" The servants did not know me . A young gentleman came to me last night , "
9914	9980	9911	9911	he	701	" when I was peevish , and he , I fear , was tipsy . I spoke rudely to my cousin , and would ask his pardon . Your ladyship knows that in Virginia our manners towards strangers are different . I own I had expected another kind of welcome . Was it you , madam , who sent my cousin to me last night ? "
9981	10075	9911	9911	he	701	" I sent him ; but you will find your cousins most friendly to you to - day . You must stay here . Lord Castlewood would have been with you this morning , only I was so eager to see you . There will be breakfast in an hour ; and meantime you must talk to me . We will send to the Three Castles for your servant and your baggage . Give me your arm . Stop , I dropped my cane when you came . You shall be my cane . "
10076	10086	10088	10088	Harry	701	" My grandfather used to call us his crutches , "
10090	10101	10088	10088	Harry	701	" You are like him , though you are fair . "
10102	10113	10115	10116	the boy	2227	" You should have seen you should have seen George , "
11502	11515	11516	11516	he	2488	" My love , I shall not be sorry to go myself , "
11522	11562	11516	11516	he	2488	" and you , though the most affectionate of daughters , will console yourself after a while . Why should I , who am so old , be romantic ? You may , who are still a young creature . "
13058	13069	13046	13046	his	710	" You let mamma rule you in everything , grandpapa . "
13070	13077	13079	13079	grandpapa	19851	" Why , so I do , "
13081	13108	13079	13079	grandpapa	19851	" Rachel , my love , the way in which I am petticoat - ridden is so evident that even this baby has found it out . "
13109	13121	13124	13124	Harry	701	" Then why do n't you stand up like a man ? "
13140	13151	13152	13152	he	756	" Because I like sitting down best , my dear , "
13155	13167	13152	13152	he	756	" I am an old gentleman , and standing fatigues me . "
13404	13418	13419	13419	she	683	" Books , papa , I can fancy to be a good choice , "
13439	13490	13419	13419	she	683	" though I am sure you must have pretty nigh all the books in the world already . But I never can desire I may be wrong , but I never can desire that my son , and the grandson of the Marquis of Esmond , should be a fiddler . "
13491	13500	13501	13503	the old Colonel	2840	" Should be a fiddlestick , my dear , "
13506	13570	13501	13503	the old Colonel	2840	" Remember that Heaven 's ways are not ours , and that each creature born has a little kingdom of thought of his own , which it is a sin in us to invade . Suppose George loves music ? You can no more stop him than you can order a rose not to smell sweet , or a bird not to sing . "
13571	13595	13597	13598	Mrs. Warrington	695	" A bird ! A bird sings from nature ; George did not come into the world with a fiddle in his hand , "
13607	13653	13604	13604	her	695	" I am sure I hated the harpsichord when a chit at Kensington School , and only learned it to please my mamma . Say what you will , dear sir , I can not believe that this fiddling is work for persons of fashion . "
13654	13666	13604	13604	her	695	" And King David who played the harp , my dear ? "
13667	13686	13688	13689	Mrs. Warrington	695	" I wish my papa would read him more , and not speak about him in that way , "
13691	13705	13706	13707	the father	2841	" Nay , my dear , it was but by way of illustration , "
15142	15153	15154	15154	she	2928	" And that is always the way with the Esmonds , "
15595	15605	15606	15606	she	2071	" Is not all I have my sons ' ? "
15609	15660	15606	15606	she	2071	" and would I not cut myself into little pieces to serve them ? With the six thousand pounds I would have bought Mr. Boulter 's estate and negroes , which would have given us a good thousand pounds a year , and made a handsome provision for my Harry . "
16133	16165	16205	16206	the lady	2586	" Harry , Harry ! I wish I had put by the money for thee , my poor portionless child three hundred and eighty guineas of ready money to Messieurs Hatchett ! "
16166	16186	16188	16188	Harry	766	" You will give me plenty while you live , and George will give me plenty when you die , "
16192	16203	16205	16206	the lady	2586	" Not unless he changes in spirit , my dear , "
16217	16247	16205	16206	the lady	2586	" Not unless Heaven softens his heart and teaches him charity , for which I pray day and night ; as Mountain knows ; do you not , Mountain ? "
16278	16306	16256	16257	Madam Esmond	683	" Humph ! I know you are always disturbing yourself and crying out about this legacy , and I do n't see that there is any need . "
16307	16314	16316	16317	the widow	3031	" Oh no ! no need ! "
16324	16367	16316	16317	the widow	3031	" of course I have no need to be disturbed , because my eldest born is a disobedient son and an unkind brother because he has an estate , and my poor Harry , bless him , but a mess of pottage . "
16388	16402	16403	16403	he	694	" I wish you would bless me , too , O my mother ! "
16437	16467	16429	16429	he	766	" Never mind , George . I know whether you are a good brother or not . Do n't mind what she says . She do n't mean it . "
16468	16476	16478	16479	the mother	3050	" I do mean it , child , "
16481	16485	16478	16479	the mother	3050	" Would to Heaven "
16486	16493	16496	16496	Harry	766	" HOLD YOUR TONGUE , I SAY "
16498	16511	16496	16496	Harry	766	" It 's a shame to speak so to him , ma'am . "
16512	16520	16522	16523	Mrs. Mountain	773	" And so it is , Harry , "
16529	16540	16522	16523	Mrs. Mountain	773	" You never said a truer word in your life . "
16541	16555	16557	16558	the widow	3031	" Mrs. Mountain , do you dare to set my children against me ? "
16560	16567	16557	16558	the widow	3031	" From this very day , madam "
16568	16580	16582	16583	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Turn me and my child into the street ? Do , "
16585	16659	16582	16583	Mrs. Mountain	773	" That will be a fine revenge because the English lawyer wo n't give you the boy 's money . Find another companion who will tell you black is white , and flatter you : it is not my way , madam . When shall I go ? I sha n't be long a - packing . I did not bring much into Castlewood House , and I shall not take much out . "
16660	16684	16686	16687	the widow	3031	" Hush ! the bells are ringing for church , Mountain . Let us try , if you please , and compose ourselves , "
16868	16882	16845	16845	she	739	" Hush , my dears ! I ca n't hear our cousin speak . "
16896	16904	16906	16908	the honest boy	3065	" Are you my cousin , too ? "
16910	16919	16906	16908	the honest boy	3065	" You see kinder than my other cousins . "
17051	17059	17060	17060	she	2586	" Are you my cousin , too ? "
17063	17170	17060	17060	she	2586	" That picture is by Sir Godfrey , who thought himself the greatest painter in the world . But he was not so good as Lely , who painted your grandmother my my Lady Castlewood , Colonel Esmond 's wife ; nor he so good as Sir Anthony Van Dyck , who painted your great - grandfather , yonder and who looks , Harry , a much finer gentleman than he was . Some of us are painted blacker than we are . Did you recognise your grandmother in that picture ? She had the loveliest fair hair and shape of any woman of her time . "
17171	17191	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" I fancied I knew the portrait from instinct , perhaps , and a certain likeness to my mother . "
17192	17213	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" Did Mrs. Warrington I beg her pardon , I think she calls herself Madam or my Lady Esmond now ? "
17214	17224	17226	17227	the boy	2227	" They call my mother so in our province , "
17229	17250	17226	17227	the boy	2227	" Did she never tell you of another daughter her mother had in England , before she married your grandfather ? "
17251	17258	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" She never spoke of one . "
17259	17264	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" Nor your grandfather ? "
17265	17319	17226	17227	the boy	2227	" Never . But in his picture - books , which he constantly made for us children , he used to draw a head very like that above your ladyship . That , and Viscount Francis , and King James III . , he drew a score of times , I am sure . "
17320	17334	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" And the picture over me reminds you of no one , Harry ? "
17335	17340	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" No , indeed . "
17341	17349	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" Ah ! Here is a sermon ! "
17358	17398	17351	17352	the lady	2586	" Harry , that was my face once yes , it was and then I was called Beatrix Esmond . And your mother is my half - sister , child , and she has never even mentioned my name ! "
18098	18101	18111	18113	the young ladies	2318	" my Fanny "
18103	18106	18111	18113	the young ladies	2318	" my Rachel "
18841	18864	18835	18836	his mother	2340	" The Esmonds were always of a jealous disposition , and my poor boy takes after my father and mother in this . "
19179	19182	19218	19218	His	785	" call , "
19847	19860	19861	19861	she	683	" What matters whether he has more or less of profane learning ? "
19864	19960	19861	19861	she	683	" in that which is most precious , Mr. W. is able to be a teacher to all of us . What if his manners are a little rough ? Heaven does not choose its elect from among the great and wealthy . I wish you knew one book , children , as well as Mr. Ward does . It is your wicked pride the pride of all the Esmonds which prevents you from listening to him . Go down on your knees in your chamber and pray to be corrected of that dreadful fault . "
20481	20737	20457	20457	she	773	" Ward is more obsequious than ever to your mamma . It turns my stomach , it does , to hear him flatter , and to see him gobble the odious wretch ! You must be on your guard , my poor boys you must learn your lessons , and not anger your tutor . A mischief will come , I know it will . Your mamma was talking about you to Mr. Washington the other day , when I came into the room . I do n't like that Major Washington , you know I do n't . Do n't say O Mounty ! Master Harry . You always stand up for your friends , you do . The Major is very handsome and tall , and he may be very good , but he is much too old a young man for me . Bless you , my dears , the quantity of wild oats your father sowed and my own poor Mountain when they were ensigns in Kingsley 's , would fill sacks full ! Show me Mr. Washington 's wild oats , I say not a grain ! Well , I happened to step in last Tuesday , when he was here with your mamma ; and I am sure they were talking about you , for he said , ' Discipline is discipline , and must be preserved . There can be but one command in a house , ma'am , and you must be the mistress of yours . ' "
20738	20747	20749	20749	Harry	701	" The very words he used to me , "
20751	20800	20749	20749	Harry	701	" He told me that he did not like to meddle with other folks ' affairs , but that our mother was very angry , dangerously angry , he said , and he begged me to obey Mr. Ward , and specially to press George to do so . "
20801	20812	20814	20814	George	694	" Let him manage his own house , not mine , "
21007	21019	21021	21022	Mr. Ward	697	" To be a tutor to such a pupil is absurd , "
21071	21083	21085	21086	Madam Esmond	683	" Not before you have punished this wicked and disobedient child , "
21106	21109	21111	21111	George	694	" Punish ! "
21113	21230	21111	21111	George	694	" Yes , sir , punish ! If means of love and entreaty fail , as they have with your proud heart , other means must be found to bring you to obedience . I punish you now , rebellious boy , to guard you from greater punishment hereafter . The discipline of this family must be maintained . There can be but one command in a house , and I must be the mistress of mine . You will punish this refractory boy , Mr. Ward , as we have agreed that you should do , and if there is the least resistance on his part , my overseer and servants will lend you aid . "
21391	21416	21417	21417	George	694	" There can be but one command in the house , and you must be mistress I know who said those words before you , "
21426	21443	21417	21417	George	694	" and and I know , mother , that I have acted wrongly to Mr. Ward . "
21444	21453	21455	21455	Harry	701	" He owns it ! He asks pardon ! "
21457	21472	21455	21455	Harry	701	" That 's right , George ! That 's enough : is n't it ? "
21473	21481	21483	21485	the little woman	3308	" No , it is not enough ! "
21487	21543	21483	21485	the little woman	3308	" The disobedient boy must pay the penalty of his disobedience . When I was headstrong , as I sometimes was as a child before my spirit was changed and humbled , my mamma punished me , and I submitted . So must George . I desire you will do your duty , Mr. Ward . "
21544	21559	21560	21560	George	694	" Stop , mother ! you do n't quite know what you are doing , "
21566	21582	21560	21560	George	694	" I know that he who spares the rod spoils the child , ungrateful boy ! "
21655	21666	21667	21667	he	694	" Stay one minute . Do n't go away yet , "
21679	21691	21667	21667	he	694	" You you are very fond of this cup , mother ? "
21700	21754	21693	21693	Harry	701	" If I broke it , it could never be mended , could it ? All the tinkers ' rivets would not make it a whole cup again . My dear old grandpapa 's cup ! I have been wrong . Mr. Ward , I ask pardon . I will try and amend . "
21766	21770	21771	21771	she	3031	" I thought , "
21774	21791	21771	21771	she	3031	" I thought an Esmond had been more of a man than to be afraid , and "
21851	21859	21860	21860	George	694	" It is too late , Hal , "
21863	21933	21860	21860	George	694	" You will never mend that again never . Now , mother , I am ready , as it is your wish . Will you come and see whether I am afraid ? Mr. Ward , I am your servant . Your servant ? Your slave ! And the next time I meet Mr. Washington , madam , I will thank him for the advice which he gave you . "
21934	21944	21946	21947	Mrs. Esmond	780	" I say , do your duty , sir ! "
21978	21990	21992	21993	poor Hal	701	" Stop ! For God 's sake , mother , stop ! "
22016	22024	22025	22025	she	3308	" You only abet him , sir ! "
22028	22042	22025	22025	she	3308	" If I had to do it myself , it should be done ! "
22194	22204	22206	22206	Harry	701	" I do n't care . I did it , "
22208	22266	22268	22268	Harry	701	" I could n't see this fellow strike my brother ; and , as he lifted his hand , I flung the great ruler at him . I could n't help it . I wo n't bear it ; and , if one lifts a hand to me or my brother , I 'll have his life , "
22358	22367	22368	22368	she	3031	" You are a very naughty disobedient child , "
22377	22537	22368	22368	she	3031	" My poor Mr. Ward ! What a rebel , to strike you ! Papa 's great ebony ruler , was it ? Lay down that hanger , child . ' Twas General Webb gave it to my papa after the siege of Lille . Let me bathe your wound , my good Mr. Ward , and thank Heaven it was no worse . Mountain ! Go fetch me some court - plaster out of the middle drawer in the japan cabinet . Here comes George . Put on your coat and waistcoat , child ! You were going to take your punishment , sir , and that is sufficient . Ask pardon , Harry , of good Mr. Ward , for your wicked rebellious spirit , I do , with all my heart , I am sure . And guard against your passionate nature , child and pray to be forgiven . My son , O my son ! "
22585	22616	22567	22567	Harry	701	" Indeed , I ask your pardon , sir . I could n't help it ; on my honour I could n't ; nor bear to see my brother struck . "
22655	22664	22665	22665	he	694	" You meant for the best , mother , "
22668	22716	22665	22665	he	694	" and I was in the wrong . But the cup is broken ; and all the king 's horses and all the king 's men can not mend it . There put the fair side outwards on the mantelpiece , and the wound will not show . "
22813	22819	22822	22822	he	701	" Thank you , brother ! "
22861	22872	22873	22873	George	694	" I ask pardon for Hal 's violence , sir , "
22880	22925	22873	22873	George	694	" You see , though we are very young , we are gentlemen , and can not brook an insult from strangers . I should have submitted , as it was mamma 's desire ; but I am glad she no longer entertains it . "
22926	22938	22940	22941	Mr. Ward	697	" And pray , sir , who is to compensate me ? "
22943	22954	22940	22941	Mr. Ward	697	" who is to repair the insult done to me ? "
22955	22961	22963	22963	George	694	" We are very young , "
22974	22988	22963	22963	George	694	" We shall be fifteen soon . Any compensation that is usual amongst gentlemen "
22989	23001	23004	23004	Ward	697	" This , sir , to a minister of the Word ! "
23034	23059	22963	22963	George	694	" You are not a clergyman yet . We thought you might like to be considered as a gentleman . We did not know . "
23060	23071	23073	23073	Ward	697	" A gentleman ! I am a Christian , sir ! "
23084	23101	23103	23103	Harry	701	" Well , well , if you wo n't fight , why do n't you forgive ? "
23105	23129	23103	23103	Harry	701	" If you do n't forgive , why do n't you fight ? That 's what I call the horns of a dilemma ; "
23345	23353	23354	23354	he	697	" For why , my dear friends , "
23376	23401	23357	23357	he	697	" why are governors appointed , but that we should be governed ? Why are tutors engaged , but that children should be taught ? "
23409	23413	23357	23357	he	697	" Why are rulers "
23457	23465	23430	23430	He	3347	" Why , I say , are rulers "
23466	23469	23471	23471	George	694	" Rulers , "
23477	23480	23482	23482	Hal	701	" Rulers ! "
23719	23732	23715	23715	he	2227	" Broken ! Broken ! It never , never can be mended ! "
23829	23838	23840	23840	he	760	" I shall bury my resentment , madam , "
23842	23864	23840	23840	he	760	" as your ladyship buried your pride . Please God , I maybe time enough to help my dear young pupil ! "
25018	25032	25034	25034	Mountain	773	" She likes him best , and I like you best , George , "
25036	25076	25034	25034	Mountain	773	" Besides , if I were to speak to him , he would tell your mother in a minute . Poor Harry can keep nothing quiet , and then there would be a pretty quarrel between Madam and me ! "
25077	25088	25090	25091	Mr. George	694	" I beg you to keep this quiet , Mountain , "
25097	25125	25090	25091	Mr. George	694	" or you and I shall quarrel too . Neither to me nor to any one else in the world must you mention such an absurd suspicion . "
25203	25235	25237	25237	Mountain	773	" He actually leaves his clothes here and his portmanteau when he goes away . Ah ! George , George ! One day will come when he wo n't go away , "
26137	26142	26143	26143	she	2761	" Ah , Harry ! "
26147	26211	26143	26143	she	2761	" think of you , with your cock - fighting and your racing - matches , and the Major away there in the wilderness , watching the French , and battling with the frozen rivers ! Ah , George ! learning may be a very good thing , but I wish my eldest son were doing something in the service of his country ! "
26212	26228	26230	26230	George	694	" I desire no better than to go home and seek for employment , ma'am , "
26232	26257	26143	26143	she	2761	" You surely will not have me serve under Mr. Washington , in his new regiment , or ask a commission from Mr. Dinwiddie ? "
26258	26270	26272	26272	Madam	683	" An Esmond can only serve with the king 's commission , "
26274	26295	26272	26272	Madam	683	" and as for asking a favour from Mr. Lieutenant - Governor Dinwiddie , I would rather beg my bread . "
26527	26530	26521	26522	no one	2804	" Fire . "
26850	26860	26861	26861	he	3586	" I was angry when I parted from you , "
26878	26914	26861	26861	he	3586	" You seemed to scorn me and my regiment , George . I thought you laughed at us , and your ridicule made me angry . I boasted too much of what we would do . "
26915	26926	26934	26934	his	3586	" Nay , you have done your best , George , "
26944	27023	26934	26934	his	3586	" Everybody knows that a hundred and fifty starving men , with scarce a round of ammunition left , could not face five times their number perfectly armed , and everybody who knows Mr. Washington knows that he would do his duty . Harry and I saw the French in Canada last year . They obey but one will : in our provinces each governor has his own . They were royal troops the French sent against you ... "
27024	27035	27041	27041	her	683	" Oh , but that some of ours were here ! "
27045	27062	27041	27041	her	683	" I promise you a few good English regiments would make the white - coats run . "
27063	27083	27085	27086	the Colonel	19708	" You think nothing of the provincials : and I must say nothing now we have been so unlucky , "
27090	27148	27085	27086	the Colonel	19708	" You made much of me when I was here before . Do n't you remember what victories you prophesied for me how much I boasted myself very likely over your good wine ? All those fine dreams are over now . ' Tis kind of your ladyship to receive a poor beaten fellow as you do : "
27209	27220	27222	27223	the widow	3031	" Kind of us to receive you , Colonel Washington ! "
27225	27242	27222	27223	the widow	3031	" I never heard that when men were unhappy , our sex were less their friends . "
27507	27514	27516	27520	Madame la Presidente de Mouchy	796	" Alas ! my dear friend ! "
27532	27703	27516	27520	Madame la Presidente de Mouchy	796	" How contrary is the destiny to us ! I see you quitting the embrace of an adored mother to precipitate yourself in the arms of Bellona . I see you pass wounded after combats . I hesitate almost to wish victory to our lilies when I behold you ranged under the banners of the Leopard . There are enmities which the heart does not recognise ours assuredly are at peace among the tumults . All here love and salute you , as well as Monsieur the Bear - hunter , your brother that cold Hippolyte who preferred the chase to the soft conversation of our ladies ! Your friend , your enemy , the Chevalier de la Jabotiere , burns to meet on the field of Mars his generous rival . M. Du Quesne spoke of you last night at supper . M. Du Quesne , my husband , send affectuous remembrances to their young friend , with which are ever joined those of your sincere Presidente de Mouchy . "
27704	27711	27516	27520	Madame la Presidente de Mouchy	796	" The banner of the Leopard , "
28739	28742	28744	28745	Mr. Dinwiddie	798	" Oh ! "
28747	28757	28744	28745	Mr. Dinwiddie	798	" those are the sons of the Princess Pocahontas ; "
28770	28777	28766	28767	the General	3644	" Who the deuce was she ? "
29567	29581	29582	29583	the General	3644	" Would not one of the young gentlemen like to see the campaign ? "
29586	29637	29582	29583	the General	3644	" A friend of theirs , who often spoke of them Mr. Washington , who had been unlucky in the affair of last year had already promised to join him as aide - de - camp , and his Excellency would gladly take another young Virginian gentleman into his family . "
29650	29661	29662	29662	he	701	" He would like with all his heart to go ! "
29821	29828	29829	29829	she	2071	" I knew it must happen , "
29832	29860	29829	29829	she	2071	" at such a crisis in the country our family must come forward . Have you have you settled yet which of you is to leave me ? "
29876	29892	29894	29894	Harry	701	" The youngest ought to go , mother ; of course I ought to go ! "
29900	29906	29908	29909	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Of course he ought , "
29918	29930	29933	29933	Harry	701	" There ! Mountain says so ! I told you so ! "
29942	29954	29956	29956	George	694	" The head of the family ought to go , mother , "
29960	29983	29956	29956	George	694	" No ! no ! you are ill , and have never recovered your fever . Ought he to go , Mountain ? "
29984	30050	30051	30051	He	3786	" You would make the best soldier , I know that , dearest Hal . You and George Washington are great friends , and could travel well together , and he does not care for me , nor I for him , however much he is admired in the family . But , you see , ' tis the law of Honour , my Harry . "
30066	30131	30051	30051	He	3786	" The grief I have had in this matter has been that I must refuse thee . I must go . Had Fate given you the benefit of that extra half - hour of life which I have had before you , it would have been your lot , and you would have claimed your right to go first , you know you would . "
30132	30137	30140	30140	Harry	701	" Yes , George , "
30142	30148	30140	30140	Harry	701	" I own I should . "
30149	30223	30224	30225	The mother	3050	" You will stay at home , and take care of Castlewood and our mother . If anything happens to me , you are here to fill my place . I would like to give way , my dear , as you , I know , would lay down your life to serve me . But each of us must do his duty . What would our grandfather say if he were here ? "
30233	30244	30229	30229	her	3050	" My papa would say that his boys were gentlemen , "
30459	30465	30467	30467	he	694	" I know , Mountain , "
30469	30489	30467	30467	he	694	" that Harry would be the better soldier ; but , after all , to go is my duty . "
30490	30497	30499	30499	Mountain	773	" To stay is your duty ! "
30508	30525	30499	30499	Mountain	773	" Why did not my mother own it when we talked of the matter just now ? "
30526	30530	30532	30533	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Your mother ! "
30543	30551	30532	30533	Mrs. Mountain	773	" your mother , my poor child ! "
30552	30564	30499	30499	Mountain	773	" What is the meaning of that mournful countenance , Mountain ? "
30565	30578	30579	30580	Mrs. Mountain	773	" It may be that your mother wishes you away , George ! "
30587	30612	30584	30584	her	773	" It may be , my poor deluded boy , that you will find a father - in - law when you come back . "
30613	30621	30623	30623	George	694	" What in heaven do you mean ? "
30632	30745	30623	30623	George	694	" Do you suppose I have no eyes , and can not see what is going on ? I tell you , child , that Colonel Washington wants a rich wife . When you are gone , he will ask your mother to marry him , and you will find him master here when you come back . That is why you ought not to go away , you poor , unhappy , simple boy ! Do n't you see how fond she is of him ? how much she makes of him ? how she is always holding him up to you , to Harry , to everybody who comes here ? "
30746	30757	30759	30759	George	803	" But he is going on the campaign , too , "
30761	30772	30774	30775	the widow	3031	" He is going on the marrying campaign , child ! "
30777	30799	30774	30775	the widow	3031	" Nay ; General Braddock himself told me that Mr. Washington had accepted the appointment of aide - de - camp . "
30800	30814	30816	30816	Mountain	773	" An artifice ! an artifice to blind you , my poor child ! "
30818	30851	30853	30853	she	3031	" He will be wounded and come back you will see if he does not . I have proofs of what I say to you proofs under his own hand look here ! "
30871	30879	30881	30881	George	803	" How came you by this paper ? "
30887	30898	30900	30901	Mrs. Mountain	773	" I I found it in the Major 's chamber ! "
30908	30922	30924	30924	George	803	" You read the private letters of a guest staying in our house ? "
30926	30938	30940	30940	he	803	" For shame ! I will not look at the paper ! "
30952	31082	30940	30940	he	803	" I could not help it , George ; ' twas by chance , I give you my word , by the merest chance . You know Governor Dinwiddie is to have the Major 's room , and the state - room is got ready for Mr. Braddock , and we are expecting ever so much company , and I had to take the things which the Major leaves here he treats the house just as if it was his own already into his new room , and this half - sheet of paper fell out of his writing - book , and I just gave one look at it by the merest chance , and when I saw what it was it was my duty to read it . "
31083	31095	31096	31096	George	803	" Oh , you are a martyr to duty , Mountain ! "
31100	31117	31096	31096	George	803	" I dare say Mrs. Bluebeard thought it was her duty to look through the keyhole . "
31118	31263	30940	30940	he	803	" I never did look through the keyhole , George . It 's a shame you should say so ! I , who have watched , and tended , and nursed you , like a mother ; who have sate up whole weeks with you in fevers , and carried you from your bed to the sofa in these arms . There , sir , I do n't want you there now . My dear Mountain , indeed ! Do n't tell me ! You fly into a passion , and , call names , and wound my feelings , who have loved you like your mother like your mother ? I only hope she may love you half as well . I say you are all ungrateful . My Mr. Mountain was a wretch , and every one of you is as bad . "
31354	31369	31371	31371	she	3803	" You should thank your stars , child , that I saved the letter , "
31373	31431	31371	31371	she	3803	" See ! here are his own words , in his great big handwriting like a clerk . It was not my fault that he wrote them , or that I found them . Read for yourself , I say , George Warrington , and be thankful that your poor dear old Mounty is watching over you ! "
31460	31469	31470	31470	he	694	" Not a word of this , Mountain , "
31479	31490	31470	31470	he	694	" I I will return this paper to Mr. Washington . "
31535	31542	31544	31544	he	781	" Do you suppose , madam , "
31554	31571	31544	31544	he	781	" that to leave such a tender mother as you does not cause me cruel grief ? "
32012	32050	32056	32056	her	683	" I am glad , at least , that , as my boy is going to make the campaign , he will not be with tradesmen , but with gentlemen , with gentlemen of honour and fashion , "
32149	32164	32166	32167	the widow	3031	" To be with a veteran officer of the finest army in the world , "
32169	32192	32166	32167	the widow	3031	" with gentlemen who have been bred in the midst of the Court ; with friends of his Royal Highness , the Duke "
32218	32298	32202	32202	He	3847	" And with you , dear Colonel Washington , by whom my father always set such store . You do n't know how much he trusted in you . You will take care of my boy , sir , will not you ? You are but five years older , yet I trust to you more than to his seniors ; my father always told the children , I alway bade them , to look up to Mr. Washington . "
32299	32328	32329	32330	The gentleman	3435	" You know I would have done anything to win Colonel Esmond 's favour . Madam , how much would I not venture to merit his daughter 's ? "
32363	32367	32368	32368	she	2586	" Mr. Washington , "
32371	32393	32368	32368	she	2586	" will be always sure of a mother 's affection , whilst he gives so much of his to her children . "
32619	32622	32624	32624	George	694	" No , "
32628	32632	32624	32624	George	694	" Have you ? "
32779	32785	32787	32788	Mr. Braddock	808	" Great God , sir ! "
32794	32830	32787	32788	Mr. Braddock	808	" what would Sir Robert have said in Norfolk , to see a man hunting with a fowling - piece in his hand , and a pack of dogs actually laid on to a turkey ! "
32831	32843	32845	32846	Madam Esmond	683	" Indeed , Colonel , you are vastly comical this afternoon ! "
32868	32888	32855	32856	her son	2799	" What Sir Robert is there at Norfolk ? Is he one of the newly arrived army - gentlemen ? "
32889	32904	32906	32907	Colonel Washington	803	" The General meant Norfolk at home , madam , not Norfolk in Virginia , "
32909	32976	32977	32979	the honest sportsman	3879	" Mr. Braddock had been talking of a visit to Sir Robert Walpole , who lived in that county , and of the great hunts the old Minister kept there , and of his grand palace , and his pictures at Houghton . I should like to see a good field and a good fox - chase at home better than any sight in the world , "
32985	32999	33001	33002	young Esmond	683	" Nevertheless , there is good sport here , as I was saying , "
33008	33012	33014	33015	the other	19802	" What sport ? "
33021	33149	33014	33015	the other	19802	" Why , sure you know , without looking at me so fiercely , and stamping your foot , as if you were going to charge me with the foils . Are you not the best sportsman of the country - side ? Are there not all the fish of the field , and the beasts of the trees , and the fowls of the sea no the fish of the trees , and the beasts of the sea and the bah ! You know what I mean . I mean shad , and salmon , and rock - fish , and roe - deer , and hogs , and buffaloes , and bisons , and elephants , for what I know . I 'm no sportsman . "
33150	33155	33157	33158	Mr. Washington	799	" No , indeed , "
33168	33231	33157	33158	Mr. Washington	799	" Yes , I understand you . I am a milksop . I have been bred at my mamma 's knee . Look at these pretty apron - strings , Colonel ! Who would not like to be tied to them ? See of what a charming colour they are ! I remember when they were black that was for my grandfather . "
33232	33243	33245	33246	the Colonel	19708	" And who would not mourn for such a gentleman ? "
33259	33296	33245	33246	the Colonel	19708	" And , indeed , I wish my grandfather were here , and would resurge , as he promises to do on his tombstone ; and would bring my father , the Ensign , with him . "
33297	33302	33304	33305	Mrs. Esmond	780	" Ah , Harry ! "
33351	33358	33360	33361	Madam Esmond	683	" Oh , Harry , Harry ! "
33370	33377	33379	33379	Harry	701	" What is it , mother ? "
33387	33395	33379	33379	Harry	701	" What is the matter , Colonel ? "
33396	33408	33410	33411	the Colonel	19708	" Upon my life , it would puzzle me to say , "
33417	33446	33410	33411	the Colonel	19708	" A mere question , Hal , about pink ribbons , which I think vastly becoming to our mother ; as , no doubt , the Colonel does . "
33447	33458	33460	33461	the Colonel	19708	" Sir , will you please to speak for yourself ? "
33473	33481	33483	33484	the widow	3031	" He speaks too much for himself , "
33486	33508	33510	33510	George	803	" I protest I do n't any more know the source of these tears , than the source of the Nile , "
33512	33591	33593	33593	he	803	" and if the picture of my father were to begin to cry , I should almost as much wonder at the paternal tears . What have I uttered ? An allusion to ribbons ! Is there some poisoned pin in them , which has been struck into my mother 's heart by a guilty fiend of a London mantua - maker ? I professed to wish to be led in these lovely reins all my life long , "
33602	33615	33617	33617	Harry	701	" George Warrington ! what devil 's dance are you dancing now ? "
33643	33752	33617	33617	Harry	701	" My dear child , you do not understand dancing you care not for the politer arts you can get no more music out of a spinet than by pulling a dead hog by the ear . By nature you were made for a man a man of war I do not mean a seventy - four , Colonel George , like that hulk which brought the hulking Mr. Braddock into our river . His Excellency , too , is a man of warlike turn , a follower of the sports of the field . I am a milksop , as I have had the honour to say . "
33753	33771	33774	33774	Harry	701	" You never showed it yet . You beat that great Maryland man was twice your size , "
33776	33836	33839	33839	he	701	" Under compulsion , Harry . ' Tis tuptu , my lad , or else ' tis tuptomai , as thy breech well knew when we followed school . But I am of a quiet turn , and would never lift my hand to pull a trigger , no , nor a nose , nor anything but a rose , "
33853	33905	33839	33839	he	701	" I hate sporting , which you and the Colonel love , and I want to shoot nothing alive , not a turkey , nor a titmouse , nor an ox , nor an ass , nor anything that has ears . Those curls of Mr. Washington 's are prettily powdered . "
34003	34011	34013	34013	he	803	" I say one thing , George , "
34019	34027	34029	34030	the other	19802	" Say twenty things , Don Enrico , "
34032	34087	34089	34089	Harry	701	" If you are not fond of sporting and that , and do n't care for killing game and hunting , being cleverer than me , why shouldst thou not stop at home and be quiet , and let me go out with Colonel George and Mr. Braddock ? that 's what I say , "
34124	34148	34150	34150	George	803	" One of our family must go because honneur oblige , and my name being number one , number one must go first , "
34152	34157	34160	34160	Harry	701	" Told you so , "
34162	34192	34160	34160	Harry	701	" One must stay , or who is to look after mother at home ? We can not afford to be both scalped by Indians or fricasseed by French . "
34193	34198	34200	34200	Harry	701	" Fricasseed by French ! "
34202	34232	34200	34200	Harry	701	" the best troops of the world ! Englishmen ! I should like to see them fricasseed by the French ! What a mortal thrashing you will give them ! "
34259	34275	34249	34249	George	803	" Malbrouk s'en va - t - en guerre , Mironton , mironton , mirontaine , "
34289	34309	34282	34286	the gentleman from the balcony	3906	" I am playing ' God save the King , ' Colonel , in compliment to the new expedition . "
34310	34322	34324	34326	the simple gentleman	3907	" I never know whether thou art laughing or in earnest , "
34328	34338	34324	34326	the simple gentleman	3907	" but surely methinks that is not the air . "
34421	34433	34435	34435	George	803	" Colonel Washington knows the way to his room pretty well , "
34452	34462	34464	34465	the widow	3031	" Let me show the Colonel to his chamber , "
34533	34547	34548	34548	he	803	" For heaven 's sake , George , what does this all mean ? "
34553	34562	34548	34548	he	803	" Why should n't he kiss her hand ? "
34581	34592	34563	34563	George	803	" I tell you it is nothing but common kindness . "
34593	34599	34602	34602	George	803	" Nothing but common kindness ! "
34604	34616	34618	34618	he	803	" Look at that , Hal ! Is that common kindness ? "
34656	34716	34618	34618	he	803	" ... is older than myself , but I , again , am older than my years ; and you know , dear brother , have ever been considered a sober person . All children are better for a father 's superintendence , and her two , I trust , will find in me a tender friend and guardian . "
34717	34725	34728	34728	George	803	" Friend and guardian ! Curse him ! "
34739	34791	34728	34728	George	803	" ... The flattering offer which General Braddock hath made me , will , of course , oblige me to postpone this matter until after the campaign . When we have given the French a sufficient drubbing , I shall return to repose under my own vine and fig - tree . "
34792	34802	34803	34803	George	803	" He means Castlewood . These are his vines , "
34819	34858	34803	34803	George	803	" ... Under my own vine and fig - tree ; where I hope soon to present my dear brother to his new sister - in - law . She has a pretty Scripture name , which is ... "
34865	34870	34871	34871	George	803	" Which is Rachel , "
34876	34926	34871	34871	George	803	" Rachel is by no means weeping for her children , and has every desire to be comforted . Now , Harry ! Let us upstairs at once , kneel down as becomes us , and say , ' Dear papa , welcome to your house of Castlewood . ' "
35133	35163	35164	35164	his	706	" ' Twas extraordinary how a person of such humble origin should have acquired such a variety of learning and such a politeness of breeding too , Mr. Franklin ! "
35295	35369	35286	35287	Mr. Braddock	808	" As for education , there were gentlemen of the army , by George , who did n't know whether they should spell bull with two b 's or one . He had heard the Duke of Marlborough was no special good penman . He had not the honour of serving under that noble commander his Grace was before his time but he thrashed the French soundly , although he was no scholar . "
35381	35389	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" Nor is my Duke a scholar , "
35394	35415	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" aha , Mr. Postmaster , you have heard that , too I see by the wink in your eye . "
35450	35496	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" He 's no scholar , but he is a match for any French general that ever swallowed the English for fricassee de crapaud . He saved the crown for the best of kings , his royal father , his Most Gracious Majesty King George . "
35517	35585	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" He is the soldier 's best friend , and has been the uncompromising enemy of all beggarly red - shanked Scotch rebels and intriguing Romish Jesuits who would take our liberty from us , and our religion , by George . His Royal Highness , my gracious master , is not a scholar neither , but he is one of the finest gentlemen in the world . "
35586	35607	35609	35610	Mr. Franklin	706	" I have seen his Royal Highness on horseback , at a review of the Guards , in Hyde Park , "
35612	35624	35609	35610	Mr. Franklin	706	" The Duke is indeed a very fine gentleman on horseback . "
35625	35669	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" You shall drink his health to - day , Postmaster . He is the best of masters , the best of friends , the best of sons to his royal old father ; the best of gentlemen that ever wore an epaulet . "
35670	35681	35683	35684	Mr. Franklin	706	" Epaulets are quite out of my way , sir , "
35688	35698	35683	35684	Mr. Franklin	706	" You know I live in a Quaker City . "
35699	35795	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" Of course they are out of your way , my good friend . Every man to his business . You , and gentlemen of your class , to your books , and welcome . We do n't forbid you ; we encourage you . We , to fight the enemy and govern the country . Hey , gentlemen ? Lord ! what roads you have in this colony , and how this confounded coach plunges ! Who have we here , with the two negro boys in livery ? He rides a good gelding . "
35796	35802	35804	35809	the aide - de - camp	3959	" It is Mr. Washington , "
35811	35824	35826	35827	the General	3644	" I would like him for a corporal of the Horse Grenadiers , "
35829	35848	35826	35827	the General	3644	" He has a good figure on a horse . He knows the country too , Mr. Franklin . "
35849	35854	35392	35393	Mr. Braddock	808	" Yes , indeed . "
35855	35887	35826	35827	the General	3644	" And is a monstrous genteel young man , considering the opportunities he has had . I should have thought he had the polish of Europe , by George I should . "
35888	35894	35896	35897	Mr. Franklin	706	" He does his best , "
36023	36067	36283	36283	his	3644	" Yes , he is mighty well for a provincial , upon my word . He was beat at Fort What - d'ye - call - um last year , down by the Thingamy river . What 's the name on't , Talmadge ? "
36068	36075	36077	36077	Talmadge	822	" The Lord knows , sir , "
36079	36096	36077	36077	Talmadge	822	" and I dare say the Postmaster , too , who is laughing at us both . "
36097	36102	36283	36283	his	3644	" Oh , Captain ! "
36103	36141	36283	36283	his	3644	" Was caught in a regular trap . He had only militia and Indians with him . Good day , Mr. Washington . A pretty nag , sir . That was your first affair , last year ? "
36142	36152	36154	36155	the gentleman	3435	" That at Fort Necessity ? Yes , sir , "
36185	36202	36170	36172	natty negro grooms	3968	" I began ill , sir , never having been in action until that unlucky day . "
36203	36240	36283	36283	his	3644	" You were all raw levies , my good fellow . You should have seen our militia run from the Scotch , and be cursed to them . You should have had some troops with you . "
36241	36257	36259	36260	Mr. Washington	799	" Your Excellency knows ' tis my passionate desire to see and serve with them , "
36262	36275	36277	36278	the General	3644	" By George , we shall try and gratify you , sir , "
37366	37414	37429	37430	the judge	4038	" I have kept for your Excellency the jowl of this salmon . I will take no denial ! Mr. Franklin , you drink only water , sir , though our cellar has wholesome wine which gives no headaches . Mr. Justice , you love woodcock pie ? "
37415	37424	37426	37427	Mr. Laws	827	" Because I know who makes the pastry , "
37437	37480	37426	37427	Mr. Laws	827	" I wish , madam , we had such a happy knack of pastry at home as you have at Castlewood . I often say to my wife , ' My dear , I wish you had Madam Esmond 's hand . ' "
37481	37498	37500	37503	Mr. Postmaster of Boston	4039	" It is a very pretty hand ; I am sure others would like it too , "
37520	37531	37533	37534	the Judge	4038	" Such a hand for a light pie - crust , "
37536	37545	37547	37547	he	4038	" and my service to you , madam . "
37908	37912	37905	37905	she	683	" His Majesty , "
38087	38092	38093	38093	she	4073	" Ah , madam ! "
38096	38230	38093	38093	she	4073	" it may be an honour , as you say , to have the King 's representative in my house , and our family has received greater personages than Mr. Braddock . But he comes to take one of my sons away from me . Who knows whether my boy will return , or how ? I dreamed of him last night as wounded , and quite white , with blood streaming from his side . I would not be so ill - mannered as to let my grief be visible before the gentlemen ; but , my good Mrs. Justice , who has parted with children , and who has a mother 's heart of her own , would like me none the better , if mine were very easy this evening . "
38274	38291	38292	38292	she	4079	" It will be time enough , madam , to be sorry when they are gone , "
38304	38398	38292	38292	she	4079	" My boy must not see me following him with a wistful face , and have our parting made more dismal by my weakness . It is good that gentlemen of his rank and station should show themselves where their country calls them . That has always been the way of the Esmonds , and the same Power which graciously preserved my dear father through twenty great battles in the Queen 's time , I trust and pray , will watch over my son now his turn is come to do his duty . "
38472	38539	38468	38469	Madam Esmond	683	" It would improve and amuse the boys to be with the English gentlemen . Such society was very rarely to be had in their distant province , and though their conversation sometimes was free , she was sure that gentleman and men of fashion would have regard to the youth of her sons , and say nothing before them which young people should not hear . "
38577	38612	38564	38564	Nathan	729	" No ! she would give no more the common Bordeaux they might have , and welcome , if they still wanted more but she would not give any more of the Colonel 's . "
38631	38644	38646	38647	Mrs. Mountain	773	" besides ale , cider , Burgundy , Lisbon , and Madeira , "
38752	38756	38758	38759	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Master George ! "
38761	38774	38758	38759	Mrs. Mountain	773	" why , he will sit for days without touching a drop . "
38827	38832	38824	38824	Nathan	729	" Well , well ! "
38838	38861	38863	38863	she	773	" it was right a gentleman should make himself merry in good company , and pass the bottle along with his friends . "
39073	39081	39083	39084	Harry Warrington	701	" He always seemed great to me , "
39102	39247	39083	39084	Harry Warrington	701	" and I never thought of him otherwise than of a hero . When he came over to Castlewood and taught us boys surveying , to see him riding to hounds was as if he was charging an army . If he fired a shot , I thought the bird must come down , and if be flung a net , the largest fish in the river were sure to be in it . His words were always few , but they were always wise ; they were not idle , as our words are , they were grave , sober , and strong , and ready on occasion to do their duty . In spite of his antipathy to him , my brother respected and admired the General as much as I did that is to say , more than any mortal man . "
39443	39452	39453	39453	she	683	" The gentlemen are long over their wine , "
39456	39467	39453	39453	she	683	" gentlemen of the army are always fond of it . "
39468	39484	39486	39487	Mr. Washington	799	" If drinking makes good soldiers , some yonder are distinguishing themselves greatly , madam , "
39489	39504	39486	39487	Mr. Washington	799	" And I dare say the General is at the head of his troops ? "
39505	39512	39514	39515	the Colonel	19708	" No doubt , no doubt , "
39536	39671	39514	39515	the Colonel	19708	" But the General is the General , and it is not for me to make remarks on his Excellency 's doings at table or elsewhere . I think very likely that military gentlemen born and bred at home are different from us of the colonies . We have such a hot sun , that we need not wine to fire our blood as they do . And drinking toasts seems a point of honour with them . Talmadge hiccupped to me I should say , whispered to me just now , that an officer could no more refuse a toast than a challenge , and he said that it was after the greatest difficulty and dislike at first that he learned to drink . He has certainly overcome his difficulty with uncommon resolution . "
39672	39687	39689	39690	the lady	2586	" What , I wonder , can you talk of for so many hours ? "
39692	39779	39689	39690	the lady	2586	" I do n't think I can tell you all we talk of , madam , and I must not tell tales out of school . We talked about the war , and of the force Mr. Contrecoeur has , and how we are to get at him . The General is for making the campaign in his coach , and makes light of it and the enemy . That we shall beat them , if we meet them , I trust there is no doubt . "
39780	39786	39788	39789	the lady	2586	" How can there be ? "
39798	39810	39812	39813	the gentleman	3435	" Mr. Franklin , though he is only from New England , "
39978	39979	39981	39981	my	0	" "
39990	40004	40005	40005	Harry	701	" said the widow , laying her hand on her guest 's arm . "
40035	40036	40030	40030	you	0	" "
40059	40064	40065	40065	He	837	" says Mr. Washington . "
40122	40123	40124	40124	He	837	" "
40167	40168	40164	40164	you	0	" "
40180	40188	40172	40172	I	0	" Mr. Washington said with great fervour . "
40204	40205	40191	40191	I	0	" "
40220	40432	40217	40218	dear friend	4152	" cried the widow , full of thanks and affection . As they pursued their conversation , they had quitted the porch under which they had first began to talk , and where they could hear the laughter and toasts of the gentlemen over their wine , and were pacing a walk on the rough lawn before the house . Young George Warrington , from his place at the head of the table in the dining - room , could see the pair as they passed to and fro , and had listened for some time past , and replied in a very distracted manner to the remarks of the gentlemen round about him , who were too much engaged with their own talk and jokes , and drinking , to pay much attention to their young host 's behaviour . Mr. Braddock loved a song after dinner , and Mr. Danvers , his aide - de - camp , who had a fine tenor voice , was delighting his General with the latest ditty from Marybone Gardens , when George Warrington , jumping up , ran towards the window , and then returned and pulled his brother Harry by the sleeve , who sate with his back towards the window . "
40437	40458	40217	40218	dear friend	4152	" says Harry , who , for his part , was charmed , too , with the song and chorus . "
40461	40478	40217	40218	dear friend	4152	" cried George , with a stamp of his foot , and the younger followed obediently . "
40483	40492	40501	40501	They	4154	" continued George , with a bitter oath . "
40540	40559	40538	40538	papa	19857	" and he pointed to Mr. Washington , who was taking the widow 's hand very tenderly in his .
40762	40766	40767	40767	he	705	" Our mother , "
40770	40815	40767	40767	he	705	" ca n't marry a man with whom one or both of us has been out on the field , and who has wounded us or killed us , or whom we have wounded or killed . We must have him out , Harry . "
40835	40840	40842	40842	he	701	" No , George , "
40844	40900	40842	40842	he	701	" you are right . Mother ca n't marry our murderer ; she wo n't be as bad as that . And if we pink him he is done for . ' Cadit quaestio , ' as Mr. Dempster used to say . Shall I send my boy with a challenge to Colonel George now ? "
40901	40906	40907	40908	the elder	2775	" My dear Harry , "
40923	40934	40916	40916	his	2775	" you are not accustomed to affairs of this sort . "
40935	40938	40940	40940	Harry	701	" No , "
40955	40967	40969	40969	George	803	" We ca n't insult a gentleman in our own house , "
40975	41014	40969	40969	George	803	" the laws of honour forbid such inhospitable treatment . But , sir , we can ride out with him , and , as soon as the park gates are closed , we can tell him our mind . "
41015	41023	41025	41025	Harry	701	" That we can , by George ! "
41033	41046	41025	41025	Harry	701	" and that we will , too . I say , Georgy ... "
41066	41074	41075	41075	Harry	701	" This is my turn , brother , "
41078	41100	41075	41075	Harry	701	" If you go the campaign , I ought to have the other affair . Indeed , indeed , I ought . "
41110	41125	41126	41126	George	803	" Again the head of the house must take the lead , my dear , "
41134	41192	41126	41126	George	803	" If I fall , my Harry will avenge me . But I must fight George Washington , Hal : and ' tis best I should ; for , indeed , I hate him the worst . Was it not he who counselled my mother to order that wretch , Ward , to lay hands on me ? "
41193	41198	41200	41204	the more pacable younger brother	4182	" Ah , George , "
41206	41214	41200	41204	the more pacable younger brother	4182	" you ought to forget and forgive . "
41215	41347	41126	41126	George	803	" Forgive ? Never , sir , as long as I remember . You ca n't order remembrance out of a man 's mind ; and a wrong that was a wrong yesterday must be a wrong to - morrow . I never , of my knowledge , did one to any man , and I never will suffer one , if I can help it . I think very ill of Mr. Ward , but I do n't think so badly of him as to suppose he will ever forgive thee that blow with the ruler . Colonel Washington is our enemy , mine especially . He has advised one wrong against me , and he meditates a greater . I tell you , brother , we must punish him . "
41934	41946	41947	41947	she	683	" Mr. Braddock is a perfect fine gentleman in the morning , "
41961	41983	41947	41947	she	683	" and though my papa did not drink , ' tis certain that many of the best company in England do . "
42109	42118	42106	42107	the negroes	3993	" Huzzay , and God sabe de King , "
42180	42191	42176	42177	Colonel Washington	803	" With my life . You may depend on me , "
42218	42225	42226	42226	he	19708	" Farewell , my dear Harry , "
42229	42250	42226	42226	he	19708	" With you , George , ' tis no adieu . We shall meet in three days at the camp . "
42311	42322	42323	42323	he	705	" Stay yet a moment , and console our mamma , "
42330	42354	42323	42323	he	705	" only the time to get ourselves booted , and my brother and I will ride with you a little way , George . "
42838	42867	42869	42869	Benson	719	" One would think , Squire Harry , ' twas you who was going to leave home and fight the French and Indians , and not Mr. George , "
42871	42882	42884	42884	Harry	701	" I may be alarmed about danger to my brother , "
42886	42908	42884	42884	Harry	701	" though I might bear my own share pretty well . ' Tis not my fault that I stay at home . "
42909	42916	42918	42918	George	694	" No , indeed , brother , "
42920	42931	42933	42934	Mr. Washington	799	" Harry Warrington 's courage does not need any proof ! "
42936	42951	42953	42954	Mr. George	694	" You do the family honour by speaking so well of us , Colonel , "
42961	42975	42953	42954	Mr. George	694	" I dare say we can hold our own , if need be . "
43020	43030	43031	43031	he	701	" You are not going to do it now ? "
43036	43041	43043	43044	Mr. George	694	" Yes , now , "
43049	43089	43043	43044	Mr. George	694	" For God 's sake , let me have the turn . You are going on the campaign , you ought not to have everything and there may be an explanation , George . We may be all wrong . "
43090	43119	43120	43131	A couple of Halkett 's officers , whom our young gentlemen knew	4305	" Psha , how can we ? It must be done now do n't be alarmed . No names shall be mentioned I shall easily find a subject . "
43148	43156	43158	43160	one of them	2353	" What are you conspiring , gentlemen ? "
43162	43168	43158	43160	one of them	2353	" Is it a drink ? "
43194	43201	43202	43202	George	694	" The very thing , sir , "
43206	43226	43202	43202	George	694	" Fresh glasses , Mr. Benson ! What , no glasses ? Then we must have at the bowl . "
43227	43237	43239	43240	Mr. Benson	847	" Many a good man has drunk from it , "
43354	43363	43365	43365	George	803	" Nay , the liquor is paid for , "
43367	43373	43365	43365	George	803	" never fear , Colonel . "
43374	43393	43395	43397	the young Colonel	4317	" I said I was not thirsty . I did not say the liquor was not paid for , "
43404	43430	43432	43432	George	803	" When the King 's health is proposed , an officer can hardly say no . I drink the health of his Majesty , gentlemen , "
43434	43447	43432	43432	George	803	" Colonel Washington can drink it or leave it . The King ! "
43472	43476	43477	43478	Harry Warrington	701	" The King . "
43480	43484	43485	43486	Colonel Washington	803	" The King . "
43507	43514	43504	43505	Captain Grace	848	" The Duke and the Army , "
43528	43535	43523	43524	Colonel Washington	803	" The Duke and the Army . "
43536	43548	43550	43550	George	803	" You do n't seem to stomach the toast , Colonel , "
43552	43565	43567	43568	the Colonel	19708	" I tell you again , I do n't want to drink , "
43570	43595	43567	43568	the Colonel	19708	" It seems to me the Duke and the Army would be served all the better if their healths were not drunk so often . "
43596	43610	43612	43613	Captain Grace	848	" You are not up to the ways of regular troops as yet , "
43621	43628	43612	43613	Captain Grace	848	" May be not , sir . "
43629	43634	43636	43637	Captain Grace	848	" A British officer , "
43646	43686	43636	43637	Captain Grace	848	" never neglects a toast of that sort , nor any other duty . A man who refuses to drink the health of the Duke hang me , such a man should be tried by a court - martial ! "
43687	43701	43703	43704	Colonel Washington	803	" What means this language to me ? You are drunk , sir ! "
43717	43727	43714	43714	his	803	" A cursed provincial officer say I 'm drunk ! "
43733	43741	43730	43731	Captain Grace	848	" Waring , do you hear that ? "
43742	43749	43751	43752	George Warrington	694	" I heard it , sir ! "
43754	43802	43751	43752	George Warrington	694	" We all heard it . He entered at my invitation the liquor called for was mine : the table was mine and I am shocked to hear such monstrous language used at it as Colonel Washington has just employed towards my esteemed guest , Captain Waring . "
43803	43813	43816	43817	Colonel Washington	803	" Confound your impudence , you infernal young jackanapes ! "
43819	43872	43816	43817	Colonel Washington	803	" You dare to insult me before British officers , and find fault with my language ? For months past , I have borne with such impudence from you , that if I had not loved your mother yes , sir , and your good grandfather and your brother I would I would "
43908	43915	43917	43917	George	803	" You would what , sir ? "
43922	43963	43917	43917	George	803	" if you did not love my grandfather , and my brother , and my mother . You are making her petticoat a plea for some conduct of yours you would do what , sir , may I ask again ? "
43964	43988	43990	44006	the Colonel , who had found breath by this time , and vented another explosion of fury	4322	" I would put you across my knee and whip you , you snarling little puppy , that 's what I would do ! "
44008	44036	44039	44039	Harry	701	" Because you have known us all our lives , and made our house your own , that is no reason you should insult either of us ! "
44044	44070	44039	44039	Harry	701	" What you have said , George Washington , is an insult to me and my brother alike . You will ask pardon , sir ! "
44071	44074	44039	44039	Harry	701	" Pardon ? "
44075	44087	44089	44089	Harry	701	" Or give us the reparation that is due to gentlemen , "
44153	44159	44160	44160	he	701	" I I am bewildered , "
44163	44195	44160	44160	he	701	" My words , perhaps , were very hasty . What has been the meaning of George 's behaviour to me for months back ? Only tell me , and , perhaps "
44225	44244	44245	44245	he	701	" You are shirking from the question , sir , as you did from the toast just now , "
44248	44276	44245	44245	he	701	" I am not a boy to suffer under your arrogance . You have publicly insulted me in a public place , and I demand a reparation . "
44277	44286	44288	44289	Mr. Washington	799	" In Heaven 's name , be it ! "
44299	44306	44308	44309	Captain Grace	848	" And you have insulted me , "
44315	44353	44308	44309	Captain Grace	848	" What was it he said ? Confound the militia captain colonel , what is he ? You 've insulted me ! Oh , Waring ! to think I should be insulted by a captain of militia ! "
44370	44378	44379	44380	the Colonel	19708	" I insult you , you hog ! "
44421	44427	44429	44430	Captain Waring	850	" Great Powers , sir ! "
44432	44461	44429	44430	Captain Waring	850	" are three affairs not enough for you , and must I come into the quarrel , too ? You have a quarrel with these two young gentlemen . "
44462	44468	44470	44471	poor Harry	701	" Hasty words , sir ! "
44475	44481	44470	44471	poor Harry	701	" Hasty words , sir ! "
44486	44744	44483	44484	Captain Waring	850	" A gentleman tells another gentleman that he will put him across his knees and whip him , and you call those hasty words ? Let me tell you if any man were to say to me , ' Charles Waring , ' or ' Captain Waring , I 'll put you across my knees and whip you , ' I 'd say , ' I 'll drive my cheese - toaster through his body , ' if he were as big as Goliath , I would . That 's one affair with young Mr. George Warrington . Mr. Harry , of course , as a young man of spirit , will stand by his brother . That 's two . Between Grace and the Colonel apology is impossible . And , now run me through the body ! you call an officer of my regiment of Halkett 's , sir ! a hog before my face ! Great heavens , sir ! Mr. Washington , are you all like this in Virginia ? Excuse me , I would use no offensive personality , as , by George ! I will suffer none from any man ! but , by Gad , Colonel ! give me leave to tell you that you are the most quarrelsome man I ever saw in my life . Call a disabled officer of my regiment for he is disabled , ai n't you , Grace ? call him a hog before me ! You withdraw it , sir you withdraw it ? "
44745	44760	44762	44763	the Colonel	19708	" Is this some infernal conspiracy in which you are all leagued against me ? "
44765	44818	44762	44763	the Colonel	19708	" It would seem as if I was drunk , and not you , as you all are . I withdraw nothing . I apologise for nothing . By heavens ! I will meet one or half a dozen of you in your turn , young or old , drunk or sober . "
44819	44831	44833	44835	Mr. George Warrington	694	" I do not wish to hear myself called more names , "
44837	44864	44833	44835	Mr. George Warrington	694	" This affair can proceed , sir , without any further insult on your part . When will it please you to give me the meeting ? "
44865	44873	44875	44876	the Colonel	19708	" The sooner the better , sir ! "
44882	44888	44875	44876	the Colonel	19708	" The sooner the better , "
44943	44949	44962	44962	his	848	" The sooner the better ! "
44973	44990	44991	44993	the militia Colonel	4336	" At any rate , this gentleman 's business will keep cool till to - morrow , "
45004	45019	44991	44993	the militia Colonel	4336	" You will hardly bring your man out to - day , Captain Waring ? "
45020	45033	45035	45035	Waring	850	" I confess that neither his hand nor mine are particularly steady , "
45037	45041	45043	45044	Mr. Warrington	694	" Mine is ! "
45063	45073	45074	45074	Washington	799	" Be it so with what weapon , sir ? "
45078	45109	45074	45074	Washington	799	" Not with small - swords , Colonel . We can beat you with them . You know that from our old bouts . Pistols had better be the word . "
45110	45137	45139	45140	the Colonel	19708	" As you please , George Warrington and God forgive you , George ! God pardon you , Harry ! for bringing me into this quarrel , "
45163	45220	45157	45157	George	694	" I , sir ? It was not I who called names , who talked of a cane , who insulted a gentleman in a public place before gentlemen of the army . It is not the first time you have chosen to take me for a negro , and talked of the whip for me . "
45239	45255	45157	45157	George	694	" Great heavens , George ! is it that boyish quarrel you are still recalling ? "
45256	45265	45267	45268	the boy	2227	" Who made you the overseer of Castlewood ? "
45274	45323	45267	45268	the boy	2227	" I am not your slave , George Washington , and I never will be . I hated you then , and I hate you now . And you have insulted me , and I am a gentleman , and so are you . Is that not enough ? "
45324	45332	45334	45335	the Colonel	19708	" Too much , only too much , "
45350	45367	45267	45268	the boy	2227	" Do you bear malice too , Harry ? I had not thought this of thee ! "
45368	45375	45377	45377	Harry	701	" I stand by my brother , "
45404	45417	45418	45418	he	701	" Heaven be good to us ! ' Tis all clear now , "
45423	45442	45443	45443	he	701	" The time to write a few letters , and I am at your service , Mr. Warrington , "
45446	45482	45443	45443	he	701	" You have your own pistols at your saddle . I did not ride out with any ; but will send Sady back for mine . That will give you time enough , Colonel Washington ? "
45483	45490	45492	45493	each gentleman	4348	" Plenty of time , sir . "
45555	45565	45567	45568	my landlord	2423	" It is not altogether their fault , Colonel , "
45577	45668	45567	45568	my landlord	2423	" Jack Firebrace and Tom Humbold of Spotsylvania was here this morning , chanting horses with 'em . And Jack and Tom got 'em to play cards ; and they did n't win the British Captains did n't . And Jack and Tom challenged them to drink for the honour of Old England , and they did n't win at that game , neither , much . They are kind , free - handed fellows when they are sober , but they are a pretty pair of fools they are . "
45669	45705	45707	45708	the Colonel	19708	" Captain Benson , you are an old frontier man , and an officer of ours , before you turned farmer and taverner . You will help me in this matter with yonder young gentlemen ? "
45710	45808	45707	45708	the Colonel	19708	" I 'll stand by and see fair play , Colonel . I wo n't have no hand in it , beyond seeing fair play . Madam Esmond has helped me many a time , tended my poor wife in her lying - in , and doctored our Betty in the fever . You ai n't a - going to be very hard with them poor boys ? Though I seen 'em both shoot : the fair one hunts well , as you know , but the old one 's a wonder at an ace of spades . "
45809	45853	45855	45856	the Captain	2104	" Will you be pleased to send my man with my valise , Captain , into any private room which you can spare me ? I must write a few letters before this business comes on . God grant it were well over ! "
46250	46262	46264	46266	the affrighted secretary	4388	" My dear , dear George , do n't say that ! "
46268	46278	46279	46279	George	694	" ' As probably will be the case , ' "
46285	46340	46279	46279	George	694	" You know what a good shot Colonel George is , Harry . I , myself , am pretty fair at a mark , and ' tis probable that one or both of us will drop . ' I scarcely suppose you will carry out the intentions you have at present in view . ' "
46369	46476	46361	46361	Harry	701	" You see I say nothing ; Madame Esmond 's name does not even appear in the quarrel . Do you not remember in our grandfather 's life of himself , how he says that Lord Castlewood fought Lord Mohun on a pretext of a quarrel at cards ? and never so much as hinted at the lady 's name , who was the real cause of the duel ? I took my hint , I confess , from that , Harry . Our mother is not compromised in the Why , child , what have you been writing , and who taught thee to spell ? "
46483	46487	46477	46477	Harry	701	" in view , "
46512	46524	46526	46526	George	803	" I ca n't think about the spelling now , Georgy , "
46530	46553	46526	46526	George	803	" I 'm too miserable for that . I begin to think , perhaps it 's all nonsense , perhaps Colonel George never "
46554	46623	46625	46627	the young man	2122	" Never meant to take possession of Castlewood ; never gave himself airs , and patronised us there ; never advised my mother to have me flogged , never intended to marry her ; never insulted me , and was insulted before the king 's officers ; never wrote to his brother to say we should be the better for his parental authority ? The paper is there , "
46635	46654	46625	46627	the young man	2122	" and if anything happens to me , Harry Warrington , you will find it on my corse ! "
46655	46666	46668	46668	Harry	701	" Write yourself , Georgy , I ca n't write , "
46850	46861	46863	46863	George	803	" The watch , of course , will be yours , "
46878	46909	46863	46863	George	803	" Why , two hours and a - half are gone ! ' Tis time that Sady should be back with the pistols . Take the watch , Harry dear . "
46910	46916	46919	46919	Harry	701	" It 's no good ! "
46928	46957	46919	46919	Harry	701	" If he fights you , I 'll fight him , too . If he kills my Georgy , him , he shall have a shot at me ! "
47050	47065	47067	47070	the boys ' informant	4411	" And one , young gentleman , is for your mother , Madam Esmond , "
47715	47723	47726	47727	Master Harry	701	" Sady , sir , come here ! "
47729	47738	47740	47741	Master George	694	" Sady , come here ! Confound you ! "
47767	47773	47775	47775	Sady	815	" Come directly , mas'r , "
47842	47854	47838	47838	He	815	" Comin ' , mas'r . Everybody a - comin ' . "
47922	47937	47938	47941	A chorus of negroes	4461	" O Lor ! O Golly ! Hoop ! Here dey come ! Hurray ! "
47945	47950	47938	47941	A chorus of negroes	4461	" Here dey are ! "
48034	48043	48025	48026	George Warrington	694	" What do you do here , madam ? "
48056	48080	48048	48048	her	773	" Oh , George , my darling ! It 's a mistake ! It 's a mistake , and is all my fault ! "
48081	48087	48089	48089	George	694	" What 's a mistake ? "
48098	48105	48107	48107	Harry	701	" What is it , Mounty ? "
48114	48165	48107	48107	Harry	701	" That paper I took out of his portfolio , that paper I picked up , children ; where the Colonel says he is going to marry a widow with two children . Who should it be but you , children , and who should it be but your mother ? "
48166	48169	48048	48048	her	773	" Well ? "
48170	48300	48107	48107	Harry	701	" Well , it 's it 's not your mother . It 's that little widow Custis whom the Colonel is going to marry . He 'd always take a rich one ; I knew he would . It 's not Mrs. Rachel Warrington . He told Madam so to - day , just before he was going away , and that the marriage was to come off after the campaign . And and your mother is furious , boys . And when Sady came for the pistols , and told the whole house how you were going to fight , I told him to fire the pistols off ; and I galloped after him , and I 've nearly broken my poor old bones in coming to you . "
48301	48312	48314	48314	George	694	" I have a mind to break Mr. Sady 's , "
48316	48328	48314	48314	George	694	" I specially enjoined the villain not to say a word . "
48329	48337	48339	48340	poor Harry	701	" Thank God he did , brother ! "
48342	48348	48339	48340	poor Harry	701	" Thank God he did ! "
48349	48375	48377	48378	Mr. George	694	" What will Mr. Washington and those gentlemen think of my servant telling my mother at home that I was going to fight a duel ? "
48384	48394	48396	48396	Harry	701	" You have shown your proofs before , George , "
48400	48449	48396	48396	Harry	701	" And , thank Heaven , you are not going to fight our old friend , our grandfather 's old friend . For it was a mistake and there is no quarrel now , dear , is there ? You were unkind to him under a wrong impression . "
48450	48459	48461	48461	George	694	" I certainly acted under a wrong impression , "
48463	48465	48461	48461	George	694	" but "
48466	48472	48473	48473	Harry	701	" George ! George Washington ! "
48602	48611	48599	48599	he	19708	" Thank God , thank God for this ! "
48612	48617	48619	48619	Harry	701	" Oh , George , "
48634	48647	48648	48649	The other	19802	" how I wish I was going with you on the campaign ! "
48722	48735	48736	48736	George	803	" I find I have done you a wrong , Colonel Washington , "
48739	48762	48736	48736	George	803	" and must apologise , not for the error , but for much of my late behaviour which has resulted from it . "
48763	48799	48801	48802	Mrs. Mountain	773	" The error was mine ! It was I who found that paper in your room , and showed it to George , and was jealous of you , Colonel . All women are jealous , "
48804	48822	48824	48825	Mr. Washington	799	" ' Tis a pity you could not have kept your eyes off my paper , madam , "
48827	49001	48824	48825	Mr. Washington	799	" You will permit me to say so . A great deal of mischief has come because I chose to keep a secret which concerned only myself and another person . For a long time George Warrington 's heart has been black with anger against me , and my feeling towards him has , I own , scarce been more friendly . All this pain might have been spared to both of us , had my private papers only been read by those for whom they were written . I shall say no more now , lest my feelings again should betray me into hasty words . Heaven bless thee , Harry ! Farewell , George ! And take a true friend 's advice , and try and be less ready to think evil of your friends . We shall meet again at the camp , and will keep our weapons for the enemy . Gentlemen ! if you remember this scene to - morrow , you will know where to find me . "
49158	49161	49188	49188	she	683	" The King "
49191	49199	49188	49188	she	683	" We beseech Thee to hear us , "
49291	49298	49299	49300	Mrs. Mountain	773	" when Mr. George comes home . "
49711	49988	49694	49694	he	701	" It must be owned that the provinces are acting scurvily by his Majesty King George II . , and his representative here is in a flame of fury . Virginia is bad enough , and poor Maryland not much better , but Pennsylvania is worst of all . We pray them to send us troops from home to fight the French ; and we promise to maintain the troops when they come . We not only do n't keep our promise , and make scarce any provision for our defenders , but our people insist upon the most exorbitant prices for their cattle and stores , and actually cheat the soldiers who are come to fight their battles . No wonder the General swears , and the troops are sulky . The delays have been endless . Owing to the failure of the several provinces to provide their promised stores and means of locomotion , weeks and months have elapsed , during which time , no doubt , the French have been strengthening themselves on our frontier and in the forts they have turned us out of . Though there never will be any love lost between me and Colonel Washington , it must be owned that your favourite I am not jealous , Hal is a brave man and a good officer . The family respect him very much , and the General is always asking his opinion . Indeed , he is almost the only man who has seen the Indians in their war - paint , and I own I think he was right in firing upon Mons . Jumonville last year . "
50264	50265	50266	50266	I	0	" "
50282	50292	50293	50293	I	0	" says Madam Esmond , laying her teacup down . "

50322	50365	50320	50320	Monstrous	863	" says Mountain , with a queer look . Dempster keeps his eyes steadily fixed on his glass of punch . Harry looks as if he was choking with laughter , or with some other concealed emotion , but his mother says , "
50397	50401	50402	50402	We	4548	" Harry resumes : "
50523	50524	50519	50521	the poor fellow	2992	" "

50609	50651	50602	50607	the squaws and and hum ha	4565	" Here Mr. Harry pauses , as not caring to proceed with the narrative , in the presence of little Fanny , very likely , who sits primly in her chair by her mother 's side , working her little sampler . "
50661	50680	50602	50607	the squaws and and hum ha	4565	" says Madam . And Harry commences , in a loud tone , a much more satisfactory statement : "
50811	50812	50793	50793	He	3644	" "
50816	50820	50793	50793	He	3644	" asks Mountain ; "

50847	50855	50845	50845	Harry	701	" cries the mistress of the house . "
50906	50907	50897	50898	Mr. Dempster	760	" "

51117	51123	51112	51113	A stepfather	4590	" cries Harry 's mother . "
51201	51202	51174	51174	I	0	" "
51209	51220	51174	51174	I	0	" Harry continued , reading from his brother 's journal , "
51368	51556	51351	51352	our General	4609	" When our march is over , you should see our camp , and all the care bestowed on it . Our baggage and our General 's tents and guard are placed quite in the centre of the camp . We have outlying sentries by twos , by threes , by tens , by whole companies . At the least surprise , they are instructed to run in on the main body and rally round the tents and baggage , which are so arranged themselves as to be a strong fortification . Sady and I , you must know , are marching on foot now , and my horses are carrying baggage . The Pennsylvanians sent such rascally animals into camp that they speedily gave in . What good horses were left , ' twas our duty to give up : and Roxana has a couple of packs upon her back instead of her young master . She knows me right well , and whinnies when she sees me , and I walk by her side , and we have many a talk together on the march . "
51761	52629	51757	51759	GEORGE E. WARRINGTON	868	" The whole land was now lying parched and scorching in the July heat . For ten days no news had come from the column advancing on the Ohio . Their march , though it toiled but slowly through the painful forest , must bring them ere long up with the enemy ; the troops , led by consummate captains , were accustomed now to the wilderness , and not afraid of surprise . Every precaution had been taken against ambush . It was the outlying enemy who were discovered , pursued , destroyed , by the vigilant scouts and skirmishers of the British force . The last news heard was that the army had advanced considerably beyond the ground of Mr. Washington 's discomfiture on the previous year , and two days after must be within a day 's march of the French fort . About taking it no fears were entertained ; the amount of the French reinforcements from Montreal was known . Mr. Braddock , with his two veteran regiments from Britain , and their allies of Virginia and Pennsylvania , were more than a match for any troops that could be collected under the white flag . Such continued to be the talk , in the sparse towns of our Virginian province , at the gentry 's houses , and the rough roadside taverns , where people met and canvassed the war . The few messengers who were sent back by the General reported well of the main force . ' Twas thought the enemy would not stand or defend himself at all . Had he intended to attack , he might have seized a dozen occasions for assaulting our troops at passes through which they had been allowed to go entirely free . So George had given up his favourite mare , like a hero as he was , and was marching afoot with the line ? Madam Esmond vowed that he should have the best horse in Virginia or Carolina in place of Roxana . There were horses enough to be had in the provinces , and for money . It was only for the King 's service that they were not forthcoming . Although at their family meetings and repasts the inmates of Castlewood always talked cheerfully , never anticipating any but a triumphant issue to the campaign , or acknowledging any feeling of disquiet , yet , it must be owned they were mighty uneasy when at home , quitting it ceaselessly , and for ever on the trot from one neighbour 's house to another in quest of news . It was prodigious how quickly reports ran and spread . When , for instance , a certain noted border warrior , called Colonel Jack , had offered himself and his huntsmen to the General , who had declined the ruffian 's terms or his proffered service , the defection of Jack and his men was the talk of thousands of tongues immediately . The house negroes , in their midnight gallops about the country , in search of junketing or sweethearts , brought and spread news over amazingly wide districts . They had a curious knowledge of the incidents of the march for a fortnight at least after its commencement . They knew and laughed at the cheats practised on the army , for horses , provisions , and the like ; for a good bargain over the foreigner was not an unfrequent or unpleasant practice among New Yorkers , Pennsylvanians , or Marylanders ; though ' tis known that American folks have become perfectly artless and simple in later times , and never grasp , and never overreach , and are never selfish now . For three weeks after the army 's departure , the thousand reports regarding it were cheerful ; and when our Castlewood friends met at their supper , their tone was confident and their news pleasant . But on the 10th of July a vast and sudden gloom spread over the province . A look of terror and doubt seemed to fall upon every face . Affrighted negroes wistfully eyed their masters and retired , and hummed and whispered with one another . The fiddles ceased in the quarters : the song and laugh of those cheery black folk were hushed . Right and left , everybody 's servants were on the gallop for news . The country taverns were thronged with horsemen , who drank and cursed and brawled at the bars , each bringing his gloomy story . The army had been surprised . The troops had fallen into an ambuscade , and had been cut up almost to a man . All the officers were taken down by the French marksmen and the savages . The General had been wounded , and carried off the field in his sash . Four days afterwards the report was that the General was dead , and scalped by a French Indian . Ah , what a scream poor Mrs. Mountain gave , when Gumbo brought this news from across the James River , and little Fanny sprang crying to her mother 's arms ! "
52643	53051	52630	52632	Lord God Almighty	792	" said Mrs. Esmond , sinking down on her knees , and lifting her rigid hands to Heaven . The gentlemen were not at home when this rumour arrived , but they came in an hour or two afterwards , each from his hunt for news . The Scots tutor did not dare to look up and meet the widow 's agonising looks . Harry Warrington was as pale as his mother . It might not be true about the manner of the General 's death but he was dead . The army had been surprised by Indians , and had fled , and been killed without seeing the enemy . An express had arrived from Dunbar 's camp . Fugitives were pouring in there . Should he go and see ? He must go and see . He and stout little Dempster armed themselves and mounted , taking a couple of mounted servants with them . They followed the northward track which the expeditionary army had hewed out for itself , and at every step which brought them nearer to the scene of action , the disaster of the fearful day seemed to magnify . The day after the defeat a number of the miserable fugitives from the fatal battle of the 9th July had reached Dunbar 's camp , fifty miles from the field . Thither poor Harry and his companions rode , stopping stragglers , asking news , giving money , getting from one and all the same gloomy tale a thousand men were slain two - thirds of the officers were down all the General 's aides - de - camp were hit . Were hit ? but were they killed ? Those who fell never rose again . The tomahawk did its work upon them . O brother , brother ! All the fond memories of their youth , all the dear remembrances of their childhood , the love and the laughter , the tender romantic vows which they had pledged to each other as lads , were recalled by Harry with pangs inexpressibly keen . Wounded men looked up and were softened by his grief : rough women melted as they saw the woe written on the handsome young face : the hardy old tutor could scarcely look at him for tears , and grieved for him even more than for his dear pupil who lay dead under the savage Indian knife .
53480	53499	53500	53500	Harry	873	" Ah , George ! If you had loved him you would have found him dead or alive , "
53697	53710	53712	53713	the guide	4668	" Keep your hair for your lady mother , my young gentleman , "
53715	53728	53712	53713	the guide	4668	" ' Tis enough that she loses one son in this campaign . "
53936	53946	53928	53928	her	4681	" Why have you not brought George back too ? "
53980	53995	53997	53998	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Whatever could be done , we know you would do , Mr. Dempster , "
54005	54048	53997	53998	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Make a curtsey to Mr. Dempster , Fanny , and remember , child , to be grateful to all who have been friendly to our benefactors . Will it please you to take any refreshment before you ride , Colonel Washington ? "
54079	54104	54105	54106	Mr. Washington	799	" The time to feed my horse , and a glass of water for myself , and I will trouble Castlewood hospitality no further , "
54109	54131	54105	54106	Mr. Washington	799	" Sure , George , you have your room here , and my mother is above - stairs getting it ready ! "
54135	54153	54133	54133	Harry	873	" That poor horse of yours stumbled with you , and ca n't go farther this evening . "
54154	54166	54168	54169	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Hush ! Your mother wo n't see him , child , "
54171	54187	54189	54189	Harry	873	" Not see George ? Why , he is like a son of the house , "
54191	54259	54189	54189	Harry	873	" She had best not see him . I do n't meddle any more in family matters , child : but when the Colonel 's servant rode in , and said you were coming , Madam Esmond left this room , my dear , where she was sitting reading Drelincourt , and said she felt she could not see Mr. Washington . Will you go to her ? "
54403	54509	54398	54398	George	873	" My poor child ! How thin thou art grown how haggard you look ! Never mind . A mother 's care will make thee well again . ' Twas nobly done to go and brave sickness and danger in search of your brother . Had others been as faithful , he might be here now . Never mind , my Harry ; our hero will come back to us , I know he is not dead . One so good , and so brave , and so gentle , and so clever as he was , I know is not lost to us altogether . "
54531	54553	54527	54527	her	2340	" Dry up thy tears , my dear ! He will come back to us , I know he will come . "
54711	54752	54754	54754	Harry	873	" He gave me his bed when I was ill , mother ; and if our George is alive , how has George Washington a hand in his death ? Ah ! please God it be only as you say , "
54759	54780	54782	54783	Madam Esmond	683	" If your brother returns , as return he will , it will not be through Mr. Washington 's help , "
54785	54803	54782	54783	Madam Esmond	683	" He neither defended George on the field , nor would he bring him out of it . "
54804	54815	54817	54817	Harry	873	" But he tended me most kindly in my fever , "
54819	54852	54817	54817	Harry	873	" He was yet ill when he gave up his bed to me , and was thinking only of his friend , when any other man would have thought only of himself . "
54853	54861	54863	54864	the lady	2586	" A friend ! A pretty friend ! "
54866	54952	54863	54864	the lady	2586	" Of all his Excellency 's aides - de - camp , my gentleman is the only one who comes back unwounded . The brave and noble fall , but he , to be sure , is unhurt . I confide my boy to him , the pride of my life , whom he will defend with his , forsooth ! And he leaves my George in the forest , and brings me back himself ! Oh , a pretty welcome I must give him ! "
54953	54957	54959	54959	Harry	873	" No gentleman , "
54963	54974	54959	54959	Harry	873	" was ever refused shelter under my grandfather 's roof . "
54975	54981	54983	54985	the little widow	4709	" Oh no no gentleman ! "
54987	55016	54983	54985	the little widow	4709	" let us go down , if you like , son , and pay our respects to this one . Will you please to give me your arm ? "
55073	55086	55087	55087	she	4709	" I wish that our meeting had been happier , Colonel Washington , "
55090	55106	55108	55109	the Colonel	19708	" You do not grieve more than I do that it is otherwise , madam , "
55111	55199	55087	55087	she	4709	" I might have wished that the meeting had been spared , that I might not have kept you from friends whom you are naturally anxious to see , that my boy 's indisposition had not detained you . Home and his good nurse Mountain , and his mother and our good Doctor Dempster , will soon restore him . ' Twas scarce necessary , Colonel , that you , who have so many affairs on your hands , military and domestic , should turn doctor too . "
55200	55219	55221	55222	the Colonel	19708	" Harry was ill and weak , and I thought it was my duty to ride by him , "
55224	55246	55248	55249	the widow	3031	" You yourself , sir , have gone through the fatigues and dangers of the campaign in the most wonderful manner , "
55264	55282	55248	55249	the widow	3031	" I wish to Heaven , madam , some one else had come back in my place ! "
55283	55494	55259	55259	her	3031	" Nay , sir , you have ties which must render your life more than ever valuable and dear to you , and duties to which , I know , you must be anxious to betake yourself . In our present deplorable state of doubt and distress , Castlewood can be a welcome place to no stranger , much less to you , and so I know , sir , you will be for leaving us ere long . And you will pardon me if the state of my own spirits obliges me for the most part to keep my chamber . But my friends here will bear you company as long as you favour us , whilst I nurse my poor Harry upstairs . Mountain , you will have the cedar - room on the ground - floor ready for Mr. Washington , and anything in the house is at his command . Farewell , sir . Will you be pleased to present my compliments to your mother , who will be thankful to have her son safe and sound out of the war , as also to my young friend Martha Custis , to whom and to whose children I wish every happiness . Come , my son ! "
56309	56463	56299	56299	she	4077	" For shame to say so ! For shame upon you , ungrateful boy , forgetting the dearest , noblest , most perfect of brothers , for that tall , gawky , fox - hunting Colonel , with his horrid oaths ! How can he be George 's murderer , when I say my boy is not dead ? He is not dead , because my instinct never deceived me : because , as sure as I see his picture now before me , only ' tis not near so noble or so good as he used to look , so surely two nights running did my papa appear to me in my dreams . You doubt about that , very likely ? ' Tis because you never loved anybody sufficiently , my poor Harry ; else you might have leave to see them in dreams , as has been vouchsafed to some . "
56464	56473	56475	56475	Harry	873	" I think I loved George , mother , "
56477	56494	56475	56475	Harry	873	" I have often prayed that I might dream about him , and I do n't . "
56495	56530	56299	56299	she	4077	" How you can talk , sir , of loving George , and then go and meet your Mr. Washington at horse - races , I ca n't understand ! Can you , Mountain ? "
56531	56590	56592	56592	Mountain	773	" We ca n't understand many things in our neighbours ' characters . I can understand that our boy is unhappy , and that he does not get strength , and that he is doing no good here , in Castlewood , or moping at the taverns and court - houses with horse - coupers and idle company , "
56624	56633	56635	56635	Harry	873	" I can not tell how it came , "
56672	56961	56658	56658	he	873	" but since that fatal day of July , last year , and my return home , my mother never has been the same woman . She seemed to love none of us as she used . She was for ever praising George , and yet she did not seem as if she liked him much when he was with us . She hath plunged , more deeply than ever , into her books of devotion , out of which she only manages to extract grief and sadness , as I think . Such a gloom has fallen over our wretched Virginian house of Castlewood , that we all grew ill , and pale as ghosts , who inhabited it . Mountain told me , madam , that , for nights , my mother would not close her eyes . I have had her at my bedside , looking so ghastly , that I have started from my own sleep , fancying a ghost before me . By one means or other she has wrought herself into a state of excitement which if not delirium , is akin to it . I was again and again struck down by the fever , and all the Jesuits ' bark in America could not cure me . We have a tobacco - house and some land about the new town of Richmond , in our province , and went thither , as Williamsburg is no wholesomer than our own place ; and there I mended a little , but still did not get quite well , and the physicians strongly counselled a sea - voyage . My mother , at one time , had thoughts of coming with me , but "
56972	57057	56964	56965	the lad	2434	" we did not agree very well , though I know we loved each other very heartily , and ' twas determined that I should see the world for myself . So I took passage in our ship from the James River , and was landed at Bristol . And ' twas only on the 9th of July , this year , at sea , as had been agreed between me and Madam Esmond , that I put mourning on for my dear brother . "
57863	57883	57896	57896	her	881	" Ah , if she could have had a son like that , how she would have loved him ! "
57884	57887	57889	57889	Conscience	881	" Wait , "
57898	57967	57889	57889	Conscience	881	" wait , Beatrix Esmond ! You know you will weary of this inclination , as you have of all . You know , when the passing fancy has subsided , that the boy may perish , and you wo n't have a tear for him ; or talk , and you weary of his stories ; and that your lot in life is to be lonely lonely . "
58112	58128	58130	58131	Madam Beatrix	882	" Well , you will see that my half - sister will never forgive him , "
58133	58173	58130	58131	Madam Beatrix	882	" And you need not be surprised , sir , at women taking a fancy to men younger than themselves ; for do n't I dote upon you ; and do n't all these Castlewood people crevent with jealousy ? "
58513	58529	58531	58533	Madame de Bernstein	723	" You wonder , my dear Maria , that the boy should be so polite ? "
58535	58570	58531	58533	Madame de Bernstein	723	" His mother was bred up by two very perfect gentlefolks . Colonel Esmond had a certain grave courteousness , and a grand manner , which I do not see among the gentlemen nowadays . "
58571	58601	58531	58533	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Eh , my dear , we all of us praise our own time ! My grandmamma used to declare there was nothing like Whitehall and Charles the Second . "
58602	58700	58531	58533	Madame de Bernstein	723	" My mother saw King James the Second 's court for a short while , and though not a court - educated person , as you know , her father was a country clergyman yet was exquisitely well - bred . The Colonel , her second husband , was a person of great travel and experience , as well as of learning , and had frequented the finest company of Europe . They could not go into their retreat and leave their good manners behind them , and our boy has had them as his natural inheritance . "
58701	58949	58950	58950	She	4870	" Nay , excuse me , my dear , for thinking you too partial about your mother . She could not have been that perfection which your filial fondness imagines . She left off liking her daughter my dear creature , you have owned that she did and I can not fancy a complete woman who has a cold heart . No , no , my dear sister - in - law ! Manners are very requisite , no doubt , and , for a country parson 's daughter , your mamma was very well I have seen many of the cloth who are very well . Mr. Sampson , our chaplain , is very well . Dr. Young is very well . Mr. Dodd is very well ; but they have not the true air as how should they ? I protest , I beg pardon ! I forgot my lord bishop , your ladyship 's first choice . But , as I said before , to be a complete woman , one must have , what you have , what I may say and bless Heaven for , I think I have a good heart . Without the affections , all the world is vanity , my love ! I protest I only live , exist , eat , drink , rest , for my sweet , sweet children ! for my wicked Willy , for my self - willed Fanny , dear naughty loves ! "
58969	59010	59011	59011	Mimi	719	" Yes , Mimi ! yes , Fanchon ! you know I do , you dear , dear little things ! and if they were to die , or you were to die , your poor mistress would die too ! "
59043	59078	59091	59092	the Baroness	2319	" No , my dear ! For nothing do I bless Heaven so much though it puts me to excruciating torture very often as for having endowed me with sensibility and a feeling heart ! "
59079	59089	59091	59092	the Baroness	2319	" You are full of feeling , dear Anna , "
59094	59120	59091	59092	the Baroness	2319	" You are celebrated for your sensibility . You must give a little of it to our American nephew cousin I scarce know his relationship . "
59121	59329	59091	59092	the Baroness	2319	" Nay , I am here but as a guest in Castlewood now . The house is my Lord Castlewood 's , not mine , or his lordship 's whenever he shall choose to claim it . What can I do for the young Virginian that has not been done ? He is charming . Are we even jealous of him for being so , my dear ? and though we see what a fancy the Baroness de Bernstein has taken for him , do your ladyship 's nephews and nieces your real nephews and nieces cry out ? My poor children might be mortified , for indeed , in a few hours , the charming young man has made as much way as my poor things have been able to do in all their lives : but are they angry ? Willy hath taken him out to ride . This morning , was not Maria playing the harpsichord whilst my Fanny taught him the minuet ? ' Twas a charming young group , I assure you , and it brought tears into my eyes to look at the young creatures . Poor lad ! we are as fond of him as you are , dear Baroness ! "
59396	59405	59407	59408	the Countess	2315	" Bravi , bravi ! Oh , charming ! "
59470	59496	59498	59499	Mr. William	725	" Infernal young Choctaw ! Is he teaching Fanny the war - dance ? and is Fan going to try her tricks upon him now ? "
59521	59533	59534	59534	She	721	" Are you going to try your tricks upon him now ? "
59565	59589	59595	59595	she	721	" Nay , go on dancing , young people ! Do n't let me spoil sport , and let me play for you , "
59604	59613	59615	59615	Harry	701	" I do n't know how to dance , "
59635	59650	59615	59615	Harry	701	" And Fanny was teaching you ? Go on teaching him , dearest Fanny ! "
59651	59657	59659	59659	William	725	" Go on , do ! "
59666	59679	59681	59681	Harry	701	" I I had rather not show off my awkwardness in company , "
59686	59709	59681	59681	Harry	701	" When I know how to dance a minuet , be sure I will ask my cousin to walk one with me . "
59710	59725	59727	59728	the Countess	2315	" That will be very soon , dear Cousin Warrington , I am certain , "
59736	59744	59746	59747	Mr. William	725	" What game is she hunting now ? "
59800	59804	59805	59805	she	721	" You booby ! "
59812	59846	59805	59805	she	721	" You double idiot ! What are you going to do with the Huron ? You do n't want to marry a creature like that , and be a squaw in a wigwam ? "
59847	59853	59855	59856	Lady Fanny	724	" Do n't , mamma ! "
59871	59881	59858	59858	Mamma	894	" I am sure our cousin is very well , "
59885	59892	59858	59858	Mamma	894	" and you said so yourself . "
59893	59970	59805	59805	she	721	" Very well ! Yes ; and heir to a swamp , a negro , a log - cabin and a barrel of tobacco ! My Lady Frances Esmond , do you remember what your ladyship 's rank is , and what your name is , and who was your ladyship 's mother , when , at three days ' acquaintance , you commence dancing a pretty dance , indeed with this brat out of Virginia ? "
59971	59978	59980	59981	Lady Fanny	724	" Mr. Warrington is our cousin , "
59983	60025	59980	59981	Lady Fanny	724	" A creature come from nobody knows where is not your cousin ! How do we know he is your cousin ? He may be a valet who has taken his master 's portmanteau , and run away in his postchaise . "
60026	60037	60039	60039	Fanny	724	" But Madame de Bernstein says he is our cousin , "
60041	60051	60039	60039	Fanny	724	" and he is the image of the Esmonds . "
60052	60141	59980	59981	Lady Fanny	724	" Madame de Bernstein has her likes and dislikes , takes up people and forgets people ; and she chooses to profess a mighty fancy for this young man . Because she likes him to - day , is that any reason why she should like him to - morrow ? Before company , and in your aunt 's presence , your ladyship will please to be as civil to him as necessary ; but , in private , I forbid you to see him or encourage him . "
60142	60158	60161	60162	Lady Fanny	724	" I do n't care , madam , whether your ladyship forbids me or not ! "
60172	60204	60161	60162	Lady Fanny	724	" Very good , Fanny ! then I speak to my lord , and we return to Kensington . If I ca n't bring you to reason , your brother will . "
61404	61413	61415	61416	his lordship	2243	" Sampson has been strong to - day , "
61418	61428	61415	61416	his lordship	2243	" He has assaulted the Philistines in great force . "
61429	61434	61436	61436	Harry	701	" Beautiful , beautiful ! "
61438	61464	61466	61466	William	725	" Bet five to four it was his Assize sermon . He has been over to Winton to preach , and to see those dogs , "
61529	61540	61542	61543	Mr. William	725	" Come up , and tell us about those dogs , "
61681	61688	61690	61691	Virginian Harry	901	" Tell me about my uncle , "
61693	61700	61702	61703	English Will	902	" Tell us about those dogs ! "
61709	61800	61702	61703	English Will	902	" Two more jolly dogs , two more drunken dogs , saving your presence , Mr. Warrington , than Sir Miles and his son , I never saw . Sir Miles was a staunch friend and neighbour of Sir Robert 's . He can drink down any man in the county , except his son and a few more . The other dogs about which Mr. William is anxious , for Heaven hath made him a prey to dogs and all kinds of birds , like the Greeks in the Iliad "
61801	61810	61812	61812	Harry	701	" I know that line in the Iliad , "
61816	61829	61812	61812	Harry	701	" I only know five more , but I know that one . "
61839	61865	61835	61835	He	701	" Ah , my dear brother George knew all the Iliad and all the Odyssey , and almost every book that was ever written besides ! "
61866	61870	61872	61872	he	701	" What on earth "
61879	61886	61888	61888	Will	902	" are you talking about now ? "
61939	61950	61925	61926	Mr. William	725	" Have you brought any news of it , Parson ? "
61951	61964	61966	61967	the parson	2199	" The odds are five to four on Brilliant against the field , "
61971	61983	61966	61967	the parson	2199	" but , mind you , Jason is a good horse . "
61984	61988	61990	61991	my lord	2193	" Whose horse ? "
61993	62006	62008	62009	the divine	4948	" Duke of Ancaster 's . By Cartouche out of Miss Langley , "
62011	62023	62008	62009	the divine	4948	" Have you horse - races in Virginia , Mr. Warrington ? "
62024	62029	62031	62031	Harry	701	" Have n't we ! "
62033	62046	62031	62031	Harry	701	" but oh ! I long to see a good English race ! "
62047	62056	62058	62058	his	2193	" Do you do you bet a little ? "
62061	62069	62071	62071	Harry	701	" I have done such a thing , "
62076	62093	62096	62097	Mr. William	725	" I 'll take Brilliant even against the field , for ponies with you , cousin ! "
62099	62111	62113	62114	the clergyman	4921	" I 'll give or take three to one against Jason ! "
62116	62128	62130	62130	Harry	701	" I do n't bet on horses I do n't know , "
62148	62161	62163	62164	Mr. William	725	" Had n't you better write home , and ask your mother ? "
62170	62175	62163	62164	Mr. William	725	" Will , Will ! "
62181	62242	62163	62164	Mr. William	725	" our cousin Warrington is free to bet , or not , as he likes . Have a care how you venture on either of them , Harry Warrington . Will is an old file , in spite of his smooth face , and as for Parson Sampson , I defy our ghostly enemy to get the better of him . "
62243	62253	62255	62256	Mr. Sampson	888	" Him and all his works , my lord ! "
62273	62283	62284	62284	he	701	" I 'll tell you what , cousin Will , "
62287	62374	62284	62284	he	701	" I am in the habit of managing my own affairs in my own way , without asking any lady to arrange them for me . And I 'm used to make my own bets upon my own judgment , and do n't need any relations to select them for me , thank you . But as I am your guest , and , no doubt , you want to show me hospitality , I 'll take your bet there . And so Done and Done . "
62375	62378	62380	62380	Will	902	" Done , "
62385	62405	62380	62380	Will	902	" Of course it is the regular odds that 's in the paper which you give me , cousin ? "
62406	62415	62417	62417	Will	902	" Well , no , it is n't , "
62419	62442	62417	62417	Will	902	" The odds are five to four , that 's the fact , and you may have 'em , if you like . "
62443	62464	62380	62380	Will	902	" Nay , cousin , a bet is a bet ; and I take you , too , Mr. Sampson . "
62465	62479	62481	62482	Mr. Sampson	888	" Three to one against Jason . I lay it . Very good , "
62484	62495	62497	62497	Harry	701	" Is it to be ponies too , Mr. Chaplain ? "
62513	62532	62505	62505	he	701	" No , no . Thirty to ten . It is enough for a poor priest to win . "
62533	62546	62548	62548	Harry	701	" Here goes a great slice out of my quarter 's hundred , "
62550	62585	62548	62548	Harry	701	" Well , I sha n't let these Englishmen fancy that I am afraid of them . I did n't begin , but for the honour of Old Virginia I wo n't go back . "
62690	62705	62707	62708	my lord	2193	" I suppose yonder property of yours is a fine one by this time ? "
62712	62725	62727	62727	Harry	701	" I reckon it 's almost as big as an English county , "
62729	62743	62727	62727	Harry	701	" and the land 's as good , too , for many things . "
62760	62763	62765	62766	my lord	2193	" Indeed ! "
62774	62787	62765	62766	my lord	2193	" When it belonged to my father it did not yield much . "
62788	62804	62806	62807	the youth	5012	" Pardon me , my lord . You know how it belonged to your father , "
62813	62827	62806	62807	the youth	5012	" It was because my grandfather did not choose to claim his right . "
62845	62852	62854	62855	my lord	2193	" Of course , of course , "
62859	62878	62880	62881	Harry Warrington	701	" I mean , cousin , that we of the Virginian house owe you nothing but our own , "
62883	62898	62880	62881	Harry Warrington	701	" but our own , and the hospitality which you are now showing me . "
62899	62916	62854	62855	my lord	2193	" You are heartily welcome to both . You were hurt by the betting just now ? "
62917	62920	62922	62923	the lad	2434	" Well , "
62925	63058	62922	62923	the lad	2434	" I am sort o ' hurt . Your welcome , you see , is different to our welcome , and that 's the fact . At home we are glad to see a man , hold out a hand to him , and give him of our best . Here you take us in , give us beef and claret enough , to be sure , and do n't seem to care when we come , or when we go . That 's the remark which I have been making since I have been in your lordship 's house ; I ca n't help telling it out , you see , now ' tis on my mind ; and I think I am a little easier now I have said it . "
63087	63137	62854	62855	my lord	2193	" A la bonne heure ! We are cold to the stranger within and without our gates . We do n't take Mr. Harry Warrington into our arms , and cry when we see our cousin . We do n't cry when he goes away but do we pretend ? "
63138	63158	63160	63160	Harry	701	" No , you do n't . But you try to get the better of him in a bet , "
63164	63206	63160	63160	Harry	701	" Is there no such practice in Virginia , and do n't sporting men there try to overreach one another ? What was that story I heard you telling our aunt , of the British officers and Tom somebody of Spotsylvania ! "
63207	63212	63214	63214	Harry	701	" That 's fair ! "
63216	63267	63214	63214	Harry	701	" That is , it 's usual practice , and a stranger must look out . I do n't mind the parson ; if he wins , he may have , and welcome . But a relation ! To think that my own blood cousin wants money out of me ! "
63268	63319	63160	63160	Harry	701	" A Newmarket man would get the better of his father . My brother has been on the turf since he rode over to it from Cambridge . If you play at cards with him and he will if you will let him he will beat you if he can . "
63320	63327	63329	63329	Harry	701	" Well , I 'm ready ! "
63331	63380	63329	63329	Harry	701	" I 'll play any game with him that I know , or I 'll jump with him , or I 'll ride with him , or I 'll row with him , or I 'll wrestle with him , or I 'll shoot with him there now . "
63396	63406	63390	63390	his	5018	" Anything , but do n't fight with him , "
63411	63427	63429	63430	the lad	2434	" If I do , I 'll whip him ! hanged if I do n't ! "
63450	63458	63459	63459	he	2434	" A hundred pardons , my lord ! "
63473	63531	63459	63459	he	2434	" I talked of ill manners , being angry and hurt just now ; but ' tis doubly ill - mannered of me to show my anger , and boast about my prowess to my own host and kinsman . It 's not the practice with us Americans to boast , believe me , it 's not . "
63532	63541	63543	63544	my lord	2193	" You are the first I ever met , "
63550	63580	63543	63544	my lord	2193	" and I take you at your word . And I give you fair warning about the cards , and the betting , that is all , my boy . "
63581	63598	63600	63601	the boy	2227	" Leave a Virginian alone ! We are a match for most men , we are , "
63626	63661	63609	63609	His	707	" So you can bet fifty guineas , and afford to lose them ? So much the better for you , cousin . Those great Virginian estates yield a great revenue , do they ? "
63662	63680	63682	63682	Harry	701	" More than sufficient for all of us for ten times as many as we are now , "
63684	63692	63694	63695	the lad	2434	" What , he is pumping me , "
63697	63710	63694	63695	the lad	2434	" And your mother makes her son and heir a handsome allowance ? "
63711	63724	63726	63726	Harry	701	" As much as ever I choose to draw , my lord ! "
63728	63739	63726	63726	Harry	701	" Peste ! I wish I had such a mother ! "
63744	63776	63726	63726	Harry	701	" But I have only the advantage of a stepmother , and she draws me . There is the dinner - bell . Shall we go into the eating - room ? "
64477	64483	64485	64486	my lord	2193	" Read that , Will , "
64517	64527	64531	64534	the other fond sister	5074	" Gracious heavens , William ! What has happened ? "
64536	64548	64550	64552	the young man	2122	" Mercy , child , why do you swear so dreadfully ? "
64557	64563	64565	64567	Madame de Bernstein	723	" What 's the matter ? "
64584	64590	64592	64593	Mr. William	725	" Read it , Parson ! "
64611	64618	64620	64621	the chaplain	4987	" Bit , by the Lord ! "
64628	64637	64639	64640	my lord	2193	" Cousin Harry , you are in luck , "
64652	64704	64639	64640	my lord	2193	" The Six Year Old Plate at Huntingdon was won by Jason , beating Brilliant , Pytho , and Ginger . The odds were five to four on Brilliant against the field , three to one against Jason , seven to two against Pytho , and twenty to one against Ginger . "
64705	64723	64725	64726	the parson	2199	" I owe you a half - year 's income of my poor living , Mr. Warrington , "
64728	64740	64725	64726	the parson	2199	" I will pay when my noble patron settles with me . "
64741	64748	64750	64751	Mr. William	725	" A curse upon the luck ! "
64753	64762	64750	64751	Mr. William	725	" that comes of betting on a Sunday , "
64772	64784	64786	64786	Harry	701	" Nay , cousin Will . It was but in jest , "
64788	64800	64786	64786	Harry	701	" I ca n't think of taking my cousin 's money . "
64801	64820	64822	64823	Mr. William	725	" Curse me , sir , do you suppose , if I lose , I ca n't pay ? "
64825	64850	64822	64823	Mr. William	725	" and that I want to be beholden to any man alive ? That is a good joke . Is n't it , Parson ? "
64851	64859	64861	64862	the clergyman	4921	" I think I have heard better , "
64869	64879	64866	64866	William	725	" Hang it , let us have another bowl . "
66175	66182	66183	66183	she	690	" I am old , child , "
66193	66195	66188	66188	She	690	" child "
66201	66224	66188	66188	She	690	" I am a hundred years old . I am seven - and - twenty . I might be your mother almost . "
66231	66260	66227	66227	Harry	701	" Your ladyship might be the mother of all the cupids , I am sure . You do n't look twenty , on my word you do Dot ! "
66671	66682	66683	66685	the young folks	2474	" We shall be merrier when my aunt leaves us , "
66688	66861	66683	66685	the young folks	2474	" We have cause , as you may imagine , for being very civil to her . You know what a favourite she was with our papa ? And with reason . She got him his earldom , being very well indeed at Court at that time with the King and Queen . She commands here naturally , perhaps a little too much . We are all afraid of her : even my elder brother stands in awe of her , and my stepmother is much more obedient to her than she ever was to my papa , whom she ruled with a rod of iron . But Castlewood is merrier when our aunt is not here . At least we have much more company . You will come to us in our gay days , Harry , wo n't you ? Of course you will : this is your home , sir . I was so pleased oh , so pleased when my brother said he considered it was your home ! "
67082	67095	67068	67070	the young gentleman	2119	" My cousin , the Lady Maria , is a perfect Angle . "
67096	67103	67105	67107	little Mr. Dempster	760	" Ille praeter omnes angulus ridet , "
67114	67132	67135	67135	Mountain	773	" The child ca n't be falling in love with his angle , as he calls her ! "
67137	67148	67150	67151	Madam Esmond	683	" Pooh , pooh ! my niece Maria is forty ! "
67153	67181	67150	67151	Madam Esmond	683	" I perfectly well recollect her when I was at home a great , gawky , carroty creature , with a foot like a pair of bellows . "
68552	68563	68565	68566	my lord	2193	" Hang him ! Is he so rich , Molly ? "
68572	68629	68565	68566	my lord	2193	" Then good - bye to our chances with your aunt . The Baroness will be sure to leave him all her money to spite us , and because he does n't want it . Nevertheless , the lad is a good lad enough , and it is not his fault being rich , you know . "
68630	68645	68647	68647	Maria	690	" He is very simple and modest in his habits for one so wealthy , "
68649	68656	68658	68659	my lord	2193	" Rich people often are so , "
68661	68734	68658	68659	my lord	2193	" If I were rich , I often think I would be the greatest miser , and live in rags and on a crust . Depend on it there is no pleasure so enduring as money - getting . It grows on you , and increases with old age . But because I am as poor as Lazarus , I dress in purple and fine linen , and fare sumptuously every day . "
69490	69499	69468	69469	the doctor	5377	" I wish to heaven she would go ! "
69514	69538	69468	69469	the doctor	5377	" She may go to Tunbridge , or she may go to Bath , or she may go to Jericho , for me . "
69539	69553	69555	69556	Lady Castlewood	721	" Shall Fanny and I come with you to Tunbridge , dear Baroness ? "
69565	69605	69607	69608	the Baroness	2319	" Not for worlds , my dear ! The doctor orders me absolute quiet , and if you came I should have the knocker going all day , and Fanny 's lovers would never be out of the house , "
69620	69633	69635	69638	the sentimental Lady Maria	690	" I wish I could be of any service to my aunt ! "
69642	69702	69635	69638	the sentimental Lady Maria	690	" My good child , what can you do for me ? You can not play piquet so well as my maid , and I have heard all your songs till I am perfectly tired of them ! One of the gentlemen might go with me : at least make the journey , and see me safe from highwaymen . "
69703	69719	69721	69722	Mr. Will	913	" I 'm sure , ma'am , I shall be glad to ride with you , "
69724	69738	69740	69742	the young man	2122	" Oh , not you ! I do n't want you , William , "
69746	69788	69740	69742	the young man	2122	" Why do not you offer , and where are your American manners , you ungracious Harry Warrington ? Do n't swear , Will , Harry is much better company than you are , and much better ton too , sir . "
69789	69798	69801	69801	Will	913	" Tong , indeed ! Confound his tong , "
69805	69823	69825	69826	the Baroness	2319	" I dare say I shall be tired of him , as I am of other folks , "
69828	69851	69825	69826	the Baroness	2319	" I have scarcely seen Harry at all in these last days . You shall ride with me to Tunbridge , Harry ! "
69884	69937	69870	69872	Mr. Harry Warrington	701	" I have promised my cousin Castlewood to go over to Hexton Petty Sessions with him to - morrow . He thinks I should see how the Courts here are conducted and and the partridge - shooting will soon begin , and I have promised to be here for that , ma'am . "
69966	69978	69981	69982	Madame Bernstein	780	" You actually refuse to go with me to Tunbridge Wells ? "
69998	70024	69989	69989	her	780	" Not to ride with you , ma'am ; that I will do with all my heart ; but to stay there I have promised ... "
70025	70044	70046	70049	the irate old lady	5391	" Enough , enough , sir ! I can go alone , and do n't want your escort , "
70212	70225	70251	70251	She	5391	" So , in spite of all , you have , madam ? "
70233	70237	70239	70240	Lady Fanny	724	" Have what ? "
70390	70405	70408	70408	she	721	" So you do n't fancy going with the old lady to Tunbridge Wells ? "
70429	70437	70408	70408	she	721	" And small blame to our cousin ! "
70455	70652	70653	70654	My lord	2193	" A young fellow must not have it all idling and holiday . Let him mix up something useful with his pleasures , and go to the fiddles and pump - rooms at Tunbridge or the Bath later . Mr. Warrington has to conduct a great estate in America : let him see how ours in England are carried on . Will hath shown him the kennel and the stables ; and the games in vogue , which I think , cousin , you seem to play as well as your teachers . After harvest we will show him a little English fowling and shooting : in winter we will take him out a - hunting . Though there has been a coolness between us and our aunt - kinswoman in Virginia , yet we are of the same blood . Ere we send our cousin back to his mother , let us show him what an English gentleman 's life at home is . I should like to read with him as well as sport with him , and that is why I have been pressing him of late to stay and bear me company . "
70736	70741	70731	70731	He	2193	" This is true , "
70744	70759	70731	70731	He	2193	" I mean that this statement should be accepted and believed in my family . "
70818	70826	70828	70828	William	725	" What is Castlewood 's game now ? "
70841	70851	70828	70828	William	725	" Stop ! By George , I have it ! "
70852	70857	70828	70828	William	725	" What , William ? "
70858	70883	70828	70828	William	725	" He intends to get him to play , and to win the Virginia estate back from him . That 's what it is ! "
70884	70901	70903	70903	mamma	19850	" But the lad has not got the Virginia estate to pay , if he loses , "
70905	70920	70903	70903	mamma	19850	" If my brother has not some scheme in view , may I be . "
70921	70938	70828	70828	William	725	" Hush ! Of course he has a scheme in view . But what is it ? "
70939	70954	70828	70828	William	725	" He ca n't mean Maria Maria is as old as Harry 's mother , "
70959	70975	70977	70978	Lady Fanny	724	" Pooh ! with her old face and sandy hair and freckled skin ! Impossible ! "
70986	71001	71003	71003	mamma	19850	" Of course , your ladyship had a fancy for the Iroquois , too ! "
71005	71044	71003	71003	mamma	19850	" I trust I know my station and duty better , madam ! If I had liked him , that is no reason why I should marry him . Your ladyship hath taught me as much as that . "
71045	71050	70828	70828	William	725	" My Lady Fanny ! "
71051	71072	71003	71003	mamma	19850	" I am sure you married our papa without liking him . You have told me so a thousand times ! "
71073	71096	71099	71100	Mr. William	725	" And if you did not love our father before marriage , you certainly did not fall in love with him afterwards , "
71106	71133	71099	71100	Mr. William	725	" Fan and I remember how our honoured parents used to fight . Do n't us , Fan ? And our brother Esmond kept the peace . "
71134	71145	71147	71147	mamma	19850	" Do n't recall those dreadful low scenes , William ! "
71149	71185	71147	71147	mamma	19850	" When your father took too much drink , he was like a madman ; and his conduct should be a warning to you , sir , who are fond of the same horrid practice . "
71186	71221	71224	71225	Lady Fanny	724	" I am sure , madam , you were not much the happier for marrying the man you did not like , and your ladyship 's title hath brought very little along with it , "
71227	71337	71224	71225	Lady Fanny	724	" What is the use of a coronet with the jointure of a tradesman 's wife ? how many of them are richer than we are ? There is come lately to live in our Square , at Kensington , a grocer 's widow from London Bridge , whose daughters have three gowns where I have one ; and who , though they are waited on but by a man and a couple of maids , I know eat and drink a thousand times better than we do with our scraps of cold meat on our plate , and our great flaunting , trapesing , impudent , lazy lacqueys ! "
71338	71355	71357	71358	Mr. Will	913	" He ! he ! glad I dine at the palace , and not at home ! "
71398	71412	71414	71415	Lady Frances	724	" Why should I not be happy without any title except my own ? "
71417	71432	71414	71415	Lady Frances	724	" Many people are . I dare say they are even happy in America . "
71433	71489	71500	71501	Lady Fanny	724	" Yes ! with a mother - in - law who is a perfect Turk and Tartar , for all I hear with Indian war - whoops howling all around you and with a danger of losing your scalp , or of being eat up by a wild beast every time you went to church . "
71490	71498	71500	71501	Lady Fanny	724	" I would n't go to church , "
71503	71515	71500	71501	Lady Fanny	724	" You 'd go with anybody who asked you , Fan ! "
71521	71539	71500	71501	Lady Fanny	724	" and so would old Maria , and so would any woman , that 's the fact . "
71548	71561	71564	71565	Madame Bernstein	780	" Pray , good folks , what is all your merriment about ? "
71695	71710	71711	71711	she	780	" If he is not staying for you , for whom is he staying ? "
71714	71763	71711	71711	she	780	" At the houses to which he has been carried , you have taken care not to show him a woman that is not a fright or in the nursery ; and I think the boy is too proud to fall in love with a dairymaid , Will . "
71764	71776	71778	71779	Mr. William	725	" Humph ! That is a matter of taste , ma'am , "
71788	71827	71785	71785	his	725	" Of Mr. William Esmond 's taste , as you say ; but not of yonder boy 's . The Esmonds of his grandfather 's nurture , sir , would not go a - courting in the kitchen . "
71828	71873	71778	71779	Mr. William	725	" Well , ma'am , every man to his taste , I say again . A fellow might go farther and fare worse than my brother 's servants'-hall , and besides Fan , there 's only the maids or old Maria to choose from . "
71874	71879	71785	71785	his	725	" Maria ! Impossible ! "
72049	72059	72060	72060	Will	913	" Impossible , ma'am ! I do n't know , "
72063	72071	72060	72060	Will	913	" My mother warned Fan off him . "
72072	72082	72041	72041	she	5442	" Oh , your mother did warn Fanny off ? "
72083	72090	72041	72041	she	5442	" Certainly , my dear Baroness ! "
72091	72116	72060	72060	Will	913	" Did n't she ? Did n't she pinch Fanny 's arm black - and - blue ? Did n't they fight about it ? "
72117	72127	72130	72132	the implicated ladies	5449	" Nonsense , William ! For shame , William ! "
72137	72196	72130	72132	the implicated ladies	5449	" And now , since we have heard how rich he is , perhaps it is sour grapes , that is all . And now , since he is warned off the young bird , perhaps he is hunting the old one , that 's all . Impossible why impossible ? You know old Lady Suffolk , ma'am ? "
72197	72211	72060	72060	Will	913	" William , how can you speak about Lady Suffolk to your aunt ? "
72223	72242	72041	72041	she	5442	" Because Lady Suffolk was a special favourite at Court ? Well , other folks have succeeded her . "
72243	72246	72248	72250	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Sir ! "
72262	72357	72256	72256	her	723	" So they have , I say ; or who , pray , is my Lady Yarmouth now ? And did n't old Lady Suffolk go and fall in love with George Berkeley , and marry him when she was ever so old ? Nay , ma'am , if I remember right and we hear a deal of town - talk at our table Harry Estridge went mad about your ladyship when you were somewhat rising twenty ; and would have changed your name a third time if you would but have let him . "
72420	72424	72425	72425	she	723	" Au fait , "
72451	72474	72425	72425	she	723	" ' tis not impossible , William , that old folks , and young folks , too , should play the fool . "
72475	72490	72492	72493	Mr. William	725	" But I ca n't understand a young fellow being in love with Maria , "
72495	72534	72492	72493	Mr. William	725	" however he might be with you , ma'am . That 's oter shose , as our French tutor used to say . You remember the Count , ma'am ; he ! he ! and so does Maria ! "
72535	72538	72425	72425	she	723	" William ! "
72539	72606	72492	72493	Mr. William	725	" And I dare say the Count remembers the bastinado Castlewood had given to him . A confounded French dancing - master calling himself a count , and daring to fall in love in our family ! Whenever I want to make myself uncommonly agreeable to old Maria , I just say a few words of parly voo to her . She knows what I mean . "
72607	72619	72621	72623	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Have you abused her to your cousin , Harry Warrington ? "
72625	72643	72645	72645	Will	913	" Well I know she is always abusing me and I have said my mind about her , "
72647	72653	72655	72657	the old lady	2505	" Oh , you idiot ! "
72659	72687	72655	72657	the old lady	2505	" Who but a gaby ever spoke ill of a woman to her sweetheart ? He will tell her everything , and they both will hate you . "
72688	72695	72697	72697	Will	913	" The very thing , ma'am ! "
72705	72797	72697	72697	Will	913	" I had a sort of a suspicion , you see , and two days ago , as we were riding together , I told Harry Warrington a bit of my mind about Maria ; why should n't I , I say ? She is always abusing me , ai n't she , Fan ? And your favourite turned as red as my plush waistcoat wondered how a gentleman could malign his own flesh and blood , and , trembling all over with rage , said I was no true Esmond . "
72798	72817	72819	72820	Lady Castlewood	721	" Why did n't you chastise him , sir , as my lord did the dancing - master ? "
72822	72840	72842	72843	Mr. William	725	" Well , mother , you see that at quarter - staff there 's two sticks used , "
72845	72916	72919	72919	he	725	" and my opinion is , that Harry Warrington can guard his own head uncommonly well . Perhaps that is one of the reasons why I did not offer to treat my cousin to a caning . And now you say so , ma'am , I know he has told Maria . She has been looking battle , murder , and sudden death at me ever since . All which shows "
72925	72931	72919	72919	he	725	" All which shows what ? "
72932	72953	72955	72958	the ingenuous youth here	5457	" That I think we are on the right scent ; and that we 've found Maria the old fox ! "
73029	73071	73073	73075	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Who would sift the matter to the bottom ? Scolding one party or the other was of no avail . Threats only serve to aggravate people in such cases . I never was in danger but once , young people , "
73077	73124	73073	73075	Madame de Bernstein	723	" and I think that was because my poor mother contradicted me . If this boy is like others of his family , the more we oppose him , the more entete he will be ; and we shall never get him out of his scrape . "
73125	73137	73139	73139	Will	913	" Faith , ma'am , suppose we leave him in it ? "
73141	73181	73139	73139	Will	913	" Old Maria and I do n't love each other too much , I grant you ; but an English earl 's daughter is good enough for an American tobacco - planter , when all is said and done . "
73204	73223	73201	73201	Will	913	" You are like the dog in the manger . You do n't want the man yourself , Fanny "
73224	73231	73233	73234	Lady Fanny	724	" I want him , indeed ! "
73243	73260	73240	73240	her	724	" Then why grudge him to Maria ? I think Castlewood wants her to have him . "
73261	73270	73272	73274	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Why grudge him to Maria , sir ? "
73280	73390	73272	73274	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Do you remember who the poor boy is , and what your house owes to his family ? His grandfather was the best friend your father ever had , and gave up this estate , this title , this very castle , in which you are conspiring against the friendless Virginian lad , that you and yours might profit by it . And the reward for all this kindness is , that you all but shut the door on the child when he knocks at it , and talk of marrying him to a silly elderly creature who might be his mother ! He sha n't marry her . "
73391	73405	73240	73240	her	724	" The very thing we were saying and thinking , my dear Baroness ! "
73410	73431	73240	73240	her	724	" Our part of the family is not eager about the match , though my lord and Maria may be . "
73432	73459	73461	73462	Madam Beatrix	882	" You would like him for yourself , now that you hear he is rich and may be richer , young people , mind you that , "
73470	73498	73501	73502	Lady Castlewood	721	" Mr. Warrington may be ever so rich , madam , but there is no need why your ladyship should perpetually remind us that we are poor , "
73508	73555	73501	73502	Lady Castlewood	721	" At least there is very little disparity in Fanny 's age and Mr. Harry 's ; and you surely will be the last to say that a lady of our name and family is not good enough for any gentleman born in Virginia or elsewhere . "
73556	73639	73240	73240	her	724	" Let Fanny take an English gentleman , Countess , not an American . With such a name and such a mother to help her , and with all her good looks and accomplishments , sure , she ca n't fail of finding a man worthy of her . But from what I know about the daughters of this house , and what I imagine about our young cousin , I am certain that no happy match could be made between them . "
73640	73649	73651	73652	Lady Fanny	724	" What does my aunt know about me ? "
73658	73770	73771	73774	The other two ladies	5463	" Only your temper , my dear . You do n't suppose that I believe all the tittle - tattle and scandal which one can not help hearing in town ? But the temper and early education are sufficient . Only fancy one of you condemned to leave St. James 's and the Mall , and live in a plantation surrounded by savages ! You would die of ennui , or worry your husband 's life out with your ill - humour . You are born , ladies , to ornament courts not wigwams . Let this lad go back to his wilderness with a wife who is suited to him . "
74350	74363	74365	74370	the lady of the tambour frame	5497	" Why did you refuse to go with our aunt , cousin ? "
74372	74380	74382	74383	the lad	2434	" Because your ladyship bade me stay , "
74385	74440	74382	74383	the lad	2434	" I bid you stay ! La ! child ! What one says in fun , you take in earnest ! Are all you Virginian gentlemen so obsequious as to fancy every idle word a lady says is a command ? Virginia must be a pleasant country for our sex if it be so ! "
74441	74458	74460	74460	Harry	701	" You said when when we walked in the terrace two nights since , O heaven ! "
74469	74478	74480	74483	the Tambour - frame	5499	" Ah , that sweet night , cousin ! "
74485	74499	74502	74502	Harry	701	" Whe whe when you gave me this rose from your own neck , "
74514	74571	74382	74383	the lad	2434	" which I will never part with with , no , by heavens , whilst this heart continues to beat ! You said , ' Harry , if your aunt asks you to go away , you will go , and if you go , you will forget me . ' Did n't you say so ? "
74572	74577	74579	74580	the Virgin	5500	" All men forget ! "
74586	74601	74603	74603	Harry	701	" In this cold selfish country they may , cousin , not in ours , "
74612	74662	74603	74603	Harry	701	" I had rather have lost an arm almost than refused the old lady . I tell you it went to my heart to say no to her , and she so kind to me , and who had been the means of introducing me to to O heaven ! "
74689	74720	74667	74687	an intervening spaniel , which flies yelping from before the fire , and a rapid advance on the tambour - frame	5501	" Look here , cousin ! If you were to bid me jump out of yonder window , I should do it ; or murder , I should do it . "
74721	74738	74740	74740	Maria	690	" La ! but you need not squeeze one 's hand so , you silly child ! "
74742	74878	74740	74740	Maria	690	" I ca n't help it we are so in the south . Where my heart is , I ca n't help speaking my mind out , cousin and you know where that heart is ! Ever since that evening that O heaven ! I tell you I have hardly slept since I want to do something to distinguish myself to be ever so great . I wish there was giants , Maria , as I have read of in in books , that I could go and fight 'em . I wish you was in distress , that I might help you , somehow . I wish you wanted my blood , that I might spend every drop of it for you . And when you told me not to go with Madame Bernstein ... "
74879	74888	74667	74687	an intervening spaniel , which flies yelping from before the fire , and a rapid advance on the tambour - frame	5501	" I tell thee , child ? never . "
74889	74975	74976	74976	he	5502	" I thought you told me . You said you knew I preferred my aunt to my cousin , and I said then what I say now , ' Incomparable Maria ! I prefer thee to all the women in the world and all the angels in Paradise and I would go anywhere , were it to dungeons , if you ordered me ! ' And do you think I would not stay anywhere , when you only desired that I should be near you ? "
74985	75003	75005	75006	the spinster	5503	" Men always talk in that way that is , that is , I have heard so , "
75011	75059	75005	75006	the spinster	5503	" for what should a country - bred woman know about you creatures ? When you are near us , they say you are all raptures and flames and promises and I do n't know what ; when you are away , you forget all about us . "
75060	75076	75079	75081	the young man	2122	" But I think I never want to go away as long as I live , "
75083	75180	75079	75081	the young man	2122	" I have tired of many things ; not books and that , I never cared for study much , but games and sports which I used to be fond of when I was a boy . Before I saw you , it was to be a soldier I most desired ; I tore my hair with rage when my poor dear brother went away instead of me on that expedition in which we lost him . But now , I only care for one thing in the world , and you know what that is . "
75181	75199	75005	75006	the spinster	5503	" You silly child ! do n't you know I am almost old enough to be ... ? "
75200	75258	75005	75006	the spinster	5503	" I know I know ! but what is that to me ? Has n't your br ... well , never mind who , some of 'em - told me stories against you , and did n't they show me the Family Bible , where all your names are down , and the dates of your birth ? "
75259	75267	75270	75271	Lady Maria	690	" The cowards ! Who did that ? "
75273	75323	75270	75271	Lady Maria	690	" Dear Harry , tell me who did that ? Was it my mother - in - law , the grasping , odious , abandoned , brazen harpy ? Do you know all about her ? How she married my father in his cups the horrid hussey ! and ... "
75324	75332	75334	75336	the wondering Harry	937	" Indeed it was n't Lady Castlewood , "
75338	75345	75347	75349	the infuriate lady	5505	" Then it was my aunt , "
75351	75432	75347	75349	the infuriate lady	5505	" A pretty moralist , indeed ! A bishop 's widow , forsooth , and I should like to know whose widow before and afterwards . Why , Harry , she intrigue : with the Pretender , and with the Court of Hanover , and , I dare say , would with the Court of Rome and the Sultan of Turkey if she had had the means . Do you know who her second husband was ? A creature who ... "
75433	75444	75447	75447	Harry	937	" But our aunt never spoke a word against you , "
75486	75496	75497	75497	she	5506	" Well , well ! I am a fool , "
75500	75512	75497	75497	she	5506	" I want thee to think well of me , Harry ! "
75532	75535	75536	75536	he	937	" Angel ! "
75863	75876	75847	75847	she	5519	" Come , sweet youth ! Hither , hither , rosy Hylas ! "
77382	77435	77363	77364	Lady Maria	690	" Molly , you are going to see Goody Jenkins . You are a charitable soul , my dear . Give Gammer Jenkins this half - crown for me unless our cousin , Warrington , has already given her money . A pleasant walk to you . Let her want for nothing . "
77638	77650	77628	77629	Madame Bernstein	723	" CASTLEWOOD , HAMPSHIRE , ENGLAND , August 5 , 1757 . "
77800	77909	77780	77780	he	756	" Madame the Baroness Bernstein first married a clergyman , Reverend Mr. Tusher , who was so learned and good , and such a favourite of his Majesty , as was my aunt too , that he was made a Bishop . When he died , Our gracious King continued his friendship to my aunt ; who married a Hanoverian nobleman , who occupied a post at the Court and , I believe , left the Baroness very rich . My cousin , my Lord Castlewood , told me so much about her , and I am sure I have found from her the greatest kindness and affection . "
78016	78089	77999	78001	Reverend Mr. Sampson	888	" The kindness of my cousin the Earl improves every day , and by next year 's ship I hope my mother will send his lordship some of our best roll tobacco for tennants and hamms . He is most charatable to the poor . His sister , Lady Maria , equally so . She sits for hours reading good books to the sick : she is most beloved in the village . "
78090	78093	78095	78103	a lady to whom Harry submitted his precious manuscript	5642	" Nonsense ! "
78105	78114	78095	78103	a lady to whom Harry submitted his precious manuscript	5642	" Why do you flatter me , cousin ? "
78115	78127	78129	78129	Harry	701	" You are beloved in the village and out of it , "
78136	78156	78129	78129	Harry	701	" and I have flattered you , as you call it , a little more still , farther on . "
78157	78181	78194	78194	she	690	" There is a sick old woman there , whom Madam Esmond would like , a most raligious , good , old lady . "
78459	78523	78456	78456	Castlewood	721	" Having no more to say , at present , I close with best love and duty to my honoured Mother , and with respects to Mr. Dempster , and a kiss for Fanny , and kind remembrances to Old Gumbo , Nathan , Old and Young Dinah , and the pointer dog and Slut , and all friends , from their well - wisher
78524	78529	78454	78456	my Lord Castlewood	2344	" HENRY ESMOND WARRINGTON . "
78530	78549	78456	78456	Castlewood	721	" Have wrote and sent my duty to my Uncle Warrington in Norfolk . No anser as yet . "
78550	78560	78454	78456	my Lord Castlewood	2344	" I hope the spelling is right , cousin ? "
78577	78590	78592	78593	Lady Maria	690	" ' Tis quite well enough spelt for any person of fashion , "
78608	78640	78592	78593	Lady Maria	690	" One word ' Angel , ' I know , I spelt wrong in writing to my mamma , but I have learned a way of spelling it right , now . "
78641	78649	78667	78668	Mr. Harry	701	" And how is that , sir ? "
78650	78662	78667	78668	Mr. Harry	701	" I think ' tis by looking at you , cousin ; "
79052	79243	79048	79048	she	723	" Complimentary , my dear ! Of course I am . I want to make up with you for having been exceedingly rude to everybody this morning . When I was a child , and my father and mother were alive , and lived here , I remember I used to adopt exactly the same behaviour . If I had been naughty in the morning , I used to try and coax my parents at night . I remember in this very room , at this very table oh , ever so many hundred years ago ! so coaxing my father , and mother , and your grandfather , Harry Warrington ; and there were eels for supper , as we have had them to - night , and it was that dish of collared eels which brought the circumstance back to my mind . I had been just as wayward that day , when I was seven years old , as I am to - day , when I am seventy , and so I confess my sins , and ask to be forgiven , like a good girl . "
79244	79250	79252	79253	the chaplain	4987	" I absolve your ladyship ! "
79262	79310	79252	79253	the chaplain	4987	" But your reverence does not know how cross and ill - tempered I was . I scolded my sister , Castlewood : I scolded her children , I boxed Harry Warrington 's ears : and all because he would not go with me to Tunbridge Wells . "
79311	79331	79333	79334	Mr. Warrington	701	" But I will go , madam ; I will ride with you with all the pleasure in life , "
79336	79384	79333	79334	Mr. Warrington	701	" You see , Mr. Chaplain , what good , dutiful children they all are . ' Twas I alone who was cross and peevish . Oh , it was cruel of me to treat them so ! Maria , I ask your pardon , my dear . "
79385	79397	79399	79399	Maria	690	" Sure , madam , you have done me no wrong , "
79405	79452	79399	79399	Maria	690	" Indeed , I have , a very great wrong , child ! Because I was weary of myself , I told you that your company would be wearisome to me . You offered to come with me to Tunbridge , and I rudely refused you . "
79453	79469	79333	79334	Mr. Warrington	701	" Nay , ma'am , if you were sick , and my presence annoyed you ... "
79509	79541	79488	79488	I	0	" My lord filled himself a glass , and sipped it . Most utterly unconscious did his lordship look . This , then , was the meaning of the previous comedy . "
79558	79570	79571	79571	You	5687	" said Maria , trying to look as happy as possible . "
79605	79606	79597	79597	you	5690	" "
79623	79632	79617	79617	herself	690	" said his lordship , with a bow . "
79653	79664	79646	79646	you	0	" Which sentence , being interpreted , no doubt meant , "
79686	79687	79671	79671	She	5694	" "
79695	79700	79671	79671	She	5694	" sighed Lady Maria . "
79712	79872	79707	79708	Goody Jones	959	" my lord continued . Harry drew pictures with his finger on the table . What delights had he not been speculating on ? What walks , what rides , what interminable conversations , what delicious shrubberies and sweet sequestered summer - houses , what poring over music - books , what moonlight , what billing and cooing , had he not imagined ! Yes , the day was coming . They were all departing my Lady Castlewood to her friends , Madame Bernstein to her waters and he was to be left alone with his divine charmer alone with her and unutterable rapture ! The thought of the pleasure was maddening . That these people were all going away . That he was to be left to enjoy that heaven to sit at the feet of that angel and kiss the hem of that white robe . O Gods ! ' twas too great bliss to be real ! "
79880	79885	79873	79873	I	0	" thought poor Harry . "
79897	79898	79886	79886	I	0	" "
79918	80314	79900	79900	you	0	" said Madame de Bernstein . Harry Warrington hoped the company did not see how red he grew . He tried to keep his voice calm and without tremor . Yes , he would ride with their ladyships , and he was sure they need fear no danger . Danger ! Harry felt he would rather like danger than not . He would slay ten thousand highwaymen if they approached his mistress 's coach . At least , he would ride by that coach , and now and again see her eyes at the window . He might not speak to her , but he should be near her . He should press the blessed hand at the inn at night , and feel it reposing on his as he led her to the carriage at morning . They would be two whole days going to Tunbridge , and one day or two he might stay there . Is not the poor wretch who is left for execution at Newgate thankful for even two or three days of respite ? You see , we have only indicated , we have not chosen to describe , at length , Mr. Harry Warrington 's condition , or that utter depth of imbecility into which the poor young wretch was now plunged . Some boys have the complaint of love favourably and gently . Others , when they get the fever , are sick unto death with it ; or , recovering , carry the marks of the malady down with them to the grave , or to remotest old age . I say , it is not fair to take down a young fellow 's words when he is raging in that delirium . Suppose he is in love with a woman twice as old as himself ; have we not all read of the young gentleman who committed suicide in consequence of his fatal passion for Mademoiselle Ninon de l'Enclos who turned out to be his grandmother ? Suppose thou art making an ass of thyself , young Harry Warrington , of Virginia ! are there not people in England who heehaw too ? Kick and abuse him , you who have never brayed ; but bear with him , all honest fellow - cardophagi : long - eared messmates , recognise a brother - donkey ! "
80329	80334	80335	80335	You	5699	" Madame Bernstein continued . "
80371	80392	80407	80407	I	0	" Harry bowed an acquiescence . A whole week of heaven ! Life was not altogether a blank , then . "
80415	80421	80407	80407	I	0	" the lady graciously added . "
80432	80437	80426	80426	I	0	" sighed out Harry . "
80454	80746	80441	80441	I	0	" he added , eagerly ; and no doubt Mr. Will wondered at his cousin 's taste . As this was to be the last night of cousin Harry 's present visit to Castlewood , cousin Will suggested that he , and his reverence , and Warrington should meet at the quarters of the latter and make up accounts , to which process , Harry , being a considerable winner in his play transactions with the two gentlemen , had no objection . Accordingly , when the ladies retired for the night , and my lord withdrew as his custom was to his own apartments , the three gentlemen all found themselves assembled in Mr. Harry 's little room before the punch - bowl , which was Will 's usual midnight companion . But Will 's method of settling accounts was by producing a couple of fresh packs of cards , and offering to submit Harry 's debt to the process of being doubled or acquitted . The poor chaplain had no more ready cash than Lord Castlewood 's younger brother . Harry Warrington wanted to win the money of neither . Would he give pain to the brother of his adored Maria , or allow any one of her near kinsfolk to tax him with any want of generosity or forbearance ? He was ready to give them their revenge , as the gentlemen proposed . Up to midnight he would play with them for what stakes they chose to name . And so they set to work , and the dice - box was rattled and the cards shuffled and dealt . Very likely he did not think about the cards at all . Very likely he was thinking ; "
80815	80816	80817	80817	You	5714	" "
80873	81041	80864	80864	you	5714	" I imagine volleys of oaths from Mr. William , and brisk pattering of imprecations from his reverence , at the young Virginian 's luck . He won because he did not want to win . Fortune , that notoriously coquettish jade , came to him , because he was thinking of another nymph , who possibly was as fickle . Will and the chaplain may have played against him , solicitous constantly to increase their stakes , and supposing that the wealthy Virginian wished to let them recover all their losings . But this was by no means Harry Warrington 's notion . When he was at home he had taken a part in scores of such games as these whereby we may be led to suppose that he kept many little circumstances of his life mum from his lady mother , and had learned to play and pay . And as he practised fair play towards his friends he expected it from them in return . "
81053	81068	81070	81070	I	0	" he said , in reply to some more oaths and growls of Will , "
81148	81149	81133	81133	you	19751	" "
81158	81162	81133	81133	you	19751	" grumbled Will . "

81375	81559	81365	81365	I	0	" bawls out Will . Harry took the offers of both gentlemen . In the course of ten minutes the horse and the bay mare had both changed owners . Cousin William swore more fiercely than ever . The parson dashed his wig to the ground , and emulated his pupil in the loudness of his objurgations . Mr. Harry Warrington was quite calm , and not the least elated by his triumph . They had asked him to play , and he had played . He knew he should win . O beloved slumbering angel ! he thought , am I not sure of victory when you are kind to me ? He was looking out from his window towards the casement on the opposite side of the court , which he knew to be hers . He had forgot about his victims and their groans , and ill - luck , ere they crossed the court . Under yonder brilliant flickering star , behind yonder casement where the lamp was burning faintly , was his joy , and heart , and treasure .

82410	82426	82407	82407	he	5803	" will wish me to be liberal to all the retainers of the Esmond family . "

83575	83588	83589	83589	he	701	" A gentleman can not refuse a fair game at the cards , "
83592	83637	83589	83589	he	701	" I never wanted to play , nor would have played for money had not my cousin William forced me . As for the chaplain , it went to my heart to win from him , but he was as eager as my cousin . "
83638	83720	83814	83814	my	0	" I know I know ! There is no blame to you , my boy . At Rome you ca n't help doing as Rome does ; and I am very glad that you have been able to give Will a lesson . He is mad about play would gamble his coat off his back and I and the family have had to pay his debts ever so many times . May I ask how much you have won of him ? "
83721	83800	83589	83589	he	701	" Well , some eighteen pieces the first day or two , and his note for a hundred and twenty more , and the brown horse , sixty that makes nigh upon two hundred . But , you know , cousin , all was fair , and it was even against my will that we played at all . Will ai n't a match for me , my lord that is the fact . Indeed he is not . "
83801	83812	83814	83815	my lord	2193	" He is a match for most people , though , "
83817	83827	83814	83815	my lord	2193	" His brown horse , I think you said ? "
83828	83857	83589	83589	he	701	" Yes . His brown horse Prince William , out of Constitution . You do n't suppose I would set him sixty against his bay , my lord ? "
83858	83896	83589	83589	he	701	" Oh , I did n't know . I saw Will riding out this morning ; most likely I did not remark what horse he was on . And you won the black mare from the parson ? "
83897	83919	83814	83815	my lord	2193	" For fourteen . He will mount Gumbo very well . Why does not the rascal come round with the horses ? "
83938	83976	83929	83929	He	701	" When you get to Tunbridge , cousin Harry , you must be on the look - out against sharper players than the chaplain and Will . There is all sorts of queer company at the Wells . "
83977	84000	84005	84005	I	0	" A Virginian learns pretty well to take care of himself , my lord , says Harry , with a knowing nod . "

84209	84308	84195	84195	They	5911	" Harry ran up to bid these ladies a farewell . He made that ceremony very brief , for he was anxious to be off to the charmer of his heart ; and came downstairs to mount his newly - gotten steed , which Gumbo , himself astride on the parson 's black mare , held by the rein . There was Gumbo on the black mare , indeed , and holding another horse . But it was a bay horse , not a brown a bay horse with broken knees an aged , worn - out quadruped . "
84313	84317	84318	84318	Your	19751	" cries Harry . "
84324	84333	84334	84335	This brute	5913	" says the groom , touching his cap . "
84337	84358	84334	84335	This brute	5913	" exclaims the young gentleman , with one or more of those expressions then in use in England and Virginia . "

84443	84486	84487	84488	Mr. William	725	" My lord could not help breaking into a laugh at these words of Sam the groom , whilst Harry , for his part , indulged in a number more of those remarks which politeness does not admit of our inserting here . "
84505	84523	84490	84490	he	725	" said the groom , looking at the young man . Lord Castlewood only laughed the more . "

84618	84714	84594	84594	I	0	" and waving him an adieu , my lord entered into the house , whilst Harry and his companion rode out of the courtyard . The young Virginian was much too eager to rejoin the carriages and his charmer , to remark the unutterable love and affection which Gumbo shot from his fine eyes towards a young creature in the porter 's lodge . When the youth was gone , the chaplain and my lord sate down to finish their breakfast in peace and comfort . The two ladies did not return to this meal . "
84725	84730	84719	84719	Will	913	" says my lord . "
84743	84744	84745	84745	He	913	" "
84758	84767	84745	84745	He	913	" adds the chaplain , with a grin , "

84871	84872	84855	84855	they	5928	" "
84889	84895	84881	84882	Mr. Warrington	701	" said the obsequious chaplain . "
84904	84913	84902	84902	parson	21074	" asks his lordship , with a sneer . "

85055	86147	85049	85049	parson	21074	" said my lord . And with this we leave them peaceable over a pipe of tobacco after breakfast . Harry was in such a haste to join the carriages that he almost forgot to take off his hat , and acknowledge the cheers of the Castlewood villagers : they all liked the lad , whose frank cordial ways and honest face got him a welcome in most places . Legends were still extant in Castlewood , of his grandparents , and how his grandfather , Colonel Esmond , might have been Lord Castlewood , but would not . Old Lockwood at the gate often told of the Colonel 's gallantry in Queen Anne 's wars . His feats were exaggerated , the behaviour of the present family was contrasted with that of the old lord and lady : who might not have been very popular in their time , but were better folks than those now in possession . Lord Castlewood was a hard landlord : perhaps more disliked because he was known to be poor and embarrassed than because he was severe . As for Mr. Will , nobody was fond of him . The young gentleman had had many brawls and quarrels about the village , had received and given broken heads , had bills in the neighbouring towns which he could not or would not pay ; had been arraigned before the magistrates for tampering with village girls , and waylaid and cudgelled by injured husbands , fathers , sweethearts . A hundred years ago his character and actions might have been described at length by the painter of manners ; but the Comic Muse , nowadays , does not lift up Molly Seagrim 's curtain ; she only indicates the presence of some one behind it , and passes on primly , with expressions of horror , and a fan before her eyes . The village had heard how the young Virginian squire had beaten Mr. Will at riding , at jumping , at shooting , and finally at card - playing , for everything is known ; and they respected Harry all the more for this superiority . Above all , they admired him on account of the reputation of enormous wealth which Gumbo had made for his master . This fame had travelled over the whole county , and was preceding him at this moment on the boxes of Madame Bernstein 's carriages , from which the valets , as they descended at the inns to bait , spread astounding reports of the young Virginian 's rank and splendour . He was a prince in his own country . He had gold mines , diamond mines , furs , tobaccos , who knew what , or how much ? No wonder the honest Britons cheered him and respected him for his prosperity , as the noble - hearted fellows always do . I am surprised city corporations did not address him , and offer gold boxes with the freedom of the city he was so rich . Ah , a proud thing it is to be a Briton , and think that there is no country where prosperity is so much respected as in ours ; and where success receives such constant affecting testimonials of loyalty ! So , leaving the villagers bawling , and their hats tossing in the air , Harry spurred his sorry beast , and galloped , with Gumbo behind him , until he came up with the cloud of dust in the midst of which his charmer 's chariot was enveloped . Penetrating into this cloud , he found himself at the window of the carriage . The Lady Maria had the back seat to herself ; by keeping a little behind the wheels , he could have the delight of seeing her divine eyes and smiles . She held a finger to her lip . Madame Bernstein was already dozing on her cushions . Harry did not care to disturb the old lady . To look at his cousin was bliss enough for him . The landscape around him might be beautiful , but what did he heed it ? All the skies and trees of summer were as nothing compared to yonder face ; the hedgerow birds sang no such sweet music as her sweet monosyllables . The Baroness 's fat horses were accustomed to short journeys , easy paces , and plenty of feeding ; so that , ill as Harry Warrington was mounted , he could , without much difficulty , keep pace with his elderly kinswoman . At two o'clock they baited for a couple of hours for dinner . Mr. Warrington paid the landlord generously . What price could be too great for the pleasure which he enjoyed in being near his adored Maria , and having the blissful chance of a conversation with her , scarce interrupted by the soft breathing of Madame de Bernstein , who , after a comfortable meal , indulged in an agreeable half - hour 's slumber ? In voices soft and low , Maria and her young gentleman talked over and over again those delicious nonsenses which people in Harry 's condition never tire of hearing and uttering . They were going to a crowded watering - place , where all sorts of beauty and fashion would be assembled ; timid Maria was certain that amongst the young beauties , Harry would discover some , whose charms were far more worthy to occupy his attention , than any her homely face and figure could boast of . By all the gods , Harry vowed that Venus herself could not tempt him from her side . It was he who for his part had occasion to fear . When the young men of fashion beheld his peerless Maria they would crowd round her car ; they would cause her to forget the rough and humble American lad who knew nothing of fashion or wit , who had only a faithful heart at her service . Maria smiles , she casts her eyes to heaven , she vows that Harry knows nothing of the truth and fidelity of women ; it is his sex , on the contrary , which proverbially is faithless , and which delights to play with poor female hearts . A scuffle ensues ; a clatter is heard among the knives and forks of the dessert ; a glass tumbles over and breaks . An "
86150	86527	86532	86533	Baroness Bernstein	723	" escapes from the innocent lips of Maria , The disturbance has been caused by the broad cuff of Mr. Warrington 's coat , which has been stretched across the table to seize Lady Maria 's hand , and has upset the wine - glass in so doing . Surely nothing could be more natural , or indeed necessary , than that Harry , upon hearing his sex 's honour impeached , should seize upon his fair accuser 's hand , and vow eternal fidelity upon those charming fingers ? What a part they play , or used to play , in love - making , those hands ! How quaintly they are squeezed at that period of life ! How they are pushed into conversation ! what absurd vows and protests are palmed off by their aid ! What good can there be in pulling and pressing a thumb and four fingers ? I fancy I see Alexis laugh , who is haply reading this page by the side of Araminta . To talk about thumbs indeed ! ... Maria looks round , for her part , to see if Madame Bernstein has been awakened by the crash of glass ; but the old lady slumbers quite calmly in her arm - chair , so her niece thinks there can be no harm in yielding to Harry 's gentle pressure . The horses are put to : Paradise is over at least until the next occasion . When my landlord enters with the bill , Harry is standing quite at a distance from his cousin , looking from the window at the cavalcade gathering below . Madame Bernstein wakes up from her slumber , smiling and quite unconscious . With what profound care and reverential politeness Mr. Warrington hands his aunt to her carriage ! how demure and simple looks Lady Maria as she follows ! Away go the carriages , in the midst of a profoundly bowing landlord and waiters ; of country - folks gathered round the blazing inn - sign ; of shopmen gazing from their homely little doors ; of boys and market - folks under the colonnade of the old town - hall ; of loungers along the gabled street . "
86577	87222	87223	87223	I	0	" The cavalcade disappears , and the little town lapses into its usual quiet . The landlord goes back to his friends at the club , to tell how the great folks are going to sleep at The Bush , at Farnham , to - night . The inn dinner had been plentiful , and all the three guests of the inn had done justice to the good cheer . Harry had the appetite natural to his period of life . Maria and her aunt were also not indifferent to a good dinner : Madame Bernstein had had a comfortable nap after hers , which had no doubt helped her to bear all the good things of the meal the meat pies , and the fruit pies , and the strong ale , and the heady port wine . She reclined at ease on her seat of the landau , and looked back affably , and smiled at Harry and exchanged a little talk with him as he rode by the carriage side . But what ailed the beloved being who sate with her back to the horses ? Her complexion , which was exceedingly fair , was further ornamented with a pair of red cheeks , which Harry took to be natural roses . You see , madam , that your surmises regarding the Lady Maria 's conduct with her cousin are quite wrong and uncharitable , and that the timid lad had made no such experiments as you suppose , in order to ascertain whether the roses were real or artificial . A kiss , indeed ! I blush to think you should imagine that the present writer could indicate anything so shocking ! Maria 's bright red cheeks , I say still , continued to blush as it seemed with a strange metallic bloom : but the rest of her face , which had used to rival the lily in whiteness , became of a jonquil colour . Her eyes stared round with a ghastly expression . Harry was alarmed at the agony depicted in the charmer 's countenance ; which not only exhibited pain , but was exceedingly unbecoming . Madame Bernstein also at length remarked her niece 's indisposition , and asked her if sitting backwards in the carriage made her ill , which poor Maria confessed to be the fact . On this , the elder lady was forced to make room for her niece on her own side , and , in the course of the drive to Farnham , uttered many gruff , disagreeable , sarcastic remarks to her fellow - traveller , indicating her great displeasure that Maria should be so impertinent as to be ill on the first day of a journey . When they reached the Bush Inn at Farnham , under which name a famous inn has stood in Farnham town for these three hundred years the dear invalid retired with her maid to her bedroom : scarcely glancing a piteous look at Harry as she retreated , and leaving the lad 's mind in a strange confusion of dismay and sympathy . Those yellow , yellow cheeks , those livid wrinkled eyelids , that ghastly red how ill his blessed Maria looked ! And not only how ill , but how away , horrible thought , unmanly suspicion ! He tried to shut the idea out from his mind . He had little appetite for supper , though the jolly Baroness partook of that repast as if she had had no dinner ; and certainly as if she had no sympathy with her invalid niece . She sent her major - domo to see if Lady Maria would have anything from the table . The servant brought back word that her ladyship was still very unwell , and declined any refreshment . "
87235	87248	87223	87223	I	0	" cried Madame Bernstein , rapping her little hand on the table . "
87273	87287	87290	87290	Maria	690	" Harry was happy to be able to play piquet with his aunt . "
87292	87362	87290	87290	Maria	690	" says Madame Bernstein , drinking from a great glass of negus , ' she takes liberties with herself . She never had a good constitution . She is forty - one years old . All her upper teeth are false , and she ca n't eat with them . Thank Heaven , I have still got every tooth in my head . How clumsily you deal , child ! "
88017	88026	88028	88028	Maria	690	" Let me out ! let me out ! "
88030	88043	88028	88028	Maria	690	" Let me go to him ! let me go to him ! "

Though we parted not very good friends when you went home to Virginia , yet you know how fond we once were . I still , Rachel , have the gold etui your papa gave me when he came to our speech - day at Kensington , and we two performed the quarrel of Brutus and Cassius out of Shakspeare ; and ' twas only yesterday morning I was dreaming that we were both called up to say our lesson before the awful Miss Hardwood , and that I did not know it , and that as usual Miss Rachel Esmond went above me . How well remembered those old days are ! How young we grow as we think of them ! I remember our walks and our exercises , our good King and Queen as they walked in Kensington Gardens , and their court following them , whilst we of Miss Hardwood 's school curtseyed in a row . I can tell still what we had for dinner on each day of the week , and point to the place where your garden was , which was always so much better kept than mine . So was Miss Esmond 's chest of drawers a model of neatness , whilst mine were in a sad condition . Do you remember how we used to tell stories in the dormitory , and Madame Hibou , the French governess , would come out of bed and interrupt us with her hooting ? Have you forgot the poor dancing - master , who told us he had been waylaid by assassins , but who was beaten , it appears , by my lord your brother 's footmen ? My dear , your cousin , the Lady Maria Esmond her papa was , I think , but Viscount Castlewood in those times , has just been on a visit to this house , where you may be sure I did not recall those sad times to her remembrance , about which I am now chattering to Mrs. Esmond .

89151	89462	89463	89463	Your	6026	" I fear I and my girls are sorry that he is so soon to be well . Yesterday evening , as we were at tea , there came a great ringing at our gate , which disturbed us all , as the bell very seldom sounds in this quiet place , unless a passing beggar pulls it for charity ; and the servants , running out , returned with the news , that a young gentleman , who had a fall from his horse , was lying lifeless on the road , surrounded by the friends in whose company he was travelling . At this , my Colonel who is sure the most Samaritan of men ! hastens away , to see how he can serve the fallen traveller , and presently , with the aid of the servants , and followed by two ladies , brings into the house such a pale , lifeless , beautiful , young man ! Ah , my dear , how I rejoice to think that your child has found shelter and succour under my roof ! that my husband has saved him from pain and fever , and has been the means of restoring him to you and health ! We shall be friends again now , shall we not ? I was very ill last year , and ' twas even thought I should die . Do you know , that I often thought of you then , and how you had parted from me in anger so many years ago ? I began then a foolish note to you , which I was too sick to finish , to tell you that if I went the way appointed for us all , I should wish to leave the world in charity with every single being I had known in it .

89961	90478	90482	90482	you	6065	" Nature has written a letter of credit upon some men 's faces , which is honoured almost wherever presented . Harry Warrington 's countenance was so stamped in his youth . His eyes were so bright , his cheek so red and healthy , his look so frank and open , that almost all who beheld him , nay , even those who cheated him , trusted him . Nevertheless , as we have hinted , the lad was by no means the artless stripling he seemed to be . He was knowing enough with all his blushing cheeks ; perhaps more wily and wary than he grew to be in after - age . Sure , a shrewd and generous man who has led an honest life and has no secret blushes for his conscience grows simpler as he grows older ; arrives at his sum of right by more rapid processes of calculation ; learns to eliminate false arguments more readily , and hits the mark of truth with less previous trouble of aiming , and disturbance of mind . Or is it only a senile delusion , that some of our vanities are cured with our growing years , and that we become more just in our perceptions of our own and our neighbour 's shortcomings ? ... I would humbly suggest that young people , though they look prettier , have larger eyes , and not near so many wrinkles about their eyelids , are often as artful as some of their elders . What little monsters of cunning your frank schoolboys are ! How they cheat mamma ! how they hoodwink papa ! how they humbug the housekeeper ! how they cringe to the big boy for whom they fag at school ! what a long lie and five years ' hypocrisy and flattery is their conduct towards Dr. Birch ! And the little boys ' sisters ? Are they any better , and is it only after they come out in the world that the little darlings learn a trick or two ? You may see , by the above letter of Mrs. Lambert , that she , like all good women and , indeed , almost all bad women , was a sentimental person ; and , as she looked at Harry Warrington laid in her best bed , after the Colonel had bled him and clapped in his shoulder , as holding by her husband 's hand she beheld the lad in a sweet slumber , murmuring a faint inarticulate word or two in his sleep , a faint blush quivering on his cheek , she owned he was a pretty lad indeed , and confessed with a sort of compunction that neither of her two boys Jack who was at Oxford , and Charles who was just gone back to school after the Bartlemytide holidays was half so handsome as the Virginian . What a good figure the boy had ! and when papa bled him , his arm was as white as any lady 's ! "

90514	90564	90482	90482	you	6065	" said the Colonel , looking at his own honest face in a little looking - glass with a cut border and a japanned frame , by which the chief guests of the worthy gentleman and lady had surveyed their patches and powder , or shaved their hospitable beards . "

91015	91016	90985	90986	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" "
91058	91063	91043	91043	he	6094	" asked the wife . "
91081	91082	91078	91079	Mr. Lambert	1000	" "
91100	91101	91097	91097	I	0	" "
91163	91164	91169	91169	you	983	" "
91240	91329	91200	91200	You	983	" So saying , the honest gentleman put his wife 's arm under his , and they descended together the broad oak staircase of the comfortable old hall , round which hung the effigies of many foregone Lamberts , worthy magistrates , soldiers , country gentlemen , as was the Colonel whose acquaintance we have just made . The Colonel was a gentleman of pleasant , waggish humour . The French lesson which he and his daughters conned together was a scene out of Monsieur Moliere 's comedy of "
91332	91416	91417	91417	ORGON	988	" and papa was pleased to be very facetious with Miss Theo , by calling her Madam , and by treating her with a great deal of mock respect and ceremony . The girls read together with their father a scene or two of his favourite author nor were they less modest in those days , though their tongues were a little more free , and papa was particularly arch and funny as he read from Orgon 's part in that celebrated play : "
91566	91567	91560	91564	men choix devenir votre epoux	6106	" "
91578	92135	91576	91576	Elmire	990	" says the Colonel , laughing , and turning round to his wife . Elmira prodigiously admired Orgon 's reading , and so did his daughters , and almost everything besides which Mr. Lambert said or did . Canst thou , O friendly reader , count upon the fidelity of an artless and tender heart or two , and reckon among the blessings which Heaven hath bestowed on thee the love of faithful women ! Purify thine own heart , and try to make it worthy theirs . On thy knees , on thy knees , give thanks for the blessing awarded thee ! All the prizes of life are nothing compared to that one . All the rewards of ambition , wealth , pleasure , only vanity and disappointment grasped at greedily and fought for fiercely , and , over and over again , found worthless by the weary winners . But love seems to survive life , and to reach beyond it . I think we take it with us past the grave . Do we not still give it to those who have left us ? May we not hope that they feel it for us , and that we shall leave it here in one or two fond bosoms , when we also are gone ? And whence , or how , or why , pray , this sermon ? You see I know more about this Lambert family than you do to whom I am just presenting them : as how should you who never heard of them before ! You may not like my friends ; very few people do like strangers to whom they are presented with an outrageous flourish of praises on the part of the introducer . You say quite naturally , What ? Is this all ? Are these the people he is so fond of ? Why , the girl 's not a beauty the mother is good - natured , and may have been good - looking once , but she has no trace of it now and , as for the father , he is quite an ordinary man . Granted but do n't you acknowledge that the sight of an honest man , with an honest , loving wife by his side , and surrounded by loving and obedient children , presents something very sweet and affecting to you ? If you are made acquainted with such a person , and see the eager kindness of the fond faces round about him , and that pleasant confidence and affection which beams from his own , do you mean to say you are not touched and gratified ? If you happen to stay in such a man 's house , and at morning or evening see him and his children and domestics gathered together in a certain name , do you not join humbly in the petitions of those servants , and close them with a reverent Amen ? That first night of his stay at Oakhurst , Harry Warrington , who had had a sleeping potion , and was awake sometimes rather feverish , thought he heard the Evening Hymn , and that his dearest brother George was singing it at home , in which delusion the patient went off again to sleep .
92426	92435	92437	92439	kind Mrs. Lambert	1180	" What is it , my dear child ? "
92445	92456	92458	92459	the lad	2434	" Nothing , madam ; a twinge in my shoulder , "
92461	92479	92458	92459	the lad	2434	" I speak to my host and hostess ? Sure you have been very kind to me . "
92480	92527	92437	92439	kind Mrs. Lambert	1180	" We are old friends , Mr. Warrington . My husband , Colonel Lambert , knew your father , and I and your mamma were schoolgirls together at Kensington . You were no stranger to us when your aunt and cousin told us who you were . "
92528	92533	92535	92535	Harry	701	" Are they here ? "
92542	92565	92535	92535	Harry	701	" They must have lain at Tunbridge Wells last night . They sent a horseman from Reigate yesterday for news of you . "
92566	92572	92574	92574	Harry	701	" Ah ! I remember , "
92582	92608	92574	92574	Harry	701	" I have made a good cure of you , Mr. Warrington . And now Mrs. Lambert and the cook must take charge of you . "
92609	92622	92624	92625	the lady	2586	" Nay ; Theo prepared the chicken and rice , Mr. Lambert , "
92627	92648	92624	92625	the lady	2586	" Will Mr. Warrington get up after he has had his breakfast ? We will send your valet to you . "
92649	92666	92668	92669	Mr. Lambert	1000	" If howling proves fidelity , your man must be a most fond , attached creature , "
92671	92686	92688	92689	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" He let your baggage travel off after all in your aunt 's carriage , "
92691	92713	92688	92689	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" You must wear my husband 's linen , which , I dare say , is not so fine as yours . "
92714	92730	92732	92733	the Colonel	19708	" Pish , my dear ! my shirts are good shirts enough for any Christian , "
92735	92745	92747	92747	mamma	19850	" They are Theo 's and Hester 's work , "
92761	92779	92780	92781	the lady	2586	" And Theo hath ripped and sewed your sleeve to make it quite comfortable for your shoulder , "
92784	92789	92791	92791	Harry	701	" What beautiful roses ! "
92817	92836	92791	92791	Harry	701	" My daughter Theo cut them this morning . Well , Mr. Lambert ? She did cut them ! "
92877	92900	92902	92904	the young patient	6135	" And I fancied I heard some one singing the Evening Hymn very sweetly last night or was it only a dream ? "
92906	92913	92915	92916	the Colonel	19708	" Theo again , Mr. Warrington ! "
92920	92942	92915	92916	the Colonel	19708	" My servants said your negro man began to sing it in the kitchen as if he was a church organ . "
92943	92990	92992	92993	the boy	2227	" Our people sing it at home , sir . My grandpapa used to love it very much . His wife 's father was a great friend of good Bishop Ken , who wrote it ; and and my dear brother used to love it too ; "
93458	93465	93467	93467	Harry	701	" My boys are both away , "
93471	93571	93467	93467	Harry	701	" or they would have shown you the country when you got up , Mr. Warrington . Now you can only have the company of my wife and her daughters . Mrs. Lambert hath told you already about one of them , Theo , our eldest , who made your broth , who cut your roses , and who mended your coat . She is not such a wonder as her mother imagines her to be : but little Theo is a smart little housekeeper , and a very good and cheerful lass , though her father says it . "
93572	93588	93590	93592	the young patient	6135	" It is very kind of Miss Lambert to take so much care for me , "
93594	93613	93590	93592	the young patient	6135	" She is no kinder to you than to any other mortal , and doth but her duty . "
93619	93630	93631	93631	he	19708	" I laugh at their mother for praising our children , "
93634	93685	93631	93631	he	19708	" and I think I am as foolish about them myself . The truth is , God hath given us very good and dutiful children , and I see no reason why I should disguise my thankfulness for such a blessing . You have never a sister , I think ? "
93686	93696	93697	93698	Mr. Warrington	701	" No , sir , I am alone now , "
93701	93791	93697	93698	Mr. Warrington	701	" Ay , truly , I ask your pardon for my thoughtlessness . Your man hath told our people what befell last year . I served with Braddock in Scotland ; and hope he mended before he died . A wild fellow , sir , but there was a fund of truth about the man , and no little kindness under his rough swaggering manner . Your black fellow talks very freely about his master and his affairs . I suppose you permit him these freedoms as he rescued you "
93792	93796	93798	93799	Mr. Warrington	701	" Rescued me ? "
93801	93857	93798	93799	Mr. Warrington	701	" From ever so many Indians on that very expedition . My Molly and I did not know we were going to entertain so prodigiously wealthy a gentleman . He saith that half Virginia belongs to you ; but if the whole of North America were yours , we could but give you our best . "
93858	93978	93697	93698	Mr. Warrington	701	" Those negro boys , sir , lie like the father of all lies . They think it is for our honour to represent us as ten times as rich as we are . My mother has what would be a vast estate in England , and is a very good one at home . We are as well off as most of our neighbours , sir , but no better ; and all our splendour is in Mr. Gumbo 's foolish imagination . He never rescued me from an Indian in his life , and would run away at the sight of one , as my poor brother 's boy did on that fatal day when he fell . "
93979	93990	93992	93993	the Colonel	19708	" The bravest man will do so at unlucky times , "
93995	94017	93992	93993	the Colonel	19708	" I myself saw the best troops in the world run at Preston , before a ragged mob of Highland savages . "
94018	94032	93697	93698	Mr. Warrington	701	" That was because the Highlanders fought for a good cause , sir . "
94033	94038	94040	94040	Harry	701	" Do you think , "
94044	94060	93697	93698	Mr. Warrington	701	" that the French Indians had the good cause in the fight of last year ? "
94061	94077	94079	94079	Harry	701	" The scoundrels ! I would have the scalp of every murderous redskin among 'em ! "
94085	94106	94079	94079	Harry	701	" They were robbing and invading the British territories , too . But the Highlanders were fighting for their king . "
94107	94128	94130	94131	the Colonel	19708	" We , on our side , were fighting for our king ; and we ended by winning the battle , "
94135	94138	94140	94140	Harry	701	" Ah ! "
94142	94172	94140	94140	Harry	701	" if his Royal Highness the Prince had not turned back at Derby , your king and mine , now , would be his Majesty King James the Third ! "
94173	94185	94187	94187	Lambert	993	" Who made such a Tory of you , Mr. Warrington ? "
94189	94200	94202	94203	the youth	5012	" Nay , sir , the Esmonds were always loyal ! "
94205	94245	94202	94203	the youth	5012	" Had we lived at home , and twenty years sooner , brother and I often and often agreed that our heads would have been in danger . We certainly would have staked them for the king 's cause . "
94246	94278	94140	94140	Harry	701	" Yours is better on your shoulders than on a pole at Temple Bar . I have seen them there , and they do n't look very pleasant , Mr. Warrington . "
94279	94297	94299	94301	the young man	2122	" I shall take off my hat , and salute them , whenever I pass the gate , "
94303	94315	94299	94301	the young man	2122	" if the king and the whole court are standing by ! "
94316	94339	94341	94342	Colonel Lambert	975	" I doubt whether your relative , my Lord Castlewood , is as staunch a supporter of the king over the water , "
94346	94424	94341	94342	Colonel Lambert	975	" or your aunt , the Baroness of Bernstein , who left you in our charge . Whatever her old partialities may have been , she has repented of them ; she has rallied to our side , landed her nephews in the Household , and looks to find a suitable match for her nieces . If you have Tory opinions , Mr. Warrington , take an old soldier 's advice , and keep them to yourself . "
94425	94440	94442	94443	the boy	2227	" Why , sir , I do not think that you will betray me ! "
94445	94475	94442	94443	the boy	2227	" Not I , but others might . You did not talk in this way at Castlewood ? I mean the old Castlewood which you have just come from . "
94476	94490	94492	94492	Harry	701	" I might be safe amongst my own kinsmen , surely , sir ! "
94494	94587	94492	94492	Harry	701	" Doubtless . I would not say no . But a man 's own kinsmen can play him slippery tricks at times , and he finds himself none the better for trusting them . I mean no offence to you or any of your family ; but lacqueys have ears as well as their masters , and they carry about all sorts of stories . For instance , your black fellow is ready to tell all he knows about you , and a great deal more besides , as it would appear . "
94588	94599	94602	94602	Harry	701	" Hath he told about the broken - kneed horse ? "
94608	94708	94602	94602	Harry	701	" To say truth , my groom seemed to know something of the story , and said it was a shame a gentleman should sell another such a brute ; let alone a cousin . I am not here to play the Mentor to you , or to carry about servants ' tittle - tattle . When you have seen more of your cousins , you will form your own opinion of them ; meanwhile , take an old soldier 's advice , I say again , and be cautious with whom you deal , and what you say . "
95517	95530	95532	95532	Harry	701	" They fought against your grandfathers and King Charles , Mr. Warrington , "
95536	95603	95532	95532	Harry	701	" I do n't hide that . They rode to join the Prince of Orange at Exeter . We were Whigs , young gentleman , and something more . John Lambert , the Major - General , was a kinsman of our house , and we were all more or less partial to short hair and long sermons . You do not seem to like either ? "
95625	95713	95616	95616	he	701	" Be not alarmed , we are very good Churchmen now . My eldest son will be in orders ere long . He is now travelling as governor to my Lord Wrotham 's son in Italy , and as for our women , they are all for the Church , and carry me with 'em . Every woman is a Tory at heart . Mr. Pope says a rake , but I think t'other is the more charitable word . Come , let us go see them , "
95738	95744	95746	95747	the Colonel	19708	" Here is Miss Hester , "
95749	95827	95746	95747	the Colonel	19708	" and this is Miss Theo , the soup - maker , the tailoress , the harpsichord - player , and the songstress , who set you to sleep last night . Make a curtsey to the gentleman , young ladies ! Oh , I forgot , and Theo is the mistress of the roses which you admired a short while since in your bedroom . I think she has kept some of them in her cheeks . "
96079	96081	96072	96072	She	987	" cheeses "
96134	96150	96128	96128	he	2921	" Eh bien ! que dites - vous , ma fille , de notre hote ? "
96151	96157	96159	96159	mamma	894	" Nonsense , Mr. Lambert ! "
96161	96174	96176	96177	Colonel Lambert	975	" Nonsense is sometimes the best kind of sense in the world , "
96184	96191	96192	96193	the Colonel	19708	" Are you fond of nonsense ? "
96218	96261	96192	96193	the Colonel	19708	" We consume a vast deal of it in this house . Rabelais is my favourite reading . My wife is all for Mr. Fielding and Theophrastus . I think Theo prefers Tom Brown , and Mrs. Hetty here loves Dean Swift . "
96262	96271	96273	96274	Miss Hetty	993	" Our papa is talking what he loves , "
96276	96284	96273	96274	Miss Hetty	993	" And what is that , miss ? "
96293	96305	96307	96309	the young lady	6270	" Sure , sir , you said yourself it was nonsense , "
96319	96331	96333	96335	the honest Colonel	4277	" Which of them do you like best , Mr. Warrington ? "
96337	96344	96316	96316	her	6270	" Which of whom , sir ? "
96345	96367	96316	96316	her	6270	" The Curate of Meudon , or the Dean of St. Patrick 's , or honest Tom , or Mr. Fielding ? "
96368	96376	96316	96316	her	6270	" And what were they , sir ? "
96377	96386	96316	96316	her	6270	" They ! Why , they wrote books . "
96387	96401	96403	96403	Harry	701	" Indeed , sir . I never heard of either one of 'em , "
96410	96450	96403	96403	Harry	701	" I fear my book - learning was neglected at home , sir . My brother had read every book that ever was wrote , I think . He could have talked to you about 'em for hours together . "
96473	96488	96490	96492	the jolly Colonel	6273	" Never mind , honesty is better than books any day , Mr. Warrington ! "
96494	96527	96490	96492	the jolly Colonel	6273	" You may go through the world very honourably without reading any of the books I have been talking of , and some of them might give you more pleasure than profit . "
96528	96551	96553	96554	Mr. Warrington	701	" I know more about horses and dogs than Greek and Latin , sir . We most of us do in Virginia , "
96556	96571	96553	96554	Mr. Warrington	701	" You are like the Persians ; you can ride and speak the truth . "
96572	96603	96605	96606	Colonel Lambert	975	" Are the Prussians very good on horseback , sir ? I hope I shall see their king and a campaign or two , either with 'em or against 'em , "
97428	97532	97426	97426	herself	6323	" Is this the hero with whom my mamma and I have been in love for these twenty - four hours , and whom we have endowed with every perfection ? How beautiful , pale , and graceful he looked yesterday as he lay on the ground ! How his curls fell over his face ! How sad it was to see his poor white arm , and the blood trickling from it when papa bled him ! And now he is well and amongst us , he is handsome certainly , but oh , is it possible he is he is stupid ? "
97683	97689	97661	97661	mamma	19850	" Never mind , my dear "
97698	97805	97808	97808	I	0	" our hero has turned out to be but an ordinary mortal , and none such is good enough for my Theo . Thou shalt have a real husband ere long , if there be one in England . Why , I was scarce fifteen when your father saw me at the Bury Assembly , and while I was yet at school , I used to vow that I never would have any other man . If Heaven gave me such a husband the best man in the whole kingdom sure it will bless my child equally , who deserves a king if she fancies him ! "
98688	98699	98685	98685	Hetty	993	" Mamma 's swans are something like these , papa . "
98700	98707	98709	98709	mamma	894	" What swans , my dear ? "
98711	98737	98739	98740	Miss Hetty	993	" Something like , but not quite . They have shorter necks than these , and are , scores of them , on our common , "
98742	98766	98739	98740	Miss Hetty	993	" I saw Betty plucking one in the kitchen this morning . We shall have it for dinner , with apple - sauce and "
98767	98775	98777	98778	Miss Theo	987	" Do n't be a little goose ! "
98780	98794	98777	98778	Miss Theo	987	" And sage and onions . Do you love swan , Mr. Warrington ? "
98795	98805	98807	98809	the Virginian gentleman	4217	" I shot three last winter on our river , "
98811	98827	98807	98809	the Virginian gentleman	4217	" Ours are not such white birds as these they eat very well , though . "
99036	99048	99028	99032	the fair and suspicious reader	6411	" Three days after his arrival , Harry was walking with , "
100724	100732	100734	100734	Theo	987	" He is very kind and honest , "
100761	100772	100774	100775	little Hetty	993	" I do n't think him stupid at all now , "
100777	100793	100774	100775	little Hetty	993	" and , mamma , I think , he is very like a swan indeed . "
100794	100807	100809	100809	mamma	19850	" It felt just like one of the boys going to school , "
100811	100816	100818	100818	Theo	987	" Just like it , "
100822	100837	100839	100840	Miss Hetty	993	" I am glad he has got papa to ride with him to Westerham , "
100842	100887	100839	100840	Miss Hetty	993	" and that he bought Farmer Briggs 's horse . I do n't like his going to those Castlewood people . I am sure that Madame Bernstein is a wicked old woman . I expected to see her ride away on her crooked stick . "
100888	100893	100774	100775	little Hetty	993	" Hush , Hetty ! "
100894	100992	100839	100840	Miss Hetty	993	" Do you think she would float if they tried her in the pond , as poor old mother Hely did at Elmhurst ? The other old woman seemed fond of him I mean the one with the fair tour . She looked very melancholy when she went away ; but Madame Bernstein whisked her off with her crutch , and she was obliged to go . I do n't care , Theo . I know she is a wicked woman . You think everybody good , you do , because you never do anything wrong yourself . "
100993	101001	101003	101004	the mother	3050	" My Theo is a good girl , "
101013	101024	101003	101004	the mother	3050	" Then why do we call her a miserable sinner ? "
101025	101034	101036	101036	mamma	894	" We are all so , my love , "
101038	101052	101036	101036	mamma	894	" What , papa too ? You know you do n't think so , "
101070	101086	101087	101087	Mamma	894	" What was that you told John to give to Mr. Warrington 's black man ? "
101112	101153	101106	101106	she	894	" I feel quite like a mother to him , my dears , I ca n't help owning it , and you know both our boys still like one of our cakes to take to school or college with them . "
101625	101636	101638	101639	Colonel Lambert	975	" Now we are out of sight of the ladies , "
101661	101711	101646	101646	his	975	" I know my wife always watches at her window until we are round this corner . I hope we shall have you seeing the trees and the house again , Mr. Warrington ; and the boys being at home , mayhap there will be better sport for you . "
101712	101727	101729	101730	Mr. Warrington	701	" I never want to be happier , sir , than I have been , "
101732	101756	101729	101730	Mr. Warrington	701	" and I hope you will let me say , that I feel as if I am leaving quite old friends behind me . "
101757	101823	101646	101646	his	975	" The friend at whose house we shall sup to - night hath a son , who is an old friend of our family , too ; and my wife , who is an inveterate marriage - monger , would have made a match between him and one of my girls , but that the Colonel hath chosen to fall in love with somebody else . "
101824	101827	101829	101830	Mr. Warrington	701	" Ah ! "
101832	101848	101829	101830	Mr. Warrington	701	" Other folks have done the same thing . There were brave fellows before Agamemnon . "
101849	101871	101874	101876	the young traveller	2203	" I beg your pardon , sir . Is the gentleman 's name Aga ? I did not quite gather it , "
101878	101887	101889	101890	the Colonel	19708	" No , his name is James Wolfe , "
101894	101948	101889	101890	the Colonel	19708	" He is a young fellow still , or what we call so , being scarce thirty years old . He is the youngest lieutenant - colonel in the army , unless , to be sure , we except a few scores of our nobility , who take rank before us common folk . "
101949	101955	101957	101958	the Colonel	19708	" Of course of course ! "
101970	102066	101957	101958	the Colonel	19708	" And I have seen him commanding captains , and very brave captains , who were thirty years his seniors , and who had neither his merit nor his good fortune . But , lucky as he hath been , no one envies his superiority , for , indeed , most of us acknowledge that he is our superior . He is beloved by every man of our old regiment and knows every one of them . He is a good scholar as well as a consummate soldier , and a master of many languages . "
102067	102072	102074	102075	Harry Warrington	701	" Ah , sir ! "
102084	102192	102074	102075	Harry Warrington	701	" I feel that I have neglected my own youth sadly ; and am come to England but an ignoramus . Had my dear brother been alive , he would have represented our name and our colony , too , better than I can do . George was a scholar ; George was a musician ; George could talk with the most learned people in our country , and I make no doubt would have held his own here . Do you know , sir , I am glad to have come home , and to you especially , if but to learn how ignorant I am . "
102193	102207	102209	102210	the Colonel	19708	" If you know that well , ' tis a great gain already , "
102216	102318	102209	102210	the Colonel	19708	" At home , especially of late , and since we lost my brother , I used to think myself a mighty fine fellow , and have no doubt that the folks round about flattered me . I am wiser now , that is , I hope I am , though perhaps I am wrong , and only bragging again . But you see , sir , the gentry in our colony do n't know very much , except about dogs and horses , and betting and games . I wish I knew more about books , and less about them . "
102319	102544	102209	102210	the Colonel	19708	" Nay . Dogs and horses are very good books , too , in their way , and we may read a deal of truth out of 'em . Some men are not made to be scholars , and may be very worthy citizens and gentlemen in spite of their ignorance . What call have all of us to be especially learned or wise , or to take a first place in the world ? His Royal Highness is commander , and Martin Lambert is colonel , and Jack Hunt , who rides behind yonder , was a private soldier , and is now a very honest , worthy groom . So as we all do our best in our station , it matters not much whether that be high or low . Nay , how do we know what is high and what is low ? and whether Jack 's currycomb , or my epaulets , or his Royal Highness 's baton , may not turn out to be pretty equal ? When I began life , et militavi non sine never mind what I dreamed of success and honour ; now I think of duty , and yonder folks , from whom we parted a few hours ago . Let us trot on , else we shall not reach Westerham before nightfall . "
102767	102771	102760	102760	He	701	" Miss Lowther . "
102772	102778	102780	102783	the enthusiastic Colonel James	1031	" With all my heart , "
102824	102834	102836	102836	Lambert	975	" If she was the daughter of King Charlemagne , "
102855	102856	102857	102858	Mr. Lambert	1000	" "
102868	102874	102864	102864	he	1000	" the young Colonel declared . "
102891	102895	102887	102887	you	1000	" cries mamma . "
103036	103037	103012	103019	a lass with a pair of bright eyes	6585	" "
103054	103061	103046	103046	you	19699	" said the elder Colonel Wolfe . "
103074	103075	103046	103046	you	19699	" "
103103	103257	103097	103097	I	0	" answers the lady : and so with much easy talk and kindness the evening passed away . On the morrow , and with many expressions of kindness and friendship for his late guest , Colonel Lambert gave over the young Virginian to Mr. Wolfe 's charge , and turned his horse 's head homewards , while the two gentlemen sped towards Tunbridge Wells . Wolfe was in a hurry to reach the place , Harry Warrington was , perhaps , not quite so eager : nay , when Lambert rode towards his own home , Harry 's thoughts followed him with a great deal of longing desire to the parlour at Oakhurst , where he had spent three days in happy calm . Mr. Wolfe agreed in all Harry 's enthusiastic praises of Mr. Lambert , and of his wife , and of his daughters , and of all that excellent family . "
103276	103291	103272	103273	Colonel Lambert	975	" said Wolfe , ' seem to me now the height of human ambition . "
103292	103298	103300	103300	Warrington	701	" And glory and honour ? "
103302	103317	103300	103300	Warrington	701	" are those nothing ? and would you give up the winning of them ? "
103318	103325	103327	103328	the Colonel	19708	" They were my dreams once , "
103338	103513	103327	103328	the Colonel	19708	" and now my desires are much more tranquil . I have followed arms ever since I was fourteen years of age . I have seen almost every kind of duty connected with my calling . I know all the garrison towns in this country , and have had the honour to serve wherever there has been work to be done during the last ten years . I have done pretty near the whole of a soldier 's duty , except , indeed , the command of an army , which can hardly be hoped for by one of my years ; and now , methinks , I would like quiet , books to read , a wife to love me , and some children to dandle on my knee . I have imagined some such Elysium for myself , Mr. Warrington . True love is better than glory ; and a tranquil fireside , with the woman of your heart seated by it , the greatest good the gods can send to us . "
103528	103531	103526	103526	He	701	" Yes , "
103564	103584	103554	103555	his companion	21539	" You say ' Yes ' as if a fireside and a sweetheart were not particularly to your taste . "
103585	103673	103554	103555	his companion	21539	" Why , look you , Colonel , there are other things which a young fellow might like to enjoy . You have had sixteen years of the world : and I am but a few months away from my mother 's apron - strings . When I have seen a campaign or two , or six , as you have : when I have distinguished myself like Mr. Wolfe , and made the world talk of me , I then may think of retiring from it . "
104209	104223	104224	104225	the Baroness	2319	" You could not have come at a better moment , my dear , "
104241	104459	104224	104225	the Baroness	2319	" Those three individuals have the most active tongues in the Wells . They will trumpet your good qualities in every company where they go . I have introduced you to a hundred people already , and , Heaven help me ! have told all sorts of fibs about the geography of Virginia in order to describe your estate . It is a prodigious large one , but I am afraid I have magnified it . I have filled it with all sorts of wonderful animals , gold mines , spices ; I am not sure I have not said diamonds . As for your negroes , I have given your mother armies of them , and , in fact , represented her as a sovereign princess reigning over a magnificent dominion . So she has a magnificent dominion : I can not tell to a few hundred thousand pounds how much her yearly income is , but I have no doubt it is a very great one . And you must prepare , sir , to be treated here as the heir - apparent of this royal lady . Do not let your head be turned . From this day forth you are going to be flattered as you have never been flattered in your life . "
104460	104468	104470	104472	the young gentleman	2119	" And to what end , ma'am ? "
104474	104493	104470	104472	the young gentleman	2119	" I see no reason why I should be reputed so rich , or get so much flattery . "
104494	104657	104228	104228	her	2319	" In the first place , sir , you must not contradict your old aunt , who has no desire to be made a fool of before her company . And as for your reputation , you must know we found it here almost ready - made on our arrival . A London newspaper has somehow heard of you , and come out with a story of the immense wealth of a young gentleman from Virginia lately landed , and a nephew of my Lord Castlewood . Immensely wealthy you are , and ca n't help yourself . All the world is eager to see you . You shall go to church to - morrow morning , and see how the whole congregation will turn away from its books and prayers , to worship the golden calf in your person . You would not have had me undeceive them , would you , and speak ill of my own flesh and blood ? "
104658	104670	104672	104672	Harry	701	" But how am I bettered by this reputation for money ? "
104674	104935	104672	104672	Harry	701	" You are making your entry into the world , and the gold key will open most of its doors to you . To be thought rich is as good as to be rich . You need not spend much money . People will say that you hoard it , and your reputation for avarice will do you good rather than harm . You 'll see how the mothers will smile upon you , and the daughters will curtsey ! Do n't look surprised ! When I was a young woman myself I did as all the rest of the world did , and tried to better myself by more than one desperate attempt at a good marriage . Your poor grandmother , who was a saint upon earth to be sure , bating a little jealousy , used to scold me , and called me worldly . Worldly , my dear ! So is the world worldly ; and we must serve it as it serves us ; and give it nothing for nothing . Mr. Henry Esmond Warrington I ca n't help loving the two first names , sir , old woman as I am , and that I tell you on coming here or to London , would have been nobody . Our protection would have helped him but little . Our family has little credit , and , entre nous , not much reputation . I suppose you know that Castlewood was more than suspected in ' 45 , and hath since ruined himself by play ? "
104947	105129	104936	104936	Harry	701	" He never had much to lose , but he has lost that and more : his wretched estate is eaten up with mortgages . He has been at all sorts of schemes to raise money : my dear , he has been so desperate at times , that I did not think my diamonds were safe with him ; and have travelled to and from Castlewood without them . Terrible , is n't it , to speak so of one 's own nephew ? But you are my nephew , too , and not spoiled by the world yet , and I wish to warn you of its wickedness . I heard of your play - doings with Will and the chaplain , but they could do you no harm , nay , I am told you had the better of them . Had you played with Castlewood , you would have had no such luck : and you would have played , had not an old aunt of yours warned my Lord Castlewood to keep his hands off you . "
105130	105142	104672	104672	Harry	701	" What , ma'am , did you interfere to preserve me ? "
105143	105299	104936	104936	Harry	701	" I kept his clutches off from you : be thankful that you are come out of that ogre 's den with any flesh on your bones ! My dear , it has been the rage and passion of all our family . My poor silly brother played ; both his wives played , especially the last one , who has little else to live upon now but her nightly assemblies in London , and the money for the cards . I would not trust her at Castlewood alone with you : the passion is too strong for them , and they would fall upon you , and fleece you ; and then fall upon each other , and fight for the plunder . But for his place about the Court my poor nephew hath nothing , and that is Will 's fortune , too , sir , and Maria 's and her sister 's . "
105300	105312	104936	104936	Harry	701	" And are they , too , fond of the cards ? "
105313	105486	104936	104936	Harry	701	" No ; to do poor Molly justice , gaming is not her passion : but when she is amongst them in London , little Fanny will bet her eyes out of her head . I know what the passion is , sir : do not look so astonished ; I have had it , as I had the measles when I was a child . I am not cured quite . For a poor old woman there is nothing left but that . You will see some high play at my card - tables to - night . Hush ! my dear . It was that I wanted , and without which I moped so at Castlewood ! I could not win of my nieces or their mother . They would not pay if they lost . ' Tis best to warn you , my dear , in time , lest you should be shocked by the discovery . I ca n't live without the cards , there 's the truth ! "
105747	105776	105789	105789	her	780	" How dreadfully dull you must have found those humdrum people at that village where we left you but the savages were very kind to you , child ! "
105794	105824	105826	105826	Harry	701	" They were very kind ; and it was not at all dull , ma'am , and I think they are some of the best people in the world , "
105900	105905	105906	105906	she	2505	" Those two girls , "
105909	105930	105906	105906	she	2505	" a sick - bed an interesting stranger of course he has been falling in love with one of them . "
106376	106382	106384	106386	Lord Viscount Squanderfield	1043	" Marriage a la Mode , "
106720	106730	106732	106734	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Where are you going to dine , Harry ? "
106736	106843	106732	106734	Madame de Bernstein	723	" My niece Maria and I shall have a chicken in the little parlour I think you should go to the best ordinary . There is one at the White Horse at three , we shall hear his bell in a minute or two . And you will understand , sir , that you ought not to spare expense , but behave like Princess Pocahontas 's son . Your trunks have been taken over to the lodging I have engaged for you . It is not good for a lad to be always hanging about the aprons of two old women . Is it , Maria ? "
106844	106847	106853	106853	her	6717	" No , "
106935	106978	106917	106917	he	2132	" And there are good mercers and tailors from London always here to wait on the company at the Wells . You had better see them , my dear , for your suit is not of the very last fashion a little lace "
106979	106990	106992	106994	the young man	2122	" I ca n't go out of mourning , ma'am , "
107002	107007	107009	107010	the lady	2586	" Ho , sir , "
107023	107075	107009	107010	the lady	2586	" wear black for your brother till you are as old as Methuselah , if you like . I am sure I do n't want to prevent you . I only want you to dress , and to do like other people , and make a figure worthy of your name . "
107076	107079	107081	107082	Mr. Warrington	701	" Madam , "
107087	107100	107081	107082	Mr. Warrington	701	" I have not done anything to disgrace it that I know . "
107162	107183	107184	107184	she	5694	" Sure a little finer linen than that shirt you wear will not be a disgrace to you , sir , "
107282	107289	107291	107292	Madame Bernstein	723	" Come back here , sir , "
107294	107313	107291	107292	Madame Bernstein	723	" and if our company has not arrived , Maria and I will find some ruffles for you ! "
108045	108063	108039	108039	himself	2193	" And so you know the nephew of the old woman the Croesus who comes to arrive ? "
108064	108073	108075	108077	one young gentleman	6789	" You 're thrown out there , Jack ! "
108082	108089	108091	108091	Jack	1044	" Never could manage the lingo , "
108105	108113	108115	108120	the gentleman with the long queue	6792	" But assuredly , my dear lord ! "
108122	108153	108115	108120	the gentleman with the long queue	6792	" You have shown energy , my dear Baron ! He has been here but two hours . My people told me of him only as I came to dinner . "
108154	108177	108179	108180	the Baron	6793	" I knew him before ! I have met him often in London with the Baroness and my lord , his cousin , "
108197	108209	108211	108212	my landlord	2423	" Behold , sir ! Behold a potage of my fashion ! "
108257	108266	108241	108243	the foreign gentleman	6797	" Fous bossedez notre langue barfaidement , monsieur . "
108291	108303	108305	108306	his lordship	2243	" Tell me more about the Croesus , my good Baron , "
108330	108397	108320	108320	Harry	701	" What will you , that I tell you , my dear lord ? Croesus is a youth like other youths ; he is tall , like other youths ; he is awkward , like other youths ; he has black hair , as they all have who come from the Indies . Lodgings have been taken for him at Mrs. Rose 's toy - shop . "
108398	108405	108407	108408	Mr. Warrington	701	" I have lodgings there too , "
108410	108425	108407	108408	Mr. Warrington	701	" Who is Croesus they are talking of ? How good the soup is ! "
108426	108434	108435	108436	the Baron	6793	" He travels with a large retinue , "
108439	108500	108435	108436	the Baron	6793	" four servants , two postchaises , and a pair of outriders . His chief attendant is a black man who saved his life from the savages in America , and who will not hear , on any account , of being made free . He persists in wearing mourning for his elder brother from whom he inherits his principality . "
108501	108514	108517	108519	the elder gentleman	6803	" Could anything console you for the death of yours , Chevalier ? "
108521	108528	108530	108531	the Chevalier	6804	" Milor ! his property might , "
108533	108541	108530	108531	the Chevalier	6804	" which you know is not small . "
108542	108565	108435	108436	the Baron	6793	" Your brother lives on his patrimony which you have told me is immense you by your industry , my dear Chevalier . "
108566	108569	108571	108572	the individual	6805	" Milor ! "
108577	108613	108571	108572	the individual	6805	" By your industry or your esprit , how much more noble ! Shall you be at the Baroness 's to - night ? She ought to be a little of your parents , Chevalier ? "
108614	108623	108625	108627	the other gentleman	6806	" Again I fail to comprehend your lordship , "
108632	108747	108625	108627	the other gentleman	6806	" Why , she is a woman of great wit she is of noble birth she has undergone strange adventures she has but little principle there you happily have the advantage of her . But what care we men of the world ? You intend to go and play with the young Creole , no doubt , and get as much money from him as you can . By the way , Baron , suppose he should be a guet - apens , that young Creole ? Suppose our excellent friend has invented him up in London , and brings him down with his character for wealth to prey upon the innocent folks here ? "
108748	108756	108758	108760	the little Baron	6807	" J'y ai souvent pense , milor , "
108771	108779	108758	108760	the little Baron	6807	" that Baroness is capable of anything . "
108780	108808	108625	108627	the other gentleman	6806	" A Baron a Baroness , que voulez - vous , my friend ? I mean the late lamented husband . Do you know who he was ? "
108809	108851	108625	108627	the other gentleman	6806	" Intimately . A more notorious villain never dealt a card . At Venice , at Brussels , at Spa , at Vienna the gaols of every one of which places he knew . I knew the man , my lord . "
108852	108907	108758	108760	the little Baron	6807	" I thought you would . I saw him at the Hague , where I first had the honour of meeting you , and a more disreputable rogue never entered my doors . A minister must open them to all sorts of people , Baron , spies , sharpers , ruffians of every sort . "
108908	108918	108920	108923	my lord 's companion	6808	" Parbleu , milor , how you treat them ! "
108925	108970	108920	108923	my lord 's companion	6808	" A man of my rank , my friend of the rank I held then of course , must see all sorts of people entre autres your acquaintance . What his wife could want with such a name as his I ca n't conceive . "
108971	108983	108758	108760	the little Baron	6807	" Apparently , it was better than the lady 's own . "
108984	109022	108758	108760	the little Baron	6807	" Effectively ! So I have heard of my friend Paddy changing clothes with the scarecrow . I do n't know which name is the most distinguished , that of the English bishop or the German baron . "
109023	109027	109029	109031	the other gentleman	6806	" My lord , "
109046	109064	109029	109031	the other gentleman	6806	" you forget that I , too , am a Baron and a Chevalier of the Holy Roman "
109065	109101	109102	109103	The knight	6810	" Order of the Spur ! not in the least , my dear knight and baron ! You will have no more wine ? We shall meet at Madame de Bernstein 's to - night . "
109237	109304	109222	109223	the other	19802	" What a little sharper it is ! Everything I said about Bernstein relates mutato nomine to him . I knew the fellow to be a spy and a rogue . He has changed his religion I do n't know how many times . I had him turned out of the Hague myself when I was ambassador , and I know he was caned in Vienna . "
109305	109317	109320	109320	Harry	701	" I wonder my Lord Chesterfield associates with such a villain ! "
109345	109385	109392	109392	his	2193	" There can not be a more fieffe coquin than this Poellnitz . Why , Heaven be thanked , he has actually left me my snuff - box ! You laugh ? the fellow is capable of taking it . "
109403	109411	109413	109417	one of the two diners	6831	" You are quite right , sir , "
109424	109508	109413	109417	one of the two diners	6831	" though , saving your presence , I do n't know what business it is of yours . My lord will play with anybody who will set him . Do n't be alarmed , he is as deaf as a post , and did not hear a word that you said ; and that 's why my lord will play with anybody who will put a pack of cards before him , and that is the reason why he consorts with this rogue . "
109509	109525	109527	109528	Mr. Jack	1059	" Faith , I know other noblemen who are not particular as to their company , "
109530	109561	109527	109528	Mr. Jack	1059	" Do you mean because I associate with you ? I know my company , my good friend , and I defy most men to have the better of me . "
109666	109670	109661	109664	the gentleman from Virginia	6841	" To whom ? "
109698	109718	109720	109721	Mr. Barbeau	1060	" To the young gentleman from Virginia who has just arrived , and who perfectly possesses our beautiful language ! "
109741	109766	109776	109776	his	701	" And to whom your lordship will be answerable for language reflecting upon my family , and uttered in the presence of these gentlemen , "
109786	109804	109806	109810	one of the younger guests	6844	" You must go and call into his ear , and then he may perchance hear you , "
109812	109830	109831	109832	Mr. Warrington	701	" I will take care that his lordship shall understand my meaning , one way or other , "
109839	109858	109831	109832	Mr. Warrington	701	" and will not suffer calumnies regarding my relatives to be uttered by him or any other man ! "
109908	109911	109913	109913	he	6846	" Sir , "
109915	110003	109913	109913	he	6846	" you will believe , on the word of a gentleman , that I had no idea before whom I was speaking , and it seems that my acquaintance , Monsieur de Poellnitz , knew you no better than myself . Had I known you , believe me that I should have been the last man in the world to utter a syllable that should give you annoyance ; and I tender you my regrets and apologies , before my Lord March and Mr. Morris here present . "
110158	110176	110178	110179	my lord	2193	" Jack Morris would adjourn to the Dust Hole , as a pretext for a fresh drink , "
110210	110221	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" My Lord Chesterfield 's deuce is deuce - ace , "
110227	110240	110225	110225	March	1061	" His lordship ca n't keep away from the cards or dice . "
110241	110314	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" My Lord March has not one devil , but several devils . He loves gambling , he loves horse - racing , he loves betting , he loves drinking , he loves eating , he loves money , he loves women ; and you have fallen into bad company , Mr. Warrington , when you lighted upon his lordship . He will play you for every acre you have in Virginia . "
110315	110326	110225	110225	March	1061	" With the greatest pleasure in life , Mr. Warrington ! "
110331	110365	110225	110225	March	1061	" And for all your tobacco , and for all your spices , and for all your slaves , and for all your oxen and asses , and for everything that is yours . "
110366	110398	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" Shall we begin now ? Jack , you are never without a dice - box or a bottle - screw . I will set Mr. Warrington for what he likes . "
110399	110454	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" Unfortunately , my lord , the tobacco , and the slaves , and the asses , and the oxen , are not mine , as yet . I am just of age , and my mother , scarce twenty years older , has quite as good chance of long life as I have . "
110455	110516	110225	110225	March	1061	" I will bet you that you survive her . I will pay you a sum now against four times the sum to be paid at her death . I will set you a fair sum over this table against the reversion of your estate in Virginia at the old lady 's departure . What do you call your place ? "
110517	110520	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" Castlewood . "
110521	110657	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" A principality , I hear it is . I will bet that its value has been exaggerated ten times at least amongst the quidnuncs here . How came you by the name of Castlewood ? you are related to my lord ? Oh , stay : I know , my lady , your mother , descends from the real head of the house . He took the losing side in ' 15 . I have had the story a dozen times from my old Duchess . She knew your grandfather . He was friend of Addison and Steele , and Pope and Milton , I dare say , and the bigwigs . It is a pity he did not stay at home , and transport the other branch of the family to the plantations . "
110658	110671	110673	110674	Mr. Warrington	701	" I have just been staying at Castlewood with my cousin there , "
110676	110693	110673	110674	Mr. Warrington	701	" Hm ! Did you play with him ? He 's fond of pasteboard and bones . "
110694	110709	110223	110225	my Lord March	1061	" Never , but for sixpences and a pool of commerce with the ladies . "
110710	110744	110745	110745	Harry	701	" So much the better for both of you . But you played with Will Esmond if he was at home ? I will lay ten to one you played with Will Esmond . "
110766	110774	110776	110777	Jack Morris	1059	" And Tom Sampson , the chaplain , "
110779	110806	110776	110777	Jack Morris	1059	" was he of the party ? I wager that Tom made a third , and the Lord deliver you from Tom and Will Esmond together ! "
110807	110821	110823	110824	Mr. Warrington	701	" Nay ; the truth is , I won of both of them , "
110826	110839	110823	110824	Mr. Warrington	701	" And they paid you ? Well , miracles will never cease ! "
110840	110849	110851	110852	Mr. Harry	701	" I did not say anything about miracles , "
110859	110877	110851	110852	Mr. Harry	701	" And you do n't tell tales out of school the volto sciolto hey , Mr. Warrington ? "
110882	110888	110891	110891	Harry	701	" I beg your pardon , "
110893	110909	110891	110891	Harry	701	" French is the only language besides my own of which I know a little . "
110910	110931	110933	110934	Jack Morris	1059	" My Lord March has learned Italian at the Opera , and a pretty penny his lessons have cost him , "
110936	110949	110933	110934	Jack Morris	1059	" We must show him the Opera must n't we , March ? "
110950	110956	110963	110963	he	2193	" Must we , Morris ? "
111020	111033	111035	111035	Harry	701	" I do n't care about the Opera much , my lord , "
111042	111063	111035	111035	Harry	701	" but I should like to go to Newmarket , and long to see a good English hunting - field . "
111064	111084	111035	111035	Harry	701	" We will show you Newmarket and the hunting - field , sir . Can you ride pretty well ? "
111085	111091	111092	111092	Harry	701	" I think I can , "
111095	111107	111092	111092	Harry	701	" and I can shoot pretty well , and jump some . "
111108	111164	111035	111035	Harry	701	" What 's your weight ? I bet you we weigh even , or I weigh most . I bet you Jack Morris beats you at birds or a mark , at five - and - twenty paces . I bet you I jump farther than you on flat ground , here on this green . "
111165	111194	111092	111092	Harry	701	" I do n't know Mr. Morris 's shooting I never saw either gentleman before but I take your bets , my lord , at what you please , "
111209	111214	111216	111217	my lord	2193	" Ponies on each ! "
111219	111224	111229	111229	Harry	701	" Done and done ! "
111255	111271	111280	111280	his	2193	" We can try the last bet now , if your feet are pretty steady , "
111487	111500	111502	111503	Jack Morris	1059	" Who is that tallow - faced Put with the carroty hair ? "
111531	111538	111540	111541	the Colonel	19708	" Your humble servant , gentlemen ! "
111551	111561	111563	111564	Jack Morris	1059	" Never saw such a figure in my life ! "
111566	111571	111563	111564	Jack Morris	1059	" Did you March ? "
111572	111584	111586	111587	the Colonel	19708	" I beg your pardon , I think you said March ? "
111594	111610	111612	111613	the nobleman	5022	" I am the Earl of March , sir , at Colonel Wolfe 's service , "
111617	111641	111612	111613	the nobleman	5022	" My friend , Mr. Morris , is so intimate with me , that , after dinner , we are quite like brothers . "
111666	111674	111662	111662	he	1059	" Two to one on my lord ! "
111675	111678	111681	111682	Mr. Warrington	701	" Done ! "
111692	111695	111662	111662	he	1059	" Done ! "
111698	111704	111705	111705	Harry	701	" Take him , Colonel , "
111730	111745	111712	111713	the Colonel	19708	" I see you have won one of our bets already , Mr. Warrington , "
111751	111771	111748	111748	March	1061	" I am taller than you by an inch or two , but you are broader round the shoulders . "
111772	111791	111793	111794	Jack Morris	1059	" Pooh , my dear Will ! I bet you you weigh twice as much as he does ! "
111796	111801	111803	111804	my lord	2193	" Done , Jack ! "
111808	111823	111803	111804	my lord	2193	" The bets are all ponies . Will you take him , Mr. Warrington ? "
111824	111834	111836	111836	Jack	1059	" No , my dear fellow one 's enough , "
111838	111846	111848	111849	my lord	2193	" Very good , my dear fellow , "
111851	111861	111848	111849	my lord	2193	" and now we will settle the other wager . "
112031	112037	112039	112040	Mr. Warrington	701	" My lord went first , "
112057	112267	112268	112268	I	0	" He was for having me take the lead ; but , remembering the story about the Battel of Fontanoy which my dearest George used to tell , I says , ' Monseigneur le Comte , tirez le premier , s'il vous play . ' So he took his run in his stocken feet , and for the honour of Old Virginia , I had the gratafacation of beating his lordship by more than two feet viz . , two feet nine inches me jumping twenty - one feet three inches , by the drawer 's measured tape , and his lordship only eighteen six . I had won from him about my weight before which I knew the moment I set my eye upon him . So he and Mr. Jack paid me these two betts . And with my best duty to my mother she will not be displeased with me , for I bett for the honor of the Old Dominion , and my opponent was a nobleman of the first quality , himself holding two Erldomes , and heir to a Duke . Betting is all the rage here , and the bloods and young fellows of fashion are betting away from morning till night . "
112483	112570	112590	112592	my dear lord	5690	" These feats of activity over , the four gentlemen now strolled out of the tavern garden into the public walk , where , by this time , a great deal of company was assembled : upon whom Mr. Jack , who was of a frank and free nature , with a loud voice , chose to make remarks that were not always agreeable . And here , if my Lord March made a joke , of which his lordship was not sparing , Jack roared , "
112602	112603	112608	112608	he	6915	" "
112614	112622	112608	112608	he	6915	" writes Harry sagaciously to Mrs. Mountain , "
112632	112702	112629	112630	an Erl	6918	" There was , indeed , a great variety of characters who passed . M. Poellnitz , no finer dressed than he had been at dinner , grinned , and saluted with his great laced hat and tarnished feathers . Then came by my Lord Chesterfield , in a pearl - coloured suit , with his blue ribbon and star , and saluted the young men in his turn . "
112723	112729	112730	112730	He	6919	" says my Lord March . "
112793	112794	112798	112798	him	6922	" "
112806	112814	112804	112804	March	1061	" asks Jack , with an oath . "
112877	112878	112873	112875	the impudent schoolmaster	6926	" "
112890	112894	112895	112897	That fat man	6928	" roars Jack . "
112924	112925	112917	112917	he	6928	" "
112946	112981	112940	112944	the man who wrote Clarissa	6934	" called out Colonel Wolfe and Mr. Warrington , in a breath . Harry ran forward to look at the old gentleman toddling along the walk with a train of admiring ladies surrounding him . "
112989	112994	112940	112944	the man who wrote Clarissa	6934	" one was saying , "
113018	113019	113010	113010	you	6935	" "
113032	113049	113010	113010	you	6935	" said the good , fat old man , raising a kind , round face skywards . "
113091	113092	113079	113079	I	0	" "
113112	113159	113100	113100	You	6935	" said Mr. Johnson , and went on mumbling some verses , swaying to and fro , his eyes turned towards the ground , his hands behind him , and occasionally endangering with his great stick the honest , meek eyes of his companion - author . "
113171	113179	113183	113183	they	6940	" he says to the young lady , "
113202	113331	113200	113200	sir	19663	" Here he made a low bow , and took off his hat to Mr. Warrington , who shrank back with many blushes , after saluting the great author . The great author was accustomed to be adored . A gentler wind never puffed mortal vanity . Enraptured spinsters flung tea - leaves round him , and incensed him with the coffee - pot . Matrons kissed the slippers they had worked for him . There was a halo of virtue round his nightcap . All Europe had thrilled , panted , admired , trembled , wept , over the pages of the immortal little , kind , honest man with the round paunch . Harry came back quite glowing and proud at having a bow from him . "
113334	113338	113200	113200	sir	19663	" says he , "
113350	113351	113342	113342	I	0	" "
113372	113380	113381	113382	My brother	20000	" says Jack , with a laugh . "
113427	113447	113424	113425	Mr. Richardson	1022	" cried Harry , always impetuous , honest , and tender , when he spoke of the dearest friend . "
113455	113469	113452	113453	a man	2438	" cried Mr. Wolfe , too , his pale face likewise flushing up . "
113486	113487	113488	113492	Every man to his taste	21208	" "
113496	113504	113505	113505	Your	20185	" says my lord , much amused . "
113522	113523	113507	113507	I	0	" "
113534	113537	113507	113507	I	0	" cries Jack "
113592	113593	113600	113600	you	1059	" "
113607	113616	113600	113600	you	1059	" says Jack , with a tearful voice . "
113628	113629	113630	113630	I	0	" "
113669	113675	113665	113667	an honest one	6963	" said the young Colonel . "
113682	113712	113680	113680	gentlemen	2402	" and here making , them a hasty salutation , he ran across the parade towards a young and elderly lady and a gentleman , who were now advancing . "
113724	113729	113720	113720	I	0	" says my lord . "
113747	113748	113741	113741	he	6965	" "
113769	113774	113749	113749	You	6966	" cries out Jack . "
113805	114168	113801	113801	your	6966	" The Dictionary - maker , who had shown so little desire to bow to my Lord Chesterfield , when that famous nobleman courteously saluted him , was here seen to take off his beaver , and bow almost to the ground , before a florid personage in a large round hat , with bands and a gown , who made his appearance in the Walk . This was my Lord Bishop of Salisbury , wearing complacently the blue riband and badge of the Garter , of which Noble Order his lordship was prelate . Mr. Johnson stood , hat in hand , during the whole time of his conversation with Dr. Gilbert ; who made many flattering and benedictory remarks to Mr. Richardson , declaring that he was the supporter of virtue , the preacher of sound morals , the mainstay of religion , of all which points the honest printer himself was perfectly convinced . Do not let any young lady trip to her grandpapa 's bookcase in consequence of this eulogium , and rashly take down Clarissa from the shelf . She would not care to read the volumes , over which her pretty ancestresses wept and thrilled a hundred years ago ; which were commended by divines from pulpits and belauded all Europe over . I wonder , are our women more virtuous than their grandmothers , or only more squeamish ? If the former , then Miss Smith of New York is certainly more modest than Miss Smith of London , who still does not scruple to say that tables , pianos , and animals have legs . Oh , my faithful , good old Samuel Richardson ! Hath the news yet reached thee in Hades that thy sublime novels are huddled away in corners , and that our daughters may no more read Clarissa than Tom Jones ? Go up , Samuel , and be reconciled with thy brother - scribe , whom in life thou didst hate so . I wonder whether a century hence the novels of to - day will be hidden behind locks and wires , and make pretty little maidens blush ? "
114192	114238	114189	114190	Mr. Richardson	1022	" asked Harry , as a fantastically dressed lady came up , and performed a curtsey and a compliment to the bowing printer . Jack Morris nervously struck Harry a blow in the side with the butt end of his whip . Lord March laughed . "
114309	114355	114302	114302	they	6983	" The Earl quitted his friends for a moment to make his bow to the old Duchess , Jack Morris explaining to Mr. Warrington how , at the Duke 's death , my Lord of March and Ruglen would succeed to his cousin 's dukedoms . "
114359	114365	114302	114302	they	6983	" says Harry , simply , "
114377	114385	114366	114367	his lordship	2243	" Jack burst into a loud laugh . "
114394	114398	114366	114367	his lordship	2243	" says he . "
114422	114423	114416	114420	the little Opera - dancer	6988	" "
114435	114443	114432	114433	Mr. Morris	1059	" said Harry , with a smile , "
114463	114555	114457	114461	the little Opera - dancer	6988	" Luckily for us , the secret about the little Opera - dancer never was revealed , for the young men 's conversation was interrupted by a lady in a cardinal cape , and a hat by no means unlike those lovely headpieces which have returned into vogue a hundred years after the date of our present history , who made a profound curtsey to the two gentlemen and received their salutation in return . She stopped opposite to Harry ; she held out her hand , rather to his wonderment : "
114566	114810	114557	114557	you	0	" she said . Off went Harry 's hat in an instant . He started , blushed , stammered , and called out Good Heavens ! as if there had been any celestial wonder in the circumstance ! It was Lady Maria come out for a walk . He had not been thinking about her . She was , to say truth , for the moment so utterly out of the young gentleman 's mind , that her sudden re - entry there and appearance in the body startled Mr. Warrington 's faculties , and caused those guilty blushes to crowd into his cheeks . No . He was not even thinking of her ! A week ago a year , a hundred years ago it seemed he would not have been surprised to meet her anywhere . Appearing from amidst darkling shrubberies , gliding over green garden terraces , loitering on stairs or corridors , hovering even in his dreams , all day or all night , bodily or spiritually , he had been accustomed to meet her . A week ago his heart used to beat . A week ago , and at the very instant when he jumped out of his sleep , there was her idea smiling on him . And it was only last Tuesday that his love was stabbed and slain , and he not only had left off mourning for her , but had forgotten her ! "
114821	114825	114811	114811	You	6991	" she said . "
114844	114845	114834	114834	I	0	" "
114849	114853	114834	114834	I	0	" said Harry , "
114864	114872	114811	114811	You	6991	" he was thinking of the evening hymn "
114878	114937	114940	114940	your	6991	" He turned very red again as he spoke , he felt he was perjuring himself horribly . The poor lady was agitated herself by the flutter and agitation which she saw in her young companion . Gracious Heaven ! Could that tremor and excitement mean that she was mistaken , and that the lad was still faithful ? "
114951	114965	114940	114940	your	6991	" she said , waving round a curtsey to the other two gentlemen : "
114974	115113	114940	114940	your	6991	" Harry could not but offer the arm , and press the hand that lay against his heart . Maria made another fine curtsey to Harry 's bowing companions , and walked off with her prize . In her griefs , in her rages , in the pains and anguish of wrong and desertion , how a woman remembers to smile , curtsey , caress , dissemble ! How resolutely they discharge the social proprieties ; how they have a word , or a hand , or a kind little speech or reply for the passing acquaintance who crosses unknowing the path of the tragedy , drops a light airy remark or two happy self - satisfied rogue ! and passes on . He passes on , and thinks that woman was rather pleased with what I said . "
115146	116029	115135	115135	she	690	" O you wiseacre ! Such was Jack Morris 's observation and case as he walked away leaning on the arm of his noble friend , and thinking the whole Society of the Wells was looking at him . He had made some exquisite remarks about a particular run of cards at Lady Flushington 's the night before , and Lady Maria had replied graciously and neatly , and so away went Jack perfectly happy . The absurd creature ! I declare we know nothing of anybody but that for my part I know better and better every day . You enter smiling to see your new acquaintance , Mrs. A. and her charming family . You make your bow in the elegant drawing - room of Mr. and Mrs. B. ? I tell you that in your course through life you are for ever putting your great clumsy foot upon the mute invisible wounds of bleeding tragedies . Mrs. B. 's closets for what you know are stuffed with skeletons . Look there under the sofa - cushion . Is that merely Missy 's doll , or is it the limb of a stifled Cupid peeping out ? What do you suppose are those ashes smouldering in the grate ? Very likely a suttee has been offered up there just before you came in : a faithful heart has been burned out upon a callous corpse , and you are looking on the cineri doloso . You see B. and his wife receiving their company before dinner . Gracious powers ! Do you know that that bouquet which she wears is a signal to Captain C. , and that he will find a note under the little bronze Shakespeare on the mantelpiece in the study ? And with all this you go up and say some uncommonly neat thing as you fancy to Mrs. B. about the weather clever dog ! , or about Lady E. 's last party fashionable buck ! , or about the dear children in the nursery insinuating rogue ! . Heaven and earth , my good sir , how can you tell that B. is not going to pitch all the children out of the nursery window this very night , or that his lady has not made an arrangement for leaving them , and running off with the Captain ? How do you know that those footmen are not disguised bailiffs ? that yonder large - looking butler really a skeleton is not the pawnbroker 's man ? and that there are not skeleton rotis and entrees under every one of the covers ? Look at their feet peeping from under the tablecloth . Mind how you stretch out your own lovely little slippers , madam , lest you knock over a rib or two . Remark the death's - head moths fluttering among the flowers . See , the pale winding - sheets gleaming in the wax - candles ! I know it is an old story , and especially that this preacher has yelled vanitas vanitatum five hundred times before . I ca n't help always falling upon it , and cry out with particular loudness and wailing , and become especially melancholy , when I see a dead love tied to a live love . Ha ! I look up from my desk , across the street : and there come in Mr. and Mrs. D. from their walk in Kensington Gardens . How she hangs on him ! how jolly and happy he looks , as the children frisk round ! My poor dear benighted Mrs. D. , there is a Regent 's Park as well as a Kensington Gardens in the world . Go in , fond wretch ! Smilingly lay before him what you know he likes for dinner . Show him the children 's copies and the reports of their masters . Go with Missy to the piano , and play your artless duet together ; and fancy you are happy ! There go Harry and Maria taking their evening walk on the common , away from the village which is waking up from its after - dinner siesta , and where the people are beginning to stir and the music to play . With the music Maria knows Madame de Bernstein will waken : with the candles she must be back to the tea - table and the cards . Never mind . Here is a minute . It may be my love is dead , but here is a minute to kneel over the grave and pray by it . He certainly was not thinking about her : he was startled and did not even know her . He was laughing and talking with Jack Morris and my Lord March . He is twenty years younger than she . Never mind . To - day is to - day in which we are all equal . This moment is ours . Come , let us walk a little way over the heath , Harry . She will go , though she feels a deadly assurance that he will tell her all is over between them , and that he loves the dark - haired girl at Oakhurst .
116036	116069	116071	116071	Maria	690	" Let me hear about those children , child , whom I saw running about at the house where they took you in , poor dear boy , after your dreadful fall ? "
116079	116116	116071	116071	Maria	690	" Oh , that fall , Harry ! I thought I should have died when I saw it ! You need n't squeeze one 's arm so . You know you do n't care for me ? "
116117	116137	116139	116140	Mr. Warrington	701	" The people are the very best , kindest , dearest people I have ever met in the world , "
116142	116225	116227	116227	Harry	701	" Mrs. Lambert was a friend of my mother when she was in Europe for her education . Colonel Lambert is a most accomplished gentleman , and has seen service everywhere . He was in Scotland with his Royal Highness , in Flanders , at Minorca . No natural parents could be kinder than they were to me . How can I show my gratitude to them ? I want to make them a present : I must make them a present , "
116248	116271	116273	116274	Lady Maria	690	" We can go to the toy - shop , my dear , and buy a couple of dolls for the children , "
116276	116291	116273	116274	Lady Maria	690	" You would offend the parents by offering anything like payment for their kindness . "
116292	116316	116227	116227	Harry	701	" Dolls for Hester and Theo ! Why , do you think a woman is not woman till she is forty , Maria ? "
116334	116398	116227	116227	Harry	701	" I can tell you Miss Hester by no means considers herself a child , and Miss Theo is older than her sister . They know ever so many languages . They have read books oh ! piles and piles of books ! They play on the harpsichord and sing together admirable ; and Theo composes , and sings songs of her own . "
116399	116436	116273	116274	Lady Maria	690	" Indeed ! I scarcely saw them . I thought they were children . They looked quite childish . I had no idea they had all these perfections , and were such wonders of the world . "
116437	116475	116477	116477	Harry	701	" That 's just the way with you women ! At home , if me or George praised a woman , Mrs. Esmond , and Mountain , too , would be sure to find fault with her ! "
116479	116499	116477	116477	Harry	701	" I am sure I would find fault with no one who is kind to you , Mr. Warrington , "
116503	116536	116477	116477	Harry	701	" though you are not angry with me for envying them because they had to take care of you when you were wounded and ill whilst I I had to leave you ? "
116537	116543	116273	116274	Lady Maria	690	" You dear good Maria ! "
116544	116625	116477	116477	Harry	701	" No , Harry ! I am not dear and good . There , sir , you need n't be so pressing in your attentions . Look ! There is your black man walking with a score of other wretches in livery . The horrid creatures are going to fuddle at the tea - garden , and get tipsy like their masters . That dreadful Mr. Morris was perfectly tipsy when I came to you , and frightened you so . "
116626	116649	116651	116651	Harry	701	" I had just won great bets from both of them . What shall I buy for you , my dear cousin ? "
116675	116691	116692	116692	he	701	" For the honour of Virginia I was determined to show them what jumping was , "
116695	116709	116692	116692	he	701	" With a little practice I think I could leap two foot farther . "
116721	116731	116732	116732	she	690	" But you must beware about play , child , "
116735	116793	116732	116732	she	690	" You know it hath been the ruin of our family . My brother Castlewood , Will , our poor father , our aunt , Lady Castlewood herself , they have all been victims to it : as for my Lord March , he is the most dreadful gambler and the most successful of all the nobility . "
116794	116814	116816	116816	Harry	701	" I do n't intend to be afraid of him , nor of his friend Mr. Jack Morris neither , "
116824	116868	116816	116816	Harry	701	" What do you play at Aunt Bernstein 's ? Cribbage , all - fours , brag , whist , commerce , piquet , quadrille ? I 'm ready at any of 'em . What o'clock is that striking sure ' tis seven ! "
116869	116877	116881	116881	Maria	690	" And you want to begin now , "
116883	116901	116881	116881	Maria	690	" You do n't care about walking with your poor cousin . Not long ago you did . "
116902	116911	116913	116914	Mr. Harry	701	" Hey ! Youth is youth , cousin ! "
116921	116931	116918	116918	his	701	" and a young fellow must have his fling ! "
118019	118023	118025	118026	my Lord	2193	" Our hostess , "
118049	118104	118025	118026	my Lord	2193	" puts me in mind of Covent Garden in my youth . Then it was the court end of the town , and inhabited by the highest fashion . Now , a nobleman 's house is a gaming - house , or you may go in with a friend and call for a bottle . "
118105	118120	118130	118130	his	22364	" Hey ! a bottle and a tavern are good things in their way , "
118133	118181	118130	118130	his	22364	" I was not born before the Georges came in , though I intend to live to a hundred . I never knew the Bernstein but as an old woman ; and if she ever had beauty , hang me if I know how she spent it . "
118182	118194	118197	118198	Jack Morris	1059	" No , hang me , how did she spend it ? "
118200	118237	118197	118198	Jack Morris	1059	" Here 's a table ! Shall we sit down and have a game ? Do n't let the Frenchman come in . He wo n't pay . Mr. Warrington , will you take a card ? "
118256	118265	118267	118269	the elder nobleman	7053	" You have come too late , Baron , "
118278	118303	118267	118269	the elder nobleman	7053	" We have made our game . What , have you forgotten Mr. Warrington of Virginia the young gentleman whom you met in London ? "
118304	118340	118342	118343	the Baron	6793	" The young gentleman whom I met at Arthur 's Chocolate House had black hair , a little cocked nose , and was by no means so fortunate in his personal appearance as Mr. Warrington , "
118351	118385	118342	118343	the Baron	6793	" Warrington , Dorrington , Harrington ? We of the continent can not retain your insular names . I certify that this gentleman is not the individual of whom I spoke at dinner . "
118650	118659	118663	118663	March	1061	" Come and cut the cards for us , "
118677	118704	118663	118663	March	1061	" Cut the cards and bring us luck , Lady Maria ! We have had none to - night , and Mr. Warrington is winning everything . "
118705	118716	118718	118719	the lady	2586	" I hope you are not playing high , Harry ? "
118723	118730	118732	118733	my lord	2193	" Oh no , only sixpences , "
118737	118741	118743	118744	Mr. Morris	1059	" Only sixpences , "
118842	118857	118830	118831	Mr. Morris	1059	" Hang it , Morris , play your cards , and hold your tongue ! "
118956	118971	118945	118945	he	1061	" The bet as before , Mr. Warrington , or shall we double it ? "
118972	118980	118982	118983	Mr. Warrington	701	" Anything you like , my lord , "
118988	118997	118982	118983	Mr. Warrington	701	" We will say , then , shillings . "
118998	119003	119005	119006	Mr. Warrington	701	" Yes , shillings , "
119061	119070	119057	119059	Mr. Henry Warrington	701	" TUNBRIDGE WELLS , August 10 , 1756 . "
119317	119651	119652	119652	Warrington	1070	" He has had the devil 's luck here , and has been winning everything , whilst his old card - playing beldam of an aunt has been losing . A few nights ago , when I first had the ill - luck to make his acquaintance , he beat me in jumping having practised the art amongst the savages , and running away from bears in his native woods ; he won bets off me and Jack Morris about my weight ; and at night , when we sat down to play , at old Bernstein 's , he won from us all round . If you can settle our last Epsom account please hand over to Mr. Warrington 350 pounds , which I still owe him , after pretty well emptying my pocket - book . Chesterfield has dropped six hundred to him , too ; but his lordship does not wish to have it known , having sworn to give up play and live cleanly . Jack Morris , who has not been hit as hard as either of us , and can afford it quite as well , for the fat chuff has no houses nor train to keep up , and all his misbegotten father 's money in hand , roars like a bull of Bashan about his losses . We had a second night 's play , en petit comite , and Barbeau served us a fair dinner in a private room . Mr. Warrington holds his tongue like a gentleman , and none of us have talked about our losses ; but the whole place does , for us . Yesterday the Cattarina looked as sulky as thunder , because I would not give her a diamond necklace , and says I refuse her because I have lost five thousand to the Virginian . My old Duchess of Q. has the very same story , besides knowing to a fraction what Chesterfield and Jack have lost . "
119745	119785	119790	119791	Mr. Warrington	1070	" He is a fortunate fellow , certainly . He has youth which is not deboshed by evil courses in Virginia , as ours is in England ; he has good health , good looks , and good luck . "
119845	119852	119831	119831	I	0	" Yours ever , dear George , "
119856	119857	119831	119831	I	0	" "
119877	119877	119859	119861	George Augustus Selwyn	1097	"
121140	121146	121148	121149	the Baroness	2319	" Why , my dear , "
121151	121172	121148	121149	the Baroness	2319	" boys will be boys , and I do n't want Harry to be the first milksop in his family ! "
122183	122193	122195	122195	Harry	701	" I have not seen you these many days , "
122197	122204	122195	122195	Harry	701	" You have had other companions , "
122211	122224	122226	122228	the young man	2122	" But I had rather be with you than any of them , "
122230	122244	122246	122247	the other	19802	" Indeed I might be better company for you than some of them , "
122249	122257	122246	122247	the other	19802	" Is it Captain Batts you mean ? "
122261	122318	122320	122321	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" He is no favourite of mine , I own ; he bore a rascally reputation when he was in the army , and I doubt has not mended it since he was turned out . You certainly might find a better friend than Captain Batts . Pardon the freedom which I take in saying so , "
122325	122362	122320	122321	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" Friend ! he is no friend : he only teaches me to play tennis : he is hand - in - glove with my lord , and all the people of fashion here who play . "
122363	122372	122374	122375	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" I am not a man of fashion , "
122377	122417	122419	122420	Mr. Warrington	701	" My dear Colonel , what is the matter ? Have I angered you in any way ? You speak almost as if I had , and I am not conscious of having done anything to forfeit your regard , "
122422	122433	122435	122436	the Colonel	19708	" I will be free with you , Mr. Warrington , "
122440	122456	122435	122436	the Colonel	19708	" and tell you with frankness that I do n't like some of your friends ! "
122457	122474	122476	122476	Harry	701	" Why , sure , they are men of the first rank and fashion in England , "
122489	122601	122476	122476	Harry	701	" Exactly , they are men of too high rank and too great fashion for a hard - working poor soldier like me ; and if you continue to live with such , believe me , you will find numbers of us humdrum people ca n't afford to keep such company . I am here , Mr. Warrington , paying my addresses to an honourable lady . I met you yesterday openly walking with a French ballet - dancer , and you took off your hat . I must frankly tell you , that I had rather you would not take off your hat when you go out in such company . "
122602	122605	122607	122608	Mr. Warrington	701	" Sir , "
122614	122632	122607	122608	Mr. Warrington	701	" do you mean that I am to forgo the honour of Colonel Wolfe 's acquaintance altogether ? "
122633	122651	122653	122654	Colonel Wolfe	1031	" I certainly shall request you to do so when you are in company with that person , "
122680	122696	122698	122699	Mr. Warrington	701	" Great heavens ! what a shame it is to speak so of any woman ! "
122701	122715	122698	122699	Mr. Warrington	701	" How dare any man say that that poor creature is not honest ? "
122716	122725	122727	122728	the other	19802	" You ought to know best , sir , "
122737	122746	122727	122728	the other	19802	" or the world belies you very much . "
122747	122907	122909	122909	Harry	701	" What ought I to know best ? I see a poor little French dancer who is come hither with her mother , and is ordered by the doctors to drink the waters . I know that a person of my rank in life does not ordinarily keep company with people of hers ; but really , Colonel Wolfe , are you so squeamish ? Have I not heard you say that you did not value birth , and that all honest people ought to be equal ? Why should I not give this little unprotected woman my arm ? there are scarce half a dozen people here who can speak a word of her language . I can talk a little French , and she is welcome to it ; and if Colonel Wolfe does not choose to touch his hat to me , when I am walking with her , by George he may leave it alone , "
122914	122922	122924	122925	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" You do n't mean to say , "
122930	122941	122924	122925	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" that you do n't know the woman 's character ? "
122942	122991	122909	122909	Harry	701	" Of course , sir , she is a dancer , and , I suppose , no better or worse than her neighbours . But I mean to say that , had she been a duchess , or your grandmother , I could n't have respected her more . "
122992	123012	122924	122925	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" You do n't mean to say that you did not win her at dice , from Lord March ? "
123013	123017	122924	122925	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" At what ? "
123018	123074	122909	122909	Harry	701	" At dice , from Lord March . Everybody knows the story . Not a person at the Wells is ignorant of it . I heard it but now , in the company of that good old Mr. Richardson , and the ladies were saying that you would be a character for a colonial Lovelace . "
123075	123086	123088	123089	Harry Warrington	701	" What on earth else have they said about me ? "
123155	123162	123164	123165	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" I tell you these things , "
123167	123239	123164	123165	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" because it is fair that you should know what is said of you , and because I do heartily believe , from your manner of meeting the last charge brought against you , that you are innocent of most of the other counts . I feel , Mr. Warrington , that I , for one , have been doing you a wrong ; and sincerely ask you to pardon me . "
123451	123459	123461	123462	the Colonel	19708	" It ca n't be , sir , "
123464	123667	123461	123462	the Colonel	19708	" that a man is to pass his days at horse - racing and tennis , and his nights carousing or at cards . Sure , every man was made to do some work : and a gentleman , if he has none , must make some . Do you know the laws of your country , Mr. Warrington ? Being a great proprietor , you will doubtless one day be a magistrate at home . Have you travelled over the country , and made yourself acquainted with its trades and manufactures ? These are fit things for a gentleman to study , and may occupy him as well as a cock - fight or a cricket - match . Do you know anything of our profession ? That , at least , you will allow , is a noble one ; and , believe me , there is plenty in it to learn , and suited , I should think , to you . I speak of it rather than of books and the learned professions , because , as far as I can judge , your genius does not lie that way . But honour is the aim of life , "
123672	123792	123669	123670	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" and every man can serve his country one way or the other . Be sure , sir , that idle bread is the most dangerous of all that is eaten ; that cards and pleasure may be taken by way of pastime after work , but not instead of work , and all day . And do you know , Mr. Warrington , instead of being the Fortunate Youth , as all the world calls you , I think you are rather Warrington the Unlucky , for you are followed by daily idleness , daily flattery , daily temptation , and the Lord , I say , send you a good , deliverance out of your good fortune . "
125412	125432	125434	125435	Mr. Lambert	1000	" Hadst thou brought me a regiment , James , I think I should not have been better pleased , "
125547	125556	125558	125559	the Colonel	19708	" What shall we do , my dear ? "
125564	125590	125558	125559	the Colonel	19708	" The hay is in , the corn wo n't be cut for a fortnight , the horses have nothing to do . Suppose we ... "
125604	125613	125615	125616	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" My dearest Martin ! The very thing ! "

125649	125683	125638	125639	young Charley	722	" The very thing is to go to supper . Come , Doctor ! We will have a bottle of wine to - night , and drink repentance to all who think evil . "
125684	125687	125689	125690	the Doctor	5377	" Amen , "
125692	125698	125689	125690	the Doctor	5377	" with all my heart ! "

126511	126527	126529	126530	Mr. Sampson	1022	" All Hampshire had heard of his successes at Tunbridge , successes of every kind , "
126576	126583	126585	126587	the jolly chaplain	7398	" Though I have had plenty , "
126589	126602	126585	126587	the jolly chaplain	7398	" that is no reason why I should not have plenty more , "
126635	126639	126640	126640	Harry	701	" plenty more , "
126963	126970	126971	126971	she	2505	" The cards do n't cheat , "

128182	128463	128464	128464	I	0	" I writ you a letter by the last monthly packet , informing my honoured mother of the little accident I had on the road hither , and of the kind friends who I found and whom took me in . Since then I have been profiting of the fine weather and the good company here , and have made many friends among our nobility , whose acquaintance I am sure you will not be sorry that I should make . Among their lordships I may mention the famous Earl of Chesterfield , late Ambassador to Holland , and Viceroy of the Kingdom of Ireland ; the Earl of March and Ruglen , who will be Duke of Queensberry at the death of his Grace ; and her Grace the Duchess , a celebrated beauty of the Queen 's time , when she remembers my grandpapa at Court . These and many more persons of the first fashion attend my aunt 's assemblies , which are the most crowded at this crowded place . Also on my way hither I stayed at Westerham , at the house of an officer , Lieut.-Gen . Wolfe , who served with my grandfather and General Webb in the famous wars of the Duke of Marlborough . Mr. Wolfe has a son , Lieut.-Col . James Wolfe , engaged to be married to a beautiful lady now in this place , Miss Lowther of the North and though but 30 years old he is looked up to as much as any officer in the whole army , and has served with honour under his Royal Highness the Duke wherever our arms have been employed . "
128612	128692	128705	128707	my honoured mother	4620	" I am thankful that I have been quite without occasion to use your excellent family pills . Gumbo hath taken them with great benefit , who grows fat and saucy upon English beef , ale , and air . He sends his humble duty to his mistress , and prays Mrs. Mountain to remember him to all his fellow - servants , especially Dinah and Lily , for whom he has bought posey - rings at Tunbridge Fair . "
128929	128975	128910	128913	a short fat man	7555	" My aunt and my cousin , the Lady Maria , desire their affectionate compliments to you , and with best regards for Mountain , to whom I enclose a note , I am , Honoured madam , your dutiful son , H. ESMOND WARRINGTON . "
128983	129092	128978	128979	Madam Esmond	683	" From my son . Received October 15 at Richmond . Sent 16 jars preserved peaches , 224 lbs . best tobacco , 24 finest hams , per Royal William of Liverpool , 8 jars peaches , 12 hams for my nephew , the Rt . Honourable the Earl of Castlewood . 4 jars , 6 hams for the Baroness Bernstein , ditto ditto for Mrs. Lambert of Oakhurst , Surrey , and 1 2 cwt . tobacco .

129977	130011	129973	129973	they	7592	" Oh , it was highly immoral and improper of Mr. Warrington to be writing home humdrum demure letters to his dear mamma , when he was playing all sorts of merry pranks ! "
130020	130052	130056	130056	she	7597	" Yes , dear grandmamma or aunt , as may be , it was very wrong of him : and I suppose you never had your fun when you were young . "

131691	131697	131699	131699	he	4987	" You see , sir , "
131701	131812	131699	131699	he	4987	" I am of the world , and must do as the rest of the world does . I have led a rough life , Mr. Warrington , and ca n't afford to be more particular than my neighbours . Video meliora , deteriora sequor , as we said at college . I have got a little sister , who is at boarding - school , not very far from here , and , as I keep a decent tongue in my head when I am talking with my little Patty , and expect others to do as much , sure I may try and do as much by you . "
131917	131929	131930	131930	she	2597	" We must find a good wife for him , Chaplain , "
131936	131984	131930	131930	she	2597	" I have one or two in my eye , who , I think , will suit him . We must set him up here ; he never will bear going back to his savages again , or to live with his little Methodist of a mother . "
132734	132750	132752	132753	Mr. Sampson	910	" What a reputation , sir , they have made for you in this place ! "
132766	132775	132752	132753	Mr. Sampson	910	" Monsieur de Richelieu was nothing to you ! "
132776	132794	132797	132797	Harry	701	" How do you mean , Monsieur de Richelieu ? Never was at Minorca in my life , "
132886	132891	132894	132894	Harry	701	" Who says so ? "
132898	132916	132894	132894	Harry	701	" I should like to meet the man who dares say so , and confound the villain ! "
132917	132928	132930	132931	Mr. Sampson	910	" I should not like to show him to you , "
132935	132944	132930	132931	Mr. Sampson	910	" It might be the worse for him . "
132945	132965	132967	132968	Mr. Warrington	701	" It 's a shame to speak with such levity about the character of ladies or of gentlemen either , "
132980	132986	132988	132989	the chaplain	4987	" So I told them , "
133032	133096	132992	132992	his	4987	" It 's a shame , I say , to talk away the reputation of any man or woman as people do here . Do you know , in our country , a fellow 's ears would not be safe ; and a little before I left home , three brothers shot down a man , for having spoken ill of their sister . "
133097	133103	133105	133105	Sampson	910	" Serve the villain right ! "
133107	133135	132992	132992	his	4987	" Already they have had that calumny about me set a - going here , Sampson , about me and the poor little French dancing - girl . "
133136	133141	133143	133144	Mr. Sampson	910	" I have heard , "
133153	133160	133143	133144	Mr. Sampson	910	" Wicked ; was n't it ? "
133161	133164	132992	132992	his	4987	" Abominable . "
133165	133182	132992	132992	his	4987	" They said the very same thing about my Lord March . Is n't it shameful ? "
133183	133188	133190	133191	Mr. Sampson	910	" Indeed it is , "
133200	133319	133190	133191	Mr. Sampson	910	" I do n't know what I should do if these stories were to come to my mother 's ears . It would break her heart , I do believe it would . Why , only a few days before you came , a military friend of mine , Mr. Wolfe , told me how the most horrible lies were circulated about me . Good heavens ! What do they think a gentleman of my name and country can be capable of I a seducer of women ? They might as well say I was a horse - stealer or a housebreaker . I vow if I hear any man say so , I 'll have his ears ! "
133320	133343	133345	133346	Mr. Sampson	910	" I have read , sir , that the Grand Seignior of Turkey has bushels of ears sometimes sent in to him , "
133350	133371	133345	133346	Mr. Sampson	910	" If you took all those that had heard scandal against you or others , what basketsful you would fill ! "
133372	133403	133405	133406	the Virginian	19826	" And so I would , Sampson , as soon as look at 'em : any fellow 's who said a word against a lady or a gentleman of honour ! "
133408	133459	133461	133462	the chaplain	4987	" If you 'll go down to the Well , you 'll find a harvest of 'em . I just came from there . It was the high tide of Scandal . Detraction was at its height . And you may see the nymphas discentes and the aures satyrorum acutas , "
133471	133481	133461	133462	the chaplain	4987	" That may be as you say , Sampson , "
133486	133506	133482	133483	Mr. Warrington	701	" but if ever I hear any man speak against my character I 'll punish him . Mark that . "
133507	133547	133461	133462	the chaplain	4987	" I shall be very sorry for his sake , that I should ; for you 'll mark him in a way he wo n't like , sir ; and I know you are a man of your word . "
133548	133575	133482	133483	Mr. Warrington	701	" You may be sure of that , Sampson . And now shall we go to dinner , and afterwards to my Lady Trumpington 's tea ? "
133576	133592	133594	133595	Mr. Sampson	910	" You know , sir , I ca n't resist a card or a bottle , "
133597	133612	133594	133595	Mr. Sampson	910	" Let us have the last first and then the first shall come last . "
133869	133874	133865	133866	the Vegetarians	7777	" Cabbage for ever ? "
134329	134357	134359	134361	the impetuous chaplain	7798	" I am glad to hear what your conduct has really been with regard to the Cattarina , Mr. Warrington ; I am glad from my soul , "
134363	134404	134406	134406	he	7798	" The wine is with you . You have shown that you can bear down calumny , and resist temptation . Ah ! my dear sir , men are not all so fortunate . What famous good wine this is ! "
134412	134426	134406	134406	he	7798	" A toast from you , my dear sir , if you please ? "
134427	134440	134442	134443	Mr. Warrington	701	" I give you ' Miss Fanny Mountain , of Virginia , ' "
134463	134473	134475	134476	the chaplain	4987	" One of your American conquests , I suppose ? "
134478	134503	134505	134507	the young gentleman	2119	" Nay , she is but ten years old , and I have never made any conquests at all in Virginia , Mr. Sampson , "
134509	134526	134505	134507	the young gentleman	2119	" You are like a true gentleman , and do n't kiss and tell , sir . "
134527	134573	134575	134577	the young toper	7802	" I neither kiss nor tell . It is n't the custom of our country , Sampson , to ruin girls , or frequent the society of low women . We Virginian gentlemen honour women : we do n't wish to bring them to shame , "
134585	134620	134575	134577	the young toper	7802	" The young lady whose name I mentioned hath lived in our family since her infancy , and I would shoot the man who did her a wrong ; by Heaven , I would ! "
134621	134645	134647	134649	the enthusiastic Sampson	910	" Your sentiments do you honour ! Let me shake hands with you ! I will shake hands with you , Mr. Warrington , "
134651	134724	134647	134649	the enthusiastic Sampson	910	" And let me tell you ' tis the grasp of honest friendship offered you , and not merely the poor retainer paying court to the wealthy patron . No ! with such liquor as this , all men are equal ; faith , all men are rich , whilst it lasts ! and Tom Sampson is as wealthy with his bottle as your honour with all the acres of your principality ! "
134725	134734	134736	134736	Harry	701	" Let us have another bottle of riches , "
134742	134753	134736	134736	Harry	701	" Encore du cachet jaune , mon bon Monsieur Barbeau ! "
134763	134782	134647	134649	the enthusiastic Sampson	910	" Another bottle of riches ! Capital , capital ! How beautifully you speak French , Mr. Harry ! "
134783	134790	134792	134792	Harry	701	" I do speak it well , "
134794	134809	134792	134792	Harry	701	" At least , when I speak , Monsieur Barbeau understands me well enough . "
134810	134845	134647	134649	the enthusiastic Sampson	910	" You do everything well , I think . You succeed in whatever you try . That is why they have fancied here you have won the hearts of so many women , sir . "
134846	134883	134647	134649	the enthusiastic Sampson	910	" There you go again about the women ! I tell you I do n't like these stories about women . Confound me , Sampson , why is a gentleman 's character to be blackened so ? "
134884	134906	134908	134909	the chaplain	4987	" Well , at any rate , there is one , unless my eyes deceive me very much indeed , sir ! "
134911	134917	134908	134909	the chaplain	4987	" Whom do you mean ? "
134925	134954	134956	134957	Mr. Sampson	910	" Nay , I name no names . It is n't for a poor chaplain to meddle with his betters ' doings , or to know their thoughts , "
134959	134967	134956	134957	Mr. Sampson	910	" Thoughts ! what thoughts , Sampson ? "
134968	135021	134647	134649	the enthusiastic Sampson	910	" I fancied I saw , on the part of a certain lovely and respected lady at Castlewood , a preference exhibited . I fancied , on the side of a certain distinguished young gentleman , a strong liking manifested itself : but I may have been wrong , and ask pardon . "
135022	135029	135032	135034	the young man	2122	" Oh , Sampson , Sampson ! "
135036	135092	135032	135034	the young man	2122	" I tell you I am miserable . I tell you I have been longing for some one to confide in , or ask advice of . You do know , then , that there has been something going on something between me and help Mr. Sampson , Monsieur Barbeau and and some one else ? "
135093	135102	135104	135105	the chaplain	4987	" I have watched it this month past , "
135107	135124	135126	135128	the other hotly	7807	" Confound me , sir , do you mean you have been a spy on me ? "
135130	135199	135126	135128	the other hotly	7807	" A spy ! You made little disguise of the matter , Mr. Warrington , and her ladyship was n't a much better hand at deceiving . You were always together . In the shrubberies , in the walks , in the village , in the galleries of the house , you always found a pretext for being together , and plenty of eyes besides mine watched you . "
135200	135211	135213	135214	the lad	2434	" Gracious powers ! What did you see , Sampson ? "
135216	135234	135236	135237	the chaplain	4987	" Nay , sir , ' tis forbidden to kiss and tell . I say so again , "
135246	135251	135252	135252	he	2122	" Oh , Sampson ! "
135255	135264	135252	135252	he	2122	" can I can I confide in you ? "
135265	135283	135285	135286	the chaplain	4987	" Dearest sir dear generous youth you know I would shed my heart 's blood for you ! "
135303	135361	135362	135363	The parson	2199	" Oh , Sampson ! I tell you I am miserable . With all this play and wine , whilst I have been here , I tell you I have been trying to drive away care . I own to you that when we were at Castlewood there were things passed between a certain lady and me . "
135374	135483	135362	135363	The parson	2199	" And they 've made me wretched , those things have . I mean , you see , that if a gentleman has given his word , why , it 's his word , and he must stand by it , you know . I mean that I thought I loved her , and so I do very much , and she 's a most dear , kind , darling , affectionate creature , and very handsome , too , quite beautiful ; but then , you know , our ages , Sampson ! Think of our ages , Sampson ! She 's as old as my mother ! "
135484	135491	135572	135572	he	4987	" Who would never forgive you . "
135492	135512	135514	135514	Harry	701	" I do n't intend to let anybody meddle in my affairs , not Madam Esmond nor anybody else , "
135516	135540	135514	135514	Harry	701	" but you see , Sampson , she is old and , oh , hang it ! Why did Aunt Bernstein tell me ? "
135541	135546	135572	135572	he	4987	" Tell you what ? "
135547	135561	135514	135514	Harry	701	" Something I ca n't divulge to anybody , something that tortures me ! "
135562	135567	135568	135569	the chaplain	4987	" Not about the the "
135623	135638	135641	135641	Harry	701	" Yes , yes , every one of 'em false every one of 'em ! "
135643	135652	135641	135641	Harry	701	" Great powers , what do you mean ? "
135657	135664	135666	135666	Harry	701	" These , sir , these ! "
135677	135763	135666	135666	Harry	701	" I did n't know it when I asked her . I swear I did n't know it . Oh , it 's horrible it 's horrible ! and it has caused me nights of agony , Sampson . My dear old grandfather had a set a Frenchman at Charleston made them for him , and we used to look at 'em grinning in a tumbler , and when they were out , his jaws used to fall in I never thought she had 'em . "
135764	135770	135773	135774	the chaplain	4987	" Had what , sir ? "
135776	135790	135792	135792	Harry	701	" Confound it , sir , do n't you see I mean teeth ? "
135798	135804	135792	135792	Harry	701	" Nay , only two . "
135805	135816	135818	135820	the young man	2122	" And how the devil do you know , sir ? "
135824	135855	135818	135820	the young man	2122	" I I had it from her maid . She had two teeth knocked out by a stone which cut her lip a little , and they have been replaced . "
135856	135873	135875	135876	the boy	2227	" Oh , Sampson , do you mean to say they ai n't all sham ones ? "
135878	135919	135875	135876	the boy	2227	" But two , sir , at least so Peggy told me , and she would just as soon have blabbed about the whole two - and - thirty the rest are as sound as yours , which are beautiful . "
135920	135934	135936	135938	the young gentleman	2119	" And her hair , Sampson , is that all right , too ? "
135940	136010	135936	135938	the young gentleman	2119	" ' Tis lovely I have seen that . I can take my oath to that . Her ladyship can sit upon it ; and her figure is very fine ; and her skin is as white as snow ; and her heart is the kindest that ever was ; and I know , that is I feel sure , it is very tender about you , Mr. Warrington . "
136011	136106	135875	135876	the boy	2227	" Oh , Sampson ! Heaven , Heaven bless you ! What a weight you 've taken off my mind with those those never mind them ! Oh , Sam ! How happy that is , no , no ob , how miserable I am ! She 's as old as Madam Esmond by George she is she 's as old as my mother . You would n't have a fellow marry a woman as old as his mother ? It 's too bad : by George it is . It 's too bad . "
136147	136158	136160	136161	the chaplain	4987	" You do n't want to marry her , then ? "
136163	136197	136160	136161	the chaplain	4987	" What 's that to you , sir ? I 've promised her , and an Esmond a Virginia Esmond mind that Mr. What's - your - name Sampson has but his word ! "
136213	136223	136226	136226	Harry	701	" Mind you , I said a Virginia Esmond , "
136233	136290	136226	136226	Harry	701	" I do n't mean the younger branch here . I do n't mean Will , who robbed me about the horse , and whose bones I 'll break . I give you Lady Maria Heaven bless her , and Heaven bless you , Sampson , and you deserve to be a bishop , old boy ! "
136291	136301	136303	136303	Sampson	1156	" There are letters between you , I suppose ? "
136305	136346	136348	136348	he	7825	" Letters ! Dammy , she 's always writing me letters ! never lets me into a window but she sticks one in my cuff . Letters ! that is a good idea ! Look here ! Here 's letters ! "
136367	136380	136382	136383	the chaplain	4987	" Those are letters , indeed . What a post - bag ! "
136385	136398	136382	136383	the chaplain	4987	" But any man who touches them dies dies on the spot ! "
136427	136432	136414	136414	he	701	" Ha ! ha ! "
137306	137313	137315	137315	his	983	" Kitty , beautiful and young , "
137320	137333	137335	137336	the Colonel	19708	" Think that that old lady was once like you , girls ! "
137338	137355	137357	137358	Miss Hetty	993	" Like us , papa ? Well , certainly we never set up for being beauties ! "
137366	137417	137362	137362	her	993	" Yes , like you , you little baggage ; like you at this moment , who want to go to that drum yonder : ' Inflamed with rage at sad restraint Which wise mamma ordained , And sorely vexed to play the saint Whilst wit and beauty reigned . ' "
137418	137451	137454	137458	the satirist of the family	7891	" We were never invited , papa ; and I am sure if there 's no beauty more worth seeing than that , the wit ca n't be much worth the hearing , "
137460	137473	137475	137476	the Colonel	19708	" Oh , but he 's a rare poet , Mat Prior ! "
137478	137558	137475	137476	the Colonel	19708	" though , mind you , girls , you 'll skip over all the poems I have marked with a cross . A rare poet ! and to think you should see one of his heroines ! ' Fondness prevailed , mamma gave way ' she always will , Mrs. Lambert ! ' Fondness prevailed , mamma gave way , Kitty at heart 's desire Obtained the chariot for a day , And set the world on fire ! ' "
137559	137570	137572	137572	mamma	19850	" I am sure it must have been very inflammable , "
137574	137594	137596	137597	the Colonel	19708	" So it was , my dear , twenty years ago , much more inflammable than it is now , "
137599	137605	137607	137607	mamma	894	" Nonsense , Mr. Lambert , "
137611	137616	137618	137618	Hetty	993	" Look , look ! "
137664	137670	137672	137672	Theo	987	" It 's Harry Warrington ! "
137721	137734	137736	137737	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" I heard him preach a most admirable sermon here last Sunday , "
137739	137750	137736	137737	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" a little theatrical , but most striking and eloquent . "
137751	137762	137764	137765	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" You seem to be here most Sundays , James , "
137767	137776	137778	137779	the Colonel	19708	" And Monday , and soon till Saturday , "
137781	137808	137778	137779	the Colonel	19708	" See , Harry has beautified himself already , hath his hair in buckle , and I have no doubt is going to the drum too . "
137809	137821	137823	137825	sober Mr. Wolfe	1036	" I had rather sit quiet generally of a Saturday evening , "
137827	137866	137823	137825	sober Mr. Wolfe	1036	" at any rate , away from card - playing and scandal ; but I own , dear Mrs. Lambert , I am under orders . Shall I go across the way and send Mr. Warrington to you ? "
137867	137901	137903	137905	meek Mrs. Lambert	1180	" No , let him have his sport . We shall see him to - morrow . He wo n't care to be disturbed amidst his fine folks by us country - people , "
137907	137921	137923	137923	Theo	987	" I am glad he is with a clergyman who preaches so well , "
137964	137975	137952	137952	I	0	" The clergyman has a very kind , handsome face . "
137976	137983	137985	137986	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" Here comes a greater clergyman , "
137988	138007	137985	137986	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" It is my Lord of Salisbury , with his blue ribbon , and a chaplain behind him . "
138008	138019	138022	138023	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" And whom a mercy 's name have we here ? "
138112	138119	138121	138122	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Who on earth is this ? "
138124	138136	138138	138140	the waggish Colonel	7914	" Sprechen sie Deutsch ? Ja , meinherr . Nichts verstand , "
138142	138147	138138	138140	the waggish Colonel	7914	" Pooh , Martin . "
138148	138185	138259	138260	the Colonel	19708	" Well , if you ca n't understand High Dutch , my love , how can I help it ? Your education was neglected at school . Can you understand heraldry ? I know you can . "
138186	138190	138192	138192	Charley	702	" I make . "
138198	138212	138192	138192	Charley	702	" three merions on a field or , with an earl 's coronet . "
138213	138230	138138	138140	the waggish Colonel	7914	" A countess 's coronet , my son . The Countess of Yarmouth , my son . "
138231	138238	138138	138140	the waggish Colonel	7914	" And pray who is she ? "
138239	138257	138259	138260	the Colonel	19708	" It hath ever been the custom of our sovereigns to advance persons of distinction to honour , "
138264	138287	138259	138260	the Colonel	19708	" and this eminent lady hath been so promoted by our gracious monarch , to the rank of Countess of this kingdom . "
138288	138294	138296	138298	the daughters together	7916	" But why , papa ? "
138300	138306	138308	138308	mamma	19850	" Never mind , girls ! "
138318	138482	138311	138313	that incorrigible Colonel	7918	" Y , my children , is one of the last and the most awkward letters of the whole alphabet . When I tell you stories , you are always saying Why . Why should my Lord Bishop be cringing to that lady ? Look at him rubbing his fat hands together , and smiling into her face ! It 's not a handsome face any longer . It is all painted red and white like Scaramouch 's in the pantomime . See , there comes another blue - riband , as I live . My Lord Bamborough . The descendant of the Hotspurs . The proudest man in England . He stops , he bows , he smiles ; he is hat in hand , too . See , she taps him with her fan . Get away , you crowd of little blackguard boys , and do n't tread on the robe of the lady whom the King delights to honour . "
138483	138492	138494	138495	the girls	2275	" But why does the King honour her ? "
138499	138545	138494	138495	the girls	2275	" There goes that odious last letter but one ! Did you ever hear of her Grace the Duchess of Kendal ? No . Of the Duchess of Portsmouth ? Non plus . Of the Duchess of La Valliore ? Of Fair Rosamond , then ? "
138546	138569	138571	138572	the mother	3050	" Hush , papa ! There is no need to bring blushes on the cheeks of my dear ones , Martin Lambert ! "
138583	138602	138575	138575	her	3050	" ' Tis not I ; it is their sacred Majesties who are the cause of the shame , "
138611	138646	138604	138609	the son of the old republican	7922	" Think of the bishops of the Church and the proudest nobility of the world cringing and bowing before that painted High Dutch Jezebel . Oh , it 's a shame ! a shame ! "
138647	138650	138654	138655	Colonel Wolfe	1031	" Confusion ! "
138783	138792	138794	138794	mamma	19850	" A penny for little Hetty 's thoughts , "
138806	138823	138825	138825	Hetty	983	" I am thinking what I should do if I saw papa bowing to that woman , "
138932	138937	138938	138938	he	3239	" Look , mother , "
138944	139034	138938	138938	he	3239	" do you see that big man in brown beating all the pillars with a stick ? That is the learned Mr. Johnson . He comes to the Friars sometimes to see our master . He was sitting with some friends just now at the tea - table before Mrs. Brown 's tart - shop . They have tea there , twopence a cup ; I heard Mr. Johnson say he had had seventeen cups that makes two - and - tenpence what a sight of money for tea ! "
139035	139043	139045	139045	Theo	987	" What would you have , Charley ? "
139047	139057	139059	139059	Charley	702	" I think I would have cheese - cakes , "
139072	139082	139084	139084	Charley	702	" and the gentleman whom Mr. Johnson was with , "
139092	139098	139084	139084	Charley	702	" was Mr. Richardson who wrote "
139099	139102	139104	139106	all the women	7943	" Clarissa ! "
139213	139225	139227	139227	Theo	987	" Oh dear me ! he does not look like Grandison ! "
139229	139244	139246	139246	mamma	19850	" I rather think I wish we had not seen him , my dear , "
139276	139290	139270	139271	Miss Hetty	993	" Never mind that little fat man , but look yonder , mamma . "
139390	139397	139399	139399	mamma	19850	" How much finer he is ! "
139401	139417	139419	139419	Theo	987	" How he is improved in his looks ! What has he done to himself ? "
139421	139444	139446	139447	the matron	7970	" Look at his grand lace frills and rules ! My dear , he has not got on our shirts any more , "
139449	139458	139460	139460	papa	19857	" What are you talking about , girls ? "
139502	139506	139508	139508	papa	19857	" Come away ! "
139510	139530	139508	139508	papa	19857	" You have no right to be spying the young fellow . Down with the curtains , I say ! "
140199	140326	140188	140188	papa	19857	" Oh , girls , what good company he was ! And his books are worth a dozen of your milksop Pamelas and Clarissas , Mrs. Lambert : but what woman ever loved true humour ? And there was Mr. Johnson sitting amongst the charity children . Did you see how he turned round to the altar at the Belief , and upset two or three of the scared little urchins in leather breeches ? And what a famous sermon Harry 's parson gave , did n't he ? A sermon about scandal . How , he touched up some of the old harridans who were seated round ! Why was n't Mr. Warrington at church ? It was a shame he was n't at church . "
140327	140340	140342	140343	Miss Hetty	993	" I really did not remark whether he was there or not , "
140360	140386	140351	140351	Theo	987	" Yes , I thought of him , and was sorry he was not there ; and so did you think of him , Hetty . "
140387	140396	140398	140398	Hetty	993	" I did no such thing , miss , "
140400	140416	140398	140398	Hetty	993	" Then why did you whisper to me it was Harry 's clergyman who preached ? "
140417	140495	140351	140351	Theo	987	" To think of Mr. Warrington 's clergyman is not to think of Mr. Warrington . It was a most excellent sermon , certainly , and the children sang most dreadfully out of tune . And there is Lady Maria at the window opposite , smelling at the roses ; and that is Mr. Wolfe 's step , I know his great military tramp . Right left right left ! How do you do , Colonel Wolfe ? "
140496	140506	140508	140509	Colonel Lambert	975	" Why do you look so glum , James ? "
140515	140550	140508	140509	Colonel Lambert	975	" Has the charmer been scolding thee , or is thy conscience pricked by the sermon . Mr. Sampson , is n't the parson 's name ? A famous preacher , on my word ! "
140551	140561	140563	140564	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" A pretty preacher , and a pretty practitioner ! "
140573	140603	140570	140570	his	1036	" Why , I thought the discourse did not last ten minutes , and madam did not sleep one single wink during the sermon , didst thou , Molly ? "
140604	140615	140617	140620	the indignant Colonel Wolfe	1031	" Did you see when the fellow came into church ? "
140622	140645	140617	140620	the indignant Colonel Wolfe	1031	" He came in at the open door of the common , just in time , and as the psalm was over . "
140646	140666	140668	140669	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Well , he had been reading the service probably to some sick person ; there are many here , "
140671	140703	140668	140669	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Reading the service ! Oh , my good Mrs. Lambert ! Do you know where I found him ? I went to look for your young scapegrace of a Virginian . "
140704	140718	140721	140721	Hetty	993	" His own name is a very pretty name , I 'm sure , "
140723	140737	140721	140721	Hetty	993	" It is n't Scapegrace ! It is Henry Esmond Warrington , Esquire . "
140738	140795	140617	140620	the indignant Colonel Wolfe	1031	" Miss Hester , I found the parson in his cassock , and Henry Esmond Warrington , Esquire , in his bedgown , at a quarter before eleven o'clock in the morning , when all the Sunday bells were ringing , and they were playing over a game of piquet they had had the night before ! "
140796	140819	140668	140669	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Well , numbers of good people play at cards of a Sunday . The King plays at cards of a Sunday . "
140820	140826	140721	140721	Hetty	993	" Hush , my dear ! "
140827	140833	140835	140835	Hetty	993	" I know he does , "
140837	140855	140835	140835	Hetty	993	" with that painted person we saw yesterday that Countess what - d'you - call - her ? "
140856	140894	140899	140899	she	993	" I think , my dear Miss Hester , a clergyman had best take to God 's books instead of the Devil 's books on that day and so I took the liberty of telling your parson . "
140911	140937	140899	140899	she	993	" And I told our young friend that I thought he had better have been on his way to church than there in his bedgown . "
140938	140967	140970	140970	Hetty	993	" You would n't have Harry go to church in a dressing - gown and nightcap , Colonel Wolfe ? That would be a pretty sight , indeed ! "
140974	140989	140991	140991	papa	19857	" I would have my little girl 's tongue not wag quite so fast , "
141001	141023	140991	140991	papa	19857	" Not speak when a friend is attacked , and nobody says a word in his favour ? No ; nobody ! "
141085	141103	141078	141079	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" I am sure , Aunt Lambert , I did not intend to hurt Hester 's feelings . "
141104	141109	141110	141110	she	993	" No , James , "
141142	141150	141138	141138	his	1000	" Over the hills and far away , "
141163	141176	141178	141186	the artless young gown - boy from Grey Friars	8031	" I say , you must n't whistle on Sunday , papa ! "
141211	141218	141220	141220	Theo	987	" Oh , you greedy child ! "
141447	141461	141462	141462	she	2201	" Why did we not see you sooner to - day , Harry ? "
141465	141475	141462	141462	she	2201	" I never thought you were here , Theo . "
141476	141487	141510	141510	she	2201	" But you might have seen us if you wished . "
141488	141491	141493	141493	Harry	701	" Where ? "
141495	141500	141501	141501	she	2201	" There , sir , "
141610	141621	141623	141624	the Colonel	19708	" A plague upon all scapegraces , English or Indian ! "
141629	141644	141623	141624	the Colonel	19708	" I wish this one had broke his nose against any doorpost but ours . "
141645	141660	141662	141663	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Perhaps we are to cure him of being a scapegrace , my dear , "
141668	141728	141662	141663	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" and the fall at our door hath something providential in it . You laughed at me , Mr. Lambert , when I said so before ; but if Heaven did not send the young gentleman to us , who did ? And it may be for the blessing and happiness of us all that he came , too . "
141729	141736	141738	141739	the Colonel	19708	" It 's hard , Molly ! "
141741	141885	141738	141739	the Colonel	19708	" We cherish and fondle and rear 'em : we tend them through sickness and health : we toil and we scheme : we hoard away money in the stocking , and patch our own old coats : if they 've a headache we ca n't sleep for thinking of their ailment ; if they have a wish or fancy , we work day and night to compass it , and ' tis darling daddy and dearest pappy , and whose father is like ours ? and so forth . On Tuesday morning I am king of my house and family . On Tuesday evening Prince Whippersnapper makes his appearance , and my reign is over . A whole life is forgotten and forsworn for a pair of blue eyes , a pair of lean shanks , and a head of yellow hair . "
141886	141913	141915	141916	the matron	7970	" ' Tis written that we women should leave all to follow our husband . I think our courtship was not very long , dear Martin ! "
141927	141942	141944	141945	the Colonel	19708	" ' Tis human nature , and what can you expect of the jade ? "
141947	141969	141971	141972	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" And I think I did my duty to my husband , though I own I left my papa for him , "
141976	141993	141995	141997	the good Colonel	8062	" Excellent wench ! Perdition catch my soul ! but I do love thee , Molly ! "
141999	142025	141995	141997	the good Colonel	8062	" but , then , mind you , your father never did me ; and if ever I am to have sons - in - law "
142026	142043	142045	142045	mamma	894	" Ever , indeed ! Of course my girls are to have husbands , Mr. Lambert ! "
142047	142080	142102	142103	the matron	7970	" Well , when they come , I 'll hate them , madam , as your father did me ; and quite right too , for taking his treasure away from him . "
142081	142100	142102	142103	the matron	7970	" Do n't be irreligious and unnatural , Martin Lambert ! I say you are unnatural , sir ! "
142105	142170	142172	142173	Mr. Lambert	1000	" Nay , my dear , I have an old tooth in my left jaw , here ; and ' tis natural that the tooth should come out . But when the toothdrawer pulls it , ' tis natural that I should feel pain . Do you suppose , madam , that I do n't love Hetty better than any tooth in my head ? "
142291	142303	142305	142306	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" It will be a sad thing , parting with her , "
142312	142322	142324	142325	the Colonel	19708	" You have settled that point already , Molly , "
142327	142345	142324	142325	the Colonel	19708	" Had I not best go out and order raisins and corinths for the wedding - cake ? "
142346	142391	142262	142263	What woman	8073	" And then I shall have to leave the house in their charge when I go to her , you know , in Virginia . How many miles is it to Virginia , Martin ? I should think it must be thousands of miles . "
142392	142419	142421	142421	Lambert	983	" A hundred and seventy - three thousand three hundred and ninety - one and three - quarters , my dear , by the near way , "
142425	142440	142421	142421	Lambert	983	" that through Prester John 's country . By the other route , through Persia "
142441	142468	142470	142471	the Colonel	19708	" Oh , give me the one where there is the least of the sea , and your horrid ships , which I ca n't bear ! "
142475	142500	142470	142471	the Colonel	19708	" I hope Rachel Esmond and I shall be better friends . She had a very high spirit when we were girls at school . "
142501	142517	142520	142522	her wondering husband	8077	" Had we not best go about the baby - linen , Mrs. Martin Lambert ? "
142792	142800	142801	142801	she	1182	" What business has any young woman , "
142805	143090	142801	142801	she	1182	" to indulge in any such nonsense ? Mamma , I ought to be whipped , and sent to bed . I know perfectly well that Mr. Warrington does not care a fig about me . I dare say he likes French actresses and the commonest little milliner - girl in the toy - shop better than me . And so he ought , and so they are better than me . Why , what a fool I am to burst out crying like a ninny about nothing , and because Mr. Wolfe said Harry played cards of a Sunday ! I know he is not clever , like papa . I believe he is stupid I am certain he is stupid : but he is not so stupid as I am . Why , of course , I ca n't marry him . How am I to go to America , and leave you and Theo ? Of course , he likes somebody else , at America , or at Tunbridge , or at Jericho , or somewhere . He is a prince in his own country , and ca n't think of marrying a poor half - pay officer 's daughter , with twopence to her fortune . Used not you to tell me how , when I was a baby , I cried and wanted the moon ? I am a baby now , a most absurd , silly , little baby do n't talk to me , Mrs. Lambert , I am . Only there is this to be said , he do n't know anything about it , and I would rather cut my tongue out than tell him . "
143158	143174	143176	143177	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" I begin to think it had been best for us to stay at home , "
143182	143188	143190	143191	the other	19802	" Nay , my dear , "
143193	143327	143190	143191	the other	19802	" Human nature will be human nature ; surely Hetty 's mother told me herself that she had the beginning of a liking for a certain young curate before she fell over head and ears in love with a certain young officer of Kingsley 's . And as for me , my heart was wounded in a dozen places ere Miss Molly Benson took entire possession of it . Our sons and daughters must follow in the way of their parents before them , I suppose . Why , but yesterday , you were scolding me for grumbling at Miss Het 's precocious fancies . To do the child justice , she disguises her feelings entirely , and I defy Mr. Warrington to know from her behaviour how she is disposed towards him . "
143328	143338	143340	143341	the mother	3050	" A daughter of mine and yours , Martin , "
143347	143360	143340	143341	the mother	3050	" is not going to fling herself at a gentleman 's head ! "
143361	143371	143373	143374	the Colonel	19708	" Neither herself nor the teacup , my dear , "
143376	143438	143373	143374	the Colonel	19708	" Little Miss Het treats Mr. Warrington like a vixen . He never comes to us , but she boxes his ears in one fashion or t'other . I protest she is barely civil to him ; but , knowing what is going on in the young hypocrite 's mind , I am not going to be angry at her rudeness . "
143439	143482	143190	143191	the other	19802	" She hath no need to be rude at all , Martin ; and our girl is good enough for any gentleman in England or America . Why , if their ages suit , should n't they marry after all , sir ? "
143483	143524	143190	143191	the other	19802	" Why , if he wants her , should n't he ask her , my dear ? I am sorry we came . I am for putting the horses into the carriage , and turning their heads towards home again . "
143530	143597	143526	143526	mamma	894	" Depend on it , my dear , that these matters are wisely ordained for us . Depend upon it , Martin , it was not for nothing that Harry Warrington was brought to our gate in that way ; and that he and our children are thus brought together again . If that marriage has been decreed in Heaven , a marriage it will be . "
143598	143668	143696	143697	the mother	3050	" At what age , Molly , I wonder , do women begin and leave off match - making ? If our little chit falls in love and falls out again , she will not be the first of her sex , Mrs. Lambert . I wish we were on our way home again , and , if I had my will , would trot off this very night . "
143669	143694	143696	143697	the mother	3050	" He has promised to drink his tea here to - night . You would not take away our child 's pleasure , Martin ? "
143714	143721	143723	143723	Lambert	1180	" You know , my dear , "
143725	143750	143723	143723	Lambert	1180	" that if either of 'em had a fancy to our ears , we would cut them off and serve them in a fricassee . "
143959	143968	143970	143970	Theo	987	" A dance , and given for us ! "
143972	143989	143970	143970	Theo	987	" Oh , Harry , how delightful ! I wish we could begin this very minute ! "
143990	144013	144015	144016	the Colonel	19708	" Why , for a savage Virginian , I declare , Harry Warrington , thou art the most civilised young man possible ! "
144018	144029	144015	144016	the Colonel	19708	" My dear , shall we dance a minuet together ? "
144030	144042	144044	144048	the soldier 's fond wife	8107	" We have done such a thing before , Martin Lambert ! "
144103	144121	144089	144090	Only Hetty	993	" Why , child , have you not a word of thanks to throw to Mr. Warrington ? "
144128	144137	144139	144139	Hetty	993	" I never did care for dancing much , "
144141	144162	144139	144139	Hetty	993	" What is the use of standing up opposite a stupid man , and dancing down a room with him ? "
144163	144168	144170	144171	Mr. Warrington	701	" Merci du compliment ! "
144173	144194	144196	144196	Hetty	993	" I do n't say that you are stupid that is that is , I I only meant country dances , "
144250	144259	144260	144260	she	993	" I hate dancing there I own it , "
144270	144284	144260	144260	she	993	" Nay , you used to like it well enough , child ! ! "
144289	144312	144314	144314	Hetty	993	" That was when she was a child : do n't you see she is grown up to be an old woman ? "
144318	144328	144314	144314	Hetty	993	" Or perhaps Miss Hester has got the gout ? "
144329	144332	144334	144334	Hester	993	" Fiddle ! "
144344	144353	144355	144356	imperturbed papa	8115	" What 's a dance without a fiddle ? "
144367	144383	144384	144384	he	701	" I come to try my best , and give them pleasure and a dance , "
144387	144422	144384	144384	he	701	" and the little thing tells me she hates dancing . We do n't practise kindness , or acknowledge hospitality so in our country . No nor speak to our parents so , neither . "
144606	144612	144614	144614	she	993	" Suppose he hates me ? "
144616	144749	144614	144614	she	993	" I expect he will . I hate myself , I do , and scorn myself for being such an idiot . How ought he to do otherwise than hate me ? Did n't I abuse him , call him goose , all sorts of names ? And know he is not clever all the time . I know I have better wits than he has . It is only because he is tall , and has blue eyes , and a pretty nose that I like him . What an absurd fool a girl must be to like a man merely because he has a blue nose and hooked eyes ! So I am a fool , and I wo n't have you say a word to the contrary , Theo ! "
144788	144796	144798	144798	Theo	987	" You are silly sometimes , Hetty , "
144800	144871	144798	144798	Theo	987	" that is when you speak unkindly to people who mean you well , as you did to Mr. Warrington at tea to - night . When he proposed to us his party at the Assembly Rooms , and nothing could be more gallant of him , why did you say you did n't care for music , or dancing , or tea ? You know you love them all ! "
144872	145052	145066	145066	mother	2773	" I said it merely to vex myself , Theo , and annoy myself , and whip myself , as I deserve , child . And , besides , how can you expect such an idiot as I am to say anything but idiotic things ? Do you know , it quite pleased me to see him angry . I thought , ah ! now I have hurt his feelings ! Now he will say , Hetty Lambert is an odious little set - up , sour - tempered vixen . And that will teach him , and you , and mamma , and papa , at any rate , that I am not going to set my cap at Mr. Harry . No ; our papa is ten times as good as he is . I will stay by our papa , and if he asked me to go to Virginia with him to - morrow , I would n't , Theo . My sister is worth all the Virginians that ever were made since the world began . "
145087	145098	145066	145066	mother	2773	" Children , ' tis time to go to sleep . "
145149	145157	145158	145158	she	2773	" It is a judgment upon me , "
145161	145323	145158	145158	she	2773	" for having thought and spoke scornfully of him . Only , why should there be a judgment upon me ? I was only in fun . I knew I liked him very much all the time : but I thought Theo liked him too , and I would give up anything for my darling Theo . If she had , no tortures should ever have drawn a word from me I would have got a rope - ladder to help her to run away with Harry , that I would , or fetched the clergyman to marry them . And then I would have retired alone , and alone , and alone , and taken care of papa and mamma , and of the poor in the village , and have read sermons , though I hate 'em , and would have died without telling a word not a word and I shall die soon , I know I shall . "
146344	146349	146351	146356	the Countess of England and Hanover	8196	" Pooh ! pooh ! "
146358	146371	146351	146356	the Countess of England and Hanover	8196	" I do n't mean you . I mean the young Firshinian ! "
146604	146611	146638	146638	her	993	" breddy liddle bardner liked tanzing ? "
146612	146631	146638	146638	her	993	" I thank your ladyship , I do n't like tanzing , and I do n't like cards , "
146648	146651	146652	146652	she	993	" cheese , "
146763	146780	146748	146748	she	993	" What a horrid , vulgar old woman that is ; do n't you think so ? "
146781	146785	146787	146789	the young man	2122	" What woman ? "
146791	146808	146748	146748	she	993	" That German woman my Lady Yarmouth to whom all the men are bowing and cringing . "
146809	146819	146821	146821	Harry	701	" Her ladyship has been very kind to me , "
146825	146835	146821	146821	Harry	701	" Wo n't you have some of this custard ? "
146836	146857	146860	146861	Miss Hetty	993	" And you have been bowing to her , too ! You look as if your negus was not nice , "
146863	146871	146873	146873	Harry	701	" It is not very good negus , "
146879	146896	146898	146899	Miss Lambert	993	" And the custard is bad too ! I declare ' tis made with bad eggs ! "
146901	146920	146922	146923	poor Harry	701	" I wish , Hester , that the entertainment and the company had been better to your liking , "
146925	146941	146943	146945	the young woman	8221	" ' Tis very unfortunate ; but I dare say you could not help it , "
146977	146989	146971	146973	The little torturer	8222	" You seem disturbed : shall we go to my mamma ? "
146990	147000	147002	147003	Mr. Warrington	701	" Yes , let us go to your mamma , "
147010	147023	146971	146973	The little torturer	8222	" Curse you , why are you always standing in the way ? "
147029	147041	147043	147044	Miss Pertness	1199	" La ! Is that the way you speak in Virginia ? "
147046	147062	147063	147063	he	701	" We are rough there sometimes , madam , and ca n't help being disturbed , "
147114	147121	147123	147123	mamma	19850	" You look pale , child ! "
147132	147150	147123	147123	mamma	19850	" ' Tis the cold no , I mean the heat . Thank you , Mr. Warrington . "
147245	147320	147237	147237	they	8234	" turned round with an affected laugh to her neighbour , and shot at the jolly Hanoverian lady a ceaseless fire of giggles and sneers . The Countess pursued her game at cards , not knowing , or not choosing , perhaps , to know how her enemy was gibing at her . There had been a feud of many years ' date between their Graces of Queensberry and the family on the throne . "
147348	147353	147346	147346	Bernstein	723	" the Duchess says . "
147383	147384	147407	147409	my good Bernstein	8242	" "
147397	147398	147399	147399	We	8241	" "

147453	147459	147442	147443	Your Grace	8245	" said Madame de Bernstein , "

147649	147650	147651	147651	I	0	" "
147665	147674	147678	147678	me	0	" says Mr. Warrington , with some spirit . "
147687	147693	147678	147678	me	0	" cries the old Duchess . "
147737	147738	147734	147735	Mr. Warrington	701	" "
147744	147755	147734	147735	Mr. Warrington	701	" says the Baroness Bernstein , with a forced laugh ; "
147762	147763	147759	147760	a dummy	8268	" "
147773	147782	147783	147783	Madam	19815	" asks the old Duchess , looking round . "
147785	147793	147783	147783	Madam	19815	" cries out the other elderly lady , "
147828	147829	147813	147813	I	0	" "
147858	147863	147847	147847	you	19815	" says the Duchess . "
147938	147939	147940	147940	Madam	19815	" "
147960	147969	147970	147970	She	8284	" cries the Duchess , rapping her fan . "
148048	148072	148073	148073	Egad	1203	" And herewith the one dowager made a superb curtsey to the other , and the battle just impending between them passed away . "
148082	148101	148078	148078	Byng	1118	" cried Chaplain Sampson , as Harry talked over the night 's transactions with his tutor next morning . "
148120	148121	148107	148107	I	0	" "
148131	148135	148107	148107	I	0	" laughs Harry . "
148152	148153	148137	148138	the Baroness	2319	" "
148186	148187	148188	148188	Hem	1205	" "
148199	148234	148235	148235	Sir	19663	" Sampson knew very well what they were , and that poor Bernstein 's reputation was so hopelessly flawed and cracked , that any sarcasms levelled at Madame Walmoden were equally applicable to her . "
148237	148245	148235	148235	Sir	19663	" cried Harry , in great amazement , "
148267	148307	148262	148265	the Baroness de Bernstein	723	" The chaplain looked at the young Virginian with such an air of utter wonderment , that the latter saw there must be some history against his aunt , and some charge which Sampson did not choose to reveal . "
148311	148316	148262	148265	the Baroness de Bernstein	723	" Harry groaned out , "
148328	148329	148262	148265	the Baroness de Bernstein	723	" "
148333	148379	148262	148265	the Baroness de Bernstein	723	" asked the chaplain . But here Harry stopped , blushing very red . He remembered , and we shall presently have to state , whence he had got his information regarding the other family culprit , and bit his lip , and was silent . "
148389	148394	148386	148387	Mr. Warrington	701	" said the chaplain ; "
148480	148506	148519	148519	Bernstein	723	" And herewith the chaplain threw his handsome eyes upward , and tried to look as if his conscience was as white as the ceiling . "
148521	148538	148519	148519	Bernstein	723	" continued Harry , remembering how at home his mother had never spoken of the Baroness . "
148543	148550	148519	148519	Bernstein	723	" the chaplain muttered to himself . "
148591	148592	148587	148587	your	22717	" "
148613	148619	148602	148603	any scoundrel	8315	" cries the young gentleman . "
148634	148635	148602	148603	any scoundrel	8315	" "
148650	148661	148637	148637	you	22717	" cries the clergyman , with his most beatified air . "
148699	148700	148701	148701	You	22717	" "
148721	148739	148715	148715	George	918	" cries Mr. Warrington , and again goes down the fist with a thump on the table . "
148819	148881	148882	148883	The ladies	2600	" and here Harry rose , greeting his friend the Colonel very kindly , who had come to pay him a morning visit , and had entered the room followed by Mr. Gumbo the latter preferred walking very leisurely about all the affairs of life , just as Harry suiting the action to the word was tweaking the nose of Calumny . "
148900	148907	148897	148898	Mr. Warrington	701	" says the Colonel , laughing . "
148942	148943	148916	148917	The parson	2199	" "
148952	148957	148958	148958	I	0	" cries Mr. Lambert . "
148967	148998	148999	148999	He	701	" says the chaplain , with a clerical intonation ; but , at the same time , he looks at Colonel Lambert and winks , as much as to say , "
149008	149015	148999	148999	He	701	" The Colonel took the hint . "
149018	149022	148999	148999	He	701	" says he , "
149051	149052	149048	149049	Harry Warrington	701	" "
149059	149060	149057	149057	sir	19663	" "
149122	149138	149162	149164	mea minima culpa	8348	" And here there was a look of mingled humour and reproof at the clergyman . "
149147	149152	149155	149155	mea	8347	" says the chaplain . "
149183	149184	149162	149164	mea minima culpa	8348	" "
149194	149198	149199	149200	Miss Hester	993	" says Harry . "
149209	149214	149215	149215	She	993	" asks the Colonel . "
149224	149229	149215	149215	She	993	" says downright Harry . "
149319	149342	149309	149309	you	19663	" says Harry , shaking his friend 's hand , a ready boyish emotion glowing in his cheeks and in his eyes . "
149362	149391	149359	149360	Mr. Warrington	701	" said the girl 's father , gravely , looking not without a deep thrill of interest at the flushed face and moist eyes of his young friend . "
149398	149403	149393	149393	he	701	" thought the Colonel . "
149439	149505	149437	149437	him	701	" And Colonel Lambert looked towards Harry with that manly , friendly kindness which our lucky young Virginian was not unaccustomed to inspire , for he was comely to look at , prone to blush , to kindle , nay , to melt , at a kind story . His laughter was cheery to hear : his eyes shone confidently : his voice spoke truth . "
149525	149531	149514	149514	She	8361	" asked the courtly chaplain . "
149536	149537	149534	149535	Miss Miss	8363	" "
149555	149560	149552	149552	your	1207	" says her father . "
149573	149582	149583	149583	You	1207	" The Colonel then turned to Harry again . "
149634	149635	149629	149632	a sharming young mans	8371	" "
149652	149657	149643	149643	people	2090	" says the chaplain . "
149669	149681	149667	149667	parson	21074	" says the Colonel , with a twinkle of his eye . "
149692	149701	149682	149683	Her Majesty	4819	" cries Mr. Warrington , with a laugh . "
149727	149734	149721	149721	she	2315	" said the Colonel , drily . "
149778	149798	149801	149801	sir	19663	" Ah ! who will lend me the five thousand ? Will you , sir ? asked the chaplain . "
149823	149830	149803	149803	I	0	" says the Colonel , stoutly . "
149937	149938	149927	149927	you	19663	" "
149952	149958	149945	149945	I	0	" cries Harry , eagerly . "
149964	149974	149945	149945	I	0	" says the Colonel , in a hurried manner . "
149991	149992	149993	149994	The Lord	20327	" "
150001	150005	149993	149994	The Lord	20327	" he mutters . "
150094	150209	150210	150211	The boy	2227	" And the Colonel was for taking leave of Harry then and there , on the spot , but the young man followed him down the stairs , and insisted upon saying good - bye to his dear ladies . Instead , however , of proceeding immediately to Mr. Lambert 's lodging , the two gentlemen took the direction of the common , where , looking from Harry 's windows , Mr. Sampson saw the pair in earnest conversation . First , Lambert smiled and looked roguish . Then , presently , at a farther stage of the talk , he flung up both his hands and performed other gestures indicating surprise and agitation . "
150216	150274	150210	150211	The boy	2227	" thought the chaplain . When Mr. Warrington came back in an hour , he found his reverence deep in the composition of a sermon . Harry 's face was grave and melancholy ; he flung down his hat , buried himself in a great chair , and then came from his lips something like an execration . "
150287	150298	150275	150277	The young ladies	2318	" said the chaplain , looking up from his manuscript . "
150301	150305	150275	150277	The young ladies	2318	" sneered Harry . "
150330	150331	150319	150320	the youngest	20097	" "
150337	150342	150345	150345	she	8408	" broke out Harry . "
150364	150365	150354	150354	She	8408	" "
150377	150385	150388	150388	they	8413	" said the scribe of the sermon . "
150392	150405	150390	150390	Chaplain	910	" And Harry growled out more naughty words expressive of inward disquiet . "
150419	150433	150411	150411	you	19663	" asked the chaplain , presently looking up from his pages . Harry said "
150436	150450	150411	150411	you	19663	" with another word , which I would not print for the world . "
150479	150480	150474	150474	I	0	" "
150487	150494	150474	150474	I	0	" said Harry , very gloomily , "
150522	150523	150514	150514	I	0	" "
150533	150538	150526	150526	you	19663	" cried the chaplain . "
150576	150577	150569	150569	you	19663	" "
150583	150592	150580	150580	I	0	" says Mr. Warrington , plunged in melancholy . "
150626	150627	150631	150631	him	8420	" "
150640	150649	150650	150650	I	0	" groaned out Mr. Warrington , bitterly . , "
150658	150659	150650	150650	I	0	" "
150680	150681	150668	150669	an enemy	8423	" "
150720	150725	150710	150711	A fellow	19756	" The chaplain laughed . "
150730	150734	150710	150711	A fellow	19756	" he said , "
150739	150780	150726	150726	You	19663	" And the truth was , that , for the last few days , no amount of wine would unseal Mr. Warrington 's lips , when the artless Sampson by chance touched on the subject of his patron 's loss . "
150795	150800	150783	150786	the little country nymphs	8427	" asked the chaplain . "
150847	150861	150842	150842	you	19663	" Mr. Warrington looked , for a moment , askance at the clergyman . "
150869	150887	150866	150866	I	0	" muttered the young misogynist . For which sentiment every well - conditioned person will surely rebuke him .
151356	151360	151347	151347	she	1211	" Down Charge ; "
151380	151387	151347	151347	she	1211	" licks the hand that 's raised "
151427	151431	151432	151432	he	1212	" Hereditary bondsmen , "
151437	151453	151432	151432	he	1212	" know ye not , who would be free , themselves must strike the blow ? "
151527	151530	151564	151567	my eminent young Grubstreet	8462	" clubs , "
151534	151559	151523	151523	he	1213	" I told you so ! He advocates the thrashing of women ! He has no nobility of soul ! He has no heart ! "
151687	151716	151717	151717	She	8034	" Good - bye , Harry ! I was very wilful and fractious last night , and you were very kind : but good - bye , Harry ! "
152276	152286	152288	152289	Madame Bernstein	723	" Elle ravvole de fous , cher bedid anche ! "
152308	152326	152327	152327	she	2319	" You carry off the hearts of all the old women , does n't he , Maria ? "
152343	152369	152371	152373	Madame de Bernstein	723	" You were quite right , my dear , not to perceive that she cheated at cards , and you play like a grand seigneur , "
152375	152380	152382	152382	Harry	701	" Did she cheat ? "
152386	152399	152382	152382	Harry	701	" I am sure , ma'am , I saw no unfair play . "
152400	152513	152371	152373	Madame de Bernstein	723	" No more did I , my dear , but I am sure she cheated . Bah ! every woman cheats , I and Maria included , when we can get a chance . But when you play with the Walmoden , you do n't do wrong to lose in moderation ; and many men cheat in that way . Cultivate her . She has taken a fancy to your beaux yeux . Why should your Excellency not be Governor of Virginia , sir ? You must go and pay your respects to the Duke and his Majesty at Kensington . The Countess of Yarmouth will be your best friend at court . "
152514	152524	152526	152526	Harry	701	" Why should you not introduce me , aunt ? "
152539	152548	152549	152549	she	2505	" I am not in favour at Kensington , "
152552	152609	152549	152549	she	2505	" I may have been once ; and there are no faces so unwelcome to kings as those they wish to forget . All of us want to forget something or somebody . I dare say our ingenu here would like to wipe a sum or two off the slate . Wouldst thou not , Harry ? "
153535	153549	153551	153552	Lady Maria	690	" A gentleman of Mr. Warrington 's means can afford to be idle , "
153554	153570	153551	153552	Lady Maria	690	" Why , sure you love cards and billiards yourself , my good Mr. Sampson ? "
153571	153590	153592	153593	Mr. Chaplain	910	" I do n't say , madam , my practice is good , only my doctrine is sound , "
153598	153646	153592	153593	Mr. Chaplain	910	" This young gentleman should have some employment . He should appear at court , and enter the service of his country , as befits a man of his station . He should settle down , and choose a woman of a suitable rank as his wife . "
153658	153668	153670	153671	Lady Maria	690	" Indeed , my cousin is wasting his time , "
153676	153689	153691	153692	Mr. Chaplain	910	" Mr. Warrington might see his relatives of his father 's family , "
153694	153721	153691	153692	Mr. Chaplain	910	" Suffolk country boobies drinking beer and hallooing after foxes ! I do n't see anything to be gained by his frequenting them , Mr. Sampson ! "
153722	153744	153746	153747	the chaplain	4987	" They are of an ancient family , of which the chief has been knight of the shire these hundred years , "
153749	153768	153746	153747	the chaplain	4987	" I have heard Sir Miles hath a daughter of Mr. Harry 's age and beauty , too . "
153769	153789	153791	153791	Maria	690	" I know nothing , sir , about Sir Miles Warrington , and his daughters , and his beauties ! "
153797	153810	153812	153813	the chaplain	4987	" The Baroness stirred no her ladyship is in a sweet sleep , "
153821	153924	153926	153927	Mr. Sampson	910	" I fear , madam , for your ladyship 's cousin , Mr. Warrington . I fear for his youth ; for designing persons who may get about him ; for extravagances , follies , intrigues even into which he will be led , and into which everybody will try to tempt him . His lordship , my kind patron , bade me to come and watch over him , and I am here accordingly , as your ladyship knoweth . I know the follies of young men . Perhaps I have practised them myself . I own it with a blush , "
153946	153962	153964	153965	the chaplain	4987	" Between ourselves , I fear Mr. Warrington is in some trouble now , madam , "
153973	153978	153980	153981	the lady	2586	" What , again ? "
153983	153992	153994	153995	the chaplain	4987	" Hush ! Your ladyship 's dear invalid ! "
154002	154027	153994	153995	the chaplain	4987	" Do you think your cousin has any partiality for any any member of Mr. Lambert 's family ? for example , Miss Lambert ? "
154028	154038	154040	154041	Lady Maria	690	" There is nothing between him and Miss Lambert , "
154043	154049	154040	154041	Lady Maria	690	" Your ladyship is certain ? "
154050	154066	154068	154069	my lady	19701	" Women are said to have good eyes in such matters , my good Sampson , "
154076	154088	154068	154069	my lady	19701	" I thought the little girl seemed to be following him . "
154089	154098	154099	154101	the frank chaplain	8549	" Then I am at fault once more , "
154104	154135	154099	154101	the frank chaplain	8549	" Mr. Warrington said of the young lady , that she ought to go back to her doll , and called her a pert , stuck - up little hussy . "
154136	154139	154141	154142	Lady Maria	690	" Ah ! "
154151	154162	154164	154165	the chaplain	4987	" Then , madam , there must be somebody else , "
154167	154176	154164	154165	the chaplain	4987	" Has he confided nothing to your ladyship ? "
154177	154190	154192	154192	Maria	690	" To me , Mr. Sampson ? What ? Where ? How ? "
154194	154225	154192	154192	Maria	690	" Some six days ago , after we had been dining at the White Horse , and drinking too freely , Mr. Warrington lost a pocket - book containing letters . "
154226	154229	154231	154232	Lady Maria	690	" Letters ? "
154234	154245	154247	154248	Mr. Sampson	910	" And probably more money than he likes to own , "
154258	154287	154247	154248	Mr. Sampson	910	" He is very much disturbed about the book . We have both made cautious inquiries about it . We have Gracious powers , is your ladyship ill ? "
154304	154332	154291	154291	Maria	690	" I will see the Prince . I have a right to see him . What 's this ? Where am I ? What 's the matter ? "
154385	154392	154393	154393	she	2505	" What what 's the matter ? "
154397	154405	154393	154393	she	2505	" Have you killed her , sir ? "
154406	154431	154433	154434	the chaplain	4987	" Some sudden qualm must have come over her ladyship . Shall I cut her laces , madam ? or send for a doctor ? "
154444	154453	154455	154457	the old lady	2505	" What has passed between you , sir ? "
154461	154503	154504	154505	Madame Bernstein	723	" I give you my honour , madam , I have done I do n't know what . I but mentioned that Mr. Warrington had lost a pocket - book containing letters , and my lady swooned , as you see . "
154570	154575	154577	154579	the younger lady	8560	" What has happened ? "
154585	154608	154610	154612	the old Baroness	7696	" H'm ! You know best what has happened , madam , I suppose . What hath happened before in our family ? "
154622	154636	154610	154612	the old Baroness	7696	" Ah , yes ! the letters have been lost ach lieber Himmel ! "
154660	154685	154687	154688	the elder	2775	" Yes ! the seal has been broken , and the letters have been lost , ' tis the old story of the Esmonds , "
154692	154706	154708	154708	Maria	690	" Seal broken , letters lost ? What do you mean , aunt ? "
154712	154729	154731	154732	the Baroness	2319	" I mean that my mother was the only honest woman that ever entered the family ! "
154738	154775	154731	154732	the Baroness	2319	" And she was a parson 's daughter of no family in particular , or she would have gone wrong , too . Good heavens ! is it decreed that we are all to be ... ? "
154776	154783	154785	154785	Maria	690	" To be what , madam ? "
154787	154813	154815	154818	the indignant old woman	8566	" To be what my Lady Queensberry said we were last night . To be what we are ! You know the word for it ! "
154820	154856	154815	154818	the indignant old woman	8566	" I say , what has come to the whole race ? Your father 's mother was an honest woman , Maria . Why did I leave her ? Why could n't you remain so ? "
154857	154860	154862	154862	Maria	690	" Madam ! "
154864	154874	154862	154862	Maria	690	" I declare , before Heaven , I am as "
154875	154924	154815	154818	the indignant old woman	8566	" Bah ! Do n't madam me ! Do n't call heaven to witness there 's nobody by ! And if you swore to your innocence till the rest of your teeth dropped out of your mouth , my Lady Maria Esmond , I would not believe you ! "
154925	154934	154936	154936	Maria	690	" Ah ! it was you told him ! "
154949	155038	154938	154938	She	690	" I saw some folly going on between you and the boy , and I told him that you were as old as his mother . Yes , I did ! Do you suppose I am going to let Henry Esmond 's boy fling himself and his wealth away upon such a battered old rock as you ? The boy sha n't be robbed and cheated in our family . Not a shilling of mine shall any of you have if he comes to any harm amongst you . "
155045	155056	155041	155041	you	8568	" cried Maria , with a sudden burst of rebellion . "
155105	155106	155095	155095	I	0	" "
155115	155121	155095	155095	I	0	" Maria shrugged her shoulders . "
155134	155135	155095	155095	I	0	" "
155144	155162	155142	155142	madam	19815	" cries Maria again . The younger woman , ordinarily submissive , had turned upon here persecutor . "
155174	155185	155170	155172	an honest man	21807	" said the of lady , shaking her head sadly . "
155226	155227	155215	155215	You	8568	" "
155243	155247	155233	155233	you	8577	" asks Maria . "
155274	155275	155267	155267	I	0	" "
155302	155303	155287	155287	you	8577	" "
155306	155307	155287	155287	you	8577	" "
155365	155376	155360	155360	I	0	" cries Lady Maria with a wave of her hand . "
155458	155459	155460	155460	I	0	" "
155476	155482	155474	155474	Maria	690	" pleaded the old lady . "
155499	155503	155506	155506	his	701	" cries Maria . "
155519	155520	155511	155511	madam	19815	" "
155549	155550	155537	155537	I	0	" "
155566	155567	155537	155537	I	0	" "
155583	155587	155574	155575	Madam Tusher	1227	" cries Maria . "
155600	155606	155598	155598	Maria	690	" said the old lady . "
155620	155624	155609	155609	madam	19815	" says Maria . "
155632	155633	155628	155628	he	3154	" "
155656	155697	155654	155654	madam	19815	" and she flung out of the room , just as the chaplain returned . It was Madame Bernstein who wanted cordials now . She was immensely moved and shocked by the news which had been thus suddenly brought to her .
155738	155746	155747	155747	she	19815	" Of course , my Lady Maria , "
155750	155890	155747	155747	she	19815	" you ca n't suppose that I , as Harry Warrington 's near relative , can be pleased at the idea of his marrying a woman who is as old as his mother , and has not a penny to her fortune ; but if he chooses to do so silly a thing , the affair is none of mine ; and I doubt whether I should have been much inclined to be taken au serieux with regard to that offer of five thousand pounds which I made in the heat of our talk . So it was already at Castlewood that this pretty affair was arranged ? Had I known how far it had gone , my dear , I should have spared some needless opposition . When a pitcher is broken , what railing can mend it ? "
155891	155894	155897	155897	Maria	690	" Madam ! "
155899	155936	155897	155897	Maria	690	" Pardon me I mean nothing against your ladyship 's honour or character , which , no doubt , are quite safe . Harry says so , and you say so what more can one ask ? "
155937	155947	155897	155897	Maria	690	" You have talked to Mr. Warrington , madam ? "
155948	155970	155897	155897	Maria	690	" And he has owned that he made you a promise at Castlewood : that you have it in his writing . "
155971	155978	155980	155981	Lady Maria	690	" Certainly I have , madam ! "
155983	155986	155980	155981	Lady Maria	690	" Ah ! "
155996	156027	155987	155989	the elder lady	21655	" And I own , too , that at first I put a wrong construction upon the tenor of your letters to him . They implicate other members of the family "
156028	156069	155897	155897	Maria	690	" Who have spoken most wickedly of me , and endeavoured to prejudice me in every way in my dear Mr. Warrington 's eyes . Yes , madam , I own I have written against them , to justify myself . "
156070	156107	155897	155897	Maria	690	" But , of course , are pained to think that any wretch should get possession of stories to the disadvantage of our family , and make them public scandal . Hence your disquiet just now . "
156108	156112	156114	156115	Lady Maria	690	" Exactly so , "
156117	156155	156114	156115	Lady Maria	690	" From Mr. Warrington I could have nothing concealed henceforth , and spoke freely to him . But that is a very different thing from wishing all the world to know the disputes of a noble family . "
156156	156182	155897	155897	Maria	690	" Upon my word , Maria , I admire you , and have done you injustice . These these twenty years , let us say . "
156183	156201	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" I am very glad , madam , that you end by doing me justice at all , "
156206	156232	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" When I saw you last night , opening the ball with my nephew , can you guess what I thought of , my dear ? "
156233	156247	156249	156250	Lady Maria	690	" I really have no idea what the Baroness de Bernstein thought of , "
156254	156276	156249	156250	Lady Maria	690	" I remembered that you had performed to that very tune with the dancing - master at Kensington , my dear ! "
156277	156286	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" Madam , it was an infamous calumny . "
156287	156301	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" By which the poor dancing - master got a cudgelling for nothing ! "
156302	156331	156333	156333	Maria	690	" It is cruel and unkind , madam , to recall that calumny and I shall beg to decline living any longer with any one who utters it , "
156339	156368	156333	156333	Maria	690	" You wish to go home ? I can fancy you wo n't like Tunbridge . It will be very hot for you if those letters are found . "
156369	156391	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" There was not a word against you in them , madam : about that I can make your mind easy . "
156392	156424	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" So Harry said , and did your ladyship justice . Well , my dear , we are tired of one another , and shall be better apart for a while . "
156425	156433	156435	156436	Lady Maria	690	" That is precisely my own opinion , "
156442	156460	156203	156204	the niece	8604	" Mr. Sampson can escort you to Castlewood . You and your maid can take a postchaise . "
156461	156475	156477	156479	the younger lady	8560	" We can take a postchaise , and Mr. Sampson can escort me , "
156481	156494	156477	156479	the younger lady	8560	" You see , madam , I act like a dutiful niece . "
156495	156514	156516	156517	the Baroness	2319	" Do you know , my dear , I have a notion that Sampson has got the letters ? "
156521	156535	156516	156517	the Baroness	2319	" I confess that such a notion has passed through my own mind . "
156536	156667	156668	156669	Lady Maria	690	" And you want to go home in the chaise , and coax the letters from him ! Delilah ! Well , they can be no good to me , and I trust you may get them . When will you go ? The sooner the better , you say ? We are women of the world , Maria . We only call names when we are in a passion . We do n't want each other 's company ; and we part on good terms . Shall we go to my Lady Yarmouth 's ? ' Tis her night . There is nothing like a change of scene after one of those little nervous attacks you have had , and cards drive away unpleasant thoughts better than any doctor . "
156711	156719	156721	156723	the old lady	2505	" She has the letters upon her , "
156903	156912	156914	156915	Madame Bernstein	723	" She has the letters in her stays , "
157319	157344	157346	157347	Mr. Warrington	701	" Why , Case , I could have made oath it was you I saw on horseback this morning galloping on the London road , "
157356	157429	157346	157347	Mr. Warrington	701	" Me ! law bless you , sir ! I was a - bed , and I thought my head would come off with the aching . I ate a bit at six o'clock , and drunk a deal of small beer , and I am almost my own man again now . But that Gumbo , saving your honour 's presence , I wo n't taste none of his punch again . "
157529	157624	157625	157625	Maria	690	" I do not care to tell you , my dear , that it is on business which will do him good . I wish Mr. Draper to put him into my will , and as I am going travelling upon a round of visits when you and I part , I think , for security , I shall ask Mr. Warrington to take my trinket - box in his postchaise to London with him , for there have been robberies of late , and I have no fancy for being stopped by highwaymen . "
157658	157661	157663	157664	his aunt	2597	" Nay , "
157666	157705	157663	157664	his aunt	2597	" the lad hath been tied to our apron - strings long enough . A day in London will do him no harm . He can perform my errand for me and be back with you by Saturday . "
157706	157724	157726	157727	Mr. Sampson	910	" I would offer to accompany Mr. Warrington , but I preach on Friday before her ladyship , "
157860	157871	157873	157873	Harry	701	" Ah ! I have often talked over that journey , "
157879	157886	157888	157889	Lady Maria	690	" And with whom , sir ? "
157891	157902	157904	157906	the young man	2122	" With one who promised to make it with me , "
157924	157939	157941	157941	Harry	701	" He has more heart , my good Maria , than some of us ! "
158008	158014	158016	158017	the chaplain	4987	" I doubt , madam , "
158033	158052	158016	158017	the chaplain	4987	" whether some folks in England would suffer quite so much at the death of their elder brother . "
158288	158298	158306	158306	Gumbo	689	" Look , Gumbo ! There is the Tower ! "
158299	158304	158306	158306	Gumbo	689	" Yes , master , "
158418	158429	158369	158369	They	8694	" Look , Gumbo , that is Saint Paul 's ! "
158430	158439	158441	158441	Gumbo	689	" Yes , master ; Saint Paul 's , "
158585	158601	158602	158603	the lawyer	8710	" I shall have to keep you for two or three days , Mr. Warrington , "
158606	158683	158602	158603	the lawyer	8710	" I do n't think the papers which the Baroness wants can be ready until then . Meanwhile , I am at your service to see the town . I live out of it myself , and have a little box at Camberwell , where I shall be proud to have the honour of entertaining Mr. Warrington ; but a young man , I suppose , will like his inn and his liberty best , sir ? "
158858	158885	158849	158849	his	8729	" If you please , sir , them papers of the Baroness was given to her ladyship 's man , Mr. Case , two days ago . "
158886	158898	158900	158901	the lawyer	8710	" Just please to mind your own business , Mr. Brown , "
158906	158928	158900	158901	the lawyer	8710	" This way , Mr. Warrington . Our Temple stairs are rather dark . Allow me to show you the way . "
158943	158958	158959	158959	he	701	" So it was Case I saw on the London Road two days ago , "
158962	158972	158959	158959	he	701	" What business brought the old fox to London ? "
159064	159069	159071	159072	Mr. Warrington	701	" And order dinner , "
159157	159186	159187	159188	Mr. Warrington	701	" They were gentlemen who died for their king , sir . My dear brother George and I always said we would salute 'em when we saw 'em , "
159191	159206	159208	159210	the alarmed lawyer	8742	" You 'll have a mob at your heels if you do , sir , "
159212	159219	159221	159222	Mr. Harry	701	" Confound the mob , sir , "
159413	159417	159412	159417	a " high fellar . "	23435	" high fellar . "
159511	159524	159526	159527	Mr. Draper	726	" Take the advice of a man of the world , sir , "
159538	159575	159526	159527	Mr. Draper	726	" the less you have to do with that kind of person , the better . The business we have into our office about them literary men is not very pleasant , I can tell you . "
159576	159579	159581	159582	Mr. Warrington	701	" Indeed ! "
159623	159627	159629	159630	Mr. Draper	726	" Not Ranelagh , "
159632	159643	159629	159630	Mr. Draper	726	" because there 's none of the nobility in town ; "
159837	159930	159831	159832	his mother	2340	" A great number of the principal gentry of the colony have associated themselves under the command of the Honourable Peyton Randolph , Esquire , to march to the relief of their distressed fellow - subjects , and revenge the cruelties of the French and their barbarous allies . They are in a uniform : viz . , a plain blue frock , nanquin or brown waistcoats and breeches , and plain hats . They are armed each with a light firelock , a brace of pistols , and a cutting sword . "
159931	159942	159945	159945	Harry	701	" Ah , why ai n't we there , Gumbo ? "
159947	159954	159956	159956	Gumbo	689	" Why ai n't we dar ? "
159958	159970	159972	159973	the Virginian	19826	" Why am I here , dangling at women 's trains ? "
159975	159988	159990	159992	the materialistic Gumbo	8780	" Think dangling at women 's trains very pleasant , Master Harry ! "
161022	161029	161031	161032	the people	4570	" The masters , the masters ! "
161157	161160	161177	161179	a contemporary poet	8861	" armiger , "
161182	161189	161177	161179	a contemporary poet	8861	" The word it was bilboe . "
161681	161685	161687	161687	he	701	" I wish ... "
161690	161697	161699	161699	he	701	" No , I do n't , "
161701	161713	161699	161699	he	701	" What do you wish and what do n't you wish ? "
161718	161790	161699	161699	he	701	" I was thinking , my lord , of my elder brother , and wished he had been with me . We had promised to have our sport together at home , you see ; and many 's the time we talked of it . But he would n't have liked this rough sort of sport , and did n't care for fighting , though he was the bravest lad alive . "
161791	161804	161806	161807	my lord	2193	" Oh ! he was the bravest lad alive , was he ? "
161823	161904	161699	161699	he	701	" You should have seen him in a quarrel with a very gallant officer , our friend an absurd affair , but it was hard to keep George off him . I never saw a fellow so cool , nor more savage and determined , God help me . Ah ! I wish for the honour of the country , you know , that he could have come here instead of me , and shown you a real Virginian gentleman . "
161905	161929	161931	161933	the amused nobleman	8894	" Nay , sir , you 'll do very well . What is this I hear of Lady Yarmouth taking you into favour ? "
161935	161973	161975	161975	Harry	701	" I will do as well as another . I can ride , and , I think , I can shoot better than George ; but then my brother had the head , sir , the head ! "
161983	162044	161975	161975	Harry	701	" Why , I give you my word , my lord , that he had read almost every book that was ever written ; could play both on the fiddle and harpsichord , could compose poetry and sermons most elegant . What can I do ? I am only good to ride and play at cards , and drink Burgundy . "
162053	162079	162080	162080	he	8895	" But them I can do as well as most fellows , you see . In fact , my lord , I 'll back myself , "
162117	162124	162126	162126	he	8895	" By Gad , Mr. Warrington , "
162128	162145	162126	162126	he	8895	" you ought to be taken to Exeter ' Change , and put in a show . "
162146	162151	162201	162202	the Virginian	19826	" And for why ? "
162152	162195	162126	162126	he	8895	" A gentleman from Virginia who has lost his elder brother and absolutely regrets him . The breed ai n't known in this country . Upon my honour and conscience , I believe that you would like to have him back again . "
162196	162199	162201	162202	the Virginian	19826	" Believe ! "
162210	162445	162201	162202	the Virginian	19826	" That is , you believe you believe you would like him back again . But depend on it you would n't . ' Tis not in human nature , sir ; not as I read it , at least . Here are some fine houses we are coming to . That at the corner is Sir Richard Littleton 's , that great one was my Lord Bingley 's . ' Tis a pity they do nothing better with this great empty space of Cavendish Square than fence it with these unsightly boards . By George ! I do n't know where the town 's running . There 's Montagu House made into a confounded Don Saltero 's museum , with books and stuffed birds and rhinoceroses . They have actually run a cursed cut New Road they call it at the back of Bedford House Gardens , and spoilt the Duke 's comfort , though , I guess , they will console him in the pocket . I do n't know where the town will stop . Shall we go down Tyburn Road and the Park , or through Swallow Street , and into the habitable quarter of the town ? We can dine at Pall Mall , or , if you like , with you ; and we can spend the evening as you like with the Queen of Spades , or ... "
162446	162458	162460	162461	Mr. Warrington	701	" With the Queen of Spades , if your lordship pleases , "
163126	163142	163108	163109	a female	8936	" I wish your women would take some other time for coming , confound 'em , "
163155	163161	163163	163163	Harry	701	" What , Mrs. Betty ! "
163192	163197	163199	163200	Mr. Warrington	701	" What has happened ? "
163209	163215	163199	163200	Mr. Warrington	701	" The Baroness is well ? "
163216	163226	163228	163229	Mrs. Betty	691	" Help ! help ! sir , your honour ! "
163239	163243	163236	163236	her	691	" Help whom ? "
163250	163265	163248	163248	Gumbo	689	" Gumbo ! you scoundrel ! has anything happened between Mrs. Betty and you ? "
163290	163306	163281	163281	his	689	" No , sir ; nothing hab happened ' twix ' this lady and me . "
163307	163315	163317	163317	Betty	691	" It 's my mistress , sir , "
163319	163343	163317	163317	Betty	691	" Help ! help ! here 's the letter she have wrote , sir ! They have gone and took her , sir ! "
163344	163388	163395	163395	his	2193	" Is it only that old Molly Esmond ? She 's known to be over head and heels in debt ! Dry your eyes in the next room , Mrs. Betty , and let me and Mr. Warrington go on with our game , "
163398	163404	163406	163406	Betty	691	" Help ! help her ! "
163409	163460	163406	163406	Betty	691	" Oh , Mr. Harry ! you wo n't be a - going on with your cards , when my lady calls out to you to come and help her ! Your honour used to come quick enough when my lady used to send me to fetch you at Castlewood ! "
163461	163472	163474	163475	my lord	2193	" Confound you ! ca n't you hold your tongue ? "
163521	163554	163506	163507	Mr. Warrington	1246	" My dear lord , the game must be over for to - night . My relative writes to me in great distress , and I am bound to go to her . "
163555	163569	163571	163572	my lord	2193	" Curse her ! Why could n't she wait till to - morrow ? "
163592	163655	163657	163658	Lord March	1246	" Bet you , you do n't do it within the hour ! bet you , you do n't do it within five quarters of an hour ! bet you four to one or I 'll take your bet , which you please that you 're not robbed on Blackheath ! Bet you , you are not at Tunbridge Wells before midnight ! "
163660	163663	163665	163666	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Done ! "
163694	163737	163686	163687	Lady Maria	690	" MY DEAR COUSIN I am fell into a trapp , which I perceive the machinations of villians . I am a prisner . Betty will tell you all . Ah , my Henrico ! come to the resque of your MOLLY . "
164087	164092	164065	164065	parricides	8977	" my dearest brother , "

164981	164990	164992	164993	Lady Maria	690	" Take your ease and amusement , cousin , "
164995	165003	165017	165017	her	1257	" Frisk about , pretty little mousekin , "
165448	165460	165436	165436	he	1259	" Ah ! perhaps his lordship may give me a living ! "

166493	166512	166514	166515	Lady Maria	690	" Who are those horrible men at the door ? and what a smell of spirits there is ! "
166533	166554	166556	166558	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Farewell , doctor ; you have a darling little boy : is he to be a clergyman , too ? "
166560	166568	166556	166558	Madame de Bernstein	723	" Are you ready , my dear ? "
166697	166757	166688	166688	his	2353	" At the shuit of Misthress Pincott , of Kinsington , mercer , I have the honour of arresting your leedyship . Me neem is Costigan , madam , a poor gentleman of Oireland , binding to circumstances and forced to follow a disagrayable profession . Will your leedyship walk , or shall me man go fetch a cheer ? "
166774	166781	166783	166784	Mr. Costigan	1266	" Keep the door , Mick ! "
166786	166796	166797	166797	he	1266	" Best let in no one else , madam , "
166808	166827	166797	166797	he	1266	" Her ladyship has fallen in a feenting fit , and will recover here , at her aise . "
166828	166834	166836	166843	the old lady , whose eyes twinkle oddly	9142	" Unlace her , Brett ! "
166881	166895	166897	166898	the Baroness	2319	" Dash some cold water over her face , it always recovers her ! "
166900	166915	166897	166898	the Baroness	2319	" You stay with her , Brett . How much is your suit gentlemen ? "

168598	168604	168594	168596	the old lady	2505	" I 'll tell her , "

168679	168700	168674	168674	Bernstein	723	" It is not Betty it is I ! Good morning , dear aunt ! I hope you slept well ? "

168802	168948	168786	168787	Mr. Warrington	1246	" This is to inform you with satisfaction that I have one all our three betts . I was at Bromley two minutes within the hour ; my new horses kep a - going at a capital rate . I drove them myself , having the postilion by me to show me the way , and my black man inside with Mrs. Betty . Hope they found the drive very pleasant . We were not stopped on Blackheath , though two fellows on horseback rode up to us , but not liking the looks of our countenantses , rode off again ; and we got into Tunbridge Wells where I transacted my business at forty - five minutes after eleven . This makes me quitts with your lordship after yesterday 's piquet , which I shall be very happy to give your revenge , and am "

169362	169395	169334	169335	Madame Bernstein	723	" Get my lady 's hat and cardinal , Betty , and , Chaplain , we 'll smoke a pipe together at our lodgings , it will refresh me after my ride . "
169561	169573	169576	169576	they	9263	" Here comes the conqueror ! Make way for the champion ! "
169994	170002	170004	170005	Mr. Harry	701	" The younger branch of our family , "
170012	170033	170004	170005	Mr. Harry	701	" have treated you scurvily ; but , by Jove , Sampson my boy , I 'll stand by you ! "
170054	170114	170041	170042	Mr. Warrington	701	" I am very glad I was enabled to help you in your strait . Count on me whenever you want me , Sampson . Did you not say you had a sister at boarding - school ? You will want money for her , sir . Here is a little bill which may help to pay her schooling . "
170144	170148	170149	170149	he	2270	" Mr. Warrington , "
170163	170178	170149	170149	he	2270	" I I do n't deserve your kindness by George , I do n't ! "
170190	170193	170195	170195	Harry	701	" Psha ! "
170197	170221	170195	170195	Harry	701	" I have plenty more of 'em . There was no money in that confounded pocket - book which I lost last week . "
170222	170232	170234	170235	Mr. Sampson	888	" No , sir . There was no money ! "
170241	170252	170254	170256	the young gentleman	2119	" Hallo ! How do you know , Mr. Chaplain ? "
170258	170302	170254	170256	the young gentleman	2119	" I know because I am a villain , sir . I am not worthy of your kindness . I told you so . I found the book , sir , that night , when you had too much wine at Barbeau 's . "
170303	170309	170311	170312	Mr. Warrington	701	" And read the letters ? "
170321	170333	170335	170336	the chaplain	4987	" They told me nothing I did not know , sir , "
170337	170365	170254	170256	the young gentleman	2119	" You have had spies about you whom you little suspect from whom you are much too young and simple to be able to keep your secret . "
170366	170385	170387	170387	Harry	701	" Are those stories about Lady Fanny , and my cousin Will and his doings , true then ? "
170389	170396	170398	170399	the chaplain	4987	" Yes , they are true , "
170401	170426	170398	170399	the chaplain	4987	" The house of Castlewood has not been fortunate , sir , since your honour 's branch , the elder branch , left it . "
170427	170444	170445	170445	Harry	701	" Sir , you do n't dare for to breathe a word against my Lady Maria ? "
170449	170456	170458	170459	Mr. Sampson	888	" Oh , not for worlds ! "
170470	170517	170458	170459	Mr. Sampson	888	" I may think she is too old for your honour , and that ' tis a pity you should not have a wife better suited to your age , though I admit she looks very young for hers , and hath every virtue and accomplishment . "
170518	170531	170533	170534	Mr. Warrington	701	" She is too old , Sampson , I know she is , "
170540	170585	170533	170534	Mr. Warrington	701	" but she has my word , and you see , sir , how fond she is of me . Go bring me the letters , sir , which you found , and let me try and forgive you for having seized upon them . "
170586	170597	170599	170600	Mr. Sampson	888	" My benefactor , let me try and forgive myself ! "
170625	170632	170634	170634	Harry	701	" What has happened , sir ? "
170650	170659	170660	170660	he	4987	" With your name in it , sir , "
170663	170671	170673	170673	Harry	701	" My brother 's name in it , "
170675	170685	170673	170673	Harry	701	" it was George who gave it to me . "
170686	170755	170756	170756	Sampson	888	" I kept it in a locked chest , sir , in which I left it this morning before I was taken by those people . Here is the book , sir , but the letters are gone . My trunk and valise have also been tampered with . And I am a miserable , guilty man , unable to make you the restitution which I owe you . "
171132	171184	171127	171127	Harry	701	" I think , Sampson , you would ; I hope you would . My family the Esmond family has always been accustomed to have faithful friends round about 'em and to reward 'em too . The wine 's with you , Chaplain . What toast do you call , sir ? "
171185	171198	171200	171201	the chaplain	4987	" I call a blessing on the house of Esmond - Warrington ! "
171210	171227	171229	171230	Mr. Harry	701	" We are the elder branch , sir . My grandfather was the Marquis of Esmond , "
171240	171314	171229	171230	Mr. Harry	701	" Here 's to you , Chaplain and I forgive you , sir and God bless you , sir and if you had been took for three times as much , I 'd have paid it . Why , what 's that I see through the shutters ? I am blest if the sun has n't risen again ! We have no need of candles to go to bed , ha , ha ! "
171426	171431	171422	171423	Aunt Bernstein	1086	" my dearest child , "
171483	171486	171488	171489	the Baroness	2319	" Why , "
171491	171517	171488	171489	the Baroness	2319	" I had to send Case to London to my agent to get me money to pay I could not leave Tunbridge in her debt . "
171518	171526	171528	171529	Mr. Harry	701	" So Case did go to London ? "
171531	171559	171528	171529	Mr. Harry	701	" Of course he did : the Baroness de Bernstein ca n't afford to say she is court d'argent . Canst thou lend me some , child ? "
171560	171571	171573	171573	Harry	701	" I can give your ladyship twenty - two pounds , "
171579	171608	171573	171573	Harry	701	" I have but forty - four left till I get my Virginian remittances . I have bought horses and clothes , and been very extravagant , aunt . "
171609	171678	171680	171680	she	9330	" And rescued your poor relations in distress , you prodigal good boy . No , child , I do not want thy money . I can give thee some . Here is a note upon my agent for fifty pounds , vaurien ! Go and spend it , and be merry ! I dare say thy mother will repay me , though she does not love me . "
171697	171729	171680	171680	she	9330	" Your mother did not love me , but your mother 's father did once . Mind , sir , you always come to me when you have need of me . "
171748	171758	171759	171759	she	9330	" I ca n't help loving you , child , "
171762	171823	171759	171759	she	9330	" and yet I am so angry with you that I have scarce the patience to speak to you . So you have actually engaged yourself to poor Maria , who is as old as your mother ? What will Madam Esmond say ? She may live three hundred years , and you will not have wherewithal to support yourselves . "
171824	171845	171847	171847	Harry	701	" I have ten thousand pounds from my father , of my own , now my poor brother is gone , "
171849	171856	171847	171847	Harry	701	" that will go some way . "
171857	171871	171759	171759	she	9330	" Why , the interest will not keep you in card - money . "
171872	171879	171881	171881	Harry	701	" We must give up cards , "
171883	171997	171881	171881	Harry	701	" It is more than Maria is capable of . She will pawn the coat off your back to play . The rage for it runs in all my brother 's family in me too , I own it . I warned you . I prayed you not to play with them , and now a lad of twenty to engage himself to a woman of forty - two ! to write letters on his knees and signed with his heart 's blood which he spells like hartshorn , and say that he will marry no other woman than his adorable cousin , Lady Maria Esmond . Oh ! it 's cruel cruel ! "
171998	172010	172012	172012	Harry	701	" Great heavens ! madam , who showed you my letter ? "
172020	172093	172012	172012	Harry	701	" An accident . She fainted when she was taken by those bailiffs . Brett cut her laces for her ; and when she was carried off , poor thing , we found a little sachet on the floor , which I opened , not knowing in the least what it contained . And in it was Mr. Harry Warrington 's precious letter . And here , sir , is the case . "
172102	172113	172114	172114	he	701	" Great heavens ! why did n't she destroy it ? "
172117	172127	172128	172128	he	701	" I I will give it back to Maria , "
172140	172151	172153	172155	the old lady	2505	" My dear , I have burned the foolish letter , "
172157	172302	172153	172155	the old lady	2505	" If you choose to betray me I must take the consequence . If you choose to write another , I can not help thee . But , in that case , Harry Esmond , I had rather never see thee again . Will you keep my secret ? Will you believe an old woman who loves you and knows the world better than you do ? I tell you , if you keep that foolish promise , misery and ruin are surely in store for you . What is a lad like you in the hands of a wily woman of the world , who makes a toy of you ? She has entrapped you into a promise , and your old aunt has cut the strings and set you free . Go back again ! Betray me if you will , Harry . "
172303	172317	172319	172320	Mr. Warrington	701	" I am not angry with you , aunt I wish I were , "
172327	172338	172319	172320	Mr. Warrington	701	" I I shall not repeat what you told me . "
172339	172349	172351	172353	the old lady	2505	" Maria never will , child mark my words ! "
172357	172378	172351	172353	the old lady	2505	" She will never own that she has lost that paper . She will tell you that she has it . "
172379	172400	172402	172402	Harry	701	" But I am sure she she is very fond of me ; you should have seen her last night , "
172404	172417	172420	172421	the Baroness	2319	" Must I tell more stories against my own flesh and blood ? "
172423	172434	172420	172421	the Baroness	2319	" Child , you do not know her past life ! "
172435	172446	172448	172448	Harry	701	" And I must not , and I will not ! "
172453	172538	172448	172448	Harry	701	" Written or said it does not matter which ! But my word is given ; they may play with such things in England , but we gentlemen of Virginia do n't break 'em . If she holds me to my word , she shall have me . If we are miserable , as I dare say we shall be , I 'll take a firelock , and go join the King of Prussia , or let a ball put an end to me . "
172539	172568	172576	172578	the old lady	2505	" I I have no more to say . Will you be pleased to ring that bell ? I I wish you a good morning , Mr. Warrington , "
172686	172691	172693	172693	he	701	" Ah , aunt ! "
172695	172731	172693	172693	he	701	" you do n't know what a villain I feel myself . When you told me , just now how that paper was burned oh ! I was ashamed to think how glad I was . "
172813	172826	172827	172827	she	2505	" You will not tell her what I have done , child ? "
173319	173333	173335	173336	Lady Maria	690	" Great heavens ! she must have told him that she stole it ! "
173612	173633	173634	173634	she	690	" Ah , child ! have I not thy precious image , thy precious hair , thy precious writing here ? "
173642	173668	173669	173669	she	690	" Shall it not go with me to the grave ? It would , sir , were I to meet with unkindness from my Henrico ! "
173945	173955	173957	173958	Mr. Warrington	701	" And you have brought back my horse sound ? "
173960	173967	173969	173970	Mr. Will	913	" Your horse ! what horse ? "
173972	173979	173981	173982	Mr. Harry	701	" What horse ? my horse ! "
173986	173994	173996	173996	Will	913	" Protest I do n't understand you , "
173998	174023	174025	174026	Mr. Warrington	701	" The brown horse for which I played you , and which I won of you the night before you rode away upon it , "
174030	174039	174025	174026	Mr. Warrington	701	" You remember the horse , Mr. Esmond . "
174040	174068	173981	173982	Mr. Harry	701	" Mr. Warrington , I perfectly well remember playing you for a horse , which my servant handed over to you on the day of your departure . "
174069	174088	174089	174090	Mr. Warrington	701	" The chaplain was present at our play . Mr. Sampson , will you be umpire between us ? "
174097	174112	174114	174115	Mr. Sampson	888	" I am bound to decide that Mr. Warrington played for the brown horse , "
174117	174126	174128	174130	sulky Mr. Will	913	" Well , he got the other one , "
174136	174144	174146	174147	Mr. Warrington	701	" And sold it for thirty shillings ! "
174159	174183	174155	174155	Will	913	" Thirty shillings ? and a devilish good price , too , for the broken - kneed old rip . Ha , ha ! "
174184	174212	174151	174151	his	701	" Not a word more . ' Tis only a question about a bet , my dear Lady Maria . Shall I serve you some more chicken ? "
174348	174359	174361	174362	Mr. Warrington	701	" I guess there 's going to be a quarrel , "
174366	174384	174361	174362	Mr. Warrington	701	" and there is no use in having these fellows look on at rows between their betters . "
174385	174399	174401	174401	Will	913	" Who is going to quarrel here , I should like to know ? "
174412	174431	174401	174401	Will	913	" Mr. Sampson , you were present when I played Mr. Will fifty guineas against his brown horse ? "
174432	174437	174440	174441	Mr. Will	913	" Against his horse ! "
174443	174457	174459	174460	Mr. Warrington	701	" I am not such a something fool as you take me for , "
174462	174470	174472	174472	he	701	" although I do come from Virginia ! "
174477	174501	174472	174472	he	701	" Mr. Sampson , you were here when I played the Honourable William Esmond , Esquire , fifty guineas against his brown horse ? "
174502	174510	174512	174513	the chaplain	4987	" I must own it , sir , "
174525	174535	174537	174538	Mr. Will	913	" I do n't own no such a thing , "
174546	174564	174566	174567	Mr. Warrington	701	" No , sir : because it costs you no more pains to lie than to cheat , "
174575	174596	174566	174567	Mr. Warrington	701	" Hands off , Mr. Chaplain , and see fair play ! Because you are no better than a ha ! "
174691	174704	174706	174707	the parson	2199	" Great heavens , gentlemen , I pray you to be quiet ! "
174981	174996	174998	174999	Mr. Warrington	701	" Chaplain , you will bear witness that it has been a fair fight ! "
175107	175127	175129	175130	Mr. Warrington	701	" Mr. Sampson will bear witness that I struck fair , and that Mr. Esmond hit the first blow , "
175132	175177	175129	175130	Mr. Warrington	701	" Undo his neckcloth , somebody he may be dead ; and get a fleam , Gumbo , and bleed him . Stop ! He is coming to himself ! Lift him up , you , and tell a maid to wash the floor . "
175252	175258	175260	175261	Mr. Warrington	701	" He is getting well , "
175263	175270	175260	175261	Mr. Warrington	701	" Oh , praise be Mussy ! "
175276	175289	175291	175292	Mr. Warrington	701	" Ask him , Gumbo , whether he would like any more ? "
175299	175310	175312	175313	obedient Gumbo	689	" Massa Harry say , wool you like any maw ? "
175321	175331	175333	175334	Mr. Will	913	" No , curse you , you black devil ! "
175345	175358	175359	175359	Gumbo	689	" So he nearly cut my tongue in to in my mouf ! "
175366	175389	175359	175359	Gumbo	689	" No , that is , yes ! You infernal Mohock ! Why does not somebody kick him out of the place ? "
175390	175398	175400	175401	Mr. Warrington	701	" Because nobody dares , Mr. Esmond , "
175414	175421	175423	175424	the men	19768	" And nobody wo n't neither , "
175443	175465	175435	175436	Mr. Will	9427	" We know all 's fair , sir . It ai n't the first time Master William have been served so . "
175466	175477	175480	175480	Betty	691	" And I hope it wo n't be the last , "

He is an offshoot of that disreputable family of Esmond , Castlewood , of whom all the men are gamblers and spendthrifts , and all the women well , I sha n't say the word , lest Lady Ailesbury should be looking over your shoulder . Both the late lords , my father told me , were in his pay , and the last one , a beau of Queen Anne 's reign , from a viscount advanced to be an earl through the merits and intercession of his notorious old sister Bernstein , late Tusher , nee Esmond a great beauty , too , of her day , a favourite of the old Pretender . She sold his secrets to my papa , who paid her for them ; and being nowise particular in her love for the Stuarts , came over to the august Hanoverian house at present reigning over us . ' Will Horace Walpole 's tongue never stop scandal ? ' says your wife over your shoulder . I kiss your ladyship 's hand . I am dumb . The Bernstein is a model of virtue . She had no good reasons for marrying her father 's chaplain . Many of the nobility omit the marriage altogether . She was n't ashamed of being Mrs. Tusher , and did n't take a German Baroncino for a second husband , whom nobody out of Hanover ever saw . The Yarmouth bears no malice . Esther and Vashti are very good friends , and have been cheating each other at Tunbridge at cards all the summer . "

When we were at Vauxhall , Mr. Jack gave us a nod under the shoulder of a pretty young fellow enough , on whose arm he was leaning , and who appeared hugely delighted with the enchantments of the garden . Lord , how he stared at the fireworks ! Gods , how he huzzayed at the singing of a horrible painted wench who shrieked the ears off my head ! A twopenny string of glass beads and a strip of tawdry cloth are treasures in Iroquois - land , and our savage valued them accordingly . "

I saw him blush up to the eyes , and make her , upon my word , a very fine bow , such as I had no idea was practised in wigwams . ' There is a certain jenny squaw about her , and that 's why the savage likes her , ' George said a joke certainly not as brilliant as a firework . After which it seemed to me that the savage and the savages retired together . "

I should advise my honored Mother . Our party there broke up end of August : the partridge - shooting commencing . Baroness Bernstein , whose kindness to me has been most invariable , has been to Bath , her usual winter resort , and has made me a welcome present of a fifty - pound bill . I rode back with Rev. Mr. Sampson , whose instruction I find most valluble , and my cousin , Lady Maria , to Castlewood . Could Parson Sampson have been dictating the above remarks to Mr. Warrington ? I paid a flying visit on the way to my dear kind friends Col . and Mrs. Lambert , Oakhurst House , who send my honored mother their most affectionate remembrances .

The October meeting was just begun at Cambridge when I went . I saw the students in their gownds and capps , and rode over to the famous Newmarket Heath , where there happened to be some races my friend Lord Marchs horse Marrowbones by Cleaver coming off winner of a large steak . It was an amusing day the jockeys , horses , etc . , very different to our poor races at home the betting awful the richest noblemen here mix with the jox , and bett all round .

When he heard my name , and how dearest George had served and fallen in Braddock 's unfortunate campaign , he talked a great deal with me ; asked why a young fellow like me did not serve too ; why I did not go to the King of Prussia , who was a great General , and see a campaign or two ; and whether that would not be better than dawdling about at routs and card - parties in London ? I said , I would like to go with all my heart , but was an only son now , on leave from my mother , and belonged to our estate in Virginia . His Royal Highness said , Mr. Braddock had wrote home accounts of Mrs. Esmond 's loyalty , and that he would gladly serve me . Mr. Wolfe and I have waited on him since , at his Royal Highness 's house in Pall Mall . The latter , who is still quite a young man , made the Scots campaign with his Highness , whom Mr. Dempster loves so much at home . To be sure , he was too severe : if anything can be top severe against rebels in arms . "

When you were born in our Western Principallitie , my mother was not as old as Isaac 's ; but even then I was much more than old enough to be yours . And though she gave you all she could leave or give , including the little portion of love that ought to have been my share , yet , if we can have good will for one another , we may learn to do without affection : and some little kindness you owe me , for your son 's sake ; as well as your father 's , whom I loved and admired more than any man I think ever I knew in this world : he was greater than almost all , though he made no noyse in it . I have seen very many who have , and , believe me , have found but few with such good heads and good harts as Mr. Esmond . "

He is prudent of his tongue , generous of his money , as bold as a lyon , with an imperious domineering way that sets well upon him ; you know whether he is handsome or not : my dear , I like him none the less for not being over witty or wise , and never cared for your sett - the - Thames afire gentlemen , who are so much more clever than their neighbours . Your father 's great friend , Mr. Addison , seemed to me but a supercillious prig , and his follower , Sir Dick Steele , was not pleasant in his cupps , nor out of 'em . And revenons a luy your Master Harry will certainly , pot burn the river up with his wits . Of book - learning he is as ignorant as any lord in England , and for this I hold him none the worse .

My brother has had a slice ; my dear sister wants to swallow the whole of him bodily . Here have I been at home respecting his youth and innocence forsooth , declining to play beyond the value of a sixpence , and acting guardian and Mentor to him . Why , I am but a fool to fatten a goose for other people to feed off ! Not many a good action have I done in this life , and here is this one , that serves to benefit whom ? other folks . Talk of remorse ! By all the fires and furies , the remorse I have is for things I have n't done and might have done ! Why did I spare Lucretia ?

And I have a bad repute ; and I am the man people point at , and call the wicked lord , and against whom women warn their sons !

187655	187665	187652	187653	Mr. Warrington	701	" said my lord , with an appealing look , "
187749	187939	187944	187944	cousin	19751	" And the pair walked out of the King 's apartments and into Saint James 's Street . Harry found the news of his cold reception at court had already preceded him to White 's . The King had turned his back upon him . The King was jealous of Harry 's favour with the favourite . Harry was au mieux with Lady Yarmouth . A score of gentlemen wished him a compliment upon his conquest . Before night it was a settled matter that this was amongst the other victories of the Fortunate Youth . Sir Miles told his wife and Harry as much , when the young man appeared at the appointed hour at the Baronet 's dinner - table , and he rallied Harry in his simple rustic fashion . The lady , at first a grand and stately personage , told Harry , on their further acquaintance , that the reputation which the world had made for him was so bad , that at first she had given him but a frigid welcome . With the young ladies , Sir Miles 's daughters , it was "
187946	187948	187944	187944	cousin	19751	" and "
187956	188041	187944	187944	cousin	19751	" and a number of prim curtseys to the Virginian , as they greeted him and took leave of him . The little boy , the heir of the house , dined at table , under the care of his governor ; and , having his glass of port by papa after dinner , gave a loose to his innocent tongue , and asked many questions of his cousin . At last the innocent youth said , after looking hard in Harry 's face , "
188056	188057	188049	188049	You	19751	" "
188063	188072	188061	188061	Miles	770	" expostulates the tutor , turning very red . "
188082	188087	188076	188076	you	19751	" cried the child . "
188096	188100	188094	188094	Miley	1348	" explains papa . "

188173	188174	188166	188167	Lady Yarmouth	932	" "
188182	188186	188176	188176	you	19751	" cries papa : "
188235	188278	188218	188218	Topsham	1350	" The idea of the little horse consoled Master Miles ; for , when his father ordered him away to his sisters , he had begun to cry bitterly , bawling out that he would far rather stay with his wicked cousin . "
188291	188297	188279	188279	They	9989	" says the jolly Baronet . "
188368	188369	188350	188351	Mr. Walker	1349	" "
188382	188390	188379	188379	he	770	" cries Harry , warm with port : "
188451	188452	188444	188444	I	0	" "
188465	188470	188463	188463	Harry	701	" says the Baronet . "
188516	188539	188540	188540	Thou	0	" Harry , as in duty bound , emptied his glass , filled again , and drank Lady Warrington and Master Miles . "
188557	188562	188552	188552	he	0	" said the Baronet . "
188582	188767	188572	188572	I	0	" says Mr. Warrington . He went up presently and took a dish of coffee with Lady Warrington : he talked to the young ladies of the house . He was quite easy , pleasant , and natural . There was one of them somewhat like Fanny Mountain , and this young lady became his special favourite . When he went away , they all agreed their wicked cousin was not near so wicked as they had imagined him to be : at any rate , my lady had strong hopes of rescuing him from the pit . She sent him a good book that evening , whilst Mr. Harry was at White 's ; with a pretty note , praying that Law 's Call might be of service to him : and , this despatched , she and her daughters went off to a rout at the house of a minister 's lady . But Harry , before he went to White 's , had driven to his friend Mr. Sparks , in Tavistock Street , and purchased more trinkets for his female cousins "
188774	188937	188938	188939	Poor boy	10015	" he said . You see , he was full of kindness : he kindled and warmed with prosperity . There are men on whom wealth hath no such fortunate influence . It hardens base hearts : it makes those who were mean and servile , mean and proud . If it should please the gods to try me with ten thousand a year , I will , of course , meekly submit myself to their decrees , but I will pray them to give me strength enough to bear the trial . All the girls in Hill Street were delighted at getting the presents from Aunt Warrington in Virginia and addressed a collective note , which must have astonished that good lady when she received it in spring - time , when she and Mountain and Fanny were on a visit to grim deserted Castlewood , when the snows had cleared away and a thousand peach - trees flushed with blossoms . "
188941	188945	188938	188939	Poor boy	10015	" the mother thought "
189020	189403	189016	189018	my good people	10019	" And so , I dare say , they warmed themselves by one log , and ate of one dish , and worked by one candle . And the widow 's servants , whom the good soul began to pinch more and more I fear , lied , stole , and cheated more and more : and what was saved in one way , was stole in another . One afternoon , Mr. Harry sate in his Bond Street lodgings , arrayed in his dressing - gown , sipping his chocolate , surrounded by luxury , encased in satin , and yet enveloped in care . A few weeks previously when the luck was with him , and he was scattering his benefactions to and fro , he had royally told Parson Sampson to get together a list of his debts which he , Mr. Warrington , would pay . Accordingly Sampson had gone to work , and had got together a list , not of all his debts no man ever does set down all , but such a catalogue as he thought sufficient to bring in to Mr. Warrington , at whose breakfast - table the divine had humbly waited until his honour should choose to attend it . Harry appeared at length , very pale and languid , in curl - papers , and scarce any appetite for his breakfast ; and the chaplain , fumbling with his schedule in his pocket , humbly asked if his patron had had a bad night ? He had been brought home from White 's by two chairmen at five o'clock in the morning ; had caught a confounded cold , for one of the windows of the chair would not shut , and the rain and snow came in , finally , was in such a bad humour , that all poor Sampson 's quirks and jokes could scarcely extort a smile from him . At last , to be sure , Mr. Warrington burst into a loud laugh . It was when the poor chaplain , after a sufficient discussion of muffins , eggs , tea , the news , the theatres , and so forth , pulled a paper out of his pocket and in a piteous tone said , "
189467	189527	189534	189534	you	0	" It was then that Harry , taking the paper and eyeing the chaplain with rather a wicked look , burst into a laugh , which was , however , anything but jovial . Wicked execrations , moreover , accompanied this outbreak of humour , and the luckless chaplain felt that his petition had come at the wrong moment . "
189540	189544	189534	189534	you	0	" Harry asked . "
189557	189565	189534	189534	you	0	" echoed the chaplain 's timid soul . "
189584	189585	189581	189582	Mr. Warrington	701	" "
189633	189634	189623	189623	I	0	" "
189642	189661	189665	189665	sir	19663	" asks his reverence , with a voice that was reassured , though it intended to be alarmed . "
189726	189984	189723	189724	the Philistines	899	" But though he laughed in Sampson 's presence , and strove to put a good face upon the matter , Harry 's head sank down on his chest when the parson quitted him , and he sate over the fire , beating the coals about with the poker , and giving utterance to many disjointed naughty words , which showed , but did not relieve , the agitation of his spirit . In this mood , the young fellow was interrupted by the appearance of a friend , who , on any other day even on that one when his conscience was so uneasy was welcome to Mr. Warrington . This was no other than Mr. Lambert , in his military dress , but with a cloak over him , who had come from the country , had been to the Captain - General 's levee that morning , and had come thence to visit his young friend in Bond Street . Harry may have thought Lambert 's greeting rather cold ; but being occupied with his own affairs , he put away the notion . How were the ladies of Oakhurst , and Miss Hetty , who was ailing when he passed through in the autumn ? Purely ? Mr. Warrington was very glad . They were come to stay a while in London with their friend , Lord Wrotham ? Mr. Harry was delighted though it must be confessed his face did not exhibit any peculiar signs of pleasure when he heard the news . "
190041	190046	190047	190047	My	0	" asks the Colonel . "
190058	190068	190051	190051	I	0	" says Harry , with rather a high manner . "
190082	190083	190072	190073	richer folks	10040	" "
190086	190091	190084	190084	Sir	19663	" says Mr. Warrington , "
190109	190110	190111	190111	I	0	" "
190120	190134	190111	190111	I	0	" said the other , not noticing the young man 's haughty tone , "
190179	190180	190181	190182	Colonel Lambert	975	" "
190194	190204	190181	190182	Colonel Lambert	975	" cries Mr. Warrington , more and more impatient . "
190258	190259	190260	190260	I	0	" "
190270	190280	190260	190260	I	0	" says Harry , scowling at his old friend . "
190332	190371	190375	190375	Harry	701	" Here the Colonel drew a packet out of his pocket , whereof the lappets and the coat - tails and the general pocket accommodations were much more ample than in the scant military garments of present warriors . "
190452	190453	190454	190454	Sir	19663	" "
190465	190474	190454	190454	Sir	19663	" says Harry , blushing burning - red . "
190557	190621	190549	190550	Harry Warrington	701	" Here the good Colonel 's voice was much moved , and his face grew very red , and he passed his hand over his eyes ere he held it out . But the spirit of rebellion was strong in Mr. Warrington . He rose up from his seat , never offering to take the hand which his senior held out to him . "
190630	190634	190627	190628	Colonel Lambert	975	" he said , "
190720	190721	190713	190713	you	701	" "
190731	190742	190728	190729	Mr. Warrington	701	" says the Colonel , with a very sad face . "
190763	190768	190761	190761	sir	19663	" cries Mr. Warrington . "
190839	190864	190837	190837	sir	19663	" Saying which , and rustling in his brocade dressing - gown , Mr. Warrington , with much state , walked off to his bedroom .
190912	190921	190923	190925	the young man	2122	" He has humiliated me before the girls ! "
190927	191001	190923	190925	the young man	2122	" He and Mr. Wolfe , who were forever preaching morality to me , and giving themselves airs of superiority and protection , have again been holding me up to the family as a scapegrace and prodigal . They are so virtuous that they wo n't shake me by the hand , forsooth ; and when I want to show them a little common gratitude , they fling my presents in my face ! "
191002	191016	191018	191019	Parson Sampson	906	" Why , sir , the things must be worth a little fortune ! "
191048	191056	191058	191060	the young man	2122	" They cost some money , Sampson , "
191062	191081	191058	191060	the young man	2122	" Not that I would grudge ten times the amount to people who have been kind to me . "
191082	191096	191098	191098	Sampson	906	" No , faith , sir , not if I know your honour ! "
191114	191150	191098	191098	Sampson	906	" The repeater , they told me , was a great bargain , and worth a hundred pounds at Paris . Little Miss Hetty I remember saying that she longed to have a repeating watch . "
191151	191158	191160	191161	the chaplain	4987	" Oh , what a love ! "
191163	191194	191160	191161	the chaplain	4987	" with a little circle of pearls on the back , and a diamond knob for the handle ! Why , ' twould win any woman 's heart , Sir ! "
191195	191218	191220	191221	Mr. Warrington	701	" There passes an apple - woman with a basket . I have a mind to fling the thing out to her ! "
191430	191475	191427	191427	all	8149	" That is young Esmond , of Castlewood , on the Potomac , Madam Esmond 's son ; and he has been losing his money at play , and he has been selling out so much , and so much , and so much . "
191582	191593	191569	191569	he	1356	" Much good may they do you . H. E. W. "
191770	191776	191778	191779	Lord Castlewood	707	" Just for an hour , "
191781	191790	191778	191779	Lord Castlewood	707	" I dine at Arlington Street at four . "
191791	191797	191799	191800	Mr. Warrington	701	" Just for an hour , "
191808	191817	191819	191820	my lord	2193	" Or shall we have 'em in upstairs ? "
191822	191828	191819	191820	my lord	2193	" Out of the noise ? "
191829	191837	191839	191839	Harry	701	" Certainly , out of the noise , "
191906	191910	192092	192094	No . 1	10130	" Whose phaeton ? "
191918	191924	191926	191928	No . 2	10129	" The Fortunate Youth 's , "
191930	191965	191926	191928	No . 2	10129	" Not so fortunate the last three nights . Luck confoundedly against him . Lost , last night , thirteen hundred to the table . Mr. Warrington been here to - day , John ? "
191966	191996	191998	191998	John	1000	" Mr. Warrington is in the house now , sir . In the little tea - room with Lord Castlewood since three o'clock . They are playing at piquet , "
192000	192006	192008	192010	No . 1	10130	" What fun for Castlewood ! "
192024	192029	192030	192030	he	10131	" Curse the fellow ! "
192033	192086	192030	192030	he	10131	" He has no right to be in this club at all . He does n't pay if he loses . Gentlemen ought not to play with him . Sir Miles Warrington told me at court the other day , that Castlewood has owed him money on a bet these three years . "
192087	192090	192092	192094	No . 1	10130	" Castlewood , "
192096	192124	192092	192094	No . 1	10130	" do n't lose if he plays alone . A large company flurries him , you see that 's why he does n't come to the table . "
192141	192150	192030	192030	he	10131	" Let 's go up and stop 'em , "
192156	192159	192161	192162	the other	19802	" Why ? "
192164	192199	192161	192162	the other	19802	" Much better look out a - window . Lamplighter going up the ladder famous sport . Look at that old putt in the chair : did you ever see such an old quiz ? "
192200	192249	192030	192030	he	10131	" Who is that just gone out of the house ? As I live , it 's Fortunatus ! He seems to have forgotten that his phaeton has been here , waiting all the time . I bet you two to one he has been losing to Castlewood . "
192250	192262	192264	192269	the one gentleman of the other	10135	" Jack , do you take me to be a fool ? "
192271	192287	192264	192269	the one gentleman of the other	10135	" Pretty pair of horses the youth has got . How he is flogging 'em ! "
192389	192398	192400	192402	Gumbo 's master	10143	" Gumbo , has Mr. Sampson been here ? "
192409	192421	192423	192424	Mr. Warrington	701	" No , sar . Mr. Sampson have not been here ! "
192444	192455	192457	192458	Mr. Gumbo	689	" Addressed to Mr. Sampson ? Oh yes , sir , "
192465	192480	192482	192482	Harry	701	" A sealed letter , stupid ! on the mantelpiece , in the glass ! "
192718	192728	192730	192731	Lord March	1246	" Hang it ! stay and mend your luck ! "
192751	192762	192730	192731	Lord March	1246	" Take a hundred of mine , and go on ! "
192763	192776	192778	192778	Harry	701	" I have had enough for to - night , my lord , "
193248	193257	193259	193261	the young prodigal	10164	" Will my mother at home forgive me ? "
193263	193277	193259	193261	the young prodigal	10164	" Oh , that I were there , and had never left it ! "
193411	193416	193418	193418	Harry	701	" Oh , Parson ! "
193420	193438	193418	193418	Harry	701	" ' twas the worst night you ever made in your life ! Look here , sir ! "
193439	193461	193463	193464	the chaplain	4987	" Here is a broken envelope with the words , ' Much good may it do you , ' written within , "
193471	193479	193481	193482	Mr. Warrington	701	" Look on the outside , sir ! "
193484	193492	193481	193482	Mr. Warrington	701	" The paper was directed to you . "
193502	193512	193513	193513	he	21477	" Has some one broke it open , sir ? "
193516	193568	193513	193513	he	21477	" Some one , yes . I broke it open , Sampson . Had you come here as you proposed yesterday afternoon , you would have found that envelope full of bank - notes . As it is , they were all dropped at the infernal macco - table last night . "
193569	193574	193576	193576	Sampson	906	" What , all ? "
193578	193687	193576	193576	Sampson	906	" Yes , all , with all the money I brought away from the city , and all the ready money I have left in the world . In the afternoon I played piquet with my cous with a gentleman at White 's and he eased me of all the money I had about me . Remembering that there was still some money left here , unless you had fetched it , I came home and carried it back and left it at the macco - table , with every shilling besides that belongs to me and great heaven , Sampson , what 's the matter , man ? "
193688	193700	193703	193705	the unfortunate chaplain	10175	" It 's my luck , it 's my usual luck , "
193713	193736	193739	193740	Mr. Warrington	701	" What ! You are not whimpering like a baby at the loss of a loan of a couple of hundred pounds ? "
193747	193770	193739	193740	Mr. Warrington	701	" Leave the room , Gumbo ! Confound you ! why are you always poking your woolly head in at that door ! "
193771	193784	193786	193787	Mr. Gumbo	689	" Some one below wants to see master with a little bill , "
193789	193797	193800	193801	Mr. Warrington	701	" Tell him to go to Jericho ! "
193803	193824	193800	193801	Mr. Warrington	701	" Let me see nobody ! I am not at home , sir , at this hour of the morning ! "
193876	193895	193896	193896	he	701	" Had n't you better take a bumper of brandy to keep your spirits up , Mr. Sampson ? "
193899	193913	193896	193896	he	701	" Hang it , man ! do n't be snivelling like a woman ! "
193914	193922	193924	193924	Sampson	906	" Oh , it 's not me ! "
193930	193939	193924	193924	Sampson	906	" I am used to it , sir . "
193940	193959	193961	193962	Mr. Warrington	701	" Not you ! Who , then ? Are you crying because somebody else is hurt , pray ? "
193964	193969	193971	193972	the chaplain	4987	" Yes , sir ! "
193978	194125	193971	193972	the chaplain	4987	" because somebody else is hurt , and through my fault . I have lodged for many years in London with a bootmaker , a very honest man : and , a few days since , having a perfect reliance upon upon a friend who had promised to accommodate me with a loan I borrowed sixty pounds from my landlord which he was about to pay to his own . I ca n't get the money . My poor landlord 's goods will be seized for rent ; his wife and dear young children will be turned into the street ; and this honest family will be ruined through my fault . But , as you say , Mr. Warrington , I ought not to snivel like a woman . I will remember that you helped me once , and will bid you farewell , sir . "
194220	194241	194214	194214	Harry	701	" Sampson , Sampson ! hang you ! come back ! It 's a mistake ! I beg your pardon ! "
194424	194428	194430	194430	he	701	" Not that ! "
194448	194461	194433	194433	Gumbo	689	" A plain suit the plainer the better ! The black clothes . "
194640	194662	194615	194616	Mr. Ruff	1361	" Much obliged if Mr. Warrington will settle . Mrs. Ruff has a large account to make up to - day . "
194711	194725	194727	194728	Mr. Ruff	1361	" Perhaps his honour will have the kindness to settle the little account ? "
194730	194739	194741	194741	Harry	701	" Of course I will settle the account , "
194756	194765	194741	194741	Harry	701	" Perhaps Mr. Warrington will settle it now ? "
194766	194778	194780	194781	Mr. Warrington	701	" No , Sir , I will not settle it now ! "
194786	194799	194801	194804	the voice under him	10206	" I 'm very very much in want of money , sir , "
194806	194810	194801	194804	the voice under him	10206	" Mrs. Ruff is "
194811	194823	194825	194826	Mr. Warrington	701	" Hang you , sir , get out of the way ! "
194902	194912	194914	194914	he	701	" I can shoulder a musket at any rate , "
195099	195121	195122	195122	she	10224	" There 's only thirteen pound in the house , and he will be here at one , I tell you ! "
195133	195142	195144	195146	the gasping chaplain	10229	" Hush , hush ! my good creature ! "
195160	195187	195189	195189	he	701	" Do n't you see Mr. Warrington ? I 've business with him most important business . It will be all right , I tell you ! "
195212	195224	195226	195227	Mr. Warrington	701	" Sampson , I have come to ask your pardon again , "
195232	195252	195226	195227	Mr. Warrington	701	" What I said to - day to you was very cruel and unjust , and unlike a gentleman . "
195253	195261	195263	195264	the other	19802	" Not a word more , sir , "
195281	195291	195292	195292	Harry	701	" I see you are still angry with me , "
195295	195351	195352	195352	he	701	" Nay , sir , an apology is an apology . A man of my station can ask for no more from one of yours . No doubt you did not mean to give me pain . And what if you did ? And you are not the only one of the family who has , "
195363	195377	195378	195378	he	701	" I wish I had never known the name of Esmond or Castlewood , "
195381	195446	195378	195378	he	701	" or that place yonder of which the picture hangs over my fireplace , and where I have buried myself these long , long years . My lord , your cousin , took a fancy to me , said he would make my fortune , has kept me as his dependant till fortune has passed by me , and now refuses me my due . "
195447	195458	195460	195460	Harry	701	" How do you mean your due , Mr. Sampson ? "
195462	195571	195460	195460	Harry	701	" I mean three years ' salary which he owes me as chaplain of Castlewood . Seeing you could give me no money , I went to his lordship this morning and asked him . I fell on my knees , and asked him , sir . But his lordship had none . He gave me civil words , at least saving your presence , Mr. Warrington , but no money that is , five guineas , which he declared was all he had and which I took . But what are five guineas amongst so many Oh , those poor little children ! those poor little children ! "
195572	195581	195584	195584	Harry	701	" Lord Castlewood said he had no money ? "
195586	195610	195584	195584	Harry	701	" He won eleven hundred pounds , yesterday , of me at piquet which I paid him out of this pocket - book . "
195611	195636	195638	195639	Mr. Sampson	910	" I dare say , sir , I dare say , sir . One ca n't believe a word his lordship says , sir , "
195641	195662	195638	195639	Mr. Sampson	910	" but I am thinking of execution in this house , and ruin upon these poor folks to - morrow . "
195663	195669	195671	195672	Mr. Warrington	701	" That need not happen , "
195674	195739	195671	195672	Mr. Warrington	701	" Here are eighty guineas , Sampson . As far as they go , God help you ! ' Tis all I have to give you . I wish to my heart I could give more as I promised ; but you did not come at the right time , and I am a poor devil now until I get my remittances from Virginia . "
195767	195773	195775	195775	he	4987	" Great powers , sir ! "
195777	195863	195775	195775	he	4987	" are you a guardian angel that Heaven hath sent me ? You quarrelled with my tears this morning , Mr. Warrington . I ca n't help them now . They burst , sir , from a grateful heart . A rock of stone would pour them forth , sir , before such goodness as yours ! May Heaven eternally bless you , and give you prosperity ! May my unworthy prayers be heard in your behalf , my friend , my best benefactor ! May "
195864	195878	195880	195880	Harry	701	" Nay , nay ! get up , friend get up , Sampson ! "

196584	196634	196581	196581	she	1119	" How ever can I tell you ? Mr. Gumbo have been here , Mr. Warrington 's coloured gentleman , miss ; and he says Mr. Warrington have been took by two bailiffs this evening , as he comes out of Sir Miles Warrington 's house three doors off . "

Why did you not come sooner to us , sir , and not lose your time amongst the spendthrifts and the vain world ? But ' tis not yet too late . We must reclaim thee , dear Harry !

What shrewdness mingled with his simplicity , and what a fine genteel manner , though upon mere worldly elegance I set little store . What a dreadful pity to think that such a vessel should ever be lost ! We must rescue him , my loves . We must take him away from those wicked companions , and those horrible Castlewoods not that I would speak ill of my neighbours . But I shall hope , I shall pray , that he may be rescued from his evil courses ! "
199544	199552	199542	199542	He	10339	" God bless you , my boy ! "
200380	200393	200395	200395	Harry	701	" A pretty sensation my arrest must have created at the club ! "

March will tremble about the bet I have with him ; and , faith , ' twill be difficult to pay him when I lose . They will all be setting up a whoop of congratulation at the Savage , as they call me , being taken prisoner . How shall I ever be able to appear in the world again ? Whom shall I ask to come to my help ? No , "
200513	200559	200504	200504	he	701	" I will not send in the first instance to any of my relations or my noble friends at White 's . I will have Sampson 's counsel . He has often been in a similar predicament , and will know how to advise me . "
200672	200693	200669	200669	he	1246	" I am fallen amongst the lions . Come down , my dear friend , into the pit with me . "
200855	200874	200876	200877	the sceptic	10539	" Well , if your honour does stay , there is good beef and carrot at two o'clock , "
201032	201073	201075	201076	Mr. Warrington	701	" All you have to do , sir , is to give me my clothes to dress , and to hold your tongue about this business . Mind you , not a word , sir , about it to anybody ! "
201080	201090	201092	201092	Gumbo	689	" Oh no , sir , never to nobody ! "
201623	201633	201612	201612	Gumbo	689	" Oh no , master ! nebber to nobody ! "
201747	201822	201738	201740	The unlucky divine	10583	" Oh , sir , dear sir , I have done all that a man can at the command and in the behalf of his patron ! You did not know , sir , to what you were subjecting me , did you ? Else , if I was to go to prison , why did I not share yours , and why am I in a lock - up house three doors off ? "
201922	201964	201965	201965	Your	10584	" I had much and of importance to say , which I do not care to write down on paper regarding your affairs . May they mend ! May my cursed fortunes , too , better themselves , is the prayer of "
201977	202183	201975	201976	J. S.	1374	" And now , as Mr. Sampson refuses to speak , it will be our duty to acquaint the reader with those matters whereof the poor chaplain did not care to discourse on paper . Gumbo 's loquacity had not reached so far as Long Acre , and Mr. Sampson was ignorant of the extent of his patron 's calamity until he received Harry 's letter and messenger from Chancery Lane . The divine was still ardent with gratitude for the service Mr. Warrington had just conferred on him , and eager to find some means to succour his distressed patron . He knew what a large sum Lord Castlewood had won from his cousin , had dined in company with his lordship on the day before , and now ran to Lord Castlewood 's house , with a hope of arousing him to some pity for Mr. Warrington . Sampson made a very eloquent and touching speech to Lord Castlewood about his kinsman 's misfortune , and spoke with a real kindness and sympathy , which , however , failed to touch the nobleman to whom he addressed himself . My lord peevishly and curtly put a stop to the chaplain 's passionate pleading . "
202211	202216	202209	202209	Sampson	910	" said his lordship , "
202283	202309	202268	202268	I	0	" And a letter to this effect did actually reach Mr. Warrington from his lodgings , whither it had been despatched by the penny post . "
202347	202352	202342	202342	he	701	" cried the chaplain . "
202374	202465	202368	202368	Your	0	" said my lord ; and resumed the reading of his paper , whilst , in the deepest despondency , poor Sampson left him . My Lady Maria meanwhile had heard that the chaplain was with her brother , and conjectured what might be the subject on which they had been talking . She seized upon the parson as he issued from out his fruitless interview with my lord . She drew him into the dining - room : the strongest marks of grief and sympathy were in her countenance . "
202478	202482	202475	202476	Mr. Warrington	701	" she asked . "
202490	202495	202483	202484	Your ladyship	19813	" asked the chaplain . "
202514	202519	202520	202520	We	10600	" asked my lady . "
202544	202545	202543	202543	I.	0	" "
202554	202558	202559	202559	Benson	719	" continued Sampson . "
202573	202589	202559	202559	Benson	719	" repeats Lady Maria . The chaplain lost all patience and temper at such duplicity . "
202595	202927	202559	202559	Benson	719	" he said , with an oath ; and he told Lady Maria of the conversation which he had just had with Lord Castlewood , and of the latter 's refusal to succour his cousin , after winning great sums of money from him , and with much eloquence and feeling , of Mr. Warrington 's most generous behaviour to himself . Then my Lady Maria broke out with a series of remarks regarding her own family , which were by no means complimentary to her own kith and kin . Although not accustomed to tell truth commonly , yet , when certain families fall out , it is wonderful what a number of truths they will tell about one another . With tears , imprecations , I do not like to think how much stronger language , Lady Maria burst into a furious and impassioned tirade , in which she touched upon the history of almost all her noble family . She complimented the men and the ladies alike ; she shrieked out interrogatories to Heaven , inquiring why it had made such never mind what names she called her brothers , sisters , uncles , aunts , parents ; and , emboldened with wrath , she dashed at her brother 's library door , so shrill in her outcries , so furious in her demeanour , that the alarmed chaplain , fearing the scene which might ensue , made for the street . My lord , looking up from the book or other occupation which engaged him , regarded the furious woman with some surprise , and selected a good strong oath to fling at her , as it were , and check her onset . But , when roused , we have seen how courageous Maria could be . Afraid as she was ordinarily of her brother , she was not in a mood to be frightened now by any language of abuse or sarcasm at his command . "
202933	202938	202939	202939	you	2193	" she called out , "

203039	203047	203023	203023	I	0	" says Castlewood , glaring at her . "

203070	203082	203050	203051	the women	5773	" says my lord , with a shrug of his shoulder . "
203164	203165	203166	203166	We	10613	" "

203568	203577	203545	203547	My good brother	10644	" interposed the sister of this affectionate brother . "
203607	203619	203604	203604	her	10646	" cries my lord . Maria said she failed to comprehend . "
203737	203738	203739	203740	My lord	2193	" "
203757	203761	203743	203743	you	2193	" asks Maria . "

203913	203937	203938	203938	I	0	" cried Maria , who , I suppose , admired truth in others , however little she saw it in her own family . "
203970	203971	203972	203973	My lord	2193	" "
203975	203980	203972	203973	My lord	2193	" gasps out Maria . "
204090	204091	204098	204099	my lord	2193	" "
204101	204105	204098	204099	my lord	2193	" interposes Maria . "

204183	204184	204178	204178	you	0	" "
204207	204735	204193	204193	I	0	" And so Maria Esmond , who had advanced to her brother like a raging lion , now sate down at his feet like a gentle lamb . Madame de Bernstein was not a little moved at the news of her nephew 's arrest , which Mr. Gumbo brought to Clarges Street on the night of the calamity . She would have cross - examined the black , and had further particulars respecting Harry 's mishap ; but Mr. Gumbo , anxious to carry his intelligence to other quarters , had vanished when her ladyship sent for him . Her temper was not improved by the news , or by the sleepless night which she spent . I do not envy the dame de compagnie who played cards with her , or the servant who had to lie in her chamber . An arrest was an everyday occurrence , as she knew very well as a woman of the world . Into what difficulties had her scapegrace of a nephew fallen ? How much money should she be called upon to pay to release him ? And had he run through all his own ? Provided he had not committed himself very deeply , she was quite disposed to aid him . She liked even his extravagances and follies . He was the only being in the world on whom , for long , long years , that weary woman had been able to bestow a little natural affection . So , on their different beds , she and Harry were lying wakeful together ; and quite early in the morning the messengers which each sent forth on the same business may have crossed each other . Madame Bernstein 's messenger was despatched to the chambers of her man of business , Mr. Draper , with an order that Mr. D. should ascertain for what sums Mr. Warrington had been arrested , and forthwith repair to the Baroness . Draper 's emissaries speedily found out that Mr. Warrington was locked up close beside them , and the amount of detainers against him so far . Were there other creditors , as no doubt there were , they would certainly close upon him when they were made acquainted with his imprisonment . To Mr. Sparks , the jeweller , for those unlucky presents , so much ; to the landlord in Bond Street , for board , fire , lodging , so much : these were at present the only claims against Mr. Warrington , Mr. Draper found . He was ready , at a signal from her ladyship , to settle them at a moment . The jeweller 's account ought especially to be paid , for Mr. Harry had acted most imprudently in taking goods from Mr. Sparks on credit , and pledging them with a pawnbroker . He must have been under some immediate pressure for money ; intended to redeem the goods immediately , meant nothing but what was honourable of course ; but the affair would have an ugly look , if made public , and had better be settled out of hand . "
204762	204834	204755	204756	Mr. Warrington	701	" said Madame de Bernstein . Not the least : her ladyship knew very well that there were funds belonging to Mr. Warrington , on which money could be at once raised with her ladyship 's guarantee . Should he go that instant and settle the matter with Messrs. Amos ? Mr. Harry might be back to dine with her at two , and to confound the people at the clubs , "
204844	204858	204755	204756	Mr. Warrington	701	" said the compassionate Mr. Draper . But the Baroness had other views . "
204867	204871	204864	204865	Mr. Draper	1246	" she said , "
204913	204914	204905	204905	You	1246	" "
204926	204931	204915	204916	No gentleman	20818	" says Mr. Draper ; "
204941	204942	204932	204933	no one	2804	" "
204990	204991	204981	204981	I	0	" "
205006	205015	205000	205000	I	0	" says Mr. Draper , with a bow . "
205039	205475	205037	205037	everybody	3432	" So we must not whisper Madame Bernstein 's secret to Mr. Draper ; but the reader may perhaps guess it from the lawyer 's conduct subsequently . The lawyer felt pretty certain that ere long he would receive a summons from the poor young prisoner in Cursitor Street , and waited for that invitation before he visited Mr. Warrington . Six - and - thirty hours passed ere the invitation came , during which period Harry passed the dreariest two days which he ever remembered to have spent . There was no want of company in the lock - up house , the bailiff 's rooms were nearly always full ; but Harry preferred the dingy solitude of his own room to the society round his landlady 's table , and it was only on the second day of his arrest , and when his purse was emptied by the heavy charges of the place , that he made up his mind to apply to Mr. Draper . He despatched a letter then to the lawyer at the Temple , informing him of his plight , and desiring him , in an emphatic postscript , not to say one word about the matter to his aunt , Madame de Bernstein . He had made up his mind not to apply to the old lady except at the very last extremity . She had treated him with so much kindness that he revolted from the notion of trespassing on her bounty , and for a while tried to please himself with the idea that he might get out of durance without her even knowing that any misfortune at all had befallen him . There seemed to him something humiliating in petitioning a woman for money . No ! He would apply first to his male friends , all of whom might help him if they would . It had been his intention to send Sampson to one or other of them as a negotiator , had not the poor fellow been captured on his way to succour his friend . Sampson gone , Harry was obliged to have recourse to his own negro servant , who was kept on the trot all day between Temple Bar and the Court end of the town with letters from his unlucky master . Firstly , then , Harry sent off a most private and confidential letter to his kinsman , the Right Honourable the Earl of Castlewood , saying how he had been cast into prison , and begging Castlewood to lend him the amount of the debt . "
205496	205501	205037	205037	everybody	3432	" wrote poor Harry . "
205508	205517	205518	205518	I	0	" wrote back Lord Castlewood , in reply . "
205651	206381	206382	206383	My lord	2193	" This was the result of application number one : and we may imagine that Mr. Harry read the reply to his petition with rather a blank face . Never mind ! There was kind , jolly Uncle Warrington . Only last night his aunt had kissed him and loved him like a son . His uncle had called down blessings on his head , and professed quite a paternal regard for him . With a feeling of shyness and modesty in presence of those virtuous parents and family . Harry had never said a word about his wild doings , or his horse - racings , or his gamblings , or his extravagances . It must all out now . He must confess himself a Prodigal and a Sinner , and ask for their forgiveness and aid . So Prodigal sate down and composed a penitent letter to Uncle Warrington , and exposed his sad case , and besought him to come to the rescue . Was not that a bitter nut to crack for our haughty young Virginian ? Hours of mortification and profound thought as to the pathos of the composition did Harry pass over that letter ; sheet after sheet of Mr. Amos 's sixpence - a - sheet letter - paper did he tear up before the missive was complete , with which poor blubbering Gumbo much vilified by the bailiff 's followers and parasites , whom he was robbing , as they conceived , of their perquisites went his way . At evening the faithful negro brought back a thick letter in his aunt 's handwriting . Harry opened the letter with a trembling hand . He thought it was full of bank - notes . Ah me ! it contained a sermon Daniel in the Lions ' Den by Mr. Whitfield , and a letter from Lady Warrington saying that , in Sir Miles 's absence from London , she was in the habit of opening his letters , and hence , perforce , was become acquainted with a fact which she deplored from her inmost soul to learn , namely , that her nephew Warrington had been extravagant and was in debt . Of course , in the absence of Sir Miles , she could not hope to have at command such a sum as that for which Mr. Warrington wrote , but she sent him her heartfelt prayers , her deepest commiseration , and a discourse by dear Mr. Whitfield , which would comfort him in his present alas ! she feared not undeserved calamity . She added profuse references to particular Scriptural chapters which would do him good . If she might speak of things worldly , she said , at such a moment , she would hint to Mr. Warrington that his epistolary orthography was anything but correct . She would not fail for her part to comply with his express desire that his dear cousins should know nothing of this most painful circumstance , and with every wish for his welfare here and elsewhere , she subscribed herself his loving aunt , MARGARET WARRINGTON . Poor Harry hid his face between his hands , and sate for a while with elbows on the greasy table blankly staring into the candle before him . The bailiff 's servant , who was touched by his handsome face , suggested a mug of beer for his honour , but Harry could not drink , nor eat the meat that was placed before him . Gumbo , however , could , whose grief did not deprive him of appetite , and who , blubbering the while , finished all the beer , and all the bread and the meat . Meanwhile , Harry had finished another letter , with which Gumbo was commissioned to start again , and away the faithful creature ran upon his errand . Gumbo ran as far as White 's Club , to which house he was ordered in the first instance to carry the letter , and where he found the person to whom it was addressed . Even the prisoner , for whom time passed so slowly , was surprised at the celerity with which his negro had performed his errand . At least the letter which Harry expected had not taken long to write . "
206404	206416	206400	206402	Mr Mr. Morris	10710	" said Gumbo , and the letter was to this effect : "
206457	206463	206451	206451	Yours	19868	" Henry Warrington , Esq . "
206464	206471	206473	206474	Mr. Warrington	701	" Did Lord March say anything ? "
206479	206517	206519	206519	Gumbo	689	" He say it was the coolest thing he ever knew . So did Mr. Morris . He showed him your letter , Master Harry . Yes , Mr. Morris say , ' Dam his imperence ! ' "
206577	206588	206589	206589	he	701	" I I should like to smoke a pipe of Virginia "
206613	206629	206630	206630	he	701	" Oh , master , my dear master , what will they say at home ? "
206670	206681	206682	206683	the man	2270	" Your honour ai n't eat anything these two days , "
206693	206734	206682	206683	the man	2270	" Pluck up a little , sir . You are n't the first gentleman who has been in and out of grief before this . Let me go down and get you a glass of punch and a little supper . "
206735	206740	206742	206742	Harry	701	" My good friend , "
206753	206798	206742	206742	Harry	701	" you pay ready money for everything in this house , do n't you ? I must tell you that I have n't a shilling left to buy a dish of meat . All the money I have I want for letter - paper . "
206799	206807	206810	206810	Gumbo	689	" Oh , master , my master ! "
206812	206878	206810	206810	Gumbo	689	" Look here , my dear Master Harry ! Here 's plenty of money here 's twenty - three five - guineas . Here 's gold moidore from Virginia here no , not that that 's keepsakes the girls gave me . Take everything everything . I go sell myself to - morrow morning ; but here 's plenty for to - night , master ! "
206879	206886	206887	206887	Harry	701	" God bless you , Gumbo ! "
206900	206941	206887	206887	Harry	701	" You are free if I am not , and Heaven forbid I should not take the offered help of such a friend as you . Bring me some supper : but the pipe too , mind the pipe too ! "
207281	207290	207291	207292	honest Gumbo	689	" I wanted to bring some more clothes , "
207295	207312	207291	207292	honest Gumbo	689	" but Mr. Ruff , the landlord , he would n't let me bring no more . "
207425	207432	207434	207435	Mr. Gumbo	689	" With Colonel Lambert 's people , "
207444	207505	207434	207435	Mr. Gumbo	689	" And Miss Hetty she fall down in a faint , when she hear you taken up ; and Mr. Lambert , he very good man , and he say to me this morning , he say , ' Gumbo , you tell your master if he want me he send to me , and I come to him . ' "
207563	207568	207569	207569	he	689	" I send to Lambert "
207576	207605	207569	207569	he	689	" the man who insulted me , and flung my presents back in my face ! If I were starving I would not ask him for a crust ! "
207639	207664	207665	207665	Draper	1246	" The note was as haughty as if he was writing to one of his negroes , and not to a freeborn English gentleman , "
207678	207706	207708	207708	Draper	1246	" It 's all very well for a fine gentleman to give himself airs ; but for a fellow in a spunging - house ! Hang him ! "
207710	207720	207708	207708	Draper	1246	" I 've a great mind not to go ! "
207782	207799	207801	207803	the outraged attorney	10756	" Excuse me , madam , but such haughtiness and airs I ai n't accustomed to ! "
207805	207821	207823	207825	Madame de Bernstein	780	" Take a chair and go on with your story , my good Mr. Draper ! "
208088	208097	208099	208100	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Gumbo , a chair to Mr. Draper ! "
208119	208161	208099	208100	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Sit down , if you please , and let us talk my business over . Much obliged to you for coming so soon in reply to my message . Had you heard of this piece of ill - luck before ? "
208170	208179	208180	208180	he	1246	" Bad news travel quick , Mr. Warrington , "
208183	208225	208180	208180	he	1246	" and I was eager to offer my humble services as soon as ever you should require them . Your friends , your family , will be much pained that a gentleman of your rank should be in such a position . "
208226	208243	208244	208245	Mr. Draper	1246	" I have been very imprudent , Mr. Draper . I have lived beyond my means . "
208248	208293	208244	208245	Mr. Draper	1246	" I played in company with gentlemen who were much richer than myself , and a cursed run of ill - luck has carried away all my ready money , leaving me with liabilities to the amount of five hundred pounds , and more . "
208294	208302	208304	208305	Mr. Draper	1246	" Five hundred now in the office , "
208307	208371	208304	208305	Mr. Draper	1246	" Well , this is such a trifle that I thought by sending to one or two friends , yesterday , I could have paid my debt and gone home without further to do . I have been mistaken ; and will thank you to have the kindness to put me in the way of raising the money as soon as may be . "
208375	208378	208372	208373	Mr. Draper	1246	" Hm ! "
208388	208398	208400	208401	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Why , sir , it can be done ! "
208506	208512	208503	208503	Harry	701	" It can be done ! "
208522	208616	208513	208513	Draper	1246	" It can be done in time , sir ; but it will require a considerable time . To touch the property in England which is yours on Mr. George Warrington 's death , we must have the event proved , the trustees released : and who is to do either ? Lady Esmond Warrington in Virginia , of course , will not allow her son to remain in prison , but we must wait six months before we hear from her . Has your Bristol agent any authority to honour your drafts ? "
208617	208631	208633	208634	Mr. Warrington	694	" He is only authorised to pay me two hundred pounds a year , "
208636	208663	208633	208634	Mr. Warrington	694	" I suppose I have no resource , then , but to apply to my aunt , Madame de Bernstein . She will be my security . "
208664	208686	208688	208689	the lawyer	8710	" Her ladyship will do anything for you , sir ; she has said so to me , often and often , "
208691	208710	208688	208689	the lawyer	8710	" and , if she gives the word at that moment you can walk out of this place . "
208711	208786	208788	208789	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Go to her , then , from me , Mr. Draper . I did not want to have troubled my relations : but rather than continue in this horrible needless imprisonment , I must speak to her . Say where I am , and what has befallen me . Disguise nothing ! And tell her , that I confide in her affection and kindness for me to release me from this this disgrace , "
208805	208808	208797	208797	he	1246	" Sir , "
208818	208848	208810	208811	Mr. Draper	1246	" I was with her ladyship yesterday , when we talked over the whole of this here most unpleasant I wo n't say as you do , disgraceful business . "
208849	208866	208868	208868	Harry	701	" What do you mean , sir ? Does Madame de Bernstein know of my misfortune ? "
208870	208884	208885	208885	Harry	701	" Every circumstance , sir ; the pawning the watches , and all . "
208890	208910	208912	208913	the lawyer	8710	" It is an unfortunate business , the pawning them watches and things which you had never paid for , "
208934	208965	208915	208917	The young man	2122	" It may lead to litigation and unpleasant remarks being made , in court , sir . Them barristers respect nothing ; and when they get a feller in the box "
208966	208995	208997	208997	Harry	701	" Great Heaven , sir , you do n't suppose a gentleman of my rank ca n't take a watch upon credit without intending to cheat the tradesman ? "
209004	209028	209030	209031	Mr. Draper	1246	" Of course you meant everything that 's honourable ; only , you see , the law may n't happen to think so , "
209037	209069	209034	209034	his	1246	" Hang the supercilious beast ; I touch him there ! Your aunt says it 's the most imprudent thing ever she heard of to call it by no worse name . "
209070	209083	209085	209085	Harry	701	" You call it by no worse name yourself , Mr. Draper ? "
209110	209170	209103	209103	Draper	1246	" Heaven forbid that I should say anything as between gentleman and gentleman , but between me and my client , it 's my duty to say , ' Sir , you are in a very unpleasant scrape , ' just as a doctor would have to tell his patient , ' Sir , you are very ill . ' "
209171	209200	209202	209202	Harry	701	" And you ca n't help me to pay this debt off , and you have come only to tell me that I may be accused of roguery ? "
209204	209302	209202	209202	Harry	701	" Of obtaining goods under false pretences ? Most undoubtedly , yes . I ca n't help it , sir . Do n't look as if you would knock me down . Curse him , I am making him wince , though . A young gentleman , who has only two hundred a year from his ma ' , orders diamonds and watches , and takes 'em to a pawnbroker . You ask me what people will think of such behaviour , and I tell you honestly . Do n't be angry with me , Mr. Warrington . "
209303	209309	209311	209311	Harry	701	" Go on , sir ! "
209326	209396	209317	209318	The lawyer	8710	" But you ask if I ca n't help to pay this debt off ? And I say Yes and that here is the money in my pocket to do it now , if you like not mine , sir , my honoured client 's , your aunt , Lady Bernstein . But she has a right to impose her conditions , and I 've brought 'em with me . "
209397	209403	209405	209406	Mr. Harry	701	" Tell them , sir , "
209408	209479	209405	209406	Mr. Harry	701	" They are not hard . They are only for your own good : and if you say Yes , we can call a hackney - coach , and go to Clarges Street together , which I have promised to go there , whether you will or no . Mr. Warrington , I name no names , but there was a question of marriage between you and a certain party . "
209480	209483	209485	209485	Harry	701	" Ah ! "
209499	209569	209488	209488	his	701	" To that marriage my noble client , the Baroness , is most averse having other views for you , and thinking it will be your ruin to marry a party , of noble birth and title it is true ; but , excuse me , not of first - rate character , and so much older than yourself . You had given an imprudent promise to that party . "
209570	209579	209581	209582	Mr. Warrington	701	" Yes ; and she has it still , "
209584	209599	209601	209602	Mr. Draper	1246	" It has been recovered . She dropped it by an accident at Tunbridge , "
209629	209630	209601	209602	Mr. Draper	1246	" "
209636	209673	209601	209602	Mr. Draper	1246	" cries Harry , turning almost as red as the ink which he had used to write his absurd promise , of which the madness and folly had smote him with shame a thousand times over . "
209693	209698	209699	209699	You	19663	" continues the lawyer . "
209901	209957	209962	209962	your	19663	" So far Mr. Draper had had the best of the talk . Harry only longed himself to be rid of the engagement from which his aunt wanted to free him . His foolish flame for Maria Esmond had died out long since . If she would release him , how thankful would he be ! "
209969	209979	209962	209962	your	19663	" says the lawyer , with a knowing wink . "
210019	210057	210013	210014	Captain Macheath	1385	" The lawyer 's familiarity disgusted Harry , who shrank from Draper , scarcely knowing that he did so . He folded his dressing gown round him , and stepped back from the other 's proffered hand . "
210076	210080	210073	210074	Mr. Draper	1246	" he said , "
210094	210105	210107	210108	the lawyer	8710	" Very good , sir , very good , sir ! "
210127	210180	210182	210182	he	8710	" Most parties would not want an hour to consider about such an offer as I make you : but I suppose my time must be yours , and I 'll come again , and see whether you are to go or to stay . Good morning , sir , good morning : "
210193	210226	210182	210182	he	8710	" Wo n't take my hand , wo n't he ? Will tell me in an hour 's time ! Hang his impudence ! I 'll show him what an hour is ! "
210316	210330	210332	210332	Draper	1246	" He 'll be at home when I call , the haughty beast ! "
210338	210346	210347	210348	the lawyer	8710	" The Fortunate Youth in his room ? "
210369	210377	210379	210380	the gentleman	3435	" Mr. Warrington is in his apartment , "
210382	210384	210379	210380	the gentleman	3435	" but "
210402	210411	210413	210414	the lawyer	8710	" But what , Mr. Paddy from Cork ? "
210416	210443	210445	210446	the janitor	10819	" My name is Costigan ; me familee is noble , and me neetive place is the Irish methrawpolis , Mr. Six - and - eightpence ! "
210474	210484	210487	210488	Mr. Draper	1246	" Confound you , sir , let me pass ! "
210490	210598	210487	210488	Mr. Draper	1246	" I can hear you perfectly well , Six - and - eightpence , except your h 's , which you dthrop out of your conversation . I 'll thank ye not to call neems , me good friend , or me fingers and your nose will have to make an intimate hic - quaintance . Walk in , sir ! Be polite for the future to your shupariors in birth and manners , though they may be your infariors in temporary station . Confound the kay ! Walk in , sir , I say ! Madam , I have the honour of saluting ye most respectfully ! "
210674	210695	210663	210663	his	8710	" Keep your own distance , if you plaise ! This way , madam ! I at once recognised your ladysh "
210842	210845	210827	210827	she	10826	" Mr. Draper "
210862	210868	210869	210869	she	2505	" Where is the boy ? "
210873	210890	210869	210869	she	2505	" I told you to bring him , sir ! How dare you come without him ? "
210891	210907	210909	210909	Draper	1246	" It is not my fault , madam , that Mr. Warrington refuses to come . "
211028	211037	211039	211039	Harry	701	" An hour hence will do as well , "
211191	211198	211199	211199	he	701	" Had they come to Virginia , "
211202	211211	211199	211199	he	701	" I had given them a different welcome ! "
211325	211342	211343	211343	He	701	" Oh , my Harry ! Did I ever , ever think to see thee here ? "
211407	211417	211419	211420	poor Harry	701	" I I thought none of you would come ! "
211455	211475	211476	211476	she	2586	" Oh , my dear ! my dear ! I can not bear to think of thee in misery , "
211524	211539	211540	211540	she	2586	" Some of the debts , I fear , were owing to my extravagance ! "
211547	211601	211540	211540	she	2586	" You bought trinkets and jewels in order to give me pleasure . Oh , how I hate them now ! I little thought I ever could ! I have brought them all with me , and more trinkets here ! and here ! and all the money I have in the world ! "
211637	211643	211644	211644	he	701	" Dearest , kindest cousin ! "
212004	212011	212013	212014	the attorney	8717	" Your humble servant , sir , "
212032	212043	212044	212044	he	8717	" I had expected you some hours ago , sir , "
212048	212061	212063	212064	Mr. Draper	1246	" A lawyer 's time is not always his own , sir , "
212081	212154	212063	212064	Mr. Draper	1246	" Never mind , I 'm at your orders now . Presume it 's all right , Mr. Warrington . Packed your trunk ? Why , now there you are in your bedgown still . Let me go down and settle whilst you call in your black man and titivate a bit . I 've a coach at the door , and we 'll be off and dine with the old lady . "
212155	212169	212225	212225	he	1246	" Are you going to dine with the Baroness de Bernstein , pray ? "
212170	212198	212063	212064	Mr. Draper	1246	" Not me no such honour . Had my dinner already . It 's you are a - going to dine with your aunt , I suppose ? "
212199	212213	212215	212216	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Mr. Draper , you suppose a great deal more than you know , "
212235	212246	212248	212248	Draper	1246	" Great goodness , sir , what do you mean ? "
212250	212284	212248	212248	Draper	1246	" I mean , sir , that I have considered , and , that having given my word to a faithful and honourable lady , it does not become me to withdraw it . "
212285	212291	212293	212294	the lawyer	8710	" Confound it , sir ! "
212296	212321	212293	212294	the lawyer	8710	" I tell you she has lost the paper . There 's nothing to bind you nothing . Why she 's old enough to be "
212322	212327	212329	212330	Mr. Warrington	1246	" Enough , sir , "
212339	212371	212336	212336	his	1246	" You seem to think you are talking to some other pettifogger . I take it , Mr. Draper , you are not accustomed to have dealings with men of honour . "
212372	212377	212379	212379	Draper	1246	" Pettifogger , indeed ! "
212384	212467	212379	212379	Draper	1246	" Men of honour , indeed ! I 'd have you to know , Mr. Warrington , that I 'm as good a man of honour as you . I do n't know so many gamblers and horse - jockeys , perhaps . I have n't gambled away my patrimony , and lived as if I was a nobleman on two hundred a year . I have n't bought watches on credit , and pawned touch me if you dare , sir , "
212476	212498	212500	212501	Mr. Warrington	1246	" That is the way out , sir . You ca n't go through the window , because it is barred , "
212503	212517	212520	212520	Draper	1246	" And the answer I take to my client is No , then ! "
212532	212539	212540	212540	he	701	" If you utter another word , "
212543	212546	212540	212540	he	701	" I 'll "
212596	212609	212611	212611	Harry	701	" What ? Shall she trust me , and I desert her ? "
212626	212649	212650	212651	Her lawyer	10872	" Dear , faithful , generous woman ! If I lie in prison for years , I 'll be true to her . "
212728	212734	212735	212735	he	2270	" It is eight o'clock , "
212738	212754	212735	212735	he	2270	" You have had nothing all day . It is good for you to eat . "
212818	212822	212795	212797	the old servant	10880	" Mr. WARRINGTON ! "
212845	212856	212857	212857	she	5694	" So you are come , sir , are you ? "
212866	212872	212857	212857	she	5694	" Bring back the Ah ! "
212877	212885	212874	212874	she	5694	" Gracious God , who is it ? "
212954	212962	212963	212963	he	10885	" You expected my brother , madam ? "
212965	213010	212963	212963	he	10885	" I am but now arrived in London . I went to his house . I met his servant at your door , who was bearing this letter for you . I thought I would bring it to your ladyship before going to him , "
213022	213025	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" Are you "
213030	213040	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" are you my nephew , that we supposed was "
213041	213067	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" Was killed and is alive ! I am George Warrington , madam and I ask his kinsfolk what have you done with my brother ? "
213068	213073	213075	213078	the bewildered old lady	10891	" Look , George ! "
213079	213127	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" I expected him here to - night that chair was set for him I have been waiting for him , sir , till now till I am quite faint I do n't like I do n't like being alone . Do stay an sup with me ! "
213128	213145	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" Pardon me , madam . Please God , my supper will be with Harry tonight ! "
213146	213178	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" Bring him back . Bring him back here on any conditions ! It is but five hundred pounds ! Here is the money , sir , if you need it ! "
213179	213205	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" I have no want , madam . I have money with me that ca n't be better employed than in my brother 's service . "
213206	213225	213028	213029	the Baroness	2319	" And you will bring him to me , sir ! Say you will bring him to me ! "
214147	214157	214158	214158	he	694	" She does feel my poor Harry 's misfortune , "
214163	214173	214158	214158	he	694	" I have been too hasty in judging her . "
214475	214485	214487	214489	the stout gentleman	8857	" We are not angry any more , Harry ! "
214510	214561	214563	214563	he	8857	" Thank God , my boy ! Mr. Amos here says , there will be no difficulty about James and me being your bail , and we will do your business by breakfast - time in the morning . Why ... Angels and ministers of grace ! who are you ? "
214585	214592	214593	214593	he	2114	" God bless you , sir ! "
214596	214671	214673	214674	the lad	2434	" I know who you are . You must be Colonel Lambert , of whose kindness to him my poor Harry wrote . And I am the brother whom you have heard of , sir ; and who was left for dead in Mr. Braddock 's action ; and came to life again after eighteen months amongst the French ; and live to thank God and thank you for your kindness to my Harry , "
214680	214689	214691	214692	Mr. Lambert	1000	" James ! James ! Here is news ! "
214705	214732	214691	214692	Mr. Lambert	1000	" Here are the dead come alive ! Here is Harry Scapegrace 's brother come back , and with his scalp on his head , too ! "
214747	214796	214733	214733	George	694	" This is my brother - bail , Mr. Warrington ! This is Lieutenant - Colonel James Wolfe , at your service . You must know there has been a little difference between Harry and me , Mr. George . He is pacified , is he , James ? "
214797	214804	214806	214807	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" He is full of gratitude , "
214817	214829	214831	214833	the young man	2122	" Harry wrote home about Mr. Wolfe , too , sir , "
214835	214852	214831	214833	the young man	2122	" and I hope my brother 's friends will be so kind as to be mine . "
214853	214886	214733	214733	George	694	" I wish he had none other but us , Mr. Warrington . Poor Harry 's fine folks have been too fine for him , and have ended by landing him here . "
214887	214957	214959	214959	Harry	681	" Nay , your honours , I have done my best to make the young gentleman comfortable ; and , knowing your honour before , when you came to bail Captain Watkins , and that your security is perfectly good , if your honour wishes , the young gentleman can go out this very night , and I will make it all right with the lawyer in the morning , "
214984	214997	214999	215000	Mr. Warrington	694	" The debt is five hundred and odd pounds , I think ? "
215002	215073	214999	215000	Mr. Warrington	694	" With a hundred thanks to these gentlemen , I can pay the amount at this moment into the officers ' hands , taking the usual acknowledgment and caution . But I can never forget , gentlemen , that you helped my brother at his need , and , for doing so , I say thank you , and God bless you , in my mother 's name and mine . "
215277	215286	215288	215289	the Colonel	19708	" For you were wrong , Mr. Warrington , "
215291	215478	215288	215289	the Colonel	19708	" and you would n't be set right ; and you , a young man , used hard words and unkind behaviour to your senior , and what is more , one of the best gentlemen who walks God 's earth . You see , sir , what his answer hath been to your wayward temper . You will bear with a friend who speaks frankly with you ? Martin Lambert hath acted in this as he always doth , as the best Christian , the best friend , the most kind and generous of men . Nay , if you want another proof of his goodness , here it is : He has converted me , who , as I do n't care to disguise , was angry with you for your treatment of him , and has absolutely brought me down here to be your bail . Let us both cry Peccavimus ! Harry , and shake our friend by the hand ! He is sitting in the room below . He would not come here till he knew how you would receive him . "
215479	215488	215491	215491	Harry	681	" I think he is a good man ! "
215493	215570	215491	215491	Harry	681	" I was very angry and wild at the time when he and I met last , Colonel Wolfe . Nay , perhaps he was right in sending back those trinkets , hurt as I was at his doing so . Go down to him , will you be so kind , sir ? and tell him I am sorry , and ask his pardon , and and , God bless him for his generous behaviour . "
215589	215598	215600	215601	the Colonel	19708	" Tell him all this thyself , Harry ! "
215610	215626	215600	215601	the Colonel	19708	" No deputy will ever say it half so well . Come with me now . "
215627	215680	215683	215683	Harry	681	" You go first , and I 'll I 'll follow , on my word I will . See ! I am in my morning - gown ! I will but put on a coat and come to him . Give him my message first . Just just prepare him for me ! "
215775	215793	215758	215758	himself	689	" What , Gum ? What has happened to thee ? Hast thou got a new sweetheart ? "
215806	215818	215819	215819	Gum	1393	" Give me my coat . What has brought thee back ? "
215823	215832	215833	215833	he	1393	" I have seen a ghost , mas'r ! "
215836	215846	215833	215833	he	1393	" A ghost ! and whose , and where ? "
215847	215873	215880	215880	he	689	" Whar ? Saw him at Madame Bernstein 's house . Come with him here in the coach ! He downstairs now with Colonel Lambert ! "
215909	215914	215916	215916	Harry	681	" Ghost what ghost ? "
215923	215931	215916	215916	Harry	681	" Is anybody is my mother come ? "
215932	215942	215943	215943	Gumbo	689	" No , sir ; no , Master Harry ! "
216001	216025	215974	215974	He	689	" and for doing so , I say thank you , and God bless you , in my mother 's name and mine . "
216026	216032	216035	216036	Harry Warrington	701	" Whose voice is that ? "
216047	216056	216058	216058	Gumbo	689	" It 's the ghost 's , mas'r ! "
216129	216145	216147	216148	the Colonel	19708	" Come away , James ! I think we are not wanted any more here , "
216150	216189	216147	216148	the Colonel	19708	" Good - night , boys . Some ladies in Hill Street wo n't be able to sleep for this strange news . Or will you go home and sup with 'em , and tell them the story ? "
216216	216232	216207	216207	They	2252	" Quick , Gumbo , with the trunks ! Good - bye , Mr. Amos ! "
216521	216530	216499	216504	the first man in the parish	11034	" Have mercy upon us , miserable sinners , "
217117	217131	217108	217108	he	11084	" Sir Miles for ever ! Throw us a halfpenny , my lady ! "
217241	217244	217250	217251	the clerk	4931	" Amen ! "
217624	217634	217637	217638	Lady Warrington	1382	" And to think of his deceiving us so ! "
217640	217650	217652	217653	Sir Miles	770	" Very sad , very sad , my dear ! "
217659	217671	217673	217674	Lady Warrington	1382	" To think of so much extravagance in one so young ! "
217676	217720	217673	217674	Lady Warrington	1382	" Cards , bets , feasts at taverns of the most wicked profusion , carriage and riding horses , the company of the wealthy and profligate of his own sex , and , I fear , of the most iniquitous persons of ours . "
217721	217728	217730	217731	her husband	2866	" Hush , my Lady Warrington ! "
217757	217767	217768	217768	mamma	19850	" No wonder my poor children hide their faces ! "
217771	217789	217768	217768	mamma	19850	" My dears , I wish even the existence of such creatures could be kept from you ! "
217790	217811	217813	217814	Sir Miles	770	" They ca n't go to an opera , or the park , without seeing 'em , to be sure , "
217816	217846	217848	217848	she	19850	" To think we should have introduced such a young serpent into the bosom of our family ! and have left him in the company of that guileless darling ! "
217854	217862	217848	217848	she	19850	" Who 's a serpent , mamma ? "
217867	217894	217848	217848	she	19850	" First you said cousin Harry was bad : then he was good : now he is bad again . Which is he , Sir Miles ? "
217895	217924	217848	217848	she	19850	" He has faults , like all of us , Miley , my dear . Your cousin has been wild , and you must take warning by him . "
217925	217989	217848	217848	she	19850	" Was not my elder brother , who died my naughty brother was not he wild too ? He was not kind to me when I was quite a little boy . He never gave me money , nor toys , nor rode with me , nor why do you cry , mamma ? Sure I remember how Hugh and you were always fight "
217990	217995	217998	217998	papa	19857	" Silence , sir ! "
218006	218019	217998	217998	papa	19857	" Do n't you know you are never to mention that name ? "
218020	218034	218036	218039	the sturdy little rebel	11136	" I know I love Harry , and I did n't love Hugh , "
218041	218098	218036	218039	the sturdy little rebel	11136	" And if cousin Harry is in prison , I 'll give him my half - guinea that my godpapa gave me , and anything I have yes , anything , except except my little horse and my silver waistcoat and and Snowball and Sweetlips at home and and , yes , my custard after dinner . "
218110	218120	218122	218122	Miles	770	" But I 'd give him some of it , "
218128	218144	218146	218146	papa	19857	" Shut thy mouth with it , child , and then go about thy business , "
218161	218173	218174	218174	mamma	894	" Who would have thought he should ever be so wild ? "
218178	218192	218174	218174	mamma	894	" Nay . Youth is the season for wild oats , my dear . "
218193	218203	218205	218206	the girls	2275	" That we should be so misled in him ! "
218208	218216	218218	218218	papa	19857	" That he should kiss us both ! "
218220	218235	218237	218239	the majestic matron	11140	" Sir Miles Warrington , I have no patience with that sort of vulgarity ! "
218241	218252	218254	218255	the father	2841	" Which of you was the favourite yesterday , girls ? "
218257	218288	218290	218292	the handsome sister	11142	" Favourite , indeed ! I told him over and over again of my engagement to dear Tom I did , Dora why do you sneer , if you please ? "
218294	218307	218309	218309	papa	19857	" Nay , to do her justice , so did Dora too , "
218311	218326	218328	218329	the sister	11144	" Because Flora seemed to wish to forget her engagement with dear Tom sometimes , "
218331	218406	218408	218408	Flora	1369	" I never , never , never wished to break with Tom ! It 's wicked of you to say so , Dora ! It is you who were for ever sneering at him : it is you who are always envious because I happen at least , because gentlemen imagine that I am not ill - looking , and prefer me to some folks , in spite of all their learning and wit ! "
218423	218433	218435	218438	the artless Miles junior	11145	" Why are you always looking there , sister ? "
218440	218451	218435	218438	the artless Miles junior	11145	" Sure , you must know your face well enough ! "
218452	218472	218474	218474	papa	19857	" Some people look at it just as often , child , who have n't near such good reason , "
218478	218491	218493	218493	Dora	987	" If you mean me , Sir Miles , I thank you , "
218495	218573	218493	218493	Dora	987	" My face is as Heaven made it , and my father and mother gave it me . ' Tis not my fault if I resemble my papa 's family . If my head is homely , at least I have got some brains in it . I envious of Flora , indeed , because she has found favour in the sight of poor Tom Claypool ! I should as soon be proud of captivating a ploughboy ! "
218574	218602	218604	218604	Flora	1369	" Pray , miss , was your Mr. Harry , of Virginia , much wiser than Tom Claypool ? You would have had him for the asking ! "
218606	218623	218625	218625	Dora	987	" And so would you , miss , and have dropped Tom Claypool into the sea ! "
218627	218632	218625	218625	Dora	987	" I would n't . "
218633	218637	218645	218646	da capo	11147	" You would . "
218638	218643	218645	218646	da capo	11147	" I would n't ; "
218663	218679	218681	218684	their excellent female parent	11150	" Oh , my children ! Is this the way you dwell together in unity ? "
218691	218701	218681	218684	their excellent female parent	11150	" What an example you set to this Innocent ! "
218702	218712	218714	218715	the Innocent	11151	" Like to see 'em fight , my lady ! "
218721	218740	218742	218743	facetious papa	11152	" At her , Flora ! Worry her , Dora ! To it again , you little rogues ! "
218745	218757	218742	218743	facetious papa	11152	" ' Tis good sport , ai n't it , Miley ? "
218758	218782	218784	218784	mamma	19850	" Oh , Sir Miles ! Oh , my children ! These disputes are unseemly . They tear a fond mother 's heart , "
218802	218961	218784	218784	mamma	19850	" What cause for thankfulness ought we to have that watchful parents have prevented any idle engagements between you and your misguided cousin . If we have been mistaken in him , is it not a mercy that we have found out our error in time ? If either of you had any preference for him , your excellent good sense , my loves , will teach you to overcome , to eradicate , the vain feeling . That we cherished and were kind to him can never be a source of regret . ' Tis a proof of our good - nature . What we have to regret , I fear , is , that your cousin should have proved unworthy of our kindness , and , coming away from the society of gamblers , play - actors , and the like , should have brought contamination pollution , I had almost said into this pure family ! "
218962	218970	218972	218972	Flora	1369	" Oh , bother mamma 's sermons ! "
219049	219059	219060	219060	she	1382	" Were you listening to me , my child ? "
219072	219077	219079	219079	he	770	" Yes , mother , "
219097	219132	219079	219079	he	770	" You was a - saying that Harry was very poor now , and that we ought n't to help him . That 's what you was saying ; was n't it , madam ? "
219133	219148	219150	219150	mamma	19850	" My poor child , thou wilt understand me better when thou art older ! "
219164	219172	219174	219177	one of the sisters	11162	" Get out , you little wretch ! "
219243	219254	219256	219257	Sir Miles	770	" Here 's a pretty business , my Lady Warrington ! "
219259	219270	219256	219257	Sir Miles	770	" Here 's a wonderful wonder of wonders , girls ! "
219271	219284	219286	219288	the virtuous matron	11168	" For goodness ' sake , gentlemen , what is your intelligence ? "
219290	219302	219304	219305	Tom Claypool	1368	" The whole town 's talking about it , my lady ! "
219310	219316	219304	219305	Tom Claypool	1368	" Tom has seen him , "
219321	219387	219304	219305	Tom Claypool	1368	" Seen both of them , my Lady Warrington . They were at Ranelagh last night , with a regular mob after 'em . And so like , that but for their different ribbons you would hardly have told one from the other . One was in blue , the other in brown ; but I 'm certain he has worn both the suits here . "
219388	219392	219402	219403	the girls	2275	" What suits ? "
219393	219400	219402	219403	the girls	2275	" What one , what other ? "
219405	219416	219402	219403	the girls	2275	" Why , your fortunate youth , to be sure . "
219417	219428	219430	219431	Sir Miles	770	" Our precious Virginian , and heir to the principality ! "
219433	219445	219447	219448	her ladyship	19678	" Is my nephew , then , released from his incarceration ? "
219450	219461	219447	219448	her ladyship	19678	" And is he again plunged in the vortex of dissip "
219462	219466	219469	219470	the Baronet	770	" Confound him ! "
219482	219515	219469	219470	the Baronet	770	" What should you think , my Lady Warrington , if this precious nephew of mine should turn out to be an impostor ; by George ! no better than an adventurer ? "
219516	219525	219527	219528	the lady	2586	" An inward monitor whispered me as much ! "
219530	219555	219527	219528	the lady	2586	" but I dashed from me the unworthy suspicion . Speak , Sir Miles , we burn with impatience to listen to your intelligence . "
219556	219569	219571	219572	Sir Miles	770	" I 'll speak , my love , when you 've done , "
219574	219606	219571	219572	Sir Miles	770	" Well , what do you think of my gentleman , who comes into my house , dines at my table , is treated as one of this family , kisses my "
219607	219610	219612	219613	Tom Claypool	1368	" What ? "
219622	219679	219612	219613	Tom Claypool	1368	" Hem ! Kisses my wife 's hand , and is treated in the fondest manner , by George ! What do you think of this fellow , who talks of his property and his principality , by Jupiter ! turning out to be a beggarly SECOND SON ! A beggar , my Lady Warrington , by "
219680	219731	219732	219733	the matron	7970	" Sir Miles Warrington , no violence of language before these dear ones ! I sink to the earth , confounded by this unutterable hypocrisy . And did I entrust thee to a pretender , my blessed boy ? Did I leave thee with an impostor , my innocent one ? "
219740	219749	219751	219752	the child	2787	" Who 's an impostor , my lady ? "
219754	219764	219732	219733	the matron	7970	" That confounded young scamp of a Harry Warrington ! "
219833	219842	219830	219831	the butler	2473	" Mr. George Warrington , Mr. Henry Warrington ! "
219897	219913	219915	219915	he	1400	" Oh , Harry ! No ! which is Harry ? You 're my Harry , "
219921	219944	219890	219890	He	1400	" Oh , you dear Harry ! I 'm so glad you are come ! and they 've been abusing you so ! "
219945	219957	219959	219964	the dark - haired Mr. Warrington	701	" I am come to pay my duty to my uncle , "
219966	219979	219959	219964	the dark - haired Mr. Warrington	701	" and to thank him for his hospitalities to my brother Henry . "
219980	220003	220016	220016	his	11186	" What , nephew George ? My brother 's face and eyes ! Boys both , I am delighted to see you ! "
220023	220037	220039	220040	Lady Warrington	1382	" This indeed hath been a most mysterious and a most providential resuscitation , "
220042	220056	220057	220057	she	1382	" Only I wonder that my nephew Henry concealed the circumstance until now , "
220069	220079	220081	220082	Mr. Warrington	701	" He knew it no more than your ladyship , "
220095	220105	220107	220107	mamma	19850	" Indeed , sir ! a most singular circumstance , "
220113	220151	220107	220107	mamma	19850	" We had heard of it , sir ; and Mr. Claypool , our county neighbour , had just brought us the intelligence , and it even now formed the subject of my conversation with my daughters . "
220152	220155	220081	220082	Mr. Warrington	701	" Yes , "
220162	220179	220081	220082	Mr. Warrington	701	" and do you know , Harry , father and mother said you was a a imp "
220180	220213	220107	220107	mamma	19850	" Silence , my child ! Screwby , convey Master Warrington to his own apartment ! These , Mr. Warrington or , I suppose I should say nephew George are your cousins . "
220262	220299	220259	220259	He	701	" It is my duty , madam , to pay my respects to my uncle and cousins , and to thank your ladyship for such hospitality as you have been enabled to show to my brother . "
220300	220317	220319	220322	the hearty Sir Miles	770	" It was not much , nephew , but it was our best . Ods bobs ! "
220324	220330	220319	220322	the hearty Sir Miles	770	" it was our best ! "
220331	220339	220341	220342	Mr. Warrington	701	" And I appreciate it , sir , "
220351	220362	220364	220365	Sir Miles	770	" Give us thy hand . Not a word more , "
220366	220451	220319	220322	the hearty Sir Miles	770	" What ? do you think I 'm a cannibal , and wo n't extend the hand of hospitality to my dear brother 's son ? What say you , lads ? Will you eat our mutton at three ? This is my neighbour , Tom Claypool , son to Sir Thomas Claypool , Baronet , and my very good friend . Hey , Tom ! Thou wilt be of the party , Tom ? Thou knowest our brew , hey , my boy ? "
220452	220462	220464	220464	Tom	1402	" Yes , I know it , Sir Miles , "
220476	220515	220464	220464	Tom	1402	" And thou shalt taste it , my boy , thou shalt taste it ! What is there for dinner , my Lady Warrington ? Our food is plain , but plenty , lads plain , but plenty ! "
220516	220557	220319	220322	the hearty Sir Miles	770	" We can not partake of it to - day , sir . We dine with a friend who occupies my Lord Wrotham 's house , your neighbour . Colonel Lambert Major - General Lambert he has just been made . "
220558	220573	220575	220575	Flora	1369	" With two daughters , I think countrified - looking girls are they not ? "
220577	220589	220591	220591	Dora	987	" I think I have remarked two little rather dowdy things , "
220593	220604	220607	220607	Harry	1368	" They are as good girls as any in England ! "
220645	220652	220654	220654	Dora	987	" Oh , indeed , cousin ! "
220689	220757	220654	220654	Dora	987	" Oh , indeed , cousin ! You are very charitable or very lucky , I 'm sure ! You see angels where we only see ordinary little persons . I 'm sure I could not imagine who were those odd - looking people in Lord Wrotham 's coach , with his handsome liveries . But if they were three angels , I have nothing to say . "
220758	220765	220767	220767	George	694	" My brother is an enthusiast , "
220769	220777	220767	220767	George	694	" He is often mistaken about women . "
220778	220783	220785	220785	Dora	987	" Oh , really ! "
220792	220809	220810	220811	the matron	7970	" I fear my nephew Henry has indeed met with some unfavourable specimens of our sex , "
220818	220841	220810	220811	the matron	7970	" We are so easily taken in , madam we are both very young yet we shall grow older and learn better . "
220842	220892	220767	220767	George	694	" Most sincerely , nephew George , I trust you may . You have my best wishes , my prayers , for your brother 's welfare and your own . No efforts of ours have been wanting . At a painful moment , to which I will not further allude "
220893	220905	220907	220907	George	694	" And when my uncle Sir Miles was out of town , "
220922	221015	220911	220912	the Baronet	23879	" I sent your brother a work which I thought might comfort him , and I know might improve him . Nay , do not thank me ; I claim no credit ; I did but my duty a humble woman 's duty for what are this world 's goods , nephew , compared to the welfare of a soul ? If I did good , I am thankful ; if I was useful , I rejoice . If , through my means , you have been brought , Harry , to consider "
221016	221025	221029	221029	Harry	1368	" Oh ! the sermon , is it ? "
221031	221067	221029	221029	Harry	1368	" I had n't time to read a single syllable of it , aunt thank you . You see I do n't care much about that kind of thing but thank you all the same . "
221068	221074	221076	221077	Mr. Warrington	694	" The intention is everything , "
221079	221162	221076	221077	Mr. Warrington	694	" and we are both grateful . Our dear friend , General Lambert , intended to give bail for Harry ; but , happily , I had funds of Harry 's with me to meet any demands upon us . But the kindness is the same , and I am grateful to the friend who hastened to my brother 's rescue when he had most need of aid , and when his own relations happened so unfortunately to be out of town . "
221163	221197	221199	221200	Sir Miles	770	" Anything I could do , my dear boy , I 'm sure my brother 's son my own nephew ods bobs ! you know that is , anything anything , you know ! "
221214	221266	221199	221200	Sir Miles	770	" You ca n't stay and dine with us ? Put off the Colonel the General do , now ! Or name a day . My Lady Warrington , make my nephew name a day when he will sit under his grandfather 's picture , and drink some of his wine ! "
221267	221282	221284	221285	my lady	19701	" His intellectual faculties seem more developed than those of his unlucky younger brother , "
221296	221364	221284	221285	my lady	19701	" The younger must be reckless and extravagant about money indeed , for did you remark , Sir Miles , the loss of his reversion in Virginia the amount of which has , no doubt , been grossly exaggerated , but , nevertheless , must be something considerable did you , I say , remark that the ruin of Harry 's prospects scarcely seemed to affect him ? "
221365	221387	221389	221389	Dora	987	" I should n't be at all surprised that the elder turns out to be as poor as the young one , "
221395	221435	221389	221389	Dora	987	" He ! he ! Did you see that cousin George had one of cousin Harry 's suits of clothes on the brown and gold that one he wore when he went with you to the oratorio , Flora ? "
221436	221445	221447	221448	Mr. Claypool	1368	" Did he take Flora to an oratorio ? "
221452	221468	221470	221470	Dora	987	" I was ill and could n't go , and my cousin went with her , "
221472	221498	221500	221500	mamma	19850	" Far be it from me to object to any innocent amusement , much less to the music of Mr. Handel , dear Mr. Claypool , "
221502	221566	221500	221500	mamma	19850	" Music refines the soul , elevates the understanding , is heard in our churches , and ' tis well known was practised by King David . Your operas I shun as deleterious ; your ballets I would forbid to my children as most immoral ; but music , my dears ! May we enjoy it , like everything else in reason may we "
221567	221578	221580	221580	papa	19857	" There 's the music of the dinner - bell , "
221586	221605	221580	221580	papa	19857	" Come , girls . Screwby , go and fetch Master Miley . Tom take down my lady . "
221606	221624	221626	221626	Virtue	1403	" Nay , dear Thomas , I walk but slowly . Go you with dearest Flora downstairs , "
221862	222013	222015	222017	the fond wife	21767	" Never mind his rebeldom of the other day ; never mind about his being angry that his presents were returned of course anybody would be angry , much more such a high - spirited lad as Harry ! Never mind about our being so poor , and wanting all our spare money for the boys at college ; there must be some way of getting him out of the scrape . Did you not get Charles Watkins out of the scrape two years ago ; and did he not pay you back every halfpenny ? Yes ; and you made a whole family happy , blessed be God ! and Mrs. Watkins prays for you and blesses you to this very day , and I think everything has prospered with us since . And I have no doubt it has made you a major - general no earthly doubt , "
222218	222243	222245	222246	the gentleman	3435	" We have had a tiff , and we are making it up ! Do n't tell tales out of school , Mrs. Quiggett ! "
222251	222257	222259	222260	Mrs. Quiggett	1407	" Well , I never ! "
222290	222296	222298	222298	Quiggett	1407	" Well , I never ! "
222325	222330	222333	222334	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Oh , Quiggett ! "
222336	222343	222333	222334	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" what a man that is ! "
222344	222366	222298	222298	Quiggett	1407	" You 've been a - quarrelling , have you , mum , and making it up ? That 's right . "
222367	222440	222333	222334	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Quarrel with him ? He never told a greater story . My General is an angel , Quiggett . I should like to worship him . I should like to fall down at his boots and kiss 'em , I should ! There never was a man so good as my General . What have I done to have such a man ? How dare I have such a good husband ? "
222441	222454	222456	222458	the old cockatoo	11238	" My dear , I think there 's a pair of you , "
222460	222470	222456	222458	the old cockatoo	11238	" and what would you like for your supper ? "
222695	222700	222702	222704	a young gentleman	19832	" This is George , "
222710	222741	222702	222704	a young gentleman	19832	" We have been to Aunt Bernstein . We could n't go to bed , Aunt Lambert , without coming to thank you too . You dear , dear , good "
222846	222877	222879	222879	Harry	701	" We came from Aunt Bernstein 's ; we saw lights here , you see ; we could n't go to sleep without saying good - night to you all , "
222881	222887	222879	222879	Harry	701	" Could we , George ? "
222888	222902	222904	222905	the General	3644	" ' Tis certainly a famous nightcap you have brought us , boys , "
222907	222922	222904	222905	the General	3644	" When are you to come and dine with us ? To - morrow ? "
223105	223405	223101	223102	Mr. George	694	" I remember , at the table of our General , how the little Philadelphia agent , whose wit and shrewdness we had remarked at home , made the very objections to the conduct of the campaign of which its disastrous issue showed the justice . ' Of course , ' says he , ' your Excellency 's troops once before Fort Duquesne , such a weak little place will never be able to resist such a general , such an army , such artillery , as will there be found attacking it . But do you calculate , sir , on the difficulty of reaching the place ? Your Excellency 's march will be through woods almost untrodden , over roads which you will have to make yourself , and your line will be some four miles long . This slender line , having to make its way through the forest , will be subject to endless attacks in front , in rear , in flank , by enemies whom you will never see , and whose constant practice in war is the dexterous laying of ambuscades . ' ' Psha , sir ! ' says the General , ' the savages may frighten your raw American militia ' Thank your Excellency for the compliment , Mr. Washington seems to say , who is sitting at the table , ' but the Indians will never make any impression on his Majesty 's regular troops . ' ' I heartily hope not , sir , ' says Mr. Franklin , with a sigh ; and of course the gentlemen of the General 's family sneered at the postmaster , as at a pert civilian who had no call to be giving his opinion on matters entirely beyond his comprehension . "
223551	223954	223537	223537	themselves	717	" I was with our General with the main body of the troops when the firing began in front of us , and one aide - de - camp after another was sent forwards . At first the enemy 's attack was answered briskly by our own advanced people , and our men huzzaed and cheered with good heart . But very soon our fire grew slacker , whilst from behind every tree and bush round about us came single shots , which laid man after man low . We were marching in orderly line , the skirmishers in front , the colours and two of our small guns in the centre , the baggage well guarded bringing up the rear , and were moving over a ground which was open and clear for a mile or two , and for some half mile in breadth , a thick tangled covert of brushwood and trees on either side of us . After the firing had continued for some brief time in front , it opened from both sides of the environing wood on our advancing column . The men dropped rapidly , the officers in greater number than the men . At first , as I said , these cheered and answered the enemy 's fire , our guns even opening on the wood , and seeming to silence the French in ambuscade there . But the hidden rifle - firing began again . Our men halted , huddled up together , in spite of the shouts and orders of the General and officers to advance , and fired wildly into the brushwood of course making no impression . Those in advance came running back on the main body frightened , and many of them wounded . They reported there were five thousand Frenchmen and a legion of yelling Indian devils in front , who were scalping our people as they fell . We could hear their cries from the wood around as our men dropped under their rifles . There was no inducing the people to go forward now . One aide - de - camp after another was sent forward , and never returned . At last it came to be my turn , and I was sent with a message to Captain Fraser of Halkett 's in front , which he was never to receive nor I to deliver . "
224057	224199	224200	224200	I	0	" One of them , who was half Indian half Frenchman , with mocassins and a white uniform coat and cockade , seeing me prostrate on the ground , turned back and ran towards me , his musket clubbed over his head to dash my brains out and plunder me as I lay . I had my little fusil which my Harry gave me when I went on the campaign ; it had fallen by me and within my reach , luckily : I seized it , and down fell the Frenchman dead at six yards before me . I was saved for that time , but bleeding from my wound and very faint . I swooned almost in trying to load my piece , and it dropped from my hand , and the hand itself sank lifeless to the ground . "
224307	224352	224285	224285	him	21894	" He put his knee upon my chest : with one bloody hand he seized my long hair and lifted my head from the ground , and as he lifted it , he enabled me to see a French officer rapidly advancing behind him . "
224390	224471	224486	224486	Florac	1410	" He started ; ran up to me at the cry , laid his hand on the Indian 's shoulder , and called him to hold . But the savage did not understand French , or choose to understand it . He clutched my hair firmer , and waving his dripping knife round it , motioned to the French lad to leave him to his prey . I could only cry out again and piteously , ' A moi ! ' "
224518	224664	224665	224665	Florac	1410	" My friend looked round him . ' Eh ! ' says he , ' la belle affaire ! Where art thou wounded ? in the leg ? ' He bound my leg tight round with his sash . ' The others will kill thee if they find thee here . Ah , tiens ! Put me on this coat , and this hat with the white cockade . Call out in French if any of our people pass . They will take thee for one of us . Thou art Brunet of the Quebec Volunteers . God guard thee , Brunet ! I must go forward . ' Tis a general debacle , and the whole of your redcoats are on the run , my poor boy . ' Ah , what a rout it was ! What a day of disgrace for England ! "
224906	225102	224890	224890	You	0	" At evening , when the dismal pursuit was over , the faithful fellow came back to me , with a couple of Indians , who had each reeking scalps at their belts , and whom he informed that I was a Frenchman , his brother , who had been wounded early in the day , and must be carried back to the fort . They laid me in one of their blankets , and carried me , groaning , with the trusty Florac by my side . Had he left me , they would assuredly have laid me down , plundered me , and added my hair to that of the wretches whose bleeding spoils hung at their girdles . He promised them brandy at the fort , if they brought me safely there : I have but a dim recollection of the journey : the anguish of my wound was extreme : I fainted more than once . We came to the end of our march at last . I was taken into the fort , and carried to the officer 's log - house , and laid upon Florac 's own bed . "
225181	225226	225227	225235	The bloody , murderous , red - skinned villains	11302	" As George speaks , one may fancy a thrill of horror running through his sympathising audience . Theo takes Hetty 's hand , and looks at George in a very alarmed manner . Harry strikes his fist upon the table , and cries , "
225251	225252	225253	225253	They	11302	" "
225273	225279	225253	225253	They	11302	" says George , demurely , "
225285	225286	225253	225253	They	11302	" "
225302	225314	225299	225300	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" cries the Colonel , lifting up his wife 's hair . "
225319	225325	225315	225317	The murderous villains	11307	" says Harry , again . "
225336	225337	225332	225332	Hunt	1032	" "
225349	225353	225343	225343	I	0	" George resumed . "
225445	225530	225531	225531	I	0	" My old enemy the ague - fever set in again upon me as I lay here by the river - side . ' Tis a wonder how I ever survived . But for the goodness of a half - breed woman in the fort , who took pity on me , and tended me , I never should have recovered , and my poor Harry would be what he fancied himself yesterday , our grandfather 's heir , our mother 's only son . "
225634	225717	225718	225719	This man	9271	" At the time of my recovery the fort was almost emptied of the garrison . The Indians had retired enriched with British plunder , and the chief part of the French regulars were gone upon expeditions northward . My good Florac had left me upon his service , consigning me to the care of an invalided sergeant . Monsieur de Contrecoeur had accompanied one of these expeditions , leaving an old lieutenant , Museau by name , in command at Duquesne . "
225812	225926	225929	225929	I	0	" Monsieur Museau and I managed to be pretty good friends . If I could be exchanged , or sent home , I told him that my mother would pay liberally for my ransom ; and I suppose this idea excited the cupidity of the commandant , for a trapper coming in the winter , whilst I still lay very ill with fever , Museau consented that I should write home to my mother , but that the letter should be in French , that he should see it , and that I should say I was in the hands of the Indians , and should not be ransomed under ten thousand livres . "
226072	226238	226057	226057	he	11331	" Three weeks , six , twelve , passed . The messenger never returned . The winter came and went , and all our little plantations round the fort , where the French soldiers had cleared corn - ground and planted gardens and peach- and apple - trees down to the Monongahela , were in full blossom . Heaven knows how I crept through the weary time ! When I was pretty well , I made drawings of the soldiers of the garrison , and of the half - breed and her child Museau 's child , and of Museau himself , whom , I am ashamed to say , I flattered outrageously ; and there was an old guitar left in the fort , and I sang to it , and played on it some French airs which I knew , and ingratiated myself as best I could with my gaolers ; and so the weary months passed , but the messenger never returned . "
226350	226410	226421	226421	mamma	894	" A captive pulled down by malady , a ferocious gaoler , and a young woman touched by the prisoner 's misfortunes sure you expect that , with these three prime characters in a piece , some pathetic tragedy is going to be enacted ? You , Miss Hetty , are about to guess that the woman saved me ? "
226411	226419	226421	226421	mamma	894	" Why , of course she did ! "
226423	226431	226433	226433	Hetty	993	" What else is she good for ? "
226435	226457	226433	226433	Hetty	993	" You , Miss Theo , have painted her already as a dark beauty is it not so ? A swift huntress "
226458	226464	226466	226467	the Colonel	19708	" Diana with a baby , "
226469	226511	226466	226467	the Colonel	19708	" Who scours the plain with her nymphs , who brings down the game with her unerring bow , who is queen of the forest and I see by your looks that you think I am madly in love with her ? "
226512	226526	226528	226528	Theo	987	" Well , I suppose she is an interesting creature , Mr. George ? "
226534	226627	226528	226528	Theo	987	" What think you of a dark beauty , the colour of new mahogany with long straight black hair , which was usually dressed with a hair - oil or pomade by no means pleasant to approach , with little eyes , with high cheek - bones , with a flat nose , sometimes ornamented with a ring , with rows of glass beads round her tawny throat , her cheeks and forehead gracefully tattooed , a great love of finery , and inordinate passion for oh ! must I own it ? "
226628	226641	226643	226644	Miss Hetty	993	" For coquetry . I know you are going to say that ! "
226646	226782	226643	226644	Miss Hetty	993	" For whisky , my dear Miss Hester in which appetite my gaoler partook ; so that I have often sate by , on the nights when I was in favour with Monsieur Museau , and seen him and his poor companion hob - and - nobbing together until they could scarce hold the noggin out of which they drank . In these evening entertainments , they would sing , they would dance , they would fondle , they would quarrel , and knock the cans and furniture about ; and , when I was in favour , I was admitted to share their society , for Museau , jealous of his dignity , or not willing that his men should witness his behaviour , would allow none of them to be familiar with him . "
226940	227086	227095	227095	I	0	" Museau was very savage when he began to give up all hopes of the first messenger . He fancied that the man might have got the ransom - money and fled with it himself . Of course he was prepared to disown any part in the transaction , should my letter be discovered . His treatment of me varied according to his hopes or fears , or even his mood for the time being . He would have me consigned to my quarters for several days at a time ; then invite me to his tipsy supper - table , quarrel with me there , and abuse my nation ; or again break out into maudlin sentimentalities about his native country of Normandy , where he longed to spend his old age , to buy a field or two , and to die happy . "
227201	227257	227271	227271	I	0	" ' Ah , young traitor ! ' roars he , ' do you wish to tamper with my honour ? Do you believe an officer of France will take a bribe ? I have a mind to consign thee to my black - hole , and to have thee shot in the morning . ' "
227285	227315	227178	227178	you	1414	" ' And an orchard . Ah , sacre bleu ! ' says Museau , whimpering , ' and a dish of tripe a la mode du pays ! ... "
227316	227369	227178	227178	you	1414	" This talk happened between us again and again , and Museau would order me to my quarters , and then ask me to supper the next night , and return to the subject of Normandy , and cider , and trippes a la mode de Caen . My friend is dead now "
227370	227378	227381	227382	Colonel Lambert	975	" He was hung , I trust ? "
227384	227483	227381	227382	Colonel Lambert	975	" And I need keep no secret about him . Ladies , I wish I had to offer you the account of a dreadful and tragical escape ; how I slew all the sentinels of the fort ; filed through the prison windows , destroyed a score or so of watchful dragons , overcame a million of dangers , and finally effected my freedom . But , in regard of that matter , I have no heroic deeds to tell of , and own that , by bribery and no other means , I am where I am . "
227484	227497	227499	227499	Harry	701	" But you would have fought , Georgy , if need were , "
227501	227514	227499	227499	Harry	701	" and you could n't conquer a whole garrison , you know ! "
227523	227533	227535	227535	Lambert	975	" See the women , how disappointed they are ! "
227537	227570	227535	227535	Lambert	975	" Mrs. Lambert , you bloodthirsty woman , own that you are balked of a battle ; and look at Hetty , quite angry because Mr. George did not shoot the commandant . "
227571	227581	227583	227584	Miss Hetty	993	" You wished he was hung yourself , papa ! "
227586	227598	227583	227584	Miss Hetty	993	" and I am sure I wish anything my papa wishes . "
227599	227604	227606	227606	George	694	" Nay , ladies , "
227613	227693	227606	227606	George	694	" to wink at a prisoner 's escape was not a very monstrous crime ; and to take money ? Sure other folks besides Frenchmen have condescended to a bribe before now . Although Monsieur Museau set me free , I am inclined , for my part , to forgive him . Will it please you to hear how that business was done ? You see , Miss Hetty , I can not help being alive to tell it . "
227694	227719	227721	227721	Hester	993	" Oh , George ! that is , I mean , Mr. Warrington ! that is , I mean , I beg your pardon ! "
227723	227772	227774	227774	George	694	" No pardon , my dear ! I never was angry yet or surprised that any one should like my Harry better than me . He deserves all the liking that any man or woman can give him . See , it is his turn to blush now , "
227776	227792	227794	227794	Harry	701	" Go on , Georgy , and tell them about the escape out of Duquesne ! "
227806	227860	227797	227797	he	701	" You know he is always going on saying that he ought never to have come to life again , and declaring that I am better than he is . The idea of my being better than George , Mrs. Lambert ! a poor , extravagant fellow like me ! It 's absurd ! "
227867	228160	227797	227797	he	701	" We continued for months our weary life at the fort , and the commandant and I had our quarrels and reconciliations , our greasy games at cards , our dismal duets with his asthmatic flute and my cracked guitar . The poor Fawn took her beatings and her cans of liquor as her lord and master chose to administer them ; and she nursed her papoose , or her master in the gout , or her prisoner in the ague ; and so matters went on until the beginning of the fall of last year , when we were visited by a hunter who had important news to deliver to the commandant , and such as set the little garrison in no little excitement . The Marquis de Montcalm had sent a considerable detachment to garrison the forts already in the French hands , and to take up further positions in the enemy 's that is , in the British possessions . The troops had left Quebec and Montreal , and were coming up the St. Lawrence and the lakes in bateaux , with artillery and large provisions of warlike and other stores . Museau would be superseded in his command by an officer of superior rank , who might exchange me , or who might give me up to the Indians in reprisal for cruelties practised by our own people on many and many an officer and soldier of the enemy . The men of the fort were eager for the reinforcements ; they would advance into Pennsylvania and New York ; they would seize upon Albany and Philadelphia ; they would drive the Rosbifs into the sea , and all America should be theirs from the Mississippi to Newfoundland . "
228187	228197	228182	228183	Mr. Museau	1414	" ' Eh , commandant ! ' says I , "
228228	228407	228409	228409	he	11360	" ' Yes ; ' tis all very well , my garcon , ' says he . ' But where will you be when poor old Museau is superseded ? Other officers are not good companions like me . Very few men in the world have my humanity . When there is a great garrison here , will my successors give thee the indulgences which honest Museau has granted thee ? Thou wilt be kept in a sty like a pig ready for killing . As sure as one of our officers falls into the hands of your brigands of frontier - men , and evil comes to him , so surely wilt thou have to pay with thy skin for his . Thou wilt be given up to our red allies to the brethren of La Biche yonder . Didst thou see , last year , what they did to thy countrymen whom we took in the action with Braddock ? Roasting was the very smallest punishment , ma foi was it not , La Biche ? ' "
228473	228565	228460	228461	honest Museau	1414	" La Biche was by no means so affected as you seem to be , ladies , by the recital of these horrors . She had witnessed them in her time . She came from the Senecas , whose villages lie near the great cataract between Ontario and Erie ; her people made war for the English , and against them : they had fought with other tribes ; and , in the battles between us and them , it is difficult to say whether whiteskin or redskin is most savage . "
228606	228622	228593	228593	I	0	" ' Go get the whisky - bottle , La Biche , ' says Museau . "
228707	228741	228814	228815	the commandant	24826	" ' Ah , scelerat ! ' roars out the commandant , with a hoarse yell of laughter . ' Thou hast eyes , thou ! All is good prize in war . ' "
228774	228811	228814	228815	the commandant	24826	" ' And Javotte at the door with her wheel , and a rascal of a child , or two , with cheeks as red as the apples ! O my country ! O my mother ! "
228827	228934	228942	228942	he	11377	" All that night the commandant was deep in thought , and La Biche , too , silent and melancholy . She sate away from us , nursing her child , and whenever my eyes turned towards her I saw hers were fixed on me . The poor little infant began to cry , and was ordered away by Museau , with his usual foul language , to the building which the luckless Biche occupied with her child . When she was gone , we both of us spoke our minds freely ; and I put such reasons before monsieur as his cupidity could not resist . "
228954	229110	228942	228942	he	11377	" ' That is my secret , ' says I. But here , if you like , as we are not on honour , I may tell it . When they come into the settlements for their bargains , the hunters often stop a day or two for rest and drink and company , and our new friend loved all these . He played at cards with the men : he set his furs against their liquor : he enjoyed himself at the fort , singing , dancing , and gambling with them . I think I said they liked to listen to my songs , and for want of better things to do , I was often singing and guitar - scraping : and we would have many a concert , the men joining in chorus , or dancing to my homely music , until it was interrupted by the drums and the retraite . "
229241	229259	229223	229223	I	0	" ' What is it ? ' says the hunter . ' I do n't understand . ' "
229260	229288	229317	229317	he	11331	" Tis a girl to her lover , ' I answered ; but I saw by the twinkle in the man 's eye that he understood me . "
229347	229430	229317	229317	he	11331	" ' If you are ready , ' says he , ' I am ready . I know who your people are , and the way to them . Talk to the Fawn , and she will tell you what to do . What ! You will not play with me ? ' Here he pulled out some cards , and spoke in French as two soldiers came up . ' Milor est trop grand seigneur ? Bonjour , my lord ! ' "
229457	229588	229432	229433	the man	2270	" I knew now that the Biche was to be the agent in the affair , and that my offer to Museau was accepted . The poor Fawn performed her part very faithfully and dexterously . I had not need of a word more with Museau ; the matter was understood between us . The Fawn had long been allowed free communication with me . She had tended me during my wound and in my illnesses , helped to do the work of my little chamber , my cooking , and so forth . She was free to go out of the fort , as I have said , and to the river and the fields whence the corn and garden - stuff of the little garrison were brought in . "
229652	229730	229631	229632	the Fawn	24969	" When first wounded , I had been taken by my kind Florac and placed on his bed in the officers ' room . When the fort was emptied of all officers except the old lieutenant left in command , I had been allowed to remain in my quarters , sometimes being left pretty free , sometimes being locked up and fed on prisoners ' rations , sometimes invited to share his mess by my tipsy gaoler . "
229809	229842	229791	229791	Ohio	71	" ' You see those trees ? ' my poor Biche said to me the day before , in her French jargon . ' He wait for you behind those trees . ' "
229986	230049	229978	229978	she	11409	" On the next day , she comes , pretending to be very angry , and calls out , ' My lord ! my lord ! why you not come to commandant 's dinner ? He very bad ! Entendez - vows ? ' And she peeps into the room as she speaks , and flings a coil of rope at me . "
230097	230177	230090	230090	I	0	" As for Museau , he knew nothing about the matter . Not he ! He growled at me , and said the soup was cold . He looked me steadily in the face , and talked of this and that ; not only whilst his servant was present , but afterwards as we smoked our pipes and played our game at piquet ; whilst according to her wo nt , the poor Biche sate cowering in a corner . "
230248	230347	230348	230348	He	11418	" As he turned his back the Biche raised herself ; and he was no sooner gone but she was at my feet , kissing my hand , pressing it to her heart , and bursting into tears over my knees . I confess I was so troubled by this testimony of the poor creature 's silent attachment and fondness , the extent of which I scarce had suspected before , that when Museau returned , I had not recovered my equanimity , though the poor Fawn was back in her corner again and shrouded in her blanket . "
230385	230411	230421	230421	I	0	" ' I gain everything from you to - night , milor , ' says he , grimly . ' We play upon parole . ' "
230424	230439	230421	230421	I	0	" ' Eh ! ' tis all that you have ! ' says he . "
230464	230564	230573	230573	he	11420	" At last he said he had a headache , and would go to bed , and I understood the orders too , that I was to retire . ' I wish you a good night , mon petit milor , ' says he , ' stay , you will fall without your crutch , ' and his eyes twinkled at me , and his face wore a sarcastic grin . In the agitation of the moment I had quite forgotten that I was lame , and was walking away at a pace as good as a grenadier 's . "
230636	230793	230630	230632	the poor Biche	24995	" The night was so rainy that the sentries preferred their boxes , and did not disturb me in my work . The log - house was built with upright posts , deeply fixed in the ground , and horizontal logs laid upon it . I had to dig under these , and work a hole sufficient to admit my body to pass . I began in the dark , soon after tattoo . It was some while after midnight before my work was done , when I lifted my hand up under the log and felt the rain from without falling upon it . I had to work very cautiously for two hours after that , and then crept through to the parapet and silently flung my rope over the gun ; not without a little tremor of heart , lest the sentry should see me and send a charge of lead into my body . "
230882	230932	230860	230860	I	0	" I made for this mark as swiftly as I could , and for the clump of trees to which I had been directed . Oh , what a relief I had when I heard a low voice humming there , ' Over the hills and far away ' ! "
230977	230981	230982	230983	the speaker	11433	" Our way , "
230987	231082	230982	230983	the speaker	11433	" lay through a level tract of forest with which my guide was familiar , upon the right bank of the Monongahela . By daylight we came to a clearer country , and my trapper asked me Silverheels was the name by which he went had I ever seen the spot before ? It was the fatal field where Braddock had fallen , and whence I had been wonderfully rescued in the summer of the previous year . Now , the leaves were beginning to be tinted with the magnificent hues of our autumn . "
231083	231088	231090	231090	Harry	701	" Ah , brother ! "
231098	231137	231090	231090	Harry	701	" I was gambling and making a fool of myself at the Wells and in London , when my George was flying for his life in the wilderness ! Oh , what a miserable spendthrift I have been ! "
231138	231154	231156	231157	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" But I think thou art not unworthy to be called thy mother 's son , "
231203	231209	231210	231210	George	694	" We presently crossed the river "
231213	231300	231210	231210	George	694	" taking our course along the base of the western slopes of the Alleghanies ; and through a grand forest region of oaks and maple , and enormous poplars that grow a hundred feet high without a branch . It was the Indians whom we had to avoid , besides the outlying parties of French . Always of doubtful loyalty , the savages have been specially against us , since our ill - treatment of them , and the French triumph over us two years ago . "
231485	231538	231552	231553	George Warrington	694	" And hence we descended to Cumberland , whence we had marched in the year before , and where there was now a considerable garrison of our people . Oh ! you may think it was a welcome day when I saw English colours again on the banks of our native Potomac ! "
231793	231808	231810	231811	Madame Bernstein	780	" Very good and most interesting , I am sure , my dear sir , "
231834	231846	231847	231847	George	694	" And your mother must have been delighted to see you . "
231877	231884	231885	231885	she	2597	" Have been delighted to see you "
231889	231962	231885	231885	she	2597	" and killed the fatted calf , and and that kind of thing . Though why I say calf , I do n't know , nephew George , for you never were the prodigal . I may say calf to thee , my poor Harry ! Thou hast been amongst the swine sure enough . And evil companions have robbed the money out of thy pocket and the coat off thy back . "
231973	231981	231963	231963	He	694	" says George , with some heat , "
231990	231991	231992	231992	He	694	" "
232031	232042	232015	232015	she	21422	" said the old lady , tossing up her head . "
232047	232073	232025	232025	she	21422	" she said , at night , as she arranged herself for the rout to which she was going , to her waiting - maid : "
232258	232341	232254	232254	he	708	" Being engaged , then , to a card - party , an amusement which she never missed , week - day or Sabbath , as long as she had strength to hold trumps or sit in a chair , very soon after George had ended his narration the old lady dismissed her two nephews , giving to the elder a couple of fingers and a very stately curtsey ; but to Harry two hands and a kindly pat on the cheek . "
232362	232366	232351	232351	thou	11485	" she said . "
232518	233009	232516	232516	gentlemen	2402	" and she went away to her toilette . Her chairmen and flambeaux were already waiting at the door . The gentlemen went to Ranelagh , where but a few of Mr. Harry 's acquaintances chanced to be present . They paced the round , and met Mr. Tom Claypool with some of his country friends ; they heard the music ; they drank tea in a box ; Harry was master of ceremonies , and introduced his brother to the curiosities of the place ; and George was even more excited than his brother had been on his first introduction to this palace of delight . George loved music much more than Harry ever did ; he heard a full orchestra for the first time , and a piece of Mr. Handel satisfactorily performed ; and a not unpleasing instance of Harry 's humility and regard for his elder brother was , that he could even hold George 's love of music in respect at a time when fiddling was voted effeminate and unmanly in England , and Britons were , every day , called upon by the patriotic prints to sneer at the frivolous accomplishments of your Squallinis , Monsieurs , and the like . Nobody in Britain is proud of his ignorance now . There is no conceit left among us . There is no such thing as dulness . Arrogance is entirely unknown ... Well , at any rate , Art has obtained her letters of naturalisation , and lives here on terms of almost equality . If Mrs. Thrale chose to marry a music - master now , I do n't think her friends would shudder at the mention of her name . If she had a good fortune and kept a good cook , people would even go and dine with her in spite of the misalliance , and actually treat Mr. Piozzi with civility . After Ranelagh , and pursuant to Madam Bernstein 's advice , George returned to her ladyship 's house , whilst Harry showed himself at the club , where gentlemen were accustomed to assemble at night to sup , and then to gamble . No one , of course , alluded to Mr. Warrington 's little temporary absence , and Mr. Ruff , his ex - landlord , waited upon him with the utmost gravity and civility , and as if there had never been any difference between them . Mr. Warrington had caused his trunks and habiliments to be conveyed away from Bond Street in the morning , and he and his brother were now established in apartments elsewhere . But when the supper was done , and the gentlemen , as usual , were about to seek the macco - table upstairs , Harry said he was not going to play any more . He had burned his fingers already , and could afford no more extravagance . "
233012	233023	232516	232516	gentlemen	2402	" says Mr. Morris , in a rather flippant manner , "
233044	233045	233034	233035	Mr. Warrington	701	" "
233065	233084	233062	233063	Mr. Morris	1059	" says Harry sternly , who had not forgotten the other 's behaviour on hearing of his arrest ; "
233126	233159	233165	233166	Mr. Warrington	701	" And he looked round , blushing not a little , to the knot of gentlemen , his gaming associates , who were lounging at the tables or gathered round the fire . "
233168	233174	233165	233166	Mr. Warrington	701	" cries my Lord March , "
233200	233201	233187	233187	I	0	" "
233213	233217	233218	233220	The right owner	11505	" says another . "
233236	233237	233231	233234	my twin elder brother	11507	" "
233272	233273	233274	233274	He	11507	" "
233315	233316	233317	233317	You	11506	" "
233332	233359	233329	233330	Mr. Warrington	1246	" asks Mr. Selwyn very good - naturedly , and simple Harry hardly knew the meaning of his joke until his brother interpreted it to him . "
233381	233404	233329	233330	Mr. Warrington	1246	" cries my Lord March , as they continued to talk of the matter when the young Virginian had taken his leave . "
233421	233425	233405	233406	These savages	11516	" yawns Selwyn . "
233437	233442	233432	233432	they	11516	" simpers Mr. Walpole . "
233473	233474	233475	233476	A man	2438	" "
233485	233499	233475	233476	A man	2438	" says Mr. Selwyn , placidly ranging his money and counters before him . "
233518	233522	233516	233516	George	907	" continues Horry . "
233543	233548	233529	233546	any man in England who would like to see his elder brother alive , " says my lord	25088	" says my lord . "
233559	233564	233556	233557	my lord	2193	" cries Jack Morris . "
233583	233584	233585	233585	I	0	" "
233601	233605	233585	233585	I	0	" continues Jack . "
233653	233663	233630	233632	the Fortunate Youth	22705	" A great laugh ensues at Jack 's phrase of "
233667	233668	233642	233643	the deuce	20088	" "
233680	233684	233685	233687	The young one	24696	" Jack continues . "
233806	233807	233791	233793	this Mr. Warrington	1246	" "
233824	233829	233815	233815	March	1246	" asks a bystander . "
233851	233852	233849	233849	March	1246	" "
233863	234528	233849	233849	March	1246	" says the nobleman addressed : but Jack Morris 's opinion found not a few supporters in the world . Many persons agreed that it was most indecorous of Mr. Harry Warrington to have ever believed in his brother 's death : that there was something suspicious about the young man 's first appearance and subsequent actions , and , in fine , that regarding these foreigners , adventurers , and the like , we ought to be especially cautious . Though he was out of prison and difficulty ; though he had his aunt 's liberal donation of money in his pocket ; though his dearest brother was restored to him , whose return to life Harry never once thought of deploring , as his friends at White 's supposed he would do ; though Maria had shown herself in such a favourable light by her behaviour during his misfortune : yet Harry , when alone , felt himself not particularly cheerful , and smoked his pipe of Virginia with a troubled mind . It was not that he was deposed from his principality ; the loss of it never once vexed him ; he knew that his brother would share with him as he would have done with his brother ; but after all those struggles and doubts in his own mind , to find himself poor , and yet irrevocably bound to his elderly cousin ! Yes , she was elderly , there was no doubt about it . When she came to that horrible den in Cursitor Street and the tears washed her rouge off , why , she looked as old as his mother ! her face was all wrinkled and yellow , and as he thought of her he felt just such a qualm as he had when she was taken ill that day in the coach on their road to Tunbridge . What would his mother say when he brought her home , and , Lord , what battles there would be between them ! He would go and live on one of the plantations the farther from home the better and have a few negroes , and farm as best he might , and hunt a good deal ; but at Castlewood or in her own home , such as he could make it for her , what a life for poor Maria , who had been used to go to court and to cards and balls and assemblies every night ! If he could be but the overseer of the estates oh , he would be an honest factor , and try and make up for his useless life and extravagance in these past days ! Five thousand pounds , all his patrimony and the accumulations of his long minority squandered in six months ! He a beggar , except for dear George 's kindness , with nothing in life left to him but an old wife , a pretty beggar , dressed out in velvet and silver lace forsooth the poor lad was arrayed in his best clothes a pretty figure he had made in Europe , and a nice end he was come to ! With all his fine friends at White 's and Newmarket , with all his extravagance , had he been happy a single day since he had been in Europe ? Yes , three days , four days , yesterday evening , when he had been with dear dear Mrs. Lambert , and those affectionate kind girls , and that brave good Colonel . And the Colonel was right when he rebuked him for his spendthrift follies , and he had been a brute to be angry as he had been , and God bless them all for their generous exertions in his behalf ! Such were the thoughts which Harry put into his pipe , and he smoked them whilst he waited his brother 's return from Madame Bernstein .
234805	234813	234815	234816	George Warrington	694	" And that was a beauty once ! "
234834	234863	234815	234816	George Warrington	694	" and that ruin was a splendid palace . Crowds of lovers have sighed before those decrepit feet , and been bewildered by the brightness of those eyes . "
235062	235070	235072	235074	the old lady	2505	" It would appear by this letter , "
235082	235100	235072	235074	the old lady	2505	" that ever since your return , there have been some differences between you and my sister . "
235101	235116	235117	235117	George	694	" Indeed ? I did not know that Madam Esmond had alluded to them , "
235162	235172	235155	235155	George	694	" RICHMOND , VIRGINIA , December 26th , 1756 . "
235489	235780	235808	235808	George	694	" Your beneficent intentions towards dearest Harry will be more than ever welcome , now he is reduced to a younger brother 's slender portion ! Many years since , an advantageous opportunity occurred of providing for him in this province , and he would by this time have been master of a noble estate and negroes , and have been enabled to make a figure with most here , could his mother 's wishes have been complied with , and his father 's small portion , now lying at small interest in the British funds , have been invested in this most excellent purchase . But the forms of the law , and , I grieve to own , my elder son 's scruples , prevailed , and this admirable opportunity was lost to me ! Harry will find the savings of his income have been carefully accumulated long , long may he live to enjoy them ! May Heaven bless you , dear sister , for what your ladyship may add to his little store ! As I gather from your letter , that the sum which has been allowed to him has not been sufficient for his expenses in the fine company which he has kept and the grandson of the Marquis of Esmond one who had so nearly been his lordship 's heir may sure claim equality with any other nobleman in Great Britain , and having a sum by me which I had always intended for the poor child 's establishment , I entrust it to my eldest son , who , to do him justice , hath a most sincere regard for his brother , to lay it out for Harry 's best advantage . "
235781	235806	235808	235808	George	694	" It took him out of prison yesterday , madam . I think that was the best use to which we could put it , "
235819	235864	235866	235868	the old lady	2505	" Nay , sir , I do n't know any such thing ! Why not have kept it to buy a pair of colours for him , or to help towards another estate and some negroes , if he has a fancy for home ? "
235870	235883	235866	235868	the old lady	2505	" Besides , I had a fancy to pay that debt myself . "
235884	235928	235808	235808	George	694	" I hope you will let his brother do that . I ask leave to be my brother 's banker in this matter , and consider I have borrowed so much from my mother , to be paid back to my dear Harry . "
235929	235991	235993	235993	George	694	" Do you say so , sir ? Give me a glass of wine ! You are an extravagant fellow ! Read on , and you will see your mother thinks so . I drink to your health , nephew George ! ' Tis good Burgundy . Your grandfather never loved Burgundy . He loved claret , the little he drank . "
235999	236172	235993	235993	George	694	" This remittance will , I trust , amply cover any expenses which , owing to the mistake respecting his position , dearest Harry may have incurred . I wish I could trust his elder brother 's prudence as confidently as my Harry 's ! But I fear that , even in his captivity , Mr. Esmond W. has learned little of that humility which becomes all Christians , and which I have ever endeavoured to teach to my children . Should you by chance show him these lines , when , by the blessing of Heaven on those who go down to the sea in ships , the Great Ocean divides us ! he will know that a fond mother 's blessing and prayers follow both her children , and that there is no act I have ever done , no desire I have ever expressed however little he may have been inclined to obey it ! but hath been dictated by the fondest wishes for my dearest boys ' welfare . "
236173	236215	236217	236217	George	694	" There is a scratch with a penknife , and a great blot upon the letter there , as if water had fallen on it . Your mother writes well , George . I suppose you and she had a difference ? "
236224	236231	236233	236235	the young man	2122	" Yes , ma'am , many , "
236239	236700	236233	236235	the young man	2122	" The last was about a question of money of ransom which I promised to the old lieutenant of the fort who aided me to make my escape . I told you he had a mistress , a poor Indian woman , who helped me , and was kind to me . Six weeks after my arrival at home , the poor thing made her appearance at Richmond , having found her way through the wood by pretty much the same track which I had followed , and bringing me the token which Museau had promised to send me when he connived to my flight . A commanding officer and a considerable reinforcement had arrived at Duquesne . Charges , I do n't know of what peculation for his messenger could not express herself very clearly , had been brought against this Museau . He had been put under arrest , and had tried to escape ; but , less fortunate than myself , he had been shot on the rampart , and he sent the Indian woman to me , with my grandfather 's watch , and a line scrawled in his prison on his deathbed , begging me to send ce que je scavais to a notary at Havre de Grace in France to be transmitted to his relatives at Caen in Normandy . My friend Silverheels , the hunter , had helped my poor Indian on her way . I do n't know how she would have escaped scalping else . But at home they received the poor thing sternly . They hardly gave her a welcome . I wo n't say what suspicions they had regarding her and me . The poor wretch fell to drinking whenever she could find means . I ordered that she should have food and shelter , and she became the jest of our negroes , and formed the subject of the scandal and tittle - tattle of the old fools in our little town . Our Governor was , luckily , a man of sense , and I made interest with him , and procured a pass to send her back to her people . Her very grief at parting with me only served to confirm the suspicions against her . A fellow preached against me from the pulpit , I believe ; I had to treat another with a cane . And I had a violent dispute with Madam Esmond a difference which is not healed yet because I insisted upon paying to the heirs Museau pointed out the money I had promised for my deliverance . You see that scandal flourishes at the borders of the wilderness , and in the New World as well as the Old . "
236701	236712	236714	236715	Madame Bernstein	780	" I have suffered from it myself , my dear ! "
236719	236745	236714	236715	Madame Bernstein	780	" Fill thy glass , child ! A little tass of cherry - brandy ! ' Twill do thee all the good in the world . "
236746	236755	236756	236757	Madam Esmond	683	" As for my poor Harry 's marriage , "
236763	236963	236756	236757	Madam Esmond	683	" though I know too well , from sad experience , the dangers to which youth is subject , and would keep my boy , at any price , from them , though I should wish him to marry a person of rank , as becomes his birth , yet my Lady Maria Esmond is out of the question . Her age is almost the same as mine ; and I know my brother Castlewood left his daughters with the very smallest portions . My Harry is so obedient that I know a desire from me will be sufficient to cause him to give up this imprudent match . Some foolish people once supposed that I myself once thought of a second union , and with a person of rank very different from ours . No ! I knew what was due to my children . As succeeding to this estate after me , Mr. Esmond W. is amply provided for . Let my task now be to save for his less fortunate younger brother : and , as I do not love to live quite alone , let him return without delay to his fond and loving mother . "
237214	237257	237210	237211	RACHEL ESMOND	752	" P.S. I have communicated with my Lady Maria ; but there will no need to tell her and dear Harry that his mother or your ladyship hope to be able to increase his small fortune . The match is altogether unsuitable . "
237258	237267	237268	237268	George	694	" As far as regards myself , madam , "
237276	237327	237268	237268	George	694	" my mother 's letter conveys no news to me . I always knew that Harry was the favourite son with Madam Esmond , as he deserves indeed to be . He has a hundred good qualities which I have not the good fortune to possess . He has better looks "
237328	237337	237339	237341	the old lady	2505	" Nay , that is not your fault , "
237348	237369	237339	237341	the old lady	2505	" and , but that he is fair and you are brown , one might almost pass for the other . "
237383	237394	237395	237395	he	694	" His disposition is bright , and mine is dark , "
237398	237433	237395	237395	he	694	" Harry is cheerful , and I am otherwise , perhaps . He knows how to make himself beloved by every one , and it has been my lot to find but few friends . "
237434	237454	237455	237456	the Baroness	2319	" My sister and you have pretty little quarrels . There were such in old days in our family , "
237459	237468	237455	237456	the Baroness	2319	" and if Madam Esmond takes after our mother "
237469	237482	237484	237484	George	694	" My mother has always described hers as an angel upon earth , "
237486	237501	237503	237504	the Baroness	2319	" Eh ! That is a common character for people when they are dead ! "
237506	237599	237503	237504	the Baroness	2319	" and Rachel Castlewood was an angel , if you like at least your grandfather thought so . But let me tell you , sir , that angels are sometimes not very commodes a vivre . It may be they are too good to live with us sinners , and the air down below here do n't agree with them . My poor mother was so perfect that she never could forgive me for being otherwise . Ah , mon Dieu ! how she used to oppress me with those angelical airs ! "
237648	237662	237663	237664	the Baroness	2319	" I quite comprehend you , sir , though you hold your tongue , "
237667	237738	237663	237664	the Baroness	2319	" A sermon in the morning : a sermon at night : and two or three of a Sunday . That is what people call being good . Every pleasure cried fie upon ; all us worldly people excommunicated ; a ball an abomination of desolation ; a play a forbidden pastime ; and a game of cards perdition ! What a life ! Mon Dieu , what a life ! "
237739	237753	237755	237755	George	694	" We played at cards every night , if we were so inclined , "
237759	237784	237755	237755	George	694	" and my grandfather loved Shakspeare so much , that my mother had not a word to say against her father 's favourite author . "
237785	237832	237834	237836	the old lady	2505	" I remember . He could say whole pages by heart ; though , for my part , I like Mr. Congreve a great deal better . And then , there was that dreadful , dreary Milton , whom he and Mr. Addison pretended to admire ! "
237842	237866	237868	237868	George	694	" If your ladyship does not like Shakspeare , you will not quarrel with my mother for being indifferent to him , too , "
237870	237904	237868	237868	George	694	" And indeed I think , and I am sure , that you do n't do her justice . Wherever there are any poor she relieves them ; wherever there are any sick she "
237905	237916	237918	237919	the Baroness	2319	" She doses them with her horrible purges and boluses ! "
237921	237931	237918	237919	the Baroness	2319	" Of course , just as my mother did ! "
237932	237958	237868	237868	George	694	" She does her best to cure them ! She acts for the best , and performs her duty as far as she knows it . "
237959	237981	237983	237985	the old lady	2505	" I do n't blame you , sir , for doing yours , and keeping your own counsel about Madam Esmond , "
237987	238038	237983	237985	the old lady	2505	" But at least there is one point upon which we all three agree that this absurd marriage must be prevented . Do you know how old the woman is ? I can tell you , though she has torn the first leaf out of the family Bible at Castlewood . "
238039	238152	238153	238153	George	694	" My mother has not forgotten her cousin 's age , and is shocked at the disparity between her and my poor brother . Indeed , a city - bred lady of her time of life , accustomed to London gaiety and luxury , would find but a dismal home in our Virginian plantation . Besides , the house , such as it is , is not Harry 's . He is welcome there , Heaven knows ; more welcome , perhaps , than I , to whom the property comes in natural reversion ; but , as I told him , I doubt how his wife would would like our colony , "
238173	238181	238182	238182	she	2505	" He , he ! nephew Warrington ! "
238185	238310	238182	238182	she	2505	" you need not scruple to speak your mind out . I shall tell no tales to your mother : though ' tis no news to me that she has a high temper , and loves her own way . Harry has held his tongue , too ; but it needed no conjurer to see who was the mistress at home , and what sort of a life my sister led you . I love my niece , my Lady Molly , so well , that I could wish her two or three years of Virginia , with your mother reigning over her . You may well look alarmed , sir ! Harry has said quite enough to show me who governs the family . "
238311	238314	238316	238316	George	694	" Madam , "
238320	238355	238316	238316	George	694	" I may say as much as this , that I do n't envy any woman coming into our house against my mother 's will : and my poor brother knows this perfectly well . "
238356	238389	238182	238182	she	2505	" What ? You two have talked the matter over ? No doubt you have . And the foolish child considers himself bound in honour of course he does , the gaby ! "
238390	238465	238316	238316	George	694	" He says Lady Maria has behaved most nobly to him . When he was sent to prison , she brought him her trinkets and jewels , and every guinea she had in the world . This behaviour has touched him so , that he feels more deeply than ever bound to her ladyship . But I own my brother seems bound by honour rather than love such at least is his present feeling . "
238466	238471	238473	238474	Madame Bernstein	780	" My good creature , "
238476	238644	238473	238474	Madame Bernstein	780	" do n't you see that Maria brings a few twopenny trinkets and a half - dozen guineas to Mr. Esmond , the heir of the great estate in Virginia , not to the second son , who is a beggar , and has just squandered away every shilling of his fortune ? I swear to you , on my credit as a gentlewoman , that , knowing Harry 's obstinacy , and the misery he had in store for himself , I tried to bribe Maria to give up her engagement with him , and only failed because I could not bribe high enough ! When he was in prison , I sent my lawyer to him , with orders to pay his debts immediately , if he would but part from her , but Maria had been beforehand with us , and Mr. Harry chose not to go back from his stupid word . Let me tell you what has passed in the last month ! "
238988	238997	238999	238999	George	694	" Are these the inheritors of noble blood ? "
239036	239219	239027	239028	the chairmen	9191	" Are these the proud possessors of ancestral honours and ancient names , and were their forefathers , when in life , no better ? We have our pedigree at home with noble coats - of - arms emblazoned all over the branches , and titles dating back before the Conquest and the Crusaders . When a knight of old found a friend in want , did he turn his back upon him , or an unprotected damsel , did he delude her and leave her ? When a nobleman of the early time received a young kinsman , did he get the better of him at dice , and did the ancient chivalry cheat in horseflesh ? Can it be that this wily woman of the world , as my aunt has represented , has inveigled my poor Harry into an engagement , that her tears are false , and that as soon as she finds him poor she will desert him ? Had we not best pack the trunks and take a cabin in the next ship bound for home ? "
239296	239308	239309	239309	he	701	" There he is in flesh and blood , thank God ! "
239312	239466	239309	239309	he	701	" I was dreaming of thee but now , George , and that Ward was hearing us our lesson ! Dost thou remember the ruler , Georgy ? Why , bless my soul , ' tis three o'clock ! Where have you been a - gadding , Mr. George ? Hast thou supped ? I supped at White 's , but I 'm hungry again . I did not play , sir , no , no ; no more of that for younger brothers ! And my Lord March paid me fifty he lost to me . I bet against his horse and on the Duke of Hamilton 's ! They both rode the match at Newmarket this morning , and he lost because he was under weight . And he paid me , and he was as sulky as a bear . Let us have one pipe , Georgy ! just one . "
239756	239765	239767	239768	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Never mind , George , my dear ! "
239770	239809	239767	239768	Mrs. Mountain	773	" The Colonel has taken another wife , but I feel certain that at one time two young gentlemen I know of ran a very near chance of having a tall stepfather six feet two in his boots . "
239895	239917	239885	239886	Parson Stack	1440	" I should as soon fancy Mr. Esmond stealing the spoons , or marrying a negro woman out of the kitchen . "
239991	239999	240000	240000	he	1093	" The birthright is mine , Harry , "
240003	240148	240000	240000	he	1093	" but thou art the favourite , and God help me ! I think my mother almost grudges it to me . Why should I have taken the pas , and preceded your worship into the world ? Had you been the eider , you would have had the best cellar , and ridden the best nag , and been the most popular man in the country , whereas I have not a word to say for myself , and frighten people by my glum face : I should have been second son , and set up as lawyer , or come to England and got my degrees , and turned parson , and said grace at your honour 's table . The time is out of joint , sir . O cursed spite , that ever I was born to set it right ! "
240149	240164	240166	240166	Harry	701	" Why , Georgy , you are talking verses , I protest you are ! "
240168	240184	240186	240186	George	1093	" I think , my dear , some one else talked those verses before me , "
240192	240216	240218	240218	Harry	701	" It 's out of one of your books . You know every book that ever was wrote , that I do believe ! "
240246	240275	240277	240277	Harry	701	" Not that I cared much about their books , not being clever enough . But I remembered how my dear old George used to speak of 'em , "
240286	240363	240277	240277	Harry	701	" and that 's why I liked to see them . I say , dear , it 's like a dream seeing you over again . Think of that bloody Indian with his knife at my George 's head ! I should like to give that Monsieur de Florac something for saving you but I have n't got much now , only my little gold knee - buckles , and they ai n't worth two guineas . "
240364	240390	240391	240391	George	1093	" You have got the half of what I have , child , and we 'll divide as soon as I have paid the Frenchman , "
240501	240536	240487	240487	he	701	" Look here , gentlemen ! This is he . This is my brother , that was dead and is alive again ! Can any man in Christendom produce such a brother as this ? "
240946	240963	240965	240965	George	1093	" Where didst thou learn the art of winning over everybody to thy side , Harry ? "
240967	241338	240965	240965	George	1093	" and how is it that you and all the world begin by being friends ? Teach me a few lessons in popularity , nay , I do n't know that I will have them ; and when I find and hear certain people hate me , I think I am rather pleased than angry . At first , at Richmond , Mr. Esmond Warrington , the only prisoner who had escaped from Braddock 's field the victim of so much illness and hardship was a favourite with the town - folks , and received privately and publicly with no little kindness . The parson glorified my escape in a sermon ; the neighbours came to visit the fugitive ; the family coach was ordered out , and Madam Esmond and I paid our visits in return . I think some pretty little caps were set at me . But these our mother routed off , and frightened with the prodigious haughtiness of her demeanour ; and my popularity was already at the decrease before the event occurred which put the last finishing stroke to it . I was not jolly enough for the officers , and did n't care for their drinking - bouts , dice - boxes , and swearing . I was too sarcastic for the ladies , and their tea and tattle stupefied me almost as much as the men 's blustering and horse - talk . I can not tell thee , Harry , how lonely I felt in that place , amidst the scandal and squabbles : I regretted my prison almost , and found myself more than once wishing for the freedom of thought , and the silent ease of Duquesne . I am very shy , I suppose : I can speak unreservedly to very few people . Before most , I sit utterly silent . When we two were at home , it was thou who used to talk at table , and get a smile now and then from our mother . When she and I were together we had no subject in common , and we scarce spoke at all until we began to dispute about law and divinity . "
241430	241440	241445	241445	they	3411	" cried George , in a transport of wrath , "
241671	241672	241673	241673	I	0	" "
241695	241707	241708	241708	I	0	" roars out Harry , striding up and down the room . "
241719	241720	241716	241717	Bob Clubber	1442	" "
241768	241769	241766	241766	George	1093	" "
241858	241965	241966	241967	This author	11750	" Ah , what an opportunity is there here to moralise ! If the esteemed reader and his humble servant could but know could but write down in a book could but publish , with illustrations , a collection of the lies which have been told regarding each of us since we came to man 's estate , what a harrowing and thrilling work of fiction that romance would be ! Not only is the world informed of everything about you , but of a great deal more . Not long since the kind postman brought a paper containing a valuable piece of criticism , which stated "
241994	242022	241984	241984	He	11750	" The critic knew better : of course he did . Another and both came from the country which gave MULLIGAN birth warned some friend , saying , "
242047	242369	242035	242036	a brother	21464	" But this subject is too vast and noble for a mere paragraph . I shall prepare a memoir , or let us have rather , par une societe de gens de lettres , a series of biographies , of lives of gentlemen , as told by their dear friends whom they do n't know . George having related his exploits as champion and martyr , of course Harry had to unbosom himself to his brother , and lay before his elder an account of his private affairs . He gave up all the family of Castlewood my lord , not for getting the better of him at play ; for Harry was a sporting man , and expected to pay when he lost , and receive when he won ; but for refusing to aid the chaplain in his necessity , and dismissing him with such false and heartless pretexts . About Mr. Will he had made up his mind , after the horse - dealing matter , and freely marked his sense of the latter 's conduct upon Mr. Will 's eyes and nose . Respecting the Countess and Lady Fanny , Harry spoke in a manner more guarded , but not very favourable . He had heard all sorts of stories about them . The Countess was a card - playing old cat ; Lady Fanny was a desperate flirt . Who told him ? Well , he had heard the stories from a person who knew them both very well indeed . In fact , in those days of confidence , of which we made mention in the last volume , Maria had freely imparted to her cousin a number of anecdotes respecting her stepmother and her half - sister , which were by no means in favour of those ladies . But in respect to Lady Maria herself , the young man was staunch and hearty . "
242545	242565	242541	242541	God	792	" Here Harry dashed his sleeve across his eyes , with a stamp of his foot , and said , "
242602	242603	242589	242589	George	1093	" "
242612	242616	242604	242604	I	0	" George replied . "
242654	242655	242641	242641	I	0	" "
242682	242863	242670	242670	I	0	" says Mr. Harry , gloomily . Such had been the settlement between our two young worthies , when they first talked over Mr. Harry 's love affair . But after George 's conversation with his aunt , and the further knowledge of his family , which he acquired through the information of that keen old woman of the world , Mr. Warrington , who was naturally of a sceptical turn , began to doubt about Lady Maria , as well as regarding her brothers and sister , and looked at Harry 's engagement with increased distrust and alarm . Was it for his wealth that Maria wanted Harry ? Was it his handsome young person that she longed after ? Were those stories true which Aunt Bernstein had told of her ? Certainly he could not advise Harry to break his word ; but he might cast about in his mind for some scheme for putting Maria 's affection to the trial ; and his ensuing conduct , which appeared not very amiable , I suppose resulted from this deliberation .
243107	243114	243116	243120	the head of the house	20441	" Heard what ? seen what ? "
243128	243132	243134	243135	Lady Fanny	724	" Ask Maria ! "
243161	243174	243176	243176	Maria	690	" ' Tis one of Will 's usual elegant and polite inventions , "
243178	243181	243176	243176	Maria	690	" No , "
243191	243239	243241	243241	Will	913	" it was no invention of his . Tom Claypool of Norfolk saw 'em both at Ranelagh ; and Jack Morris came out of White 's , where he heard the story from Harry Warrington 's own lips . Curse him , I 'm glad of it ! "
243247	243276	243241	243241	Will	913	" What do you think of your Fortunate Youth , your Virginian , whom your lordship made so much of , turning out to be a second son ? "
243277	243284	243286	243287	my lord	2193	" The elder brother not dead ? "
243289	243313	243286	243287	my lord	2193	" No more dead than you are . Never was . It 's my belief that it was a cross between the two . "
243314	243323	243325	243325	Maria	690	" Mr. Warrington is incapable of such duplicity ! "
243327	243344	243346	243347	my lady	19701	" I never encouraged the fellow , I am sure you will do me justice there , "
243349	243359	243346	243347	my lady	19701	" Nor did Fanny : not we , indeed ! "
243360	243366	243370	243370	Fanny	724	" Not we , indeed ! "
243372	243396	243398	243398	Will	913	" The fellow is only a beggar , and , I dare say , has not paid for the clothes on his back , "
243400	243416	243398	243398	Will	913	" I 'm glad of it , for , hang him , I hate him ! "
243417	243435	243437	243438	my lord	2193	" You do n't regard him with favourable eyes ; especially since he blacked yours , Will ! "
243440	243455	243458	243458	he	913	" So the poor fellow has found his brother , and lost his estate ! "
243526	243537	243538	243538	she	690	" It 's a shame ! it 's a shame ! "
243560	243570	243571	243573	the former lady	11806	" We never quite understand your lordship 's humour , "
243578	243592	243594	243595	my lord	2193	" I do n't see there is the least reason why you should , "
243599	243623	243594	243595	my lord	2193	" Maria , my dear , pray excuse me if I have said that is , done anything , to hurt your feelings . "
243624	243645	243647	243647	Maria	690	" Done anything ! You pillaged the poor lad in his prosperity , and laugh at him in his ruin ! "
243661	243676	243678	243679	my lord	2193	" Excuse me , my dear sister , I was not laughing at him , "
243683	243740	243678	243679	my lord	2193	" Oh , never mind at what or whom else , my lord ! You have taken from him all he had to lose . All the world points at you as the man who feeds on his own flesh and blood . And now you have his all , you make merry over his misfortune ! "
243760	243785	243743	243743	she	11810	" Tell us what has happened , or what you have heard , Will , and my sister 's grief will not interrupt us . "
243912	243919	243920	243920	Will	913	" Where does Mr. Warrington live ? "
243937	243950	243952	243953	my lord	2193	" He shall be invited here , and treated with every respect , "
243955	243962	243964	243964	Will	913	" Including piquet , I suppose ! "
243966	243988	243964	243964	Will	913	" Or will you take him to the stables , and sell him one of your bargains of horseflesh , Will ? "
243993	244041	243964	243964	Will	913	" You would have won of Harry Warrington fast enough , if you could ; but you cheat so clumsily at your game that you got paid with a cudgel . I desire , once more , that every attention may be paid to our cousin Warrington . "
244042	244065	244067	244068	Lady Castlewood	721	" And that you are not to be disturbed , when you sit down to play , of course , my lord ! "
244070	244095	244097	244098	Lord Castlewood	707	" Madam , I desire fair play , for Mr. Warrington , and for myself , and for every member of this amiable family , "
244102	244119	244121	244122	the stepmother	11820	" Heaven help the poor gentleman if your lordship is going to be kind to him , "
244225	244241	244242	244242	Harry	701	" What business has a poor devil like me with horses and carriages , Georgy ? "
244247	244293	244242	244242	Harry	701	" Beyond the coat on my back , and the purse my aunt gave me , I have nothing in the world . You take the driving - seat , brother ; it will ease my mind if you will take the driving - seat . "
244336	244366	244316	244316	he	701	" But a bargain is a bargain ; if I share thy coats , thou must divide my breeches ' pocket , Harry ; that is but fair dealing ! "
244657	244668	244650	244651	honest Jones	1445	" Curse that Brown , he is always calling here ! "
244683	244702	244703	244703	I	0	" What , Brown my boy , delighted to see you ! Hope you 've come to lunch ! "
244892	244931	244889	244889	I	0	" What ! come to take pot - luck with us , Brown my boy ! Betsy ! put a knife and fork for Mr. Brown . Eat ! Welcome ! Fall to ! It 's my best ! "
244990	244997	244998	244998	she	721	" We have heard , Harry , "
245010	245055	244998	244998	she	721	" of this most extraordinary circumstance . My Lord Castlewood said at breakfast that he should wait on you this very day , Mr. Warrington , and , cousin Harry , we intend not to love you any the less because you are poor . "
245056	245078	245080	245081	Lady Fanny	724	" We shall be able to show now that it is not for your acres that we like you , Harry ! "
245089	245099	245101	245102	Mr. George	694	" And I to whom the acres have fallen ? "
245111	245125	245127	245130	the arch Lady Fanny	724	" Oh , cousin , we shall like you for being like Harry ! "
245216	245238	245240	245241	Lady Castlewood	721	" Better to have had a dish of tea and a game at piquet with them than with some other folks , "
245243	245276	245278	245278	mamma	19850	" If we had won enough to buy a paper of pins from you we should have been content ; but young gentlemen do n't know what is for their own good , "
245280	245301	245278	245278	mamma	19850	" Now you have no more money to play with , you can come and play with us , cousin ! "
245312	245324	245303	245305	fond Lady Fanny	724	" and so your misfortune will be good fortune to us . "
245445	245501	245428	245428	He	707	" If you were to come to us and I , for one , cordially rejoice to see you what a pity it is you did not come a few months earlier ! A certain evening at piquet would then most likely never have taken place . A younger son would have been more prudent . "
245502	245507	245509	245509	Harry	701	" Yes , indeed , "
245511	245628	245428	245428	He	707	" Or a kinsman more compassionate . But I fear that love of play runs in the blood of all of us . I have it from my father , and it has made me the poorest peer in England . Those fair ladies whom you see before you are not exempt . My poor brother Will is a martyr to it ; and what I , for my part , win on one day , I lose on the next . ' Tis shocking , positively , the rage for play in England . All my poor cousin 's bank - notes parted company from me within twenty - four hours after I got them . "
245629	245653	245655	245656	Mr. Warrington	701	" I have played , like other gentlemen , but never to hurt myself , and never indeed caring much for the sport , "
245658	245676	245678	245679	the ladies	2600	" When we heard that my lord had played with Harry , we did so scold him , "
245681	245748	245678	245679	the ladies	2600	" But if it had not been I , thou knowest , cousin Warrington , some other person would have had thy money . ' Tis a poor consolation , but as such Harry must please to take it , and be glad that friends won his money , who wish him well , not strangers , who cared nothing for him , and fleeced him . "
245749	245772	245774	245775	Mr. George	694	" Eh ! a tooth out is a tooth out , though it be your brother who pulls it , my lord ! "
245779	245798	245774	245775	Mr. George	694	" Harry must bear the penalty of his faults , and pay his debts , like other men . "
245799	245825	245827	245827	Harry	701	" I am sure I have never said or thought otherwise . ' Tis not like an Englishman to be sulky because he is beaten , "
245829	245841	245827	245827	Harry	701	" Your hand , cousin ! You speak like a man ! "
245856	245874	245849	245850	The ladies	2600	" My sister , in Virginia , has known how to bring up her sons as gentlemen ! "
245881	245899	245901	245902	cousin Fanny	724	" I protest you must not be growing so amiable now you are poor , cousin Harry ! "
245904	245950	245901	245902	cousin Fanny	724	" Why , mamma , we did not know half his good qualities when he was only Fortunate Youth and Prince of Virginia ! You are exactly like him , cousin George , but I vow you ca n't be as amiable as your brother ! "
245951	245969	245971	245971	George	694	" I am the Prince of Virginia , but I fear I am not the Fortunate Youth , "
245979	245987	245975	245975	Harry	701	" By Jove , he is the best "
246009	246016	246018	246019	Lady Castlewood	721	" ' Tis Maria , above , "
246021	246031	246018	246019	Lady Castlewood	721	" Let some of us go up to her . "
246066	246076	246077	246078	his lordship	2243	" Nay , if all the ladies follow your brother "
246081	246110	246077	246078	his lordship	2243	" let me at least have the benefit of your company and conversation . I long to hear the account of your captivity and rescue , cousin George ! "
246111	246120	246124	246125	the ladies	2600	" Oh , we must hear that too ! "
246129	246142	246144	246145	Lord Castlewood	707	" I am greedy , and should like it all by myself , "
246171	246196	246198	246198	George	694	" Your brother has no doubt acquainted you with the history of all that has happened to him in this house , cousin George ? "
246202	246219	246221	246221	George	694	" Yes , including the quarrel with Mr. Will and the engagement to my Lady Maria , "
246227	246247	246221	246221	George	694	" I may be pardoned for saying that he hath met with but ill fortune here , my lord . "
246248	246324	246325	246325	George	694	" Which no one can deplore more cordially than myself . My brother lives with horse jockeys and trainers , and the wildest bloods of the town , and between us there is very little sympathy . We should not all live together , were we not so poor . This is the house which our grandmother occupied before she went to America and married Colonel Esmond . Much of the furniture belonged to her . "
246335	246430	246325	246325	George	694	" Our house has not flourished in the last twenty years ; though we had a promotion of rank a score of years since , owing to some interest we had at court , then . But the malady of play has been the ruin of us all . I am a miserable victim to it : only too proud to sell myself and title to a roturiere , as many noblemen , less scrupulous , have done . Pride is my fault , my dear cousin . I remember how I was born ! "
246529	246594	246494	246494	he	705	" We have all our faults , my lord . That of play hath been condoned over and over again in gentlemen of our rank . Having heartily forgiven my brother , surely I can not presume to be your lordship 's judge in the matter ; and instead of playing and losing , I wish sincerely that you had both played and won ! "
246595	246605	246607	246608	my lord	2193	" So do I , with all my heart ! "
246613	246680	246607	246608	my lord	2193	" I augur well for your goodness when you can speak in this way , and for your experience and knowledge of the world , too , cousin , of which you seem to possess a greater share than most young men of your age . Your poor Harry hath the best heart in the world ; but I doubt whether his head be very strong . "
246681	246712	246494	246494	he	705	" Not very strong , indeed . But he hath the art to make friends wherever he goes , and in spite of all his imprudences most people love him . "
246713	246731	246733	246734	my lord	2193	" I do we all do , I 'm sure ! as if he were our brother ! "
246736	246787	246733	246734	my lord	2193	" He has often described in his letters his welcome at your lordship 's house . My mother keeps them all , you may be sure . Harry 's style is not very learned , but his heart is so good , that to read him is better than wit . "
246788	246810	246812	246813	my lord	2193	" I may be mistaken , but I fancy his brother possesses a good heart and a good wit , too ! "
246818	246846	246812	246813	my lord	2193	" I am as Heaven made me , cousin ; and perhaps some more experience and sorrow than has fallen to the lot of most young men . "
246847	246873	246875	246876	Lord Castlewood	707	" This misfortune of your poor brother I mean this piece of good fortune , your sudden reappearance has not quite left Harry without resources ? "
246881	246917	246875	246876	Lord Castlewood	707	" With nothing but what his mother can leave him , or I , at her death , can spare him . What is the usual portion here of a younger brother , my lord ? "
246918	246939	246946	246946	his	2193	" Eh ! a younger brother here is you know in fine , everybody knows what a younger brother is , "
246961	247051	246956	246957	The other	19802	" We are the best of friends , but we are flesh and blood : and I do n't pretend to do more for him than is usually done for younger brothers . Why give him money ? That he should squander it at cards or horse - racing ? My lord , we have cards and jockeys in Virginia , too ; and my poor Harry hath distinguished himself in his own country already , before he came to yours . He inherits the family failing for dissipation . "
247052	247063	246875	246876	Lord Castlewood	707	" Poor fellow , poor fellow , I pity him ! "
247064	247327	247328	247329	Mr. Warrington	701	" Our estate , you see , is great , but our income is small . We have little more money than that which we get from England for our tobacco and very little of that too for our tobacco comes back to us in the shape of goods , clothes , leather , groceries , ironmongery , nay , wine and beer for our people and ourselves . Harry may come back and share all these : there is a nag in the stable for him , a piece of venison on the table , a little ready money to keep his pocket warm , and a coat or two every year . This will go on whilst my mother lives , unless , which is far from improbable , he gets into some quarrel with Madam Esmond . Then , whilst I live he will have the run of the house and all it contains : then , if I die leaving children , he will be less and less welcome . His future , my lord , is a dismal one , unless some strange piece of luck turn up on which we were fools to speculate . Henceforth he is doomed to dependence , and I know no worse lot than to be dependent on a self - willed woman like our mother . The means he had to make himself respected at home he hath squandered away here . He has flung his patrimony to the dogs , and poverty and subserviency are now his only portion . "
247346	247362	247364	247365	my lord	2193	" You speak well , Mr. Warrington . Have you ever thought of public life ? "
247367	247401	247364	247365	my lord	2193	" Of course I have thought of public life like every man of my station every man , that is , who cares for something beyond a dice - box or a stable , "
247405	247465	247403	247403	George	705	" I hope , my lord , to be able to take my own place , and my unlucky brother must content himself with his . This I say advisedly , having heard from him of certain engagements which he has formed , and which it would be misery to all parties were he to attempt to execute now . "
247466	247473	247475	247476	my lord	2193	" Your logic is very strong , "
247478	247582	247475	247476	my lord	2193	" Shall we go up and see the ladies ? There is a picture above - stairs which your grandfather is said to have executed . Before you go , my dear cousin , you will please to fix a day when our family may have the honour of receiving you . Castlewood , you know , is always your home when we are there . It is something like your Virginian Castlewood , cousin , from your account . We have beef , and mutton , and ale , and wood , in plenty ; but money is woefully scarce amongst us . "
247644	247653	247654	247654	she	690	" You are indeed wonderfully like your brother , "
247662	247682	247654	247654	she	690	" And from what he says , cousin George , I think you are as good as he is . "
247700	247704	247705	247705	he	705	" Poor thing ! "
247708	247751	247705	247705	he	705	" Harry has been vaunting my generosity and virtue to her , and I have beer , playing the selfish elder brother downstairs ! How old she looks ! How could he ever have a passion for such a woman as that ? "
247942	247968	247970	247970	George	694	" And so we have been coaxing and cuddling in the window , and we part good friends , Harry ? Is it not so ? "
247975	247984	247986	247986	Harry	701	" Oh , she is a good woman ! "
247992	248006	247986	247986	Harry	701	" I know you 'll think so when you come to know her . "
248007	248043	247970	247970	George	694	" When you take her home to Virginia ? A pretty welcome our mother will give her . She will never forgive me for not breaking the match off , nor you for making it . "
248044	248158	247986	247986	Harry	701	" I ca n't help it , George ! Do n't you be popping your ugly head so close to my ears , Gumbo ! After what has passed between us , I am bound in honour to stand by her . If she sees no objection , I must find none . I told her all . I told her that Madam would be very rusty at first ; but that she was very fond of me , and must end by relenting . And when you come to the property , I told her that I knew my dearest George so well , that I might count upon sharing with him . "
248159	248219	247970	247970	George	694	" The deuce you did ! Let me tell you , my dear , that I have been telling my Lord Castlewood quite a different story . That as an elder brother I intend to have all my rights there , do n't flog that near horse so and that you can but look forward to poverty and dependence . "
248220	248229	248231	248231	Harry	701	" What ! You wo n't help me ? "
248237	248317	248231	248231	Harry	701	" George , I do n't believe it , though I hear it out of your own mouth ! There was a minute 's pause after this outbreak , during which Harry did not even look at his brother , but sate , gazing blindly before him , the picture of grief and gloom . He was driving so near to a road - post that the carriage might have been upset but for George 's pulling the rein . "
248327	248331	248318	248318	You	11926	" said Harry . "
248341	248342	248332	248332	I	0	" "
248353	248357	248351	248351	Harry	701	" George asked . "
248360	248365	248351	248351	Harry	701	" said the other , "
248369	248381	248382	248383	My dear	19699	" the tears were rolling down his cheeks as he spoke . "
248398	248399	248389	248389	you	19699	" "
248408	248441	248402	248402	you	19663	" I have said you were a younger brother that you have spent all your patrimony , and that your portion at home must be very slender . Is it not true ? "
248442	248461	248463	248463	Harry	701	" Yes , but I would not have believed it , if ten thousand men had told me , "
248465	248481	248463	248463	Harry	701	" Whatever happened to me , I thought I could trust you , George Warrington . "
248526	248538	248539	248540	his brother	2075	" That wine is a bad consoler in trouble , Harry , "
248543	248551	248553	248553	Harry	701	" I have no other , sir , "
248612	248647	248649	248649	George	694	" It was shabby to say I would not aid him , and , God help me , it was not true . I wo n't leave him , though he marries a blackamoor , "
248650	248677	248649	248649	George	694	" have I not done him harm enough already , by coming to life again ? Where has he gone ; has he gone to play ? "
248678	248688	248690	248691	George Warrington	694	" Good God ! what has happened to thee ? "
248715	248724	248725	248725	he	694	" I can take it now , Georgy , "
248728	249008	248725	248725	he	694	" Perhaps what you did was right , though . I for one will never believe that you would throw your brother off in distress . I 'll tell you what . At dinner , I thought suddenly , I 'll go back to her and speak to her . I 'll say to her , ' Maria , poor as I am , your conduct to me has been so noble , that , by heaven ! I am yours to take or to leave . If you will have me , here I am : I will enlist : I will work : I will try and make a livelihood for myself somehow , and my bro my relations will relent , and give us enough to live on . ' That 's what I determined to tell her ; and I did , George . I ran all the way to Kensington in the rain look , I am splashed from head to foot , and found them all at dinner , all except Will , that is . I spoke out that very moment to them all , sitting round the table , over their wine . ' Maria , ' says I , ' a poor fellow wants to redeem his promise which he made when he fancied he was rich . Will you take him ? ' I found I had plenty of words , and did n't hem and stutter as I 'm doing now . I spoke ever so long , and I ended by saying I would do my best and my duty by her , so help me God ! "
249212	249213	249207	249207	she	19821	" "
249219	249234	249207	249207	she	19821	" cries George , filling one of the glasses that still stood before him . "
249241	249253	249207	249207	she	19821	" says Harry . He was wild with delight at being free .
249411	249418	249420	249421	my lord	2193	" She is my own sister , "
249494	249495	249496	249496	Your	11956	" "
249503	249509	249511	249511	your	11956	" says Madame de Bernstein , "

249551	249574	249541	249541	you	11956	" says my lord , with a bow . Madame de Bernstein protested she was never in her life in better humour . "
249610	249611	249607	249607	thy	738	" "
249649	249656	249660	249660	you	11965	" replies Lord Castlewood , demurely . "
249668	249691	249660	249660	you	11965	" Castlewood , with a shrug of his shoulders , owned that he did advise his sister to see Mr. Henry Warrington . "
249704	249708	249715	249715	his	11535	" he continued , "
249746	249747	249749	249749	she	690	" "
249763	249768	249760	249760	his	694	" remarks the Baroness . "
249771	249778	249760	249760	his	694	" cries Eugene , taking snuff . "
249928	249929	249918	249919	Harry Warrington	701	" "
249934	249939	249918	249919	Harry Warrington	701	" asks the Baroness . "
249959	249960	249953	249954	The elder	2775	" "
249968	249974	249953	249954	The elder	2775	" cries Madame de Bernstein . "
250059	250060	250092	250094	ma parole d'honneur	11989	" "
250072	250078	250067	250067	I	0	" said Madame de Bernstein . "
250259	250260	250261	250261	Molly	690	" "
250269	250292	250293	250293	He	2434	" said my lord 's aunt , sipping her cup . My lord snarled a grin , and showed his yellow teeth . "
250297	250333	250295	250295	he	2434	" he said , ' she hath once or twice before had the malady very severely , and recovered perfectly . It do n't kill , as your ladyship knows , at Molly 's age . "
250588	250610	250612	250613	the Baroness	2319	" So , sir , I hear you have acted like a hard - hearted monster about your poor brother Harry ! "
250624	250655	250657	250657	George	694	" I acted but upon your ladyship 's hint , and desired to see whether it was for himself or his reputed money that his kinsfolk wanted to have him , "
250663	250689	250657	250657	George	694	" Nay , Maria could not marry a poor fellow who was utterly penniless , and whose elder brother said he would give him nothing ! "
250690	250700	250702	250702	George	694	" I did it for the best , madam , "
250707	250717	250719	250721	the old lady	2505	" And so thou didst , O thou hypocrite ! "
250723	250731	250733	250734	Mr. Warrington	694	" Hypocrite , madam ! and why ? "
250743	250751	250753	250756	the Baroness in French	12014	" I know all , my infant ! "
250758	250790	250753	250756	the Baroness in French	12014	" Thou art very like thy grandfather . Come , that I embrace thee ! Harry has told me all , and that thou hast divided thy little patrimony with him ! "
250791	250825	250827	250827	George	694	" It was but natural , madam . We have had common hearts and purses since we were born . I but feigned hard - heartedness in order to try those people yonder , "
250833	250843	250845	250846	the Bernstein	780	" And thou wilt divide Virginia with him too ? "
250848	250860	250862	250863	Mr. Warrington	694	" I do n't say so . It were not just , "
250865	250929	250862	250863	Mr. Warrington	694	" The land must go to the eldest born , and Harry would not have it otherwise : and it may be I shall die , or my mother outlive the pair of us . But half of what is mine is his : and he , it must be remembered , only was extravagant because he was mistaken as to his position . "
250930	250952	250954	250956	Madame de Bernstein	780	" But it is a knight of old , it is a Bayard , it is the grandfather come to life ! "
251207	251210	251202	251202	she	690	" Ah ! "
251217	251256	251202	251202	she	690	" ' tis mighty well of you , Harry , to have accepted the freedom which I gave you ; but I had no intention , sir , that you should be so pleased at being let off . "
252272	252306	252309	252309	Harry	701	" My father 's own brother 's wife ! What have I done to offend her ? Oh , Aunt Lambert , Aunt Lambert , did you ever see such cold - heartedness ? "
252316	252329	252331	252332	Aunt Lambert	1175	" Do we make any difference to you , my dear Harry ? "
252343	252369	252331	252332	Aunt Lambert	1175	" The world may look coldly at you , but we do n't belong to it : so you may come to us in safety . "
252370	252381	252383	252383	Harry	701	" In this house you are different from other people , "
252385	252406	252383	252383	Harry	701	" I do n't know how , but I always feel quiet and happy somehow when I come to you . "
252407	252424	252427	252428	General Lambert	975	" Quis me uno vivit felicior ? aut magis hac est Optandum vita dicere quis potuit ? "
252430	252443	252445	252445	he	975	" Do you know where I got these verses , Mr. Gownsman ? "
252464	252474	252476	252477	the scholar	12080	" You got them out of Catullus , sir , "
252479	252514	252476	252477	the scholar	12080	" I got them out of no such thing , sir . I got them out of my favourite Democritus Junior out of old Burton , who has provided many indifferent scholars with learning ; "
253225	253227	253229	253229	Titian	1463	" Venus "
253241	253249	253214	253215	the King	2044	" St. Francis adoring the infant Saviour , "
253381	253386	253389	253389	Tintoret	1467	" Esther before Ahasuerus , "
253452	253455	253457	253458	Mr. Lambert	1000	" Yonder , "
253460	253520	253521	253521	He	12160	" are two of my Lords of the Admiralty , Mr. Gilbert Elliot and Admiral Boscawen : your Boscawen , whose fleet fired the first gun in your waters two years ago . That stout gentleman all belated with gold is Mr. Fox , that was Minister , and is now content to be Paymaster with a great salary . "
253539	253543	253535	253537	a perfect Potosi	12161	" says George . "
253561	253566	253551	253551	He	12160	" continues General Lambert . "
253875	253876	253846	253846	your	12196	" "
253881	253889	253846	253846	your	12196	" says the poker of a nobleman . "
253899	253900	253897	253897	Mr.	12199	" "
253965	254100	253959	253960	Sir Miles	770	" As he spoke , the worthy General addressed himself entirely to his young friend , making no sort of account of his colleague , who stalked away with a scared look as if amazed at the other 's audacity . A hundred years ago , a nobleman was a nobleman , and expected to be admired as such . Sir Miles 's red waistcoat appeared in sight presently , and many cordial greetings passed between him , his nephew , and General Lambert : for we have described how Sir Miles was the most affectionate of men . So the General had quitted my Lord Wrotham 's house ? It was time , as his lordship himself wished to occupy it ? Very good ; but consider what a loss for the neighbours ! "
254114	254119	254108	254108	you	12205	" cries Sir Miles . "
254334	254628	254318	254318	My	0	" He passed his hand across his manly eyes : he was choking almost with generous and affectionate emotion . Whilst they were discoursing George Warrington the while restraining his laughter with admirable gravity the door of the King 's apartments opened , and the pages entered , preceding his Majesty . He was followed by his burly son , his Royal Highness the Duke , a very corpulent Prince , with a coat and face of blazing scarlet : behind them came various gentlemen and officers of state ; among whom George at once recognised the famous Mr. Secretary Pitt , by his tall stature , his eagle eye and beak , his grave and majestic presence . As I see that solemn figure passing , even a hundred years off , I protest I feel a present awe , and a desire to take my hat off . I am not frightened at George the Second ; nor are my eyes dazzled by the portentous appearance of his Royal Highness the Duke of Culloden and Fontenoy ; but the Great Commoner , the terrible Cornet of Horse ! His figure bestrides our narrow isle of a century back like a Colossus ; and I hush as he passes in his gouty shoes , his thunderbolt hand wrapped in flannel . Perhaps as we see him now , issuing with dark looks from the royal closet , angry scenes have been passing between him and his august master . He has been boring that old monarch for hours with prodigious long speeches , full of eloquence , voluble with the noblest phrases upon the commonest topics ; but , it must be confessed , utterly repulsive to the little shrewd old gentleman , "
254636	254819	254318	254318	My	0	" as the phrase is , and who has the most thorough dislike for fine boedry and for fine brose too ! The sublime Minister passes solemnly through the crowd ; the company ranges itself respectfully round the wall ; and his Majesty walks round the circle , his royal son lagging a little behind , and engaging select individuals in conversation for his own part . The monarch is a little , keen , fresh - coloured old man , with very protruding eyes , attired in plain , old - fashioned , snuff - coloured clothes and brown stockings , his only ornament the blue ribbon of his Order of the Garter . He speaks in a German accent , but with ease , shrewdness , and simplicity , addressing those individuals whom he has a mind to notice , or passing on with a bow . He knew Mr. Lambert well , who had served under his Majesty at Dettingen , and with his royal son in Scotland , and he congratulated him good - humouredly on his promotion . "
254825	254833	254318	254318	My	0	" his Majesty was pleased to say , "
254873	254924	254867	254869	no better officer	12229	" The veteran blushed and bowed , deeply gratified at this speech . Meanwhile , the Best of Monarchs was looking at Sir Miles Warrington whom his Majesty knew perfectly , as the eager recipient of all favours from all Ministers , and at the young gentleman by his side . "
254929	254997	254867	254869	no better officer	12229	" the Defender of the Faith condescended to ask , pointing towards George Warrington , who stood before his sovereign in a respectful attitude , clad in poor Harry 's best embroidered suit . With the deepest reverence Sir Miles informed his King , that the young gentleman was his nephew , Mr. George Warrington , of Virginia , who asked leave to pay his humble duty . "
255007	255015	255016	255016	He	12230	" the Venerated Prince deigned to observe . "
255056	255097	255048	255048	You	12232	" and with this , the revered wielder of Britannia 's sceptre passed on to other lords and gentlemen of his court . Sir Miles Warrington was deeply affected at the royal condescension . He clapped his nephew 's hands . "
255105	255109	255048	255048	You	12232	" he cried ; "
255137	255138	255142	255142	he	12238	" "
255145	255165	255142	255142	he	12238	" cried his lordship , clasping his ruffled hands , and turning his fine eyes up to the sky , "
255174	255175	255142	255142	he	12238	" "
255188	255235	255178	255179	Master Louis	1480	" says Lambert , pointing to a young gentleman who stood with a crowd round him ; and presently the stout Duke of Cumberland came up to our little group . His Royal Highness held out his hand to his old companion - in - arms . "
255244	255267	255242	255242	Lambert	1000	" he said good - naturedly . Sir Miles Warrington 's eyes were ready to burst out of his head with rapture . "
255282	255288	255242	255242	Lambert	1000	" said the grateful General . "
255334	255335	255328	255329	James Wolfe	1031	" "
255341	255342	255328	255329	James Wolfe	1031	" "
255386	255401	255384	255384	Lambert	1000	" And the broad back of the Royal Prince was turned to our friends . "
255448	255500	255442	255442	I	0	" cried the enthusiastic Baronet ; and he drove George and the General back to Hill Street , and presented the latter to my Lady Warrington and his darlings , Flora and Dora , and insisted upon their partaking of a collation , as they must be hungry after their ride . "
255557	255563	255550	255550	Our	12257	" says the hospitable Baronet , "
255646	255749	255750	255750	We	12263	" Sir Miles , in his nephew 's presence and hearing , described to his wife and daughters George 's reception at court in such flattering terms that George hardly knew himself , or the scene at which he had been present , or how to look his uncle in the face , or how to contradict him before his family in the midst of the astonishing narrative he was relating . Lambert sat by for a while with open eyes . He , too , had been at Kensington . He had seen none of the wonders which Sir Miles described . "
255777	255778	255766	255766	we	12263	" "
255787	255793	255782	255782	I	0	" says a little voice . "
255962	255967	255957	255957	George	694	" bawls the knight . "
255982	256069	255968	255968	You	12264	" says my lady , rising . Mr. Lambert pleaded to be excused ; but the ladies on no account would let dear George go away . No , positively , he should not go . They wanted to make acquaintance with their cousin . They must hear about that dreadful battle and escape from the Indians . Tom Claypool came in and heard some of the story . Flora was listening to it with her handkerchief to her eyes , and little Miles had just said "
256086	256219	256079	256079	You	12276	" Being a man of great humour , Martin Lambert , when he went home , could not help entertaining his wife with an account of the new family with which he had made acquaintance . A certain ca nt word called humbug had lately come into vogue . Will it be believed that the General used it to designate the family of this virtuous country gentleman ? He described the eager hospitalities of the father , the pompous flatteries of the mother , and the daughters ' looks of admiration ; the toughness and security of the mutton , and the abominable taste and odour of the cordial ; and we may be sure Mrs. Lambert contrasted Lady Warrington 's recent behaviour to poor Harry with her present conduct to George . "
256227	256232	256222	256223	Miss Warrington	1207	" asks Mrs Lambent . "
256253	256258	256259	256260	The hypocrite	12277	" replies the General . "
256270	256289	256290	256290	Bo	1482	" cries the lady . To which the General , strange to say , only replied by the monosyllable "
256292	256293	256290	256290	Bo	1482	" "
256304	256309	256310	256310	I	0	" asks the lady . "
256323	256351	256310	256310	I	0	" answers the General . And his wife vows she does not know what he means , or of what he is thinking , and the General says "
256356	256356	256310	256310	I	0	"
257102	257121	257122	257124	the old lady	2505	" You pull a long face , Harry , and complain of the world 's treatment of you , "
257127	257444	257122	257124	the old lady	2505	" Fiddlededee , sir ! Everybody has to put up with impertinences : and if you get a box on the ear now you are poor and cast down , you must say nothing about it , bear it with a smile , and if you can , revenge it ten years after . Moi qui vous parle , sir ! do you suppose I have had no humble - pie to eat ? All of us in our turn are called upon to swallow it : and , now you are no longer the Fortunate Youth , be the Clever Youth , and win back the place you have lost by your ill luck . Go about more than ever . Go to all the routs and parties to which you are asked , and to more still . Be civil to everybody to all women especially . Only of course take care to show your spirit , of which you have plenty . With economy , and by your brother 's , I must say , admirable generosity , you can still make a genteel figure . With your handsome person , sir , you ca n't fail to get a rich heiress . Tenez ! You should go amongst the merchants in the City , and look out there . They wo n't know that you are out of fashion at the Court end of the town . With a little management , there is not the least reason , sir , why you should not make a good position for yourself still . When did you go to see my Lady Yarmouth , pray ? Why did you not improve that connexion ? She took a great fancy to you . I desire you will be constant at her ladyship 's evenings , and lose no opportunity of paying court to her . "
257718	257728	257729	257729	he	701	" I know you are the best people alive , "
257736	257758	257729	257729	he	701	" and the kindest , and that I must be the dullest company in the world yes , that I am . "
257759	257770	257772	257773	Miss Hetty	993	" Well , you are not very lively , Harry , "
257787	257803	257785	257785	herself	993	" What ? Is this the gentleman whom I took to be such a hero ? "
257804	257816	257818	257818	Theo	987	" If he is unhappy , why should he be lively ? "
257822	257848	257818	257818	Theo	987	" He has a good heart , and is pained at his friends ' desertion of him . Sure there is no harm in that ? "
257849	257864	257866	257866	Hetty	993	" I would have too much spirit to show I was hurt , though , "
257873	257933	257818	257818	Theo	987	" And I would smile , though that horrible old painted woman boxed my ears . She is horrible , mamma . You think so yourself , Theo ! Own , now , you think so yourself ! You said so last night , and acted her coming in on her crutch , and grinning round to the company . "
257934	257941	257943	257943	Theo	987	" I may n't like her , "
257949	257968	257943	257943	Theo	987	" But there is no reason why I should call Harry 's aunt names before Harry 's face . "
257969	257979	257981	257981	Hetty	993	" You provoking thing ; you are always right ! "
257983	258013	257981	257981	Hetty	993	" and that 's what makes me so angry . Indeed , Harry , it was very wrong of me to make rude remarks about any of your relations . "
258014	258076	258089	258089	You	12340	" I do n't care about the others , Hetty ; but it seems hard that this one should turn upon me . I had got to be very fond of her ; and you see , it makes me mad , somehow , when people I 'm very fond of turn away from me , or act unkind to me . "
258077	258085	258087	258087	Hetty	993	" Suppose George were to do so ? "
258107	258135	258137	258137	Harry	701	" You are very clever and very lively , and you may suppose a number of things ; but not that , Hetty , if you please , "
258148	258180	258137	258137	Harry	701	" You do n't know my brother as I know him or you would n't take such a liberty as to suppose my brother George could do anything unkind or unworthy ! "
258227	258264	258215	258215	Harry	701	" I 'm very sorry , and I beg your pardon , Hetty , if I said anything rough , or that seemed unkind ; but I always fight up if anybody says anything against George . "
258305	258308	258310	258310	Hetty	993	" Oh ! "
258312	258397	258310	258310	Hetty	993	" I thought it would be so happy to see him every day , and was so glad when papa said we were to stay in London ! And now I do see him , you see , I go on offending him . I ca n't help offending him ; and I know he is not clever , Theo . But oh ! is n't he good , and kind , and brave ? Did n't he look handsome when he was angry ? "
258398	258414	258415	258415	Theo	987	" You silly little thing , you are always trying to make him look handsome , "
258450	258452	258443	258444	General Lambert	975	" Bo "
258547	258553	258542	258542	they	12351	" and you know , Molly "
258566	258576	258578	258579	the General	3644	" you fancied somebody else before you fancied me , "
258629	258656	258658	258659	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Oh yes : now he is poor we will show him the door , as all the rest of the world does , I suppose , "
258661	258684	258686	258687	the General	3644	" That is what I always do , is n't it , Molly ? turn my back on my friends in distress ? "
258689	258709	258711	258712	the wife	5675	" No , my dear ! I am a goose , now , and that I own , Martin ! "
258723	258777	258779	258783	the kind - hearted officer	12356	" Let the poor boy come to us and welcome : ours is almost the only house in this selfish place where so much can be said for him . He is unhappy , and to be with us puts him at ease ; in God 's name let him be with us ! "
258954	259100	258939	258939	himself	694	" Dear Harry , I am George the Unlucky , though you have ceased to be Harry the Fortunate . Florac would have done much better not to pass his sword through that Indian 's body , and to have left my scalp as an ornament for the fellow 's belt . I say he would , sir ! At White 's the people would have respected you . Our mother would have wept over me , as a defunct angel , instead of being angry with me for again supplanting her favourite you are her favourite , you deserve to be her favourite : everybody 's favourite : only , if I had not come back , your favourite , Maria , would have insisted on marrying you ; and that is how the gods would have revenged themselves upon you for your prosperity . "
259101	259115	259117	259118	the brother	12366	" I never know whether you are laughing at me or yourself , George "
259130	259141	259143	259143	George	694	" Precisely my own case , Harry , my dear ! "
259145	259170	259143	259143	George	694	" But this I know , that there never was a better brother in the world ; and never better people than the Lamberts . "
259171	259178	259180	259180	George	694	" Never was truer word said ! "
259188	259209	259211	259212	the younger	2145	" And if I 'm unhappy , ' tis not your fault nor their fault nor perhaps mine , George , "
259214	259244	259211	259212	the younger	2145	" ' Tis fate , you see , ' tis the having nothing to do . I must work ; and how , George ? that is the question . "
259245	259263	259265	259265	George	694	" We will see what our mother says . We must wait till we hear from her , "
259267	259290	259292	259292	Harry	1491	" I say , George ! Do you know , I do n't think I should much like going back to Virginia ? "
259301	259313	259292	259292	Harry	1491	" What ! in love with one of the lasses here ? "
259314	259503	259211	259212	the younger	2145	" Love 'em like sisters with all my heart , of course , dearest , best girls ! but , having come out of that business , thanks to you , I do n't want to go back , you know . No ! no ! It is not for that I fancy staying in Europe better than going home . But , you see , I do n't fancy hunting , duck - shooting , tobacco - planting , whist - playing , and going to sermon , over and over and over again , for all my life , George . And what else is there to do at home ? What on earth is there for me to do at all , I say ? That 's what makes me miserable . It would not matter for you to be a younger son you are so clever you would make your way anywhere ; but , for a poor fellow like me , what chance is there ? Until I do something , George , I shall be miserable , that 's what I shall ! "
259504	259521	259292	259292	Harry	1491	" Have I not always said so ? Art thou not coming round to my opinion ? "
259522	259541	259543	259545	the dutiful junior	12370	" What opinion , George ? You know pretty much whatever you think , I think , George ! "
259547	259564	259543	259545	the dutiful junior	12370	" That Florac had best have left the Indian to take my scalp , my dear ! "
260429	260436	260417	260419	the triumphant Scots	1497	" Where 's Wully Shakspeare noo ? "
260437	260451	260453	260454	the General	3644	" I should like to see the man who could beat Willy Shakspeare ? "
260458	260463	260465	260466	Mr. Warrington	694	" Mere national prejudice , "
260468	260474	260476	260477	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Beat Shakspeare , indeed ! "
260479	260502	260504	260505	the General	3644	" Pooh , pooh ! you have cried more over Mr. Sam Richardson than ever you did over Mr. Shakspeare , Molly ! "
260507	260528	260504	260505	the General	3644	" I think few women love to read Shakspeare : they say they love it , but they do n't . "
260529	260534	260536	260537	three ladies	2366	" Oh , papa ! "
260546	260591	260536	260537	three ladies	2366	" Well , then , why do you all three prefer Douglas ? And you , boys , who are such Tories , will you go see a play which is wrote by a Whig Scotchman , who was actually made prisoner at Falkirk ? "
260592	260598	260600	260603	Mr. Jack the scholar	1059	" Relicta non bene parmula , "
260605	260614	260616	260617	the General	3644	" Nay ; it was relicta bene parmula , "
260619	260659	260616	260617	the General	3644	" It was the Highlanders who flung their targes down , and made fierce work among us redcoats . If they had fought all their fields as well as that , and young Perkin had not turned back from Derby "
260660	260678	260680	260680	George	694	" I know which side would be rebels , and who would be called the Young Pretender , "
260682	260696	260698	260699	the General	3644	" Hush ! you must please to remember my cloth , Mr. Warrington , "
260705	260751	260698	260699	the General	3644	" and that the cockade I wear is a black , not a white one ! Well , if you will not love Mr. Home for his politics , there is , I think , another reason , George , why you should like him . "
260752	260776	260778	260778	George	694	" I may have Tory fancies , Mr. Lambert , but I think I know how to love and honour a good Whig , "
260787	260799	260778	260778	George	694	" but why should I like this Mr. Home , sir ? "
260800	260871	260698	260699	the General	3644	" Because , being a Presbyterian clergyman , he has committed the heinous crime of writing a play , and his brother - parsons have barked out an excommunication at him . They took the poor fellow 's means of livelihood away from him for his performance ; and he would have starved , but that the young Pretender on our side of the water has given him a pension . "
260872	260888	260890	260890	George	694	" If he has been persecuted by the parsons , there is hope for him , "
260894	260906	260890	260890	George	694	" And henceforth I declare myself ready to hear his sermons . "
260907	260970	260698	260699	the General	3644	" Mrs. Woffington is divine in it , though not generally famous in tragedy . Barry is drawing tears from all eyes ; and Garrick is wild at having refused the piece . Girls , you must bring each half a dozen handkerchiefs ! As for mamma , I can not trust her ; and she positively must be left at home . "
261690	261702	261703	261703	he	3644	" Alas ! Hereditary evil was the cause of my misfortunes , "
261783	261835	261899	261899	he	12490	" slashed at the legs and body , and when Mr. Barry appeared in this droll costume , the General vowed it was the exact dress of the Highlanders in the late war . The Chevalier 's Guard , he declared , had all white satin slashed breeches , and red boots "
261846	261897	261899	261899	he	12490	" adds this wag . Not one pennyworth of sublimity would he or George allow henceforth to Mr. Home 's performance . As for Harry , he sate in very deep meditation over the scene ; and when Mrs. Lambert offered him a penny for his thoughts , he said , "
261948	261969	261945	261946	Aunt Lambert	1175	" says he , drumming on his hat ; on which mamma sighed , and Theo , smiling , said , "
261981	261982	261976	261977	the Danes	1508	" "
261988	261993	261985	261985	you	12494	" asks simple Harry . "
262006	262105	261996	261997	the Danes	12495	" says kind Theo , who had hold of her sister 's little hand , and , I dare say , felt its pressure . She did not behave unkindly that was not in Miss Theo 's nature but somewhat coldly to Mr. George , on whom she turned her back , addressing remarks , from time to time , to Harry . In spite of the gentlemen 's scorn , the women chose to be affected . A mother and son , meeting in love and parting in tears , will always awaken emotion in female hearts . "
262119	262178	262179	262179	You	19857	" says Theo , pointing towards the stage . At a part of the dialogue between Lady Randolph and her son , one of the grenadiers on guard on each side of the stage , as the custom of those days was , could not restrain his tears , and was visibly weeping before the side - box . "
262186	262190	262179	262179	You	19857	" says papa . "
262200	262204	262193	262193	I	0	" interposes Hetty . "
262224	262225	262193	262193	I	0	" "
262230	262299	262300	262300	Ye	12502	" cries the young student from college . George felt abashed somehow , and interested too . He had been sneering , and Theo sympathising . Her kindness was better nay , wiser than his scepticism , perhaps . Nevertheless , when , at the beginning of the fifth act of the play , young Douglas , drawing his sword and looking up at the gallery , bawled out "
262373	262405	262406	262407	This Douglas	1448	" The gods , to whom Mr. Barry appealed , saluted this heroic wish with immense applause , and the General clapped his hands prodigiously . His daughter was rather disconcerted . "
262418	262422	262423	262423	I	0	" says papa . "
262437	262467	262435	262435	Dane	1512	" says Theo , smiling , as Lady Randolph entered in the midst of the gallery thunder . When the applause had subsided , Lady Randolph is made to say "
262476	262477	262471	262471	I	0	" "
262486	262490	262480	262480	she	12508	" cries papa . "
262503	262548	262558	262558	herself	12508	" And the General would scarcely behave himself from thenceforth to the end of the performance . He said he was heartily glad that the young gentleman was put to death behind the scenes . When Lady Randolph 's friend described how her mistress had "
262564	262577	262558	262558	herself	12508	" Mr. Lambert said he was delighted to be rid of her . "
262588	262592	262593	262593	I	0	" says he , "
262602	262603	262593	262593	I	0	" "
262618	262674	262612	262614	their Royal Highnesses	12512	" The tragedy over , the Princess Dowager and the Prince were , in fact , retiring ; though , I dare say , the latter , who was always fond of a farce , would have been far better pleased with that which followed than he had been with Mr. Home 's dreary tragic masterpiece .
262926	262936	262938	262939	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" As for what our gentlemen say , sir , "
262944	262972	262938	262939	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" you must not believe a word of it . ' Tis a delightful piece , and my husband and Mr. George behaved as ill as possible . "
262973	262989	262990	262991	the General	3644	" We laughed in the wrong place , and when we ought to have cried , "
262994	263000	262990	262991	the General	3644	" that 's the truth . "
263001	263052	262938	262939	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" You caused all the people in the boxes about us to look round and cry ' Hush ! ' You made the pit folks say , ' Silence in the boxes , yonder ! ' Such behaviour I never knew , and quite blushed for you , Mr. Lambert ! "
263053	263071	263073	263074	the General	3644	" Mamma thought it was a tragedy , and we thought it was a piece of fun , "
263076	263090	263073	263074	the General	3644	" George and I behaved perfectly well , did n't we , Theo ? "
263091	263102	263103	263103	Theo	987	" Not when I was looking your way , papa ! "
263112	263122	263108	263109	the General	3644	" Was there ever such a saucy baggage seen ? "
263123	263138	263139	263139	Theo	987	" You know , sir , I did n't speak till I was bid , "
263144	263198	263200	263202	the young lady	6270	" I own I was very much moved by the play , and the beauty and acting of Mrs. Woffington . I was sorry that the poor mother should find her child , and lose him . I am sorry , too , papa , if I ought n't to have been sorry ! "
263208	263222	263224	263224	Hetty	993	" Women are not so clever as men , you know , Theo , "
263239	263274	263224	263224	Hetty	993	" The next time we go to the play , please , brother Jack , pinch us when we ought to cry , or give us a nudge when it is right to laugh . "
263275	263285	263287	263288	General Lambert	975	" I wish we could have had the fight , "
263290	263324	263287	263288	General Lambert	975	" the fight between little Norval and the gigantic Norwegian that would have been rare sport : and you should write , Jack , and suggest it to Mr. Rich , the manager . "
263325	263342	263344	263344	Harry	701	" I have not seen that : but I saw Slack and Broughton at Marybone Gardens ! "
263364	263371	263372	263372	he	701	" It would require no giant , "
263375	263399	263372	263372	he	701	" to knock over yonder little fellow in the red boots . I , for one , could throw him over my shoulder . "
263400	263418	263420	263421	Mr. Spencer	1513	" Mr. Garrick is a little man . But there are times when he looks a giant , "
263423	263483	263420	263421	Mr. Spencer	1513	" How grand he was in Macbeth , Mr. Warrington ! How awful that dagger - scene was ! You should have seen our host , ladies ! I presented Mr. Warrington , in the greenroom , to Mr. Garrick and Mrs. Pritchard , and Lady Macbeth did him the honour to take a pinch out of his box . "
263484	263495	263497	263498	the General	3644	" Did the wife of the Thane of Cawdor sneeze ? "
263505	263537	263497	263498	the General	3644	" She thanked Mr. Warrington , in tones so hollow and tragic , that he started back , and must have upset some of his rappee , for Macbeth sneezed thrice . "
263538	263545	263547	263548	the General	3644	" Macbeth , Macbeth , Macbeth ! "
263550	263598	263547	263548	the General	3644	" And the great philosopher who was standing by Mr. Johnson , says , ' You must mind , Davy , lest thy sneeze should awaken Duncan ! ' who , by the way , was talking with the three witches as they sat against the wall . "
263599	263624	263626	263626	Theo	987	" What ! Have you been behind the scenes at the play ? Oh , I would give worlds to go behind the scenes ! "
263628	263670	263672	263675	the sceptical young host	12543	" And see the ropes pulled , and smell the tallow - candles , and look at the pasteboard gold , and the tinsel jewels , and the painted old women , Theo ? No . Do not look too close , "
263684	263694	263672	263675	the sceptical young host	12543	" You were angry with your papa and me . "
263695	263700	263702	263703	the girl	21803	" Nay , George ! "
263705	263743	263745	263745	George	694	" Nay ? I say , yes ! You were angry with us because we laughed when you were disposed to be crying . If I may speak for you , sir , as well as myself , "
263756	263840	263753	263754	General Lambert	975	" I think we were not inclined to weep , like the ladies , because we stood behind the author 's scenes of the play , as it were . Looking close up to the young hero , we saw how much of him was rant and tinsel ; and as for the pale , tragical mother , that her pallor was white chalk , and her grief her pocket - handkerchief . Own now , Theo , you thought me very unfeeling ? "
263841	263863	263865	263865	Theo	987	" If you find it out , sir , without my owning it , what is the good of my confessing ? "
263867	263874	263877	263877	George	694	" Suppose I were to die ? "
263879	263922	263877	263877	George	694	" and you saw Harry in grief , you would be seeing a genuine affliction , a real tragedy ; you would grieve too . But you would n't be affected if you saw the undertaker in weepers and a black cloak ! "
263923	263932	263934	263935	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Indeed , but I should , sir ! "
263937	263951	263934	263935	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" and so , I promise you , would any daughter of mine . "
263952	263965	263967	263967	Theo	987	" Perhaps we might find weepers of our own , Mr. Warrington , "
263969	263975	263967	263967	Theo	987	" in such a case . "
263976	263980	263982	263982	George	694	" Would you ? "
264010	264021	264002	264002	Hetty	993	" The elder writers understood but little of the pathetic , "
264030	264040	264043	264045	Mr. John Lambert	1000	" What do you think of Sophocles and Antigone ? "
264047	264129	264131	264132	the Templar	12531	" Faith , our wits trouble themselves little about him , unless an Oxford gentleman comes to remind us of him ! I did not mean to go back farther than Mr. Shakspeare , who , as you will all agree , does not understand the elegant and pathetic as well as the moderns . Has he ever approached Belvidera , or Monimia , or Jane Shore ; or can you find in his comic female characters the elegance of Congreve ? "
264141	264153	264155	264156	some one	4753	" I think Mr. Spencer himself must have tried his hand ? "
264158	264181	264155	264156	some one	4753	" Many gentlemen of leisure have . Mr. Garrick , I own , has had a piece of mine and returned it . "
264182	264200	264202	264202	George	694	" And I confess that I have four acts of a play in one of my boxes , "
264204	264220	264202	264202	George	694	" I 'll be bound to say it 's as good as any of 'em , "
264227	264236	264238	264239	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Is it a tragedy or a comedy ? "
264241	264256	264257	264257	George	694	" Oh , a tragedy , and two or three dreadful murders at least ! "
264260	264284	264286	264287	the General	3644	" Let us play it , and let the audience look to their eyes ! Yet my chief humour is for a tyrant , "
264289	264306	264308	264309	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" The tragedy , the tragedy ! Go and fetch the tragedy this moment , Gumbo ! "
264322	264329	264314	264314	Gumbo	689	" Tragedy ? yes , madam . "
264330	264339	264340	264340	George	694	" In the great cowskin trunk , Gumbo , "
264350	264355	264345	264345	Gumbo	689	" Yes , sir , "
264361	264387	264345	264345	Gumbo	689	" But my tragedy is at the bottom of I do n't know how much linen , packages , books , and boots , Hetty . "
264388	264405	264407	264408	Miss Hetty	993	" Never mind , let us have it , and fling the linen out of window ! "
264410	264448	264450	264450	George	694	" And the great cowskin trunk is at our agent 's at Bristol : so Gumbo must get post - horses , and we can keep it up till he returns the day after to - morrow , "
264457	264460	264462	264462	papa	19857	" Oh ! "
264470	264545	264462	264462	papa	19857	" Let us be thankful for the escape . Let us be thinking of going home too . Our young gentlemen have treated us nobly , and we will all drink a parting bumper to Madam Esmond Warrington of Castlewood , in Virginia . Suppose , boys , you were to find a tall , handsome stepfather when you got home ? Ladies as old as she have been known to marry before now . "
264546	264556	264558	264559	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" To Madam Esmond Warrington , my old schoolfellow ! "
264561	264595	264558	264559	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" I shall write and tell her what a pretty supper her sons have given us : and , Mr. George , I wo n't say how ill you behaved at the play ! "
265397	265427	265428	265429	Miss Theo	987	" Your brother and mine are gone to see our little brother at his school at the Chartreux . My brothers are both to be clergymen , I think , "
265518	265527	265528	265528	Theo	987	" He often comes , almost every day , "
265538	265568	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Poor fellow ! He likes us better than the fine folks , who do n't care for him now now he is no longer a fine folk himself , "
265575	265599	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Why have you not set up for the fashion , and frequented the chocolate - houses and the racecourses , Mr. Warrington ? "
265600	265624	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Has my brother got so much good out of his gay haunts or his grand friends , that I should imitate him ? "
265625	265702	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" You might at least go to Sir Miles Warrington ; sure his arms are open to receive you . Her ladyship was here this morning in her chair , and to hear her praises of you ! She declares you are in a certain way to preferment . She says his Royal Highness the Duke made much of you at court . When you are a great man will you forget us , Mr. Warrington ? "
265703	265718	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Yes , when I am a great man I will , Miss Lambert . "
265719	265726	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Well ! Mr. George , then "
265727	265731	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Mr. George ! "
265732	265748	265750	265750	Theo	987	" When papa and mamma are here , I suppose there need be no mistering , "
265763	265811	265750	265750	Theo	987	" And what have you been doing , sir ? Reading books , or writing more of your tragedy ? Is it going to be a tragedy to make us cry , as we like them , or only to frighten us , as you like them ? "
265812	265892	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" There is plenty of killing , but , I fear , not much crying . I have not met many women . I have not been very intimate with those . I daresay what I have written is only taken out of books or parodied from poems which I have read and imitated like other young men . Women do not speak to me , generally ; I am said to have a sarcastic way which displeases them . "
265893	265902	265904	265905	Miss Theo	987	" Perhaps you never cared to please them ? "
265911	265923	265904	265905	Miss Theo	987	" I displeased you last night ; you know I did ? "
265924	265942	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Yes ; only it ca n't be called displeasure , and afterwards thought I was wrong . "
265943	265958	265570	265571	the girl	21803	" Did you think about me at all when I was away , Theo ? "
265959	266056	265904	265905	Miss Theo	987	" Yes , George that is , Mr. well , George ! I thought you and papa were right about the play ; and , as you said , that it was no real sorrow , only affectation , which was moving us . I wonder whether it is good or ill fortune to see so clearly ? Hetty and I agreed that we would be very careful , for the future , how we allowed ourselves to enjoy a tragedy . So , be careful when yours comes ! What is the name of it ? "
266057	266076	266082	266082	mamma	19850	" He is not christened . Will you be the godmother ? The name of the chief character is "
266150	266161	266163	266164	Miss Hetty	993	" I dare say it is better now , mamma , "
266166	266185	266187	266188	Miss Theo	987	" Indeed , my dear , it never was of any consequence ; and I told mamma so , "
266316	266408	266309	266309	he	701	" Why may n't I be a soldier too ? I am as tall as yonder fellow , and can kill with a fowling - piece as well as any man I know . But I ca n't earn so much as sixpence a day . I have squandered my own bread , and now I am eating half my brother 's . He is the best of brothers , but so much the more shame that I should live upon him . Do n't tell my brother , Jack Lambert . "
266409	266419	266421	266422	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" And my boy promised he would n't tell , "
266497	266518	266520	266521	the lady	2586	" He has got a good brother , that is sure . Let us hope for good times for him , "
266523	266533	266534	266534	George	694	" The Danes always come pour qui scait attendre , "
266542	266568	266570	266572	the pleased mother	12617	" What , you heard that ? Ah , George ! my Theo is an Ah ! never mind what she is , George Warrington , "
266578	266598	266570	266572	the pleased mother	12617	" Bah ! I am going to make a gaby of myself , as I did at the tragedy . "
266803	266830	266831	266832	Mr. Warrington	694	" Could we have moved , sir , a month sooner , the fort was certainly ours , and the little army had never been defeated , "
266844	266863	266864	266866	the Royal Duke	12635	" I am told you saved yourself , sir , mainly by your knowledge of the French language , "
267001	267058	266994	266995	the Prince	2235	" I take the field immediately against the French , who , as you know , are threatening his Majesty 's Electoral dominions , If you have a mind to make the campaign with me , your skill in the language may be useful , and I hope we shall be more fortunate than poor Braddock ! "
267095	267098	267099	267099	he	694	" Sir , "
267102	267116	267099	267099	he	694	" your Royal Highness 's most kind proposal does me infinite honour , but "
267117	267123	267125	267126	the Prince	2235	" But what , sir ? "
267132	267218	267099	267099	he	694	" But I have entered myself of the Temple , to study our laws , and to fit myself for my duties at home . If my having been wounded in the service of my country be any claim on your kindness , I would humbly ask that my brother , who knows the French language as well as myself , and has far more strength , courage , and military genius , might be allowed to serve your Royal Highness ; in the place of "
267219	267226	267234	267235	the monarch	12114	" Enough , enough , sir ! "
267237	267265	267229	267235	the justly irritated son of the monarch	12646	" What ? I offer you a favour , and you hand it over to your brother ? Wait , sir , till I offer you another ! "
267293	267310	267312	267313	General Lambert	975	" Oh , George ! oh , George ! Here 's a pretty kettle of fish ! "
267545	267569	267571	267572	Lady Maria	690	" If you intend to insult George , at least you had best take care that his brother Harry is out of hearing ! "
267592	267599	267601	267602	my lord	2193	" Ta , ta , ta ! "
267604	267621	267601	267602	my lord	2193	" No more of this squabbling ! We ca n't be all warriors in the family ! "
267622	267634	267636	267636	Maria	690	" I never heard your lordship laid claim to be one ! "
267638	267709	267636	267636	Maria	690	" Never , my dear ; quite the contrary ! Will is our champion , and one is quite enough in the house . So I dare say with the two Mohocks ; George is the student , and Harry is the fighting man . When you intended to quarrel , Will , what a pity it was you had not George , instead of t'other , to your hand ! "
267710	267720	267722	267722	Will	913	" Your lordship 's hand is famous at piquet , "
267726	267733	267735	267736	my lord	2193	" It is a pretty one , "
267746	267803	267735	267736	my lord	2193	" My Lord Hervey 's glove and mine were of a size . Yes , my hand , as you say , is more fitted for cards than for war . Yours , my Lady Castlewood , is pretty dexterous , too . How I bless the day when you bestowed it on my lamented father ! "
267906	267918	267919	267919	she	780	" You will never make your fortune at court , nephew ! "
267938	267947	267949	267950	Mr. George	694	" It was never my wish , madam , "
267958	268007	267949	267950	Mr. George	694	" Your wish was to help Harry ? You might hereafter have been of service to your brother , had you accepted the Duke 's offer . Princes do not love to have their favours refused , and I do n't wonder that his Royal Highness was offended . "
268008	268016	268017	268017	George	694	" General Lambert said the same thing , "
268024	268060	268017	268017	George	694	" and I see now that I was wrong . But you must please remember that I had never seen a court before , and I suppose I am scarce likely to shine in one . "
268061	268071	268073	268074	the aunt	5399	" I think possibly not , my good nephew , "
268079	268084	268086	268086	George	694	" And what then ? "
268088	268223	268086	268086	George	694	" I never had ambition for that kind of glory , and can make myself quite easy without it . When his Royal Highness spoke to me most kindly , as I own my thought was , I shall make a very bad soldier , and my brother would be a very good one . He has a hundred good qualities for the profession , in which I am deficient ; and would have served a Commanding Officer far better than I ever could . Say the Duke is in battle , and his horse is shot , as my poor chief 's was at home , would he not be better for a beast that had courage and strength to bear him anywhere , than with one that could not carry his weight ? "
268224	268242	268244	268246	the old lady	2505	" Au fait . His Royal Highness 's charger must be a strong one , my dear ! "
268248	268252	268244	268246	the old lady	2505	" Expende Hannibalem , "
268260	268267	268244	268246	the old lady	2505	" Our Hannibal weighs no trifle . "
268268	268282	268283	268284	the Baroness	2319	" I do n't quite follow you , sir , and your Hannibal , "
268287	268304	268305	268305	George	694	" When Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Lambert remonstrated with me as you have done , madam , "
268312	268513	268305	268305	George	694	" I made this same defence which I am making to you . I said I offered to the Prince the best soldier in the family , and the two gentlemen allowed that my blunder at least had some excuse . Who knows but that they may set me right with his Royal Highness ? The taste I have had of battles has shown me how little my genius inclines that way . We saw the Scotch play which everybody is talking about t'other night . And when the hero , young Norval , said how he longed to follow to the field some warlike lord , I thought to myself , ' how like my Harry is to him , except that he doth not brag . ' Harry is pining now for a red coat , and if we do n't mind , will take the shilling . He has the map of Germany for ever under his eyes , and follows the King of Prussia everywhere . He is not afraid of men or gods . As for me , I love my books and quiet best , and to read about battles in Homer or Lucan . "
268514	268544	268546	268548	Madame de Bernstein	780	" Then what made a soldier of you at all , my dear ? And why did you not send Harry with Mr. Braddock , instead of going yourself ? "
268550	268560	268562	268562	George	694	" My mother loved her younger son the best , "
268566	268608	268562	268562	George	694	" Besides , with the enemy invading our country , it was my duty , as the head of our family , to go on the campaign . Had I been a Scotchman twelve years ago , I should have been a "
268609	268623	268625	268627	the old lady	2505	" Hush , sir ! or I shall be more angry than ever ! "
268680	268686	268687	268688	her ladyship	19678	" I should have thought , "
268691	268756	268687	268688	her ladyship	19678	" from my sister Esmond Warrington 's letter , that my brother 's widow was a woman of good sense and judgment , and that she had educated her sons in a becoming manner . But what , Sir Miles , what , my dear Thomas Claypool , can we think of an education which has resulted so lamentably for both these young men ? "
268757	268793	268795	268796	Mr. Claypool	1368	" The elder seems to know a power of Latin , though , and speaks the French and the German too . I heard him with the Hanover Envoy , at the Baroness 's rout , "
268798	268835	268795	268796	Mr. Claypool	1368	" The French he jabbered quite easy : and when he was at a loss for the High Dutch , he and the Envoy began in Latin , and talked away till all the room stared . "
268836	268848	268850	268852	the virtuous matron	11168	" It is not language , but principles , Thomas Claypool ! "
268854	268914	268850	268852	the virtuous matron	11168	" What must Mr. Warrington 's principles be , when he could reject an offer made him by his Prince ? Can he speak the High Dutch ? So much the more ought he to have accepted his Royal Highness 's condescension , and made himself useful in the campaign ! Look at our son , look at Miles ! "
268915	268926	268928	268928	papa	19857	" Hold up thy head , Miley , my boy ! "
268930	268997	268928	268928	papa	19857	" I trust , Sir Miles , that , as a member of the House of Commons , as an English gentleman , you will attend his Royal Highness 's levee to - morrow , and say , if such an offer had been made to us for that child , we would have taken it , though our boy is but ten years of age . "
268998	269013	269015	269015	papa	19857	" Faith , Miley , thou wouldst make a good little drummer or fifer ! "
269017	269028	269015	269015	papa	19857	" Shouldst like to be a little soldier , Miley ? "
269029	269055	269057	269058	the matron	7970	" Anything , sir , anything ! a Warrington ought to be ready at any moment to have himself cut in pieces for his sovereign ! "
269135	269152	269127	269128	the Prince	2235	" Nobody ever supposed that Sir Miles Warrington would ever refuse any place offered to him . "
270309	270329	270303	270303	he	770	" You did well , sir , not to come with me when I asked you in the spring . "
270330	270339	270303	270303	he	770	" I was sorry , then , sir , "
270350	270358	270340	270341	Mr. Warrington	694	" but I am more sorry now . "
270365	270371	270361	270362	the Prince	2235	" Thank you , sir , "
270488	270499	270465	270466	Mr. Lambert	1000	" Harry Warrington ! your brother is like yonder lion . "
270500	270509	270511	270511	Harry	701	" Because he is as brave as one , "
270513	270519	270521	270521	George	694	" Because I respect virgins ! "
270525	270588	270521	270521	George	694	" Because you are a stupid lion . Because you turn your back on the East , and absolutely salute the setting sun . Why , child , what earthly good can you get by being civil to a man in hopeless dudgeon and disgrace ? Your uncle will be more angry with you than ever and so am I , sir . "
271613	271625	271627	271627	papa	19857	" Why , how savage the little thing is with him ! "
271668	271675	271677	271677	mamma	19850	" Her conduct is perfectly abominable ! "
271691	271692	271677	271677	mamma	19850	" "
271710	271714	271700	271700	she	993	" says Theo , "
271765	271766	271792	271792	he	19783	" "
271774	271779	271792	271792	he	19783	" answers Mrs. Lambert , "
271808	271809	271801	271802	any one	6659	" "
271815	271823	271810	271811	Very few	12844	" owns Theo , with a blush . "
271834	271835	271838	271838	nobody	20980	" "
271842	271846	271838	271838	nobody	20980	" Theo acknowledges . "
271851	271852	271838	271838	nobody	20980	" "
271872	271873	271865	271866	Mr. George	694	" "
271880	271881	271865	271866	Mr. George	694	" "
271899	271903	271896	271896	his	694	" says Theo ; "
272185	272186	272174	272174	I	0	" "
272197	272206	272210	272210	mamma	19850	" asks Mrs. Lambert . And Theo replies , "
272219	272717	272212	272212	I	0	" I here fancy osculations , palpitations , and exit Miss Theo , blushing like a rose . Why had she stopped in her sentence ? Because mamma was looking at her so oddly . And why was mamma looking at her so oddly ? And why had she looked after Mr. George when he was going away , and looked for him when he was coming ? Ah , and why do cheeks blush , and why do roses bloom ? Old Time is still a - flying . Old spring and bud time ; old summer and bloom time ; old autumn and seed time ; old winter time , when the cracking , shivering old tree - tops are bald or covered with snow . A few minutes after George arrived , Theo would come downstairs with a fluttering heart , may be , and a sweet nosegay in her cheeks , just culled , as it were , fresh in his honour ; and I suppose she must have been constantly at that window which commanded the street , and whence she could espy his generosity to the sweep , or his purchases from the apple - woman . But if it was Harry who knocked , she remained in her own apartment with her work or her books , sending her sister to receive the young gentleman , or her brothers when the elder was at home from college , or Doctor Crusius from the Chartreux gave the younger leave to go home . And what good eyes Theo must have had and often in the evening , too to note the difference between Harry 's yellow hair and George 's dark locks and between their figures , though they were so like that people continually were mistaking one for the other brother . Now it is certain that Theo never mistook one or t'other ; and that Hetty , for her part , was not in the least excited , or rude , or pert , when she found the black - haired gentleman in her mother 's drawing - room . Our friends could come when they liked to Mr. Lambert 's house , and stay as long as they chose ; and , one day , he of the golden locks was sitting on a couch there , in an attitude of more than ordinary idleness and despondency , when who should come down to him but Miss Hetty ? I say it was a most curious thing though the girls would have gone to the rack rather than own any collusion , that when Harry called , Hetty appeared ; when George arrived , Theo somehow came ; and so , according to the usual dispensation , it was Miss Lambert , junior , who now arrived to entertain the younger Virginian . After usual ceremonies and compliments we may imagine that the lady says to the gentleman : "
272733	272734	272737	272737	Hetty	993	" "
272739	272743	272737	272737	Hetty	993	" says he , "
272827	272828	272817	272817	I	0	" "
272849	272858	272859	272859	I	0	" says Miss Hetty , tossing her head . "

272980	272984	272977	272978	the master	2111	" cries Hetty . "
272996	273002	272985	272985	I	0	" Harry says , humbly . "
273061	273084	273086	273086	my	0	" Hetty drubbed with her little foot , and looked at the young man sitting before her strong , idle , melancholy . "
273096	273103	273086	273086	my	0	" she was minded to say . "
273127	273131	273132	273132	His	1368	" she asked . "
273138	273143	273132	273132	His	1368	" Harry answered simply , "
273216	273217	273213	273213	I	0	" "
273234	273238	273239	273239	I	0	" cries Het . "

273424	273425	273409	273414	a fine , noble young gentleman	12897	" "

273465	273470	273448	273448	I	0	" asks the gentleman . "
273476	273481	273482	273482	I	0	" says Miss Hetty . "
273621	273659	273660	273660	I	0	" And , so speaking , this young person strode about the room , wearing a most courageous military aspect , and looking as bold as Joan of Arc . Harry beheld her with a tender admiration . "
273663	273667	273660	273660	I	0	" says he , "
273691	273692	273693	273693	Wounds	1544	" "
273699	273705	273693	273693	Wounds	1544	" cries the little maid . "
273788	273789	273747	273747	George	694	" "
273796	273801	273747	273747	George	694	" says Harry dutifully . "
273827	273853	273823	273823	she	12924	" ' Alas ! why did not Heaven these members frail With lively force and vigour strengthen , so That I this silken gown ... ' "
273854	273858	273861	273861	Harry	1368	" Silken gown ? "
273869	273888	273861	273861	Harry	1368	" Well , sir , I know ' tis but Calimanco ; but so it is in the book "
273952	273985	273986	273986	Harry	1368	" Fight ? Yes , that I would ! Why are both my brothers to be parsons , I say ? One of my papa 's children ought to be a soldier ! "
274020	274023	274025	274025	he	1368	" Why , "
274032	274102	274025	274025	he	1368	" I think here is a finger nigh as big as your arm . How would you stand up before a great , strong man ? I should like to see a man try and injure you , though ; I should just like to see him ! You little , delicate , tender creature ! Do you suppose any scoundrel would dare to do anything unkind to you ? "
274527	274553	274555	274556	Miss Hester	993	" Pray what is the use of having a strong hand if you only use it to hold a skein of silk for my mother ? "
274558	274641	274555	274556	Miss Hester	993	" and what is the good of being ever so strong in a drawing - room ? Nobody wants you to throw anybody out of window , Harry ! A strong man , indeed ! I suppose there 's a stronger at Bartholomew Fair . James Wolfe is not a strong man . He seems quite weakly and ill . When he was here last he was coughing the whole time , and as pale as if he had seen a ghost . "
274642	274657	274659	274659	Harry	701	" I never could understand why a man should be frightened at a ghost , "
274661	274671	274673	274676	the pert young lady	12947	" Pray , have you seen one , sir ? "
274678	274735	274737	274737	Harry	701	" No . I thought I did once at home when we were boys ; but it was only Nathan in his night - shirt ; but I was n't frightened when I thought he was a ghost . I believe there 's no such things . Our nurses tell a pack of lies about 'em , "
274741	274752	274737	274737	Harry	701	" George was a little frightened ; but then he 's "
274757	274763	274765	274765	Hetty	993	" Then George is what ? "
274767	274827	274765	274765	Hetty	993	" George is different from me , that 's all . Our mother 's a bold woman as ever you saw , but she screams at seeing a mouse always does ca n't help it . It 's her nature . So , you see , perhaps my brother ca n't bear ghosts . I do n't mind 'em . "
274828	274842	274765	274765	Hetty	993	" George always says you would have made a better soldier than he . "
274843	274970	274972	274974	the miserable fellow	12948	" So I think I should , if I had been allowed to try . But he can do a thousand things better than me , or anybody else in the world . Why did n't he let me volunteer on Braddock 's expedition ? I might have got knocked on the head , and then I should have been pretty much as useful as I am now , and then I should n't have ruined myself , and brought people to point at me and say that I had disgraced the name of Warrington . Why may n't I go on this expedition , and volunteer like Sir John Armytage ? Oh , Hetty ! I 'm a miserable fellow that 's what I am , "
274983	274993	274994	274994	he	12948	" I wish I had never come to Europe , "
274998	275010	274994	274994	he	12948	" What a compliment to us ! Thank you , Harry ! "
275025	275035	275022	275022	she	12951	" Are you are you thinking of going home ? "
275036	275288	275022	275022	she	12951	" And have all Virginia jeering at me ! There 's not a gentleman there that would n't , except one , and him my mother does n't like . I should be ashamed to go home now , I think . You do n't know my mother , Hetty . I ai n't afraid of most things ; but , somehow , I am of her . What shall I say to her , when she says , ' Harry , where 's your patrimony ? ' ' Spent , mother , ' I shall have to say . ' What have you done with it ? ' ' Wasted it , mother , and went to prison after . ' ' Who took you out of prison ? ' ' Brother George , ma'am , he took me out of prison ; and now I 'm come back , having done no good for myself , with no profession , no prospects , no nothing only to look after negroes , and be scolded at home ; or to go to sleep at sermons ; or to play at cards , and drink , and fight cocks at the taverns about . ' How can I look the gentlemen of the country in the face ? I 'm ashamed to go home in this way , I say . I must and will do something ! What shall I do , Hetty ? Ah ! what shall I do ? "
275289	275372	275022	275022	she	12951	" Do ? What did Mr. Wolfe do at Louisbourg ? Ill as he was , and in love as we knew him to be , he did n't stop to be nursed by his mother , Harry , or to dawdle with his sweetheart . He went on the King 's service , and hath come back covered with honour . If there is to be another great campaign in America , papa says he is sure of a great command . "
275373	275397	275399	275399	Harry	701	" I wish he would take me with him , and that a ball would knock me on the head and finish me , "
275401	275448	275399	275399	Harry	701	" You speak to me , Hetty , as though it were my fault that I am not in the army , when you know I would give give , forsooth , what have I to give ? yes ! my life to go on service ! "
275449	275453	275455	275456	Miss Hetty	993	" Life indeed ! "
275465	275479	275481	275481	Harry	701	" You do n't seem to think that of much value , Hetty , "
275485	275522	275481	275481	Harry	701	" No more it is to anybody . I 'm a poor useless fellow . I 'm not even free to throw it away as I would like , being under orders here and at home . "
275523	275531	275533	275534	Miss Hetty	993	" Orders indeed ! Why under orders ? "
275536	275633	275533	275534	Miss Hetty	993	" Are n't you tall enough , and old enough , to act for yourself , and must you have George for a master here , and your mother for a schoolmistress at home ? If I were a man , I would do something famous before I was two - and - twenty years old , that I would ! I would have the world speak of me . I would n't dawdle at apron - strings . I would n't curse my fortune I 'd make it . I vow and declare I would ! "
275653	275669	275670	275670	he	701	" No negro on our estate is more a slave than I am , Hetty , "
275681	275916	275670	275670	he	701	" but then , Miss Lambert , we do n't reproach the poor fellow for not being free . That is n't generous . At least , that is n't the way I understand honour . Perhaps with women it 's different , or I may be wrong , and have no right to be hurt at a young girl telling me what my faults are . Perhaps my faults are not my faults only my cursed luck . You have been talking ever so long about this gentleman volunteering , and that man winning glory , and cracking up their courage as if I had none of my own . I suppose , for the matter of that , I 'm as well provided as other gentlemen . I do n't brag but I 'm not afraid of Mr. Wolfe , nor of Sir John Armytage , nor of anybody else that ever I saw . How can I buy a commission when I 've spent my last shilling , or ask my brother for more who has already halved with me ? A gentleman of my rank ca n't go a common soldier else , by Jupiter , I would ! And if a ball finished me , I suppose Miss Hetty Lambert would n't be very sorry . It is n't kind , Hetty I did n't think it of you . "
275917	275925	275927	275929	the young lady	6270	" What is it I have said ? "
275931	275982	275670	275670	he	701	" I have only said Sir John Armytage has volunteered , and Mr. Wolfe has covered himself with honour , and you begin to scold me ! How can I help it if Mr. Wolfe is brave and famous ? Is that any reason you should be angry , pray ? "
275983	275990	275992	275992	Harry	701	" I did n't say angry , "
275996	276003	275992	275992	Harry	701	" I said I was hurt . "
276004	276057	275670	275670	he	701	" Oh , indeed ! I thought such a little creature as I am could n't hurt anybody ! I 'm sure ' tis mighty complimentary to me to say that a young lady whose arm is no bigger than your little finger can hurt such a great strong man as you ! "
276058	276068	276069	276071	the young man	2122	" I scarce thought you would try , Hetty , "
276074	276091	276069	276071	the young man	2122	" You see , I 'm not used to this kind of welcome in this house . "
276092	276101	275670	275670	he	701	" What is it , my poor boy ? "
276126	276138	276140	276140	Hetty	993	" Oh , we have heard the story before , mamma ! "
276144	276178	276140	276140	Hetty	993	" Harry is making his old complaint of having nothing to do . And he is quite unhappy ; and he is telling us so over and over again , that 's all . "
276179	276208	276210	276210	mamma	894	" So are you hungry over and over again , my dear ! Is that a reason why your papa and I should leave off giving you dinner ? "
276216	276232	276210	276210	mamma	894	" Will you stay and have ours , Harry ? ' Tis just three o'clock ! "
276244	276264	276266	276267	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" My husband dines abroad . We are but three women , so you will have a dull dinner , "
276269	276285	276287	276288	Madam Pert	1550	" We shall have a gentleman to enliven us , mamma , I dare say ! "
276437	276452	276454	276454	Hetty	993	" Oh , my dear , you need not nod and wink at me ! "
276456	276500	276454	276454	Hetty	993	" Mamma asked Harry on purpose to enliven us , and I am talking until he begins , just like the fiddles at the playhouse , you know , Theo ! First the fiddles . Then the play . Pray begin , Harry ! "
276501	276504	276506	276506	mamma	19850	" Hester ! "
276508	276551	276506	276506	mamma	19850	" I merely asked Harry to entertain us . You said yourself , mother , that we were only three women , and the dinner would be dull for a gentleman ; unless , indeed , he chose to be very lively . "
276552	276572	276575	276575	Harry	701	" I 'm not that on most days and , Heaven knows , on this day less than most , "
276577	276633	276575	276575	Harry	701	" Why on this day less than another ? Tuesday is as good a day to be lively as Wednesday . The only day when we must n't be lively is Sunday . Well , you know it is , ma'am ! We must n't sing , nor dance , nor do anything on Sunday . "
276970	276987	276988	276988	George	694	" ' I send my best duty and regards to Mrs. Lambert and the ladies , ' "
276991	277062	276988	276988	George	694	" ' and humbly beg to present to Miss Theo this nosegay of lilacs , which she says she loves in the early spring . You must not thank me for them , please , but the gardener of Bedford House , with whom I have made great friends by presenting him with some dried specimens of a Virginian plant which some ladies do n't think as fragrant as lilacs . "
277132	277133	277123	277123	she	1552	" "
277151	277155	277156	277156	You	0	" says Theo . "
277168	277218	277220	277220	Spencer	1513	" remarks papa . Little Het looks up from her dismal corner with a faint smile of humour . Theo 's secret is a secret for nobody in the house , it seems . Can any young people guess what it is ? Our young lady continues to read : "

277457	277484	277446	277446	he	1003	" cries papa to Hetty , who only gives a little sigh , puts her hand in her father 's hand , and then withdraws it . "
277536	277561	277568	277568	they	12994	" ' I have had a fine long day , and all to myself . What do you think of Harry playing truant ? ' "
277594	277671	277575	277575	they	12994	" ' I suppose Carpezan wearied the poor fellow 's existence out . Certain it is he has been miserable for weeks past ; and a change of air and scene may do him good . This morning , quite early , he came to my room , and told me he had taken a seat in the Portsmouth machine , and proposed to go to the Isle of Wight , to the army there . ' "
277688	277918	277675	277675	Hetty	993	" ' And a little portion of it , namely , the thirty - second regiment , is commanded by Lieutenant - Colonel Richmond Webb the nephew of the famous old General under whom my grandfather Esmond served in the great wars of Marlborough . Mr. Webb met us at our uncle 's , accosting us very politely , and giving us an invitation to visit him at his regiment . Let my poor brother go and listen to his darling music of fife and drum ! He bade me tell the ladies that they should hear from him . I kiss their hands , and go to dress for dinner , at the Star and Garter , in Pall Mall . We are to have Mr. Soame Jenyns , Mr. Cambridge , Mr. Walpole , possibly , if he is not too fine to dine in a tavern ; a young Irishman , a Mr. Bourke , who they say is a wonder of eloquence and learning in fine , all the wits of Mr. Dodsley 's shop . Quick , Gumbo , a coach , and my French grey suit ! And if gentlemen ask me , ' Who gave you that sprig of lilac you wear on your heart - side ? ' I shall call a bumper , and give Lilac for a toast .

278383	278393	278394	278394	she	2597	" What is the matter with you , sir , "
278406	278427	278394	278394	she	2597	" that you have such a dismal countenance ? Chaplain , that last game makes us even , I think ! "
278435	278455	278456	278456	he	701	" I am going on a journey : I am come to bid you good - bye , aunt , "
278465	278488	278456	278456	he	701	" On a journey ! Are you going home to America ? I mark the king , Chaplain , and play him . "

278561	278609	278557	278557	he	701	" Indeed ! We shall be inconsolable without you ! Unless you have a spade , Mr. Sampson , the game is mine . Good - bye , my child ! No more about your journey at present : tell us about it when you come back ! "
278630	278638	278640	278641	the chaplain	4987	" Something grave has happened , madam , "
278643	278802	278640	278641	the chaplain	4987	" Oh ! The boy is always getting into scrapes ! I suppose he has been falling in love with one of those country girls what are their names , Lamberts ? with whom he is ever dawdling about . He has been doing no good here for some time . I am disappointed in him , really quite grieved about him I will take two cards , if you please again ? quite grieved . What do you think they say of his cousin the Miss Warrington who made eyes at him when she thought he was a prize they say the King has remarked her , and the Yarmouth is creving with rage . He , be ! those methodistical Warringtons ! They are not a bit less worldly than their neighbours ; and , old as he is , if the Grand Seignior throws his pocket - handkerchief , they will jump to catch it ! "
278803	278815	278817	278818	the chaplain	4987	" Ah , madam ; how your ladyship knows the world ! "
278820	278828	278817	278818	the chaplain	4987	" I propose , if you please ! "
278829	278908	278640	278641	the chaplain	4987	" I have lived long enough in it , Mr. Sampson , to know something of it . ' Tis sadly selfish , my dear sir , sadly selfish ; and everybody is struggling to pass his neighbour ! No , I ca n't give you any more cards . You have n't the king ? I play queen , knave , and a ten , a sadly selfish world , indeed . And here comes my chocolate ! "

278960	279162	278957	278957	he	5795	" what a miserable fellow I am , and what a spendthrift of my life I have been ! I sit silent with George and his friends . I am not clever and witty as he is . I am only a burthen to him ; and , if I would help him ever so much , do n't know how . My dear Aunt Lambert 's kindness never tires , but I begin to be ashamed of trying it . Why , even Hetty ca n't help turning on me ; and when she tells me I am idle and should be doing something , ought I to be angry ? The rest have left me . There 's my cousins and uncle and my lady my aunt , they have shown me the cold shoulder this long time . They did n't even ask me to Norfolk when they went down to the country , and offer me so much as a day 's partridge - shooting . I ca n't go to Castlewood after what has happened ; I should break that scoundrel William 's bones ; and , faith , am well out of the place altogether . "

By his death , she becomes heiress of his lands . ' Tis said a greedy uncle brought her hither ; and fast immured the lady against her will . The damsel shall herself pronounce her fate to stay a cloistered sister of Saint Mary 's , or to return to home and liberty , as Lady Sybil , Baroness of . "
282172	282217	282167	282167	She	13157	" There is no Lady Sybil in this house : of which every inmate is under your protection , and sworn to go free . The Sister Agnes was a nun professed , and what was her land and wealth revert to this Order . "

282292	282306	282289	282290	Captain Ulric	1593	" but rather some plump , smiling , red - lipped maid like like "
282332	282371	282327	282329	the stern Abbess	13185	" Silence , fellow , with thy ribald talk ! The lady , warrior , whom you ask of me is passed away from sin , temptation , vanity , and three days since our Sister Agnes died . "
282596	282605	282607	282608	Mr. Warrington	694	" The convent is suppressed with a vengeance , "
282610	282664	282607	282608	Mr. Warrington	694	" We end our first act with the burning of the place , the roars of triumph of the soldiery , and the outcries of the nuns . They had best go change their dresses immediately , for they will have to be court ladies in the next act as you will see . "
283085	283101	283103	283104	Mr. Johnson	1073	" Oh , stay I have it I know your story , sir , now , "
283106	283130	283103	283104	Mr. Johnson	1073	" ' Tis in ' Meteranus , ' in the Theatrum Universum . I read it in Oxford as a boy Carpezanus or Carpzoff "
283131	283138	283140	283141	Mr. Warrington	694	" That is the fourth act , "
283356	283362	283363	283363	he	2866	" But whatever came afterwards ? "
283366	283399	283363	283363	he	2866	" I remember in the Theatrum , Carpezan is said to have been taken into favour again by Count Mansfield , and doubtless to have murdered other folks on the reformed side . "
283647	283654	283663	283665	the old warrior	13258	" What is this field called ? "
283655	283661	283663	283665	the old warrior	13258	" Mohacz , my liege ! "
283671	283685	283663	283665	the old warrior	13258	" Ere set of sun , Mohacz will see a battle bravely won . "
283837	283842	283844	283846	the grim Vizier	13271	" ' Tis well , "
283848	283875	283844	283846	the grim Vizier	13271	" our invincible Emperor surveys the battle from yonder tower . At the end of the day , he will know how to reward your valour . "
284155	284160	284161	284161	he	1553	" An equal fight ! "
284164	284195	284161	284161	he	1553	" A traitor against a traitor ! Stand , King Louis ! False King , false knight , false friend by this glove in my helmet , I challenge you ! "
284312	284316	284317	284317	he	13293	" Christian renegade ! "
284320	284347	284317	284317	he	13293	" Allah has given us a great victory . The arms of the Sublime Emperor are everywhere triumphant . The Christian King is slain by you . "
284348	284361	284363	284363	Ulric	1593	" Peace to his soul ! He died like a good knight , "
284371	284378	284379	284381	the grim Vizier	13271	" In this day 's battle , "
284384	284406	284379	284381	the grim Vizier	13271	" no man hath comported himself more bravely than you . You are made Bassa of Transylvania ! Advance bowmen Fire ! "
284416	284436	284438	284439	grim Vizier	1610	" Bassa of Transylvania , you were a traitor to your King , who lies murdered by your hand ! "
284441	284476	284438	284439	grim Vizier	1610	" You contributed more than any soldier to this day 's great victory . ' Tis thus my sublime Emperor meetly rewards you . Sound trumpets ! We march for Vienna to - night ! "
284496	284502	284482	284482	Carpezan	1553	" Forgive me , Ulric ! "
284524	284538	284512	284512	he	694	" What say you , sir ? Is there any chance for me ? "
284709	284712	284714	284714	he	13307	" Fire ! "
284766	284783	284785	284786	Mr. Johnson	1073	" Nay , sir , there was an utter annihilation of the Hungarian army at Mohacz , "
284788	284836	284785	284786	Mr. Johnson	1073	" and Ulric must take his knock on the head with the rest . He could only be saved by flight , and you would n't have a hero run away ! Pronounce sentence of death against Captain Ulric , but kill him with honours of war . "
284932	284941	284942	284942	he	1073	" Up to the death of the heroine , "
284945	285070	284942	284942	he	1073	" I am frankly with you , sir . And I may speak , as a playwright who have killed my own heroine , and had my share of the plausus in the atro . To hear your own lines nobly delivered to an applauding house , is indeed a noble excitement . I like to see a young man of good name and lineage who condescends to think that the Tragic Muse is not below his advances . It was to a sordid roof that I invited her , and I asked her to rescue me from poverty and squalor . Happy you , sir , who can meet her upon equal terms , and can afford to marry her without a portion ! "
285071	285090	285092	285093	Mr. Spencer	1513	" I doubt whether the greatest genius is not debased who has to make a bargain with Poetry , "
285095	285100	285092	285093	Mr. Spencer	1513	" Nay , sir , "
285105	285187	285101	285102	Mr. Johnson	1073	" I doubt if many a great genius would work at all without bribes and necessities ; and so a man had better marry a poor Muse for good and all , for better or worse , than dally with a rich one . I make you my compliment to your play , Mr. Warrington , and if you want an introduction to the stage , shall be very happy if I can induce my friend Mr. Garrick to present you . "
285188	285196	285198	285201	the florid Mr. Figtree	1613	" Mr. Garrick shall be his sponsor , "
285203	285225	285198	285201	the florid Mr. Figtree	1613	" Melpomene shall be his godmother , and he shall have the witches ' caldron in Macbeth for a christening font . "
285226	285236	285238	285241	the man of letters	13316	" Sir , I neither said font nor godmother ! "
285243	285362	285238	285241	the man of letters	13316	" I would have no play contrary to morals or religion nor , as I conceive , is Mr. Warrington 's piece otherwise than friendly to them . Vice is chastised , as it should be , even in kings , though perhaps we judge of their temptations too lightly . Revenge is punished as not to be lightly exercised by our limited notion of justice . It may have been Carpezan 's wife who perverted the King , and not the King who led the woman astray . At any rate , Louis is rightly humiliated for his crime , and the Renegade most justly executed for his . I wish you a good afternoon , gentlemen ! "
285554	285586	285545	285545	Theo	987	" Read it , indeed ! Who can read a poem better than the author who feels it in his heart ? And George had his whole heart in the piece ! "
285614	285629	285631	285632	the General	3644	" I think Harry would look very well in your figure of a Prince , "
285634	285660	285631	285632	the General	3644	" That scene where he takes leave of his wife before departing for the wars reminds me of your brother 's manner not a little . "
285661	285678	285680	285681	Miss Theo	987	" Oh , papa ! surely Mr. Warrington himself would act the Prince 's part best ! "
285683	285694	285696	285700	the father of the house	13336	" And be deservedly slain in battle at the end ? "
285702	285722	285724	285725	Miss Theo	987	" I did not say that , only that Mr. George would make a very good Prince , papa ! "
285727	285750	285724	285725	Miss Theo	987	" In which case he would find a suitable Princess , I have no doubt . What news of your brother Harry ? "
285793	285807	285809	285809	George	694	" Let us hear what Mr. Truant says for himself , Aunt Lambert ! "
285852	285858	285860	285860	George	694	" Here is the letter , "
285868	285876	285860	285860	George	694	" RYDE , June 1 , 1758 . "
286159	286246	286254	286254	you	13359	" I scarce venture to write to our mother to tell her of this step . Will you , who have a coxing tongue will wheadle any one , write to her as soon as you have finisht the famous tradgedy ? Will you give my affectionate respects to dear General Lambert and ladies ? and if any accident should happen , I know you will take care of poor Gumbo as belonging to my dearest best George 's most affectionate brother , HENRY E. WARRINGTON . "
286312	286313	286298	286298	she	4620	" "
286338	286387	286388	286388	He	1623	" He has not read the last words with a very steady voice . Mr. Lambert sits silent , though not a little moved . Theo and her mother look at one another ; but Hetty remains with a cold face and a stricken heart . She thinks , "
286405	286405	286401	286401	I	0	"
286862	286872	286852	286852	she	993	" Yes , if you please , dear papa ! "
286940	286947	286935	286936	the parson	2199	" Thou shalt do no murder , "
287105	287115	287117	287117	she	993	" Have n't you heard of people , Theo , "
287119	287145	287117	287117	she	993	" whose hair has grown grey in a single night ? I should n't wonder if mine did , should n't wonder in the least . "
287157	287175	287177	287177	Theo	987	" Hetty dear , you used not to be so nervous when papa was away in Minorca , "
287179	287202	287204	287204	Hetty	993	" Ah , Theo ! one may very well see that George is not with the army , but safe at home , "
287795	287814	287774	287774	he	13455	" If every Frenchman had acted like me , you would not have landed at Cancale at all . "
288225	288231	288233	288233	he	13486	" Glorious news , ladies ! "
288243	288276	288233	288233	he	13486	" Our champion has come back . He has undergone all sorts of dangers , but has survived them all . He has seen dragons upon my word , he says so . "
288277	288288	288233	288233	he	13486	" Dragons ! What do you mean , Mr. Warrington ? "
288289	288306	288233	288233	he	13486	" But not killed any he says so , as you shall hear . He writes : "
288550	288562	288564	288564	George	1475	" There ! Did I not tell you there were dragons ? "
288568	288578	288580	288580	Hetty	993	" Mercy ! What can he mean by dragons ? "
288582	288620	288622	288622	papa	19857	" Immense , long - tailed monsters , with steel scales on their backs , who vomit fire , and gobble up a virgin a day . Have n't you read about them in The Seven Champions ? "
288624	288638	288622	288622	papa	19857	" Seeing St. George 's flag , I suppose , they slunk off . "
288639	288646	288648	288652	the little boy from Chartreux	13511	" I have read of 'em , "
288656	288688	288648	288652	the little boy from Chartreux	13511	" They like to eat women . One was going to eat Andromeda , you know , papa ; and Jason killed another , who was guarding the apple - tree . "
288689	288698	288699	288699	George	1475	" ... A few dragons on a hill , "
288702	288856	288699	288699	George	1475	" who rode away from us without engaging . We slept under canvass . We marched to St. Malo , and burned ever so many privateers there . And we went on board shipp again , without ever crossing swords with an enemy or meeting any except a few poor devils whom the troops plundered . Better luck next time ! This has n't been very much nor particular glorious : but I have liked it for my part . I have smelt powder , besides a good deal of rosn and pitch we burned . I 've seen the enemy ; have sleppt under canvass , and been dredful crowdid and sick at sea . I like it . My best compliments to dear Aunt Lambert , and tell Miss Hetty I was n't very much fritened when I saw the French horse . Your most affectionate brother , H. E. WARRINGTON . "
290023	290078	290012	290012	they	13583	" What do you say to your nephew now , pray ? Has he not taken twenty - one finest brass cannon ; flung a hundred and twenty iron guns into the water , seized twenty - seven ships in the harbour , and destroyed the basin and the two piers at the entrance ? "
291210	291216	291218	291218	Harry	701	" I can tell you , "
291220	291428	291218	291218	Harry	701	" we all had to run for it ; and when our line broke , it was he who could get to the boats who was most lucky . The French horse and foot pursued us down to the sea , and were mingled among us , cutting our men down , and bayoneting them on the ground . Poor Armytage was shot in advance of me , and fell ; and I took him up and staggered through the surf to a boat . It was lucky that the sailors in our boat were n't afraid ; for the shot were whistling about their ears , breaking the blades of their oars , and riddling their flag with shot ; but the officer in command was as cool as if he had been drinking a bowl of punch at Portsmouth , which we had one on landing , I can promise you . Poor Sir John was less lucky than me . He never lived to reach the ship , and the service has lost a fine soldier , and Miss Howe a true gentleman to her husband . There must be these casualties , you see ; and his brother gets the promotion the baronetcy . "
291429	291440	291442	291443	Miss Hetty	993	" It is of the poor lady I am thinking , "
291454	291501	291451	291451	his	13461	" and the King . Why did the King encourage Sir John Armytage to go ? A gentleman could not refuse a command from such a quarter . And now the poor gentleman is dead ! Oh , what a state his Majesty must be in ! "
291502	291518	291520	291520	papa	19857	" I have no doubt his Majesty will be in a deep state of grief , "
291526	291562	291563	291563	Hetty	993	" Now you are laughing ! Do you mean , sir , that when a gentleman dies in his service , almost at his feet , the King of England wo n't feel for him ? "
291566	291581	291563	291563	Hetty	993	" If I thought that , I vow I would be for the Pretender ! "
291582	291597	291599	291600	the General	3644	" The sauce - box would make a pretty little head for Temple Bar , "
291640	291643	291645	291645	he	3644	" No , "
291647	291711	291645	291645	he	3644	" my dear . Were kings to weep for every soldier , what a life you would make for them ! I think better of his Majesty than to suppose him so weak ; and , if Miss Hester Lambert got her Pretender , I doubt whether she would be any the happier . That family was never famous for too much feeling . "
291712	291744	291746	291748	the young lady	6270	" But if the King sent Harry I mean Sir John Armytage actually to the war in which he lost his life , ought n't his Majesty to repent very much ? "
291750	291779	291781	291782	the General	3644	" If Harry had fallen , no doubt the court would have gone into mourning : as it is , gentlemen and ladies were in coloured clothes yesterday , "
291784	291805	291807	291807	George	694	" Why should we not make bonfires for a defeat , and put on sackcloth and ashes after a victory ? "
291809	291829	291807	291807	George	694	" I protest I do n't want to thank Heaven for helping us to burn the ships at Cherbourg . "
291830	291888	291890	291890	Harry	701	" Yes you do , George ! Not that I have a right to speak , and you ai n't ever so much cleverer . But when your country wins you 're glad I know I am . When I run away before Frenchmen I 'm ashamed I ca n't help it , though I done it , "
291892	291909	291910	291910	he	701	" It do n't seem to me right somehow that Englishmen should have to do it , "
291940	291947	291949	291949	Harry	701	" ' Tis a bad business , "
291953	292121	291949	291949	Harry	701	" but ' tis lucky ' twas no worse . The story about the French is , that their Governor , the Duke of Aiguillon , was rather what you call a moistened chicken . Our whole retreat might have been cut off , only , to be sure , we ourselves were in a mighty hurry to move . The French local militia behaved famous , I am happy to say ; and there was ever so many gentlemen volunteers with 'em , who showed , as they ought to do , in the front . They say the Chevalier of Tour d'Auvergne engaged in spite of the Duke of Aiguillon 's orders . Officers told us , who came off with a list of our prisoners and wounded to General Bligh and Lord Howe . He is a lord now , since the news came of his brother 's death to home , George . He is a brave fellow , whether lord or commoner . "
292122	292144	292146	292147	Miss Hetty	993	" And his sister , who was to have married poor Sir John Armytage , think what her state must be ! "
292157	292162	292164	292165	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" And his mother ! "
292167	292246	292164	292165	Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Have you seen her ladyship 's address in the papers to the electors of Nottingham ? ' Lord Howe being now absent upon the publick service , and Lieutenant - Colonel Howe with his regiment at Louisbourg , it rests upon me to beg the favour of your votes and interests that Lieutenant - Colonel Howe may supply the place of his late brother as your representative in Parliament . ' Is n't this a gallant woman ? "
292247	292252	292254	292254	George	694	" A Laconic woman , "
292256	292274	292276	292277	the General	3644	" How can sons help being brave who have been nursed by such a mother as that ? "
292288	292316	292318	292318	George	694	" If one of us were to fall in defence of his country , we have a mother in Sparta who would think and write so too , "
292320	292333	292335	292336	Mr. Harry	701	" If Sparta is anywhere Virginia way , I reckon we have , "
292338	292364	292365	292365	he	701	" And to think that we should both of us have met the enemy , and both of us been whipped by him , brother ! "
292477	292481	292482	292482	his	701	" Little hand ! "
292490	292559	292482	292482	his	701	" thou shouldst not have been lifted against me ! It is ill to scorn any one , much more one who has been so devoted to you and all yours . I may not be over quick of wit , but in as far as the heart goes , I am the equal of the best , and the best of my heart your family has had . "
295114	295123	295109	295109	Warrington	694	" T 's letters , 1758 - 9 . "
295494	295506	295508	295508	Mountain	773	" I knew they would be setting their caps at him , "
295510	295538	295508	295508	Mountain	773	" They fancy that his wealth is as great as his estate . He does not say whether the young lady has money . I fear otherwise . "
295539	295553	295555	295556	Madam Esmond	683	" People would set their caps at him here , I dare say , "
295564	295587	295555	295556	Madam Esmond	683	" and try and catch Mr. Esmond Warrington for their own daughters , who are no richer than Miss Lambert may be . "
295588	295596	295598	295598	Mountain	773	" I suppose your ladyship means me ! "
295600	295623	295598	295598	Mountain	773	" My Fanny is poor , as you say ; and ' tis kind of you to remind me of her poverty ! "
295624	295651	295508	295508	Mountain	773	" I said people would set their caps at him . If the cap fits you , tant pis ! as my papa used to say . "
295652	295693	295598	295598	Mountain	773	" You think , madam , I am scheming to keep George for my daughter ? I thank you , on my word ! A good opinion you seem to have of us after the years we have lived together ! "
295694	295729	295731	295731	Madam	19815	" My dear Mountain , I know you much better than to suppose you could ever fancy your daughter would be a suitable match for a gentleman of Mr. Esmond 's rank and station , "
295737	295762	295731	295731	Madam	19815	" Fanny Parker was as good as Molly Benson at school , and Mr. Mountain 's daughter is as good as Mr. Lambert 's ! "
295768	295800	295763	295764	Mrs. Mountain	773	" Then you did think of marrying her to my son ! I shall write to Mr. Esmond Warrington , and say how sorry I am that you should be disappointed ! "
297094	297100	297102	297103	the General	3644	" Psha ! my dear ! "
297105	297150	297102	297103	the General	3644	" There is time enough in all conscience . Theo is not much more than seventeen ; George , if I mistake not , is under forty ; and , besides , he must have time to write to Virginia , and ask mamma . "
297151	297157	297102	297103	the General	3644	" But suppose she refuses ? "
297158	297170	297172	297173	the General	3644	" That will be a bad day for old and young , "
297175	297206	297208	297209	the father	2841	" Let us rather say , suppose she consents , my love ? I ca n't fancy anybody in the world refusing Theo anything she has set her heart on , "
297211	297223	297208	297209	the father	2841	" and I am sure ' tis bent upon this match . "
297724	297946	297721	297721	Warrington	701	" I had the honour of knowing the famous General Wolfe , and seeing much of him during his last stay in London . We had a subject of conversation then which was of unfailing interest to both of us , and I could not but admire Mr. Wolfe 's simplicity , his frankness , and a sort of glorious bravery which characterised him . He was much in love , and he wanted heaps and heaps of laurels to take to his mistress . ' If it be a sin to covet honour , ' he used to say with Harry the Fifth he was passionately fond of plays and poetry , ' I am the most offending soul alive . ' Surely on his last day he had a feast which was enough to satisfy the greediest appetite for glory . He hungered after it . He seemed to me not merely like a soldier going resolutely to do his duty , but rather like a knight in quest of dragons and giants . My own country has furnished of late a chief of a very different order , and quite an opposite genius . I scarce know which to admire most . The Briton 's chivalrous ardour , or the more than Roman constancy of our great Virginian . "

299629	299651	299660	299660	her	993	" You do n't suppose Mr. George would fall in love with that painted old creature who performed the chief part ? "
299663	299674	299660	299660	her	993	" She must be old enough to be his mother . "
299675	299699	299701	299701	mamma	894	" Pray , do you suppose that at our age nobody can care for us , or that we have no hearts left ? "
299706	299779	299701	299701	mamma	894	" I believe , or I may say , I hope and trust , your father thinks otherwise . He is , I imagine , perfectly satisfied , miss . He does not sneer at age , whatever little girls out of the schoolroom may do . And they had much better be back there , and they had much better remember what the fifth commandment is that they had , Hetty ! "
299780	299802	299804	299804	Hetty	993	" I did n't think I was breaking it by saying that an actress was as old as George 's mother , "
299806	299896	299804	299804	Hetty	993	" George 's mother is as old as I am , miss ! at least she was when we were at school . And Fanny Parker Mrs. Mountain who now is was seven months older , and we were in the French class together ; and I have no idea that our age is to be made the subject of remarks and ridicule by our children , and I will thank you to spare it , if you please ! Do you consider your mother too old , George ? "
299897	299911	299913	299913	George	694	" I am glad my mother is of your age , Aunt Lambert , "

George may , to be sure , and thank God for giving him the best little wife in all England . Yes , my dear , except when you were ill , you never caused me a heartache and happy is the man , I say , who wins thee ! "
301107	301147	301085	301085	she	993	" Is this all the news you have to give me ? Why , I have known it these months past . Do you think I have no eyes to see , and no ears to hear , indeed ? "
301325	301328	301330	301330	George	694	" Bah ! "
301332	301367	301330	301330	George	694	" I shall have three hundred pounds for my tragedy . I can easily write a play a year ; and if the worst comes to the worst , we can live on that . "

302760	302769	302770	302770	George	694	" About my play , to be sure , "

302855	302899	302832	302835	Dean Street Mrs. Lambert	1180	" What little tell - tale told you ? A mere casual rencontre the King goes there to study his parts , and Lady Maria happened to be crossing the garden to visit some of the other King 's servants at Kensington Palace . "
303044	303065	303041	303042	Mr. Lambert	1000	" I will give you the health of the Commander a glorious campaign , and a happy return to him ! "
303066	303078	303083	303083	her	14228	" Why do you not drink the toast , General James ! "
303086	303095	303097	303098	General Lambert	975	" He must not drink his own toast , "
303100	303108	303097	303098	General Lambert	975	" it is we must do that ! "
303168	303178	303180	303184	tender - hearted Mrs. Lambert	1180	" Perhaps he has been parting from his sweetheart , "

303338	303547	303336	303336	he	1036	" with the north and south branches of St. Lawrence on each side . Here 's the Low Town , with a battery how many guns was mounted there in our time , brother ? but at long shots from the St. Joseph shore you might play the same game . Here 's what they call the little river , the St. Charles , and a bridge of boats with a tete du pont over to the place of arms . Here 's the citadel , and here 's convents ever so many convents and the cathedral ; and here , outside the lines to the west and south , is what they call the Plains of Abraham where a certain little affair took place , do you remember , brother ? He and a young officer of the Rousillon regiment ca ca'd at each other for twenty minutes , and George pinked him , and then they jure'd each other an amitie eternelle . Well it was for George : for his second saved his life on that awful day of Braddock 's defeat . He was a fine little fellow , and I give his toast : Je bois a la sante du Chevalier de Florac ! "
303548	303560	303562	303563	Mr. Wolfe	1036	" What , can you speak French , too , Harry ? "

303583	303595	303581	303581	he	2122	" I can speak , but not so well as George . "
303596	303624	303626	303628	the elder brother	11535	" But he remembers the city , and can place the batteries , you see , and knows the ground a thousand times better than I do ! "

303956	304213	303954	303954	he	975	" with James Wolfe this morning , and our friend Harry was of the party . When he and the other guests were gone , I remained and talked with James about the great expedition on which he is going to sail . Would that his brave father had lived a few months longer to see him come back covered with honours from Louisbourg , and knowing that all England was looking to him to achieve still greater glory ! James is dreadfully ill in body so ill that I am frightened for him and not a little depressed in mind at having to part from the young lady whom he has loved so long . A little rest , he thinks , might have set his shattered frame up ; and to call her his has been the object of his life . But , great as his love is and he is as romantic as one of you young folks of seventeen , honour and duty are greater , and he leaves home , and wife , and ease , and health , at their bidding . Every man of honour would do the like ; every woman who loves him truly would buckle on his armour for him . James goes to take leave of his mother to - night ; and though she loves him devotedly , and is one of the tenderest women in the world , I am sure she will show no sign of weakness at his going away . "

An attack of palsy has visited his Royal Highness ; and pallida mors has just peeped in at his door , as it were , and said , ' I will call again . ' Tyrant as he was , this prince has been noble in disgrace ; and no king has ever had a truer servant than ours has found in his son . Why do I like the losing side always , and am I disposed to revolt against the winners ? Your famous Mr. P , your chief 's patron and discoverer , I have been to hear in the House of Commons twice or thrice . I revolt against his magniloquence . I wish some little David would topple over that swelling giant . His thoughts and his language are always attitudinising . I like Barry 's manner best , though the other is the more awful actor . "

Shall I set you in a rage of jealousy , and cause you to ask for leave to return to Europe ? Know , then , that though Carpezan is long since dead , cousin Maria is for ever coming to the playhouse . Tom Spencer has spied her out night after night in the gallery , and she comes on the nights when Hagan performs . Quick , Burroughs , Mr. Warrington 's boots and portmanteau ! Order a chaise and four for Portsmouth immediately ! The letter which I burned one morning when we were at breakfast I may let the cat out of the bag , now puss has such a prodigious way to run was from cousin M. , hinting that she wished me to tell no tales about her : but I ca n't help just whispering to you that Maria at this moment is busy consoling herself as fast as possible . Shall I spoil sport ? Shall I tell her brother ? Is the affair any business of mine ? What have the Esmonds done for you and me but win our money at cards ? Yet I like our noble cousin . It seems to me that he would be good if he could or rather , he would have been once . He has been set on a wrong way of life , from which ' tis now probably too late to rescue him . O beati agricolae ! Our Virginia was dull , but let us thank Heaven we were bred there . We were made little slaves , but not slaves to wickedness , gambling , bad male and female company . It was not until my poor Harry left home that he fell among thieves . I mean thieves en grand , such as waylaid him and stripped him on English highroads . I consider you none the worse because you were the unlucky one , and had to deliver your purse up . And now you are going to retrieve , and make a good name for yourself ; and kill more ' French dragons , ' and become a great commander . And our mother will talk of her son the Captain , the Colonel , the General , and have his picture painted with all his stars and epaulets , when poor I shall be but a dawdling poetaster , or , if we may hope for the best , a snug placeman , with a little box at Richmond or Kew , and a half - score of little picaninnies , that will come and bob curtseys at the garden - gate when their uncle the General rides up on his great charger , with his aide - de - camp 's pockets filled with gingerbread for the nephews and nieces . ' Tis for you to brandish the sword of Mars . As for me , I look forward to a quiet life : a quiet little home , a quiet little library full of books , and a little Some one dulce ridentem , dulce loquentem , on t'other side of the fire , as I scribble away at my papers . I am so pleased with this prospect , so utterly contented and happy , that I feel afraid as I think of it , lest it should escape me ; and , even to my dearest Hal , am shy of speaking of my happiness . What is ambition to me , with this certainty ? What do I care for wars , with this beatific peace smiling near ? "

Gentlemen and ladies of a certain age may remember the time when they indulged in these rapturous follies on their own accounts ; when the praises of the charmer were for ever warbling from their lips or trickling from their pens ; when the flowers of life were in full bloom , and all the birds of spring were singing . The twigs are now bare , perhaps , and the leaves have fallen ; but , for all that , shall we not , remember the vernal time ? As for you , young people , whose May or April , is it ? has not commenced yet , you need not be detained over other folks ' love - rhapsodies ; depend on it , when your spring - season arrives , kindly Nature will warm all your flowers into bloom , and rouse your glad bosoms to pour out their full song .

I might have been kept out of a deal of harm 's way : but innocent and good young women did not fall into mine , or they would have made me better than I am . "

307984	308138	307977	307977	he	707	" I can speak French and German very well , and why ? because I was taught both in the nursery . A man who learns them late can never get the practice of them on his tongue . And so ' tis the case with goodness , I ca n't learn it at my age . I can only see others practise it , and admire them . When I am on on the side opposite to Lazarus , will Miss Theo give me a drop of water ? Do n't frown ! I know I shall be there , Mrs. Lambert . Some folks are doomed so ; and I think some of our family are amongst these . Some people are vacillating , and one hardly knows which way the scale will turn . Whereas some are predestined angels , and fly Heavenwards naturally , and do what they will . "

You do n't know what a life ours is of the world ; how early it began ; how selfish Nature , and then necessity and education , have made us . It is Fate holds the reins of the chariot , and we ca n't escape our doom . I know better : I see better people : I go my own way . My own ? No , not mine Fate 's : and it is not altogether without pity for us , since it allows us , from time to time , to see such people as you . "

309105	309236	309074	309074	George	694	" But say she is all these ? So is Mr. Johnson much cleverer than I am : so is , whom shall we say ? so is Mr. Hagan the actor much taller and handsomer : so is Sir James Lowther much richer : yet pray , ma'am , do you suppose I am going to be jealous of any one of these three , or think my Theo would jilt me for their sakes ? Why should I not allow that Miss Lydia is handsomer , then ? and richer , and clever , too , and lively , and well bred , if you insist on it , and an angel if you will have it so ? Theo is not afraid : art thou , child ? "

310812	310953	310805	310808	the placid old gentleman	14565	" Very likely we are all sinners , and some evil may be truly said of all of us , with a great deal more that is untrue . Did he tell you that my son was unhappy with me ? I told you so too . Did he bring you wicked stories about my family ? He liked it so well that he wanted to marry my Lyddy to his brother . Heaven bless her ! I have had a many offers for her . And you are the young gentleman I should have chose for her , and I like you none the worse because you prefer somebody else ; though what you can see in your Miss , as compared to my Lyddy , begging your honour 's pardon , I am at a loss to understand .

310977	311089	310968	310969	Mr. George	694	" No , sir ; ' tis a wonder of nature , and daily happens . When I kept store to Albany , there was one of your tiptop gentry there that might have married my dear daughter that was alive then , and with a pretty piece of money , whereby for her father and I had quarrelled Miss Lyddy would have been a pauper , you see : and in place of my beautiful Bella , my gentleman chooses a little homely creature , no prettier than your Miss , and without a dollar to her fortune . The more fool he , saving your presence , Mr. George . "

311108	311138	311104	311104	George	694	" I suppose the gentleman 's word was given to the other lady , and he had seen her first , and hence was indifferent to your charming daughter . "
311139	311258	310968	310969	Mr. George	694	" I suppose when a young fellow gives his word to perform a cursed piece of folly , he always sticks to it , my dear sir , begging your pardon . But Lord , Lord , what am I speaking of ? I am aspeaking of twenty year ago . I was well - to - do then , but I may say Heaven has blessed my store , and I am three times as well off now . Ask my agents how much they will give for Joseph Van den Bosch 's bill at six months on New York or at sight may be for forty thousand pound ? I warrant they will discount the paper . "
311259	311269	311271	311271	George	694	" Happy he who has the bill , sir ! "

311308	311412	311303	311304	the elder	2775	" Always thinking about money nowadays ! Happy he who has the girl , I should say the money ai n't the question , my dear sir , when it goes along with such a lovely young thing as that though I humbly say it , who ought n't , and who am her fond silly old grandfather . We were talking about you , Lyddy darling come , give me a kiss , my blessing ! We were talking about you , and Mr. George said he would n't take you with all the money your poor old grandfather can give you . "
311413	311418	311420	311420	George	694	" Nay , sir , "
311422	311505	311420	311420	George	694	" Well , you are right to say nay , for I did n't say all , that 's the truth . My Blessing will have a deal more than that trifle I spoke of , when it shall please Heaven to remove me out of this world to a better when poor old Gappy is gone , Lyddy will be a rich little Lyddy , that she will . But she do n't wish me to go yet , does she ? "

311544	311656	311540	311540	her	1686	" But at any rate he is honest , and that is more than we can say of some folks in this wicked London . Oh , Lord , Lord , how mercenary they are ! Do you know that yonder , in Monument Yard , they were all at my poor little Blessing for her money ? There was Tom Lutestring ; there was Mr. Draper , your precious lawyer ; there was actually Mr. Tubbs , of Bethesda Chapel ; and they must all come buzzing like flies round the honey - pot . That is why we came out of the quarter where my brother - tradesmen live . "

311692	311751	311688	311690	the old gentleman	2827	" Else who am I to think of consorting with your grandees and fine folk ? I do n't care for the fashions , Mr. George ; I do n't care for plays and poetry , begging your honour 's pardon ; I never went to a play in my life , but to please this little minx . "
311752	311772	311774	311775	the child	2787	" Oh , sir , ' twas lovely ! and I cried so , did n't I , grandpapa ? "
311777	311784	311774	311775	the child	2787	" At what , my dear ? "
311785	311795	311688	311690	the old gentleman	2827	" At at Mr. Warrington 's play , grandpapa . "
311796	311917	311688	311690	the old gentleman	2827	" Did you , my dear ? I dare say ; I dare say ! It was mail day : and my letters had come in : and my ship the Lovely Lyddy had just come into Falmouth ; and Captain Joyce reported how he had mercifully escaped a French privateer ; and my head was so full of thanks for that escape , which saved me a deal of money , Mr. George for the rate at which ships is underwrote this war - time is so scandalous that I often prefer to venture than to insure that I confess I did n't listen much to the play , sir , and only went to please this little Lyddy . "
311918	311928	311930	311932	the young lady	6270	" And you did please me , dearest Gappy ! "
311934	311990	311930	311932	the young lady	6270	" Bless you ! then it 's all I want . What does a man want more here below than to please his children , Mr. George ? especially me , who knew what was to be unhappy when I was young , and to repent of having treated this darling 's father too hard . "
311991	311996	311998	311999	the child	2787	" Oh , grandpapa ! "
312005	312028	311998	311999	the child	2787	" Yes , I was too hard with him , dear ; and that 's why I spoil my little Lydkin so ! "
312517	312533	312534	312534	she	1686	" I am glad you are going to be married , oh , so glad ! "
312546	312606	312534	312534	she	1686	" for I can talk to you frankly , quite frankly as a brother , and not be afraid of that odious politeness about which they were always scolding me at boarding - school . I may speak to you frankly ; and if I like you , I may say so , may n't I , Mr. George ? "
312607	312613	312615	312615	George	694	" Pray , say so , "
312624	312648	312615	312615	George	694	" That is a kind of talk which most men delight to hear , especially from such pretty lips as Miss Lydia 's . "
312649	312658	312660	312661	the girl	21803	" What do you know about my lips ? "
312674	312679	312681	312681	George	694	" What , indeed ? "
312683	312695	312681	312681	George	694	" Perhaps I should like to know a great deal more . "
312696	312707	312709	312710	the girl	21803	" They do n't tell nothin' but truth , anyhow ! "
312712	312783	312709	312710	the girl	21803	" that 's why some people do n't like them ! If I have anything on my mind , it must come out . I am a country - bred girl , I am with my heart in my mouth all honesty and simplicity ; not like your English girls , who have learned I do n't know what at their boarding - schools , and from the men afterwards . "
312784	312794	312796	312796	George	694	" Our girls are monstrous little hypocrites , indeed ! "
312798	312879	312796	312796	George	694	" You are thinking of Miss Lamberts ? and I might have thought of them ; but I declare I did not then . They have been at boarding - school ; they have been in the world a great deal so much the greater pity for them , for be certain they learned no good there . And now I have said so , of course you will go and tell Miss Theo , wo n't you , sir ? "
312880	312922	312681	312681	George	694	" That she has learned no good in the world ? She has scarce spoken to men at all , except her father , her brother , and me . Which of us would teach her any wrong , think you ? "
312923	312942	312944	312945	the girl	21803	" Oh , not you ! Though I can understand its being very dangerous to be with you ! "
312951	312964	312966	312966	George	694	" Indeed there is no danger , and I do n't bite ! "
312970	312977	312979	312980	the girl	21803	" I did n't say bite , "
312984	313119	312979	312980	the girl	21803	" There 's other things dangerous besides biting , I should think . Are n't you very witty ? Yes , and sarcastic , and clever , and always laughing at people ? Have n't you a coaxing tongue ? If you was to look at me in that kind of way , I do n't know what would come to me . Was your brother like you , as I was to have married ? Was he as clever and witty as you ? I have heard he was like you : but he had n't your coaxing tongue . Heigho ! ' Tis well you are engaged , Master George , that is all . Do you think if you had seen me first , you would have liked Miss Theo best ? "
313120	313143	313145	313145	George	694	" They say marriages were made in Heaven , my dear , and let us trust that mine has been arranged there , "
313147	313165	313145	313145	George	694	" I suppose there was no such thing never known , as a man having two sweethearts ? "
313172	313264	313145	313145	George	694	" Guess it 's a pity . O me ! What nonsense I 'm a - talking ; there now ! I 'm like the little girl who cried for the moon ; and I ca n't have it . ' Tis too high for me too high and splendid and shining : ca n't reach up to it nohow . Well , what a foolish , wayward , little spoilt thing I am now ! But one thing you promise.-on your word and your honour , now , Mr. George ? "
313265	313271	312979	312980	the girl	21803	" And what is that ? "
313272	313287	312979	312980	the girl	21803	" That you wo n't tell Miss Theo , else she 'll hate me . "
313288	313295	313145	313145	George	694	" Why should she hate you ? "
313296	313308	313311	313313	the young lady	6270	" Because I hate her , and wish she was dead ! "
313339	313343	313344	313344	she	6270	" For shame ! "
313351	313455	313344	313344	she	6270	" I 'm a little fool to speak ! But whatever is in my heart must come out . I am a girl of the woods , I am . I was bred where the sun is hotter than in this foggy climate . And I am not like your cold English girls ; who , before they speak , or think , or feel , must wait for mamma to give leave . There , there ! I may be a little fool for saying what I have . I know you 'll go and tell Miss Lambert . Well , do ! "
313661	313665	313667	313669	Madame de Bernstein	780	" I suspect , "
313671	313763	313667	313669	Madame de Bernstein	780	" that he wants the girl for some client or relation of his own ; and that he tells these tales in order to frighten all suitors from her . When she and her grandfather came to me , she behaved perfectly well ; and I confess , sir , I thought it was a great pity that you should prefer yonder red - cheeked countrified little chit , without a halfpenny , to this pretty , wild , artless girl , with such a fortune as I hear she has . "
313764	313778	313780	313780	George	694	" Oh , she has been with you , has she , aunt ? "
313785	313794	313795	313796	the other	19802	" Of course she has been with me , "
313801	313820	313795	313796	the other	19802	" Unless your brother has been so silly as to fall in love with that other little Lambert girl "
313821	313835	313836	313836	George	694	" Indeed , ma'am , I think I can say he has not , "
313839	313921	313836	313836	George	694	" Why , then , when he comes back with Mr. Wolfe , should he not take a fancy to this little person , as his mamma wishes only , to do us justice , we Esmonds care very little for what our mammas wish and marry her , and set up beside you in Virginia ? She is to have a great fortune , which you wo n't touch . Pray , why should it go out of the family ? "
314131	314170	314129	314129	himself	694	" I have made an impression on the heart of this young creature . She has almost confessed as much . Poor artless little maiden ! I wonder what there is in me that she should like me ? "
316020	316032	316034	316035	little Hetty	993	" Why should n't she marry him if she likes him ? "
316037	316096	316034	316035	little Hetty	993	" Why should he not love her because she is a little old ? Mamma is a little old , and you love her none the worse . When you married my mamma , sir , I have heard you say you were very poor ; and yet you were very happy , and nobody laughed at you ! "
316169	316178	316180	316183	haughty little Miss Hett	1713	" It is an insult to the family , "
316185	316222	316180	316183	haughty little Miss Hett	1713	" and I can fancy how ladies of that rank must be indignant at their relative 's marriage with a person of Mr. Hagan 's condition ; but to desert her is a very different matter . "
316223	316230	316232	316232	mamma	19850	" Indeed , my dear child , "
316234	316261	316232	316232	mamma	19850	" you are talking of what you do n't understand . After my Lady Maria 's conduct , no respectable person can go to see her . "
316262	316268	316180	316183	haughty little Miss Hett	1713	" What conduct , mamma ? "
316269	316273	316275	316275	mamma	19850	" Never mind , "
316277	316335	316275	316275	mamma	19850	" Little girls ca n't be expected to know , and ought not to be too curious to inquire , what Lady Maria 's conduct has been ! Suffice it , miss , that I am shocked her ladyship should ever have been here ; and I say again , no honest person should associate with her ! "
316336	316351	316353	316353	George	694	" Then , Aunt Lambert , I must be whipped and sent to bed , "
316359	316479	316353	316353	George	694	" I own to you though I did not confess sooner , seeing that the affair was not mine that I have been to see my cousin the player , and her ladyship his wife . I found them in very dirty lodgings in Westminster , where the wretch has the shabbiness to keep not only his wife , but his old mother , and a little brother , whom he puts to school . I found Mr. Hagan , and came away with a liking , and almost a respect for him , although I own he has made a very improvident marriage . But how improvident some folks are about marriage , are n't they , Theo ? "
316480	316491	316493	316494	the General	3644	" Improvident , if they marry such spendthrifts as you , "
316496	316517	316493	316494	the General	3644	" Master George found his relations , and I 'll be bound to say he left his purse behind him . "
316518	316527	316529	316529	George	694	" No , not the purse , sir , "
316535	316671	316529	316529	George	694	" Theo made that . But I am bound to own it came empty away . Mr. Rich is in great dudgeon . He says he hardly dares have Hagan on his stage , and is afraid of a riot , such as Mr. Garrick had about the foreign dancers . This is to be a fine gentleman 's riot . The macaronis are furious , and vow they will pelt Mr. Hagan , and have him cudgelled afterwards . My cousin Will , at Arthur 's , has taken his oath he will have the actor 's ears . Meanwhile , as the poor man does not play , they have cut off his salary ; and without his salary , this luckless pair of lovers have no means to buy bread and cheese . "
316672	316689	316691	316691	Theo	987	" And you took it to them , sir ? It was like you , George ! "
316699	316710	316712	316712	George	694	" It was your purse took it , dear Theo ! "
316714	316729	316731	316731	Theo	987	" Mamma , I hope you will go and see them to - morrow ! "
316733	316748	316750	316750	papa	19857	" If she does n't , I shall get a divorce , my dear ! "
316752	316775	316750	316750	papa	19857	" Come and kiss me , you little wench that is , avec la bonne permission de monsieur mon beau - fils . "
316776	316784	316786	316787	Miss Lambert	993	" Monsieur mon beau fiddlestick , papa ! "
317669	317675	317676	317676	he	694	" My dearest little Theo , "
317679	317783	317676	317676	he	694	" was eager to accompany her mamma upon this errand of charity ; but I thought Aunt Lambert 's visit would be best under the circumstances , and without the attendance of her little spinster aide - de - camp . Cousin Hagan was out when we called ; we found her ladyship in a loose undress , and with her hair in not the neatest papers , playing at cribbage with a neighbour from the second floor , while good Mrs. Hagan sate on the other side of the fire with a glass of punch , and the Whole Duty of Man . "
318033	318115	318131	318131	Spencer	1672	" How strange it is that you who are the mettlesome fellow you know you are should escape quarrels hitherto , and I , who am a peaceful youth , wishing no harm to anybody , should have battles thrust upon me ! What do you think actually of my having had another affair upon my wicked hands , and with whom , think you ? With no less a personage than your old enemy , our kinsman , Mr. Will . "
318551	318569	318525	318526	Miss Lydia	1678	" ' Ah ! ' says the heedless little thing , as we sat over our dessert , "
318586	318669	318676	318676	she	14843	" ' Why , miss ? ' asks he , with one of his usual conversational ornaments . He must have offended some fairy in his youth , who has caused him to drop curses for ever out of his mouth , as she did the girl to spit out toads and serpents . I know some one from whose gentle lips there only fall pure pearls and diamonds . ' Why ? ' says Will , with a cannonade of oaths . "
318747	318789	318743	318744	Mr. George	694	" ' From Cape Breton , ' says I. ' He is very well , thank you ; that is ' I could n't finish the sentence , for I was in such a rage that I scarce could contain myself . "
318824	318840	318843	318843	he	2104	" ' So I apprehend he did , sir , ' says Will 's brother . "
318879	318899	318843	318843	he	2104	" ' La ! ' says Miss , ' did the Captain ever have a bailiff after him ? ' "
318914	318992	318911	318912	Mr. Will	913	" I suppose I must have looked very savage , for Spencer , who was dining with us , trod on my foot under the table . ' Do n't laugh so loud , cousin , ' I said , very gently ; ' you may wake good old Mr. Van den Bosch . ' The good old gentleman was asleep in his arm - chair , to which he commonly retires for a nap after dinner . "
319076	319130	319151	319152	Mr. Will	913	" ' Oh , what a comfort ! ' cries Miss Lyddy . ' Keep quite quiet , gentlemen , and do n't quarrel , and come up to me when I send to say the tea is ready . ' And with this she makes a sweet little curtsey , and disappears . "
319178	319234	319164	319164	he	913	" ' I am going to help myself , ' I said ; ' but I am not going to drink the glass ; and I 'll tell you what I am going to do with it , if you will be quite quiet , cousin . ' Desperate kicks from Spencer all this time . "
319260	319284	319254	319254	Will	913	" ' I am going to fling it into your face , cousin , ' says I , very rapidly performing that feat . "
319334	319395	319309	319313	good old Van den Bosch	1657	" I remarked it was only a glass of wine gone the wrong way and the old man said ; ' Well , well , there is more where that came from ! Let the butler bring you what you please , young gentlemen ! ' and he sank back in his great chair , and began to sleep again . "
319443	319487	319437	319437	I	0	" ' D the statue ! ' begins Will ; but I said , ' Do n't , cousin ! or you will wake up the old gentleman . Had we not best go upstairs to Miss Lyddy 's tea - table ? ' "
319563	319793	319542	319544	Sir John Fielding	1723	" Who gave the information ? Not I , or Spencer , I can vow . Though I own I was pleased when the constables came running to us ; bludgeon in hand : for I had no wish to take Will 's blood , or sacrifice my own to such a rascal . Now , sir , have you such a battle as this to describe to me ? a battle of powder and no shot ? a battle of swords as bloody as any on the stage ? I have filled my paper , without finishing the story of Maria and her Hagan . You must have it by the next ship . You see , the quarrel with Will took place yesterday , very soon after I had written the first sentence or two of my letter . I had been dawdling till dinner - time I looked at the paper last night , when I was grimly making certain little accounts up , and wondered shall I ever finish this letter ? , and now the quarrel has been so much more interesting to me than poor Molly 's love - adventures , that behold my paper is full to the brim ! Wherever my dearest Harry reads it , I know that there will be a heart full of love for His loving brother , "
319797	319797	319542	319544	Sir John Fielding	1723	"
319972	320000	320002	320002	Lyddy	1686	" But the arrival of the constables saved your valuable life , dear Mr. George , and I am sure Miss Theo ought to bless them forever , "
320009	320051	320002	320002	Lyddy	1686	" You wo n't stop and meet Mr. Esmond at dinner to - day ? You do n't like being in his company ? He ca n't do you any harm ; and I am sure you will do him none . "
320155	320190	320192	320192	Theo	987	" You were actually going to take a fellow - creature 's life , and you came to see us , and said not a word ! Oh , George , it was shocking ! "
320194	320206	320192	320192	Theo	987	" My dear , he had insulted me and my brother , "
320210	320229	320208	320208	George	694	" Could I let him call us both cowards , and sit by and say , Thank you ? "
320239	320271	320208	320208	George	694	" You know you think , papa , it is a wicked and un - Christian practice ; and have often said you wished gentlemen would have the courage to refuse ! "
320272	320278	320280	320281	Mr. Lambert	1000	" To refuse ? Yes , "
320287	320299	320301	320302	Jack Lambert	1527	" It must require a prodigious strength of mind to refuse , "
320311	320334	320301	320302	Jack Lambert	1527	" and I think if any man were to call me a coward , I should be apt to forget my orders . "
320335	320344	320346	320346	George	694	" You see brother Jack is with me ! "
320348	320359	320361	320362	Jack Lambert	1527	" I must not be against you , Mr. Warrington , "
320364	320368	320370	320370	George	694	" Mr. Warrington ! "
320376	320395	320397	320397	Theo	987	" Would you , a clergyman , have George break the Commandments , and commit murder , John ? "
320401	320411	320413	320415	the young divine	14891	" I am a soldier 's son , sister , "
320419	320458	320459	320459	He	14891	" Besides , Mr. Warrington has committed no murder at all . We must soon be hearing from Canada , father . The great question of the supremacy of the two races must be tried there ere long ! "
320516	320522	320524	320524	he	694	" Great powers , gentlemen ! "
320529	320551	320552	320553	The clergyman	4921	" I believe , on my honour , you are giving me the credit of shirking this affair with Mr. Esmond ! "
320562	320577	320579	320579	George	694	" A man 's nearest and dearest are always the first to insult him , "
320584	320602	320604	320605	the General	3644	" You mean to say , ' Not guilty ? ' God bless thee , my boy ! "
320607	320615	320617	320617	he	3644	" I told thee so , Jack . "
320638	320649	320617	320617	he	3644	" Not guilty of what , in heaven 's name ? "
320654	320657	320659	320660	the General	3644	" Nay , "
320662	320689	320659	320660	the General	3644	" Mr. Jack , here , brought the story . Let him tell it . I believe ' tis a lie , with all my heart . "
320713	320733	320735	320735	George	694	" And what is this this d d lie , sir , that somebody has been telling of me ? "
320743	320758	320760	320761	Mr. Lambert	1000	" To question the courage of any man is always an offence to him , "
320763	320773	320760	320761	Mr. Lambert	1000	" and I rejoice that yours has been belied . "
320774	320786	320789	320790	Mr. Warrington	694	" Who told the falsehood , sir , which you repeated ? "
320792	320801	320789	320790	Mr. Warrington	694	" I insist on the man 's name ! "
320802	320814	320816	320816	Jack	1059	" You forget you are bound over to keep the peace , "

320844	320852	320854	320856	the young parson	14904	" Fair and softly , Mr. Warrington ! "
320858	320886	320854	320856	the young parson	14904	" my hearing is perfectly good . It was not a man who told me the story which , I confess , I imparted to my father . "
320887	320890	320892	320892	George	694	" What ? "
320899	320912	320816	320816	Jack	1059	" Was it that artful , wicked little vixen in Bloomsbury Square ? "
320913	320929	320931	320931	Lambert	1000	" Vixen is not the word to apply to any young lady , George Warrington ! "
320933	321011	320931	320931	Lambert	1000	" much less to the charming Miss Lydia . She artful the most innocent of Heaven 's creatures ! She wicked that angel ! With unfeigned delight that the quarrel should be over with devout gratitude to think that blood consanguineous should not be shed she spoke in terms of the highest praise of you for declining this quarrel , and of the deepest sympathy with you for taking the painful but only method of averting it . "
321012	321016	321018	321018	George	694	" What method ? "
321024	321036	321038	321039	Mr. Jack	1059	" Why , of laying an information , to be sure ! "
321064	321073	321075	321076	the parson	2199	" Do n't utter such words , sir ! "
321092	321196	321075	321076	the parson	2199	" Do not insult , in my hearing , the most charming , the most innocent of her sex ! If she has been mistaken in her information regarding you , and doubted your willingness to commit what , after all , is a crime for a crime homicide is , and of the most awful description you , sir , have no right to blacken that angel 's character with foul words : and , innocent yourself , should respect the most innocent as she is the most lovely of women ! Oh , George , are you to be my brother ? "
321197	321205	321207	321207	George	694	" I hope to have that honour , "
321220	321516	321211	321211	He	694	" What , then , what though ' tis too much bliss to be hoped for by sinful man what , if she should one day be your sister ? Who could see her charms without being subjugated by them ? I own that I am a slave . I own that those Latin Sapphics in the September number of the Gentleman 's Magazine , beginning Lydicae quondam cecinit venustae with an English version by my friend Hickson of Corpus , were mine . I have told my mother what hath passed between us , and Mrs. Lambert also thinks that the most lovely of her sex has deigned to look favourably on me . I have composed a letter she another . She proposes to wait on Miss Lydia 's grandpapa this very day , and to bring me the answer , which shall make me the happiest or the most wretched of men ! It was in the unrestrained intercourse of family conversation that I chanced to impart to my father the sentiments which my dear girl had uttered . Perhaps I spoke slightingly of your courage , which I do n't doubt by Heaven , I do n't doubt : it may be , she has erred , too , regarding you . It may be that the fiend jealousy has been gnawing at my bosom , and horrible suspicion ! that I thought my sister 's lover found too much favour with her I would have all my own . Ah , dear George , who knows his faults ? I am as one distracted with passion . Confound it , sir ! What right have you to laugh at me ? I would have you to know that risu inepto . "

Thou canst not fight him for two years ; and between now and then , let us trust you will have made up your quarrel . Here is dinner , boys ! We will drink absent friends , and an end to the war , and no fighting out of the profession ! "

322284	322299	322301	322301	Jack	1726	" Confound it ! leave me alone , Mr. Warrington , do you hear ? "
322322	322330	322332	322333	the lady	2586	" What is the matter , George ? "
322354	322423	322335	322335	George	694	" Brother Jack has not a fine temper , Aunt Lambert . He informs you all that I am a coward , and remonstrates with me for being angry . He finds his mistress gone to the country , and he bawls , and stamps , and swears . O fie ! Oh , Aunt Lambert , beware of jealousy ! Did the General ever make you jealous ? "
322424	322440	322443	322444	Aunt Lambert	1175	" You will make me very angry if you speak to me in this way , "
322449	322463	322465	322465	George	694	" I am respectfully dumb . I make my bow . I withdraw , "
322554	322562	322563	322563	he	694	" My dear , kind cousin William , "
322566	322687	322563	322563	he	694	" you know I am bound over , and would not quarrel with any one , much less with a dear , truth - telling , affectionate kinsman , whom my brother insulted by caning . But if you can find any one who says that I prevented a meeting the other day by giving information , will you tell your informant that I think it is not I but somebody else is the coward ? And I write to Mr. Van den Bosch by the same post , to inform him and Miss Lyddy that I find some rascal has been telling them lies to my discredit , and to beg them to have a care of such persons .

322751	322898	322747	322748	my lord	2193	" there has been so much annoyance in our family of late , that I am sure ' tis time our quarrels should cease . Two days since my brother William brought me a very angry letter , signed G. Warrington , and at the same time , to my great grief and pain , acquainted me with a quarrel that had taken place between you , in which , to say the least , your conduct was violent . ' Tis an ill use to put good wine to that to which you applied good Mr. Van den Bosch 's . Sure , before an old man , young ones should be more respectful . I do not deny that Wm . 's language and behaviour are often irritating . I know he has often tried my temper , and that within the 24 hours . "
322980	323163	322969	322969	I	0	" At my mature age , ' tis not uncommon for a man to choose a young wife . My Lydia you will divine that I am happy in being able to call mine the elegant Miss Van den Bosch will naturally survive me . After soothing my declining years , I shall not be jealous if at their close she should select some happy man to succeed me ; though I shall envy him the possession of so much perfection and beauty . Though of a noble Dutch family , her rank , the dear girl declares , is not equal to mine , which she confesses that she is pleased to share . I , on the other hand , shall not be sorry to see descendants to my house , and to have it , through my Lady Castlewood 's means , restored to something of the splendour which it knew before two or three improvident predecessors impaired it . My Lydia , who is by my side , sends you and the charming Lambert family her warmest remembrances . "

327807	327812	327804	327805	Mr. Warrington	694	" says Mr. Esmond . "
327819	327820	327804	327805	Mr. Warrington	694	" "
327828	327833	327804	327805	Mr. Warrington	694	" asks the other . "
327868	327869	327859	327866	the wife of the Captain of the Guard	15207	" "
327873	327877	327859	327866	the wife of the Captain of the Guard	15207	" asks Will . "
327882	327887	327859	327866	the wife of the Captain of the Guard	15207	" says Mr. Warrington . "
327935	328168	327933	327933	cousin	19751	" remarks Mr. William . But Mr. Warrington explained that he was speaking of a Captain of the Guard of the King of Egypt , whose wife had persecuted one Joseph for not returning her affection for him . On which Will said that , as for Egypt , he believed it was a confounded long way off ; and that if Lord What - d'ye - call 's wife told lies about him , it was like her sex , who he supposed were the same everywhere . Now the truth is , that when he paid his marriage - visit to Castlewood , Mr. Warrington had heard from the little Countess her version of the story of differences between Will Esmond and herself . And this tale differed , in some respects , though he is far from saying it is more authentic than the ingenuous narrative of Mr. Will . The lady was grieved to think how she had been deceived in her brother - in - law . She feared that his life about the court and town had injured those high principles which all the Esmonds are known to be born with ; that Mr. Will 's words were not altogether to be trusted ; that a loose life and pecuniary difficulties had made him mercenary , blunted his honour , perhaps even impaired the high chivalrous courage "
328175	328185	327933	327933	cousin	19751	" the little lady said , tossing her head , "
328212	328217	328209	328209	I	0	" says the Countess . "
328339	328340	328341	328341	I	0	" "
328347	328352	328354	328354	he	725	" cries Mr. Warrington . "
328572	328581	328582	328582	I	0	" and her ladyship snapped her little fingers . "
328707	328947	328701	328701	I	0	" And so saying , the intrepid little woman looked round at her ancestors , whose effigies , depicted by Lely and Kneller , figured round the walls of her drawing - room at Castlewood . Over that apartment , and the whole house , domain , and village , the new Countess speedily began to rule with an unlimited sway . It was surprising how quickly she learned the ways of command ; and , if she did not adopt those methods of precedence usual in England among great ladies , invented regulations for herself , and promulgated them , and made others submit . Having been bred a Dissenter , and not being over - familiar with the Established Church service , Mr. Warrington remarked that she made a blunder or two during the office not knowing , for example , when she was to turn her face towards the east , a custom not adopted , I believe , in other Reforming churches besides the English ; but between Warrington 's first bridal visit to Castlewood and his second , my lady had got to be quite perfect in that part of her duty , and sailed into chapel on her cousin 's arm , her two footmen bearing her ladyship 's great Prayer - book behind her , as demurely as that delightful old devotee with her lackey , in Mr. Hogarth 's famous picture of "
328950	329697	329699	329699	his	15259	" and as if my Lady Lydia had been accustomed to have a chaplain all her life . She seemed to patronise not only the new chaplain , but the service and the church itself , as if she had never in her own country heard a Ranter in a barn . She made the oldest established families in the country grave baronets and their wives worthy squires of twenty descents , who rode over to Castlewood to pay the bride and bridegroom honour know their distance , as the phrase is , and give her the pas . She got an old heraldry book ; and a surprising old maiden lady from Winton , learned in politeness and genealogies , from whom she learned the court etiquette as the old Winton lady had known it in Queen Anne 's time ; and ere long she jabbered gules and sables , bends and saltires , not with correctness always , but with a wonderful volubility and perseverance . She made little progresses to the neighbouring towns in her gilt coach - and - six , or to the village in her chair , and asserted a quasi - regal right of homage from her tenants and other clodpoles . She lectured the parson on his divinity ; the bailiff on his farming ; instructed the astonished housekeeper how to preserve and pickle ; would have taught the great London footmen to jump behind the carriage , only it was too high for her little ladyship to mount ; gave the village gossips instructions how to nurse and take care of their children long before she had one herself ; and as for physic , Madam Esmond in Virginia was not more resolute about her pills and draughts than Miss Lydia , the earl 's new bride . Do you remember the story of the Fisherman and the Genie , in the Arabian Nights ? So one wondered with regard to this lady , how such a prodigious genius could have been corked down into such a little bottle as her body . When Mr. Warrington returned to London after his first nuptial visit , she brought him a little present for her young friends in Dean Street , as she called them Theo being older , and Hetty scarce younger than herself , and sent a trinket to one and a book to the other G. Warrington always vowing that Theo 's present was a doll , while Hetty 's share was a nursery - book with words of one syllable . As for Mr. Will , her younger brother - in - law , she treated him with a maternal gravity and tenderness , and was in the habit of speaking of and to him with a protecting air , which was infinitely diverting to Warrington , although Will 's usual curses and blasphemies were sorely increased by her behaviour . As for old age , my Lady Lydia had little respect for that accident in the life of some gentlemen and gentlewomen ; and , once the settlements were made in her behalf , treated the ancient Van den Bosch and his large periwig with no more ceremony than Dinah her black attendant , whose great ears she would pinch , and whose woolly pate she would pull without scruple , upon offence given so at least Dinah told Gumbo , who told his master . All the household trembled before my lady the Countess : the housekeeper , of whom even my lord and the dowager had been in awe ; the pampered London footmen , who used to quarrel if they were disturbed at their cards , and grumbled as they swilled the endless beer , now stepped nimbly about their business when they heard her ladyship 's call ; even old Lockwood , who had been gate - porter for half a century or more , tried to rally his poor old wandering wits when she came into his lodge to open his window , inspect his wood - closet , and turn his old dogs out of doors . Lockwood bared his old bald head before his new mistress , turned an appealing look towards his niece , and vaguely trembled before her little ladyship 's authority . Gumbo , dressing his master for dinner , talked about Elisha of whom he had heard the chaplain read in the morning , "
329722	329742	329711	329712	de bars	15261	" says Gumbo . But as for my lady , when discoursing with her cousin about the old porter , "
329751	329755	329760	329760	he	15262	" says she ; "
329781	329819	329820	329820	Lockwood	712	" Here she pointed to two old monsters of carp that had been in a pond in Castlewood gardens for centuries , according to tradition , and had their backs all covered with a hideous grey mould . "

329876	329889	329859	329859	He	15262	" interposed Mr. Warrington . On which my lady cried , petulantly , "
329913	329939	329940	329940	I	0	" This matter of Lockwood was discussed at the family dinner , when her ladyship announced her intention of getting rid of the old man . "
329944	329952	329940	329940	I	0	" demurely remarks Mr. Van den Bosch , "

330021	330026	330044	330046	an old servant	15278	" cries her ladyship . "

330048	330053	330044	330046	an old servant	15278	" asks my lord . "
330068	330073	330062	330062	servants	2872	" remarks Mr. Warrington . "

330095	330100	330093	330093	sir	19663	" says my lord . "
330111	330121	330093	330093	sir	19663	" says the old man , with a laugh ; "
330138	330139	330142	330142	pa	15284	" "
330153	330158	330159	330159	He	1657	" cries her ladyship . "
330176	330180	330172	330174	my dear ladyship	15286	" says grandpapa . "
330205	330210	330199	330203	that shrivelled old porter creature	15289	" cries my lady . "
330231	330236	330199	330203	that shrivelled old porter creature	15289	" says Mr. Warrington . "
330248	330249	330243	330243	you	15281	" "
330294	330295	330268	330268	I	0	" "
330304	330319	330297	330298	your ladyship	19813	" Mr. Warrington remarked , very gravely . And my lord said , yawning , "
330344	330345	330346	330346	You	15281	" "
330364	330371	330372	330372	Your	15281	" continues Mr. Warrington , gravely . "
330437	330438	330428	330430	that rascal Gumbo	15304	" "
330447	330453	330445	330445	master	4393	" says Gumbo , grinning . "
330485	330519	330520	330520	I	0	" says Mr. Warrington . The next day , to Warrington 's surprise , my lady absolutely did send a basket of good wine to Lockwood , and a cushion for his armchair . "
330565	330620	330621	330621	You	15281	" And so this affair of the porter 's lodge ended , Mr. Warrington wondering within himself at this strange little character out of the West , with her naivete and simplicities , and a heartlessness would have done credit to the most battered old dowager who ever turned trumps in St. James 's . "
330646	330652	330643	330643	I	0	" she said to Warrington . "
330734	331086	330730	330730	they	15313	" Now , at Christmas , Aunt Bernstein came to pay her nephew and niece a visit , in company with Mr. Warrington . They travelled at their leisure in the Baroness 's own landau ; the old lady being in particular good health and spirits , the weather delightfully fresh and not too cold ; and , as they approached her paternal home , Aunt Beatrice told her companion a hundred stories regarding it and old days . Though often lethargic , and not seldom , it must be confessed , out of temper , the old lady would light up at times , when her conversation became wonderfully lively , her wit and malice were brilliant , and her memory supplied her with a hundred anecdotes of a bygone age and society . Sure , ' tis hard with respect to Beauty , that its possessor should not have even a life - enjoyment of it , but be compelled to resign it after , at the most , some forty years ' lease . As the old woman prattled of her former lovers and admirers her auditor having much more information regarding her past career than her ladyship knew of , I would look in her face , and , out of the ruins , try to build up in my fancy a notion of her beauty in its prime . What a homily I read there ! How the courts were grown with grass , the towers broken , the doors ajar , the fine gilt saloons tarnished , and the tapestries cobwebbed and torn ! Yonder dilapidated palace was all alive once with splendour and music , and those dim windows were dazzling and blazing with light ! What balls and feasts were once here , what splendour and laughter ! I could see lovers in waiting , crowds in admiration , rivals furious . I could imagine twilight assignations , and detect intrigues , though the curtains were close and drawn . I was often minded to say to the old woman as she talked , "
331104	331249	331251	331251	you	15319	" I had read at home the history of her life , as my dear old grandfather had wrote it : and my fancy wandered about in her , amused and solitary , as I had walked about our father 's house at Castlewood , meditating on departed glories , and imagining ancient times . When Aunt Bernstein came to Castlewood , her relatives there , more , I think , on account of her own force of character , imperiousness , and sarcastic wit , than from their desire to possess her money , were accustomed to pay her a great deal of respect and deference , which she accepted as her due . She expected the same treatment from the new Countess , whom she was prepared to greet with special good - humour . The match had been of her making . "
331263	331267	331268	331268	I	0	" she said , "
331280	331410	331268	331268	I	0	" and she laughingly told of many little schemes for bringing the marriage about . She had given the girl a coronet and her nephew a hundred thousand pounds . Of course she should be welcome to both of them . She was delighted with the little Countess 's courage and spirit in routing the Dowager and Lady Fanny . Almost always pleased with pretty people on her first introduction to them , Madame Bernstein raffled of her niece Lydia 's bright eyes and lovely little figure . The marriage was altogether desirable . The old man was an obstacle , to be sure , and his talk and appearance somewhat too homely . But he will be got rid of . He is old and in delicate health . "
331423	331432	331411	331411	He	15323	" says the Baroness , with a shrug . "
331456	331463	331438	331438	she	2787	" said the pleased old Baroness . "
331507	331712	331717	331718	my lady	19701	" In this way we discoursed on the second afternoon as we journeyed towards Castlewood . We lay at the King 's Arms at Bagshot the first night , where the Baroness was always received with profound respect , and thence drove post to Hexton , where she had written to have my lord 's horses in waiting for her ; but these were not forthcoming at the inn , and after a couple of hours we were obliged to proceed with our Bagshot horses to Castlewood . During this last stage of the journey , I am bound to say the old aunt 's testy humour returned , and she scarce spoke a single word for three hours . As for her companion ; being prodigiously in love at the time , no doubt he did not press his aunt for conversation , but thought unceasingly about his Dulcinea , until the coach actually reached Castlewood Common , and rolled over the bridge before the house . The housekeeper was ready to conduct her ladyship to her apartments . My lord and lady were both absent . She did not know what had kept them , the housekeeper said , heading the way . "
331720	331744	331717	331718	my lady	19701	" cries the woman , as Madame de Bernstein put her hand upon the door of the room which she had always occupied . "
331756	331813	331717	331718	my lady	19701	" and our aunt followed , by no means in increased good - humour . I do not envy her maids when their mistress was displeased . But she had cleared her brow before she joined the family , and appeared in the drawing - room before supper - time with a countenance of tolerable serenity . "
331820	331827	331828	331828	I	0	" was the Countess 's salutation . "
331852	331909	331843	331843	you	5186	" Having addressed three brief sentences to the astonished old lady , the Countess now turned to her other guests , and directed her conversation to them . Mr. Warrington was not a little diverted by her behaviour , and by the appearance of surprise and wrath which began to gather over Madame Bernstein 's face . "
331913	331919	331843	331843	you	5186	" whom the Baroness proposed to "
331922	332031	331843	331843	you	5186	" was rather a rebellious subject , apparently , and proposed to take a form of her own . Looking once or twice rather anxiously towards his wife , my lord tried to atone for her pertness towards his aunt by profuse civility on his own part ; indeed , when he so wished , no man could be more courteous or pleasing . He found a score of agreeable things to say to Madame Bernstein . He warmly congratulated Mr. Warrington on the glorious news which had come from America , and on his brother 's safety . He drank a toast at supper to Captain Warrington . "
332040	332055	332038	332038	cousin	19751	" he said ; and added , looking with fond significance towards his Countess , "
332068	332069	332072	332072	George	694	" "
332074	332080	332072	332072	George	694	" says the little lady . "
332135	332136	332140	332140	you	19846	" "
332145	332150	332140	332140	you	19846	" cries Lord Castlewood . "
332178	332194	332161	332161	I	0	" George ! Harry ! I protest I was almost as much astonished as amused . "
332214	332244	332245	332245	George	694	" I said gravely . Next day , when talking beside her sofa , where she chose to lie in state , the little Countess no longer called her cousin "
332247	332249	332250	332251	Mr. George	694	" but "
332253	332273	332250	332251	Mr. George	694	" as before ; on which Mr. George laughingly said she had changed her language since the previous day . "
332284	332289	332275	332275	I	0	" says her ladyship . "
332388	332389	332392	332392	I	0	" "
332399	332404	332394	332394	I	0	" says Mr. George . "
332475	332476	332471	332471	she	1754	" "
332487	332493	332494	332494	I	0	" I said , laughing . "
332507	332516	332494	332494	I	0	" says she , with a little sigh . "
332611	332612	332613	332613	You	15351	" "
332634	332639	332613	332613	You	15351	" says Mr. Warrington . "
332654	332659	332646	332646	her	987	" says the lady . "
332688	332709	332673	332673	she	19821	" And the little heathen sank back on her couch , and showed twenty - four pearls of her own . "
332712	332732	332673	332673	she	19821	" she adds , after gazing at both her hearers through the curled lashes of her brilliant dark eyes . "
332887	333030	332876	332876	you	15351	" When at this point of our conversation the door opened , and Madame Beatrix , elaborately dressed according to her wo nt , actually made her appearance , I , for my part , am not ashamed to own that I felt as great a panic as ever coward experienced . My lord , with his profoundest bows and blandest courtesies , greeted his aunt and led her to the fire , by which my lady who was already hoping for an heir to Castlewood lay reclining on her sofa . She did not attempt to rise , but smiled a greeting to her venerable guest . And then , after a brief talk , in which she showed a perfect self - possession , while the two gentlemen blundered and hesitated with the most dastardly tremor , my lord said : "
333048	333049	333051	333051	I	0	" "
333078	333258	333061	333061	you	19751	" says the new mistress of the mansion . O les laches que les hommes ! I was so frightened , that I scarce saw anything , but vaguely felt that Lady Castlewood 's dark eyes were following me . My lord gripped my arm in the corridor , we quickened our paces till our retreat became a disgraceful run . We did not breathe freely till we were in the open air in the courtyard , where the keepers and the dogs were waiting . And what happened ? I protest , children , I do n't know . But this is certain : if your mother had been a woman of the least spirit , or had known how to scold for five minutes during as many consecutive days of her early married life , there would have been no more humble , henpecked wretch in Christendom than your father . When Parson Blake comes to dinner , do n't you see how at a glance from his little wife he puts his glass down and says , "
333267	333407	333264	333265	Mr. Gumbo	689	" when old Gum brings him wine ? Blake wore a red coat before he took to black , and walked up Breeds Hill with a thousand bullets whistling round his ears , before ever he saw our Bunker Hill in Suffolk . And the fire - eater of the 43rd now dare not face a glass of old port wine ! ' Tis his wife has subdued his courage . The women can master us , and did they know their own strength , were invincible . Well , then , what happened I know not on that disgraceful day of panic when your father fled the field , nor dared to see the heroines engage ; but when we returned from our shooting , the battle was over . America had revolted , and conquered the mother country .
334230	334242	334244	334245	meek Religion	1757	" Why , with his name , he might marry anybody , "
334261	334274	334276	334276	uncle	9945	" I meddle with no man 's affairs , and admire genius , "
334278	334333	334276	334276	uncle	9945	" but it is a pity you consort with those poets and authors , and that sort of people , and that , when you might have had a lovely creature , with a hundred thousand pounds , you let her slip and make up to a country girl without a penny - piece . "
334334	334344	334346	334346	I.	15440	" But if I had promised her , uncle ? "
334347	334564	334346	334346	I.	15440	" Promise , promise ! these things are matters of arrangement and prudence , and demand a careful look - out . When you first committed yourself with little Miss Lambert , you had not seen the lovely American lady whom your mother wished you to marry , as a good mother naturally would . And your duty to your mother , nephew , your duty to the Fifth Commandment , would have warranted your breaking with Miss L. , and fulfilling your excellent mother 's intentions regarding Miss What was the Countess 's Dutch name ? Never mind . A name is nothing ; but a plumb , Master George , is something to look at ! Why , I have my dear little Miley at a dancing - school with Miss Barwell , Nabob Barwell 's daughter , and I do n't disguise my wish that the children may contract an attachment which may endure through their lives ! I tell the Nabob so . We went from the House of Commons one dancing - day and saw them . ' Twas beautiful to see the young things walking a minuet together ! It brought tears into my eyes , for I have a feeling heart , George , and I love my boy ! "
334565	334591	334610	334612	the old gentleman	2827	" But if I prefer Miss Lambert , uncle , with twopence to her fortune , to the Countess , with her hundred thousand pounds ? "
334592	334608	334610	334612	the old gentleman	2827	" Why then , sir , you have a singular taste , that 's all , "
336081	336356	336359	336364	the General of whose noble letters	15551	" By the list of disabled officers many of whom are of rank you may perceive , sir , that the army is much weakened . By the nature of this river the most formidable part of the armament is deprived of the power of acting , yet we have almost the whole force of Canada to oppose . In this situation there is such a choice of difficulties , that I own myself at a loss how to determine . The affairs of Great Britain , I know , require the most vigorous measures ; but then the courage of a handful of brave men should be exerted only where there is some hope of a favourable event . The admiral and I have examined the town with a view to a general assault : and he would readily join in this or any other measure for the public service ; but I can not propose to him an undertaking of so dangerous a nature , and promising so little success .... I found myself so ill , and am still so weak , that I begged the general officers to consult together for the public utility . They are of opinion that they should try by conveying up a corps of 4000 or 5000 men which is nearly the whole strength of the army , after the points of Levi and Orleans are put in a proper state of defence to draw the enemy from their present position , and bring them to an action . I have acquiesced in their proposal , and we are preparing to put it into execution . "
336433	336467	336413	336414	the chief	3760	" the only chance was to fight the Marquis of Montcalm upon terms of less disadvantage than attacking his entrenchments , and , if possible , to draw him from his present position . "
337305	337317	337319	337320	General Lambert	975	" Do n't talk to me , madam , about grief , "
337354	337402	337403	337403	he	975	" If our boys could come by such deaths as James 's , you know you would n't prevent them from being shot , but would scale the Abraham heights to see the thing done ! Wouldst thou mind dying in the arms of victory , Charley ? "
337413	337419	337421	337423	the little man	15623	" That I would n't , "
337425	337436	337421	337423	the little man	15623	" and the doctor gave us a holiday , too . "
338098	338107	338114	338114	They	15661	" I never intend to go . THEODOSIA . "
338108	338113	338114	338114	They	15661	" Nor I. HESTER . "
339378	339385	339387	339387	he	1486	" Read this , George Warrington ! "
339474	339488	339490	339491	the General	3644	" What can I do after this , George , my poor boy ? "
339714	339721	339722	339723	the General	3644	" God help us , George ! "
339726	339837	339722	339723	the General	3644	" and give us all strength to bear this grief , and these charges which it has pleased your mother to bring ! They are hard , but they do n't matter now . What is of most importance , is to spare as much sorrow as we can to my poor girl . I know you love her so well , that you will help me and her mother to make the blow as tolerable as we may to that poor gentle heart . Since she was born she has never given pain to a soul alive , and ' tis cruel that she should be made to suffer . "
339851	339864	339842	339842	he	3644	" It was my fault , Martin ! It was my fault ! "
339870	339882	339884	339885	the father	2841	" Your mother spoke us fair , and gave her promise , "
339887	339897	339899	339899	I	0	" And do you think I will withdraw mine ? "
339934	340159	340161	340163	the good man	7210	" She herself will demand the parting . She is a good girl , God help me ! and a dutiful . She will not have her father and mother called schemers , and treated with scorn . Your mother knew not , very likely , what she was doing , but ' tis done . You may see the child , and she will tell you as much . Is Theo dressed , Molly ? I brought the letter home from my office last evening after you were gone . The women have had a bad night . She knew at once by my face that there was bad news from America . She read the letter quite firmly . She said she would like to see you and say good - bye . Of course , George , you will give me your word of honour not to try and see her afterwards . As soon as my business will let me we will get away from this , but mother and I think we are best all together . ' Tis you , perhaps , had best go . But give me your word , at any rate , that you will not try and see her . We must spare her pain , sir ! We must spare her pain ! "
340305	340313	340314	340314	she	15762	" Good - bye , dear George ! "
340455	340467	340468	340468	she	20348	" What is it makes you look so angry , papa ? "
340471	340475	340476	340476	I	0	" My love ! "
340479	340487	340476	340476	I	0	" it is the thirteenth of April . "
340541	340563	340564	340564	she	20348	" Hal will be home for Easter ; he will bring two or three of his friends with him from Cambridge , "
341373	341394	341396	341397	the doctor	5377	" I think , sir , if your mother heard you , and saw Miss Lambert , she would relent , "
341428	341433	341434	341434	he	5377	" He could not , "
341437	341484	341434	341434	he	5377	" be a message - carrier between young ladies who were pining and young lovers on whom the sweethearts ' gates were shut : but so much he would venture to say , that he had seen me , and was prescribing for me , too . "
341531	341569	341518	341518	He	5377	" She bears her suffering with an angelical sweetness . I prescribe Jesuit 's bark , which she takes ; but I am not sure the hearing of you has not done more good than the medicine . "
341817	341875	341799	341799	Miles	770	" By Jove , sir , I did n't know you and my mother were took in this kind of way . The year I joined , I was hit very bad myself . An infernal little jilt that threw me over for Sir Craven Oaks of our regiment . I thought I should have gone crazy . "
341969	341975	341976	341976	he	3644	" She does not rally , "
341979	341994	341976	341976	he	3644	" We must get her back to Kent again , or to the sea . "
342197	342206	342182	342182	she	2586	" Do n't you know me , George ? "
342322	342377	342315	342317	the little maiden	15855	" So you are come at last to ask after Theo , and you feel sorry that your neglect has made her so ill ? For six weeks she has been unwell , and you have never asked a word about her ! Very kind of you , Mr. George , I 'm sure ! "
342378	342381	342384	342385	Mr. Warrington	694	" Kind ! "
342387	342416	342384	342385	Mr. Warrington	694	" I suppose you call it kind to be with her every day and all day for a year , and then to leave her without a word ? "
342417	342429	342430	342430	I	0	" My dear , you know my promise to your father ? "
342433	342436	342438	342439	Miss Hetty	993	" Promise ! "
342445	342616	342442	342442	her	993	" A very fine promise , indeed , to make my darling ill , and then suddenly , one fine day , to say , ' Good - bye , Theo , ' and walk away for ever . I suppose gentlemen make these promises , because they wish to keep 'em . I would n't trifle with a poor child 's heart , and leave her afterwards , if I were a man . What has she ever done to you , but be a fool and too fond of you ? Pray , sir , by what right do you take her away from all of us , and then desert her , because an old woman in America do n't approve of her ? She was happy with us before you came . She loved her sister there never was such a sister until she saw you . And now , because your mamma thinks her young gentleman might do better , you must leave her forsooth ! "
342617	342623	342624	342624	I	0	" Great powers , child ! "
342632	342668	342624	342624	I	0	" Was it I that drew back ? Is it not I that am forbidden your house ? and did not your father require , on my honour , that I should not see her ? "
342669	343103	342442	342442	her	993	" Honour ! And you are the men who pretend to be our superiors ; and it is we who are to respect you and admire you ! I declare , George Warrington , you ought to go back to your schoolroom in Virginia again ; have your black nurse to tuck you up in bed , and ask leave from your mamma when you might walk out . Oh , George ! I little thought that my sister was giving her heart away to a man who had n't the spirit to stand by her ; but , at the first difficulty , left her ! When Doctor Heberden said he was attending you , I determined to come and see you , and you do look very ill , that I am glad to see ; and I suppose it 's your mother you are frightened of . But I sha n't tell Theo that you are unwell . She has n't left off caring for you . She ca n't walk out of a room , break her solemn engagements , and go into the world the next day as if nothing had happened ! That is left for men , our superiors in courage and wisdom ; and to desert an angel yes , an angel ten thousand times too good for you ; an angel who used to love me till she saw you , and who was the blessing of life and of all of us is what you call honour ? Do n't tell me , sir ! I despise you all ! You are our betters , are you ? We are to worship and wait on you , I suppose ? I do n't care about your wit , and your tragedies , and your verses ; and I think they are often very stupid . I wo n't set up of nights copying your manuscripts , nor watch hour after hour at a window wasting my time and neglecting everybody because I want to see your worship walk down the street with your hat cocked ! If you are going away , and welcome , give me back my sister , I say ! Give me back my darling of old days , who loved every one of us , till she saw you . And you leave her because your mamma thinks she can find somebody richer for you ! Oh , you brave gentleman ! Go and marry the person your mother chooses , and let my dear die here deserted ! "
343104	343110	343111	343111	I	0	" Great heavens , Hetty ! "
343123	343176	343111	343111	I	0	" Is it I who wish to leave your sister ? Did I not offer to keep my promise , and was it not your father who refused me , and made me promise never to try and see her again ? What have I but my word , and my honour ? "
343177	343316	343111	343111	I	0	" Honour , indeed ! You keep your word to him , and you break it to her ! Pretty honour ! If I were a man , I would soon let you know what I thought of your honour ! Only I forgot you are bound to keep the peace and must n't ... Oh , George , George ! Do n't you see the grief I am in ? I am distracted , and scarce know what I say . You must not leave my darling . They do n't know it at home . They do n't think so but I know her best of all , and she will die if you leave her . Say you wo n't ! Have pity upon me , Mr. Warrington , and give me my dearest back ! "
343732	343735	343737	343737	he	10994	" Hush , "
343746	343836	343737	343737	he	10994	" I must hear none of this . If two people who happen to know each other chance to meet and talk in my patients ' room , I can not help myself ; but as for match - making and love - making , I am your humble servant ! What will the General do when he comes back to town ? He will have me behind Montagu House as sure as I am a live doctor , and alive I wish to remain , my good sir ! "
343850	343867	343868	343868	he	15875	" And you and Miss Hetty must have no meetings here again , mind you that , "
343997	344042	343994	343994	I	0	" Oh yes , sometimes , my dear ; but I am too wretched for reading now ; I can not see what is on the paper . I do not care about my books . Even Pocahontas is wearisome to me . I ... "
344054	344057	344058	344058	she	15879	" Nonsense ! "
344066	344081	344058	344058	she	15879	" Why , I declare , George , you are more stupid than Harry ! "
344082	344092	344093	344093	I	0	" How do you mean , my dear child ? "
344096	344174	344093	344093	I	0	" When do you go ? You go away at three o'clock . You strike across on the road to Tottenham Court . You walk through the village , and return by the Green Lane that leads back towards the new hospital . You know you do ! If you walk for a week there , it ca n't do you any harm . Good morning , sir ! You 'll please not follow me any farther . "
344400	344427	344397	344397	she	15900	" It appears the lady do n't come , sir ! Your honour had best step in , and take a can of my cool beer . "
344496	344501	344488	344488	his	1784	" George ! George ! "
344605	344615	344617	344617	Hetty	993	" I am taking her an airing to Hampstead , "
344621	344632	344617	344617	Hetty	993	" The doctor says the air will do her good . "
344633	344647	344649	344649	Theo	1778	" I have been ill , but I am better now , George , "
344863	344913	344914	344914	Charley	702	" I think I should like to go and hear it . And that famous Mr. Whitfield , perhaps he is going to preach this very day ! Come in with me , Charley and George can drive for half an hour with dear Theo towards Hampstead and back . "
344955	344972	344974	344975	Miss Hetty	993	" I will never help you in another exercise as long as you live , sir , "
344977	344985	344974	344975	Miss Hetty	993	" if you do n't come on , "
345175	345189	345191	345191	I	0	" I am come to your part of the story , my dear , "
345205	345211	345213	345214	my lady	19701	" To what , pray ? "
345216	345236	345213	345214	my lady	19701	" You should skip all that part , and come to the grand battles , and your heroic defence of "
345237	345274	345286	345287	the boys	2252	" Of Fort Fiddlededee in the year 1778 , when I pulled off Mr. Washington 's epaulet , gouged General Gates 's eye , cut off Charles Lee 's head , and pasted it on again ! "
345275	345284	345286	345287	the boys	2252	" Let us hear all about the fighting , "
345310	345422	345295	345295	he	2104	" Fair and softly , young people ! Everything in its turn . I am not yet arrived at the war . I am only a young gentleman , just stepping into a landau , by the side of a young lady whom I promised to avoid . I am taking her hand , which , after a little ado , she leaves in mine . Do you remember how hot it was , the little thing , how it trembled , and how it throbbed and jumped a hundred and twenty in a minute ? And as we trot on towards Hampstead , I address Miss Lambert in the following terms "
345423	345430	345432	345433	the girls	2275	" Ah , ah , ah ! "
345447	345462	345432	345433	the girls	2275	" Nous ecoutons maintenant . La parole est a vous , Monsieur le Chevalier ! "
345536	345540	345542	345543	the Squire	3169	" Very good , "
345557	345570	345542	345543	the Squire	3169	" We are going to tell your mother 's secrets and mine . "
345571	345580	345582	345584	the house matron	15948	" I am sure you may , papa , "
345586	345595	345582	345584	the house matron	15948	" There 's nothing to be ashamed of . "
345605	345621	345582	345584	the house matron	15948	" But before I begin , young folks , permit me two or three questions . "
345622	345629	345631	345631	mademoiselle	1793	" Allons , toujours des questions ! "
345680	345767	345778	345779	the Captain	2104	" You , Captain Miles Warrington , have the honour of winning the good graces of a lady of ever so many ladies of the Duchess of Devonshire , let us say , of Mrs. Crew , of Mrs. Fitzherbert , of the Queen of Prussia , of the Goddess Venus , of Mademoiselle Hillisberg of the Opera never mind of whom , in fine . If you win a lady 's good graces , do you always go to the mess and tell what happened ? "
345768	345776	345778	345779	the Captain	2104	" Not such a fool , Squire ! "
345789	345816	345778	345779	the Captain	2104	" Have you , Miss Theo , told your mother every word you said to Mr. Joe Blake , junior , in the shrubbery this morning ? "
345817	345823	345825	345826	Theo junior	987	" Joe Blake , indeed ! "
345828	345880	345882	345883	the Squire	3169	" And you , mademoiselle ? That scented billet which came to you under Sir Thomas 's frank , have you told us all the letter contains ? Look how she blushes ! As red as the curtain , on my word ! No , mademoiselle , we all have our secrets "
345892	345963	345882	345883	the Squire	3169	" No , Theo , there was nothing in the shrubbery only nuts , my child ! No , Miles , my son , we do n't tell all , even to the most indulgent of fathers and if I tell what happened in a landau on the Hampstead Road , on the 25th of May , 1760 , may the Chevalier Ruspini pull out every tooth in my head ! "
345964	345970	345972	345972	mamma	19850	" Pray tell , papa ! "
345974	346006	345972	345972	mamma	19850	" or , as Jobson , who drove us , is in your service now , perhaps you will have him in from the stables ! I insist upon your telling ! "
346007	346016	346018	346018	mademoiselle	1797	" What is , then , this mystery ? "
346030	346036	346038	346039	the lady	2586	" Eh , ma fille ! "
346041	346061	346038	346039	the lady	2586	" Thou wouldst ask me what I said ? I said ' Yes ! ' behold all I said . "
346389	346398	346399	346400	Aunt Lambert	1175	" There was nothing like a country ride , "
346403	346463	346399	346400	Aunt Lambert	1175	" for doing her dear Theo good . She had been on the road to Hampstead , had she ? She must have another ride to - morrow . Heaven be blessed , my Lord Wrotham 's horses were at their orders three or four times a week , and the sweet child might have the advantage of them ! "
346800	346839	346790	346790	she	1803	" My child , the country air has done you all the good in the world , and I hope you will take another drive to - morrow , and another , and another , and so on . "
346840	346871	346790	346790	she	1803	" Do n't you think , papa , the ride has done the child most wonderful good , and must not she be made to go out in the air ? "
346886	346910	346911	346911	Lambert	1175	" Yes , sure , if a coach - and - six will do his little Theo good , she shall have it , "
346914	346932	346911	346911	Lambert	1175	" or he will drag the landau up Hampstead Hill himself , if there are no horses ; "
347128	347153	347111	347111	he	7210	" What has done it ? Is it the country air ? is it the Jesuit 's bark ? is it the new medicine ? "
347154	347166	347167	347167	she	13820	" Ca n't you think , dear , what it is ? "
347196	347205	347207	347208	the General	3644	" And what is it , my child ? "
347210	347222	347223	347223	she	13820	" It is because I have seen him again , papa ! "
347260	347269	347270	347270	she	13820	" It was not wrong to see him , "
347276	347287	347270	347270	she	13820	" it would have been wrong not to tell you . "
347288	347292	347294	347295	the father	2841	" Great God ! "
347333	347352	347313	347313	Hetty	993	" Theo knew nothing of it , sir ! It was my doing it was all my doing ! "
347369	347381	347383	347384	the father	2841	" Women , women ! are you playing with my honour ? "
347399	347412	347393	347394	Aunt Lambert	1175	" Martin ! Martin ! Do n't say a word to her ! "
347460	347464	347455	347457	my faithful black	16022	" General Lambert . "
347486	347493	347494	347495	the General	3644	" Your accomplices did not confess , "
347507	347536	347494	347495	the General	3644	" but sided with you against their father a proof how desirable clandestine meetings are . It was from Theo herself I heard that she had seen you . "
347537	347542	347543	347543	I	0	" Accomplices , sir ! "
347559	347613	347543	347543	I	0	" You know how fondly and dutifully your young people regard their father . If they side against you in this instance , it must be because justice is against you . A man like you is not going to set up sic volo sic jubeo as the sole law in his family ! "
347614	347619	347621	347622	the General	3644	" Psha , George ! "
347624	347658	347621	347622	the General	3644	" For though we are parted , God forbid I should desire that we should cease to love each other . I had your promise that you would not seek to see her . "
347659	347669	347670	347670	I	0	" Nor did I go to her , sir , "
347691	347700	347702	347702	Theo	987	" You mean she was brought to you ? "
347710	347731	347702	347702	Theo	987	" Is it behind Hester 's petticoat that you will shelter yourself ? What a fine defence for a gentleman ! "
347732	347745	347746	347746	I	0	" Well , I wo n't screen myself behind the poor child , "
347749	347799	347746	347746	I	0	" To speak as I did was to make an attempt at evasion , and I am ill - accustomed to dissemble . I did not infringe the letter of my agreement , but I acted against the spirit of it . From this moment I annul it altogether . "
347800	347809	347811	347812	Mr. Lambert	1000	" You break your word given to me ! "
347814	347870	347811	347812	Mr. Lambert	1000	" I recall a hasty promise made on a sudden at a moment of extreme excitement and perturbation . No man can be for ever bound by words uttered at such a time ; and , what is more , no man of honour or humanity , Mr. Lambert , would try to bind him . "
347871	347878	347880	347881	the General	3644	" Dishonour to me ! sir , "
347883	347896	347897	347897	I	0	" Yes , if the phrase is to be shuttlecocked between us ! "
347902	348279	347897	347897	I	0	" There can be no question about love , or mutual regard , or difference of age , when that word is used : and were you my own father and I love you better than a father , Uncle Lambert , I would not bear it ! What have I done ? I have seen the woman whom I consider my wife before God and man , and if she calls me I will see her again . If she comes to me , here is my home for her , and the half of the little I have . ' Tis you , who have no right , having made me the gift , to resume it . Because my mother taunts you unjustly , are you to visit Mrs. Esmond 's wrong upon this tender , innocent creature ? You profess to love your daughter , and you ca n't bear a little wounded pride for her sake . Better she should perish away in misery , than an old woman in Virginia should say that Mr. Lambert had schemed to marry one of his daughters . Say that to satisfy what you call honour and I call selfishness , we part , we break our hearts well nigh , we rally , we try to forget each other , we marry elsewhere ? Can any man be to my dear as I have been ? God forbid ! Can any woman be to me what she is ? You shall marry her to the Prince of Wales to - morrow , and it is a cowardice and treason . How can we , how can you , undo the promises we have made to each other before Heaven ? You may part us : and she will die as surely as if she were Jephthah 's daughter . Have you made any vow to Heaven to compass her murder ? Kill her if you conceive your promise so binds you : but this I swear , that I am glad you have come , so that I may here formally recall a hasty pledge which I gave , and that , call me when she will , I will come to her ! "
348425	348441	348443	348444	the General	3644	" We must come , then , to what I had fain have spared myself , "
348452	348647	348443	348444	the General	3644	" to an unfriendly separation . When I meet you , Mr. Warrington , I must know you no more . I must order and they will not do other than obey me my family and children not to recognise you when they see you , since you will not recognise in your intercourse with me the respect due to my age , the courtesy of gentlemen . I had hoped so far from your sense of honour , and the idea I had formed of you , that , in my present great grief and perplexity , I should have found you willing to soothe and help me as far as you might for , God knows , I have need of everybody 's sympathy . But , instead of help , you fling obstacles in my way . Instead of a friend a gracious Heaven pardon me ! I find in you an enemy ! An enemy to the peace of my home and the honour of my children , sir ! And as such I shall treat you , and know how to deal with you , when you molest me ! "
349650	349658	349660	349660	Jack	1728	" It is not merely , sir , "
349667	349698	349660	349660	Jack	1728	" those whom I , John Lambert , Priest , have joined , let no man put asunder ; it is those whom God has joined let no man separate . "
349714	349789	349791	349791	Jack	1728	" My views are clear upon the point , and surely these young people were joined , or permitted to plight themselves to each other by the consent of you , the priest of your own family . My views , I say , are clear , and I will lay them down at length in a series of two or three discourses which , no doubt , will satisfy you . Upon which , "
349793	349843	349791	349791	Jack	1728	" my father said , ' I am satisfied already , my dear boy , ' and my lively little Het who has much archness whispers to me , ' Jack , mother and I will make you a dozen shirts , as sure as eggs is eggs . ' "
349844	349850	349851	349852	Mr. Lambert	1000	" Whilst we were talking , "
349855	349916	349851	349852	Mr. Lambert	1000	" my sister Theodosia made her appearance , I must say very much agitated and pale , kissed our father , and sate down at his side , and took a sippet of toast my dear George , this port is excellent , and I drink your health and took a sippet of toast and dipped it in his negus . "
349942	349982	349984	349984	Jack	1728	" ' Has he ? ' asks Theodosia , who is too languid and weak , poor thing , much to care for the exercises of eloquence , or the display of authorities , such as I must own , "
349986	349998	349984	349984	Jack	1728	" it was given to me this afternoon to bring forward . "
350056	350063	350048	350048	papa	19857	" ' Me , papa ? ' "
350083	350088	350079	350079	papa	19857	" says Mr. Jack . "
350110	350132	350099	350099	her	21422	" ' This is different , sir , ' says I , ' to a passage I remember in Pausanias . ' "
350152	350291	350141	350142	the General	3644	" I smiled at my father 's simplicity in exposing his ignorance before his children . ' When Ulysses was taking away Penelope from her father , the king hastened after his daughter and bridegroom , and besought his darling to return . Whereupon , it is related , Ulysses offered her her choice , whether she would return , or go on with him ? Upon which the daughter of Icarius covered her face with her veil . For want of a veil my sister has taken refuge in your waistcoat , sir , ' I said , and we all laughed ; though my mother vowed that if such a proposal had been made to her , or Penelope had been a girl of spirit , she would have gone home with her father that instant . "
350331	350335	350315	350315	I	0	" continues Jack . "
350451	350872	350444	350444	My	0	" From grief to hope , how rapid the change was ! What a flood of happiness poured into my soul , and glowed in my whole being ! Landlord , more port ! Would honest Jack have drunk a binful I would have treated him ; and , to say truth , Jack 's sympathy was large in this case , and it had been generous all day . I decline to score the bottles of port : and place to the fabulous computations of interested waiters , the amount scored against me in the reckoning . Jack was my dearest , best of brothers . My friendship for him I swore should be eternal . If I could do him any service , were it a bishopric , by George ! he should have it . He says I was interrupted by the watchman rhapsodising verses beneath the loved one 's window . I know not . I know I awoke joyfully and rapturously , in spite of a racking headache the next morning . Nor did I know the extent of my happiness quite , or the entire conversion of my dear noble enemy of the previous morning . It must have been galling to the pride of an elder man to have to yield to representations and objections couched in language so little dutiful as that I had used towards Mr. Lambert . But the true Christian gentleman , retiring from his talk with me , mortified and wounded by my asperity of remonstrance , as well as by the pain which he saw his beloved daughter suffer , went thoughtfully and sadly to his business , as he subsequently told me , and in the afternoon as his custom not unfrequently was into a church which was open for prayers . And it was here , on his knees , submitting his case in the quarter whither he frequently , though privately , came for guidance and comfort , that it seemed to him that his child was right in her persistent fidelity to me , and himself wrong in demanding her utter submission . Hence Jack 's cause was won almost before he began to plead it ; and the brave , gentle heart , which could bear no rancour , which bled at inflicting pain on those it loved , which even shrank from asserting authority or demanding submission , was only too glad to return to its natural pulses of love and affection .
350906	350920	350890	350890	I	0	" From London , April , 1760 . My son 's dreadful letter . "
352785	352798	352800	352802	my pleased kinswoman	16183	" You court her with infinite wit and esprit , my dear , "
352804	352852	352800	352802	my pleased kinswoman	16183	" but she does not understand half you say , and the other half , I think , frightens her . This ton de persiflage is very well in our society , but you must be sparing of it , my dear nephew , amongst these roturiers . "

353885	355087	355088	355088	I	0	" of every day 's parting but made the morrow 's meeting more delightful ; and when we separated we ran home and wrote each other those precious letters which we and other young gentlemen and ladies write under such circumstances ; but though my wife has them all in a great tin sugar - box in the closet in her bedroom , and , I own , I myself have looked at them once , and even thought some of them pretty , I hereby desire my heirs and executors to burn them all , unread , at our demise ; specially desiring my son the Captain to whom I know the perusal of MSS . is not pleasant to perform this duty . Those secrets whispered to the penny - post , or delivered between Molly and Gumbo , were intended for us alone , and no ears of our descendants shall overhear them . We heard in successive brief letters how our dear Harry continued with the army , as Mr. General Amherst 's aide - de - camp , after the death of his own glorious general . By the middle of October there came news of the Capitulation of Montreal and the whole of Canada , and a brief postscript in which Hal said he would ask for leave now , and must go and see the old lady at home , who wrote as sulky as a bare , Captain Warrington remarked . I could guess why , though the claws could not reach me . I had written pretty fully to my brother how affairs were standing with me in England . Then , on the 25th October , comes the news that his Majesty has fallen down dead at Kensington , and that George III . reigned over us . I fear we grieved but little . What do those care for the Atridae whose hearts are strung only to erota mounon ? A modest , handsome , brave new Prince , we gladly accept the common report that he is endowed with every virtue ; and we cry huzzay with the loyal crowd that hails his accession : it could make little difference to us , as we thought , simple young sweethearts , whispering our little love - stories in our corner . But who can say how great events affect him ? Did not our little Charley , at the Chartreux , wish impiously for a new king immediately , because on his gracious Majesty 's accession Doctor Crusius gave his boys a holiday ? He and I , and Hetty , and Theo Miss Theo was strong enough to walk many a delightful mile now , heard the Heralds proclaim his new Majesty before Savile House in Leicester Fields , and a pickpocket got the watch and chain of a gentleman hard by us , and was caught and carried to Bridewell , all on account of his Majesty 's accession . Had the king not died , the gentleman would not have been in the crowd ; the chain would not have been seized ; the thief would not have been caught and soundly whipped : in this way many of us , more or less remotely , were implicated in the great change which ensued , and even we humble folks were affected by it presently . As thus . My Lord Wrotham was a great friend of the august family of Savile House , who knew and esteemed his many virtues . Now , of all living men , my Lord Wrotham knew and loved best his neighbour and old fellow - soldier , Martin Lambert , declaring that the world contained few better gentlemen . And my Lord Bute , being all potent , at first , with his Majesty , and a nobleman , as I believe , very eager at the commencement of his brief and luckless tenure of power , to patronise merit wherever he could find it , was strongly prejudiced in Mr. Lambert 's favour by the latter 's old and constant friend . My and Harry 's old friend Parson Sampson , who had been in and out of gaol I do n't know how many times of late years , and retained an ever - enduring hatred for the Esmonds of Castlewood , and as lasting a regard for me and my brother , was occupying poor Hal 's vacant bed at my lodgings at this time being , in truth , hunted out of his own by the bailiffs . I liked to have Sampson near me , for a more amusing Jack - friar never walked in cassock ; and , besides , he entered into all my rhapsodies about Miss Theo ; was never tired so he vowed of hearing me talk of her ; admired Pocahontas and Carpezan with , I do believe , an honest enthusiasm ; and could repeat whole passages of those tragedies with an emphasis and effect that Barry or cousin Hagan himself could not surpass . Sampson was the go - between between Lady Maria and such of her relations as had not disowned her ; and , always in debt himself , was never more happy than in drinking a pot , or mingling his tears with his friends in similar poverty . His acquaintance with pawnbrokers ' shops was prodigious . He could procure more money , he boasted , on an article than any gentleman of his cloth . He never paid his own debts , to be sure , but he was ready to forgive his debtors . Poor as he was , he always found means to love and help his needy little sister , and a more prodigal , kindly , amiable rogue never probably grinned behind bars . They say that I love to have parasites about me . I own to have had a great liking for Sampson , and to have esteemed him much better than probably much better men . When he heard how my Lord Bute was admitted into the cabinet , Sampson vowed and declared that his lordship a great lover of the drama , who had been to see Carpezan , who had admired it , and who would act the part of the king very finely in it he vowed , by George ! that my lord must give me a place worthy of my birth and merits . He insisted upon it that I should attend his lordship 's levee . I would n't ? The Esmonds were all as proud as Lucifer ; and , to be sure , my birth was as good as that of any man in Europe . Demmy ! Where was my lord himself when the Esmonds were lords of great counties , warriors , and Crusaders ? Where were they ? Beggarly Scotchmen , without a rag to their backs by George ! tearing raw fish in their islands . But now the times were changed . The Scotchmen were in luck . Mum 's the word ! "
355094	355098	355088	355088	I	0	" says Sampson , "
355120	355201	355202	355202	Huzza	1834	" would my worthy parson roar out . And when , in the month after his accession , his Majesty ordered the play of Richard III . at Drury Lane , my chaplain cursed , vowed , swore , but he would have him to Covent Garden to see Carpezan too . And now , one morning , he bursts into my apartment , where I happened to lie rather late , waving the newspaper in his hand , and singing "
355204	355210	355202	355202	Huzza	1834	" with all his might . "
355217	355220	355215	355215	Sampson	906	" says I. "

355269	355373	355241	355241	Huzzay	843	" I started up . Here was news , indeed ! Mr. Lambert would go to his government : and who would go with him ? I had been supping with some genteel young fellows at the Cocoa - Tree . The rascal Gumbo had a note for me from my dear mistress on the night previous , conveying the same news to me , and had delayed to deliver it . Theo begged me to see her at the old place at midday the next day without fail . In the Warrington MS . there is not a word to say what the "
355376	355495	355241	355241	Huzzay	843	" was . Perhaps some obliging reader of Notes and Queries will be able to inform me , and who Mrs. Goodison was.-ED . There was no little trepidation in our little council when we reached our place of meeting . Papa had announced his acceptance of the appointment , and his speedy departure . He would have a frigate given him , and take his family with him . Merciful powers ! and were we to be parted ? My Theo 's old deathly paleness returned to her . Aunt Lambert thought she would have swooned ; one of Mrs. Goodison 's girls had a bottle of salts , and ran up with it from the workroom . "
355526	355671	355519	355520	Aunt Lambert	1175	" She was better when mamma came up from the workroom with the young lady 's bottle of salts . You see the women used to meet me : knowing dear Theo 's delicate state , how could they refrain from compassionating her ! But the General was so busy with his levees and his waiting on Ministers , and his outfit , and the settlement of his affairs at home , that they never happened to tell him about our little walks and meetings ; and even when orders for the outfit of the ladies were given , Mrs. Goodison , who had known and worked for Miss Molly Benson as a schoolgirl she remembered Miss Esmond of Virginia perfectly , the worthy lady told me , and a dress she made for the young lady to be presented at her Majesty 's Ball "
355683	355690	355519	355520	Aunt Lambert	1175	" says Mrs. Goodison , demurely , "
355705	356248	355693	355693	I	0	" Now I need not say in what perturbation of mind Mr. Warrington went home in the evening to his lodgings , after the discussion with the ladies of the above news . No , or at least a very few , more walks ; no more rides to dear , dear Hampstead or beloved Islington ; no more fetching and carrying of letters for Gumbo and Molly ! The former blubbered so , that Mr. Warrington was quite touched by his fidelity , and gave him a crown - piece to go to supper with the poor girl , who turned out to be his sweetheart . What , you too unhappy , Gumbo , and torn from the maid you love ? I was ready to mingle with him tear for tear . What a solemn conference I had with Sampson that evening ! He knew my affairs , my expectations , my mother 's anger . Psha ! that was far off , and he knew some excellent liberal people of the order of Melchizedek who would discount the other . The General would not give his consent ? Sampson shrugged his broad shoulders and swore a great roaring oath . My mother would not relent ? What then ? A man was a man , and to make his own way in the world ? he supposed . He is only a churl who wo n't play for such a stake as that , and lose or win , by George ! shouts the chaplain , over a bottle of Burgundy at the Bedford Head , where he dined . I need not put down our conversation . We were two of us , and I think there was only one mind between us . Our talk was of a Saturday night .... I did not tell Theo , nor any relative of hers , what was being done . But when the dear child faltered and talked , trembling , of the coming departure , I bade her bear up , and vowed all would be well , so confidently , that she , who ever has taken her alarms and joys from my face I wish , my dear , it were sometimes not so gloomy , could not but feel confidence ; and placed with many fond words that need not here be repeated her entire trust in me murmuring those sweet words of Ruth that must have comforted myriads of tender hearts in my dearest maiden 's plight ; that whither I would go she would go , and that my people should be hers . At last , one day , the General 's preparations being made , the trunks encumbering the passages of the dear old Dean Street lodging , which I shall love as long as I shall remember at all one day , almost the last of his stay , when the good man his Excellency we called him now came home to his dinner a comfortless meal enough it was in the present condition of the family he looked round the table at the place where I had used to sit in happy old days , and sighed out : "

356440	356484	356422	356422	he	694	" And when I entered he held me to his heart , and kissed me . I confess at this I was so overcome that I fell down on my knees before the dear , good man , and sobbed on his own . "
356493	356498	356422	356422	he	694	" he mutters hurriedly . "

358651	358660	358662	358663	the Doctor	5377	" Nay , sir , conversation is better , "
358665	358732	358662	358663	the Doctor	5377	" I can read for myself , or hear you at the theatre . I had rather hear Mrs. Warrington 's artless prattle than your declamation of Mr. Warrington 's decasyllables . Tell us about your household affairs , madam , and whether his Excellency your father is well , and whether you made the pudden and the butter sauce . The butter sauce was delicious ! "
358754	358778	358739	358739	he	1656	" You made it as though you loved me . You helped me as though you loved me , though you do n't . "

358818	358873	358815	358816	the Doctor	5377	" You are unacquainted with the first principles of politeness , which is courtesy before ladies . Having received an university education , I am surprised that you have not learned the rudiments of politeness . I respect Mrs. Warrington . I should never think of making personal remarks about her guests before her ! "
358874	358879	358881	358881	Hagan	1656	" Then , sir , "
358885	358894	358881	358881	Hagan	1656	" why did you speak of my theatre ? "
358895	358902	358904	358905	the Doctor	5377	" Sir , you are saucy ! "

359324	359636	359321	359322	Captain Smith	1669	" Upon this tragedy not only my literary hopes , but much of my financial prospects were founded . My brother 's debts discharged , my mother 's drafts from home duly honoured , my own expenses paid , which , though moderate , were not inconsiderable , pretty nearly the whole of my patrimony had been spent , and this auspicious moment I must choose for my marriage ! I could raise money on my inheritance : that was not impossible , though certainly costly . My mother could not leave her eldest son without a maintenance , whatever our quarrels might be . I had health , strength , good wits , some friends , and reputation above all , my famous tragedy , which the manager had promised to perform , and upon the proceeds of this I counted for my present support . What becomes of the arithmetic of youth ? How do we then calculate that a hundred pounds is a maintenance , and a thousand a fortune ? How did I dare play against Fortune with such odds ? I succeeded , I remember , in convincing my dear General , and he left home convinced that his son - in - law had for the present necessity at least a score of hundred pounds at his command . He and his dear Molly had begun life with less , and the ravens had somehow always fed them . As for the women , the question of poverty was one of pleasure to those sentimental souls , and Aunt Lambert , for her part , declared it would be wicked and irreligious to doubt of a provision being made for her children . Was the righteous ever forsaken ? Did the just man ever have to beg his bread ? She knew better than that ! "
359666	359861	359663	359664	my General	24720	" Theo believed all I said and wished to believe myself . So we actually began life upon a capital of Five Acts , and about three hundred pounds of ready money in hand ! Well , the time of the appearance of the famous tragedy drew near , and my friends canvassed the town to get a body of supporters for the opening night . I am ill at asking favours from the great ; but when my Lord Wrotham came to London , I went , with Theo in my hand , to wait on his lordship , who received us kindly , out of regard for his old friend , her father though he good - naturedly shook a finger at me at which my little wife hung down her head , for having stole a march on the good General . However , he would do his best for her father 's daughter ; hoped for a success ; said he had heard great things of the piece ; and engaged a number of places for himself and his friends . But this patron secured , I had no other . "

As for my uncle and Lady Warrington , they were out of the question . After the affair of the sedan - chair I might as well have asked Queen Elizabeth to go to Drury Lane . These were all my friends that host of aristocratic connexions about whom poor Sampson had bragged ; and on the strength of whom , the manager , as he said , had given Mr. Hagan his engagement ! "

370205	370326	370203	370203	he	5377	" are fortunate in every way . They can engage the most skilful practitioners of the culinary art , as they can assemble the most amiable wits round their table . If , as you think , sir , and , from the appearance of the dish , your suggestion at least is plausible , this sweetmeat may have appeared already at his lordship 's table , it has been there in good company . It has quivered under the eyes of celebrated beauties , it has been tasted by ruby lips , it has divided the attention of the distinguished company , with fruits , tarts , and creams , which I make no doubt were like itself delicious .

When the Dowager of Castlewood and Lady Fanny visited her these exalted ladies treated my wife with perfect indifference and charming good breeding , the Baroness , in their society , was stately , easy , and even commanding . She would mischievously caress Mrs. Warrington before them ; in her absence , vaunt my wife 's good breeding ; say that her nephew had made a foolish match , perhaps , but that I certainly had taken a charming wife . "
375283	375287	375273	375273	I	0	" says she , "
375300	375846	375847	375847	I	0	" But , before the little American , ' tis certain that she was uneasy and trembled . She was so afraid , that she actually did not dare to deny her door ; and , the Countess 's back turned , did not even abuse her . However much they might dislike her , my ladies did not tear out Theo 's eyes . Once they drove to our cottage at Lambeth , where my wife happened to be sitting at the open window , holding her child on her knee , and in full view of her visitors . A gigantic footman strutted through our little garden , and delivered their ladyships ' visiting tickets at our door . Their hatred hurt us no more than their visit pleased us . When next we had the loan of our friend the Brewer 's carriage Mrs. Warrington drove to Kensington , and Gumbo handed over to the giant our cards in return for those which his noble mistresses had bestowed on us . The Baroness had a coach , but seldom thought of giving it to us : and would let Theo and her maid and baby start from Clarges Street in the rain , with a faint excuse that she was afraid to ask her coachman to take his horses out . But , twice on her return home , my wife was frightened by rude fellows on the other side of Westminster Bridge ; and I fairly told my aunt that I should forbid Mrs. Warrington to go to her , unless she could be brought home in safety ; so grumbling Jehu had to drive his horses through the darkness . He grumbled at my shillings : he did not know how few I had . Our poverty wore a pretty decent face . My relatives never thought of relieving it , nor I of complaining before them . I do n't know how Sampson got a windfall of guineas ; but , I remember , he brought me six once ; and they were more welcome than any money I ever had in my life . He had been looking into Mr. Miles 's crib , as the child lay asleep ; and , when the parson went away , I found the money in the baby 's little rosy hand . Yes , Love is best of all . I have many such benefactions registered in my heart precious welcome fountains springing up in desert places , kind , friendly lights cheering our despondency and gloom . This worthy divine was willing enough to give as much of his company as she chose to Madame de Bernstein , whether for cards or theology . Having known her ladyship for many years now , Sampson could see , and averred to us , that she was breaking fast ; and as he spoke of her evidently increasing infirmities , and of the probability of their fatal termination , Mr. S. would discourse to us in a very feeling manner of the necessity for preparing for a future world ; of the vanities of this , and of the hope that in another there might be happiness for all repentant sinners . "

376017	376050	376004	376005	Mr. Case	1230	" In fact Madame Bernstein told my wife , whom she never refused , as I said , that the poor chaplain 's ton was unendurable , and as for his theology , "
376060	376064	376055	376058	a Bishop 's wife	17133	" says she , "
376075	376362	376363	376363	Henry	701	" The old lady was as impatient of doctors as of divines ; pretending that my wife was ailing , and that it was more convenient for our good Doctor Heberden to visit her in Clarges Street than to travel all the way to our Lambeth lodgings , we got Dr. H. to see Theo at our aunt 's house , and prayed him if possible to offer his advice to the Baroness : we made Mrs. Brett , her woman , describe her ailments , and the doctor confirmed our opinion that they were most serious , and might speedily end . She would rally briskly enough of some evenings , and entertain a little company ; but of late she scarcely went abroad at all . A somnolence , which we had remarked in her , was attributable in part to opiates which she was in the habit of taking ; and she used these narcotics to smother habitual pain . One night , as we two sat with her Mr. Miles was weaned by this time , and his mother could leave him to the charge of our faithful Molly , she fell asleep over her cards . We hushed the servants who came to lay out the supper - table she would always have this luxurious , nor could any injunction of ours or the Doctor 's teach her abstinence , and we sat a while as we had often done before , waiting in silence till she should arouse from her doze . When she awoke , she looked fixedly at me for a while , fumbled with the cards , and dropt them again in her lap , and said , "
376371	376407	376363	376363	Henry	701	" I thought at first that it was for my brother she mistook me ; but she went on quickly , and with eyes fixed as upon some very far distant object , and said , "
376446	376459	376438	376438	Harry	701	" Here her voice changed , and she flung her head up . "
376519	376541	376544	376544	Henri	1424	" Here she broke out into frightful hysterical shrieks and laughter , and as we ran up to her , alarmed , "
376546	376550	376544	376544	Henri	1424	" she says , "
376591	376862	376863	376863	They	17140	" And the pitiful shrieks and laughter recommenced . Ere her frightened people had come up to her summons , the poor thing had passed out of this mood into another ; but always labouring under the same delusion that I was the Henry of past times , who had loved her and had been forsaken by her , whose bones were lying far away by the banks of the Potomac . My wife and the women put the poor lady to bed as I ran myself for medical aid . She rambled , still talking wildly , through the night , with her nurses and the surgeon sitting by her . Then she fell into a sleep , brought on by more opiate . When she awoke , her mind did not actually wander ; but her speech was changed , and one arm and side were paralysed . ' Tis needless to relate the progress and termination of her malady , or watch that expiring flame of life as it gasps and flickers . Her senses would remain with her for a while and then she was never satisfied unless Theo was by her bedside , or again her mind would wander , and the poor decrepit creature , lying upon her bed , would imagine herself young again , and speak incoherently of the scenes and incidents of her early days . Then she would address me as Henry again , and call upon me to revenge some insult or slight , of which whatever my suspicions might be the only record lay in her insane memory . "
376869	376874	376893	376893	je	0	" she would murmur : "
376982	377180	377181	377182	the Doctor	5377	" and here the unhappy paralysed lady made as if she would move in her bed . Let us draw the curtain round it . I think with awe still , of those rapid words , uttered in the shadow of the canopy , as my pallid wife sits by her , her Prayer - book on her knee ; as the attendants move to and fro noiselessly ; as the clock ticks without , and strikes the fleeting hours ; as the sun falls upon the Kneller picture of Beatrix in her beauty , with the blushing cheeks , the smiling lips , the waving auburn tresses , and the eyes which seem to look towards the dim figure moaning in the bed . I could not for a while understand why our aunt 's attendants were so anxious that we should quit it . But towards evening , a servant stole in , and whispered her woman ; and then Brett , looking rather disturbed , begged us to go downstairs , as the as the Doctor was come to visit the Baroness . I did not tell my wife , at the time , who "
377183	377351	377181	377182	the Doctor	5377	" was ; but as the gentleman slid by us , and passed upstairs , I saw at once that he was a Catholic ecclesiastic . When Theo next saw our poor lady , she was speechless ; she never recognised any one about her , and so passed unconsciously out of life . During her illness her relatives had called assiduously enough , though she would see none of them save us . But when she was gone , and we descended to the lower rooms after all was over , we found Castlewood with his white face , and my lady from Kensington , and Mr. Will already assembled in the parlour . They looked greedily at us as we appeared . They were hungry for the prey . When our aunt 's will was opened , we found it dated five years back , and everything she had was left to her dear nephew , Henry Esmond Warrington , of Castlewood , in Virginia , "
377364	377903	377181	377182	the Doctor	5377	" The property was not great . Her revenue had been derived from pensions from the Crown as it appeared for what services I can not say , but the pension of course died with her , and there were only a few hundred pounds , besides jewels , trinkets , and the furniture of the house in Clarges Street , of which all London came to the sale . Mr. Walpole bid for her portrait , but I made free with Harry 's money so far as to buy the picture in : and it now hangs over the mantelpiece of the chamber in which I write . What with jewels , laces , trinkets , and old china which she had gathered Harry became possessed of more than four thousand pounds by his aunt 's legacy . I made so free as to lay my hand upon a hundred , which came , just as my stock was reduced to twenty pounds ; and I procured bills for the remainder , which I forwarded to Captain Henry Esmond in Virginia . Nor should I have scrupled to take more for my brother was indebted to me in a much greater sum , but he wrote me there was another wonderful opportunity for buying an estate and negroes in our neighbourhood at home ; and Theo and I were only too glad to forgo our little claim , so as to establish our brother 's fortune . As to mine , poor Harry at this time did not know the state of it . My mother had never informed him that she had ceased remitting to me . She helped him with a considerable sum , the result of her savings , for the purchase of his new estate ; and Theo and I were most heartily thankful at his prosperity . And how strange ours was ! By what curious good fortune , as our purse was emptied , was it filled again ! I had actually come to the end of our stock , when poor Sampson brought me his six pieces and with these I was enabled to carry on , until my half - year 's salary , as young Mr. Foker 's Governor , was due : then Harry 's hundred , on which I laid main basse , helped us over three months we were behindhand with our rent , or the money would have lasted six good weeks longer : and when this was pretty near expended , what should arrive but a bill of exchange for a couple of hundred pounds from Jamaica , with ten thousand blessings , from the dear friends there , and fond scolding from the General that we had not sooner told him of our necessity of which he had only heard through our friend , Mr. Foker , who spoke in such terms of Theo and myself as to make our parents more than ever proud of their children . Was my quarrel with my mother irreparable ? Let me go to Jamaica . There was plenty there for all , and employment which his Excellency as Governor would immediately procure for me . "

Oh , dear brother ! when I remember how great your goodness hath been , how , in my own want , you paid my debts , and rescued me out of prison ; how you have been living in poverty which never need have occurred but for my fault ; how you might have paid yourself back my just debt to you and would not , preferring my advantage to your own comfort , indeed I am lost at the thought of such goodness ; and ought I not to be thankful to Heaven that hath given me such a wife and such a brother ?

It lies handy enough to Richmond , between Kent and Hanover Court House the mansion nothing for elegance compared to ours at Castlewood , but the land excellent and the people extraordinary healthy .

You remember Miss Betsy Pitts at Williamsburgh ? She is in no wise improved by having had her face dreadfully scarred with small - pock , and though Madam Esmond saith the young lady hath every virtue , I own her virtues did not suit me . Her eyes do not look straight ; she hath one leg shorter than another ; and oh , brother ! didst thou never remark Fanny 's ankles when we were boys ? Neater I never saw at the Opera . "

383703	383836	383838	383838	You	17408	" ' I try to seduce no one , madam , ' I cried out . ' If I utter oaths and blasphemies , I beg your pardon ; but you are enough to provoke a saint to speak 'em . I wo n't have this young lady 's character assailed no , not by own mother nor any mortal alive . No , dear Miss Mountain ! If Madam Esmond chooses to say that my designs on you are dishonourable , let this undeceive her ! ' And , as I spoke , I went down on my knees , seizing my adorable Fanny 's hand . ' And if you will accept this heart and hand , miss , ' says I , ' they are yours for ever . ' "
383919	383946	383900	383901	your ladyship	19813	" ' Of course , madam , I never intended you should ; and the sooner you leave it the better , ' cries our mother . "
384147	384314	384130	384131	our mother	19963	" Now , what our mother meant by her crime I did not know at first , or indeed take much heed of what she said ; for you know her way , and how , when she is angry , she always talks sermons . But Mountain told me afterwards , when we had some talk together , as we did at the tavern , whither the ladies presently removed with their bag and baggage for not only would they not stay at Madam 's house after the language she used , but my mother determined to go away likewise . She called her servants together , and announced her intention of going home instantly to Castlewood ; and I own to you ' twas with a horrible pain I saw the family coach roll by , with six horses , and ever so many of the servants on mules and on horseback , as I and Fanny looked through the blinds of the Tavern .

391049	391176	391043	391043	she	2643	" I have often and often told our dear Theo that I would n't have a pretty sister in my house to make tea for Jack when I was upstairs , and always to be at hand when I was wanted in the kitchen or nursery , and always to be dressed neat and in her best when I was very likely making pies or puddings or looking to the children . I have every confidence in Jack , of course . I should like to see him look at another woman , indeed ! And so I have in Jemima but they do n't come together in my house when I 'm upstairs that I promise you ! And so I told my sister Warrington . "
391177	391183	391185	391186	the General	3644	" Am I to understand , "
391188	391210	391043	391043	she	2643	" that you have done my Lady Warrington the favour to warn her against her sister , my daughter Miss Hester ? "
391211	391269	391043	391043	she	2643	" Yes , pa , of course I have . A duty is a duty , and a woman is a woman , and a man 's a man , as I know very well . Do n't tell me ! He is a man . Every man is a man , with all his sanctified airs ! "
391270	391296	391298	391299	the General	3644	" You yourself have a married sister , with whom you were staying when my son Jack first had the happiness of making your acquaintance ? "
391301	391333	391298	391299	the General	3644	" Yes , of course I have a married sister ; every one knows that and I have been as good as a mother to her children , that I have ! "
391334	391356	391043	391043	she	2643	" And am I to gather from your conversation that your attractions proved a powerful temptation for your sister 's husband ? "
391357	391381	391383	391384	Mrs. Jack	1936	" Law , General ! I do n't know how you can go for to say I ever said any such a thing ! "
391390	391422	391383	391384	Mrs. Jack	1936	" Do n't you perceive , my dear madam , that it is you who have insinuated as much , not only regarding yourself , but regarding my own two daughters ? "
391423	391483	391043	391043	she	2643	" Never , never , never , as I 'm a Christian woman ! And it 's most cruel of you to say so , sir . And I do say a sister is best out of the house , that I do ! And as Theo 's time is coming , I warn her , that 's all . "
391484	391532	391043	391043	she	2643	" Have you discovered , my good madam , whether my poor Hetty has stolen any of the spoons ? When I came to breakfast this morning , my daughter was alone , and there must have been a score of pieces of silver on the table . "
391533	391605	391383	391384	Mrs. Jack	1936	" Law , sir ! who ever said a word about spoons ? Did I ever accuse the poor dear ? If I did , may I drop down dead at this moment on this hearth - rug ! And I ai n't used to be spoke to in this way . And me and Jack have both remarked it ; and I 've done my duty , that I have . "
391619	391635	391637	391638	the General	3644	" And has the woman had the impudence to tell you this , my child ? "
391654	391724	391641	391641	Theo	987	" She has told me every day since she has been here . She comes into my dressing - room to tell me . She comes to my nursery , and says , ' Ah , I would n't have a sister prowling about my nursery , that I would n't . ' Ah , how pleasant it is to have amiable and well - bred relatives , say I. "
391725	391735	391737	391738	the General	3644	" Thy poor mother has been spared this woman , "
391740	391751	391753	391753	Theo	987	" Our mother would have made her better , papa , "
391758	391763	391753	391753	Theo	987	" Yes , dear . "
392186	392191	392192	392192	he	701	" She sees me , "
392195	392305	392192	392192	he	701	" and we are pretty good friends ; but Fanny and she are best apart ; and there is no love lost between 'em , I can promise you . Come over to me at the Tavern , George , when thou art free . And to - morrow I shall have the honour to present her sister to Theo . ' Twas only from happening to be in town yesterday that I heard the ship was signalled , and waited to see you . I have sent a negro boy home to my wife , and she 'll be here to pay her respects to my Lady Warrington . "

393568	393584	393558	393572	a general who says to an army in revolt , " God save the king	28554	" God save the king ! My men , you have a right to mutiny ! "
394821	394829	394831	394832	Madam Esmond	683	" You know these , my dear ? "
394841	394886	394831	394832	Madam Esmond	683	" Fanny hath often cleaned them when she was with me at Castlewood . And this dress , too , Fanny knows , I dare say ? Her poor mother had the care of it . I always had the greatest confidence in her . "
394912	394922	394923	394923	Madam	683	" Oh , she was a treasure to me ! "
394926	394986	394923	394923	Madam	683	" I never should have nursed my boys through their illnesses but for your mother 's admirable care of them . Colonel Lee , permit me to present you to my daughter , my Lady Warrington . Her ladyship is a neighbour of your relatives the Bunburys at home . Here comes his Excellency . Welcome , my lord ! "
395020	395026	395028	395029	Mr. Lee	1948	" By George ! madam , "
395049	395050	395045	395046	your ladyship	19813	" "
395061	395065	395066	395066	He	1949	" asks Madam . "
395078	395083	395066	395066	He	1949	" replies Mr. Lee . "
395099	395100	395085	395085	I	0	" "
395107	395116	395103	395105	Sir George Warrington	1588	" says my mother , pointing to me . "
395154	395510	395152	395152	him	1718	" And the ardent Lee swaggers up to Harry , and takes his hand with respect , and pays him a compliment or two , which makes me , at least , pardon him for his late impertinence ; for my dearest Hal walks gloomily through his mother 's rooms in his old uniform of the famous corps which he has quitted . We had had many meetings , which the stern mother could not interrupt , and in which that instinctive love which bound us to one another , and which nothing could destroy , had opportunity to speak . Entirely unlike each other in our pursuits , our tastes , our opinions his life being one of eager exercise , active sport , and all the amusements of the field , while mine is to dawdle over books and spend my time in languid self - contemplation we have , nevertheless , had such a sympathy as almost passes the love of women . My poor Hal confessed as much to me , for his part , in his artless manner , when we went away without wives or womankind , except a few negroes left in the place , and passed a week at Castlewood together . The ladies did not love each other . I know enough of my Lady Theo , to see after a very few glances whether or not she takes a liking to another of her amiable sex . All my powers of persuasion or command fail to change the stubborn creature 's opinion . Had she ever said a word against Mrs. This or Miss That ? Not she ! Has she been otherwise than civil ? No , assuredly ! My Lady Theo is polite to a beggar - woman , treats her kitchenmaids like duchesses , and murmurs a compliment to the dentist for his elegant manner of pulling her tooth out . She would black my boots , or clean the grate , if I ordained it always looking like a duchess the while ; but as soon as I say to her , "
395524	395766	395152	395152	him	1718	" all obedience ceases ; she executes the most refined curtseys ; smiles and kisses even to order ; but performs that mysterious undefinable freemasonic signal , which passes between women , by which each knows that the other hates her . So , with regard to Fanny , we had met at her house , and at others . I remembered her affectionately from old days , I fully credited poor Hal 's violent protests and tearful oaths , that , by George , it was our mother 's persecution which made him marry her . He could n't stand by and see a poor thing tortured as she was , without coming to her rescue ; no , by heavens , he could n't ! I say I believed all this ; and had for my sister - in - law a genuine compassion , as well as an early regard ; and yet I had no love to give her ; and , in reply to Hal 's passionate outbreaks in praise of her beauty and worth , and eager queries to me whether I did not think her a perfect paragon ? I could only answer with faint compliments or vague approval , feeling all the while that I was disappointing my poor ardent fellow , and cursing inwardly that revolt against flattery and falsehood into which I sometimes frantically rush . Why should I not say , "
395789	396070	395777	395777	her	18033	" as I might have said by a little common stretch of politeness ? Why could I not cajole this or that stupid neighbour or relative , as I have heard Theo do a thousand times , finding all sorts of lively prattle to amuse them , whilst I sit before them dumb and gloomy ? I say it was a sin not to have more words to say in praise of Fanny . We ought to have praised her , we ought to have liked her . My Lady Warrington certainly ought to have liked her , for she can play the hypocrite , and I can not . And there was this young creature pretty , graceful , shaped like a nymph , with beautiful black eyes and we cared for them no more than for two gooseberries ! At Warrington my wife and I , when we pretended to compare notes , elaborately complimented each other on our new sister 's beauty . What lovely eyes ! Oh yes ! What a sweet little dimple on her chin ! Ah oui ! What wonderful little feet ! Perfectly Chinese ! where should we in London get slippers small enough for her ? And , these compliments exhausted , we knew that we did not like Fanny the value of one penny - piece ; we knew that we disliked her ; we knew that we ha ... Well , what hypocrites women are ! We heard from many quarters how eagerly my brother had taken up the new anti - English opinion , and what a champion he was of so - called American rights and freedom . "
396079	396086	396073	396073	her	18035	" says I to my wife . "
396103	397007	396097	396097	you	18037	" says my Lady Warrington , laughing : and I did straightway begin to scold her , and say it was most cruel of her to suspect our new sister ; and what earthly right had we to do so ? But I say again , I know Madam Theo so well , that when once she has got a prejudice against a person in her little head , not all the king 's horses nor all the king 's men will get it out again . I vow nothing would induce her to believe that Harry was not henpecked nothing . Well , we went to Castlewood together without the women , and stayed at the dreary , dear old place , where we had been so happy , and I , at least , so gloomy . It was winter , and duck - time , and Harry went away to the river , and shot dozens and scores and bushels of canvasbacks , whilst I remained in my grandfather 's library amongst the old mouldering books which I loved in my childhood which I see in a dim vision still resting on a little boy 's lap , as he sits by an old white - headed gentleman 's knee . I read my books ; I slept in my own bed and room religiously kept , as my mother told me , and left as on the day when I went to Europe . Hal 's cheery voice would wake me , as of old . Like all men who love to go a - field , he was an early riser : he would come and wake me , and sit on the foot of the bed and perfume the air with his morning pipe , as the house negroes laid great logs on the fire . It was a happy time ! Old Nathan had told me of cunning crypts where ancestral rum and claret were deposited . We had had cares , struggles , battles , bitter griefs , and disappointments ; we were boys again as we sat there together . I am a boy now even as I think of the time . That unlucky tea - tax , which alone of the taxes lately imposed upon the colonies , the home Government was determined to retain , was met with defiance throughout America . ' Tis true we paid a shilling in the pound at home , and asked only threepence from Boston or Charleston ; but as a question of principle , the impost was refused by the provinces , which indeed ever showed a most spirited determination to pay as little as they could help . In Charleston the tea - ships were unloaded , and the cargoes stored in cellars . From New York and Philadelphia , the vessels were turned back to London . In Boston where there was an armed force , whom the inhabitants were perpetually mobbing , certain patriots , painted and disguised as Indians , boarded the ships , and flung the obnoxious cargoes into the water . The wrath of our white Father was kindled against this city of Mohocks in masquerade . The notable Boston Port Bill was brought forward in the British House of Commons ; the port was closed , and the Custom House removed to Salem . The Massachusetts Charter was annulled ; and , in just apprehension that riots might ensue , in dealing with the perpetrators of which the colonial courts might be led to act partially , Parliament decreed that persons indicted for acts of violence and armed resistance , might be sent home , or to another colony , for trial . If such acts set all America in a flame , they certainly drove all wellwisbers of our country into a fury . I might have sentenced Master Miles Warrington , at five years old , to a whipping , and he would have cried , taken down his little small - clothes and submitted : but suppose I offered and he richly deserving it to chastise Captain Miles of the Prince 's Dragoons ? He would whirl my paternal cane out of my hand , box my hair - powder out of my ears . Lord a - mercy ! I tremble at the very idea of the controversy ? He would assert his independence in a word ; and if , I say , I think the home Parliament had a right to levy taxes in the colonies , I own that we took means most captious , most insolent , most irritating , and , above all , most impotent , to assert our claim . My Lord Dunmore , our Governor of Virginia , upon Lord Bottetourt 's death , received me into some intimacy soon after my arrival in the colony , being willing to live on good terms with all our gentry . My mother 's severe loyalty was no secret to him ; indeed , she waved the king 's banner in all companies , and talked so loudly and resolutely , that Randolph and Patrick Henry himself were struck dumb before her . It was Madam Esmond 's celebrated reputation for loyalty his Excellency laughingly told me which induced him to receive her eldest son to grace . "
397019	397024	397008	397008	I	0	" his lordship said . "
397096	397097	397095	397095	you	18038	" "
397107	397117	397095	397095	you	18038	" I interrupted his lordship , with a smile . "
397120	397125	397095	397095	you	18038	" says my lord , "
397201	397211	397197	397197	nobody	20980	" says my lord , with an arch smile , "
397220	397522	397213	397213	nobody	20980	" His lordship 's ill opinion having been removed by a better knowledge of me , our acquaintance daily grew more intimate ; and , especially between the ladies of his family and my own , a close friendship arose between them and my wife at least . Hal 's wife , received kindly at the little provincial court , as all ladies were , made herself by no means popular there by the hot and eager political tone which she adopted . She assailed all the Government measures with indiscriminating acrimony . Were they lenient ? She said the perfidious British Government was only preparing a snare , and biding its time until it could forge heavier chains for unhappy America . Were they angry ? Why did not every American citizen rise , assert his rights as a freeman , and serve every British governor , officer , soldier , as they had treated the East India Company 's tea ? My mother , on the other hand , was pleased to express her opinions with equal frankness , and , indeed , to press her advice upon his Excellency with a volubility which may have fatigued that representative of the Sovereign . Call out the militia ; send for fresh troops from New York , from home , from anywhere ; lock up the Capitol ! this advice was followed , it must be owned and send every one of the ringleaders amongst those wicked burgesses to prison ! was Madam Esmond 's daily counsel to the Governor by word and letter . And if not only the burgesses , but the burgesses ' wives could have been led off to punishment and captivity , I think this Brutus of a woman would scarce have appealed against the sentence .
397929	397933	397935	397936	Madam Esmond	683	" A ball ! "
397938	397969	397971	397971	she	683	" I go to a ball which is given by a set of rebels who are going publicly to insult his Majesty a week afterwards ! I will die sooner ! "

399812	399847	399848	399851	G. E. W. .	1961	" If you will have my opinion , my dear General , I think Sir George 's projected work , from the specimen I have of it , is certain to offend both parties . "
400086	400096	400098	400098	I	0	" If you , gentlemen are fighting for freedom , "
400109	400120	400098	400098	I	0	" On which Harry roars out , shaking his fist , "
400138	400320	400131	400131	they	18206	" And my mother agreed that this idea of a negro insurrection was the most abominable and parricidal notion which had ever sprung up in her unhappy country . She at least was more consistent than brother Hal . She would have black and white obedient to the powers that be : whereas Hal only could admit that freedom was the right of the latter colour . As a proof of her argument , Madam Esmond and Harry too would point to an instance in our own family in the person of Mr. Gumbo . Having got his freedom from me , as a reward for his admirable love and fidelity to me when times were hard , Gumbo , on his return to Virginia , was scarce a welcome guest in his old quarters , amongst my mother 's servants . He was free , and they were not : he was , as it were , a centre of insurrection . He gave himself no small airs of protection and consequence amongst them ; bragging of his friends in Europe "
400324	401126	400131	400131	they	18206	" as he called it , and his doings there ; and for a while bringing the household round about him to listen to him and admire him , like the monkey who had seen the world . Now , Sady , Hal 's boy , who went to America of his own desire , was not free . Hence jealousies between him and Mr. Gum ; and battles , in which they both practised the noble art of boxing and butting , which they had learned at Marybone Gardens and Hockley - in - the - Hole . Nor was Sady the only jealous person : almost all my mother 's servants hated Signor Gumbo for the airs which he gave himself ; and I am sorry to say , that our faithful Molly , his wife , was as jealous as his old fellow - servants . The blacks could not pardon her for having demeaned herself so far as to marry one of their kind . She met with no respect , could exercise no authority , came to her mistress with ceaseless complaints of the idleness , knavery , lies , stealing of the black people ; and finally with a story of jealousy against a certain Dinah , or Diana , who , I heartily trust , was as innocent as her namesake the moonlight visitant of Endymion . Now , on the article of morality Madam Esmond was a very Draconess ; and a person accused was a person guilty . She made charges against Mr. Gumbo to which he replied with asperity . Forgetting that he was a free gentleman , my mother now ordered Gumbo to be whipped , on which Molly flew at her ladyship , all her wrath at her husband 's infidelity vanishing at the idea of the indignity put upon him ; there was a rebellion in our house at Castlewood . A quarrel took place between me and my mother , as I took my man 's side . Hal and Fanny sided with her , on the contrary ; and in so far the difference did good , as it brought about some little intimacy between Madam and her younger children . This little difference was speedily healed ; but it was clear that the Standard of Insurrection must be removed out of our house ; and we determined that Mr. Gumbo and his lady should return to Europe . My wife and I would willingly have gone with them , God wot , for our boy sickened and lost his strength , and caught the fever in our swampy country ; but at this time she was expecting to lie in of our son Henry , and she knew , too , that I had promised to stay in Virginia . It was agreed that we should send the two back ; but when I offered Theo to go , she said her place was with her husband ; her father and Hetty at home would take care of our children ; and she scarce would allow me to see a tear in her eyes whilst she was making her preparations for the departure of her little ones . Dost thou remember the time , madam , and the silence round the worktables , as the piles of little shirts are made ready for the voyage ? and the stealthy visits to the children 's chambers whilst they are asleep and yet with you ? and the terrible time of parting , as our barge with the servants and children rows to the ship , and you stand on the shore ? Had the Prince of Wales been going on that voyage , he could not have been better provided . Where , sirrah , is the Tompion watch your grandmother gave you ? and how did you survive the boxes of cakes which the good lady stowed away in your cabin ? The ship which took out my poor Theo 's children , returned with the Reverend Mr. Hagan and my Lady Maria on board , who meekly chose to resign her rank , and was known in the colony which was not to be a colony very long only as Mrs. Hagan . At the time when I was in favour with my Lord Dunmore , a living falling vacant in Westmoreland county , he gave it to our kinsman , who arrived in Virginia time enough to christen our boy Henry , and to preach some sermons on the then gloomy state of affairs , which Madam Esmond pronounced to be prodigious fine . I think my Lady Maria won Madam 's heart by insisting on going out of the room after her . "
401141	401145	401134	401135	an earl	2240	" says she , "
401168	401387	401158	401158	I	0	" So fond did Madam become of her niece , that she even allowed Hagan to read plays my own humble compositions amongst others and was fairly forced to own that there was merit in the tragedy of Pocahontas , which our parson delivered with uncommon energy and fire . Hal and his wife came but rarely to Castlewood and Richmond when the chaplain and his lady were with us . Fanny was very curt and rude with Maria , used to giggle and laugh strangely in her company , and repeatedly remind her of her age , to our mother 's astonishment , who would often ask , was there any cause of quarrel between her niece and her daughter - in - law ? I kept my own counsel on these occasions , and was often not a little touched by the meekness with which the elder lady bore her persecutions . Fanny loved to torture her in her husband 's presence who , poor fellow , was also in happy ignorance about his wife 's early history , and the other bore her agony , wincing as little as might be . I sometimes would remonstrate with Madam Harry , and ask her was she a Red Indian , that she tortured her victims so ? "

I do n't wish , sir , I do n't like that your delicate wife and this dear little baby should be here , and only increase the risk of all of us ! We must have them away to Boston or New York . Do n't talk about defending me ! Who will think of hurting a poor , harmless , old woman ?

422659	422710	422712	422712	You	0	" ' Do as so many of the rest are doing , Mr. Warrington . Et tu , Brute , as the play says . Well , well , Harry ! I did not think it of you ; but , at least , you are in the fashion . ' "
422725	422754	422722	422722	I	0	" ' Ch , the promotion of the Marquis ? I recommended the appointment to Congress , no doubt ; and you and other gentlemen disapprove it . ' "
422767	422813	422766	422766	I.	0	" ' If you take me in that tone , Colonel Warrington , I have nothing to answer ! ' says the Chief , rising up very fiercely ; ' and presume that I can recommend officers for promotion without asking your previous sanction . ' "
422885	422952	422875	422875	I	0	" ' Great heavens , Harry ! ' he cries about this Marquis 's appointment he was beaten , that was the fact , and he could not reply to me , ' ca n't you believe that in this critical time of our affairs , there are reasons why special favours should be shown to the first Frenchman of distinction who comes amongst us ? ' "
422978	423369	423370	423370	He	19527	" ' I acknowledge or deny nothing , sir ! ' says the General , with a stamp of his foot , and looking as though he could be terribly angry if he would . ' Am I here to be catechised by you ? Stay . Hark , Harry ! I speak to you as a man of the world nay , as an old friend . This appointment humiliates you and others , you say ? Be it so ! Must we not bear humiliation , along with the other burthens and griefs , for the sake of our country ? It is no more just perhaps that the Marquis should be set over you gentlemen , than that your Prince Ferdinand or your Prince of Wales at home should have a command over veterans . But if in appointing this young nobleman we please a whole nation , and bring ourselves twenty millions of allies , will you and other gentlemen sulk because we do him honour ? ' Tis easy to sneer at him though , believe me , the Marquis has many more merits than you allow him ; to my mind it were more generous , as well as more polite , of Harry Warrington to welcome this stranger for the sake of the prodigious benefit our country may draw from him not to laugh at his peculiarities , but to aid him and help his ignorance by your experience as an old soldier : that is what I would do that is the part I expected of thee for it is the generous and manly one , Harry : but you choose to join my enemies , and when I am in trouble you say you will leave me . That is why I have been hurt : that is why I have been cold . I thought I might count on your friendship and and you can tell whether I was right or no . I relied on you as on a brother , and you come and tell me you will resign . Be it so ! Being embarked in this contest , by God 's will I will see it to an end . You are not the first , Mr. Warrington , has left me on the way . ' "
423436	423445	423429	423429	You	0	" says my brother , turning to me , "
423483	423484	423473	423473	He	19527	" "
423493	423497	423485	423485	I	0	" said I , "

423506	423516	423517	423517	We	19531	" says the parson , growling over his wine . "
423532	423575	423517	423517	We	19531	" Hal resumed ; ' she looked up quite kind , and saw we were friends . ' Is it all over , Colonel Harry ? ' she whispered . ' I know he has applied ever so often about your promotion ' "
423596	423605	423590	423590	I	0	" says Harry , telling me the story , "
423612	423621	423585	423585	I.	0	" Hal could imitate the Frenchman very well . "
423747	424157	423744	423745	this Marquis	29024	" After our little difference we became as great friends as before if a man may be said to be friends with a Sovereign Prince , for as such I somehow could not help regarding the General : and one night , when we had sate the company out , we talked of old times , and the jolly days of sport we had together both before and after Braddock 's ; and that pretty duel you were near having when we were boys . He laughed about it , and said he never saw a man look more wicked and more bent on killing than you did : ' And to do Sir George justice , I think he has hated me ever since , ' says the Chief . ' Ah ! ' he added , ' an open enemy I can face readily enough . ' Tis the secret foe who causes the doubt and anguish ! We have sat with more than one at my table to - day , to whom I am obliged to show a face of civility , whose hands I must take when they are offered , though I know they are stabbing my reputation , and are eager to pull me down from my place . You spoke but lately of being humiliated because a junior was set over you in command . What humiliation is yours compared to mine , who have to play the farce of welcome to these traitors ; who have to bear the neglect of Congress , and see men who have insulted me promoted in my own army ? If I consulted my own feelings as a man , would I continue in this command ? You know whether my temper is naturally warm or not , and whether as a private gentleman I should be likely to suffer such slights and outrages as are put upon me daily ; but in the advancement of the sacred cause in which we are engaged , we have to endure not only hardship and danger , but calumny and wrong , and may God give us strength to do our duty ! ' And then the General showed me the papers regarding the affair of that fellow Conway , whom Congress promoted in spite of the intrigue , and down whose black throat John Cadwalader sent the best ball he ever fired in his life . "
424163	424171	423744	423745	this Marquis	29024	" said Hal , concluding his story , "
424271	424272	424273	424273	We	19547	" "
424280	424283	424278	424278	Wolfe	1036	" said I. "

424384	424389	424390	424390	You	1588	" grumbles Parson Blake . "
424404	424409	424401	424402	Joe Blake	1769	" says Sir George . "
424429	424430	424401	424402	Joe Blake	1769	" "
424456	424461	424441	424448	that odious , swearing , crazy General Lee	19552	" cries Lady Warrington . "
424490	424511	424488	424488	Harry	1968	" Harry burst into a roar of laughter in which , of course , Mr. Miles must join his uncle . "
424514	424518	424488	424488	Harry	1968	" says he , "
424547	424548	424549	424549	He	3644	" "
424560	424569	424549	424549	He	3644	" says Theo , tossing up her head , "
424587	424956	424957	424957	You	19560	" And then Hal told how , his battles over , his country freed , his great work of liberation complete , the General laid down his victorious sword , and met his comrades of the army in a last adieu . The last British soldier had quitted the shore of the Republic , and the Commander - in - Chief proposed to leave New York for Annapolis , where Congress was sitting , and there resign his commission . About noon , on the 4th December , a barge was in waiting at Whitehall Ferry to convey him across the Hudson . The chiefs of the army assembled at a tavern near the ferry , and there the General joined them . Seldom as he showed his emotion , outwardly , on this day he could not disguise it . He filled a glass of wine , and said , ' I bid you farewell with a heart full of love and gratitude , and wish your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as those past have been glorious and honourable . ' Then he drank to them . ' I can not come to each of you to take my leave , ' he said , ' but shall be obliged if you will each come and shake me by the hand . ' General Knox , who was nearest , came forward , and the Chief , with tears in his eyes , embraced him . The others came , one by one , to him , and took their leave without a word . A line of infantry was formed from the tavern to the ferry , and the General , with his officers following him , walked silently to the water . He stood up in the barge , taking off his hat , and waving a farewell . And his comrades remained bareheaded on the shore till their leader 's boat was out of view . As Harry speaks very low , in the grey of evening , with sometimes a break in his voice , we all sit touched and silent . Hetty goes up and kisses her father . "
424966	424977	424963	424964	General Harry	2013	" she says , passing a handkerchief across her eyes , "
425002	425003	424999	425000	Colonel Warrington	1968	" "
425016	425026	425007	425007	he	2013	" whispers my wife , clinging to her sister , "
425035	425094	425095	425095	She	19564	" But it was not to be . My Lady Theo , and her husband too , I own , catching the infection from her , never would let Harry rest , until we had coaxed , wheedled , and ordered him to ask Hetty in marriage . He obeyed , and it was she who now declined . "
425099	425103	425095	425095	She	19564	" she said , "
425181	425185	425157	425157	Harry	1968	" adds Hester , "
425201	426077	425157	425157	Harry	1968	" She sent him her answer in writing , leaving home on a visit to friends at a distance , as though she would have him to understand that her decision was final . As such Hal received it . He did not break his heart . Cupid 's arrows , ladies , do n't bite very deep into the tough skins of gentlemen of our age ; though , to be sure , at the time of which I write , my brother was still a young man , being little more than fifty . Aunt Het is now a staid little lady with a voice of which years have touched the sweet chords , and a head which Time has powdered over with silver . There are days when she looks surprisingly young and blooming . Ah me , my dear , it seems but a little while since the hair was golden brown , and the cheeks as fresh as roses ! And then came the bitter blast of love unrequited which withered them ; and that long loneliness of heart which , they say , follows . Why should Theo and I have been so happy , and thou so lonely ? Why should my meal be garnished with love , and spread with plenty , while yon solitary outcast shivers at my gate ? I bow my head humbly before the Dispenser of pain and poverty , wealth and health ; I feel sometimes as if , for the prizes which have fallen to the lot of me unworthy , I did not dare to be grateful . But I hear the voices of my children in their garden , or look up at their mother from my book , or perhaps my sick - bed , and my heart fills with instinctive gratitude towards the bountiful Heaven that has so blest me . Since my accession to my uncle 's title and estate my intercourse with my good cousin Lord Castlewood had been very rare . I had always supposed him to be a follower of the winning side in politics , and was not a little astonished to hear of his sudden appearance in opposition . A disappointment in respect to a place at court , of which he pretended to have had some promise , was partly the occasion of his rupture with the Ministry . It is said that the most August Person in the realm had flatly refused to receive into the R - y - l Household a nobleman whose character was so notoriously bad , and whose example so the August Objector was pleased to say would ruin and corrupt any respectable family . I heard of the Castlewoods during our travels in Europe , and that the mania for play had again seized upon his lordship . His impaired fortunes having been retrieved by the prudence of his wife and father - in - law , he had again begun to dissipate his income at hombre and lansquenet . There were tales of malpractices in which he had been discovered , and even of chastisement inflicted upon him by the victims of his unscrupulous arts . His wife 's beauty and freshness faded early ; we met but once at Aix - la - Chapelle , where Lady Castlewood besought my wife to go and see her , and afflicted Lady Warrington 's kind heart by stories of the neglect and outrage of which her unfortunate husband was guilty . We were willing to receive these as some excuse and palliation for the unhappy lady 's own conduct . A notorious adventurer , gambler , and spadassin , calling himself the Chevalier de Barry , and said to be a relative of the mistress of the French King , but afterwards turning out to be an Irishman of low extraction , was in constant attendance upon the Earl and Countess at this time , and conspicuous for the audacity of his lies , the extravagance of his play , and somewhat mercenary gallantry towards the other sex , and a ferocious bravo courage , which , however , failed him on one or two awkward occasions , if common report said true . He subsequently married , and rendered miserable a lady of title and fortune in England . The poor little American lady 's interested union with Lord Castlewood was scarcely more happy . I remember our little Miles 's infantile envy being excited by learning that Lord Castlewood 's second son , a child a few months younger than himself , was already an ensign on the Irish establishment , whose pay the fond parents regularly drew . This piece of preferment my lord must have got for his cadet whilst he was on good terms with the Minister , during which period of favour Will Esmond was also shifted off to New York . Whilst I was in America myself , we read in an English journal that Captain Charles Esmond had resigned his commission in his Majesty 's service , as not wishing to take up arms against the countrymen of his mother , the Countess of Castlewood . "
426091	426096	426097	426097	he	1657	" Madam Esmond said ; "
426111	426248	426249	426251	Jack the Painter	2031	" I may mention , with respect to this old worthy , that he continued to reside in England for a while after the Declaration of Independence , not at all denying his sympathy with the American cause , but keeping a pretty quiet tongue , and alleging that such a very old man as himself was past the age of action or mischief , in which opinion the Government concurred , no doubt , as he was left quite unmolested . But of a sudden a warrant was out after him , when it was surprising with what agility he stirred himself , and skipped off to France , whence he presently embarked upon his return to Virginia . The old man bore the worst reputation amongst the Loyalists of our colony ; and was nicknamed "
426252	426489	426249	426251	Jack the Painter	2031	" amongst them , much to his indignation , after a certain miscreant who was hung in England for burning naval stores in our ports there . He professed to have lost prodigious sums at home by the persecution of the Government , distinguished himself by the loudest patriotism and the most violent religious outcries in Virginia ; where , nevertheless , he was not much more liked by the Whigs than by the party who still remained faithful to the Crown . He wondered that such an old Tory as Madam Esmond of Castlewood was suffered to go at large , and was for ever crying out against her amongst the gentlemen of the new Assembly , the Governor , and officers of the State . He and Fanny had high words in Richmond one day , when she told him he was an old swindler and traitor , and that the mother of Colonel Henry Warrington , the bosom friend of his Excellency the Commander - in - Chief , was not to be insulted by such a little smuggling slave - driver as him ! I think it was in the year 1780 an accident happened , when the old Register Office at Williamsburg was burned down , in which there was a copy of the formal assignment of the Virginia property from Francis Lord Castlewood to my grandfather Henry Esmond , Esquire . "
426492	426496	426249	426251	Jack the Painter	2031	" says Fanny , "
426508	426665	426666	426668	Tom the Glazier	2033	" And Mr. Van den Bosch was for prosecuting her for libel , but that Fanny took to her bed at this juncture , and died . Van den Bosch made contracts with the new Government , and sold them bargains , as the phrase is . He supplied horses , meat , forage , all of bad quality ; but when Arnold came into Virginia in the King 's service and burned right and left , Van den Bosch 's stores and tobacco - houses somehow were spared . Some secret Whigs now took their revenge on the old rascal . A couple of his ships in James River , his stores , and a quantity of his cattle in their stalls were roasted amidst a hideous bellowing ; and he got a note , as he was in Arnold 's company , saying that friends had served him as he served others ; and containing "
426677	426812	426666	426668	Tom the Glazier	2033	" Nobody pitied the old man , though he went well - nigh mad at his loss . In Arnold 's suite came the Honourable Captain William Esmond , of the New York Loyalists , as aide - de - camp to the General . When Howe occupied Philadelphia , Will was said to have made some money keeping a gambling - house with an officer of the dragoons of Anspach . I know not how he lost it . He could not have had much when he consented to become an aide - de - camp of Arnold . Now , the King 's officers having reappeared in the province , Madam Esmond thought fit to open her house at Castlewood and invite them thither and actually received Mr. Arnold and his suite . "
426819	426823	426666	426668	Tom the Glazier	2033	" she said , "
426839	426975	426976	426977	The Esmonds	1829	" And she threw her house open to him , and treated him with great though frigid respect whilst he remained in the district . The General gone , and , his precious aide - de - camp with him , some of the rascals who followed in their suite remained behind in the house where they had received so much hospitality , insulted the old lady in her hall , insulted her people , and finally set fire to the old mansion in a frolic of drunken fury . Our house at Richmond was not burned , luckily , though Mr. Arnold had fired the town ; and thither the undaunted old lady proceeded , surrounded by her people , and never swerving in her loyalty , in spite of her ill - usage . "
426979	426983	426976	426977	The Esmonds	1829	" she said , "
426990	427326	426976	426977	The Esmonds	1829	" And now Mr. Van den Bosch , in the name of his grandson and my Lord Castlewood , in England , set up a claim to our property in Virginia . He said it was not my lord 's intention to disturb Madam Esmond in her enjoyment of the estate during her life , but that his father , it had always been understood , had given his kinsman a life - interest in the place , and only continued it to his daughter out of generosity . Now my lord proposed that his second son should inhabit Virginia , for which the young gentleman had always shown the warmest sympathy . The outcry against Van den Bosch was so great that he would have been tarred and feathered , had he remained in Virginia . He betook himself to Congress , represented himself as a martyr ruined in the cause of liberty , and prayed for compensation for himself and justice for his grandson . My mother lived long in dreadful apprehension , having in truth a secret , which she did not like to disclose to any one . Her titles were burned ! the deed of assignment in her own house , the copy in the Registry at Richmond , had alike been destroyed by chance ? by villainy ? who could say ? She did not like to confide this trouble in writing to me . She opened herself to Hal , after the surrender of York Town , and he acquainted me with the fact in a letter by a British officer returning home on his parole . Then I remembered the unlucky words I had let slip before Will Esmond at the coffee - house at New York ; and a part of this iniquitous scheme broke upon me . As for Mr. Will : there is a tablet in Castlewood Church , in Hampshire , inscribed , Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori , and announcing that "
427360	427698	427332	427334	a mourning brother	19575	" But how ? When , towards the end of 1781 , a revolt took place in the Philadelphia Line of the Congress Army , and Sir Henry Clinton sent out agents to the mutineers , what became of them ? The men took the spies prisoners , and proceeded to judge them , and my brother whom they knew and loved , and had often followed under fire , who had been sent from camp to make terms with the troops , recognised one of the spies , just as execution was about to be done upon him and the wretch , with horrid outcries , grovelling and kneeling at Colonel Warrington 's feet , besought him for mercy , and promised to confess all to him . To confess what ? Harry turned away sick at heart . Will 's mother and sister never knew the truth . They always fancied it was in action he was killed . As for my lord earl , whose noble son has been the intendant of an illustrious Prince , and who has enriched himself at play with his R -l master : I went to see his lordship when I heard of this astounding design against our property , and remonstrated with him on the matter . For myself , as I showed him , I was not concerned , as I had determined to cede my right to my brother . He received me with perfect courtesy ; smiled when I spoke of my disinterestedness ; said he was sure of my affectionate feelings towards my brother , but what must be his towards his son ? He had always heard from his father : he would take his Bible oath of that : that , at my mother 's death , the property would return to the head of the family . At the story of the title which Colonel Esmond had ceded , he shrugged his shoulders , and treated it as a fable . "
427708	427716	427332	427334	a mourning brother	19575	" says he , offering me snuff , "
427771	427804	427805	427805	My	0	" Oh , if my mother had but heard him ! I might have been disposed to take a high tone : but he said , with the utmost good - nature , "
427846	428071	427833	427833	We	19586	" and his lordship named a sum greater than the actual value of the estate . Amazed at the coolness of this worthy , I walked away to my coffee - house , where , as it happened , an old friend was to dine with me , for whom I have a sincere regard . I had felt a pang at not being able to give this gentleman my living of Warrington on - Waveney , but I could not , as he himself confessed honestly . His life had been too loose , and his example in my village could never have been edifying : besides , he would have died of ennui there , after being accustomed to a town life ; and he had a prospect finally , he told me , of settling himself most comfortably in London and the church . He was the second Incumbent of Lady Whittlesea 's Chapel , Mayfair , and married Elizabeth , relict of Hermann Voelcker , Esq . , the eminent brewer . My guest , I need not say , was my old friend Sampson , who never failed to dine with me when I came to town , and I told him of my interview with his old patron . I could not have lighted upon a better confidant . "
428075	428079	428080	428081	the man	2270	" says Sampson , "
428240	428463	428464	428464	Victoria	1130	" His eyes filled with tears . He was an altered man . At a certain period of the port wine Sampson always alluded with compunction to his past life , and the change which had taken place in his conduct since the awful death of his friend Doctor Dodd . Quick as we were , we did not arrive at Castlewood too soon . I was looking at the fountain in the court , and listening to that sweet sad music of its plashing , which my grandfather tells of in his memoires , and peopling the place with bygone figures , with Beatrix in her beauty ; with my Lord Francis in scarlet , calling to his dogs and mounting his grey horse ; with the young page of old who won the castle and the heiress when Sampson comes running down to me with an old volume in rough calf - bound in his hand , containing drafts of letters , copies of agreements , and various writings , some by a secretary of my Lord Francis , some in the slim handwriting of his wife my grandmother , some bearing the signature of the last lord ; and here was a copy of the assignment sure enough , as it had been sent to my grandfather in Virginia . "
428468	428479	428466	428466	Victoria	1130	" cries Sampson , shaking my hand , embracing everybody . "
428504	428554	428489	428489	We	19604	" As we were talking , the wheels of postchaises were heard , and a couple of carriages drove into the court containing my lord and a friend , and their servants in the next vehicle . His lordship looked only a little paler than usual at seeing me . "
428579	428647	428648	428648	I	0	" says my lord . I think he had forgotten the existence of this book , or had never seen it ; and when he offered to take his Bible oath of what he had heard from his father , had simply volunteered a perjury . I was shaking hands with his companion , a nobleman with whom I had had the honour to serve in America . "
428651	428655	428648	428648	I	0	" I said , "

428785	428792	428768	428768	I	0	" I said with a bow . "
428805	428810	428840	428840	Connu	2036	" bawled my lord . "
428830	428831	428827	428828	Lord Rawdon	2027	" "
428870	428888	428889	428889	My	0	" I never had heard this absurd nickname before , and did not care to notice it . "
428893	428897	428891	428891	Castlewood	2032	" I said , "
428916	428928	428912	428912	his	2032	" Castlewood gave a kind of gasp , and then said , "
429019	429031	429012	429012	I	0	" and he held out his hand with the blandest smile . "
429053	429064	429035	429035	you	1588	" says Sampson , with a leer on his face . "
429077	429082	429083	429083	I	0	" says my lord . "
429136	429137	429138	429139	My lord	2193	" "
429141	429152	429138	429139	My lord	2193	" said I , buttoning the book under my coat , "

429247	429399	429233	429233	Sampson	1022	" And I turned on my heel , making a bow to Lord R , and from that day to this I have never set my foot within the halls of my ancestors . Shall I ever see the old mother again , I wonder ? She lives in Richmond , never having rebuilt her house in the country . When Hal was in England , we sent her pictures of both her sons , painted by the admirable Sir Joshua Reynolds . We sate to him , the last year Mr. Johnson was alive , I remember . And the Doctor , peering about the studio , and seeing the image of Hal in his uniform the appearance of it caused no little excitement in those days , asked who was this ? and was informed that it was the famous American General General Warrington , Sir George 's brother .
