3845	3873	3829	3831	Sir Henry Curtis	97	" the year before last about this time , you were , I believe , at a place called Bamangwato , to the north of the Transvaal . "
3874	3878	3879	3879	I	0	" I was , "
3912	3922	3929	3929	his	98	" You were trading there , were you not ? "
3933	3962	3929	3929	his	98	" I was . I took up a wagon - load of goods , made a camp outside the settlement , and stopped till I had sold them . "
4008	4020	3929	3929	his	98	" Did you happen to meet a man called Neville there ? "
4021	4081	3929	3929	his	98	" Oh , yes ; he outspanned alongside of me for a fortnight to rest his oxen before going on to the interior . I had a letter from a lawyer a few months back , asking me if I knew what had become of him , which I answered to the best of my ability at the time . "
4082	4085	4087	4088	Sir Henry	97	" Yes , "
4090	4231	4087	4088	Sir Henry	97	" your letter was forwarded to me . You said in it that the gentleman called Neville left Bamangwato at the beginning of May in a wagon with a driver , a voorlooper , and a Kafir hunter called Jim , announcing his intention of trekking if possible as far as Inyati , the extreme trading post in the Matabele country , where he would sell his wagon and proceed on foot . You also said that he did sell his wagon , for six months afterwards you saw the wagon in the possession of a Portuguese trader , who told you that he had bought it at Inyati from a white man whose name he had forgotten , and that he believed the white man with the native servant had started off for the interior on a shooting trip . "
4232	4235	4322	4323	Captain Good	98	" Yes . "
4241	4245	4247	4248	Sir Henry	97	" Mr. Quatermain , "
4251	4286	4247	4248	Sir Henry	97	" I suppose you know or can guess nothing more of the reasons of my - of Mr. Neville 's journey to the northward , or as to what point that journey was directed ? "
4287	4292	4293	4293	I	0	" I heard something , "
4326	4330	4333	4334	the former	374	" Mr. Quatermain , "
4336	4377	4378	4378	he	374	" I am going to tell you a story , and ask your advice , and perhaps your assistance . The agent who forwarded me your letter told me that I might rely on it implicitly , as you were , "
4381	4397	4378	4378	he	374	" well known and universally respected in Natal , and especially noted for your discretion . "
4424	4431	4419	4420	Sir Henry	97	" Mr. Neville was my brother . "
4432	4435	4436	4436	I	0	" Oh , "
4504	4508	4511	4512	Sir Henry	97	" He was , "
4514	4574	4511	4512	Sir Henry	97	" my only and younger brother , and till five years ago I do not suppose that we were ever a month away from each other . But just about five years ago a misfortune befell us , as sometimes does happen in families . We quarrelled bitterly , and I behaved unjustly to my brother in my anger . "
4641	4648	4651	4652	Sir Henry	97	" As I daresay you know , "
4654	4829	4651	4652	Sir Henry	97	" if a man dies intestate , and has no property but land , real property it is called in England , it all descends to his eldest son . It so happened that just at the time when we quarrelled our father died intestate . He had put off making his will until it was too late . The result was that my brother , who had not been brought up to any profession , was left without a penny . Of course it would have been my duty to provide for him , but at the time the quarrel between us was so bitter that I did not - to my shame I say it and he sighed deeply - offer to do anything . It was not that I grudged him justice , but I waited for him to make advances , and he made none . I am sorry to trouble you with all this , Mr. Quatermain , but I must to make things clear , eh , Good ? "
4830	4837	4839	4840	the captain	355	" Quite so , quite so , "
4842	4857	4839	4840	the captain	355	" Mr. Quatermain will , I am sure , keep this history to himself . "
4858	4862	4864	4864	I	0	" Of course , "
4889	4892	4895	4896	Sir Henry	97	" Well , "
4898	5007	4895	4896	Sir Henry	97	" my brother had a few hundred pounds to his account at the time . Without saying anything to me he drew out this paltry sum , and , having adopted the name of Neville , started off for South Africa in the wild hope of making a fortune . This I learned afterwards . Some three years passed , and I heard nothing of my brother , though I wrote several times . Doubtless the letters never reached him . But as time went on I grew more and more troubled about him . I found out , Mr. Quatermain , that blood is thicker than water . "
5008	5013	5015	5015	I	0	" That 's true , "
5023	5065	4895	4896	Sir Henry	97	" I found out , Mr. Quatermain , that I would have given half my fortune to know that my brother George , the only relation I possess , was safe and well , and that I should see him again . "
5066	5074	5077	5078	Captain Good	98	" But you never did , Curtis , "
5088	5201	4895	4896	Sir Henry	97	" Well , Mr. Quatermain , as time went on I became more and more anxious to find out if my brother was alive or dead , and if alive to get him home again . I set enquiries on foot , and your letter was one of the results . So far as it went it was satisfactory , for it showed that till lately George was alive , but it did not go far enough . So , to cut a long story short , I made up my mind to come out and look for him myself , and Captain Good was so kind as to come with me . "
5202	5205	5207	5208	the captain	355	" Yes , "
5210	5255	5207	5208	the captain	355	" nothing else to do , you see . Turned out by my Lords of the Admiralty to starve on half pay . And now perhaps , sir , you will tell us what you know or have heard of the gentleman called Neville . "
5300	5315	5317	5318	Sir Henry	97	" What was it that you heard about my brother 's journey at Bamangwato ? "
5333	5338	5339	5339	I	0	" I heard this , "
5342	5368	5339	5339	I	0	" and I have never mentioned it to a soul till to - day . I heard that he was starting for Solomon 's Mines . "
5369	5374	5377	5378	my hearers	386	" Solomon 's Mines ? "
5382	5387	5377	5378	my hearers	386	" Where are they ? "
5388	5394	5395	5395	I	0	" I do n't know , "
5398	5502	5395	5395	I	0	" I know where they are said to be . Once I saw the peaks of the mountains that border them , but there were a hundred and thirty miles of desert between me and them , and I am not aware that any white man ever got across it save one . But perhaps the best thing I can do is to tell you the legend of Solomon 's Mines as I know it , you passing your word not to reveal anything I tell you without my permission . Do you agree to that ? I have my reasons for asking . "
5512	5517	5508	5509	Captain Good	98	" Certainly , certainly . "
5518	5521	5522	5522	I	0	" Well , "
5525	5804	5522	5522	I	0	" as you may guess , generally speaking , elephant hunters are a rough set of men , who do not trouble themselves with much beyond the facts of life and the ways of Kafirs . But here and there you meet a man who takes the trouble to collect traditions from the natives , and tries to make out a little piece of the history of this dark land . It was such a man as this who first told me the legend of Solomon 's Mines , now a matter of nearly thirty years ago . That was when I was on my first elephant hunt in the Matabele country . His name was Evans , and he was killed the following year , poor fellow , by a wounded buffalo , and lies buried near the Zambesi Falls . I was telling Evans one night , I remember , of some wonderful workings I had found whilst hunting koodoo and eland in what is now the Lydenburg district of the Transvaal . I see they have come across these workings again lately in prospecting for gold , but I knew of them years ago . There is a great wide wagon road cut out of the solid rock , and leading to the mouth of the working or gallery . Inside the mouth of this gallery are stacks of gold quartz piled up ready for roasting , which shows that the workers , whoever they were , must have left in a hurry . Also , about twenty paces in , the gallery is built across , and a beautiful bit of masonry it is . "
5805	6002	5508	5509	Captain Good	98	" ' Ay , ' said Evans , ' but I will spin you a queerer yarn than that ' ; and he went on to tell me how he had found in the far interior a ruined city , which he believed to be the Ophir of the Bible , and , by the way , other more learned men have said the same long since poor Evans 's time . I was , I remember , listening open - eared to all these wonders , for I was young at the time , and this story of an ancient civilisation and of the treasures which those old Jewish or Phoenician adventurers used to extract from a country long since lapsed into the darkest barbarism took a great hold upon my imagination , when suddenly he said to me , ' Lad , did you ever hear of the Suliman Mountains up to the north - west of the Mushakulumbwe country ? ' I told him I never had . ' Ah , well , ' he said , ' that is where Solomon really had his mines , his diamond mines , I mean . '
6003	6014	5522	5522	I	0	" ' How do you know that ? ' I asked .
6015	6024	5508	5509	Captain Good	98	" ' Know it ! why , what is "
6026	6065	5522	5522	I	0	" but a corruption of Solomon ? 1 Besides , an old Isanusi or witch doctoress up in the Manica country told me all about it . She said that the people who lived across those mountains were a "
6067	6102	5522	5522	I	0	" of the Zulus , speaking a dialect of Zulu , but finer and bigger men even ; that there lived among them great wizards , who had learnt their art from white men when "
6109	6120	5508	5509	Captain Good	98	" and who had the secret of a wonderful mine of "
6124	6125	5508	5509	Captain Good	98	" '
6126	6455	5522	5522	I	0	" Well , I laughed at this story at the time , though it interested me , for the Diamond Fields were not discovered then , but poor Evans went off and was killed , and for twenty years I never thought any more of the matter . However , just twenty years afterwards - and that is a long time , gentlemen ; an elephant hunter does not often live for twenty years at his business - I heard something more definite about Suliman 's Mountains and the country which lies beyond them . I was up beyond the Manica country , at a place called Sitanda 's Kraal , and a miserable place it was , for a man could get nothing to eat , and there was but little game about . I had an attack of fever , and was in a bad way generally , when one day a Portugee arrived with a single companion - a half - breed . Now I know your low - class Delagoa Portugee well . There is no greater devil unhung in a general way , battening as he does upon human agony and flesh in the shape of slaves . But this was quite a different type of man to the mean fellows whom I had been accustomed to meet ; indeed , in appearance he reminded me more of the polite doms I have read about , for he was tall and thin , with large dark eyes and curling grey mustachios . We talked together for a while , for he could speak broken English , and I understood a little Portugee , and he told me that his name was José Silvestre , and that he had a place near Delagoa Bay . When he went on next day with his half - breed companion , he said ' Good - bye , ' taking off his hat quite in the old style .
6456	6533	5508	5509	Captain Good	98	" ' Good - bye , senor , ' he said ; ' if ever we meet again I shall be the richest man in the world , and I will remember you . ' I laughed a little - I was too weak to laugh much - and watched him strike out for the great desert to the west , wondering if he was mad , or what he thought he was going to find there .
6534	6705	5522	5522	I	0	" A week passed , and I got the better of my fever . One evening I was sitting on the ground in front of the little tent I had with me , chewing the last leg of a miserable fowl I had bought from a native for a bit of cloth worth twenty fowls , and staring at the hot red sun sinking down over the desert , when suddenly I saw a figure , apparently that of a European , for it wore a coat , on the slope of the rising ground opposite to me , about three hundred yards away . The figure crept along on its hands and knees , then it got up and staggered forward a few yards on its legs , only to fall and crawl again . Seeing that it must be somebody in distress , I sent one of my hunters to help him , and presently he arrived , and who do you suppose it turned out to be ? "
6706	6713	6715	6716	Captain Good	98	" José Silvestre , of course , "
6718	6782	5522	5522	I	0	" Yes , José Silvestre , or rather his skeleton and a little skin . His face was a bright yellow with bilious fever , and his large dark eyes stood nearly out of his head , for all the flesh had gone . There was nothing but yellow parchment - like skin , white hair , and the gaunt bones sticking up beneath .
6783	6820	5522	5522	I	0	" ' Water ! for the sake of Christ , water ! ' he moaned and I saw that his lips were cracked , and his tongue , which protruded between them , was swollen and blackish .
6821	6998	5522	5522	I	0	" I gave him water with a little milk in it , and he drank it in great gulps , two quarts or so , without stopping . I would not let him have any more . Then the fever took him again , and he fell down and began to rave about Suliman 's Mountains , and the diamonds , and the desert . I carried him into the tent and did what I could for him , which was little enough ; but I saw how it must end . About eleven o'clock he grew quieter , and I lay down for a little rest and went to sleep . At dawn I woke again , and in the half light saw Silvestre sitting up , a strange , gaunt form , and gazing out towards the desert . Presently the first ray of the sun shot right across the wide plain before us till it reached the faraway crest of one of the tallest of the Suliman Mountains more than a hundred miles away .
6999	7039	5522	5522	I	0	" ' There it is ! ' cried the dying man in Portuguese , and pointing with his long , thin arm , ' but I shall never reach it , never . No one will ever reach it ! '
7040	7074	5522	5522	I	0	" Suddenly , he paused , and seemed to take a resolution . ' Friend , ' he said , turning towards me , ' are you there ? My eyes grow dark . '
7075	7093	5522	5522	I	0	" ' Yes , ' I said ; ' yes , lie down now , and rest . '
7094	7160	5522	5522	I	0	" ' Ay , ' he answered , ' I shall rest soon , I have time to rest - all eternity . Listen , I am dying ! You have been good to me . I will give you the writing . Perhaps you will get there if you can live to pass the desert , which has killed my poor servant and me . '
7161	7262	5522	5522	I	0	" Then he groped in his shirt and brought out what I thought was a Boer tobacco pouch made of the skin of the Swart - vet - pens or sable antelope . It was fastened with a little strip of hide , what we call a rimpi , and this he tried to loose , but could not . He handed it to me . ' Untie it , ' he said . I did so , and extracted a bit of torn yellow linen on which something was written in rusty letters . Inside this rag was a paper .
7263	7442	5522	5522	I	0	" Then he went on feebly , for he was growing weak : ' The paper has all that is on the linen . It took me years to read . Listen : my ancestor , a political refugee from Lisbon , and one of the first Portuguese who landed on these shores , wrote that when he was dying on those mountains which no white foot ever pressed before or since . His name was José da Silvestra , and he lived three hundred years ago . His slave , who waited for him on this side of the mountains , found him dead , and brought the writing home to Delagoa . It has been in the family ever since , but none have cared to read it , till at last I did . And I have lost my life over it , but another may succeed , and become the richest man in the world - the richest man in the world . Only give it to no one , senor ; go yourself ! '
7443	7459	5522	5522	I	0	" Then he began to wander again , and in an hour it was all over .
7460	7503	5522	5522	I	0	" God rest him ! he died very quietly , and I buried him deep , with big boulders on his breast ; so I do not think that the jackals can have dug him up . And then I came away . "
7504	7511	7513	7514	Sir Henry	97	" Ay , but the document ? "
7523	7534	7536	7537	the captain	355	" Yes , the document ; what was in it ? "
7539	7633	5522	5522	I	0	" Well , gentlemen , if you like I will tell you . I have never showed it to anybody yet except to a drunken old Portuguese trader who translated it for me , and had forgotten all about it by the next morning . The original rag is at my home in Durban , together with poor Dom José 's translation , but I have the English rendering in my pocket - book , and a facsimile of the map , if it can be called a map . Here it is . "
7637	7881	5522	5522	I	0	" I , José da Silvestra , who am now dying of hunger in the little cave where no snow is on the north side of the nipple of the southernmost of the two mountains I have named Sheba 's Breasts , write this in the year 1590 with a cleft bone upon a remnant of my raiment , my blood being the ink . If my slave should find it when he comes , and should bring it to Delagoa , let my friend name illegible bring the matter to the knowledge of the king , that he may send an army which , if they live through the desert and the mountains , and can overcome the brave Kukuanes and their devilish arts , to which end many priests should be brought , will make him the richest king since Solomon . With my own eyes I have seen the countless diamonds stored in Solomon 's treasure chamber behind the white Death ; but through the treachery of Gagool the witch - finder I might bring nought away , scarcely my life . Let him who comes follow the map , and climb the snow of Sheba 's left breast till he reaches the nipple , on the north side of which is the great road Solomon made , from whence three days ' journey to the King 's Palace . Let him kill Gagool . Pray for my soul . Farewell .

7926	7929	7931	7932	Captain Good	98	" Well , "
7934	7983	7931	7932	Captain Good	98	" I have been round the world twice , and put in at most ports , but may I be hung for a mutineer if ever I heard a yarn like this out of a story book , or in it either , for the matter of that . "
7984	7994	7996	7997	Sir Henry	97	" It 's a queer tale , Mr. Quatermain , "
7999	8023	7996	7997	Sir Henry	97	" I suppose you are not hoaxing us ? It is , I know , sometimes thought allowable to take in a greenhorn . "
8024	8033	8034	8034	I	0	" If you think that , Sir Henry , "
8083	8099	8101	8101	I	0	" if you think that , why , there is an end to the matter , "
8116	8123	8124	8124	he	97	" Sit down , Mr. Quatermain , "
8127	8158	8124	8124	he	97	" I beg your pardon ; I see very well you do not wish to deceive us , but the story sounded so strange that I could hardly believe it . "
8159	8173	8174	8174	I	0	" You shall see the original map and writing when we reach Durban , "
8201	8204	8205	8205	I	0	" But , "
8209	8271	8205	8205	I	0	" I have not told you about your brother . I knew the man Jim who was with him . He was a Bechuana by birth , a good hunter , and for a native a very clever man . That morning on which Mr. Neville was starting I saw Jim standing by my wagon and cutting up tobacco on the disselboom .
8272	8293	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Jim , ' said I , ' where are you off to this trip ? It is elephants ? '
8294	8315	8205	8205	I	0	" ' No , Baas , ' he answered , ' we are after something worth much more than ivory . '
8316	8338	8205	8205	I	0	" ' And what might that be ? ' I said , for I was curious . ' Is it gold ? '
8339	8355	8205	8205	I	0	" ' No , Baas , something worth more than gold , ' and he grinned .
8356	8387	8205	8205	I	0	" I asked no more questions , for I did not like to lower my dignity by seeming inquisitive , but I was puzzled . Presently Jim finished cutting his tobacco .
8388	8395	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Baas , ' said he .
8396	8401	8205	8205	I	0	" I took no notice .
8402	8410	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Baas , ' said he again .
8411	8424	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Eh , boy , what is it ? ' I asked .
8425	8435	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Baas , we are going after diamonds . '
8436	8459	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Diamonds ! why , then , you are steering in the wrong direction ; you should head for the Fields . '
8460	8484	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Baas , have you ever heard of Suliman 's Berg ? ' - that is , Solomon 's Mountains , Sir Henry .
8485	8489	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Ay ! '
8490	8501	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Have you ever heard of the diamonds there ? '
8502	8513	8205	8205	I	0	" ' I have heard a foolish story , Jim . '
8514	8550	8205	8205	I	0	" ' It is no story , Baas . Once I knew a woman who came from there , and reached Natal with her child , she told me : - she is dead now . '
8551	8558	8205	8205	I	0	" ' Your master will feed the assv"gels
8597	8630	8596	8596	I.	395	" He grinned . ' Mayhap , Baas . Man must die ; I 'd rather like to try a new country myself ; the elephants are getting worked out about here . '

8674	8735	8205	8205	I	0	" Half an hour after that I saw Neville 's wagon move off . Presently Jim came back running . ' Good - bye , Baas , ' he said . ' I did n't like to start without bidding you good - bye , for I daresay you are right , and that we shall never trek south again . '
8736	8755	8596	8596	I.	395	" ' Is your master really going to Suliman 's Berg , Jim , or are you lying ? '
8756	8797	8205	8205	I	0	" ' No , ' he answered , ' he is going . He told me he was bound to make his fortune somehow , or try to ; so he might as well have a fling for the diamonds . '
8798	8844	8596	8596	I.	395	" ' Oh ! ' I said ; ' wait a bit , Jim ; will you take a note to your master , Jim , and promise not to give it to him till you reach Inyati ? ' which was some hundred miles off .

You are not to give it to him now , because I do n't want him back asking me questions which I wo n't answer . Now be off , you idle fellow , the wagon is nearly out of sight . '

9013	9060	9010	9011	Sir Henry	97	" I am going to look for my brother ; I am going to trace him to Suliman 's Mountains , and over them if necessary , till I find him , or until I know that he is dead . Will you come with me ? "
9127	9143	9144	9144	I	0	" No , thank you , Sir Henry , I think I had rather not , "
9147	9192	9144	9144	I	0	" I am too old for wild - goose chases of that sort , and we should only end up like my poor friend Silvestre . I have a son dependent on me , so I can not afford to risk my life foolishly . "

You may put the remuneration for your services at whatever figure you like in reason , and it shall be paid over to you before we start . Moreover , I will arrange in the event of anything untoward happening to us or to you , that your son shall be suitably provided for . You will see from this offer how necessary I think your presence . Also if by chance we should reach this place , and find diamonds , they shall belong to you and Good equally . I do not want them . But of course that promise is worth nothing at all , though the same thing would apply to any ivory we might get . You may pretty well make your own terms with me , Mr. Quatermain ; and of course I shall pay all expenses . "

10846	10851	10852	10852	I	0	" Yes , gentlemen , "
10859	10886	10852	10852	I	0	" I will go , and by your leave I will tell you why , and on what conditions . First for the terms which I ask .
10887	10915	10852	10852	I	0	" 1 . You are to pay all expenses , and any ivory or other valuables we may get is to be divided between Captain Good and myself .
10916	10957	10852	10852	I	0	" 2 . That you give me 500 for my services on the trip before we start , I undertaking to serve you faithfully till you choose to abandon the enterprise , or till we succeed , or disaster overtakes us .
10958	11048	10852	10852	I	0	" 3 . That before we trek you execute a deed agreeing , in the event of my death or disablement , to pay my boy Harry , who is studying medicine over there in London , at Guy 's Hospital , a sum of 200 a year for five years , by which time he ought to be able to earn a living for himself if he is worth his salt . That is all , I think , and I daresay you will say quite enough too . "
11049	11052	11054	11055	Sir Henry	97	" No , "
11057	11090	11054	11055	Sir Henry	97	" I accept them gladly . I am bent upon this project , and would pay more than that for your help , considering the peculiar and exclusive knowledge which you possess . "
11091	11199	10852	10852	I	0	" Pity I did not ask it , then , but I wo n't go back on my word . And now that I have got my terms I will tell you my reasons for making up my mind to go . First of all , gentlemen , I have been observing you both for the last few days , and if you will not think me impertinent I may say that I like you , and believe that we shall come up well to the yoke together . That is something , let me tell you , when one has a long journey like this before one .
11200	11300	11054	11055	Sir Henry	97	" And now as to the journey itself , I tell you flatly , Sir Henry and Captain Good , that I do not think it probable we can come out of it alive , that is , if we attempt to cross the Suliman Mountains . What was the fate of the old Dom da Silvestra three hundred years ago ? What was the fate of his descendant twenty years ago ? What has been your brother 's fate ? I tell you frankly , gentlemen , that as their fates were so I believe ours will be . "
11327	11334	11335	11335	he	97	" We must take our chance , "
11338	11344	11345	11345	I	0	" You may perhaps wonder , "
11349	11610	11345	11345	I	0	" why , if I think this , I , who am , as I told you , a timid man , should undertake such a journey . It is for two reasons . First I am a fatalist , and believe that my time is appointed to come quite without reference to my own movements and will , and that if I am to go to Suliman 's Mountains to be killed , I shall go there and shall be killed . God Almighty , no doubt , knows His mind about me , so I need not trouble on that point . Secondly , I am a poor man . For nearly forty years I have hunted and traded , but I have never made more than a living . Well , gentlemen , I do n't know if you are aware that the average life of an elephant hunter from the time he takes to the trade is between four and five years . So you see I have lived through about seven generations of my class , and I should think that my time can not be far off , anyway . Now , if anything were to happen to me in the ordinary course of business , by the time my debts are paid there would be nothing left to support my son Harry whilst he was getting in the way of earning a living , whereas now he will be set up for five years . There is the whole affair in a nutshell . "
11611	11615	11617	11618	Sir Henry	97	" Mr. Quatermain , "
11630	11733	11617	11618	Sir Henry	97	" your motives for undertaking an enterprise which you believe can only end in disaster reflect a great deal of credit on you . Whether or not you are right , of course time and the event alone can show . But whether you are right or wrong , I may as well tell you at once that I am going through with it to the end , sweet or bitter . If we are to be knocked on the head , all I have to say is , that I hope we get a little shooting first , eh , Good ? "
11734	11739	11742	11743	the captain	355	" Yes , yes , "
11745	11800	11742	11743	the captain	355	" We have all three of us been accustomed to face danger , and to hold our lives in our hands in various ways , so it is no good turning back now . And now I vote we go down to the saloon and take an observation just for luck , you know . "

12593	12797	12842	12842	Good	493	" which is a dreadful form of pneumonia , very prevalent in this country , they had all been inoculated against it . This is done by cutting a slit in the tail of an ox , and binding in a piece of the diseased lung of an animal which has died of the sickness . The result is that the ox sickens , takes the disease in a mild form , which causes its tail to drop off , as a rule about a foot from the root , and becomes proof against future attacks . It seems cruel to rob the animal of his tail , especially in a country where there are so many flies , but it is better to sacrifice the tail and keep the ox than to lose both tail and ox , for a tail without an ox is not much good , except to dust with . Still it does look odd to trek along behind twenty stumps , where there ought to be tails . It seems as though Nature made a trifling mistake , and stuck the stern ornaments of a lot of prize bull - dogs on to the rumps of the oxen .

For a while we tramped on in silence , till Umbopa , who was marching in front , broke into a Zulu chant about how some brave men , tired of life and the tameness of things , started off into a vast wilderness to find new things or die , and how , lo and behold ! when they had travelled far into the wilderness they found that it was not a wilderness at all , but a beautiful place full of young wives and fat cattle , of game to hunt and enemies to kill .

This is done by cutting a quantity of thorn bushes and piling them in the shape of a circular hedge . Then the space enclosed is smoothed , and dry tambouki grass , if obtainable , is made into a bed in the centre , and a fire or fires lighted .
16040	16357	15943	15945	the " boys	2915	" was finished the moon peeped up , and our dinners of giraffe steaks and roasted marrow - bones were ready . How we enjoyed those marrow - bones , though it was rather a job to crack them ! I know of no greater luxury than giraffe marrow , unless it is elephant 's heart , and we had that on the morrow . We ate our simple meal by the light of the moon , pausing at times to thank Good for his wonderful shot ; then we began to smoke and yarn , and a curious picture we must have made squatting there round the fire . I , with my short grizzled hair sticking up straight , and Sir Henry with his yellow locks , which were getting rather long , were rather a contrast , especially as I am thin , and short , and dark , weighing only nine stone and a half , and Sir Henry is tall , and broad , and fair , and weighs fifteen . But perhaps the most curious - looking of the three , taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration , was Captain John Good , R.N. There he sat upon a leather bag , looking just as though he had come in from a comfortable day 's shooting in a civilised country , absolutely clean , tidy , and well dressed . He wore a shooting suit of brown tweed , with a hat to match , and neat gaiters . As usual , he was beautifully shaved , his eye - glass and his false teeth appeared to be in perfect order , and altogether he looked the neatest man I ever had to do with in the wilderness . He even sported a collar , of which he had a supply , made of white gutta - percha .

But the herd had moved on some way during the night , and it was nine o'clock , and already very hot , before , by the broken trees , bruised leaves and bark , and smoking droppings , we knew that we could not be far from them .
17501	17672	17402	17402	We	596	Ventv"gel had said , between twenty and thirty , standing in a hollow , having finished their morning meal , and flapping their great ears . It was a splendid sight , for they were only about two hundred yards from us . Taking a handful of dry grass , I threw it into the air to see how the wind was ; for if once they winded us I knew they would be off before we could get a shot . Finding that , if anything , it blew from the elephants to us , we crept on stealthily , and thanks to the cover managed to get within forty yards or so of the great brutes . Just in front of us , and broadside on , stood three splendid bulls , one of them with enormous tusks . I whispered to the others that I would take the middle one ; Sir Henry covering the elephant to the left , and Good the bull with the big tusks .

19701	19769	19698	19698	he	101	" He is of a royal house , no doubt ; one can see it in his size and by his mien ; so , mayhap , am I. At least , I am as great a man . Be my mouth , O Macumazahn , and say my words to the Inkoos Incubu , my master , for I would speak to him and to thee . "
19836	19841	19843	19844	Sir Henry	97	" Yes , Umbopa , "
19846	19852	19843	19844	Sir Henry	97	" I would journey there . "
19853	19906	19907	19907	I	0	" The desert is wide and there is no water in it , the mountains are high and covered with snow , and man can not say what lies beyond them behind the place where the sun sets ; how shalt thou come thither , Incubu , and wherefore dost thou go ? "
19911	19915	19917	19918	Sir Henry	97	" Tell him , "
19920	19950	19917	19918	Sir Henry	97	" that I go because I believe that a man of my blood , my brother , has gone there before me , and I journey to seek him . "
19951	19994	19907	19907	I	0	" That is so , Incubu ; a Hottentot I met on the road told me that a white man went out into the desert two years ago towards those mountains with one servant , a hunter . They never came back . "
19995	20005	20007	20008	Sir Henry	97	" How do you know it was my brother ? "
20010	20068	19907	19907	I	0	" Nay , I know not . But the Hottentot , when I asked what the white man was like , said that he had thine eyes and a black beard . He said , too , that the name of the hunter with him was Jim ; that he was a Bechuana hunter and wore clothes . "
20069	20077	20079	20079	I	0	" There is no doubt about it , "
20081	20087	20079	20079	I	0	" I knew Jim well . "
20092	20099	20100	20100	he	97	" I was sure of it , "
20103	20155	20100	20100	he	97	" If George set his mind upon a thing he generally did it . It was always so from his boyhood . If he meant to cross the Suliman Berg he has crossed it , unless some accident overtook him , and we must look for him on the other side . "
20166	20175	20176	20176	he	132	" It is a far journey , Incubu , "
20186	20189	20191	20192	Sir Henry	97	" Yes , "
20194	20295	20191	20192	Sir Henry	97	" it is far . But there is no journey upon this earth that a man may not make if he sets his heart to it . There is nothing , Umbopa , that he can not do , there are no mountains he may not climb , there are no deserts he can not cross , save a mountain and a desert of which you are spared the knowledge , if love leads him and he holds his life in his hands counting it as nothing , ready to keep it or lose it as Heaven above may order . "
20299	20306	20308	20309	the Zulu	101	" Great words , my father , "
20325	20466	20308	20309	the Zulu	101	" great swelling words fit to fill the mouth of a man . Thou art right , my father Incubu . Listen ! what is life ? It is a feather , it is the seed of the grass , blown hither and thither , sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act , sometimes carried away into the heavens . But if that seed be good and heavy it may perchance travel a little way on the road it wills . It is well to try and journey one 's road and to fight with the air . Man must die . At the worst he can but die a little sooner . I will go with thee across the desert and over the mountains , unless perchance I fall to the ground on the way , my father . "
20520	20591	20743	20743	he	97	" What is life ? Tell me , O white men , who are wise , who know the secrets of the world , and of the world of stars , and the world that lies above and around the stars ; who flash your words from afar without a voice ; tell me , white men , the secret of our life - whither it goes and whence it comes !
20592	20729	20743	20743	he	97	" You can not answer me ; you know not . Listen , I will answer . Out of the dark we came , into the dark we go . Like a storm - driven bird at night we fly out of the Nowhere ; for a moment our wings are seen in the light of the fire , and , lo ! we are gone again into the Nowhere . Life is nothing . Life is all . It is the Hand with which we hold off Death . It is the glow - worm that shines in the night - time and is black in the morning ; it is the white breath of the oxen in winter ; it is the little shadow that runs across the grass and loses itself at sunset . "
20730	20737	20739	20740	Sir Henry	97	" You are a strange man , "
20750	20772	20747	20747	Umbopa	132	" It seems to me that we are much alike , Incubu . Perhaps I seek a brother over the mountains . "
20779	20785	20773	20773	I	0	" What dost thou mean ? "
20789	20798	20786	20786	I	0	" what dost thou know of those mountains ? "
20799	20872	20874	20874	I	0	" A little ; a very little . There is a strange land yonder , a land of witchcraft and beautiful things ; a land of brave people , and of trees , and streams , and snowy peaks , and of a great white road . I have heard of it . But what is the good of talking ? It grows dark . Those who live to see will see . "
20886	20895	20896	20896	he	132	" You need not fear me , Macumazahn , "
20903	20959	20896	20896	he	132	" I dig no holes for you to fall in . I make no plots . If ever we cross those mountains behind the sun I will tell what I know . But Death sits upon them . Be wise and turn back . Go and hunt elephants , my masters . I have spoken . "
20991	20998	21000	21001	Sir Henry	97	" That is an odd man , "
21003	21006	21008	21008	I	0	" Yes , "
21010	21067	21008	21008	I	0	" too odd by half . I do n't like his little ways . He knows something , and will not speak out . But I suppose it is no use quarrelling with him . We are in for a curious trip , and a mysterious Zulu wo n't make much difference one way or another . "
21287	21302	21303	21303	he	672	" Put the live devils out of the way up there in the thatch , "

22069	22078	22058	22066	the hired natives , with the gourds of water	693	Ventv"gel , were gathered in a little knot behind .

22093	22185	22089	22089	his	97	" we are going on about as strange a journey as men can make in this world . It is very doubtful if we can succeed in it . But we are three men who will stand together for good or for evil to the last . Now before we start let us for a moment pray to the Power who shapes the destinies of men , and who ages since has marked out our paths , that it may please Him to direct our steps in accordance with His will .

23939	23958	23937	23937	Good	493	" we must dig a hole , get in it , and cover ourselves with the karoo bushes . "
24057	24194	24028	24028	we	696	Ventv"gel , on whom , being a Hottentot , the heat had no particular effect . This gave us some slight shelter from the burning rays of the sun , but the atmosphere in that amateur grave can be better imagined than described . The Black Hole of Calcutta must have been a fool to it ; indeed , to this moment I do not know how we lived through the day . There we lay panting , and every now and again moistening our lips from our scanty supply of water . Had we followed our inclinations we should have finished all we possessed in the first two hours , but we were forced to exercise the most rigid care , for if our water failed us we knew that very soon we must perish miserably .

26214	26299	26322	26322	he	799	Ventv"gel to say that he smelt water , but we could see no signs of it , look which way we would . So far as the eye might reach there was nothing but arid sweltering sand and karoo scrub . We walked round the hillock and gazed about anxiously on the other side , but it was the same story , not a drop of water could be found ; there was no indication of a pan , a pool , or a spring .

Struggled on all day , but found no more melons , having evidently passed out of their district . Saw no game of any sort . Halted for the night at sundown , having had no food for many hours . Suffered much during the night from cold .

Only made about five miles all day ; found some patches of snow , of which we ate , but nothing else . Camped at night under the edge of a great plateau . Cold bitter . Drank a little brandy each , and huddled ourselves together , each wrapped up in his blanket , to keep ourselves alive . Are now suffering frightfully from starvation and weariness . Thought that Ventv"gel

Then his teeth stopped chattering . I did not think anything of it at the time , concluding that he had gone to sleep . His back was resting against mine , and it seemed to grow colder and colder , till at last it felt like ice .
29390	29465	29499	29499	someone	860	Ventv"gel , sitting there amongst us , stone dead . No wonder his back felt cold , poor fellow . He had died when I heard him sigh , and was now frozen almost stiff . Shocked beyond measure , we dragged ourselves from the corpse - how strange is that horror we mortals have of the companionship of a dead body - and left it sitting there , its arms clasped about its knees .

32362	32405	32360	32360	Good	493	" the road no doubt ran right over the range and across the desert on the other side , but the sand there has covered it up , and above us it has been obliterated by some volcanic eruption of molten lava . "
32469	32671	32711	32711	captives	937	Ventv"gel 's sad fate , and of that grim cave where he kept company with the old Dom , we should have felt positively cheerful , notwithstanding the sense of unknown dangers before us . Every mile we walked the atmosphere grew softer and balmier , and the country before us shone with a yet more luminous beauty . As for the road itself , I never saw such an engineering work , though Sir Henry said that the great road over the St. Gothard in Switzerland is very similar . No difficulty had been too great for the Old World engineer who laid it out . At one place we came to a ravine three hundred feet broad and at least a hundred feet deep . This vast gulf was actually filled in with huge blocks of dressed stone , having arches pierced through them at the bottom for a waterway , over which the road went on sublimely . At another place it was cut in zigzags out of the side of a precipice five hundred feet deep , and in a third it tunnelled through the base of an intervening ridge , a space of thirty yards or more .
32719	32722	32724	32725	Sir Henry	97	" Well , "
32735	32788	32724	32725	Sir Henry	97	" it is very well to call this Solomon 's Road , but my humble opinion is that the Egyptians had been here before Solomon 's people ever set a foot on it . If this is n't Egyptian or Phoenician handiwork , I must say that it is very like it . "
32881	32884	32886	32886	Good	98	" Ah ! "
32898	32921	32886	32886	Good	98	" here is lots of wood , let us stop and cook some dinner ; I have about digested that raw heart . "

34037	34068	34070	34070	he	971	" who are you ? and why are the faces of three of you white , and the face of the fourth as the face of our mother 's sons ? "

34154	34162	34140	34140	I	0	" and this man is our servant . "
34163	34167	34168	34168	he	971	" You lie , "
34171	34227	34168	34168	he	971	" no strangers can cross the mountains where all things perish . But what do your lies matter ? - if ye are strangers then ye must die , for no strangers may live in the land of the Kukuanas . It is the king 's law . Prepare then to die , O strangers ! "
34268	34275	34277	34277	Good	98	" What does that beggar say ? "
34279	34289	34290	34290	I	0	" He says we are going to be killed , "
34294	34299	34301	34301	Good	98	" Oh , Lord ! "

34443	34451	34453	34455	the old man	971	" How is it , O strangers , "
34458	34551	34453	34455	the old man	971	" that this fat man pointing to Good , who was clad in nothing but boots and a flannel shirt , and had only half finished his shaving , whose body is clothed , and whose legs are bare , who grows hair on one side of his sickly face and not on the other , and who wears one shining and transparent eye - how is it , I ask , that he has teeth which move of themselves , coming away from the jaws and returning of their own will ? "

34714	34760	34710	34710	he	982	" did ever man born of woman have hair on one side of his face and not on the other , or a round and transparent eye , or teeth which moved and melted away and grew again ? Pardon us , O my lords . "
34778	34783	34784	34784	I	0	" It is granted , "

34972	35025	34969	34969	I	0	" ye might think that after so long a journey we should find it in our hearts to avenge such a reception , mayhap to strike cold in death the imperious hand that - that , in short - threw a knife at the head of him whose teeth come and go . "
35026	35033	35035	35037	the old man	971	" Spare him , my lords , "
35041	35068	35035	35037	the old man	971	" he is the king 's son , and I am his uncle . If anything befalls him his blood will be required at my hands . "

35516	35535	35512	35512	I	0	" let one of you go stand upon that rock that I may make him as this buck . "
35557	35594	35512	35512	I	0	" It is well said . Do thou , my uncle , go stand upon the rock . It is but a buck that the magic has killed . Surely it can not kill a man . "
35613	35618	35619	35619	he	3032	" No ! no ! "
35623	35670	35619	35619	he	3032	" my old eyes have seen enough . These are wizards , indeed . Let us bring them to the king . Yet if any should wish a further proof , let him stand upon the rock , that the magic tube may speak with him . "

35698	35717	35696	35696	one	337	" we are satisfied . All the witchcraft of our people can not show the like of this . "
35718	35723	35725	35727	the old gentleman	3032	" It is so , "
35736	35792	35725	35727	the old gentleman	3032	" without any doubt it is so . Listen , children of the Stars , children of the shining Eye and the movable Teeth , who roar out in thunder , and slay from afar . I am Infadoos , son of Kafa , once king of the Kukuana people . This youth is Scragga . "
35793	35799	35801	35801	Good	98	" He nearly scragged me , "

35875	35892	35872	35872	I	0	" lead us then to Twala . We do not talk with low people and underlings . "
35893	35939	35725	35727	the old gentleman	3032	" It is well , my lords , we will lead you ; but the way is long . We are hunting three days ' journey from the place of the king . But let my lords have patience , and we will lead them . "
35940	35945	35946	35946	I	0	" So be it , "
35950	36075	35946	35946	I	0	" all time is before us , for we do not die . We are ready , lead on . But Infadoos , and thou Scragga , beware ! Play us no monkey tricks , set for us no foxes ' snares , for before your brains of mud have thought of them we shall know and avenge . The light of the transparent eye of him with the bare legs and the half - haired face shall destroy you , and go through your land ; his vanishing teeth shall affix themselves fast in you and eat you up , you and your wives and children ; the magic tubes shall argue with you loudly , and make you as sieves . Beware ! "

36242	36251	36238	36240	the old man	971	" Surely his slave shall carry the things . "
36252	36261	36263	36263	Good	98	" But I want to put 'em on ! "
36272	36278	36280	36280	Infadoos	162	" Nay , my lord , "
36282	36323	36280	36280	Infadoos	162	" would my lord cover up his beautiful white legs although he is so dark Good has a singularly white skin from the eyes of his servants ? Have we offended my lord that he should do such a thing ? "
36343	36347	36349	36349	Good	98	" Damn it ! "
36351	36360	36349	36349	Good	98	" that black villain has got my trousers . "
36361	36367	36369	36370	Sir Henry	97	" Look here , Good , "
36372	36424	36369	36370	Sir Henry	97	" you have appeared in this country in a certain character , and you must live up to it . It will never do for you to put on trousers again . Henceforth you must exist in a flannel shirt , a pair of boots , and an eye - glass . "
36425	36428	36429	36429	I	0	" Yes , "
36432	36495	36429	36429	I	0	" and with whiskers on one side of your face and not on the other . If you change any of these things the people will think that we are impostors . I am very sorry for you , but , seriously , you must . If once they begin to suspect us our lives will not be worth a brass farthing . "
36496	36503	36505	36505	Good	98	" Do you really think so ? "
36508	36563	36369	36370	Sir Henry	97	" I do , indeed . Your ' beautiful white legs ' and your eye - glass are now the features of our party , and as Sir Henry says , you must live up to them . Be thankful that you have got your boots on , and that the air is warm . "
36630	36633	36634	36634	I	0	" Infadoos , "
36639	36645	36634	36634	I	0	" who made this road ? "
36646	36705	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" It was made , my lord , of old time , none know how or when , not even the wise woman Gagool , who has lived for generations . We are not old enough to remember its making . None can fashion such roads now , but the king suffers no grass to grow upon it . "
36706	36727	36728	36728	I	0	" And whose are the writings on the wall of the caves through which we have passed on the road ? "
36743	36765	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" My lord , the hands that made the road wrote the wonderful writings . We know not who wrote them . "
36766	36777	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" When did the Kukuana people come into this country ? "
36778	36808	36810	36810	he	1021	" My lord , the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten thousand thousand moons ago , from the great lands which lie there beyond , "
36816	36864	36867	36867	he	1021	" They could travel no further because of the high mountains which ring in the land , so say the old voices of our fathers that have descended to us the children , and so says Gagool , the wise woman , the smeller out of witches , "
36876	36929	36867	36867	he	1021	" The country , too , was good , so they settled here and grew strong and powerful , and now our numbers are like the sea sand , and when Twala the king calls up his regiments their plumes cover the plain so far as the eye of man can reach . "
36930	36951	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" And if the land is walled in with mountains , who is there for the regiments to fight with ? "
36952	37033	36867	36867	he	1021	" Nay , my lord , the country is open there towards the north , and now and again warriors sweep down upon us in clouds from a land we know not , and we slay them . It is the third part of the life of a man since there was a war . Many thousands died in it , but we destroyed those who came to eat us up . So since then there has been no war . "
37034	37048	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" Your warriors must grow weary of resting on their spears , Infadoos . "
37049	37081	36867	36867	he	1021	" My lord , there was one war , just after we destroyed the people that came down upon us , but it was a civil war ; dog ate dog . "
37082	37087	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" How was that ? "
37088	37179	36867	36867	he	1021	" My lord the king , my half - brother , had a brother born at the same birth , and of the same woman . It is not our custom , my lord , to suffer twins to live ; the weaker must always die . But the mother of the king hid away the feebler child , which was born the last , for her heart yearned over it , and that child is Twala the king . I am his younger brother , born of another wife . "
37180	37183	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" Well ? "
37184	37331	36867	36867	he	1021	" My lord , Kafa , our father , died when we came to manhood , and my brother Imotu was made king in his place , and for a space reigned and had a son by his favourite wife . When the babe was three years old , just after the great war , during which no man could sow or reap , a famine came upon the land , and the people murmured because of the famine , and looked round like a starved lion for something to rend . Then it was that Gagool , the wise and terrible woman , who does not die , made a proclamation to the people , saying , ' The king Imotu is no king . ' And at the time Imotu was sick with a wound , and lay in his kraal not able to move .
37332	37432	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" Then Gagool went into a hut and led out Twala , my half - brother , and twin brother to the king , whom she had hidden among the caves and rocks since he was born , and stripping the ' moocha ' waist - cloth off his loins , showed the people of the Kukuanas the mark of the sacred snake coiled round his middle , wherewith the eldest son of the king is marked at birth , and cried out loud , ' Behold your king whom I have saved for you even to this day ! '
37433	37535	36867	36867	he	1021	" Now the people being mad with hunger , and altogether bereft of reason and the knowledge of truth , cried out - ' The king ! The king ! ' but I knew that it was not so , for Imotu my brother was the elder of the twins , and our lawful king . Then just as the tumult was at its height Imotu the king , though he was very sick , crawled from his hut holding his wife by the hand , and followed by his little son Ignosi - that is , by interpretation , the Lightning .
37536	37557	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" ' What is this noise ? ' he asked . ' Why cry ye The king ! The king ! '
37558	37633	36867	36867	he	1021	" Then Twala , his twin brother , born of the same woman , and in the same hour , ran to him , and taking him by the hair , stabbed him through the heart with his knife . And the people being fickle , and ever ready to worship the rising sun , clapped their hands and cried , ' Twala is king ! Now we know that Twala is king ! ' "
37634	37653	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" And what became of Imotu 's wife and her son Ignosi ? Did Twala kill them too ? "
37654	37775	36867	36867	he	1021	" Nay , my lord . When she saw that her lord was dead the queen seized the child with a cry and ran away . Two days afterward she came to a kraal very hungry , and none would give her milk or food , now that her lord the king was dead , for all men hate the unfortunate . But at nightfall a little child , a girl , crept out and brought her corn to eat , and she blessed the child , and went on towards the mountains with her boy before the sun rose again , and there she must have perished , for none have seen her since , nor the child Ignosi . "
37776	37795	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" Then if this child Ignosi had lived he would be the true king of the Kukuana people ? "
37796	37828	36867	36867	he	1021	" That is so , my lord ; the sacred snake is round his middle . If he lives he is king ; but , alas ! he is long dead . "
37829	37835	36613	36613	Infadoos	162	" See , my lord , "
37869	37902	37903	37903	he	162	" That is the kraal where the wife of Imotu was last seen with the child Ignosi . It is there that we shall sleep to - night , if , indeed , "
37907	37917	37903	37903	he	162	" my lords sleep at all upon this earth . "
37918	37938	37939	37939	I	0	" When we are among the Kukuanas , my good friend Infadoos , we do as the Kukuanas do , "
38314	38322	38323	38323	he	97	" Let not my lords be afraid , "
38327	38355	38323	38323	he	97	" for in my breast there dwells no guile . This regiment is one under my command , and comes out by my orders to greet you . "

39415	39479	39407	39407	he	162	" and deign to rest awhile in our humble habitations . A little food shall be brought to you , so that ye may have no need to draw your belts tight from hunger ; some honey and some milk , and an ox or two , and a few sheep ; not much , my lords , but still a little food .

40787	40829	40783	40783	I	0	" you are right , in the Stars we learn many things . I have heard , for instance , that the wise men of old came to these mountains to find bright stones , pretty playthings , and yellow iron . "

41039	41076	41036	41037	Sir Henry	97	" is our black friend driving at ? He knows more than he chooses to say , that is clear . By the way , Quatermain , has he heard anything of - of my brother ? "
41077	41107	41005	41005	He	169	" Nothing ; he has asked everyone he has become friendly with , but they all declare that no white man has ever been seen in the country before . "
41108	41119	41121	41121	Good	98	" Do you suppose that he got here at all ? "
41123	41146	41121	41121	Good	98	" we have only reached the place by a miracle ; is it likely he could have reached it without the map ? "

41159	41170	41155	41156	Sir Henry	97	" but somehow I think that I shall find him . "

We had already given a few to Infadoos and Scragga , and found that they were delighted with them , never having seen such things before .

Your fathers knew me , and their fathers knew me , and their fathers ' fathers ' fathers . I have seen the white man and know his desires . I am old , but the mountains are older than I. Who made the great road , tell me ? Who wrote the pictures on the rocks , tell me ? Who reared up the three Silent Ones yonder , that gaze across the pit , tell me ? "

Never for ages upon ages has a white foot pressed this land ; never except once , and I remember that he left it but to die . Ye come for bright stones ; I know it - I know it ; ye shall find them when the blood is dry ; but shall ye return whence ye came , or shall ye stop with me ? Ha ! ha ! ha !

45830	45835	45836	45836	I	0	" Now , Infadoos , "
45839	45846	45836	45836	I	0	" we would speak with thee . "
45847	45854	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" Let my lords say on . "
45855	45872	45836	45836	I	0	" It seems to us , Infadoos , that Twala the king is a cruel man . "
45873	46066	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" It is so , my lords . Alas ! the land cries out because of his cruelties . To - night ye shall see . It is the great witch - hunt , and many will be smelt out as wizards and slain . No man 's life is safe . If the king covets a man 's cattle , or a man 's wife , or if he fears a man that he should excite a rebellion against him , then Gagool , whom ye saw , or some of the witch - finding women whom she has taught , will smell that man out as a wizard , and he will be killed . Many must die before the moon grows pale to - night . It is ever so . Perhaps I too shall be killed . As yet I have been spared because I am skilled in war , and am beloved by the soldiers ; but I know not how long I have to live . The land groans at the cruelties of Twala the king ; it is wearied of him and his red ways . "
46067	46084	45836	45836	I	0	" Then why is it , Infadoos , that the people do not cast him down ? "
46085	46168	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" Nay , my lords , he is the king , and if he were killed Scragga would reign in his place , and the heart of Scragga is blacker than the heart of Twala his father . If Scragga were king his yoke upon our neck would be heavier than the yoke of Twala . If Imotu had never been slain , or if Ignosi his son had lived , it might have been otherwise ; but they are both dead . "
46169	46178	45836	45836	I	0	" How knowest thou that Ignosi is dead ? "
46198	46205	46207	46207	Infadoos	162	" What meanest thou , boy ? "
46209	46216	46207	46207	Infadoos	162	" who told thee to speak ? "
46217	46222	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" Listen , Infadoos , "
46227	46260	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" and I will tell thee a story . Years ago the king Imotu was killed in this country and his wife fled with the boy Ignosi . Is it not so ? "
46261	46266	46207	46207	Infadoos	162	" It is so . "
46267	46287	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" It was said that the woman and her son died upon the mountains . Is it not so ? "
46288	46294	46207	46207	Infadoos	162	" It is even so . "
46295	46345	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" Well , it came to pass that the mother and the boy Ignosi did not die . They crossed the mountains and were led by a tribe of wandering desert men across the sands beyond , till at last they came to water and grass and trees again . "
46346	46352	46207	46207	Infadoos	162	" How knowest thou this ? "
46353	46442	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" Listen . They travelled on and on , many months ' journey , till they reached a land where a people called the Amazulu , who also are of the Kukuana stock , live by war , and with them they tarried many years , till at length the mother died . Then the son Ignosi became a wanderer again , and journeyed into a land of wonders , where white people live , and for many more years he learned the wisdom of the white people . "
46443	46450	46452	46452	Infadoos	162	" It is a pretty story , "
46455	46608	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" For years he lived there working as a servant and a soldier , but holding in his heart all that his mother had told him of his own place , and casting about in his mind to find how he might journey thither to see his people and his father 's house before he died . For long years he lived and waited , and at last the time came , as it ever comes to him who can wait for it , and he met some white men who would seek this unknown land , and joined himself to them . The white men started and travelled on and on , seeking for one who is lost . They crossed the burning desert , they crossed the snow - clad mountains , and at last reached the land of the Kukuanas , and there they found thee , O Infadoos . "
46609	46618	46620	46623	the astonished old soldier	1271	" Surely thou art mad to talk thus , "
46625	46640	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" Thou thinkest so ; see , I will show thee , O my uncle .
46641	46652	45813	45816	THE WITCH - HUNT	1268	" I am Ignosi , rightful king of the Kukuanas ! "

46681	46686	46678	46678	he	169	" what is this ? "
46741	46746	46747	46747	he	162	" Koom ! Koom ! "
46750	46763	46747	46747	he	162	" it is my brother 's son ; it is the king . "
46764	46903	46917	46917	he	971	" Did I not tell thee so , my uncle ? Rise ; I am not yet the king , but with thy help , and with the help of these brave white men , who are my friends , I shall be . Yet the old witch Gagool was right , the land shall run with blood first , and hers shall run with it , if she has any and can die , for she killed my father with her words , and drove my mother forth . And now , Infadoos , choose thou . Wilt thou put thy hands between my hands and be my man ? Wilt thou share the dangers that lie before me , and help me to overthrow this tyrant and murderer , or wilt thou not ? Choose thou . "
46942	46989	46917	46917	he	971	" Ignosi , rightful king of the Kukuanas , I put my hand between thy hands , and am thy man till death . When thou wast a babe I dandled thee upon my knees , now shall my old arm strike for thee and freedom . "
46990	47037	46917	46917	he	971	" It is well , Infadoos ; if I conquer , thou shalt be the greatest man in the kingdom after its king . If I fail , thou canst only die , and death is not far off from thee . Rise , my uncle . "
47038	47085	46917	46917	he	971	" And ye , white men , will ye help me ? What have I to offer you ! The white stones ! If I conquer and can find them , ye shall have as many as ye can carry hence . Will that suffice you ? "
47091	47095	47097	47098	Sir Henry	97	" Tell him , "
47100	47195	47097	47098	Sir Henry	97	" that he mistakes an Englishman . Wealth is good , and if it comes in our way we will take it ; but a gentleman does not sell himself for wealth . Still , speaking for myself , I say this . I have always liked Umbopa , and so far as lies in me I will stand by him in this business . It will be very pleasant to me to try to square matters with that cruel devil Twala . What do you say , Good , and you , Quatermain ? "
47196	47199	47201	47201	Good	98	" Well , "
47203	47264	47201	47201	Good	98	" to adopt the language of hyperbole , in which all these people seem to indulge , you can tell him that a row is surely good , and warms the cockles of the heart , and that so far as I am concerned I 'm his boy . My only stipulation is that he allows me to wear trousers . "
47273	47281	47283	47283	Ignosi	169	" It is well , my friends , "
47288	47311	47283	47283	Ignosi	169	" and what sayest thou , Macumazahn , art thou also with me , old hunter , cleverer than a wounded buffalo ? "
47320	47326	47327	47327	I	0	" Umbopa , or Ignosi , "
47330	47349	47327	47327	I	0	" I do n't like revolutions . I am a man of peace and a bit of a coward "
47355	47460	47352	47352	Umbopa	169	" but , on the other hand , I stick up for my friends , Ignosi . You have stuck to us and played the part of a man , and I will stick by you . But mind you , I am a trader , and have to make my living , so I accept your offer about those diamonds in case we should ever be in a position to avail ourselves of it . Another thing : we came , as you know , to look for Incubu 's Sir Henry 's lost brother . You must help us to find him . "
47461	47467	47469	47469	Ignosi	169	" That I will do , "
47471	47505	47469	47469	Ignosi	169	" Stay , Infadoos , by the sign of the snake about my middle , tell me the truth . Has any white man to thy knowledge set his foot within the land ? "
47506	47512	47352	47352	Umbopa	169	" None , O Ignosi . "
47513	47530	47469	47469	Ignosi	169	" If any white man had been seen or heard of , wouldst thou have known ? "
47531	47538	47352	47352	Umbopa	169	" I should certainly have known . "
47539	47545	47547	47547	Ignosi	169	" Thou hearest , Incubu , "
47552	47559	47547	47547	Ignosi	169	" he has not been here . "
47560	47565	47567	47568	Sir Henry	97	" Well , well , "
47574	47608	47567	47568	Sir Henry	97	" there it is ; I suppose that he never got so far . Poor fellow , poor fellow ! So it has all been for nothing . God 's will be done . "
47609	47614	47615	47615	I	0	" Now for business , "
47627	47653	47615	47615	I	0	" It is very well to be a king by right divine , Ignosi , but how dost thou propose to become a king indeed ? "
47654	47668	47567	47568	Sir Henry	97	" Nay , I know not . Infadoos , hast thou a plan ? "
47669	47677	47679	47680	his uncle	3094	" Ignosi , Son of the Lightning , "
47682	47851	47679	47680	his uncle	3094	" to - night is the great dance and witch - hunt . Many shall be smelt out and perish , and in the hearts of many others there will be grief and anguish and fury against the king Twala . When the dance is over , then I will speak to some of the great chiefs , who in turn , if I can win them over , will speak to their regiments . I shall speak to the chiefs softly at first , and bring them to see that thou art indeed the king , and I think that by to - morrow 's light thou shalt have twenty thousand spears at thy command . And now I must go and think , and hear , and make ready . After the dance is done , if I am yet alive , and we are all alive , I will meet thee here , and we can talk . At the best there must be war . "
47907	47923	47925	47930	a herald who came with them	1281	" The gifts of my lord the king to the white men from the Stars ! "
47932	47938	47939	47939	I	0	" We thank the king , "
47942	47945	47939	47939	I	0	" withdraw . "
47998	48010	48011	48011	I	0	" Do you make these things in this country , Infadoos ? "
48014	48020	48011	48011	I	0	" they are very beautiful . "
48021	48119	47951	47951	we	1275	" Nay , my lord , they came down to us from our forefathers . We know not who made them , and there are but few left . 1 None but those of royal blood may be clad in them . They are magic coats through which no spear can pass , and those who wear them are well - nigh safe in the battle . The king is well pleased or much afraid , or he would not have sent these garments of steel . Clothe yourselves in them to - night , my lords . "
48488	48491	48492	48492	I	0	" Surely , "
48497	48504	48492	48492	I	0	" the whole army is here ? "
48505	48510	48511	48511	he	162	" Nay , Macumazahn , "
48514	48575	48511	48511	he	162	" but a third of it . One third is present at this dance each year , another third is mustered outside in case there should be trouble when the killing begins , ten thousand more garrison the outposts round Loo , and the rest watch at the kraals in the country . Thou seest it is a great people . "
48576	48582	48584	48584	Good	98	" They are very silent , "
48603	48608	48610	48610	Infadoos	162	" What says Bougwan ? "
48615	48628	48629	48629	he	162	" Those over whom the shadow of Death is hovering are silent , "
48633	48639	48678	48678	Good	98	" Will many be killed ? "
48640	48644	48678	48678	Good	98	" Very many . "
48645	48649	48650	48650	I	0	" It seems , "
48656	48672	48650	48650	I	0	" that we are going to assist at a gladiatorial show arranged regardless of expense . "
48690	48694	48695	48695	I	0	" Tell me , "
48699	48705	48695	48695	I	0	" are we in danger ? "
48706	48744	48680	48680	he	98	" I know not , my lords , I trust not ; but do not seem afraid . If ye live through the night all may go well with you . The soldiers murmur against the king . "
48788	48814	48816	48816	Infadoos	162	" It is the king Twala , Scragga his son , and Gagool the old ; and see , with them are those who slay , "
48869	48875	48876	48876	Twala	165	" Greeting , white lords , "
48884	48930	48932	48932	he	165	" be seated , waste not precious time - the night is all too short for the deeds that must be done . Ye come in a good hour , and shall see a glorious show . Look round , white lords ; look round , "
48943	48981	48932	48932	he	165	" Can the Stars show you such a sight as this ? See how they shake in their wickedness , all those who have evil in their hearts and fear the judgment of ' Heaven above . ' "
48982	48987	48992	48992	her	122	" Begin ! begin ! "

49473	49550	49378	49378	her	1321	" Good ! good ! good ! Are your senses awake , Isanusis - can ye smell blood , can ye purge the land of the wicked ones who compass evil against the king and against their neighbours ? Are ye ready to do the justice of ' Heaven above , ' ye whom I have taught , who have eaten of the bread of my wisdom , and drunk of the water of my magic ? "
49551	49557	49378	49378	her	1321	" Mother , we can . "
49558	49572	49378	49378	her	1321	" Then go ! Tarry not , ye vultures ; see , the slayers "
49583	49601	49378	49378	her	1321	" make sharp their spears ; the white men from afar are hungry to see . Go ! "

50591	50609	50611	50611	Good	98	" Hang me if I do n't believe she is going to try her games on us , "
50615	50618	50620	50621	Sir Henry	97	" Nonsense ! "

50829	50867	50820	50820	I	0	" this man is the servant of thy guests , he is their dog ; whosoever sheds the blood of our dog sheds our blood . By the sacred law of hospitality I claim protection for him . "

50986	51008	50983	50983	I	0	" if ye would see to - morrow 's light . Touch one hair of his head and your king dies , "
51068	51071	51072	51072	I	0	" Well , "
51075	51084	51072	51072	I	0	" what is it to be , Twala ? "
51089	51096	51097	51097	he	165	" Put away your magic tubes , "
51100	51134	51097	51097	he	165	" ye have adjured me in the name of hospitality , and for that reason , but not from fear of what ye can do , I spare him . Go in peace . "
51135	51140	51141	51141	I	0	" It is well , "
51145	51161	51141	51141	I	0	" we are weary of slaughter , and would sleep . Is the dance ended ? "
51162	51167	51168	51168	Twala	165	" It is ended , "
51172	51178	51168	51168	Twala	165	" Let these dead dogs , "
51187	51198	51200	51200	he	165	" be flung out to the hyænas and the vultures , "
51263	51266	51268	51269	Sir Henry	97	" Well , "
51313	51324	51344	51344	Good	98	" well , I feel uncommonly inclined to be sick . "
51325	51341	51344	51344	Good	98	" If I had any doubts about helping Umbopa to rebel against that infernal blackguard , "
51346	51421	51344	51344	Good	98	" they are gone now . It was as much as I could do to sit still while that slaughter was going on . I tried to keep my eyes shut , but they would open just at the wrong time . I wonder where Infadoos is . Umbopa , my friend , you ought to be grateful to us ; your skin came near to having an air - hole made in it . "
51422	51429	51431	51431	Umbopa	169	" I am grateful , Bougwan , "
51440	51465	51431	51431	Umbopa	169	" and I shall not forget . As for Infadoos , he will be here by - and - by . We must wait . "
51623	51627	51628	51628	he	162	" My lords , "
51631	51659	51628	51628	he	162	" I have come according to my word . My lords and Ignosi , rightful king of the Kukuanas , I have brought with me these men , "
51667	51753	51628	51628	he	162	" who are great men among us , having each one of them the command of three thousand soldiers , that live but to do their bidding , under the king 's . I have told them of what I have seen , and what my ears have heard . Now let them also behold the sacred snake around thee , and hear thy story , Ignosi , that they may say whether or no they will make cause with thee against Twala the king . "
51823	51831	51836	51836	he	162	" Now ye have heard , chiefs , "
51840	51939	51836	51836	he	162	" what say ye : will ye stand by this man and help him to his father 's throne , or will ye not ? The land cries out against Twala , and the blood of the people flows like the waters in spring . Ye have seen to - night . Two other chiefs there were with whom I had it in my mind to speak , and where are they now ? The hyænas howl over their corpses . Soon shall ye be as they are if ye strike not . Choose then , my brothers . "
51966	52160	51940	51945	The eldest of the six men	1391	" Thy words are true , Infadoos ; the land cries out . My own brother is among those who died to - night ; but this is a great matter , and the thing is hard to believe . How know we that if we lift our spears it may not be for a thief and a liar ? It is a great matter , I say , of which none can see the end . For of this be sure , blood will flow in rivers before the deed is done ; many will still cleave to the king , for men worship the sun that still shines bright in the heavens , rather than that which has not risen . These white men from the Stars , their magic is great , and Ignosi is under the cover of their wing . If he be indeed the rightful king , let them give us a sign , and let the people have a sign , that all may see . So shall men cleave to us , knowing of a truth that the white man 's magic is with them . "
52161	52170	52171	52171	I	0	" Ye have the sign of the snake , "
52174	52215	51940	51945	The eldest of the six men	1391	" My lord , it is not enough . The snake may have been placed there since the man 's childhood . Show us a sign , and it will suffice . But we will not move without a sign . "
52239	52247	52249	52249	Good	98	" I think that I have it , "
52252	52263	52249	52249	Good	98	" ask them to give us a moment to think . "
52313	52331	52332	52332	he	98	" Now look here , you fellows , is n't to - morrow the 4th of June ? "
52354	52407	52332	52332	he	98	" Very good ; then here we have it - ' 4 June , total eclipse of the moon commences at 8.15 Greenwich time , visible in Teneriffe - South Africa , c. ' There 's a sign for you . Tell them we will darken the moon to - morrow night . "
52466	52474	52476	52477	Sir Henry	97	" Suppose that the almanack is wrong , "
52497	52509	52511	52511	his	98	" I see no reason to suppose anything of the sort , "
52514	52602	52511	52511	his	98	" Eclipses always come up to time ; at least that is my experience of them , and it especially states that this one will be visible in South Africa . I have worked out the reckonings as well as I can , without knowing our exact position ; and I make out that the eclipse should begin here about ten o'clock tomorrow night , and last till half - past twelve . For an hour and a half or so there should be almost total darkness . "
52603	52606	52608	52609	Sir Henry	97	" Well , "
52611	52620	52608	52609	Sir Henry	97	" I suppose we had better risk it . "
52672	52784	52667	52667	I	0	" Great men of the Kukuanas , and thou , Infadoos , listen . We love not to show our powers , for to do so is to interfere with the course of nature , and to plunge the world into fear and confusion . But since this matter is a great one , and as we are angered against the king because of the slaughter we have seen , and because of the act of the Isanusi Gagool , who would have put our friend Ignosi to death , we have determined to break a rule , and to give such a sign as all men may see . Come hither "
52806	52812	52787	52787	I	0	" What see ye there ? "
52813	52820	52822	52826	the spokesman of the party	1398	" We see the sinking moon , "
52828	52863	52787	52787	I	0	" It is so . Now tell me , can any mortal man put out that moon before her hour of setting , and bring the curtain of black night down upon the land ? "
52873	52904	52864	52865	The chief	2881	" No , my lord , that no man can do . The moon is stronger than man who looks on her , nor can she vary in her courses . "
52905	52982	52864	52865	The chief	2881	" Ye say so . Yet I tell you that to - morrow night , about two hours before midnight , we will cause the moon to be eaten up for a space of an hour and half an hour . Yes , deep darkness shall cover the earth , and it shall be for a sign that Ignosi is indeed king of the Kukuanas . If we do this thing , will ye be satisfied ? "
52983	52989	52991	52993	the old chief	1401	" Yea , my lords , "
53008	53021	52991	52993	the old chief	1401	" if ye do this thing , we will be satisfied indeed . "
53022	53054	52864	52865	The chief	2881	" It shall be done ; we three , Incubu , Bougwan , and Macumazahn , have said it , and it shall be done . Dost thou hear , Infadoos ? "
53055	53091	52991	52993	the old chief	1401	" I hear , my lord , but it is a wonderful thing that ye promise , to put out the moon , the mother of the world , when she is at her full . "
53092	53101	52864	52865	The chief	2881	" Yet shall we do it , Infadoos . "
53102	53174	53176	53176	he	1403	" It is well , my lords . To - day , two hours after sunset , Twala will send for my lords to witness the girls dance , and one hour after the dance begins the girl whom Twala thinks the fairest shall be killed by Scragga , the king 's son , as a sacrifice to the Silent Ones , who sit and keep watch by the mountains yonder , "
53194	53217	53176	53176	he	1403	" Then let my lords darken the moon , and save the maiden 's life , and the people will believe indeed . "
53218	53221	53223	53225	the old chief	1401	" Ay , "
53232	53239	53223	53225	the old chief	1401	" the people will believe indeed . "
53240	53246	53249	53249	Infadoos	162	" Two miles from Loo , "
53251	53350	53249	53249	Infadoos	162	" there is a hill curved like a new moon , a stronghold , where my regiment , and three other regiments which these chiefs command , are stationed . This morning we will make a plan whereby two or three other regiments may be moved there also . Then , if in truth my lords can darken the moon , in the darkness I will take my lords by the hand and lead them out of Loo to this place , where they shall be safe , and thence we can make war upon Twala the king . "
53351	53356	53358	53358	I.	1406	" It is good , "
53359	53373	53358	53358	I.	1406	" Let leave us to sleep awhile and to make ready our magic . "
53388	53392	53394	53394	Ignosi	169	" My friends , "
53403	53421	53394	53394	Ignosi	169	" can ye do this wonderful thing , or were ye speaking empty words to the captains ? "
53422	53438	53358	53358	I.	1406	" We believe that we can do it , Umbopa - Ignosi , I mean . "
53439	53444	53445	53445	he	169	" It is strange , "
53448	53490	53445	53445	he	169	" and had ye not been Englishmen I would not have believed it ; but I have learned that English ' gentlemen ' tell no lies . If we live through the matter , be sure that I will repay you . "

53531	53536	53524	53526	the big man	316	" What is it ? "
53537	53585	53445	53445	he	169	" This : that if ever you come to be king of this people you will do away with the smelling out of wizards such as we saw last night ; and that the killing of men without trial shall no longer take place in the land . "

Kisses and the tender words of women are sweet , but the sound of the clashing of the spears of warriors , and the smell of men 's blood , are sweeter far ! Would ye have wives from among our people , white men ? If so , choose the fairest here , and ye shall have them , as many as ye will , "
54331	54364	54324	54324	I	0	" Thanks to thee , O king , but we white men we d only with white women like ourselves . Your maidens are fair , but they are not for us ! "

In our land there is a proverb which runs , ' Women 's eyes are always bright , whatever the colour , ' and another that says , ' Love her who is present , for be sure she who is absent is false to thee ; ' but perhaps these things are not so in the Stars . In a land where men are white all things are possible . So be it , white men ; the girls will not go begging ! Welcome again ; and welcome , too , thou black one ; if Gagool here had won her way , thou wouldst have been stiff and cold by now . It is lucky for thee that thou too camest from the Stars ; ha ! ha ! "

55023	55152	55015	55015	he	165	" must have their due . Did I fail to put the fairest girl to death to - day , misfortune would fall upon me and my house . Thus runs the prophecy of my people : ' If the king offer not a sacrifice of a fair girl , on the day of the dance of maidens , to the Old Ones who sit and watch on the mountains , then shall he fall , and his house . ' Look ye , white men , my brother who reigned before me offered not the sacrifice , because of the tears of the woman , and he fell , and his house , and I reign in his stead .

Woe is me , that I shall never see my father 's hut again , nor feel my mother 's kiss , nor tend the lamb that is sick !

Look here , Quatermain , this business is nasty , and one with which , properly speaking , we ought not to be mixed up , but we are in for it , so we must make the best of our job . Speaking personally , I had rather be killed fighting than any other way , and now that there seems little chance of our finding my poor brother , it makes the idea easier to me . But fortune favours the brave , and we may succeed . Anyway , the battle will be awful , and having a reputation to keep up , we shall need to be in the thick of the thing . "

Thou art wise , and hast doubtless seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camest - that is if indeed they make wars in the Stars . Now tell us , what shall we do ? Twala has brought up many fresh men to take the place of those who have fallen . Yet Twala has learnt his lesson ; the hawk did not think to find the heron ready ; but our beak has pierced his breast ; he fears to strike at us again . We too are wounded , and he will wait for us to die ; he will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck , and fight the fight of ' sit down . ' "

64761	64899	64749	64749	he	1765	" to launch ourselves straight at Twala 's throat . Incubu , the great warrior - for to - day he fought like a buffalo in a net , and Twala 's soldiers went down before his axe like young corn before the hail ; with these eyes I saw it - Incubu says ' Charge ' ; but the Elephant is ever prone to charge . Now what says Macumazahn , the wily old fox , who has seen much , and loves to bite his enemy from behind ? The last word is in Ignosi the king , for it is a king 's right to speak of war ; but let us hear thy voice , O Macumazahn , who watchest by night , and the voice too of him of the transparent eye .

I will strike at Twala this day , and set my fortunes on the blow , ay , and my life - my life and your lives also . Listen ; thus will I strike . Ye see how the hill curves round like the half - moon , and how the plain runs like a green tongue towards us within the curve ? "

65317	65525	65212	65212	he	169	" Good ; it is now mid - day , and the men eat and rest after the toil of battle . When the sun has turned and travelled a little way towards the darkness , let thy regiment , my uncle , advance with one other down to the green tongue , and it shall be that when Twala sees it he will hurl his force at it to crush it . But the spot is narrow , and the regiments can come against thee one at a time only ; so may they be destroyed one by one , and the eyes of all Twala 's army shall be fixed upon a struggle the like of which has not been seen by living man . And with thee , my uncle , shall go Incubu my friend , that when Twala sees his battle - axe flashing in the first rank of the Greys his heart may grow faint . And I will come with the second regiment , that which follows thee , so that if ye are destroyed , as it might happen , there may yet be a king left to fight for ; and with me shall come Macumazahn the wise .

And when I see that the horns are ready to toss Twala , then will I , with the men who remain to me , charge home in Twala 's face , and if fortune goes with us the day will be ours , and before Night drives her black oxen from the mountains to the mountains we shall sit in peace at Loo . And now let us eat and make ready ; and , Infadoos , do thou prepare , that the plan be carried out without fail ; and stay , let my white father Bougwan go with the right horn , that his shining eye may give courage to the captains .

Well , so be it ; at any rate , it will be a man 's death . Good - bye , old fellow . God bless you !

It is there that the three great figures sit , who here are called the ' Silent Ones , ' and to whom Twala would have offered the girl Foulata as a sacrifice . It is there , too , in a great cave deep in the mountain , that the kings of the land are buried ; there ye shall find Twala 's body , sitting with those who went before him . There , also , is a deep pit , which , at some time , long - dead men dug out , mayhap for the stones ye speak of , such as I have heard men in Natal tell of at Kimberley . There , too , in the Place of Death is a secret chamber , known to none but the king and Gagool . But Twala , who knew it , is dead , and I know it not , nor know I what is in it . Yet there is a legend in the land that once , many generations gone , a white man crossed the mountains , and was led by a woman to the secret chamber and shown the wealth hidden in it . But before he could take it she betrayed him , and he was driven by the king of that day back to the mountains , and since then no man has entered the place . "

77203	77225	77150	77150	she	122	" Listen ; I will this of thee , that thou reveal to us the chamber where are the shining stones . "
77226	77231	77232	77232	she	122	" Ha ! ha ! "
77235	77260	77232	77232	she	122	" none know its secret but I , and I will never tell thee . The white devils shall go hence empty - handed . "

But the old feel not , they love not , and , ha ! ha ! they laugh to see another go out into the dark ; ha ! ha ! they laugh to see the evil that is done under the stars .

The bright stones that ye will see were dug out of the pit over which the Silent Ones are set , and stored here , I know not by whom , for that was done longer ago than even I remember . But once has this place been entered since the time that those who hid the stones departed in haste , leaving them behind . The report of the treasure went down indeed among the people who lived in the country from age to age , but none knew where the chamber was , nor the secret of the door . But it happened that a white man reached this country from over the mountains - perchance he too came ' from the Stars ' - and was well received by the king of that day . He it is who sits yonder , "

Then the white man entered with the woman , and found the stones , and filled with stones the skin of a small goat , which the woman had with her to hold food . And as he was going from the chamber he took up one more stone , a large one , and held it in his hand . "

Ha ! ha ! mine are true words . "

Even if he found the door he could not break it down . All the Kukuana army could not break through five feet of living rock . My friends , I see nothing for it but to bow ourselves to the will of the Almighty . The search for treasure has brought many to a bad end ; we shall go to swell their number . "

She would have let you die in the dark place , and mayhap afterwards she had found a way to slay me , as she found a way to slay my father , and set up Twala , whom her black heart loved , in his place . Now go on with the tale ; surely there never was its like ! "

Behold , Ignosi , thou camest with us a servant , and now we leave thee a mighty king . If thou art grateful to us , remember to do even as thou didst promise : to rule justly , to respect the law , and to put none to death without a cause . So shalt thou prosper . To - morrow , at break of day , Ignosi , thou wilt give us an escort who shall lead us across the mountains . Is it not so , O king ? "

93882	94051	93877	93877	he	169	" your words split my heart in twain . What have I done to you , Incubu , Macumazahn , and Bougwan , that ye should leave me desolate ? Ye who stood by me in rebellion and in battle , will ye leave me in the day of peace and victory ? What will ye - wives ? Choose from among the maidens ! A place to live in ? Behold , the land is yours as far as ye can see . The white man 's houses ? Ye shall teach my people how to build them . Cattle for beef and milk ? Every married man shall bring you an ox or a cow . Wild game to hunt ? Does not the elephant walk through my forests , and the river - horse sleep in the reeds ? Would ye make war ? My Impis wait your word . If there is anything more which I can give , that will I give you . "
94052	94064	94065	94065	I	0	" Nay , Ignosi , we want none of these things , "
94068	94076	94065	94065	I	0	" we would seek our own place . "

94093	94191	94085	94085	Ignosi	169	" that ye love the bright stones more than me , your friend . Ye have the stones ; now ye would go to Natal and across the moving black water and sell them , and be rich , as it is the desire of a white man 's heart to be . Cursed for your sake be the white stones , and cursed he who seeks them . Death shall it be to him who sets foot in the place of Death to find them . I have spoken . White men , ye can go . "

94207	94265	94204	94204	I	0	" tell us , when thou didst wander in Zululand , and among the white people of Natal , did not thine heart turn to the land thy mother told thee of , thy native place , where thou didst see the light , and play when thou wast little , the land where thy place was ? "

94313	94398	94194	94194	my	0	" I do perceive that now as ever thy words are wise and full of reason , Macumazahn ; that which flies in the air loves not to run along the ground ; the white man loves not to live on the level of the black or to house among his kraals . Well , ye must go , and leave my heart sore , because ye will be as dead to me , since from where ye are no tidings can come to me .
94399	94650	94194	94194	my	0	" But listen , and let all your brothers know my words . No other white man shall cross the mountains , even if any man live to come so far . I will see no traders with their guns and gin . My people shall fight with the spear , and drink water , like their forefathers before them . I will have no praying - men to put a fear of death into men 's hearts , to stir them up against the law of the king , and make a path for the white folk who follow to run on . If a white man comes to my gates I will send him back ; if a hundred come I will push them back ; if armies come , I will make war on them with all my strength , and they shall not prevail against me . None shall ever seek for the shining stones : no , not an army , for if they come I will send a regiment and fill up the pit , and break down the white columns in the caves and choke them with rocks , so that none can reach even to that door of which ye speak , and whereof the way to move it is lost . But for you three , Incubu , Macumazahn , and Bougwan , the path is always open ; for , behold , ye are dearer to me than aught that breathes .
94651	94752	94955	94955	he	169	" And ye would go . Infadoos , my uncle , and my Induna , shall take you by the hand and guide you with a regiment . There is , as I have learned , another way across the mountains that he shall show you . Farewell , my brothers , brave white men . See me no more , for I have no heart to bear it . Behold ! I make a decree , and it shall be published from the mountains to the mountains ; your names , Incubu , Macumazahn , and Bougwan , shall be "
94754	94783	94955	94955	he	169	" even as the names of dead kings , and he who speaks them shall die . 1 So shall your memory be preserved in the land for ever .
94784	94941	94955	94955	he	169	" Go now , ere my eyes rain tears like a woman 's . At times as ye look back down the path of life , or when ye are old and gather yourselves together to crouch before the fire , because for you the sun has no more heat , ye will think of how we stood shoulder to shoulder , in that great battle which thy wise words planned , Macumazahn ; of how thou wast the point of the horn that galled Twala 's flank , Bougwan ; whilst thou stood in the ring of the Greys , Incubu , and men went down before thine axe like corn before a sickle ; ay , and of how thou didst break that wild bull Twala 's strength , and bring his pride to dust . Fare ye well for ever , Incubu , Macumazahn , and Bougwan , my lords and my friends . "
95175	95179	95180	95180	he	2484	" Speak on , "

Only last night we settled that Jim should leave me , and try to reach Sitanda 's Kraal to get assistance . He was to go to - morrow , but I had little hope of ever seeing him back again . And now you , of all people in the world , you , who , as I fancied , had long ago forgotten all about me , and were living comfortably in old England , turn up in a promiscuous way and find me where you least expected . It is the most wonderful thing that I have ever heard of , and the most merciful too . "
