It is the solid core that underlies every Christian creed which is of importance . Could you but live among the Romans or the Greeks , in the days before this new doctrine was preached , you would then know the change that it has wrought in the world . How this or that text should be construed is a matter of no moment , however warm men may get over it . What is of the very greatest moment is , that every man should have a good and solid reason for living a simple , cleanly life . This the Christian creed has given us . '

There is always some penalty in health , in comfort , or in peace of mind to be paid for every wrong . It is with nations as it is with individuals . A book of history is a book of sermons . See how the luxurious Babylonians were destroyed by the frugal Persians , and how these same Persians when they learned the vices of prosperity were put to the sword by the Greeks . Read on and mark how the sensual Greeks were trodden down by the more robust and hardier Romans , and finally how the Romans , having lost their manly virtues , were subdued by the nations of the north . Vice and destruction came ever hand in hand . Thus did Providence use each in turn as a scourge wherewith to chastise the follies of the other . These things do not come by chance . They are part of a great system which is at work in your own lives . The longer you live the more you will see that sin and sadness are never far apart , and that no true prosperity can exist away from virtue . '

It is necessary that a cavaliero of fortune , being for the greater part a stranger in a strange land , should be somewhat nice in matters of the sort , since he stands , as it were , as the representative of his country , whose good name should be more dear to him than his own .

I speak with all due modesty , but with backsword , sword and dagger , sword and buckler , single falchion , case of falchions , or any other such exercise , I will hold mine own against any man that ever wore neat 's leather , save only my elder brother Quartus .

He was a hard one both at praying and at fighting . We have ridden knee to knee in the field , and we have sought truth together in the chamber . So , Dick will be in harness once again ! He could not be still if a blow were to be struck for the trampled faith . If the tide of war set in this direction , I too -- who knows ? who knows ? '
18089	18101	18103	18103	Saxon	551	' And here is a stout man - at - arms , '
18112	18155	18103	18103	Saxon	551	' He hath thew and sinew , and can use proud words too upon occasion , as I have good cause to know , even in our short acquaintance . Might it not be that he too should strike in this quarrel ? '

18177	18217	18173	18173	his	1134	' But I pray you , friend Saxon , to give us some further account upon these matters . My son Micah , as I understand , hath picked you out of the waves . How came you there ? '
18244	18252	18253	18253	he	551	' It came about in this wise , '
18258	18470	18253	18253	he	551	' When John of Poland chased the Turk from the gates of Vienna , peace broke out in the Principalities , and many a wandering cavaliero like myself found his occupation gone . There was no war waging save only some petty Italian skirmish , in which a soldier could scarce expect to reap either dollars or repute , so I wandered across the Continent , much cast down at the strange peace which prevailed in every quarter . At last , however , on reaching the Lowlands , I chanced to hear that the _ Providence _ , owned and commanded by my two brothers , Nonus and Quartus , was about to start from Amsterdam for an adventure to the Guinea coast . I proposed to them that I should join them , and was accordingly taken into partnership on condition that I paid one - third of the cost of the cargo . While waiting at the port I chanced to come across some of the exiles , who , having heard of my devotion to the Protestant cause , brought me to the Duke and to Master Rumbold , who committed these letters to my charge . This makes it clear how they came into my possession . '
18471	18483	18484	18485	my father	1134	' But not how you and they came into the water , '
18488	18498	18499	18500	the adventurer	1863	' Why , that was but the veriest chance , '
18509	18859	18499	18500	the adventurer	1863	' It was the _ fortuna belli _ , or more properly _ pacis _ . I had asked my brothers to put into Portsmouth that I might get rid of these letters , on which they replied in a boorish and unmannerly fashion that they were still waiting for the thousand guineas which represented my share of the venture . To this I answered with brotherly familiarity that it was a small thing , and should be paid for out of the profits of our enterprise . Their reply was I that I had promised to pay the money down , and that money down they must have . I then proceeded to prove , both by the Aristotelian and by the Platonic or deductive method , that having no guineas in my possession it was impossible for me to produce a thousand of them , at the same time pointing out that the association of an honest man in the business was in itself an ample return for the money , since their own reputations had been somewhat blown on . I further offered in the same frank and friendly spirit to meet either of them with sword or with pistol , a proposal which should have satisfied any honour - loving Cavaliero . Their base mercantile souls prompted them , however , to catch up two muskets , one of which Nonus discharged at me , and it is likely that Quartus would have followed suit had I not plucked the gun from his hand and unloaded it to prevent further mischief . In unloading it I fear that one of the slugs blew a hole in brother Nonus . Seeing that there was a chance of further disagreements aboard the vessel , I at once decided to leave her , in doing which I was forced to kick off my beautiful jack - boots , which were said by Vanseddars himself to be he finest pair that ever went out of his shop , square - toed , double - soled -- alas ! alas !

Know , then , that the bearer of papers of import , _ documenta preciosa sed periculosa _ , is bound to leave nought to chance , but to guard in every way the charge which hath been committed to him . True it is that I am in the house of an honest man , but I know not who may come or who may go during the hours of the night . Indeed , for the matter of that -- but enough is said .

So faithful was he -- faithful even to slaying -- that when the army of the righteous dispersed , he did not lay aside his zeal with his buff - coat . He took to business as a maltster at Hoddesdon , and in his house was planned the famous Rye House Plot , in which so many good men were involved . '

20310	20406	20407	20407	He	1893	' Nay , nay , be not led away by terms ! It is a vile invention of the malignants that these men planned assassination . What they would do they purposed doing in broad daylight , thirty of them against fifty of the Royal Guard , when Charles and James passed on their way to Newmarket . If the royal brothers got pistol - bullet or sword - stab , it would be in open fight , and at the risk of their attackers . It was give and take , and no murder . '

There he found that many enemies of the Government had gathered together . Repeated messages from England , especially from the western counties and from London , assured them that if they would but attempt an invasion they might rely upon help both in men and in money . They were , however , at fault for some time for want of a leader of sufficient weight to carry through so large a project ; but now at last they have one , who is the best that could have been singled out -- none other than the well - beloved Protestant chieftain James , Duke of Monnmouth , son of Charles II .

Bastard or no , he holds the sound principles of the true Church , and he is beloved by the people . Let him appear in the West , and soldiers will rise up like the flowers in the spring time . '

The Duke of Argyle is to command a separate expedition , which will set the Highlands of Scotland in a blaze . Between them they hope to bring the persecutor of the faithful on his knees . But I hear the voice of the man Saxon , and I must not let him say that I have treated him in a churlish fashion . Here is the letter , lad . Read it with care , and remember that when brave men are striving for their rights it is fitting that one of the old rebel house of Clarke should be among them . '
20909	20988	20900	20900	I	0	' To my friend and companion in the cause of the Lord , Joseph Clarke.--Know , friend , that aid and delivery is coming upon Israel , and that the wicked king and those who uphold him shall be smitten and entirely cast down , until their place in the land shall know them no more . Hasten , then , to testify to thy own faith , that in the day of trouble ye be not found wanting .
20989	21139	20900	20900	I	0	' It has chanced from time to time that many of the suffering Church , both from our own land and from among the Scots , have assembled in this good Lutheran town of Amsterdam , until enough are gathered together to take a good work in hand . For amongst our own folk there are my Lord Grey of Wark , Wade , Dare of Taunton , Ayloffe , Holmes , Hollis , Goodenough , and others whom thou shalt know . Of the Scots there are the Duke of Argyle , who has suffered sorely for the Covenant , Sir Patrick Hume , Fletcher of Saltoun , Sir John Cochrane , Dr. Ferguson , Major Elphinstone , and others . To these we would fain have added Locke and old Hal Ludlow , but they are , as those of the Laodicean Church , neither cold nor warm .
21140	21338	20900	20900	I	0	' It has now come to pass , however , that Monmouth , who has long lived in dalliance with the Midianitish woman known by the name of Wentworth , has at last turned him to higher things , and has consented to make a bid for the crown . It was found that the Scots preferred to follow a chieftain of their own , and it has therefore been determined that Argyle -- M'Callum More , as the breechless savages of Inverary call him -- shall command a separate expedition landing upon the western coast of Scotland . There he hopes to raise five thousand Campbells , and to be joined by all the Covenanters and Western Whigs , men who would make troops of the old breed had they but God - fearing officers with an experience of the chance of fields and the usages of war . With such a following he should be able to hold Glasgow , and to draw away the King 's force to the north . Ayloffe and I go with Argyle . It is likely that our feet may be upon Scottish ground before thy eyes read these words .
21339	21664	21791	21791	him	1134	' The stronger expedition starts with Monmouth , and lands at a fitting place in the West , where we are assured that we have many friends . I can not name the spot lest this letter miscarry , but thou shalt hear anon . I have written to all good men along the coast , bidding them to be prepared to support the rising . The King is weak , and hated by the greater part of his subjects . It doth but need one good stroke to bring his crown in the dust . Monmouth will start in a few weeks , when his equipment is finished and the weather favourable . If thou canst come , mine old comrade , I know well that thou wilt need no bidding of mine to bring thee to our banner . Should perchance a peaceful life and waning strength forbid thy attendance , I trust that thou wilt wrestle for us in prayer , even as the holy prophet of old ; and perchance , since I hear that thou hast prospered according to the things of this world , thou mayst be able to fit out a pikeman or two , or to send a gift towards the military chest , which will be none too plentifully lined . We trust not to gold , but to steel and to our own good cause , yet gold will be welcome none the less . Should we fall , we fall like men and Christians . Should we succeed , we shall see how the perjured James , the persecutor of the saints with the heart like a nether millstone , the man who smiled when the thumbs of the faithful were wrenched out of their sockets at Edinburgh -- we shall see how manfully he can bear adversity when it falls to his lot . May the hand of the Almighty be over us !

Should an end be put to James 's rule , it is not too late to preserve the nation in its old faith ; but if the disease is allowed to spread , it may be that even the tyrant 's removal would not prevent his evil seed from sprouting . I hold , therefore , that should the exiles make such an attempt , it is the duty of every man who values liberty of conscience to rally round them . And you , my son , the pride of the village , what better use could you make of your strength than to devote it to helping to relieve your country of this insupportable yoke ? It is treasonable and dangerous counsel -- counsel which might lead to a short shrift and a bloody death -- but , as the Lord liveth , if you were child of mine I should say the same . '

When , at the battle of Senlac , William the Norman ordered his men to feign flight in order that they might break his enemy 's array , a wile much practised both by the Scythians of old and by the Croats of our own day , pray what is it but the acting of a lie ? Or when Hannibal , having tied torches to the horns of great droves of oxen , caused the Roman Consuls to imagine that his army was in retreat , was it not a deception or infraction of the truth?--a point well brought out by a soldier of repute in the treatise " An in bello dolo uti liceat ; an apud hostes falsiloquio uti liceat . " And so if , after these great models , I in order to gain mine ends do announce that we are bound to Beaufort when we are in truth making for Monmouth , is it not in accord with the usages of war and the customs of great commanders ?

Did it not happen in my own case that , on the eve of the raising of the Anlagerung of Vienna , we stranger officers having been invited to the tent of the General , it chanced that a red - headed Irisher , one O'Daffy , an ancient in the regiment of Pappenheimer , did claim precedence of me on the ground of superiority of blood ? On this I drew my glove across his face , not , mark ye , in anger , but as showing that I differed in some degree from his opinion . At which dissent he did at once offer to sustain his contention , but I , having read this subsection to him , did make it clear to him that we could not in honour settle the point until the Turk was chased from the city .

Let us now bow down and implore the favour of the Almighty upon this expedition . '

A plaguy good precept , which has stood me in excellent stead before now . I can not bear in mind whether I told you how I was at one time taken prisoner by the Turks and conveyed to Stamboul . There were a hundred of us or more , but the others either perished under the bastinado , or are to this day chained to an oar in the Imperial Ottoman galleys , where they are like to remain until they die under the lash , or until some Venetian or Genoese bullet finds its way into their wretched carcasses . I alone came off with my freedom . '

29333	29404	29329	29329	he	2108	' for , seeing that their accursed religion is the blind side of these infidels , I did set myself to work upon it . To this end I observed the fashion in which our guard performed their morning and evening exercises , and having transformed my doublet into a praying cloth , I did imitate them , save only that I prayed at greater length and with more fervour . '
29405	29408	29409	29409	I	0	' What ! '
29414	29423	29409	29409	I	0	' You did pretend to be a Mussulman ? '
29424	29475	29329	29329	he	2108	' Nay , there was no pretence . I became a Mussulman . That , however , betwixt ourselves , as it might not stand me in very good stead with some Reverend Aminadab Fount - of - Grace in the rebel camp , who is no admirer of Mahmoud . '
29527	29592	29513	29514	Decimus Saxon	551	' My perseverance in these exercises soon led to my being singled out from among the other prisoners , until I so prevailed upon my gaolers that the doors were opened for me , and I was allowed out on condition of presenting myself at the prison gates once a day . What use , think ye , did I make of my freedom ? '
29593	29602	29604	29604	I.	0	' Nay , you are capable of anything , '
29605	29850	29513	29514	Decimus Saxon	551	' I set off forthwith to their chief mosque -- that of St. Sophia . When the doors opened and the muezzin called , I was ever the first to hurry into devotions and the last to leave them . Did I see a Mussulman strike his head upon the pavement , I would strike mine twice . Did I see him bend and bow , I was ready to prostrate myself . In this way ere long the piety of the converted Giaour became the talk of the city , and I was provided with a hut in which to make my sacred meditations . Here I might have done well , and indeed I had well - nigh made up my mind to set up as a prophet and write an extra chapter to the Koran , when some foolish trifle made the faithful suspicious of my honesty . It was but some nonsense of a wench being found in my hut by some who came to consult me upon a point of faith , but it was enough to set their heathen tongues wagging ; so I thought it wisest to give them the slip in a Levantine coaster and leave the Koran uncompleted . It is perhaps as well , for it would be a sore trial to have to give up Christian women and pork , for their garlic - breathing houris and accursed kybobs of sheep 's flesh . '
29887	30007	29513	29514	Decimus Saxon	551	' hoofs did but make a dull subdued rattle , which was no bar to our talk -- or rather to my companion 's , for I did little more than listen . In truth , my mind was so full of anticipations of what was before us , and of thoughts of the home behind , that I was in no humour for sprightly chatter . The sky was somewhat clouded , but the moon glinted out between the rifts , showing us the long road which wound away in front of us . On either side were scattered houses with gardens sloping down toward the road . The heavy , sickly scent of strawberries was in the air .

The breadth of the view , the keenness of the air , and the novelty of the sense of having great work to do , all combined to send a flush of life through my veins such as the quiet village existence had never been able to give .

Suppose he can raise five thousand men -- and he can not stir with less -- he will not have one musket in five , so the rest must do as they can with pikes and bills , or such other rude arms as they can find .

You can tell what the one is after , but the other will invent a system of his own which will serve his turn for the nonce . Ober - hauptmann Muller was reckoned to be the finest player at the small - sword in the Kaiser 's army , and could for a wager snick any button from an opponent 's vest without cutting the cloth . Yet was he slain in an encounter with Fahnfuhrer Zollner , who was a cornet in our own Pandour corps , and who knew as much of the rapier as you do of horsemanship . For the rapier , be it understood , is designed to thrust and not to cut , so that no man wielding it ever thinks of guarding a side - stroke . But Zollner , being a long - armed man , smote his antagonist across the face with his weapon as though it had been a cane , and then , ere he had time to recover himself , fairly pinked him . Doubtless if the matter were to do again , the Oberhauptmann would have got his thrust in sooner , but as it was , no explanation or excuse could get over the fact that the man was dead . '

To continue my story , however , which I broke off in order to step down from my horse , I found out early in the morning that ye were gone , and Zachary Palmer was able to tell me whither . I made up my mind , therefore , that I would out into the world also . To this end I borrowed a sword from Solomon Sprent , and my father having gone to Gosport , I helped myself to the best nag in his stables -- for I have too much respect for the old man to allow one of his flesh and blood to go ill - provided to the wars . All day I have ridden , since early morning , being twice stopped on suspicion of being ill - affected , but having the good luck to get away each time .

45680	45769	45678	45678	he	676	' Meanwhile , this odour may be offensive to your untrained nostrils , so we shall away with it . He threw a few grains of some balsamic resin into the brazier , which at once filled the chamber with a most agreeable perfume . He then laid a white cloth upon the table , and taking from a cupboard a dish of cold trout and a large meat pasty , he placed them upon it , and invited us to draw up our settles and set to work .
45770	45783	45785	45785	he	676	' I would that I had more toothsome fare to offer ye , '
45787	45836	45785	45785	he	676	' Were we at Snellaby Hall , ye should not be put off in this scurvy fashion , I promise ye . This may serve , however , for hungry men , and I can still lay my hands upon a brace of bottles of the old Alicant . '

I would I could pay mine own debts with these same promises . '
46201	46211	46212	46213	our host	2395	' I should judge from your speech , sir , '
46216	46249	46212	46213	our host	2395	' that you are not one of the sectaries . How comes it , then , that you are throwing the weight of your sword and your experience into the weaker scale ? '

Since I must be doing something , I choose to fight for Protestantism and Monmouth . It is nothing to me whether James Stuart or James Walters sits upon the throne , but the court and army of the King are already made up . Now , since Monmouth hath both courtiers and soldiers to find , it may well happen that he may be glad of my services and reward them with honourable preferment . '

Had I not a mission here which can not be neglected , I might myself be tempted to hie westward with ye , and put these grey hairs of mine once more into the rough clasp of a steel headpiece . For where now is the noble castle of Snellaby , and where those glades and woods amidst which the Clancings have grown up , and lived and died , ere ever Norman William set his foot on English soil ? A man of trade -- a man who , by the sweat of his half - starved workers , had laid by ill - gotten wealth , is now the owner of all that fair property . Should I , the last of the Clancings , show my face upon it , I might be handed over to the village beadle as a trespasser , or scourged off it perhaps by the bowstrings of insolent huntsmen . '

46778	47157	46767	46769	the old man	1659	' Here 's a toast for you ! Perdition to all faithless princes ! How came it about , ye ask ? Why , when the troubles came upon the first Charles , I stood by him as though he had been mine own brother . At Edgehill , at Naseby , in twenty skirmishes and battles , I fought stoutly in his cause , maintaining a troop of horse at my own expense , formed from among my own gardeners , grooms , and attendants . Then the military chest ran low , and money must be had to carry on the contest . My silver chargers and candlesticks were thrown into the melting - pot , as were those of many another cavalier . They went in metal and they came out as troopers and pikemen . So we tided over a few months until again the purse was empty , and again we filled it amongst us . This time it was the home farm and the oak trees that went . Then came Marston Moor , and every penny and man was needed to repair that great disaster . I flinched not , but gave everything . This boiler of soap , a prudent , fat - cheeked man , had kept himself free from civil broils , and had long had a covetous eye upon the castle . It was his ambition , poor worm , to be a gentleman , as though a gabled roof and a crumbling house could ever make him that . I let him have his way , however , and threw the sum received , every guinea of it , into the King 's coffers . And so I held out until the final ruin of Worcester , when I covered the retreat of the young prince , and may indeed say that save in the Isle of Man I was the last Royalist who upheld the authority of the crown . The Commonwealth had set a price upon my head as a dangerous malignant , so I was forced to take my passage in a Harwich ketch , and arrived in the Lowlands with nothing save my sword and a few broad pieces in my pocket . '
47158	47167	47169	47169	Saxon	551	' A cavalier might do well even then , '
47171	47214	47169	47169	Saxon	551	' There are ever wars in Germany where a man is worth his hire . When the North Germans are not in arms against the Swedes or French , the South Germans are sure to be having a turn with the janissaries . '
47215	47274	47275	47276	Fore God	469	' I did indeed take arms for a time in the employ of the United Provinces , by which means I came face to face once more with mine old foes , the Roundheads . Oliver had lent Reynolds 's brigade to the French , and right glad was Louis to have the service of such seasoned troops . '
47454	47454	47441	47441	I	0	'
47455	47458	47460	47460	Saxon	551	' Truly , '
47462	47507	47460	47460	Saxon	551	' there seemeth to be some fatal attraction in this same chemistry , for we met two officers of the Blue Guards in Salisbury , who , though they were stout soldierly men in other respects , had also a weakness in that direction . '
47508	47511	47513	47514	Sir Jacob	676	' Ha ! '
47519	47527	47513	47514	Sir Jacob	676	' To what school did they belong ? '
47528	47538	47539	47539	Saxon	551	' Nay , I know nothing of the matter , '
47542	47567	47539	47539	Saxon	551	' save that they denied that Gervinus of Nurnberg , whom I guarded in prison , or any other man , could transmute metals . '
47568	47576	47578	47579	our host	2395	' For Gervinus I can not answer , '
47581	47978	47578	47579	our host	2395	' but for the possibility of it I can pledge my knightly word . However , of that anon . The time came at last when the second Charles was invited back to his throne , and all of us , from Jeffrey Hudson , the court dwarf , up to my Lord Clarendon , were in high feather at the hope of regaining our own once more . For my own claim , I let it stand for some time , thinking that it would be a more graceful act for the King to help a poor cavalier who had ruined himself for the sake of his family without solicitation on his part . I waited and waited , but no word came , so at last I betook myself to the levee and was duly presented to him . " Ah , " said he , greeting me with the cordiality which he could assume so well , " you are , if I mistake not , Sir Jasper Killigrew ? " " Nay , your Majesty , " I answered , " I am Sir Jacob Clancing , formerly of Snellaby Hall , in Staffordshire ; " and with that I reminded him of Worcester fight and of many passages which had occurred to us in common . " Od 's fish ! " he cried , " how could I be so forgetful ! And how are all at Snellaby ? " I then explained to him that the Hall had passed out of my hands , and told him in a few words the state to which I had been reduced . His face clouded over and his manner chilled to me at once . " They are all on to me for money and for places , " he said , " and truly the Commons are so niggardly to me that I can scarce be generous to others . However , Sir Jacob , we shall see what can be done for thee , " and with that he dismissed me . That same night the secretary of my Lord Clarendon came to me , and announced with much form and show that , in consideration of my long devotion and the losses which I had sustained , the King was graciously pleased to make me a lottery cavalier . '
47979	47991	47992	47992	I	0	' And pray , sir , what is a lottery cavalier ? '
47995	48093	47578	47579	our host	2395	' It is nothing else than a licensed keeper of a gambling - house . This was his reward to me . I was to be allowed to have a den in the piazza of Covent Garden , and there to decoy the young sparks of the town and fleece them at ombre . To restore my own fortunes I was to ruin others . My honour , my family , my reputation , they were all to weigh for nothing so long as I had the means of bubbling a few fools out of their guineas . '
48094	48107	48109	48109	Saxon	551	' I have heard that some of the lottery cavaliers did well , '
48112	48305	48109	48109	Saxon	551	' Well or ill , it way no employment for me . I waited upon the King and implored that his bounty would take another form . His only reply was that for one so poor I was strangely fastidious . For weeks I hung about the court -- I and other poor cavaliers like myself , watching the royal brothers squandering upon their gaming and their harlots sums which would have restored us to our patrimonies . I have seen Charles put upon one turn of a card as much as would have satisfied the most exacting of us . In the parks of St. James , or in the Gallery at Whitehall , I still endeavoured to keep myself before his eyes , in the hope that some provision would be made for me . At last I received a second message from him . It was that unless I could dress more in the mode he could dispense with my attendance . That was his message to the old broken soldier who had sacrificed health , wealth , position , everything in the service of his father and himself . '
48306	48309	48310	48310	we	2418	' Shameful ! '
48316	48368	48109	48109	Saxon	551	' Can you wonder , then , that I cursed the whole Stuart race , false - hearted , lecherous , and cruel ? For the Hall , I could buy it back to - morrow if I chose , but why should I do so when I have no heir ? '

48478	48493	48475	48475	I	0	' did declare to us that it was but a superstition of the vulgar . '
48494	48597	48455	48456	Sir Jacob	676	' Then these officers did show that their knowledge was less than their prejudice . Alexander Setonius , a Scot , was first of the moderns to achieve it . In the month of March 1602 he did change a bar of lead into gold in the house of a certain Hansen , at Rotterdam , who hath testified to it . He then not only repeated the same process before three learned men sent by the Kaiser Rudolph , but he taught Johann Wolfgang Dienheim of Freibourg , and Gustenhofer of Strasburg , which latter taught it to my own illustrious master-- '

For a man to enrich himself at it he must labour hard and long ; yet in the end I will not deny that he may compass it . And now , since the flasks are empty and your young comrade is nodding in his chair , it will perhaps be as well for you to spend as much of the night as is left in repose . '

It was but a glance at the contents , yet I could swear that that dull yellow light could come from no metal but gold . Let us see if it be indeed locked . '

Will was a rake - hell of Fleet Street in the days of James , a chosen light of Alsatia , the home of bullies and of brawlers . His blood hath through his daughter been transmitted to the ten of us , though I rejoice to say that I , being the tenth , it had by that time lost much of its virulence , and indeed amounts to little more than a proper pride , and a laudable desire to prosper .

51907	51918	51919	51919	I	0	' How , then , has it affected the race ? '

If my father did but drink a cup of small beer more than his wo nt , or did break out upon provocation into any fond oath , as " Od 's niggers ! " or " Heart alive ! " he would mourn over it as though it were the seven deadly sins . Was this a man , think ye , in the ordinary course of nature to beget ten long lanky children , nine of whom might have been first cousins of Lucifer , and foster - brothers of Beelzebub ? '
52054	52061	52063	52063	Reuben	751	' It was hard upon him , '
52065	52148	51926	51926	he	2452	' On him ! Nay , the hardship was all with us . If he with his eyes open chose to marry the daughter of an incarnate devil like Will Spotterbridge , because she chanced to be powdered and patched to his liking , what reason hath he for complaint ? It is we , who have the blood of this Hector of the taverns grafted upon our own good honest stream , who have most reason to lift up our voices . '
52149	52159	52161	52161	Reuben	751	' Faith , by the same chain of reasoning , '
52163	52192	52161	52161	Reuben	751	' one of my ancestors must have married a woman with a plaguy dry throat , for both my father and I are much troubled with the complaint . '

52207	52262	52205	52205	Saxon	551	' From what I have told you , you will see that our whole life is a conflict between our natural Saxon virtue and the ungodly impulses of the Spotterbridge taint . That of which you have had cause to complain yesternight is but an example of the evil to which I am subjected . '

52308	52314	52316	52316	Saxon	551	' They have all succumbed , '
52322	52720	52316	52316	Saxon	551	' Alas , alas ! they were a goodly company could they have turned their talents to better uses . Prima was our eldest born . She did well until she attained womanhood . Secundus was a stout seaman , and owned his own vessel when he was yet a young man . It was remarked , however , that he started on a voyage in a schooner and came back in a brig , which gave rise to some inquiry . It may be , as he said , that he found it drifting about in the North Sea , and abandoned his own vessel in favour of it , but they hung him before he could prove it . Tertia ran away with a north - country drover , and hath been on the run ever since . Quartus and Nonus have been long engaged in busying themselves over the rescue of the black folk from their own benighted and heathen country , conveying them over by the shipload to the plantations , where they may learn the beauties of the Christian religion . They are , however , men of violent temper and profane speech , who cherish no affection for their younger brother . Quintus was a lad of promise , but he found a hogshead of rumbo which was thrown up from a wreck , and he died soon afterwards . Sextus might have done well , for he became clerk to Johnny Tranter the attorney ; but he was of an enterprising turn , and he shifted the whole business , papers , cash , and all to the Lowlands , to the no small inconvenience of his employer , who hath never been able to lay hands either on one or the other from that day to this . Septimus died young . As to Octavius , Will Spotterbridge broke out early in him , and he was slain in a quarrel over some dice , which were said by his enemies to be so weighted that the six must ever come upwards . Let this moving recital be a warning to ye , if ye are fools enough to saddle yourselves with a wife , to see that she hath no vice in her , for a fair face is a sorry make - weight against a foul mind . '

52811	52902	52792	52792	Saxon	551	' Let us ride past it , for it is little out of our way . They are rare things in England , though by my faith there were more gallows than milestones when Turenne was in the Palatinate . What between the spies and traitors who were bred by the war , the rascally Schwartzritter and Lanzknechte , the Bohemian vagabonds , and an occasional countryman who was put out of the way lest he do something amiss , there was never such a brave time for the crows .

And here , come rain , come shine , shall I , his mother , sit while two bones hang together of the man who slow my heart 's darling . '

They are far distant , and what we see is but the sun shining on their casques ; yet they are bound for this very village , if I mistake not . It would be wisest to avoid entering it , lest the rustics set them upon our track . Let us skirt it and push on for Bruton , where we may spare time for bite and sup . '

We questioned many as to the news from the war , but though we were now on the outskirts of the disturbed country , we could gain no clear account of how matters stood , save that all agreed that the rising was on the increase . The country through which we rode was a beautiful one , consisting of low swelling hills , well tilled and watered by numerous streamlets . Crossing over the river Brue by a good stone bridge , we at last reached the small country town for which we had been making , which lies embowered in the midst of a broad expanse of fertile meadows , orchards , and sheep - walks . From the rising ground by the town we looked back over the plain without seeing any traces of the troopers . We learned , too , from an old woman of the place , that though a troop of the Wiltshire Yeomanry had passed through the day before , there were no soldiers quartered at present in the neighbourhood . Thus assured we rode boldly into the town , and soon found our way to the principal inn . I have some dim remembrance of an ancient church upon an eminence , and of a quaint stone cross within the market - place , but assuredly , of all the recollections which I retain of Bruton there is none so pleasing as that of the buxom landlady 's face , and of the steaming dishes which she lost no time in setting before us .

By the Lard ! I must , in applying for a place , give an account of my character and a list of my accomplishments . So my rascals ever did with me , though in good truth I seldom listened to their recital . Honesty -- there I score a trick . Sober -- Ananias himself could scarce say that I am that . Trustworthy -- indifferently so . Steady -- hum ! about as much so as Garraway 's weathercock . Hang it , man , I am choke full of good resolutions , but a sparkling glass or a roguish eye will deflect me , as the mariners say of the compass . So much for my weaknesses . Now let me see what qualifications I can produce . A steady nerve , save only when I have my morning qualms , and a cheerful heart ; I score two on that . I can dance saraband , minuet , or corranto ; fence , ride , and sing French chansons . Good Lard ! who ever heard a valet urge such accomplishments ? I can play the best game of piquet in London . So said Sir George Etherege when I won a cool thousand off him at the Groom Parter . But that wo n't advance me much , either . What is there , then , to commend me ? Why , marry , I can brew a bowl of punch , and I can broil a devilled fowl . It is not much , but I can do it well . '

There as a young lad I was presented at Court , and being a slim active youngster with a pert tongue and assured manner , I caught the notice of the Queen , who made me one of her pages of honour . This post I held until I grew out of it , when I withdrew from town , but egad ! I found I must get back to it again , for Beacham Ford Park was as dull as a monastery after the life which I had been living . In town I stayed then with such boon companions as Tommy Lawson , my Lord Halifax , Sir Jasper Lemarck , little Geordie Chichester , aye , and old Sidney Godolphin of the Treasury ; for with all his staid ways and long - winded budgets he could drain a cup with the best of us , and was as keen on a main of cocks as on a committee of ways and means . Well , it was rare sport while it lasted , and sink me if I would n't do the same again if I had my time once more . It is like sliding down a greased plank though , for at first a man goes slow enough , and thinks he can pull himself up , but presently he goes faster and faster , until he comes with a crash on to the rocks of ruin at the bottom .

Why , from Ormonde or Buckingham , with their twenty thousand , down to ranting Dicky Talbot , there was not one of my set who could not have bought me out . Yet I must have my coach and four , my town house , my liveried servants , and my stable full of horses . To be in the mode I must have my poet , and throw him a handful of guineas for his dedication . Well , poor devil , he is one who will miss me . I warrant his heart was as heavy as his verses when he found me gone , though perchance he has turned a few guineas by this time by writing a satire upon me . It would have a ready sale among my friends . Gad 's life ! I wonder how my levees get on , and whom all my suitors have fastened on to now .

But marriage , d'ye see , is a citadel that it is plaguy easy to find one 's way into , but once in old Tilly himself could not bring one out again with credit , I have known such a device on the Danube , where at the first onfall the Mamelukes have abandoned the breach for the very purpose of ensnaring the Imperial troops in the narrow streets beyond , from which few ever returned . Old birds are not caught with such wiles . I did succeed in gaining the ear of one of the gossips , and asking him what he could tell me of the good dame and her inn . It seemeth that she is somewhat of a shrew upon occasion , and that her tongue had more to do with her husband 's death than the dropsy which the leech put it down to . Again , a new inn hath been started in the village , which is well - managed , and is like to draw the custom from her . It is , too , as you have said , a dull sleepy spot . All these reasons weighed with me , and I decided that it would be best to raise my siege of the widow , and to retreat whilst I could yet do so with the credit and honours of war . '

As to this Sir Gervas , however , I think , as I said at the inn , that he hath more mettle in him than one would judge at first sight . These young sprigs of the gentry will always fight , but I doubt if he is hardened enough or hath constancy enough for such a campaign as this is like to be . His appearance , too , will be against him in the eyes of the saints ; and though Monmouth is a man of easy virtue , the saints are like to have the chief voice in his councils . Now do but look at him as he reins up that showy grey stallion and gazes back at us . Mark his riding - hat tilted over his eye , his open bosom , his whip dangling from his button - hole , his hand on his hip , and as many oaths in his mouth as there are ribbons to his doublet . Above all , mark the air with which he looks down upon the peasants beside him . He will have to change his style if he is to fight by the side of the fanatics . But hark ! I am much mistaken if they have not already got themselves into trouble . '

Thus our volley became the more terrifying since it was unexpected . I 'll wager there was not a man amongst them who did not feel that he had been led into a trap . Mark you how the rogues wheeled and fled with one accord , as though it had been part of their daily drill ! '

What more honest , simple - hearted fellow could you find , with no single soldierly virtue , save that he could put away more spruce beer than you would care to pay for . Yet if you do but cram him with a few strong , homely texts , place a pike in his hand , and give him a Gustavus to lead him , there is no infantry in the world that can stand against him . On the other hand , I have seen young Turks , untrained to arms , strike in on behalf of the Koran as lustily as these brave fellows behind us did for the Bible which Master Pettigrue held up in front of them .

71679	71998	71675	71676	Master Joshua	749	' They have there several , as I understand , from Holland , Brandenburg , and Scotland , who have been trained in arms , but who care so little for the cause which we uphold that they curse and swear in a manner that affrights the peasants , and threatens to call down a judgment upon the army . Others there are who cling close to the true faith , and have been born again among the righteous ; but alas ! they have had no experience of camps and fields . Our blessed Master can work by means of weak instruments , yet the fact remains that a man may be a chosen light in a pulpit , and yet be of little avail in an onslaught such as we have seen this day . I can myself arrange my discourse to the satisfaction of my flock , so that they grieve when the sand is run out ; ( Note E. Appendix ) but I am aware that this power would stand me in little stead when it came to the raising of barricades and the use of carnal weapons . In this way it comes about , in the army of the faithful , that those who are fit to lead are hateful to the people , while those to whose words the people will hearken know little of war . Now we have this day seen that you are ready of head and of hand , of much experience of battle , and yet of demure and sober life , full of yearnings after the word , and strivings against Apollyon . I therefore repeat that you shall be as a very Joshua amongst them , or as a Samson , destined to tear down the twin pillars of Prelacy and Popery , so as to bury this corrupt government in its fall .

72165	72197	72162	72163	our companion	7887	' I would fain hear the tale . I marvel much that one so faithful and unbending as thyself was ever let loose by the unclean and bloodthirsty followers of Mahomet . '

72231	72352	72210	72210	Saxon	551	' It is for my comrades in misfortune and not for me to describe what I endured for the faith . I have little doubt , Master Pettigrue , that you would have done as much had you been there . The town of Taunton lies very quiet beneath us , and there are few lights for so early an hour , seeing that it has not yet gone ten . It is clear that Monmouth 's forces have not reached it yet , else had there been some show of camp - fires in the valley ; for though it is warm enough to lie out in the open , the men must have fires to cook their victual .

72368	72429	72365	72366	the pastor	8562	' They have , I hear , been much delayed by the want of arms and by the need of discipline . Bethink ye , it was on the eleventh day of the month that Monmouth landed at Lyme , and it is now but the night of the fourteenth . There was much to be done in the time . '
72430	72435	72437	72439	the old soldier	2126	' Four whole days ! '
72441	72553	72437	72439	the old soldier	2126	' Yet I expected no better , seeing that they have , so far as I can hear , no tried soldiers amongst them . By my sword , Tilly or Wallenstein would not have taken four days to come from Lyme to Taunton , though all James Stuart 's cavalry barred the way . Great enterprises are not pushed through in this halting fashion . The blow should be sharp and sudden . But tell me , worthy sir , all that you know about the matter , for we have heard little upon the road save rumour and surmise . Was there not some fashion of onfall at Bridport ? '
72554	72759	72210	72210	Saxon	551	' There was indeed some shedding of blood at that place . The first two days were consumed , as I understand , in the enrolling of the faithful and the search for arms wherewith to equip them . You may well shake your head , for the hours were precious . At last five hundred men were broken into some sort of order , and marched along the coast under command of Lord Grey of Wark and Wade the lawyer . At Bridport they were opposed by the red Dorset militia and part of Portman 's yellow coats . If all be true that is said , neither side had much to boast of . Grey and his cavalry never tightened bridle until they were back in Lyme once more , though it is said their flight had more to do with the hard mouths of their horses than with the soft hearts of the riders . Wade and his footmen did bravely , and had the best of it against the King 's troops . There was much outcry against Grey in the camp , but Monmouth can scarce afford to be severe upon the only nobleman who hath joined his standard . '
72760	72763	72765	72765	Saxon	551	' Pshaw ! '
72768	72843	72765	72765	Saxon	551	' There was no great stock of noblemen in Cromwell 's army , I trow , and yet they held their own against the King , who had as many lords by him as there are haws in a thicket . If ye have the people on your side , why should ye crave for these bewigged fine gentlemen , whose white hands and delicate rapiers are of as much service as so many ladies '

72895	72974	72891	72892	Master Pettigrue	749	' What though he be clothed in a Joseph 's coat of many colours , and hath strange turns of speech ! No man could have fought more stoutly or shown a bolder front against the enemies of Israel . Surely the youth hath good in his heart , and will become a seat of grace and a vessel of the Spirit , though at present he be entangled in the net of worldly follies and carnal vanities . '
72975	72983	72985	72985	Saxon	551	' It is to be hoped so , '
72988	73003	72985	72985	Saxon	551	' And what else can you tell us of the revolt , worthy sir ? '
73004	73119	72891	72892	Master Pettigrue	749	' Very little , save that the peasants have flocked in in such numbers that many have had to be turned away for want of arms . Every tithing - man in Somersetshire is searching for axes and scythes . There is not a blacksmith but is at his forge from morn to night at work upon pike - heads . There are six thousand men of a sort in the camp , but not one in five carries a musket . They have advanced , I hear , upon Axminster , where they must meet the Duke of Albemarle , who hath set out from Exeter with four thousand of the train bands . '

When Feversham and Churchill come up with the King 's own troops , it is then that Monmouth takes the last spring , that lands him either on the throne or the scaffold . '

And you , sir , your musquetoon should be sloped upon your shoulder , and not borne under your arm like a dandy 's cane . Did ever an unhappy soldier find himself called upon to make order among so motley a crew ! Even my good friend the Fleming can not so avail here , nor does Petrinus , in his " De re militari , " lay down any injunctions as to the method of drilling a man who is armed with a sickle or a scythe .

But hark you , friends ! when we are in arms and the good work is to be done , on the march , in the field , or on parade , then let your bearing be strict , soldierly , and scrupulous , quick to hear and alert to obey , for I shall have no sluggards or laggards , and if there be any such my hand shall be heavy upon them , yea , even to the cutting of them off .

For we of Taunton have ever kept the flame of the Covenant burning amongst us , obscured it may be at times by time - servers and Laodiceans , but none the less burning in the hearts of our people . All round us , however , there was a worse than Egyptian darkness , where Popery and Prelacy , Arminianism , Erastianism , and Simony might rage and riot unchecked and unconfined . But what do I see now ? Do I see the faithful cowering in their hiding - places and straining their ears for the sound of the horsehoof 's of their oppressors ? Do I see a time - serving generation , with lies on their lips and truth buried in their hearts ? No ! I see before me godly men , not from this fair city only , but from the broad country round , and from Dorset , and from Wiltshire , and some even as I hear from Hampshire , all ready and eager to do mighty work in the cause of the Lord . And when I see these faithful men , and when I think that every broad piece in the strong boxes of my townsmen is ready to support them , and when I know that the persecuted remnant throughout the country is wrestling hard in prayer for us , then a voice speaks within me and tells me that we shall tear down the idols of Dagon , and build up in this England of ours such a temple of the true faith that not Popery , nor Prelacy , nor idolatry , nor any other device of the Evil One shall ever prevail against it .

In his great goodness and self - abnegation he had , in his early declaration given forth at Lyme , declared that he should leave the choice of a monarch to the Commons of England , but having found that his enemies did most scandalously and basely make use of this his self - denial , and did assert that he had so little confidence in his own cause that he dared not take publicly the title which is due to him , he hath determined that this should have an end . Know , therefore , that it is hereby proclaimed that James , Duke of Monmouth , is now and henceforth rightful King of England ; that James Stuart , the Papist and fratricide , is a wicked usurper , upon whose head , dead or alive , a price of five thousand guineas is affixed ; and that the assembly now sitting at Westminster , and calling itself the Commons of England , is an illegal assembly , and its acts are null and void in the sight of the law .

84114	84379	84110	84111	Sir Gervas	465	' A play of George Etherege 's , or a jingle of Sir John Suckling 's is lighter , though mayhap less wholesome food for the mind . A man in London may keep pace with the world of letters without much reading , for what with the gossip of the coffee - houses and the news - letters that fall in his way , and the babble of poets or wits at the assemblies , with mayhap an evening or two in the week at the playhouse , with Vanbrugh or Farquhar , one can never part company for long with the muses . Then , after the play , if a man is in no humour for a turn of luck at the green table at the Groom Porter 's , he may stroll down to the Coca Tree if he be a Tory , or to St. James 's if he be a Whig , and it is ten to one if the talk turn not upon the turning of alcaics , or the contest between blank verse or rhyme . Then one may , after an arriere supper , drop into Will 's or Slaughter 's and find Old John , with Tickell and Congreve and the rest of them , hard at work on the dramatic unities , or poetical justice , or some such matter . I confess that my own tastes lay little in that line , for about that hour I was likely to be worse employed with wine - flask , dice - box , or-- '

Surely no worthy man goes near those sinks of iniquity , the baited traps of the Evil One ? Has not the good and sanctified Master Bull declared from the pulpit that they are the gathering - place of the froward , the chosen haunts of the perverse Assyrians , as dangerous to the soul as any of those Papal steeple - houses wherein the creature is sacrilegiously confounded with the Creator ?

84680	84777	84676	84677	the Puritan	3231	' nor have I ever been in that great sewer which is called London . I trust , however , that I with others of the faithful may find our way thither with our tucks at our sides ere this business is finished , when we shall not be content , I 'll warrant , with shutting these homes of vice , as Cromwell did , but we shall not leave one stone upon another , and shall sow the spot with salt , that it may be a hissing and a byword amongst the people .

Touching these same playhouses , Colonel , when we have carried the upper hand this time , we shall not allow the old tares to check the new wheat . We know what fruit these places have borne in the days of Charles , the Gwynnes , the Palmers , and the whole base crew of foul lecherous parasites . Have you ever been in London , Captain Clarke ? '
84898	84910	84676	84677	the Puritan	3231	' Nay , sir ; I am country born and bred . '

84922	85229	84919	84920	our host	2395	' I have been there twice . The first time was in the days of the Rump , when Lambert brought in his division to overawe the Commons . I was then quartered at the sign of the Four Crosses in Southwark , then kept by a worthy man , one John Dolman , with whom I had much edifying speech concerning predestination . All was quiet and sober then , I promise you , and you might have walked from Westminster to the Tower in the dead of the night without hearing aught save the murmur of prayer and the chanting of hymns . Not a ruffler or a wench was in the streets after dark , nor any one save staid citizens upon their business , or the halberdiers of the watch . The second visit which I made was over this business of the levelling of the ramparts , when I and neighbour Foster , the glover , were sent at the head of a deputation from this town to the Privy Council of Charles . Who could have credited that a few years would have made such a change ? Every evil thing that had been stamped underground had spawned and festered until its vermin brood flooded the streets , and the godly wore themselves driven to shun the light of day . Apollyon had indeed triumphed for a while . A quiet man could not walk the highways without being elbowed into the kennel by swaggering swashbucklers , or accosted by painted hussies . Padders and michers , laced cloaks , jingling spurs , slashed boots , tall plumes , bullies and pimps , oaths and blasphemies -- I promise you hell was waxing fat . Even in the solitude of one 's coach one was not free from the robber . '
85230	85236	85238	85238	Reuben	751	' How that , sir ? '
85240	85398	84919	84920	our host	2395	' Why marry , in this wise . As I was the sufferer I have the best right to tell the tale . Ye must know that after our reception -- which was cold enough , for we were about as welcome to the Privy Council as the hearth - tax man is to the village housewife -- we were asked , more as I guess from derision than from courtesy , to the evening levee at Buckingham Palace . We would both fain have been excused from going but we feared that our refusal might give undue offence , and so hinder the success of our mission . My homespun garments ware somewhat rough for such an occasion , yet I determined to appear in them , with the addition of a new black baize waistcoat faced with silk , and a good periwig , for which I gave three pounds ten shillings in the Haymarket .

85444	85635	85441	85442	the Mayor	3126	' for , with all deference , Sir Gervas Jerome , a man 's own hair arranged with some taste , and with perhaps a sprinkling of powder , is to my mind the fittest ornament to his head . It is the contents and not the case which availeth . Having donned this frippery , good Master Foster and I hired a calash and drove to the Palace . We were deep in grave and , I trust , profitable converse speeding through the endless streets , when of a sudden I felt a sharp tug at my head , and my hat fluttered down on to my knees . I raised my hands , and lo ! they came upon my bare pate . The wig had vanished . We were rolling down Fleet Street at the moment , and there was no one in the calash save neighbour Foster , who sat as astounded as I. We looked high and low , on the seats and beneath them , but not a sign of the periwig was there . It was gone utterly and without a trace . '
85636	85640	85641	85641	we	3347	' Whither then ? '
85647	85922	85405	85405	his	3344	' That was the question which we set ourselves to solve . For a moment I do assure ye that we bethought us that it might be a judgment upon us for our attention to such carnal follies . Then it crossed my mind that it might be the doing of some malicious sprite , as the Drummer of Tedworth , or those who occasioned the disturbances no very long time since at the old Gast House at Little Burton here in Somersetshire . ( Note F. Appendix . ) With this thought we hallooed to the coachman , and told him what had occurred to us . The fellow came down from his perch , and having heard our story , he burst straightway into much foul language , and walking round to the back of his calash , showed us that a slit had been made in the leather wherewith it was fashioned . Through this the thief had thrust his hand and had drawn my wig through the hole , resting the while on the crossbar of the coach . It was no uncommon thing , he said , and the wig - snatchers were a numerous body who waited beside the peruke - maker 's shops , and when they saw a customer come forth with a purchase which was worth their pains they would follow him , and , should he chance to drive , deprive him of it in this fashion . Be that as it may , I never saw my wig again , and had to purchase another before I could venture into the royal presence . '
85923	85929	85931	85931	Saxon	810	' A strange adventure truly , '
85933	85946	85931	85931	Saxon	810	' How fared it with you for the remainder of the evening ? '
85947	86254	85405	85405	his	3344	' But scurvily , for Charles 's face , which was black enough at all times , was blackest of all to us ; nor was his brother the Papist more complaisant . They had but brought us there that they might dazzle us with their glitter and gee - gaws , in order that we might bear a fine report of them back to the West with us . There were supple - backed courtiers , and strutting nobles , and hussies with their shoulders bare , who should for all their high birth have been sent to Bridewell as readily as any poor girl who ever walked at the cart 's tail . Then there were the gentlemen of the chamber , with cinnamon and plum - coloured coats , and a brave show of gold lace and silk and ostrich feather . Neighbour Foster and I felt as two crows might do who have wandered among the peacocks . Yet we bare in mind in whose image we were fashioned , and we carried ourselves , I trust , as independent English burghers . His Grace of Buckingham had his flout at us , and Rochester sneered , and the women simpered ; but we stood four square , my friend and I , discussing , as I well remember , the most precious doctrines of election and reprobation , without giving much heed either to those who mocked us , or to the gamesters upon our left , or to the dancers upon our right . So we stood throughout the evening , until , finding that they could get little sport from us , my Lord Clarendon , the Chancellor , gave us the word to retire , which we did at our leisure after saluting the King and the company .

86281	86314	86267	86277	the young Puritan , who had listened intently to his elder	3348	' Would it not have been more fitting to have raised up your hands and called down vengeance upon them , as the holy man of old did upon the wicked cities ? '
86315	86321	86323	86324	the Mayor	3126	' More fitting , quotha ! '
86327	86423	86323	86324	the Mayor	3126	' It is most fitting that youth should be silent until his opinion is asked on such matters . God 's wrath comes with leaden feet , but it strikes with iron hands . In His own good time He has judged when the cup of these men 's iniquities is overflowing . It is not for us to instruct Him . Curses have , as the wise man said , a habit of coming home to roost . Bear that in mind , Master John Derrick , and be not too liberal with them . '
86454	86460	86462	86462	he	3126	' Being a fine night , '
86464	86689	86462	86462	he	3126	' we chose to walk back to our lodgings ; but never shall I forget the wicked scenes wherewith we were encountered on the way . Good Master Bunyan , of Elstow , might have added some pages to his account of Vanity Fair had he been with us . The women , be - patched , be - ruddled , and brazen ; the men swaggering , roistering , cursing -- the brawling , the drabbing , and the drunkenness ! It was a fit kingdom to be ruled over by such a court . At last we had made our way to more quiet streets , and were hoping that our adventures were at an end , when of a sudden there came a rush of half - drunken cavaliers from a side street , who set upon the passers - by with their swords , as though we had fallen into an ambuscade of savages in some Paynim country . They were , as I surmise , of the same breed as those of whom the excellent John Milton wrote : " The sons of Belial , flown with insolence and wine . " Alas ! my memory is not what it was , for at one time I could say by rote whole books of that noble and godly poem . '
86690	86704	86705	86705	I	0	' And , pray , how fared ye with these rufflers , sir ? '
86708	87154	86462	86462	he	3126	' They beset us , and some few other honest citizens who were wending their ways homewards , and waving their naked swords they called upon us to lay down our arms and pay homage . " To whom ? " I asked . They pointed to one of their number who was more gaudily dressed and somewhat drunker than the rest . " This is our most sovereign liege , " they cried . " Sovereign over whom ? " I asked . " Over the Tityre Tus , " they answered . " Oh , most barbarous and cuckoldy citizen , do you not recognise that you have fallen into the hands of that most noble order ? " " This is not your real monarch , " said I , " for he is down beneath us chained in the pit , where some day he will gather his dutiful subjects around him . " " Lo , he hath spoken treason ! " they cried , on which , without much more ado , they set upon us with sword and dagger . Neighbour Foster and I placed our backs against a wall , and with our cloaks round our left arms we made play with our tucks , and managed to put in one or two of the old Wigan Lane raspers . In particular , friend Foster pinked the King in such wise that his Majesty ran howling down the street like a gored bull - pup . We were beset by numbers , however , and might have ended our mission then and there had not the watch appeared upon the scene , struck up our weapons with their halberds , and so arrested the whole party . Whilst the fray lasted the burghers from the adjoining houses were pouring water upon us , as though we were cats on the tiles , which , though it did not cool our ardour in the fight , left us in a scurvy and unsavoury condition . In this guise we were dragged to the round - house , where we spent the night amidst bullies , thieves , and orange wenches , to whom I am proud to say that both neighbour Foster and myself spoke some words of joy and comfort . In the morning we were released , and forthwith shook the dust of London from our feet ; nor do I ever wish to return thither , unless it be at the head of our Somersetshire regiments , to see King Monmouth don the crown which he had wrested in fair fight from the Popish perverter .

87261	87343	87249	87250	the Mayor	3126	' William , do you bring a flask of the old green sealed sack . These creature comforts I do not produce before my lads , for beef and honest malt is the fittest food for such . On occasion , however , I am of Paul 's opinion , that a flagon of wine among friends is no bad thing for mind or for body . You can away now , sweetheart , if you have aught to engage you . '
87344	87351	87353	87354	Mistress Ruth	489	' Do you go out again ? '

87432	87513	87429	87430	the Mayor	3126	' There is not a want that is not supplied before it is felt . She reads my thoughts and acts upon them ere my lips have time to form them .

It cometh from Brooke and Hellier 's of Abchurch Lane , and may be relied upon . '

87544	87585	87538	87540	the old man	1659	' But what think ye of my young men , sir ? They must needs be of a very different class to any with whom you are acquainted , if , as I understand , you have frequented court circles . '
87586	87601	87602	87603	Sir Gervas	465	' Why , marry , they are good enough young men , no doubt , '
87607	87636	87602	87603	Sir Gervas	465	' Methinks , however , that there is a want of sap about them . It is not blood , but sour buttermilk that flows in their veins . '

87648	87740	87643	87644	the Mayor	3126	' There you do them an injustice . Their passions and feelings are under control , as the skilful rider keeps his horse in hand ; but they are as surely there as is the speed and endurance of the animal . Did you observe the godly youth who sat upon your right , whom I had occasion to reprove more than once for over - zeal ? He is a fit example of how a man may take the upper hand of his feelings , and keep them in control . '

87764	87917	87761	87762	the Mayor	3126	' it was but last Lady - day that he asked the hand of my granddaughter Ruth in marriage . His time is nearly served , and his father , Sam Derrick , is an honourable craftsman , so that the match would have been no unfitting one . The maiden turned against him , however -- young girls will have their fancies -- and the matter came to an end . Yet here he dwells under the same roof - tree , at her elbow from morn to night , with never a sign of that passion which can scarce have died out so soon . Twice my wool warehouse hath been nigh burned to the ground since then , and twice he hath headed those who fought the flames . There are not many whose suit hath been rejected who would bear themselves in so resigned and patient a fashion . '

All taken , you say ! It is a lesson and a warning to us . I tell you that unless Monmouth infuses more energy into his councils , and thrusts straight for the heart instead of fencing and foining at the extremities , we shall find ourselves as Argyle and Rumbold . What mean these two days wasted at Axminster at a time when every hour is of import ? Is he , every time that he brushes a party of militia aside , to stop forty - eight hours and chant " Te Deums " when Churchill and Feversham are , as I know , pushing for the West with every available man , and the Dutch grenadiers are swarming over like rats into a granary ?

93333	93447	93331	93331	Saxon	810	' I remember that after the leaguer of Salzburg , when we had taken the castle or fortalice of that name , we were joined by some thousand untrained foot , which had been raised in Dalmatia in the Emperor 's employ . As they approached our lines with waving of hands and blowing of bugles , old Marshal Hinterlassen discharged a volley of all the cannon upon the walls at them , killing three score and striking great panic into the others . " The rogues must get used to standing fire sooner or later , " said he , " so they may as well commence their education at once . " '

But as to the slow commanders , I have known none to equal Brigadier Baumgarten , also of the Imperial service . He would break up his winter - quarters and sit down before some place of strength , where he would raise a sconce here , and sink a sap there , until his soldiers were sick of the very sight of the place . So he would play with it , as a cat with a mouse , until at last it was about to open its gates , when , as like as not , he would raise the leaguer and march back into his winter - quarters . I served two campaigns under him without honour , sack , plunder , or emolument , save a beggarly stipend of three gulden a day , paid in clipped money , six months in arrear .

There in the centre , amid that cavalcade of cavaliers , rides our new monarch doubtless . Pity he hath not a man by him who can put this swarm of peasants into something like campaign order . Now do but look at those four pieces of ordnance trailing along like lame sheep behind the flock . Caracco , I would that I were a young King 's officer with a troop of light horse on the ridge yonder ! My faith , how I should sweep down yon cross road like a kestrel on a brood of young plover !

94537	94625	94281	94281	he	810	' Aye , the rogues had to work or hang -- one or t'other . But methinks our friends here are scarce as numerous as reported . I reckon them to be a thousand horse , and mayhap five thousand two hundred foot . I have been thought a good tally - man on such occasions . With fifteen hundred in the town that would bring us to close on eight thousand men , which is no great force to invade a kingdom and dispute a crown . '

We have twice met the enemy , with the effect that we have armed ourselves with their muskets and field - pieces . From first to last there hath been nothing which has not prospered with us . We must look to it that the future be as successful as the past . To insure this I have called ye together , and I now ask ye to give me your opinions of our situation , leaving me after I have listened to your views to form our plan of action .

104754	104779	104751	104751	he	748	' are a soldier and a man of experience . What is your advice ? Should we halt here or push forward towards London ? '
104780	104798	104799	104799	Grey	619	' To advance to the East would , in my humble judgment , be fatal to us , '
104822	104961	104799	104799	Grey	619	' James Stuart is strong in horse , and we have none . We can hold our own amongst hedgerows or in broken country , but what chance could we have in the middle of Salisbury Plain ? With the dragoons round us we should be like a flock of sheep amid a pack of wolves . Again , every step which we take towards London removes us from our natural vantage ground , and from the fertile country which supplies our necessities , while it strengthens our enemy by shortening the distance he has to convey his troops and his victuals . Unless , therefore , we hear of some great outbreak elsewhere , or of some general movement in London in our favour , we would do best to hold our ground and wait an attack . '
104962	104973	104975	104976	the King	1341	' You argue shrewdly and well , my Lord Grey , '
104978	105144	105145	105145	He	3960	' But how long are we to wait for this outbreak which never comes , and for this support which is ever promised and never provided ? We have now been seven long days in England , and during that time of all the House of Commons no single man hath come over to us , and of the lords none gave my Lord Grey , who was himself an exile . Not a baron or an earl , and only one baronet , hath taken up arms for me . Where are the men whom Danvers and Wildman promised me from London ? Where are the brisk boys of the City who were said to be longing for me ? Where are the breakings out from Berwick to Portland which they foretold ? Not a man hath moved save only these good peasants . I have been deluded , ensnared , trapped -- trapped by vile agents who have led me into the shambles . '
105194	105201	105203	105204	the King	1341	' Tell me , Colonel Buyse , '
105214	105228	105203	105204	the King	1341	' Do you , as a soldier , agree with my Lord Grey ? '
105229	105236	105237	105238	the German	3660	' Ask Saxon , your Majesty , '
105241	105261	105237	105238	the German	3660	' My opinion in a Raths - Versammlung is , I have observed , ever the same as his . '
105262	105272	105274	105274	Monmouth	748	' Then we turn to you , Colonel Saxon , '
105276	105323	105274	105274	Monmouth	748	' We have in this council a party who are in favour of an advance and a party who wish to stand their ground . Their weight and numbers are , methinks , nearly equal . If you had the casting vote how would you decide ? '
105375	105385	105386	105386	he	2661	' I will give my opinion , your Majesty , '
105391	105510	105386	105386	he	2661	' Feversham and Churchill are making for Salisbury with three thousand foot , and they have pushed on eight hundred of the Blue Guards , and two or three dragoon regiments . We should , therefore , as Lord Grey says , have to fight on Salisbury Plain , and our foot armed with a medley of weapons could scarce make head against their horse . All is possible to the Lord , as Dr. Ferguson wisely says . We are as grains of dust in the hollow of His hand . Yet He hath given us brains wherewith to choose the better course , and if we neglect it we must suffer the consequence of our folly . '
105544	105552	105553	105553	Saxon	810	' On the other hand , sire , '
105556	105856	105553	105553	Saxon	810	' it appears to me that to remain here is equally impossible . Your Majesty 's friends throughout England would lose all heart if the army lay motionless and struck no blow . The rustics would flock off to their wives and homes . Such an example is catching . I have seen a great army thaw away like an icicle in the sunshine . Once gone , it is no easy matter to collect them again . To keep them we must employ them . Never let them have an idle minute . Drill them . March them . Exercise them . Work them . Preach to them . Make them obey God and their Colonel . This can not be done in snug quarters . They must travel . We can not hope to end this business until we get to London . London , then , must be our goal . But there are many ways of reaching it . You have , sire , as I have heard , many friends at Bristol and in the Midlands . If I might advise , I should say let us march round in that direction . Every day that passes will serve to swell your forces and improve your troops , while all will feel something is astirring . Should we take Bristol -- and I hear that the works are not very strong -- it would give us a very good command of shipping , and a rare centre from which to act . If all goes well with us , we could make our way to London through Gloucestershire and Worcestershire . In the meantime I might suggest that a day of fast and humiliation be called to bring down a blessing on the cause . '
105893	105900	105902	105902	he	748	' By my faith , Colonel , '

Of course , if we make ourselves strong in the West , and my uncle is threatened with disaffection elsewhere , he will have no chance to hold out against us . Should he wish to fight us upon our own ground , he must needs drain his troops from north , south , and east , which is not to be thought of . We may very well march to London by way of Bristol . '

106062	106115	106059	106059	Saxon	810	' He confided in me , believing me to be one of the Duke of Beaufort 's household . As to the horse , one party pursued us on Salisbury Plain with bloodhounds , and another attacked us not twenty miles from here and lost a score of troopers and a cornet . '

106197	106275	106193	106193	Wade	585	' We have , as your Majesty most truly says , met with heavy discouragement in the fact that no noblemen and few commoners of repute have declared for us . The reason is , I opine , that each doth wait for his neighbour to make a move . Should one or two come over the others would soon follow . How , then , are we to bring a duke or two to our standards ? '
106276	106285	106287	106287	Monmouth	748	' There 's the question , Master Wade , '

He hath two hundred horses in his stables at Badminton , and a thousand men , as I have heard , sit down at his tables every day . Why should not a special effort be made to gain over such a one , the more so as we intend to march in his direction ? '

106536	106621	106533	106533	Monmouth	748	' He is , sire , but he may be induced to turn in your favour the weapon which he hath raised against you . He is a Protestant . He is said to be a Whig . Why should we not send a message to him ? Flatter his pride . Appeal to his religion . Coax and threaten him . Who knows ? He may have private grievances of which we know nothing , and may be ripe for such a move . '
106622	106630	106632	106633	Lord Grey	619	' Your counsel is good , Wade , '
106635	106711	106632	106633	Lord Grey	619	' but methinks his Majesty hath asked a pertinent question . Your messenger would , I fear , find himself swinging upon one of the Badminton oaks if the Duke desired to show his loyalty to James Stuart . Where are we to find a man who is wary enough and bold enough for such a mission , without risking one of our leaders , who could be ill - spared at such a time ? '

I need not tell you that there is a real danger . If the Duke wishes to prove to James that he would not allow himself to be tampered with , he can only do it by punishing the messenger , which as lieutenant of a county he hath power to do in times of civil commotion . He is a hard man if all reports be true . On the other hand , if you should chance to succeed it may lay the foundations of your fortunes and be the means of saving Monmouth . He needs help , by the Lord Harry ! Never have I seen such a rabble as this army of his . Buyse says that they fought lustily at this ruffle at Axminster , but he is of one mind with me , that a few whiffs of shot and cavalry charges would scatter them over the countryside .

As to my little box , which a fair friend of mine in town packed for me , it was to be forwarded to Bristol , where I am now supposed to be , and should be were it not for my good fortune in meeting your party . It chanced to find its way , however , to the Bruton inn , and the good woman there , whom I had conciliated , found means to send it after me . It is a good rule to go upon , Clarke , in this earthly pilgrimage , always to kiss the landlady . It may seem a small thing , and yet life is made up of small things . I have few fixed principles , I fear , but two there are which I can say from my heart that I never transgress . I always carry a corkscrew , and I never forget to kiss the landlady . '

Another asking me to chase the stag at Epping . Zounds ! had I not cleared off I should have been run down myself , with a pack of bandog bailiffs at my heels . A dunning letter from my clothier . He can afford to lose this bill . He hath had many a long one out of me . An offer of three thousand from little Dicky Chichester . No , no , Dicky , it wo n't do . A gentleman ca n't live upon his friends . None the less grateful . How now ? From Mrs. Butterworth ! No money for three weeks ! Bailiffs in the house ! Now , curse me , if this is not too bad ! '

Sir Edward Mortimer is my mother 's younger brother , Clarke , but he is not many years older than myself . A proper , strait - laced , soft - voiced lad he has ever been , and , as a consequence , he throve in the world , and joined land to land after the scriptural fashion . I had befriended him from my purse in the old days , but he soon came to be a richer man than I , for all that he gained he kept , whereas all I got -- well , it went off like the smoke of the pipe which you are lighting . When I found that all was up with me I received from Mortimer an advance , which was sufficient to take me according to my wish over to Virginia , together with a horse and a personal outfit . There was some chance , Clarke , of the Jerome acres going to him should aught befall me , so that he was not averse to helping me off to a land of fevers and scalping knives . Nay , never shake your head , my dear country lad , you little know the wiles of the world . '

108944	109214	108936	108937	Sir Gervas	465	' I have , as I said , done Mortimer some turns which he might remember , though it did not become me to remind him of them . This Mistress Butterworth is mine old wet - nurse , and it hath been the custom of the family to provide for her . I could not bear the thought that in the ruin of my fortune she should lose the paltry guinea or so a week which stood between her and hunger . My only request to Mortimer , therefore , made on the score of old friendship , was that he should continue this pittance , I promising that should I prosper I would return whatever he should disburse . The mean - hearted villain wrung my hand and swore that it should be so . How vile a thing is human nature , Clarke ! For the sake of this paltry sum he , a rich man , hath broken his pledge , and left this poor woman to starve . But he shall answer to me for it . He thinks that I am on the Atlantic . If I march back to London with these brave boys I shall disturb the tenor of his sainted existence . Meanwhile I shall trust to sun - dials , and off goes my watch to Mother Butterworth . Bless her ample bosoms ! I have tried many liquors , but I dare bet that the first was the most healthy . But how of your own letters ? You have been frowning and smiling like an April day . '
109215	109232	109234	109234	I.	3996	' There is one from my father , with a few words attached from my mother , '

I spoke even now of your knowing little of the world , but indeed it may be that in your village you can see mankind without the varnish , and so come to learn more of the good of human nature . Varnish or none , the bad will ever peep through . Now this carpenter and seaman show themselves no doubt for what they are . A man might know my friends of the court for a lifetime , and never come upon their real selves , nor would it perhaps repay the search when you had come across it . Sink me , but I wax philosophical , which is the old refuge of the ruined man . Give me a tub , and I shall set up in the Piazza of Covent Garden , and be the Diogenes of London . I would not be wealthy again , Micah ! How goes the old lilt?--

I trust that you are now safe with Monmouth 's army , and that you have received honourable appointment therein . I doubt not that you will find among your comrades some who are extreme sectaries , and others who are scoffers and disbelievers . Be advised by me , friend , and avoid both the one and the other . For the zealot is a man who not only defends his own right of worship , wherein he hath justice , but wishes to impose upon the consciences of others , by which he falls into the very error against which he fights . The mere brainless scoffer is , on the other hand , lower than the beast of the field , since he lacks the animal 's self - respect and humble resignation . " '

The presence of a table doth prove the existence of a carpenter , and so the presence of a universe proves the existence of a universe Maker , call Him by what name you will . So far the ground is very firm beneath us , without either inspiration , teaching , or any aid whatever . Since , then , there _ must _ be a world Maker , let us judge of His nature by His work . We can not observe the glories of the firmament , its infinite extent , its beauty , and the Divine skill wherewith every plant and animal hath its wants cared for , without seeing that He is full of wisdom , intelligence , and power . We are still , you will perceive , upon solid ground , without having to call to our aid aught save pure reason . " '
110273	110440	110081	110082	the Baronet	3225	' " Having got so far , let us inquire to what end the universe was made , and we put upon it . The teaching of all nature shows that it must be to the end of improvement and upward growth , the increase in real virtue , in knowledge , and in wisdom . Nature is a silent preacher which holds forth upon week - days as on Sabbaths . We see the acorn grow into the oak , the egg into the bird , the maggot into the butterfly . Shall we doubt , then , that the human soul , the most precious of all things , is also upon the upward path ? And how can the soul progress save through the cultivation of virtue and self - mastery ? What other way is there ? There is none . We may say with confidence , then , that we are placed here to increase in knowledge and in virtue . " '

It is as true and as capable of proof as one of those exercises of Euclid which we have gone over together . On this common ground men have raised many different buildings . Christianity , the creed of Mahomet , the creed of the Easterns , have all the same essence . The difference lies in the forms and the details . Let us hold to our own Christian creed , the beautiful , often - professed , and seldom - practised doctrine of love , but let us not despise our fellow - men , for we are all branches from the common root of truth .

Exciseman Westhouse hath slain Cooper Dick , and it is just that he should die for it ; but as to taking this young soldier 's life , I 'd as soon think of scuttling the saucy _ Maria _ , or of mounting the Jolly Roger at her peak .

Yet this man and his fellows are ever yelping at our heels , like so many dogfish on a cod bank . We have been harried , and chivied , and shot at until we are driven into such dens as this . A month ago , four of our men were bearing a keg up the hillside to Farmer Black , who hath dealt with us these five years back . Of a sudden , down came half a score of horse , led by this gauger , hacked and slashed with their broad - swords , cut Long John 's arm open , and took Cooper Dick prisoner . Dick was haled to Ilchester Gaol , and hung up after the assizes like a stoat on a gamekeeper 's door . This night we had news that this very gauger was coming this way , little knowing that we should be on the look - out for him . Is it a wonder that we should lay a trap for him , and that , having caught him , we should give him the same justice as he gave our comrades ? '

There are many who envy my lofty fortunes , and who would seize upon a chance of injuring me with King James . Sunderland or Somers would either of them blow the least rumour into a flame which might prove unquenchable . There was naught for it , therefore , but to show the papers and to turn a harsh face on the messenger . The most venomous tongue could not find fault in my conduct .

The Tower would be too scanty for its guests were we all to wear our hearts upon our sleeves . But to you in this privacy I can tell my real thoughts without fear of betrayal or misconstruction . On paper I will not write one word . Your memory must be the sheet which bears my answer to Monmouth . And first of all , erase from it all that you have heard me say in the council - room . Let it be as though it never were spoken . Is that done ? '

And yet -- and yet!--One thing I know , that any defeat of Feversham 's army would cause a general rising throughout the country . On the other hand , the King 's party are active . Every post brings news of some fresh levy . Albemarle still holds the militia together in the west . The Earl of Pembroke is in arms in Wiltshire . Lord Lumley is moving from the east with the Sussex forces . The Earl of Abingdon is up in Oxfordshire . At the university the caps and gowns are all turning into head - pieces and steel fronts . James 's Dutch regiments have sailed from Amsterdam . Yet Monmouth hath gained two fights , and why not a third ? They are troubled waters -- troubled waters ! '

Tell him also that I wish him well in his enterprise , and would help him were it not that I am hemmed in by those who watch me closely , and who would denounce me were I to show my true thoughts . Tell him that , should he move his army into these parts , I may then openly declare myself ; but to do so now would be to ruin the fortunes of my house , without in any way helping him . Can you bear him that message ? '

His plans were like a weather - vane , altered by every breeze . He was constant only in his inconstancy . It is true that he led the King 's troops in Scotland , but all men knew that Claverhouse and Dalzell were the real conquerors at Bothwell Bridge . Methinks he resembles that Brutus in Roman history who feigned weakness of mind as a cover to his ambitions . '

He doth not think it beneath him to shake the dirty paw of Jerry the tinker , or to run a race against a bumpkin on the village green . Well , events have shown that he hath been right . These same bumpkins have stood by him when nobler friends have held aloof . I would I could see into the future . But you have my message , Captain , and I trust that , if you change it in the delivery , it will be in the direction of greater warmth and kindliness . It is time now that you depart , for within three hours the guard is changed , and your escape will be discovered . '

When you have reached the ground , take the gravel path which turns to the right , and follow it until it leads you to the high trees which skirt the park . The seventh of these hath a bough which shoots over the boundary wall . Climb along the bough , drop over upon the other side , and you will find my own valet waiting with your horse . Up with you , and ride , haste , haste , post - haste , for the south . By morn you should be well out of danger 's way . '

I will off to Bristol at daybreak , and give my council enough to think of without their having time to devote to your fate . The soldiers will but have another instance of the working of the Father of Evil , who hath long been thought to have a weakness for that cell beneath us . Faith , if all we hear be true , there have been horrors enough acted there to call up every devil out of the pit . But time presses . Gently through the casement ! So ! Remember the message . '

In numbers it had increased to nigh eight thousand , and the men were well fed and light of heart . With sturdy close - locked ranks they splashed their way through mud and puddle , with many a rough country joke and many a lusty stave from song or hymn . Sir Gervas rode at the head of his musqueteers , whose befloured tails hung limp and lank with the water dripping from them . Lockarby 's pikemen and my own company of scythesmen were mostly labourers from the country , who were hardened against all weathers , and plodded patiently along with the rain - drops glistening upon their ruddy faces . In front were the Taunton foot ; behind , the lumbering train of baggage waggons , with the horse in the rear of them . So the long line wound its way over the hills .

It is a sorry thing for a man 's mind to have nothing higher to dwell upon than the turning of a compliment or the dancing of a corranto . Zounds , lad ! I have your friend the carpenter to thank for much . As he says in his letter , unless a man can get the good that is in him out , he is of loss value in the world than one of those fowls that we hear cackling , for they at least fulfill their mission , if it be only to lay eggs .

You can not think , lad , how easy it is for a money - bag to take unto itself wings and fly . It is true that the man who spends it doth not consume the money , but passes it on to some one who profits thereby . Yet the fault lies in the fact that it was to the wrong folk that we passed our money , thereby breeding a useless and debauched class at the expense of honest callings . Od 's fish , lad ! when I think of the swarms of needy beggars , the lecherous pimps , the nose - slitting bullies , the toadies and the flatterers who were reared by us , I feel that in hatching such a poisonous brood our money hath done what no money can undo .

152114	152408	151907	151907	he	5315	' Aye ! it was the mode to receive in bed , attired in laced cambric shirt and periwig , though afterwards it was permitted to sit up in your chamber , but dressed _ a la negligence _ , in gown and slippers . The mode is a terrible tyrant , Clarke , though its arm may not extend as far as Havant . The idle man of the town must have some rule of life , so he becomes a slave to the law of the fashions . No man in London was more subject to it than myself . I was regular in my irregularities , and orderly in my disorders . At eleven o'clock to the stroke , up came my valet with the morning cup of hippocras , an excellent thing for the qualms , and some slight refection , as the breast of an ortolan or wing of a widgeon . Then came the levee , twenty , thirty , or forty of the class I have spoken of , though now and then perhaps there might be some honest case of want among them , some needy man - of - letters in quest of a guinea , or pupil - less pedant with much ancient learning in his head and very little modern coinage in his pocket . It was not only that I had some power of mine own , but I was known to have the ear of my Lord Halifax , Sidney Godolphin , Lawrence Hyde , and others whose will might make or mar a man . Mark you those lights upon the left ! Would it not be well to see if there is not something to be had there ? '

They had little more savoury than their own bullets to put in their mouths when I left them . But I was speaking of old days in London . Our time was well filled . Should a man of quality incline to sport there was ever something to attract him . He might see sword - playing at Hockley , or cocking at Shoe Lane , or baiting at Southwark , or shooting at Tothill Fields . Again , he might walk in the physic gardens of St. James 's , or go down the river with the ebb tide to the cherry orchards at Rotherhithe , or drive to Islington to drink the cream , or , above all , walk in the Park , which is most modish for a gentleman who dresses in the fashion . You see , Clarke , that we were active in our idleness , and that there was no lack of employment . Then as evening came on there were the playhouses to draw us , Dorset Gardens , Lincoln 's Inn , Drury Lane , and the Queen's -- among the four there was ever some amusement to be found . '

There were the orange wenches to quiz -- plaguey sharp of tongue the hussies are , too -- and there were the vizards of the pit , whose little black masks did invite inquiry , and there were the beauties of the town and the toasts of the Court , all fair mark for our quizzing - glasses . Play , indeed ! S'bud , we had something better to do than to listen to alexandrines or weigh the merits of hexameters ! '

Then there were dice and cards at the Groom Porter 's or under the arches at Covent Garden , piquet , passage , hazard , primero -- what you choose . After that you could find all the world at the coffee - houses , where an arriere supper was often served with devilled bones and prunes , to drive the fumes of wine from the head . Zounds , Micah ! If the Jews should relax their pressure , or if this war brings us any luck , you shall come to town with me and shall see all these things for yourself . '

They made their way up to the farmhouse here , and presently from cries and other tokens I knew what manner of hell - fire business they had on hand . On that I left my mare in the field and ran up , when I saw them through the casement , tricing the good man up in front of his fire to make him confess where his wealth lay hidden , though indeed it is my own belief that neither he nor any other farmer in these parts hath any wealth left to hide , after two armies have been quartered in turn upon them . Finding that his mouth remained closed , they ran him up , as you saw , and would assuredly have toasted him like a snipe , had I not stepped in and winged two of them with my barkers . The others set upon me , but I pinked one through the forearm , and should doubtless have given a good account of both of them but for your incoming . '

Through that district there is no road which is not familiar to me , nor as much as a break in the hedge which I could not find in blackest midnight . It is my calling . But the trade is not what it was . If I had a son I should not bring him up to it . It hath been spoiled by the armed guards to the mail - coaches , and by the accursed goldsmiths , who have opened their banks and so taken the hard money into their strong boxes , giving out instead slips of paper , which are as useless to us as an old newsletter . I give ye my word that only a week gone last Friday I stopped a grazier coming from Blandford fair , and I took seven hundred guineas off him in these paper cheques , as they call them -- enough , had it been in gold , to have lasted me for a three month rouse . Truly the country is coming to a pretty pass when such trash as that is allowed to take the place of the King 's coinage . '

It is , as you say , a dangerous game , but two can play at it , and each has an equal chance . There is no loading of the dice , or throwing of fulhams . Now it was but a few days back that , riding down the high - road , I perceived three jolly farmers at full gallop across the fields with a leash of dogs yelping in front of them , and all in pursuit of one little harmless bunny . It was a bare and unpeopled countryside on the border of Exmoor , so I bethought me that I could not employ my leisure better than by chasing the chasers . Odd 's wouns ! it was a proper hunt . Away went my gentlemen , whooping like madmen , with their coat skirts flapping in the breeze , chivying on the dogs , and having a rare morning 's sport . They never marked the quiet horseman who rode behind them , and who without a " yoick ! " or " hark - a - way ! " was relishing his chase with the loudest of them . It needed but a posse of peace officers at my heels to make up a brave string of us , catch - who - catch - can , like the game the lads play on the village green . '

159035	159274	158684	158684	I	0	' Well , my three friends ran down their hare , and pulled out their flasks , as men who had done a good stroke of work . They were still hobnobbing and laughing over the slaughtered bunny , and one had dismounted to cut off its ears as the prize of their chase , when I came up at a hand - gallop . " Good - morrow , gentlemen , " said I , " we have had rare sport . " They looked at me blankly enough , I promise you , and one of them asked me what the devil I did there , and how I dared to join in a private sport . " Nay , I was not chasing your hare , gentlemen , " said I. " What then , fellow ? " asked one of them . " Why , marry , I was chasing you , " I answered , " and a better run I have not had for years . " With that I lugged out my persuaders , and made the thing clear in a few words , and I 'll warrant you would have laughed could you have seen their faces as they slowly dragged the fat leather purses from their fobs . Seventy - one pounds was my prize that morning , which was better worth riding for than a hare 's ears . '

161688	161718	161685	161685	he	5552	' The other , two miles farther off , is Middlezoy , and away to the left , just on the far side of the rhine , is Chedzoy . '
161719	161730	161732	161733	the King	1341	' The rhine , sir ! What do you mean ? '
161761	161773	161774	161774	he	1341	' Why , the rhine , your Grace , your Majesty , '
161777	161802	161774	161774	he	1341	' The rhine , which , as your Majesty 's Grace can not but perceive , is what the country folk call the rhine . '
161803	161830	161832	161834	Sir Stephen Timewell	871	' It is a name , your Majesty , for the deep and broad ditches which drain off the water from the great morass of Sedgemoor , '
161903	162179	161883	161883	Hollis	795	' If it please your Majesty , there is something in their order which recalls to my mind that of the army of the Scots upon the occasion of the battle of Dunbar . Cromwell lay in Dunbar even as we lie in Bridgewater . The ground around , which was boggy and treacherous , was held by the enemy . There was not a man in the army who would not own that , had old Leslie held his position , we should , as far as human wisdom could see , have had to betake us to our ships , leave our stores and ordnance , and so make the best of our way to Newcastle . He moved , however , through the blessing of Providence , in such a manner that a quagmire intervened between his right wing and the rest of his army , on which Cromwell fell upon that wing in the early dawn , and dashed it to pieces , with such effect that the whole army fled , and we had the execution of them to the very gates of Leith . Seven thousand Scots lost their lives , but not more than a hundred or so of the honest folk . Now , your Majesty will see through your glass that a mile of bogland intervenes between these villages , and that the nearest one , Chedzoy , as I think they call it , might be approached without ourselves entering the morass . Very sure I am that were the Lord - General with us now he would counsel us to venture some such attack . '
162180	162194	162196	162198	Sir Stephen Timewell	871	' It is a bold thing with raw peasants to attack old soldiers , '
162200	162234	162196	162198	Sir Stephen Timewell	871	' Yet if it is to be done , I know well that there is not a man born within sound of the bells of St. Mary Magdalene who will flinch from it . '
162235	162243	162245	162245	Monmouth	748	' You say well , Sir Stephen , '
162247	162269	162245	162245	Monmouth	748	' At Dunbar Cromwell had veterans at his back , and was opposed to troops who had small experience of war . '
162270	162284	162286	162287	Lord Grey	619	' Yet there is much good sense in what Major Hollis has said , '
162289	162362	162286	162287	Lord Grey	619	' We must either fall on , or be gradually girt round and starved out . That being so , why not take advantage at once of the chance which Feversham 's ignorance or carelessness hath given us ? To - morrow , if Churchill can prevail over his chief , I have little doubt that we shall find their camp rearranged , and so have cause to regret our lost opportunity . '
162363	162370	162372	162372	Wade	585	' Their horse lie at Westonzoyland , '
162374	162452	162372	162372	Wade	585	' The sun is so fierce now that we can scarce see for its glare and the haze which rises up from the marshes . Yet a little while ago I could make out through my glasses the long lines of horses picketed on the moor beyond the village . Behind , in Middlezoy , are two thousand militia , while in Chedzoy , where our attack would fall , there are five regiments of regular foot . '
162453	162464	162466	162466	Monmouth	748	' If we could break those all would be well , '
162468	162477	162466	162466	Monmouth	748	' What is your advice , Colonel Buyse ? '
162478	162486	162487	162488	the German	3660	' My advice is ever the same , '
162491	162510	162487	162488	the German	3660	' We are here to fight , and the sooner we get to work at it the better . '
162511	162528	162372	162372	Wade	585	' And yours , Colonel Saxon ? Do you agree with the opinion of your friend ? '
162529	162589	162487	162488	the German	3660	' I think with Major Hollis , your Majesty , that Feversham by his dispositions hath laid himself open to attack , and that we should take advantage of it forthwith . Yet , considering that trained men and a numerous horse have great advantage by daylight , I should be in favour of a camisado or night onfall . '
162590	162599	162601	162601	Grey	619	' The same thought was in my mind , '
162603	162630	162601	162601	Grey	619	' Our friends here know every inch of the ground , and could guide us to Chedzoy as surely in the darkness as in the day . '
162631	162636	162638	162638	Saxon	810	' I have heard , '
162640	162700	162638	162638	Saxon	810	' that much beer and cider , with wine and strong waters , have found their way into their camp . If this be so we may give them a rouse while their heads are still buzzing with the liquor , when they shall scarce know whether it is ourselves or the blue devils which have come upon them . '
162736	162747	162749	162750	the King	1341	' Has any cavalier anything to say against this plan ? '
162862	162868	162870	162870	he	5569	' If all are agreed , '
162872	162980	162870	162870	he	5569	' let our word be " Soho , " and let us come upon them as soon after midnight as may be . What remains to be settled as to the order of battle may be left for the meantime . You will now , gentlemen , return to your regiments , and you will remember that be the upshot of this what it may , whether Monmouth be the crowned King of England or a hunted fugitive , his heart , while it can still beat , will ever bear in memory the brave friends who stood at his side in the hour of his trouble . '
163130	163141	163142	163142	he	5571	' My thanks to ye , dear friends and subjects , '
163145	163202	163142	163142	he	5571	' The issue rests with the Almighty , but what men can do will , I know well , be done by you this night . If Monmouth can not have all England , six feet of her shall at least be his . Meanwhile , to your regiments , and may God defend the right ! '
163203	163231	163269	163270	the crowd	2652	' May God defend the right ! cried the council solemnly , and separated , leaving the King with Grey to make the final dispositions for the attack .
163232	163259	163261	163261	Saxon	810	' These popinjays of the Court are ready enough to wave their rapiers and shout when there are four good miles between them and the foe , '
163272	163318	163261	163261	Saxon	810	' I fear that they will scarce be as forward when there is a line of musqueteers to be faced , and a brigade of horse perhaps charging down upon their flank . But here comes friend Lockarby , with news written upon his face . '
163319	163329	163331	163331	Reuben	751	' I have a report to make , Colonel , '
163339	163359	163331	163331	Reuben	751	' You may remember that I and my company were placed on guard this day at the eastern gates ? '
163363	163556	163261	163261	Saxon	810	' Being desirous of seeing all that I could of the enemy , I clambered up a lofty tree which stands just without the town . From this post , by the aid of a glass , I was able to make out their lines and camp . Whilst I was gazing I chanced to observe a man slinking along under cover of the birch - trees half - way between their lines and the town . Watching him , I found that he was indeed moving in our direction . Presently he came so near that I was able to distinguish who it was -- for it was one whom I know -- but instead of entering the town by my gate he walked round under cover of the peat cuttings , and so made his way doubtless to some other entrance . He is a man , however , who I have reason to believe has no true love for the cause , and it is my belief that he hath been to the Royal camp with news of our doings , and hath now come back for further information . '
163557	163560	163562	163562	Saxon	810	' Aye ! '
163568	163577	163565	163565	his	810	' And what is the man 's name ? '
163578	163603	163261	163261	Saxon	810	' His name is Derrick , one time chief apprentice to Master Timewell at Taunton , and now an officer in the Taunton foot . '
163604	163672	163565	163565	his	810	' What , the young springald who had his eye upon pretty Mistress Ruth ! Now , out on love , if it is to turn a true man into a traitor ! But methought he was one of the elect ? I have heard him hold forth to the pikemen . How comes it that one of his kidney should lend help to the Prelatist cause ? '
163673	163677	163261	163261	Saxon	810	' Love again , '
163680	163700	163679	163679	I.	5580	' This same love is a pretty flower when it grows unchecked , but a sorry weed if thwarted . '

163718	163811	163716	163716	Reuben	751	' and he would ruin the army to avenge himself on them , as a rogue might sink a ship in the hope of drowning one enemy . Sir Stephen himself hath incurred his hatred for refusing to force his daughter into accepting his suit . He has now returned into the camp , and I have reported the matter to you , that you may judge whether it would not be well to send a file of pikemen and lay him by the heels lest he play the spy once more . '
163812	163820	163821	163821	Saxon	810	' Perhaps it would be best so , '
163828	163857	163821	163821	Saxon	810	' and yet no doubt the fellow would have some tale prepared which would outweigh our mere suspicions . Could we not take him in the very act ? '
163942	163946	163947	163947	Saxon	810	' Most excellent ! '
163957	164005	163947	163947	Saxon	810	' My learned Fleming himself could not have devised a better rusus belli . Do ye convey as many files as ye may think fit to this point , and I shall see that Master Derrick is primed up with some fresh news for my Lord Feversham . '
164006	164020	164022	164022	Reuben	751	' Nay , a body of troops marching out would set tongues wagging , '
164024	164034	164022	164022	Reuben	751	' Why should not Micah and I go ourselves ? '
164035	164042	164043	164043	Saxon	810	' That would indeed be better . '

Besides , the man whom ye support has shown that he is unworthy of confidence . Did he not in his declaration promise to leave the choice of a monarch to the Commons ?

It comes , doubtless , from training , and it may be that I have it more than others of my class . I feel as a cat who would lick all day to take the least speck from her fur . Is not the patch over the eyebrow happily chosen ? Nay , you can not even offer an opinion ; I would as soon ask friend Marot , the knight of the pistol . Fill up your glass ! '

The mill itself appeared to be silent and empty . I climbed the steep wood ladder , and pushing the door open , walked into a round stone - flagged room , from which a second ladder led to the loft above . On one side of this chamber was a long wooden box , and all round the walls were ranged rows of sacks full of flour . In the fireplace stood a pile of faggots ready for lighting , so with the aid of my tinder - box I soon had a cheerful blaze . Taking a large handful of flour from the nearest bag I moistened it with water from a pitcher , and having rolled it out into a flat cake , proceeded to bake it , smiling the while to think of what my mother would say to such rough cookery . Very sure I am that Patrick Lamb himself , whose book , the '

I then rolled a second one , and having placed it before the fire , and drawn my pipe from my pocket , I set myself to smoke , waiting with all the philosophy which I could muster until it should be ready .

Were we on the field you could see where I had stood by the ring of slain which would be found within the sweep of my sword - arm . Finding that all was lost and that our rogues were fled , I mounted our worthy Mayor 's charger , seeing that the gallant gentleman had no further need for it , and rode slowly from the field . I promise you that there was that in my eye and bearing which prevented their horse from making too close a pursuit of me . One trooper did indeed throw himself across my path , but mine old back - handed cut was too much for him . Alas , I have much upon my conscience ? I have made both widows and orphans .

We have a fighting strain in us ever since my kinsman followed Ireton 's army as a sutler . I pulled up , therefore , and had dismounted to take my observations , when my brute of a charger gave the bridle a twitch , jerked itself free , and was off in an instant over hedges and ditches . I had , therefore , only my good sword left to trust to . I climbed up the ladder , and was engaged in planning how the defence could best be conducted , when I heard the clank of hoofs , and on the top of it you did ascend from below . I retired at once into ambush , from which I should assuredly have made a sudden outfall or sally , had the flour not so choked my breathing that I felt as though I had a two - pound loaf stuck in my gizzard . For myself , I am glad that it has so come about , for in my blind wrath I might unwittingly have done you an injury . Hearing the clank of your sword as you did come up the ladder , I did opine that you were one of King James 's minions , the captain , perchance , of some troop in the fields below . '

Why can they not conform to the Church , and be plagued to them ? It is good enough for the King , so surely it is good enough for them ; or are their souls so delicate that they can not satisfy themselves with that on which every honest Englishman thrives ? The main road to Heaven is too common for them . They must needs have each a by - path of their own , and cry out against all who will not follow it . '

We were stowed away in irons in the afterhold , amongst the bilge water and the rats , with hatches battened down and guards atop , but even then they could not keep us , for the irons got adrift , and Will Adams , the carpenter 's mate , picked a hole in the seams so that the vessel nearly foundered , and in the confusion we fell upon the prize crew , and , using our fetters as cudgels , regained possession of the vessel .

Yes , lad ! I met him in the street , and I cocked my hat in his face . The villain laid his hand upon his hilt , and I should have out bilbo and sent his soul to hell had they not come between us . I care not the ashes of this pipe for Jeffreys or any other of them . I can snap this finger and thumb at them , so ! They would rather see Decimus Saxon 's back than his face , I promise ye ! '

202230	202623	202084	202086	the old soldier	2126	' Why , marry , it is no mystery . Cunning old birds are not to be caught with chaff . When I left you I made for a certain inn where I could count upon finding a friend . There I lay by for a while , en cachette , as the Messieurs call it , while I could work out the plan that was in my head . Donner wetter ! but I got a fright from that old seaman friend of yours , who should be sold as a picture , for he is of little use as a man . Well , I bethought me early in the affair of your visit to Badminton , and of the Duke of B. We shall mention no names , but you can follow my meaning . To him I sent a messenger , to the effect that I purposed to purchase my own pardon by letting out all that I knew concerning his double dealing with the rebels . The message was carried to him secretly , and his answer was that I should meet him at a certain spot by night . I sent my messenger instead of myself , and he was found in the morning stiff and stark , with more holes in his doublet than ever the tailor made . On this I sent again , raising my demands , and insisting upon a speedy settlement . He asked my conditions . I replied , a free pardon and a command for myself . For you , money enough to land you safely in some foreign country where you can pursue the noble profession of arms . I got them both , though it was like drawing teeth from his head . His name hath much power at Court just now , and the King can refuse him nothing . I have my pardon and a command of troops in New England . For you I have two hundred pieces , of which thirty have been paid in ransom to the captain , while twenty are due to me for my disbursements over the matter . In this bag you will find the odd hundred and fifty , of which you will pay fifteen to the fishermen who have promised to see you safe to Flushing . '

202804	202860	202784	202784	I	0	' But I fear that your pains have been thrown away . These poor country folk have none to look after or assist them . They are as simple as babes , and as little fitted to be landed in a strange country . I can not find it in my heart to leave them ! '
202887	202893	202894	202894	he	810	' This is too much ! '
202899	202971	202894	202894	he	810	' I saw many difficulties in my way , yet I did not foresee this one . You are in very truth the most contrary man that ever stood in neat 's leather . You have ever some outlandish reason for jibbing and shying like a hot - blooded , half - broken colt . Yet I think that I can overcome these strange scruples of yours by a little persuasion . '

202986	203066	202983	202984	the seaman	1706	' I 'll be as good as a father to them . S'help me , I will , on the word of an honest sailor ! If you should choose to lay out a trifle of twenty pieces upon their comfort , I shall see that their food is such as mayhap many of them never got at their own tables .

If he can bring his own skin out of the business , it will be more than I expect . He hath a man aboard his ship who would think no more of giving him a tilt over the side than I should . '

203251	203261	203157	203157	he	810	' Hast ever heard of a man named Marot ? '
203262	203294	203157	203157	he	810	' Hector Marot ! Yes , surely I knew him well . A highwayman he was , but a mighty stout man with a kind heart beneath a thief 's jacket . '
203295	203428	203157	203157	he	810	' The same . He is as you say a stout man and a resolute swordsman , though from what I have seen of his play he is weak in stoccado , and perhaps somewhat too much attached to the edge , and doth not give prominence enough to the point , in which respect he neglects the advice and teaching of the most noteworthy fencers in Europe . Well , well , folk differ on this as on every other subject ! Yet it seems to me that I would sooner be carried off the field after using my weapon secundum artem , than walk off unscathed after breaking the laws d'escrime . Quarte , tierce , and saccoon , say I , and the devil take your estramacons and passados ! '
203429	203435	203436	203436	I	0	' But what of Marot ? '
203440	203445	203447	203447	Saxon	810	' He is aboard , '
203449	203560	203447	203447	Saxon	810	' It appears that he was much disturbed in his mind over the cruelties which were inflicted on the country folk after the battle at Bridgewater . Being a man of a somewhat stern and fierce turn of mind , his disapproval did vent itself in actions rather than words . Soldiers were found here and there over the countryside pistolled or stabbed , and no trace left of their assailant . A dozen or more were cut off in this way , and soon it came to be whispered about that Marot the highwayman was the man that did it , and the chase became hot at his heels . '
203561	203568	203569	203569	I	0	' Well , and what then ? '
203786	203791	203798	203798	his	810	' I had heard , '
203801	203941	203798	203798	his	810	' that Marot was a man of this kidney , and also that he was so compassed round that he was in peril of capture . I sought him out , therefore , and held council with him . His mare , it seems , had been slain by some chance shot , and as he was much attached to the brute , the accident made him more savage and more dangerous than ever . He had no heart , he said , to continue in his old trade . Indeed , he was ripe for anything -- the very stuff out of which useful tools are made . I found that in his youth he had had a training for the sea . When I heard that , I saw my way in the snap of a petronel . '
203942	203946	203947	203947	I	0	' What then ? '
203950	203958	203947	203947	I	0	' I am still in the dark . '
203959	204134	203798	203798	his	810	' Nay , it is surely plain enough to you now . Marot 's end was to baffle his pursuers and to benefit the exiles . How could he do this better than by engaging as a seaman aboard this brig , the _ Dorothy Fox _ , and sailing away from England in her ? There are but thirty of a crew . Below hatches are close on two hundred men , who , simple as they may be , are , as you and I know , second to none in the cut - and - thrust work , without order or discipline , which will be needed in such an affair . Marot has but to go down amongst them some dark night , knock off their anklets , and fit them up with a few stanchions or cudgels . Ho , ho , Micah ! what think you ? The planters may dig their plantations themselves for all the help they are like to get from West countrymen this bout . '
204135	204147	204149	204149	I.	6812	' It is , indeed , a well - conceived plan , '
204150	204198	204149	204149	I.	6812	' It is a pity , Saxon , that your ready wit and quick invention hath not had a fair field . You are , us I know well , as fit to command armies and to order campaigns as any man that ever bore a truncheon . '

204214	204308	204206	204206	Saxon	810	' See where the moonlight falls beside the hatchway ! Do you not see that short squat seaman who stands alone , lost in thought , with his head sunk upon his breast ? It is Marot ! I tell you that if I were Captain Pogram I would rather have the devil himself , horns , hoofs , and tail , for my first mate and bunk companion , than have that man aboard my ship . You need not concern yourself about the prisoners , Micah . Their future is decided . '

It will be good to get to some profitable employment , for such a war , without either fighting or plunder , I have never seen . I give you my word that I have scarce fingered silver since the beginning of it . I would not for the sacking of London go through with it again . '

There is naught else save to assure all in Havant that a King who hath battened upon his subjects , as this one of ours hath done , is not one who is like to keep his seat very long upon the throne of England .

Then , taking the candle and going up the stairs , there was a wet cloth thrown at them , but it fell on the stairs . They , going up further , there was another thrown as before . And when they were come up into the chamber there stood a bowl of water , looking white , as though soap had been used in it . The bowl just before was in the kitchen , and could not be carried up but through the room where they were . The next thing was a terrible noise , like a clap of thunder , and shortly afterwards they heard a great scratching about the bedstead , and after that great knocking with a hammer against the bed's - head , so that the two maids that were in bed cried out for help . Then they ran up the stairs , and there lay the hammer on the bed , and on the bed's - head there were near a thousand prints of the hammer . The maids said that they were scratched and pinched with a hand which had exceeding long nails .

He used the tongs to lift a coal to light his pipe , and by - and - by the tongs were drawn up the stairs and were cast upon the bed . The same night one of the maids left her shoes by the fire , and they were carried up into the chamber , and the old man 's brought down and set in their places . As they were going upstairs there were many things thrown at them which were just before in the low room , and when they went down the stairs the old man 's breeches were thrown down after them .

For about ten or twelve years '
210014	210573	210661	210661	Monmouth	748	' But now , in this the girl 's great extremity , God , the great physician , dictates to her , then languishing in her miserable , hopeless condition , what course to take and what to do for a cure , which was to go and touch the Duke of Monmouth . The girl told her mother that , if she could but touch the Duke she would be well . The mother reproved her for her foolish conceit , but the girl did often persuade her mother to go to Lackington to the Duke , who then lay with Mr. Speaks . " Certainly , " said she , " I should be well if I could touch him . " The mother slighted these pressing requests , but the more she slighted and reproved , the more earnest the girl was for it . A few days after , the girl having noticed that Sir John Sydenham intended to treat the Duke at White Lodge in Henton Park , this girl with many of her neighbours went to the said park . She being there timely waited the Duke 's coming . When first she observed the Duke she pressed in among a crowd of people and caught him by the hand , his glove being on , and she likewise having a glove to cover her wounds . She not being herewith satisfied at the first attempt of touching his glove only , but her mind was she must touch some part of his bare skin , she , weighing his coming forth , intended a second attempt . The poor girl , thus between hope and fear , waited his motion . On a sudden there was news of the Duke 's coming on , which she to be prepared rent off her glove , that was clung to the sores , in such haste that she broke her glove , and brought away not only the sores but the skin . The Duke 's glove , as Providence would have it , the upper part hung down , so that his hand - wrist was bare . She pressed on , and caught him by the bare hand - wrist with her running hand , crying , " God bless your highness ! " and the Duke said " God bless you ! " The girl , not a little transported at her good success , came and assured her friends that she would now be well . She came home to her mother in great joy , and told her that she had touched the Duke 's hand . The mother , hearing what she had done , reproved her sharply for her boldness , asked how she durst do such a thing , and threatened to beat her for it . She cried out , " Oh , mother , I shall be well again , and healed of my wounds ! " And as God Almighty would have it , to the wonder and admiration of all , the six wounds were speedily dried up , the eye became perfectly well , and the girl was in good health . All which has been discovered to us by the mother and daughter , and by neighbours that know her .

We pick them up every houre in cornfields and ditches . Williams , the late Duke 's valet de chambre , is taken , who gives a very ingenious account of the whole affair , which is too long to write . The last word that he said to him was at the time when his army fled , that he was undone and must shift for himself . We think to march with the General this day to Wells , on his way homeward . At present he is 3 miles off at the camp , soe I ca n't certainly tell whether he intends for Wells . I shall be home certainly on Saturday at farthest .

211396	212225	211370	211370	His	882	' Now besides these two troops , whose officers though they had no great skill yet had courage enough to have done something honourably , had they not for want of a guide met with the aforesaid obstruction , there was no one of all the rest of our troops that ever advanced to charge or approached as near to the enemy as to give or receive a wound . Mr. Hacker , one of our captains , came no sooner within view of their camp than he villainously fired a pistol to give them notice of our approach , and then forsook his charge and rode oft with all the speed he could , to take the benefit of a proclamation emitted by the King , offering pardon to all such as should return home within such a time . And this he pleaded at his tryal , but was answered by Jeffreys " that he above all other men deserved to be hanged , and that for his treachery to Monmouth as well as his treason to the King . " And though no other of our officers acted so villainously , yet they were useless and unserviceable , as never once attempting to charge , nor so much as keeping their men in a body . And I dare affirm that if our horse had never fired a pistol , but only stood in a posture to have given jealousy and apprehension to the enemy , our foot alone would have carried the day and been triumphant . But our horse standing scattered and disunited , and flying upon every approach of a squadron of theirs , commanded by Oglethorpe , gave that body of their cavalry an advantage , after they had hovered up and down in the field without thinking it necessary to attack those whom their own fears had dispersed , to fall in at last in the rear of our battalions , and to wrest that victory out of their hands which they were grasping at , and stood almost possessed of . Nor was that party of their horse above three hundred at most , whereas we had more than enough had they had any courage , and been commanded by a gallant man , to have attacked them with ease both in front and flank . These things I can declare with more certainty , because I was a doleful spectator of them ; for having contrary to my custom left attending upon the Duke , who advanced with the foot , I betook myself to the horse , because the first of that morning 's action was expected from them , which was to break in and disorder the enemy 's camp . Against the time that our battalions should come up , I endeavoured whatsoever I was capable of performing , for I not only struck at several troopers who had forsaken their station , but upbraided divers of the captains for being wanting in their duty . But I spoke with great warmth to my Lord Grey , and conjured him to charge , and not suffer the victory , which our foot had in a manner taken hold of , to be ravished from us . But instead of hearkening , he not only as an unworthy man and cowardly poltroon deserted that part of the field and forsook his command , but rode with the utmost speed to the Duke , telling him that all was lost and it was more than time to shift for himself . Wherebye , as an addition to all the mischief he had been the occasion of before , he drew the easy and unfortunate gentleman to leave the battalions while they were courageously disputing on which side the victory should fall . And this fell most unhappily out , while a certain person was endeavouring to find out the Duke to have begged of him to come and charge at the head of his own troops . However , this I dare affirm , that if the Duke had been but master of two hundred horse , well mounted , completely armed , personally valiant , and commanded by experienced officers , they would have been victorious . This is acknowledged by our enemies , who have often confessed they were ready to fly through the impressions made upon them by our foot , and must have been beaten had our horse done their part , and not tamely looked on till their cavalry retrieved the day by falling into the rear of our battalions . Nor was the fault in the private men , who had courage to have followed their leaders , but it was in those who led them , particularly my Lord Grey , in whom , if cowardice may be called treachery , we may safely charge him with betraying our cause .
