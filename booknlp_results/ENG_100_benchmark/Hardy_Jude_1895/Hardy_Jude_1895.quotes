628	633	635	636	Mr. Phillotson	163	" So am I , "
638	646	648	649	the boy	437	" Why do you go , sir ? "
651	680	648	649	the boy	437	" Ah - that would be a long story . You would n't understand my reasons , Jude . You will , perhaps , when you are older . "
681	690	635	636	Mr. Phillotson	163	" I think I should now , sir . "
691	801	802	803	The smith	440	" Well - do n't speak of this everywhere . You know what a university is , and a university degree ? It is the necessary hallmark of a man who wants to do anything in teaching . My scheme , or dream , is to be a university graduate , and then to be ordained . By going to live at Christminster , or near it , I shall be at headquarters , so to speak , and if my scheme is practicable at all , I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should have elsewhere .

900	909	910	910	he	163	" I sha n't forget you , Jude , "
921	961	910	910	he	163	" Be a good boy , remember ; and be kind to animals and birds , and read all you can . And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt me out for old acquaintance ' sake . "

2136	2306	2129	2129	she	167	" I 'm sure he could n't ha ' took a better one . The boy is crazy for books , that he is . It runs in our family rather . His cousin Sue is just the same - so I 've heard ; but I have not seen the child for years , though she was born in this place , within these four walls , as it happened . My niece and her husband , after they were married , didn ' get a house of their own for some year or more ; and then they only had one till - Well , I wo n't go into that . Jude , my child , do n't you ever marry . ' Tisn't for the Fawleys to take that step any more . She , their only one , was like a child o ' my own , Belinda , till the split come !

3152	3240	3132	3132	himself	561	" So it 's ' Eat my dear birdies , ' is it , young man ? ' Eat , dear birdies , ' indeed ! I 'll tickle your breeches , and see if you say , ' Eat , dear birdies , ' again in a hurry ! And you 've been idling at the schoolmaster 's too , instead of coming here , ha'n't ye , hey ? That 's how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn ! "
3309	3323	3325	3327	the whirling child	563	" Do n't ' ee , sir - please do n't ' ee ! "
3374	3437	3325	3327	the whirling child	563	" I - I sir - only meant that - there was a good crop in the ground - I saw 'em sow it - and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner - and you would n't miss it , sir - and Mr. Phillotson said I was to be kind to 'em - oh , oh , oh ! "
3957	3977	3954	3954	she	555	" Well , how do you come to be back here in the middle of the morning like this ? "
3978	3984	3954	3954	she	555	" I 'm turned away . "
3985	3988	3954	3954	she	555	" What ? "
3989	4021	4022	4022	He	180	" Mr. Troutham have turned me away because I let the rooks have a few peckings of corn . And there 's my wages - the last I shall ever hae ! "

' His father was my father 's journeyman , anyhow , and I must have been a fool to let ' ee go to work for ' n , which I should n't ha ' done but to keep ' ee out of mischty . "
4218	4285	4200	4200	she	596	" Not that you should have let the birds eat what Farmer Troutham planted . Of course you was wrong in that . Jude , Jude , why didstn't go off with that schoolmaster of thine to Christminster or somewhere ? But , oh no - poor or'nary child - there never was any sprawl on thy side of the family , and never will be ! "
4286	4304	4306	4307	the boy	437	" Where is this beautiful city , Aunt - this place where Mr. Phillotson is gone to ? "
4314	4362	4306	4307	the boy	437	" Lord ! you ought to know where the city of Christminster is . Near a score of miles from here . It is a place much too good for you ever to have much to do with , poor boy , I 'm a - thinking . "
4363	4372	4200	4200	she	596	" And will Mr. Phillotson always be there ? "
4373	4379	4200	4200	she	596	" How can I tell ? "
4380	4388	4306	4307	the boy	437	" Could I go to see him ? "
4389	4429	4200	4200	she	596	" Lord , no ! You did n't grow up hereabout , or you would n't ask such as that . We 've never had anything to do with folk in Christminster , nor folk in Christminster with we . "
4716	4748	4749	4750	The man	607	" Christminster ? Oh , well , out by there yonder ; though I 've never bin there - not I. I 've never had any business at such a place . "

5242	5258	5222	5222	he	180	" I wanted to know where the city of Christminster is , if you please . "
5259	5293	5222	5222	he	180	" Christminster is out across there , by that clump . You can see it - at least you can on a clear day . Ah , no , you ca n't now . "
5321	5333	5334	5334	he	637	" You ca n't often see it in weather like this , "
5337	5368	5334	5334	he	637	" The time I 've noticed it is when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame , and it looks like - I do n't know what . "

5380	5405	5406	5407	The boy	437	" Ay - though I should never ha ' thought of it myself .... But I ca n't see no Christminster to - day . "
6159	6737	6738	6738	You	678	" window , with its twenty - four little panes set in lead - work , the glass of some of them oxidized with age , so that you could hardly see the poor penny articles exhibited within , and forming part of a stock which a strong man could have carried , Jude had his outer being for some long tideless time . But his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings were small . Through the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward he was always beholding a gorgeous city - the fancied place he had likened to the new Jerusalem , though there was perhaps more of the painter 's imagination and less of the diamond merchant 's in his dreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer . And the city acquired a tangibility , a permanence , a hold on his life , mainly from the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes he had so much reverence was actually living there ; not only so , but living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein . In sad wet seasons , though he knew it must rain at Christminster too , he could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there . Whenever he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two , which was not often , he would steal off to the Brown House on the hill and strain his eyes persistently ; sometimes to be rewarded by the sight of a dome or spire , at other times by a little smoke , which in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense . Then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended to the point of view after dark , or possibly went a mile or two further , he would see the night lights of the city . It would be necessary to come back alone , but even that consideration did not deter him , for he could throw a little manliness into his mood , no doubt . The project was duly executed . It was not late when he arrived at the place of outlook , only just after dusk , but a black north - east sky , accompanied by a wind from the same quarter , made the occasion dark enough . He was rewarded ; but what he saw was not the lamps in rows , as he had half expected . No individual light was visible , only a halo or glow - fog over - arching the place against the black heavens behind it , making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or so . He set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the schoolmaster might be - he who never communicated with anybody at Marygreen now ; who was as if dead to them here . In the glow he seemed to see Phillotson promenading at ease , like one of the forms in Nebuchadnezzar 's furnace . He had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour , and the fact now came into his mind . He parted his lips as he faced the north - east , and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor . "
6740	6748	6738	6738	You	678	" he said , addressing the breeze caressingly "
6799	6847	6793	6793	you	678	" Suddenly there came along this wind something towards him - a message from the place - from some soul residing there , it seemed . Surely it was the sound of bells , the voice of the city , faint and musical , calling to him , "
6853	7022	6793	6793	you	678	" He had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this mental leap , and only got back to it by a rough recalling . A few yards below the brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses made its appearance , having reached the place by dint of half an hour 's serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity . They had a load of coals behind them - a fuel that could only be got into the upland by this particular route . They were accompanied by a carter , a second man , and a boy , who now kicked a large stone behind one of the wheels , and allowed the panting animals to have a long rest , while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged in a drink round . They were elderly men , and had genial voices . Jude addressed them , inquiring if they had come from Christminster . "
7030	7034	6793	6793	you	678	" said they . "
7044	7089	6793	6793	you	678	" He was getting so romantically attached to Christminster that , like a young lover alluding to his mistress , he felt bashful at mentioning its name again . He pointed to the light in the sky - hardly perceptible to their older eyes . "
7124	7175	7178	7179	young man	3930	" Here a little book of tales which Jude had tucked up under his arm , having brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark , slipped and fell into the road . The carter eyed him while he picked it up and straightened the leaves . "
7181	7185	7178	7179	young man	3930	" he observed , "
7206	7207	7202	7202	they	684	" "
7210	7215	7202	7202	they	684	" asked the boy . "
7230	7242	7218	7218	they	684	" the carter continued , by way of passing the time . "
7458	7459	7470	7470	you	187	" "
7465	7466	7463	7463	you	187	" "
7660	7758	7652	7652	I	0	" By this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their collars again . Jude , throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo , turned and walked beside his remarkably well - informed friend , who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city - its towers and halls and churches . The waggon turned into a cross - road , whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his information , and said he only wished he could talk half as well about Christminster as he . "
7771	7777	7652	7652	I	0	" said the carter unboastfully . "
7874	8015	7860	7860	I	0	" Jude continued his walk homeward alone , pondering so deeply that he forgot to feel timid . He suddenly grew older . It had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on , to cling to - for some place which he could call admirable . Should he find that place in this city if he could get there ? Would it be a spot in which , without fear of farmers , or hindrance , or ridicule , he could watch and wait , and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the men of old of whom he had heard ? As the halo had been to his eyes when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier , so was the spot mentally to him as he pursued his dark way . "
8023	8029	7860	7860	I	0	" he said to himself . "
8037	8046	7860	7860	I	0	" he added a few steps further on . "
8061	8062	8054	8054	men	716	" "
8078	8093	8054	8054	men	716	" After this figure he was silent a long while , till he added : "
8100	8208	8054	8054	men	716	" IV Walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration , the boy - an ancient man in some phases of thought , much younger than his years in others - was overtaken by a light - footed pedestrian , whom , notwithstanding the gloom , he could perceive to be wearing an extraordinarily tall hat , a swallow - tailed coat , and a watch - chain that danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky - light as its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots . Jude , beginning to feel lonely , endeavoured to keep up with him . "
8242	8243	8236	8236	you	719	" "
8252	8253	8249	8250	Physician Vilbert	189	" "
8272	8499	8500	8500	I	0	" Vilbert was an itinerant quack - doctor , well known to the rustic population , and absolutely unknown to anybody else , as he , indeed , took care to be , to avoid inconvenient investigations . Cottagers formed his only patients , and his Wessex - wide repute was among them alone . His position was humbler and his field more obscure than those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of advertising . He was , in fact , a survival . The distances he traversed on foot were enormous , and extended nearly the whole length and breadth of Wessex . Jude had one day seen him selling a pot of coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg , the woman arranging to pay a guinea , in instalments of a shilling a fortnight , for the precious salve , which , according to the physician , could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on Mount Sinai , and was to be captured only at great risk to life and limb . Jude , though he already had his doubts about this gentleman 's medicines , felt him to be unquestionably a travelled personage , and one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not strictly professional . "
8510	8511	8508	8508	Physician	721	" "
8518	8525	8512	8512	I	0	" replied the long thin man . "

8779	8814	8764	8764	I	0	" said Jude gratefully , but in gasps , for the amazing speed of the physician 's walk kept him in a dog - trot which was giving him a stitch in the side . "
8879	8880	8837	8837	I	0	" "
8889	8890	8837	8837	I	0	" "
8928	8929	8913	8913	My	0	" "
8938	8942	8931	8931	I	0	" said Jude . "
8949	8950	8953	8953	Physician	721	" "
8955	9199	8953	8953	Physician	721	" Jude then dropped behind , waited a few minutes to recover breath , and went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for Christminster . Through the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly at his inward thoughts , as if they were people meeting and nodding to him - smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen to spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea , as if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures , giving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then . He honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures , in whom he now sincerely believed , walking miles hither and thither among the surrounding hamlets as the Physician 's agent in advance . On the evening appointed he stood motionless on the plateau , at the place where he had parted from Vilbert , and there awaited his approach . The road - physician was fairly up to time ; but , to the surprise of Jude on striking into his pace , which the pedestrian did not diminish by a single unit of force , the latter seemed hardly to recognize his young companion , though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings had grown light . Jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his wearing another hat , and he saluted the physician with dignity . "
9205	9211	8953	8953	Physician	721	" said the latter abstractedly . "
9216	9220	9221	9221	You	0	" said Jude . "
9240	9241	9238	9238	lad	741	" "
9244	9281	9238	9238	lad	741	" And Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers who were willing to test the virtues of the world - renowned pills and salve . The quack mentally registered these with great care . "
9289	9297	9238	9238	lad	741	" Jude 's voice trembled with anxiety . "
9302	9303	9300	9300	them	742	" "
9320	9321	9304	9304	You	0	" "
9365	9389	9390	9390	You	0	" Jude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth ; and he repeated , in a voice of dry misery , "
9396	9397	9390	9390	You	0	" "
9421	10687	9413	9413	I	0	" Jude dropped behind . He was an unsophisticated boy , but the gift of sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of . There was to be no intellectual light from this source . The leaves dropped from his imaginary crown of laurel ; he turned to a gate , leant against it , and cried bitterly . The disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness . He might , perhaps , have obtained grammars from Alfredston , but to do that required money , and a knowledge of what books to order ; and though physically comfortable , he was in such absolute dependence as to be without a farthing of his own . At this date Mr. Phillotson sent for his pianoforte , and it gave Jude a lead . Why should he not write to the schoolmaster , and ask him to be so kind as to get him the grammars in Christminster ? He might slip a letter inside the case of the instrument , and it would be sure to reach the desired eyes . Why not ask him to send any old second - hand copies , which would have the charm of being mellowed by the university atmosphere ? To tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it . It was necessary to act alone . After a further consideration of a few days he did act , and on the day of the piano 's departure , which happened to be his next birthday , clandestinely placed the letter inside the packing - case , directed to his much - admired friend , being afraid to reveal the operation to his aunt Drusilla , lest she should discover his motive , and compel him to abandon his scheme . The piano was despatched , and Jude waited days and weeks , calling every morning at the cottage post office before his great - aunt was stirring . At last a packet did indeed arrive at the village , and he saw from the ends of it that it contained two thin books . He took it away into a lonely place , and sat down on a felled elm to open it . Ever since his first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its possibilities , Jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one language into those of another . He concluded that a grammar of the required tongue would contain , primarily , a rule , prescription , or clue of the nature of a secret cipher , which , once known , would enable him , by merely applying it , to change at will all words of his own speech into those of the foreign one . His childish idea was , in fact , a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is everywhere known as Grimm 's Law - an aggrandizement of rough rules to ideal completeness . Thus he assumed that the words of the required language were always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the given language by those who had the art to uncover them , such art being furnished by the books aforesaid . When , therefore , having noted that the packet bore the postmark of Christminster , he cut the string , opened the volumes , and turned to the Latin grammar , which chanced to come uppermost , he could scarcely believe his eyes . The book was an old one - thirty years old , soiled , scribbled wantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the letterpress , and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier than his own day . But this was not the cause of Jude 's amazement . He learnt for the first time that there was no law of transmutation , as in his innocence he had supposed there was , in some degree , but the grammarian did not recognize it , but that every word in both Latin and Greek was to be individually committed to memory at the cost of years of plodding . Jude flung down the books , lay backward along the broad trunk of the elm , and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of an hour . As he had often done before , he pulled his hat over his face and watched the sun peering insidiously at him through the interstices of the straw . This was Latin and Greek , then , was it this grand delusion ! The charm he had supposed in store for him was really a labour like that of Israel in Egypt . What brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools , he presently thought , to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands ! There were no brains in his head equal to this business ; and as the little sun - rays continued to stream in through his hat at him , he wished he had never seen a book , that he might never see another , that he had never been born . Somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his trouble , and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were further advanced than those of his grammarian . But nobody did come , because nobody does ; and under the crushing recognition of his gigantic error Jude continued to wish himself out of the world . V During the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular vehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and by - roads near Marygreen , driven in a quaint and singular way . In the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books Jude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead languages . In fact , his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had , after a while , been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of Christminster . To acquire languages , departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as he now knew them inherently to possess , was a herculean performance which gradually led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent process . The mountain - weight of material under which the ideas lay in those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him into a dogged , mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal . He had endeavoured to make his presence tolerable to his crusty maiden aunt by assisting her to the best of his ability , and the business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence . An aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at a sale , a creaking cart with a whity - brown tilt obtained for a few pounds more , and in this turn - out it became Jude 's business thrice a week to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters immediately round Marygreen . The singularity aforesaid lay , after all , less in the conveyance itself than in Jude 's manner of conducting it along its route . Its interior was the scene of most of Jude 's education by "
10691	11022	9413	9413	I	0	" As soon as the horse had learnt the road and the houses at which he was to pause awhile , the boy , seated in front , would slip the reins over his arm , ingeniously fix open , by means of a strap attached to the tilt , the volume he was reading , spread the dictionary on his knees , and plunge into the simpler passages from Caesar , Virgil , or Horace , as the case might be , in his purblind stumbling way , and with an expenditure of labour that would have made a tender - hearted pedagogue shed tears ; yet somehow getting at the meaning of what he read , and divining rather than beholding the spirit of the original , which often to his mind was something else than that which he was taught to look for . The only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old Delphin editions , because they were superseded , and therefore cheap . But , bad for idle schoolboys , it did so happen that they were passably good for him . The hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously covered up the marginal readings , and used them merely on points of construction , as he would have used a comrade or tutor who should have happened to be passing by . And though Jude may have had little chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means , he was in the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow . While he was busied with these ancient pages , which had already been thumbed by hands possibly in the grave , digging out the thoughts of these minds so remote yet so near , the bony old horse pursued his rounds , and Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the stoppage of his cart and the voice of some old woman crying , "
11037	11377	11031	11031	I	0	" He was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without his seeing them , and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood began to talk about his method of combining work and play such they considered his reading to be , which , though probably convenient enough to himself , was not altogether a safe proceeding for other travellers along the same roads . There were murmurs . Then a private resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the baker 's boy should not be allowed to read while driving , and insisted that it was the constable 's duty to catch him in the act , and take him to the police court at Alfredston , and get him fined for dangerous practices on the highway . The policeman thereupon lay in wait for Jude , and one day accosted him and cautioned him . As Jude had to get up at three o'clock in the morning to heat the oven , and mix and set in the bread that he distributed later in the day , he was obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying the sponge ; so that if he could not read his classics on the highways he could hardly study at all . The only thing to be done was , therefore , to keep a sharp eye ahead and around him as well as he could in the circumstances , and slip away his books as soon as anybody loomed in the distance , the policeman in particular . To do that official justice , he did not put himself much in the way of Jude 's bread - cart , considering that in such a lonely district the chief danger was to Jude himself , and often on seeing the white tilt over the hedges he would move in another direction . On a day when Fawley was getting quite advanced , being now about sixteen , and had been stumbling through the "
11381	11539	11031	11031	I	0	" on his way home , he found himself to be passing over the high edge of the plateau by the Brown House . The light had changed , and it was the sense of this which had caused him to look up . The sun was going down , and the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in the opposite quarter . His mind had become so impregnated with the poem that , in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years before had caused him to kneel on the ladder , he stopped the horse , alighted , and glancing round to see that nobody was in sight , knelt down on the roadside bank with open book . He turned first to the shiny goddess , who seemed to look so softly and critically at his doings , then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand , as he began : "
11545	12575	11543	11543	Diana	199	" The horse stood still till he had finished the hymn , which Jude repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never have thought of humouring in broad daylight . Reaching home , he mused over his curious superstition , innate or acquired , in doing this , and the strange forgetfulness which had led to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished , next to being a scholar , to be a Christian divine . It had all come of reading heathen works exclusively . The more he thought of it the more convinced he was of his inconsistency . He began to wonder whether he could be reading quite the right books for his object in life . Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan literature and the mediaeval colleges at Christminster , that ecclesiastical romance in stone . Ultimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken up a wrong emotion for a Christian young man . He had dabbled in Clarke 's Homer , but had never yet worked much at the New Testament in the Greek , though he possessed a copy , obtained by post from a second - hand bookseller . He abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a new dialect , and for a long time onward limited his reading almost entirely to the Gospels and Epistles in Griesbach 's text . Moreover , on going into Alfredston one day , he was introduced to patristic literature by finding at the bookseller 's some volumes of the Fathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the neighbourhood . As another outcome of this change of groove he visited on Sundays all the churches within a walk , and deciphered the Latin inscriptions on fifteenth - century brasses and tombs . On one of these pilgrimages he met with a hunch - backed old woman of great intelligence , who read everything she could lay her hands on , and she told him more yet of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore . Thither he resolved as firmly as ever to go . But how live in that city ? At present he had no income at all . He had no trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which he could subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which might spread over many years . What was most required by citizens ? Food , clothing , and shelter . An income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre ; for making the second he felt a distaste ; the preparation of the third requisite he inclined to . They built in a city ; therefore he would learn to build . He thought of his unknown uncle , his cousin Susanna 's father , an ecclesiastical worker in metal , and somehow mediaeval art in any material was a trade for which he had rather a fancy . He could not go far wrong in following his uncle 's footsteps , and engaging himself awhile with the carcases that contained the scholar souls . As a preliminary he obtained some small blocks of freestone , metal not being available , and suspending his studies awhile , occupied his spare half - hours in copying the heads and capitals in his parish church . There was a stone - mason of a humble kind in Alfredston , and as soon as he had found a substitute for himself in his aunt 's little business , he offered his services to this man for a trifling wage . Here Jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of freestone - working . Some time later he went to a church - builder in the same place , and under the architect 's direction became handy at restoring the dilapidated masonries of several village churches round about . Not forgetting that he was only following up this handicraft as a prop to lean on while he prepared those greater engines which he flattered himself would be better fitted for him , he yet was interested in his pursuit on its own account . He now had lodgings during the week in the little town , whence he returned to Marygreen village every Saturday evening . And thus he reached and passed his nineteenth year . VI At this memorable date of his life he was , one Saturday , returning from Alfredston to Marygreen about three o'clock in the afternoon . It was fine , warm , and soft summer weather , and he walked with his tools at his back , his little chisels clinking faintly against the larger ones in his basket . It being the end of the week he had left work early , and had come out of the town by a round - about route which he did not usually frequent , having promised to call at a flour - mill near Cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt . He was in an enthusiastic mood . He seemed to see his way to living comfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two , and knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which he had dreamed so much . He might , of course , have gone there now , in some capacity or other , but he preferred to enter the city with a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at present . A warm self - content suffused him when he considered what he had already done . Now and then as he went along he turned to face the peeps of country on either side of him . But he hardly saw them ; the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when less occupied ; and the one matter which really engaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far . "
12596	12626	12627	12627	I	0	" This was true , Jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with great ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary conversations therein . "
12718	12746	12747	12747	I	0	" I have done some mathematics , including the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books of Euclid ; and algebra as far as simple equations . "
12762	12866	12867	12867	I	0	" These things are only a beginning . But I shall not make much farther advance here , from the difficulty of getting books . Hence I must next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster . Once there I shall so advance , with the assistance I shall there get , that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish ignorance . I must save money , and I will ; and one of those colleges shall open its doors to me - shall welcome whom now it would spurn , if I wait twenty years for the welcome . "
12876	12992	12867	12867	I	0	" And then he continued to dream , and thought he might become even a bishop by leading a pure , energetic , wise , Christian life . And what an example he would set ! If his income were L5000 a year , he would give away L4500 in one form and another , and live sumptuously for him on the remainder . Well , on second thoughts , a bishop was absurd . He would draw the line at an archdeacon . Perhaps a man could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of archdeacon as in that of bishop . Yet he thought of the bishop again . "
13032	13033	13030	13030	Aristophanes	212	" "
13044	13072	13074	13074	Euripides	213	" The sounds were expressed in light voices on the other side of the hedge , but he did not notice them . His thoughts went on : "
13118	13119	13095	13096	the Fathers	749	" "
13124	13125	13095	13096	the Fathers	749	" "
13175	13463	13465	13465	you	753	" In his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude 's walk had slackened , and he was now standing quite still , looking at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern . On a sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear , and he became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him , and had fallen at his feet . A glance told him what it was - a piece of flesh , the characteristic part of a barrow - pig , which the countrymen used for greasing their boots , as it was useless for any other purpose . Pigs were rather plentiful hereabout , being bred and fattened in large numbers in certain parts of North Wessex . On the other side of the hedge was a stream , whence , as he now for the first time realized , had come the slight sounds of voices and laughter that had mingled with his dreams . He mounted the bank and looked over the fence . On the further side of the stream stood a small homestead , having a garden and pig - sties attached ; in front of it , beside the brook , three young women were kneeling , with buckets and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs ' chitterlings , which they were washing in the running water . One or two pairs of eyes slyly glanced up , and perceiving that his attention had at last been attracted , and that he was watching them , they braced themselves for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity . "
13467	13472	13465	13465	you	753	" said Jude severely . "
13482	13500	13478	13478	I	0	" asserted one girl to her neighbour , as if unconscious of the young man 's presence . "
13504	13509	13502	13502	I	0	" the second answered . "
13518	13523	13516	13516	you	221	" said the third . "
13539	13540	13516	13516	you	221	" "
13550	13583	13543	13543	I	0	" And they laughed and continued their work , without looking up , still ostentatiously accusing each other . Jude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face , and caught their remarks . "
13593	13713	13584	13584	YOU	755	" he said to the up - stream one of the three . She whom he addressed was a fine dark - eyed girl , not exactly handsome , but capable of passing as such at a little distance , despite some coarseness of skin and fibre . She had a round and prominent bosom , full lips , perfect teeth , and the rich complexion of a Cochin hen 's egg . She was a complete and substantial female animal - no more , no less ; and Jude was almost certain that to her was attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him . "
13721	13726	13715	13715	you	756	" said she deedily . "
13738	13739	13715	13715	you	756	" "
13746	13747	13715	13715	you	756	" "
13759	13760	13749	13749	you	755	" "
13769	13770	13749	13749	you	755	" "
13786	13921	13778	13778	you	755	" Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity ; for somehow or other the eyes of the brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words , and there was a momentary flash of intelligence , a dumb announcement of affinity in posse between herself and him , which , so far as Jude Fawley was concerned , had no sort of premeditation in it . She saw that he had singled her out from the three , as a woman is singled out in such cases , for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance , but in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters , unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of their lives is to be occupied with the feminine . Springing to her feet , she said : "
13929	14173	13778	13778	you	755	" Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her father 's business had prompted her signal to him . He set down his basket of tools , picked up the scrap of offal , beat a pathway for himself with his stick , and got over the hedge . They walked in parallel lines , one on each bank of the stream , towards the small plank bridge . As the girl drew nearer to it , she gave without Jude perceiving it , an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her cheeks in succession , by which curious and original manoeuvre she brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect dimple , which she was able to retain there as long as she continued to smile . This production of dimples at will was a not unknown operation , which many attempted , but only a few succeeded in accomplishing . They met in the middle of the plank , and Jude , tossing back her missile , seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him . But she , slyly looking in another direction , swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge ; till , moved by amatory curiosity , she turned her eyes critically upon him . "
14185	14186	14174	14174	You	758	" "
14190	14191	14174	14174	You	758	" "
14215	14225	14209	14209	He	3941	" She nodded towards the fragment on the grass . "
14238	14258	14209	14209	He	3941	" Jude asked , politely accepting her assertion , though he had very large doubts as to its truth . "
14271	14272	14267	14267	I	0	" "
14284	14285	14277	14277	I	0	" "
14297	14298	14291	14291	I	0	" "
14301	14302	14291	14291	I	0	" "
14311	14312	14306	14306	I	0	" "
14337	14338	14339	14339	My	0	" "
14364	14508	14348	14349	these girls	768	" They talked a little more and a little more , as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the hand - rail of the bridge . The unvoiced call of woman to man , which was uttered very distinctly by Arabella 's personality , held Jude to the spot against his intention - almost against his will , and in a way new to his experience . It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this moment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such , but had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes . He gazed from her eyes to her mouth , thence to her bosom , and to her full round naked arms , wet , mottled with the chill of the water , and firm as marble . "
14518	14537	14348	14349	these girls	768	" he murmured , though the words had not been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism . "
14546	14551	14348	14349	these girls	768	" she said piquantly . "
14559	14562	14348	14349	these girls	768	" he answered "
14589	14615	14617	14617	you	769	" She had spoken this without a smile , and the dimples disappeared . Jude felt himself drifting strangely , but could not help it . "
14621	14622	14623	14623	I	0	" "
14628	14672	14623	14623	I	0	" By this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning her face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking operation before mentioned , Jude being still unconscious of more than a general impression of her appearance . "
14676	14680	14623	14623	I	0	" he hazarded . "
14688	14689	14617	14617	you	769	" "
14692	14693	14617	14617	you	769	" "
14698	14699	14695	14695	I	0	" "
14702	14842	14695	14695	I	0	" She brightened with a little glow of triumph , swept him almost tenderly with her eyes in turning , and retracing her steps down the brookside grass rejoined her companions . Jude Fawley shouldered his tool - basket and resumed his lonely way , filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze . He had just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere , which had evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went , for he knew not how long , but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass . The intentions as to reading , working , and learning , which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes earlier , were suffering a curious collapse into a corner , he knew not how . "
14853	15075	14695	14695	I	0	" he said to himself , faintly conscious that to common sense there was something lacking , and still more obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had drawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her - something in her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream . It had been no vestal who chose THAT missile for opening her attack on him . He saw this with his intellectual eye , just for a short ; fleeting while , as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness . And then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn , and Jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure , that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected , though it had lain close beside him . He was to meet this enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday . Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions , and she silently resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid stream . "
15082	15090	14695	14695	I	0	" laconically asked the girl called Anny . "
15106	15111	15112	15112	Lord	3952	" regretfully murmured Arabella . "
15170	15171	15167	15167	they	778	" "
15196	15197	15189	15189	you	776	" "
15310	16037	16038	16038	Arabella	305	" VII The next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping ceiling , looking at the books on the table , and then at the black mark on the plaster above them , made by the smoke of his lamp in past months . It was Sunday afternoon , four - and - twenty hours after his meeting with Arabella Donn . During the whole bygone week he had been resolving to set this afternoon apart for a special purpose , - the re - reading of his Greek Testament - his new one , with better type than his old copy , following Griesbach 's text as amended by numerous correctors , and with variorum readings in the margin . He was proud of the book , having obtained it by boldly writing to its London publisher , a thing he had never done before . He had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon 's reading , under the quiet roof of his great - aunt 's house as formerly , where he now slept only two nights a week . But a new thing , a great hitch , had happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life , and he felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter skin , and can not understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its new one . He would not go out to meet her , after all . He sat down , opened the book , and with his elbows firmly planted on the table , and his hands to his temples , began at the beginning : HE KAINE DIATHEKE Had he promised to call for her ? Surely he had ! She would wait indoors , poor girl , and waste all her afternoon on account of him . There was a something in her , too , which was very winning , apart from promises . He ought not to break faith with her . Even though he had only Sundays and week - day evenings for reading he could afford one afternoon , seeing that other young men afforded so many . After to - day he would never probably see her again . Indeed , it would be impossible , considering what his plans were . In short , as if materially , a compelling arm of extraordinary muscular power seized hold of him - something which had nothing in common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto . This seemed to care little for his reason and his will , nothing for his so - called elevated intentions , and moved him along , as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar , in a direction which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no respect , and whose life had nothing in common with his own except locality . HE KAINE DIATHEKE was no more heeded , and the predestinate Jude sprang up and across the room . Foreseeing such an event he had already arrayed himself in his best clothes . In three minutes he was out of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant hollow of corn - ground which lay between the village and the isolated house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland . As he walked he looked at his watch . He could be back in two hours , easily , and a good long time would still remain to him for reading after tea . Passing the few unhealthy fir - trees and cottage where the path joined the highway he hastened along , and struck away to the left , descending the steep side of the country to the west of the Brown House . Here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook that oozed from it , and followed the stream till he reached her dwelling . A smell of piggeries came from the back , and the grunting of the originators of that smell . He entered the garden , and knocked at the door with the knob of his stick . Somebody had seen him through the window , for a male voice on the inside said : "
16053	16095	16048	16048	Mizzle	223	" Jude winced at the words . Courting in such a businesslike aspect as it evidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he was thinking of . He was going to walk with her , perhaps kiss her ; but "
16097	16129	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" was too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas . The door was opened and he entered , just as Arabella came downstairs in radiant walking attire . "
16141	16165	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" said her father , an energetic , black - whiskered man , in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard from outside . "
16178	16184	16176	16176	you	788	" she whispered to Jude . "
16187	16191	16176	16176	you	788	" said he . "
16212	16501	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" Arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt glad he had come , and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto haunted him . First they clambered to the top of the great down , during which ascent he had occasionally to take her hand to assist her . Then they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway , which they followed till it intersected the high - road at the Brown House aforesaid , the spot of his former fervid desires to behold Christminster . But he forgot them now . He talked the commonest local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently adored university , and passed the spot where he had knelt to Diana and Phoebus without remembering that there were any such people in the mythology , or that the sun was anything else than a useful lamp for illuminating Arabella 's face . An indescribable lightness of heel served to lift him along ; and Jude , the incipient scholar , prospective D.D. , professor , bishop , or what not , felt himself honoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her Sunday frock and ribbons . They reached the Brown House barn - the point at which he had planned to turn back . While looking over the vast northern landscape from this spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a distance of a couple of miles . "
16507	16511	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" said Arabella . "
16526	16746	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" The tenderness which had grown up in Jude 's bosom left him no will to thwart her inclination now - which pleased him in affording him excuse for a longer time with her . They started off down the hill almost at a trot ; but on gaining level ground at the bottom , and walking a mile , they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than it had seemed . Having begun their journey , however , they pushed on ; but it was not till five o'clock that they found themselves on the scene , - the distance being altogether about half - a - dozen miles from Marygreen , and three from Arabella 's . The conflagration had been got under by the time they reached it , and after a short inspection of the melancholy ruins they retraced their steps - their course lying through the town of Alfredston . Arabella said she would like some tea , and they entered an inn of an inferior class , and gave their order . As it was not for beer they had a long time to wait . The maid - servant recognized Jude , and whispered her surprise to her mistress in the background , that he , the student "
16754	16923	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" should have suddenly descended so low as to keep company with Arabella . The latter guessed what was being said , and laughed as she met the serious and tender gaze of her lover - the low and triumphant laugh of a careless woman who sees she is winning her game . They sat and looked round the room , and at the picture of Samson and Delilah which hung on the wall , and at the circular beer - stains on the table , and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust . The whole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which few places can produce like a tap - room on a Sunday evening when the setting sun is slanting in , and no liquor is going , and the unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest . It began to grow dusk . They could not wait longer , really , for the tea , they said . "
16931	16935	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" asked Jude . "
16946	16947	16134	16134	Mr.	788	" "
16956	16960	16948	16948	I	0	" said Arabella . "
16989	16990	16992	16992	we	791	" "
16996	16997	16992	16992	we	791	" "
17004	17034	17000	17000	we	791	" Jude by this time wished he was out of such an uncongenial atmosphere ; but he ordered the beer , which was promptly brought . Arabella tasted it . "
17037	17044	17000	17000	we	791	" she said . Jude tasted . "
17052	17056	17057	17057	I	0	" he asked . "
17096	17097	17100	17100	I	0	" "
17106	17130	17100	17100	I	0	" She mentioned three or four ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops , much to Jude 's surprise . "
17136	17222	17100	17100	I	0	" he said good - humouredly . Nevertheless she returned to the beer and drank her share , and they went on their way . It was now nearly dark , and as soon as they had withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together , till they touched each other . She wondered why he did not put his arm round her waist , but he did not ; he merely said what to himself seemed a quite bold enough thing : "
17227	17271	17100	17100	I	0	" She took it , thoroughly , up to the shoulder . He felt the warmth of her body against his , and putting his stick under his other arm held with his right hand her right as it rested in its place . "
17284	17288	17282	17282	we	794	" he observed . "
17291	17299	17282	17282	we	794	" said she ; adding to herself : "
17303	17304	17282	17282	we	794	" "
17311	17392	17282	17282	we	794	" he was thinking . Thus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland , where they could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom . From this point the only way of getting to Arabella 's was by going up the incline , and dipping again into her valley on the right . Before they had climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been walking on the grass unseen . "
17415	17432	17282	17282	we	794	" said one of the men as they vanished down the hill . Arabella tittered lightly . "
17437	17441	17435	17435	lovers	798	" asked Jude . "
17446	17447	17435	17435	lovers	798	" "
17454	17555	17449	17449	you	797	" For answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder . Jude took the hint , and encircling her waist with his arm , pulled her to him and kissed her . They walked now no longer arm in arm but , as she had desired , clasped together . After all , what did it matter since it was dark , said Jude to himself . When they were half - way up the long hill they paused as by arrangement , and he kissed her again . They reached the top , and he kissed her once more . "
17569	17869	17556	17556	You	801	" she said gently . He did so , thinking how trusting she was . Thus they slowly went towards her home . He had left his cottage at half - past three , intending to be sitting down again to the New Testament by half - past five . It was nine o'clock when , with another embrace , he stood to deliver her up at her father 's door . She asked him to come in , if only for a minute , as it would seem so odd otherwise , and as if she had been out alone in the dark . He gave way , and followed her in . Immediately that the door was opened he found , in addition to her parents , several neighbours sitting round . They all spoke in a congratulatory manner , and took him seriously as Arabella 's intended partner . They did not belong to his set or circle , and he felt out of place and embarrassed . He had not meant this : a mere afternoon of pleasant walking with Arabella , that was all he had meant . He did not stay longer than to speak to her stepmother , a simple , quiet woman without features or character ; and bidding them all good night plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down . But that sense was only temporary : Arabella soon re - asserted her sway in his soul . He walked as if he felt himself to be another man from the Jude of yesterday . What were his books to him ? what were his intentions , hitherto adhered to so strictly , as to not wasting a single minute of time day by day ? "
17872	18206	17556	17556	You	801	" It depended on your point of view to define that : he was just living for the first time : not wasting life . It was better to love a woman than to be a graduate , or a parson ; ay , or a pope ! When he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed , and a general consciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things confronting him . He went upstairs without a light , and the dim interior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry . There lay his book open , just as he had left it , and the capital letters on the title - page regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight , like the unclosed eyes of a dead man : HE KAINE DIATHEKE Jude had to leave early next morning for his usual week of absence at lodgings ; and it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his basket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had brought with him . He kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself . Arabella , on the contrary , made them public among all her friends and acquaintance . Retracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours earlier under cover of darkness , with his sweetheart by his side , he reached the bottom of the hill , where he walked slowly , and stood still . He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss . As the sun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed there since . Jude looked on the ground and sighed . He looked closely , and could just discern in the damp dust the imprints of their feet as they had stood locked in each other 's arms . She was not there now , and "
18216	18338	18342	18342	he	802	" so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart which nothing could fill . A pollard willow stood close to the place , and that willow was different from all other willows in the world . Utter annihilation of the six days which must elapse before he could see her again as he had promised would have been his intensest wish if he had had only the week to live . An hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her two companions of the Saturday . She passed unheedingly the scene of the kiss , and the willow that marked it , though chattering freely on the subject to the other two . "
18348	18349	18351	18351	he	802	" "
18354	18400	18351	18351	he	802	" And she related almost word for word some of his tenderest speeches . If Jude had been behind the fence he would have felt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his sayings and doings on the previous evening were private . "
18419	18424	18416	18416	you	804	" murmured Anny judicially . "
18432	18450	18430	18430	you	804	" In a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low , hungry tone of latent sensuousness : "
18530	18531	18520	18520	I	0	" "
18565	18571	18555	18555	you	808	" Arabella remained thinking awhile . "
18579	18583	18555	18555	you	808	" she asked . "
18594	18602	18590	18590	you	808	" said Sarah , the third girl . "
18632	18641	18642	18642	She	0	" The third girl looked at the second . "
18646	18647	18642	18642	She	0	" "
18655	18659	18651	18651	she	0	" said Anny . "
18690	18691	18687	18687	you	808	" "
18721	18722	18724	18725	a husband	807	" "
18727	18728	18730	18731	a husband	807	" "
18733	18734	18730	18731	a husband	807	" "
18786	18787	18792	18792	he	802	" "
18797	18848	18792	18792	he	802	" Arabella 's companions looked at each other , and turning up their eyes in drollery began smirking . Then one went up close to Arabella , and , although nobody was near , imparted some information in a low tone , the other observing curiously the effect upon Arabella . "
18851	18859	18792	18792	he	802	" said the last - named slowly . "
18886	18887	18877	18878	A woman	4193	" "
18938	18947	18929	18929	you	827	" Arabella pursued her way in silent thought . "
18953	19153	18929	18929	you	827	" she whispered ; but not to them . VIII One week 's end Jude was as usual walking out to his aunt 's at Marygreen from his lodging in Alfredston , a walk which now had large attractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and morose relative . He diverged to the right before ascending the hill with the single purpose of gaining , on his way , a glimpse of Arabella that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments . Before quite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top of her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge . Entering the gate he found that three young unfattened pigs had escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top , and that she was endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which she had set open . The lines of her countenance changed from the rigidity of business to the softness of love when she saw Jude , and she bent her eyes languishingly upon him . The animals took advantage of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way . "
19162	19177	19178	19178	They	830	" she cried , stimulated to pursue in spite of her lover 's presence . "
19248	19331	19332	19332	He	839	" He set himself to assist , and dodged this way and that over the potato rows and the cabbages . Every now and then they ran together , when he caught her for a moment and kissed her . The first pig was got back promptly ; the second with some difficulty ; the third a long - legged creature , was more obstinate and agile . He plunged through a hole in the garden hedge , and into the lane . "
19344	19348	19337	19337	I	0	" said she . "
19354	19401	19337	19337	I	0	" She rushed in full pursuit out of the garden , Jude alongside her , barely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight . Occasionally they would shout to some boy to stop the animal , but he always wriggled past and ran on as before . "
19410	19414	19415	19415	You	840	" said Jude . "
19422	19440	19415	19415	You	840	" She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness , and they trotted along together . "
19448	19452	19453	19453	They	844	" she remarked . "
19472	19563	19464	19464	They	844	" By this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the open down , across which he sped with all the agility his little legs afforded . As soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the top of the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run all the way to the farmer 's if they wished to get at him . From this summit he could be seen as a minute speck , following an unerring line towards his old home . "
19569	19573	19574	19574	He	846	" cried Arabella . "
19621	19657	19618	19618	I	0	" Without relinquishing her hold of Jude 's hand she swerved aside and flung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn , precipitately pulling Jude on to his knees at the same time . "
19680	19729	19675	19675	I	0	" She lay supine , and straight as an arrow , on the sloping sod of this hill - top , gazing up into the blue miles of sky , and still retaining her warm hold of Jude 's hand . He reclined on his elbow near her . "
19739	19773	19675	19675	I	0	" she went on , her form heaving and falling in quick pants , her face flushed , her full red lips parted , and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin . "
19784	19785	19779	19779	you	850	" "
19797	19869	19779	19779	you	850	" They were in absolute solitude - the most apparent of all solitudes , that of empty surrounding space . Nobody could be nearer than a mile to them without their seeing him . They were , in fact , on one of the summits of the county , and the distant landscape around Christminster could be discerned from where they lay . But Jude did not think of that then . "
19883	19887	19872	19872	I	0	" said Arabella . "
19907	19908	19872	19872	I	0	" "
19911	19918	19872	19872	I	0	" said Jude , sitting up . "
19931	19947	19926	19926	you	850	" said she . He bent nearer and put his head in front of hers . "
19956	19960	19950	19950	I	0	" he said . "
19980	19989	19990	19990	I	0	" She gently pulled him down beside her . "
19996	20009	19990	19990	I	0	" he repeated , the back of his head against her cheek . "
20019	20034	20011	20011	I	0	" He stood accordingly , placing himself in the direct line of her gaze . "
20040	20050	20037	20037	you	850	" she said crossly , turning away her face . "
20065	20073	20077	20077	Abby	230	" he replied looking down upon her . "
20079	20080	20077	20077	Abby	230	" "
20083	20084	20077	20077	Abby	230	" "
20103	20135	20094	20094	I	0	" She rolled round her face , remained a moment looking deedily aslant at him ; then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet , and exclaiming abruptly "
20140	20152	20136	20136	I	0	" walked off quickly homeward . Jude followed and rejoined her . "
20156	20160	20136	20136	I	0	" he coaxed . "
20164	20172	20136	20136	I	0	" she said . He , surprised : "
20178	20257	20136	20136	I	0	" She kept her two lips resentfully together , and Jude followed her like a pet lamb till she slackened her pace and walked beside him , talking calmly on indifferent subjects , and always checking him if he tried to take her hand or clasp her waist . Thus they descended to the precincts of her father 's homestead , and Arabella went in , nodding good - bye to him with a supercilious , affronted air . "
20270	20385	20386	20386	I	0	" Jude said to himself , as he withdrew with a sigh and went on to Marygreen . On Sunday morning the interior of Arabella 's home was , as usual , the scene of a grand weekly cooking , the preparation of the special Sunday dinner . Her father was shaving before a little glass hung on the mullion of the window , and her mother and Arabella herself were shelling beans hard by . A neighbour passed on her way home from morning service at the nearest church , and seeing Donn engaged at the window with the razor , nodded and came in . She at once spoke playfully to Arabella : "
20407	20423	20424	20424	He	857	" Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without raising her eyes . "
20440	20441	20424	20424	He	857	" "
20451	20463	20443	20443	you	0	" asked Arabella with a jealous , tigerish indrawing of breath . "
20534	20547	20548	20548	I	0	" When the gossip had departed Arabella said suddenly to her mother : "
20583	20584	20577	20577	you	0	" "
20596	20597	20577	20577	you	0	" "
20648	20649	20642	20642	I	0	" "
20664	20778	20642	20642	I	0	" In the afternoon Arabella met and walked with Jude , who had now for weeks ceased to look into a book of Greek , Latin , or any other tongue . They wandered up the slopes till they reached the green track along the ridge , which they followed to the circular British earth - bank adjoining , Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway , and of the drovers who had frequented it , probably before the Romans knew the country . Up from the level lands below them floated the chime of church bells . Presently they were reduced to one note , which quickened , and stopped . "
20785	20823	20824	20824	I	0	" said Arabella , who had attended to the sounds . Jude assented . So long as he was near her he minded little where he was . When they arrived at her house he said lingeringly : "
20850	20851	20824	20824	I	0	" "
20856	20872	20824	20824	I	0	" said she . She tried the handle of the door and found it locked . "
20881	20899	20875	20875	they	864	" she added . And searching behind the scraper she found the key and unlocked the door . "
20909	20914	20902	20902	you	0	" she asked lightly . "
20921	20922	20902	20902	you	0	" "
20925	20981	20902	20902	you	0	" said Jude with alacrity , the case being unexpectedly altered . Indoors they went . Did he want any tea ? No , it was too late : he would rather sit and talk to her . She took off her jacket and hat , and they sat down - naturally enough close together . "
20989	20994	20995	20995	I	0	" she said softly . "
21014	21024	21004	21004	I	0	" She began unfastening the collar of her gown . "
21029	21034	21004	21004	I	0	" said her lover . "
21070	21071	21074	21074	you	0	" "
21078	21079	21074	21074	you	0	" "
21083	21128	21074	21074	you	0	" She put her hand into her bosom and drew out the egg , which was wrapped in wool , outside it being a piece of pig 's bladder , in case of accidents . Having exhibited it to him she put it back , "
21153	21154	21138	21138	I	0	" "
21164	21165	21157	21157	you	0	" "
21190	21191	21178	21179	a woman	4193	" "
21201	21207	21178	21179	a woman	4193	" he said , laughing . "
21223	21247	21218	21218	you	0	" She had turned round her chair , and , reaching over the back of it , presented her cheek to him gingerly . "
21255	21256	21253	21253	you	0	" "
21275	21280	21281	21281	I	0	" she said defiantly , "
21287	21365	21281	21281	I	0	" She had quickly withdrawn the egg a second time ; but before he could quite reach her she had put it back as quickly , laughing with the excitement of her strategy . Then there was a little struggle , Jude making a plunge for it and capturing it triumphantly . Her face flushed ; and becoming suddenly conscious he flushed also . They looked at each other , panting ; till he rose and said : "
21384	21392	21380	21380	I	0	" But she had jumped up too . "
21399	21551	21393	21393	You	0	" she cried . Her lover followed her as she withdrew . It was now dark inside the room , and the window being small he could not discover for a long time what had become of her , till a laugh revealed her to have rushed up the stairs , whither Jude rushed at her heels . IX It was some two months later in the year , and the pair had met constantly during the interval . Arabella seemed dissatisfied ; she was always imagining , and waiting , and wondering . One day she met the itinerant Vilbert . She , like all the cottagers thereabout , knew the quack well , and she began telling him of her experiences . Arabella had been gloomy , but before he left her she had grown brighter . That evening she kept an appointment with Jude , who seemed sad . "
21557	21563	21552	21552	I	0	" he said to her . "
21610	21616	21619	21619	you	0	" Arabella began to cry . "
21627	21631	21619	21619	you	0	" she said . "
21647	21658	21640	21640	I	0	" and she looked into his face with streaming eyes . "
21661	21668	21640	21640	I	0	" he asked , turning pale . "
21672	21673	21694	21694	you	305	" "
21686	21687	21679	21679	I	0	" "
21709	21710	21701	21701	You	305	" "
21714	21715	21701	21701	You	305	" "
21764	21765	21766	21766	I	0	" "
21793	21794	21795	21795	You	0	" "
21868	22272	21865	21865	we	871	" That night he went out alone , and walked in the dark self - communing . He knew well , too well , in the secret centre of his brain , that Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind . Yet , such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he unfortunately had done , he was ready to abide by what he had said , and take the consequences . For his own soothing he kept up a factitious belief in her . His idea of her was the thing of most consequence , not Arabella herself , he sometimes said laconically . The banns were put in and published the very next Sunday . The people of the parish all said what a simple fool young Fawley was . All his reading had only come to this , that he would have to sell his books to buy saucepans . Those who guessed the probable state of affairs , Arabella 's parents being among them , declared that it was the sort of conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart . The parson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too . And so , standing before the aforesaid officiator , the two swore that at every other time of their lives till death took them , they would assuredly believe , feel , and desire precisely as they had believed , felt , and desired during the few preceding weeks . What was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore . Fawley 's aunt being a baker she made him a bride - cake , saying bitterly that it was the last thing she could do for him , poor silly fellow ; and that it would have been far better if , instead of his living to trouble her , he had gone underground years before with his father and mother . Of this cake Arabella took some slices , wrapped them up in white note - paper , and sent them to her companions in the pork - dressing business , Anny and Sarah , labelling each packet "
22279	22592	21865	21865	we	871	" The prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very brilliant even to the most sanguine mind . He , a stone - mason 's apprentice , nineteen years of age , was working for half wages till he should be out of his time . His wife was absolutely useless in a town - lodging , where he at first had considered it would be necessary for them to live . But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so little a degree caused him to take a lonely roadside cottage between the Brown House and Marygreen , that he might have the profits of a vegetable garden , and utilize her past experiences by letting her keep a pig . But it was not the sort of life he had bargained for , and it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day . Arabella , however , felt that all these make - shifts were temporary ; she had gained a husband ; that was the thing - a husband with a lot of earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should begin to get frightened a bit , and stick to his trade , and throw aside those stupid books for practical undertakings . So to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage , giving up his old room at his aunt 's - where so much of the hard labour at Greek and Latin had been carried on . A little chill overspread him at her first unrobing . A long tail of hair , which Arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back of her head , was deliberately unfastened , stroked out , and hung upon the looking - glass which he had bought her . "
22601	22612	21865	21865	we	871	" he said , with a sudden distaste for her . "
22625	22626	21865	21865	we	871	" "
22656	22657	22647	22647	you	875	" "

22772	22995	22764	22765	the barber	889	" Jude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be true to some extent , for all that he knew , many unsophisticated girls would and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing their simplicity of life and embellishments . Others , alas , had an instinct towards artificiality in their very blood , and became adepts in counterfeiting at the first glimpse of it . However , perhaps there was no great sin in a woman adding to her hair , and he resolved to think no more of it . A new - made wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few weeks , even though the prospects of the household ways and means are cloudy . There is a certain piquancy about her situation , and her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it , which carries off the gloom of facts , and renders even the humblest bride independent awhile of the real . Mrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of Alfredston one market - day with this quality in her carriage when she met Anny her former friend , whom she had not seen since the wedding . As usual they laughed before talking ; the world seemed funny to them without saying it . "

23263	23474	23259	23259	Married	898	" Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached the time when in the natural course of things she would have to reveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation . The occasion was one evening at bedtime , and they were in their chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked home from his work every day . He had worked hard the whole twelve hours , and had retired to rest before his wife . When she came into the room he was between sleeping and waking , and was barely conscious of her undressing before the little looking - glass as he lay . One action of hers , however , brought him to full cognition . Her face being reflected towards him as she sat , he could perceive that she was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the dimple before alluded to , a curious accomplishment of which she was mistress , effecting it by a momentary suction . It seemed to him for the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face during his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the earlier weeks of their acquaintance . "
23482	23487	23480	23480	Arabella	305	" he said suddenly . "
23505	23511	23497	23497	I	0	" She turned and laughed . "

23989	24327	23982	23982	I	0	" He gave the answer simply , and lay down ; and there was silence between them . When Jude awoke the next morning he seemed to see the world with a different eye . As to the point in question he was compelled to accept her word ; in the circumstances he could not have acted otherwise while ordinary notions prevailed . But how came they to prevail ? There seemed to him , vaguely and dimly , something wrong in a social ritual which made necessary a cancelling of well - formed schemes involving years of thought and labour , of foregoing a man 's one opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals , and of contributing his units of work to the general progress of his generation , because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice , and could be only at the most called weakness . He was inclined to inquire what he had done , or she lost , for that matter , that he deserved to be caught in a gin which would cripple him , if not her also , for the rest of a lifetime ? There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non - existent . But the marriage remained . X The time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his wife had fattened in their sty during the autumn months , and the butchering was timed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning , so that Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter of a day . The night had seemed strangely silent . Jude looked out of the window long before dawn , and perceived that the ground was covered with snow - snow rather deep for the season , it seemed , a few flakes still falling . "
24342	24348	24328	24328	I	0	" he said to Arabella . "
24379	24380	24374	24374	I	0	" "
24386	24390	24391	24391	I	0	" said Jude . "
24400	24513	24391	24391	I	0	" He went downstairs , lit the fire under the copper , and began feeding it with bean - stalks , all the time without a candle , the blaze flinging a cheerful shine into the room ; though for him the sense of cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze - to heat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as yet lived , and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner of the garden . At half - past six , the time of appointment with the butcher , the water boiled , and Jude 's wife came downstairs . "
24518	24522	24515	24515	Challow	232	" she asked . "
24525	24556	24515	24515	Challow	232	" They waited , and it grew lighter , with the dreary light of a snowy dawn . She went out , gazed along the road , and returning said , "
24580	24581	24515	24515	Challow	232	" "
24607	24608	24515	24515	Challow	232	" "

24784	24788	24778	24778	you	921	" said Jude . "
24800	24981	24789	24789	I	0	" He went out to the sty , shovelled away the snow for the space of a couple of yards or more , and placed the stool in front , with the knives and ropes at hand . A robin peered down at the preparations from the nearest tree , and , not liking the sinister look of the scene , flew away , though hungry . By this time Arabella had joined her husband , and Jude , rope in hand , got into the sty , and noosed the affrighted animal , who , beginning with a squeak of surprise , rose to repeated cries of rage . Arabella opened the sty - door , and together they hoisted the victim on to the stool , legs upward , and while Jude held him Arabella bound him down , looping the cord over his legs to keep him from struggling . The animal 's note changed its quality . It was not now rage , but the cry of despair ; long - drawn , slow and hopeless . "
25000	25004	24789	24789	I	0	" said Jude . "
25015	25016	24789	24789	I	0	" "

25179	25217	25244	25244	I	0	" said Jude determinedly . Scraping the bristles from the pig 's upturned throat , as he had seen the butchers do , he slit the fat ; then plunged in the knife with all his might . "
25224	25228	25244	25244	I	0	" she cried , "
25251	25252	25244	25244	I	0	" "
25268	25269	25244	25244	I	0	" "
25284	25359	25244	25244	I	0	" However unworkmanlike the deed , it had been mercifully done . The blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had desired . The dying animal 's cry assumed its third and final tone , the shriek of agony ; his glazing eyes riveting themselves on Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends . "
25365	25369	25244	25244	I	0	" said Arabella . "
25395	25435	25386	25386	people	658	" Picking up the knife from the ground whereon Jude had flung it , she slipped it into the gash , and slit the windpipe . The pig was instantly silent , his dying breath coming through the hole . "
25440	25444	25386	25386	people	658	" she said . "
25451	25455	25456	25456	Pigs	930	" said he . "
25461	25503	25456	25456	Pigs	930	" The animal heaved in a final convulsion , and , despite the rope , kicked out with all his last strength . A tablespoonful of black clot came forth , the trickling of red blood having ceased for some seconds . "
25513	25517	25509	25509	he	931	" said she . "
25535	25566	25521	25521	they	932	" The last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger , and in recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood had been caught . "
25569	25578	25521	25521	they	932	" she cried , thoroughly in a passion . "
25596	25672	25594	25594	you	931	" Jude put the pail upright , but only about a third of the whole steaming liquid was left in it , the main part being splashed over the snow , and forming a dismal , sordid , ugly spectacle - to those who saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat . The lips and nostrils of the animal turned livid , then white , and the muscles of his limbs relaxed . "
25676	25680	25594	25594	you	931	" Jude said . "
25685	25686	25594	25594	you	931	" "
25710	25715	25704	25704	I	0	" she said scornfully . "

25729	25733	25726	25726	I	0	" said he . "
25740	25751	25734	25734	I	0	" Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand . "
25776	25817	25773	25773	I	0	" The voice , which was husky , came from the garden - gate , and looking up from the scene of slaughter they saw the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate , critically surveying their performance . "
25830	25834	25823	25823	ee	935	" said Arabella . "
25859	25865	25866	25866	You	931	" Challow expressed his contrition . "
25872	25880	25866	25866	You	931	" he said , shaking his head , "
25910	25911	25912	25912	You	931	" "
25920	26237	26238	26238	Howsomever	233	" said Arabella , laughing . Jude too laughed , but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in his amusement . Challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the scalding and scraping . Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man at what he had done , though aware of his lack of common sense , and that the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by deputy . The white snow , stained with the blood of his fellow - mortal , wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice , not to say a Christian ; but he could not see how the matter was to be mended . No doubt he was , as his wife had called him , a tender - hearted fool . He did not like the road to Alfredston now . It stared him cynically in the face . The wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of his wife that , to keep them out of his eyes , he read whenever he could as he walked to and from his work . Yet he sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping common - place nor gaining rare ideas , every working - man being of that taste now . When passing near the spot by the stream on which he had first made her acquaintance he one day heard voices just as he had done at that earlier time . One of the girls who had been Arabella 's companions was talking to a friend in a shed , himself being the subject of discourse , possibly because they had seen him in the distance . They were quite unaware that the shed - walls were so thin that he could hear their words as he passed . "
26273	26274	26263	26263	she	937	" "
26293	26312	26287	26287	she	937	" What had Arabella been put up to by this woman , so that he should make her his "
26315	26464	26279	26279	she	937	" otherwise wife ? The suggestion was horridly unpleasant , and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of entering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket inside the garden - gate and passed on , determined to go and see his old aunt and get some supper there . This made his arrival home rather late . Arabella however , was busy melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig , for she had been out on a jaunt all day , and so delayed her work . Dreading lest what he had heard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he spoke little . But Arabella was very talkative , and said among other things that she wanted some money . Seeing the book sticking out of his pocket she added that he ought to earn more . "
26488	26489	26279	26279	she	937	" "
26498	26499	26279	26279	she	937	" "

26560	26565	26566	26566	I	0	" he said hastily . "

26659	26660	26652	26652	I	0	" "

26692	26704	26652	26652	I	0	" And he hinted gently what had been revealed to him . "
26723	26729	26716	26716	us	943	" Her defensive manner collapsed . "
26734	26741	26716	26716	us	943	" she said , laughing coldly . "
26758	26759	26756	26756	hers	945	" "
26836	26837	26813	26813	she	945	" "

26896	26937	26840	26840	I	0	" XI Next morning , which was Sunday , she resumed operations about ten o'clock ; and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had accompanied it the night before , and put her back into the same intractable temper . "
26966	26991	26963	26964	Lord send	949	" As she warmed she saw some of Jude 's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have been laid . "
27003	27022	26963	26964	Lord send	949	" she cried petulantly ; and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon the floor . "
27028	27032	27033	27033	You	0	" he said . "
27056	27139	26963	26964	Lord send	949	" In the operation of making lard Arabella 's hands had become smeared with the hot grease , and her fingers consequently left very perceptible imprints on the book - covers . She continued deliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor , till Jude , incensed beyond bearing , caught her by the arms to make her leave off . Somehow , in going so , he loosened the fastening of her hair , and it rolled about her ears . "
27144	27148	26963	26964	Lord send	949	" she said . "
27156	27160	26963	26964	Lord send	949	" She hesitated . "
27165	27169	26963	26964	Lord send	949	" she repeated . "
27172	27177	27178	27178	I	0	" After a pause : "
27181	27361	27178	27178	I	0	" Jude relinquished his hold , and she crossed the room to the door , out of which she went with a set face , and into the highway . Here she began to saunter up and down , perversely pulling her hair into a worse disorder than he had caused , and unfastening several buttons of her gown . It was a fine Sunday morning , dry , clear and frosty , and the bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the north . People were going along the road , dressed in their holiday clothes ; they were mainly lovers - such pairs as Jude and Arabella had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier . These pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she now presented , bonnetless , her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind , her bodice apart , her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work , and her hands reeking with melted fat . One of the passers said in mock terror : "
27367	27368	27362	27363	Good Lord	950	" "
27376	27380	27371	27371	he	952	" she cried . "
27411	27509	27520	27521	your father	907	" Jude was exasperated , and went out to drag her in by main force . Then he suddenly lost his heat . Illuminated with the sense that all was over between them , and that it mattered not what she did , or he , her husband stood still , regarding her . Their lives were ruined , he thought ; ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union : that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong comradeship tolerable . "
27539	27543	27545	27545	you	954	" she asked . "
27555	27616	27617	27617	Aunt	962	" Jude fixed an arrested , surprised look on her . But she said no more , and continued her saunter till she was tired . He left the spot , and , after wandering vaguely a little while , walked in the direction of Marygreen . Here he called upon his great - aunt , whose infirmities daily increased . "
27634	27664	27620	27621	my father	3941	" said Jude abruptly , sitting down by the fire . She raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by - gone bonnet that she always wore . "
27672	27676	27620	27621	my father	3941	" she said . "
27690	27691	27620	27621	my father	3941	" "
27815	27839	27798	27799	your father	907	" Jude recalled his father 's silence about North Wessex and Jude 's mother , never speaking of either till his dying day . "
27936	27937	27922	27922	you	0	" "
27954	27955	27951	27951	you	0	" "
27990	28442	27951	27951	you	0	" In the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his old aunt 's as if to go home . But as soon as he reached the open down he struck out upon it till he came to a large round pond . The frost continued , though it was not particularly sharp , and the larger stars overhead came out slow and flickering . Jude put one foot on the edge of the ice , and then the other : it cracked under his weight ; but this did not deter him . He ploughed his way inward to the centre , the ice making sharp noises as he went . When just about the middle he looked around him and gave a jump . The cracking repeated itself ; but he did not go down . He jumped again , but the cracking had ceased . Jude went back to the edge , and stepped upon the ground . It was curious , he thought . What was he reserved for ? He supposed he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide . Peaceful death abhorred him as a subject , and would not take him . What could he do of a lower kind than self - extermination ; what was there less noble , more in keeping with his present degraded position ? He could get drunk . Of course that was it ; he had forgotten . Drinking was the regular , stereotyped resource of the despairing worthless . He began to see now why some men boozed at inns . He struck down the hill northwards and came to an obscure public - house . On entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and Delilah on the wall caused him to recognize the place as that he had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their courtship . He called for liquor and drank briskly for an hour or more . Staggering homeward late that night , with all his sense of depression gone , and his head fairly clear still , he began to laugh boisterously , and to wonder how Arabella would receive him in his new aspect . The house was in darkness when he entered , and in his stumbling state it was some time before he could get a light . Then he found that , though the marks of pig - dressing , of fats and scallops , were visible , the materials themselves had been taken away . A line written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope was pinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace : "
28453	29013	29014	29014	Jude	180	" All the next day he remained at home , and sent off the carcase of the pig to Alfredston . He then cleaned up the premises , locked the door , put the key in a place she would know if she came back , and returned to his masonry at Alfredston . At night when he again plodded home he found she had not visited the house . The next day went in the same way , and the next . Then there came a letter from her . That she had gone tired of him she frankly admitted . He was such a slow old coach , and she did not care for the sort of life he led . There was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her . She further went on to say that her parents had , as he knew , for some time considered the question of emigrating to Australia , the pig - jobbing business being a poor one nowadays . They had at last decided to go , and she proposed to go with them , if he had no objection . A woman of her sort would have more chance over there than in this stupid country . Jude replied that he had not the least objection to her going . He thought it a wise course , since she wished to go , and one that might be to the advantage of both . He enclosed in the packet containing the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig , with all he had besides , which was not much . From that day he heard no more of her except indirectly , though her father and his household did not immediately leave , but waited till his goods and other effects had been sold off . When Jude learnt that there was to be an auction at the house of the Donns he packed his own household goods into a waggon , and sent them to her at the aforesaid homestead , that she might sell them with the rest , or as many of them as she should choose . He then went into lodgings at Alfredston , and saw in a shopwindow the little handbill announcing the sale of his father - in - law 's furniture . He noted its date , which came and passed without Jude 's going near the place , or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by the southern road was materially increased by the auction . A few days later he entered a dingy broker 's shop in the main street of the town , and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans , a clothes - horse , rolling - pin , brass candlestick , swing looking - glass , and other things at the back of the shop , evidently just brought in from a sale , he perceived a framed photograph , which turned out to be his own portrait . It was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man in bird's - eye maple , as a present for Arabella , and had duly given her on their wedding - day . On the back was still to be read , "
29018	29039	29014	29014	Jude	180	" with the date . She must have thrown it in with the rest of her property at the auction . "
29042	29070	29014	29014	Jude	180	" said the broker , seeing him look at this and the other articles in the heap , and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself : "
29118	29346	29110	29110	You	990	" The utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife , as brought home to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of his portrait and gift , was the conclusive little stroke required to demolish all sentiment in him . He paid the shilling , took the photograph away with him , and burnt it , frame and all , when he reached his lodging . Two or three days later he heard that Arabella and her parents had departed . He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal leave - taking , but she had said that it would be better otherwise , since she was bent on going , which perhaps was true . On the evening following their emigration , when his day 's work was done , he came out of doors after supper , and strolled in the starlight along the too familiar road towards the upland whereon had been experienced the chief emotions of his life . It seemed to be his own again . He could not realize himself . On the old track he seemed to be a boy still , hardly a day older than when he had stood dreaming at the top of that hill , inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for Christminster and scholarship . "

29393	29759	29761	29761	his	993	" He remembered then that he was standing not far from the spot at which the parting between his father and his mother was said to have occurred . A little further on was the summit whence Christminster , or what he had taken for that city , had seemed to be visible . A milestone , now as always , stood at the roadside hard by . Jude drew near it , and felt rather than read the mileage to the city . He remembered that once on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an inscription on the back of that milestone , embodying his aspirations . It had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship , before he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman . He wondered if the inscription were legible still , and going to the back of the milestone brushed away the nettles . By the light of a match he could still discern what he had cut so enthusiastically so long ago : THITHER J. F. with a pointing finger The sight of it , unimpaired , within its screen of grass and nettles , lit in his soul a spark of the old fire . Surely his plan should be to move onward through good and ill - to avoid morbid sorrow even though he did see uglinesses in the world ? Bene agere et loetari - to do good cheerfully - which he had heard to be the philosophy of one Spinoza , might be his own even now . He might battle with his evil star , and follow out his original intention . By moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a north - easterly direction . There actually rose the faint halo , a small dim nebulousness , hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith . It was enough for him . He would go to Christminster as soon as the term of his apprenticeship expired . He returned to his lodgings in a better mood , and said his prayers . Part Second AT CHRISTMINSTER "

I The next noteworthy move in Jude 's life was that in which he appeared gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years ' later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella , and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her . He was walking towards Christminster City , at a point a mile or two to the south - west of it . He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston : he was out of his apprenticeship , and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start - the start to which , barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with Arabella , he had been looking forward for about ten years . Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible , meditative , and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance . He was of dark complexion , with dark harmonizing eyes , and he wore a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at his age ; this , with his great mass of black curly hair , was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone - dust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade . His capabilities in the latter , having been acquired in the country , were of an all - round sort , including monumental stone - cutting , gothic free - stone work for the restoration of churches , and carving of a general kind . In London he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a "

33653	34468	33615	33615	he	180	" as it had been called , ate further and further into him ; till he probably knew more about those buildings materially , artistically , and historically , than any one of their inmates . It was not till now , when he found himself actually on the spot of his enthusiasm , that Jude perceived how far away from the object of that enthusiasm he really was . Only a wall divided him from those happy young contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental life ; men who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read , mark , learn , and inwardly digest . Only a wall - but what a wall ! Every day , every hour , as he went in search of labour , he saw them going and coming also , rubbed shoulders with them , heard their voices , marked their movements . The conversation of some of the more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes , owing to his long and persistent preparation for this place , to be peculiarly akin to his own thoughts . Yet he was as far from them as if he had been at the antipodes . Of course he was . He was a young workman in a white blouse , and with stone - dust in the creases of his clothes ; and in passing him they did not even see him , or hear him , rather saw through him as through a pane of glass at their familiars beyond . Whatever they were to him , he to them was not on the spot at all ; and yet he had fancied he would be close to their lives by coming there . But the future lay ahead after all ; and if he could only be so fortunate as to get into good employment he would put up with the inevitable . So he thanked God for his health and strength , and took courage . For the present he was outside the gates of everything , colleges included : perhaps some day he would be inside . Those palaces of light and leading ; he might some day look down on the world through their panes . At length he did receive a message from the stone - mason 's yard - that a job was waiting for him . It was his first encouragement , and he closed with the offer promptly . He was young and strong , or he never could have executed with such zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself , since they involved reading most of the night after working all the day . First he bought a shaded lamp for four and six - pence , and obtained a good light . Then he got pens , paper , and such other necessary books as he had been unable to obtain elsewhere . Then , to the consternation of his landlady , he shifted all the furniture of his room - a single one for living and sleeping - rigged up a curtain on a rope across the middle , to make a double chamber out of one , hung up a thick blind that nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep , laid out his books , and sat down . Having been deeply encumbered by marrying , getting a cottage , and buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife , he had never been able to save any money since the time of those disastrous ventures , and till his wages began to come in he was obliged to live in the narrowest way . After buying a book or two he could not even afford himself a fire ; and when the nights reeked with the raw and cold air from the Meadows he sat over his lamp in a great - coat , hat , and woollen gloves . From his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral , and the ogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city . The tall tower , tall belfry windows , and tall pinnacles of the college by the bridge he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase . These objects he used as stimulants when his faith in the future was dim . Like enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of procedure . Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance , he never dwelt upon them . For the present , he said to himself , the one thing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge , and await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming a son of the University . "
34498	34936	34945	34945	hers	1171	" His desire absorbed him , and left no part of him to weigh its practicability . At this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old aunt , on the subject which had previously distressed her - a fear that Jude would not be strong - minded enough to keep away from his cousin Sue Bridehead and her relations . Sue 's father , his aunt believed , had gone back to London , but the girl remained at Christminster . To make her still more objectionable she was an artist or designer of some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse , which was a perfect seed - bed of idolatry , and she was no doubt abandoned to mummeries on that account - if not quite a Papist . Miss Drusilla Fawley was of her date , Evangelical . As Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological , this news of Sue 's probable opinions did not much influence him one way or the other , but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting . With an altogether singular pleasure he walked at his earliest spare minutes past the shops answering to his great - aunt 's description ; and beheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk , who was suspiciously like the original of the portrait . He ventured to enter on a trivial errand , and having made his purchase lingered on the scene . The shop seemed to be kept entirely by women . It contained Anglican books , stationery , texts , and fancy goods : little plaster angels on brackets , Gothic - framed pictures of saints , ebony crosses that were almost crucifixes , prayer - books that were almost missals . He felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk ; she was so pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong to him . Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the counter ; and he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his own voice ; softened and sweetened , but his own . What was she doing ? He stole a glance round . Before her lay a piece of zinc , cut to the shape of a scroll three or four feet long , and coated with a dead - surface paint on one side . Hereon she was designing or illuminating , in characters of Church text , the single word A L L E L U J A "
34947	35302	34945	34945	hers	1171	" thought he . Her presence here was now fairly enough explained , her skill in work of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her father 's occupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal . The lettering on which she was engaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some chancel to assist devotion . He came out . It would have been easy to speak to her there and then , but it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt to disregard her request so incontinently . She had used him roughly , but she had brought him up : and the fact of her being powerless to control him lent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as an argument . So Jude gave no sign . He would not call upon Sue just yet . He had other reasons against doing so when he had walked away . She seemed so dainty beside himself in his rough working - jacket and dusty trousers that he felt he was as yet unready to encounter her , as he had felt about Mr. Phillotson . And how possible it was that she had inherited the antipathies of her family , and would scorn him , as far as a Christian could , particularly when he had told her that unpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire . Thus he kept watch over her , and liked to feel she was there . The consciousness of her living presence stimulated him . But she remained more or less an ideal character , about whose form he began to weave curious and fantastic day - dreams . Between two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some more men , outside Crozier College in Old - time Street , in getting a block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement , before hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing . Standing in position the head man said , "
35312	36714	35308	35308	He	1172	" And they heaved . All of a sudden , as he lifted , his cousin stood close to his elbow , pausing a moment on the bend of her foot till the obstructing object should have been removed . She looked right into his face with liquid , untranslatable eyes , that combined , or seemed to him to combine , keenness with tenderness , and mystery with both , their expression , as well as that of her lips , taking its life from some words just spoken to a companion , and being carried on into his face quite unconsciously . She no more observed his presence than that of the dust - motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams . His closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled , and turned his face away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him , though as she had never once seen him she could not possibly do so ; and might very well never have heard even his name . He could perceive that though she was a country - girl at bottom , a latter girlhood of some years in London , and a womanhood here , had taken all rawness out of her . When she was gone he continued his work , reflecting on her . He had been so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her general mould and build . He remembered now that she was not a large figure , that she was light and slight , of the type dubbed elegant . That was about all he had seen . There was nothing statuesque in her ; all was nervous motion . She was mobile , living , yet a painter might not have called her handsome or beautiful . But the much that she was surprised him . She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity that was his . How could one of his cross - grained , unfortunate , almost accursed stock , have contrived to reach this pitch of niceness ? London had done it , he supposed . From this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his breast as the bottled - up effect of solitude and the poetized locality he dwelt in , insensibly began to precipitate itself on this half - visionary form ; and he perceived that , whatever his obedient wish in a contrary direction , he would soon be unable to resist the desire to make himself known to her . He affected to think of her quite in a family way , since there were crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any other . The first reason was that he was married , and it would be wrong . The second was that they were cousins . It was not well for cousins to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion . The third : even were he free , in a family like his own where marriage usually meant a tragic sadness , marriage with a blood - relation would duplicate the adverse conditions , and a tragic sadness might be intensified to a tragic horror . Therefore , again , he would have to think of Sue with only a relation 's mutual interest in one belonging to him ; regard her in a practical way as some one to be proud of ; to talk and nod to ; later on , to be invited to tea by , the emotion spent on her being rigorously that of a kinsman and well - wisher . So would she be to him a kindly star , an elevating power , a companion in Anglican worship , a tender friend . III But under the various deterrent influences Jude 's instinct was to approach her timidly , and the next Sunday he went to the morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her , for he had found that she frequently attended there . She did not come , and he awaited her in the afternoon , which was finer . He knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible , and he stood in a corner while the bell was going . A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls , and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite , and followed her into the building , more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself . To see her , and to be himself unseen and unknown , was enough for him at present . He lingered awhile in the vestibule , and the service was some way advanced when he was put into a seat . It was a louring , mournful , still afternoon , when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary practical men , and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured classes . In the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only , but he saw that Sue was among them . He had not long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the 119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second part , In quo corriget , the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian tune as the singers gave forth : Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? It was the very question that was engaging Jude 's attention at this moment . What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he had done to an animal passion for a woman , and allow it to lead to such disastrous consequences ; then to think of putting an end to himself ; then to go recklessly and get drunk . The great waves of pedal music tumbled round the choir , and , nursed on the supernatural as he had been , it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this moment of his first entry into the solemn building . And yet it was the ordinary psalm for the twenty - fourth evening of the month . The girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears ; and the thought was a delight to him . She was probably a frequenter of this place , and , steeped body and soul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit , had , no doubt , much in common with him . To an impressionable and lonely young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts , which promised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities , was like the dew of Hermon , and he remained throughout the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy . Though he was loth to suspect it , some people might have said to him that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee . Jude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen before he himself moved . She did not look towards him , and by the time he reached the door she was half - way down the broad path . Being dressed up in his Sunday suit he was inclined to follow her and reveal himself . But he was not quite ready ; and , alas , ought he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him ? For though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the service , and he had persuaded himself that such was the case , he could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism . She was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation , and he said , "
36733	37183	37184	37184	I	0	" Still Sue WAS his own kin , and the fact of his having a wife , even though she was not in evidence in this hemisphere , might be a help in one sense . It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out of Sue 's mind , and make her intercourse with him free and fearless . It was with some heartache that he saw how little he cared for the freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such knowledge . Some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the pretty , liquid - eyed , light - footed young woman Sue Bridehead had an afternoon 's holiday , and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in which she not only assisted but lodged , took a walk into the country with a book in her hand . It was one of those cloudless days which sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet , as if intercalated by caprice of the weather - god . She went along for a mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city she had left behind her . The road passed between green fields , and coming to a stile Sue paused there , to finish the page she was reading , and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old . On the other side of the stile , in the footpath , she beheld a foreigner with black hair and a sallow face , sitting on the grass beside a large square board whereon were fixed , as closely as they could stand , a number of plaster statuettes , some of them bronzed , which he was re - arranging before proceeding with them on his way . They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles , and comprised divinities of a very different character from those the girl was accustomed to see portrayed , among them being a Venus of standard pattern , a Diana , and , of the other sex , Apollo , Bacchus , and Mars . Though the figures were many yards away from her the south - west sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green herbage that she could discern their contours with luminous distinctness ; and being almost in a line between herself and the church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and contrasting set of ideas by comparison . The man rose , and , seeing her , politely took off his cap , and cried "
37192	37274	37184	37184	I	0	" in an accent that agreed with his appearance . In a moment he dexterously lifted upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine and human , and raised it to the top of his head , bringing them on to her and resting the board on the stile . First he offered her his smaller wares - the busts of kings and queens , then a minstrel , then a winged Cupid . She shook her head . "
37281	37312	37184	37184	I	0	" she said , touching with her finger the Venus and the Apollo - the largest figures on the tray . He said she should have them for ten shillings . "
37319	37492	37184	37184	I	0	" said Sue . She offered considerably less , and to her surprise the image - man drew them from their wire stay and handed them over the stile . She clasped them as treasures . When they were paid for , and the man had gone , she began to be concerned as to what she should do with them . They seemed so very large now that they were in her possession , and so very naked . Being of a nervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise . When she handled them the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and jacket . After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her , and , pulling some huge burdock leaves , parsley , and other rank growths from the hedge , she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these , so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature . "
37504	37809	37184	37184	I	0	" she said . But she was still in a trembling state , and seemed almost to wish she had not bought the figures . Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus 's arm was not broken , she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main one , and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to which she was attached . Her purchases were taken straight up to her own chamber , and she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was her very own property ; but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped them in large sheets of brown paper , and stood them on the floor in a corner . The mistress of the house , Miss Fontover , was an elderly lady in spectacles , dressed almost like an abbess ; a dab at Ritual , as become one of her business , and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St. Silas , in the suburb of Beersheba before - mentioned , which Jude also had begun to attend . She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced circumstances , and at his death , which had occurred several years before this date , she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable proportions . She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only ornament , and knew the Christian Year by heart . She now came to call Sue to tea , and , finding that the girl did not respond for a moment , entered the room just as the other was hastily putting a string round each parcel . "
37819	37828	37816	37817	Miss Bridehead	251	" she asked , regarding the enwrapped objects . "
37838	37842	37816	37817	Miss Bridehead	251	" said Sue . "
37856	37899	37849	37849	I	0	" said Miss Fontover , looking round at the Gothic - framed prints of saints , the Church - text scrolls , and other articles which , having become too stale to sell , had been used to furnish this obscure chamber . "
37907	37932	37942	37942	you	1176	" She tore a little hole , about as big as a wafer , in the brown paper , and tried to peep in . "
37946	37947	37942	37942	you	1176	" "
37961	37962	37954	37959	a travelling man who sells casts	1179	" "

38012	38483	37982	37984	St. Mary Magdalen	253	" These little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects and looking at them ; and at bedtime , when she was sure of being undisturbed , she unrobed the divinities in comfort . Placing the pair of figures on the chest of drawers , a candle on each side of them , she withdrew to the bed , flung herself down thereon , and began reading a book she had taken from her box , which Miss Fontover knew nothing of . It was a volume of Gibbon , and she read the chapter dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate . Occasionally she looked up at the statuettes , which appeared strange and out of place , there happening to be a Calvary print hanging between them , and , as if the scene suggested the action , she at length jumped up and withdrew another book from her box - a volume of verse - and turned to the familiar poem - Thou hast conquered , O pale Galilean : The world has grown grey from thy breath ! which she read to the end . Presently she put out the candles , undressed , and finally extinguished her own light . She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly , yet to - night she kept waking up , and every time she opened her eyes there was enough diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures , standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment of text and martyr , and the Gothic - framed Crucifix - picture that was only discernible now as a Latin cross , the figure thereon being obscured by the shades . On one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour . It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his books at a not very distant spot in the same city . Being Saturday night the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his alarm - clock to call him at his usually early time , and hence he had stayed up , as was his custom , two or three hours later than he could afford to do on any other day of the week . Just then he was earnestly reading from his Griesbach 's text . At the very time that Sue was tossing and staring at her figures , the policeman and belated citizens passing along under his window might have heard , if they had stood still , strange syllables mumbled with fervour within - words that had for Jude an indescribable enchantment : inexplicable sounds something like these : - "
38501	38519	37982	37984	St. Mary Magdalen	253	" Till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness , as a book was heard to close : - "
38535	39244	37982	37984	St. Mary Magdalen	253	" IV He was a handy man at his trade , an all - round man , as artizans in country - towns are apt to be . In London the man who carves the boss or knob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which merges in that leafage , as if it were a degradation to do the second half of one whole . When there was not much Gothic moulding for Jude to run , or much window - tracery on the bankers , he would go out lettering monuments or tombstones , and take a pleasure in the change of handiwork . The next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing a job of this sort inside one of the churches . There was a short morning service , and when the parson entered Jude came down from his ladder , and sat with the half - dozen people forming the congregation , till the prayer should be ended , and he could resume his tapping . He did not observe till the service was half over that one of the women was Sue , who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover thither . Jude sat watching her pretty shoulders , her easy , curiously nonchalant risings and sittings , and her perfunctory genuflexions , and thought what a help such an Anglican would have been to him in happier circumstances . It was not so much his anxiety to get on with his work that made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began to take their leave : it was that he dared not , in this holy spot , confront the woman who was beginning to influence him in such an indescribable manner . Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead , now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind , loomed as stubbornly as ever . But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone ; that the particular man Jude , at any rate , wanted something to love . Some men would have rushed incontinently to her , snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she could hardly refuse , and have left the rest to chance . Not so Jude - at first . But as the days , and still more particularly the lonely evenings , dragged along , he found himself , to his moral consternation , to be thinking more of her instead of thinking less of her , and experiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic , informal , and unexpected . Surrounded by her influence all day , walking past the spots she frequented , he was always thinking of her , and was obliged to own to himself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in this battle . To be sure she was almost an ideality to him still . Perhaps to know her would be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized passion . A voice whispered that , though he desired to know her , he did not desire to be cured . There was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of view the situation was growing immoral . For Sue to be the loved one of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella and none other unto his life 's end , was a pretty bad second beginning when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed . This conviction was so real with him that one day when , as was frequent , he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone , he felt it to be his duty to pray against his weakness . But much as he wished to be an exemplar in these things he could not get on . It was quite impossible , he found , to ask to be delivered from temptation when your heart 's desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven . So he excused himself . "
39248	39252	37982	37984	St. Mary Magdalen	253	" he said , "
39302	39388	39276	39276	she	1181	" Thus he went on adoring her , fearing to realize that it was human perversity . For whatever Sue 's virtues , talents , or ecclesiastical saturation , it was certain that those items were not at all the cause of his affection for her . On an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone - mason 's yard with some hesitation , and , lifting her skirts to avoid draggling them in the white dust , crossed towards the office . "
39395	39406	39391	39393	a nice girl	1182	" said one of the men known as Uncle Joe . "
39411	39415	39409	39409	she	1181	" asked another . "
39486	39554	39480	39480	she	1181	" Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if Mr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard . It so happened that Jude had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon , which information she received with a look of disappointment , and went away immediately . When Jude returned they told him , and described her , whereupon he exclaimed , "
39563	40040	39561	39561	Sue	174	" He looked along the street after her , but she was out of sight . He had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her , and resolved to call upon her that very evening . And when he reached his lodging he found a note from her - a first note - one of those documents which , simple and commonplace in themselves , are seen retrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences . The very unconsciousness of a looming drama which is shown in such innocent first epistles from women to men , or vice versa , makes them , when such a drama follows , and they are read over by the purple or lurid light of it , all the more impressive , solemn , and in cases , terrible . Sue 's was of the most artless and natural kind . She addressed him as her dear cousin Jude ; said she had only just learnt by the merest accident that he was living in Christminster , and reproached him with not letting her know . They might have had such nice times together , she said , for she was thrown much upon herself , and had hardly any congenial friend . But now there was every probability of her soon going away , so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps for ever . A cold sweat overspread Jude at the news that she was going away . That was a contingency he had never thought of , and it spurred him to write all the more quickly to her . He would meet her that very evening , he said , one hour from the time of writing , at the cross in the pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms . When he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his hurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors , when he might have said he would call upon her . It was , in fact , the country custom to meet thus , and nothing else had occurred to him . Arabella had been met in the same way , unfortunately , and it might not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue . However , it could not be helped now , and he moved towards the point a few minutes before the hour , under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps . The broad street was silent , and almost deserted , although it was not late . He saw a figure on the other side , which turned out to be hers , and they both converged towards the crossmark at the same moment . Before either had reached it she called out to him : "
40063	40126	40127	40127	I	0	" The voice , though positive and silvery , had been tremulous . They walked on in parallel lines , and , waiting her pleasure , Jude watched till she showed signs of closing in , when he did likewise , the place being where the carriers ' carts stood in the daytime , though there was none on the spot then . "
40143	40153	40131	40131	I	0	" began Jude with the bashfulness of a lover . "
40168	40169	40155	40155	I	0	" "
40178	40188	40172	40172	I	0	" she said with the freedom of a friend . "
40249	40267	40242	40242	I	0	" She looked him up and down curiously , though Jude did not look much at her . "
40279	40283	40268	40268	You	0	" she added . "
40294	40295	40286	40286	I	0	" "
40315	40316	40310	40310	I	0	" "
40378	40379	40375	40375	he	1191	" "
40409	40410	40403	40403	He	163	" "
40442	40443	40440	40440	Richard	258	" "
40463	40464	40466	40466	he	163	" "
40472	40540	40466	40466	he	163	" Jude 's countenance fell , for how could he succeed in an enterprise wherein the great Phillotson had failed ? He would have had a day of despair if the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue 's presence , but even at this moment he had visions of how Phillotson 's failure in the grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone . "
40558	40563	40551	40551	we	1197	" said Jude suddenly . "
40569	40768	40551	40551	we	1197	" She agreed , and they went along up a hill , and through some prettily wooded country . Presently the embattled tower and square turret of the church rose into the sky , and then the school - house . They inquired of a person in the street if Mr. Phillotson was likely to be at home , and were informed that he was always at home . A knock brought him to the school - house door , with a candle in his hand and a look of inquiry on his face , which had grown thin and careworn since Jude last set eyes on him . That after all these years the meeting with Mr. Phillotson should be of this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had surrounded the school - master 's figure in Jude 's imagination ever since their parting . It created in him at the same time a sympathy with Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man . Jude told him his name , and said he had come to see him as an old friend who had been kind to him in his youthful days . "
40778	40786	40769	40769	I	0	" said the school - master thoughtfully . "
40833	40834	40794	40794	you	0	" "
40841	40851	40794	40794	you	0	" said Jude , wishing he had not come . "
40870	40871	40864	40866	an old pupil	1200	" "
40896	40897	40892	40892	you	0	" "
40910	40911	40892	40892	you	0	" "
40993	40994	40995	40995	I	0	" "
41022	41023	41024	41024	I	0	" "
41053	41054	41004	41004	I	0	" "
41058	41062	41004	41004	I	0	" said Phillotson . "
41069	41453	41004	41004	I	0	" They entered the parlour of the school - house , where there was a lamp with a paper shade , which threw the light down on three or four books . Phillotson took it off , so that they could see each other better , and the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious dark eyes and hair of Sue , on the earnest features of her cousin , and on the schoolmaster 's own maturer face and figure , showing him to be a spare and thoughtful personage of five - and - forty , with a thin - lipped , somewhat refined mouth , a slightly stooping habit , and a black frock coat , which from continued frictions shone a little at the shoulder - blades , the middle of the back , and the elbows . The old friendship was imperceptibly renewed , the schoolmaster speaking of his experiences , and the cousins of theirs . He told them that he still thought of the Church sometimes , and that though he could not enter it as he had intended to do in former years he might enter it as a licentiate . Meanwhile , he said , he was comfortable in his present position , though he was in want of a pupil - teacher . They did not stay to supper , Sue having to be indoors before it grew late , and the road was retraced to Christminster . Though they had talked of nothing more than general subjects , Jude was surprised to find what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him . She was so vibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling . An exciting thought would make her walk ahead so fast that he could hardly keep up with her ; and her sensitiveness on some points was such that it might have been misread as vanity . It was with heart - sickness he perceived that , while her sentiments towards him were those of the frankest friendliness only , he loved her more than before becoming acquainted with her ; and the gloom of the walk home lay not in the night overhead , but in the thought of her departure . "
41460	41465	41456	41456	you	1209	" he said regretfully . "
41494	41495	41498	41498	they	1211	" "
41532	41536	41524	41524	I	0	" She laughed . "
41543	41547	41539	41539	I	0	" she continued . "
41576	41577	41602	41602	She	249	" "
41583	41584	41585	41585	She	249	" "
41592	41593	41585	41585	She	249	" "
41598	41599	41602	41602	She	249	" "
41658	41659	41651	41651	her	249	" "
41685	41686	41672	41672	she	249	" "
41704	41705	41697	41697	She	249	" "
41713	41714	41709	41709	I	0	" "
41770	41771	41775	41775	you	0	" "
41787	41788	41780	41780	You	0	" "
41807	41808	41780	41780	You	0	" "
41866	41867	41871	41871	him	163	" "
41908	41991	41901	41902	our parents	1225	" Jude did not like to let her see quite how much he agreed with her , and went his way to the remote street in which he had his lodging . To keep Sue Bridehead near him was now a desire which operated without regard of consequences , and the next evening he again set out for Lumsdon , fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note only . The school - master was unprepared for such a proposal . "
42008	42012	42035	42035	she	1208	" he said . "
42048	43012	42038	42038	she	1208	" Jude said she was disposed to do so , he thought , and his ingenious arguments on her natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson , of which Jude knew nothing whatever , so influenced the schoolmaster that he said he would engage her , assuring Jude as a friend that unless his cousin really meant to follow on in the same course , and regarded this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship , of which her training in a normal school would be the second stage , her time would be wasted quite , the salary being merely nominal . The day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude , containing the information that he had again consulted his cousin , who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition ; and that she had agreed to come . It did not occur for a moment to the schoolmaster and recluse that Jude 's ardour in promoting the arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the instinct of co - operation common among members of the same family . V The schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school , both being modern erections ; and he looked across the way at the old house in which his teacher Sue had a lodging . The arrangement had been concluded very quickly . A pupil - teacher who was to have been transferred to Mr. Phillotson 's school had failed him , and Sue had been taken as stop - gap . All such provisional arrangements as these could only last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector , whose approval was necessary to make them permanent . Having taught for some two years in London , though she had abandoned that vocation of late , Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice , and Phillotson thought there would be no difficulty in retaining her services , which he already wished to do , though she had only been with him three or four weeks . He had found her quite as bright as Jude had described her ; and what master - tradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who saves him half his labour ? It was a little over half - past eight o'clock in the morning and he was waiting to see her cross the road to the school , when he would follow . At twenty minutes to nine she did cross , a light hat tossed on her head ; and he watched her as a curiosity . A new emanation , which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher , seemed to surround her this morning . He went to the school also , and Sue remained governing her class at the other end of the room , all day under his eye . She certainly was an excellent teacher . It was part of his duty to give her private lessons in the evening , and some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable , elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and the taught were of different sexes . Richard Phillotson thought of the absurdity of the regulation in this case , when he was old enough to be the girl 's father ; but he faithfully acted up to it ; and sat down with her in a room where Mrs. Hawes , the widow at whose house Sue lodged , occupied herself with sewing . The regulation was , indeed , not easy to evade , for there was no other sitting - room in the dwelling . Sometimes as she figured - it was arithmetic that they were working at - she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile at him , as if she assumed that , being the master , he must perceive all that was passing in her brain , as right or wrong . Phillotson was not really thinking of the arithmetic at all , but of her , in a novel way which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor . Perhaps she knew that he was thinking of her thus . For a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in itself was a delight to him . Then it happened that the children were to be taken to Christminster to see an itinerant exhibition , in the shape of a model of Jerusalem , to which schools were admitted at a penny a head in the interests of education . They marched along the road two and two , she beside her class with her simple cotton sunshade , her little thumb cocked up against its stem ; and Phillotson behind in his long dangling coat , handling his walking - stick genteelly , in the musing mood which had come over him since her arrival . The afternoon was one of sun and dust , and when they entered the exhibition room few people were present but themselves . The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment , and the proprietor , with a fine religious philanthropy written on his features , walked round it with a pointer in his hand , showing the young people the various quarters and places known to them by name from reading their Bibles ; Mount Moriah , the Valley of Jehoshaphat , the City of Zion , the walls and the gates , outside one of which there was a large mound like a tumulus , and on the mound a little white cross . The spot , he said , was Calvary . "
43016	43034	42038	42038	she	1208	" said Sue to the schoolmaster , as she stood with him a little in the background , "
43073	43074	43068	43069	this man	4146	" "
43096	43097	43068	43069	this man	4146	" "
43107	43111	43098	43098	I	0	" she said , "
43152	43153	43068	43069	this man	4146	" "
43166	43227	43068	43069	this man	4146	" She was silent , for she was easily repressed ; and then perceived behind the group of children clustered round the model a young man in a white flannel jacket , his form being bent so low in his intent inspection of the Valley of Jehoshaphat that his face was almost hidden from view by the Mount of Olives . "
43234	43239	43240	43240	He	180	" continued the schoolmaster . "
43251	43252	43240	43240	He	180	" "
43261	43271	43272	43272	Jude	180	" she cried in her quick , light voice . "
43282	43294	43297	43297	Sue	174	" Jude started up from his reverie , and saw her . "
43299	43310	43297	43297	Sue	174	" he said , with a glad flush of embarrassment . "
43391	43392	43393	43393	Your	174	" "
43405	43415	43416	43416	She	1208	" said Phillotson , with good - humoured satire . "
43425	43426	43400	43400	she	1208	" "
43458	43463	43464	43464	I	0	" answered Sue sensitively . "
43486	43487	43481	43481	you	163	" "
43493	43502	43488	43488	I	0	" said Jude ardently although he did not . "
43511	43512	43506	43506	you	163	" "
43526	43776	43521	43521	YOU	163	" She impulsively seized his hand , and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster turned away to Jude , her voice revealing a tremor which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle . She had not the least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at this momentary revelation of feeling , and what a complication she was building up thereby in the futures of both . The model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not to tire of it soon , and a little later in the afternoon they were all marched back to Lumsdon , Jude returning to his work . He watched the juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores , filing down the street towards the country beside Phillotson and Sue , and a sad , dissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters ' lives had possession of him . Phillotson had invited him to walk out and see them on Friday evening , when there would be no lessons to give to Sue , and Jude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the opportunity . Meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards , and the next day , on looking on the blackboard in Sue 's class , Phillotson was surprised to find upon it , skilfully drawn in chalk , a perspective view of Jerusalem , with every building shown in its place . "
43793	43797	43798	43798	I	0	" he said . "
43802	43806	43798	43798	I	0	" said she , "
43815	43816	43808	43808	I	0	" "
43826	43842	43808	43808	I	0	" Her Majesty 's school - inspector was at that time paying ' surprise - visits "
44068	44076	44077	44077	she	174	" You ought to have told me , "
44081	44123	44077	44077	she	174	" that one of the inspector 's surprise - visits was imminent ! Oh , what shall I do ! Now he 'll write and tell the managers that I am no good , and I shall be disgraced for ever ! "
44124	44145	44146	44146	He	163	" He wo n't do that , my dear little girl . You are the best teacher ever I had ! "
44516	44529	44531	44531	Jude	180	" Oh , he 's too old for her - too old ! "
44824	44830	44816	44816	his	180	" Was Sue born here ? "
44831	44854	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" She was - in this room . They were living here at that time . What made ' ee ask that ? "
44855	44863	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Oh - I wanted to know . "
44864	44872	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Now you 've been seeing her ! "
44879	44888	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" And what did I tell ' ee ? "
44889	44900	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Well - that I was not to see her . "
44901	44908	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Have you gossiped with her ? "
44909	44912	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Yes . "
44913	45050	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Then do n't keep it up . She was brought up by her father to hate her mother 's family ; and she 'll look with no favour upon a working chap like you - a townish girl as she 's become by now . I never cared much about her . A pert little thing , that 's what she was too often , with her tight - strained nerves . Many 's the time I 've smacked her for her impertinence . Why , one day when she was walking into the pond with her shoes and stockings off , and her petticoats pulled above her knees , afore I could cry out for shame , she said : ' Move on , Aunty ! This is no sight for modest eyes ! ' "
45051	45059	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" She was a little child then . "
45060	45068	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" She was twelve if a day . "
45069	45096	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Well - of course . But now she 's older she 's of a thoughtful , quivering , tender nature , and as sensitive as - "
45097	45100	45102	45103	his aunt	555	" Jude ! "
45110	45120	45102	45103	his aunt	555	" Do n't you be a fool about her ! "
45121	45130	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" No , no , of course not . "
45131	45249	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man could possibly do for himself by trying hard . But she 's gone to the other side of the world , and med never trouble you again . And there 'll be a worse thing if you , tied and bound as you be , should have a fancy for Sue . If your cousin is civil to you , take her civility for what it is worth . But anything more than a relation 's good wishes it is stark madness for ' ee to give her . If she 's townish and wanton it med bring ' ee to ruin . "
45250	45265	44874	44877	the harsh old woman	1279	" Do n't say anything against her , Aunt ! Do n't , please ! "
45363	45376	45379	45379	she	174	" in her little white frock , and shoes , and pink sash "

He hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street , which he followed till it merged in the highway , and all sound of his late companions had been left behind . Onward he still went , under the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world to whom it seemed possible to fly - an unreasoning desire , whose ill judgement was not apparent to him now . In the course of an hour , when it was between ten and eleven o'clock , he entered the village of Lumsdon , and reaching the cottage , saw that a light was burning in a downstairs room , which he assumed , rightly as it happened , to be hers . Jude stepped close to the wall , and tapped with his finger on the pane , saying impatiently , "
50396	50435	50394	50394	Sue	174	" She must have recognized his voice , for the light disappeared from the apartment , and in a second or two the door was unlocked and opened , and Sue appeared with a candle in her hand . "

50625	50682	50683	50683	Dear	795	" With one hand holding the candle and the other supporting him , she led him indoors , and placed him in the only easy chair the meagrely furnished house afforded , stretching his feet upon another , and pulling off his boots . Jude , now getting towards his sober senses , could only say , "
50688	51201	50685	50686	dear Sue	174	" in a voice broken by grief and contrition . She asked him if he wanted anything to eat , but he shook his head . Then telling him to go to sleep , and that she would come down early in the morning and get him some breakfast , she bade him good - night and ascended the stairs . Almost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber , and did not wake till dawn . At first he did not know where he was , but by degrees his situation cleared to him , and he beheld it in all the ghastliness of a right mind . She knew the worst of him - the very worst . How could he face her now ? She would soon be coming down to see about breakfast , as she had said , and there would he be in all his shame confronting her . He could not bear the thought , and softly drawing on his boots , and taking his hat from the nail on which she had hung it , he slipped noiselessly out of the house . His fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide , and perhaps pray ; and the only spot which occurred to him was Marygreen . He called at his lodging in Christminster , where he found awaiting him a note of dismissal from his employer ; and having packed up he turned his back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his side , and struck southward into Wessex . He had no money left in his pocket , his small savings , deposited at one of the banks in Christminster , having fortunately been left untouched . To get to Marygreen , therefore , his only course was walking ; and the distance being nearly twenty miles , he had ample time to complete on the way the sobering process begun in him . At some hour of the evening he reached Alfredston . Here he pawned his waistcoat , and having gone out of the town a mile or two , slept under a rick that night . At dawn he rose , shook off the hayseeds and stems from his clothes , and started again , breasting the long white road up the hill to the downs , which had been visible to him a long way off , and passing the milestone at the top , whereon he had carved his hopes years ago . He reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast . Weary and mud - bespattered , but quite possessed of his ordinary clearness of brain , he sat down by the well , thinking as he did so what a poor Christ he made . Seeing a trough of water near he bathed his face , and went on to the cottage of his great - aunt , whom he found breakfasting in bed , attended by the woman who lived with her . "
51209	51251	50685	50686	dear Sue	174	" asked his relative , regarding him through eyes sunken deep , under lids heavy as pot - covers , no other cause for his tumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been a struggle with material things . "
51254	51259	50685	50686	dear Sue	174	" said Jude heavily . "
51269	51324	50685	50686	dear Sue	174	" Refreshed by some breakfast , he went up to his old room and lay down in his shirt - sleeves , after the manner of the artizan . He fell asleep for a short while , and when he awoke it was as if he had awakened in hell . It WAS hell - "
51331	51583	50685	50686	dear Sue	174	" both in ambition and in love . He thought of that previous abyss into which he had fallen before leaving this part of the country ; the deepest deep he had supposed it then ; but it was not so deep as this . That had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope : this was of his second line . If he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous tension which he was now undergoing . But that relief being denied to his virility , he clenched his teeth in misery , bringing lines about his mouth like those in the Laocoon , and corrugations between his brows . A mournful wind blew through the trees , and sounded in the chimney like the pedal notes of an organ . Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall of the churchless church - yard hard by , now abandoned , pecked its neighbour smartly , and the vane on the new Victorian - Gothic church in the new spot had already begun to creak . Yet apparently it was not always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs ; it was a voice . He guessed its origin in a moment or two ; the curate was praying with his aunt in the adjoining room . He remembered her speaking of him . Presently the sounds ceased , and a step seemed to cross the landing . Jude sat up , and shouted "
51586	51610	50685	50686	dear Sue	174	" The step made for his door , which was open , and a man looked in . It was a young clergyman . "
51618	51622	51613	51613	you	1484	" said Jude . "
51677	51731	51663	51663	I	0	" Slowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements , by an unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious side of his dream , and more upon the theological , though this had , up till now , been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement . "
51748	51754	51738	51739	a fool	3943	" added Jude in conclusion . "
51825	51849	51807	51807	I	0	" The curate , who was a new man to this neighbourhood , had grown deeply interested , and at last he said : "
51905	51906	51907	51907	I	0	" "
51925	51930	51907	51907	I	0	" Part Third AT MELCHESTER "
51944	53431	53432	53432	You	1499	" - SAPPHO H. T. Wharton . I It was a new idea - the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct from the intellectual and emulative life . A man could preach and do good to his fellow - creatures without taking double - firsts in the schools of Christminster , or having anything but ordinary knowledge . The old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the bishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all , but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice . He feared that his whole scheme had degenerated to , even though it might not have originated in , a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler instincts ; which was purely an artificial product of civilization . There were thousands of young men on the same self - seeking track at the present moment . The sensual hind who ate , drank , and lived carelessly with his wife through the days of his vanity was a more likable being than he . But to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way that he could not in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than that of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village or city slum - that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in it ; that might be true religion , and a purgatorial course worthy of being followed by a remorseful man . The favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by contrast with his foregone intentions cheered Jude , as he sat there , shabby and lonely ; and it may be said to have given , during the next few days , the coup de grace to his intellectual career - a career which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years . He did nothing , however , for some long stagnant time to advance his new desire , occupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and lettering headstones about the neighbouring villages , and submitting to be regarded as a social failure , a returned purchase , by the half - dozen or so of farmers and other country - people who condescended to nod to him . The human interest of the new intention - and a human interest is indispensable to the most spiritual and self - sacrificing - was created by a letter from Sue , bearing a fresh postmark . She evidently wrote with anxiety , and told very little about her own doings , more than that she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen 's Scholarship , and was going to enter a training college at Melchester to complete herself for the vocation she had chosen , partly by his influence . There was a theological college at Melchester ; Melchester was a quiet and soothing place , almost entirely ecclesiastical in its tone ; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no establishment ; where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not . As it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work at his trade while reading up Divinity , which he had neglected at Christminster for the ordinary classical grind , what better course for him than to get employment at the further city , and pursue this plan of reading ? That his excessive human interest in the new place was entirely of Sue 's making , while at the same time Sue was to be regarded even less than formerly as proper to create it , had an ethical contradictoriness to which he was not blind . But that much he conceded to human frailty , and hoped to learn to love her only as a friend and kinswoman . He considered that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin his ministry at the age of thirty - an age which much attracted him as being that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in Galilee . This would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study , and for acquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the necessary terms at a theological college . Christmas had come and passed , and Sue had gone to the Melchester Normal School . The time was just the worst in the year for Jude to get into new employment , and he had written suggesting to her that he should postpone his arrival for a month or so , till the days had lengthened . She had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not proposed it - she evidently did not much care about him , though she had never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to her that night , and his silent disappearance . Neither had she ever said a word about her relations with Mr. Phillotson . Suddenly , however , quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue . She was quite lonely and miserable , she told him . She hated the place she was in ; it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer 's ; worse than anywhere . She felt utterly friendless ; could he come immediately ? - though when he did come she would only be able to see him at limited times , the rules of the establishment she found herself in being strict to a degree . It was Mr. Phillotson who had advised her to come there , and she wished she had never listened to him . Phillotson 's suit was not exactly prospering , evidently ; and Jude felt unreasonably glad . He packed up his things and went to Melchester with a lighter heart than he had known for months . This being the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for a temperance hotel , and found a little establishment of that description in the street leading from the station . When he had had something to eat he walked out into the dull winter light over the town bridge , and turned the corner towards the Close . The day was foggy , and standing under the walls of the most graceful architectural pile in England he paused and looked up . The lofty building was visible as far as the roofridge ; above , the dwindling spire rose more and more remotely , till its apex was quite lost in the mist drifting across it . The lamps now began to be lighted , and turning to the west front he walked round . He took it as a good omen that numerous blocks of stone were lying about , which signified that the cathedral was undergoing restoration or repair to a considerable extent . It seemed to him , full of the superstitions of his beliefs , that this was an exercise of forethought on the part of a ruling Power , that he might find plenty to do in the art he practised while waiting for a call to higher labours . Then a wave of warmth came over him as he thought how near he now stood to the bright - eyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead and pile of dark hair above it ; the girl with the kindling glance , daringly soft at times - something like that of the girls he had seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school . She was here - actually in this Close - in one of the houses confronting this very west facade . He went down the broad gravel path towards the building . It was an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century , once a palace , now a training - school , with mullioned and transomed windows , and a courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall . Jude opened the gate and went up to the door through which , on inquiring for his cousin , he was gingerly admitted to a waiting - room , and in a few minutes she came . Though she had been here such a short while , she was not as he had seen her last . All her bounding manner was gone ; her curves of motion had become subdued lines . The screens and subtleties of convention had likewise disappeared . Yet neither was she quite the woman who had written the letter that summoned him . That had plainly been dashed off in an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat regretted ; thoughts that were possibly of his recent self - disgrace . Jude was quite overcome with emotion . "
53457	53458	53455	53455	Sue	174	" "
53503	53989	53496	53496	I	0	" She wore a murrey - coloured gown with a little lace collar . It was made quite plain , and hung about her slight figure with clinging gracefulness . Her hair , which formerly she had worn according to the custom of the day was now twisted up tightly , and she had altogether the air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline , an under - brightness shining through from the depths which that discipline had not yet been able to reach . She had come forward prettily , but Jude felt that she had hardly expected him to kiss her , as he was burning to do , under other colours than those of cousinship . He could not perceive the least sign that Sue regarded him as a lover , or ever would do so , now that she knew the worst of him , even if he had the right to behave as one ; and this helped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial entanglement , which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer dread of losing the bliss of her company . Sue came out into the town with him , and they walked and talked with tongues centred only on the passing moments . Jude said he would like to buy her a little present of some sort , and then she confessed , with something of shame , that she was dreadfully hungry . They were kept on very short allowances in the college , and a dinner , tea , and supper all in one was the present she most desired in the world . Jude thereupon took her to an inn and ordered whatever the house afforded , which was not much . The place , however , gave them a delightful opportunity for a tete - a - tete , nobody else being in the room , and they talked freely . She told him about the school as it was at that date , and the rough living , and the mixed character of her fellow - students , gathered together from all parts of the diocese , and how she had to get up and work by gas - light in the early morning , with all the bitterness of a young person to whom restraint was new . To all this he listened ; but it was not what he wanted especially to know - her relations with Phillotson . That was what she did not tell . When they had sat and eaten , Jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers ; she looked up and smiled , and took his quite freely into her own little soft one , dividing his fingers and coolly examining them , as if they were the fingers of a glove she was purchasing .

54248	54249	54239	54239	I	0	" "
54266	54292	54293	54293	I	0	" Her ever - sensitive lip began to quiver , and her eye to blink , at something this reproof was deciding her to say . "
54315	54316	54309	54309	I	0	" "
54324	54329	54322	54322	dear	795	" he said soothingly . "
54347	54348	54349	54349	I	0	" "
54354	54367	54352	54352	you	163	" said she , with the perverseness that was part of her . "
54450	54451	54454	54454	Sue	174	" "
54471	54519	54520	54520	I	0	" He glanced at her and their eyes met , the reproach in his own belying his words . Then he drew his hand quite away from hers , and turned his face in estrangement from her to the window . Sue regarded him passively without moving . "
54527	54538	54522	54522	you	1517	" she said with an air of no emotion whatever . "
54582	54610	54614	54614	we	1518	" This was just the one thing he would not be able to bear , as she probably knew , and it brought him round at once . "
54617	54622	54614	54614	we	1518	" he said quickly . "
54651	54652	54648	54648	I	0	" "
54687	54705	54678	54678	one	810	" She was something of a riddle to him , and he let the subject drift away . "
54715	54725	54678	54678	one	810	" he asked , when their meal was finished . "
54742	54755	54733	54733	I	0	" she answered , a remnant of vexation still in her voice . "
54773	54774	54825	54825	I	0	" "
54780	54781	54825	54825	I	0	" "
54844	54849	54832	54832	I	0	" Jude looked distressed . "
54861	54865	54852	54852	I	0	" she cried . "
54930	55359	54921	54921	I	0	" He took her to the gate and they parted . Jude had a conviction that his unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this marriage engagement , and it did anything but add to his happiness . Her reproach had taken that shape , then , and not the shape of words . However , next day he set about seeking employment , which it was not so easy to get as at Christminster , there being , as a rule , less stone - cutting in progress in this quiet city , and hands being mostly permanent . But he edged himself in by degrees . His first work was some carving at the cemetery on the hill ; and ultimately he became engaged on the labour he most desired - the cathedral repairs , which were very extensive , the whole interior stonework having been overhauled , to be largely replaced by new . It might be a labour of years to get it all done , and he had confidence enough in his own skill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of choice with himself how long he would stay . The lodgings he took near the Close Gate would not have disgraced a curate , the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than mechanics of any sort usually care to pay . His combined bed and sitting - room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories and deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in her time , and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece inscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same serious - minded woman by her fellow - servants on the occasion of her marriage . Jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking photographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he had executed with his own hands ; and he was deemed a satisfactory acquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment . He found an ample supply of theological books in the city book - shops , and with these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and direction from his former course . As a relaxation from the Fathers , and such stock works as Paley and Butler , he read Newman , Pusey , and many other modern lights . He hired a harmonium , set it up in his lodging , and practised chants thereon , single and double . II "

55411	55412	55404	55404	I	0	" "
55434	55435	55402	55402	Jude	180	" "

55489	55594	55485	55485	We	1527	" Their conversation had run thus some few weeks later , and next morning they prepared to start . Every detail of the outing was a facet reflecting a sparkle to Jude , and he did not venture to meditate on the life of inconsistency he was leading . His Sue 's conduct was one lovely conundrum to him ; he could say no more . There duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her ; her emergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume that was rather enforced than desired ; the traipsing along to the station , the porters ' "
55599	55695	55485	55485	We	1527	" the screaming of the trains - everything formed the basis of a beautiful crystallization . Nobody stared at Sue , because she was so plainly dressed , which comforted Jude in the thought that only himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued . A matter of ten pounds spent in a drapery - shop , which had no connection with her real life or her real self , would have set all Melchester staring . The guard of the train thought they were lovers , and put them into a compartment all by themselves . "
55703	56238	55485	55485	We	1527	" said she . Jude did not respond . He thought the remark unnecessarily cruel , and partly untrue . They reached the park and castle and wandered through the picture - galleries , Jude stopping by preference in front of the devotional pictures by Del Sarto , Guido Reni , Spagnoletto , Sassoferrato , Carlo Dolci , and others . Sue paused patiently beside him , and stole critical looks into his face as , regarding the Virgins , Holy Families , and Saints , it grew reverent and abstracted . When she had thoroughly estimated him at this , she would move on and wait for him before a Lely or Reynolds . It was evident that her cousin deeply interested her , as one might be interested in a man puzzling out his way along a labyrinth from which one had one 's self escaped . When they came out a long time still remained to them and Jude proposed that as soon as they had had something to eat they should walk across the high country to the north of their present position , and intercept the train of another railway leading back to Melchester , at a station about seven miles off . Sue , who was inclined for any adventure that would intensify the sense of her day 's freedom , readily agreed ; and away they went , leaving the adjoining station behind them . It was indeed open country , wide and high . They talked and bounded on , Jude cutting from a little covert a long walking - stick for Sue as tall as herself , with a great crook , which made her look like a shepherdess . About half - way on their journey they crossed a main road running due east and west - the old road from London to Land 's End . They paused , and looked up and down it for a moment , and remarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively thoroughfare , while the wind dipped to earth and scooped straws and hay - stems from the ground . They crossed the road and passed on , but during the next half - mile Sue seemed to grow tired , and Jude began to be distressed for her . They had walked a good distance altogether , and if they could not reach the other station it would be rather awkward . For a long time there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and turnip - land ; but presently they came to a sheepfold , and next to the shepherd , pitching hurdles . He told them that the only house near was his mother 's and his , pointing to a little dip ahead from which a faint blue smoke arose , and recommended them to go on and rest there . This they did , and entered the house , admitted by an old woman without a single tooth , to whom they were as civil as strangers can be when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of the householder . "
56244	56248	55485	55485	We	1527	" said Jude . "
56304	56315	56319	56319	ee	1537	" They sat resting , and the shepherd came in . "
56323	56334	56319	56319	ee	1537	" he said with a deprecating wave of the hand ; "
56403	56408	56409	56409	You	1535	" They started up . "
56447	56456	56458	56458	you	1535	" He turned to Jude and asked privately : "
56463	56464	56458	56458	you	1535	" "
56469	56473	56458	56458	you	1535	" said Jude . "
56531	56561	56524	56524	You	1535	" On consideration they decided to close with this offer , and drew up and shared with the shepherd and his mother the boiled bacon and greens for supper . "
56567	56580	56562	56562	I	0	" said Sue , while their entertainers were clearing away the dishes . "
56589	56590	56562	56562	I	0	" "
56610	56625	56602	56602	you	1535	" said Jude , a recollection of her engagement reviving his soreness a little . "
56656	56657	56641	56641	I	0	" "
56678	56679	56665	56665	You	1535	" "
56695	56696	56686	56686	You	1535	" "
56699	56700	56701	56702	The Ishmaelite	286	" "
56704	56705	56701	56702	The Ishmaelite	286	" "
56714	56793	56706	56708	An urban miss	1547	" She looked severe disagreement , and turned away . The shepherd aroused them the next morning , as he had said . It was bright and clear , and the four miles to the train were accomplished pleasantly . When they had reached Melchester , and walked to the Close , and the gables of the old building in which she was again to be immured rose before Sue 's eyes , she looked a little scared . "
56801	56813	56796	56796	I	0	" she murmured . They rang the great bell and waited . "
56828	56837	56816	56816	I	0	" she said quickly , searching her pocket . "
56852	56853	56848	56848	you	1535	" "
56857	57008	57009	57009	She	1548	" He took it gladly , and the porter came . There seemed to be an ominous glance on his face when he opened the gate . She passed in , looking back at Jude , and waving her hand . III The seventy young women , of ages varying in the main from nineteen to one - and - twenty , though several were older , who at this date filled the species of nunnery known as the Training - School at Melchester , formed a very mixed community , which included the daughters of mechanics , curates , surgeons , shopkeepers , farmers , dairy - men , soldiers , sailors , and villagers . They sat in the large school - room of the establishment on the evening previously described , and word was passed round that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing - time . "
57017	57032	57009	57009	She	1548	" said a second - year 's student , who knew about young men . "
57054	57055	57056	57056	She	1548	" "
57063	57070	57056	57056	She	1548	" observed a youthful new girl . "
57091	57192	57056	57056	She	1548	" said the head girl of the year , drily . The fact was that , only twelve months before , there had occurred a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same statement in order to gain meetings with her lover . The affair had created a scandal , and the management had consequently been rough on cousins ever since . At nine o'clock the names were called , Sue 's being pronounced three times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer . At a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the "
57196	57306	57307	57308	The Weaker	288	" and then knelt down to prayers . After prayers they went in to supper , and every girl 's thought was , Where is Sue Bridehead ? Some of the students , who had seen Jude from the window , felt that they would not mind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being kissed by such a kindly - faced young men . Hardly one among them believed in the cousinship . Half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles , their tender feminine faces upturned to the flaring gas - jets which at intervals stretched down the long dormitories , every face bearing the legend "
57309	57508	57307	57308	The Weaker	288	" upon it , as the penalty of the sex wherein they were moulded , which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and abilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature remain what they are . They formed a pretty , suggestive , pathetic sight , of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious , and would not discover till , amid the storms and strains of after - years , with their injustice , loneliness , child - bearing , and bereavement , their minds would revert to this experience as to something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently regarded . One of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights , and before doing so gave a final glance at Sue 's cot , which remained empty , and at her little dressing - table at the foot , which , like all the rest , was ornamented with various girlish trifles , framed photographs being not the least conspicuous among them . Sue 's table had a moderate show , two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her looking - glass . "
57519	57524	57515	57515	she	1555	" asked the mistress . "
57541	57542	57545	57549	the middle - aged man	1557	" "
57551	57560	57545	57549	the middle - aged man	1557	" said a student in the next bed - "
57571	57572	57568	57569	Mr. Phillotson	163	" "
57588	57589	57590	57590	He	4340	" "
57605	57606	57598	57598	She	1555	" "
57618	57619	57598	57598	She	1555	" "
57622	57623	57598	57598	She	1555	" "
57633	57634	57630	57631	the undergraduate	1455	" "
57647	57968	57639	57645	a young man with a black beard	1563	" The lights were promptly extinguished , and till they fell asleep the girls indulged in conjectures about Sue , and wondered what games she had carried on in London and at Christminster before she came here , some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral opposite , and the spire rising behind it . When they awoke the next morning they glanced into Sue 's nook , to find it still without a tenant . After the early lessons by gas - light , in half - toilet , and when they had come up to dress for breakfast , the bell of the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly . The mistress of the dormitory went away , and presently came back to say that the principal 's orders were that nobody was to speak to Bridehead without permission . When , accordingly , Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy herself , looking flushed and tired , she went to her cubicle in silence , none of them coming out to greet her or to make inquiry . When they had gone downstairs they found that she did not follow them into the dining - hall to breakfast , and they then learnt that she had been severely reprimanded , and ordered to a solitary room for a week , there to be confined , and take her meals , and do all her reading . At this the seventy murmured , the sentence being , they thought , too severe . A round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal , asking for a remission of Sue 's punishment . No notice was taken . Towards evening , when the geography mistress began dictating her subject , the girls in the class sat with folded arms . "
57979	57986	57639	57645	a young man with a black beard	1563	" said the mistress at last . "
58031	58032	58023	58023	We	1568	" "
58041	58047	58033	58033	We	1568	" said the head girl . "
58081	58292	58293	58293	She	1572	" However , they remained stolid and motionless , and the mistress left the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done . Presently , towards dusk , the pupils , as they sat , heard exclamations from the first - year 's girls in an adjoining classroom , and one rushed in to say that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the room in which she had been confined , escaped in the dark across the lawn , and disappeared . How she had managed to get out of the garden nobody could tell , as it was bounded by the river at the bottom , and the side door was locked . They went and looked at the empty room , the casement between the middle mullions of which stood open . The lawn was again searched with a lantern , every bush and shrub being examined , but she was nowhere hidden . Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated , and on reflection he said that he remembered hearing a sort of splashing in the stream at the back , but he had taken no notice , thinking some ducks had come down the river from above . "
58301	58306	58293	58293	She	1572	" said a mistress . "
58311	58660	58661	58661	Jude	180	" said the porter . The mind of the matron was horrified - not so much at the possible death of Sue as at the possible half - column detailing that event in all the newspapers , which , added to the scandal of the year before , would give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to come . More lanterns were procured , and the river examined ; and then , at last , on the opposite shore , which was open to the fields , some little boot - tracks were discerned in the mud , which left no doubt that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water reaching nearly to her shoulders - for this was the chief river of the county , and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect . As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself , the matron began to speak superciliously of her , and to express gladness that she was gone . On the self - same evening Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate . Often at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent Close , and stand opposite the house that contained Sue , and watch the shadows of the girls ' heads passing to and fro upon the blinds , and wish he had nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many of the thoughtless inmates despised . But to - night , having finished tea and brushed himself up , he was deep in the perusal of the Twenty - ninth Volume of Pusey 's Library of the Fathers , a set of books which he had purchased of a second - hand dealer at a price that seemed to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work . He fancied he heard something rattle lightly against his window ; then he heard it again . Certainly somebody had thrown gravel . He rose and gently lifted the sash . "
58663	58667	58668	58668	Sue	174	" from below . "
58670	58671	58668	58668	Sue	174	" "
58685	58686	58678	58678	I	0	" "
58690	58691	58678	58678	I	0	" "
58702	58829	58830	58830	I	0	" Jude waited , knowing that she could enter easily enough , the front door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn , as in most old country towns . He palpitated at the thought that she had fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to her in his . What counterparts they were ! He unlatched the door of his room , heard a stealthy rustle on the dark stairs , and in a moment she appeared in the light of his lamp . He went up to seize her hand , and found she was clammy as a marine deity , and that her clothes clung to her like the robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze . "
58835	58843	58830	58830	I	0	" she said through her chattering teeth . "
58853	58884	58851	58851	Jude	180	" She crossed to his little grate and very little fire , but as the water dripped from her as she moved , the idea of drying herself was absurd . "
58892	58906	58887	58887	you	0	" he asked , with alarm , the tender epithet slipping out unawares . "
58958	58990	58946	58946	I	0	" She had begun the explanation in her usual slightly independent tones , but before she had finished the thin pink lips trembled , and she could hardly refrain from crying . "
58994	58998	58946	58946	I	0	" he said . "
59025	59026	59020	59020	I	0	" "
59055	59056	59049	59049	they	1582	" "
59069	59070	59064	59064	You	289	" "
59074	59075	59064	59064	You	289	" "
59088	59135	59064	59064	You	289	" In fact , everything was close and handy in Jude 's single chamber , because there was not room for it to be otherwise . He opened a drawer , took out his best dark suit , and giving the garments a shake , said , "
59145	59146	59141	59141	I	0	" "
59150	59244	59245	59245	I	0	" Jude left the room and went into the street , where he walked up and down . A clock struck half - past seven , and he returned . Sitting in his only arm - chair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as himself on a Sunday , so pathetic in her defencelessness that his heart felt big with the sense of it . On two other chairs before the fire were her wet garments . She blushed as he sat down beside her , but only for a moment . "
59323	59324	59296	59296	you	180	" "
59353	59354	59344	59344	Sue	289	" "
59373	59407	59366	59366	I	0	" Jude put on her his great - coat in addition , and then ran out to the nearest public - house , whence he returned with a little bottle in his hand . "
59415	59419	59366	59366	I	0	" he said . "
59431	59432	59433	59433	I	0	" "
59444	59650	59442	59442	I	0	" Jude fetched the glass from the dressing - table , and administered the spirit in some water . She gasped a little , but gulped it down , and lay back in the armchair . She then began to relate circumstantially her experiences since they had parted ; but in the middle of her story her voice faltered , her head nodded , and she ceased . She was in a sound sleep . Jude , dying of anxiety lest she should have caught a chill which might permanently injure her , was glad to hear the regular breathing . He softly went nearer to her , and observed that a warm flush now rosed her hitherto blue cheeks , and felt that her hanging hand was no longer cold . Then he stood with his back to the fire regarding her , and saw in her almost a divinity . IV Jude 's reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending the stairs . He whisked Sue 's clothing from the chair where it was drying , thrust it under the bed , and sat down to his book . Somebody knocked and opened the door immediately . It was the landlady . "
59685	59686	59681	59683	a young gentleman	1586	" "
59723	59840	59841	59841	Jude	180	" It was Jude 's custom to go downstairs to the kitchen , and eat his meals with the family , to save trouble . His landlady brought up the supper , however , on this occasion , and he took it from her at the door . When she had descended he set the teapot on the hob , and drew out Sue 's clothes anew ; but they were far from dry . A thick woollen gown , he found , held a deal of water . So he hung them up again , and enlarged his fire and mused as the steam from the garments went up the chimney . Suddenly she said , "
59843	59844	59841	59841	Jude	180	" "
59856	59857	59852	59852	you	180	" "
59882	59883	59871	59871	I	0	" "
59889	59890	59871	59871	I	0	" "
59900	59907	59897	59897	I	0	" she said , starting up . "
59913	59914	59897	59897	I	0	" "
59941	59942	59938	59938	you	180	" "
60008	60020	60021	60021	I	0	" When she had sat upright she breathed plaintively and said , "
60045	60111	60112	60112	You	1590	" But the supper fortified her somewhat , and when she had had some tea and had lain back again she was bright and cheerful . The tea must have been green , or too long drawn , for she seemed preternaturally wakeful afterwards , though Jude , who had not taken any , began to feel heavy ; till her conversation fixed his attention . "
60127	60135	60112	60112	You	1590	" she said , breaking a silence . "
60146	60147	60140	60140	you	1590	" "
60150	60151	60140	60140	you	1590	" "
60169	60170	60160	60160	I	0	" "

60197	60207	60190	60190	I	0	" she asked , with a touch of raillery . "

60333	60334	60335	60335	You	1590	" "
60342	60349	60335	60335	You	1590	" he said with a sigh . "
60361	60362	60352	60352	you	1590	" "
60365	60370	60352	60352	you	1590	" she said thoughtfully , "

60889	60905	60883	60883	you	0	" she said , a contralto note of tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice . "
60917	60918	60921	60921	I	0	" "
60929	60930	60933	60933	I	0	" "
61023	61057	61012	61012	I	0	" Jude looked round upon the arm - chair and its occupant , as if to read more carefully the creature he had given shelter to . His voice trembled as he said : "
61076	61077	61078	61078	I	0	" "
61107	61127	61090	61090	I	0	" said she , with an ostensible sneer , though he could hear that she was brimming with tears . "

61286	61312	61262	61262	He	163	" Jude felt much depressed ; she seemed to get further and further away from him with her strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender . "
61324	61355	61315	61315	you	0	" she suddenly asked , in a voice of such extraordinary tenderness that it hardly seemed to come from the same woman who had just told her story so lightly . "

61429	61468	61469	61469	I	0	" There was another long silence . He felt that she was treating him cruelly , though he could not quite say in what way . Her very helplessness seemed to make her so much stronger than he . "
61484	61493	61478	61478	I	0	" he said , to turn the subject . "
61537	61538	61532	61532	you	0	" "

61848	61865	61841	61841	I	0	" The emotional throat - note had come back , and she turned her face away . "
61887	61903	61881	61881	I	0	" He spoke gently , and resisted his impulse to pique her on to tears . "
61923	61935	61936	61936	THEY	1647	" she said , perverse still at his differing from her . "

62096	62144	62079	62080	Mr. Phillotson	163	" He noticed that whenever he tried to speak of the schoolmaster she turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending university . Jude was extremely , morbidly , curious about her life as Phillotson 's protegee and betrothed ; yet she would not enlighten him . "
62156	62160	62151	62151	I	0	" he said . "
62172	62173	62161	62161	I	0	" "
62181	62195	62175	62175	you	0	" she murmured . His heart bumped , and he made no reply . "
62209	62227	62206	62206	you	0	" she added , putting on flippancy to hide real feeling , a common trick with her . "
62244	62245	62206	62206	you	0	" "
62327	62328	62321	62321	you	174	" "

62368	62424	62425	62425	Jude	180	" she replied , in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever after , turning her back upon him accordingly . A small Bible other than the one he was using lay near her , and during his retreat she took it up , and turned over the leaves . "
62427	62442	62425	62425	Jude	180	" she said brightly , when he had finished and come back to her ; "
62464	62465	62457	62457	I	0	" "
62474	62475	62476	62476	I	0	" "

62573	62583	62550	62550	I	0	" said Jude , with a sense of sacrilege . "
62592	62607	62608	62608	I	0	" she said , as she glanced into the pages of Solomon 's Song . "
62686	62691	62692	62692	You	0	" Jude looked pained . "
62697	62701	62692	62692	You	0	" he murmured . "
62754	62773	62774	62774	I	0	" Her speech had grown spirited , and almost petulant at his rebuke , and her eyes moist . "
62793	62794	62786	62786	nobody	4069	" "
62811	62830	62832	62832	you	0	" he said , taking her hand , and surprised at her introducing personal feeling into mere argument . "
62839	62856	62832	62832	you	0	" she cried , turning away her face that he might not see her brimming eyes . "
62923	62924	62932	62932	You	0	" "
62969	62970	62957	62957	YOU	0	" "
62980	63040	62972	62972	you	0	" Sue replied , her voice changing to its softest note of severity . Then their eyes met , and they shook hands like cronies in a tavern , and Jude saw the absurdity of quarrelling on such a hypothetical subject , and she the silliness of crying about what was written in an old book like the Bible . "
63053	63069	63048	63048	I	0	" she went on soothingly , for now he was rather more ruffled than she . "
63131	63132	63123	63123	I	0	" "
63168	63169	63164	63164	I	0	" "
63179	63180	63182	63182	I	0	" "
63191	63197	63186	63186	I	0	" He thought of Arabella . "
63231	63248	63249	63249	I	0	" She looked up trustfully , and her voice seemed trying to nestle in his breast . "
63256	63260	63262	63262	I	0	" said Jude . "
63283	63542	63281	63281	Sue	174	" He looked away , for that epicene tenderness of hers was too harrowing . Was it that which had broken the heart of the poor leader - writer ; and was he to be the next one ? ... But Sue was so dear ! ... If he could only get over the sense of her sex , as she seemed to be able to do so easily of his , what a comrade she would make ; for their difference of opinion on conjectural subjects only drew them closer together on matters of daily human experience . She was nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met , and he could scarcely believe that time , creed , or absence , would ever divide him from her . But his grief at her incredulities returned . They sat on till she fell asleep again , and he nodded in his chair likewise . Whenever he aroused himself he turned her things , and made up the fire anew . About six o'clock he awoke completely , and lighting a candle , found that her clothes were dry . Her chair being a far more comfortable one than his she still slept on inside his great - coat , looking warm as a new bun and boyish as a Ganymede . Placing the garments by her and touching her on the shoulder he went downstairs , and washed himself by starlight in the yard . V When he returned she was dressed as usual . "
63553	63557	63549	63549	anybody	4107	" she asked . "
63565	63566	63549	63549	anybody	4107	" "
63574	63575	63568	63568	you	0	" "
63667	63668	63658	63658	he	163	" "
63677	63681	63669	63669	I	0	" began Jude . "
63711	63712	63714	63714	you	0	" "
63720	63721	63714	63714	you	0	" "
63807	63851	63797	63797	I	0	" At the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of coffee , in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising to go to his work every day before the household was astir . "
63862	63866	63797	63797	I	0	" he said ; "
63883	63981	63982	63982	I	0	" They went quietly out of the house , Jude accompanying her to the station . As they departed along the street a head was thrust out of an upper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn . Sue still seemed sorry for her rashness , and to wish she had not rebelled ; telling him at parting that she would let him know as soon as she got re - admitted to the training - school . They stood rather miserably together on the platform ; and it was apparent that he wanted to say more . "
63992	64002	63982	63982	I	0	" he said hurriedly as the train came up . "
64015	64016	64017	64017	Jude	180	" "
64019	64023	64017	64017	Jude	180	" she said . "
64035	64036	64031	64031	you	180	" "
64039	64040	64041	64041	You	1704	" "
64057	64610	64047	64047	You	1704	" Jude 's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage window . And then the train moved on , and waving her pretty hand to him she vanished away . Melchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her departure , and the Close so hateful that he did not go once to the cathedral services . The next morning there came a letter from her , which , with her usual promptitude , she had written directly she had reached her friend 's house . She told him of her safe arrival and comfortable quarters , and then added : - What I really write about , dear Jude , is something I said to you at parting . You had been so very good and kind to me that when you were out of sight I felt what a cruel and ungrateful woman I was to say it , and it has reproached me ever since . IF YOU WANT TO LOVE ME , JUDE , YOU MAY : I do n't mind at all ; and I 'll never say again that you must n't ! Now I wo n't write any more about that . You do forgive your thoughtless friend for her cruelty ? and wo n't make her miserable by saying you do n't ? - Ever , SUE . It would be superfluous to say what his answer was ; and how he thought what he would have done had he been free , which should have rendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for Sue . He felt he might have been pretty sure of his own victory if it had come to a conflict between Phillotson and himself for the possession of her . Yet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue 's impulsive note than it really was intended to bear . After the lapse of a few days he found himself hoping that she would write again . But he received no further communication ; and in the intensity of his solicitude he sent another note , suggesting that he should pay her a visit some Sunday , the distance being under eighteen miles . He expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his missive ; but none came . The third morning arrived ; the postman did not stop . This was Saturday , and in a feverish state of anxiety about her he sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming the following day , for he felt sure something had happened . His first and natural thought had been that she was ill from her immersion ; but it soon occurred to him that somebody would have written for her in such a case . Conjectures were put an end to by his arrival at the village school - house near Shaston on the bright morning of Sunday , between eleven and twelve o'clock , when the parish was as vacant as a desert , most of the inhabitants having gathered inside the church , whence their voices could occasionally be heard in unison . A little girl opened the door . "
64618	64622	64611	64612	Miss Bridehead	251	" she said . "
64632	64633	64625	64625	you	1707	" "
64638	64643	64625	64625	you	1707	" asked Jude hastily . "
64651	64699	64625	64625	you	1707	" Jude entered and ascended . On reaching the landing a voice told him which way to turn - the voice of Sue calling his name . He passed the doorway , and found her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet square . "
64704	64717	64702	64702	Sue	174	" he cried , sitting down beside her and taking her hand . "
64727	64728	64722	64722	You	174	" "
64736	64740	64741	64741	I	0	" she answered . "
64759	64760	64755	64755	I	0	" "
64770	64771	64755	64755	I	0	" "
64820	64821	64794	64794	They	1709	" "
64824	64825	64794	64794	They	1709	" "
64844	64845	64835	64835	they	1709	" "
64848	64855	64835	64835	they	1709	" She did not answer directly . "
64873	64874	64864	64864	Jude	180	" "
64880	64881	64864	64864	Jude	180	" "
64884	64885	64864	64864	Jude	180	" "

64948	64949	64937	64937	I	0	" "
65085	65105	65106	65106	I	0	" The speech seemed a little forced and unreal , and they regarded each other with a mutual distress . "
65113	65118	65106	65106	I	0	" she went on . "
65186	65187	65190	65190	Sue	174	" "
65192	65197	65190	65190	Sue	174	" he said simply ; "
65286	65438	65261	65261	you	174	" She turned her eyes doubtfully towards him , and then looked away as if afraid she might forgive him . By every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that fitted the mood and the moment , under the suasion of which Sue 's undemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed its temperature . Some men would have cast scruples to the winds , and ventured it , oblivious both of Sue 's declaration of her neutral feelings , and of the pair of autographs in the vestry chest of Arabella 's parish church . Jude did not . He had , in fact , come in part to tell his own fatal story . It was upon his lips ; yet at the hour of this distress he could not disclose it . He preferred to dwell upon the recognized barriers between them . "
65456	65460	65461	65461	You	1720	" he sorrowed . "
65486	65487	65479	65479	he	163	" "
65490	65501	65479	65479	he	163	" she said shortly , her face changing a little . "
65536	65575	65524	65524	I	0	" It was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his honest acquiescence in his rival , if Jude 's feelings of love were deprecated by her . He went on to something else . "
65584	65588	65581	65582	dear Sue	174	" he said . "
65614	65615	65616	65616	I	0	" "
65622	66580	65616	65616	I	0	" she said decisively . Sue 's kind hostess now returned from church , and there was no more intimate conversation . Jude left in the afternoon , hopelessly unhappy . But he had seen her , and sat with her . Such intercourse as that would have to content him for the remainder of his life . The lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper that he , as a parish priest , should learn . But the next morning when he awoke he felt rather vexed with her , and decided that she was rather unreasonable , not to say capricious . Then , in illustration of what he had begun to discern as one of her redeeming characteristics there came promptly a note , which she must have written almost immediately he had gone from her : Forgive me for my petulance yesterday ! I was horrid to you ; I know it , and I feel perfectly miserable at my horridness . It was so dear of you not to be angry ! Jude , please still keep me as your friend and associate , with all my faults . I 'll try not to be like it again . I am coming to Melchester on Saturday , to get my things away from the T. S. , c. I could walk with you for half an hour , if you would like ? - Your repentant SUE . Jude forgave her straightway , and asked her to call for him at the cathedral works when she came . VI Meanwhile a middle - aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty concerning the writer of the above letter . He was Richard Phillotson , who had recently removed from the mixed village school at Lumsdon near Christminster , to undertake a large boys ' school in his native town of Shaston , which stood on a hill sixty miles to the south - west as the crow flies . A glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal that the schoolmaster 's plans and dreams so long indulged in had been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor literature had much in common . Essentially an unpractical man , he was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose - that of keeping a wife , who , if she chose , might conduct one of the girls ' schools adjoining his own ; for which purpose he had advised her to go into training , since she would not marry him offhand . About the time that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester , and entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue , the schoolmaster was settling down in the new school - house at Shaston . All the furniture being fixed , the books shelved , and the nails driven , he had begun to sit in his parlour during the dark winter nights and re - attempt some of his old studies - one branch of which had included Roman - Britannic antiquities - an unremunerative labour for a national school - master but a subject , that , after his abandonment of the university scheme , had interested him as being a comparatively unworked mine ; practicable to those who , like himself , had lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant , and were seen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on the civilization of that time . A resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby of Phillotson at present - his ostensible reason for going alone into fields where causeways , dykes , and tumuli abounded , or shutting himself up in his house with a few urns , tiles , and mosaics he had collected , instead of calling round upon his new neighbours , who for their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with him . But it was not the real , or the whole , reason , after all . Thus on a particular evening in the month , when it had grown quite late - to near midnight , indeed - and the light of his lamp , shining from his window at a salient angle of the hill - top town over infinite miles of valley westward , announced as by words a place and person given over to study , he was not exactly studying . The interior of the room - the books , the furniture , the schoolmaster 's loose coat , his attitude at the table , even the flickering of the fire , bespoke the same dignified tale of undistracted research - more than creditable to a man who had had no advantages beyond those of his own making . And yet the tale , true enough till latterly , was not true now . What he was regarding was not history . They were historic notes , written in a bold womanly hand at his dictation some months before , and it was the clerical rendering of word after word that absorbed him . He presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters , few , very few , as correspondence counts nowadays . Each was in its envelope just as it had arrived , and the handwriting was of the same womanly character as the historic notes . He unfolded them one by one and read them musingly . At first sight there seemed in these small documents to be absolutely nothing to muse over . They were straightforward , frank letters , signed "
66584	67599	65616	65616	I	0	" ; just such ones as would be written during short absences , with no other thought than their speedy destruction , and chiefly concerning books in reading and other experiences of a training school , forgotten doubtless by the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing . In one of them - quite a recent note - the young woman said that she had received his considerate letter , and that it was honourable and generous of him to say he would not come to see her oftener than she desired the school being such an awkward place for callers , and because of her strong wish that her engagement to him should not be known , which it would infallibly be if he visited her often . Over these phrases the school - master pored . What precise shade of satisfaction was to be gathered from a woman 's gratitude that the man who loved her had not been often to see her ? The problem occupied him , distracted him . He opened another drawer , and found therein an envelope , from which he drew a photograph of Sue as a child , long before he had known her , standing under trellis - work with a little basket in her hand . There was another of her as a young woman , her dark eyes and hair making a very distinct and attractive picture of her , which just disclosed , too , the thoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods . It was a duplicate of the one she had given Jude , and would have given to any man . Phillotson brought it half - way to his lips , but withdrew it in doubt at her perplexing phrases : ultimately kissing the dead pasteboard with all the passionateness , and more than all the devotion , of a young man of eighteen . The schoolmaster 's was an unhealthy - looking , old - fashioned face , rendered more old - fashioned by his style of shaving . A certain gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature , suggesting an inherent wish to do rightly by all . His speech was a little slow , but his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect . His greying hair was curly , and radiated from a point in the middle of his crown . There were four lines across his forehead , and he only wore spectacles when reading at night . It was almost certainly a renunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose , rather than a distaste for women , which had hitherto kept him from closing with one of the sex in matrimony . Such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many and oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys , whose quick and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to the self - conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue , making him , in the grey hours of morning , dread to meet anew the gimlet glances , lest they should read what the dream within him was . He had honourably acquiesced in Sue 's announced wish that he was not often to visit her at the training school ; but at length , his patience being sorely tried , he set out one Saturday afternoon to pay her an unexpected call . There the news of her departure - expulsion as it might almost have been considered - was flashed upon him without warning or mitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few minutes to behold her face ; and when he turned away he could hardly see the road before him . Sue had , in fact , never written a line to her suitor on the subject , although it was fourteen days old . A short reflection told him that this proved nothing , a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for silence as any degree of blameworthiness . They had informed him at the school where she was living , and having no immediate anxiety about her comfort his thoughts took the direction of a burning indignation against the training school committee . In his bewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent cathedral , just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of the repairs . He sat down on a block of freestone , regardless of the dusty imprint it made on his breeches ; and his listless eyes following the movements of the workmen he presently became aware that the reputed culprit , Sue 's lover Jude , was one amongst them . Jude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the model of Jerusalem . Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson 's tentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the younger man 's mind a curious dislike to think of the elder , to meet him , to communicate in any way with him ; and since Phillotson 's success in obtaining at least her promise had become known to Jude , he had frankly recognized that he did not wish to see or hear of his senior any more , learn anything of his pursuits , or even imagine again what excellencies might appertain to his character . On this very day of the schoolmaster 's visit Jude was expecting Sue , as she had promised ; and when therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave of the building , saw , moreover , that he was coming to speak to him , he felt no little embarrassment ; which Phillotson 's own embarrassment prevented his observing . Jude joined him , and they both withdrew from the other workmen to the spot where Phillotson had been sitting . Jude offered him a piece of sackcloth for a cushion , and told him it was dangerous to sit on the bare block . "
67604	67631	65616	65616	I	0	" said Phillotson abstractedly , as he reseated himself , his eyes resting on the ground as if he were trying to remember where he was . "
67677	67678	67679	67679	I	0	" "
67685	67690	67679	67679	I	0	" Jude hurriedly said . "
67705	67706	67679	67679	I	0	" "
67709	67710	67679	67679	I	0	" "
67712	67805	67806	67806	I	0	" - Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to annihilate his rival at all cost . By the exercise of that treachery which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most honourable in every other relation of life , he could send off Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true , and that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him . But his action did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct ; and what he said was , "
67836	67837	67825	67825	they	1726	" "
67840	67841	67825	67825	they	1726	" "
67852	67869	67843	67843	I	0	" Phillotson trembled , and his naturally pale face acquired a corpselike sharpness in its lines . "
67884	67885	67901	67901	I	0	" "
67890	67895	67901	67901	I	0	" said Jude aghast . "
67934	67947	67929	67929	I	0	" What he had really meant was simply that he loved her . "
67963	67990	68079	68079	your	0	" asked Phillotson , with the firmness of a man who felt that a sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter . "
68017	68063	68079	68079	your	0	" Jude explained readily ; giving the whole series of adventures , including the night at the shepherd 's , her wet arrival at his lodging , her indisposition from her immersion , their vigil of discussion , and his seeing her off next morning . "
68067	68074	68079	68079	your	0	" said Phillotson at the conclusion , "
68105	68106	68086	68086	I	0	" "
68110	68115	68086	68086	I	0	" said Jude solemnly . "
68123	68263	68121	68121	God	177	" The schoolmaster rose . Each of the twain felt that the interview could not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent experiences , after the manner of friends ; and when Jude had taken him round , and shown him some features of the renovation which the old cathedral was undergoing , Phillotson bade the young man good - day and went away . This visit took place about eleven o'clock in the morning ; but no Sue appeared . When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved ahead of him in the street leading up from the North Gate , walking as if no way looking for him . Speedily overtaking her he remarked that he had asked her to come to him at the cathedral , and she had promised . "
68275	68317	68264	68264	I	0	" she said - an observation which he was expected to take as an answer , though it was not one . Finding her to be in this evasive mood he felt inclined to give her the information so long withheld . "
68328	68334	68335	68335	I	0	" he ventured to inquire . "
68363	68364	68358	68358	I	0	" "
68371	68378	68358	68358	I	0	" He stopped , regarding her . "
68381	68382	68358	68358	I	0	" "
68401	68402	68384	68384	you	0	" "
68411	68420	68384	68384	you	0	" said she , smiling with quick curiosity . "
68449	68493	68443	68443	I	0	" As she knew his sentiment towards her Jude saw that they were getting upon dangerous ground . It was now , he thought , that he must speak as an honest man . But he did not speak , and she continued : "
68519	68550	68551	68551	I	0	" The exultation he might have felt at what that implied , or seemed to imply , was nullified by his intention , and he rested rigid till he began : "
68557	68558	68551	68551	I	0	" "
68563	68567	68560	68560	you	0	" murmured she . "
68583	68584	68571	68571	I	0	" "
68594	68636	68637	68637	I	0	" Jude looked up . Could she possibly know of that morning performance of his with Arabella ; which in a few months had ceased to be a marriage more completely than by death ? He saw that she did not . "
68648	68657	68637	68637	I	0	" he went on with a gloomy tongue . "
68674	68818	68822	68822	you	1734	" The building by which they stood was the market - house ; it was the only place available ; and they entered , the market being over , and the stalls and areas empty . He would have preferred a more congenial spot , but , as usually happens , in place of a romantic field or solemn aisle for his tale , it was told while they walked up and down over a floor littered with rotten cabbage - leaves , and amid all the usual squalors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse . He began and finished his brief narrative , which merely led up to the information that he had married a wife some years earlier , and that his wife was living still . Almost before her countenance had time to change she hurried out the words , "
68827	68828	68822	68822	you	1734	" "
68841	68842	68844	68844	yourself	1734	" "
68858	68859	68822	68822	you	1734	" "
68865	68930	68822	68822	you	1734	" cried Jude passionately . He tried to take her hand , but she withdrew it . Their old relations of confidence seemed suddenly to have ended , and the antagonisms of sex to sex were left without any counter - poising predilections . She was his comrade , friend , unconscious sweetheart no longer ; and her eyes regarded him in estranged silence . "
68946	68950	68951	68951	I	0	" he continued . "
68971	68972	68965	68965	you	1735	" "
68978	68983	68976	68976	I	0	" she burst out . "
69028	69040	69041	69041	You	0	" she said , stamping her foot in a nervous quiver . "
69098	69114	69086	69086	I	0	" It was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to answer . "
69135	69140	69131	69131	she	1736	" she asked quickly . "
69152	69153	69141	69141	She	1736	" "
69162	69163	69141	69141	She	1736	" "
69192	69193	69188	69188	they	1739	" "
69206	69220	69221	69221	You	0	" said Sue , her trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony . "
69293	69294	69295	69295	Sue	174	" "
69320	69352	69312	69312	you	0	" When she saw how wretched he was she softened , and trying to blink away her sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness of a heart - hurt woman : "
69391	69419	69376	69376	I	0	" For once Sue was as miserable as he , in her attempts to keep herself free from emotion , and her less than half - success . "
69426	69430	69376	69376	I	0	" he implored . "
69454	69489	69448	69448	your	795	" They were quite screened from the market - square without , and he could not help putting out his arm towards her waist . His momentary desire was the means of her rallying . "
69494	69507	69448	69448	your	795	" she said , drawing back stringently , and wiping her eyes . "
69538	69603	69604	69604	I	0	" They moved on a dozen paces , and she showed herself recovered . It was distracting to Jude , and his heart would have ached less had she appeared anyhow but as she did appear ; essentially large - minded and generous on reflection , despite a previous exercise of those narrow womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex . "
69616	69622	69604	69604	I	0	" she said , smiling . "
69674	69675	69682	69682	Sue	174	" "
69690	69691	69692	69692	You	1749	" "
69716	69731	69695	69695	I	0	" said Sue , with a gentle seriousness which did not reveal her mind . "
69854	69915	69851	69852	Venus Urania	248	" Her being able to talk learnedly showed that she was mistress of herself again ; and before they parted she had almost regained her vivacious glance , her reciprocity of tone , her gay manner , and her second - thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her age and sex . He could speak more freely now . "
69965	69966	69984	69984	She	1761	" "
69977	69978	69984	69984	She	1761	" "
69994	69995	69984	69984	She	1761	" "
70010	70053	70000	70001	My father	3941	" They stood possessed by the same thought , ugly enough , even as an assumption : that a union between them , had such been possible , would have meant a terrible intensification of unfitness - two bitters in one dish . "
70065	70072	70000	70001	My father	3941	" she said with nervous lightness . "
70089	70470	70000	70001	My father	3941	" And then they pretended to persuade themselves that all that had happened was of no consequence , and that they could still be cousins and friends and warm correspondents , and have happy genial times when they met , even if they met less frequently than before . Their parting was in good friendship , and yet Jude 's last look into her eyes was tinged with inquiry , for he felt that he did not even now quite know her mind . VII Tidings from Sue a day or two after passed across Jude like a withering blast . Before reading the letter he was led to suspect that its contents were of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the signature - which was in her full name , never used in her correspondence with him since her first note : MY DEAR JUDE , - I have something to tell you which perhaps you will not be surprised to hear , though certainly it may strike you as being accelerated as the railway companies say of their trains . Mr. Phillotson and I are to be married quite soon - in three or four weeks . We had intended , as you know , to wait till I had gone through my course of training and obtained my certificate , so as to assist him , if necessary , in the teaching . But he generously says he does not see any object in waiting , now I am not at the training school . It is so good of him , because the awkwardness of my situation has really come about by my fault in getting expelled . Wish me joy . Remember I say you are to , and you must n't refuse ! - Your affectionate cousin , SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD . Jude staggered under the news ; could eat no breakfast ; and kept on drinking tea because his mouth was so dry . Then presently he went back to his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted . Everything seemed turning to satire . And yet , what could the poor girl do ? he asked himself : and felt worse than shedding tears . "
70476	70483	70472	70474	Susanna Florence Mary	174	" he said as he worked . "
70492	71000	70472	70474	Susanna Florence Mary	174	" Could it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had pricked her on to this , just as his visit to her when in liquor may have pricked her on to her engagement ? To be sure , there seemed to exist these other and sufficient reasons , practical and social , for her decision ; but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person ; and he was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret sprung upon her had moved her to give way to Phillotson 's probable representations , that the best course to prove how unfounded were the suspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him off - hand , as in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement . Sue had , in fact , been placed in an awkward corner . Poor Sue ! He determined to play the Spartan ; to make the best of it , and support her ; but he could not write the requested good wishes for a day or two . Meanwhile there came another note from his impatient little dear : Jude , will you give me away ? I have nobody else who could do it so conveniently as you , being the only married relation I have here on the spot , even if my father were friendly enough to be willing , which he is n't . I hope you wo n't think it a trouble ? I have been looking at the marriage service in the prayer - book , and it seems to me very humiliating that a giver - away should be required at all . According to the ceremony as there printed , my bridegroom chooses me of his own will and pleasure ; but I do n't choose him . Somebody GIVES me to him , like a she - ass or she - goat , or any other domestic animal . Bless your exalted views of woman , O churchman ! But I forget : I am no longer privileged to tease you . - Ever , SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD . Jude screwed himself up to heroic key ; and replied : MY DEAR SUE , - Of course I wish you joy ! And also of course I will give you away . What I suggest is that , as you have no house of your own , you do not marry from your school friend 's , but from mine . It would be more proper , I think , since I am , as you say , the person nearest related to you in this part of the world . I do n't see why you sign your letter in such a new and terribly formal way ? Surely you care a bit about me still ! - Ever your affectionate , JUDE . What had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little sting he had been silent on - the phrase "
71003	71412	70472	70474	Susanna Florence Mary	174	" - What an idiot it made him seem as her lover ! If Sue had written that in satire , he could hardly forgive her ; if in suffering - ah , that was another thing ! His offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson at any rate , for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks , accepting the convenience . Sue also thanked him . Jude immediately moved into more commodious quarters , as much to escape the espionage of the suspicious landlady who had been one cause of Sue 's unpleasant experience as for the sake of room . Then Sue wrote to tell him the day fixed for the wedding ; and Jude decided , after inquiry , that she should come into residence on the following Saturday , which would allow of a ten days ' stay in the city prior to the ceremony , sufficiently representing a nominal residence of fifteen . She arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid , Jude not going to meet her at the station , by her special request , that he should not lose a morning 's work and pay , she said if this were her true reason . But so well by this time did he know Sue that the remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might , he thought , have weighed with her in this . When he came home to dinner she had taken possession of her apartment . She lived in the same house with him , but on a different floor , and they saw each other little , an occasional supper being the only meal they took together , when Sue 's manner was something like that of a scared child . What she felt he did not know ; their conversation was mechanical , though she did not look pale or ill . Phillotson came frequently , but mostly when Jude was absent . On the morning of the wedding , when Jude had given himself a holiday , Sue and her cousin had breakfast together for the first and last time during this curious interval ; in his room - the parlour - which he had hired for the period of Sue 's residence . Seeing , as women do , how helpless he was in making the place comfortable , she bustled about . "
71420	71455	71418	71418	Jude	180	" she said suddenly . He was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his hands , looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the tablecloth . "
71460	71461	71418	71418	Jude	180	" "
71483	71488	71476	71481	the man who gives you away	1768	" Jude could have said "
71499	71606	71607	71607	You	1769	" But he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort . She talked incessantly , as if she dreaded his indulgence in reflection , and before the meal was over both he and she wished they had not put such confidence in their new view of things , and had taken breakfast apart . What oppressed Jude was the thought that , having done a wrong thing of this sort himself , he was aiding and abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing , instead of imploring and warning her against it . It was on his tongue to say , "
71615	71716	71612	71612	your	1769	" After breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging in unceremonious companionship . By the irony of fate , and the curious trick in Sue 's nature of tempting Providence at critical times , she took his arm as they walked through the muddy street - a thing she had never done before in her life - and on turning the corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church with a low - pitched roof - the church of St. Thomas . "
71722	71726	71612	71612	your	1769	" said Jude . "
71735	71736	71612	71612	your	1769	" "
71739	71740	71612	71612	your	1769	" "
71743	71749	71612	71612	your	1769	" she exclaimed with curiosity . "
71775	71782	71783	71783	She	0	" Again he said to himself , "
71791	71947	71783	71783	She	0	" He passively acquiesced in her wish to go in , and they entered by the western door . The only person inside the gloomy building was a charwoman cleaning . Sue still held Jude 's arm , almost as if she loved him . Cruelly sweet , indeed , she had been to him that morning ; but his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an ache : ... I can find no way How a blow should fall , such as falls on men , Nor prove too much for your womanhood ! They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar railing , which they stood against in silence , turning then and walking down the nave again , her hand still on his arm , precisely like a couple just married . The too suggestive incident , entirely of her making , nearly broke down Jude . "
71956	71979	71948	71948	I	0	" she said in the delicate voice of an epicure in emotions , which left no doubt that she spoke the truth . "
71985	71989	71982	71982	you	0	" said Jude . "
72023	72024	72027	72027	you	0	" "
72030	72031	72027	72027	you	0	" "
72041	72042	72043	72044	Good God	177	" "
72067	72068	72061	72061	I	0	" "
72075	72090	72061	72061	I	0	" she said regretfully , as she blinked away an access of eye moisture . "
72154	72177	72145	72145	You	0	" The appeal was so remorseful that Jude 's eyes were even wetter than hers as he pressed her hand for Yes . "
72193	72273	72185	72185	I	0	" she continued humbly ; and they came out of the building , Sue intending to go on to the station to meet Phillotson . But the first person they encountered on entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself , whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected . There was nothing really to demur to in her leaning on Jude 's arm ; but she withdrew her hand , and Jude thought that Phillotson had looked surprised . "
72283	72290	72274	72274	We	1776	" said she , smiling candidly . "
72309	72310	72307	72307	Jude	180	" "
72313	72370	72371	72371	I	0	" said Phillotson curiously . Jude inwardly deplored what he thought to be unnecessary frankness ; but she had gone too far not to explain all , which she accordingly did , telling him how they had marched up to the altar . Seeing how puzzled Phillotson seemed , Jude said as cheerfully as he could , "
72391	72392	72382	72382	you	1779	" "
72395	72399	72382	72382	you	1779	" said Sue , "
72409	72643	72400	72400	I	0	" ; and requesting her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster . Jude soon joined them at his rooms , and shortly after they prepared for the ceremony . Phillotson 's hair was brushed to a painful extent , and his shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for the previous twenty years . Beyond this he looked dignified and thoughtful , and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict that he would make a kind and considerate husband . That he adored Sue was obvious ; and she could almost be seen to feel that she was undeserving his adoration . Although the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red Lion , and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door when they came out . The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown , though Jude was getting to be recognized as a citizen ; and the couple were judged to be some relations of his from a distance , nobody supposing Sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school . In the carriage Jude took from his pocket his extra little wedding - present , which turned out to be two or three yards of white tulle , which he threw over her bonnet and all , as a veil . "
72652	72656	72400	72400	I	0	" she said . "
72664	72665	72657	72657	I	0	" "
72673	73113	72657	72657	I	0	" said Phillotson . And she obeyed . When they had passed up the church and were standing in their places Jude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge of this performance , but by the time they were half - way on with the service he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the business of giving her away . How could Sue have had the temerity to ask him to do it - a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him ? Women were different from men in such matters . Was it that they were , instead of more sensitive , as reputed , more callous , and less romantic ; or were they more heroic ? Or was Sue simply so perverse that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful luxury of practising long - suffering in her own person , and of being touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it ? He could perceive that her face was nervously set , and when they reached the trying ordeal of Jude giving her to Phillotson she could hardly command herself ; rather , however , as it seemed , from her knowledge of what her cousin must feel , whom she need not have had there at all , than from self - consideration . Possibly she would go on inflicting such pains again and again , and grieving for the sufferer again and again , in all her colossal inconsistency . Phillotson seemed not to notice , to be surrounded by a mist which prevented his seeing the emotions of others . As soon as they had signed their names and come away , and the suspense was over , Jude felt relieved . The meal at his lodging was a very simple affair , and at two o'clock they went off . In crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back ; and there was a frightened light in her eyes . Could it be that Sue had acted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she knew not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him , of retaliating on him for his secrecy ? Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome with men because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their natures which wore out women 's hearts and lives . When her foot was on the carriage - step she turned round , saying that she had forgotten something . Jude and the landlady offered to get it . "
73116	73123	72657	72657	I	0	" she said , running back . "
73136	73355	73129	73129	I	0	" Jude followed her back . She had found it , and came holding it in her hand . She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones , and her lips suddenly parted as if she were going to avow something . But she went on ; and whatever she had meant to say remained unspoken . VIII Jude wondered if she had really left her handkerchief behind ; or whether it were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love that at the last moment she could not bring herself to express . He could not stay in his silent lodging when they were gone , and fearing that he might be tempted to drown his misery in alcohol he went upstairs , changed his dark clothes for his white , his thin boots for his thick , and proceeded to his customary work for the afternoon . But in the cathedral he seemed to hear a voice behind him , and to be possessed with an idea that she would come back . She could not possibly go home with Phillotson , he fancied . The feeling grew and stirred . The moment that the clock struck the last of his working hours he threw down his tools and rushed homeward . "
73362	73705	73357	73357	anybody	4107	" he asked . Nobody had been there . As he could claim the downstairs sitting - room till twelve o'clock that night he sat in it all the evening ; and even when the clock had struck eleven , and the family had retired , he could not shake off the feeling that she would come back and sleep in the little room adjoining his own in which she had slept so many previous days . Her actions were always unpredictable : why should she not come ? Gladly would he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and wife by having her live thus as a fellow - lodger and friend , even on the most distant terms . His supper still remained spread , and going to the front door , and softly setting it open , he returned to the room and sat as watchers sit on Old - Midsummer eves , expecting the phantom of the Beloved . But she did not come . Having indulged in this wild hope he went upstairs , and looked out of the window , and pictured her through the evening journey to London , whither she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday ; their rattling along through the damp night to their hotel , under the same sky of ribbed cloud as that he beheld , through which the moon showed its position rather than its shape , and one or two of the larger stars made themselves visible as faint nebulae only . It was a new beginning of Sue 's history . He projected his mind into the future , and saw her with children more or less in her own likeness around her . But the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of her identity was denied to him , as to all such dreamers , by the wilfulness of Nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone . Every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy . "
73735	74222	73357	73357	anybody	4107	" said Jude . And then he again uneasily saw , as he had latterly seen with more and more frequency , the scorn of Nature for man 's finer emotions , and her lack of interest in his aspirations . The oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on the morrow and following days yet more clearly . He could no longer endure the light of the Melchester lamps ; the sunshine was as drab paint , and the blue sky as zinc . Then he received news that his old aunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen , which intelligence almost coincided with a letter from his former employer at Christminster , who offered him permanent work of a good class if he would come back . The letters were almost a relief to him . He started to visit Aunt Drusilla , and resolved to go onward to Christminster to see what worth there might be in the builder 's offer . Jude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow Edlin had led him to expect . There was every possibility of her lingering on for weeks or months , though little likelihood . He wrote to Sue informing her of the state of her aunt , and suggesting that she might like to see her aged relative alive . He would meet her at Alfredston Road , the following evening , Monday , on his way back from Christminster , if she could come by the up - train which crossed his down - train at that station . Next morning , according , he went on to Christminster , intending to return to Alfredston soon enough to keep the suggested appointment with Sue . The city of learning wore an estranged look , and he had lost all feeling for its associations . Yet as the sun made vivid lights and shades of the mullioned architecture of the facades , and drew patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the quadrangles , Jude thought he had never seen the place look more beautiful . He came to the street in which he had first beheld Sue . The chair she had occupied when , leaning over her ecclesiastical scrolls , a hog - hair brush in her hand , her girlish figure had arrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes , stood precisely in its former spot , empty . It was as if she were dead , and nobody had been found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit . Hers was now the city phantom , while those of the intellectual and devotional worthies who had once moved him to emotion were no longer able to assert their presence there . However , here he was ; and in fulfilment of his intention he went on to his former lodging in "
74225	74982	73357	73357	anybody	4107	" near the ritualistic church of St. Silas . The old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see him again , and bringing some lunch informed him that the builder who had employed him had called to inquire his address . Jude went on to the stone - yard where he had worked . But the old sheds and bankers were distasteful to him ; he felt it impossible to engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams . He longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston , where he might probably meet Sue . Then , for one ghastly half - hour of depression caused by these scenes , there returned upon him that feeling which had been his undoing more than once - that he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of either by himself or others ; and during this half - hour he met Tinker Taylor , the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger , at Fourways , who proposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together . They walked along the street till they stood before one of the great palpitating centres of Christminster life , the inn wherein he formerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in Latin - now a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance , which gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and refitted in modern style since Jude 's residence here . Tinker Taylor drank off his glass and departed , saying it was too stylish a place now for him to feel at home in unless he was drunker than he had money to be just then . Jude was longer finishing his , and stood abstractedly silent in the , for the minute , almost empty place . The bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout , mahogany fixtures having taken the place of the old painted ones , while at the back of the standing - space there were stuffed sofa - benches . The room was divided into compartments in the approved manner , between which were screens of ground glass in mahogany framing , to prevent topers in one compartment being put to the blush by the recognitions of those in the next . On the inside of the counter two barmaids leant over the white - handled beer - engines , and the row of little silvered taps inside , dripping into a pewter trough . Feeling tired , and having nothing more to do till the train left , Jude sat down on one of the sofas . At the back of the barmaids rose bevel - edged mirrors , with glass shelves running along their front , on which stood precious liquids that Jude did not know the name of , in bottles of topaz , sapphire , ruby and amethyst . The moment was enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next compartment , and the starting of the mechanical tell - tale of monies received , which emitted a ting - ting every time a coin was put in . The barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude 's direct glance , though a reflection of her back in the glass behind her was occasionally caught by his eyes . He had only observed this listlessly , when she turned her face for a moment to the glass to set her hair tidy . Then he was amazed to discover that the face was Arabella 's . If she had come on to his compartment she would have seen him . But she did not , this being presided over by the maiden on the other side . Abby was in a black gown , with white linen cuffs and a broad white collar , and her figure , more developed than formerly , was accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom . In the compartment she served stood an electro - plated fountain of water over a spirit - lamp , whose blue flame sent a steam from the top , all this being visible to him only in the mirror behind her ; which also reflected the faces of the men she was attending to - one of them a handsome , dissipated young fellow , possibly an undergraduate , who had been relating to her an experience of some humorous sort . "
75003	75008	74992	74992	you	310	" she cried gaily . "
75024	75041	75014	75014	you	310	" As the young man was clean shaven the retort provoked a laugh at his expense . "
75044	75048	75014	75014	you	310	" said he , "
75061	75088	75014	75014	you	310	" She served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and striking a match held it to his cigarette with ministering archness while he whiffed . "
75102	75106	75095	75096	your husband	1785	" he asked . "
75111	75115	75095	75096	your husband	1785	" said she . "
75120	75121	75118	75118	he	1785	" "
75136	75143	75131	75131	he	1785	" Jude 's eyes grew rounder . "
75151	75152	75131	75131	he	1785	" "
75166	75167	75160	75160	you	0	" "
75204	75359	75192	75192	I	0	" She handed the change over the counter , in taking which he caught her fingers and held them . There was a slight struggle and titter , and he bade her good - bye and left . Jude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher . It was extraordinary how far removed from his life Arabella now seemed to be . He could not realize their nominal closeness . And , this being the case , in his present frame of mind he was indifferent to the fact that Arabella was his wife indeed . The compartment that she served emptied itself of visitors , and after a brief thought he entered it , and went forward to the counter . Arabella did not recognize him for a moment . Then their glances met . She started ; till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes , and she spoke . "

75438	75445	75436	75436	Arabella	305	" said Jude without a smile . "
75458	75494	75447	75447	I	0	" The fact was that her unexpected presence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for strong liquor as completely as if it had whisked him back to his milk - fed infancy . "

75672	75755	75668	75668	you	0	" She idly allowed her fingers to rest on the pull of the beer - engine as she inspected him critically . He observed that her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with her , and that on the hand which pulled the engine she wore an ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires - which they were , indeed , and were much admired as such by the young men who frequented the bar . "
75765	75769	75668	75668	you	0	" he continued . "

75845	75850	75836	75836	I	0	" she replied evasively . "
75869	75906	75864	75864	I	0	" Here a chappie with no chin , and a moustache like a lady 's eyebrow , came and asked for a curiously compounded drink , and Arabella was obliged to go and attend to him . "
75913	75922	75907	75907	We	1800	" she said , stepping back a moment . "
75965	75972	75973	75973	I	0	" He reflected and said gloomily , "
75986	75987	75978	75978	I	0	" "
76001	76002	75993	75993	I	0	" "
76033	76402	76027	76027	I	0	" Depositing his unemptied glass he went out and walked up and down the street . Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of his sad attachment to Sue . Though Arabella 's word was absolutely untrustworthy , he thought there might be some truth in her implication that she had not wished to disturb him , and had really supposed him dead . However , there was only one thing now to be done , and that was to play a straightforward part , the law being the law , and the woman between whom and himself there was no more unity than between east and west being in the eye of the Church one person with him . Having to meet Arabella here , it was impossible to meet Sue at Alfredston as he had promised . At every thought of this a pang had gone through him ; but the conjuncture could not be helped . Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his unauthorized love . Passing the evening , therefore , in a desultory waiting about the town wherein he avoided the precincts of every cloister and hall , because he could not bear to behold them , he repaired to the tavern bar while the hundred and one strokes were resounding from the Great Bell of Cardinal College , a coincidence which seemed to him gratuitous irony . The inn was now brilliantly lighted up , and the scene was altogether more brisk and gay . The faces of the barmaidens had risen in colour , each having a pink flush on her cheek ; their manners were still more vivacious than before - more abandoned , more excited , more sensuous , and they expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically , laughing in a lackadaisical tone , without reserve . The bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous hour , and he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices ; but the customers were fewer at last . He nodded to Arabella , and told her that she would find him outside the door when she came away . "
76412	76420	76404	76404	you	1803	" she said with great good humour . "
76454	76534	76535	76535	I	0	" She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy ; and though she had evidently , from her countenance , already taken in enough alcohol either by drinking or , more probably , from the atmosphere she had breathed for so many hours , she finished hers quickly . He also drank his , and went outside the house . In a few minutes she came , in a thick jacket and a hat with a black feather . "
76540	76548	76535	76535	I	0	" she said , taking his arm , "
76572	76573	76566	76566	you	0	" "
76580	76640	76566	76566	you	0	" he answered , thoroughly sick and tired , his thoughts again reverting to Alfredston , and the train he did not go by ; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when she arrived , and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen . "
76659	76660	76653	76653	her	965	" "
76681	76724	76672	76672	I	0	" There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella , who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him , coming to the bedside of his dying aunt , and meeting Sue . Yet he said , "
76737	76738	76672	76672	I	0	" "
76854	76855	76857	76857	you	0	" "
76860	76861	76857	76857	you	0	" "
76900	77067	76891	76891	nobody	4069	" She speedily returned , and they went on to the railway , and made the half - hour 's journey to Aldbrickham , where they entered a third - rate inn near the station in time for a late supper . IX On the morrow between nine and half - past they were journeying back to Christminster , the only two occupants of a compartment in a third - class railway - carriage . Having , like Jude , made rather a hasty toilet to catch the train , Arabella looked a little frowsy , and her face was very far from possessing the animation which had characterized it at the bar the night before . When they came out of the station she found that she still had half an hour to spare before she was due at the bar . They walked in silence a little way out of the town in the direction of Alfredston . Jude looked up the far highway . "
77074	77080	76891	76891	nobody	4069	" he murmured at last . "
77083	77087	76891	76891	nobody	4069	" said she . "

77183	77184	77162	77162	I	0	" "
77211	77212	77189	77189	you	0	" "
77275	77283	77258	77258	I	0	" Arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her . "
77290	77291	77284	77284	You	0	" "
77299	77304	77296	77296	I	0	" said Jude impatiently . "

77385	77386	77377	77377	I	0	" "

77405	77406	77412	77412	him	1820	" "
77470	77477	77461	77461	he	1820	" Jude stood pale and fixed . "
77490	77494	77483	77483	you	1825	" he said . "
77512	77513	77503	77503	you	1825	" "
77536	77537	77526	77526	you	1825	" "
77549	77550	77551	77551	I	0	" "
77558	77562	77551	77551	I	0	" replied Jude . "
77580	77581	77551	77551	I	0	" "
77651	77652	77645	77645	I	0	" "
77682	77683	77676	77676	you	1825	" "
77727	77995	77711	77711	I	0	" Thus they parted . Jude watched her disappear in the direction of the hotel , and entered the railway station close by . Finding that it wanted three - quarters of an hour of the time at which he could get a train back to Alfredston , he strolled mechanically into the city as far as to the Fourways , where he stood as he had so often stood before , and surveyed Chief Street stretching ahead , with its college after college , in picturesqueness unrivalled except by such Continental vistas as the Street of Palaces in Genoa ; the lines of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an architectural drawing . But Jude was far from seeing or criticizing these things ; they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of Arabella 's midnight contiguity , a sense of degradation at his revived experiences with her , of her appearance as she lay asleep at dawn , which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst . If he could only have felt resentment towards her he would have been less unhappy ; but he pitied while he contemned her . Jude turned and retraced his steps . Drawing again towards the station he started at hearing his name pronounced - less at the name than at the voice . To his great surprise no other than Sue stood like a vision before him - her look bodeful and anxious as in a dream , her little mouth nervous , and her strained eyes speaking reproachful inquiry . "
78011	78077	77998	77998	Jude	180	" she said in quick , uneven accents not far from a sob . Then she flushed as she observed his thought that they had not met since her marriage . They looked away from each other to hide their emotion , took each other 's hand without further speech , and went on together awhile , till she glanced at him with furtive solicitude . "
78236	78237	78228	78228	you	180	" "
78255	78256	78257	78257	I	0	" "
78278	78279	78280	78280	I	0	" "
78329	78330	78322	78322	I	0	" "
78345	78357	78358	78358	you	180	" she said , the faintest pout entering into her tone , "
78374	78375	78376	78376	I	0	" "
78415	78556	78557	78557	You	1847	" Looking at his loved one as she appeared to him now , in his tender thought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he had ever had , living largely in vivid imaginings , so ethereal a creature that her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs , he felt heartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had spent in Arabella 's company . There was something rude and immoral in thrusting these recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who , to him , was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human wife to any average man . And yet she was Phillotson 's . How she had become such , how she lived as such , passed his comprehension as he regarded her to - day . "
78564	78568	78557	78557	You	1847	" he said . "
78614	78615	78606	78606	you	174	" "
78658	78780	78781	78781	Sue	174	" He was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for nothing . He released her hand till they had entered the train , - it seemed the same carriage he had lately got out of with another - where they sat down side by side , Sue between him and the window . He regarded the delicate lines of her profile , and the small , tight , applelike convexities of her bodice , so different from Arabella 's amplitudes . Though she knew he was looking at her she did not turn to him , but kept her eyes forward , as if afraid that by meeting his own some troublous discussion would be initiated . "
78813	78814	78804	78804	we	1850	" "
78820	78825	78804	78804	we	1850	" she quickly returned . "
78835	78836	78837	78837	Jude	180	" "
78851	78855	78847	78847	you	180	" she entreated . "
78875	78898	78870	78870	you	180	" She had asked the question in perfect innocence , to change the topic . He knew that , and said merely , "
78903	78970	78870	78870	you	180	" though it would have been a relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one . But the latter 's final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered him lest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury . Their talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached Alfredston . That Sue was not as she had been , but was labelled "
78973	79095	78971	78971	Phillotson	163	" paralyzed Jude whenever he wanted to commune with her as an individual . Yet she seemed unaltered - he could not say why . There remained the five - mile extra journey into the country , which it was just as easy to walk as to drive , the greater part of it being uphill . Jude had never before in his life gone that road with Sue , though he had with another . It was now as if he carried a bright light which temporarily banished the shady associations of the earlier time . Sue talked ; but Jude noticed that she still kept the conversation from herself . At length he inquired if her husband were well . "
79099	79103	79104	79104	He	1852	" she said . "
79221	79235	79215	79215	I	0	" Jude had walked moodily while this praise of Phillotson was being expressed . "
79247	79251	79236	79237	Mr. Phillotson	163	" he said . "
79255	79256	79236	79237	Mr. Phillotson	163	" "
79265	79266	79257	79257	You	0	" "
79273	79274	79275	79275	Bride	312	" "
79301	79302	79293	79293	I	0	" "
79311	79345	79308	79308	I	0	" There was something in her face which belied her late assuring words , so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in "
79353	79429	79308	79308	I	0	" Jude knew the quality of every vibration in Sue 's voice , could read every symptom of her mental condition ; and he was convinced that she was unhappy , although she had not been a month married . But her rushing away thus from home , to see the last of a relative whom she had hardly known in her life , proved nothing ; for Sue naturally did such things as those . "
79444	79452	79441	79442	Mrs. Phillotson	258	" She reproached him by a glance . "
79461	79465	79458	79459	Mrs. Phillotson	258	" murmured Jude . "
79503	79517	79481	79481	Wifedom	1858	" Sue put on a look of being offended , till she answered , "
79530	79531	79520	79520	husbandom	1859	" "
79536	79594	79520	79520	husbandom	1859	" he said , shaking his head sadly . When they reached the lone cottage under the firs , between the Brown House and Marygreen , in which Jude and Arabella had lived and quarrelled , he turned to look at it . A squalid family lived there now . He could not help saying to Sue : "
79621	79627	79613	79613	I	0	" She looked at it . "
79643	79644	79613	79613	I	0	" "
79660	79687	79690	79690	I	0	" She closed her lips in retortive silence , and they walked some way till she glanced at him to see how he was taking it . "
79701	79706	79690	79690	I	0	" he continued blandly . "
79775	79776	79771	79771	you	180	" "
79789	79790	79777	79777	I	0	" "
79804	79805	79792	79792	you	180	" "
79810	79907	79908	79908	She	1871	" He said no more , but he knew that , from some cause or other , in taking Phillotson as a husband , Sue felt that she had done what she ought not to have done . They plunged into the concave field on the other side of which rose the village - the field wherein Jude had received a thrashing from the farmer many years earlier . On ascending to the village and approaching the house they found Mrs. Edlin standing at the door , who at sight of them lifted her hands deprecatingly . "
79918	79923	79908	79908	She	1871	" cried the widow . "
79946	79992	79993	79993	Ah	1874	" On entering , there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman , wrapped in blankets , and turning upon them a countenance like that of Sebastiano 's Lazarus . They must have looked their amazement , for she said in a hollow voice : "
80062	80070	80052	80052	you	1873	" she added , turning to Sue . "
80110	80111	80106	80106	ee	1884	" "
80120	80121	80106	80106	ee	1884	" "

80160	80161	80158	80158	Aunt	1888	" "
80242	80263	80237	80237	I	0	" Sue jumped up and went out . Jude followed her , and found her in the outhouse , crying . "
80270	80276	80237	80237	I	0	" said Jude in distress . "
80292	80293	80277	80277	She	1896	" "
80302	80312	80277	80277	She	1896	" said Sue , trying to dry her eyes . "
80322	80323	80313	80313	I	0	" "
80330	80331	80336	80336	she	1896	" "
80343	80344	80336	80336	she	1896	" "
80355	80359	80349	80349	you	795	" asked Jude . "
80366	80371	80360	80360	I	0	" she said hastily . "
80384	80460	80461	80461	I	0	" He wondered if she had really been going to say that at first . They went back , and the subject was smoothed over , and her aunt took rather kindly to Sue , telling her that not many young women newly married would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her . In the afternoon Sue prepared to depart , Jude hiring a neighbour to drive her to Alfredston . "
80475	80512	80513	80513	I	0	" he said . She would not let him . The man came round with the trap , and Jude helped her into it , perhaps with unnecessary attention , for she looked at him prohibitively . "
80533	80547	80600	80600	She	0	" he half - crossly observed . She bent down and said softly : "
80570	80571	80559	80559	I	0	" "
80575	80579	80559	80559	I	0	" said Jude . "
80584	80585	80559	80559	I	0	" "
80590	80599	80600	80600	She	0	" She waved her hand and was gone . "
80609	81112	80604	80604	I	0	" he murmured . He passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every possible means his wish to see her , nearly starving himself in attempts to extinguish by fasting his passionate tendency to love her . He read sermons on discipline , and hunted up passages in Church history that treated of the Ascetics of the second century . Before he had returned from Marygreen to Melchester there arrived a letter from Arabella . The sight of it revived a stronger feeling of self - condemnation for his brief return to her society than for his attachment to Sue . The letter , he perceived , bore a London postmark instead of the Christminster one . Arabella informed him that a few days after their parting in the morning at Christminster , she had been surprised by an affectionate letter from her Australian husband , formerly manager of the hotel in Sydney . He had come to England on purpose to find her ; and had taken a free , fully - licensed public , in Lambeth , where he wished her to join him in conducting the business , which was likely to be a very thriving one , the house being situated in an excellent , densely populated , gin - drinking neighbourhood , and already doing a trade of L200 a month , which could be easily doubled . As he had said that he loved her very much still , and implored her to tell him where she was , and as they had only parted in a slight tiff , and as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary , she had just gone to join him as he urged . She could not help feeling that she belonged to him more than to Jude , since she had properly married him , and had lived with him much longer than with her first husband . In thus wishing Jude good - bye she bore him no ill - will , and trusted he would not turn upon her , a weak woman , and inform against her , and bring her to ruin now that she had a chance of improving her circumstances and leading a genteel life . X Jude returned to Melchester , which had the questionable recommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his Sue 's now permanent residence . At first he felt that this nearness was a distinct reason for not going southward at all ; but Christminster was too sad a place to bear , while the proximity of Shaston to Melchester might afford him the glory of worsting the Enemy in a close engagement , such as was deliberately sought by the priests and virgins of the early Church , who , disdaining an ignominious flight from temptation , became even chamber - partners with impunity . Jude did not pause to remember that , in the laconic words of the historian , "
81119	81505	81530	81534	a professional musician at Kennetbridge	1903	" in such circumstances . He now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the priesthood - in the recognition that the single - mindedness of his aims , and his fidelity to the cause , had been more than questionable of late . His passion for Sue troubled his soul ; yet his lawful abandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed instinctively a worse thing - even though she had not told him of her Sydney husband till afterwards . He had , he verily believed , overcome all tendency to fly to liquor - which , indeed , he had never done from taste , but merely as an escape from intolerable misery of mind . Yet he perceived with despondency that , taken all round , he was a man of too many passions to make a good clergyman ; the utmost he could hope for was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and spirit the former might not always be victorious . As a hobby , auxiliary to his readings in Divinity , he developed his slight skill in church - music and thorough - bass , till he could join in part - singing from notation with some accuracy . A mile or two from Melchester there was a restored village church , to which Jude had originally gone to fix the new columns and capitals . By this means he had become acquainted with the organist , and the ultimate result was that he joined the choir as a bass voice . He walked out to this parish twice every Sunday , and sometimes in the week . One evening about Easter the choir met for practice , and a new hymn which Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer was to be tried and prepared for the following week . It turned out to be a strangely emotional composition . As they all sang it over and over again its harmonies grew upon Jude , and moved him exceedingly . When they had finished he went round to the organist to make inquiries . The score was in manuscript , the name of the composer being at the head , together with the title of the hymn : "
81512	81513	81530	81534	a professional musician at Kennetbridge	1903	" "
81516	81521	81522	81522	He	1901	" said the organist . "
81610	81681	81682	81682	He	1907	" As he walked humming the air on his way home , Jude fell to musing on its composer , and the reasons why he composed it . What a man of sympathies he must be ! Perplexed and harassed as he himself was about Sue and Arabella , and troubled as was his conscience by the complication of his position , how he would like to know that man ! "
81691	81849	81682	81682	He	1907	" said the impulsive Jude . If there were any person in the world to choose as a confidant , this composer would be the one , for he must have suffered , and throbbed , and yearned . In brief , ill as he could afford the time and money for the journey , Fawley resolved , like the child that he was , to go to Kennetbridge the very next Sunday . He duly started , early in the morning , for it was only by a series of crooked railways that he could get to the town . About mid - day he reached it , and crossing the bridge into the quaint old borough he inquired for the house of the composer . They told him it was a red brick building some little way further on . Also that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not five minutes before . "
81853	81859	81682	81682	He	1907	" asked Jude with alacrity . "
81866	81906	81682	81682	He	1907	" Jude hastened on , and soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a black coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance ahead . Stretching out his legs yet more widely he stalked after . "
81917	81921	81922	81922	I	0	" he said . "
81929	82091	81926	81927	that man	1681	" He could not , however , overtake the musician before he had entered his own house , and then arose the question if this were an expedient time to call . Whether or not he decided to do so there and then , now that he had got here , the distance home being too great for him to wait till late in the afternoon . This man of soul would understand scant ceremony , and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in which an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained entrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion . Jude accordingly rang the bell , and was admitted . The musician came to him in a moment , and being respectably dressed , good - looking , and frank in manner , Jude obtained a favourable reception . He was nevertheless conscious that there would be a certain awkwardness in explaining his errand . "
82106	82110	82092	82092	I	0	" he said . "
82135	82136	82137	82137	I	0	" "
82146	82147	82137	82137	I	0	" "
82159	82160	82153	82153	I	0	" "
82351	82876	82346	82346	you	1921	" He handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet shape , ornamentally margined with a red line , in which were set forth the various clarets , champagnes , ports , sherries , and other wines with which he purposed to initiate his new venture . It took Jude more than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus ; and he felt that he could not open up his confidences . They talked a little longer , but constrainedly , for when the musician found that Jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had been while Jude 's appearance and address deceived him as to his position and pursuits . Jude stammered out something about his feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted composition , and took an embarrassed leave . All the way home by the slow Sunday train , sitting in the fireless waiting - rooms on this cold spring day , he was depressed enough at his simplicity in taking such a journey . But no sooner did he reach his Melchester lodging than he found awaiting him a letter which had arrived that morning a few minutes after he had left the house . It was a contrite little note from Sue , in which she said , with sweet humility , that she felt she had been horrid in telling him he was not to come to see her , that she despised herself for having been so conventional ; and that he was to be sure to come by the eleven - forty - five train that very Sunday , and have dinner with them at half - past one . Jude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was too late to act upon its contents ; but he had chastened himself considerably of late , and at last his chimerical expedition to Kennetbridge really did seem to have been another special intervention of Providence to keep him away from temptation . But a growing impatience of faith , which he had noticed in himself more than once of late , made him pass over in ridicule the idea that God sent people on fools ' errands . He longed to see her ; he was angry at having missed her : and he wrote instantly , telling her what had happened , and saying he had not enough patience to wait till the following Sunday , but would come any day in the week that she liked to name . Since he wrote a little over - ardently , Sue , as her manner was , delayed her reply till Thursday before Good Friday , when she said he might come that afternoon if he wished , this being the earliest day on which she could welcome him , for she was now assistant - teacher in her husband 's school . Jude therefore got leave from the cathedral works at the trifling expense of a stoppage of pay , and went . Part Fourth AT SHASTON "
82917	83060	83061	83062	the Martyr	1927	" - J. MILTON . I Shaston , the ancient British Palladour , From whose foundation first such strange reports arise , as Drayton sang it , was , and is , in itself the city of a dream . Vague imaginings of its castle , its three mints , its magnificent apsidal abbey , the chief glory of South Wessex , its twelve churches , its shrines , chantries , hospitals , its gabled freestone mansions - all now ruthlessly swept away - throw the visitor , even against his will , into a pensive melancholy , which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel . The spot was the burial - place of a king and a queen , of abbots and abbesses , saints and bishops , knights and squires . The bones of King Edward "
83064	84200	83061	83062	the Martyr	1927	" carefully removed hither for holy preservation , brought Shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part of Europe , and enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far beyond English shores . To this fair creation of the great Middle - Age the Dissolution was , as historians tell us , the death - knell . With the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a general ruin : the Martyr 's bones met with the fate of the sacred pile that held them , and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie . The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain ; but strange to say these qualities , which were noted by many writers in ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated , are passed over in this , and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in England stands virtually unvisited to - day . It has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp , rising on the north , south , and west sides of the borough out of the deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor , the view from the Castle Green over three counties of verdant pasture - South , Mid , and Nether Wessex - being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller 's eyes as the medicinal air is to his lungs . Impossible to a railway , it can best be reached on foot , next best by light vehicles ; and it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the north - east , that connects it with the high chalk table - land on that side . Such is , and such was , the now world - forgotten Shaston or Palladour . Its situation rendered water the great want of the town ; and within living memory , horses , donkeys and men may have been seen toiling up the winding ways to the top of the height , laden with tubs and barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain , and hawkers retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful . This difficulty in the water supply , together with two other odd facts , namely , that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a roof behind the church , and that in former times the town passed through a curious period of corruption , conventual and domestic , gave rise to the saying that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations to man , such as the world afforded not elsewhere . It was a place where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple , where beer was more plentiful than water , and where there were more wanton women than honest wives and maids . It is also said that after the Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests , and hence were compelled to pull down their churches , and refrain altogether from the public worship of God ; a necessity which they bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday afternoons . In those days the Shastonians were apparently not without a sense of humour . There was another peculiarity - this a modern one - which Shaston appeared to owe to its site . It was the resting - place and headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans , shows , shooting - galleries , and other itinerant concerns , whose business lay largely at fairs and markets . As strange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory , meditatively pausing for longer flights , or to return by the course they followed thither , so here , in this cliff - town , stood in stultified silence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local , as if surprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress ; and here they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring . It was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the nearest station for the first time in his life about four o'clock one afternoon , and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome climb , passed the first houses of the aerial town ; and drew towards the school - house . The hour was too early ; the pupils were still in school , humming small , like a swarm of gnats ; and he withdrew a few steps along Abbey Walk , whence he regarded the spot which fate had made the home of all he loved best in the world . In front of the schools , which were extensive and stone - built , grew two enormous beeches with smooth mouse - coloured trunks , as such trees will only grow on chalk uplands . Within the mullioned and transomed windows he could see the black , brown , and flaxen crowns of the scholars over the sills , and to pass the time away he walked down to the level terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread , his heart throbbing in spite of him . Unwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he remained here till young voices could be heard in the open air , and girls in white pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths which the abbess , prioress , subprioress , and fifty nuns had demurely paced three centuries earlier . Retracing his steps he found that he had waited too long , and that Sue had gone out into the town at the heels of the last scholar , Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the afternoon at a teachers ' meeting at Shottsford . Jude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down , the girl who was sweeping the floor having informed him that Mrs. Phillotson would be back again in a few minutes . A piano stood near - actually the old piano that Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen - and though the dark afternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes Jude touched them in his humble way , and could not help modulating into the hymn which had so affected him in the previous week . A figure moved behind him , and thinking it was still the girl with the broom Jude took no notice , till the person came close and laid her fingers lightly upon his bass hand . The imposed hand was a little one he seemed to know , and he turned . "
84205	84209	84210	84210	I	0	" said Sue . "
84232	84233	84222	84222	They	1928	" "
84246	84247	84239	84239	you	0	" "
84256	84334	84251	84251	I	0	" Sue sat down , and her rendering of the piece , though not remarkable , seemed divine as compared with his own . She , like him , was evidently touched - to her own surprise - by the recalled air ; and when she had finished , and he moved his hand towards hers , it met his own half - way . Jude grasped it - just as he had done before her marriage . "
84339	84349	84239	84239	you	0	" she said , in a voice quite changed , "
84360	84361	84351	84351	I	0	" "

84418	84452	84403	84403	you	0	" She played on and suddenly turned round ; and by an unpremeditated instinct each clasped the other 's hand again . She uttered a forced little laugh as she relinquished his quickly . "
84456	84460	84403	84403	you	0	" she said . "
84470	84471	84472	84472	I	0	" "

84575	84580	84565	84565	you	0	" he said drily . "
84588	84592	84582	84582	we	1930	" said Sue . "
84716	84775	84704	84704	I	0	" He waited in the light of the stove , the door of which she flung open before going out , and when she returned , followed by the maiden with tea , they sat down by the same light , assisted by the blue rays of a spirit - lamp under the brass kettle on the stand . "
84787	84795	84704	84704	I	0	" she said , signifying the latter . "
84798	84827	84704	84704	I	0	" said Jude . The kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note , to his mind ; and to change the subject he said , "
84856	84857	84845	84845	You	0	" "
84901	84902	84896	84896	Cowper	323	" "
84910	84921	84896	84896	Cowper	323	" His thoughts , however reverted with a twinge to the "
84924	84953	84896	84896	Cowper	323	" - by whom she meant , as he knew , the university comrade of her earlier days . He wondered if she talked of him to Phillotson . "
84962	85016	84957	84957	Nicodemus	324	" she went on to keep him from his jealous thoughts , which she read clearly , as she always did . Indeed when they talked on an indifferent subject , as now , there was ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions , so perfect was the reciprocity between them . "
85079	85080	85074	85074	you	180	" "
85091	85097	85086	85086	Divinity	325	" She regarded him curiously . "
85107	85111	85100	85100	you	180	" said Jude . "
85121	85122	85100	85100	you	180	" "
85154	85155	85140	85140	You	180	" "
85165	85169	85140	85140	You	180	" she coaxed . "
85189	85190	85171	85171	you	180	" "

85310	85322	85323	85323	Sue	174	" The tremolo in her voice caused her to break off . "
85333	85367	85325	85325	I	0	" said he abruptly . There was a momentary pause , till she suddenly jumped up ; and to his surprise he saw by the kettle - flame that her face was flushed . "
85379	85394	85377	85377	Jude	180	" she said , the tragic contralto note having come back as of old . "
85599	85600	85602	85602	you	0	" "
85604	85605	85602	85602	you	0	" "
85637	85699	85710	85710	Jude	180	" As they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner , she touched his fingers but lightly when he went out now . He had hardly gone from the door when , with a dissatisfied look , she jumped on a form and opened the iron casement of a window beneath which he was passing in the path without . "
85712	85723	85710	85710	Jude	180	" she asked . He looked up in some surprise . "
85742	85743	85710	85710	Jude	180	" "

85907	85944	85945	85945	I	0	" Now that the high window - sill was between them , so that he could not get at her , she seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she had feared at close quarters . "
85950	85964	85945	85945	I	0	" she continued , still in the tone of one brimful of feeling , "
86069	86070	86061	86061	You	180	" "
86073	86077	86061	86061	You	180	" said Jude . "
86083	86084	86061	86061	You	180	" "
86098	86523	86061	86061	You	180	" She stretched out her hand and stroked his forehead pitifully - just once . Jude said good - bye , and went away into the darkness . Passing along Bimport Street he thought he heard the wheels of the coach departing , and , truly enough , when he reached the Duke 's Arms in the Market Place the coach had gone . It was impossible for him to get to the station on foot in time for this train , and he settled himself perforce to wait for the next - the last to Melchester that night . He wandered about awhile , obtained something to eat ; and then , having another half - hour on his hands , his feet involuntarily took him through the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church , with its avenues of limes , in the direction of the schools again . They were entirely in darkness . She had said she lived over the way at Old - Grove Place , a house which he soon discovered from her description of its antiquity . A glimmering candlelight shone from a front window , the shutters being yet unclosed . He could see the interior clearly - the floor sinking a couple of steps below the road without , which had become raised during the centuries since the house was built . Sue , evidently just come in , was standing with her hat on in this front parlour or sitting - room , whose walls were lined with wainscoting of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling , the latter being crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head . The mantelpiece was of the same heavy description , carved with Jacobean pilasters and scroll - work . The centuries did , indeed , ponderously overhang a young wife who passed her time here . She had opened a rosewood work - box , and was looking at a photograph . Having contemplated it a little while she pressed it against her bosom , and put it again in its place . Then becoming aware that she had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so , candle in hand . It was too dark for her to see Jude without , but he could see her face distinctly , and there was an unmistakable tearfulness about the dark , long - lashed eyes . She closed the shutters , and Jude turned away to pursue his solitary journey home . "
86531	86899	86061	86061	You	180	" he said . He had once given her his ; but she had others , he knew . Yet it was his , surely ? He knew he should go to see her again , according to her invitation . Those earnest men he read of , the saints , whom Sue , with gentle irreverence , called his demi - gods , would have shunned such encounters if they doubted their own strength . But he could not . He might fast and pray during the whole interval , but the human was more powerful in him than the Divine . II However , if God disposed not , woman did . The next morning but one brought him this note from her : Do n't come next week . On your own account do n't ! We were too free , under the influence of that morbid hymn and the twilight . Think no more than you can help of SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY . The disappointment was keen . He knew her mood , the look of her face , when she subscribed herself at length thus . But whatever her mood he could not say she was wrong in her view . He replied : I acquiesce . You are right . It is a lesson in renunciation which I suppose I ought to learn at this season . JUDE . He despatched the note on Easter Eve , and there seemed a finality in their decisions . But other forces and laws than theirs were in operation . On Easter Monday morning he received a message from the Widow Edlin , whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious happened : Your aunt is sinking . Come at once . He threw down his tools and went . Three and a half hours later he was crossing the downs about Marygreen , and presently plunged into the concave field across which the short cut was made to the village . As he ascended on the other side a labouring man , who had been watching his approach from a gate across the path , moved uneasily , and prepared to speak . "
86911	86915	86900	86900	I	0	" said Jude . "
86920	86943	86944	86944	She	1973	" It was as he had supposed , and Mrs. Edlin had sent out the man to break the news to him . "
86973	87340	87341	87341	I	0	" said he . Jude went on to the house , and in the afternoon , when everything was done , and the layers - out had finished their beer , and gone , he sat down alone in the silent place . It was absolutely necessary to communicate with Sue , though two or three days earlier they had agreed to mutual severance . He wrote in the briefest terms : Aunt Drusilla is dead , having been taken almost suddenly . The funeral is on Friday afternoon . He remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days , went out on Friday morning to see that the grave was finished , and wondered if Sue would come . She had not written , and that seemed to signify rather that she would come than that she would not . Having timed her by her only possible train , he locked the door about mid - day , and crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by the Brown House , where he stood and looked over the vast prospect northwards , and over the nearer landscape in which Alfredston stood . Two miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left to the right of the picture . There was a long time to wait , even now , till he would know if she had arrived . He did wait , however , and at last a small hired vehicle pulled up at the bottom of the hill , and a person alighted , the conveyance going back , while the passenger began ascending the hill . He knew her ; and she looked so slender to - day that it seemed as if she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate embrace - such as it was not for him to give . Two - thirds of the way up her head suddenly took a solicitous poise , and he knew that she had at that moment recognized him . Her face soon began a pensive smile , which lasted till , having descended a little way , he met her . "
87344	87351	87341	87341	I	0	" she began with nervous quickness , "
87377	87378	87374	87374	I	0	" "
87383	87563	87379	87381	Dear faithful Sue	174	" murmured Jude . With the elusiveness of her curious double nature , however , Sue did not stand still for any further greeting , though it wanted some time to the burial . A pathos so unusually compounded as that which attached to this hour was unlikely to repeat itself for years , if ever , and Jude would have paused , and meditated , and conversed . But Sue either saw it not at all , or , seeing it more than he , would not allow herself to feel it . The sad and simple ceremony was soon over , their progress to the church being almost at a trot , the bustling undertaker having a more important funeral an hour later , three miles off . Drusilla was put into the new ground , quite away from her ancestors . Sue and Jude had gone side by side to the grave , and now sat down to tea in the familiar house ; their lives united at least in this last attention to the dead . "
87578	87582	87564	87564	She	1978	" murmured Sue . "
87592	87604	87564	87564	She	1978	" Her eyes met his , and remained on him awhile . "
87619	87620	87621	87621	She	1978	" "
87646	87651	87640	87640	I	0	" Sue was silent . "
87658	87666	87640	87640	I	0	" she said with a tentative tremor , "
87769	87770	87771	87771	I	0	" "
87781	87787	87771	87771	I	0	" Presently she went on : "
87807	87808	87811	87811	I	0	" "
87824	87825	87811	87811	I	0	" "
87857	87868	87846	87846	she	4031	" - her voice undulated , and he guessed things - "
87919	87934	87911	87911	she	4031	" Jude threw a troubled look at her . He said , looking away : "
88002	88003	87993	87993	Sue	174	" "
88009	88013	87993	87993	Sue	174	" she contradicted . "
88034	88035	88030	88030	she	4193	" "
88041	88042	88030	88030	she	4193	" "

88100	88110	88111	88111	I	0	" A little laugh of objection came from Sue . "
88123	88124	88115	88115	You	174	" "
88171	88172	88155	88156	Mrs. Edlin	313	" "
88176	88181	88155	88156	Mrs. Edlin	313	" she said dubiously . "
88193	88218	88182	88182	I	0	" Jude went to the widow 's house adjoining , to let her know ; and returning in a few minutes sat down again . "
88231	88244	88227	88227	Sue	174	" he said abruptly , with his eyes bent to the floor . "
88249	88250	88251	88251	I	0	" "
88301	88302	88296	88296	I	0	" "
88313	88314	88306	88306	you	0	" "
88330	88350	88317	88317	I	0	" Her hand lay on the table , and Jude put his upon it . Sue drew hers away . "
88357	88361	88355	88355	Sue	174	" cried he , "
88402	88403	88397	88397	you	174	" "
88410	88415	88397	88397	you	174	" she said repentantly . "
88451	88452	88449	88449	me	0	" "
88457	88458	88449	88449	me	0	" "

88541	88542	88543	88543	I	0	" "
88548	88559	88543	88543	I	0	" She winced at the hit ; then said curiously , "
88566	88567	88562	88562	you	174	" "
88574	88575	88562	88562	you	174	" "
88597	88598	88590	88590	you	174	" "
88610	88645	88604	88604	you	174	" She looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses , withered for want of attention , and through them at the outer distance , till her eyes began to grow moist . "
88650	88659	88604	88604	you	174	" said Jude , in a softened tone . "
88711	88712	88713	88715	A special Providence	2018	" "
88726	88727	88717	88717	I	0	" "
88735	88742	88717	88717	I	0	" she said with gentle resentment . "

88877	88908	88909	88909	I	0	" He gave her no opportunity of self - satisfaction , and she had to go on unaided , which she did in a vanquished tone , verging on tears : "
89012	89044	88999	88999	you	174	" She bent down her face upon her hands as they lay upon the cloth , and silently sobbed in little jerks that made the fragile three - legged table quiver . "
89055	89073	88999	88999	you	174	" she went on , still remaining bent upon the table , and sobbing into her hands . "
89143	89153	89154	89154	I	0	" Jude could hardly speak , but he said , "
89170	89171	89165	89165	I	0	" "
89370	89394	89395	89395	I	0	" But he had jumped up and put his face against hers - or rather against her ear , her face being inaccessible . "
89403	89404	89407	89407	you	180	" "
89454	89738	89444	89444	you	180	" Instead of replying she rose quickly , and saying she was going to walk to her aunt 's grave in the churchyard to recover herself , went out of the house . Jude did not follow her . Twenty minutes later he saw her cross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin 's , and soon she sent a little girl to fetch her bag , and tell him she was too tired to see him again that night . In the lonely room of his aunt 's house , Jude sat watching the cottage of the Widow Edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade . He knew that Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and disheartened ; and again questioned his devotional motto that all was for the best . He retired to rest early , but his sleep was fitful from the sense that Sue was so near at hand . At some time near two o'clock , when he was beginning to sleep more soundly , he was aroused by a shrill squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly at Marygreen . It was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin . As was the little creature 's habit , it did not soon repeat its cry ; and probably would not do so more than once or twice ; but would remain bearing its torture till the morrow when the trapper would come and knock it on the head . He who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now began to picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg . If it were a "
89741	89804	89444	89444	you	180	" by the hind - leg , the animal would tug during the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap had stripped the leg - bone of its flesh , when , should a weak - springed instrument enable it to escape , it would die in the fields from the mortification of the limb . If it were a "
89808	89976	89977	89977	Jude	180	" namely , by the fore - leg , the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in attempts at an impossible escape . Almost half an hour passed , and the rabbit repeated its cry . Jude could rest no longer till he had put it out of its pain , so dressing himself quickly he descended , and by the light of the moon went across the green in the direction of the sound . He reached the hedge bordering the widow 's garden , when he stood still . The faint click of the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal guided him now , and reaching the spot he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck with the side of his palm , and it stretched itself out dead . He was turning away when he saw a woman looking out of the open casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage . "
89979	89989	89977	89977	Jude	180	" said a voice timidly - Sue 's voice . "
89998	89999	89992	89992	you	180	" "
90004	90005	89992	89992	you	180	" "
90069	90114	90067	90067	they	2035	" Jude had reached the window , which was quite a low one , so that she was visible down to her waist . She let go the casement - stay and put her hand upon his , her moonlit face regarding him wistfully . "
90121	90125	90067	90067	they	2035	" he said . "
90132	90133	90067	90067	they	2035	" "
90138	90139	90067	90067	they	2035	" "
90194	90195	90188	90188	I	0	" "
90203	90207	90201	90201	dear	795	" he said . "
90225	90226	90227	90227	I	0	" "
90285	90294	90297	90300	a stronger one left	2041	" Jude seized her hand and kissed it . "
90302	90306	90297	90300	a stronger one left	2041	" he said . "
90341	90342	90352	90352	you	795	" "
90381	90382	90383	90383	I	0	" "
90394	90395	90396	90396	I	0	" "
90644	90645	90641	90641	they	2052	" "
90661	90662	90655	90655	I	0	" "
90669	90951	90663	90663	You	0	" In a moment of impulse she bent over the sill , and laid her face upon his hair , weeping , and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little kiss upon the top of his head , withdrawing quickly , so that he could not put his arms round her , as otherwise he unquestionably would have done . She shut the casement , and he returned to his cottage . III Sue 's distressful confession recurred to Jude 's mind all the night as being a sorrow indeed . The morning after , when it was time for her to go , the neighbours saw her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path which led into the lonely road to Alfredston . An hour passed before he returned along the same route , and in his face there was a look of exaltation not unmixed with recklessness . An incident had occurred . They had stood parting in the silent highway , and their tense and passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how far their intimacy ought to go ; till they had almost quarrelled , and she said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he now wished to do . Then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss would be nothing : all would depend upon the spirit of it . If given in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection : if in the spirit of a lover she could not permit it . "
90964	91269	90953	90953	you	2054	" she had said . No : he would not . And then they had turned from each other in estrangement , and gone their several ways , till at a distance of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously . That look behind was fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less maintained . They had quickly run back , and met , and embracing most unpremeditatedly , kissed close and long . When they parted for good it was with flushed cheeks on her side , and a beating heart on his . The kiss was a turning - point in Jude 's career . Back again in the cottage , and left to reflection , he saw one thing : that though his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life , as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at its best a frailty , and at its worst damnation . What Sue had said in warmth was really the cold truth . When to defend his affection tooth and nail , to persist with headlong force in impassioned attentions to her , was all he thought of , he was condemned ipso facto as a professor of the accepted school of morals . He was as unfit , obviously , by nature , as he had been by social position , to fill the part of a propounder of accredited dogma . Strange that his first aspiration - towards academical proficiency - had been checked by a woman , and that his second aspiration - towards apostleship - had also been checked by a woman . "
91273	91277	90953	90953	you	2054	" he said , "
91320	91599	90953	90953	you	2054	" It had been his standing desire to become a prophet , however humble , to his struggling fellow - creatures , without any thought of personal gain . Yet with a wife living away from him with another husband , and himself in love erratically , the loved one 's revolt against her state being possibly on his account , he had sunk to be barely respectable according to regulation views . It was not for him to consider further : he had only to confront the obvious , which was that he had made himself quite an impostor as a law - abiding religious teacher . At dusk that evening he went into the garden and dug a shallow hole , to which he brought out all the theological and ethical works that he possessed , and had stored here . He knew that , in this country of true believers , most of them were not saleable at a much higher price than waste - paper value , and preferred to get rid of them in his own way , even if he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of thus destroying them . Lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with , he cut the volumes into pieces as well as he could , and with a three - pronged fork shook them over the flames . They kindled , and lighted up the back of the house , the pigsty , and his own face , till they were more or less consumed . Though he was almost a stranger here now , passing cottagers talked to him over the garden hedge . "
91632	91894	91895	91895	I	0	" It was nearly one o'clock in the morning before the leaves , covers , and binding of Jeremy Taylor , Butler , Doddridge , Paley , Pusey , Newman and the rest had gone to ashes , but the night was quiet , and as he turned and turned the paper shreds with the fork , the sense of being no longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which gave him calm . He might go on believing as before , but he professed nothing , and no longer owned and exhibited engines of faith which , as their proprietor , he might naturally be supposed to exercise on himself first of all . In his passion for Sue he could not stand as an ordinary sinner , and not as a whited sepulchre . Meanwhile Sue , after parting from him earlier in the day , had gone along to the station , with tears in her eyes for having run back and let him kiss her . Jude ought not to have pretended that he was not a lover , and made her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally , if not wrongly . She was inclined to call it the latter ; for Sue 's logic was extraordinarily compounded , and seemed to maintain that before a thing was done it might be right to do , but that being done it became wrong ; or , in other words , that things which were right in theory were wrong in practice . "
91904	91922	91901	91901	I	0	" she jerked out as she pranced on , shaking down tear - drops now and then . "
92017	92213	92214	92214	Richard	258	" - Tears of pity for Jude 's approaching sufferings at her hands mingled with those which had surged up in pity for herself . Then the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable to her , the ethereal , fine - nerved , sensitive girl , quite unfitted by temperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial relation with Phillotson , possibly with scarce any man , walked fitfully along , and panted , and brought weariness into her eyes by gazing and worrying hopelessly . Phillotson met her at the arrival station , and , seeing that she was troubled , thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her aunt 's death and funeral . He began telling her of his day 's doings , and how his friend Gillingham , a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he had not seen for years , had called upon him . While ascending to the town , seated on the top of the omnibus beside him , she said suddenly and with an air of self - chastisement , regarding the white road and its bordering bushes of hazel : "
92237	92252	92256	92256	you	258	" He , waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould , said vaguely , "
92265	92266	92267	92267	I	0	" "
92281	92282	92277	92277	I	0	" "
92298	92475	92476	92476	I	0	" They lapsed into silence . Had this been a case in the court of an omniscient judge , he might have entered on his notes the curious fact that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion , and had not said a word about the kiss . After tea that evening Phillotson sat balancing the school registers . She remained in an unusually silent , tense , and restless condition , and at last , saying she was tired , went to bed early . When Phillotson arrived upstairs , weary with the drudgery of the attendance - numbers , it was a quarter to twelve o'clock . Entering their chamber , which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty miles over the Vale of Blackmoor , and even into Outer Wessex , he went to the window , and , pressing his face against the pane , gazed with hard - breathing fixity into the mysterious darkness which now covered the far - reaching scene . He was musing , "
92479	92490	92476	92476	I	0	" he said at last , without turning his head , "
92513	92527	92495	92496	the committee	2062	" There was no reply . Thinking Sue was dozing he went on : "
92559	92590	92924	92924	you	2064	" As the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he turned round . The heavy , gloomy oak wainscot , which extended over the walls upstairs and down in the dilapidated "
92596	92651	92924	92924	you	2064	" and the massive chimney - piece reaching to the ceiling , stood in odd contrast to the new and shining brass bedstead , and the new suite of birch furniture that he had bought for her , the two styles seeming to nod to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor . "
92654	92746	92924	92924	you	2064	" he said this being the way in which he pronounced her name . She was not in the bed , though she had apparently been there - the clothes on her side being flung back . Thinking she might have forgotten some kitchen detail and gone downstairs for a moment to see to it , he pulled off his coat and idled quietly enough for a few minutes , when , finding she did not come , he went out upon the landing , candle in hand , and said again "
92749	92750	92924	92924	you	2064	" "
92753	92768	92924	92924	you	2064	" came back to him in her voice , from the distant kitchen quarter . "
92784	92785	92786	92786	I	0	" "
92803	92844	92924	92924	you	2064	" He went to bed . Some time in the night he awoke . She was not there , even now . Lighting a candle he hastily stepped out upon the landing , and again called her name . She answered "
92847	92921	92924	92924	you	2064	" as before , but the tones were small and confined , and whence they came he could not at first understand . Under the staircase was a large clothes - closet , without a window ; they seemed to come from it . The door was shut , but there was no lock or other fastening . Phillotson , alarmed , went towards it , wondering if she had suddenly become deranged . "
92929	92933	92924	92924	you	2064	" he asked . "
92948	92949	92938	92938	I	0	" "
92975	92976	92924	92924	you	2064	" "
92990	92991	92938	92938	I	0	" "
92994	93067	93068	93068	You	0	" Phillotson seized the knob and pulled at the door . She had fastened it inside with a piece of string , which broke at his pull . There being no bedstead she had flung down some rugs and made a little nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet afforded . When he looked in upon her she sprang out of her lair , great - eyed and trembling . "
93078	93083	93068	93068	You	0	" she cried excitedly . "
93102	93138	93100	93100	you	0	" She looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the shadowy lumber - hole that he was quite worried . She continued to beseech him not to disturb her . He said : "
93164	93165	93139	93139	I	0	" "
93168	93174	93139	93139	I	0	" said she , weeping . "
93206	93207	93199	93199	I	0	" "
93215	93216	93213	93213	I	0	" "

93277	93283	93268	93268	Eliza	332	" He meant the servant . "
93350	93387	93341	93341	I	0	" On rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet , but Sue had already gone downstairs . There was a little nest where she had lain , and spiders ' webs hung overhead . "
93405	93475	93476	93476	Richard	258	" he said bitterly . He found her sitting at the breakfast - table , and the meal began almost in silence , the burghers walking past upon the pavement - or rather roadway , pavements being scarce here - which was two or three feet above the level of the parlour floor . They nodded down to the happy couple their morning greetings , as they went on . "
93478	93485	93487	93487	you	258	" she said all at once ; "
93495	93496	93487	93487	you	258	" "
93524	93525	93526	93526	You	258	" "

93797	93804	93781	93781	I	0	" she said with pained surprise . "
93811	93812	93805	93805	I	0	" "
93817	93818	93814	93814	you	258	" "
93824	93830	93831	93831	HE	1208	" Her eyes had filled . "
93837	93841	93831	93831	HE	1208	" she said . "
93868	93869	93863	93863	me	0	" "
93874	93875	93863	93863	me	0	" "

93943	93948	93920	93920	you	258	" she burst out , "
93963	93964	93950	93950	they	658	" "
93976	93977	93966	93966	you	258	" "
94043	94044	94037	94037	you	258	" "

94299	94300	94297	94297	Jude	180	" "
94305	94306	94297	94297	Jude	180	" "
94311	94318	94319	94319	She	2095	" Phillotson writhed . Sue continued : "
94390	94391	94384	94384	I	0	" "
94401	94405	94397	94399	J. S. Mill	333	" moaned he . "
94449	94450	94451	94451	You	258	" "
94488	94933	94478	94478	you	258	" The ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of replying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being such a convincing argumentum ad verecundiam as she , in her loss of courage at the last moment , meant it to appear . She was beginning to be so puzzling and unstateable that he was ready to throw in with her other little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could make . They proceeded to the schools that morning as usual , Sue entering the class - room , where he could see the back of her head through the glass partition whenever he turned his eyes that way . As he went on giving and hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from concentrated agitation of thought , till at length he tore a scrap from a sheet of scribbling paper and wrote : Your request prevents my attending to work at all . I do n't know what I am doing ! Was it seriously made ? He folded the piece of paper very small , and gave it to a little boy to take to Sue . The child toddled off into the class - room . Phillotson saw his wife turn and take the note , and the bend of her pretty head as she read it , her lips slightly crisped , to prevent undue expression under fire of so many young eyes . He could not see her hands , but she changed her position , and soon the child returned , bringing nothing in reply . In a few minutes , however , one of Sue 's class appeared , with a little note similar to his own . These words only were pencilled therein : I am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made . Phillotson looked more disturbed than before , and the meeting - place of his brows twitched again . In ten minutes he called up the child he had just sent to her , and dispatched another missive : God knows I do n't want to thwart you in any reasonable way . My whole thought is to make you comfortable and happy . But I can not agree to such a preposterous notion as your going to live with your lover . You would lose everybody 's respect and regard ; and so should I ! After an interval a similar part was enacted in the class - room , and an answer came : I know you mean my good . But I do n't want to be respectable ! To produce "
94940	95682	95684	95684	God	177	" to quote your Humboldt is to my mind far above respectability . No doubt my tastes are low - in your view - hopelessly low ! If you won t let me go to him , will you grant me this one request - allow me to live in your house in a separate way ? To this he returned no answer . She wrote again : I know what you think . But can not you have pity on me ? I beg you to ; I implore you to be merciful ! I would not ask if I were not almost compelled by what I ca n't bear ! No poor woman has ever wished more than I that Eve had not fallen , so that as the primitive Christians believed some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled Paradise . But I wo n't trifle ! Be kind to me - even though I have not been kind to you ! I will go away , go abroad , anywhere , and never trouble you . Nearly an hour passed , and then he returned an answer : I do not wish to pain you . How well you KNOW I do n't ! Give me a little time . I am disposed to agree to your last request . One line from her : Thank you from my heart , Richard . I do not deserve your kindness . All day Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed partition ; and he felt as lonely as when he had not known her . But he was as good as his word , and consented to her living apart in the house . At first , when they met at meals , she had seemed more composed under the new arrangement ; but the irksomeness of their position worked on her temperament , and the fibres of her nature seemed strained like harp - strings . She talked vaguely and indiscriminately to prevent his talking pertinently . IV Phillotson was sitting up late , as was often his custom , trying to get together the materials for his long - neglected hobby of Roman antiquities . For the first time since reviving the subject he felt a return of his old interest in it . He forgot time and place , and when he remembered himself and ascended to rest it was nearly two o'clock . His preoccupation was such that , though he now slept on the other side of the house , he mechanically went to the room that he and his wife had occupied when he first became a tenant of Old - Grove Place , which since his differences with Sue had been hers exclusively . He entered , and unconsciously began to undress . There was a cry from the bed , and a quick movement . Before the schoolmaster had realized where he was he perceived Sue starting up half - awake , staring wildly , and springing out upon the floor on the side away from him , which was towards the window . This was somewhat hidden by the canopy of the bedstead , and in a moment he heard her flinging up the sash . Before he had thought that she meant to do more than get air she had mounted upon the sill and leapt out . She disappeared in the darkness , and he heard her fall below . Phillotson , horrified , ran downstairs , striking himself sharply against the newel in his haste . Opening the heavy door he ascended the two or three steps to the level of the ground , and there on the gravel before him lay a white heap . Phillotson seized it in his arms , and bringing Sue into the hall seated her on a chair , where he gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set down in the draught on the bottom stair . She had certainly not broken her neck . She looked at him with eyes that seemed not to take him in ; and though not particularly large in general they appeared so now . She pressed her side and rubbed her arm , as if conscious of pain ; then stood up , averting her face , in evident distress at his gaze . "
95706	95756	95757	95757	I	0	" Her fall , in fact , had not been a serious one , probably owing to the lowness of the old rooms and to the high level of the ground without . Beyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had apparently incurred little harm . "
95764	95777	95761	95761	I	0	" she began , her pale face still turned away from him . "
95793	95829	95789	95789	I	0	" The actual circumstances seemed to come back to her , and she was silent . Her cloak was hanging at the back of the door , and the wretched Phillotson flung it round her . "
95836	95855	95831	95831	I	0	" he asked drearily ; for the significance of all this sickened him of himself and of everything . "
95872	95873	95868	95868	I	0	" "
95881	95892	95874	95874	You	2099	" he mechanically said , as if lecturing in school . "
95902	95903	95904	95904	I	0	" "
95921	96520	95874	95874	You	2099	" The aspect of things was not improved by her admission . She ascended the staircase slowly , the waving light of the candle shining on her . Phillotson did not approach her , or attempt to ascend himself till he heard her enter her room . Then he fastened up the front door , and returning , sat down on the lower stairs , holding the newel with one hand , and bowing his face into the other . Thus he remained for a long long time - a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him ; till , raising his head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that the business of his life must be carried on , whether he had a wife or no , he took the candle and went upstairs to his lonely room on the other side of the landing . No further incident touching the matter between them occurred till the following evening , when , immediately school was over , Phillotson walked out of Shaston , saying he required no tea , and not informing Sue where he was going . He descended from the town level by a steep road in a north - westerly direction , and continued to move downwards till the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay . He was now on the low alluvial beds Where Duncliffe is the traveller 's mark , And cloty Stour 's a - rolling dark . More than once he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening . Against the sky was Shaston , dimly visible On the grey - topp'd height Of Paladore , as pale day wore Away ... William Barnes . The new - lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine as if watching him , one of which windows was his own . Above it he could just discern the pinnacled tower of Trinity Church . The air down here , tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay , was not as it had been above , but soft and relaxing , so that when he had walked a mile or two he was obliged to wipe his face with his handkerchief . Leaving Duncliffe Hill on the left he proceeded without hesitation through the shade , as a man goes on , night or day , in a district over which he has played as a boy . He had walked altogether about four and a half miles Where Stour receives her strength , From six cleere fountains fed , Drayton . when he crossed a tributary of the Stour , and reached Leddenton - a little town of three or four thousand inhabitants - where he went on to the boys ' school , and knocked at the door of the master 's residence . A boy pupil - teacher opened it , and to Phillotson 's inquiry if Mr. Gillingham was at home replied that he was , going at once off to his own house , and leaving Phillotson to find his way in as he could . He discovered his friend putting away some books from which he had been giving evening lessons . The light of the paraffin lamp fell on Phillotson 's face - pale and wretched by contrast with his friend 's , who had a cool , practical look . They had been schoolmates in boyhood , and fellow - students at Wintoncester Training College , many years before this time . "
96539	96557	96529	96529	you	2102	" Phillotson advanced without replying , and Gillingham closed the cupboard and pulled up beside his visitor . "
96621	96647	96614	96614	you	2102	" Though well - trained and even proficient masters , they occasionally used a dialect - word of their boyhood to each other in private . "

98220	98244	98184	98184	I	0	" He went under the stairs , and produced a bottle of cider - wine , of which they drank a rummer each . "
98255	98259	98245	98245	I	0	" he continued . "
98293	98294	98286	98286	she	2160	" "
98320	98356	98312	98312	I	0	" Gillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way , and at parting expressed his hope that this consultation , singular as its subject was , would be the renewal of their old comradeship . "
98361	98379	98312	98312	I	0	" were his last words , flung into the darkness after Phillotson ; from which his friend answered "
98384	98414	98312	98312	I	0	" But when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night , and no sound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour , he said , "
98431	98432	98421	98421	you	1635	" "
98453	98475	98450	98450	I	0	" murmured Gillingham , as he walked back alone . The next morning came , and at breakfast Phillotson told Sue : "
98491	98684	98485	98485	I	0	" Having once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more and more indubitably the true one . His mild serenity at the sense that he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost overpowered his grief at relinquishing her . Some days passed , and the evening of their last meal together had come - a cloudy evening with wind - which indeed was very seldom absent in this elevated place . How permanently it was imprinted upon his vision ; that look of her as she glided into the parlour to tea ; a slim flexible figure ; a face , strained from its roundness , and marked by the pallors of restless days and nights , suggesting tragic possibilities quite at variance with her times of buoyancy ; a trying of this morsel and that , and an inability to eat either . Her nervous manner , begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course , might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that Phillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes that remained . "
98715	98760	98703	98703	You	2163	" She took the slice he helped her to ; and they discussed as they sat trivial questions of housekeeping , such as where he would find the key of this or that cupboard , what little bills were paid , and what not . "
98774	98789	98772	98772	Sue	174	" he said , in a heroic attempt to put her at her ease . "
98848	98849	98851	98851	you	0	" "
98879	98886	98887	98887	I	0	" she said with amenable gentleness . "
98904	98911	98887	98887	I	0	" Phillotson mused , and said : "
98982	98983	98989	98989	Richard	258	" "
99036	99037	99030	99030	Jude	180	" "

99334	99515	99327	99327	you	258	" Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections , and then the station omnibus came round to take her up . Phillotson saw her things put on the top , handed her in , and was obliged to make an appearance of kissing her as he wished her good - bye , which she quite understood and imitated . From the cheerful manner in which they parted the omnibus - man had no other idea than that she was going for a short visit . When Phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened the window in the direction the omnibus had taken . Soon the noise of its wheels died away . He came down then , his face compressed like that of one bearing pain ; he put on his hat and went out , following by the same route for nearly a mile . Suddenly turning round he came home . He had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend Gillingham greeted him from the front room . "
99545	99546	99536	99536	I	0	" "

99609	99634	99607	99607	she	2179	" Phillotson 's throat got choked up , and he could not go on . He turned and pushed the tea - things aside . "
99645	99654	99636	99636	you	2178	" he asked presently in a renewed voice . "
99662	99668	99636	99636	you	2178	" said Gillingham , preoccupied . "

99737	99757	99730	99730	she	2179	" There was a stability , a ballast , in Phillotson 's pronouncement which restrained his friend 's comment . "
99764	99768	99730	99730	she	2179	" he asked . "
99799	99837	99795	99795	you	2182	" Gillingham assented ; and having gone to the upper rooms the schoolmaster opened drawers , and began taking out all Sue 's things that she had left behind , and laying them in a large box . "
99848	99852	99838	99838	She	2179	" he continued . "

99957	99979	99950	99950	I	0	" They went on with the packing silently . When it was done Phillotson closed the box and turned the key . "
99982	99986	99950	99950	I	0	" he said . "
100000	100312	99950	99950	I	0	" V Four - and - twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following note to Jude : It is as I told you ; and I am leaving to - morrow evening . Richard and I thought it could be done with less obtrusiveness after dark . I feel rather frightened , and therefore ask you to be sure you are on the Melchester platform to meet me . I arrive at a little to seven . I know you will , of course , dear Jude ; but I feel so timid that I ca n't help begging you to be punctual . He has been so VERY kind to me through it all ! Now to our meeting ! S. As she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from the mountain town - the single passenger that evening - she regarded the receding road with a sad face . But no hesitation was apparent therein . The up - train by which she was departing stopped by signal only . To Sue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway train should be brought to a stand - still on purpose for her - a fugitive from her lawful home . The twenty minutes ' journey drew towards its close , and Sue began gathering her things together to alight . At the moment that the train came to a stand - still by the Melchester platform a hand was laid on the door and she beheld Jude . He entered the compartment promptly . He had a black bag in his hand , and was dressed in the dark suit he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work . Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow , his ardent affection for her burning in his eyes . "
100316	100342	100314	100314	Jude	180	" She clasped his hand with both hers , and her tense state caused her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs . "

100693	100725	100726	100726	He	2200	" said she , taking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his . But she recovered her equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen miles . "
100736	100740	100726	100726	He	2200	" she resumed . "
100758	100759	100746	100746	I	0	" "
100769	100778	100762	100762	He	2200	" said Jude , glancing at the note . "
100793	100794	100789	100789	he	2200	" "
100823	100828	100813	100813	he	2200	" she answered smiling . "

100913	100917	100905	100905	you	0	" murmured Jude . "
100925	100949	100958	100958	Jude	180	" Jude 's eyes rested musingly on her face . Then he suddenly kissed her ; and was going to kiss her again . "
100960	100961	100958	100958	Jude	180	" "
100967	100974	100958	100958	Jude	180	" he answered ; but acquiesced . "
100984	100991	100992	100992	Arabella	305	" Jude continued after a silence . "

101158	101172	101176	101176	I	0	" she asked , with the discontinuity that marked her to - night . "
101179	101180	101176	101176	I	0	" "
101192	101193	101233	101233	Jude	180	" "

101225	101231	101202	101202	I	0	" She looked at him . "
101235	101247	101202	101202	I	0	" Sue bent her forehead against the corner of the compartment . "
101269	101290	101263	101263	I	0	" In the pause which followed , Jude 's eyes fixed themselves with a stultified expression on the opposite seat . "
101293	101297	101263	101263	I	0	" he said ... "
101300	101322	101263	101263	I	0	" He remained in silence ; and seeing how discomfited he was she put her face against his cheek , murmuring , "
101330	101331	101263	101263	I	0	" "
101340	101344	101263	101263	I	0	" he said . "
101361	101362	101363	101363	You	180	" "
101380	101386	101375	101375	I	0	" she said , smiling . "
101439	101447	101436	101436	you	180	" On reflection his brow showed perplexity . "
101489	101514	101519	101519	my	0	" Even at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid as to the state of that mystery , her heart . "
101522	101529	101519	101519	my	0	" she said with hurried evasiveness ; "
101713	101718	101719	101719	I	0	" He repeated simply ! "
101757	101769	101751	101751	he	2217	" He opened the letter she had brought , and read : "
101843	101844	101835	101835	I	0	" "
101855	101867	101868	101868	He	2217	" she said with latent tears . On reconsideration she added , "
101937	101938	101933	101933	him	2217	" "
101947	101948	101945	101945	you	0	" "

101974	101979	101969	101969	I	0	" he said pettishly . "

102015	102047	101995	101995	I	0	" she said , and drawing away from him as far as she could , looked severely out into the darkness . She added in hurt tones , without turning round : "
102141	102142	102139	102139	Jude	180	" "
102191	102192	102193	102193	I	0	" "

102223	102283	102219	102221	a greedy boy	2232	" He leant back , and did not look at her for a long time . That episode in her past history of which she had told him - of the poor Christminster graduate whom she had handled thus , returned to Jude 's mind ; and he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing destiny . "
102290	102294	102219	102221	a greedy boy	2232	" he murmured . "
102328	102329	102321	102321	you	174	" "
102343	102354	102337	102337	I	0	" she coaxed , turning and moving nearer to him . "
102405	102437	102402	102402	you	174	" He could never resist her when she pleaded as she well knew . And they sat side by side with joined hands , till she aroused herself at some thought . "
102454	102455	102449	102449	your	174	" "
102459	102460	102449	102449	your	174	" "

102696	102716	102688	102688	you	0	" He could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms , and soothed her , saying : "
102746	102747	102732	102732	You	795	" "
102761	102772	102757	102757	you	0	" she said , trying to blink away her tears . "
102802	102973	102974	102974	I	0	" Though so sophisticated in many things she was such a child in others that this satisfied her , and they reached the end of their journey on the best of terms . It was about ten o'clock when they arrived at Aldbrickham , the county town of North Wessex . As she would not go to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram , Jude inquired for another ; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled their luggage to the George farther on , which proved to be the inn at which Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their meeting after their division for years . Owing , however , to their now entering it by another door , and to his preoccupation , he did not at first recognize the place . When they had engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper . During Jude 's temporary absence the waiting - maid spoke to Sue . "
103032	103033	103036	103036	you	936	" "
103038	103049	103036	103036	you	936	" said Sue , with a certain sickness of heart . "
103064	103065	103072	103078	A handsome , full - figured woman	2251	" "
103085	103101	103102	103102	Jude	180	" When Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and miserable . "
103104	103120	103102	103102	Jude	180	" she said to him plaintively , at their parting that night upon the landing , "
103162	103163	103151	103151	I	0	" "
103178	103179	103173	103173	you	180	" "

103217	103224	103213	103213	me	0	" said Jude looking round him . "

103367	103372	103360	103360	We	2259	" he said sadly . "
103380	103381	103378	103378	Sue	174	" "

103510	103535	103496	103496	you	180	" She was so mortified that he was obliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people should hear . "
103579	103580	103572	103572	I	0	" "
103597	103613	103584	103584	she	2271	" Slipping down on her knees Sue buried her face in the bed and wept . "
103632	103636	103637	103637	I	0	" said Jude . "
103648	103649	103653	103653	you	174	" "

103690	103719	103720	103720	I	0	" It was true that he did not understand her feelings very well . But he did a little ; and began to love her none the less . "
103744	103748	103720	103720	I	0	" continued Sue . "
103762	103771	103753	103753	I	0	" said Jude , as distressed as she . "
103783	103784	103773	103773	you	174	" "
103813	103823	103804	103804	you	174	" Looking up from the quilt she pouted provokingly : "

103872	103877	103851	103851	I	0	" said Jude distantly . "

103950	103954	103942	103942	I	0	" said he . "
103995	103996	103998	103998	another	4784	" "
104017	104018	104035	104035	you	174	" "

104112	104122	104099	104099	you	0	" said Sue more gently , as she rose . "
104143	104144	104145	104145	I	0	" "
104159	104163	104150	104150	I	0	" He laughed . "
104167	104171	104150	104150	I	0	" he said . "
104284	104285	104301	104301	they	2289	" "
104305	104318	104301	104301	they	2289	" she solicited , slanting up closer to him as they stood . "
104325	104326	104321	104321	you	0	" "
104333	104338	104341	104341	you	841	" he replied mournfully . "
104408	104409	104406	104406	me	0	" "
104420	104421	104412	104412	you	841	" "
104440	104459	104428	104428	you	841	" She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek ; and he did as commanded . "
104481	104482	104485	104485	sweet	2297	" "
104487	104789	104485	104485	sweet	2297	" he said with a sigh ; and bade her good - night . VI In returning to his native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson had won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants , who , though they did not honour him for his miscellaneous aquirements as he would have been honoured elsewhere , retained for him a sincere regard . When , shortly after his arrival , he brought home a pretty wife - awkwardly pretty for him , if he did not take care , they said - they were glad to have her settle among them . For some time after her flight from that home Sue 's absence did not excite comment . Her place as monitor in the school was taken by another young woman within a few days of her vacating it , which substitution also passed without remark , Sue 's services having been of a provisional nature only . When , however , a month had passed , and Phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know where his wife was staying , curiosity began to be aroused ; till , jumping to conclusions , people ventured to affirm that Sue had played him false and run away from him . The schoolmaster 's growing languor and listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea . Though Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could , except to his friend Gillingham , his honesty and directness would not allow him to do so when misapprehensions as to Sue 's conduct spread abroad . On a Monday morning the chairman of the school committee called , and after attending to the business of the school drew Phillotson aside out of earshot of the children . "
104841	104842	104836	104836	I	0	" "
104846	104850	104836	104836	I	0	" said Phillotson . "
104858	104859	104860	104860	She	967	" "
104867	104868	104860	104860	She	967	" "
104871	104872	104860	104860	She	967	" "
104878	104879	104880	104880	She	967	" "
104901	104914	104896	104896	I	0	" The chairman looked as if he had not apprehended the remark . "
104922	104927	104916	104916	I	0	" Phillotson continued testily . "
104988	105138	105144	105144	you	2307	" The children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of the two men , and went home and told their parents that something new had happened about Mrs. Phillotson . Then Phillotson 's little maidservant , who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards , said that Mr. Phillotson had helped in his wife 's packing , had offered her what money she required , and had written a friendly letter to her young man , telling him to take care of her . The chairman of committee thought the matter over , and talked to the other managers of the school , till a request came to Phillotson to meet them privately . The meeting lasted a long time , and at the end the school - master came home , looking as usual pale and worn . Gillingham was sitting in his house awaiting him . "
105147	105159	105144	105144	you	2307	" observed Phillotson , flinging himself down wearily in a chair . "
105200	105201	105204	105204	I	0	" "
105207	105208	105204	105204	I	0	" "
105240	105241	105232	105232	They	2308	" "
105312	105325	105305	105305	You	0	" To this good advice , however , Phillotson would not listen . "
105331	105335	105326	105326	I	0	" he said . "
105391	105744	105386	105386	I	0	" Gillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to maintain such a position as this ; but he said nothing further , and in due time - indeed , in a quarter of an hour - the formal letter of dismissal arrived , the managers having remained behind to write it after Phillotson 's withdrawal . The latter replied that he should not accept dismissal ; and called a public meeting , which he attended , although he looked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to stay at home . When he stood up to give his reasons for contesting the decision of the managers he advanced them firmly , as he had done to his friend , and contended , moreover , that the matter was a domestic theory which did not concern them . This they over - ruled , insisting that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite within their sphere of control , as it touched the morals of those he taught . Phillotson replied that he did not see how an act of natural charity could injure morals . All the respectable inhabitants and well - to - do fellow - natives of the town were against Phillotson to a man . But , somewhat to his surprise , some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from the ground . It has been stated that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and interesting group of itinerants , who frequented the numerous fairs and markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn months . Although Phillotson had never spoken to one of these gentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence . The body included two cheap Jacks , a shooting - gallery proprietor and the ladies who loaded the guns , a pair of boxing - masters , a steam - roundabout manager , two travelling broom - makers , who called themselves widows , a gingerbread - stall keeper , a swing - boat owner , and a "
105750	106021	106022	106022	She	2315	" man . This generous phalanx of supporters , and a few others of independent judgment , whose own domestic experiences had been not without vicissitude , came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson ; after which they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that issue was joined , the result being a general scuffle , wherein a black board was split , three panes of the school windows were broken , an inkbottle was spilled over a town - councillor 's shirt front , a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine that his head went right through Samaria , and many black eyes and bleeding noses were given , one of which , to everybody 's horror , was the venerable incumbent 's , owing to the zeal of an emancipated chimney - sweep , who took the side of Phillotson 's party . When Phillotson saw the blood running down the rector 's face he deplored almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances , regretted that he had not resigned when called upon , and went home so ill that next morning he could not leave his bed . The farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious illness for him ; and he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state of mind of a middle - aged man who perceives at length that his life , intellectual and domestic , is tending to failure and gloom . Gillingham came to see him in the evenings , and on one occasion mentioned Sue 's name . "
106030	106034	106037	106037	she	2315	" said Phillotson . "
106039	106040	106037	106037	she	2315	" "
106049	106050	106041	106041	She	2315	" "
106060	106061	106041	106041	She	2315	" "
106070	106071	106067	106067	she	2315	" "
106088	106293	106080	106080	he	4279	" When Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected , and at last wrote an anonymous line to Sue , on the bare chance of its reaching her , the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the diocesan capital . Arriving at that place it was forwarded to Marygreen in North Wessex , and thence to Aldbrickham by the only person who knew his present address - the widow who had nursed his aunt . Three days later , in the evening , when the sun was going down in splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor , and making the Shaston windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale , the sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house , and a few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door . Phillotson did not speak ; the door was hesitatingly opened , and there entered - Sue . She was in light spring clothing , and her advent seemed ghostly - like the flitting in of a moth . He turned his eyes upon her , and flushed ; but appeared to check his primary impulse to speak . "
106300	106311	106294	106294	I	0	" she said , bending her frightened face to him . "
106345	106346	106347	106347	I	0	" "
106360	106361	106362	106362	I	0	" "

106473	106590	106454	106455	The managers	420	" Sue did not for a moment , either now or later , suspect what troubles had resulted to him from letting her go ; it never once seemed to cross her mind , and she had received no news whatever from Shaston . They talked on slight and ephemeral subjects , and when his tea was brought up he told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set for Sue . That young person was much more interested in their history than they supposed , and as she descended the stairs she lifted her eyes and hands in grotesque amazement . While they sipped Sue went to the window and thoughtfully said , "
106600	106601	106598	106598	Richard	258	" "

106694	106739	106691	106691	I	0	" She went to where a swing - glass stood , and taking it in her hands carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine , moving the glass till the beams were reflected into Phillotson 's face . "
106751	106755	106742	106742	you	258	" she said . "
106772	106797	106798	106798	You	0	" She spoke with a childlike , repentant kindness , as if she could not do too much for him . Phillotson smiled sadly . "
106804	106815	106800	106802	an odd creature	2331	" he murmured as the sun glowed in his eyes . "
106829	106830	106800	106802	an odd creature	2331	" "
106840	106845	106800	106802	an odd creature	2331	" she said quickly . "
106910	106911	106900	106900	You	258	" "
106921	106926	106912	106912	I	0	" said Phillotson huskily . "
106935	106993	106994	106994	Sue	174	" It grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent chat , and when candles were brought and it was time to leave she put her hand in his or rather allowed it to flit through his ; for she was significantly light in touch . She had nearly closed the door when he said , "
106996	107047	107048	107048	Sue	174	" He had noticed that , in turning away from him , tears were on her face and a quiver in her lip . It was bad policy to recall her - he knew it while he pursued it . But he could not help it . She came back . "
107050	107054	107056	107056	you	174	" he murmured , "
107074	107075	107077	107077	you	0	" "
107085	107090	107081	107081	you	0	" she said hastily . "
107098	107099	107091	107091	You	0	" "
107115	107116	107117	107117	You	0	" "

107275	107312	107313	107313	I	0	" There had arisen in Sue 's face that incipient fright which showed itself whenever he changed from friend to husband , and which made her adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him . "
107326	107327	107328	107328	I	0	" "
107345	107346	107339	107339	I	0	" "

107383	107597	107373	107373	She	2343	" said Phillotson ; but so faintly that in closing the door she did not hear it . The dread of a reactionary change in the schoolmaster 's sentiments , coupled , perhaps , with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know what a slipshod lack of thoroughness , from a man 's point of view , characterized her transferred allegiance , prevented her telling him of her , thus far , incomplete relations with Jude ; and Phillotson lay writhing like a man in hell as he pictured the prettily dressed , maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name , returning impatiently to the home of her lover . Gillingham was so interested in Phillotson 's affairs , and so seriously concerned about him , that he walked up the hill - side to Shaston two or three times a week , although , there and back , it was a journey of nine miles , which had to be performed between tea and supper , after a hard day 's work in school . When he called on the next occasion after Sue 's visit his friend was downstairs , and Gillingham noticed that his restless mood had been supplanted by a more fixed and composed one . "
107607	107611	107598	107598	She	2344	" said Phillotson . "

108141	108149	108150	108150	I	0	" Gillingham did not hurry to reply . "
108157	108171	108150	108150	I	0	" he said gently , for he respected views he could not share . "
108198	108205	108206	108206	Thy	2360	" Part Fifth AT ALDBRICKHAM AND ELSEWHERE "
108252	108454	108239	108239	they	2361	" - M. ANTONINUS Long . I How Gillingham 's doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by passing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed the events of the last chapter , and coming on to a Sunday in the February of the year following . Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham , in precisely the same relations that they had established between themselves when she left Shaston to join him the year before . The proceedings in the law - courts had reached their consciousness , but as a distant sound and an occasional missive which they hardly understood . They had met , as usual , to breakfast together in the little house with Jude 's name on it , that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year , with three - pounds - ten extra for rates and taxes , and furnished with his aunt 's ancient and lumbering goods , which had cost him about their full value to bring all the way from Marygreen . Sue kept house , and managed everything . As he entered the room this morning Sue held up a letter she had just received . "
108463	108470	108239	108239	they	2361	" he said after kissing her . "
108496	108497	108239	108239	they	2361	" "
108500	108554	108239	108239	they	2361	" said Jude , as he sat down . The same concluding incident in Jude 's suit against Arabella had occurred about a month or two earlier . Both cases had been too insignificant to be reported in the papers , further than by name in a long list of other undefended cases . "
108571	108579	108558	108558	Sue	174	" He looked at his sweetheart curiously . "
108600	108601	108558	108558	Sue	174	" "
108630	108631	108612	108613	a clergyman	2363	" "

108749	108754	108755	108755	Jude	180	" he said mischievously . "
108778	108779	108770	108770	You	180	" "
108818	108819	108825	108825	their	2365	" "

108943	109021	108912	108912	nobody	4069	" By degrees Sue acquired her lover 's cheerfulness at the sense of freedom , and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields , even if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it . Jude agreed , and Sue went up - stairs and prepared to start , putting on a joyful coloured gown in observance of her liberty ; seeing which Jude put on a lighter tie . "
109030	109034	108912	108912	nobody	4069	" he said , "
109048	109110	109041	109041	We	2362	" They rambled out of the town , and along a path over the low - lying lands that bordered it , though these were frosty now , and the extensive seed - fields were bare of colour and produce . The pair , however , were so absorbed in their own situation that their surroundings were little in their consciousness . "
109131	109132	109135	109135	I	0	" "
109140	109147	109135	109135	I	0	" said Sue , without enthusiasm . "

109319	109326	109316	109316	I	0	" said he with some gloom ; "
109346	109347	109350	109352	two dissatisfied ones	2378	" "
109431	109432	109440	109440	I	0	" "
109444	109458	109440	109440	I	0	" he expostulated ; yet there was misgiving in his own voice also . "
109610	109611	109640	109642	dear little Sue	174	" "
109776	109777	109756	109756	you	2393	" "
109780	109784	109785	109785	you	2393	" she sighed , "
109855	109891	109892	109892	I	0	" Jude fell back upon his old complaint - that , intimate as they were , he had never once had from her an honest , candid declaration that she loved or could love him . "
109901	109911	109892	109892	I	0	" he said , with a dubiousness approaching anger . "
110060	110084	110085	110085	I	0	" Sue , who was regarding the distance , had acquired a guilty look ; and she suddenly replied in a tragic voice : "
110103	110104	110101	110101	Jude	180	" "
110111	110112	110101	110101	Jude	180	" "
110143	110144	110147	110147	you	2414	" "
110173	110174	110164	110164	I	0	" "
110255	110256	110257	110257	Sue	174	" "
110349	110487	110488	110489	Jude Fawley	180	" After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for several days , though living as they were with only a landing between them it was constantly in their minds . Sue was assisting Jude very materially now : he had latterly occupied himself on his own account in working and lettering headstones , which he kept in a little yard at the back of his little house , where in the intervals of domestic duties she marked out the letters full size for him , and blacked them in after he had cut them . It was a lower class of handicraft than were his former performances as a cathedral mason , and his only patrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood , and knew what a cheap man this "
110493	110635	110491	110492	Monumental Mason	2424	" as he called himself on his front door was to employ for the simple memorials they required for their dead . But he seemed more independent than before , and it was the only arrangement under which Sue , who particularly wished to be no burden on him , could render any assistance . II It was an evening at the end of the month , and Jude had just returned home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not far off . When he entered , Sue , who had been keeping indoors during his absence , laid out supper for him . Contrary to custom she did not speak . Jude had taken up some illustrated paper , which he perused till , raising his eyes , he saw that her face was troubled . "
110642	110651	110640	110640	Sue	174	" he said . She paused a moment . "
110659	110663	110652	110652	I	0	" she answered . "
110668	110669	110672	110673	A woman	4193	" "
110675	110706	110672	110673	A woman	4193	" Sue 's voice quavered as she spoke , and she suddenly sat down from her preparations , laid her hands in her lap , and looked into the fire . "
110718	110722	110723	110723	I	0	" she continued . "
110752	110753	110739	110739	I	0	" "
110774	110775	110770	110770	she	4193	" "
110801	110810	110795	110795	you	2426	" Sue looked critically and imploringly at him . "
110821	110822	110818	110818	she	4193	" "
110848	110849	110846	110846	Arabella	305	" "
110868	110869	110866	110866	she	305	" "
110910	110911	110902	110902	She	4193	" "
110953	110954	110944	110944	She	305	" "
110965	110966	110962	110962	she	305	" "
111004	111005	110999	110999	she	305	" "
111020	111021	111014	111014	you	2426	" "
111055	111056	111039	111039	She	305	" "
111067	111078	111065	111065	Arabella	305	" cried Sue , covering her eyes with her hand . "
111109	111110	111107	111107	you	180	" "
111153	111154	111146	111146	she	305	" "
111164	111233	111158	111158	she	305	" Sue , whom the least thing upset , could not eat any supper , and when Jude had finished his he prepared to go to bed . He had no sooner raked out the fire , fastened the doors , and got to the top of the stairs than there came a knock . Sue instantly emerged from her room , which she had but just entered . "
111239	111246	111235	111235	she	305	" Sue whispered in appalled accents . "
111252	111253	111254	111254	She	305	" "
111261	111299	111254	111254	She	305	" They listened , and the knocking came again . No servant was kept in the house , and if the summons were to be responded to one of them would have to do it in person . "
111306	111310	111300	111300	I	0	" said Jude . "
111326	111372	111311	111313	Whoever it is	2437	" He accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash . The lonely street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of one figure - that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few yards off . "
111377	111381	111311	111313	Whoever it is	2437	" he asked . "
111387	111409	111412	111412	she	305	" came up from the woman , in a voice which was unmistakably Arabella 's . Jude replied that it was . "
111414	111425	111412	111412	she	305	" asked Sue from the door , with lips apart . "
111430	111434	111412	111412	she	305	" said Jude . "
111442	111446	111437	111437	you	795	" he inquired . "
111458	111463	111452	111452	Jude	180	" said Arabella humbly . "
111495	111496	111501	111501	you	2439	" "
111503	111504	111501	111501	you	2439	" "
111507	111528	111501	111501	you	2439	" There was a silence . An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in Jude 's breast at the appeal . "
111535	111542	111545	111545	Jude	180	" he said . Arabella hesitated . "
111551	111555	111556	111556	He	2441	" she returned . "
111627	111645	111619	111619	I	0	" Sue remained at gaze , in painful tension , hearing every word , but speaking none . "
111657	111667	111655	111655	Arabella	305	" he asked , in a distinctly softened tone . "
111691	111692	111655	111655	Arabella	305	" "
111698	111699	111695	111695	you	0	" "
111704	111717	111718	111718	I	0	" She was about to give the address , but she said , "
111780	111781	111769	111769	You	180	" "
111801	111808	111798	111798	I	0	" said Jude in much perplexity . "
111824	111825	111798	111798	I	0	" "
111846	111855	111844	111844	Jude	180	" came in plaintive accents from the doorway . "
111905	111911	111913	111913	Jude	180	" But I shall go , "
111915	111945	111946	111946	He	180	" Do n't attempt to detain me , Sue . God knows I love her little enough now , but I do n't want to be cruel to her . "
111952	111960	111962	111962	Sue	174	" But she 's not your wife ! "
111965	111969	111962	111962	Sue	174	" And I - "
111970	111981	111983	111983	Jude	180	" And you are not either , dear , yet , "
111985	112028	111983	111983	Jude	180	" Oh , but are you going to her ? Do n't ! Stay at home ! Please , please stay at home , Jude , and not go to her , now she 's not your wife any more than I ! "
112029	112044	112045	112045	he	180	" Well , she is , rather more than you , come to that , "
112053	112113	112045	112045	he	180	" I 've wanted you to be , and I 've waited with the patience of Job , and I do n't see that I 've got anything by my self - denial . I shall certainly give her something , and hear what it is she is so anxious to tell me ; no man could do less ! "
112333	112349	112351	112351	she	174	" Oh , I knew I could trust you ! - how good you are ! "
112354	112412	112351	112351	she	174	" I ca n't find her anywhere in this street , and I went out in my slippers only . She has walked on , thinking I 've been so hard - hearted as to refuse her requests entirely , poor woman . I 've come back for my boots , as it is beginning to rain . "
112413	112433	112435	112435	Sue	174	" Oh , but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served you so badly ! "
112443	112471	112435	112435	Sue	174	" But , Sue , she 's a woman , and I once cared for her ; and one ca n't be a brute in such circumstances . "
112472	112481	112483	112483	Sue	174	" She is n't your wife any longer ! "
112488	112529	112483	112483	Sue	174	" You MUSTN'T go out to find her ! It is n't right ! You CAN'T join her , now she 's a stranger to you . How can you forget such a thing , my dear , dear one ! "
112530	112549	112550	112550	he	2458	" She seems much the same as ever - an erring , careless , unreflecting fellow - creature , "
112560	112601	112550	112550	he	2458	" What those legal fellows have been playing at in London makes no difference in my real relations to her . If she was my wife while she was away in Australia with another husband she 's my wife now . "
112602	112660	112483	112483	Sue	174	" But she was n't ! That 's just what I hold ! There 's the absurdity ! - Well - you 'll come straight back , after a few minutes , wo n't you , dear ? She is too low , too coarse for you to talk to long , Jude , and was always ! "
112661	112892	112483	112483	Sue	174	" Perhaps I am coarse too , worse luck ! I have the germs of every human infirmity in me , I verily believe - that was why I saw it was so preposterous of me to think of being a curate . I have cured myself of drunkenness I think ; but I never know in what new form a suppressed vice will break out in me ! I do love you , Sue , though I have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns ! All that 's best and noblest in me loves you , and your freedom from everything that 's gross has elevated me , and enabled me to do what I should never have dreamt myself capable of , or any man , a year or two ago . It is all very well to preach about self - control , and the wickedness of coercing a woman . But I should just like a few virtuous people who have condemned me in the past , about Arabella and other things , to have been in my tantalizing position with you through these late weeks ! - they 'd believe , I think , that I have exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your wishes - living here in one house , and not a soul between us . "
112893	112914	112550	112550	he	2458	" Yes , you have been good to me , Jude ; I know you have , my dear protector . "
112915	112940	112483	112483	Sue	174	" Well - Arabella has appealed to me for help . I must go out and speak to her , Sue , at least ! "
112941	112959	112960	112960	she	2459	" I ca n't say any more ! - Oh , if you must , you must ! "
112974	113017	112960	112960	she	2459	" I have nobody but you , Jude , and you are deserting me ! I did n't know you were like this - I ca n't bear it , I ca n't ! If she were yours it would be different ! "
113018	113024	112483	112483	Sue	174	" Or if you were . "
113025	113102	113103	113103	She	2460	" Very well then - if I must I must . Since you will have it so , I agree ! I will be . Only I did n't mean to ! And I did n't want to marry again , either ! ... But , yes - I agree , I agree ! I do love you . I ought to have known that you would conquer in the long run , living like this ! "
113114	113164	113103	113103	She	2460	" I am not a cold - natured , sexless creature , am I , for keeping you at such a distance ? I am sure you do n't think so ! Wait and see ! I do belong to you , do n't I ? I give in ! "
113165	113185	113108	113108	her	2460	" And I 'll arrange for our marriage to - morrow , or as soon as ever you wish . "
113186	113191	113103	113103	She	2460	" Yes , Jude . "
113192	113200	113202	113202	he	2461	" Then I 'll let her go , "
113208	113265	113202	113202	he	2461	" I do feel that it would be unfair to you to see her , and perhaps unfair to her . She is not like you , my darling , and never was : it is only bare justice to say that . Do n't cry any more . There ; and there ; and there ! "
113296	113301	113303	113303	Jude	180	" Now , dear , "
113308	113354	113303	113303	Jude	180	" as this is Saturday I mean to call about the banns at once , so as to get the first publishing done to - morrow , or we shall lose a week . Banns will do ? We shall save a pound or two . "
113388	113398	113399	113399	she	174	" I feel I was wickedly selfish last night ! "
113402	113504	113399	113399	she	174	" It was sheer unkindness in me - or worse - to treat Arabella as I did . I did n't care about her being in trouble , and what she wished to tell you ! Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling you . That 's some more of my badness , I suppose ! Love has its own dark morality when rivalry enters in - at least , mine has , if other people 's has n't ... I wonder how she got on ? I hope she reached the inn all right , poor woman . "
113505	113515	113517	113517	Jude	180	" Oh yes : she got on all right , "
113520	113569	113517	113517	Jude	180	" I hope she was n't shut out , and that she had n't to walk the streets in the rain . Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in ? I 've been thinking of her all the morning . "
113570	113606	113399	113399	she	174	" Well - is it necessary ? You have n't the least idea how Arabella is able to shift for herself . Still , darling , if you want to go and inquire you can . "
113669	113676	113677	113677	he	2465	" And when you come back , "
113680	113697	113698	113698	Sue	174	" I 'll be ready to go about the banns . You 'll come with me ? "
113732	113741	113742	113742	she	174	" The little bird is caught at last ! "
113752	113758	113759	113759	he	2465	" No - only nested , "
113883	113891	113877	113877	Arabella	305	" Come in and shut the door , "
114000	114020	114021	114021	she	174	" I 've just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night , that 's all , "
114025	114039	114021	114021	she	174	" I was afraid afterwards that you might have met with any mishap ? "
114040	114070	114072	114072	Arabella	305	" Oh - how stupid this is ! I thought my visitor was - your friend - your husband - Mrs. Fawley , as I suppose you call yourself ? "
114101	114107	114109	114109	Sue	174	" Indeed I do n't , "
114111	114140	114109	114109	Sue	174	" Oh , I thought you might have , even if he 's not really yours . Decency is decency , any hour of the twenty - four . "
114141	114150	114152	114152	Sue	174	" I do n't know what you mean , "
114155	114166	114152	114152	Sue	174	" He is mine , if you come to that ! "
114167	114173	114174	114174	Sue	174	" He was n't yesterday . "
114181	114187	114174	114174	Sue	174	" How do you know ? "
114188	114240	114241	114241	Sue	174	" From your manner when you talked to me at the door . Well , my dear , you 've been quick about it , and I expect my visit last night helped it on - ha - ha ! But I do n't want to get him away from you . "
114308	114312	114301	114302	the chambermaid	2475	" Mrs. Cartlett . "
114326	114339	114340	114340	she	305	" I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me , "
114349	114404	114340	114340	she	305	" but it is not necessary you should feel it . My man finds he ca n't do without me after all , and agrees to stand by the promise to marry again over here that he has made me all along . See here ! This is in answer to one from me . "
114422	114515	114416	114416	Sue	174	" He asks me to come back . His little corner public in Lambeth would go to pieces without me , he says . But he is n't going to knock me about when he has had a drop , any more after we are spliced by English law than before ! ... As for you , I should coax Jude to take me before the parson straight off , and have done with it , if I were in your place . I say it as a friend , my dear . "
114516	114525	114527	114527	Sue	174	" He 's waiting to , any day , "
114533	114732	114733	114733	she	2477	" Then let him , in Heaven 's name . Life with a man is more businesslike after it , and money matters work better . And then , you see , if you have rows , and he turns you out of doors , you can get the law to protect you , which you ca n't otherwise , unless he half - runs you through with a knife , or cracks your noddle with a poker . And if he bolts away from you - I say it friendly , as woman to woman , for there 's never any knowing what a man med do - you 'll have the sticks o ' furniture , and wo n't be looked upon as a thief . I shall marry my man over again , now he 's willing , as there was a little flaw in the first ceremony . In my telegram last night which this is an answer to , I told him I had almost made it up with Jude ; and that frightened him , I expect ! Perhaps I should quite have done it if it had n't been for you , "
114737	114843	114733	114733	she	2477	" and then how different our histories might have been from to - day ! Never such a tender fool as Jude is if a woman seems in trouble , and coaxes him a bit ! Just as he used to be about birds and things . However , as it happens , it is just as well as if I had made it up , and I forgive you . And , as I say , I 'd advise you to get the business legally done as soon as possible . You 'll find it an awful bother later on if you do n't . "
114844	114866	114868	114868	Sue	174	" I have told you he is asking me to marry him - to make our natural marriage a legal one , "
114875	114892	114868	114868	Sue	174	" It was quite by my wish that he did n't the moment I was free . "
114893	114907	114909	114909	Arabella	305	" Ah , yes - you are a oneyer too , like myself , "
114918	114931	114909	114909	Arabella	305	" Bolted from your first , did n't you , like me ? "
114932	114941	114943	114943	Sue	174	" Good morning ! - I must go , "
114946	114957	114959	114960	the other	4340	" And I , too , must up and off ! "
114983	115006	115007	115007	she	305	" Lord , I am only a woman - not a six - foot sojer ! ... Just a moment , dear , "
115018	115092	115007	115007	she	305	" I really did want to consult Jude on a little matter of business , as I told him . I came about that more than anything else . Would he run up to speak to me at the station as I am going ? You think not . Well , I 'll write to him about it . I did n't want to write it , but never mind - I will . "
115147	115158	115159	115159	she	174	" Oh Jude - I 've been talking to her , "
115164	115182	115159	115159	she	174	" I wish I had n't ! And yet it is best to be reminded of things . "
115183	115190	115134	115134	He	180	" I hope she was civil . "
115191	115227	115228	115228	She	174	" Yes . I - I ca n't help liking her - just a little bit ! She 's not an ungenerous nature ; and I am so glad her difficulties have all suddenly ended . "
115246	115312	115228	115228	She	174	" I was referring to our old question . What Arabella has been saying to me has made me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage is - a sort of trap to catch a man - I ca n't bear to think of it . I wish I had n't promised to let you put up the banns this morning ! "
115313	115341	115134	115134	He	180	" Oh , do n't mind me . Any time will do for me . I thought you might like to get it over quickly , now . "
115342	115452	115228	115228	She	174	" Indeed , I do n't feel any more anxious now than I did before . Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious ; but among the very few virtues possessed by your family and mine , dear , I think I may set staunchness . So I am not a bit frightened about losing you , now I really am yours and you really are mine . In fact , I am easier in my mind than I was , for my conscience is clear about Richard , who now has a right to his freedom . I felt we were deceiving him before . "
115453	115567	115568	115568	They	2483	" Sue , you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some grand old civilization , whom I used to read about in my bygone , wasted , classical days , rather than a denizen of a mere Christian country . I almost expect you to say at these times that you have just been talking to some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra , about the latest news of Octavia or Livia ; or have been listening to Aspasia 's eloquence , or have been watching Praxiteles chiselling away at his latest Venus , while Phryne made complaint that she was tired of posing . "
115602	115605	115599	115599	she	174	" Jude ! "
115610	115619	115606	115606	He	4279	" Wait a minute , would you mind ? "
115626	115632	115633	115633	she	174	" Just let us think , "
115637	115651	115633	115633	she	174	" I had such a horrid dream one night ! ... And Arabella - "
115652	115660	115661	115661	he	4279	" What did Arabella say to you ? "
115664	115775	115661	115661	he	4279	" Oh , she said that when people were tied up you could get the law of a man better if he beat you - and how when couples quarrelled ... Jude , do you think that when you must have me with you by law , we shall be so happy as we are now ? The men and women of our family are very generous when everything depends upon their goodwill , but they always kick against compulsion . Do n't you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation ? Do n't you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its gratuitousness ? "
115776	115808	115809	115809	Her	2487	" Upon my word , love , you are beginning to frighten me , too , with all this foreboding ! Well , let 's go back and think it over . "
115813	115820	115822	115822	she	2487	" Yes - so we will ! "
116008	116011	116013	116013	she	174	" Look ! "
116055	116059	116177	116177	he	180	" CARTLETT - DONN "
116072	116079	116081	116081	Sue	174	" Well , it is satisfactory , "
116084	116162	116081	116081	Sue	174	" Though , after this , it seems rather low to do likewise , and I am glad . However , she is provided for now in a way , I suppose , whatever her faults , poor thing . It is nicer that we are able to think that , than to be uneasy about her . I ought , too , to write to Richard and ask him how he is getting on , perhaps ? "
116184	116197	116177	116177	he	180	" Listen to this letter . What shall I say or do ? "
116677	116685	116686	116686	she	174	" What will you do , dear ? "
116705	116711	116713	116713	he	180	" It hits me hard ! "
116720	116807	116713	116713	he	180	" It MAY be true ! I ca n't make it out . Certainly , if his birth was exactly when she says , he 's mine . I can not think why she did n't tell me when I met her at Christminster , and came on here that evening with her ! ... Ah - I do remember now that she said something about having a thing on her mind that she would like me to know , if ever we lived together again . "
116808	116819	116820	116820	Sue	174	" The poor child seems to be wanted by nobody ! "
116837	116852	116853	116853	he	180	" What a view of life he must have , mine or not mine ! "
116856	116999	116853	116853	he	180	" I must say that , if I were better off , I should not stop for a moment to think whose he might be . I would take him and bring him up . The beggarly question of parentage - what is it , after all ? What does it matter , when you come to think of it , whether a child is yours by blood or not ? All the little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of the time , and entitled to our general care . That excessive regard of parents for their own children , and their dislike of other people 's , is , like class - feeling , patriotism , save - your - own - soul - ism , and other virtues , a mean exclusiveness at bottom . "
117010	117076	117000	117000	Sue	174	" Yes - so it is , dearest ! And we 'll have him here ! And if he is n't yours it makes it all the better . I do hope he is n't - though perhaps I ought not to feel quite that ! If he is n't , I should like so much for us to have him as an adopted child ! "
117077	117097	117098	117098	he	180	" Well , you must assume about him what is most pleasing to you , my curious little comrade ! "
117101	117209	117098	117098	he	180	" I feel that , anyhow , I do n't like to leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect . Just think of his life in a Lambeth pothouse , and all its evil influences , with a parent who does n't want him , and has , indeed , hardly seen him , and a stepfather who does n't know him . ' Let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived ! ' That 's what the boy - MY boy , perhaps , will find himself saying before long ! "
117210	117214	117000	117000	Sue	174	" Oh no ! "
117215	117233	117000	117000	Sue	174	" As I was the petitioner , I am really entitled to his custody , I suppose . "
117234	117283	117098	117098	he	180	" Whether or no , we must have him . I see that . I 'll do the best I can to be a mother to him , and we can afford to keep him somehow . I 'll work harder . I wonder when he 'll arrive ? "
117284	117296	117000	117000	Sue	174	" In the course of a few weeks , I suppose . "
117297	117311	117000	117000	Sue	174	" I wish - When shall we have courage to marry , Jude ? "
117312	117341	117098	117098	he	180	" Whenever you have it , I think I shall . It remains with you entirely , dear . Only say the word , and it 's done . "
117342	117348	117000	117000	Sue	174	" Before the boy comes ? "
117349	117352	117000	117000	Sue	174	" Certainly . "
117353	117366	117367	117367	she	2513	" It would make a more natural home for him , perhaps , "
117651	117670	117642	117642	his	2518	" All laughing comes from misapprehension . Rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun . "
117688	117703	117675	117676	the guard	2527	" All right , my man . Your box is safe in the van . "
117709	117712	117704	117705	The boy	437	" Yes , "
118025	118037	118010	118010	Arabella	356	" You are very much what I expected you to be , "
118129	118135	118137	118139	the little one	2554	" Going to Spring Street , "
118142	118168	118137	118139	the little one	2554	" Why , that 's a long way from here ; a'most out in the country ; and the folks will be gone to bed . "
118169	118177	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" I 've got to go there . "
118178	118188	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" You must have a fly for your box . "
118189	118196	118137	118139	the little one	2554	" No . I must walk . "
118197	118232	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" Oh well : you 'd better leave your box here and send for it . There 's a ' bus goes half - way , but you 'll have to walk the rest . "
118233	118239	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" I am not afraid . "
118240	118252	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" Why did n't your friends come to meet ' ee ? "
118253	118264	118137	118139	the little one	2554	" I suppose they did n't know I was coming . "
118265	118271	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" Who is your friends ? "
118272	118281	118098	118099	The collector	2553	" Mother did n't wish me to say . "
118282	118305	118137	118139	the little one	2554	" All I can do , then , is to take charge of this . Now walk as fast as you can . "
118556	118563	118565	118566	the child	3918	" Is this where Father lives ? "
118568	118571	118548	118548	she	174	" Who ? "
118572	118581	118582	118582	Sue	174	" Mr. Fawley , that 's his name . "
118611	118621	118622	118622	she	174	" What - is it he - so soon ? "
118735	118741	118719	118719	He	180	" What 's the matter ? "
118742	118757	118719	118719	He	180	" What Arabella says is true - true ! I see you in him ! "
118758	118777	118719	118719	He	180	" Well : that 's one thing in my life as it should be , at any rate . "
118778	118817	118719	118719	He	180	" But the other half of him is - SHE ! And that 's what I ca n't bear ! But I ought to - I 'll try to get used to it ; yes , I ought ! "
118818	118892	118719	118719	He	180	" Jealous little Sue ! I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness . Never mind ! Time may right things ... And Sue , darling ; I have an idea ! We 'll educate and train him with a view to the university . What I could n't accomplish in my own person perhaps I can carry out through him ? They are making it easier for poor students now , you know . "
118893	118898	118900	118900	she	2582	" Oh you dreamer ! "
118925	118937	118938	118938	he	437	" Is it you who 's my REAL mother at last ? "
118941	118953	118938	118938	he	437	" Why ? Do I look like your father 's wife ? "
118954	118978	118919	118919	she	2582	" Well , yes ; ' cept he seems fond of you , and you of him . Can I call you Mother ? "
119030	119046	119047	119047	she	174	" You may call me Mother , if you wish to , my poor dear ! "
119060	119068	119070	119070	Jude	180	" What 's this round your neck ? "
119075	119087	119070	119070	Jude	180	" The key of my box that 's at the station . "
119121	119135	119137	119137	Jude	180	" He called you Mother two or three times before he dropped off , "
119139	119151	119137	119137	Jude	180	" Was n't it odd that he should have wanted to ! "
119152	119159	119161	119161	Sue	174	" Well - it was significant , "
119163	119272	119161	119161	Sue	174	" There 's more for us to think about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky ... I suppose , dear , we must pluck up courage , and get that ceremony over ? It is no use struggling against the current , and I feel myself getting intertwined with my kind . Oh Jude , you 'll love me dearly , wo n't you , afterwards ! I do want to be kind to this child , and to be a mother to him ; and our adding the legal form to our marriage might make it easier for me . "
119336	119347	119349	119349	Sue	174	" His face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene , "
119351	119364	119349	119349	Sue	174	" What is your name , dear ? Did you tell us ? "
119365	119390	119302	119302	Him	2590	" Little Father Time is what they always called me . It is a nickname ; because I look so aged , they say . "
119391	119399	119401	119401	Sue	174	" And you talk so , too , "
119404	119429	119401	119401	Sue	174	" It is strange , Jude , that these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new countries . But what were you christened ? "
119430	119435	119302	119302	Him	2590	" I never was . "
119436	119441	119302	119302	Him	2590	" Why was that ? "
119442	119461	119401	119401	Sue	174	" Because , if I died in damnation , ' twould save the expense of a Christian funeral . "
119462	119473	119475	119476	his father	3903	" Oh - your name is not Jude , then ? "
119487	119493	119484	119484	his	437	" Never heerd on it . "
119494	119499	119501	119501	Sue	174	" Of course not , "
119514	119515	119506	119506	she	2596	" "
119522	119531	119516	119516	We	2597	" said Jude ; and privately to Sue : "
119538	119698	119516	119516	We	2597	" Yet the advent of the child disturbed him . Their position lent them shyness , and having an impression that a marriage at a superintendent registrar 's office was more private than an ecclesiastical one , they decided to avoid a church this time . Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district to give notice : they had become such companions that they could hardly do anything of importance except in each other 's company . Jude Fawley signed the form of notice , Sue looking over his shoulder and watching his hand as it traced the words . As she read the four - square undertaking , never before seen by her , into which her own and Jude 's names were inserted , and by which that very volatile essence , their love for each other , was supposed to be made permanent , her face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive . "
119705	119720	119703	119704	the Parties	2387	" - they were to be parties now , not lovers , she thought . "
119722	119728	119516	119516	We	2597	" - a horrid idea - "
119732	119734	119516	119516	We	2597	" - "
119736	119738	119516	119516	We	2597	" - "
119741	119743	119516	119516	We	2597	" - "

119785	119793	119516	119516	We	2597	" she said on their way home . "
119835	119836	119837	119837	We	2605	" "
119888	119889	119882	119886	the Jewish law - giver	2612	" "
119914	120239	119907	119907	I	0	" During the interval before the issuing of the certificate Sue , in her housekeeping errands , sometimes walked past the office , and furtively glancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch to their union . She could not bear its aspect . Coming after her previous experience of matrimony , all the romance of their attachment seemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same category . She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand , and fancied that people thought him hers , and regarded the intended ceremony as the patching up of an old error . Meanwhile Jude decided to link his present with his past in some slight degree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on earth who was associated with his early life at Marygreen - the aged widow Mrs. Edlin , who had been his great - aunt 's friend and nurse in her last illness . He hardly expected that she would come ; but she did , bringing singular presents , in the form of apples , jam , brass snuffers , an ancient pewter dish , a warming - pan , and an enormous bag of goose feathers towards a bed . She was allotted the spare room in Jude 's house , whither she retired early , and where they could hear her through the ceiling below , honestly saying the Lord 's Prayer in a loud voice , as the Rubric directed . As , however , she could not sleep , and discovered that Sue and Jude were still sitting up - it being in fact only ten o'clock - she dressed herself again and came down , and they all sat by the fire till a late hour - Father Time included ; though , as he never spoke , they were hardly conscious of him . "
120254	120259	120242	120242	I	0	" said the widow . "
120315	120320	120321	120321	They	2619	" Sue breathed uneasily . "
120341	120347	120337	120337	they	2619	" continued the wedding guest . "
120393	120394	120386	120386	he	2622	" "
120399	120403	120386	120386	he	2622	" said Jude . "
120469	120470	120471	120471	I	0	" "
120485	120489	120471	120471	I	0	" murmured Jude . "
120513	120514	120500	120501	this man	4146	" "
120649	120669	120675	120675	Mother	4422	" A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside , as if out of the earth : "
120683	120700	120677	120677	I	0	" It came from little Time , and they started , for they had forgotten him . "
120709	120764	120765	120765	Jude	180	" said Sue cheeringly . After this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of the solemnization they rose , and , wishing their guest good - night , retired . The next morning Sue , whose nervousness intensified with the hours , took Jude privately into the sitting - room before starting . "
120780	120794	120769	120769	you	180	" she said , tremulously nestling up to him , with damp lashes . "
120863	120864	120903	120903	I	0	" "
120871	120877	120903	120903	I	0	" said the quondam theologian . "
120938	120939	120919	120919	you	2656	" "
120949	120953	120954	120954	I	0	" said he . "
120995	120996	120954	120954	I	0	" "
121009	121013	120954	120954	I	0	" she murmured . "
121020	121056	121319	121319	She	2662	" They started arm in arm for the office aforesaid , no witness accompanying them except the Widow Edlin . The day was chilly and dull , and a clammy fog blew through the town from "
121062	121297	121319	121319	She	2662	" On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot - marks of people who had entered , and in the entry were damp umbrellas Within the office several persons were gathered , and our couple perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was just in progress . Sue , Jude , and the widow stood in the background while this was going on , Sue reading the notices of marriage on the wall . The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament , though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough . Law - books in musty calf covered one wall , and elsewhere were post - office directories , and other books of reference . Papers in packets tied with red tape were pigeon - holed around , and some iron safes filled a recess , while the bare wood floor was , like the door - step , stained by previous visitors . The soldier was sullen and reluctant : the bride sad and timid ; she was soon , obviously , to become a mother , and she had a black eye . Their little business was soon done , and the twain and their friends straggled out , one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue in passing , as if he had known them before : "
121339	121433	121434	121434	Jude	180	" Sue turned her head and saw an ill - favoured man , closely cropped , with a broad - faced , pock - marked woman on his arm , ruddy with liquor and the satisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire . They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple , and went forward in front of Jude and Sue , whose diffidence was increasing . The latter drew back and turned to her lover , her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way to grief : "
121491	121492	121493	121495	Dear little girl	2666	" "
121497	121501	121493	121495	Dear little girl	2666	" said Jude . "
121509	121510	121493	121495	Dear little girl	2666	" "
121521	121522	121518	121518	I	0	" "
121529	121540	121518	121518	I	0	" He spoke to the clerk , and came back . "
121558	121562	121552	121552	we	2663	" he said . "
121609	121695	121601	121601	I	0	" They went out stealthily and guiltily , as if they had committed a misdemeanour , closing the door without noise , and telling the widow , who had remained in the entry , to go home and await them ; that they would call in any casual passers as witnesses , if necessary . When in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market - house at Melchester . "
121727	121728	121730	121730	Jude	180	" "
121750	121751	121748	121748	you	841	" "
121808	121825	121797	121797	you	841	" They walked on vaguely , till she paused , and her little voice began anew : "
121987	121998	121951	121951	our	2663	" Jude went up and looked in at the door . "
122008	122012	122013	122013	Everybody	411	" he said . "
122024	122046	122013	122013	Everybody	411	" Sue said she supposed it was because Lent was just over , when there was always a crowd of marriages . "
122051	122055	122013	122013	Everybody	411	" she said , "
122069	122181	122013	122013	Everybody	411	" They stepped in , and entered a back seat , and watched the proceedings at the altar . The contracting couple appeared to belong to the well - to - do middle class , and the wedding altogether was of ordinary prettiness and interest . They could see the flowers tremble in the bride 's hand , even at that distance , and could hear her mechanical murmur of words whose meaning her brain seemed to gather not at all under the pressure of her self - consciousness . Sue and Jude listened , and severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form of self - committal . "
122208	122212	122216	122216	they	2685	" Sue whispered . "
122342	122432	122437	122437	you	180	" Then they tried to laugh , and went on debating in whispers the object - lesson before them . And Jude said he also thought they were both too thin - skinned - that they ought never to have been born - much less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint ventures for THEM - matrimony . His betrothed shuddered ; and asked him earnestly if he indeed felt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that life - undertaking again ? "
122459	122463	122464	122464	I	0	" she said . "
122476	122480	122466	122466	I	0	" said Jude . "
122493	122542	122482	122482	I	0	" While she hesitated he went on to confess that , though he thought they ought to be able to do it , he felt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she did - from their peculiarities , perhaps , because they were unlike other people . "
122560	122564	122558	122558	Sue	174	" he declared . "
122575	122576	122558	122558	Sue	174	" "
122636	122656	122657	122657	Everybody	411	" Sue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them : that all were so . "
122726	122727	122696	122696	They	2694	" "
122752	122764	122741	122741	myself	0	" Thus they murmured on , till Sue said more brightly : "
122839	122840	122841	122841	They	2697	" "
122849	122921	122841	122841	They	2697	" He gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession entering the vestry ; and then they came outside the building . By the door they waited till two or three carriages , which had gone away for a while , returned , and the new husband and wife came into the open daylight . Sue sighed . "
122944	122945	122841	122841	They	2697	" "
123018	123019	123022	123022	some	1125	" "
123040	123064	123022	123022	some	1125	" The bride and bridegroom had by this time driven off , and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers . "
123074	123078	123022	123022	some	1125	" she continued . "
123084	123104	123022	123022	some	1125	" They reached home , and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow looking out at them . "
123107	123115	123116	123116	I	0	" cried their guest when they entered , "
123144	123153	123133	123133	They	2708	" They briefly hinted that they had not . "
123270	123271	123278	123278	he	3918	" "
123282	123287	123275	123276	the child	3918	" whispered Sue nervously . "
123337	124102	124111	124111	Cartlett	356	" V The purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him to express his personal views upon the grave controversy above given . That the twain were happy - between their times of sadness - was indubitable . And when the unexpected apparition of Jude 's child in the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it had looked , but one that brought into their lives a new and tender interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind , it rather helped than injured their happiness . To be sure , with such pleasing anxious beings as they were , the boy 's coming also brought with it much thought for the future , particularly as he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual hopes of childhood . But the pair tried to dismiss , for a while at least , a too strenuously forward view . There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls ; the town may be called Stoke - Barehills . It stands with its gaunt , unattractive , ancient church , and its new red brick suburb , amid the open , chalk - soiled cornlands , near the middle of an imaginary triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham and Wintoncester , and the important military station of Quartershot . The great western highway from London passes through it , near a point where the road branches into two , merely to unite again some twenty miles further westward . Out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to arise among wheeled travellers , before railway days , endless questions of choice between the respective ways . But the question is now as dead as the scot - and - lot freeholder , the road waggoner , and the mail coachman who disputed it ; and probably not a single inhabitant of Stoke - Barehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his town ever meet again ; for nobody now drives up and down the great western highway dally . The most familiar object in Stoke - Barehills nowadays is its cemetery , standing among some picturesque mediaeval ruins beside the railway ; the modern chapels , modern tombs , and modern shrubs having a look of intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy - covered decay of the ancient walls . On a certain day , however , in the particular year which has now been reached by this narrative - the month being early June - the features of the town excite little interest , though many visitors arrive by the trains ; some down - trains , in especial , nearly emptying themselves here . It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show , whose vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents of an investing army . Rows of marquees , huts , booths , pavilions , arcades , porticoes - every kind of structure short of a permanent one - cover the green field for the space of a square half - mile , and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass , and make straight for the exhibition ground . The way thereto is lined with shows , stalls , and hawkers on foot , who make a market - place of the whole roadway to the show proper , and lead some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see . It is the popular day , the shilling day , and of the fast arriving excursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute . One , like several which have preceded it , comes from London : the other by a cross - line from Aldbrickham ; and from the London train alights a couple ; a short , rather bloated man , with a globular stomach and small legs , resembling a top on two pegs , accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and rather red face , dressed in black material , and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt , that made her glisten as if clad in chain - mail . They cast their eyes around . The man was about to hire a fly as some others had done , when the woman said , "
124181	124182	124183	124183	You	2722	" "
124193	124224	124183	124183	You	2722	" said , in a thick voice , her husband , the landlord of The Three Horns , Lambeth ; for they had both come down from the tavern in that "
124235	124276	124183	124183	You	2722	" which they had occupied ever since the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither . The configuration of the landlord showed that he , too , like his customers , was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed . "
124291	124349	124285	124285	I	0	" said his wife . They sauntered on , but had barely entered the town when her attention was attracted by a young couple leading a child , who had come out from the second platform , into which the train from Aldbrickham had steamed . They were walking just in front of the inn - keepers . "
124353	124357	124285	124285	I	0	" said Arabella . "
124362	124366	124285	124285	I	0	" said Cartlett . "
124382	124383	124377	124377	you	2725	" "
124386	124387	124377	124377	you	2725	" "
124397	124398	124377	124377	you	2725	" "

124433	124544	124418	124418	he	607	" Cartlett 's interest in Jude whatever it might have been when Arabella was new to him , had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies , her supernumerary hair - coils , and her optional dimples , were becoming as a tale that is told . Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband 's as to keep just in the rear of the other three , which it was easy to do without notice in such a stream of pedestrians . Her answers to Cartlett 's remarks were vague and slight , for the group in front interested her more than all the rest of the spectacle . "
124559	124564	124565	124566	THEIR child	2638	" continued the publican . "
124573	124583	124584	124584	They	2730	" said Arabella with a curious , sudden covetousness . "
124597	124657	124584	124584	They	2730	" But although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her to lead her to quash her husband 's conjecture , she was not disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary . Mr. Cartlett had no other idea than that his wife 's child by her first husband was with his grandparents at the Antipodes . "
124669	124670	124663	124663	She	2638	" "
124692	125040	125042	125042	she	2739	" All continued to move ahead . The unwitting Sue and Jude , the couple in question , had determined to make this agricultural exhibition within twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day 's excursion which should combine exercise and amusement with instruction , at small expense . Not regardful of themselves alone , they had taken care to bring Father Time , to try every means of making him kindle and laugh like other boys , though he was to some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed . But they soon ceased to consider him an observer , and went along with that tender attention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise , and which these , among entire strangers as they imagined , took less trouble to disguise than they might have done at home . Sue , in her new summer clothes , flexible and light as a bird , her little thumb stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade , went along as if she hardly touched ground , and as if a moderately strong puff of wind would float her over the hedge into the next field . Jude , in his light grey holiday - suit , was really proud of her companionship , not more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words and ways . That complete mutual understanding , in which every glance and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence between them , made them almost the two parts of a single whole . The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles , Arabella and her husband not far behind them . When inside the enclosure the publican 's wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble with the youngster , pointing out and explaining the many objects of interest , alive and dead ; and a passing sadness would touch their faces at their every failure to disturb his indifference . "
125047	125051	125042	125042	she	2739	" said Arabella . "
125078	125079	125075	125075	I	0	" "
125090	125091	125083	125083	you	0	" "

125180	125181	125174	125174	you	0	" "
125187	125229	125182	125182	You	0	" she rejoined . Nevertheless Cartlett 's view of the lovers ' or married pair 's conduct was undoubtedly that of the general crowd , whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by what Arabella 's sharpened vision discerned . "
125242	125246	125182	125182	You	0	" continued Arabella . "
125354	125355	125356	125356	I	0	" "
125401	125402	125396	125396	they	2748	" "
125444	125526	125527	125527	I	0	" Cartlett was not loath to agree to this , and they parted - he proceeding to the shed where malting processes were being exhibited , and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue . Before , however , she had regained their wake a laughing face met her own , and she was confronted by Anny , the friend of her girlhood . Anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance encounter . "
125534	125545	125527	125527	I	0	" she said , as soon as she was composed . "
125588	125589	125577	125577	I	0	" "

125738	125739	125736	125736	Arabella	356	" "
125748	125755	125745	125745	I	0	" murmured she . Anny laughed . "
125770	125771	125760	125760	Arabella	356	" "
125817	125818	125813	125813	she	4206	" "
125834	125835	125822	125822	Abby	230	" "

125996	126017	125971	125971	me	0	" The physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket , and Arabella was induced to make the purchase . "
126023	126034	125971	125971	me	0	" continued he , when the pills were paid for , "
126059	126060	126046	126047	Mrs. Fawley	180	" "
126068	126069	126064	126065	Mrs. Cartlett	349	" "
126109	126110	126111	126111	I	0	" "
126121	126126	126127	126128	The lawyers	2772	" said Arabella dryly . "
126153	126154	126144	126146	that young woman	2774	" "
126166	126167	126144	126146	that young woman	2774	" "
126174	126175	126168	126168	They	2776	" "
126189	126190	126185	126185	I	0	" "
126215	126287	126194	126195	her husband	3921	" The trio followed across the green and entered . Jude and Sue , with the child , unaware of the interest they were exciting , had gone up to a model at one end of the building , which they regarded with considerable attention for a long while before they went on . Arabella and her friends came to it in due course , and the inscription it bore was : "
126304	126305	126299	126302	S. F. M. Bridehead	363	" "
126311	126315	126307	126307	their	2779	" said Arabella . "
126334	126486	126487	126488	Silly fools	2780	" They glanced cursorily at the pictures , and proceeded to the band - stand . When they had stood a little while listening to the music of the military performers , Jude , Sue , and the child came up on the other side . Arabella did not care if they should recognize her ; but they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives , as translated into emotion by the military band , to perceive her under her beaded veil . She walked round the outside of the listening throng , passing behind the lovers , whose movements had an unexpected fascination for her to - day . Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed that Jude 's hand sought Sue 's as they stood , the two standing close together so as to conceal , as they supposed , this tacit expression of their mutual responsiveness . "
126494	126532	126487	126488	Silly fools	2780	" Arabella whispered to herself morosely , as she rejoined her companions , with whom she preserved a preoccupied silence . Anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella 's hankering interest in her first husband . "
126535	126544	126487	126488	Silly fools	2780	" said the physician to Arabella , apart ; "
126576	126586	126567	126567	I	0	" He produced a small phial of clear liquid . "
126621	126622	126603	126603	I	0	" "
126629	126634	126603	126603	I	0	" asked Arabella curiously . "
126670	126671	126674	126674	you	0	" "
126679	126680	126674	126674	you	0	" "
126797	126798	126790	126790	You	2782	" "
126823	126941	126942	126942	I	0	" She produced five shillings , the price asked , and slipped the phial in her capacious bosom . Saying presently that she was due at an appointment with her husband she sauntered away towards the refreshment bar , Jude , his companion , and the child having gone on to the horticultural tent , where Arabella caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom . She waited a few minutes observing them , and then proceeded to join her spouse with no very amiable sentiments . She found him seated on a stool by the bar , talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had served him with spirits . "
126954	126959	126945	126945	you	2789	" Arabella remarked gloomily . "
127010	127011	126991	126991	Dammy	364	" "
127027	127028	127022	127022	I	0	" "
127039	127203	127204	127204	I	0	" she returned , ready to quarrel with the sun for shining on her . And they left the tent together , this pot - bellied man and florid woman , in the antipathetic , recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom . In the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still lingered in the pavilion of flowers - an enchanted palace to their appreciative taste - Sue 's usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of the tinted roses at which she gazed ; for the gay sights , the air , the music , and the excitement of a day 's outing with Jude had quickened her blood and made her eyes sparkle with vivacity . She adored roses , and what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that , and put her face within an inch of their blooms to smell them . "
127218	127223	127209	127209	my	0	" she had said . "
127242	127243	127240	127240	Jude	180	" "
127249	127271	127246	127246	you	0	" said he : and then playfully gave her a little push , so that her nose went among the petals . "
127291	127311	127281	127281	I	0	" Then she looked up at him , and smiled in a way that told so much to Arabella . "
127314	127321	127281	127281	I	0	" he murmured . She nodded . "
127341	127342	127343	127343	You	180	" "
127394	127434	127435	127435	I	0	" Jude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion . But when he had forgotten that he had put the question , and because he no longer wished for an answer , she went on : "
127489	127530	127531	127531	I	0	" And she looked at the aged child , whom , though they had taken him to everything likely to attract a young intelligence , they had utterly failed to interest . He knew what they were saying and thinking . "
127542	127546	127531	127531	I	0	" he said . "
127586	127670	127671	127671	Father	3907	" VI The unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began , from the day of the suspended wedding onwards , to be observed and discussed by other persons than Arabella . The society of Spring Street and the neighbourhood generally did not understand , and probably could not have been made to understand , Sue and Jude 's private minds , emotions , positions , and fears . The curious facts of a child coming to them unexpectedly , who called Jude "
127673	127676	127677	127677	Mother	4422	" and Sue "
127679	127730	127731	127731	Jude	180	" and a hitch in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a registrar 's office , together with rumours of the undefended cases in the law - courts , bore only one translation to plain minds . Little Time - for though he was formally turned into "
127733	128171	128172	128172	I	0	" the apt nickname stuck to him - would come home from school in the evening , and repeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him by the other boys ; and cause Sue , and Jude when he heard them , a great deal of pain and sadness . The result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrar 's the pair went off - to London it was believed - for several days , hiring somebody to look to the boy . When they came back they let it be understood indirectly , and with total indifference and weariness of mien , that they were legally married at last . Sue , who had previously been called Mrs. Bridehead now openly adopted the name of Mrs. Fawley . Her dull , cowed , and listless manner for days seemed to substantiate all this . But the mistake as it was called of their going away so secretly to do the business , kept up much of the mystery of their lives ; and they found that they made not such advances with their neighbours as they had expected to do thereby . A living mystery was not much less interesting than a dead scandal . The baker 's lad and the grocer 's boy , who at first had used to lift their hats gallantly to Sue when they came to execute their errands , in these days no longer took the trouble to render her that homage , and the neighbouring artizans ' wives looked straight along the pavement when they encountered her . Nobody molested them , it is true ; but an oppressive atmosphere began to encircle their souls , particularly after their excursion to the show , as if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on them . And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from this atmosphere , and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and open statements . Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too late to be effective . The headstone and epitaph orders fell off : and two or three months later , when autumn came , Jude perceived that he would have to return to journey - work again , a course all the more unfortunate just now , in that he had not as yet cleared off the debt he had unavoidably incurred in the payment of the law - costs of the previous year . One evening he sat down to share the common meal with Sue and the child as usual . "
128176	128182	128172	128172	I	0	" he said to her , "
128245	128266	128269	128269	I	0	" Sue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of pity , and she saddened . "
128274	128279	128269	128269	I	0	" said she presently . "
128389	128390	128380	128380	You	0	" "
128426	128427	128410	128410	I	0	" "
128463	128464	128493	128493	Sue	174	" "
128472	128477	128493	128493	Sue	174	" he said regretfully . "
128507	128527	128495	128496	The boy	437	" There was a knock at the door , and Jude answered it . Sue could hear the conversation : "
128570	128581	128559	128559	they	2823	" Jude reflected , and said he could undertake it . "
128590	128595	128596	128597	The clergyman	2827	" continued the messenger . "
128624	128625	128607	128607	he	2827	" "
128630	128648	128626	128628	Excellent old man	2830	" said Sue to herself , who was sentimentally opposed to the horrors of over - restoration . "
128659	128665	128667	128667	they	2823	" the messenger went on , "
128702	128716	128680	128680	he	2827	" A bargain as to terms was struck , and Jude came indoors . "
128722	128727	128680	128680	he	2827	" he said cheerfully . "
128768	129135	129158	129158	they	2838	" Next day Jude went out to the church , which was only two miles off . He found that what the contractor 's clerk had said was true . The tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of Christian grace , as the chief ornament of the chancel end , in the fine dry style of the last century . And as their framework was constructed of ornamental plaster they could not be taken down for repair . A portion , crumbled by damp , required renewal ; and when this had been done , and the whole cleansed , he began to renew the lettering . On the second morning Sue came to see what assistance she could render , and also because they liked to be together . The silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence , and , standing on a safe low platform erected by Jude , which she was nevertheless timid at mounting , she began painting in the letters of the first Table while he set about mending a portion of the second . She was quite pleased at her powers ; she had acquired them in the days she painted illumined texts for the church - fitting shop at Christminster . Nobody seemed likely to disturb them ; and the pleasant twitter of birds , and rustle of October leafage , came in through an open window , and mingled with their talk . They were not , however , to be left thus snug and peaceful for long . About half - past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without . The old vicar and his churchwarden entered , and , coming up to see what was being done , seemed surprised to discover that a young woman was assisting . They passed on into an aisle , at which time the door again opened , and another figure entered - a small one , that of little Time , who was crying . Sue had told him where he might find her between school - hours , if he wished . She came down from her perch , and said , "
129144	129145	129158	129158	they	2838	" "
129161	129347	129158	129158	they	2838	" He described how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother , and Sue , grieved , expressed her indignation to Jude aloft . The child went into the churchyard , and Sue returned to her work . Meanwhile the door had opened again , and there shuffled in with a businesslike air the white - aproned woman who cleaned the church . Sue recognized her as one who had friends in Spring Street , whom she visited . The church - cleaner looked at Sue , gaped , and lifted her hands ; she had evidently recognized Jude 's companion as the latter had recognized her . Next came two ladies , and after talking to the charwoman they also moved forward , and as Sue stood reaching upward , watched her hand tracing the letters , and critically regarded her person in relief against the white wall , till she grew so nervous that she trembled visibly . They went back to where the others were standing , talking in undertones : and one said - Sue could not hear which - "
129356	129357	129358	129358	Some	1125	" "
129366	129374	129358	129358	Some	1125	" was the reply from the charwoman . "
129392	129393	129394	129394	They	2844	" "
129408	129409	129394	129394	They	2844	" "
129435	129511	129424	129424	Willis	336	" The churchwarden supposed that Biles and Willis knew of nothing wrong , and then the other , who had been talking to the old woman , explained what she meant by calling them strange people . The probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was made plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote , in a voice that everybody in the church could hear , though obviously suggested by the present situation : "
129999	130018	129996	129996	I	0	" The visitors gave one more glance , as if to see whether Jude and Sue had left the "
130020	130075	130079	130079	comrade	1965	" out likewise , and then severally left the church , even the old woman at last . Sue and Jude , who had not stopped working , sent back the child to school , and remained without speaking ; till , looking at her narrowly , he found she had been crying silently . "
130081	130085	130079	130079	comrade	1965	" he said . "
130092	130093	130094	130094	I	0	" "
130137	130138	130169	130169	Jude	180	" "
130151	130152	130156	130156	we	2876	" "
130178	130226	130169	130169	Jude	180	" To have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating , in a serious view of their position . However , in a few minutes Sue seemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side , and wiping her eyes she laughed . "
130234	130238	130169	130169	Jude	180	" she said , "
130276	130298	130267	130267	I	0	" ... And with her hand over her eyes she laughed again silently and intermittently , till she was quite weak . "
130303	130308	130267	130267	I	0	" said Jude gaily . "
130322	130323	130319	130320	little girl	2877	" "
130334	130347	130319	130320	little girl	2877	" she sighed as she took up the brush and righted herself . "
130369	130370	130371	130371	I	0	" "
130382	130386	130371	130371	I	0	" said Jude . "
130398	130454	130387	130387	I	0	" They sat down to lunch - which they had brought with them not to hinder time - and having eaten it were about to set to work anew when a man entered the church , and Jude recognized in him the contractor Willis . He beckoned to Jude , and spoke to him apart . "
130466	130475	130457	130457	I	0	" he said , with rather breathless awkwardness . "
130540	130576	130528	130528	I	0	" Jude was too independent to make any fuss ; and the contractor paid him , and left . Jude picked up his tools , and Sue cleansed her brush . Then their eyes met . "
130591	130601	130528	130528	I	0	" said she , dropping to her tragic note . "
130616	130617	130618	130618	I	0	" "
130637	130641	130623	130623	anybody	4107	" Jude returned . "
130669	130722	130655	130655	I	0	" They sat down passively for a few minutes , proceeded out of the church , and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way to Aldbrickham . Fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education , and , as was natural with his experiences , he was active in furthering "
130726	131336	130618	130618	I	0	" by any humble means open to him . He had joined an Artizans ' Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about the time of his arrival there ; its members being young men of all creeds and denominations , including Churchmen , Congregationalists , Baptists , Unitarians , Positivists , and others - agnostics had scarcely been heard of at this time - their one common wish to enlarge their minds forming a sufficiently close bond of union . The subscription was small , and the room homely ; and Jude 's activity , uncustomary acquirements , and above all , singular intuition on what to read and how to set about it - begotten of his years of struggle against malignant stars - had led to his being placed on the committee . A few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs , and before he had obtained any more work to do , he went to attend a meeting of the aforesaid committee . It was late when he arrived : all the others had come , and as he entered they looked dubiously at him , and hardly uttered a word of greeting . He guessed that something bearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted . Some ordinary business was transacted , and it was disclosed that the number of subscriptions had shown a sudden falling off for that quarter . One member - a really well - meaning and upright man - began speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes : that it behoved them to look well into their constitution ; for if the committee were not respected , and had not at least , in their differences , a common standard of CONDUCT , they would bring the institution to the ground . Nothing further was said in Jude 's presence , but he knew what this meant ; and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office there and then . Thus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go away . And then bills were sent in , and the question arose , what could Jude do with his great - aunt 's heavy old furniture , if he left the town to travel he knew not whither ? This , and the necessity of ready money , compelled him to decide on an auction , much as he would have preferred to keep the venerable goods . The day of the sale came on ; and Sue for the last time cooked her own , the child 's , and Jude 's breakfast in the little house he had furnished . It chanced to be a wet day ; moreover Sue was unwell , and not wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances , for he was compelled to stay awhile , she acted on the suggestion of the auctioneer 's man , and ensconced herself in an upper room , which could be emptied of its effects , and so kept closed to the bidders . Here Jude discovered her ; and with the child , and their few trunks , baskets , and bundles , and two chairs and a table that were not in the sale , the two sat in meditative talk . Footsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs , the comers inspecting the goods , some of which were of so quaint and ancient a make as to acquire an adventitious value as art . Their door was tried once or twice , and to guard themselves against intrusion Jude wrote "
131338	131484	130655	130655	I	0	" on a scrap of paper , and stuck it upon the panel . They soon found that , instead of the furniture , their own personal histories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected and intolerable extent by the intending bidders . It was not till now that they really discovered what a fools ' paradise of supposed unrecognition they had been living in of late . Sue silently took her companion 's hand , and with eyes on each other they heard these passing remarks - the quaint and mysterious personality of Father Time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and innuendoes . At length the auction began in the room below , whence they could hear each familiar article knocked down , the highly prized ones cheaply , the unconsidered at an unexpected price . "
131491	131496	131497	131497	I	0	" he sighed heavily . "

131914	131926	131888	131888	he	4419	" Their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer : "
131948	131949	131888	131888	he	4419	" "
131958	131962	131888	131888	he	4419	" said Jude . "
131974	132052	131888	131888	he	4419	" One by one the articles went , and the afternoon passed away . Jude and the other two were getting tired and hungry , but after the conversation they had heard they were shy of going out while the purchasers were in their line of retreat . However , the later lots drew on , and it became necessary to emerge into the rain soon , to take on Sue 's things to their temporary lodging . "
132079	132358	131888	131888	he	4419	" The impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense of the whole afternoon . They were Sue 's pets , and when it was found that they could not possibly be kept , more sadness was caused than by parting from all the furniture . Sue tried to think away her tears as she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth advanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally knocked down . The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer , and they were unquestionably doomed to die before the next market day . Noting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her , and said it was time to go and see if the lodgings were ready . He would go on with the boy , and fetch her soon . When she was left alone she waited patiently , but Jude did not come back . At last she started , the coast being clear , and on passing the poulterer 's shop , not far off , she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the door . An emotion at sight of them , assisted by the growing dusk of evening , caused her to act on impulse , and first looking around her quickly , she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover , and went on . The cover was lifted from within , and the pigeons flew away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and swearing to the door . Sue reached the lodging trembling , and found Jude and the boy making it comfortable for her . "
132370	132375	132378	132378	I	0	" she asked breathlessly . "

132397	132406	132389	132389	I	0	" And she explained , in bitter contrition . "
132424	132428	132418	132418	he	6787	" said Jude . "

132477	132482	132466	132466	Mother	229	" said Sue vehemently . "
132496	132500	132485	132485	they	2911	" said Jude . "

132632	133198	133199	133199	I	0	" VII From that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of Aldbrickham . Whither they had gone nobody knew , chiefly because nobody cared to know . Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that they had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship to enter on a shifting , almost nomadic , life , which was not without its pleasantness for a time . Wherever Jude heard of free - stone work to be done , thither he went , choosing by preference places remote from his old haunts and Sue 's . He laboured at a job , long or briefly , till it was finished ; and then moved on . Two whole years and a half passed thus . Sometimes he might have been found shaping the mullions of a country mansion , sometimes setting the parapet of a town - hall , sometimes ashlaring an hotel at Sandbourne , sometimes a museum at Casterbridge , sometimes as far down as Exonbury , sometimes at Stoke - Barehills . Later still he was at Kennetbridge , a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of Marygreen , this being his nearest approach to the village where he was known ; for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during his ardent young manhood of study and promise , and his brief and unhappy married life at that time . At some of these places he would be detained for months , at others only a few weeks . His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical work , both episcopal and noncomformist , which had risen in him when suffering under a smarting sense of misconception , remained with him in cold blood , less from any fear of renewed censure than from an ultra - conscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living out of those who would disapprove of his ways ; also , too , from a sense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present practice , hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first gone up to Christminster now remaining with him . He was mentally approaching the position which Sue had occupied when he first met her . On a Saturday evening in May , nearly three years after Arabella 's recognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show , some of those who there encountered each other met again . It was the spring fair at Kennetbridge , and , though this ancient trade - meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times , the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene about midday . At this hour a light trap , among other vehicles , was driven into the town by the north road , and up to the door of a temperance inn . There alighted two women , one the driver , an ordinary country person , the other a finely built figure in the deep mourning of a widow . Her sombre suit , of pronounced cut , caused her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a provincial fair . "
133210	133235	133208	133208	Anny	221	" said the widow - lady to her companion , when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came forward : "
133269	133270	133261	133261	I	0	" "
133276	133281	133261	133261	I	0	" said the other . "
133306	133307	133296	133296	You	221	" "
133322	133330	133312	133312	you	221	" said the woman in weeds reprovingly . "
133365	133366	133349	133349	you	221	" "
133378	133553	133373	133373	You	221	" The companions then went their several ways , the one in crape walking firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous surroundings . Making inquiries she came to a hoarding , within which were excavations denoting the foundations of a building ; and on the boards without one or two large posters announcing that the foundation - stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that afternoon at three o'clock by a London preacher of great popularity among his body . Having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her steps , and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair . By and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and ginger - breads , standing between the more pretentious erections of trestles and canvas . It was covered with an immaculate cloth , and tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business , she being accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face , who assisted her . "
133559	133566	133373	133373	You	221	" murmured the widow to herself . "
133576	133584	133569	133569	Sue	174	" She drew nearer to the stall . "
133593	133609	133587	133587	you	174	" she said blandly . Sue changed colour and recognized Arabella through the crape veil . "
133617	133637	133612	133612	you	174	" she said stiffly . And then perceiving Arabella 's garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself . "
133645	133646	133647	133649	My poor husband	2930	" "
133720	133721	133711	133711	You	174	" "

133781	133786	133779	133779	Juey	369	" said Sue suddenly , "
133807	133815	133804	133804	I	0	" When he was gone Arabella continued : "

133947	133966	133944	133944	I	0	" Sue writhed under the hard and direct questioning , and her tender little mouth began to quiver . "
133988	133989	133981	133982	Some folks	2948	" "

134191	134192	134186	134186	she	2956	" "
134222	134223	134216	134216	you	0	" "

134302	134317	134320	134320	They	2957	" She had helped herself , and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes . "

134361	134365	134342	134342	his	1773	" laughed Arabella . "
134386	134400	134403	134403	you	2960	" Sue sighed , and she looked her distress at hearing him criticized . "
134422	134423	134415	134415	you	2960	" "
134480	134500	134470	134478	commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition	2961	" Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking than of what she was saying . "
134513	134517	134505	134508	a woman selling cakes	2962	" she said . "
134529	134535	134536	134536	They	2964	" She shook her head . "
134542	134543	134536	134536	They	2964	" "

134609	134622	134596	134596	I	0	" Sue 's manner showed Arabella that her random guess was right . "
134630	134634	134625	134626	the boy	437	" continued Arabella . "
134641	134649	134625	134626	the boy	437	" Sue 's eyes darted a spark . "
134659	134663	134650	134650	You	0	" she cried . "
134756	134757	134746	134746	I	0	" "

134776	134798	134799	134799	I	0	" replied the widow , from the serene heights of a soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority . "
134959	135136	134957	134957	her	221	" Then Arabella wished Sue good - bye , and went on . VIII In the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down the street . Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of persons in broadcloth , with hymn - books in their hands , standing round the excavations for the new chapel - walls . Arabella Cartlett and her weeds stood among them . She had a clear , powerful voice , which could be distinctly heard with the rest , rising and falling to the tune , her inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise . It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett , having had tea at the Temperance Hotel , started on their return journey across the high and open country which stretches between Kennetbridge and Alfredston . Arabella was in a thoughtful mood ; but her thoughts were not of the new chapel , as Anny at first surmised . "
135144	135151	134957	134957	her	221	" at last said Arabella sullenly . "
135212	135213	135210	135210	HER	2984	" "

135371	135389	135363	135363	you	221	" Anny , too , had grown rather serious of late , her lover having jilted her . "
135397	135402	135392	135392	I	0	" urged Arabella morbidly . "
135436	135437	135438	135438	I	0	" "

135554	135657	135548	135548	I	0	" They drove in silence along the straight road till they were within the horizon of Marygreen , which lay not far to the left of their route . They came to the junction of the highway and the cross - lane leading to that village , whose church - tower could be seen athwart the hollow . When they got yet farther on , and were passing the lonely house in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of their marriage , and where the pig - killing had taken place , she could control herself no longer . "
135665	135670	135548	135548	I	0	" she burst out . "

135737	135785	135728	135730	a creeping hypocrite	2994	" Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which she had brought with her to distribute at the fair , and of which she had given away several . As she spoke she flung the whole remainder of the packet into the hedge . "

135876	136026	135868	135868	You	230	" Arabella did calm herself down by degrees ; and they crossed the ridge - way . When they began to descend the long , straight hill , they saw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature and thoughtful gait . In his hand he carried a basket ; and there was a touch of slovenliness in his attire , together with that indefinable something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his own housekeeper , purveyor , confidant , and friend , through possessing nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him . The remainder of the journey was down - hill , and guessing him to be going to Alfredston they offered him a lift , which he accepted . Arabella looked at him , and looked again , till at length she spoke . "
136039	136050	136036	136037	Mr. Phillotson	163	" The wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn . "
136058	136062	136056	136056	Phillotson	163	" he said . "

137144	137232	137142	137142	womankind	3041	" They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston , and passing through the outskirts approached a mill , to which Phillotson said his errand led him ; whereupon they drew up , and he alighted , bidding them good - night in a preoccupied mood . In the meantime Sue , though remarkably successful in her cake - selling experiment at Kennetbridge fair , had lost the temporary brightness which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success . When all her "
137234	137317	137320	137320	he	3042	" cakes had been disposed of she took upon her arm the empty basket , and the cloth which had covered the standing she had hired , and giving the other things to the boy left the street with him . They followed a lane to a distance of half a mile , till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes , and leading a toddler in the other hand . Sue kissed the children , and said , "
137323	137324	137320	137320	he	3042	" "
137328	137334	137320	137320	he	3042	" returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully . "
137353	137445	137320	137320	he	3042	" They turned , and came to some old , dun - tiled cottages with gardens and fruit - trees . Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch without knocking , and were at once in the general living - room . Here they greeted Jude , who was sitting in an arm - chair , the increased delicacy of his normally delicate features , and the childishly expectant look in his eyes , being alone sufficient to show that he had been passing through a severe illness . "
137454	137467	137448	137448	you	3043	" he said , a gleam of interest lighting up his face . "
137479	137520	137448	137448	you	3043	" She told him the pecuniary results , and then hesitated . At last , when they were left alone , she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella , and the latter 's widowhood . Jude was discomposed . "
137528	137532	137524	137524	she	3048	" he said . "
137538	137548	137524	137524	she	3048	" said Sue . Jude 's countenance remained clouded . "
137557	137565	137551	137551	I	0	" she continued , kissing him anxiously . "
137604	137612	137613	137613	She	3048	" She told him all she knew . "
137621	137625	137613	137613	She	3048	" Sue added ; "
137630	137631	137613	137613	She	3048	" "
137634	137638	137613	137613	She	3048	" said Jude , "
137697	137698	137676	137677	Mrs. Edlin	313	" "
137707	137850	137676	137677	Mrs. Edlin	313	" Sue asked , a troublousness in her tones . Then Jude confessed what was in his mind . He said it would surprise her , perhaps , after his having resolutely avoided all the old places for so long . But one thing and another had made him think a great deal of Christminster lately , and , if she did n't mind , he would like to go back there . Why should they care if they were known ? It was oversensitive of them to mind so much . They could go on selling cakes there , for that matter , if he could n't work . He had no sense of shame at mere poverty ; and perhaps he would be as strong as ever soon , and able to set up stone - cutting for himself there . "
137860	137865	137866	137866	Christminster	180	" she said pensively . "
137875	137876	137866	137866	Christminster	180	" "
138039	138087	138090	138090	she	3070	" His hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories ; were actually treading its pavements , receiving the reflection of the sunshine from its wasting walls . Part Sixth AT CHRISTMINSTER AGAIN "
138110	138116	138103	138103	she	3070	" - ESTHER Apoc . . "
138137	138183	138123	138124	a woman	4193	" - R. BROWNING . I On their arrival the station was lively with straw - hatted young men , welcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their welcomers , and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of raiment . "
138189	138193	138123	138124	a woman	4193	" said Sue . "
138217	138218	138202	138202	Jude	180	" "
138221	138253	138202	138202	Jude	180	" said Jude quietly , as he took charge of the small child , and told Arabella 's boy to keep close to them , Sue attending to their own eldest . "
138269	138270	138254	138254	I	0	" "
138280	138292	138272	138272	I	0	" she said , looking anxiously at him up and down . "
138326	138387	138407	138407	them	6784	" Having left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded on foot up the familiar street , the holiday people all drifting in the same direction . Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn off to where accommodation was likely to be found when , looking at the clock and the hurrying crowd , Jude said : "
138410	138411	138404	138404	We	3074	" "
138424	138529	138530	138530	My	0	" she asked . But his soul seemed full of the anniversary , and together they went down Chief Street , their smallest child in Jude 's arms , Sue leading her little girl , and Arabella 's boy walking thoughtfully and silently beside them . Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes , and meekly ignorant parents who had known no college in their youth , were under convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion written large on them that no properly qualified human beings had lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now . "
138544	138548	138537	138542	every one of those young fellows	3079	" said Jude . "
138591	138612	138568	138568	you	3081	" She saw from his face that he was getting into one of his tempestuous , self - harrowing moods . "
138631	138635	138629	138629	dear	795	" she answered . "
138653	138654	138636	138636	I	0	" "
138667	138831	138661	138661	we	3083	" said he . They turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch , whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers , and pursued the lane till there arose on Jude 's sight the circular theatre with that well - known lantern above it , which stood in his mind as the sad symbol of his abandoned hopes , for it was from that outlook that he had finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his great meditation , which convinced him at last of the futility of his attempt to be a son of the university . To - day , in the open space stretching between this building and the nearest college , stood a crowd of expectant people . A passage was kept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber , extending from the door of the college to the door of the large building between it and the theatre . "
138844	138950	138661	138661	we	3083	" cried Jude in sudden excitement . And pushing his way to the front he took up a position close to the barrier , still hugging the youngest child in his arms , while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him . The crowd filled in at their back , and fell to talking , joking , and laughing as carriage after carriage drew up at the lower door of the college , and solemn stately figures in blood - red robes began to alight . The sky had grown overcast and livid , and thunder rumbled now and then . Father Time shuddered . "
138959	138963	138661	138661	we	3083	" he whispered . "
138970	139001	138964	138964	They	3086	" said Sue . While they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and shoulders , and the delay grew tedious . Sue again wished not to stay . "
139009	139177	139002	139002	They	3086	" said Jude , without turning his head . But the procession did not come forth , and somebody in the crowd , to pass the time , looked at the facade of the nearest college , and said he wondered what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst . Jude , who stood near the inquirer , explained it , and finding that the people all round him were listening with interest , went on to describe the carving of the frieze which he had studied years before , and to criticize some details of masonry in other college fronts about the city . The idle crowd , including the two policemen at the doors , stared like the Lycaonians at Paul , for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over any subject in hand , and they seemed to wonder how the stranger should know more about the buildings of their town than they themselves did ; till one of them said : "
139257	139301	139247	139247	Taylor	328	" The speaker was a man named Jack Stagg , with whom Jude had formerly worked in repairing the college masonries ; Tinker Taylor was seen to be standing near . Having his attention called the latter cried across the barriers to Jude : "
139314	139318	139302	139302	You	3093	" Jude nodded . "
139337	139344	139321	139321	you	3093	" Jude assented to this also . "
139352	139436	139321	139321	you	3093	" This came in a new voice , and Jude recognized its owner to be Uncle Joe , another mason whom he had known . Jude replied good - humouredly that he could not dispute it ; and from remark to remark something like a general conversation arose between him and the crowd of idlers , during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude if he remembered the Apostles ' Creed in Latin still , and the night of the challenge in the public house . "
139445	139450	139438	139438	Fortune	376	" threw in Joe . "
139462	139463	139438	139438	Fortune	376	" "
139471	139475	139438	139438	Fortune	376	" entreated Sue . "
139484	139553	139438	139438	Fortune	376	" murmured little Time mournfully , as he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd . But finding himself the centre of curiosity , quizzing , and comment , Jude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he had no great reason to be ashamed of ; and in a little while was stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally : "
139767	139901	139903	139903	he	3108	" However it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten . It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one ; and my impulses - affections - vices perhaps they should be called - were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages ; who should be as cold - blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being one of his country 's worthies . You may ridicule me - I am quite willing that you should - I am a fit subject , no doubt . But I think if you knew what I have gone through these last few years you would rather pity me . And if they knew "
139916	139927	139903	139903	he	3108	" it is just possible they would do the same . "
139928	139942	139944	139945	a woman	4193	" He do look ill and worn - out , it is true ! "
139965	139998	140000	140000	Jude	180	" I may do some good before I am dead - be a sort of success as a frightful example of what not to do ; and so illustrate a moral story , "
140014	140043	140000	140000	Jude	180	" I was , perhaps , after all , a paltry victim to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many unhappy in these days ! "
140044	140051	140053	140053	Sue	174	" Do n't tell them that ! "
140065	140090	140091	140091	Jude	180	" You were n't that . You struggled nobly to acquire knowledge , and only the meanest souls in the world would blame you ! "
140107	140329	140091	140091	Jude	180	" And what I appear , a sick and poor man , is not the worst of me . I am in a chaos of principles - groping in the dark - acting by instinct and not after example . Eight or nine years ago when I came here first , I had a neat stock of fixed opinions , but they dropped away one by one ; and the further I get the less sure I am . I doubt if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm , and actually give pleasure to those I love best . There , gentlemen , since you wanted to know how I was getting on , I have told you . Much good may it do you ! I can not explain further here . I perceive there is something wrong somewhere in our social formulas : what it is can only be discovered by men or women with greater insight than mine - if , indeed , they ever discover it - at least in our time . ' For who knoweth what is good for man in this life ? - and who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ? ' "
140330	140335	140337	140338	the populace	3113	" Hear , hear , "
140340	140344	140346	140347	Tinker Taylor	273	" Well preached ! "
140355	140427	140346	140347	Tinker Taylor	273	" Why , one of them jobbing pa'sons swarming about here , that takes the services when our head reverends want a holiday , would n't ha ' discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down ? Hey ? I 'll take my oath not one o ' 'em would ! And then he must have had it wrote down for ' n. And this only a working - man ! "
140493	140500	140502	140502	Jude	180	" If that can be done , "
140504	140531	140502	140502	Jude	180	" at college gates in the most religious and educational city in the world , what shall we say as to how far we 've got ? "
140532	140535	140539	140540	the policemen	3120	" Order ! "
140558	140572	140539	140540	the policemen	3120	" Keep yer tongue quiet , my man , while the procession passes . "
140619	140627	140628	140628	she	174	" Let us go on , dear , "
140636	140673	140628	140628	she	174	" We have n't any lodgings yet , remember , and all our things are at the station ; and you are by no means well yet . I am afraid this wet will hurt you ! "
140674	140689	140691	140691	he	180	" They are coming now . Just a moment , and I 'll go ! "
140770	140777	140779	140779	Jude	180	" Let 's go that way ! "
140863	140871	140872	140872	he	180	" I wish I could get in ! "
140878	140900	140872	140872	he	180	" Listen - I may catch a few words of the Latin speech by staying here ; the windows are open . "
140950	140964	140965	140965	he	180	" Well - I 'm an outsider to the end of my days ! "
140971	141039	140965	140965	he	180	" Now I 'll go , my patient Sue . How good of you to wait in the rain all this time - to gratify my infatuation ! I 'll never care any more about the infernal cursed place , upon my soul I wo n't ! But what made you tremble so when we were at the barrier ? And how pale you are , Sue ! "
141040	141052	141279	141279	Sue	174	" I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side . "
141053	141059	140965	140965	he	180	" Ah - did you ! "
141060	141134	140965	140965	he	180	" He is evidently come up to Jerusalem to see the festival like the rest of us : and on that account is probably living not so very far away . He had the same hankering for the university that you had , in a milder form . I do n't think he saw me , though he must have heard you speaking to the crowd . But he seemed not to notice . "
141135	141155	141279	141279	Sue	174	" Well - suppose he did . Your mind is free from worries about him now , my Sue ? "
141156	141220	140965	140965	he	180	" Yes , I suppose so . But I am weak . Although I know it is all right with our plans , I felt a curious dread of him ; an awe , or terror , of conventions I do n't believe in . It comes over me at times like a sort of creeping paralysis , and makes me so sad ! "
141221	141245	141246	141246	They	3134	" You are getting tired , Sue . Oh - I forgot , darling ! Yes , we 'll go on at once . "
141381	141386	141388	141388	Jude	180	" Ah - listen ! "
141396	141399	141388	141388	Jude	180	" What ? "
141400	141416	141377	141378	a woman	4193	" Why the bells - what church can that be ? The tones are familiar . "
141431	141437	141439	141440	the landlady	1579	" I do n't know ! "
141443	141451	141439	141440	the landlady	1579	" Did you knock to ask that ? "
141452	141458	141460	141460	Jude	180	" No ; for lodgings , "
141475	141483	141485	141485	she	174	" We have n't any to let , "
141500	141505	141507	141507	Sue	174	" Now , Jude , "
141509	141521	141507	141507	Sue	174	" let me try . You do n't know the way . "
141551	141565	141532	141533	the occupier	3154	" I am sorry to say we do n't let where there are children "
141594	141601	141602	141602	he	437	" I do n't like Christminster ! "
141605	141613	141602	141602	he	437	" Are the great old houses gaols ? "
141614	141619	141621	141621	Jude	180	" No ; colleges , "
141623	141633	141621	141621	Jude	180	" which perhaps you 'll study in some day . "
141634	141640	141641	141642	the boy	437	" I 'd rather not ! "
141645	141652	141654	141654	Sue	174	" Now we 'll try again , "
141656	141688	141654	141654	Sue	174	" I 'll pull my cloak more round me ... Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from Caiaphas to Pilate ! ... How do I look now , dear ? "
141689	141696	141698	141698	Jude	180	" Nobody would notice it now , "
141927	141935	141922	141923	the landlady	1579	" Are you really a married woman ? "
142116	142183	142184	142185	The wife	4448	" Now who wants such a woman here ? and perhaps a confinement ! ... Besides , did n't I say I would n't have children ? The hall and stairs fresh painted , to be kicked about by them ! You must have known all was not straight with 'em - coming like that . Taking in a family when I said a single man . "
142216	142226	142227	142227	she	4031	" I am sorry to tell you , ma'am , "
142230	142293	142227	142227	she	4031	" that I ca n't let you have the room for the week after all . My husband objects ; and therefore I must ask you to go . I do n't mind your staying over to - night , as it is getting late in the afternoon ; but I shall be glad if you can leave early in the morning . "
142526	142537	142539	142540	the boy	437	" I ought not to be born , ought I ? "
142819	142830	142816	142816	his	180	" Mother , WHAT shall we do to - morrow ! "
142831	142837	142839	142839	Sue	174	" I do n't know ! "
142842	142852	142839	142839	Sue	174	" I am afraid this will trouble your father . "
142853	142880	142816	142816	his	180	" I wish Father was quite well , and there had been room for him ! Then it would n't matter so much ! Poor Father ! "
142881	142886	142816	142816	his	180	" It would n't ! "
142887	142893	142839	142839	Sue	174	" Can I do anything ? "
142894	142906	142816	142816	his	180	" No ! All is trouble , adversity , and suffering ! "
142907	142921	142816	142816	his	180	" Father went away to give us children room , did n't he ? "
142922	142925	142839	142839	Sue	174	" Partly . "
142926	142946	142816	142816	his	180	" It would be better to be out o ' the world than in it , would n't it ? "
142947	142954	142816	142816	his	180	" It would almost , dear . "
142955	142978	142816	142816	his	180	" ' Tis because of us children , too , is n't it , that you ca n't get a good lodging ? "
142979	142989	142816	142816	his	180	" Well - people do object to children sometimes . "
142990	143005	142816	142816	his	180	" Then if children make so much trouble , why do people have 'em ? "
143006	143017	142816	142816	his	180	" Oh - because it is a law of nature . "
143018	143028	142816	142816	his	180	" But we do n't ask to be born ? "
143029	143033	142816	142816	his	180	" No indeed . "
143034	143098	142816	142816	his	180	" And what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother , and you need n't have had me unless you liked . I ought n't to have come to ' ee - that 's the real truth ! I troubled 'em in Australia , and I trouble folk here . I wish I had n't been born ! "
143099	143109	142816	142816	his	180	" You could n't help it , my dear . "
143110	143145	142816	142816	his	180	" I think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they should be killed directly , before their souls come to 'em , and not allowed to grow big and walk about ! "
143193	143205	143206	143206	she	174	" There is going to be another in our family soon , "
143210	143213	143206	143206	she	174	" How ? "
143214	143223	143275	143275	her	174	" There is going to be another baby . "
143224	143227	143228	143229	The boy	437	" What ! "
143234	143258	143228	143229	The boy	437	" Oh God , Mother , you 've never a - sent for another ; and such trouble with what you 've got ! "
143259	143271	143273	143273	Sue	174	" Yes , I have , I am sorry to say ! "
143288	143300	143301	143301	he	437	" Oh you do n't care , you do n't care ! "
143307	143397	143398	143398	He	437	" How EVER could you , Mother , be so wicked and cruel as this , when you need n't have done it till we was better off , and Father well ! To bring us all into MORE trouble ! No room for us , and Father a - forced to go away , and we turned out to - morrow ; and yet you be going to have another of us soon ! ... ' Tis done o ' purpose ! - ' tis - ' tis ! "
143405	143416	143417	143417	she	3231	" Y - you must forgive me , little Jude ! "
143431	143486	143417	143417	she	3231	" I ca n't explain - I will when you are older . It does seem - as if I had done it on purpose , now we are in these difficulties ! I ca n't explain , dear ! But it - is not quite on purpose - I ca n't help it ! "
143487	143539	143540	143540	He	437	" Yes it is - it must be ! For nobody would interfere with us , like that , unless you agreed ! I wo n't forgive you , ever , ever ! I 'll never believe you care for me , or Father , or any of us any more ! "
143571	143585	143568	143568	him	437	" If we children was gone there 'd be no trouble at all ! "
143586	143594	143595	143595	she	3234	" Do n't think that , dear , "
143601	143607	143595	143595	she	3234	" But go to sleep ! "
143795	143809	143810	143810	he	180	" You must all come to this inn for a day or two , "
143813	143904	143810	143810	he	180	" It is a rough place , and it will not be so nice for the children , but we shall have more time to look round . There are plenty of lodgings in the suburbs - in my old quarter of Beersheba . Have breakfast with me now you are here , my bird . You are sure you are well ? There will be plenty of time to get back and prepare the children 's meal before they wake . In fact , I 'll go with you . "
144721	144724	144726	144726	Jude	180	" No , "
144728	144820	144726	144726	Jude	180	" It was in his nature to do it . The doctor says there are such boys springing up amongst us - boys of a sort unknown in the last generation - the outcome of new views of life . They seem to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them . He says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live . He 's an advanced man , the doctor : but he can give no consolation to - "
145004	145009	145011	145011	Sue	174	" What is it ? "
145018	145052	145053	145053	She	174	" The organ of the college chapel . The organist practising I suppose . It 's the anthem from the seventy - third Psalm ; ' Truly God is loving unto Israel . ' "
145057	145082	145053	145053	She	174	" Oh , oh my babies ! They had done no harm ! Why should they have been taken away , and not I ! "
145099	145109	145111	145111	Sue	174	" They are talking about us , no doubt ! "
145113	145133	145111	145111	Sue	174	" ' We are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men ! ' "
145137	145147	145148	145148	he	180	" No - they are not talking of us , "
145151	145178	145148	145148	he	180	" They are two clergymen of different views , arguing about the eastward position . Good God - the eastward position , and all creation groaning ! "
145194	145243	145244	145244	He	180	" There is something external to us which says , ' You sha n't ! ' First it said , ' You sha n't learn ! ' Then it said , ' You sha n't labour ! ' Now it says , ' You sha n't love ! ' "
145252	145261	145244	145244	He	180	" That 's bitter of you , darling . "
145262	145268	145244	145244	He	180	" But it 's true ! "
145370	145381	145382	145382	she	174	" Why do n't you speak to me , Jude ? "
145391	145412	145382	145382	she	174	" Do n't turn away from me ! I ca n't BEAR the loneliness of being out of your looks ! "
145413	145422	145423	145423	he	180	" There , dear ; here I am , "
145433	145458	145423	145423	he	180	" Yes ... Oh , my comrade , our perfect union - our two - in - oneness - is now stained with blood ! "
145459	145468	145382	145382	she	174	" Shadowed by death - that 's all . "
145469	145560	145382	145382	she	174	" Ah ; but it was I who incited him really , though I did n't know I was doing it ! I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of mature age . I said the world was against us , that it was better to be out of life than in it at this price ; and he took it literally . And I told him I was going to have another child . It upset him . Oh how bitterly he upbraided me ! "
145561	145570	145423	145423	he	180	" Why did you do it , Sue ? "
145571	145670	145382	145382	she	174	" I ca n't tell . It was that I wanted to be truthful . I could n't bear deceiving him as to the facts of life . And yet I was n't truthful , for with a false delicacy I told him too obscurely . - Why was I half - wiser than my fellow - women ? And not entirely wiser ! Why did n't I tell him pleasant untruths , instead of half - realities ? It was my want of self - control , so that I could neither conceal things nor reveal them ! "
145671	145706	145382	145382	she	174	" Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases ; only in our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps . He must have known sooner or later . "
145707	145863	145423	145423	he	180	" And I was just making my baby darling a new frock ; and now I shall never see him in it , and never talk to him any more ! ... My eyes are so swollen that I can scarcely see ; and yet little more than a year ago I called myself happy ! We went about loving each other too much - indulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other ! We said - do you remember ? - that we would make a virtue of joy . I said it was Nature 's intention , Nature 's law and raison d'etre that we should be joyful in what instincts she afforded us - instincts which civilization had taken upon itself to thwart . What dreadful things I said ! And now Fate has given us this stab in the back for being such fools as to take Nature at her word ! "
145875	145910	145872	145872	she	3296	" It is best , perhaps , that they should be gone . - Yes - I see it is ! Better that they should be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably ! "
145911	145914	145916	145916	Jude	180	" Yes , "
145918	145933	145872	145872	she	3296	" Some say that the elders should rejoice when their children die in infancy . "
145934	146008	146010	146010	Sue	174	" But they do n't know ! ... Oh my babies , my babies , could you be alive now ! You may say the boy wished to be out of life , or he would n't have done it . It was not unreasonable for him to die : it was part of his incurably sad nature , poor little fellow ! But then the others - my OWN children and yours ! "
146032	146039	146040	146040	she	174	" I am a pitiable creature , "
146043	146069	146040	146040	she	174	" good neither for earth nor heaven any more ! I am driven out of my mind by things ! What ought to be done ? "
146081	146087	146088	146088	he	180	" Nothing can be done , "
146091	146107	146108	146108	She	174	" Things are as they are , and will be brought to their destined issue . "
146111	146118	146119	146119	she	174	" Yes ! Who said that ? "
146123	146144	146119	146119	she	174	" It comes in the chorus of the Agamemnon . It has been in my mind continually since this happened . "
146145	146187	146200	146201	The jury	3297	" My poor Jude - how you 've missed everything ! - you more than I , for I did get you ! To think you should know that by your unassisted reading , and yet be in poverty and despair ! "
146660	146680	146681	146681	she	174	" He 's filling them in , and he sha n't till I 've seen my little ones again ! "
146689	146762	146681	146681	she	174	" I want to see them once more . Oh Jude - please Jude - I want to see them ! I did n't know you would let them be taken away while I was asleep ! You said perhaps I should see them once more before they were screwed down ; and then you did n't , but took them away ! Oh Jude , you are cruel to me too ! "
146763	146784	146786	146790	the man with the spade	3323	" She 's been wanting me to dig out the grave again , and let her get to the coffins , "
146792	146854	146786	146790	the man with the spade	3323	" She ought to be took home , by the look o ' her . She is hardly responsible , poor thing , seemingly . Ca n't dig 'em up again now , ma'am . Do ye go home with your husband , and take it quiet , and thank God that there 'll be another soon to swage yer grief . "
146861	146947	146856	146856	Sue	174	" Ca n't I see them once more - just once ! Ca n't I ? Only just one little minute , Jude ? It would not take long ! And I should be so glad , Jude ! I will be so good , and not disobey you ever any more , Jude , if you will let me ? I would go home quietly afterwards , and not want to see them any more ! Ca n't I ? Why ca n't I ? "
147360	147365	147366	147366	she	174	" We must conform ! "
147370	147411	147366	147366	she	174	" All the ancient wrath of the Power above us has been vented upon us , His poor creatures , and we must submit . There is no choice . We must . It is no use fighting against God ! "
147412	147422	147424	147424	Jude	180	" It is only against man and senseless circumstance , "
147426	147429	147430	147430	she	174	" True ! "
147433	147511	147430	147430	she	174	" What have I been thinking of ! I am getting as superstitious as a savage ! ... But whoever or whatever our foe may be , I am cowed into submission . I have no more fighting strength left ; no more enterprise . I am beaten , beaten ! ... ' We are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men ! ' I am always saying that now . "
147512	147518	147366	147366	she	174	" I feel the same ! "
147519	147573	147366	147366	she	174	" What shall we do ? You are in work now ; but remember , it may only be because our history and relations are not absolutely known ... Possibly , if they knew our marriage had not been formalized they would turn you out of your job as they did at Aldbrickham ! "
147574	147609	147430	147430	she	174	" I hardly know . Perhaps they would hardly do that . However , I think that we ought to make it legal now - as soon as you are able to go out . "
147610	147616	147366	147366	she	174	" You think we ought ? "
147617	147620	147366	147366	she	174	" Certainly . "
147627	147635	147636	147636	he	180	" I have seemed to myself lately , "
147639	147755	147636	147636	he	180	" to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the virtuous - the men called seducers . It amazes me when I think of it ! I have not been conscious of it , or of any wrongdoing towards you , whom I love more than myself . Yet I am one of those men ! I wonder if any other of them are the same purblind , simple creatures as I ? ... Yes , Sue - that 's what I am . I seduced you ... You were a distinct type - a refined creature , intended by Nature to be left intact . But I could n't leave you alone ! "
147756	147763	147764	147764	she	3339	" No , no , Jude ! "
147768	147788	147764	147764	she	3339	" Do n't reproach yourself with being what you are not . If anybody is to blame it is I. "
147789	147815	147636	147636	he	180	" I supported you in your resolve to leave Phillotson ; and without me perhaps you would n't have urged him to let you go . "
147816	147865	147764	147764	she	3339	" I should have , just the same . As to ourselves , the fact of our not having entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our union . We have thereby avoided insulting , as it were , the solemnity of our first marriages . "
147866	147869	147764	147764	she	3339	" Solemnity ? "
147892	147895	147896	147896	she	3339	" Yes , "
147907	147935	147896	147896	she	3339	" I have had dreadful fears , a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action . I have thought - that I am still his wife ! "
147936	147939	147904	147904	her	3339	" Whose ? "
147940	147944	147904	147904	her	3339	" Richard 's . "
147945	147954	147896	147896	she	3339	" Good God , dearest ! - why ? "
147955	147969	147904	147904	her	3339	" Oh I ca n't explain ! Only the thought comes to me . "
147970	147992	147904	147904	her	3339	" It is your weakness - a sick fancy , without reason or meaning ! Do n't let it trouble you . "
148264	148274	148275	148275	he	180	" What are you thinking of , little woman ? "
148279	148344	148275	148275	he	180	" Oh I ca n't tell clearly ! I have thought that we have been selfish , careless , even impious , in our courses , you and I. Our life has been a vain attempt at self - delight . But self - abnegation is the higher road . We should mortify the flesh - the terrible flesh - the curse of Adam ! "
148345	148348	148349	148349	he	180	" Sue ! "
148352	148359	148349	148349	he	180	" What has come over you ? "
148360	148419	148275	148275	he	180	" We ought to be continually sacrificing ourselves on the altar of duty ! But I have always striven to do what has pleased me . I well deserved the scourging I have got ! I wish something would take the evil right out of me , and all my monstrous errors , and all my sinful ways ! "
148420	148559	148275	148275	he	180	" Sue - my own too suffering dear ! - there 's no evil woman in you . Your natural instincts are perfectly healthy ; not quite so impassioned , perhaps , as I could wish ; but good , and dear , and pure . And as I have often said , you are absolutely the most ethereal , least sensual woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness . Why do you talk in such a changed way ? We have not been selfish , except when no one could profit by our being otherwise . You used to say that human nature was noble and long - suffering , not vile and corrupt , and at last I thought you spoke truly . And now you seem to take such a much lower view ! "
148560	148580	148349	148349	he	180	" I want a humble heart ; and a chastened mind ; and I have never had them yet ! "
148581	148619	148275	148275	he	180	" You have been fearless , both as a thinker and as a feeler , and you deserved more admiration than I gave . I was too full of narrow dogmas at that time to see it . "
148620	148680	148275	148275	he	180	" Do n't say that , Jude ! I wish my every fearless word and thought could be rooted out of my history . Self - renunciation - that 's everything ! I can not humiliate myself too much . I should like to prick myself all over with pins and bleed out the badness that 's in me ! "
148681	148684	148685	148685	he	3346	" Hush ! "
148702	148738	148685	148685	he	3346	" It is bereavement that has brought you to this ! Such remorse is not for you , my sensitive plant , but for the wicked ones of the earth - who never feel it ! "
148739	148748	148749	148749	she	3347	" I ought not to stay like this , "
148763	148767	148753	148753	she	3347	" Why not ? "
148768	148773	148685	148685	he	3346	" It is indulgence . "
148774	148796	148685	148685	he	3346	" Still on the same tack ! But is there anything better on earth than that we should love one another ? "
148797	148817	148753	148753	she	3347	" Yes . It depends on the sort of love ; and yours - ours - is the wrong . "
148818	148842	148843	148843	She	3347	" I wo n't have it , Sue ! Come , when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry ? "
148851	148854	148855	148855	she	3347	" Never , "
148909	148927	148928	148928	he	3349	" There is a strange , indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you to - night , Sue , "
148931	148962	148928	148928	he	3349	" I mean not only mentally , but about your clothes , also . A sort of vegetable scent , which I seem to know , yet can not remember . "
148963	148968	149051	149051	She	3350	" It is incense . "
148969	148972	149051	149051	She	3350	" Incense ? "
148973	148994	148928	148928	he	3349	" I have been to the service at St. Silas ' , and I was in the fumes of it . "
148995	149001	149051	149051	She	3350	" Oh - St. Silas . "
149002	149010	149051	149051	She	3350	" Yes . I go there sometimes . "
149011	149018	149051	149051	She	3350	" Indeed . You go there ! "
149019	149050	149051	149051	She	3350	" You see , Jude , it is lonely here in the weekday mornings , when you are at work , and I think and think of - of my - "
149063	149079	149051	149051	She	3350	" And I have taken to go in there , as it is so near . "
149080	149112	149051	149051	She	3350	" Oh well - of course , I say nothing against it . Only it is odd , for you . They little think what sort of chiel is amang them ! "
149113	149121	149051	149051	She	3350	" What do you mean , Jude ? "
149122	149132	149051	149051	She	3350	" Well - a sceptic , to be plain . "
149133	149165	149051	149051	She	3350	" How can you pain me so , dear Jude , in my trouble ! Yet I know you did n't mean it . But you ought not to say that . "
149166	149177	149051	149051	She	3350	" I wo n't . But I am much surprised ! "
149178	149232	149051	149051	She	3350	" Well - I want to tell you something else , Jude . You wo n't be angry , will you ? I have thought of it a good deal since my babies died . I do n't think I ought to be your wife - or as your wife - any longer . "
149233	149241	149051	149051	She	3350	" What ? ... But you ARE ! "
149242	149251	149051	149051	She	3350	" From your point of view ; but - "
149252	149347	149051	149051	She	3350	" Of course we were afraid of the ceremony , and a good many others would have been in our places , with such strong reasons for fears . But experience has proved how we misjudged ourselves , and overrated our infirmities ; and if you are beginning to respect rites and ceremonies , as you seem to be , I wonder you do n't say it shall be carried out instantly ? You certainly ARE my wife , Sue , in all but law . What do you mean by what you said ? "
149348	149356	149051	149051	She	3350	" I do n't think I am ! "
149357	149377	149051	149051	She	3350	" Not ? But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony ? Would you feel that you were then ? "
149378	149400	149051	149051	She	3350	" No . I should not feel even then that I was . I should feel worse than I do now . "
149401	149417	149051	149051	She	3350	" Why so - in the name of all that 's perverse , my dear ? "
149418	149425	149051	149051	She	3350	" Because I am Richard 's . "
149426	149438	149051	149051	She	3350	" Ah - you hinted that absurd fancy to me before ! "
149439	149470	149051	149051	She	3350	" It was only an impression with me then ; I feel more and more convinced as time goes on that - I belong to him , or to nobody . "
149471	149482	149051	149051	She	3350	" My good heavens - how we are changing places ! "
149483	149489	149051	149051	She	3350	" Yes . Perhaps so . "
149564	149570	149571	149571	Jude	180	" Is Mr. Fawley here ? "
149694	149703	149704	149704	she	4193	" I have just come from the cemetery , "
149707	149761	149763	149763	Arabella	356	" I inquired and found the child 's grave . I could n't come to the funeral - thank you for inviting me all the same . I read all about it in the papers , and I felt I was n't wanted ... No - I could n't come to the funeral , "
149783	149814	149763	149763	Arabella	356	" But I am glad I found the grave . As ' tis your trade , Jude , you 'll be able to put up a handsome stone to 'em . "
149815	149823	149825	149825	Jude	180	" I shall put up a headstone , "
149828	149841	149825	149825	Jude	180	" He was my child , and naturally I feel for him . "
149842	149851	149943	149943	her	174	" I hope so . We all did . "
149852	149871	149763	149763	Arabella	356	" The others that were n't mine I did n't feel so much for , as was natural . "
149872	149876	149825	149825	Jude	180	" Of course . "
149888	149899	149901	149902	Mrs. Cartlett	349	" I had often wished I had mine with me , "
149904	149927	149901	149902	Mrs. Cartlett	349	" Perhaps ' twouldn't have happened then ! But of course I did n't wish to take him away from your wife . "
149928	149935	149938	149938	Sue	174	" I am not his wife , "
149949	149961	149963	149963	Arabella	356	" Oh , I beg your pardon , I 'm sure , "
149965	149971	149963	149963	Arabella	356	" I thought you were ! "
150033	150035	150067	150067	She	174	" her "
150095	150104	150106	150106	Arabella	356	" She said she was not your wife ? "
150111	150118	150106	150106	Arabella	356	" Why should she do that ? "
150119	150126	150128	150128	Jude	180	" I can not inform you , "
150131	150145	150128	150128	Jude	180	" She is , is n't she ? She once told me so . "
150146	150155	150106	150106	Arabella	356	" I do n't criticize what she says . "
150156	150228	150106	150106	Arabella	356	" Ah - I see ! Well , my time is up . I am staying here to - night , and thought I could do no less than call , after our mutual affliction . I am sleeping at the place where I used to be barmaid , and to - morrow I go back to Alfredston . Father is come home again , and I am living with him . "
150229	150236	150238	150238	Jude	180	" He has returned from Australia ? "
150243	150309	150238	150238	Jude	180	" Yes . Could n't get on there . Had a rough time of it . Mother died of dys - what do you call it - in the hot weather , and Father and two of the young ones have just got back . He has got a cottage near the old place , and for the present I am keeping house for him . "
150437	150447	150449	150449	Jude	180	" Surely not at this time o ' night ? "
150451	150456	150449	150449	Jude	180	" It is shut . "
150457	150475	150415	150416	his wife	4427	" She knows somebody who keeps the key , and she has it whenever she wants it . "
150476	150487	150449	150449	Jude	180	" How long has she been going on with this ? "
150488	150498	150499	150499	Jude	180	" Oh , some few weeks , I think . "
150748	150751	150752	150752	he	180	" Sue ! "
150767	150779	150780	150780	she	174	" What - do you want with me here , Jude ? "
150785	150803	150780	150780	she	174	" You should n't come ! I wanted to be alone ! Why did you intrude here ? "
150804	150810	150811	150811	he	180	" How can you ask ! "
150834	150890	150780	150780	she	174	" Why do I come ? Who has a right to come , I should like to know , if I have not ! I , who love you better than my own self - better - far better - than you have loved me ! What made you leave me to come here alone ? "
150891	150966	150780	150780	she	174	" Do n't criticize me , Jude - I ca n't bear it ! - I have often told you so . You must take me as I am . I am a wretch - broken by my distractions ! I could n't BEAR it when Arabella came - I felt so utterly miserable I had to come away . She seems to be your wife still , and Richard to be my husband ! "
150967	150975	150780	150780	she	174	" But they are nothing to us ! "
150976	151041	150780	150780	she	174	" Yes , dear friend , they are . I see marriage differently now . My babies have been taken from me to show me this ! Arabella 's child killing mine was a judgement - the right slaying the wrong . What , WHAT shall I do ! I am such a vile creature - too worthless to mix with ordinary human beings ! "
151042	151047	151049	151049	Jude	180	" This is terrible ! "
151055	151074	151049	151049	Jude	180	" It is monstrous and unnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no wrong ! "
151075	151085	151086	151086	He	180	" Ah - you do n't know my badness ! "
151090	151203	151086	151086	He	180	" I do ! Every atom and dreg of it ! You make me hate Christianity , or mysticism , or Sacerdotalism , or whatever it may be called , if it 's that which has caused this deterioration in you . That a woman - poet , a woman - seer , a woman whose soul shone like a diamond - whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of , if they could have known you - should degrade herself like this ! I am glad I had nothing to do with Divinity - damn glad - if it 's going to ruin you in this way ! "
151204	151224	151288	151288	she	3374	" You are angry , Jude , and unkind to me , and do n't see how things are . "
151225	151254	151255	151255	He	3373	" Then come along home with me , dearest , and perhaps I shall . I am overburdened - and you , too , are unhinged just now . "
151278	151287	151288	151288	she	3374	" I do n't dislike you , Jude , "
151297	151325	151288	151288	she	3374	" I love you as much as ever ! Only - I ought not to love you - any more . Oh I must not any more ! "
151326	151333	151257	151257	his	3373	" I ca n't own it . "
151334	151368	151288	151288	she	3374	" But I have made up my mind that I am not your wife ! I belong to him - I sacramentally joined myself to him for life . Nothing can alter it ! "
151369	151396	151288	151288	she	3374	" But surely we are man and wife , if ever two people were in this world ? Nature 's own marriage it is , unquestionably ! "
151397	151419	151257	151257	his	3373	" But not Heaven 's . Another was made for me there , and ratified eternally in the church at Melchester . "
151420	151598	151288	151288	she	3374	" Sue , Sue - affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state ! After converting me to your views on so many things , to find you suddenly turn to the right - about like this - for no reason whatever , confounding all you have formerly said through sentiment merely ! You root out of me what little affection and reverence I had left in me for the Church as an old acquaintance ... What I ca n't understand in you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic . Is it peculiar to you , or is it common to woman ? Is a woman a thinking unit at all , or a fraction always wanting its integer ? How you argued that marriage was only a clumsy contract - which it is - how you showed all the objections to it - all the absurdities ! If two and two made four when we were happy together , surely they make four now ? I ca n't understand it , I repeat ! "
151599	151638	151288	151288	she	3374	" Ah , dear Jude ; that 's because you are like a totally deaf man observing people listening to music . You say ' What are they regarding ? Nothing is there . ' But something is . "
151639	151689	151257	151257	his	3373	" That is a hard saying from you ; and not a true parallel ! You threw off old husks of prejudices , and taught me to do it ; and now you go back upon yourself . I confess I am utterly stultified in my estimate of you . "
151690	151738	151288	151288	she	3374	" Dear friend , my only friend , do n't be hard with me ! I ca n't help being as I am , I am convinced I am right - that I see the light at last . But oh , how to profit by it ! "
151759	151766	151768	151768	Jude	180	" Can this be the girl , "
151789	151839	151768	151768	Jude	180	" can this be the girl who brought the pagan deities into this most Christian city ? - who mimicked Miss Fontover when she crushed them with her heel ? - quoted Gibbon , and Shelley , and Mill ? Where are dear Apollo , and dear Venus now ! "
151840	151860	151861	151861	she	3377	" Oh do n't , do n't be so cruel to me , Jude , and I so unhappy ! "
151864	151911	151861	151861	she	3377	" I ca n't bear it ! I was in error - I can not reason with you . I was wrong - proud in my own conceit ! Arabella 's coming was the finish . Do n't satirize me : it cuts like a knife ! "
151947	151950	151951	151951	she	3377	" Jude , "
151957	151966	151951	151951	she	3377	" would you mind getting a lodging here ? "
151967	151992	151993	151993	He	3379	" I will - if , if you really wish ? But do you ? Let me go to our door and understand you . "
152048	152053	152035	152035	She	3377	" Good - night . "
152054	152064	152035	152035	She	3377	" But Sue ! Do n't we live here ? "
152065	152075	152035	152035	She	3377	" You said you would do as I wished ! "
152076	152144	152035	152035	She	3377	" Yes . Very well ! ... Perhaps it was wrong of me to argue distastefully as I have done ! Perhaps as we could n't conscientiously marry at first in the old - fashioned way , we ought to have parted . Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as ours ! Who were we , to think we could act as pioneers ! "
152145	152180	152035	152035	She	3377	" I am so glad you see that much , at any rate . I never deliberately meant to do as I did . I slipped into my false position through jealousy and agitation ! "
152181	152191	152035	152035	She	3377	" But surely through love - you loved me ? "
152192	152214	152035	152035	She	3377	" Yes . But I wanted to let it stop there , and go on always as mere lovers ; until - "
152215	152228	152035	152035	She	3377	" But people in love could n't live for ever like that ! "
152229	152276	152035	152035	She	3377	" Women could : men ca n't , because they - wo n't . An average woman is in this superior to an average man - that she never instigates , only responds . We ought to have lived in mental communion , and no more . "
152277	152310	152035	152035	She	3377	" I was the unhappy cause of the change , as I have said before ! ... Well , as you will ! ... But human nature ca n't help being itself . "
152311	152328	152035	152035	She	3377	" Oh yes - that 's just what it has to learn - self - mastery . "
152329	152344	152035	152035	She	3377	" I repeat - if either were to blame it was not you but I. "
152345	152453	152035	152035	She	3377	" No - it was I. Your wickedness was only the natural man 's desire to possess the woman . Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy stimulated me to oust Arabella . I had thought I ought in charity to let you approach me - that it was damnably selfish to torture you as I did my other friend . But I should n't have given way if you had n't broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her ... But do n't let us say any more about it ! Jude , will you leave me to myself now ? "
152454	152467	152468	152468	he	3384	" Yes ... But Sue - my wife , as you are ! "
152472	152536	152468	152468	he	3384	" my old reproach to you was , after all , a true one . You have never loved me as I love you - never - never ! Yours is not a passionate heart - your heart does not burn in a flame ! You are , upon the whole , a sort of fay , or sprite - not a woman ! "
152537	152689	152035	152035	She	3377	" At first I did not love you , Jude ; that I own . When I first knew you I merely wanted you to love me . I did not exactly flirt with you ; but that inborn craving which undermines some women 's morals almost more than unbridled passion - the craving to attract and captivate , regardless of the injury it may do the man - was in me ; and when I found I had caught you , I was frightened . And then - I do n't know how it was - I could n't bear to let you go - possibly to Arabella again - and so I got to love you , Jude . But you see , however fondly it ended , it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you . "
152690	152702	152035	152035	She	3377	" And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me ! "
152703	152719	152468	152468	he	3384	" Ah - yes ! The further I flounder , the more harm I do ! "
152720	152724	152726	152726	he	3385	" O Sue ! "
152736	152888	152889	152889	Sue	174	" Do not do an immoral thing for moral reasons ! You have been my social salvation . Stay with me for humanity 's sake ! You know what a weak fellow I am . My two arch - enemies you know - my weakness for womankind and my impulse to strong liquor . Do n't abandon me to them , Sue , to save your own soul only ! They have been kept entirely at a distance since you became my guardian - angel ! Since I have had you I have been able to go into any temptations of the sort , without risk . Is n't my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle ? I am in terror lest , if you leave me , it will be with me another case of the pig that was washed turning back to his wallowing in the mire ! "
152894	152917	152889	152889	Sue	174	" Oh , but you must not , Jude ! You wo n't ! I 'll pray for you night and day ! "
152918	152928	152930	152930	Jude	180	" Well - never mind ; do n't grieve , "
152933	152974	152930	152930	Jude	180	" I did suffer , God knows , about you at that time ; and now I suffer again . But perhaps not so much as you . The woman mostly gets the worst of it in the long run ! "
152975	152979	152889	152889	Sue	174	" She does . "
152980	152998	152999	152999	Sue	174	" Unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible . And this one is not that , anyhow ! "
153007	153025	152999	152999	Sue	174	" She is - I fear ! ... Now Jude - good - night , - please ! "
153026	153055	152889	152889	Sue	174	" I must n't stay ? - Not just once more ? As it has been so many times - O Sue , my wife , why not ! "
153056	153085	152889	152889	Sue	174	" No - no - not wife ! ... I am in your hands , Jude - do n't tempt me back now I have advanced so far ! "
153086	153159	153160	153160	He	3386	" Very well . I do your bidding . I owe that to you , darling , in penance for how I overruled it at the first time . My God , how selfish I was ! Perhaps - perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and purest loves that ever existed between man and woman ! ... Then let the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour ! "
153197	153219	153220	153220	she	174	" You do n't see that it is a matter of conscience with me , and not of dislike to you ! "
153224	153257	153220	153220	she	174	" Dislike to you ! But I ca n't say any more - it breaks my heart - it will be undoing all I have begun ! Jude - good - night ! "
153258	153263	153264	153264	he	3386	" Good - night , "
153272	153280	153282	153282	she	174	" Oh but you shall kiss me ! "
153287	153295	153282	153282	she	174	" I ca n't - bear - ! "
153322	153331	153319	153319	she	174	" Good - bye , good - bye ! "
153350	153392	153338	153338	she	174	" We 'll be dear friends just the same , Jude , wo n't we ? And we 'll see each other sometimes - yes ! - and forget all this , and try to be as we were long ago ? "
153510	153517	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" What are you thinking of ? "
153526	153534	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" The university degree you never obtained ? "
153535	153540	153542	153542	Phillotson	258	" No , no , "
153545	153554	153542	153542	Phillotson	258	" Of somebody I saw to - day . "
153561	153564	153558	153558	he	3389	" Susanna . "
153565	153572	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" I saw her , too . "
153573	153578	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" You said nothing . "
153579	153617	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" I did n't wish to draw your attention to her . But , as you did see her , you should have said : ' How d'ye do , my dear - that - was ? ' "
153618	153666	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" Ah , well . I might have . But what do you think of this : I have good reason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her - that I was all wrong . Yes , indeed ! Awkward , is n't it ? "
153667	153682	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" She has taken care to set you right since , anyhow , apparently . "
153683	153700	153519	153519	Gillingham	331	" H'm . That 's a cheap sneer . I ought to have waited , unquestionably . "
153822	153879	154005	154006	Mrs. Cartlett	349	" met his eye . Unimpassioned as he was , it impressed him painfully , and puzzled him not a little , for he could not understand the age of the elder child being what it was stated to be . However , there was no doubt that the newspaper report was in some way true . "
153888	153997	153998	153998	You	3405	" he said : and thought and thought of Sue , and what she had gained by leaving him . Arabella having made her home at Alfredston , and the schoolmaster coming to market there every Saturday , it was not wonderful that in a few weeks they met again - the precise time being just alter her return from Christminster , where she had stayed much longer than she had at first intended , keeping an interested eye on Jude , though Jude had seen no more of her . Phillotson was on his way homeward when he encountered Arabella , and she was approaching the town . "
154008	154012	154005	154006	Mrs. Cartlett	349	" he said . "
154020	154024	154013	154013	I	0	" she replied . "
154083	154084	154081	154081	Jude	180	" "
154095	154096	154081	154081	Jude	180	" "
154150	154151	154155	154155	her	349	" "
154171	154172	154173	154173	He	180	" "
154290	154291	154300	154300	they	3412	" "
154302	154303	154300	154300	they	3412	" "

154416	154439	154398	154398	I	0	" They parted . When Phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he stopped , hastened back , and called her . "
154449	154454	154398	154398	I	0	" Arabella gave it . "
154461	154988	154990	154990	they	3427	" Arabella smiled grimly as she resumed her way , and practised dimple - making all along the road from where the pollard willows begin to the old almshouses in the first street of the town . Meanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen , and for the first time during a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye . On crossing under the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which he had been reduced he stood a moment , and pictured Sue coming out of the door to meet him . No man had ever suffered more inconvenience from his own charity , Christian or heathen , than Phillotson had done in letting Sue go . He had been knocked about from pillar to post at the hands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance ; he had been nearly starved , and was now dependent entirely upon the very small stipend from the school of this village where the parson had got ill - spoken of for befriending him . He had often thought of Arabella 's remarks that he should have been more severe with Sue , that her recalcitrant spirit would soon have been broken . Yet such was his obstinate and illogical disregard of opinion , and of the principles in which he had been trained , that his convictions on the rightness of his course with his wife had not been disturbed . Principles which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were liable to the same catastrophe in another . The instincts which had allowed him to give Sue her liberty now enabled him to regard her as none the worse for her life with Jude . He wished for her still , in his curious way , if he did not love her , and , apart from policy , soon felt that he would be gratified to have her again as his , always provided that she came willingly . But artifice was necessary , he had found , for stemming the cold and inhumane blast of the world 's contempt . And here were the materials ready made . By getting Sue back and remarrying her on the respectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her , and gained his divorce wrongfully , he might acquire some comfort , resume his old courses , perhaps return to the Shaston school , if not even to the Church as a licentiate . He thought he would write to Gillingham to inquire his views , and what he thought of his , Phillotson 's , sending a letter to her . Gillingham replied , naturally , that now she was gone it were best to let her be , and considered that if she were anybody 's wife she was the wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed such tragical adventures . Probably , as his attachment to her seemed unusually strong , the singular pair would make their union legal in course of time , and all would be well , and decent , and in order . "
154998	155004	155005	155005	Gillingham	331	" exclaimed Phillotson to himself . "
155058	155067	155068	155068	I	0	" He wrote a brief reply to Gillingham . "
155144	155515	155517	155517	you	3431	" As he had made up his mind to do this before he had written to his friend , there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at all . However , it was Phillotson 's way to act thus . He accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue , and , knowing her emotional temperament , threw a Rhadamanthine strictness into the lines here and there , carefully hiding his heterodox feelings , not to frighten her . He stated that , it having come to his knowledge that her views had considerably changed , he felt compelled to say that his own , too , were largely modified by events subsequent to their parting . He would not conceal from her that passionate love had little to do with his communication . It arose from a wish to make their lives , if not a success , at least no such disastrous failure as they threatened to become , through his acting on what he had considered at the time a principle of justice , charity , and reason . To indulge one 's instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and right , was not , he had found , permitted with impunity in an old civilization like ours . It was necessary to act under an acquired and cultivated sense of the same , if you wished to enjoy an average share of comfort and honour ; and to let crude loving kindness take care of itself . He suggested that she should come to him there at Marygreen . On second thoughts he took out the last paragraph but one ; and having rewritten the letter he dispatched it immediately , and in some excitement awaited the issue . A few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped the Beersheba suburb of Christminster , towards the quarter in which Jude Fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from Sue . A timid knock sounded upon the door of his abode . It was evening - so he was at home ; and by a species of divination he jumped up and rushed to the door himself . "
155548	155569	155530	155530	I	0	" It had been in the trembling accents of Sue that these words came . Jude put on his hat . "
155579	155583	155530	155530	I	0	" he said . "
155598	155599	155593	155593	I	0	" "
155612	155666	155667	155667	I	0	" Jude was too much affected to go on talking at first ; she , too , was now such a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed to have left her , and they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic shades for a long while , without sound or gesture . "
155673	155716	155667	155667	I	0	" she presently said , her voice now quick , now slow , ' so that you may not hear of it by chance . I am going back to Richard . He has - so magnanimously - agreed to forgive all . "
155717	155726	155773	155773	He	3433	" Going back ? How can you go - "
155727	155772	155773	155773	He	3433	" He is going to marry me again . That is for form 's sake , and to satisfy the world , which does not see things as they are . But of course I AM his wife already . Nothing has changed that . "
155787	155870	155773	155773	He	3433	" But you are MY wife ! Yes , you are . You know it . I have always regretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come back legally married , to save appearances . I loved you , and you loved me ; and we closed with each other ; and that made the marriage . We still love - you as well as I - KNOW it , Sue ! Therefore our marriage is not cancelled . "
155871	155881	155882	155882	she	3434	" Yes ; I know how you see it , "
155890	155931	155882	155882	she	3434	" But I am going to marry him again , as it would be called by you . Strictly speaking you , too - do n't mind my saying it , Jude ! - you should take back - Arabella . "
155932	155961	155773	155773	He	3433	" I should ? Good God - what next ! But how if you and I had married legally , as we were on the point of doing ? "
155962	156092	156093	156093	He	3435	" I should have felt just the same - that ours was not a marriage . And I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament , if he asked me . But ' the world and its ways have a certain worth ' I suppose : therefore I concede a repetition of the ceremony ... Do n't crush all the life out of me by satire and argument , I implore you ! I was strongest once , I know , and perhaps I treated you cruelly . But Jude , return good for evil ! I am the weaker now . Do n't retaliate upon me , but be kind . Oh be kind to me - a poor wicked woman who is trying to mend ! "
156123	156130	156131	156131	he	3435	" All wrong , all wrong ! "
156135	156185	156131	156131	he	3435	" Error - perversity ! It drives me out of my senses . Do you care for him ? Do you love him ? You know you do n't ! It will be a fanatic prostitution - God forgive me , yes - that 's what it will be ! "
156186	156218	156219	156219	Jude	180	" I do n't love him - I must , must , own it , in deepest remorse ! But I shall try to learn to love him by obeying him . "
156268	156289	156290	156290	she	3436	" I have been considerate enough to let you know the whole truth , and to tell it you myself , "
156296	156348	156290	156290	she	3436	" that you might not consider yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand . I have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him . I did not think you would be so rough with me for doing so ! I was going to ask you ... "
156349	156355	156455	156455	he	3438	" To give you away ? "
156356	156378	156455	156455	he	3438	" No . To send - my boxes to me - if you would . But I suppose you wo n't . "
156379	156411	156455	156455	he	3438	" Why , of course I will . What - is n't he coming to fetch you - to marry you from here ? He wo n't condescend to do that ? "
156412	156447	156448	156448	She	3437	" No - I wo n't let him . I go to him voluntarily , just as I went away from him . We are to be married at his little church at Marygreen . "
156478	156519	156462	156462	Jude	180	" I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances , as you , Sue ! No sooner does one expect you to go straight on , as the one rational proceeding , than you double round the corner ! "
156520	156575	156576	156576	They	3439	" Ah , well ; let that go ! ... Jude , I must say good - bye ! But I wanted you to go to the cemetery with me . Let our farewell be there - beside the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my views . "
156621	156632	156634	156634	she	174	" It is here - I should like to part , "
156636	156641	156634	156634	she	174	" So be it ! "
156642	156724	156576	156576	They	3439	" Do n't think me hard because I have acted on conviction . Your generous devotion to me is unparalleled , Jude ! Your worldly failure , if you have failed , is to your credit rather than to your blame . Remember that the best and greatest among mankind are those who do themselves no worldly good . Every successful man is more or less a selfish man . The devoted fail ... ' Charity seeketh not her own . ' "
156725	156763	156634	156634	she	174	" In that chapter we are at one , ever beloved darling , and on it we 'll part friends . Its verses will stand fast when all the rest that you call religion has passed away ! "
156764	156787	156634	156634	she	174	" Well - do n't discuss it . Good - bye , Jude ; my fellow - sinner , and kindest friend ! "
156788	156801	156576	156576	They	3439	" Good - bye , my mistaken wife . Good - bye ! "
156892	156901	156902	156902	he	180	" Sue 's gone from me - gone ! "
157140	157147	157149	157149	she	174	" I 've come , Richard , "
157162	157174	157149	157149	she	174	" I can not believe - you forgive your - wife ! "
157175	157181	157183	157183	Phillotson	258	" Everything , darling Susanna , "
157206	157271	157201	157201	she	258	" My children - are dead - and it is right that they should be ! I am glad - almost . They were sin - begotten . They were sacrificed to teach me how to live ! Their death was the first stage of my purification . That 's why they have not died in vain ! ... You will take me back ? "
157327	157336	157325	157325	him	3464	" You still have an aversion to me ! "
157337	157356	157357	157357	she	258	" Oh no , dear - I have been driving through the damp , and I was chilly ! "
157367	157379	157357	157357	she	258	" When are we going to have the marriage ? Soon ? "
157380	157467	157325	157325	him	3464	" To - morrow morning , early , I thought - if you really wish . I am sending round to the vicar to let him know you are come . I have told him all , and he highly approves - he says it will bring our lives to a triumphant and satisfactory issue . But - are you sure of yourself ? It is not too late to refuse now if - you think you ca n't bring yourself to it , you know ? "
157468	157504	157357	157357	she	258	" Yes , yes , I can ! I want it done quick . Tell him , tell him at once ! My strength is tried by the undertaking - I ca n't wait long ! "
157505	157582	157357	157357	she	258	" Have something to eat and drink then , and go over to your room at Mrs. Edlin 's . I 'll tell the vicar half - past eight to - morrow , before anybody is about - if that 's not too soon for you ? My friend Gillingham is here to help us in the ceremony . He 's been good enough to come all the way from Shaston at great inconvenience to himself . "
157632	157635	157628	157628	she	174	" Oh ! "
157657	157660	157662	157662	Phillotson	258	" What ? "
157691	157700	157701	157701	she	174	" Oh - only a - funny surprise ! "
157718	157723	157725	157725	Phillotson	258	" Ah ! Yes , "
157727	157736	157725	157725	Phillotson	258	" The licence .... It has just come . "
157839	157851	157853	157853	Sue	174	" Oh - I did n't know THAT was put in ! "
157856	157871	157872	157872	She	1006	" I did n't mean it to be . Here is a different one . "
157887	157894	157896	157897	Mrs. Edlin	313	" But this is the prettiest , "
157899	157912	157896	157897	Mrs. Edlin	313	" That one is no better than very sackcloth o ' Scripture ! "
157913	157927	157928	157928	She	1006	" Yes - I meant it to be . Give me the other . "
157953	157963	157938	157938	her	1006	" But my dear , dear ! - whatever ... "
157964	157992	157993	157994	Mrs. Edlin	313	" It is adulterous ! It signifies what I do n't feel - I bought it long ago - to please Jude . It must be destroyed ! "
158017	158027	158029	158030	the widow	5702	" You med ha ' give it to me ! "
158032	158083	158029	158030	the widow	5702	" It do make my heart ache to see such pretty open - work as that a - burned by the flames - not that ornamental night - rails can be much use to a ' ould ' ooman like I. My days for such be all past and gone ! "
158084	158101	158102	158102	Sue	174	" It is an accursed thing - it reminds me of what I want to forget ! "
158105	158114	158102	158102	Sue	174	" It is only fit for the fire . "
158115	158157	158158	158158	Sue	174	" Lord , you be too strict ! What do ye use such words for , and condemn to hell your dear little innocent children that 's lost to ' ee ! Upon my life I do n't call that religion ! "
158168	158181	158158	158158	Sue	174	" Oh , do n't , do n't ! That kills me ! "
158196	158213	158215	158216	Mrs. Edlin	313	" I 'll tell ' ee what - you ought not to marry this man again ! "
158219	158231	158215	158216	Mrs. Edlin	313	" You are in love wi ' t ' other still ! "
158232	158242	158158	158158	Sue	174	" Yes I must - I am his already ! "
158243	158314	158215	158216	Mrs. Edlin	313	" Pshoo ! You be t ' other man 's . If you did n't like to commit yourselves to the binding vow again , just at first , ' twas all the more credit to your consciences , considering your reasons , and you med ha ' lived on , and made it all right at last . After all , it concerned nobody but your own two selves . "
158315	158353	158354	158354	She	3478	" Richard says he 'll have me back , and I 'm bound to go ! If he had refused , it might not have been so much my duty to - give up Jude . But - "
158445	158476	158442	158442	he	331	" Well : you 've all but got her again at last . She ca n't very well go a second time . The pear has dropped into your hand . "
158477	158561	158442	158442	he	331	" Yes ! ... I suppose I am right in taking her at her word . I confess there seems a touch of selfishness in it . Apart from her being what she is , of course , a luxury for a fogy like me , it will set me right in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity , who have never forgiven me for letting her go . So I may get back in some degree into my old track . "
158562	158632	158442	158442	he	331	" Well - if you 've got any sound reason for marrying her again , do it now in God 's name ! I was always against your opening the cage - door and letting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way . You might have been a school inspector by this time , or a reverend , if you had n't been so weak about her . "
158633	158644	158442	158442	he	331	" I did myself irreparable damage - I know it . "
158645	158658	158442	158442	he	331	" Once you 've got her housed again , stick to her . "
158714	158750	158711	158711	He	3485	" Yes - I shall do that . I know woman better now . Whatever justice there was in releasing her , there was little logic , for one holding my views on other subjects . "
158796	158809	158810	158810	Phillotson	258	" I perceive it wo n't do to give way to impulse , "
158828	158878	158810	158810	Phillotson	258	" I flew in the face of the Church 's teaching ; but I did it without malice prepense . Women are so strange in their influence that they tempt you to misplaced kindness . However , I know myself better now . A little judicious severity , perhaps ... "
158879	158909	158810	158810	Phillotson	258	" Yes ; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only . Do n't be too strenuous at first . She 'll come to any terms in time . "
158922	159027	158916	158916	Phillotson	258	" I remember what my vicar at Shaston said , when I left after the row that was made about my agreeing to her elopement . ' The only thing you can do to retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error in not restraining her with a wise and strong hand , and to get her back again if she 'll come , and be firm in the future . ' But I was so headstrong at that time that I paid no heed . And that after the divorce she should have thought of doing so I did not dream . "
159050	159055	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" Good - night . "
159056	159064	159066	159067	Mrs. Edlin	313	" Oh , is that Mr. Phillotson , "
159069	159109	159066	159067	Mrs. Edlin	313	" I was going over to see ' ee . I 've been upstairs with her , helping her to unpack her things ; and upon my word , sir , I do n't think this ought to be ! "
159110	159116	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" What - the wedding ? "
159117	159204	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" Yes . She 's forcing herself to it , poor dear little thing ; and you 've no notion what she 's suffering . I was never much for religion nor against it , but it ca n't be right to let her do this , and you ought to persuade her out of it . Of course everybody will say it was very good and forgiving of ' ee to take her to ' ee again . But for my part I do n't . "
159205	159216	159218	159218	Phillotson	163	" It 's her wish , and I am willing , "
159230	159240	159218	159218	Phillotson	163	" A great piece of laxity will be rectified . "
159241	159329	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" I do n't believe it . She 's his wife if anybody 's . She 's had three children by him , and he loves her dearly ; and it 's a wicked shame to egg her on to this , poor little quivering thing ! She 's got nobody on her side . The one man who 'd be her friend the obstinate creature wo n't allow to come near her . What first put her into this mood o ' mind , I wonder ! "
159330	159357	159358	159358	Phillotson	163	" I ca n't tell . Not I certainly . It is all voluntary on her part . Now that 's all I have to say . "
159362	159377	159358	159358	Phillotson	163	" You 've turned round , Mrs. Edlin . It is unseemly of you ! "
159378	159407	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" Well . I knowed you 'd be affronted at what I had to say ; but I do n't mind that . The truth 's the truth . "
159408	159455	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" I 'm not affronted , Mrs. Edlin . You 've been too kind a neighbour for that . But I must be allowed to know what 's best for myself and Susanna . I suppose you wo n't go to church with us , then ? "
159456	159558	159358	159358	Phillotson	163	" No . Be hanged if I can ... I do n't know what the times be coming to ! Matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one really do feel afeard to move in it at all . In my time we took it more careless ; and I do n't know that we was any the worse for it ! When I and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all the week , and drunk the parish dry , and had to borrow half a crown to begin housekeeping ! "
159572	159591	159568	159568	Phillotson	163	" I do n't know whether I ought to do it - at any rate quite so rapidly . "
159592	159595	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" Why ? "
159596	159629	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" If she is really compelling herself to this against her instincts - merely from this new sense of duty or religion - I ought perhaps to let her wait a bit . "
159630	159651	159568	159568	Phillotson	163	" Now you 've got so far you ought not to back out of it . That 's my opinion . "
159652	159684	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" I ca n't very well put it off now ; that 's true . But I had a qualm when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence . "
159685	159759	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" Now , never you have qualms , old boy . I mean to give her away to - morrow morning , and you mean to take her . It has always been on my conscience that I did n't urge more objections to your letting her go , and now we 've got to this stage I sha n't be content if I do n't help you to set the matter right . "
159775	159866	159048	159048	Phillotson	258	" No doubt when it gets known what I 've done I shall be thought a soft fool by many . But they do n't know Sue as I do . Though so elusive , hers is such an honest nature at bottom that I do n't think she has ever done anything against her conscience . The fact of her having lived with Fawley goes for nothing . At the time she left me for him she thought she was quite within her right . Now she thinks otherwise . "
160048	160051	160053	160054	the schoolmaster	409	" Prompt , "
160106	160112	160114	160114	Sue	174	" Where is the church ? "
160143	160147	160149	160149	Phillotson	163	" Up here , "
160180	160186	160176	160176	he	1262	" We almost want candles . "
160187	160199	160201	160201	Sue	174	" You do - wish me to be yours , Richard ? "
160206	160218	160219	160219	Sue	174	" Certainly , dear : above all things in the world . "
160299	160305	160292	160293	the clergyman	2827	" What God hath joined , "
160319	160325	160306	160307	a woman	4193	" God hath jined indeed ! "
160379	160387	160388	160388	he	1262	" All 's well that ends well , "
160392	160411	160388	160388	he	1262	" May you long be happy together , after thus having been ' saved as by fire . ' "
160446	160449	160450	160450	he	331	" Now , "
160464	160496	160450	160450	he	331	" I shall be able to tell the people in your native place a good round tale ; and they 'll all say ' Well done , ' depend on it . "
160535	160559	160560	160560	he	331	" Of course , my dear , I sha n't expect to intrude upon your personal privacy any more than I did before , "
160564	160588	160560	160560	he	331	" It is for our good socially to do this , and that 's its justification , if it was not my reason . "
160659	160775	160649	160649	Jude	180	" I am lonely , destitute , and houseless - that 's what I am ! Father has turned me out of doors after borrowing every penny I 'd got , to put it into his business , and then accusing me of laziness when I was only waiting for a situation . I am at the mercy of the world ! If you ca n't take me and help me , Jude , I must go to the workhouse , or to something worse . Only just now two undergraduates winked at me as I came along . ' Tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where there 's so many young men ! "
160801	160815	160817	160817	Jude	180	" I am sorry for you , but I am only in lodgings , "
160820	160827	160817	160817	Jude	180	" Then you turn me away ? "
160828	160844	160785	160785	Arabella	356	" I 'll give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days . "
160845	160888	160817	160817	Jude	180	" Oh , but ca n't you have the kindness to take me in ? I can not endure going to a public house to lodge ; and I am so lonely . Please , Jude , for old times ' sake ! "
160889	160894	160896	160896	Jude	180	" No , no , "
160899	160923	160896	160896	Jude	180	" I do n't want to be reminded of those things ; and if you talk about them I shall not help you . "
160924	160932	160934	160934	Arabella	356	" Then I suppose I must go ! "
160947	160953	160955	160955	Jude	180	" The house is full , "
160957	160994	160955	160955	Jude	180	" And I have only a little extra room to my own - not much more than a closet - where I keep my tools , and templates , and the few books I have left ! "
160995	161004	161050	161050	Jude	180	" That would be a palace for me ! "
161005	161013	160955	160955	Jude	180	" There is no bedstead in it . "
161014	161035	160955	160955	Jude	180	" A bit of a bed could be made on the floor . It would be good enough for me . "
161076	161090	161093	161093	Arabella	356	" You may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly ? "
161095	161115	161093	161093	Arabella	356	" My father has insulted me this afternoon , and I 've left him , though without a penny ! "
161126	161158	161116	161117	The householder	5162	" But still , if you are a friend of Mr. Fawley 's we 'll do what we can for a day or two - if he 'll make himself answerable ? "
161159	161164	161166	161166	Jude	180	" Yes , yes , "
161168	161189	161166	161166	Jude	180	" She has really taken me quite unawares ; but I should wish to help her out of her difficulty . "
161261	161270	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" You know the news , I suppose ? "
161271	161283	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" I guess what you mean ; but I know nothing . "
161284	161320	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to - day . She had just heard that the wedding was to be yesterday : but she did n't know if it had come off . "
161321	161331	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" I do n't wish to talk of it . "
161332	161351	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" No , no : of course you do n't . Only it shows what kind of woman - "
161352	161377	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" Do n't speak of her I say ! She 's a fool ! And she 's an angel , too , poor dear ! "
161378	161420	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" If it 's done , he 'll have a chance of getting back to his old position , by everybody 's account , so Anny says . All his well - wishers will be pleased , including the bishop himself . "
161421	161428	161258	161258	Arabella	356	" Do spare me , Arabella . "
161512	161521	161522	161522	she	356	" No - the temptations are too many , "
161525	161537	161522	161522	she	356	" Any humble tavern in the country before that for me . "
161586	161593	161594	161594	he	180	" Yes , if you like , "
161607	161624	161603	161603	she	356	" You seem all in a brood , old man . I 'm sorry for you . "
161625	161633	161603	161603	she	356	" I am all in a brood . "
161634	161673	161603	161603	she	356	" It is about her , I know . It 's no business of mine , but I could find out all about the wedding - if it really did take place - if you wanted to know . "
161674	161679	161603	161603	she	356	" How could you ? "
161680	161720	161603	161603	she	356	" I wanted to go to Alfredston to get a few things I left there . And I could see Anny , who 'll be sure to have heard all about it , as she has friends at Marygreen . "
161746	161756	161757	161757	he	180	" You can ask about it if you like , "
161760	161783	161757	161757	he	180	" I 've not heard a sound from there . It must have been very private , if - they have married . "
161784	161816	161835	161835	his	180	" I am afraid I have n't enough cash to take me there and back , or I should have gone before . I must wait till I have earned some . "
161817	161828	161829	161829	he	180	" Oh - I can pay the journey for you , "
161890	161916	161887	161887	he	180	" Why should I have charged her to be back by a particular time ! She 's nothing to me - nor the other neither ! "
161977	161980	161974	161974	He	180	" Well ? "
161989	161994	161974	161974	He	180	" They are married . "
161995	162003	162004	162004	he	180	" Yes - of course they are ! "
162022	162046	162007	162007	She	356	" Anny says she has heard from Belinda , her relation out at Marygreen , that it was very sad , and curious ! "
162047	162069	161974	161974	He	180	" How do you mean sad ? She wanted to marry him again , did n't she ? And he her ! "
162070	162159	162160	162160	Arabella	356	" Yes - that was it . She wanted to in one sense , but not in the other . Mrs. Edlin was much upset by it all , and spoke out her mind at Phillotson . But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her best embroidery that she 'd worn with you , to blot you out entirely . Well - if a woman feels like it , she ought to do it . I commend her for it , though others do n't . "
162163	162200	162160	162160	Arabella	356	" She felt he was her only husband , and that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of God A'mighty while he lived . Perhaps another woman feels the same about herself , too ! "
162205	162214	162216	162216	Jude	180	" I do n't want any ca nt ! "
162218	162225	162227	162227	Arabella	356	" It is n't ca nt , "
162229	162238	162227	162227	Arabella	356	" I feel exactly the same as she ! "
162247	162276	162278	162278	he	180	" Well - now I know all I wanted to know . Many thanks for your information . I am not going back to my lodgings just yet . "
162422	162425	162426	162426	she	356	" Well , "
162431	162484	162426	162426	she	356	" for all your rowing me that night , I 've called in , for I have something to tell you . I think I shall get married and settled again . Only you must help me : and you can do no less , after what I 've stood ' ee . "
162485	162497	162426	162426	she	356	" I 'll do anything to get thee off my hands ! "
162498	162559	162426	162426	she	356	" Very well . I am now going to look for my young man . He 's on the loose I 'm afraid , and I must get him home . All I want you to do to - night is not to fasten the door , in case I should want to sleep here , and should be late . "
162560	162576	162426	162426	she	356	" I thought you 'd soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping away ! "
162577	162592	162593	162593	She	3557	" Well - do n't do the door . That 's all I say . "
162661	162664	162652	162652	She	3557	" Private Bar "
162728	162761	162719	162719	Jude	180	" You 've come to have something , Arabella ? ... I 'm trying to forget her : that 's all ! But I ca n't ; and I am going home . "
162781	162808	162812	162812	her	356	" I 've come entirely to look for you , dear boy . You are not well . Now you must have something better than that . "
162818	162860	162812	162812	her	356	" You shall have a liqueur - that 's better fit for a man of education than beer . You shall have maraschino , or curacao dry or sweet , or cherry brandy . I 'll treat you , poor chap ! "
162861	162954	162812	162812	her	356	" I do n't care which ! Say cherry brandy ... Sue has served me badly , very badly . I did n't expect it of Sue ! I stuck to her , and she ought to have stuck to me . I 'd have sold my soul for her sake , but she would n't risk hers a jot for me . To save her own soul she lets mine go damn ! ... But it is n't her fault , poor little girl - I am sure it is n't ! "
163077	163087	163060	163060	Her	356	" I do n't care what happens to me , "
163097	163104	163094	163094	she	356	" But I do very much ! "
163142	163181	163139	163139	she	356	" I do n't know what our landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state . I expect we are fastened out , so that he 'll have to come down and let us in . "
163182	163193	163139	163139	she	356	" I do n't know - I do n't know . "
163194	163265	163139	163139	she	356	" That 's the worst of not having a home of your own . I tell you , Jude , what we had best do . Come round to my father 's - I made it up with him a bit to - day . I can let you in , and nobody will see you at all ; and by to - morrow morning you 'll be all right . "
163266	163271	163273	163273	Jude	180	" Anything - anywhere , "
163275	163285	163273	163273	Jude	180	" What the devil does it matter to me ? "
163334	163347	163348	163348	he	180	" This - is th ' Martyrs ' - burning - place , "
163358	163443	163348	163348	he	180	" I remember - in old Fuller 's Holy State - and I am reminded of it - by our passing by here - old Fuller in his Holy State says , that at the burning of Ridley , Doctor Smith - preached sermon , and took as his text ' Though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing . ' - Often think of it as I pass here . Ridley was a - "
163444	163469	163305	163305	his	180	" Yes . Exactly . Very thoughtful of you , deary , even though it has n't much to do with our present business . "
163470	163548	163348	163348	he	180	" Why , yes it has ! I 'm giving my body to be burned ! But - ah you do n't understand ! - it wants Sue to understand such things ! And I was her seducer - poor little girl ! And she 's gone - and I do n't care about myself ! Do what you like with me ! ... And yet she did it for conscience ' sake , poor little Sue ! "
163549	163563	163565	163565	Arabella	356	" Hang her ! - I mean , I think she was right , "
163567	163613	163565	163565	Arabella	356	" I 've my feelings too , like her ; and I feel I belong to you in Heaven 's eye , and to nobody else , till death us do part ! It is - hic - never too late - hic to mend ! "
163677	163687	163688	163688	she	356	" I ca n't find the matches , dear , "
163698	163714	163688	163688	she	356	" But never mind - this way . As quiet as you can , please . "
163715	163723	163725	163725	Jude	180	" It is as dark as pitch , "
163727	163764	163688	163688	she	356	" Give me your hand , and I 'll lead you . That 's it . Just sit down here , and I 'll pull off your boots . I do n't want to wake him . "
163765	163768	163688	163688	she	356	" Who ? "
163769	163780	163781	163781	She	356	" Father . He 'd make a row , perhaps . "
163787	163790	163791	163791	she	356	" Now , "
163794	163813	163791	163791	she	356	" take hold of me - never mind your weight . Now - first stair , second stair - "
163814	163827	163831	163831	Jude	180	" But - are we out in our old house by Marygreen ? "
163833	163861	163831	163831	Jude	180	" I have n't been inside it for years till now ! Hey ? And where are my books ? That 's what I want to know ? "
163862	163901	163902	163903	VII Arabella	305	" We are at my house , dear , where there 's nobody to spy out how ill you are . Now - third stair , fourth stair - that 's it . Now we shall get on . "
163980	163989	163990	163990	he	390	" You must mind the shop this morning , "
163994	164037	163990	163990	he	390	" I 've to go and get some inwards and half a pig from Lumsdon , and to call elsewhere . If you live here you must put your shoulder to the wheel , at least till I get the business started ! "
164038	164050	164051	164051	She	3578	" Well , for to - day I ca n't say . "
164058	164066	164051	164051	She	3578	" I 've got a prize upstairs . "
164067	164074	163990	163990	he	390	" Oh ? What 's that ? "
164075	164081	163990	163990	he	390	" A husband - almost . "
164082	164085	163990	163990	he	390	" No ! "
164086	164100	163990	163990	he	390	" Yes . It 's Jude . He 's come back to me . "
164101	164113	163990	163990	he	390	" Your old original one ? Well , I 'm damned ! "
164114	164128	163990	163990	he	390	" Well , I always did like him , that I will say . "
164129	164140	164142	164142	Donn	390	" But how does he come to be up there ? "
164154	164183	164142	164142	Donn	390	" Do n't ask inconvenient questions , Father . What we 've to do is to keep him here till he and I are - as we were . "
164184	164189	163990	163990	he	390	" How was that ? "
164190	164193	163990	163990	he	390	" Married . "
164194	164245	164142	164142	Donn	390	" Ah ... Well it is the rummest thing I ever heard of - marrying an old husband again , and so much new blood in the world ! He 's no catch , to my thinking . I 'd have had a new one while I was about it . "
164246	164283	163990	163990	he	390	" It is n't rum for a woman to want her old husband back for respectability , though for a man to want his old wife back - well , perhaps it is funny , rather ! "
164304	164317	164318	164318	she	305	" Be civil to him , and I 'll do the rest , "
164326	164413	164318	164318	she	305	" He told me this morning that his head ached fit to burst , and he hardly seemed to know where he was . And no wonder , considering how he mixed his drink last night . We must keep him jolly and cheerful here for a day or two , and not let him go back to his lodging . Whatever you advance I 'll pay back to you again . But I must go up and see how he is now , poor deary . "
164546	164554	164556	164556	she	305	" How are you now , dear ? "
164558	164565	164556	164556	she	305	" It is I - Arabella . "
164566	164600	164526	164526	Her	305	" Ah ! - where - oh yes , I remember ! You gave me shelter ... I am stranded - ill - demoralized - damn bad ! That 's what I am ! "
164601	164641	164556	164556	she	305	" Then do stay here . There 's nobody in the house but father and me , and you can rest till you are thoroughly well . I 'll tell them at the stoneworks that you are knocked up . "
164642	164653	164556	164556	she	305	" I wonder what they are thinking at the lodgings ! "
164654	164680	164526	164526	Her	305	" I 'll go round and explain . Perhaps you had better let me pay up , or they 'll think we 've run away ? "
164681	164694	164556	164556	she	305	" Yes . You 'll find enough money in my pocket there . "
164882	164885	164887	164887	Arabella	305	" Now , "
164893	165050	164887	164887	Arabella	305	" we must keep plenty of good liquor going in the house these next few days . I know his nature , and if he once gets into that fearfully low state that he does get into sometimes , he 'll never do the honourable thing by me in this world , and I shall be left in the lurch . He must be kept cheerful . He has a little money in the savings bank , and he has given me his purse to pay for anything necessary . Well , that will be the licence ; for I must have that ready at hand , to catch him the moment he 's in the humour . You must pay for the liquor . A few friends , and a quiet convivial party would be the thing , if we could get it up . It would advertise the shop , and help me too . "
165051	165081	165129	165129	she	305	" That can be got up easy enough by anybody who 'll afford victuals and drink ... Well yes - it would advertise the shop - that 's true . "
165498	165505	165506	165506	he	273	" Well - to be sure ! "
165557	165560	165562	165562	Arabella	305	" Yes ! "
165566	165616	165562	165562	Arabella	305	" Here we are , just the same . We ought to be ashamed of ourselves , ought n't we ! But it is a sort of housewarming , you see ; and our friends are in no hurry . Come in , Mr. Taylor , and sit down . "
165636	165647	165648	165648	he	273	" I shall lose a quarter , but never mind , "
165651	165685	165648	165648	he	273	" Well , really , I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked in ! It seemed as if I was flung back again into last night , all of a sudden . "
165686	165697	165702	165702	she	305	" So you are . Pour out for Mr. Taylor . "
165738	165757	165758	165758	she	305	" Well , we 've been waiting for certain legal hours to arrive , to tell the truth , "
165777	165835	165758	165758	she	305	" Jude and I have decided to make up matters between us by tying the knot again , as we find we ca n't do without one another after all . So , as a bright notion , we agreed to sit on till it was late enough , and go and do it off - hand . "
165878	165886	165872	165872	Arabella	305	" Now we may as well go . "
165887	165895	165845	165845	she	305	" But the parson do n't know ? "
165896	165954	165966	165967	her father	4197	" Yes , I told him last night that we might come between eight and nine , as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and quiet as possible ; on account of it being our second marriage , which might make people curious to look on if they knew . He highly approved . "
165955	165964	165973	165973	himself	4197	" Oh very well : I 'm ready , "
165975	165981	165982	165982	she	305	" Now , old darling , "
165987	165995	165982	165982	she	305	" Come along , as you promised . "
165996	166003	166005	166005	he	180	" When did I promise anything ? "
166043	166046	166048	166048	Arabella	305	" Why ! "
166053	166077	166048	166048	Arabella	305	" You 've promised to marry me several times as we 've sat here to - night . These gentlemen have heard you . "
166078	166085	166087	166087	Jude	180	" I do n't remember it , "
166090	166107	166087	166087	Jude	180	" There 's only one woman - but I wo n't mention her in this Capharnaum ! "
166114	166122	166124	166124	Donn	390	" Now , Mr. Fawley be honourable , "
166126	166185	166124	166124	Donn	390	" You and my daughter have been living here together these three or four days , quite on the understanding that you were going to marry her . Of course I should n't have had such goings on in my house if I had n't understood that . As a point of honour you must do it now . "
166186	166195	166197	166197	Jude	180	" Do n't say anything against my honour ! "
166203	166243	166197	166197	Jude	180	" I 'd marry the W - - of Babylon rather than do anything dishonourable ! No reflection on you , my dear . It is a mere rhetorical figure - what they call in the books , hyperbole . "
166244	166257	166259	166259	Donn	390	" Keep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you , "
166261	166339	166259	166259	Donn	390	" If I am bound in honour to marry her - as I suppose I am - though how I came to be here with her I know no more than a dead man - marry her I will , so help me God ! I have never behaved dishonourably to a woman or to any living thing . I am not a man who wants to save himself at the expense of the weaker among us ! "
166340	166349	166351	166351	she	3632	" There - never mind him , deary , "
166360	166386	166351	166351	she	3632	" Come up and wash your face , and just put yourself tidy , and off we 'll go . Make it up with Father . "
166423	166428	166429	166429	she	3632	" Do n't go , "
166437	166478	166429	166429	she	3632	" I 've told the little maid to get the breakfast while we are gone ; and when we come back we 'll all have some . A good strong cup of tea will set everybody right for going home . "
166521	166531	166532	166532	he	273	" I do n't wish to speak against friends , "
166535	166576	166532	166532	he	273	" But it do seem a rare curiosity for a couple to marry over again ! If they could n't get on the first time when their minds were limp , they wo n't the second , by my reckoning . "
166577	166586	166650	166651	Tinker Taylor	273	" Do you think he 'll do it ? "
166587	166603	166532	166532	he	273	" He 's been put upon his honour by the woman , so he med . "
166604	166623	166532	166532	he	273	" He 'd hardly do it straight off like this . He 's got no licence nor anything . "
166624	166644	166650	166651	Tinker Taylor	273	" She 's got that , bless you . Did n't you hear her say so to her father ? "
166645	166648	166650	166651	Tinker Taylor	273	" Well , "
166662	166755	166756	166756	Their	3637	" Take her all together , limb by limb , she 's not such a bad - looking piece - particular by candlelight . To be sure , halfpence that have been in circulation ca n't be expected to look like new ones from the mint . But for a woman that 's been knocking about the four hemispheres for some time , she 's passable enough . A little bit thick in the flitch perhaps : but I like a woman that a puff o ' wind wo n't blow down . "
166858	166873	166848	166848	he	273	" By Gad , they are coming ! I think the deed 's done ! "
166874	166877	166879	166880	Uncle Joe	256	" No , "
166886	166916	166879	166880	Uncle Joe	256	" Take my word , he turned rusty at the last minute . They are walking in a very unusual way ; and that 's the meaning of it ! "
166954	166961	166963	166964	Tinker Taylor	273	" Mrs. Fawley , I presume ? "
166969	166976	166978	166978	Arabella	305	" Certainly . Mrs. Fawley again , "
166992	167239	166978	166978	Arabella	305	" There 's the padlock , see ... Well , he was a very nice , gentlemanly man indeed . I mean the clergyman . He said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done : ' Mrs. Fawley , I congratulate you heartily , ' he says . ' For having heard your history , and that of your husband , I think you have both done the right and proper thing . And for your past errors as a wife , and his as a husband , I think you ought now to be forgiven by the world , as you have forgiven each other , ' says he . Yes : he was a very nice , gentlemanly man . ' The Church do n't recognize divorce in her dogma , strictly speaking , ' he says : ' and bear in mind the words of the service in your goings out and your comings in : What God hath joined together let no man put asunder . ' Yes : he was a very nice , gentlemanly man ... But , Jude , my dear , you were enough to make a cat laugh ! You walked that straight , and held yourself that steady , that one would have thought you were going ' prentice to a judge ; though I knew you were seeing double all the time , from the way you fumbled with my finger . "
167240	167255	167257	167257	Jude	180	" I said I 'd do anything to - save a woman 's honour , "
167259	167266	167257	167257	Jude	180	" And I 've done it ! "
167267	167281	166978	166978	Arabella	305	" Well now , old deary , come along and have some breakfast . "
167282	167291	167293	167293	Jude	180	" I want - some - more whisky , "
167296	167330	167293	167293	Jude	180	" Nonsense , dear . Not now ! There 's no more left . The tea will take the muddle out of our heads , and we shall be as fresh as larks . "
167331	167366	167367	167368	VIII Michaelmas	394	" All right . I 've - married you . She said I ought to marry you again , and I have straightway . It is true religion ! Ha - ha - ha ! "
167462	167477	167478	167478	Arabella	305	" I 've got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over again ! "
167484	167559	167478	167478	Arabella	305	" I shall have to keep ' ee entirely - that 's what ' twill come to ! I shall have to make black - pot and sausages , and hawk 'em about the street , all to support an invalid husband I 'd no business to be saddled with at all . Why did n't you keep your health , deceiving one like this ? You were well enough when the wedding was ! "
167560	167565	167567	167567	he	180	" Ah , yes ! "
167572	167619	167567	167567	he	180	" I have been thinking of my foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our first marriage . I feel now that the greatest mercy that could be vouchsafed to me would be that something should serve me as I served that animal . "
167764	167770	167756	167756	She	305	" To write to Sue . "
167771	167787	167756	167756	She	305	" What in the name - do you want me to write to her for ? "
167788	167819	167756	167756	She	305	" To ask how she is , and if she 'll come to see me , because I 'm ill , and should like to see her - once again . "
167820	167836	167756	167756	She	305	" It is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing ! "
167837	167945	167756	167756	She	305	" It is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it . You know I love Sue . I do n't wish to mince the matter - there stands the fact : I love her . I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to her without your knowledge . But I wish to be quite above - board with you , and with her husband . A message through you asking her to come is at least free from any odour of intrigue . If she retains any of her old nature at all , she 'll come . "
167946	167961	167756	167756	She	305	" You 've no respect for marriage whatever , or its rights and duties ! "
167962	168011	168012	168012	he	3658	" What DOES it matter what my opinions are - a wretch like me ! Can it matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an hour - here with one foot in the grave ! ... Come , please write , Arabella ! "
168015	168024	168012	168012	he	3658	" Repay my candour by a little generosity ! "
168025	168031	167756	167756	She	305	" I should think NOT ! "
168032	168041	168042	168042	He	3658	" Not just once ? - Oh do ! "
168055	168087	168042	168042	He	3658	" What do you want HER to know how you are for ? She do n't want to see ' ee . She 's the rat that forsook the sinking ship ! "
168088	168095	168042	168042	He	3658	" Do n't , do n't ! "
168096	168116	168042	168042	He	3658	" And I stuck to un - the more fool I ! Have that strumpet in the house indeed ! "
168157	168165	168166	168166	he	180	" Say another word of that sort , "
168169	168210	168166	168166	he	180	" and I 'll kill you - here and now ! I 've everything to gain by it - my own death not being the least part . So do n't think there 's no meaning in what I say ! "
168211	168220	168222	168222	Arabella	305	" What do you want me to do ? "
168224	168232	168166	168166	he	180	" Promise never to speak of her . "
168233	168240	168252	168252	he	180	" Very well . I do . "
168241	168247	168248	168248	he	180	" I take your word , "
168256	168267	168248	168248	he	180	" But what it is worth I ca n't say . "
168268	168282	168252	168252	he	180	" You could n't kill the pig , but you could kill me ! "
168283	168307	168308	168308	He	180	" Ah - there you have me ! No - I could n't kill you - even in a passion . Taunt away ! "
168332	168339	168340	168340	Arabella	305	" I 'll send for her , "
168343	168363	168340	168340	Arabella	305	" if you 'll agree to my being in the room with you all the time she 's here . "
168398	168409	168394	168394	he	180	" Yes , I agree . Only send for her ! "
168420	168423	168424	168424	she	305	" Yes , "
168427	168458	168424	168424	she	305	" I wrote a note telling her you were ill , and asking her to come to - morrow or the day after . I have n't posted it yet . "
168713	168724	168725	168725	she	305	" Now where the devil is my man gone to ! "
168798	168810	168811	168811	she	305	" If he 's such a fool , let him be ! "
168814	168821	168811	168811	she	305	" I can do no more . "
169038	169064	169065	169066	The child	3918	" Please call at the schoolhouse and ask Mrs. Phillotson if she will be kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes . "
169165	169184	169161	169161	he	180	" Oh - I did n't think it was you ! I did n't - Oh , Jude ! "
169209	169218	169219	169219	he	180	" Do n't go - do n't go ! "
169222	169273	169219	169219	he	180	" This is my last time ! I thought it would be less intrusive than to enter your house . And I shall never come again . Do n't then be unmerciful . Sue , Sue ! We are acting by the letter ; and ' the letter killeth ' ! "
169274	169285	169286	169286	she	174	" I 'll stay - I wo n't be unkind ! "
169304	169328	169286	169286	she	174	" But why did you come , and do this wrong thing , after doing such a right thing as you have done ? "
169329	169334	169219	169219	he	180	" What right thing ? "
169335	169385	169219	169219	he	180	" Marrying Arabella again . It was in the Alfredston paper . She has never been other than yours , Jude - in a proper sense . And therefore you did so well - Oh so well ! - in recognizing it - and taking her to you again . "
169386	169451	169219	169219	he	180	" God above - and is that all I 've come to hear ? If there is anything more degrading , immoral , unnatural , than another in my life , it is this meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing the right thing ! And you too - you call yourself Phillotson 's wife ! HIS wife ! You are mine . "
169452	169476	169219	169219	he	180	" Do n't make me rush away from you - I ca n't bear much ! But on this point I am decided . "
169477	169496	169219	169219	he	180	" I can not understand how you did it - how you think it - I can not ! "
169497	169545	169219	169219	he	180	" Never mind that . He is a kind husband to me - And I - I 've wrestled and struggled , and fasted , and prayed . I have nearly brought my body into complete subjection . And you must n't - will you - wake - "
169546	169640	169219	169219	he	180	" Oh you darling little fool ; where is your reason ? You seem to have suffered the loss of your faculties ! I would argue with you if I did n't know that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all appeals to her brains . Or is it that you are humbugging yourself , as so many women do about these things ; and do n't actually believe what you pretend to , and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion raised by an affected belief ? "
169641	169651	169219	169219	he	180	" Luxury ! How can you be so cruel ! "
169652	169692	169219	169219	he	180	" You dear , sad , soft , most melancholy wreck of a promising human intellect that it has ever been my lot to behold ! Where is your scorn of convention gone ? I WOULD have died game ! "
169693	169708	169709	169709	She	3685	" You crush , almost insult me , Jude ! Go away from me ! "
169714	169757	169709	169709	She	3685	" I will . I would never come to see you again , even if I had the strength to come , which I shall not have any more . Sue , Sue , you are not worth a man 's love ! "
169767	169777	169778	169778	she	3685	" I ca n't endure you to say that ! "
169796	169833	169834	169834	She	3685	" Do n't , do n't scorn me ! Kiss me , oh kiss me lots of times , and say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug - I ca n't bear it ! "
169849	169886	169842	169842	her	3685	" I must tell you - oh I must - my darling Love ! It has been - only a church marriage - an apparent marriage I mean ! He suggested it at the very first ! "
169887	169890	169842	169842	her	3685	" How ? "
169891	169917	169842	169842	her	3685	" I mean it is a nominal marriage only . It has n't been more than that at all since I came back to him ! "
169918	169921	169922	169922	he	3686	" Sue ! "
169939	169980	169932	169932	he	3686	" If misery can know happiness , I have a moment 's happiness now ! Now , in the name of all you hold holy , tell me the truth , and no lie . You do love me still ? "
169981	170008	169932	169932	he	3686	" I do ! You know it too well ! ... But I MUSTN'T do this ! I must n't kiss you back as I would ! "
170009	170013	169932	169932	he	3686	" But do ! "
170014	170029	169932	169932	he	3686	" And yet you are so dear ! - and you look so ill - "
170030	170053	169932	169932	he	3686	" And so do you ! There 's one more , in memory of our dead little children - yours and mine ! "
170068	170079	170080	170080	she	3685	" I MUSTN'T - I CAN'T go on with this ! "
170084	170118	170080	170080	she	3685	" But there , there , darling ; I give you back your kisses ; I do , I do ! ... And now I 'll HATE myself for ever for my sin ! "
170119	170190	170256	170256	she	3687	" No - let me make my last appeal . Listen to this ! We 've both remarried out of our senses . I was made drunk to do it . You were the same . I was gin - drunk ; you were creed - drunk . Either form of intoxication takes away the nobler vision ... Let us then shake off our mistakes , and run away together ! "
170191	170241	170242	170242	She	3687	" No ; again no ! ... Why do you tempt me so far , Jude ! It is too merciless ! ... But I 've got over myself now . Do n't follow me - do n't look at me . Leave me , for pity 's sake ! "
170682	170690	170691	170691	she	305	" You 've been to see her ? "
170694	170698	170700	170700	Jude	180	" I have , "
170709	170720	170700	170700	Jude	180	" Well , now you 'd best march along home . "
170746	170758	170760	170760	she	305	" You 've done for yourself by this , young man , "
170762	170772	170760	170760	she	305	" I do n't know whether you know it . "
170773	170786	170760	170760	she	305	" Of course I do . I meant to do for myself . "
170787	170794	170760	170760	she	305	" What - to commit suicide ? "
170795	170798	170760	170760	she	305	" Certainly . "
170799	170812	170760	170760	she	305	" Well , I 'm blest ! Kill yourself for a woman . "
170813	170974	170760	170760	she	305	" Listen to me , Arabella . You think you are the stronger ; and so you are , in a physical sense , now . You could push me over like a nine - pin . You did not send that letter the other day , and I could not resent your conduct . But I am not so weak in another way as you think . I made up my mind that a man confined to his room by inflammation of the lungs , a fellow who had only two wishes left in the world , to see a particular woman , and then to die , could neatly accomplish those two wishes at one stroke by taking this journey in the rain . That I 've done . I have seen her for the last time , and I 've finished myself - put an end to a feverish life which ought never to have been begun ! "
170975	170992	170760	170760	she	305	" Lord - you do talk lofty ! Wo n't you have something warm to drink ? "
170993	171003	170760	170760	she	305	" No thank you . Let 's get home . "
171017	171024	171013	171013	Jude	180	" What are you looking at ? "
171025	171058	170760	170760	she	305	" Stupid fancies . I see , in a way , those spirits of the dead again , on this my last walk , that I saw when I first walked here ! "
171059	171067	170760	170760	she	305	" What a curious chap you are ! "
171068	171143	171013	171013	Jude	180	" I seem to see them , and almost hear them rustling . But I do n't revere all of them as I did then . I do n't believe in half of them . The theologians , the apologists , and their kin the metaphysicians , the high - handed statesmen , and others , no longer interest me . All that has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality ! "
171217	171224	171208	171208	he	180	" They seem laughing at me ! "
171225	171228	171434	171434	he	3712	" Who ? "
171229	171279	171434	171434	he	3712	" Oh - I was talking to myself ! The phantoms all about here , in the college archways , and windows . They used to look friendly in the old days , particularly Addison , and Gibbon , and Johnson , and Dr. Browne , and Bishop Ken - "
171280	171306	171426	171426	he	3712	" Come along do ! Phantoms ! There 's neither living nor dead hereabouts except a damn policeman ! I never saw the streets emptier . "
171307	171327	171434	171434	he	3712	" Fancy ! The Poet of Liberty used to walk here , and the great Dissector of Melancholy there ! "
171328	171342	171434	171434	he	3712	" I do n't want to hear about 'em ! They bore me . "
171343	171370	171434	171434	he	3712	" Walter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that lane - Wycliffe - Harvey - Hooker - Arnold - and a whole crowd of Tractarian Shades - "
171371	171412	171434	171434	he	3712	" I DON'T WANT to know their names , I tell you ! What do I care about folk dead and gone ? Upon my soul you are more sober when you 've been drinking than when you have not ! "
171413	171420	171421	171421	he	3712	" I must rest a moment , "
171446	171496	171434	171434	he	3712	" This is old Rubric . And that Sarcophagus ; and Up that lane Crozier and Tudor : and all down there is Cardinal with its long front , and its windows with lifted eyebrows , representing the polite surprise of the university at the efforts of such as I. "
171497	171507	171434	171434	he	3712	" Come along , and I 'll treat you ! "
171508	171577	171434	171434	he	3712	" Very well . It will help me home , for I feel the chilly fog from the meadows of Cardinal as if death - claws were grabbing me through and through . As Antigone said , I am neither a dweller among men nor ghosts . But , Arabella , when I am dead , you 'll see my spirit flitting up and down here among these ! "
171578	171597	171434	171434	he	3712	" Pooh ! You may n't die after all . You are tough enough yet , old man . "
171695	171723	171683	171683	she	174	" Lord love ' ee , what do ye do that yourself for , when I 've come o ' purpose ! You knew I should come . "
171724	171773	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Oh - I do n't know - I forgot ! No , I did n't forget . I did it to discipline myself . I have scrubbed the stairs since eight o'clock . I MUST practise myself in my household duties . I 've shamefully neglected them ! "
171774	171811	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Why should ye ? He 'll get a better school , perhaps be a parson , in time , and you 'll keep two servants . ' Tis a pity to spoil them pretty hands . "
171812	171837	171683	171683	she	174	" Do n't talk of my pretty hands , Mrs. Edlin . This pretty body of mine has been the ruin of me already ! "
171838	171875	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Pshoo - you 've got no body to speak of ! You put me more in mind of a sperrit . But there seems something wrong to - night , my dear . Husband cross ? "
171876	171890	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" No . He never is . He 's gone to bed early . "
171891	171897	171683	171683	she	174	" Then what is it ? "
171898	171954	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" I can not tell you . I have done wrong to - day . And I want to eradicate it ... Well - I will tell you this - Jude has been here this afternoon , and I find I still love him - oh , grossly ! I can not tell you more . "
171955	171958	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Ah ! "
171963	171973	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" I told ' ee how ' twould be ! "
171974	172038	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" But it sha n't be ! I have not told my husband of his visit ; it is not necessary to trouble him about it , as I never mean to see Jude any more . But I am going to make my conscience right on my duty to Richard - by doing a penance - the ultimate thing . I must ! "
172039	172065	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" I would n't - since he agrees to it being otherwise , and it has gone on three months very well as it is . "
172066	172126	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Yes - he agrees to my living as I choose ; but I feel it is an indulgence I ought not to exact from him . It ought not to have been accepted by me . To reverse it will be terrible - but I must be more just to him . O why was I so unheroic ! "
172127	172138	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" What is it you do n't like in him ? "
172144	172187	172140	172141	Mrs. Edlin	313	" I can not tell you . It is something ... I can not say . The mournful thing is , that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as I do ; so that no excuse is left me . "
172188	172198	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Did you ever tell Jude what it was ? "
172199	172202	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" Never . "
172203	172216	172218	172219	the widow	5702	" I 've heard strange tales o ' husbands in my time , "
172225	172307	172218	172219	the widow	5702	" They say that when the saints were upon the earth devils used to take husbands ' forms o ' nights , and get poor women into all sorts of trouble . But I do n't know why that should come into my head , for it is only a tale ... What a wind and rain it is to - night ! Well - do n't be in a hurry to alter things , my dear . Think it over . "
172308	172340	171960	171961	the widow	5702	" No , no ! I 've screwed my weak soul up to treating him more courteously - and it must be now - at once - before I break down ! "
172341	172361	172218	172219	the widow	5702	" I do n't think you ought to force your nature . No woman ought to be expected to . "
172362	172377	172218	172219	the widow	5702	" It is my duty . I will drink my cup to the dregs ! "
172403	172415	172416	172416	she	313	" No - no - do n't go , Mrs. Edlin , "
172433	172441	172416	172416	she	313	" But it is bedtime , child . "
172442	172479	172430	172430	her	313	" Yes , but - there 's the little spare room - my room that was . It is quite ready . Please stay , Mrs. Edlin ! - I shall want you in the morning . "
172480	172509	172510	172510	She	313	" Oh well - I do n't mind , if you wish . Nothing will happen to my four old walls , whether I be there or no . "
172524	172531	172533	172533	Sue	174	" Wait here , Mrs. Edlin , "
172535	172548	172533	172533	Sue	174	" I 'll go into my old room a moment by myself . "
172670	172673	172662	172662	she	174	" Richard . "
172714	172723	172724	172724	she	174	" Are you in bed , Mrs. Edlin ? "
172727	172732	172734	172735	the widow	5702	" No , dear , "
172741	172767	172734	172735	the widow	5702	" I be old and slow , and it takes me a long while to un - ray . I han't unlaced my jumps yet . "
172768	172781	172734	172735	the widow	5702	" I - do n't hear him ! And perhaps - perhaps - "
172782	172787	172734	172735	the widow	5702	" What , child ? "
172788	172794	172795	172795	she	174	" Perhaps he 's dead ! "
172798	172826	172795	172795	she	174	" And then - I should be FREE , and I could go to Jude ! ... Ah - no - I forgot HER - and God ! "
172827	172860	172734	172735	the widow	5702	" Let 's go and hearken . No - he 's snoring again . But the rain and the wind is so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between whiles . "
172867	172884	172861	172861	Sue	174	" Mrs. Edlin , good - night again ! I am sorry I called you out . "
172907	172923	172924	172924	she	174	" I must do it - I must ! I must drink to the dregs ! "
172927	172930	172931	172931	she	174	" Richard ! "
172935	172946	172931	172931	she	174	" Hey - what ? Is that you , Susanna ? "
172947	172950	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" Yes . "
172951	172965	172966	172966	He	3734	" What do you want ? Anything the matter ? Wait a moment . "
172980	172983	172966	172966	He	3734	" Yes ? "
172984	173033	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" When we were at Shaston I jumped out of the window rather than that you should come near me . I have never reversed that treatment till now - when I have come to beg your pardon for it , and ask you to let me in . "
173034	173061	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" Perhaps you only think you ought to do this ? I do n't wish you to come against your impulses , as I have said . "
173062	173070	173071	173071	She	3735	" But I beg to be admitted . "
173079	173123	173071	173071	She	3735	" I beg to be admitted ! I have been in error - even to - day . I have exceeded my rights . I did not mean to tell you , but perhaps I ought . I sinned against you this afternoon . "
173124	173127	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" How ? "
173128	173143	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" I met Jude ! I did n't know he was coming . And - "
173144	173147	173071	173071	She	3735	" Well ? "
173148	173159	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" I kissed him , and let him kiss me . "
173160	173167	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" Oh - the old story ! "
173168	173186	173071	173071	She	3735	" Richard , I did n't know we were going to kiss each other till we did ! "
173187	173192	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" How many times ? "
173193	173228	172885	172886	The widow	5702	" A good many . I do n't know . I am horrified to look back on it , and the least I can do after it is to come to you like this . "
173229	173248	173071	173071	She	3735	" Come - this is pretty bad , after what I 've done ! Anything else to confess ? "
173249	173252	173253	173253	She	3736	" No . "
173260	173268	173253	173253	She	3736	" I called him my darling love . "
173293	173357	173289	173289	She	3736	" I am never going to see him any more . He spoke of some things of the past : and it overcame me . He spoke of - the children . But , as I have said , I am glad - almost glad I mean - that they are dead , Richard . It blots out all that life of mine ! "
173358	173376	173289	173289	She	3736	" Well - about not seeing him again any more . Come - you really mean this ? "
173412	173417	173289	173289	She	3736	" Yes , yes ! "
173418	173429	173289	173289	She	3736	" Perhaps you 'll swear it on the New Testament ? "
173430	173434	173435	173435	He	3738	" I will . "
173449	173458	173459	173459	She	174	" Now then : So help you God ! "
173462	173466	173459	173459	She	174	" Very good ! "
173467	173498	173289	173289	She	3736	" Now I supplicate you , Richard , to whom I belong , and whom I wish to honour and obey , as I vowed , to let me in . "
173499	173528	173289	173289	She	3736	" Think it over well . You know what it means . Having you back in the house was one thing - this another . So think again . "
173529	173538	173459	173459	She	174	" I have thought - I wish this ! "
173539	173577	173289	173289	She	3736	" That 's a complaisant spirit - and perhaps you are right . With a lover hanging about , a half - marriage should be completed . But I repeat my reminder this third and last time . "
173578	173588	173289	173289	She	3736	" It is my wish ! ... O God ! "
173589	173600	173289	173289	She	3736	" What did you say ' O God ' for ? "
173601	173607	173289	173289	She	3736	" I do n't know ! "
173608	173615	173616	173616	He	3740	" Yes you do ! But ... "
173638	173649	173650	173650	he	3740	" Well , I thought it might end like this , "
173654	173678	173679	173679	He	3740	" I owe you nothing , after these signs ; but I 'll take you in at your word , and forgive you . "
173694	173700	173701	173701	he	3740	" What 's the matter ? "
173711	173723	173701	173701	he	3740	" You shrink from me again ? - just as formerly ! "
173724	173737	173779	173779	he	3740	" No , Richard - I - I - was not thinking - "
173738	173746	173779	173779	he	3740	" You wish to come in here ? "
173747	173750	173701	173701	he	3740	" Yes . "
173751	173761	173779	173779	he	3740	" You still bear in mind what it means ? "
173762	173770	173779	173779	he	3740	" Yes . It is my duty ! "
173834	173859	173829	173829	she	313	" Ah - perhaps I 'd better go and see if the little thing is all right . How it do blow and rain ! "
173875	173911	173860	173861	The widow	5702	" Ah ! Poor soul ! Weddings be funerals ' a b'lieve nowadays . Fifty - five years ago , come Fall , since my man and I married ! Times have changed since then ! "
173991	174006	174007	174007	she	305	" I 'm hanged if you have n't been clever in this last stroke ! "
174011	174022	174007	174007	she	305	" to get a nurse for nothing by marrying me ! "
174067	174079	174080	174080	he	3740	" Every man has some little power in some one direction , "
174084	174251	174080	174080	he	3740	" I was never really stout enough for the stone trade , particularly the fixing . Moving the blocks always used to strain me , and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows are in always gave me colds , and I think that began the mischief inside . But I felt I could do one thing if I had the opportunity . I could accumulate ideas , and impart them to others . I wonder if the founders had such as I in their minds - a fellow good for nothing else but that particular thing ? ... I hear that soon there is going to be a better chance for such helpless students as I was . There are schemes afoot for making the university less exclusive , and extending its influence . I do n't know much about it . And it is too late , too late for me ! Ah - and for how many worthier ones before me ! "
174252	174260	174262	174262	Arabella	305	" How you keep a - mumbling ! "
174264	174310	174262	174262	Arabella	305	" I should have thought you 'd have got over all that craze about books by this time . And so you would , if you 'd had any sense to begin with . You are as bad now as when we were first married . "
174320	174322	174317	174317	he	3747	" Sue "
174325	174337	174339	174339	Arabella	305	" I wish you 'd mind who you are talking to ! "
174342	174354	174339	174339	Arabella	305	" Calling a respectable married woman by the name of that - "
174401	174412	174413	174413	she	305	" I suppose you want to see your - Sue ? "
174416	174435	174413	174413	she	305	" Well , I do n't mind her coming . You can have her here if you like . "
174436	174446	174394	174394	she	305	" I do n't wish to see her again . "
174447	174455	174413	174413	she	305	" Oh - that 's a change ! "
174456	174484	174413	174413	she	305	" And do n't tell her anything about me - that I 'm ill , or anything . She has chosen her course . Let her go ! "
174556	174569	174551	174551	Sue	174	" I suppose they are still only husband and wife in name ? "
174574	174598	174570	174571	Mrs. Edlin	313	" Well , no - it 's different now . She 's begun it quite lately - all of her own free will . "
174599	174605	174606	174606	he	3749	" When did she begin ? "
174610	174636	174606	174606	he	3749	" The night after you came . But as a punishment to her poor self . He did n't wish it , but she insisted . "
174637	174907	174570	174571	Mrs. Edlin	313	" Sue , my Sue - you darling fool - this is almost more than I can endure ! ... Mrs. Edlin - do n't be frightened at my rambling - I 've got to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone - she was once a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp : who saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away with a word . Then bitter affliction came to us , and her intellect broke , and she veered round to darkness . Strange difference of sex , that time and circumstance , which enlarge the views of most men , narrow the views of women almost invariably . And now the ultimate horror has come - her giving herself like this to what she loathes , in her enslavement to forms ! She , so sensitive , so shrinking , that the very wind seemed to blow on her with a touch of deference ... As for Sue and me when we were at our own best , long ago - when our minds were clear , and our love of truth fearless - the time was not ripe for us ! Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us . And so the resistance they met with brought reaction in her , and recklessness and ruin on me ! ... There - this , Mrs. Edlin , is how I go on to myself continually , as I lie here . I must be boring you awfully . "
174908	174926	174975	174975	nobody	4069	" Not at all , my dear boy . I could hearken to ' ee all day . "
174989	174993	174984	174985	The visitor	5794	" The doctor . "
175011	175019	175021	175022	the physician	4032	" How is my patient at present ? "
175024	175081	175021	175022	the physician	4032	" Oh bad - very bad ! Poor chap , he got excited , and do blaspeam terribly , since I let out some gossip by accident - the more to my blame . But there - you must excuse a man in suffering for what he says , and I hope God will forgive him . "
175082	175098	175140	175140	Arabella	305	" Ah . I 'll go up and see him . Mrs. Fawley at home ? "
175099	175114	175115	175115	Vilbert	189	" She 's not in at present , but she 'll be here soon . "
175220	175232	175233	175233	she	305	" I 'll bring it to you here in the passage , "
175236	175249	175233	175233	she	305	" There 's nobody but me about the house to - day . "
175270	175278	175279	175279	he	189	" What is this , my dear ? "
175286	175299	175279	175279	he	189	" Oh - a drop of wine - and something in it . "
175305	175332	175302	175302	she	305	" I poured your own love - philtre into it , that you sold me at the agricultural show , do n't you re - member ? "
175333	175352	175354	175354	his	189	" I do , I do ! Clever woman ! But you must be prepared for the consequences . "
175366	175372	175373	175373	she	305	" Do n't do n't , "
175381	175387	175373	175373	she	305	" My man will hear . "
175406	175473	175401	175401	she	305	" Well ! Weak women must provide for a rainy day . And if my poor fellow upstairs do go off - as I suppose he will soon - it 's well to keep chances open . And I ca n't pick and choose now as I could when I was younger . And one must take the old if one ca n't get the young . "
175712	175720	175707	175707	she	305	" Why ever does n't Father come ! "
176041	176048	176033	176033	he	180	" A little water , please . "
176070	176080	176059	176059	he	180	" Water - some water - Sue - Arabella ! "
176093	176111	176089	176089	he	180	" Throat - water - Sue - darling - drop of water - please - oh please ! "
176154	176163	176164	176164	he	180	" Ah - yes ! The Remembrance games , "
176167	176176	176164	176164	he	180	" And I here . And Sue defiled ! "
176204	176231	176194	176194	he	180	" Let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man - child conceived . "
176232	176235	176194	176194	he	180	" Hurrah ! "
176236	176274	176194	176194	he	180	" Let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it . Lo , let that night be solitary , let no joyful voice come therein . "
176275	176278	176194	176194	he	180	" Hurrah ! "
176279	176328	176194	176194	he	180	" Why died I not from the womb ? Why did i not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly ? ... For now should I have lain still and been quiet . I should have slept : then had I been at rest ! "
176329	176332	176194	176194	he	180	" Hurrah ! "
176333	176385	176194	176194	he	180	" There the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor ... The small and the great are there ; and the servant is free from his master . Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ? "
176554	176572	176573	176573	she	406	" I should not mind having a spin there with a fellow 's arm round my waist , "
176581	176604	176573	176573	she	406	" But Lord , I must be getting home again - there 's a lot to do . No dancing for me ! "
176629	176639	176641	176642	the former	5732	" We are just going down to the river , "
176644	176667	176641	176642	the former	5732	" to see the boat - bumping . But we 've called round on our way to ask how your husband is . "
176668	176677	176679	176679	Arabella	406	" He 's sleeping nicely , thank you , "
176681	176715	176679	176679	Arabella	406	" That 's right . Well now , ca n't you give yourself half an hour 's relaxation , Mrs. Fawley , and come along with us ? ' Twould do you good . "
176716	176723	176725	176725	she	406	" I should like to go , "
176727	176745	176725	176725	she	406	" I 've never seen the boat - racing , and I hear it is good fun . "
176746	176750	176679	176679	Arabella	406	" Come along ! "
176751	176758	176759	176759	She	406	" How I WISH I could ! "
176766	176800	176759	176759	She	406	" Wait a minute , then . I 'll just run up and see how he is now . Father is with him , I believe ; so I can most likely come . "
176853	176862	176863	176863	she	406	" Why could n't he have been here ! "
176867	176882	176863	176863	she	406	" He wants to see the boats himself - that 's what it is ! "
177024	177040	177021	177021	she	406	" To think he should die just now ! Why did he die just now ! "
177065	177070	177072	177075	one of the workmen	3821	" Here she is ! "
177077	177124	177072	177075	one of the workmen	3821	" We wondered if you were coming after all . Come along ; we must be quick to get a good place ... Well , how is he ? Sleeping well still ? Of course , we do n't want to drag ' ee away if - "
177125	177139	177140	177140	she	406	" Oh yes - sleeping quite sound . He wo n't wake yet , "
177226	177242	177244	177244	Arabella	406	" Oh , I say - how jolly ! I 'm glad I 've come , "
177246	177260	177244	177244	Arabella	406	" And - it ca n't hurt my husband - my being away . "
177340	177342	177356	177356	somebody	4067	" our "
177370	177379	177380	177380	he	189	" That philtre is operating , you know ! "
177386	177397	177380	177380	he	189	" Shame on ' ee to wreck a heart so ! "
177398	177409	177426	177426	Vilbert	189	" I sha n't talk of love to - day . "
177410	177420	177421	177421	She	406	" Why not ? It is a general holiday . "
177579	177588	177590	177590	Arabella	406	" Well - it 's been awfully good , "
177592	177622	177590	177590	Arabella	406	" But I think I must get back to my poor man . Father is there , so far as I know ; but I had better get back . "
177623	177629	177590	177590	Arabella	406	" What 's your hurry ? "
177630	177645	177590	177590	Arabella	406	" Well , I must go ... Dear , dear , this is awkward ! "
177687	177692	177684	177684	Arabella	406	" Dear , dear ! "
177722	177732	177734	177735	the physician	4032	" What a fidget you are , my love , "
177757	177771	177734	177735	the physician	4032	" Just as well have patience : there 's no getting away yet ! "
177843	177853	177854	177854	she	406	" My husband has just gone , poor soul , "
177857	177866	177854	177854	she	406	" Can you come and lay him out ? "
177904	177918	177920	177920	Arabella	406	" I must call at the sexton 's about the bell , too , "
177922	177941	177920	177920	Arabella	406	" It is just round here , is n't it ? I 'll meet you at my door . "
178050	178056	178058	178058	she	313	" How beautiful he is ! "
178060	178070	178072	178072	Arabella	406	" Yes . He 's a ' andsome corpse , "
178112	178117	178119	178121	the old woman	1006	" What 's that ? "
178123	178168	178119	178121	the old woman	1006	" Oh , that 's the doctors in the theatre , conferring honorary degrees on the Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that sort . It 's Remembrance Week , you know . The cheers come from the young men . "
178169	178185	178109	178109	persons	3871	" Aye ; young and strong - lunged ! Not like our poor boy here . "
178331	178338	178339	178339	she	406	" D'ye think she will come ? "
178342	178356	178339	178339	she	406	" I could not say . She swore not to see him again . "
178357	178363	178326	178326	Jude	180	" How is she looking ? "
178364	178405	178339	178339	she	406	" Tired and miserable , poor heart . Years and years older than when you saw her last . Quite a staid , worn woman now . ' Tis the man - she ca n't stomach un , even now ! "
178406	178428	178339	178339	she	406	" If Jude had been alive to see her , he would hardly have cared for her any more , perhaps . "
178429	178460	178326	178326	Jude	180	" That 's what we do n't know ... Did n't he ever ask you to send for her , since he came to see her in that strange way ? "
178461	178488	178339	178339	she	406	" No . Quite the contrary . I offered to send , and he said I was not to let her know how ill he was . "
178489	178495	178339	178339	she	406	" Did he forgive her ? "
178496	178502	178326	178326	Jude	180	" Not as I know . "
178503	178528	178339	178339	she	406	" Well - poor little thing , ' tis to be believed she 's found forgiveness somewhere ! She said she had found peace ! "
178555	178559	178560	178560	She	3875	" said Arabella . "
