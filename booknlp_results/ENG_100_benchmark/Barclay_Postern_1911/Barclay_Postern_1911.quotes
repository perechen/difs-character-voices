143	158	160	161	the Boy	129	" But it was not your niece ! It was always you I wanted , "
503	507	498	499	the Aunt	141	" Do n't ! "
531	536	525	526	The Boy	129	" Do n't what ? "
639	643	636	636	she	139	" Do n't ! "
788	799	800	800	he	129	" How could you think the attraction would be gone ? "
803	842	800	800	he	129	" It was always you , I wanted , not your niece . Good heavens ! How can you have thought it was Mollie , when it was you YOU , just only you , all the time ? "
857	863	864	864	she	141	" Is this a proposal ? "
869	875	877	878	the Boy	129	" Of course it is , "
880	968	877	878	the Boy	129	" and jolly hard it has been , having to wait two whole weeks to make it . I want you to marry me , Christobel . I dare say you think me a cheeky young beggar to suggest it , point blank . But I want you to give me seven days ; and , in those seven days , I am going to win you . Then it will seem to you , as it does to me , the only possible thing to do . "
1021	1026	1027	1027	she	141	" You amazing boy ! "
1030	1056	1027	1027	she	141	" Do you consider it right to take away a person 's breath , in this fashion ? Or are you trying to be funny ? "
1057	1066	1068	1069	the Boy	129	" I have no designs on your breath , "
1071	1088	1068	1069	the Boy	129	" and it is my misfortune , but not my fault , if I seem funny . "
1112	1121	1122	1122	he	129	" I want you to understand , dear , "
1127	1160	1122	1122	he	129	" that I have said only a very little of all I have to say . But I hope that little is to the point ; and I jolly well mean it . "
1192	1200	1201	1201	she	141	" It is certainly to the point , "
1204	1265	1201	1201	she	141	" There can be no possible doubt about that . But are you aware , dear boy , that I have been assiduously chaperoning you and my niece , during the past two weeks ; and watching , with the affectionate interest of a middle - aged relative , the course of true love running with satisfactory and unusual smoothness ? "
1317	1327	1329	1330	the Boy	129	" Why did you say ' Do n't ' ? "
1361	1427	1342	1342	She	141	" Boy dear , I hardly know . It was something you did , which , for a moment , I could not quite bear . Something passed from you to me , too intimate , too sweet , to be quite right . I said ' Do n't , ' as involuntarily as one would say ' Do n't ' to a threatened blow . "
1428	1435	1437	1438	the Boy	129	" It was n't a blow , "
1442	1476	1437	1438	the Boy	129	" It was a kiss . Every time I looked at your dear beautiful hand , lifting the silver teapot , I kissed it . Did n't you feel it was a kiss ? "
1477	1508	1342	1342	She	141	" No ; I only felt it was unusual ; something I could not understand ; and I did not like it . Therefore I said ' Do n't . ' "
1509	1517	1519	1520	the Boy	129	" But you admit it was sweet ? "
1522	1525	1527	1528	the Aunt	141	" Exactly , "
1530	1552	1527	1528	the Aunt	141	" quite incomprehensibly sweet . And I do not like things I can not comprehend ; especially with amazing boys about ! "
1553	1562	1564	1565	the Boy	129	" Did n't you know it was love ? "
1569	1572	1574	1575	the Aunt	141	" No , "
1579	1587	1574	1575	the Aunt	141	" most certainly , I did not . "
1604	1609	1610	1610	he	129	" It was love , "
1625	1634	1636	1637	the Aunt	141	" Go back to your seat at once , "
1645	1658	1660	1661	the Aunt	141	" And where does poor Mollie come in , in all this ? "
1667	1670	1672	1673	the Boy	129	" Mollie ? "
1677	1888	1672	1673	the Boy	129	" Oh , Mollie understood all right . She loves Phil , you know ; intends to stick to him , and knows you will back her . The last part of the time , I brought her notes from Phil , every day . Do n't be angry , dear . You would have done it yourself , if Mollie and Phil had got hold of you , and implored you to be a go - between . You remember the day we invaded the kitchen to see how Martha made those little puffy buns you know the explosives ? You pinch them in the middle , and they burst into hundreds and thousands of little pieces . Jolly things for a stiff stand - up - in - a - crowd - and - all - hold - your - own - cups kind of drawing - room party ; what we used to call ' a Perpendicular ' in my Cambridge days . I suppose they still keep up the name . Fancy those little buns exploding all over the place ; and when you try to pick up the fragments , they go into simply millions of crumbs , between your agitated fingers and anxious thumb ! "
1961	1968	1956	1956	she	141	" You went to the kitchen ? "
1969	1974	1976	1977	the Boy	129	" Oh , yes , "
1981	2084	1976	1977	the Boy	129	" We went to the kitchen to watch Martha make them , and to get the recipe . You see Mollie wanted them for her father 's clerical ' at homes . ' Oh , I say fancy ! The archdeacons and curates , the rectors and vicars , all standing in a solemn crowd on the Bishop 's best velvet - pile carpet ; then Mollie , so demure , handing round the innocent - looking little buns ; and , hey presto ! the pinching begins , and the explosions , and the hopeless attempts to gather up the fragments ! "
2108	2270	2284	2285	the Aunt	141	" Well , we stopped on the way to the kitchen for mutual confidences . It was not easy , bounded as we were by you on the one side , and Martha on the other . We had to whisper . I dare say you thought we were kissing behind the door , but we jolly well were n't ! She told me about Phil ; and I told her oh , I told her something of what I am trying to tell you . Just enough to make her understand ; so that we could go ahead , and play the game fair , all round . She was awfully glad , because she said : ' I have long feared my dear beautiful Aunt would marry an ichthyosaurus . ' I asked her what the what the I mean , what on earth the meaning of that was ? And she said : ' An old fossil . ' "
2296	2336	2284	2285	the Aunt	141	" I have heard you say ' What the deuce ' before now , Boy . But I am glad you appear to realize , judging by your laboured efforts to suppress them , that these expressions shock me . "
2357	2363	2364	2364	he	175	" Well , you see , "
2367	2394	2364	2364	he	175	" I am trying most awfully hard to be , in every respect , just what you would wish the man who loves you should be . "
2395	2402	2404	2405	Christobel Charteris	48	" Oh , you dear boy , "
2416	2490	2404	2405	Christobel Charteris	48	" I must make you understand that I can not possibly take you seriously . I shall have to tell you a story no one has ever heard before ; a tender little story of a long - ago past . I must tell you the story of my Little Boy Blue . Wait here a few moments , while I go indoors and give orders that we are not to be disturbed . "
2568	2570	2567	2567	her	48	" Juno "
2572	2575	2567	2567	her	48	" The Goddess "
2866	2970	2850	2850	her	53	" Mind , Auntie dear , no mistake about Guy Chelsea ! He 's a charming fellow ; and thank you ever so much for giving me such a good time with him . But you can report to Papa , that Guy Chelsea , and his beautiful properties , and his prospective peerage , and his fifty thousand a year , and his motor - cars , and his flying - machines , are absolutely powerless to tempt me away from my allegiance to Phil . Beside , it so happens , Guy himself is altogether in love with SOME ONE ELSE . "
2980	2987	2988	2988	Mollie	53	" You can report to Papa , "
3519	3526	3528	3529	Miss Charteris	48	" Why two cups , Martha ? "
3533	3541	3543	3543	Martha	56	" Maybe there 'll be a visitor , "
3562	3569	3570	3570	she	56	" Maybe there is a visitor , "
3625	3631	3632	3632	she	141	" How nice of you , "
3635	3717	3632	3632	she	141	" with the Attraction gone . But Martha seems to have had a premonition of your coming . She has just brought out tea , most suggestively arranged for two . How festive you are , Boy ! Why this wedding attire ? Are you coming from , or going to , a function ? No ? Then do n't you want tennis after tea a few good hard sets ; just we two , unhandicapped by our dear little Mollie ? "
3718	3721	3723	3724	the Boy	129	" No , "
3726	3752	3723	3724	the Boy	129	" talk , please , to - day ; just we two , unhandicapped by our dear little Mollie . Talk please ; not tennis . "
3766	3782	3783	3783	he	129	" How jolly those little what - d'-you - call-'ems look , in the sunshine , "
3818	3822	3823	3823	she	141	" Boy dear , "
3826	3877	3823	3823	she	141	" you are a dandy in the matter of ties and buttonholes ; only it is so essentially you , that one rather enjoys it . But this is the first day I have known you to arrive without one , and have need to fall back upon my garden . "
3878	3885	3887	3888	the Boy	129	" It is a first day , "
3904	3935	3887	3888	the Boy	129	" It starts a new r≈•gime , in the matter of buttonholes , and other things . I am going to have seven days , and this is the first . "
3936	3939	3941	3942	the Aunt	141	" Really ? "
3952	3994	3941	3942	the Aunt	141	" I am flattered that you should spend a portion of ' the first day ' with me . Let us have tea , and then you shall tell me why seven days ; and where you mean to pass them . "
4097	4105	4114	4114	her	141	" It was always you I wanted , "
4265	4275	4276	4276	she	141	" I am going to tell you a story , "
4279	4282	4284	4285	the Boy	129	" Yes ? "
4287	4296	4276	4276	she	141	" It is about my Little Boy Blue . "
4297	4300	4276	4276	she	141	" Yes ? "
4301	4309	4276	4276	she	141	" You were my Little Boy Blue . "
4310	4313	4276	4276	she	141	" I ? "
4314	4321	4276	4276	she	141	" Yes ; twenty years ago . "
4322	4328	4330	4331	the Boy	129	" Then I was six , "
4336	4374	4276	4276	she	141	" We were staying at Dovercourt , on the east coast . Our respective families had known each other . I used to watch you playing on the shore . You were a very tiny little boy . "
4375	4387	4389	4390	the Boy	129	" I dare say I was quite a nice little boy , "
4394	4414	4276	4276	she	141	" Indeed you were ; quite sweet . You wore white flannel knickers , and a little blue coat . "
4415	4427	4429	4430	the Boy	129	" I dare say it was quite a nice little coat , "
4432	4449	4429	4430	the Boy	129	" and I hope my womenfolk had the tact to call it a ' blazer . ' "
4450	4464	4466	4467	the Aunt	141	" It was a dear little coat I should say ' blazer , ' "
4469	4510	4466	4467	the Aunt	141	" and I called you my ' Little Boy Blue . ' You also had a blue flannel cap , which you wore stuck on the back of your curls . I spoke to you twice , Little Boy Blue . "
4511	4515	4516	4516	he	129	" Did you ? "
4526	4540	4520	4520	his	129	" Then no wonder I feel I have loved you all my life . "
4541	4691	4692	4693	The Aunt	141	" Ah , but wait until you hear my story ! The first time I spoke to you , it happened thus . Your nurse sat high up on the beach , in the long line of nurses , gossiping and doing needlework . You took your little spade and bucket , and marched away , all by yourself , to a breakwater ; and there you built a splendid sand castle . I sat on the breakwater , higher up , and watched you . You took immense pains ; you overcame stupendous difficulties ; and every time your little cap fell off , you picked it up , dusted off the sand with the sleeve of your little blue coat , and stuck it on the back of your curly head again . You were very sweet , Little Boy Blue . I can see you now . "
4739	4742	4744	4745	the Aunt	141	" Presently , "
4747	4975	4744	4745	the Aunt	141	" your castle and courtyard finished , you made a little cannon in the centre of the courtyard , for defence . Then you looked around for a cannon - ball . This was evidently a weighty matter , and indeed it turned out to be such . You stood your spade against the breakwater ; placed your bucket beside it ; readjusted your little cap , and trotted off almost to the water 's edge . Your conception of the size of your castle and cannon must have become magnified with every step of those small sturdy feet , for , arrived at the water , you found a huge round stone nearly as large as your own little head . This satisfied you completely , but you soon found you could not carry it in your hands . You spent a moment in anxious consideration . Then you took off your little blue coat , spread it upon the sand , rolled the cannon - ball upon it , tied the sleeves around it , picked up the hem and the collar , hoisted the heavy stone , and proceeded slowly and with difficulty up the shore . Every moment it seemed as if the stone must fall , and crush the bare toes of my Little Boy Blue . So I flew to the rescue .
4976	4996	4698	4698	her	141	" ' Little Boy Blue , ' I said , ' may I help you to carry your stone ? '
4997	5094	4744	4745	the Aunt	141	" You paused , and looked up at me . I doubt if you had breath to answer while you were walking . Your little face was flushed and damp with exertion ; the blue cap was almost off ; you had sand on your eyebrows , and sand on your little straight nose . But you looked at me with an expression of indomitable courage and pride , and you said : ' Fanks ; but I always does my own cawwying . ' With that you started on , and I fell behind rebuffed ! "
5095	5100	5102	5103	the Boy	129	" Surly little beast ! "
5105	5110	5112	5113	the Aunt	141	" Not at all , "
5115	5140	5112	5113	the Aunt	141	" I wo n't have my Little Boy Blue called names ! He showed a fine independence of spirit . Now hear what happened next .
5141	5512	4744	4745	the Aunt	141	" Little Boy Blue had almost reached his castle , with his somewhat large , but otherwise suitable , cannon - ball , when his nurse , glancing up from her needlework , perceived him staggering along in his shirt - sleeves , and also saw the use to which he was putting his flannel coat . She threw aside the blue over - all she was making , rushed down the shore , calling my Little Boy Blue every uncomplimentary compound noun and adjective which entered her irate and flurried mind ; seized the precious stone , unwound the little jacket , flung the stone away , shook out the sand and seaweed , and straightened the twisted sleeves . Then she proceeded to shake the breath out of my Little Boy Blue 's already rather breathless little body ; put on the coat , jerked him up the shore , and plumped him down with his back to the sea and his castle , to sit in disgrace and listen , while she told the assembled nurses what a ' born himp of hevil ' he was ! I could have slain that woman ! And I knew my little Boy Blue had no dear mother of his own . I wanted to take him in my arms , smooth his tumbled curls , and comfort him . And all this time he had not uttered a sound . He had just explained to me that he always did his own carrying , and evidently he had learned to bear his childish sorrows in silence . I watched the little disconsolate blue back , usually so gaily erect , now round with shame and woe . Then I bethought me of something I could do . I made quite sure he was not peeping round . Then I went and found the chosen stone , and it was heavy indeed ! I carried it to the breakwater , and deposited it carefully within the courtyard of the castle . Then I sat down behind the breakwater , on the other side , and waited . I felt sure Little Boy Blue would come back for his spade and bucket .
5513	5672	5112	5113	the Aunt	141	" Presently the nurses grew tired of bullying him . The strength of his quiet non - resistance proved greater than their superior numbers and brute force . Also his intelligent little presence was , undoubtedly , a check upon their gossip . So he was told he might go ; I conclude , on the understanding that he should ' be a good boy ' and carry no more ' nasty heavy stones . ' I saw him rise and shake the dust of the nurses ' circle off his little feet ! Then he pushed back his curls , and , without looking to the right or to the left , trotted straight to his castle . I wondered he did not glance , however hopelessly , in the supposed direction of the desired stone . But , no ! He came gaily on ; and the light of a great expectation shone in his brown eyes .
5673	5752	4744	4745	the Aunt	141	" When he reached the breakwater , and found his castle , there safely in the courtyard reposed the mighty cannon - ball . He stood still a moment , looking at it ; and his cheeks went very pink . Then he pulled off his little cap , and turned his radiant face up to the blue sky , flecked with fleeting white clouds . And ' Fank de Lord , ' said my Little Boy Blue . "
5802	5806	5807	5807	he	129	" I remember , "
5810	6105	5807	5807	he	129	" Why , of course I remember ! Not you , worse luck ; but being lugged up the shore , and fearing I had lost my cannon - ball . And , you know , as quite a tiny chap , I had formed a habit of praying about all my little wants and woes . I sometimes think , how amused the angels must have been when my small petitions arrived . There was a scarecrow , in a field , I prayed for , regularly , every night , for weeks . I had been struck by the fact that it looked lonely . Then I seriously upset the theology of the nursery , by passing through a course of persistent and fervent prayer for Satan . It appeared as an obvious logical conclusion to my infant mind : that if the person who according to nurse spent all his time in going about making everybody naughty , could himself become good , all naughtiness would cease . Also , that anybody must be considered as ' past praying for , ' was an idea which nearly broke my small heart With rage and misery , when it was first crudely forced upon me . I think the arch - fiend must have turned away , silent and nonplussed , if he ever chanced to pass by , while a very tiny boy was kneeling up in his crib , pleading with tearful earnestness : ' Please God , bless poor old Satan ; make him good an ' happy ; an ' take him back to heaven . ' But it used to annoy nurse considerably , when she came into the same prayer , with barely a comma between . "
6106	6114	6116	6117	the Aunt	141	" Oh , my Little Boy Blue ! "
6119	6127	6116	6117	the Aunt	141	" Why was I not your mother ! "
6128	6136	6138	6139	the Boy	129	" Thank goodness , you were not ! "
6143	6162	6138	6139	the Boy	129	" I do n't want you for a mother , dear . I want you for my wife . "
6163	6172	6174	6175	the Aunt	141	" So you had prayed about the stone ? "
6179	6273	6116	6117	the Aunt	141	" Yes . While seated there in disgrace , I said : ' Please God , let an angel find my cannon - ball , which howwid old nurse fwowed away . An ' let the angel cawwy it safe to the courtyard of my castle . ' And I was not at all surprised to find it there ; merely very glad . So you see , Christobel , you were my guardian angel twenty years ago . No wonder I feel I have known and loved you , all my life . "
6274	6328	6116	6117	the Aunt	141	" Wait until you hear the rest of my story , Little Boy Blue . But I can testify that you were not surprised . Your brown eyes were simply shining with faith and expectation , as you trotted down the shore . But who said you might call me ' Christobel ' ? "
6329	6333	6335	6336	the Boy	129	" No one , "
6338	6431	6335	6336	the Boy	129	" I thought of it myself . It seemed so perfect to be able to say it on the first of my seven days . And , if you consider , I have never called you ' Miss Charteris . ' You always seemed to me much too splendid to be ' Miss ' anything . One might as well say ' Miss Joan of Arc ' or ' Miss Diana of the Ephesians . ' But of course I wo n't call you ' Christobel ' if you would rather not . "
6432	6438	6440	6441	the Aunt	141	" You quite absurd boy ! "
6445	6473	6440	6441	the Aunt	141	" Call me anything you like just for your seven days . But you have not yet told me the meaning or significance of these seven days . "
6481	6487	6488	6488	he	129	" It 's like this , "
6491	6694	6488	6488	he	129	" I have always loved the story of how the army of Israel marched round Jericho during seven days . It appeals to me . The well - garrisoned , invincible city , with its high walls and barred gates . The silent , determined army , marching round it , once every day . Apparently nothing was happening ; but , in reality , their faith , enthusiasm , and will - power were undermining those mighty walls . And on the seventh day , when they marched round seven times to the blast of the priestly trumpets ; at the seventh time , the ordeal of silence was over ; leave was given to the great silent host to shout . So the rams ' horns sounded a louder blast than ever ; and then , with all the pent - up enthusiasm born of those seven days of silent marching , the people shouted ! Down fell the walls of Jericho , and up the conquerors went , right into the heart of the citadel .... I am prepared to march round in silence , during seven days ; but on the seventh day , Jericho will be taken . "
6695	6703	6705	6706	the Aunt	141	" I being Jericho , I conclude , "
6710	6758	6705	6706	the Aunt	141	" I can not say I have particularly noticed the silence . But that part of the programme would be decidedly dull ; so we will omit it , and say , from the first : ' little Boy Blue , come blow me your horn ! ' "
6759	6772	6774	6775	the Boy	129	" I shall blow it all right , on the seventh day , "
6777	6788	6774	6775	the Boy	129	" and when I do , you will hear it . "
6805	6818	6819	6819	he	129	" I shall walk right up into the heart of the citadel , "
6822	6879	6819	6819	he	129	" when the gates fly open , and the walls fall down ; and there I shall find you , my Queen ; and together we shall ' inherit the kingdom . ' O dear unconquered Citadel ! O beautiful , golden kingdom ! Do n't you wish it was the seventh day now , Christobel ? "
6893	6896	6887	6887	he	129	" Christobel , "
6914	6926	6927	6927	she	141	" Go back to your chair , at once , Boy , "
7330	7334	7335	7335	she	141	" Boy dear , "
7344	7372	7335	7335	she	141	" come down from the clouds , and listen to me . I want to tell you the rest of the story of my Little Boy Blue . "
7545	7552	7554	7555	the Aunt	141	" Now I must tell you , "
7557	7796	7554	7555	the Aunt	141	" of the only other time when I ventured to speak to my Little Boy Blue . He had come to his favourite place beside the breakwater . The tide had long ago swept away castle , courtyard , and cannon ; but the cannon - ball was still there . It partook of the nature of ' things that remain . ' Heavy stones usually do ! When I peeped over the breakwater , Little Boy Blue was sitting on the sand . His sturdy legs were spread wide . His bare toes looked like ten little pink sea - shells . Between his small brown knees , he had planted his bucket . His right hand wielded a wooden spade , on the handle of which was writ large , in blue pencil : Master Guy Chelsea . He was bent upon filling his bucket with sand . But the spade being long , and the bucket too close to him Boy , leave my shoe alone ! It does not require attention most of the sand missed the bucket , and went over himself . I heard him sigh rather wearily , and say ' Blow ! ' in a tired little voice . I leaned over the breakwater . ' Little Boy Blue , ' I said , ' may I play with you , and help you to fill your bucket with sand ? '
7797	7895	7982	7983	the Aunt	141	" Little Boy Blue looked up . His curls , his eyebrows , his long dark eyelashes were full of sand . There was sand on his little straight nose . But no amount of sand could detract from the dignity of his little face , or weaken its stern decision . He laid down his spade , put up a damp little hand , and , lifting his blue cap to me , said : ' Fanks ; but I do n't like girls . ' Oh , Master Guy Chelsea , how you snubbed me ! "
7937	7949	7950	7950	he	129	" Poor kind - hearted , well - meaning little girl , "
7953	7973	7950	7950	he	129	" But she must admit , little girls of seven are not always attractive to small boys of six . "
7974	7980	7982	7983	the Aunt	141	" I was not seven , "
7989	8010	7982	7983	the Aunt	141	" Leave go of my hand , Boy , and listen . When you were six , I was sixteen . "
8045	8072	8038	8039	the Boy	129	" And what of that , dear ? When I was six , you were sixteen . When I was twenty , you were twenty - nine "
8073	8098	7950	7950	he	129	" Thirty , Boy ; thirty ! Be accurate . And now you are twenty - six , and I am getting on towards forty "
8099	8113	8115	8116	the Boy	129	" Thirty - six , dear , thirty - six ! Be accurate ! "
8118	8153	7950	7950	he	129	" And when you are forty , I shall be fifty ; and when you are fifty , Boy only fifty ; a man is in his prime at fifty I shall be sixty . "
8154	8161	8163	8164	the Boy	129	" And when I am eighty , "
8166	8356	8163	8164	the Boy	129	" you will be ninety an old lady is in her prime at ninety . What a charming old couple we shall be ! I wonder if we shall still play tennis . I think quite the jolliest thing to do , when we are very very old quite decrepit , you know will be to stay at Folkestone , and hire two bath - chairs , with nice active old men to draw them ; ancient , of course , but they would seem young compared to us ; and then make them race on the Leas , a five - pound note to the winner , to insure them really galloping . We would start at the most crowded time , when the band was playing , and race in and out among lots of other bath - chairs going slowly , and simply terrified at us . Let 's be sure and remember to do it , Christobel , sixty years from to - day . Have you a pocket - book ? I shall be a gay young person of eighty - six , and you "
8357	8361	8362	8362	she	284	" Boy dear , "
8376	8611	8373	8373	her	284	" you must be serious and listen . When I have said that which I must say , you will understand directly that it is no use having your seven days . It will be better and wiser to raise the siege at once , and march away . Listen ! ... Hush , stay perfectly still . No ; I can say what I am going to say more easily if you do n't look at me .... Please , Boy ; please .... I told you my ' Little Boy Blue stories ' to make you realize how very much older I am than you . I was practically grown up , when you were still a dear delightful baby . I could have picked you up in my arms and carried you about . Oh , can not you see that , however much I loved him perhaps I should rather say : just because I love him , because I have always wanted to help him carry his heavy stones ; make the best of his life , and accomplish manfully the tasks he sets himself to do I could not possibly marry my Little Boy Blue ? I could not , oh I could not , let him tie his youth and brightness to a woman , staid and middle - aged , who might almost be his mother ! "
8725	8728	8730	8731	the Boy	129	" Dear , "
8735	9147	8730	8731	the Boy	129	" your little stories might possibly have had the effect you intended specially the place where you paused and gazed at me as if you saw me still with sand upon my nose , and ten pink toes like sea - shells ! That was calculated to make any chap feel youngish , and a bit shy . Was n't it ? Yes ; they might have told the way you meant , were it not for one dear sentence which overshadows all the rest . You said just now : ' I knew my little Boy Blue had no mother . I wanted to take him in my arms , smooth his curls , and comfort him . ' Christobel , that dear wish of yours was a gift you then gave to your Little Boy Blue . You ca n't take it away now , because he has grown bigger . He still has no mother , no sisters , no near relations in the world . That all holds good . Can you refuse him the haven , the help , the comfort you would have given him then , now when at last he is old enough to know and understand ; to turn to them , in grateful worship and wonder ? Would you have me marry a girl as feather - brained , as harum - scarum , as silly as I often am myself ? You suggest Mollie ; but the Boy Blue of to - day agrees with his small wise self of twenty years ago and says : ' Fanks , but I do n't like girls ! ' Oh , Christobel , I want a woman 's love , a woman 's arms , a woman 's understanding tenderness ! You said , just now , you wished you had been my mother . Does not the love of the sort of wife a fellow really wants , have a lot of the mother in it too ? I 've been filled with such a glory , Christobel , since you admitted what you felt for your Little Boy Blue because I seemed to know , somehow , that having once felt it , though the feeling may have gone to sleep , you could never put it quite away . But , if your Little Boy Blue came back , from the other end of the world , and wanted you "
9503	9506	9468	9468	she	291	" Fanks , "
9524	9535	9468	9468	she	291	" Fanks , but I always does my own cawwying . "
9543	9547	9548	9548	she	291	" Boy dear , "
9553	9562	9548	9548	she	291	" please go now . I am tired . "
9649	9659	9672	9674	the elderly housekeeper	308	" Through much tribulation , enter into the kingdom . "
9737	9744	9745	9745	she	56	" Lord love ' i m ! "
9748	9776	9745	9745	she	56	" He 'll get what he wants in time . There 's not a woman walks this earth as could n't never refuse ' i m nothing . "
9863	9875	9895	9895	He	129	" And the evening and the morning were the first day . "
10307	10316	10305	10305	Jenkins	60	" bucked up and looked like a bridegroom , "
10419	10429	10411	10411	he	129	" I , Martha , take thee , Jenkins , "
10457	10467	10439	10440	Miss Charteris	48	" I , Martha , take thee , Noah . "
10588	10595	10597	10598	the Boy	129	" It is a bit wispy , "
10602	10611	10597	10598	the Boy	129	" Why do n't you tell her so ? "
10616	10643	10612	10613	Miss Charteris	48	" Boy dear , I dare n't ! It would be as much as my place is worth , to make a personal observation to Martha ! "
10644	10656	10658	10659	the Boy	129	" I 'll tell her for you , if you like , "
10663	10668	10670	10671	Miss Charteris	48	" If you do , "
10673	10692	10670	10671	Miss Charteris	48	" it will be the very last remark you will ever make in Martha 's kitchen , Boy . "
10693	10702	10704	10705	the Boy	129	" Oh , there are ways of telling , "
10921	10925	10926	10926	she	48	" Boy dear ! "
10940	10951	10926	10926	she	48	" I 'm afraid you 're lazy to - day ! "
10968	10974	10975	10975	he	129	" I 'm not lazy , "
10978	11008	10975	10975	he	129	" but I 'm on the wrong side of Jordan . This sort of thing is waste of time . I want to go over , and start marching . "
11009	11036	10965	10965	his	129	" Do n't be absurd , Boy . I prefer this side Jordan , thank you ; and you shall stay here until you beat me . "
11120	11203	11117	11117	she	48	" Boy , when you were at Trinity , I often used to see you . I knew you were my Little Boy Blue of all those years ago . I used to feel inclined to send for you , talk to you for your good , and urge you to set to , and do great things ; but I remembered the stone , and the bucket ; and I did not want to let myself in for a third snubbing . "
11208	11217	11218	11218	he	129	" Did you think me a lazy beggar ? "
11221	11288	11218	11218	he	129	" I was n't really , you know . I did quite a good deal of all kinds of things . But I did n't want to get played out . I wanted to do things all the rest of my life . Fellows who grind at college and come out Senior Wranglers , begin and end there . You do n't hear of 'em again . "
11289	11293	11300	11300	her	48	" I see , "
11303	11315	11300	11300	her	48	" So you felt it wisest to avoid being Senior Wrangler ? "
11316	11320	11322	11323	the Boy	129	" Just so , "
11325	11364	11322	11323	the Boy	129	" I was content with a fairly respectable B.A. and I hope you saw me take it . How rotten it is , going up in a bunch , all hanging on to an old chap 's fingers . "
11365	11433	11434	11435	The Boy	129	" Boy , Boy ! I know all about you ! You wasted golden opportunities ; you declined to use your excellent abilities ; you gave the authorities an anxious time . You were so disgracefully popular , that everybody thought your example the finest thing to follow , and you were more or less responsible for every lark and row which took place during your time . "
11459	11462	11463	11463	he	129	" Dear , "
11466	11645	11463	11463	he	129	" I had plenty of money , and heaps of friends , and I wanted to have a good time . Also I wanted all the other fellows to have a good time ; and I enjoyed getting the better of all the old fogies who had forgotten what youth was like if they 'd ever known it . And I had no mother to ask me questions , and no sisters to turn up at my rooms unexpectedly . But I can tell you this , Christobel . I hope to be married soon ; and I hope to marry a woman so sweet and noble and pure , that her very presence tests a man 's every thought , feeling , and memory . And I can honestly look into your dear eyes and say : My wife will be welcome to know every detail of every prank I ever played in Cambridge ; nor is there a thing in those three years I need feel ashamed of her knowing . There ! Will that do ? "
11654	11660	11661	11661	she	48	" Oh , Boy dear ! "
11664	11715	11661	11661	she	48	" I never doubted that . My Little Boy Blue , do n't I know you ? But I can not let you talk as if you owe me any explanations . How curious to think I saw you so often during those years , yet we never actually met . "
11720	11723	11724	11724	he	129	" Yes , "
11727	11747	11724	11724	he	129	" we were all awfully proud of you , you know . What was it you took at Girton ? "
11781	11784	11785	11785	he	129	" Yes , "
11788	11851	11785	11785	he	129	" we were awfully proud of it , because of your tennis , and because of you being well , just you . If you had been a round - shouldered little person in a placket , we should have taken it differently . We always called you ' The Goddess , ' because of your splendid walk . Did you know ? "
11852	11926	11766	11767	The Boy	52	" No , Boy , I did not know ; but I confess to feeling immensely flattered . Only , take a friend 's advice , and avoid conversational allusions to plackets , because you are obviously ignorant of the meaning of the word . And now , tell me ? Having successfully escaped so serious a drawback to future greatness as becoming Senior Wrangler , on what definite enterprise have you embarked ? "
11927	11930	11932	11933	the Boy	129	" Flying , "
11941	12150	11932	11933	the Boy	129	" I am going to break every record . I am going to fly higher , farther , faster , than any man has ever flown before . This week , if I had not stayed on here you know originally I came up only for the ' May week ' I was to have done a Channel flight . Ah , you do n't know what it means , to own three flying - machines , all of different make , and each the best of its kind ! You feel you own the world ! And then to climb into your seat and go whirling away , with the wonderful hum in your ears , mastering the air the hitherto invincible air . May I tell you what I am going to do for my next fly ? Start from the high ground between Dover and Folkestone ; fly over the Channel ; circle round Boulogne Cathedral you remember the high dome , rising out of the old town surrounded by the ramparts ? Then back across the Channel , and to ground again at Folkestone ; all in one flight ; and I hope to do it in record time , if winds are right . "
12151	12194	12263	12263	him	129	" And if winds are wrong , Boy ? If you rush out and take the horrid risks of the cross - currents you told us about ? If something happens to your propeller , and you fall headlong into the sea ? "
12195	12205	12207	12208	the Boy	129	" Oh , it 's all U P then , "
12212	12258	12207	12208	the Boy	129	" But one never expects that sort of thing to happen ; and when it does , all is over so quickly that there is no time for anticipation . Beside , there must be pioneers . Every good life given , advances the cause . "
12346	12350	12351	12351	she	372	" Boy dear , "
12356	12407	12351	12351	she	372	" Has it ever struck you that , if you marry , your wife whoever she might be would most probably want you to give up flying ? I can not imagine a woman being able to bear that a man who was her all , should do these things . "
12431	12439	12440	12440	he	129	" Why , of course , dear , "
12443	12581	12440	12440	he	129	" if you wished it , I should give up flying , like a shot , and sell my aeroplanes . I know plenty of chaps who would like to buy them to - morrow . And I 'll tell you what we would do . We 'd buy the biggest , most powerful motor - car we could get , and we 'd tear all over the country , exceeding the speed - limit , and doing everything jolly we could think of . That would be every bit as good as flying , if if we did it together . I say , Christobel do you know how to make a sentence of ' together ' ? Just three words : to get her ! That 's what ' together ' spells for me now . "
12586	12634	12582	12583	Miss Charteris	48	" You might have taken honours in spelling , Boy . And I am not the sort of person who enjoys exceeding speed - limits . Also I am afraid I have a troublesome habit of always wanting to stop and see all there is to see . "
12642	12751	12636	12637	the Boy	129	" Oh , we would n't exceed the speed - limit much . And we would stop everywhere , and see everything . You should breakfast in London ; lunch at the Old White Horse , Mr. Pickwick 's inn at Ipswich ; have tea at the Maid 's Head , beneath the shadow of Norwich Cathedral , where you could wash your hands in Queen Elizabeth 's fusty old bedroom what a lot of bedrooms Queen Elizabeth slept in , and made them all fusty and have time to show me Little Boy Blue 's breakwater at Dovercourt , before dinner . There 's nothing like motoring ! "
12752	12759	12761	12762	Miss Charteris	48	" It sounds interesting , certainly , "
12764	12768	12770	12771	the Boy	129	" And then , "
12781	13067	12770	12771	the Boy	129	" it 's less expensive than flying . You run through fifty thousand a year in no time with aeroplanes . And of course we should want to open both my places . I 'm awfully glad I did n't let the tenants in the old home renew their lease . As it is , they turn out in three months . Oh , I say , Christobel , I do believe it is a setting worthy of you . Have you ever seen it ? The great hall , the old pictures , the oak staircase I once rode down it on my rocking - horse and came to utter smash . And outside the park , the lake , the beech avenue , the rose - garden , the peacocks . And a funny little old village belongs to us . Think how the people must want looking after . I believe you would like it all I really believe you would ! And think , ah , just think what it would be to me , to see my own splendid wife , queen over everything in my dear jolly old home ! Hullo ! Hark to all the clocks ! What is that striking ? Seven ? Oh , I say ! I 'm dining with the Master to - night . I must rush off , and change . Though I was such a bad lot , they all seem quite pleased to see me again . Really they do ! Have I stayed too long ? ... Sure ? ... May I come to - morrow ? ... You are most awfully good to me . Good - bye . "
13461	13467	13468	13468	he	129	" That was all right , "
13471	13581	13468	13468	he	129	" I jolly well worked that all right ! There was nothing to frighten her to - day not a thing . Dear lips ! They never trembled once ; and no more turning faint . And , my Goody , how she lectured me ! I wonder who 's been telling her what . I know why she did it too . She wanted to feel quite sure she was bossing the show . And so she was , bless her ! But I marched round ! Yes , I jolly well marched round .... Oh , I say ! Ca n't you stop where I put you ? "
13622	13634	13638	13639	THE BOY	52	" And the evening and the morning were the second day . "
13969	13972	13954	13954	himself	129	" Zenith , "
14089	14091	14092	14092	Martha	56	" bubbles "
14135	14140	14141	14141	he	129	" Martha , my duck "
14148	14159	14145	14145	Martha	56	" Bless us , Mr. Guy ! What a name ! "
14160	14168	14170	14171	the Boy	129	" What 's the matter with it ? "
14175	14187	14170	14171	the Boy	129	" I consider it a very nice name , and scriptural . "
14188	14200	14202	14202	Martha	56	" Oh , I did n't mean m ' own name , "
14214	14232	14202	14202	Martha	56	" Not but what m ' godfathers and godmothers might well ' ave chosen me a better . "
14233	14245	14247	14248	the Boy	129	" Oh , do n't blame them , overmuch , Martha , "
14252	14315	14247	14248	the Boy	129	" You see their choice was limited . If you study your catechism you will find that it had to be ' N ' or ' M ' ' Naomi ' or ' Martha . ' Even at that early age , they thought you favoured ' Martha ' rather than ' Naomi ' ; so they named you ' Martha . ' "
14316	14321	14323	14324	Mrs. Jenkins	60	" Well I never ! "
14326	14381	14323	14324	Mrs. Jenkins	60	" ' N ' or ' M ' ! So it is ! Now I never noticed that before . We live and learn ! And Jenkins silly man ' as always bin annoyed that they named ' i m ' Noah . ' But how about when you was christened , Mr. Guy ? "
14382	14385	14387	14388	the Boy	129	" Oh , "
14397	14462	14387	14388	the Boy	129	" I was christened a bit later than you , Martha ; and , by that time , Parliament had sat in solemn convocation , and had brought in a Bill to the effect that all needless and vexatious limitations and restrictions in the Prayer Book might for the future be disregarded . The first to go was ' N ' or ' M. ' "
14463	14469	14471	14471	Martha	56	" Well , I never ! "
14473	14486	14471	14471	Martha	56	" I wish they 'd ha ' done it afore my time . "
14487	14491	14493	14494	the Boy	129	" You see , "
14517	14574	14493	14494	the Boy	129	" you see , Martha , those progressive Bills , intimately affecting the whole community , of vital importance to the nation at large , are always blocked by the House of Lords . If the Commons could have had their own way , you might have been named ' Lucy ' or ' Clara . ' "
14575	14591	14593	14594	Mrs. Jenkins	60	" I do n't incline to ' Lucy ' or ' Clara , ' sir , "
14598	14685	14593	14594	Mrs. Jenkins	60	" being , as they always strikes me , sickly story - book sort of names ; but I do like justice and a free country ! I always have felt doubtful o ' them Lords , since I listened to my married niece 's husband , a very respectable journeyman tailor but mostly out of work ; and if it 's their doing that I 'm ' Martha , ' well , I shall know what to do with Jenkins 's vote that 's all ! "
14694	14757	14686	14687	The Boy	129	" Martha , you ought to be put up to speak at political meetings . That 's the whole thing in a nutshell : cause , effect , results , arguments , everything ! Oh , my wig ! Yes , they are a lot of old stick - in - the - muds in the Upper House , are n't they ? "
14797	14899	14908	14908	she	428	" a rotten lot of old stick - in - the - muds , Martha ; but I think they did well by you . I 'd give them the benefit of Jenkins 's vote . I really would . I am glad they chose ' M , ' not ' N. ' Naomi was a widow and dismal . She never made the smallest effort to buck up . But Martha was a nice person ; a bit flurried perhaps , and hot - tempered ; but well up in cooking , and keen on it . I like Martha . "
14938	14954	14956	14956	Martha	56	" It was n't m ' own name surprised me , Mr. Guy , sir , "
14960	14971	14956	14956	Martha	56	" it was the name you was pleased to hadd . "
14978	15086	14975	14975	himself	129	" Eh , what ? Oh , ' Martha , my duck ' ? I see . I hope you do n't mind , Martha . It seemed to me rather a suitable and pretty addition to ' Martha . ' You see , yours is a name which can not be shortened when one feels affectionate . ' Sarah ' can be ' Sally ' ; ' Amelia ' can be ' Milly ' ; ' Caroline ' can be ' Carrie ' ; but ' Martha ' remains ' Martha ' however loving people feel . What does Jenkins call you when he feels affectionate ? "
15090	15097	15098	15098	she	56	" Jenkins knows ' is place , "
15115	15121	15123	15124	the Boy	129	" Jenkins is a model , "
15170	15180	15181	15181	she	56	" What do you call her , Mr. Guy ? "
15201	15204	15206	15207	the Boy	129	" Her ? "
15229	15237	15238	15238	he	129	" I call her ' Christobel , ' "
15275	15309	15263	15263	She	56	" Mr. Guy , sir , I suppose you do n't I suppose you do that is to say , sir Do you call her what you 've been pleased to call me ? "
15310	15315	15317	15318	the Boy	129	" Eh , what ? "
15322	15353	15317	15318	the Boy	129	" Oh , I see . ' Christobel , my ' Oh , no , Martha . No , I do n't ! Not even when I feel most affectionate . "
15385	15431	15375	15375	He	129	" ' Christobel , my duck ! ' Oh , lor ! ' Christobel , my duck ! ' I hope I shall be able to resist telling her . I should have to own I had called Martha so . ' Christobel , my ' "
15462	15468	15469	15469	he	129	" Martha , my duck , "
15472	15503	15469	15469	he	129	" to return to the original opening of this conversation : has Jenkins ever told you what a nice little wisp of hair you have , behind your left ear ? "
15504	15510	15512	15512	Martha	56	" Get along , sir ! "
15517	15525	15512	15512	Martha	56	" You 're making game of me . "
15526	15533	15535	15536	the Boy	129	" Indeed , I 'm not , "
15540	15580	15535	15536	the Boy	129	" If you made it into a curl , Martha , and fastened it with an invisible pin , it would be quite too fascinating . You ask Jenkins . I say , Martha ? What 's a placket ? "
15581	15587	15589	15589	Martha	56	" A placket , sir , "
15607	15623	15592	15592	her	56	" a placket , sir , is a thing which shows when it should n't . "
15624	15628	15630	15631	the Boy	129	" I see , "
15633	15659	15630	15631	the Boy	129	" Then you could n't exactly go about in one . Martha , whose goloshes are those , sitting on the mat in the hall ? "
15663	15669	15670	15670	she	56	" An old woman 's , "
15680	15695	15675	15676	The Boy	129	" And does the umbrella with the waist belong to the same old woman ? "
15699	15712	15696	15696	Martha	56	" And the Professor 's cap and gown , hanging near by ? "
15716	15726	15727	15727	she	56	" ' Tain't always petticoats makes an old woman , "
15732	15742	15744	15745	the Boy	129	" Martha , you are pro - foundly right , "
15747	15755	15744	15745	the Boy	129	" Does the Professor stay to tea ? "
15756	15778	15696	15696	Martha	56	" Thank goodness no , sir . We draw the line at that , ' cept when Miss Hann comes too . "
15779	15785	15744	15745	the Boy	129	" Who is Miss Hann ? "
15786	15794	15795	15795	Martha	56	" She 's the Professor 's sister . "
15816	15827	15795	15795	Martha	56	" She 's always a - hegging of 'em on ! "
15828	15834	15836	15837	the Boy	129	" What a curious occupation , "
15845	15852	15836	15837	the Boy	129	" Does Miss Hann come often ? "
15853	15867	15744	15745	the Boy	129	" No , Mr. Guy . Thanks be , she 's a hinvalid . "
15868	15880	15836	15837	the Boy	129	" Poor Miss Hann . What 's the matter with her ? "
15884	15890	15881	15881	Martha	56	" Fancies herself too much . "
15891	15902	15744	15745	the Boy	129	" What a curious complaint . What are the symptoms ? "
15903	15912	15914	15914	Martha	56	" Fancies herself in a bath - chair , "
15918	15922	15924	15925	the Boy	129	" I see , "
15927	15971	15924	15925	the Boy	129	" Oh , poor Miss Hann ! I should feel very sick if I fancied myself in a bath - chair . I wish I could meet Miss Hann . I should like to talk to her about the hegging - on business . "
15972	15980	15982	15982	Martha	56	" You 'd make her sit up , "
15988	15996	15998	15999	the Boy	129	" Oh no , I should n't , "
16001	16030	15998	15999	the Boy	129	" That would not be kind to an invalid . I should see that she reclined , comfortably ; and then I should jolly well flatten her out . "
16104	16107	16108	16108	he	129	" Martha , "
16111	16162	16108	16108	he	129	" I want you to let me carry out the tea - tray this afternoon . She does n't know I am here . She will think it is you or Jenkins , till she looks round . Let me carry it out , Martha , there 's a duck ! "
16163	16170	16172	16172	Martha	56	" As you please , sir , "
16174	16203	16172	16172	Martha	56	" but if you want her to think it 's Jenkins , you must put it down with a clatter . It takes a man to be clumsy . "
16224	16233	16235	16235	Martha	56	" Do n't go there , Mr. Guy ! "
16237	16293	16235	16235	Martha	56	" Miss Christobel will see you , sir . This window , and the pantry , show from the garden . If you want to ' ave a look at her , go through that door into the storeroom . The Venetian blind is always down in there . There is one crack through which I "
16300	16316	16318	16319	the Boy	129	" One crack through which you think I could see ? Thank you , Martha , "
16323	16330	16318	16319	the Boy	129	" Hurry up with the tray . "
16493	16496	16497	16497	he	129	" Christobel , "
16500	16504	16497	16497	he	129	" Christobel beloved ? "
16649	16652	16653	16653	he	129	" Martha , "
16656	16759	16653	16653	he	129	" you are a jewel ! I give you leave to watch me down the lawn from the kitchen window . But when I have safely arrived , turn your attention to your own tea , or I shall look up and shake my fist at your dear nice old face . And , I say , Martha , do you ever write postcards ? Because , if you want any ha'penny stamps , you will find some on the storeroom blind . Only , do n't want them , Martha , till this week is over , and I am gone . "
16841	16844	16845	16845	she	48	" Jenkins ? "
16848	16853	16855	16856	the Boy	129	" Yes , ma'am , "
16868	16889	16903	16903	she	48	" Should any one call this afternoon , Jenkins , please remember that I am not ' at home . ' "
16890	16897	16899	16900	the Boy	129	" Hip , hip , hurrah ! "
16923	16928	16929	16929	she	48	" Oh , Boy , "
16932	16938	16929	16929	she	48	" Oh , Boy dear ! "
17008	17011	17004	17004	she	48	" Do n't "
17195	17300	17191	17192	the Boy	129	" How silly we were , the other day , to talk of the relative ages of our bodies . What do they matter ? Our souls are the real you and I. And our souls are always the same age . Some souls are old old from the first . I have seen an old soul look out of the eyes of a little child ; and I have seen a young soul dance in the eyes of an old , old woman . You and I , thank God , have young souls , Christobel , and we shall be eternally young . "
17316	17323	17325	17325	Christobel	48	" Go on , Boy dear , "
17327	17346	17325	17325	Christobel	48	" I am not sure that I agree with you ; but I like to hear you talk . "
17347	17351	17352	17352	he	129	" At first , "
17355	17569	17352	17352	he	129	" our bodies are so babyish that our souls do not find them an adequate medium of expression . But by and by our bodies grow and develop ; after which come the beautiful years of perfection , ten , twenty , thirty of them , when the young soul goes strong and gay through life , clad in the strong gay young body . Then gradually , gradually , the strong young soul , in its unwearied , immortal youth , wears out the body . The body grows old , but not the soul . Nothing can age that ; and when at last the body quite wears out , the young soul breaks free , and begins again . Youthful souls wear out their bodies quicker than old ones ; just as a strong young boy romps through a suit of clothes sooner than a weakly old man . But there is always life more abundant , and a fuller life farther on . So the mating of souls is the all - important thing ; and when young souls meet and mate , what does it matter if there be a few years ' difference in the ages of their bodies ? Their essential youthfulness will surmount all that . "
17605	17613	17614	17614	she	48	" Ah , but , Boy dear , "
17617	17715	17614	17614	she	48	" the souls express themselves their needs , their delights , their activities through the bodies . And suppose one body , in the soul - union , is wearing out sooner than the other ; that is hard on the other hard on both . Boy my Little Boy Blue shall I tell you an awful secret ? I suppose I sat too closely over my books at Girton ; I suppose I was not sufficiently careful about good print , or good light . Anyway Boy dear I have to use glasses when I read . "
17724	17736	17716	17716	She	48	" You see ? Already I am beginning to grow old . "
17880	17886	17887	17887	he	474	" Old , my Beloved ? "
17890	17985	17887	17887	he	474	" You old ! Never ! Always perfect perfect to me . And why not wear glasses ? Heaps of mere kids wear glasses , and wear them all the time . Only how alarmingly clever you must look in spectacles , Christobel . It would terrify me now ; but by and by it will make me feel proud . I think one would expect glasses to go with those awe - inspiring classical honours . With my barely respectable B.A. , I dare n't lay claim to any outward marks of erudition . "
18011	18015	18016	18016	he	474	" Dear eyes , "
18019	18026	18016	18016	he	474	" oh dear , dear eyes , "
18037	18041	18042	18042	she	48	" Do n't , "
18050	18066	18042	18042	she	48	" Ah , Boy , do n't ! You know you must not kiss me . "
18067	18071	18072	18072	he	474	" Kiss you ! "
18080	18087	18072	18072	he	474	" Do you call that kissing ? "
18103	18150	18089	18089	he	474	" Christobel , on the seventh day , when the gates fly open , and the walls fall down ; when the citadel surrenders ; when you admit you are my own then I shall kiss you ; then you will know what kissing really means . "
18337	18342	18343	18343	she	48	" Come , Boy , "
18346	18368	18343	18343	she	48	" let us walk up and down , and talk . It is enervating to sit too long in the sunshine . "
18448	18451	18452	18452	he	129	" Christobel , "
18455	18511	18452	18452	he	129	" I must go . I must go , because I dare not stay . You are so wonderful this afternoon ; so dear beyond expression . I know you trust me absolutely ; but this is only the third day ; and I can not trust myself , dear . So I 'm off ! "
18521	18529	18530	18530	he	129	" May I go , my Queen ? "
18533	18538	18539	18539	she	48	" Yes , Boy , "
18542	18545	18539	18539	she	48	" Go . "
18647	18654	18642	18643	the Boy	129	" Hip , hip , hurrah ! "
18699	18704	18705	18705	she	48	" To - morrow , "
18708	18718	18705	18705	she	48	" I must tell the Boy about the Professor . "
18887	18895	18896	18896	she	56	" What are you doing , Martha ? "
18988	18998	18999	18999	she	56	" ' E went crawlin ' about the kitchen , "
19008	19075	18999	18999	she	56	" all in ' is white flannels , puffin ' smoke in every crack an ' ' ole to kill the beetles . So kind ' e meant it ; but I could n't sleep for wonderin ' if the place was smokin ' still . I ' ad to go down an ' see . ' Ow came you to be awake , Miss Christobel ? "
19076	19103	19104	19104	Martha	56	" Things he said in the garden , Martha , have given me food for thought . I began thinking them over ; and sleep went . "
19116	19131	19132	19132	she	56	" ' E ' as a way of keepin ' one on the go , "
19135	19165	19132	19132	she	56	" but we 'd best be gittin ' to sleep now , miss . ' E'll be at it again to - morrow , bless ' is ' eart ! "
19278	19290	19256	19256	she	495	" And the evening and the morning were the third day . "
19298	19303	19305	19306	the Boy	129	" I am exhausted , "
19325	19358	19359	19359	He	129	" I am ruffled . My usual calm mental poise is overthrown and on the Sabbath , of all days ! Every feather I possess has been rubbed up the wrong way . "
19398	19427	19386	19386	Her	48	" Poor Little Boy Blue ! I thought something was wrong . I should feel a keener anxiety , were the hot buttered - toast less obviously consoling . "
19428	19437	19439	19440	the Boy	129	" I 'll jolly well never go again , "
19445	19449	19439	19440	the Boy	129	" Not me ! "
19450	19464	19466	19467	Miss Charteris	48	" Before you were born , Boy ; when I went to school , "
19469	19507	19466	19467	Miss Charteris	48	" we were taught to say ' Not I. ' And if you were to tell me where you have been , on this Sabbath afternoon , I might be able to give you more intelligent sympathy . "
19508	19519	19521	19522	the Boy	129	" I 've been to a drawing - room meeting , "
19524	19579	19521	19522	the Boy	129	" and I 've heard a woman hold forth . For an hour and a quarter , I 've sat stuffed up , breathing the atmosphere of other people 's go - to - meeting clothes , and heard a good lady go meandering on , while I had no room for my legs . "
19580	19603	19466	19467	Miss Charteris	48	" I thought you seemed finding them extra long , Boy . Why did you go to a drawing - room meeting ? "
19604	19608	19610	19611	the Boy	129	" I went , "
19613	19756	19610	19611	the Boy	129	" because the dear old thing in whose house it was held asked me to go . She used to know my mother . When I was at Trinity she looked me up , often invited me to her charming home , gave me excellent little dinners , followed by the kindest , nicest , most nervous little preachments . Do n't look amused , dear . I never failed to profit . I respected her for it . She is as good and genuine as they make 'em ; and if she had stood up this afternoon , with her friendly smile , and dear shaky old voice , and given us an exposition of the twenty - third Psalm , we should have all come away quite ' good and happy . ' Instead of which oh , my wig ! "
19772	19782	19783	19783	he	129	" The only way to manage them on Sunday , "
19793	19836	19783	19783	he	129	" when sweeping is not the right thing . But let us hope Mollie 's papa 's ' clerical brethren ' wo n't find it out . There would certainly be less conversation and fewer crumbs , but no fun at all . "
19837	19937	19610	19611	the Boy	129	" I do n't think you need be afraid , Boy dear . Even should such a way out of the difficulty occur to them , I am inclined to think they would prefer the explosion , to the whole bun at a mouthful . It has a rather startling effect , you know , until one gets used to seeing it done . I ca n't quite imagine an archdeacon doing it , while standing on the hearthrug in conversation with my brother . Now tell me what the good lady said , which you found so trying . "
19938	19945	19947	19948	the Boy	129	" Oh , she meandered on , "
19950	20082	19947	19948	the Boy	129	" She told us all we should have been , if we had not been what we were ; and all we might be , if we were not what we are ; and all we shall be , when we are not what we are ! She implored us to consider , and weigh well , where we should go , if , by a sudden and unexpected dispensation of Providence , we ceased to be where we then were . I jolly well knew the answer to that ; for if Providence had suddenly dispensated which it did n't , for a good three - quarters of an hour I should have been here , here , HERE , as fast as my best Sunday boots could carry me ! "
20088	20098	20099	20099	he	505	" Ah , think what ' here ' means , "
20102	20111	20099	20099	he	505	" Think ! ' Here ' means You ! "
20126	20135	20136	20136	He	505	" What else did she say , Boy ? "
20148	20269	20136	20136	He	505	" Ha , I have it ! I kept this tit - bit for you . She used an astronomical illustration , I have n't the least idea apropos of what , but she told us exactly how many millions of miles the sun is from the earth ; and then she smiled upon us blandly , and said : ' Or is it billions ? ' Think of that ! She said : ' Or is it billions ? ' in exactly the same tone of voice as she might have said of the bonnet she had on : ' I bought it , at a sale , for elevenpence three farthings , or was it a shilling ? ' "
20270	20288	20113	20114	Miss Charteris	48	" Oh , Boy , you really are naughty ! I never connected you with personal sarcasm . "
20289	20300	20302	20303	the Boy	129	" Yes , but that sort of woman should n't , "
20305	20325	20302	20303	the Boy	129	" And with half Cambridge sitting listening . ' Millions , or is it billions ? ' Oh lor ! "
20326	20330	20332	20333	Miss Charteris	48	" Poor thing ! "
20335	20380	20332	20333	Miss Charteris	48	" She could not have known that she had in the audience a person who had only just avoided the drawback to future enterprise , of being Senior Wrangler . Had she realized that , she would have been more careful with her figures . "
20381	20385	20387	20388	the Boy	129	" Tease away ! "
20390	20411	20387	20388	the Boy	129	" I do n't care , now I am safe here . Only I sha n't tell you any more . "
20412	20511	20332	20333	Miss Charteris	48	" I do n't want to hear any more , Boy . I always enjoy appreciations , even of things I do not myself appreciate . But non - appreciations do not appeal to me . If a person has meant to be effective and proved inadequate , or tried to do good and done harm , I would rather not know it , unless I can help to put matters right . Have some more tea , Boy ; and then I want to talk to you myself . I have something rather special to tell you . "
20554	20561	20562	20562	he	129	" I am sorry , dear , "
20567	20606	20562	20562	he	129	" I wo n't do it again . Perhaps I listened wrong , because I was bored at being there at all . I say , Christobel it has just occurred to me did you know my mother ? "
20758	20770	20942	20943	the Boy	129	" Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife ? "
20777	20783	20773	20774	the Boy	129	" Please God , I will "
20803	20929	20800	20800	Christobel	48	" Yes , Boy dear , I knew her . I have often wondered whether I might tell you . She and my mother were dear friends . I was thirteen when she died . You were three , poor Little Boy Blue ! Two things I specially remember about your mother : the peculiar radiance of her face a light from within , shining out ; and the fact that when she was in a room the whole atmosphere seemed rarefied , beautified , uplifted . I think she lived very near heaven , Boy ; and , like Enoch , she walked straight in one day , and came back no more . She ' was not ' ; for God took her . "
20948	20995	20942	20943	the Boy	129	" Some day , will you tell me heaps more details lots of little things about her ? No one ever has . But I seem almost to begin to remember her , when you talk of her . Meanwhile , may I show you this ? "
21030	21035	21036	21036	he	129	" It was hers , "
21051	21060	21039	21039	She	48	" Through faith and patience inherit the promises . "
21082	21095	21096	21096	She	48	" I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not . "
21116	21119	21096	21096	She	48	" Baby Boy "
21177	21184	21185	21185	he	129	" Write your dear name beneath , "
21208	21211	21200	21200	She	48	" Christobel . "
21212	21224	21200	21200	She	48	" And the evening and the morning were the fourth day . "
21232	21238	21240	21241	Miss Charteris	48	" Now , Sir Boy , "
21245	21398	21240	21241	Miss Charteris	48	" this is your fifth day . Our time is nearly over . You have done most of the talking . You have had things entirely your own way . What ? ... Oh , well , almost entirely your own way . I have allowed you to play your Old Testament game to your heart 's content . With commendable adaptability , I have been Jericho , and you have marched round . I have been Jericho in my own garden , and have refreshed the invading army with hot buttered - toast and explosive buns . Now it is my turn to take the initiative . Jenkins having removed the tea , and it being too hot for tennis , I am going to ask you to sit still , while I explain to you quite clearly why I must send you away at the close of the seventh day . "
21462	21477	21449	21449	she	526	" So now for a serious talk , if you please , Sir Boy . "
21478	21484	21486	21487	the Boy	129	" Excuse me , dear , "
21489	21498	21486	21487	the Boy	129	" the Israelites were not allowed to parley . "
21499	21505	21507	21508	Miss Charteris	48	" You need not parley , "
21510	21563	21507	21508	Miss Charteris	48	" you are requested merely to listen . You may smoke if you like . I understand cigarette smoke is fatal to black - beetles . Possibly it has the same effect on garden insects . Russell tells me we are overrun by snails . Smoke , Boy , if you like . "
21564	21567	21569	21570	the Boy	129	" Dear , "
21586	21610	21569	21570	the Boy	129	" I never have the smallest desire to smoke in your presence . I should feel as if I were smoking in church . "
21611	21646	21507	21508	Miss Charteris	48	" Oh , you dear amazing altogether absurd boy ! Do n't look at me like that . And do n't say such unexpected things , or I shall be unable to parley satisfactorily . "
21647	21654	21656	21657	the Boy	129	" When I went to school , "
21659	21840	21656	21657	the Boy	129	" and you were an engaging little girl in a pigtail , I was taught to say : ' Do not look at me thus ' ; at least , masters frequently appeared to think it necessary to make that remark to me . I ca n't imagine why ; because they were not specially worth looking at ; excepting that a very large person , in a very angry condition , always presented a spectacle of extreme interest to my juvenile mind . It was so fascinating to watch and see what they would do next . They were like those wooden monkeys and bears you buy in Swiss shops , do n't you know ? You pull a hanging string , and their legs and arms jump about unexpectedly . One always felt a really angry grown - up was a mere puppet . Unseen fingers were pulling the string ; and it was funny to watch . There was an exciting element of danger , too ; because sometimes a hand jerked up and boxed your ears . "
21841	21846	21847	21847	she	531	" Little Boy Blue , "
21850	21883	21847	21847	she	531	" it must have been quite impossible ever to be mildly angry with you . Either one would have waxed impotently furious ; or one would have wanted to to hug you ! "
21889	21893	21895	21896	Miss Charteris	48	" Sit down , "
21898	21971	21972	21972	She	48	" or I shall send you away . And I do not wish to do that ; because I have quite made up my mind to tell you to - day , a thing which I suppose I ought to have told you long ago ; and I tried to do so , Boy ; but somehow you always made it impossible . I want to to tell you about the Professor . "
22038	22052	22054	22055	Miss Charteris	48	" I have long felt I ought to tell you about the Professor , "
22061	22076	22077	22077	he	129	" I think I jolly well know all there is to know about professors , "
22080	22086	22088	22089	Miss Charteris	48	" Not about this one , "
22091	22097	22088	22089	Miss Charteris	48	" He is my Professor . "
22098	22107	22109	22110	the Boy	129	" Oh , if he 's your Professor , "
22115	22151	22109	22110	the Boy	129	" of course I am interested . But I am not sure that I approve of you having a tame Professor ; especially when it arrives in goloshes , and leaves them in the hall . "
22152	22200	22088	22089	Miss Charteris	48	" I am afraid nobody will ask whether you approve or not , Little Boy Blue . The Professor has been a great friend of mine during nearly twelve years ; and I think I am possibly in fact , very probably going to marry the Professor . "
22201	22204	22206	22207	the Boy	129	" Really ? "
22209	22217	22206	22207	the Boy	129	" May I ask when he proposed ? "
22218	22226	22088	22089	Miss Charteris	48	" He has not proposed , Boy . "
22245	22258	22259	22259	he	129	" Then I 'm afraid you will have some time to wait , "
22262	22273	22259	22259	he	129	" It will not be leap year again until 1912 . "
22376	22383	22384	22384	she	48	" Come here , Boy dear , "
22436	22443	22432	22432	She	48	" Take my hand , Boy . "
22488	22514	22482	22482	They	129	" Now promise me , Boy dear , that you will let me tell you all ; and that you will try not to misunderstand . "
22515	22519	22521	22522	the Boy	129	" My dearest , "
22524	22552	22521	22522	the Boy	129	" I promise . But I do not need to say I will try not to misunderstand . I could not misunderstand you , if I tried . "
22553	22563	22482	22482	They	129	" Then go back to your chair , Boy . "
22573	22677	22482	22482	They	129	" Boy , please to understand that I am not engaged to the Professor . Of course , had that been the case , I should have told you , long ago . He has never said one word to me of love or marriage . But he has been a great friend an intimate friend , intellectually ; and I have reason to know that he wishes has wished for years a good deal more than he has ever expressed to me . He has waited , Boy ; and when anybody has waited nearly twelve years , could one fail them ? "
22678	22684	22686	22687	the Boy	129	" Why , of course ! "
22691	22751	22686	22687	the Boy	129	" If a man could wait twelve years good heavens , why should n't he wait twenty ! A man has no business to wait ; or to be able to wait ; or to keep a woman waiting . Twelve years ? Oh , I say ! I did n't wait twelve days . Now , did I ? "
22755	22804	22752	22752	She	549	" You break all speed records , Boy , always . But can not you understand that all men have not fifty thousand a year , and the world at their feet ? Had you been penniless , Boy , you even you would have had to wait . "
22805	22810	22812	22813	the Boy	129	" Not a bit ! "
22817	22853	22854	22854	his	129	" I would drive a cab , I would sweep a crossing , I would do anything , or be anything ; but I would n't wait for the woman I loved ; nor would I "
22861	22871	22854	22854	his	129	" keep the woman who loved me , waiting . "
22872	22919	22752	22752	She	549	" But suppose she had a comfortable little income of her own ; and you had less much less to offer her ? Surely , Boy , proper pride would keep you from asking her to marry you , until your income at least equalled hers ? "
22920	22925	22927	22928	the Boy	129	" Not a bit ! "
22930	23045	22927	22928	the Boy	129	" That sort of rot is n't proper pride . It 's just selfish false pride . However much a woman had , when a man a man , mind you , not an old woman , or a thing with no pluck or vertebra when a man gives a woman his whole love , his whole life , the worship of his whole body , heart , and soul , he has given her that which no money could buy ; and were she a millionairess she would still be poor if , from false pride , he robbed her of that gift which was his to give her and perhaps his alone . "
23046	23050	23051	23051	she	552	" Boy dear , "
23056	23213	23051	23051	she	552	" it sounds very plausible . But it is so easy to be plausible with fifty thousand a year in the background . Let me tell you about the Professor . He has , of course , his fellowship , and is quite comfortably off now , living as a bachelor , in rooms . But he practically supports his unmarried sister , considerably older than himself , who lives in a tiny little villa , and keeps one maid . The Professor could not afford to marry , and set up a larger establishment , on his present income ; at least he apparently thinks he could not . And your theory of robbing the woman who the woman he loves , does not appear to have occurred to him . But , during all these years he has been compiling an Encyclopedia I do n't suppose you know what an Encyclopedia is , Boy . "
23214	23221	23223	23224	the Boy	129	" Oh , do n't I ? "
23226	23251	23223	23224	the Boy	129	" It 's a thing you pile up on the floor to stand upon when you want to fix a new pipe - rack . "
23262	23271	23272	23272	she	48	" The Professor is compiling a wonderful book , "
23278	23297	23272	23272	she	48	" and , when it is completed and published , he will be in a position to marry . "
23298	23305	23307	23308	the Boy	129	" Has he told you so ? "
23310	23339	23272	23272	she	48	" No , Boy . He has never mentioned the subject of marriage to me . But he has told his sister ; and she has told me . "
23340	23343	23345	23346	the Boy	129	" Ha ! "
23348	23364	23345	23346	the Boy	129	" Miss Hann , I suppose . I must say , I distrust Miss Hann . "
23365	23374	23376	23376	Christobel	48	" What do you know of Miss Ann ? "
23380	23393	23395	23396	the Boy	129	" Only that she 's always a - hegging of 'em on , "
23410	23420	23272	23272	she	48	" Boy ! You 've been gossiping with Martha . "
23421	23551	23272	23272	she	48	" I have , dear ; I admit it . You see , I arrived early , on the third day ; found the garden empty ; went gaily into the house to look for you . Ran up into the hall ; when up got a pair of old goloshes eh , what ? Oh , sorry up got a pair of new goloshes , and hit me in the eye ! A professor 's cap and gown hung up , as if at home ; and while I meditated upon these things , the voice of my Beloved was uplifted in loud and sonorous Greek , exclaiming : ' Avaunt , rash youth ! Thou impudent intruder ! ' Can you wonder that I avaunted to Martha ? "
23552	23566	23272	23272	she	48	" You will please tell me at once all Martha said to you . "
23567	23747	23272	23272	she	48	" Of course I will , dear . Do n't be vexed . I always meant to tell you , some time or other . I asked her whose were the goloshes ; the umbrella with the er decided figure ; the suspended cap and gown . Martha said they were the Professor 's . I inquired whether the Professor stayed to tea . You really ca n't blame me for asking that ; because I had gone to the kitchen for the express purpose of carrying out the tea - tray , yours and mine ; but not the Professor 's . No possible pleasure could have resulted , either to you , or to me , or to the Professor , from my unexpected appearance with the tea - tray , if the Professor had been there . Now could it ? I think it would be nice of you , dear , and only fair , if , remembering the peculiar circumstances of that afternoon , you just said : ' No ; it could n't . '
23748	23876	23272	23272	she	48	" Well , I asked Martha whether the Professor stayed to tea , and heard that ' Thank goodness , no ! ' we drew the line at that , except when Miss Hann came too . With the awful possibility of Miss Hann ' coming too , ' on one of my priceless days , I naturally desired a little light thrown on Miss Hann . I was considerably relieved to learn that Miss Hann suffers from the peculiar complaint mental , I gather of ' fancying herself in a bath - chair . ' This might be no hindrance to the ' hegging on ' propensities , but it certainly diminished the chances of the ' coming too . ' That was all , dear . "
23877	23889	23272	23272	she	48	" Boy , you ought to have been ashamed of yourself ! "
23890	23925	23272	23272	she	48	" So I was , the moment I saw you walk down the lawn . But you really need n't look so indignant . I was working for you , at the same time . "
23926	23931	23272	23272	she	48	" Working for me ? "
23932	24001	23272	23272	she	48	" Yes , dear . I told Martha her wisps would look nicer if she curled them . I also suggested ' invisible pins . ' If you like I will tell you how I came to know about ' invisible pins ' ; but it is a very long story , and not specially interesting , for the lady in the case was my great - aunt . "
24002	24007	24009	24010	Miss Charteris	48	" Oh , Boy , "
24018	24044	24016	24016	herself	48	" I wish you were the size of my Little Boy Blue on the sands at Dovercourt . I would dearly like to shake you . "
24045	24048	24049	24049	he	557	" Well , "
24052	24089	24049	24049	he	557	" you did more than shake me , just now . You gave me about the worst five minutes I ever had in my life . Christobel ? You do n't really care about the Professor ? "
24090	24110	24016	24016	herself	48	" Boy , dear , I really do . I have cared about him very much , for years . "
24111	24130	24049	24049	he	557	" Yes , as a woman loves a book ; but not as a woman loves a man . "
24131	24138	24016	24016	herself	48	" Explain your meaning , please . "
24139	24146	24148	24149	the Boy	129	" Oh , hang it all ! "
24153	24166	24148	24149	the Boy	129	" Do you love his mouth , his eyes , his hair ? "
24185	24318	24175	24176	Miss Charteris	48	" I do not know that I have ever seen his mouth ; he wears a beard . His eyes are not strong , but they look very kind through his glasses . His hair ? Well , really , he has not much to speak of . But all these things matter very little . His mind is great and beautiful ; his thoughts appeal to me . I understand his way of viewing things : he understands mine . It would be a wonderful privilege to be able to make life easy and happy for one for whom I have so profound a respect and esteem . I have looked upon it , during the last few years , as a privilege which is , eventually , to be mine . "
24319	24322	24324	24325	the Boy	129	" Christobel , "
24327	24365	24324	24325	the Boy	129	" it is wrong , it is terrible ! It is not the highest . I ca n't stand it , and I wo n't . I will not let you give yourself to a wizened old bookworm "
24366	24372	24373	24373	she	561	" Be quiet , Boy , "
24378	24435	24373	24373	she	561	" Do you wish to make me really angry ? The Professor is not old . He is only fourteen years my senior . To your extreme youth , fifty may seem old . The Professor is in his prime . I am afraid we have nothing to gain , Boy , by prolonging this discussion . "
24436	24446	24448	24449	the Boy	129	" But we ca n't leave it at this , "
24453	24460	24448	24449	the Boy	129	" Where do I come in ? "
24461	24800	24324	24325	the Boy	129	" My Little Boy Blue , I am afraid you do n't come in at all , excepting as a very sweet idyll which , all through the years to come , I shall never forget . You begged for your seven days , and I gave them . But I never led you to assume I could say ' Yes . ' Now listen , Boy , and I will tell you the honest truth . I do not know that I am ever going to marry the Professor . I only feel pledged to him from the vague belief that we each consider the other is waiting . Do n't break your heart over it , Boy ; because it is more than likely it will never come to pass . But even were there no Professor oh , Boy dear , I could not marry you . I love my Little Boy Blue more tenderly and deeply than I have ever before loved anything or any one on this earth . But I could not marry a boy , however dearly I loved him ; however sweet was his love to me . I am a woman grown , and I could surrender myself wholly , only to a man who would wholly be my mate and master . I can not pretend to call my Little Boy Blue ' the man I love , ' because he is really dearest to me when I think of him , with expectation in his baby - eyes , trotting down the sands to find his cannon - ball .... Oh , Boy , I am hurting you ! I hate to hurt you , Boy . Your love is so beautiful . Nothing as perfect will ever touch my life again . Yet I can not , honestly , give what you ask .... Boy dear , ought I to have told you , quite plainly , sooner ? If so , you must forgive me . "
24811	24819	24820	24820	he	129	" You always do the right thing , "
24823	24904	24820	24820	he	129	" and never , under any circumstances , could there be anything for me to forgive you . I have been an egregious young ass . I have taken things for granted , all along the line . What must you think of me ! Why should you care ? You , with your intellectual attainments , your honours , your high standing in the world of books ? Why should you care , Christobel ? Why should you care ? "
24943	24949	24950	24950	he	129	" Why should you care ? "
24960	24968	24969	24969	she	564	" But I do care , Boy , "
24972	24990	24969	24969	she	564	" How dare you pretend to think I do n't ? I care very tenderly and deeply . "
24991	24994	24996	24997	the Boy	129	" Pooh ! "
24999	25020	24996	24997	the Boy	129	" Do you suppose I wished you to marry a bare - toed baby , with sand on its nose ? "
25035	25097	25021	25021	He	129	" A silly little ass that said it did n't like girls ? Oh , I say ! I think it 's about time I was off . Will you walk down to the gate ? ... Thanks . You are always most awfully good to me . I say , Miss Charteris , may I ask the Professor 's name ? "
25098	25101	25102	25102	she	564	" Harvey , "
25107	25111	25102	25102	she	564	" Kenrick Harvey . "
25142	25145	25146	25146	he	129	" Harvey ? "
25149	25203	25146	25146	he	129	" Why of course I know him . He 's not much to look at , is he ? But we always thought him an awfully good sort , and kind as they make 'em . We considered him a confirmed bachelor ; but well , we did n't know he was waiting . "
25246	25251	25252	25252	he	129	" Good - bye , "
25255	25323	25252	25252	he	129	" and please forget all the rot I talked about Jericho . It goes with the spade and bucket , and all the rest . You have been most awfully kind to me , all along . But the very kindest thing you can do now , is to forget all the impossible things I thought and said ... Allow me .... I 'll shut the door . "
25350	25358	25360	25360	Christobel	48	" Boy ! Boy ! Come back , "
25419	25425	25390	25390	She	564	" what - d'-you - call-'ems "
25548	25561	25540	25542	his dead mother	571	" I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not . "
25569	25572	25566	25566	she	564	" Christobel . "
25635	25641	25642	25642	she	564	" Oh , Boy dear , "
25646	25656	25642	25642	she	564	" I love you so I love you so ! "
25657	25665	25666	25666	he	129	" I know you do , dear , "
25669	25680	25666	25666	he	129	" It 's almost unbelievable yet I know you do . "
25756	25760	25761	25761	she	564	" Boy dear , "
25764	25803	25761	25761	she	564	" not my lips , because I am not altogether yours I may have to you know ? the Professor . But , oh Boy , I ca n't help it ! I 'm afraid I care terribly . "
25835	25844	25845	25845	he	129	" Of course I would n't , Christobel , "
25848	25870	25845	25845	he	129	" not before the seventh day . But there 's a lot beside lips , and it 's all so dear . "
25890	25894	25895	25895	he	129	" Dear eyes , "
25910	25916	25895	25895	he	129	" And he kissed them again .
25940	25946	25947	25947	she	564	" Stop , Boy dear , "
25950	25959	25947	25947	she	564	" Be good now , and sit down . "
26009	26017	26018	26018	he	129	" How silly we were , dear ! "
26021	26035	26018	26018	he	129	" How silly to suppose we could part like that you and I ! "
26052	26058	26059	26059	he	129	" I say , Christobel , "
26062	26112	26059	26059	he	129	" it is all very well now to say ' Stop , and be good . ' But on the seventh day , when the walls fall down , and I march up into the citadel , I shall give you millions of kisses or will it be billions ? "
26113	26124	26125	26125	she	564	" Judging from my knowledge of you , Boy dear , "
26128	26137	26125	26125	she	564	" I rather think it would be billions . "
26234	26240	26241	26241	she	564	" Oh , Boy dear , "
26244	26286	26241	26241	she	564	" take care ! You are building castles again . They will tumble about our ears . I have n't promised you anything , Little Boy Blue of mine ; and I am afraid I shall have to marry the Professor . "
26287	26294	26295	26295	he	129	" If you do , dear , "
26298	26313	26295	26295	he	129	" I shall have to give him a new umbrella as a wedding present ! "
26369	26374	26376	26377	the Boy	129	" Oh , God , "
26383	26391	26376	26377	the Boy	129	" do n't let me lose her ! "
26419	26433	26405	26410	the friend left on the coast	581	" Arrange Channel flight , if possible , day after to - morrow . "
26434	26438	26440	26441	the Boy	129	" Not I , "
26450	26462	26440	26441	the Boy	129	" The day after to - morrow is the seventh day . "
26518	26521	26495	26498	The hall - porter	587	" urgent . "
26553	26571	26528	26529	The Boy	129	" Boy dear , I must see you at once . You will find me in the garden .
26572	26575	26528	26529	The Boy	129	" Christobel . "
26633	26639	26642	26642	their	99	" what - d'-you - call-'ems "
26755	26757	26741	26741	he	129	" urgent "
26763	26765	26741	26741	he	129	" immediate "

An ' me ' oping she 'd ' ave ' ad the sense to keep ' i m to dinner ; knowing as there was a chicking an ' ' grass for two . Now what 's took Miss Hann ' urgent and immediate , ' I 'd like to know ! "
27336	27365	27325	27325	she	56	" Ate a biscuit , I should think , an ' flown to ' er cheat . I 've no patience ; no , that I ' aven't ! "
27403	27406	27407	27407	He	607	" Immediate . "

27447	27480	27444	27444	she	56	" run ! Never mind your muffler . Who wants a muffler in June ? ' E 's in it ! It 's something more than a biscuit . Drat that woman ! "
27638	27641	27642	27642	he	607	" Christobel ? "
27647	27657	27642	27642	he	607	" Boy dear ; I am here . Come . "
27742	27747	27748	27748	he	607	" What is it ? "
27753	27786	27748	27748	he	607	" What is it , dear heart ? It is so wonderful to be wanted , and sent for . But let me know quickly that you are not in any trouble . "
27806	27824	27803	27803	she	56	" Boy , I have something to tell you . Will you help me to tell it ? "
27825	27831	27832	27832	he	607	" Of course I will , "
27835	27842	27803	27803	she	56	" How can I help best ? "
27843	27849	27850	27850	she	56	" I do n't know , "
27853	27861	27850	27850	she	56	" Oh , I do n't know ! "
27895	27903	27905	27906	the Boy	129	" What happened after I had gone ? "
27908	27966	27888	27888	her	56	" Jenkins brought me a note from Miss Harvey , asking me to come to her at once , to hear some very wonderful news , intimately affecting herself , and the Professor , and and me . She wrote very ecstatically and excitedly , poor dear . She always does . Of course , I went . "
27967	27970	27972	27973	the Boy	129	" Well ? "
28045	28051	28052	28052	he	129	" Go on , dear , "
28055	28060	28052	28052	he	129	" Get it over . "
28061	28064	28066	28067	Miss Charteris	48	" Boy , "
28069	28106	28066	28067	Miss Charteris	48	" a rich old uncle of the Harveys has died , leaving the Professor a very considerable legacy , sufficient to make him quite independent of his fellowship , and of the production of the Encyclopedia . "
28107	28110	28052	28052	he	129	" Well ? "
28111	28157	28066	28067	Miss Charteris	48	" They are very happy about it , naturally . Poor Ann is happier than I have ever seen her . And the chief cause of their joy appears to be that now the Professor is , at last , in a position to marry . "
28158	28161	28052	28052	he	129	" Well ? "
28162	28206	28066	28067	Miss Charteris	48	" I have not seen him yet , but Miss Ann is full of it . She told me a good many very touching things . I had no idea it had meant so much to him all these years . Boy dear ? "
28207	28210	28052	28052	he	129	" Yes . "
28211	28220	28066	28067	Miss Charteris	48	" I shall have to marry the Professor . "
28224	28374	28052	28052	he	129	" I do n't know how to make you understand why I feel so bound to them . They were very old friends of my father and mother . They were so good to me through all the days of sorrow , when I was left alone . Miss Ann is a great invalid , and very dependent upon love and care , and upon not being thwarted in her little hopes and plans . She expects to come and live in in her brother 's home . She knows I should love to have her . And he has done so much for me , intellectually ; so patiently kept my mind alive , when it was inclined to stagnate ; and working , when it would have grown slack . He has given up hours of his valuable time to me , every week , for years . "
28423	28575	28404	28404	She	621	" Boy dear ; it is terribly hard for us , I know . In a most extraordinary way in a way I can not understand you have won my body . It yearns to be with you ; it aches if you suffer ; it lives in your gladness ; it grows young in your youth . Nobody else has ever made me feel this ; I do not suppose anybody else ever will . But oh Boy bodies are not everything . Bodies are the least of all . And I think I think the Professor holds my mind . He won it long ago . I have grown much older since then , and very tired of waiting . But I can look back to the time when I used to think the greatest privilege in the world would be , to be the to marry the Professor . "
28582	28586	28588	28589	the Boy	129	" Bodies count , "
28596	28607	28588	28589	the Boy	129	" You 'll jolly well find , that bodies count . "
28620	28629	28630	28630	she	622	" Oh , I know , Boy dear , "
28633	28912	28630	28630	she	622	" But more between some , than others . The Professor and I are united , primarily , on the mental and spiritual plane . Being so sure of this , realizing the difference , makes it less hard , in a way , to to give up my Little Boy Blue . Boy dear , you must help me ; because I love you as I have never loved anybody else in this world before ; as I know I never shall love again . But I am bound in honour not to disappoint the man who knows I have waited for him . Miss Ann admitted to me to - night that she has told him . She said , in the first moments of joy she had to tell him ; he was so anxious ; and so diffident . Boy dear , had it not been for that , I think I should have begged off . But as he knows as they have trusted me dear , we must say ' good - bye ' to - night . He is going to write to me to - morrow , asking if he may come . I shall say : ' Yes . ' ... Boy dear ? Is it very hard ? ... Oh , ca n't you see where duty comes in ? There can be no true happiness if one has failed to be true to what one knows is just and right .... Ca n't you realize , Boy , that they have been everything to me for seven years ? You have come in , for seven days . "
28913	28918	28920	28921	the Boy	129	" Time is nothing , "
28925	28963	28920	28921	the Boy	129	" You and I are one , Christobel ; eternally , indissolubly one . You will find it out , when it is too late . Age is nothing ! Time is nothing ! Love is all ! "
29102	29172	29093	29094	Ann Harvey	97	" Darling child , forgive me , but I had to tell Kenrick ! He is so humble he was so diffident , so doubtful of his own powers of attraction . I had to tell him that I knew you had been very fond of him for years . I did not say much , sweet child ; but just enough to give dear Kenrick hope and confidence . "
29386	29390	29392	29393	Christobel Charteris	48	" the other man "
29408	29413	29414	29414	she	48	" Little Boy Blue , "
29417	29457	29414	29414	she	48	" you must say ' good - bye ' and go . I am going to marry the Professor quite soon , and I must not see you again . Say ' good - bye , ' Boy dear . "
29523	29545	29519	29520	the Boy	129	" O God , give her to me ! Give her to me ! O God , give her to me ! "
29546	29551	29552	29552	she	48	" Hush , Boy , "
29555	29560	29552	29552	she	48	" oh , hush ! "
29616	29625	29609	29609	she	48	" O God , give her to me ! "
29736	29749	29750	29750	she	48	" Oh , my Little Boy Blue , my Little Boy Blue ! "
29795	29864	29756	29757	the Boy	129	" Oh , I can not bear it ! I can not bear it ! Boy dear , oh , Boy dear , you shall have all you wish all all ! ... Do you hear , my Little Boy Blue ? It shall all be for you , darling ; all for you ! Nobody else matters . You shall have all you want all all all ! "
29953	29958	29959	29959	he	129	" No , Christobel , "
29962	30142	29959	29959	he	129	" No , my Beloved . I could not accept happiness even such happiness at so great a cost to you . There could be no bliss for you , no peace , no satisfaction , even in our great love , if you had gone against your supreme sense of duty ; your own high conception of right and wrong . Also , Christobel , dearest you must not give yourself in a rush of emotion . You must give yourself deliberately where your mind has chosen , and where your great soul is content . That being so , I must be off , Christobel ; and do n't you worry about me . You 've been heavenly good to me , dear ; and I 've put you through so much . I will go up to town to - night . I shall not come back , unless you send for me . But when you want me and send why , my Love , I will come from the other end of the world . "
30381	30393	30374	30374	She	653	" And the evening and the morning were the fifth day . "
30400	30404	30374	30374	She	653	" MUCH TO SAY "
30504	30524	30495	30496	the Boy	129	" Good morning . All 's well . Just off for Folkestone . Please tell me how you are . "
30541	30554	30537	30538	Miss Charteris	48	" Quite well , thank you . Do be careful at Folkestone . "
30663	30668	30659	30659	him	129	" All 's well . "
30683	30694	30669	30669	He	129	" Fanks , but I always does my own cawwying . "
30747	30757	30707	30708	the Professor	211	" Come to tea with me , dear child , "
30762	30769	30707	30708	the Professor	211	" we have much to say ! "

31069	31072	31078	31079	Miss Ann	51	" just . "
31073	31077	31078	31079	Miss Ann	51	" My dear , "
31083	31096	31078	31079	Miss Ann	51	" as you are here , will you just clean the canary ? "
31149	31154	31144	31145	The canary	684	" Sweetie - weet , "
31176	31180	31175	31175	him	684	" Sweetie - weet "

31543	31549	31550	31551	Miss Ann	51	" a little song of praise "
31866	31878	31848	31850	a sturdy youngster	698	" It 's a furze - bush , not a hedgehog ! "
31968	31972	31973	31973	she	48	" Sweet sister , "
31979	31988	31973	31973	she	48	" let me take you to my heart . "
32001	32028	31973	31973	she	48	" by Miss Ann . The Boy had made her feel so young , and so completely his contemporary , that if Miss Ann had called her "
32031	32034	32035	32035	granddaughter	703	" or even "
32037	32060	32035	32035	granddaughter	703	" it would have seemed more appropriate . Also her magnificent proportions constituted a somewhat large order for Miss Ann 's proposed embrace .
32313	32317	32318	32318	she	51	" Dearest child , "
32321	32549	32303	32303	she	51	" I want you just to cover this book for me . Emma has offered to do it , several times , but I said : ' No , Emma . We must keep it for Miss Christobel . I do not know what she would say to you , if you took to covering my books ! ' Emma is a good soul , and willing ; but has not the mind and method required to cover a book properly . If you will just run up to my room , dear child , you will find a neat piece of whity - brown paper laid aside on purpose .... Hush , Sweetie - weet ! Christobel knows you are pleased to see her .... It is either on the ottoman behind the screen , or in the top left - hand drawer of the mahogany chest , between the window and the fireplace . Ah , how much we have come through , during the last twenty - four hours ! The scissors , dear Love , are hanging by black tape from a nail in the store - room . You require a large and common pair for cutting brown paper . How truly wonderful are the ways of Providence , dear Christobel ! The paste is in the little cupboard under the stairs . "
32583	32611	32571	32571	she	48	" I want an important talk now , please . Ann , are you sure you told your brother that I had cared for him for years ? "
32612	32632	32571	32571	she	48	" Darling , dear Kenrick was so diffident ; so unable to realize his own powers of attraction ; so "
32633	32669	32571	32571	she	48	" Do you think it was fair toward a woman , even if it were true , to tell a man who had never asked her love , that that love has long been his ? "
32670	32714	32571	32571	she	48	" Sweet child , how crudely you put it ! I merely hinted , whispered ; gave the most delicate indications of what I knew to be your feeling . For you do love my brother ; do you not , dear Christobel ? "
32715	32719	32721	32722	Miss Charteris	48	" I think , "
32730	32744	32721	32722	Miss Charteris	48	" I think I love the Professor as a woman loves a book . "
32826	32834	32835	32835	she	51	" Ah , what a beautiful definition ! "
32838	32848	32835	32835	she	51	" What could be more pure , more perfect ? "
32880	32889	32890	32890	she	48	" A woman could hardly marry a book , "
32901	32905	32906	32906	she	51	" Darling child ! "
32909	32972	32906	32906	she	51	" No simile , however beautiful , should be pressed too far ! Your exquisite description of your love for dear Kenrick merely assures us that your union with him will prove one of complete contentment to the mind . And the mind that sensitive instrument , attuned to all the immensities of the intellectual spheres the mind is what really matters . "
32973	32977	32979	32980	Miss Charteris	48	" Bodies count , "
33000	33010	32987	32987	her	48	" We shall jolly well find , bodies count . "
33029	33058	33026	33026	She	51	" My dear Christobel , what an expression ! And do you not think , that , under these circumstances , any mention of bodies savours of impropriety ? "
33169	33173	33174	33174	she	51	" Dear Ann , "
33179	33215	33174	33174	she	51	" do you really believe your brother would be much disappointed if after all when he asks me to marry him which he has not done yet I feel it better not to do so ? "
33216	33221	33223	33224	Miss Ann	51	" My darling child ! "
33243	33261	33223	33224	Miss Ann	51	" My darling child ! Think how patiently he has waited ! Remember the long years ! Remember "
33262	33268	33270	33271	Miss Charteris	48	" Yes , I know , "
33273	33308	33270	33271	Miss Charteris	48	" You told me all that last night , did n't you ? But it seems to me that , if a man can wait twelve years , he might as well wait twenty . "
33309	33315	33317	33318	Miss Ann	51	" So he would have ! "
33320	33369	33317	33318	Miss Ann	51	" Undoubtedly dear Kenrick would have waited twenty years , had it not been for this fortunate legacy , which places him in a position to marry at once . But why should you wish to keep him waiting any longer ? Is not twelve years sufficiently long ? "
33374	33385	33386	33386	she	48	" Twelve days would be too long for some people , "
33391	33423	33386	33386	she	48	" I have no wish to keep him waiting . But you must remember , Ann , the Professor has , as yet , spoken no word of love to me . "
33424	33428	33430	33431	Miss Ann	51	" Dear child , "
33435	33567	33430	33431	Miss Ann	51	" he would have come to you to - day , but imperative legal business , connected with our uncle 's will , took him to town . I know for certain that he intends writing to you this evening ; and , if you then give him leave to do so , he will call upon you to - morrow . Oh , darling girl , you will not disappoint us ? We have so trusted you ; so believed in you ! A less scrupulously honourable man than Kenrick , might have tried to bind you by a promise , before he was in a position to offer you immediate marriage . Think of all the hopes the hopes and p - plans , which depend upon your faithfulness ! "
33586	33640	33568	33569	Miss Ann	51	" Ah , sweetest child ! You knelt beside this very sofa , five years ago , and you said : ' Ann , I think any woman might be proud to become the wife of the Professor ! ' Have you forgotten that you said that , kneeling beside this very sofa ? "
33641	33647	33649	33650	Miss Charteris	48	" I have not forgotten , "
33652	33659	33649	33650	Miss Charteris	48	" and I think so still . "
33660	33667	33669	33670	Miss Ann	51	" Then you will marry Kenrick ? "
33888	33895	33897	33898	Miss Ann	51	" Then you will marry Kenrick ? "
33924	33928	33929	33929	she	48	" Dear Ann , "
33932	33957	33929	33929	she	48	" It will not be leap year again , until 1912 . And , meanwhile , the Professor has not proposed marriage to me . "
33974	33979	33980	33980	she	51	" Ah , naughty ! "
33983	34486	33980	33980	she	51	" Naughty , to make me tell ! But as you will ask he is going to write to - night . But you must never let him know I told you ! And now I want you just to find the Spectator it is laid over that exquisitely embroidered blotter on the writing - table in the window , sent me last Christmas by that kind creature , Lady Goldsmith ; so thoughtful , tasteful , and quite touching ; Emma , careful soul , spread it over the blotter , while darling Sweetie - weetie took his bath . Dear pet , it is a sight to see him splash and splutter . Lady Goldsmith thinks so much of dear Kenrick . The first time she saw him , she was immensely struck by his extraordinarily clever appearance . He sat exactly opposite her at a Guildhall banquet ; and she told me afterwards that the mere sight of him was sufficient to take away all inclination for food ; excepting for that intellectual nourishment which he is so well able to supply . I thought that was rather well expressed , and , coming from a florid woman , such as Lady Goldsmith , was quite a tribute to my brother . You would call Lady Goldsmith ' florid , ' would you not , dear Christobel ? ... Oh , you do not know her by sight ? I am surprised . As the wife of the Professor , you will soon know all these distinguished people by sight . Yes , she is undoubtedly florid ; and inclined to be what my dear father used to call ' a woman of a stout habit . ' This being the case , it was certainly a tribute a tribute of which you and I , dearest child , have a right to feel justly proud .... Oh , is it still damp ? Naughty Sweetie - weet ! Do n't you think it might be wise , just to take it to the kitchen . Emma , good soul , will let you dry it before the fire . I have heard of fatalities caused by damp newspapers . Precious child , we can have you run no risks ! What would Kenrick say ? But when it is absolutely dry , I want you just to explain to me the gist of that article on the effect of oriental literature on modern thought . Kenrick tells me you have read it . He wishes to discuss it with me . I really can not undertake to read it through . I have not the time required . Yet I must be prepared to talk it over intelligently with my brother , when next he pays me a visit . He may look in this evening , weary with his day in town , and requiring the relaxation of a little intellectual conversation . I must be ready . "

And then I should have said : ' I saw it , Boy dear ; and it was quite as beautiful as you say . ' And he would have answered : ' It jolly well gave you the feeling of the scene , did n't it , Christobel ? ' And I should have known that his delight in it , as an artistic success , had nothing to do with the fact that it was painted by himself . Just because egotism is impossible to him , he is free to be so full of vivid enthusiasm . "

42131	42233	42118	42118	he	643	" A wrecked aeroplane . Caught in a cross - current , worse luck ! Just accomplished one of the finest flights on record . Started from up here ; skimmed over the Channel to Boulogne ; circled round the cathedral such a clear day ; we could watch the whole flight with field - glasses came gaily back without a stop ; was making for the cliff again , when a cross - current caught him ; something went wrong with the steering - gear ; and down it goes , with a plunge , head first into the sea . "
42234	42240	42242	42243	the Professor	211	" And the er occupant ? "
42245	42304	42118	42118	he	643	" The aeronaut ? Ah , he did n't fall clear , worse luck , or they could soon have fished him out . He stuck to his seat and his wheel , and fell smash in among his wires . They are trying to extricate him now . Bad luck , poor chap ! Such a sport . "
42305	42312	42314	42315	the Professor	211	" Do you know his name ? "
42328	42332	42334	42335	the man	643	" Guy Chelsea , "
42337	42359	42334	42335	the man	643	" And I give you my word , he was the finest , pluckiest young amateur we had among the airmen . "

44578	44637	44571	44571	she	56	" Living do n't express it , Miss Christobel . Lively 's more like it , when Mr. Guy is concerned . And I reckon , wherever ' e is , e 's makin ' things lively somewhere for somebody . You do n't look quite the thing this morning , Miss. Sit up and take your tea . "

44856	44898	44853	44853	she	56	" is it indeed true ? Is it possible ? Is my Boy alive ? And am I free free to be his alone ? Am I free to give him all he wants , free to be all he needs ? "
45459	45526	45455	45456	Miss Charteris	48	" And very early in the morning , the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun . And they said among themselves , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ? And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great . "
45590	45603	45570	45572	Little Boy Blue	52	" I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not . "

45813	45862	46035	46036	Miss Charteris	48	" MY DEAR ANN , I regret to have been unable to look in upon you this evening , on my return from town , and my duties will keep me from paying you a visit until to - morrow , in the late afternoon . Hence this letter .
45863	45931	46035	46036	Miss Charteris	48	" Needless to say , I have been thinking over , carefully , the remarkable statement you saw fit to make to me , concerning the feelings and expectations of our young friend . It came to me as a genuine surprise . I have always looked upon our friendship as purely Platonic ; based entirely upon the intellectual enjoyment we found in pursuing our classical studies together .
45932	45947	46035	46036	Miss Charteris	48	" I admit , I can not bring myself to contemplate matrimony with much enthusiasm .
45948	46017	46035	46036	Miss Charteris	48	" At the same time , your feeling in the matter being so strong , and my sense of gratitude toward my late friend , a thing never to be forgotten ; if you are quite sure , Ann and I confess it seems to me altogether incredible that our young friend entertains , toward me , feelings which will mean serious disappointment to her , if I fail "
46075	46096	46035	46036	Miss Charteris	48	" And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great . "
46170	46179	46140	46140	he	1180	" came from Miss Ann , and was marked "
46181	46183	46140	46140	he	1180	" and "
46186	46186	46140	46140	he	1180	"
46213	46220	46221	46221	she	48	" Take Emma downstairs , Jenkins , "
46224	46274	46221	46221	she	48	" Ask Martha to give her a cup of coffee , and an egg , if she fancies it . Tell Emma , I wish her to sit down comfortably and rest . The answer to this note will be ready in about half an hour ; not before . "
46350	46352	46342	46342	she	48	" urgent "
46354	46357	46342	46342	she	48	" immediate . "
46358	46361	46363	46364	Miss Ann	51	" SWEETEST CHILD "
46365	46517	46342	46342	she	48	" See what Kenrick has done ! We you and I so understand his dear absent - minded ways . He wrote this letter to you last night , and , owing to his natural emotion and tension of mind , addressed it to me ! Needless to say , I have read only the opening sentences . Darling Christobel , you will , I feel sure , overlook the very natural mistake , and not allow it in any way to affect your answer to my brother 's proposal . Remember how difficult it is for great minds to be accurate in the small details of daily life . I have known Kenrick to put two spoonfuls of mustard into a cup of coffee , stir it round , and drink it , quite unaware that anything was wrong I have indeed ! See how our dear Professor needs a wife !
46518	46593	46342	46342	she	48	" I feel quite foolishly anxious this morning . Do send me one line of assurance that all is well . You can not but be touched by my brother 's letter . From beginning to end , it breathes the faithful devotion of a lifetime . Do not misunderstand the natural reticence of one wholly unaccustomed to the voicing of sentiment . I only wish you could hear all he says to me ! "
46666	46717	46649	46649	She	48	" DEAR ANN , I enclose a letter from your brother which came , addressed to me , this morning , but was evidently intended for you . I have read only the first page , which was quite sufficient to make the true state of affairs perfectly clear to me .
46718	46767	46649	46649	She	48	" Providence has indeed interposed , by means of the Professor 's absent - minded ways , to prevent the wrecking of three lives mine , your brother 's , and that of the man I love ; to whom I shall be betrothed before the day is over .
46768	46810	46649	46649	She	48	" I shall not tell the Professor that I have seen a portion of his letter to you . I think we owe it to him not to do so . He has always been a true and honourable friend to me .
46811	46814	46649	46649	She	48	" Yours , "

47221	47302	47218	47218	she	51	" I rejoice to hear of your good fortune . It is well indeed when the great thinkers of the world are rendered independent of all anxious taking of thought as to what they shall eat , or what they shall drink , or wherewithal they shall be clothed . I like to think of you , my friend , as now set completely free from all mundane cares ; able to give your undivided attention to the work you love .
47303	47377	47493	47493	her	48	" I appreciate , more than I can say , the kind proposition concerning myself , which you make in your letter . I owe it to our friendship to tell you quite frankly that I feel , and have long felt , how great an honour it would be for any woman to be in a position so to administer your household as to set you completely free for your great intellectual pursuits .
47378	47427	47218	47218	she	51	" But marriage would mean more than this , and our long friendship emboldens me to say that I should grieve to see you owing perhaps to pressure or advice from others burden your life with family ties for which you surely do not yourself feel any special inclination .
47428	47464	47493	47493	her	48	" And , now , my friend , I must not close my letter without telling you how great a happiness has come into my lonely life . I am about to marry a man whom "

47557	47563	47493	47493	her	48	" Believe me , always , "

48113	48133	48109	48109	his	129	" When you want me and send why , I will come from the other end of the world . "
48260	48275	48227	48227	She	48	" Do not fly to - day . Come to me . I want you .

48407	48418	48419	48419	he	1216	" It should be there before noon , Miss Charteris , "
48554	48563	48564	48566	the young aeronaut	1221	" I jolly well mean to do it ! "
48581	48587	48588	48588	he	1216	" Hurry up that wire , "
48604	48608	48609	48609	he	1216	" I wonder , "
48961	48989	48957	48957	He	1216	" One never expects those things to happen , and when they do happen , it 's over so quickly that there is no time for expectation . "
49065	49102	49052	49052	she	48	" It was always you I wanted ; not your niece . Good heavens ! How can you have thought it was Mollie , when it was you you just only you , all the time ? "
49115	49121	49104	49104	she	48	" Is this a proposal ? "
49122	49126	49127	49127	she	48	" My ALL , "
49130	49149	49104	49104	she	48	" Oh , Boy dear , my ALL . If I lose you , I lose my ALL . "

49460	49471	49455	49456	the Boy	129	" and when I do , you will hear it . "
49557	49565	49566	49566	he	129	" I could n't wait for trains , "
49569	49588	49566	49566	he	129	" I came by motor . And I jolly well exceeded the speed - limit all the way ! "
49598	49602	49603	49603	she	48	" Boy dear , "
49606	49672	49603	49603	she	48	" you always exceed all speed - limits . It is a way you have . Exceed them as much as you like , so long as I am with you when you do it . But oh , my Little Boy Blue ! do n't fly again ; for , if you fall and break your wings , indeed you will break my heart . "

The stone was very great ; but lo , as we reached it , the Angel of the Lord had rolled it away .... No other man has a shadow of claim over me . I am free to say , to the only man I have ever really loved : Take me ; I am yours . Oh , Boy ! I am altogether yours . "
49946	49951	49953	49955	Little Boy Blue	52	" Thank the Lord , "
49962	49974	49958	49958	he	1241	" And the evening and the morning were the seventh day . "
