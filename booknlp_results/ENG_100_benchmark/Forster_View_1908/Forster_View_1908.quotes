15	25	27	28	Miss Bartlett	111	" The Signora had no business to do it , "
30	70	27	28	Miss Bartlett	111	" no business at all . She promised us south rooms with a view close together , instead of which here are north rooms , looking into a courtyard , and a long way apart . Oh , Lucy ! "
71	78	80	80	Lucy	112	" And a Cockney , besides ! "
94	100	80	80	Lucy	112	" It might be London . "
185	226	321	321	she	112	" Charlotte , do n't you feel , too , that we might be in London ? I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside . I suppose it is one 's being so tired . "
227	237	239	240	Miss Bartlett	111	" This meat has surely been used for soup , "
247	290	321	321	she	112	" I want so to see the Arno . The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno . The Signora had no business to do it at all . Oh , it is a shame ! "
291	298	299	300	Miss Bartlett	111	" Any nook does for me , "
303	317	299	300	Miss Bartlett	111	" but it does seem hard that you should n't have a view . "
326	359	321	321	she	112	" Charlotte , you must n't spoil me : of course , you must look over the Arno , too . I meant that . The first vacant room in the front - "
360	366	368	369	Miss Bartlett	111	" You must have it , "
396	406	321	321	she	112	" No , no . You must have it . "
407	422	368	369	Miss Bartlett	111	" I insist on it . Your mother would never forgive me , Lucy . "
423	430	321	321	she	112	" She would never forgive me . "
504	515	501	501	He	303	" I have a view , I have a view . "
546	548	557	558	the intruder	306	" do "
667	682	652	652	she	111	" A view ? Oh , a view ! How delightful a view is ! "
683	689	691	693	the old man	310	" This is my son , "
695	707	691	693	the old man	310	" his name 's George . He has a view too . "
708	711	713	714	Miss Bartlett	111	" Ah , "
725	730	731	731	he	306	" What I mean , "
734	753	731	731	he	306	" is that you can have our rooms , and we 'll have yours . We 'll change . "
788	802	779	779	her	111	" Thank you very much indeed ; that is out of the question . "
803	806	808	810	the old man	310	" Why ? "
819	832	779	779	her	111	" Because it is quite out of the question , thank you . "
833	844	846	846	Lucy	112	" You see , we do n't like to take - "
854	858	859	859	he	306	" But why ? "
862	874	876	876	he	306	" Women like looking at a view ; men do n't . "
894	900	876	876	he	306	" George , persuade them ! "
901	912	914	915	the son	317	" It 's so obvious they should have the rooms , "
917	925	914	915	the son	317	" There 's nothing else to say . "
964	969	953	953	she	112	" quite a scene , "
1092	1099	1083	1083	She	111	" Are you all like this ? "
1129	1138	1083	1083	She	111	" We are not ; we are genteel . "
1139	1146	1147	1147	she	111	" Eat your dinner , dear , "
1176	1198	1147	1147	she	111	" Eat your dinner , dear . This pension is a failure . To - morrow we will make a change . "
1265	1300	1247	1247	Lucy	112	" Oh , oh ! Why , it 's Mr. Beebe ! Oh , how perfectly lovely ! Oh , Charlotte , we must stop now , however bad the rooms are . Oh ! "
1309	1351	1301	1302	Miss Bartlett	111	" How do you do , Mr. Beebe ? I expect that you have forgotten us : Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch , who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter 's that very cold Easter . "
1396	1405	1407	1417	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	329	" I AM so glad to see you , "
1435	1455	1407	1417	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	329	" Just fancy how small the world is . Summer Street , too , makes it so specially funny . "
1456	1467	1469	1470	Miss Bartlett	111	" Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street , "
1477	1497	1469	1470	Miss Bartlett	111	" and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living - "
1498	1538	1407	1417	the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation	329	" Yes , I heard from mother so last week . She did n't know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells ; but I wrote back at once , and I said : ' Mr. Beebe is - ' "
1539	1543	1545	1546	the clergyman	332	" Quite right , "
1548	1572	1545	1546	the clergyman	332	" I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June . I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood . "
1573	1590	1672	1673	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , how glad I am ! The name of our house is Windy Corner . "
1595	1629	1672	1673	Miss Bartlett	111	" There is mother and me generally , and my brother , though it 's not often we get him to ch - - The church is rather far off , I mean . "
1630	1642	1672	1673	Miss Bartlett	111	" Lucy , dearest , let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner . "
1643	1656	1657	1657	He	116	" I am eating it , thank you , and enjoying it . "
1721	1729	1730	1730	his	116	" Do n't neglect the country round , "
1734	1755	1730	1730	his	116	" The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole , and round by Settignano , or something of that sort . "
1756	1759	1730	1730	his	116	" No ! "
1770	1789	1730	1730	his	116	" Mr. Beebe , you are wrong . The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato . "
1790	1797	1799	1800	Miss Bartlett	111	" That lady looks so clever , "
1805	1811	1799	1800	Miss Bartlett	111	" We are in luck . "
1910	1946	1904	1906	the clever lady	344	" Prato ! They must go to Prato . That place is too sweetly squalid for words . I love it ; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability , as you know . "
2230	2238	2239	2239	she	111	" We are most grateful to you , "
2243	2264	2239	2239	she	111	" The first evening means so much . When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d'heure . "
2270	2292	2327	2327	He	116	" Do you , by any chance , know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner ? "
2293	2296	2327	2327	He	116	" Emerson . "
2297	2305	2327	2327	He	116	" Is he a friend of yours ? "
2306	2317	2327	2327	He	116	" We are friendly - as one is in pensions . "
2318	2326	2327	2327	He	116	" Then I will say no more . "
2338	2346	2347	2347	she	111	" I am , as it were , "
2350	2396	2347	2347	she	111	" the chaperon of my young cousin , Lucy , and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing . His manner was somewhat unfortunate . I hope I acted for the best . "
2397	2403	2405	2405	he	116	" You acted very naturally , "
2418	2435	2407	2407	He	116	" All the same , I do n't think much harm would have come of accepting . "
2436	2452	2347	2347	she	111	" No harm , of course . But we could not be under an obligation . "
2453	2461	2463	2463	he	116	" He is rather a peculiar man . "
2471	2561	2463	2463	he	116	" I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance , nor expect you to show gratitude . He has the merit - if it is one - of saying exactly what he means . He has rooms he does not value , and he thinks you would value them . He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite . It is so difficult - at least , I find it difficult - to understand people who speak the truth . "
2569	2589	2562	2562	Lucy	112	" I was hoping that he was nice ; I do so always hope that people will be nice . "
2590	2706	2347	2347	she	111	" I think he is ; nice and tiresome . I differ from him on almost every point of any importance , and so , I expect - I may say I hope - you will differ . But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores . When he first came here he not unnaturally put people 's backs up . He has no tact and no manners - I do n't mean by that that he has bad manners - and he will not keep his opinions to himself . We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora , but I am glad to say we thought better of it . "
2707	2713	2715	2716	Miss Bartlett	111	" Am I to conclude , "
2718	2725	2715	2716	Miss Bartlett	111	" that he is a Socialist ? "
2742	2758	2347	2347	she	111	" And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist , too ? "
2759	2813	2347	2347	she	111	" I hardly know George , for he has n't learnt to talk yet . He seems a nice creature , and I think he has brains . Of course , he has all his father 's mannerisms , and it is quite possible that he , too , may be a Socialist . "
2814	2821	2823	2824	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , you relieve me , "
2826	2849	2823	2824	Miss Bartlett	111	" So you think I ought to have accepted their offer ? You feel I have been narrow - minded and suspicious ? "
2850	2855	2856	2856	he	360	" Not at all , "
2859	2865	2856	2856	he	360	" I never suggested that . "
2866	2883	2823	2824	Miss Bartlett	111	" But ought I not to apologize , at all events , for my apparent rudeness ? "
2912	2918	2920	2921	Miss Bartlett	111	" Was I a bore ? "
2930	2975	2920	2921	Miss Bartlett	111	" Why did n't you talk , Lucy ? He prefers young people , I 'm sure . I do hope I have n't monopolized him . I hoped you would have him all the evening , as well as all dinner - time . "
2976	2981	2983	2983	Lucy	112	" He is nice , "
2985	3009	2983	2983	Lucy	112	" Just what I remember . He seems to see good in every one . No one would take him for a clergyman . "
3010	3015	2920	2921	Miss Bartlett	111	" My dear Lucia - "
3016	3042	2983	2983	Lucy	112	" Well , you know what I mean . And you know how clergymen generally laugh ; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man . "
3043	3066	2920	2921	Miss Bartlett	111	" Funny girl ! How you do remind me of your mother . I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe . "
3067	3079	2983	2983	Lucy	112	" I 'm sure she will ; and so will Freddy . "
3080	3113	2920	2921	Miss Bartlett	111	" I think every one at Windy Corner will approve ; it is the fashionable world . I am used to Tunbridge Wells , where we are all hopelessly behind the times . "
3114	3117	3119	3119	Lucy	112	" Yes , "
3191	3204	3180	3181	Miss Bartlett	111	" I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion . "
3211	3236	3206	3207	the girl	333	" I must have been selfish or unkind ; I must be more careful . It is so dreadful for Charlotte , being poor . "
3408	3425	3532	3535	the little old lady	371	" But here you are as safe as in England . Signora Bertolini is so English . "
3426	3432	3435	3435	Lucy	112	" Yet our rooms smell , "
3437	3444	3435	3435	Lucy	112	" We dread going to bed . "
3445	3455	3456	3456	She	333	" Ah , then you look into the court . "
3459	3477	3456	3456	She	333	" If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful ! We were so sorry for you at dinner . "
3478	3488	3532	3535	the little old lady	371	" I think he was meaning to be kind . "
3489	3494	3496	3497	Miss Bartlett	111	" Undoubtedly he was , "
3499	3525	3532	3535	the little old lady	371	" Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature . Of course , I was holding back on my cousin 's account . "
3526	3530	3532	3535	the little old lady	371	" Of course , "
3588	3632	3538	3538	they	372	" About old Mr. Emerson - I hardly know . No , he is not tactful ; yet , have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate , and yet at the same time - beautiful ? "
3633	3636	3638	3639	Miss Bartlett	111	" Beautiful ? "
3646	3655	3638	3639	Miss Bartlett	111	" Are not beauty and delicacy the same ? "
3656	3663	3665	3667	the other helplessly	377	" So one would have thought , "
3669	3680	3665	3667	the other helplessly	377	" But things are so difficult , I sometimes think . "
3697	3701	3702	3702	he	116	" Miss Bartlett , "
3705	3761	3702	3702	he	116	" it 's all right about the rooms . I 'm so glad . Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking - room , and knowing what I did , I encouraged him to make the offer again . He has let me come and ask you . He would be so pleased . "
3762	3767	3769	3769	Lucy	112	" Oh , Charlotte , "
3774	3796	3769	3769	Lucy	112	" we must have the rooms now . The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be . "
3802	3806	3808	3809	Mr. Beebe	116	" I fear , "
3815	3829	3808	3809	Mr. Beebe	116	" that I have been officious . I must apologize for my interference . "
3846	3938	3842	3843	Miss Bartlett	111	" My own wishes , dearest Lucy , are unimportant in comparison with yours . It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence , when I am only here through your kindness . If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms , I will do it . Would you then , Mr. Beebe , kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer , and then conduct him to me , in order that I may thank him personally ? "
3982	4013	3941	3941	her	379	" Remember , Lucy , I alone am implicated in this . I do not wish the acceptance to come from you . Grant me that , at all events . "
4023	4036	4014	4015	Mr. Beebe	116	" Mr. Emerson is engaged , but here is his son instead . "
4060	4064	4065	4065	he	345	" My father , "
4068	4104	4065	4065	he	345	" is in his bath , so you can not thank him personally . But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out . "
4144	4149	4151	4152	Miss Bartlett	111	" Poor young man ! "
4161	4183	4211	4211	he	116	" How angry he is with his father about the rooms ! It is all he can do to keep polite . "
4184	4197	4199	4200	Mr. Beebe	116	" In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready , "
4225	4230	4232	4235	the little old lady	371	" Oh , dear ! "
4251	4258	4259	4259	Her	371	" Gentlemen sometimes do not realize - "
4353	4375	4343	4344	Miss Bartlett	111	" I think one might venture now . No , Lucy , do not stir . I will superintend the move . "
4376	4383	4385	4385	Lucy	112	" How you do do everything , "
4387	4397	4343	4344	Miss Bartlett	111	" Naturally , dear . It is my affair . "
4398	4407	4343	4344	Miss Bartlett	111	" But I would like to help you . "
4408	4413	4343	4344	Miss Bartlett	111	" No , dear . "
4492	4498	4500	4501	Miss Bartlett	111	" I want to explain , "
4503	4552	4500	4501	Miss Bartlett	111	" why it is that I have taken the largest room . Naturally , of course , I should have given it to you ; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man , and I was sure your mother would not like it . "
4557	4621	4659	4659	she	111	" If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him . I am a woman of the world , in my small way , and I know where things lead to . However , Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this . "
4622	4631	4633	4633	Lucy	112	" Mother would n't mind I 'm sure , "
4805	4811	4812	4812	she	111	" What does it mean ? "
5501	5592	5495	5497	the clever lady	344	" If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you , I do assure you that you can neglect the good person . Being English , Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe . Italians understand . A dear friend of mine , Contessa Baroncelli , has two daughters , and when she can not send a maid to school with them , she lets them go in sailor - hats instead . Every one takes them for English , you see , especially if their hair is strained tightly behind . "
5652	5680	5647	5647	she	344	" I will take you by a dear dirty back way , Miss Honeychurch , and if you bring me luck , we shall have an adventure . "
5703	5756	5681	5681	Lucy	112	" Tut , tut ! Miss Lucy ! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker . He does but touch the surface of things . As to the true Italy - he does not even dream of it . The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation . "
5913	5935	5910	5910	she	128	" A smell ! a true Florentine smell ! Every city , let me teach you , has its own smell . "
5936	5944	5946	5946	Lucy	112	" Is it a very nice smell ? "
5959	5969	5906	5906	she	128	" One does n't come to Italy for niceness , "
5974	5986	5906	5906	she	128	" one comes for life . Buon giorno ! Buon giorno ! "
5992	6013	5906	5906	she	128	" Look at that adorable wine - cart ! How the driver stares at us , dear , simple soul ! "
6082	6131	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" Buon giorno ! Take the word of an old woman , Miss Lucy : you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors . That is the true democracy . Though I am a real Radical as well . There , now you 're shocked . "
6132	6139	6141	6141	Lucy	112	" Indeed , I 'm not ! "
6143	6170	6141	6141	Lucy	112	" We are Radicals , too , out and out . My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone , until he was so dreadful about Ireland . "
6171	6188	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" I see , I see . And now you have gone over to the enemy . "
6189	6249	6141	6141	Lucy	112	" Oh , please - ! If my father was alive , I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right . And as it is , the glass over our front door was broken last election , and Freddy is sure it was the Tories ; but mother says nonsense , a tramp . "
6250	6260	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" Shameful ! A manufacturing district , I suppose ? "
6261	6280	6141	6141	Lucy	112	" No - in the Surrey hills . About five miles from Dorking , looking over the Weald . "
6291	6326	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" What a delightful part ; I know it so well . It is full of the very nicest people . Do you know Sir Harry Otway - a Radical if ever there was ? "
6327	6332	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" Very well indeed . "
6333	6341	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist ? "
6342	6355	6411	6412	Miss Lavish	128	" Why , she rents a field of us ! How funny ! "
6369	6378	6356	6357	Miss Lavish	128	" Oh , you have property in Surrey ? "
6379	6383	6385	6385	Lucy	112	" Hardly any , "
6394	6410	6391	6392	a snob	448	" Only thirty acres - just the garden , all downhill , and some fields . "
6488	6504	6482	6482	she	128	" Bless us ! Bless us and save us ! We 've lost the way . "
6553	6607	6531	6532	Miss Lavish	128	" Lost ! lost ! My dear Miss Lucy , during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning . How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us ! What are we to do ? Two lone females in an unknown town . Now , this is what I call an adventure . "
6632	6678	6608	6608	Lucy	112	" Oh , but that is the word of a craven ! And no , you are not , not , NOT to look at your Baedeker . Give it to me ; I sha n't let you carry it . We will simply drift . "
6933	6977	7064	7065	Miss Lavish	128	" Stop a minute ; let those two people go on , or I shall have to speak to them . I do detest conventional intercourse . Nasty ! they are going into the church , too . Oh , the Britisher abroad ! "
6978	7001	7064	7065	Miss Lavish	128	" We sat opposite them at dinner last night . They have given us their rooms . They were so very kind . "
7002	7008	7010	7011	Miss Lavish	128	" Look at their figures ! "
7013	7055	7010	7011	Miss Lavish	128	" They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows . It 's very naughty of me , but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover , and turn back every tourist who could n't pass it . "
7056	7063	7064	7065	Miss Lavish	128	" What would you ask us ? "
7125	7142	7119	7119	her	128	" There goes my local - colour box ! I must have a word with him ! "
7754	7758	7763	7780	old Mr. Emerson , who had darted forward also . " Hard in life , hard in death	115	" Hateful bishop ! "
7773	7811	7763	7780	old Mr. Emerson , who had darted forward also . " Hard in life , hard in death	115	" Hard in life , hard in death . Go out into the sunshine , little boy , and kiss your hand to the sun , for that is where you ought to be . Intolerable bishop ! "
7845	7850	7852	7853	Mr. Emerson	115	" Look at him ! "
7857	7882	7852	7853	Mr. Emerson	115	" Here 's a mess : a baby hurt , cold , and frightened ! But what else can you expect from a church ? "
7967	7974	7976	7977	Mr. Emerson	115	" You are a clever woman , "
7979	8021	7976	7977	Mr. Emerson	115	" You have done more than all the relics in the world . I am not of your creed , but I do believe in those who make their fellow - creatures happy . There is no scheme of the universe - "
8028	8031	8033	8035	the Italian lady	505	" Niente , "
8043	8052	8054	8054	Lucy	112	" I 'm not sure she understands English , "
8101	8107	8109	8110	Mr. Emerson	115	" That woman understands everything , "
8114	8135	8109	8110	Mr. Emerson	115	" But what are you doing here ? Are you doing the church ? Are you through with the church ? "
8136	8139	8141	8141	Lucy	112	" No , "
8147	8193	8141	8141	Lucy	112	" I came here with Miss Lavish , who was to explain everything ; and just by the door - it is too bad ! - she simply ran away , and after waiting quite a time , I had to come in by myself . "
8194	8200	8202	8203	Mr. Emerson	115	" Why should n't you ? "
8205	8216	8218	8219	the son	317	" Yes , why should n't you come by yourself ? "
8230	8240	8141	8141	Lucy	112	" But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker . "
8241	8244	8246	8247	Mr. Emerson	115	" Baedeker ? "
8249	8275	8246	8247	Mr. Emerson	115	" I 'm glad it 's THAT you minded . It 's worth minding , the loss of a Baedeker . THAT 'S worth minding . "
8299	8306	8308	8309	the son	317	" If you 've no Baedeker , "
8311	8318	8308	8309	the son	317	" you 'd better join us . "
8334	8399	8276	8276	Lucy	112	" Thank you very much , but I could not think of that . I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you . I really came to help with the child , and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night . I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience . "
8400	8404	8406	8408	the old man	310	" My dear , "
8411	8469	8406	8408	the old man	310	" I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say . You are pretending to be touchy ; but you are not really . Stop being so tiresome , and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see . To take you to it will be a real pleasure . "
8572	8601	8567	8567	she	511	" I am not touchy , I hope . It is the Giottos that I want to see , if you will kindly tell me which they are . "
8687	8690	8691	8691	he	115	" Remember , "
8695	8783	8691	8691	he	115	" the facts about this church of Santa Croce ; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism , before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared . Observe how Giotto in these frescoes - now , unhappily , ruined by restoration - is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective . Could anything be more majestic , more pathetic , beautiful , true ? How little , we feel , avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels ! "
8784	8787	8789	8790	Mr. Emerson	115	" No ! "
8801	8865	8789	8790	Mr. Emerson	115	" Remember nothing of the sort ! Built by faith indeed ! That simply means the workmen were n't paid properly . And as for the frescoes , I see no truth in them . Look at that fat man in blue ! He must weigh as much as I do , and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon . "
8874	8880	8866	8866	He	115	" Ascension of St. John . "
8942	8958	8926	8926	They	528	" Now , did this happen , or did n't it ? Yes or no ? "
8962	9011	8959	8959	George	115	" It happened like this , if it happened at all . I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs ; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it , just as they do here . "
9012	9019	9021	9022	his father	347	" You will never go up , "
9024	9055	9021	9022	his father	347	" You and I , dear boy , will lie at peace in the earth that bore us , and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives . "
9056	9091	9021	9022	his father	347	" Some of the people can only see the empty grave , not the saint , whoever he is , going up . It did happen like that , if it happened at all . "
9092	9096	9021	9022	his father	347	" Pardon me , "
9102	9119	9021	9022	his father	347	" The chapel is somewhat small for two parties . We will incommode you no longer . "
9180	9183	9185	9186	Mr. Emerson	115	" Stop ! "
9188	9200	9185	9186	Mr. Emerson	115	" There 's plenty of room for us all . Stop ! "
9226	9239	9209	9210	the lecturer	526	" George , I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate . "
9250	9260	9240	9240	George	115	" Perhaps he is . I do n't remember . "
9261	9317	9209	9210	the lecturer	526	" Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am . It 's that Mr. Eager . Why did he go ? Did we talk too loud ? How vexatious . I shall go and say we are sorry . Had n't I better ? Then perhaps he will come back . "
9318	9325	9327	9327	George	115	" He will not come back , "
9400	9411	9412	9412	he	543	" My father has that effect on nearly every one , "
9416	9424	9412	9412	he	543	" He will try to be kind . "
9425	9432	9434	9434	she	112	" I hope we all try , "
9439	9472	9412	9412	he	543	" Because we think it improves our characters . But he is kind to people because he loves them ; and they find him out , and are offended , or frightened . "
9473	9479	9481	9481	Lucy	112	" How silly of them ! "
9490	9500	9481	9481	Lucy	112	" I think that a kind action done tactfully - "
9501	9504	9505	9505	He	543	" Tact ! "
9656	9661	9663	9664	his son	316	" Were you snubbed ? "
9667	9689	9738	9738	Lucy	112	" But we have spoilt the pleasure of I do n't know how many people . They wo n't come back . "
9690	9711	9738	9738	Lucy	112	" ... full of innate sympathy ... quickness to perceive good in others ... vision of the brotherhood of man ... "
9726	9734	9735	9735	he	115	" Do n't let us spoil yours , "
9740	9748	9735	9735	he	115	" Have you looked at those saints ? "
9749	9752	9754	9754	Lucy	112	" Yes , "
9756	9774	9754	9754	Lucy	112	" They are lovely . Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin ? "
9900	9909	9910	9910	he	115	" Why will he look at that fresco ? "
9914	9921	9910	9910	he	115	" I saw nothing in it . "
9922	9927	9928	9928	she	560	" I like Giotto , "
9931	9955	9928	9928	she	560	" It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values . Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better . "
9956	9991	9910	9910	he	115	" So you ought . A baby is worth a dozen saints . And my baby 's worth the whole of Paradise , and as far as I can see he lives in Hell . "
10001	10005	10006	10006	he	560	" In Hell , "
10009	10014	10006	10006	he	560	" He 's unhappy . "
10015	10020	10022	10022	Lucy	112	" Oh , dear ! "
10024	10091	10006	10006	he	560	" How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive ? What more is one to give him ? And think how he has been brought up - free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God . With such an education as that , I thought he was bound to grow up happy . "
10142	10151	10152	10152	he	561	" What are we to do with him ? "
10155	10197	10152	10152	he	561	" He comes out for his holiday to Italy , and behaves - like that ; like the little child who ought to have been playing , and who hurt himself upon the tombstone . Eh ? What did you say ? "
10208	10357	10205	10205	he	561	" Now do n't be stupid over this . I do n't require you to fall in love with my boy , but I do think you might try and understand him . You are nearer his age , and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible . You might help me . He has known so few women , and you have the time . You stop here several weeks , I suppose ? But let yourself go . You are inclined to get muddled , if I may judge from last night . Let yourself go . Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand , and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them . By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself . It will be good for both of you . "
10367	10385	10462	10462	he	565	" I only know what it is that 's wrong with him ; not why it is . "
10386	10392	10394	10394	Lucy	112	" And what is it ? "
10402	10412	10462	10462	he	565	" The old trouble ; things wo n't fit . "
10413	10417	10462	10462	he	565	" What things ? "
10418	10434	10462	10462	he	565	" The things of the universe . It is quite true . They do n't . "
10435	10446	10448	10448	his	565	" Oh , Mr. Emerson , whatever do you mean ? "
10465	10495	10462	10462	he	565	" ' From far , from eve and morning , And yon twelve - winded sky , The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither : here am I '
10574	10574	10565	10565	I	0	"
10579	10615	10575	10576	Miss Honeychurch	112	" Then make my boy think like us . Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes - a transitory Yes if you like , but a Yes . "
10653	10659	10660	10660	she	112	" I 'm very sorry , "
10663	10674	10660	10660	she	112	" You 'll think me unfeeling , but - but - "
10680	10739	10676	10676	she	112	" Oh , but your son wants employment . Has he no particular hobby ? Why , I myself have worries , but I can generally forget them at the piano ; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother . Perhaps Italy bores him ; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes . "
10851	10855	10848	10848	He	574	" Miss Bartlett . "
10856	10863	10865	10865	Lucy	112	" Oh , good gracious me ! "
10881	10886	10865	10865	Lucy	112	" Where ? Where ? "
10887	10892	10848	10848	He	574	" In the nave . "
10893	10905	10906	10906	She	112	" I see . Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have - "
10910	10914	10916	10917	Mr. Emerson	149	" Poor girl ! "
10919	10923	10916	10917	Mr. Emerson	149	" Poor girl ! "
10941	11040	11041	11041	She	112	" Poor girl ? I fail to understand the point of that remark . I think myself a very fortunate girl , I assure you . I 'm thoroughly happy , and having a splendid time . Pray do n't waste time mourning over me . There 's enough sorrow in the world , is n't there , without trying to invent it . Good - bye . Thank you both so much for all your kindness . Ah , yes ! there does come my cousin . A delightful morning ! Santa Croce is a wonderful church . "
11056	11058	11041	11041	She	112	" S "
11588	11596	11598	11599	Mr. Beebe	116	" Miss Honeychurch . Piano . Beethoven , "
11738	11743	11744	11744	he	116	" Who is she ? "
11750	11798	11744	11744	he	116	" Cousin of one of my parishioners . I do not consider her choice of a piece happy . Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that , which , if anything , disturbs . "
11799	11803	11744	11744	he	116	" Introduce me . "
11804	11823	11744	11744	he	116	" She will be delighted . She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon . "
11824	11828	11830	11831	Mr. Beebe	116	" My sermon ? "
11833	11842	11830	11831	Mr. Beebe	116	" Why ever did she listen to it ? "
11946	11970	11935	11935	she	112	" If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays , it will be very exciting both for us and for her . "
11980	12009	11971	11971	Lucy	112	" Oh , what a funny thing ! Some one said just the same to mother , and she said she trusted I should never live a duet . "
12010	12018	11935	11935	she	112	" Does n't Mrs. Honeychurch like music ? "
12019	12097	11971	11971	Lucy	112	" She does n't mind it . But she does n't like one to get excited over anything ; she thinks I am silly about it . She thinks - I ca n't make out . Once , you know , I said that I liked my own playing better than any one 's . She has never got over it . Of course , I did n't mean that I played well ; I only meant - "
12098	12102	12104	12104	he	607	" Of course , "
12113	12116	12118	12118	Lucy	112	" Music - "
12212	12217	12219	12220	Mr. Beebe	116	" What about music ? "
12222	12229	12231	12231	Lucy	112	" Poor Charlotte will be sopped , "
12321	12343	12293	12293	she	111	" Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray . She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe . "
12344	12351	12353	12353	Lucy	112	" Miss Lavish is so original , "
12410	12415	12417	12417	Lucy	112	" Is it true , "
12424	12433	12417	12417	Lucy	112	" that Miss Lavish is writing a book ? "
12434	12440	12457	12458	Mr. Beebe	116	" They do say so . "
12441	12447	12417	12417	Lucy	112	" What is it about ? "
12448	12455	12457	12458	Mr. Beebe	116	" It will be a novel , "
12460	12490	12457	12458	Mr. Beebe	116	" dealing with modern Italy . Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan , who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know . "
12491	12549	12417	12417	Lucy	112	" I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself . We started such friends . But I do n't think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce . Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone , and so I could n't help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish . "
12550	12564	12565	12565	He	620	" The two ladies , at all events , have made it up . "
12806	12850	12792	12794	Miss Catharine Alan	144	" Oh , dear Miss Honeychurch , you will catch a chill ! And Mr. Beebe here besides . Who would suppose this is Italy ? There is my sister actually nursing the hot - water can ; no comforts or proper provisions . "
12882	12932	12863	12863	she	112	" I could hear your beautiful playing , Miss Honeychurch , though I was in my room with the door shut . Doors shut ; indeed , most necessary . No one has the least idea of privacy in this country . And one person catches it from another . "
12966	12973	12974	12974	He	116	" Fa niente , sono vecchia . "
12980	13129	12974	12974	He	116	" I quite agree with you , Miss Alan . The Italians are a most unpleasant people . They pry everywhere , they see everything , and they know what we want before we know it ourselves . We are at their mercy . They read our thoughts , they foretell our desires . From the cab - driver down to - to Giotto , they turn us inside out , and I resent it . Yet in their heart of hearts they are - how superficial ! They have no conception of the intellectual life . How right is Signora Bertolini , who exclaimed to me the other day : ' Ho , Mr. Beebe , if you knew what I suffer over the children 's edjucaishion . HI wo n't ' ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what ca n't explain nothink ! ' "
13242	13245	13224	13224	she	144	" E. L. "
13246	13252	13254	13255	the clergyman	332	" That belongs to Lavish . "
13257	13273	13254	13255	the clergyman	332	" A good fellow , Lavish , but I wish she 'd start a pipe . "
13274	13280	13282	13283	Miss Alan	144	" Oh , Mr. Beebe , "
13291	13341	13282	13283	Miss Alan	144	" Indeed , though it is dreadful for her to smoke , it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose . She took to it , practically in despair , after her life 's work was carried away in a landslip . Surely that makes it more excusable . "
13342	13347	13349	13349	Lucy	112	" What was that ? "
13364	13616	13358	13359	Miss Alan	144	" It was a novel - and I am afraid , from what I can gather , not a very nice novel . It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them , and I must say they nearly always do . Anyhow , she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink . She said : ' Can I have a little ink , please ? ' But you know what Italians are , and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach , and the saddest thing of all is that she can not remember what she has written . The poor thing was very ill after it , and so got tempted into cigarettes . It is a great secret , but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel . She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour - this novel is to be about modern Italy ; the other was historical - but that she could not start till she had an idea . First she tried Perugia for an inspiration , then she came here - this must on no account get round . And so cheerful through it all ! I can not help thinking that there is something to admire in every one , even if you do not approve of them . "
13674	13702	13657	13657	She	144	" All the same , she is a little too - I hardly like to say unwomanly , but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived . "
13729	13769	13795	13795	she	144	" I do n't know , Miss Honeychurch , if you have noticed that Miss Pole , the lady who has so much yellow hair , takes lemonade . That old Mr. Emerson , who puts things very strangely - "
13804	14243	13795	13795	she	144	" Stomach . He warned Miss Pole of her stomach - acidity , he called it - and he may have meant to be kind . I must say I forgot myself and laughed ; it was so sudden . As Teresa truly said , it was no laughing matter . But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively ATTRACTED by his mentioning S. , and said she liked plain speaking , and meeting different grades of thought . She thought they were commercial travellers - ' drummers ' was the word she used - and all through dinner she tried to prove that England , our great and beloved country , rests on nothing but commerce . Teresa was very much annoyed , and left the table before the cheese , saying as she did so : ' There , Miss Lavish , is one who can confute you better than I , ' and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson . Then Miss Lavish said : ' Tut ! The early Victorians . ' Just imagine ! ' Tut ! The early Victorians . ' My sister had gone , and I felt bound to speak . I said : ' Miss Lavish , I am an early Victorian ; at least , that is to say , I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen . ' It was horrible speaking . I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go , and I must say she was dumbfounded , and made no reply . But , unluckily , Mr. Emerson overheard this part , and called in his deep voice : ' Quite so , quite so ! I honour the woman for her Irish visit . ' The woman ! I tell things so badly ; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time , all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place . But that was not all . After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said : ' Miss Alan , I am going into the smoking - room to talk to those two nice men . Come , too . ' Needless to say , I refused such an unsuitable invitation , and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas , and said that she had four brothers , all University men , except one who was in the army , who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers . "
14244	14251	14253	14254	Mr. Beebe	116	" Let me finish the story , "
14260	14306	13795	13795	she	144	" Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole , myself , every one , and finally said : ' I shall go alone . ' She went . At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board , and began playing patience . "
14307	14311	14313	14313	Lucy	112	" Whatever happened ? "
14315	14344	13795	13795	she	144	" No one knows . No one will ever know . Miss Lavish will never dare to tell , and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling . "
14345	14367	13795	13795	she	144	" Mr. Beebe - old Mr. Emerson , is he nice or not nice ? I do so want to know . "
14382	14417	13795	13795	she	144	" No ; but it is so difficult . Sometimes he is so silly , and then I do not mind him . Miss Alan , what do you think ? Is he nice ? "
14444	14467	14430	14431	Mr. Beebe	116	" I consider that you are bound to class him as nice , Miss Alan , after that business of the violets . "
14468	14546	14430	14431	Mr. Beebe	116	" Violets ? Oh , dear ! Who told you about the violets ? How do things get round ? A pension is a bad place for gossips . No , I can not forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager 's lecture at Santa Croce . Oh , poor Miss Honeychurch ! It really was too bad . No , I have quite changed . I do NOT like the Emersons . They are not nice . "
14774	14790	14792	14794	the little lady	650	" But are n't they always waylaying you to go out with them , dear ? "
14797	14817	14792	14794	the little lady	650	" Only once . Charlotte did n't like it , and said something - quite politely , of course . "
14818	14837	14792	14794	the little lady	650	" Most right of her . They do n't understand our ways . They must find their level . "
14995	15002	15004	15005	Miss Alan	144	" Too late to go out , "
15012	15019	15004	15005	Miss Alan	144	" All the galleries are shut . "
15020	15028	15030	15030	Lucy	112	" I think I shall go out , "
15032	15052	15030	15030	Lucy	112	" I want to go round the town in the circular tram - on the platform by the driver . "
15078	15107	15059	15060	Mr. Beebe	116	" I wish we could . Unluckily I have letters . If you do want to go out alone , wo n't you be better on your feet ? "
15108	15116	15118	15119	Miss Alan	144	" Italians , dear , you know , "
15121	15135	15059	15060	Mr. Beebe	116	" Perhaps I shall meet some one who reads me through and through ! "
15172	15182	15184	15185	Mr. Beebe	116	" She ought n't really to go at all , "
15195	15210	15184	15185	Mr. Beebe	116	" and she knows it . I put it down to too much Beethoven . "
15706	15711	15712	15712	Venus	163	" Birth of Venus . "
15749	15752	15727	15728	Miss Bartlett	111	" Tempesta , "
15754	15757	15747	15747	Giorgione	164	" Idolino , "
15784	15787	15788	15788	Giotto	136	" Coronation , "
15790	15796	15815	15815	she	112	" Ascension of St. John , "
15860	15864	15865	15865	she	112	" The world , "
15868	15884	15865	15865	she	112	" is certainly full of beautiful things , if only I could come across them . "
15910	15917	15918	15918	she	112	" Nothing ever happens to me , "
16155	16159	16160	16160	they	698	" Cinque lire , "
16164	16168	16169	16169	They	698	" cinque lire ! "
16332	16340	16329	16329	She	112	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16341	16349	16350	16350	she	112	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16425	16433	16422	16422	She	112	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16434	16438	16422	16422	She	112	" You fainted . "
16439	16447	16422	16422	She	112	" I - I am very sorry . "
16448	16454	16422	16422	She	112	" How are you now ? "
16455	16462	16464	16464	she	112	" Perfectly well - absolutely well . "
16471	16486	16487	16487	He	693	" Then let us come home . There 's no point in our stopping . "
16530	16559	16487	16487	He	693	" How very kind you have been ! I might have hurt myself falling . But now I am well . I can go alone , thank you . "
16566	16572	16573	16573	she	112	" Oh , my photographs ! "
16577	16581	16573	16573	she	112	" What photographs ? "
16582	16602	16603	16603	She	112	" I bought some photographs at Alinari 's . I must have dropped them out there in the square . "
16609	16620	16603	16603	She	112	" Would you add to your kindness by fetching them ? "
16653	16657	16658	16658	She	112	" Miss Honeychurch ! "
16667	16681	16658	16658	She	112	" You sit still ; you are n't fit to go home alone . "
16682	16694	16658	16658	She	112	" Yes , I am , thank you so very much . "
16695	16710	16658	16658	She	112	" No , you are n't . You 'd go openly if you were . "
16711	16717	16658	16658	She	112	" But I had rather - "
16718	16727	16658	16658	She	112	" Then I do n't fetch your photographs . "
16728	16735	16658	16658	She	112	" I had rather be alone . "
16740	16759	16736	16736	He	712	" The man is dead - the man is probably dead ; sit down till you are rested . "
16768	16778	16766	16766	him	712	" And do n't move till I come back . "
16835	16843	16833	16833	her	112	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16951	17010	16941	16942	a cabman	719	" And the murderer tried to kiss him , you say - how very odd Italians are ! - and gave himself up to the police ! Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything , but I think they are rather childish . When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday - What was that ? "
17019	17026	17011	17011	He	719	" What did you throw in ? "
17027	17034	17035	17035	he	719	" Things I did n't want , "
17039	17043	17011	17011	He	719	" Mr. Emerson ! "
17044	17047	17011	17011	He	719	" Well ? "
17048	17054	17011	17011	He	719	" Where are the photographs ? "
17059	17071	17055	17055	He	719	" I believe it was my photographs that you threw away . "
17072	17083	17084	17084	he	719	" I did n't know what to do with them , "
17107	17141	17142	17142	He	719	" They were covered with blood . There ! I 'm glad I 've told you ; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them . "
17148	17153	17142	17142	He	719	" They 've gone . "
17161	17200	17242	17242	him	719	" I did mind them so , and one is so foolish , it seemed better that they should go out to the sea - I do n't know ; I may just mean that they frightened me . "
17209	17234	17202	17203	the boy	727	" For something tremendous has happened ; I must face it without getting muddled . It is n't exactly that a man has died . "
17244	17249	17250	17250	he	719	" It has happened , "
17253	17264	17250	17250	he	719	" and I mean to find out what it is . "
17265	17269	17270	17270	He	719	" Mr. Emerson - "
17287	17299	17270	17270	He	719	" I want to ask you something before we go in . "
17356	17362	17349	17349	She	112	" I have behaved ridiculously . "
17370	17392	17363	17363	He	719	" I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life ; I can not think what came over me . "
17393	17399	17400	17400	he	719	" I nearly fainted myself , "
17412	17422	17404	17404	she	112	" Well , I owe you a thousand apologies . "
17423	17429	17404	17404	she	112	" Oh , all right . "
17430	17460	17404	17404	she	112	" And - this is the real point - you know how silly people are gossiping - ladies especially , I am afraid - you understand what I mean ? "
17461	17469	17404	17404	she	112	" I 'm afraid I do n't . "
17470	17487	17404	17404	she	112	" I mean , would you not mention it to any one , my foolish behaviour ? "
17488	17502	17404	17404	she	112	" Your behaviour ? Oh , yes , all right - all right . "
17503	17513	17404	17404	she	112	" Thank you so much . And would you - "
17627	17632	17636	17636	he	734	" And would you - "
17726	17734	17735	17735	she	112	" Well , thank you so much , "
17738	17755	17735	17735	she	112	" How quickly these accidents do happen , and then one returns to the old life ! "
17756	17761	17762	17762	Anxiety	167	" I do n't . "
17774	17782	17769	17769	His	734	" I shall probably want to live . "
17783	17795	17762	17762	Anxiety	167	" But why , Mr. Emerson ? What do you mean ? "
17796	17806	17769	17769	His	734	" I shall want to live , I say . "
17845	17856	17857	17857	She	112	" you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn . "
18005	18010	17983	17984	Mr. Beebe	116	" Too much Beethoven . "
18172	18177	18179	18180	the girl	333	" No , Charlotte ! "
18186	18208	18179	18180	the girl	333	" It 's very kind of Mr. Beebe , but I am certainly coming with you . I had much rather . "
18209	18215	18217	18218	Miss Bartlett	111	" Very well , dear , "
18323	18338	18314	18314	She	111	" How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this , too ! "
18355	18382	18352	18352	she	111	" Look , Lucia ! Oh , you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party . I feared you would repent you of your choice . "
18591	18599	18601	18602	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , let me congratulate you ! "
18604	18616	18601	18602	Miss Bartlett	111	" After your despair of yesterday ! What a fortunate thing ! "
18617	18647	18648	18648	Lucy	112	" Aha ! Miss Honeychurch , come you here I am in luck . Now , you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning . "
18657	18665	18648	18648	Lucy	112	" But perhaps you would rather not ? "
18666	18685	18648	18648	Lucy	112	" I 'm sorry - if you could manage without it , I think I would rather not . "
18706	18714	18716	18717	Miss Lavish	128	" It is I who am sorry , "
18718	18742	18761	18761	she	128	" literary hacks are shameless creatures . I believe there 's no secret of the human heart into which we would n't pry . "
18837	18845	18847	18848	Miss Bartlett	111	" What is the heroine 's name ? "
18850	18853	18855	18856	Miss Lavish	128	" Leonora , "
18864	18872	18847	18848	Miss Bartlett	111	" I do hope she 's nice . "
18880	18887	18847	18848	Miss Bartlett	111	" And what is the plot ? "
18916	18929	18930	18931	Miss Lavish	128	" I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this , "
18934	18999	18930	18931	Miss Lavish	128	" It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people . Of course , this is the barest outline . There will be a deal of local colouring , descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood , and I shall also introduce some humorous characters . And let me give you all fair warning : I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist . "
19000	19007	19009	19010	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , you wicked woman , "
19012	19023	19009	19010	Miss Bartlett	111	" I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons . "
19031	19103	19024	19025	Miss Lavish	128	" I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen . It is the neglected Italians who attract me , and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can . For I repeat and I insist , and I have always held most strongly , that a tragedy such as yesterday 's is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life . "
19132	19143	19145	19146	Miss Bartlett	111	" She is my idea of a really clever woman , "
19148	19167	19145	19146	Miss Bartlett	111	" That last remark struck me as so particularly true . It should be a most pathetic novel . "
19206	19222	19224	19225	Miss Bartlett	111	" She is emancipated , but only in the very best sense of the word , "
19228	19285	19224	19225	Miss Bartlett	111	" None but the superficial would be shocked at her . We had a long talk yesterday . She believes in justice and truth and human interest . She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman - Mr. Eager ! Why , how nice ! What a pleasant surprise ! "
19286	19293	19295	19296	the chaplain	774	" Ah , not for me , "
19299	19315	19295	19296	the chaplain	774	" for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time . "
19316	19324	19224	19225	Miss Bartlett	111	" We were chatting to Miss Lavish . "
19329	19344	19351	19362	a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile	775	" So I saw . Were you indeed ? Andate via ! sono occupato ! "
19364	19493	19351	19362	a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile	775	" I am about to venture a suggestion . Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week - a drive in the hills ? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano . There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour 's ramble on the hillside . The view thence of Florence is most beautiful - far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole . It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures . That man had a decided feeling for landscape . Decidedly . But who looks at it to - day ? Ah , the world is too much for us . "
19794	19803	19805	19806	the chaplain	774	" So we shall be a partie carree , "
19808	19852	19805	19806	the chaplain	774	" In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity . Andate via ! andate presto , presto ! Ah , the town ! Beautiful as it is , it is the town . "
19856	19896	19805	19806	the chaplain	774	" This very square - so I am told - witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies . To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration - portentous and humiliating . "
19897	19901	19903	19904	Miss Bartlett	111	" Humiliating indeed , "
19906	19927	19928	19928	She	111	" Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened . She can hardly bear to speak of it . "
19934	19944	19946	19947	the chaplain	774	" And how came we to have you here ? "
19961	19982	19950	19951	Miss Bartlett	111	" Do not blame her , please , Mr. Eager . The fault is mine : I left her unchaperoned . "
19983	19993	19994	19994	His	774	" So you were here alone , Miss Honeychurch ? "
20029	20032	20015	20015	His	774	" Practically . "
20033	20044	20046	20047	Miss Bartlett	111	" One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home , "
20057	20088	20015	20015	His	774	" For her also it must have been a terrible experience . I trust that neither of you was at all - that it was not in your immediate proximity ? "
20128	20138	20140	20140	her	112	" He died by the fountain , I believe , "
20143	20150	20119	20120	George Emerson	115	" And you and your friend - "
20151	20158	20119	20120	George Emerson	115	" Were over at the Loggia . "
20159	20213	20119	20120	George Emerson	115	" That must have saved you much . You have not , of course , seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press - This man is a public nuisance ; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well , and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views . "
20264	20270	20272	20273	the chaplain	774	" This is too much ! "
20310	20316	20318	20319	Miss Bartlett	111	" Willingly would I purchase - "
20321	20325	20327	20328	Mr. Eager	146	" Ignore him , "
20672	20716	20717	20717	They	798	" The son of a labourer ; I happen to know it for a fact . A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young ; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press . I came across him at Brixton . "
20724	20733	20735	20736	Miss Bartlett	111	" How wonderfully people rise in these days ! "
20748	20751	20753	20754	Mr. Eager	146	" Generally , "
20756	20810	20753	20754	Mr. Eager	146	" one has only sympathy for their success . The desire for education and for social advance - in these things there is something not wholly vile . There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence - little as they would make of it . "
20811	20818	20819	20820	Miss Bartlett	111	" Is he a journalist now ? "
20823	20834	20819	20820	Miss Bartlett	111	" He is not ; he made an advantageous marriage . "
20852	20861	20753	20754	Mr. Eager	146	" Oh , so he has a wife . "
20862	20936	20835	20835	He	146	" Dead , Miss Bartlett , dead . I wonder - yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face , to dare to claim acquaintance with me . He was in my London parish long ago . The other day in Santa Croce , when he was with Miss Honeychurch , I snubbed him . Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub . "
20937	20940	20942	20942	Lucy	112	" What ? "
20946	20949	20951	20952	Mr. Eager	146	" Exposure ! "
21010	21015	21016	21016	she	112	" Do you mean , "
21019	21032	21016	21016	she	112	" that he is an irreligious man ? We know that already . "
21033	21038	21040	21041	Miss Bartlett	111	" Lucy , dear - "
21050	21088	21016	21016	she	112	" I should be astonished if you knew all . The boy - an innocent child at the time - I will exclude . God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him . "
21089	21092	21094	21095	Miss Bartlett	111	" Perhaps , "
21097	21108	21094	21095	Miss Bartlett	111	" it is something that we had better not hear . "
21109	21114	21116	21117	Mr. Eager	146	" To speak plainly , "
21119	21129	21116	21117	Mr. Eager	146	" it is . I will say no more . "
21151	21158	21175	21175	He	146	" You have said very little . "
21159	21169	21171	21171	his	146	" It was my intention to say very little , "
21225	21234	21235	21235	he	146	" Murder , if you want to know , "
21239	21246	21235	21235	he	146	" That man murdered his wife ! "
21247	21250	21251	21251	she	333	" How ? "
21254	21277	21235	21235	he	146	" To all intents and purposes he murdered her . That day in Santa Croce - did they say anything against me ? "
21278	21291	21235	21235	he	146	" Not a word , Mr. Eager - not a single word . "
21292	21320	21235	21235	he	146	" Oh , I thought they had been libelling me to you . But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them . "
21321	21328	21330	21330	Lucy	112	" I 'm not defending them , "
21344	21351	21330	21330	Lucy	112	" They 're nothing to me . "
21352	21362	21364	21365	Miss Bartlett	111	" How could you think she was defending them ? "
21380	21400	21374	21375	The shopman	813	" She will find it difficult . For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God . "
21451	21457	21459	21459	he	813	" I must be going , "
21487	21499	21470	21471	Miss Bartlett	111	" Drive ? Oh , is our drive to come off ? "
21520	21525	21527	21528	the girl	333	" Bother the drive ! "
21537	21579	21527	21528	the girl	333	" It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all . Why should he invite us in that absurd manner ? We might as well invite him . We are each paying for ourselves . "
21601	21644	21580	21581	Miss Bartlett	111	" If that is so , dear - if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr. Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe , then I foresee a sad kettle of fish . "
21645	21648	21725	21726	the Graphic	820	" How ? "
21649	21662	21580	21581	Miss Bartlett	111	" Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come , too . "
21663	21670	21725	21726	the Graphic	820	" That will mean another carriage . "
21671	21700	21580	21581	Miss Bartlett	111	" Far worse . Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor . She knows it herself . The truth must be told ; she is too unconventional for him . "
21861	21868	21877	21877	she	664	" where things might lead to , "
21947	22042	21944	21944	she	664	" Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager , or Mr. Eager who forgot when he told us , or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether - which they could scarcely do - but in any case we must be prepared . It is you they really want ; I am only asked for appearances . You shall go with the two gentlemen , and I and Eleanor will follow behind . A one - horse carriage would do for us . Yet how difficult it is ! "
22043	22048	22050	22051	the girl	333	" It is indeed , "
22060	22068	22070	22071	Miss Bartlett	111	" What do you think about it ? "
22084	22098	22050	22051	the girl	333	" I do n't know what I think , nor what I want . "
22099	22139	22070	22071	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , dear , Lucy ! I do hope Florence is n't boring you . Speak the word , and , as you know , I would take you to the ends of the earth to - morrow . "
22140	22146	22148	22148	Lucy	112	" Thank you , Charlotte , "
22325	22330	22332	22333	Miss Bartlett	111	" And the news ? "
22335	22346	22348	22348	Lucy	112	" Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome , "
22358	22365	22348	22348	Lucy	112	" Do you know the Vyses ? "
22366	22386	22332	22333	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , not that way back . We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria . "
22387	22416	22348	22348	Lucy	112	" They 're nice people , the Vyses . So clever - my idea of what 's really clever . Do n't you long to be in Rome ? "
22417	22423	22332	22333	Miss Bartlett	111	" I die for it ! "
22555	22558	22560	22561	the girl	333	" Charlotte ! "
22564	22620	22560	22561	the girl	333	" Here 's an idea . What if we popped off to Rome to - morrow - straight to the Vyses ' hotel ? For I do know what I want . I 'm sick of Florence . No , you said you 'd go to the ends of the earth ! Do ! Do ! "
22630	22649	22621	22622	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , you droll person ! Pray , what would become of your drive in the hills ? "
23418	23434	23403	23405	Meanwhile Mr. Eager	146	" So , Miss Honeychurch , you are travelling ? As a student of art ? "
23435	23447	23403	23405	Meanwhile Mr. Eager	146	" Oh , dear me , no - oh , no ! "
23448	23457	23459	23460	Miss Lavish	128	" Perhaps as a student of human nature , "
23462	23466	23459	23460	Miss Lavish	128	" like myself ? "
23467	23479	23403	23405	Meanwhile Mr. Eager	146	" Oh , no . I am here as a tourist . "
23480	23485	23487	23488	Mr. Eager	146	" Oh , indeed , "
23490	23639	23487	23488	Mr. Eager	146	" Are you indeed ? If you will not think me rude , we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little - handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence , from Florence to Rome , living herded together in pensions or hotels , quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker , their one anxiety to get ' done ' or ' through ' and go on somewhere else . The result is , they mix up towns , rivers , palaces in one inextricable whirl . You know the American girl in Punch who says : ' Say , poppa , what did we see at Rome ? ' And the father replies : ' Why , guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog . ' There 's travelling for you . Ha ! ha ! ha ! "
23640	23645	23647	23648	Miss Lavish	128	" I quite agree , "
23661	23679	23647	23648	Miss Lavish	128	" The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo - Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace . "
23680	23821	23487	23488	Mr. Eager	146	" Quite so . Now , the English colony at Florence , Miss Honeychurch - and it is of considerable size , though , of course , not all equally - a few are here for trade , for example . But the greater part are students . Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico . I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left . No , you can only see it if you stand - no , do not stand ; you will fall . She is very proud of that thick hedge . Inside , perfect seclusion . One might have gone back six hundred years . Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron , which lends it an additional interest , does it not ? "
23822	23827	23829	23830	Miss Lavish	128	" It does indeed ! "
23832	23848	23829	23830	Miss Lavish	128	" Tell me , where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day ? "
23888	23984	23879	23881	the Somebody Elses	886	" Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ' Mediaeval Byways ' ? He is working at Gemistus Pletho . Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear , over the wall , the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot , dusty , unintelligent tourists who are going to ' do ' Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there , and I think - think - I think how little they think what lies so near them . "
24055	24060	24062	24063	Mr. Eager	146	" Piano ! piano ! "
24073	24085	24087	24088	the driver	2165	" Va bene , signore , va bene , va bene , "
24166	24171	24173	24173	he	168	" Piano ! piano ! "
24256	24262	24264	24264	he	168	" She is my sister , "
24362	24371	24372	24372	she	128	" Most certainly I would let them be , "
24375	24408	24372	24372	she	128	" But I dare say I shall receive scant support . I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life . This is what I call an adventure . "
24409	24415	24417	24418	Mr. Eager	146	" We must not submit , "
24420	24444	24417	24418	Mr. Eager	146	" I knew he was trying it on . He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook 's tourists . "
24445	24449	24451	24452	Miss Lavish	128	" Surely no ! "
24487	24492	24493	24494	Mr. Emerson	115	" Leave them alone , "
24507	24556	24496	24497	the chaplain	774	" Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there ? To be driven by lovers - A king might envy us , and if we part them it 's more like sacrilege than anything I know . "
24671	24674	24676	24677	the man	2351	" Signorina ! "
24694	24697	24701	24701	her	184	" Signorina ! "
24733	24738	24740	24741	Mr. Eager	146	" Victory at last ! "
24753	24759	24761	24762	Mr. Emerson	115	" It is not victory , "
24764	24778	24761	24762	Mr. Emerson	115	" It is defeat . You have parted two people who were happy . "
24834	24869	24826	24826	he	310	" We have tried to buy what can not be bought with money . He has bargained to drive us , and he is doing it . We have no rights over his soul . "
24892	24900	24901	24901	she	128	" He was not driving us well , "
24904	24909	24901	24901	she	128	" He jolted us . "
24910	24982	24870	24871	Miss Lavish	128	" That I deny . It was as restful as sleeping . Aha ! he is jolting us now . Can you wonder ? He would like to throw us out , and most certainly he is justified . And if I were superstitious I 'd be frightened of the girl , too . It does n't do to injure young people . Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici ? "
24987	25021	24983	24984	Miss Lavish	128	" Most certainly I have . Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico , or to Lorenzo , Duke of Urbino , or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature ? "
25022	25065	24983	24984	Miss Lavish	128	" The Lord knows . Possibly he does know , for I refer to Lorenzo the poet . He wrote a line - so I heard yesterday - which runs like this : ' Do n't go fighting against the Spring . ' "
25076	25083	25084	25084	he	146	" Non fate guerra al Maggio , "
25087	25101	25084	25084	he	146	" ' War not with the May ' would render a correct meaning . "
25102	25115	25116	25116	He	146	" The point is , we have warred with it . Look . "
25135	25190	25116	25116	He	146	" Fifty miles of Spring , and we 've come up to admire them . Do you suppose there 's any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man ? But there we go , praising the one and condemning the other as improper , ashamed that the same work eternally through both . "
25553	25557	25550	25550	he	115	" the railway . "
25615	25619	25621	25622	Miss Lavish	128	" The railway ! "
25624	25639	25621	25622	Miss Lavish	128	" Oh , but I shall die ! Of course it was the railway ! "
25647	25664	25640	25640	She	128	" He is the image of a porter - on , on the South - Eastern . "
25665	25671	25674	25676	her vivacious companion	942	" Eleanor , be quiet , "
25678	25688	25674	25676	her vivacious companion	942	" Hush ! They 'll hear - the Emersons - "
25689	25705	25741	25742	Miss Lavish	128	" I ca n't stop . Let me go my wicked way . A porter - "
25706	25709	25674	25676	her vivacious companion	942	" Eleanor ! "
25710	25719	25722	25722	Lucy	112	" I 'm sure it 's all right , "
25724	25740	25722	25722	Lucy	112	" The Emersons wo n't hear , and they would n't mind if they did . "
25750	25755	25756	25756	she	128	" Miss Honeychurch listening ! "
25761	25773	25756	25756	she	128	" Pouf ! Wouf ! You naughty girl ! Go away ! "
25774	25791	25674	25676	her vivacious companion	942	" Oh , Lucy , you ought to be with Mr. Eager , I 'm sure . "
25792	25808	25756	25756	she	128	" I ca n't find them now , and I do n't want to either . "
25809	25821	25674	25676	her vivacious companion	942	" Mr. Eager will be offended . It is your party . "
25822	25833	25756	25756	she	128	" Please , I 'd rather stop here with you . "
25834	25840	25842	25843	Miss Lavish	128	" No , I agree , "
25845	25882	25842	25843	Miss Lavish	128	" It 's like a school feast ; the boys have got separated from the girls . Miss Lucy , you are to go . We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear . "
25951	25957	25959	25960	Miss Bartlett	111	" How tired one gets , "
25962	25976	25959	25960	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here . "
26010	26016	26018	26019	Miss Lavish	128	" Then sit you down , "
26021	26026	26018	26019	Miss Lavish	128	" Observe my foresight . "
26066	26122	26123	26123	She	128	" Lucy ; without a moment 's doubt , Lucy . The ground will do for me . Really I have not had rheumatism for years . If I do feel it coming on I shall stand . Imagine your mother 's feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen . "
26134	26176	26177	26177	She	128	" Here we are , all settled delightfully . Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much , being brown . Sit down , dear ; you are too unselfish ; you do n't assert yourself enough . "
26182	26220	26179	26179	her	128	" Now do n't be alarmed ; this is n't a cold . It 's the tiniest cough , and I have had it three days . It 's nothing to do with sitting here at all . "
26304	26307	26309	26309	Lucy	112	" Dove ? "
26385	26387	26351	26351	He	949	" clergyman "
26389	26394	26396	26396	she	112	" Dove buoni uomini ? "
26416	26423	26425	26425	her	112	" Uno - piu - piccolo , "
26430	26450	26425	26425	her	112	" Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe , the smaller of the two good men ? "
26629	26637	26610	26610	His	949	" would she like to see them ? "
26638	26643	26610	26610	His	949	" Ma buoni uomini . "
26736	26741	26762	26762	He	949	" What is that ? "
26813	26816	26817	26817	he	949	" Eccolo ! "
26866	26869	26871	26872	her companion	974	" Courage ! "
26881	26886	26871	26872	her companion	974	" Courage and love . "
27077	27084	27054	27054	He	115	" Lucy ! Lucy ! Lucy ! "
27327	27333	27334	27334	he	183	" Let us go immediately , "
27338	27344	27334	27334	he	183	" The signorino will walk . "
27345	27355	27357	27358	Mr. Beebe	116	" All the way ? He will be hours , "
27360	27370	27371	27371	He	183	" Apparently . I told him it was unwise . "
27684	27739	27678	27679	Mr. Eager	146	" Courage , Miss Honeychurch , courage and faith . If I might say so , there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements . Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds , all this immense electrical display , is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me ? "
27740	27746	27678	27679	Mr. Eager	146	" No - of course - "
27747	27803	27678	27679	Mr. Eager	146	" Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous . The steel knives , the only articles which might attract the current , are in the other carriage . And , in any case , we are infinitely safer than if we were walking . Courage - courage and faith . "
27889	27893	27895	27896	Mr. Beebe	116	" Mr. Eager ! "
27898	27910	27895	27896	Mr. Beebe	116	" We want your assistance . Will you interpret for us ? "
27911	27914	27916	27917	Mr. Emerson	115	" George ! "
27919	27940	27916	27917	Mr. Emerson	115	" Ask your driver which way George went . The boy may lose his way . He may be killed . "
27941	27947	27949	27950	Miss Bartlett	111	" Go , Mr. Eager , "
27952	27978	27949	27950	Miss Bartlett	111	" do n't ask our driver ; our driver is no help . Go and support poor Mr. Beebe - , he is nearly demented . "
27979	27985	27987	27989	the old man	310	" He may be killed ! "
27991	27997	27987	27989	the old man	310	" He may be killed ! "
27998	28002	28004	28005	the chaplain	774	" Typical behaviour , "
28013	28027	28008	28008	he	774	" In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down . "
28028	28034	28036	28036	Lucy	112	" What does he know ? "
28044	28054	28036	28036	Lucy	112	" Charlotte , how much does Mr. Eager know ? "
28055	28066	28067	28067	she	112	" Nothing , dearest ; he knows nothing . But - "
28071	28084	28085	28085	She	112	driver-"HE knows everything . Dearest , had we better ? Shall I ? "
28091	28109	28088	28088	her	112	" It is dreadful to be entangled with low - class people . He saw it all . "
28123	28126	28120	28120	she	112	" Silenzio ! "
28133	28137	28138	28138	he	1009	" Va bene , "
28353	28388	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" Charlotte , dear Charlotte , kiss me . Kiss me again . Only you can understand me . You warned me to be careful . And I - I thought I was developing . "
28389	28400	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" Do not cry , dearest . Take your time . "
28401	28439	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" I have been obstinate and silly - worse than you know , far worse . Once by the river - Oh , but he is n't killed - he would n't be killed , would he ? "
28479	28491	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" I trust not . One would always pray against that . "
28492	28583	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" He is really - I think he was taken by surprise , just as I was before . But this time I 'm not to blame ; I want you to believe that . I simply slipped into those violets . No , I want to be really truthful . I am a little to blame . I had silly thoughts . The sky , you know , was gold , and the ground all blue , and for a moment he looked like some one in a book . "
28584	28589	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" In a book ? "
28590	28600	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" Heroes - gods - the nonsense of schoolgirls . "
28601	28605	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" And then ? "
28606	28617	28345	28345	Lucy	112	" But , Charlotte , you know what happened then . "
28665	28672	28673	28673	she	112	" I want to be truthful , "
28676	28686	28673	28673	she	112	" It is so hard to be absolutely truthful . "
28687	28714	28673	28673	she	112	" Do n't be troubled , dearest . Wait till you are calmer . We will talk it over before bed - time in my room . "
28863	28867	28869	28869	she	112	" At last , "
28871	28899	28869	28869	she	112	" I shall understand myself . I sha n't again be troubled by things that come out of nothing , and mean I do n't know what . "
29008	29038	29001	29001	her	111	" Well , dear , I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire . Come into my room , and I will give a good brush to your hair . "
29060	29068	29057	29058	Miss Bartlett	111	" So what is to be done ? "
29104	29122	29152	29153	Miss Bartlett	111	" What is to be done ? A point , dearest , which you alone can settle . "
29214	29224	29225	29225	she	112	" It has been raining for nearly four hours , "
29236	29245	29191	29191	She	112	" How do you propose to silence him ? "
29246	29250	29191	29191	She	112	" The driver ? "
29251	29262	29191	29191	She	112	" My dear girl , no ; Mr. George Emerson . "
29273	29279	29280	29280	she	112	" I do n't understand , "
29300	29312	29191	29191	She	112	" How are you going to stop him talking about it ? "
29313	29328	29191	29191	She	112	" I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do . "
29329	29357	29191	29191	She	112	" I , too , intend to judge him charitably . But unfortunately I have met the type before . They seldom keep their exploits to themselves . "
29358	29361	29363	29363	Lucy	112	" Exploits ? "
29371	29427	29191	29191	She	112	" My poor dear , did you suppose that this was his first ? Come here and listen to me . I am only gathering it from his own remarks . Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another ? "
29428	29431	29433	29433	Lucy	112	" Yes , "
29444	29504	29191	29191	She	112	" Well , I am no prude . There is no need to call him a wicked young man , but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined . Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education , if you wish . But we are no farther on with our question . What do you propose to do ? "
29533	29541	29543	29543	she	112	" I propose to speak to him , "
29554	29584	29545	29546	Miss Bartlett	111	" You see , Charlotte , your kindness - I shall never forget it . But - as you said - it is my affair . Mine and his . "
29585	29601	29732	29732	her	112	" And you are going to IMPLORE him , to BEG him to keep silence ? "
29602	29644	29545	29546	Miss Bartlett	111	" Certainly not . There would be no difficulty . Whatever you ask him he answers , yes or no ; then it is over . I have been frightened of him . But now I am not one little bit . "
29645	29718	29732	29732	her	112	" But we fear him for you , dear . You are so young and inexperienced , you have lived among such nice people , that you can not realize what men can be - how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round . This afternoon , for example , if I had not arrived , what would have happened ? "
29719	29725	29727	29727	Lucy	112	" I ca n't think , "
29746	29757	29732	29732	her	112	" What would have happened if I had n't arrived ? "
29758	29764	29766	29766	Lucy	112	" I ca n't think , "
29769	29781	29732	29732	her	112	" When he insulted you , how would you have replied ? "
29782	29793	29732	29732	her	112	" I had n't time to think . You came . "
29794	29810	29732	29732	her	112	" Yes , but wo n't you tell me now what you would have done ? "
29811	29816	29817	29817	She	112	" I should have - "
29852	29861	29863	29864	Miss Bartlett	111	" Come away from the window , dear , "
29866	29875	29863	29864	Miss Bartlett	111	" You will be seen from the road . "
29935	30015	29930	29931	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , for a real man ! We are only two women , you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless . There is Mr. Eager , but you do not trust him . Oh , for your brother ! He is young , but I know that his sister 's insult would rouse in him a very lion . Thank God , chivalry is not yet dead . There are still left some men who can reverence woman . "
30049	30066	30041	30041	she	111	" It will be a push to catch the morning train , but we must try . "
30067	30071	30041	30041	she	111	" What train ? "
30072	30078	30079	30079	She	111	" The train to Rome . "
30099	30108	30041	30041	she	111	" When does the train to Rome go ? "
30109	30113	30079	30079	She	111	" At eight . "
30114	30121	30041	30041	she	111	" Signora Bertolini would be upset . "
30122	30128	30130	30131	Miss Bartlett	111	" We must face that , "
30144	30157	30041	30041	she	111	" She will make us pay for a whole week 's pension . "
30158	30187	30041	30041	she	111	" I expect she will . However , we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses ' hotel . Is n't afternoon tea given there for nothing ? "
30188	30198	30202	30202	she	111	" Yes , but they pay extra for wine . "
30479	30490	30471	30471	she	111	" Dearest Lucy , how will you ever forgive me ? "
30524	30541	30521	30521	she	112	" Charlotte dear , what do you mean ? As if I have anything to forgive ! "
30542	30574	30521	30521	she	112	" You have a great deal , and I have a very great deal to forgive myself , too . I know well how much I vex you at every turn . "
30575	30579	30521	30521	she	112	" But no - "
30594	30655	30521	30521	she	112	" Ah , but yes ! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped . I might have known it would not do . You want some one younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you . I am too uninteresting and old - fashioned - only fit to pack and unpack your things . "
30656	30659	30521	30521	she	112	" Please - "
30660	30726	30521	30521	she	112	" My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste , and were often able to leave me at home . I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do , but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary . You had your own way about these rooms , at all events . "
30727	30735	30737	30737	Lucy	112	" You must n't say these things , "
30765	30772	30778	30778	she	111	" I have been a failure , "
30793	30826	30778	30778	she	111	" Failed to make you happy ; failed in my duty to your mother . She has been so generous to me ; I shall never face her again after this disaster . "
30827	30850	30778	30778	she	111	" But mother will understand . It is not your fault , this trouble , and it is n't a disaster either . "
30851	30885	30778	30778	she	111	" It is my fault , it is a disaster . She will never forgive me , and rightly . Fur instance , what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish ? "
30886	30890	30778	30778	she	111	" Every right . "
30891	30931	30778	30778	she	111	" When I was here for your sake ? If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you . Your mother will see this as clearly as I do , when you tell her . "
30945	30953	30932	30932	Lucy	112	" Why need mother hear of it ? "
30954	30961	30778	30778	she	111	" But you tell her everything ? "
30962	30969	30932	30932	Lucy	112	" I suppose I do generally . "
30970	30999	30778	30778	she	111	" I dare not break your confidence . There is something sacred in it . Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her . "
31009	31055	30932	30932	Lucy	112	" Naturally I should have told her . But in case she should blame you in any way , I promise I will not , I am very willing not to . I will never speak of it either to her or to any one . "
31485	31503	31481	31481	her	111	" I wish one word with you in the drawing - room , Mr. Emerson , please . "
31514	31522	31510	31511	Miss Bartlett	111	" Good - night , Mr. Emerson . "
31544	31571	31540	31540	Lucy	112	" It is n't true . It ca n't all be true . I want not to be muddled . I want to grow older quickly . "
31579	31597	31572	31573	Miss Bartlett	111	" Go to bed at once , dear . You need all the rest you can get . "
31673	31683	31662	31663	A poet	1071	" Life like a dome of many coloured glass , "
31847	31853	31855	31856	the boy	727	" Where are n't they ? "
31866	31876	31855	31856	the boy	727	" I tell you I 'm getting fairly sick . "
31877	31892	31894	31895	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" For goodness ' sake go out of my drawing - room , then ? "
31917	31927	31928	31928	she	152	" I think things are coming to a head , "
31949	31954	31928	31928	she	152	" Time they did . "
31955	31968	31928	31928	she	152	" I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more . "
31969	31980	31928	31928	she	152	" It 's his third go , is n't it ? "
31981	31992	31928	31928	she	152	" Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind . "
31993	32002	32004	32004	he	121	" I did n't mean to be unkind . "
32007	32071	32004	32004	he	121	" But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy . I do n't know how girls manage things , but she ca n't have said ' No ' properly before , or she would n't have to say it again now . Over the whole thing - I ca n't explain - I do feel so uncomfortable . "
32072	32082	31928	31928	she	152	" Do you indeed , dear ? How interesting ! "
32083	32090	32004	32004	he	121	" I feel - never mind . "
32097	32118	31928	31928	she	152	" Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse . I said : ' Dear Mrs. Vyse . ' "
32119	32133	31928	31928	she	152	" Yes , mother , you told me . A jolly good letter . "
32134	32166	32167	32167	She	1083	" I said : ' Dear Mrs. Vyse , Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted , if Lucy wishes it . But - ' "
32171	32215	32167	32167	She	1083	" I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all . He has always gone in for unconventionality , and parents nowhere , and so forth . When it comes to the point , he ca n't get on without me . "
32216	32220	31928	31928	she	152	" Nor me . "
32221	32224	32167	32167	She	1083	" You ? "
32228	32234	32225	32225	Freddy	121	" What do you mean ? "
32235	32244	31928	31928	she	152	" He asked me for my permission also . "
32248	32255	32245	32245	She	1083	" How very odd of him ! "
32256	32260	32262	32265	the son and heir	1084	" Why so ? "
32267	32276	32245	32245	She	1083	" Why should n't my permission be asked ? "
32277	32295	31928	31928	she	152	" What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything ? What ever did you say ? "
32296	32317	32245	32245	She	1083	" I said to Cecil , ' Take her or leave her ; it 's no business of mine ! ' "
32318	32324	31928	31928	she	152	" What a helpful answer ! "
32344	32350	32352	32352	Freddy	121	" The bother is this , "
32379	32391	32371	32372	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Freddy , you must come . There they still are ! "
32392	32405	32423	32423	she	1083	" I do n't see you ought to go peeping like that . "
32406	32421	32371	32372	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Peeping like that ! Ca n't I look out of my own window ? "
32439	32444	32423	32423	she	1083	" Still page 322 ? "
32480	32498	32499	32499	He	121	" The bother is this : I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully . "
32505	32594	32499	32499	He	121	" Not content with ' permission ' , which I did give - that is to say , I said , ' I do n't mind ' - well , not content with that , he wanted to know whether I was n't off my head with joy . He practically put it like this : Was n't it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her ? And he would have an answer - he said it would strengthen his hand . "
32595	32606	32662	32663	his mother	1078	" I hope you gave a careful answer , dear . "
32607	32613	32615	32616	the boy	727	" I answered ' No ' "
32622	32655	32615	32616	the boy	727	" There ! Fly into a stew ! I ca n't help it - had to say it . I had to say no . He ought never to have asked me . "
32656	32660	32662	32663	his mother	1078	" Ridiculous child ! "
32665	32714	32662	32663	his mother	1078	" You think you 're so holy and truthful , but really it 's only abominable conceit . Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say ? I hope he boxed your ears . How dare you say no ? "
32715	32792	32615	32616	the boy	727	" Oh , do keep quiet , mother ! I had to say no when I could n't say yes . I tried to laugh as if I did n't mean what I said , and , as Cecil laughed too , and went away , it may be all right . But I feel my foot 's in it . Oh , do keep quiet , though , and let a man do some work . "
32793	32796	32798	32799	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" No , "
32812	32855	32798	32799	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I shall not keep quiet . You know all that has passed between them in Rome ; you know why he is down here , and yet you deliberately insult him , and try to turn him out of my house . "
32856	32861	32862	32862	he	1089	" Not a bit ! "
32865	32899	32862	32862	he	1089	" I only let out I did n't like him . I do n't hate him , but I do n't like him . What I mind is that he 'll tell Lucy . "
32907	32914	32916	32917	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Well , I like him , "
32919	32970	32971	32971	She	152	" I know his mother ; he 's good , he 's clever , he 's rich , he 's well connected - Oh , you need n't kick the piano ! He 's well connected - I 'll say it again if you like : he 's well connected . "
32989	32996	32986	32986	She	152	" And he has beautiful manners . "
32997	33032	32971	32971	She	152	" I liked him till just now . I suppose it 's having him spoiling Lucy 's first week at home ; and it 's also something that Mr. Beebe said , not knowing . "
33033	33037	33045	33045	her	1078	" Mr. Beebe ? "
33048	33059	33045	33045	her	1078	" I do n't see how Mr. Beebe comes in . "
33060	33152	33039	33040	his mother	1078	" You know Mr. Beebe 's funny way , when you never quite know what he means . He said : ' Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor . ' I was very cute , I asked him what he meant . He said ' Oh , he 's like me - better detached . ' I could n't make him say any more , but it set me thinking . Since Cecil has come after Lucy he has n't been so pleasant , at least - I ca n't explain . "
33153	33179	33045	33045	her	1078	" You never can , dear . But I can . You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties . "
33279	33284	33286	33287	his mother	1078	" Will this do ? "
33289	33429	33286	33287	his mother	1078	" ' Dear Mrs. Vyse , - Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it . ' Then I put in at the top , ' and I have told Lucy so . ' I must write the letter out again - ' and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . ' I said that because I did n't want Mrs. Vyse to think us old - fashioned . She goes in for lectures and improving her mind , and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds , and the maid 's dirty thumb - marks where you turn on the electric light . She keeps that flat abominably - "
33430	33448	33262	33262	He	121	" Suppose Lucy marries Cecil , would she live in a flat , or in the country ? "
33449	33534	33286	33287	his mother	1078	" Do n't interrupt so foolishly . Where was I ? Oh yes - ' Young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything , and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first . ' No , I 'll cross that last bit out - it looks patronizing . I 'll stop at ' because she tells me everything . ' Or shall I cross that out , too ? "
33535	33542	33544	33544	Freddy	121	" Cross it out , too , "
33552	33629	33286	33287	his mother	1078	" Then the whole thing runs : ' Dear Mrs. Vyse . - Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it , and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything . But I do not know - ' "
33630	33634	33636	33636	Freddy	121	" Look out ! "
33952	33957	33958	33958	she	152	" Oh , Cecil ! "
33961	33970	33958	33958	she	152	" oh , Cecil , do tell me ! "
33971	33976	33978	33978	he	198	" I promessi sposi , "
33986	33992	33993	33993	he	198	" She has accepted me , "
34017	34023	34025	34026	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I am so glad , "
34087	34095	34097	34098	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Welcome as one of the family ! "
34107	34127	34101	34101	her	152	" This is indeed a joyous day ! I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy . "
34128	34133	34135	34137	the young man	345	" I hope so , "
34146	34150	34152	34153	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" We mothers - "
34198	34204	34206	34206	Cecil	198	" I say , Lucy ! "
34267	34271	34264	34264	He	831	" Steady on ! "
34272	34279	34281	34282	her mother	442	" Not a kiss for me ? "
34289	34305	34306	34306	Cecil	198	" Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it ? "
34309	34320	34306	34306	Cecil	198	" And I 'd stop here and tell my mother . "
34321	34327	34329	34329	Freddy	121	" We go with Lucy ? "
34336	34344	34306	34306	Cecil	198	" Yes , you go with Lucy . "
34602	34611	34587	34591	no woman of Leonardo 's	1124	" She did develop most wonderfully day by day .
34883	34888	34873	34873	he	198	" Dear Mrs. Vyse , "
35109	35116	35117	35117	he	198	" He is only a boy , "
35120	35141	35117	35117	he	198	" I represent all that he despises . Why should he want me for a brother - in - law ? "
35186	35190	35192	35193	the maid	2588	" Mr. Beebe ! "
35234	35253	35228	35228	Cecil	198	" I 've come for tea , Mr. Vyse . Do you suppose that I shall get it ? "
35254	35285	35228	35228	Cecil	198	" I should say so . Food is the thing one does get here - Do n't sit in that chair ; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it . "
35286	35289	35228	35228	Cecil	198	" Pfui ! "
35290	35294	35296	35296	Cecil	198	" I know , "
35298	35312	35296	35296	Cecil	198	" I know . I ca n't think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it . "
35345	35360	35334	35334	they	1141	" I 've come for tea and for gossip . Is n't this news ? "
35361	35370	35372	35372	Cecil	198	" News ? I do n't understand you , "
35374	35377	35372	35372	Cecil	198	" News ? "
35393	35428	35334	35334	they	1141	" I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up ; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field . He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack ! "
35429	35434	35436	35436	Cecil	198	" Has he indeed ? "
35498	35541	35495	35496	a bounder	1146	" Unpardonable question ! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert , the semi - detached villas that have been run up opposite the church ! I 'll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you . "
35542	35551	35553	35555	the young man	345	" I 'm shockingly stupid over local affairs , "
35558	35631	35553	35555	the young man	345	" I ca n't even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board . Perhaps there is no difference , or perhaps those are n't the right names . I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery . It is very remiss of me . Italy and London are the only places where I do n't feel to exist on sufferance . "
35651	35667	35495	35496	a bounder	1146	" Let me see , Mr. Vyse - I forget - what is your profession ? "
35668	35674	35676	35676	Cecil	198	" I have no profession , "
35678	35752	35676	35676	Cecil	198	" It is another example of my decadence . My attitude quite an indefensible one - is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like . I know I ought to be getting money out of people , or devoting myself to things I do n't care a straw about , but somehow , I 've not been able to begin . "
35753	35759	35761	35762	Mr. Beebe	116	" You are very fortunate , "
35764	35776	35761	35762	Mr. Beebe	116	" It is a wonderful opportunity , the possession of leisure . "
35814	35836	35777	35777	His	116	" I am glad that you approve . I dare n't face the healthy person - for example , Freddy Honeychurch . "
35837	35850	35795	35795	He	116	" Oh , Freddy 's a good sort , is n't he ? "
35851	35864	35777	35777	His	116	" Admirable . The sort who has made England what she is . "
35930	35936	35938	35939	Mr. Beebe	116	" Where are the others ? "
35943	35953	35938	35939	Mr. Beebe	116	" I insist on extracting tea before evening service . "
35954	36031	35911	35911	he	198	" I suppose Anne never told them you were here . In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives . The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly , and kicks the chair - legs with her feet . The faults of Mary - I forget the faults of Mary , but they are very grave . Shall we look in the garden ? "
36032	36051	35938	35939	Mr. Beebe	116	" I know the faults of Mary . She leaves the dust - pans standing on the stairs . "
36052	36073	35911	35911	he	198	" The fault of Euphemia is that she will not , simply will not , chop the suet sufficiently small . "
36085	36091	36092	36092	Cecil	198	" The faults of Freddy - "
36095	36127	36092	36092	Cecil	198	" Ah , he has too many . No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy . Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch ; they are not innumerable . "
36128	36133	36135	36137	the young man	345	" She has none , "
36143	36154	35938	35939	Mr. Beebe	116	" I quite agree . At present she has none . "
36155	36159	36092	36092	Cecil	198	" At present ? "
36160	36246	35938	35939	Mr. Beebe	116	" I 'm not cynical . I 'm only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch . Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully , and live so quietly ? I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both . The water - tight compartments in her will break down , and music and life will mingle . Then we shall have her heroically good , heroically bad - too heroic , perhaps , to be good or bad . "
36253	36268	36092	36092	Cecil	198	" And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes ? "
36269	36353	35938	35939	Mr. Beebe	116	" Well , I must say I 've only seen her at Tunbridge Wells , where she was not wonderful , and at Florence . Since I came to Summer Street she has been away . You saw her , did n't you , at Rome and in the Alps . Oh , I forgot ; of course , you knew her before . No , she was n't wonderful in Florence either , but I kept on expecting that she would be . "
36354	36359	36092	36092	Cecil	198	" In what way ? "
36377	36440	36368	36368	they	1156	" I could as easily tell you what tune she 'll play next . There was simply the sense that she had found wings , and meant to use them . I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary : Miss Honeychurch as a kite , Miss Bartlett holding the string . Picture number two : the string breaks . "
36474	36481	36464	36464	he	1158	" But the string never broke ? "
36482	36504	36445	36445	his	1158	" No . I might n't have seen Miss Honeychurch rise , but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall . "
36505	36511	36513	36515	the young man	345	" It has broken now , "
36569	36577	36552	36552	he	1158	" Broken ? What do you mean ? "
36578	36582	36584	36584	Cecil	198	" I meant , "
36587	36596	36584	36584	Cecil	198	" that she is going to marry me . "
36615	36657	36662	36662	he	332	" I am sorry ; I must apologize . I had no idea you were intimate with her , or I should never have talked in this flippant , superficial way . Mr. Vyse , you ought to have stopped me . "
36747	36758	36759	36759	he	198	" I am sorry I have given you a shock , "
36763	36777	36759	36759	he	198	" I fear that Lucy 's choice does not meet with your approval . "
36778	36820	36759	36759	he	198	" Not that . But you ought to have stopped me . I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes . Perhaps I ought n't to have discussed her so freely with any one ; certainly not with you . "
36821	36831	36759	36759	he	198	" You are conscious of having said something indiscreet ? "
36865	36951	36957	36957	him	116	" No , I have said nothing indiscreet . I foresaw at Florence that her quiet , uneventful childhood must end , and it has ended . I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step . She has taken it . She has learnt - you will let me talk freely , as I have begun freely - she has learnt what it is to love : the greatest lesson , some people will tell you , that our earthly life provides . "
36975	36982	36985	36985	his	116	" She has learnt through you , "
36997	37011	36985	36985	his	116	" let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her . "
37012	37016	37018	37018	Cecil	198	" Grazie tante ! "
37026	37031	37036	37036	she	152	" Have you heard ? "
37043	37055	37036	37036	she	152	" Oh , Mr. Beebe , have you heard the news ? "
37075	37080	37081	37081	he	121	" Indeed I have ! "
37108	37181	37092	37092	he	121	" Mrs. Honeychurch , I 'm going to do what I am always supposed to do , but generally I 'm too shy . I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them , grave and gay , great and small . I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife , as father and mother . And now I want my tea . "
37182	37192	37193	37194	the lady	1169	" You only asked for it just in time , "
37197	37207	37193	37194	the lady	1169	" How dare you be serious at Windy Corner ? "
37502	37504	37491	37491	Freddy	121	" Fiasco "
37762	37774	37775	37775	he	198	" Do you go to much of this sort of thing ? "
37783	37790	37792	37792	Lucy	112	" Oh , now and then , "
37800	37808	37775	37775	he	198	" Is it typical of country society ? "
37809	37820	37846	37846	her	152	" I suppose so . Mother , would it be ? "
37821	37826	37828	37829	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Plenty of society , "
37858	37870	37851	37851	Cecil	198	" To me it seemed perfectly appalling , disastrous , portentous . "
37871	37881	37846	37846	her	152	" I am so sorry that you were stranded . "
37882	37925	37851	37851	Cecil	198	" Not that , but the congratulations . It is so disgusting , the way an engagement is regarded as public property - a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment . All those old women smirking ! "
37926	37947	37846	37846	her	152	" One has to go through it , I suppose . They wo n't notice us so much next time . "
37948	37982	37851	37851	Cecil	198	" But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong . An engagement - horrid word in the first place - is a private matter , and should be treated as such . "
38052	38056	38057	38057	she	112	" How tiresome ! "
38060	38069	38057	38057	she	112	" Could n't you have escaped to tennis ? "
38070	38108	38126	38126	She	112	" I do n't play tennis - at least , not in public . The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic . Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato . "
38109	38113	38057	38057	she	112	" Inglese Italianato ? "
38114	38125	38126	38126	She	112	" E un diavolo incarnato ! You know the proverb ? "
38172	38175	38177	38177	he	198	" Well , "
38179	38208	38177	38177	he	198	" I can not help it if they do disapprove of me . There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them , and I must accept them . "
38209	38219	38221	38222	wise Lucy	112	" We all have our limitations , I suppose , "
38224	38234	38236	38236	Cecil	198	" Sometimes they are forced on us , though , "
38252	38255	38177	38177	he	198	" How ? "
38256	38284	38244	38244	she	112	" It makes a difference does n't it , whether we fully fence ourselves in , or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others ? "
38299	38302	38304	38305	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Difference ? "
38310	38331	38304	38305	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I do n't see any difference . Fences are fences , especially when they are in the same place . "
38332	38339	38341	38341	Cecil	198	" We were speaking of motives , "
38349	38357	38358	38358	She	112	" My dear Cecil , look here . "
38373	38405	38358	38358	She	112	" This is me . That 's Windy Corner . The rest of the pattern is the other people . Motives are all very well , but the fence comes here . "
38406	38415	38417	38417	Lucy	112	" We were n't talking of real fences , "
38421	38431	38358	38358	She	112	" Oh , I see , dear - poetry . "
38445	38461	38462	38462	she	112	" I tell you who has no ' fences , ' as you call them , "
38465	38472	38462	38462	she	112	" and that 's Mr. Beebe . "
38473	38483	38440	38440	Lucy	112	" A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless . "
38516	38524	38525	38525	she	112	" Do n't you like Mr. Beebe ? "
38529	38535	38536	38536	he	198	" I never said so ! "
38539	38552	38536	38536	he	198	" I consider him far above the average . I only denied - "
38568	38578	38580	38580	she	112	" Now , a clergyman that I do hate , "
38587	38639	38580	38580	she	112	" a clergyman that does have fences , and the most dreadful ones , is Mr. Eager , the English chaplain at Florence . He was truly insincere - not merely the manner unfortunate . He was a snob , and so conceited , and he did say such unkind things . "
38640	38646	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" What sort of things ? "
38647	38664	38580	38580	she	112	" There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife . "
38665	38670	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Perhaps he had . "
38671	38674	38580	38580	she	112	" No ! "
38675	38681	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Why ' no ' ? "
38682	38695	38580	38580	she	112	" He was such a nice old man , I 'm sure . "
38703	38749	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Well , I did try to sift the thing . Mr. Eager would never come to the point . He prefers it vague - said the old man had ' practically ' murdered his wife - had murdered her in the sight of God . "
38750	38755	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Hush , dear ! "
38761	38812	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" But is n't it intolerable that a person whom we 're told to imitate should go round spreading slander ? It was , I believe , chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped . People pretended he was vulgar , but he certainly was n't that . "
38813	38823	38757	38758	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Poor old man ! What was his name ? "
38824	38827	38829	38829	Lucy	112	" Harris , "
38832	38845	38847	38848	her mother	442	" Let 's hope that Mrs. Harris there warn't no sich person , "
38854	38866	38867	38867	he	198	" Is n't Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type ? "
38870	38903	38914	38915	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I do n't know . I hate him . I 've heard him lecture on Giotto . I hate him . Nothing can hide a petty nature . I HATE him . "
38904	38912	38914	38915	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" My goodness gracious me , child ! "
38917	38943	38914	38915	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" You 'll blow my head off ! Whatever is there to shout over ? I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen . "
39136	39144	39145	39145	he	1203	" I count myself a lucky person , "
39148	39277	39145	39145	he	1203	" When I 'm in London I feel I could never live out of it . When I 'm in the country I feel the same about the country . After all , I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life , and that the people who live amongst them must be the best . It 's true that in nine cases out of ten they do n't seem to notice anything . The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions . Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town . Do you feel that , Mrs. Honeychurch ? "
39362	39376	39377	39377	he	198	" ' Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , ' "
39394	39398	39388	39388	She	112	" What height ? "
39399	39450	39388	39388	She	112	" ' Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , What pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang . In height and in the splendour of the hills ? ' Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch 's advice and hate clergymen no more . What 's this place ? "
39451	39458	39460	39460	Lucy	112	" Summer Street , of course , "
39596	39598	39594	39594	Cecil	198	" Cissie "
39608	39610	39594	39594	Cecil	198	" Albert "
39653	39655	39659	39659	His	133	" Albert "
39682	39684	39736	39737	the ladies	300	" Cissie "
39728	39734	39736	39737	the ladies	300	" The place is ruined ! "
39740	39750	39736	39737	the ladies	300	" Summer Street will never be the same again . "
39756	39759	39769	39769	her	112	" Cissie 's "
39771	39774	39776	39777	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Stop ! "
39786	39807	39776	39777	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Here 's Sir Harry . Now we shall know . Sir Harry , pull those things down at once ! "
39824	39845	39808	39810	Sir Harry Otway	133	" Mrs. Honeychurch , I meant to . I ca n't , I really ca n't turn out Miss Flack . "
39846	39880	39891	39891	his	133	" Am I not always right ? She ought to have gone before the contract was signed . Does she still live rent free , as she did in her nephew 's time ? "
39881	39888	39889	39889	He	133	" But what can I do ? "
39894	39907	39891	39891	his	133	" An old lady , so very vulgar , and almost bedridden . "
39908	39913	39915	39915	Cecil	198	" Turn her out , "
40113	40145	40100	40101	Mr. Flack	209	" and all the capitals different - one with dragons in the foliage , another approaching to the Ionian style , another introducing Mrs. Flack 's initials - every one different . "
40251	40253	40321	40322	Sir Harry	133	" Cissie "
40260	40267	40268	40268	he	133	" The rent is absurdly low , "
40272	40308	40268	40268	he	133	" and perhaps I am an easy landlord . But it is such an awkward size . It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves . "
40335	40345	40346	40346	he	133	" You ought to find a tenant at once , "
40350	40362	40346	40346	he	133	" It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk . "
40363	40366	40368	40369	Sir Harry	133	" Exactly ! "
40372	40420	40368	40369	Sir Harry	133	" That is exactly what I fear , Mr. Vyse . It will attract the wrong type of people . The train service has improved - a fatal improvement , to my mind . And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles ? "
40421	40430	40432	40432	Lucy	112	" Rather a strenuous clerk it would be , "
40480	40484	40485	40485	she	112	" Sir Harry ! "
40488	40500	40485	40485	she	112	" I have an idea . How would you like spinsters ? "
40501	40517	40462	40462	She	112	" My dear Lucy , it would be splendid . Do you know any such ? "
40518	40526	40485	40485	she	112	" Yes ; I met them abroad . "
40527	40530	40531	40531	he	133	" Gentlewomen ? "
40535	40590	40485	40485	she	112	" Yes , indeed , and at the present moment homeless . I heard from them last week - Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan . I 'm really not joking . They are quite the right people . Mr. Beebe knows them , too . May I tell them to write to you ? "
40591	40596	40597	40597	he	133	" Indeed you may ! "
40600	40742	40597	40597	he	133	" Here we are with the difficulty solved already . How delightful it is ! Extra facilities - please tell them they shall have extra facilities , for I shall have no agents ' fees . Oh , the agents ! The appalling people they have sent me ! One woman , when I wrote - a tactful letter , you know - asking her to explain her social position to me , replied that she would pay the rent in advance . As if one cares about that ! And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory - people swindlers , or not respectable . And oh , the deceit ! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week . The deceit of the most promising people . My dear Lucy , the deceit ! "
40746	40750	40753	40754	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" My advice , "
40756	40830	40753	40754	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all . I know the type . Preserve me from people who have seen better days , and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy . It 's a sad thing , but I 'd far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to some one who has come down . "
40831	40838	40840	40841	Sir Harry	133	" I think I follow you , "
40843	40857	40840	40841	Sir Harry	133	" but it is , as you say , a very sad thing . "
40858	40866	40868	40868	Lucy	112	" The Misses Alan are n't that ! "
40870	40876	40878	40878	Cecil	198	" Yes , they are , "
40880	40900	40878	40878	Cecil	198	" I have n't met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood . "
40901	40915	40753	40754	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Do n't listen to him , Sir Harry - he 's tiresome . "
40916	40924	40925	40925	he	133	" It 's I who am tiresome , "
40928	40972	40925	40925	he	133	" I ought n't to come with my troubles to young people . But really I am so worried , and Lady Otway will only say that I can not be too careful , which is quite true , but no real help . "
40973	40983	40753	40754	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Then may I write to my Misses Alan ? "
40984	40987	40925	40925	he	133	" Please ! "
40997	41042	40993	40994	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Beware ! They are certain to have canaries . Sir Harry , beware of canaries : they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come . Beware of women altogether . Only let to a man . "
41043	41046	41047	41047	he	133	" Really - "
41060	41122	41057	41057	her	152	" Men do n't gossip over tea - cups . If they get drunk , there 's an end of them - they lie down comfortably and sleep it off . If they 're vulgar , they somehow keep it to themselves . It does n't spread so . Give me a man - of course , provided he 's clean . "
41170	41172	41152	41152	He	133	" Cissie "
41220	41224	41225	41225	he	198	" Mrs. Honeychurch , "
41228	41239	41225	41225	he	198	" what if we two walk home and leave you ? "
41240	41243	41245	41245	her	152	" Certainly ! "
41270	41279	41262	41262	He	133	" Aha ! young people , young people ! "
41288	41292	41294	41294	Cecil	198	" Hopeless vulgarian ! "
41304	41309	41262	41262	He	133	" Oh , Cecil ! "
41310	41327	41262	41262	He	133	" I ca n't help it . It would be wrong not to loathe that man . "
41328	41340	41262	41262	He	133	" He is n't clever , but really he is nice . "
41341	41415	41262	41262	He	133	" No , Lucy , he stands for all that is bad in country life . In London he would keep his place . He would belong to a brainless club , and his wife would give brainless dinner parties . But down here he acts the little god with his gentility , and his patronage , and his sham aesthetics , and every one - even your mother - is taken in . "
41416	41425	41427	41427	Lucy	112	" All that you say is quite true , "
41434	41446	41427	41427	Lucy	112	" I wonder whether - whether it matters so very much . "
41447	41515	41517	41517	Lucy	112	" It matters supremely . Sir Harry is the essence of that garden - party . Oh , goodness , how cross I feel ! How I do hope he 'll get some vulgar tenant in that villa - some woman so really vulgar that he 'll notice it . GENTLEFOLKS ! Ugh ! with his bald head and retreating chin ! But let 's forget him . "
41575	41584	41568	41568	Cecil	198	" It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy "
41646	41653	41654	41654	she	112	" Which way shall we go ? "
41691	41697	41680	41680	she	112	" Are there two ways ? "
41698	41713	41680	41680	she	112	" Perhaps the road is more sensible , as we 're got up smart . "
41714	41723	41725	41725	Cecil	198	" I 'd rather go through the wood , "
41741	41777	41725	41725	Cecil	198	" Why is it , Lucy , that you always say the road ? Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged ? "
41778	41788	41790	41790	Lucy	112	" Have n't I ? The wood , then , "
41844	41868	41821	41821	She	112	" I had got an idea - I dare say wrongly - that you feel more at home with me in a room . "
41869	41873	41874	41874	she	112	" A room ? "
41880	41906	41821	41821	She	112	" Yes . Or , at the most , in a garden , or on a road . Never in the real country like this . "
41907	41940	41821	41821	She	112	" Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? I have never felt anything of the sort . You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person . "
41941	41974	41821	41821	She	112	" I do n't know that you are n't . I connect you with a view - a certain type of view . Why should n't you connect me with a room ? "
41986	42022	41975	41975	She	112	" Do you know that you 're right ? I do . I must be a poetess after all . When I think of you it 's always as in a room . How funny ! "
42031	42043	41975	41975	She	112	" A drawing - room , pray ? With no view ? "
42044	42057	41975	41975	She	112	" Yes , with no view , I fancy . Why not ? "
42058	42063	42064	42064	he	1265	" I 'd rather , "
42068	42077	42064	42064	he	1265	" that connected me with the open air . "
42082	42092	42078	42078	She	112	" Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? "
42219	42224	42216	42216	She	112	" The Sacred Lake ! "
42225	42233	42216	42216	She	112	" Why do you call it that ? "
42234	42310	42216	42216	She	112	" I ca n't remember why . I suppose it comes out of some book . It 's only a puddle now , but you see that stream going through it ? Well , a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains , and ca n't get away at once , and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful . Then Freddy used to bathe there . He is very fond of it . "
42311	42315	42316	42316	He	121	" And you ? "
42319	42326	42316	42316	He	121	" Are you fond of it ? "
42332	42351	42328	42328	she	112	" I bathed here , too , till I was found out . Then there was a row . "
42440	42446	42415	42415	she	112	" Who found you out ? "
42447	42450	42451	42451	she	112	" Charlotte , "
42454	42465	42451	42451	she	112	" She was stopping with us . Charlotte - Charlotte . "
42466	42470	42415	42415	she	112	" Poor girl ! "
42490	42493	42451	42451	she	112	" Lucy ! "
42494	42505	42507	42507	her	112	" Yes , I suppose we ought to be going , "
42510	42527	42451	42451	she	112	" Lucy , I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before . "
42543	42548	42535	42535	she	112	" What , Cecil ? "
42549	42567	42568	42568	He	121	" Hitherto never - not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me - "
42589	42592	42535	42535	she	112	" Yes ? "
42593	42603	42535	42535	she	112	" Up to now I have never kissed you . "
42618	42625	42626	42626	she	112	" No - more you have , "
42629	42639	42535	42535	she	112	" Then I ask you - may I now ? "
42640	42663	42676	42676	Her	112	" Of course , you may , Cecil . You might before . I ca n't run at you , you know . "
42893	42902	42885	42885	she	112	" Emerson was the name , not Harris . "
42903	42907	42885	42885	she	112	" What name ? "
42908	42914	42885	42885	she	112	" The old man 's . "
42915	42920	42885	42885	she	112	" What old man ? "
42921	42939	42885	42885	she	112	" That old man I told you about . The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to . "
43138	43148	43149	43149	she	2415	" I can not think what people are doing , "
43153	43163	43149	43149	she	2415	" but it is extremely fortunate for the children . "
43499	43506	43507	43507	he	198	" Does that very much matter ? "
43735	43764	43722	43722	she	112	" Oh , it has been such a nuisance - first he , then they - no one knowing what they wanted , and every one so tiresome . "
43765	43773	43775	43776	Mr. Beebe	116	" But they really are coming now , "
43778	43821	43775	43776	Mr. Beebe	116	" I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago - she was wondering how often the butcher called , and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably . They are coming . I heard from them this morning .
43822	43830	43831	43832	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I shall hate those Miss Alans ! "
43835	43878	43831	43832	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Just because they 're old and silly one 's expected to say ' How sweet ! ' I hate their ' if'-ing and ' but'-ing and ' and'-ing . And poor Lucy - serve her right - worn to a shadow . "
43909	43924	43925	43925	Saturn	224	" Well , if they are coming - No , Minnie , not Saturn . "
43948	44007	43940	43940	his	224	" If they are coming , Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty - ninth , and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings , because it made them nervous , and put in the fair wear and tear one . - That does n't count . I told you not Saturn . "
44008	44018	44020	44020	Freddy	121	" Saturn 's all right for bumble - puppy , "
44025	44035	44020	44020	Freddy	121	" Minnie , do n't you listen to her . "
44036	44042	43940	43940	his	224	" Saturn does n't bounce . "
44043	44048	44020	44020	Freddy	121	" Saturn bounces enough . "
44049	44056	43940	43940	his	224	" No , he does n't . "
44057	44069	44020	44020	Freddy	121	" Well ; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil . "
44070	44075	44077	44078	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Hush , dear , "
44080	44135	44077	44078	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" But look at Lucy - complaining of Saturn , and all the time 's got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand , ready to plug it in . That 's right , Minnie , go for her - get her over the shins with the racquet - get her over the shins ! "
44157	44169	44148	44149	Mr. Beebe	116	" The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona , please . "
44282	44292	44294	44295	Mr. Beebe	116	" I wish the Miss Alans could see this , "
44319	44326	44327	44327	Freddy	121	" Who are the Miss Alans ? "
44330	44337	44327	44327	Freddy	121	" They have taken Cissie Villa . "
44338	44345	44327	44327	Freddy	121	" That was n't the name - "
44366	44372	44374	44374	Lucy	112	" Was n't what name ? "
44385	44400	44327	44327	Freddy	121	" Alan was n't the name of the people Sir Harry 's let to . "
44401	44412	44439	44441	an indifferent mimic	1337	" Nonsense , Freddy ! You know nothing about it . "
44413	44435	44437	44437	Freddy	121	" Nonsense yourself ! I 've this minute seen him . He said to me : ' Ahem ! Honeychurch , ' "
44443	44480	44437	44437	Freddy	121	" ' ahem ! ahem ! I have at last procured really dee - sire - rebel tenants . ' I said , ' ooray , old boy ! ' and slapped him on the back . "
44481	44488	44439	44441	an indifferent mimic	1337	" Exactly . The Miss Alans ? "
44489	44497	44437	44437	Freddy	121	" Rather not . More like Anderson . "
44498	44513	44514	44515	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Oh , good gracious , there is n't going to be another muddle ! "
44518	44555	44514	44515	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Do you notice , Lucy , I 'm always right ? I said do n't interfere with Cissie Villa . I 'm always right . I 'm quite uneasy at being always right so often . "
44556	44583	44437	44437	Freddy	121	" It 's only another muddle of Freddy 's . Freddy does n't even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead . "
44584	44597	44514	44515	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Yes , I do . I 've got it . Emerson . "
44598	44602	44437	44437	Freddy	121	" What name ? "
44603	44614	44514	44515	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Emerson . I 'll bet you anything you like . "
44615	44623	44625	44625	Lucy	112	" What a weathercock Sir Harry is , "
44628	44640	44625	44625	Lucy	112	" I wish I had never bothered over it at all . "
44702	44715	44698	44698	her	152	" Emerson , Freddy ? Do you know what Emersons they are ? "
44716	44727	44729	44729	Freddy	121	" I do n't know whether they 're any Emersons , "
44770	44785	44787	44787	she	1342	" I trust they are the right sort of person . All right , Lucy "
44793	44830	44787	44787	she	1342	" I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother 's a snob . But there is a right sort and a wrong sort , and it 's affectation to pretend there is n't . "
44831	44839	44840	44840	Lucy	112	" Emerson 's a common enough name , "
44885	44919	44787	44787	she	1342	" I was merely going to remark , Freddy , that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher , a most trying man . Pray , does that satisfy you ? "
44920	44925	44926	44926	he	1346	" Oh , yes , "
44929	44946	44926	44926	he	1346	" And you will be satisfied , too , for they 're friends of Cecil ; so "
44951	44967	44926	44926	he	1346	" you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety . "
44968	44971	44973	44973	Lucy	112	" CECIL ? "
44975	44983	44985	44986	his mother	1078	" Do n't be rude , dear , "
44989	45007	44985	44986	his mother	1078	" Lucy , do n't screech . It 's a new bad habit you 're getting into . "
45008	45013	44926	44926	he	1346	" But has Cecil - "
45014	45020	45021	45021	he	1346	" Friends of Cecil 's , "
45024	45047	45021	45021	he	1346	" ' and so really dee - sire - rebel . Ahem ! Honeychurch , I have just telegraphed to them . ' "
45099	45148	45094	45094	She	112	" when she heard that it came partly from her lover . Mr. Vyse was a tease - something worse than a tease : he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people . The clergyman , knowing this , looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness .
45153	45172	45150	45150	she	112	" But Cecil 's Emersons - they ca n't possibly be the same ones - there is that - "
45205	45269	45270	45270	He	133	" The Emersons who were at Florence , do you mean ? No , I do n't suppose it will prove to be them . It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse 's . Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , the oddest people ! The queerest people ! For our part we liked them , did n't we ? "
45275	45388	45270	45270	He	133	" There was a great scene over some violets . They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa . Poor little ladies ! So shocked and so pleased . It used to be one of Miss Catharine 's great stories . ' My dear sister loves flowers , ' it began . They found the whole room a mass of blue - vases and jugs - and the story ends with ' So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful . ' It is all very difficult . Yes , I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets . "
45389	45397	45399	45399	Freddy	121	" Fiasco 's done you this time , "
45430	45491	45418	45419	Mr. Beebe	116	" These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son - the son a goodly , if not a good young man ; not a fool , I fancy , but very immature - pessimism , et cetera . Our special joy was the father - such a sentimental darling , and people declared he had murdered his wife . "
45527	45532	45534	45535	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Murdered his wife ? "
45537	45599	45534	45535	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Lucy , do n't desert us - go on playing bumble - puppy . Really , the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place . That 's the second murderer I 've heard of as being there . Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop ? By - the - by , we really must ask Charlotte here some time . "
45688	45695	45696	45696	he	831	" Oh , do n't go ! "
45708	45713	45714	45714	she	112	" I must go , "
45718	45732	45714	45714	she	112	" Do n't be silly . You always overdo it when you play . "
45742	45745	45737	45738	her mother	442	" Harris ! "
45859	45862	45850	45850	Cecil	198	" Cecil ! "
45863	45866	45867	45867	he	198	" Hullo ! "
45886	45979	45880	45880	He	198	" I was hoping you 'd come . I heard you all bear - gardening , but there 's better fun up here . I , even I , have won a great victory for the Comic Muse . George Meredith 's right - the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same ; and I , even I , have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa . Do n't be angry ! Do n't be angry ! You 'll forgive me when you hear it all . "
45999	46004	46005	46005	she	1362	" I have heard , "
46008	46063	46005	46005	she	1362	" Freddy has told us . Naughty Cecil ! I suppose I must forgive you . Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing ! Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome , and I 'd rather have nice friends of yours . But you ought n't to tease one so . "
46064	46069	46070	46070	he	198	" Friends of mine ? "
46073	46088	46070	46070	he	198	" But , Lucy , the whole joke is to come ! Come here . "
46097	46124	46090	46090	she	1362	" Do you know where I met these desirable tenants ? In the National Gallery , when I was up to see my mother last week . "
46125	46134	46135	46135	she	1362	" What an odd place to meet people ! "
46139	46146	46135	46135	she	1362	" I do n't quite understand . "
46147	46189	46005	46005	she	1362	" In the Umbrian Room . Absolute strangers . They were admiring Luca Signorelli - of course , quite stupidly . However , we got talking , and they refreshed me not - a little . They had been to Italy . "
46190	46195	46135	46135	she	1362	" But , Cecil - "
46199	46274	46005	46005	she	1362	" In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage - the father to live there , the son to run down for week - ends . I thought , ' What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry ! ' and I took their address and a London reference , found they were n't actual blackguards - it was great sport - and wrote to him , making out - "
46275	46292	46005	46005	she	1362	" Cecil ! No , it 's not fair . I 've probably met them before - "
46298	46379	46005	46005	she	1362	" Perfectly fair . Anything is fair that punishes a snob . That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good . Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ' decayed gentlewomen . ' I meant to read him a lesson some time . No , Lucy , the classes ought to mix , and before long you 'll agree with me . There ought to be intermarriage - all sorts of things . I believe in democracy - "
46380	46387	46388	46388	she	1364	" No , you do n't , "
46391	46401	46388	46388	she	1364	" You do n't know what the word means . "
46418	46425	46411	46411	she	1364	" No , you do n't ! "
46437	46503	46426	46426	Her	1364	" It is n't fair , Cecil . I blame you - I blame you very much indeed . You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans , and make me look ridiculous . You call it scoring off Sir Harry , but do you realize that it is all at my expense ? I consider it most disloyal of you . "
46508	46511	46512	46512	he	1366	" Temper ! "
46902	46908	46909	46909	she	112	" Cecil - Cecil darling , "
46964	46974	46975	46975	he	198	" So you do love me , little thing ? "
46978	47000	46975	46975	he	198	" Oh , Cecil , I do , I do ! I do n't know what I should do without you . "
47043	47049	47040	47040	Charlotte	111	" the flight to Rome , "
47187	47190	47170	47170	she	112	" Tunbridge Wells ,
47191	47193	47170	47170	she	112	" September .
47194	47197	47170	47170	she	112	" Dearest Lucia ,
47198	47394	47170	47170	she	112	" I have news of you at last ! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts , but was not sure whether a call would be welcome . Puncturing her tire near Summer Street , and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard , she saw to her astonishment , a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out . He said his father had just taken the house . He SAID he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood ? . He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea . Dear Lucy , I am much worried , and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother , Freddy , and Mr. Vyse , who will forbid him to enter the house , etc . That was a great misfortune , and I dare say you have told them already . Mr. Vyse is so sensitive . I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome . I am very sorry about it all , and should not feel easy unless I warned you .
47395	47398	47170	47170	she	112	" Believe me ,
47399	47405	47170	47170	she	112	" Your anxious and loving cousin ,
47406	47409	47170	47170	she	112	" Charlotte . "
47420	47424	47410	47410	Lucy	112	" Beauchamp Mansions , S.W.
47425	47428	47170	47170	she	112	" Dear Charlotte ,
47429	47640	47410	47410	Lucy	112	" Many thanks for your warning . When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain , you made me promise not to tell mother , because you said she would blame you for not being always with me . I have kept that promise , and can not possibly tell her now . I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence , and that they are respectable people - which I do think - and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself . She should have tried at the Rectory . I can not begin making a fuss at this stage . You must see that it would be too absurd . If the Emersons heard I had complained of them , they would think themselves of importance , which is exactly what they are not . I like the old father , and look forward to seeing him again . As for the son , I am sorry for him when we meet , rather than for myself . They are known to Cecil , who is very well and spoke of you the other day . We expect to be married in January .
47641	47683	47694	47694	Secrecy	238	" Miss Lavish can not have told you much about me , for I am not at Windy Corner at all , but here . Please do not put ' Private ' outside your envelope again . No one opens my letters .
47684	47687	47410	47410	Lucy	112	" Yours affectionately ,
47688	47693	47694	47694	Secrecy	238	" L. M. Honeychurch . "
47793	47798	47809	47809	She	112	" Emerson , not Harris "
48024	48028	48020	48020	She	112	" Now some Beethoven "
48125	48129	48113	48113	she	112	" Too much Schumann "
48270	48277	48278	48278	she	228	" Make Lucy one of us , "
48301	48309	48278	48278	she	228	" Lucy is becoming wonderful - wonderful . "
48310	48317	48278	48278	she	228	" Her music always was wonderful . "
48318	48357	48278	48278	she	228	" Yes , but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint , most excellent Honeychurches , but you know what I mean . She is not always quoting servants , or asking one how the pudding is made . "
48358	48364	48278	48278	she	228	" Italy has done it . "
48365	48368	48369	48369	she	228	" Perhaps , "
48382	48404	48369	48369	she	228	" It is just possible . Cecil , mind you marry her next January . She is one of us already . "
48405	48410	48411	48411	he	1415	" But her music ! "
48414	48502	48411	48411	he	1415	" The style of her ! How she kept to Schumann when , like an idiot , I wanted Beethoven . Schumann was right for this evening . Schumann was the thing . Do you know , mother , I shall have our children educated just like Lucy . Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness , send them to Italy for subtlety , and then - not till then - let them come to London . I do n't believe in these London educations - "
48518	48527	48503	48503	He	1416	" At all events , not for women . "
48528	48535	48537	48538	Mrs. Vyse	228	" Make her one of us , "
48597	48611	48584	48584	She	228	" I am so sorry , Mrs. Vyse - it is these dreams . "
48612	48616	48584	48584	She	228	" Bad dreams ? "
48617	48621	48584	48584	She	228	" Just dreams . "
48634	48657	48622	48624	The elder lady	1420	" You should have heard us talking about you , dear . He admires you more than ever . Dream of that . "
48796	48810	48786	48786	Freddy	121	" Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little . "
48811	48814	48786	48786	Freddy	121	" M'm . "
48815	48821	48786	48786	Freddy	121	" They might amuse you . "
48856	48864	48866	48867	Mr. Beebe	116	" I suggested we should hinder them , "
48869	48875	48866	48867	Mr. Beebe	116	" They are worth it . "
48890	48893	48894	48894	he	121	" Hullo ! "
48916	48919	48911	48913	A grave voice	1427	" Hullo ! "
48920	48930	48911	48913	A grave voice	1427	" I 've brought some one to see you . "
48931	48940	48911	48913	A grave voice	1427	" I 'll be down in a minute . "
48979	48986	48987	48987	Freddy	121	" Are these people great readers ? "
48990	48996	48987	48987	Freddy	121	" Are they that sort ? "
48997	49075	48911	48913	A grave voice	1427	" I fancy they know how to read - a rare accomplishment . What have they got ? Byron . Exactly . A Shropshire Lad . Never heard of it . The Way of All Flesh . Never heard of it . Gibbon . Hullo ! dear George reads German . Um - um - Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , and so we go on . Well , I suppose your generation knows its own business , Honeychurch . "
49076	49084	49086	49086	Freddy	121	" Mr. Beebe , look at that , "
49108	49117	49101	49102	an amateur	1433	" Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes . "
49118	49142	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" I know . Is n't it jolly ? I like that . I 'm certain that 's the old man 's doing . "
49143	49150	49101	49102	an amateur	1433	" How very odd of him ! "
49151	49156	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" Surely you agree ? "
49177	49180	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" Pictures ! "
49190	49204	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" Giotto - they got that at Florence , I 'll be bound . "
49205	49213	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" The same as Lucy 's got . "
49214	49229	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" Oh , by - the - by , did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London ? "
49230	49236	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" She came back yesterday . "
49237	49246	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" I suppose she had a good time ? "
49247	49252	49254	49254	Freddy	121	" Yes , very , "
49261	49270	49254	49254	Freddy	121	" She and Cecil are thicker than ever . "
49271	49277	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" That 's good hearing . "
49278	49291	49254	49254	Freddy	121	" I wish I was n't such a fool , Mr. Beebe . "
49298	49329	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am , but it 'll be very different now , mother thinks . She will read all kinds of books . "
49330	49335	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" So will you . "
49336	49381	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" Only medical books . Not books that you can talk about afterwards . Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian , and he says her playing is wonderful . There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed . Cecil says - "
49382	49402	49181	49182	the clergyman	332	" What on earth are those people doing upstairs ? Emerson - we think we 'll come another time . "
49417	49427	49439	49439	he	121	" Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , a neighbour . "
49467	49478	49462	49462	he	121	" How d'ye do ? Come and have a bathe . "
49479	49485	49487	49487	George	115	" Oh , all right , "
49497	49514	49515	49515	he	116	" ' How d'ye do ? how d'ye do ? Come and have a bathe , ' "
49518	49585	49515	49515	he	116	" That 's the best conversational opening I 've ever heard . But I 'm afraid it will only act between men . Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ' How do you do ? Come and have a bathe ' ? And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal . "
49586	49595	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" I tell you that they shall be , "
49608	49629	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" Good afternoon , Mr. Beebe . I tell you they shall be comrades , and George thinks the same . "
49630	49640	49641	49642	the clergyman	332	" We are to raise ladies to our level ? "
49645	49651	49653	49654	Mr. Emerson	149	" The Garden of Eden , "
49659	49685	49653	49654	Mr. Emerson	149	" which you place in the past , is really yet to come . We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies . "
49696	49731	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" In this - not in other things - we men are ahead . We despise the body less than women do . But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden . "
49732	49741	49743	49743	Freddy	121	" I say , what about this bathe ? "
49756	49806	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" I believed in a return to Nature once . But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her ? To - day , I believe that we must discover Nature . After many conquests we shall attain simplicity . It is our heritage . "
49807	49822	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , whose sister you will remember at Florence . "
49823	49958	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" How do you do ? Very glad to see you , and that you are taking George for a bathe . Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry . Marriage is a duty . I am sure that she will be happy , for we know Mr. Vyse , too . He has been most kind . He met us by chance in the National Gallery , and arranged everything about this delightful house . Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway . I have met so few Liberal landowners , and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude . Ah , this wind ! You do well to bathe . Yours is a glorious country , Honeychurch ! "
49959	49964	49966	49966	Freddy	121	" Not a bit ! "
49968	49998	49966	49966	Freddy	121	" I must - that is to say , I have to - have the pleasure of calling on you later on , my mother says , I hope . "
49999	50033	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" CALL , my lad ? Who taught us that drawing - room twaddle ? Call on your grandmother ! Listen to the wind among the pines ! Yours is a glorious country . "
50041	50108	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" Mr. Emerson , he will call , I shall call ; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed . I trust that you have realized about the ten days ' interval . It does not count that I helped you with the stair - eyes yesterday . It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon . "
50109	50164	49597	49598	Mr. Emerson	149	" Yes , go and bathe , George . Why do you dawdle talking ? Bring them back to tea . Bring back some milk , cakes , honey . The change will do you good . George has been working very hard at his office . I ca n't believe he 's well . "
50185	50193	50194	50194	Freddy	121	" Do you really want this bathe ? "
50198	50220	50194	50194	Freddy	121	" It is only a pond , do n't you know . I dare say you are used to something better . "
50221	50232	50167	50167	his	115	" Yes - I have said ' Yes ' already . "
50369	50395	50336	50336	He	116	" And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse ! Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here ? "
50396	50406	50336	50336	He	116	" I did not . Miss Lavish told me . "
50407	50427	50336	50336	He	116	" When I was a young man , I always meant to write a ' History of Coincidence . ' "
50431	50468	50336	50336	He	116	" Though , as a matter of fact , coincidences are much rarer than we suppose . For example , it is n't purely coincidentally that you are here now , when one comes to reflect . "
50478	50522	50473	50473	George	115	" It is . I have reflected . It is Fate . Everything is Fate . We are flung together by Fate , drawn apart by Fate - flung together , drawn apart . The twelve winds blow us - we settle nothing - "
50523	50531	50533	50534	the clergyman	332	" You have not reflected at all , "
50536	50591	50533	50534	the clergyman	332	" Let me give you a useful tip , Emerson : attribute nothing to Fate . Do n't say , ' I did n't do this , ' for you did it , ten to one . Now I 'll cross - question you . Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself ? "
50592	50595	50473	50473	George	115	" Italy . "
50596	50613	50533	50534	the clergyman	332	" And where did you meet Mr. Vyse , who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch ? "
50614	50618	50473	50473	George	115	" National Gallery . "
50619	50664	50533	50534	the clergyman	332	" Looking at Italian art . There you are , and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate . You naturally seek out things Italian , and so do we and our friends . This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it . "
50665	50674	50676	50676	George	115	" It is Fate that I am here , "
50678	50692	50676	50676	George	115	" But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy . "
50722	50742	50706	50706	he	116	" And so for this and for other reasons my ' History of Coincidence ' is still to write . "
50755	50766	50752	50752	he	116	" We are all so glad that you have come . "
50769	50774	50776	50776	Freddy	121	" Here we are ! "
50778	50783	50785	50786	Mr. Beebe	116	" Oh , good ! "
50792	50805	50806	50806	he	116	" In there 's the pond . I wish it was bigger , "
50885	50895	50897	50898	Mr. Beebe	116	" It 's distinctly successful , as ponds go , "
50900	50909	50897	50898	Mr. Beebe	116	" No apologies are necessary for the pond . "
50925	50953	51024	51025	Mr. Beebe	116	" Are n't those masses of willow - herb splendid ? I love willow - herb in seed . What 's the name of this aromatic plant ? "
50963	51005	51024	51025	Mr. Beebe	116	" These abrupt changes of vegetation - this little spongeous tract of water plants , and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle - heather , bracken , hurts , pines . Very charming , very charming .
51006	51015	51017	51017	Freddy	121	" Mr. Beebe , are n't you bathing ? "
51031	51036	51038	51038	Freddy	121	" Water 's wonderful ! "
51043	51048	51050	51050	George	115	" Water 's water , "
51121	51128	51130	51130	Freddy	121	" Apooshoo , apooshoo , apooshoo , "
51149	51155	51157	51158	the other	2481	" Is it worth it ? "
51185	51208	51172	51172	he	121	" Hee - poof - I 've swallowed a pollywog , Mr. Beebe , water 's wonderful , water 's simply ripping . "
51209	51216	51218	51218	George	115	" Water 's not so bad , "
51231	51241	51172	51172	he	121	" Water 's wonderful . Mr. Beebe , do . "
51242	51247	51172	51172	he	121	" Apooshoo , kouf . "
51338	51345	51349	51349	his	121	" I may as well wash too "
51543	51551	51553	51553	Freddy	121	" Race you round it , then , "
51640	51665	51728	51729	Mr. Beebe	116	" No . We are what matters . Without us shall no enterprise begin . To us shall all flesh turn in the end . "
51666	51673	51675	51675	Freddy	121	" A try ! A try ! "
51692	51696	51697	51697	George	115	" Socker rules , "
51708	51711	51697	51697	George	115	" Goal ! "
51712	51715	51697	51697	George	115	" Goal ! "
51716	51719	51697	51697	George	115	" Pass ! "
51720	51726	51728	51729	Mr. Beebe	116	" Take care my watch ! "
51737	51759	51697	51697	George	115	" Take care my hat ! No , that 's enough , Freddy . Dress now . No , I say ! "
51796	51801	51803	51804	Mr. Beebe	116	" That 'll do ! "
51832	51845	51818	51818	his	116	" Hi ! Steady on ! I see people coming you fellows ! "
51856	51863	51818	51818	his	116	" Hi ! hi ! LADIES ! "
51946	51950	51952	51953	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Gracious alive ! "
51955	51980	51952	51953	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Whoever were those unfortunate people ? Oh , dears , look away ! And poor Mr. Beebe , too ! Whatever has happened ? "
51981	51987	51989	51989	Cecil	198	" Come this way immediately , "
52028	52052	52016	52016	He	198	" Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path ? Cecil , Mr. Beebe 's waistcoat - "
52071	52074	52063	52063	Lucy	112	" minded . "
52075	52086	52059	52059	Cecil	198	" I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond . "
52087	52099	52059	52059	Cecil	198	" This way , please , Mrs. Honeychurch , this way . "
52121	52130	52138	52138	Freddy	121	" Well , I ca n't help it , "
52154	52165	52138	52138	Freddy	121	" I ca n't be trodden on , can I ? "
52166	52198	52059	52059	Cecil	198	" Good gracious me , dear ; so it 's you ! What miserable management ! Why not have a comfortable bath at home , with hot and cold laid on ? "
52199	52223	52138	52138	Freddy	121	" Look here , mother , a fellow must wash , and a fellow 's got to dry , and if another fellow - "
52224	52248	52249	52249	They	1480	" Dear , no doubt you 're right as usual , but you are in no position to argue . Come , Lucy . "
52252	52271	52249	52249	They	1480	" Oh , look - do n't look ! Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! How unfortunate again - "
52313	52322	52324	52324	he	115	" And me , I 've swallowed one , "
52329	52357	52324	52324	he	115	" I 've swallowed a pollywog . It wriggleth in my tummy . I shall die - Emerson you beast , you 've got on my bags . "
52358	52363	52365	52366	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Hush , dears , "
52376	52396	52365	52366	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first . All these colds come of not drying thoroughly . "
52397	52404	52406	52406	Lucy	112	" Mother , do come away , "
52408	52418	52406	52406	Lucy	112	" Oh for goodness ' sake , do come . "
52419	52422	52424	52424	George	115	" Hullo ! "
52456	52464	52453	52453	he	115	" Hullo , Miss Honeychurch ! Hullo ! "
52465	52481	52453	52453	he	115	" Bow , Lucy ; better bow . Whoever is it ? I shall bow . "
52745	52750	52751	52751	she	112	" I will bow , "
52755	52772	52751	52751	she	112	" I will not shake hands with him . That will be just the proper thing . "
52887	52889	52875	52875	he	198	" Yes "
52891	52893	52875	52875	he	198	" No "
52977	52980	52982	52983	her mother	442	" Lucy , "
52990	52998	52982	52983	her mother	442	" is anything the matter with Cecil ? "
53016	53032	52982	52983	her mother	442	" No , I do n't think so , mother ; Cecil 's all right . "
53033	53039	52982	52983	her mother	442	" Perhaps he 's tired . "
53050	53053	53055	53055	she	112	" Because otherwise "
53066	53076	53055	53055	she	112	" because otherwise I can not account for him . "
53077	53092	53055	53055	she	112	" I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome , if you mean that . "
53093	53135	53055	53055	she	112	" Cecil has told you to think so . You were devoted to her as a little girl , and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever . No - it is just the same thing everywhere . "
53136	53148	53055	53055	she	112	" Let me just put your bonnet away , may I ? "
53149	53162	53055	53055	she	112	" Surely he could answer her civilly for one half - hour ? "
53163	53173	53175	53175	Lucy	112	" Cecil has a very high standard for people , "
53181	53199	53175	53175	Lucy	112	" It 's part of his ideals - it is really that that makes him sometimes seem - "
53200	53224	53226	53227	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Oh , rubbish ! If high ideals make a young man rude , the sooner he gets rid of them the better , "
53234	53249	53055	53055	she	112	" Now , mother ! I 've seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself ! "
53250	53281	53055	53055	she	112	" Not in that way . At times I could wring her neck . But not in that way . No . It is the same with Cecil all over . "
53282	53307	53055	53055	she	112	" By - the - by - I never told you . I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London . "
53324	53399	53055	53055	she	112	" Since Cecil came back from London , nothing appears to please him . Whenever I speak he winces ; - I see him , Lucy ; it is useless to contradict me . No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical , but I can not help the drawing - room furniture ; your father bought it and we must put up with it , will Cecil kindly remember . "
53400	53452	53055	53055	she	112	" I - I see what you mean , and certainly Cecil ought n't to . But he does not mean to be uncivil - he once explained - it is the things that upset him - he is easily upset by ugly things - he is not uncivil to PEOPLE . "
53453	53465	53055	53055	she	112	" Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings ? "
53466	53483	53055	53055	she	112	" You ca n't expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do . "
53484	53505	53055	53055	she	112	" Then why did n't he leave the room ? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone 's pleasure ? "
53506	53515	53517	53517	Lucy	112	" We must n't be unjust to people , "
53688	53700	53638	53638	she	112	" Go and dress , dear ; you 'll be late . "
53701	53707	53638	53638	she	112	" All right , mother - "
53708	53721	53638	53638	she	112	" Do n't say ' All right ' and stop . Go . "
53787	53802	53782	53782	she	112	" Oh , dear , what shall I do , what shall I do ? "
53877	53886	53860	53860	Freddy	121	" I say , those are topping people . "
53887	53943	54040	54040	He	1522	" My dear baby , how tiresome you 've been ! You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred it 's much too public . It was all right for you but most awkward for every one else . Do be more careful . You forget the place is growing half suburban . "
53944	53956	53860	53860	Freddy	121	" I say , is anything on to - morrow week ? "
53957	53964	54040	54040	He	1522	" Not that I know of . "
53965	53978	53860	53860	Freddy	121	" Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis . "
53979	54000	54040	54040	He	1522	" Oh , I would n't do that , Freddy , I would n't do that with all this muddle . "
54001	54025	53860	53860	Freddy	121	" What 's wrong with the court ? They wo n't mind a bump or two , and I 've ordered new balls . "
54026	54039	54040	54040	He	1522	" I meant it 's better not . I really mean it . "
54102	54131	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Lucy , what a noise you 're making ! I have something to say to you . Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte ? "
54137	54151	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Yes . I really ca n't stop . I must dress too . "
54152	54157	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" How 's Charlotte ? "
54158	54162	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" All right . "
54163	54166	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Lucy ! "
54172	54195	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" You 've a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one 's sentences . Did Charlotte mention her boiler ? "
54196	54200	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Her WHAT ? "
54201	54233	54094	54095	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Do n't you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October , and her bath cistern cleaned out , and all kinds of terrible to - doings ? "
54234	54244	54246	54246	Lucy	112	" I ca n't remember all Charlotte 's worries , "
54249	54267	54246	54246	Lucy	112	" I shall have enough of my own , now that you are not pleased with Cecil . "
54282	54300	54279	54279	She	152	" Come here , old lady - thank you for putting away my bonnet - kiss me . "
54431	54439	54428	54428	Freddy	121	" Lucy , what 's Emerson like ? "
54440	54447	54449	54449	Lucy	112	" I saw him in Florence , "
54460	54474	54428	54428	Freddy	121	" Is he the clever sort , or is he a decent chap ? "
54475	54487	54428	54428	Freddy	121	" Ask Cecil ; it is Cecil who brought him here . "
54488	54498	54500	54500	Cecil	198	" He is the clever sort , like myself , "
54508	54519	54521	54522	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" How well did you know them at the Bertolini ? "
54524	54542	54428	54428	Freddy	121	" Oh , very slightly . I mean , Charlotte knew them even less than I did . "
54543	54561	54428	54428	Freddy	121	" Oh , that reminds me - you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter . "
54562	54568	54570	54570	Lucy	112	" One thing and another , "
54584	54617	54570	54570	Lucy	112	" Among other things , that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street , wondered if she 'd come up and see us , and mercifully did n't . "
54618	54630	54664	54664	She	152	" Lucy , I do call the way you talk unkind . "
54631	54637	54639	54639	Lucy	112	" She was a novelist , "
54692	54705	54708	54708	she	152	" If books must be written , let them be written by men "
54722	54733	54708	54708	she	152	" This year , next year , now , never , "
54865	54884	54854	54855	Miss Bartlett	111	" I have been thinking , Lucy , of that letter of Charlotte 's . How is she ? "
54885	54892	54854	54855	Miss Bartlett	111	" I tore the thing up . "
54893	54909	54854	54855	Miss Bartlett	111	" Did n't she say how she was ? How does she sound ? Cheerful ? "
54910	54927	54854	54855	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , yes I suppose so - no - not very cheerful , I suppose . "
54928	54964	54854	54855	Miss Bartlett	111	" Then , depend upon it , it IS the boiler . I know myself how water preys upon one 's mind . I would rather anything else - even a misfortune with the meat . "
54973	54978	54980	54980	Freddy	121	" So would I , "
54999	55006	55007	55007	she	1078	" And I have been thinking , "
55046	55046	55041	55041	Charlotte	111	"
55071	55076	55077	55077	she	1078	" Mother , no ! "
55080	55141	55077	55077	she	1078	" It 's impossible . We ca n't have Charlotte on the top of the other things ; we 're squeezed to death as it is . Freddy 's got a friend coming Tuesday , there 's Cecil , and you 've promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare . It simply ca n't be done . "
55142	55148	55208	55208	Cecil	198	" Nonsense ! It can . "
55149	55160	55077	55077	she	1078	" If Minnie sleeps in the bath . Not otherwise . "
55161	55168	55208	55208	Cecil	198	" Minnie can sleep with you . "
55169	55176	55077	55077	she	1078	" I wo n't have her . "
55177	55195	55208	55208	Cecil	198	" Then , if you 're so selfish , Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy . "
55196	55206	55208	55208	Cecil	198	" Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , "
55218	55223	55225	55225	Lucy	112	" It 's impossible , "
55227	55252	55225	55225	Lucy	112	" I do n't want to make difficulties , but it really is n't fair on the maids to fill up the house so . "
55255	55268	55208	55208	Cecil	198	" The truth is , dear , you do n't like Charlotte . "
55269	55332	55342	55343	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" No , I do n't . And no more does Cecil . She gets on our nerves . You have n't seen her lately , and do n't realize how tiresome she can be , though so good . So please , mother , do n't worry us this last summer ; but spoil us by not asking her to come . "
55333	55338	55340	55340	Cecil	198	" Hear , hear ! "
55363	55435	55342	55343	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" This is n't very kind of you two . You have each other and all these woods to walk in , so full of beautiful things ; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers . You are young , dears , and however clever young people are , and however many books they read , they will never guess what it feels like to grow old . "
55441	55460	55463	55463	Freddy	121	" I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike , "
55465	55495	55463	55463	Freddy	121	" She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool , and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right . "
55496	55525	55527	55527	Lucy	112	" I know , dear . She is kind to every one , and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return . "
55582	55605	55576	55576	She	111	" I ca n't help it , mother . I do n't like Charlotte . I admit it 's horrid of me . "
55606	55618	55576	55576	She	111	" From your own account , you told her as much . "
55619	55632	55576	55576	She	111	" Well , she would leave Florence so stupidly . She flurried - "
55703	55718	55720	55720	Cecil	198	" I suppose Miss Bartlett must come , since she boils eggs so well , "
55738	55749	55751	55751	Freddy	121	" I did n't mean the egg was WELL boiled , "
55753	55788	55751	55751	Freddy	121	" because in point of fact she forgot to take it off , and as a matter of fact I do n't care for eggs . I only meant how jolly kind she seemed . "
55813	55824	55825	55825	he	198	" May me and Lucy get down from our chairs ? "
55833	55841	55825	55825	he	198	" We do n't want no dessert . "
56057	56072	56074	56074	Cecil	198	" things that came out of nothing and meant she did n't know what . "
56108	56114	56103	56104	the reader	1559	" She loves young Emerson . "
56141	56143	56165	56166	the reader	1559	" nerves "
56244	56249	56251	56252	Mr. Beebe	116	" A nice fellow , "
56254	56275	56251	56252	Mr. Beebe	116	" He will work off his crudities in time . I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully . "
56279	56290	56276	56276	Lucy	112	" He seems in better spirits . He laughs more . "
56291	56294	56296	56297	the clergyman	332	" Yes , "
56299	56305	56296	56297	the clergyman	332	" He is waking up . "
56441	56448	56450	56451	Miss Bartlett	111	" I shall never forgive myself , "
56473	56502	56450	56451	Miss Bartlett	111	" I have upset everything . Bursting in on young people ! But I insist on paying for my cab up . Grant that , at any rate . "
56503	56512	56514	56514	Lucy	112	" Our visitors never do such dreadful things , "
56536	56557	56517	56518	her brother	831	" Just what I 've been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of , Lucy , for the last half hour . "
56558	56568	56570	56571	Miss Bartlett	111	" I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor , "
56580	56602	56517	56518	her brother	831	" All right , if you 'd really rather . Five shillings , and I gave a bob to the driver . "
56645	56656	56636	56637	Miss Bartlett	111	" But who am I to give the sovereign to ? "
56657	56668	56670	56670	Lucy	112	" Let 's leave it all till mother comes back , "
56672	56710	56670	56670	Lucy	112	" No , dear ; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me . We all have our little foibles , and mine is the prompt settling of accounts . "
56781	56811	56885	56886	Miss Bartlett	111	" Please - please - I know I am a sad spoilsport , but it would make me wretched . I should practically be robbing the one who lost . "
56812	56819	56821	56821	Cecil	198	" Freddy owes me fifteen shillings , "
56823	56838	56821	56821	Cecil	198	" So it will work out right if you give the pound to me . "
56839	56843	56845	56846	Miss Bartlett	111	" Fifteen shillings , "
56849	56857	56845	56846	Miss Bartlett	111	" How is that , Mr. Vyse ? "
56858	56884	56821	56821	Cecil	198	" Because , do n't you see , Freddy paid your cab . Give me the pound , and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling . "
56955	56963	56965	56966	Minnie Beebe	223	" But I do n't see that ! "
56975	56989	56965	56966	Minnie Beebe	223	" I do n't see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid . "
56990	57000	57001	57001	they	1583	" Because of the fifteen shillings and the five , "
57005	57018	57001	57001	they	1583	" Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound , you see . "
57019	57026	57027	57027	They	1583	" But I do n't see - "
57035	57106	57027	57027	They	1583	" No , thank you . I 'm done . I do n't see why - Freddy , do n't poke me . Miss Honeychurch , your brother 's hurting me . Ow ! What about Mr. Floyd 's ten shillings ? Ow ! No , I do n't see and I never shall see why Miss What's - her - name should n't pay that bob for the driver . "
57108	57115	57117	57118	Miss Bartlett	111	" I had forgotten the driver , "
57122	57148	57117	57118	Miss Bartlett	111	" Thank you , dear , for reminding me . A shilling was it ? Can any one give me change for half a crown ? "
57149	57155	57157	57159	the young hostess	1584	" I 'll get it , "
57165	57201	57117	57118	Miss Bartlett	111	" Cecil , give me that sovereign . No , give me up that sovereign . I 'll get Euphemia to change it , and we 'll start the whole thing again from the beginning . "
57202	57213	57215	57216	Miss Bartlett	111	" Lucy - Lucy - what a nuisance I am ! "
57248	57257	57238	57239	Miss Bartlett	111	" Have you told him about him yet ? "
57258	57265	57267	57267	Lucy	112	" No , I have n't , "
57285	57297	57274	57274	her	112	" Let me see - a sovereign 's worth of silver . "
57348	57360	57361	57361	she	111	" No , I have n't told Cecil or any one , "
57368	57403	57361	57361	she	111	" I promised you I should n't . Here is your money - all shillings , except two half - crowns . Would you count it ? You can settle your debt nicely now . "
57427	57431	57432	57432	she	111	" How dreadful ! "
57435	57455	57432	57432	she	111	" how more than dreadful , if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source . "
57456	57463	57465	57466	the girl	333	" Oh , no , Charlotte , "
57472	57486	57465	57466	the girl	333	" George Emerson is all right , and what other source is there ? "
57491	57517	57487	57488	Miss Bartlett	111	" For instance , the driver . I saw him looking through the bushes at you , remember he had a violet between his teeth . "
57523	57552	57518	57518	Lucy	112	" We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we are n't careful . How could a Florentine cab - driver ever get hold of Cecil ? "
57553	57561	57465	57466	the girl	333	" We must think of every possibility . "
57562	57570	57518	57518	Lucy	112	" Oh , it 's all right . "
57571	57588	57465	57466	the girl	333	" Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows . In fact , he is certain to know . "
57589	57627	57518	57518	Lucy	112	" I do n't care if he does . I was grateful to you for your letter , but even if the news does get round , I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it . "
57628	57633	57465	57466	the girl	333	" To contradict it ? "
57634	57642	57518	57518	Lucy	112	" No , to laugh at it . "
57662	57690	57465	57466	the girl	333	" Very well , dear , you know best . Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young . Ladies are certainly different . "
57691	57696	57697	57697	She	112	" Now , Charlotte ! "
57703	57743	57697	57697	She	112	" You kind , anxious thing . What WOULD you have me do ? First you say ' Do n't tell ' ; and then you say , ' Tell ' . Which is it to be ? Quick ! "
57747	57797	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" I am no match for you in conversation , dearest . I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence , and you so well able to look after yourself , and so much cleverer in all ways than I am . You will never forgive me . "
57798	57817	57465	57466	the girl	333	" Shall we go out , then . They will smash all the china if we do n't . "
57836	57861	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" Dear , one moment - we may not have this chance for a chat again . Have you seen the young one yet ? "
57862	57868	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" Yes , I have . "
57869	57873	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" What happened ? "
57874	57881	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" We met at the Rectory . "
57882	57890	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" What line is he taking up ? "
57891	57948	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" No line . He talked about Italy , like any other person . It is really all right . What advantage would he get from being a cad , to put it bluntly ? I do wish I could make you see it my way . He really wo n't be any nuisance , Charlotte . "
57949	57964	57744	57745	Miss Bartlett	111	" Once a cad , always a cad . That is my poor opinion . "
57968	57995	57996	57996	She	112	" Cecil said one day - and I thought it so profound - that there are two kinds of cads - the conscious and the subconscious . "
58046	58055	58057	58058	Miss Bartlett	111	" Once a cad , always a cad , "
58060	58240	58241	58241	She	1596	" What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head . I fell into all those violets , and he was silly and surprised . I do n't think we ought to blame him very much . It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly . It really does ; it makes an enormous difference , and he lost his head : he does n't admire me , or any of that nonsense , one straw . Freddy rather likes him , and has asked him up here on Sunday , so you can judge for yourself . He has improved ; he does n't always look as if he 's going to burst into tears . He is a clerk in the General Manager 's office at one of the big railways - not a porter ! and runs down to his father for week - ends . Papa was to do with journalism , but is rheumatic and has retired . There ! Now for the garden . "
58251	58282	58241	58241	She	1596	" Suppose we do n't talk about this silly Italian business any more . We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner , with no worriting . "
58504	58512	58499	58502	females preparing for worship	1608	" The men say they wo n't go "
58514	58522	58524	58524	Minnie	223	" Well , I do n't blame them "
58527	58532	58524	58524	Minnie	223	" need she go ? "
58534	58540	58499	58502	females preparing for worship	1608	" Tell her , no nonsense "
58542	58551	58524	58524	Minnie	223	" Anne ! Mary ! Hook me behind ! "
58553	58566	58499	58502	females preparing for worship	1608	" Dearest Lucia , may I trespass upon you for a pin ? "
58821	58848	58803	58803	she	112	" Lucy ! Lucy ! What 's that book ? Who 's been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil ? "
58849	58862	58803	58803	she	112	" It 's only the library book that Cecil 's been reading . "
58863	58879	58803	58803	she	112	" But pick it up , and do n't stand idling there like a flamingo . "
58967	58978	58963	58963	Cecil	198	" What ! you are n't forgetting your Italy already ? "
59014	59029	58989	58989	she	112	" Lucy - have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself ? "
59047	59111	59030	59030	She	112	" It 's a special collection - I forget what for . I do beg , no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies ; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence . Where is the child ? Minnie ! That book 's all warped . Gracious , how plain you look ! Put it under the Atlas to press . Minnie ! "
59112	59118	59034	59035	her mother	442	" Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch - "
59124	59136	59030	59030	She	112	" Minnie , do n't be late . Here comes the horse "
59148	59189	59030	59030	She	112	" Where 's Charlotte ? Run up and hurry her . Why is she so long ? She had nothing to do . She never brings anything but blouses . Poor Charlotte - How I do detest blouses ! Minnie ! "
59279	59308	59261	59262	Miss Bartlett	111	" Dear Marian , I am very sorry , but I have no small change - nothing but sovereigns and half crowns . Could any one give me - "
59309	59337	59261	59262	Miss Bartlett	111	" Yes , easily . Jump in . Gracious me , how smart you look ! What a lovely frock ! You put us all to shame . "
59338	59357	59359	59360	Miss Bartlett	111	" If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now , when should I wear them ? "
59389	59397	59400	59400	Cecil	198	" Good - bye ! Be good ! "
59417	59422	59431	59431	He	198	" church and so on "
59568	59572	59574	59575	her mother	442	" Introduce me , "
59577	59589	59574	59575	her mother	442	" Unless the young man considers that he knows me already . "
59672	59676	59677	59677	he	115	" Very much , "
59702	59737	59699	59699	He	115	" We find , though , that the Miss Alans were coming , and that we have turned them out . Women mind such a thing . I am very much upset about it . "
59738	59747	59749	59750	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I believe that there was some misunderstanding , "
59753	59768	59770	59770	George	115	" Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person , "
59781	59793	59770	59770	George	115	" He thought we should be artistic . He is disappointed . "
59794	59819	59820	59820	He	115	" And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up . What do you think ? "
59825	59834	59836	59836	Lucy	112	" Oh , stop now you have come , "
59863	59887	59922	59923	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" So George says . He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall . Yet it does seem so unkind . "
59888	59901	59903	59903	George	115	" There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world , "
59917	59920	59922	59923	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Yes ! "
59925	59944	59922	59923	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" That 's exactly what I say . Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans ? "
59945	59964	59965	59965	he	115	" There is a certain amount of kindness , just as there is a certain amount of light , "
59971	60040	59965	59965	he	115	" We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand , and it is no good moving from place to place to save things ; because the shadow always follows . Choose a place where you wo n't do harm - yes , choose a place where you wo n't do very much harm , and stand in it for all you are worth , facing the sunshine . "
60041	60053	59922	59923	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Oh , Mr. Emerson , I see you 're clever ! "
60054	60058	59965	59965	he	115	" Eh - ? "
60059	60082	59922	59923	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" I see you 're going to be clever . I hope you did n't go behaving like that to poor Freddy . "
60102	60109	60110	60110	he	115	" No , I did n't , "
60113	60143	60110	60110	he	115	" He behaved that way to me . It is his philosophy . Only he starts life with it ; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first . "
60144	60184	60083	60083	George	115	" What DO you mean ? No , never mind what you mean . Do n't explain . He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon . Do you play tennis ? Do you mind tennis on Sunday - ? "
60185	60202	60110	60110	he	115	" George mind tennis on Sunday ! George , after his education , distinguish between Sunday - "
60203	60239	60083	60083	George	115	" Very well , George does n't mind tennis on Sunday . No more do I. That 's settled . Mr. Emerson , if you could come with your son we should be so pleased . "
60265	60280	60260	60260	She	1646	" And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans . "
60281	60285	60287	60287	George	115	" I know , "
60349	60358	60360	60361	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" You know our cousin , Miss Bartlett , "
60364	60374	60360	60361	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" You met her with my daughter in Florence . "
60375	60380	60382	60384	the old man	310	" Yes , indeed ! "
60480	60495	60477	60477	He	115	" I - I 'll come up to tennis if I can manage it , "
60587	60594	60608	60608	his	347	" George , do n't go , "
60615	60638	60596	60597	his father	347	" George has been in such good spirits today , and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon . "
60655	60658	60659	60659	she	112	" Yes , "
60666	60673	60659	60659	she	112	" I do hope he will . "
60683	60699	60659	60659	she	112	" The old man has n't been told ; I knew it was all right . "
60767	60778	60779	60779	Her	112	" He has not told , he has not told . "
60785	60817	60818	60818	She	112	" He has not told his father - to whom he tells all things . It was not an exploit . He did not laugh at me when I had gone . "
60826	60852	60818	60818	She	112	" He does not love me . No . How terrible if he did ! But he has not told . He will not tell . "
60860	60881	60853	60853	She	112	" It is all right . It 's a secret between us two for ever . Cecil will never hear . "
60963	60977	60960	60960	she	112	" The Emersons have been so nice . George Emerson has improved enormously . "
60978	60984	60986	60986	Cecil	198	" How are my proteges ? "
61013	61016	61017	61017	she	112	" Proteges ! "
61054	61087	61088	61088	She	112	" You shall see for yourself how your proteges are . George Emerson is coming up this afternoon . He is a most interesting man to talk to . Only do n't - "
61092	61098	61088	61088	She	112	" Do n't protect him . "
61177	61201	61169	61175	a Being who whispered to her soul	1678	" It will not last , this cheerfulness . In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men . "
61336	61349	61327	61327	Cecil	198	" Now play us the other garden - the one in Parsifal . "
61355	61360	61362	61363	her mother	442	" Not very dutiful , "
61391	61399	61400	61400	she	112	" Oh , I had no idea ! "
61434	61442	61444	61445	Miss Bartlett	111	" Our performer has changed her mind , "
61492	61497	61499	61499	Freddy	121	" I vote tennis , "
61507	61513	61516	61516	she	112	" Yes , so do I. "
61522	61532	61516	61516	she	112	" I vote you have a men 's four . "
61533	61537	61489	61489	she	112	" All right . "
61538	61546	61548	61548	Cecil	198	" Not for me , thank you , "
61550	61558	61548	61548	Cecil	198	" I will not spoil the set . "
61580	61603	61604	61604	George	115	" Oh , come along Cecil . I 'm bad , Floyd 's rotten , and so I dare say 's Emerson . "
61608	61614	61604	61604	George	115	" I am not bad . "
61624	61632	61634	61634	Cecil	198	" Then certainly I wo n't play , "
61651	61671	61644	61644	she	111	" I agree with you , Mr. Vyse . You had much better not play . Much better not . "
61688	61702	61672	61672	Minnie	223	" I shall miss every ball anyway , so what does it matter ? "
61714	61723	61725	61726	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Then it will have to be Lucy , "
61728	61753	61725	61726	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" you must fall back on Lucy . There is no other way out of it . Lucy , go and change your frock . "
61914	61925	61900	61900	he	115	" I shall want to live , I tell you , "
62127	62141	62114	62114	He	198	" I say , listen to this , Lucy . Three split infinitives . "
62142	62145	62147	62147	Lucy	112	" Dreadful ! "
62204	62212	62199	62201	the other two	1706	" The scene is laid in Florence . "
62213	62234	62235	62235	She	112	" What fun , Cecil ! Read away . Come , Mr. Emerson , sit down after all your energy . "
62237	62239	62248	62248	she	112	" forgiven "
62271	62279	62258	62258	He	115	" You - and are you tired ? "
62280	62287	62258	62258	He	115	" Of course I 'm not ! "
62288	62295	62258	62258	He	115	" Do you mind being beaten ? "
62302	62305	62296	62296	She	112	" No , "
62319	62322	62323	62323	She	112	" Yes . "
62327	62354	62323	62323	She	112	" I do n't see you 're such a splendid player , though . The light was behind you , and it was in my eyes . "
62355	62362	62296	62296	She	112	" I never said I was . "
62363	62369	62323	62323	She	112	" Why , you did ! "
62370	62376	62296	62296	She	112	" You did n't attend . "
62377	62408	62323	62323	She	112	" You said - oh , do n't go in for accuracy at this house . We all exaggerate , and we get very angry with people who do n't . "
62409	62419	62421	62421	Cecil	198	" ' The scene is laid in Florence , ' "
62432	62441	62323	62323	She	112	" ' Sunset . Leonora was speeding - ' "
62445	62459	62442	62442	Lucy	112	" Leonora ? Is Leonora the heroine ? Who 's the book by ? "
62460	62510	62323	62323	She	112	" Joseph Emery Prank . ' Sunset . Leonora speeding across the square . Pray the saints she might not arrive too late . Sunset - the sunset of Italy . Under Orcagna 's Loggia - the Loggia de ' Lanzi , as we sometimes call it now - ' "
62516	62548	62511	62511	Lucy	112	" ' Joseph Emery Prank ' indeed ! Why it 's Miss Lavish ! It 's Miss Lavish 's novel , and she 's publishing it under somebody else 's name . "
62549	62556	62442	62442	Lucy	112	" Who may Miss Lavish be ? "
62557	62572	62511	62511	Lucy	112	" Oh , a dreadful person - Mr. Emerson , you remember Miss Lavish ? "
62588	62616	62584	62584	George	115	" Of course I do . I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street . It was she who told me that you lived here . "
62617	62623	62624	62624	She	112	" Were n't you pleased ? "
62626	62632	62624	62624	She	112	" to see Miss Lavish , "
62676	62684	62685	62685	she	112	" No wonder the novel 's bad , "
62688	62709	62685	62685	she	112	" I never liked Miss Lavish . But I suppose one ought to read it as one 's met her . "
62710	62717	62719	62719	Cecil	198	" All modern books are bad , "
62735	62745	62719	62719	Cecil	198	" Every one writes for money in these days . "
62746	62752	62685	62685	she	112	" Oh , Cecil - ! "
62753	62769	62719	62719	Cecil	198	" It is so . I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . "
62853	62866	62924	62924	he	115	" How do you like this view of ours , Mr. Emerson ? "
62867	62876	62924	62924	he	115	" I never notice much difference in views . "
62877	62883	62924	62924	he	115	" What do you mean ? "
62884	62902	62924	62924	he	115	" Because they 're all alike . Because all that matters in them is distance and air . "
62903	62906	62908	62908	Cecil	198	" H'm ! "
62919	62922	62924	62924	he	115	" My father "
62970	62970	62924	62924	he	115	"
62971	62981	62983	62983	Cecil	198	" I expect your father has been reading Dante , "
62998	63047	62924	62924	he	115	" He told us another day that views are really crowds - crowds of trees and houses and hills - and are bound to resemble each other , like human crowds - and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural , for the same reason . "
63053	63088	63092	63092	his	115	" For a crowd is more than the people who make it up . Something gets added to it - no one knows how - just as something has got added to those hills . "
63099	63105	63106	63106	she	112	" What a splendid idea ! "
63109	63129	63106	63106	she	112	" I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again . I 'm so sorry he 's not so well . "
63130	63138	63089	63089	He	115	" No , he is n't well . "
63139	63152	63154	63154	Cecil	198	" There 's an absurd account of a view in this book , "
63156	63180	63154	63154	Cecil	198	" Also that men fall into two classes - those who forget views and those who remember them , even in small rooms . "
63181	63192	63089	63089	He	115	" Mr. Emerson , have you any brothers or sisters ? "
63193	63198	63154	63154	Cecil	198	" None . Why ? "
63199	63207	63089	63089	He	115	" You spoke of ' us . ' "
63208	63216	63154	63154	Cecil	198	" My mother , I was meaning . "
63225	63236	63089	63089	He	115	" Oh , Cecil - how you made me jump ! "
63237	63249	63089	63089	He	115	" I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . "
63250	63281	63089	63089	He	115	" I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead . It is the first thing that I remember . "
63320	63331	63089	63089	He	115	" Cecil , do read the thing about the view . "
63332	63343	63286	63287	the man	2351	" Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us . "
63344	63375	63089	63089	He	115	" No - read away . I think nothing 's funnier than to hear silly things read out loud . If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous , he can go . "
63405	63415	63416	63416	She	112	" Mr. Emerson , go and find tennis balls . "
63469	63476	63478	63478	George	115	" Am I really to go ? "
63480	63488	63489	63489	she	1714	" No , of course not really , "
63492	63496	63498	63498	Cecil	198	" Chapter two , "
63502	63515	63498	63498	Cecil	198	" Find me chapter two , if it is n't bothering you . "
63536	63544	63547	63547	her	112	" Here - hand me the book . "
63551	63581	63547	63547	her	112	" It is n't worth reading - it 's too silly to read - I never saw such rubbish - it ought n't to be allowed to be printed . "
63589	63594	63595	63595	he	198	" ' Leonora , ' "
63598	63628	63582	63582	He	198	" ' sat pensive and alone . Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany , dotted over with many a smiling village . The season was spring . ' "
63654	63661	63662	63662	he	198	" ' A golden haze , ' "
63668	63698	63665	63665	He	198	" ' Afar off the towers of Florence , while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets . All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her - ' "
63717	63758	63714	63714	He	198	" ' There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use . No eloquence was his , nor did he suffer from the lack of it . He simply enfolded her in his manly arms . ' "
63759	63768	63769	63769	he	198	" This is n't the passage I wanted , "
63773	63783	63784	63784	He	198	" there is another much funnier , further on . "
63790	63798	63800	63800	Lucy	112	" Should we go in to tea ? "
63878	63881	63882	63882	she	112	" No - "
63975	63993	63970	63970	She	112	" I am not coming in to tea - tell mother - I must write some letters , "
64125	64130	64136	64136	she	112	" conquered her breakdown . "
64221	64228	64229	64229	she	112	" Something too awful has happened , "
64239	64250	64229	64229	she	112	" Do you know anything about Miss Lavish 's novel ? "
64281	64302	64259	64259	she	111	" There is a scene in it . The hero and heroine make love . Do you know about that ? "
64303	64307	64259	64259	she	111	" Dear - ? "
64308	64317	64318	64318	she	112	" Do you know about it , please ? "
64321	64335	64318	64318	she	112	" They are on a hillside , and Florence is in the distance . "
64336	64354	64259	64259	she	111	" My good Lucia , I am all at sea . I know nothing about it whatever . "
64355	64391	64318	64318	she	112	" There are violets . I can not believe it is a coincidence . Charlotte , Charlotte , how could you have told her ? I have thought before speaking ; it must be you . "
64392	64397	64398	64398	she	112	" Told her what ? "
64405	64413	64318	64318	she	112	" About that dreadful afternoon in February . "
64420	64437	64414	64415	Miss Bartlett	111	" Oh , Lucy , dearest girl - she has n't put that in her book ? "
64441	64452	64318	64318	she	112	" Not so that one could recognize it . Yes . "
64453	64470	64318	64318	she	112	" Then never - never - never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . "
64471	64477	64318	64318	she	112	" So you did tell ? "
64478	64499	64318	64318	she	112	" I did just happen - when I had tea with her at Rome - in the course of conversation - "
64500	64533	64318	64318	she	112	" But Charlotte - what about the promise you gave me when we were packing ? Why did you tell Miss Lavish , when you would n't even let me tell mother ? "
64534	64547	64318	64318	she	112	" I will never forgive Eleanor . She has betrayed my confidence . "
64548	64564	64318	64318	she	112	" Why did you tell her , though ? This is a most serious thing . "
64625	64679	64620	64620	Lucy	112	" Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson ; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again . Behind Cecil 's back . Ugh ! Is it possible that men are such brutes ? Behind Cecil 's back as we were walking up the garden . "
64690	64703	64620	64620	Lucy	112	" What is to be done now ? Can you tell me ? "
64704	64726	64620	64620	Lucy	112	" Oh , Lucy - I shall never forgive myself , never to my dying day . Fancy if your prospects - "
64727	64731	64733	64733	Lucy	112	" I know , "
64740	64779	64733	64733	Lucy	112	" I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil , and what you meant by ' some other source . ' You knew that you had told Miss Lavish , and that she was not reliable . "
64789	64792	64794	64795	the girl	333	" However , "
64803	64829	64794	64795	the girl	333	" What 's done 's done . You have put me in a most awkward position . How am I to get out of it ? "
64875	64962	64860	64860	She	111	" He must - that man must have such a setting down that he wo n't forget . And who 's to give it him ? I ca n't tell mother now - owing to you . Nor Cecil , Charlotte , owing to you . I am caught up every way . I think I shall go mad . I have no one to help me . That 's why I 've sent for you . What 's wanted is a man with a whip . "
64975	65009	64860	64860	She	111	" Yes - but it 's no good agreeing . What 's to be DONE . We women go maundering on . What DOES a girl do when she comes across a cad ? "
65010	65047	64860	64860	She	111	" I always said he was a cad , dear . Give me credit for that , at all events . From the very first moment - when he said his father was having a bath . "
65048	65098	64860	64860	She	111	" Oh , bother the credit and who 's been right or wrong ! We 've both made a muddle of it . George Emerson is still down the garden there , and is he to be left unpunished , or is n't he ? I want to know . "
65141	65166	65121	65121	She	111	" You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome . Ca n't you speak again to him now ? "
65167	65176	65121	65121	She	111	" Willingly would I move heaven and earth - "
65177	65184	65186	65186	Lucy	112	" I want something more definite , "
65189	65216	65186	65186	Lucy	112	" Will you speak to him ? It is the least you can do , surely , considering it all happened because you broke your word . "
65217	65229	65121	65121	She	111	" Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . "
65237	65248	65121	65121	She	111	" Yes or no , please ; yes or no . "
65249	65263	65264	65265	George Emerson	115	" It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle . "
65279	65283	65285	65285	Lucy	112	" Very well , "
65292	65306	65285	65285	Lucy	112	" No one will help me . I will speak to him myself . "
65322	65327	65329	65329	Freddy	121	" Hullo , Emerson ! "
65333	65346	65329	65329	Freddy	121	" Found the lost ball ? Good man ! Want any tea ? "
65360	65376	65329	65329	Freddy	121	" Oh , Lucy , but that is brave of you ! I admire you - "
65440	65480	65428	65428	She	112	" Freddy has taken him into the dining - room . The others are going down the garden . Come . Let us get this over quickly . Come . I want you in the room , of course . "
65481	65490	65428	65428	She	112	" Lucy , do you mind doing it ? "
65491	65501	65428	65428	She	112	" How can you ask such a ridiculous question ? "
65502	65506	65507	65507	She	112	" Poor Lucy - "
65513	65525	65507	65507	She	112	" I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go . "
65578	65583	65584	65584	Freddy	121	" Try the jam , "
65588	65595	65584	65584	Freddy	121	" The jam 's jolly good . "
65622	65629	65616	65616	he	115	" No - nothing to eat . "
65630	65638	65640	65640	Lucy	112	" You go down to the others , "
65642	65658	65640	65640	Lucy	112	" Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants . Where 's mother ? "
65659	65676	65616	65616	he	115	" She 's started on her Sunday writing . She 's in the drawing - room . "
65677	65687	65640	65640	Lucy	112	" That 's all right . You go away . "
65731	65768	65727	65727	She	111	" I ca n't have it , Mr. Emerson . I can not even talk to you . Go out of this house , and never come into it again as long as I live here - "
65779	65788	65727	65727	She	111	" I hate a row . Go please . "
65789	65792	65727	65727	She	111	" What - "
65793	65797	65727	65727	She	111	" No discussion . "
65798	65804	65727	65727	She	111	" But I ca n't - "
65810	65825	65805	65805	She	111	" Go , please . I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse . "
65826	65832	65833	65833	he	115	" You do n't mean , "
65841	65855	65838	65839	Miss Bartlett	111	" you do n't mean that you are going to marry that man ? "
65873	65879	65880	65880	she	111	" You are merely ridiculous , "
65892	65928	65885	65885	his	115	" You can not live with Vyse . He 's only for an acquaintance . He is for society and cultivated talk . He should know no one intimately , least of all a woman . "
65939	65950	65885	65885	his	115	" Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired ? "
65951	65957	65885	65885	his	115	" I can scarcely discuss - "
65958	66336	65885	65885	his	115	" No , but have you ever ? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things - books , pictures - but kill when they come to people . That 's why I 'll speak out through all this muddle even now . It 's shocking enough to lose you in any case , but generally a man must deny himself joy , and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person . I would never have let myself go . But I saw him first in the National Gallery , when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters . Then he brings us here , and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour . That is the man all over - playing tricks on people , on the most sacred form of life that he can find . Next , I meet you together , and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked , when it was for YOU to settle whether you were shocked or no . Cecil all over again . He dare n't let a woman decide . He 's the type who 's kept Europe back for a thousand years . Every moment of his life he 's forming you , telling you what 's charming or amusing or ladylike , telling you what a man thinks womanly ; and you , you of all women , listen to his voice instead of to your own . So it was at the Rectory , when I met you both again ; so it has been the whole of this afternoon . Therefore - not ' therefore I kissed you , ' because the book made me do that , and I wish to goodness I had more self - control . I 'm not ashamed . I do n't apologize . But it has frightened you , and you may not have noticed that I love you . Or would you have told me to go , and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly ? But therefore - therefore I settled to fight him . "
66345	66371	66373	66373	he	1747	" You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him , Mr. Emerson . Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit . "
66387	66393	66384	66384	He	1747	" Yes , I have , "
66402	66454	66455	66455	He	1747	" I 'm the same kind of brute at bottom . This desire to govern a woman - it lies very deep , and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden . But I do love you surely in a better way than he does . "
66458	66484	66485	66485	He	1747	" Yes - really in a better way . I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms , "
66491	66602	66485	66485	He	1747	" Lucy , be quick - there 's no time for us to talk now - come to me as you came in the spring , and afterwards I will be gentle and explain . I have cared for you since that man died . I can not live without you , ' No good , ' I thought ; ' she is marrying some one else ' ; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun . As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered . I called . I wanted to live and have my chance of joy . "
66603	66608	66610	66610	Lucy	112	" And Mr. Vyse ? "
66617	66643	66610	66610	Lucy	112	" Does he not matter ? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly ? A detail of no importance , I suppose ? "
66655	66668	66697	66697	he	1749	" May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition ? "
66672	66687	66691	66691	he	1749	" It is our last chance . I shall do all that I can . "
66715	66728	66729	66729	he	1749	" You would n't stop us this second time if you understood , "
66732	66755	66729	66729	he	1749	" I have been into the dark , and I am going back into it , unless you will try to understand . "
66778	66784	66785	66785	he	1749	" It is being young , "
66801	66822	66785	66785	he	1749	" It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really . It is that love and youth matter intellectually . "
66924	66940	66918	66918	they	1751	" Oh , Lucia - come back here - oh , what an awful man ! "
66952	66959	66960	66960	she	112	" Well , he amuses me , "
66963	67016	66960	66960	she	112	" Either I 'm mad , or else he is , and I 'm inclined to think it 's the latter . One more fuss through with you , Charlotte . Many thanks . I think , though , that this is the last . My admirer will hardly trouble me again . "
67027	67080	67018	67019	Miss Bartlett	111	" Well , it is n't every one who could boast such a conquest , dearest , is it ? Oh , one ought n't to laugh , really . It might have been very serious . But you were so sensible and brave - so unlike the girls of my day . "
67081	67089	67098	67098	she	112	" Let 's go down to them . "
67193	67212	67266	67266	Cecil	198	" Hullo , Lucy ! There 's still light enough for another set , if you two'll hurry . "
67213	67221	67266	67266	Cecil	198	" Mr. Emerson has had to go . "
67222	67265	67266	67266	Cecil	198	" What a nuisance ! That spoils the four . I say , Cecil , do play , do , there 's a good chap . It 's Floyd 's last day . Do play tennis with us , just this once . "
67271	67321	67266	67266	Cecil	198	" My dear Freddy , I am no athlete . As you well remarked this very morning , ' There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books ' ; I plead guilty to being such a chap , and will not inflict myself on you . "
67452	67460	67461	67461	she	112	" I am very sorry about it , "
67464	67498	67461	67461	she	112	" I have carefully thought things over . We are too different . I must ask you to release me , and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl . "
67519	67526	67514	67514	her	112	" Different - how - how - "
67527	67541	67542	67542	she	112	" I have n't had a really good education , for one thing , "
67553	67591	67542	67542	she	112	" My Italian trip came too late , and I am forgetting all that I learnt there . I shall never be able to talk to your friends , or behave as a wife of yours should . "
67592	67611	67514	67514	her	112	" I do n't understand you . You are n't like yourself . You 're tired , Lucy . "
67612	67615	67616	67616	she	112	" Tired ! "
67623	67641	67616	67616	she	112	" That is exactly like you . You always think women do n't mean what they say . "
67642	67656	67514	67514	her	112	" Well , you sound tired , as if something has worried you . "
67657	67690	67616	67616	she	112	" What if I do ? It does n't prevent me from realizing the truth . I ca n't marry you , and you will thank me for saying so some day . "
67691	67701	67704	67704	she	112	" You had that bad headache yesterday - All right "
67709	67727	67704	67704	she	112	" I see it 's much more than headaches . But give me a moment 's time . "
67733	67788	67728	67728	He	1759	" You must excuse me if I say stupid things , but my brain has gone to pieces . Part of it lives three minutes back , when I was sure that you loved me , and the other part - I find it difficult - I am likely to say the wrong thing . "
67824	67886	67821	67821	she	112	" There are days when one sees clearly , and this is one of them . Things must come to a breaking - point some time , and it happens to be to - day . If you want to know , quite a little thing decided me to speak to you - when you would n't play tennis with Freddy . "
67887	67894	67896	67896	Cecil	198	" I never do play tennis , "
67901	67916	67896	67896	Cecil	198	" I never could play . I do n't understand a word you say . "
67917	67937	67821	67821	she	112	" You can play well enough to make up a four . I thought it abominably selfish of you . "
67938	67985	67896	67896	Cecil	198	" No , I ca n't - well , never mind the tennis . Why could n't you - could n't you have warned me if you felt anything wrong ? You talked of our wedding at lunch - at least , you let me talk . "
67986	67994	67996	67996	Lucy	112	" I knew you would n't understand , "
68000	68049	67996	67996	Lucy	112	" I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations . Of course , it is n't the tennis - that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks . Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain . "
68055	68161	68050	68050	She	112	" Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife - for instance , in London ; and are you fitted to be my husband ? I do n't think so . You do n't like Freddy , nor my mother . There was always a lot against our engagement , Cecil , but all our relations seemed pleased , and we met so often , and it was no good mentioning it until - well , until all things came to a point . They have to - day . I see clearly . I must speak . That 's all . "
68162	68171	68173	68173	Cecil	198	" I can not think you were right , "
68176	68208	68173	68173	Cecil	198	" I can not tell why , but though all that you say sounds true , I feel that you are not treating me fairly . It 's all too horrible . "
68209	68218	68050	68050	She	112	" What 's the good of a scene ? "
68219	68235	68173	68173	Cecil	198	" No good . But surely I have a right to hear a little more . "
68276	68280	68050	68050	She	112	" little more , "
68287	68312	68313	68313	He	198	" Do n't open the window ; and you 'd better draw the curtain , too ; Freddy or any one might be outside . "
68316	68361	68313	68313	He	198	" I really think we had better go to bed , if you do n't mind . I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards . As you say it is all too horrible , and it is no good talking . "
68445	68459	68442	68442	he	198	" But I love you , and I did think you loved me ! "
68460	68465	68466	68466	she	1760	" I did not , "
68469	68493	68466	68466	she	1760	" I thought I did at first . I am sorry , and ought to have refused you this last time , too . "
68549	68579	68537	68537	she	1760	" You do n't love me , evidently . I dare say you are right not to . But it would hurt a little less if I knew why . "
68580	68582	68614	68614	his	198	" Because "
68595	68608	68614	68614	his	198	" you 're the sort who ca n't know any one intimately . "
68617	68672	68673	68673	Her	1760	" I do n't mean exactly that . But you will question me , though I beg you not to , and I must say something . It is that , more or less . When we were only acquaintances , you let me be myself , but now you 're always protecting me . "
68677	68751	68753	68753	she	1760	" I wo n't be protected . I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right . To shield me is an insult . Ca n't I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second - hand through you ? A woman 's place ! You despise my mother - I know you do - because she 's conventional and bothers over puddings ; but , oh goodness ! "
68759	68859	68860	68860	She	1760	" conventional , Cecil , you 're that , for you may understand beautiful things , but you do n't know how to use them ; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music , and would try to wrap up me . I wo n't be stifled , not by the most glorious music , for people are more glorious , and you hide them from me . That 's why I break off my engagement . You were all right as long as you kept to things , but when you came to people - "
68875	68880	68869	68869	Cecil	198	" It is true . "
68881	68887	68888	68888	she	1760	" True on the whole , "
68897	68912	68869	68869	Cecil	198	" True , every word . It is a revelation . It is - I. "
68913	68926	68869	68869	Cecil	198	" Anyhow , those are my reasons for not being your wife . "
68930	68978	68927	68927	He	198	" ' The sort that can know no one intimately . ' It is true . I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged . I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother . You are even greater than I thought . "
68984	69093	68979	68979	She	1760	" I 'm not going to worry you . You are far too good to me . I shall never forget your insight ; and , dear , I only blame you for this : you might have warned me in the early stages , before you felt you would n't marry me , and so have given me a chance to improve . I have never known you till this evening . I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be . But this evening you are a different person : new thoughts - even a new voice - "
69094	69104	69105	69105	she	1764	" What do you mean by a new voice ? "
69113	69125	69127	69127	he	1765	" I mean that a new person seems speaking through you , "
69138	69157	69135	69135	She	1764	" If you think I am in love with some one else , you are very much mistaken . "
69158	69175	68979	68979	She	1760	" Of course I do n't think that . You are not that kind , Lucy . "
69176	69266	69135	69135	She	1764	" Oh , yes , you do think it . It 's your old idea , the idea that has kept Europe back - I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men . If a girl breaks off her engagement , every one says : ' Oh , she had some one else in her mind ; she hopes to get some one else . ' It 's disgusting , brutal ! As if a girl ca n't break it off for the sake of freedom . "
69271	69294	69267	69267	He	1766	" I may have said that in the past . I shall never say it again . You have taught me better . "
69308	69369	69295	69295	She	1767	" Of course , there is no question of ' some one else ' in this , no ' jilting ' or any such nauseous stupidity . I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was . I only meant that there was a force in you that I had n't known of up till now . "
69370	69391	69435	69435	His	1768	" All right , Cecil , that will do . Do n't apologize to me . It was my mistake . "
69392	69434	69435	69435	His	1768	" It is a question between ideals , yours and mine - pure abstract ideals , and yours are the nobler . I was bound up in the old vicious notions , and all the time you were splendid and new . "
69439	69476	69435	69435	His	1768	" I must actually thank you for what you have done - for showing me what I really am . Solemnly , I thank you for showing me a true woman . Will you shake hands ? "
69477	69483	69485	69485	Lucy	112	" Of course I will , "
69496	69526	69485	69485	Lucy	112	" Good - night , Cecil . Good - bye . That 's all right . I 'm sorry about it . Thank you very much for your gentleness . "
69527	69537	69435	69435	His	1768	" Let me light your candle , shall I ? "
69544	69559	69435	69435	His	1768	" Thank you . Good - night again . God bless you , Lucy ! "
69560	69567	69435	69435	His	1768	" Good - bye , Cecil . "

70253	70264	70266	70267	Miss Catharine	144	" Since Florence did my poor sister so much good , "
70269	70335	70266	70267	Miss Catharine	144	" we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter . Of course , Athens is a plunge , and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread ; but , after all , we can take that with us , and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train . But is there an English Church ? "
70344	70375	70266	70267	Miss Catharine	144	" I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens , but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople , we should be so grateful . "
70726	70738	70739	70739	he	332	" So you 're off for a minute , Mr. Vyse ? "
70745	70748	70742	70742	Cecil	198	" Yes , "
70754	70771	70772	70772	He	332	" I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch . "
70777	70816	70772	70772	He	332	" Is n't it wonderful ? Is n't it romance ? most certainly they will go to Constantinople . They are taken in a snare that can not fail . They will end by going round the world . "
70834	70935	70823	70823	he	198	" Is n't Romance capricious ! I never notice it in you young people ; you do nothing but play lawn tennis , and say that romance is dead , while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing . ' A really comfortable pension at Constantinople ! ' So they call it out of decency , but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn ! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans . They want the Pension Keats . "
70936	70947	70949	70949	Freddy	121	" I 'm awfully sorry to interrupt , Mr. Beebe , "
70951	70958	70949	70949	Freddy	121	" but have you any matches ? "
70959	70963	70965	70965	Cecil	198	" I have , "
70985	71000	70977	70977	he	116	" You have never met these Miss Alans , have you , Mr. Vyse ? "
71001	71004	70823	70823	he	198	" Never . "
71005	71137	71138	71138	He	1832	" Then you do n't see the wonder of this Greek visit . I have n't been to Greece myself , and do n't mean to go , and I ca n't imagine any of my friends going . It is altogether too big for our little lot . Do n't you think so ? Italy is just about as much as we can manage . Italy is heroic , but Greece is godlike or devilish - I am not sure which , and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus . All right , Freddy - I am not being clever , upon my word I am not - I took the idea from another fellow ; and give me those matches when you 've done with them . "
71153	71221	71138	71138	He	1832	" I was saying , if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background , let it be Italian . Big enough in all conscience . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me . There the contrast is just as much as I can realize . But not the Parthenon , not the frieze of Phidias at any price ; and here comes the victoria . "
71222	71228	71230	71230	Cecil	198	" You 're quite right , "
71232	71240	71243	71243	he	1832	" Greece is not for our little lot "
71305	71347	71302	71302	he	121	" I 'm so glad you only talked about books . Cecil 's hard hit . Lucy wo n't marry him . If you 'd gone on about her , as you did about them , he might have broken down . "
71348	71352	71302	71302	he	121	" But when - "
71353	71362	71302	71302	he	121	" Late last night . I must go . "
71363	71373	71302	71302	he	121	" Perhaps they wo n't want me down there . "
71374	71384	71302	71302	he	121	" No - go on . Good - bye . "
71385	71389	71394	71394	himself	116	" Thank goodness ! "
71405	71423	71401	71401	his	116	" It was the one foolish thing she ever did . Oh , what a glorious riddance ! "
71555	71560	71554	71558	the " garden - child	3266	" garden - child , "
71576	71652	71701	71702	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Oh , how do you do , Mr. Beebe ? Gracious what a mess everything is ! Look at my scarlet pompons , and the wind blowing your skirts about , and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in , and then the carriage having to go out , when I had counted on having Powell , who - give every one their due - does tie up dahlias properly . "
71659	71665	71667	71668	Miss Bartlett	111	" How do you do ? "
71691	71699	71701	71702	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Here , Lennie , the bass , "
71760	71768	71769	71769	he	1841	" Come for a walk with me , "
71773	71810	71769	71769	he	1841	" You have worried them as much as they can stand . Mrs. Honeychurch , I only called in aimlessly . I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern , if I may . "
71811	71855	71769	71769	he	1841	" Oh , must you ? Yes do . - Not the scissors , thank you , Charlotte , when both my hands are full already - I 'm perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it . "
71878	71909	71856	71857	Mr. Beebe	116	" Yes , Charlotte , I do n't want you - do go ; there 's nothing to stop about for , either in the house or out of it . "
71987	71998	71999	71999	he	116	" It is terrible , this havoc among the flowers , "
72002	72018	72020	72021	Miss Bartlett	111	" It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment , "
72023	72043	72020	72021	Miss Bartlett	111	" Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother . Or will she come with us ? "
72044	72061	71999	71999	he	116	" I think we had better leave Lucy to herself , and to her own pursuits . "
72062	72076	72078	72078	Minnie	223	" They 're angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast , "
72080	72117	72078	72078	Minnie	223	" and Floyd has gone , and Mr. Vyse has gone , and Freddy wo n't play with me . In fact , Uncle Arthur , the house is not AT ALL what it was yesterday . "
72118	72125	72129	72129	Arthur	281	" Do n't be a prig , "
72131	72139	72129	72129	Arthur	281	" Go and put on your boots . "
72165	72190	72140	72140	He	281	" How do you do ? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive . Would you come too ? "
72191	72202	72140	72140	He	281	" I do n't think I will , thank you . "
72203	72216	72140	72140	He	281	" No , I did n't suppose you would care to much . "
72228	72235	72237	72238	Mr. Beebe	116	" How delicate those Sonatas are ! "
72260	72264	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" Miss Honeychurch ! "
72265	72268	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" Yes . "
72269	72282	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" I met them on the hill . Your brother told me . "
72283	72288	72289	72289	She	112	" Oh he did ? "
72311	72323	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" I need n't say that it will go no further . "
72324	72335	72337	72337	Lucy	112	" Mother , Charlotte , Cecil , Freddy , you , "
72355	72381	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" If you 'll let me say so , I am very glad , and I am certain that you have done the right thing . "
72382	72398	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" So I hoped other people would think , but they do n't seem to . "
72399	72410	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise . "
72411	72420	72258	72258	Schumann	240	" So does mother . Mother minds dreadfully . "
72421	72429	72431	72432	Mr. Beebe	116	" I am very sorry for that , "
72496	72501	72542	72542	Minnie	223	" And Freddy minds . "
72502	72534	72542	72542	Minnie	223	" Still , Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much , did he ? I gathered that he disliked the engagement , and felt it might separate him from you . "
72535	72541	72542	72542	Minnie	223	" Boys are so odd . "
72594	72621	72591	72591	he	116	" I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan . That was really what brought me over . I thought it might amuse you all . "
72622	72626	72628	72628	Lucy	112	" How delightful ! "
72666	72675	72662	72662	she	112	" Going abroad ? When do they start ? "
72676	72683	72662	72662	she	112	" Next week , I gather . "
72684	72695	72662	72662	she	112	" Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back ? "
72696	72703	72662	72662	she	112	" No , he did n't . "
72704	72715	72662	72662	she	112	" Because I do hope he wo n't go gossiping . "
72747	72768	72737	72737	she	112	" Oh , do tell me more about the Miss Alans ! How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad ! "
72769	72789	72662	72662	she	112	" I want them to start from Venice , and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast ! "
72794	72806	72790	72790	She	112	" Oh , delightful ! I wish they 'd take me . "
72807	72837	72737	72737	she	112	" Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel ? Perhaps George Emerson is right . He says that ' Italy is only an euphuism for Fate . ' "
72838	72865	72790	72790	She	112	" Oh , not Italy , but Constantinople . I have always longed to go to Constantinople . Constantinople is practically Asia , is n't it ? "
72886	72898	72878	72880	the Miss Alans	149	" with Delphi , perhaps , if the roads are safe . "
72935	72955	72930	72930	she	112	" I did n't realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends , after Cissie Villa . "
72956	72982	72922	72922	He	116	" Oh , that 's nothing ; I assure you Cissie Villa 's nothing to me ; I would give anything to go with them . "
72983	73001	72930	72930	she	112	" Would your mother spare you again so soon ? You have scarcely been home three months . "
73002	73008	73010	73010	Lucy	112	" She MUST spare me ! "
73016	73027	73010	73010	Lucy	112	" I simply MUST go away . I have to . "
73037	73068	73030	73030	her	112	" Do n't you see that I HAVE to go away ? I did n't realize at the time - and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly . "
73069	73083	73116	73116	Cecil	198	" You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel - "
73084	73095	73030	73030	her	112	" Yes , yes . I knew you 'd understand . "
73158	73181	73145	73145	He	198	" Yes , of course ; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down . "
73182	73193	73194	73194	he	198	" I am afraid it has been a bothersome business , "
73198	73294	73145	73145	He	198	" No , not at all . Cecil was very kind indeed ; only - I had better tell you the whole truth , since you have heard a little - it was that he is so masterful . I found that he would n't let me go my own way . He would improve me in places where I ca n't be improved . Cecil wo n't let a woman decide for herself - in fact , he dare n't . What nonsense I do talk ! but that is the kind of thing . "
73295	73354	73145	73145	He	198	" It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse ; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you . I do sympathize and agree most profoundly . I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism : Is it worth while rushing off to Greece ? "
73355	73362	73363	73363	she	1854	" But I must go somewhere ! "
73366	73382	73383	73383	She	1854	" I have been worrying all the morning , and here comes the very thing . "
73394	73435	73383	73383	She	1854	" I must ! And the time I shall have with mother , and all the money she spent on me last spring . You all think much too highly of me . I wish you were n't so kind . "
73448	73471	73439	73440	Miss Bartlett	111	" I must get away , ever so far . I must know my own mind and where I want to go . "
73472	73482	73484	73485	Mr. Beebe	116	" Come along ; tea , tea , tea , "
73530	73536	73537	73537	he	116	" She is playing again , "
73543	73549	73537	73537	he	116	" Lucy can always play , "
73555	73611	73537	73537	he	116	" One is very thankful that she has such a resource . She is evidently much worried , as , of course , she ought to be . I know all about it . The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak . "
73658	73691	73645	73645	she	111	" But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable . He assumed that much , and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her . Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns .
73698	73708	73692	73692	She	111	" We had much better let the matter drop . "
73709	73713	73692	73692	She	111	" I wonder . "
73714	73747	73692	73692	She	111	" It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street . It would be DEATH to gossip about Mr. Vyse 's dismissal at the present moment . "
73774	73807	73771	73771	He	116	" Of course , Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way , and when she chooses . Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind . "
73808	73812	73814	73815	Miss Bartlett	111	" I know , "
73818	73836	73814	73815	Miss Bartlett	111	" Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you . One can not be too careful . "
73837	73841	73771	73771	He	116	" Quite so . "
73842	73859	73814	73815	Miss Bartlett	111	" I do implore absolute secrecy . A chance word to a chattering friend , and - "
73860	73863	73771	73771	He	116	" Exactly . "
73924	74005	73918	73919	Mr. Beebe	116	" Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately ? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish . It is odd how we of that pension , who seemed such a fortuitous collection , have been working into one another 's lives . Two , three , four , six of us - no , eight ; I had forgotten the Emersons - have kept more or less in touch . We must really give the Signora a testimonial . "
74187	74213	74184	74184	he	116	" We sha n't have rain , but we shall have darkness , so let us hurry on . The darkness last night was appalling . "
74320	74329	74330	74330	he	116	" I have been thinking , Miss Bartlett , "
74333	74350	74330	74330	he	116	" and , unless you very much object , I would like to reopen that discussion . "
74354	74421	74422	74422	He	116	" Nothing about the past . I know little and care less about that ; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin 's credit . She has acted loftily and rightly , and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her . But the future . Seriously , what do you think of this Greek plan ? "
74429	74464	74422	74422	He	116	" I do n't know whether you overheard , but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career . It 's all - I ca n't explain - it 's wrong . "
74487	74498	74465	74466	Miss Bartlett	111	" I ca n't see the point of it myself . "
74506	74523	74503	74503	she	111	" There I can not agree with you . In it I spy Lucy 's salvation . "
74524	74531	74503	74503	she	111	" Really . Now , why ? "
74532	74540	74503	74503	she	111	" She wanted to leave Windy Corner . "
74541	74565	74503	74503	she	111	" I know - but it seems so odd , so unlike her , so - I was going to say - selfish . "
74566	74585	74503	74503	she	111	" It is natural , surely - after such painful scenes - that she should desire a change . "
74605	74659	74601	74602	Mr. Beebe	116	" So she says herself , and since another lady agrees with her , I must own that I am partially convinced . Perhaps she must have a change . I have no sisters or - and I do n't understand these things . But why need she go as far as Greece ? "
74660	74667	74669	74670	Miss Bartlett	111	" You may well ask that , "
74685	74765	74669	74670	Miss Bartlett	111	" Why Greece ? What is it , Minnie dear - jam ? Why not Tunbridge Wells ? Oh , Mr. Beebe ! I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning . I can not help her . I will say no more . Perhaps I have already said too much . I am not to talk . I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells , and she refused . "
74776	74840	74773	74773	his	116	" But my feelings are of no importance . I know too well that I get on Lucy 's nerves . Our tour was a failure . She wanted to leave Florence , and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome , and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother 's money - . "
74841	74851	74853	74854	Mr. Beebe	116	" Let us keep to the future , though , "
74856	74862	74853	74854	Mr. Beebe	116	" I want your advice . "
74863	74867	74869	74869	Charlotte	111	" Very well , "
74886	74901	74869	74869	Charlotte	111	" I for one will help her to go to Greece . Will you ? "
74906	74912	74913	74913	she	112	" It is absolutely necessary , "
74934	74941	74913	74913	she	112	" I know - I know . "
74959	75017	74952	74954	this odd woman	1871	" She must not stop here a moment , and we must keep quiet till she goes . I trust that the servants know nothing . Afterwards - but I may have said too much already . Only , Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone . If you help we may succeed . Otherwise - "
75018	75022	75046	75047	the clergyman	332	" Otherwise - ? "
75023	75026	75027	75027	she	112	" Otherwise , "
75036	75044	75046	75047	the clergyman	332	" Yes , I will help her , "
75054	75070	75046	75047	the clergyman	332	" Come , let us go back now , and settle the whole thing up . "
75126	75129	75095	75095	she	112	" another man "
75208	75222	75179	75179	His	332	" They that marry do well , but they that refrain do better . "
75421	75427	75428	75428	she	152	" It gets too dark , "
75432	75470	75428	75428	she	152	" This comes of putting off . We might have known the weather would break up soon ; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece . I do n't know what the world 's coming to . "
75471	75475	75476	75476	he	332	" Mrs. Honeychurch , "
75479	75512	75476	75476	he	332	" go to Greece she must . Come up to the house and let 's talk it over . Do you , in the first place , mind her breaking with Vyse ? "
75513	75524	75428	75428	she	152	" Mr. Beebe , I 'm thankful - simply thankful . "
75525	75530	75532	75532	Freddy	121	" So am I , "
75534	75544	75428	75428	she	152	" Good . Now come up to the house . "
75631	75641	75642	75642	she	152	" I do n't see why Greece is necessary , "
75645	75676	75642	75642	she	152	" but as you do , I suppose it is all right . It must be something I ca n't understand . Lucy ! Let 's tell her . Lucy ! "
75677	75684	75685	75686	Mr. Beebe	116	" She is playing the piano , "
75702	75711	75689	75689	He	116	" Look not thou on beauty 's charming . "
75712	75724	75685	75686	Mr. Beebe	116	" I did n't know that Miss Honeychurch sang , too . "
75725	75743	75689	75689	He	116	" Sit thou still when kings are arming , Taste not when the wine - cup glistens - "
75744	75759	75685	75686	Mr. Beebe	116	" It 's a song that Cecil gave her . How odd girls are ! "
75760	75765	75767	75767	Lucy	112	" What 's that ? "
75772	75778	75780	75781	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" All right , dear , "
75802	75823	75796	75796	her	152	" I am sorry I was so cross about Greece , but it came on the top of the dahlias . "
75830	75843	75796	75796	her	152	" Thank you , mother ; that does n't matter a bit . "
75844	75869	75881	75882	Mr. Beebe	116	" And you are right , too - Greece will be all right ; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you . "
75870	75880	75796	75796	her	152	" Oh , splendid ! Oh , thank you ! "
76024	76041	76042	76042	she	112	" Taste not when the wine - cup glistens , Speak not when the people listens , "
76045	76051	76042	76042	she	112	" Here 's Mr. Beebe . "
76052	76060	76042	76042	she	112	" Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways . "
76061	76072	76074	76074	he	1895	" It 's a beautiful song and a wise one , "
76076	76080	76074	76074	he	1895	" Go on . "
76081	76088	76089	76089	she	112	" It is n't very good , "
76093	76102	76089	76089	she	112	" I forget why - harmony or something . "
76103	76115	76042	76042	she	112	" I suspected it was unscholarly . It 's so beautiful . "
76116	76123	76125	76125	Freddy	121	" The tune 's right enough , "
76127	76140	76125	76125	Freddy	121	" but the words are rotten . Why throw up the sponge ? "
76141	76147	76149	76150	his sister	858	" How stupidly you talk ! "
76208	76218	76187	76187	Freddy	121	" This has been a day and a half . "
76219	76227	76200	76200	his	121	" Stop thine ear against the singer - "
76228	76237	76187	76187	Freddy	121	" Wait a minute ; she is finishing . "
76238	76259	76200	76200	his	121	" From the red gold keep thy finger ; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . "
76260	76267	76269	76269	Freddy	121	" I love weather like this , "
76335	76343	76328	76328	she	112	" Vacant heart and hand and eye - "
76348	76352	76328	76328	she	112	" the better part "
76392	76405	76328	76328	she	112	" Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . "
76584	76615	76577	76577	Lucy	112	" But , of course , you know all about these things , and you have Mr. Vyse to help you . A gentleman is such a stand - by . "
76639	76652	76653	76654	Miss Catharine	144	" We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you , "
76657	76682	76653	76654	Miss Catharine	144	" It is not every young man who would be so unselfish . But perhaps he will come out and join you later on . "
76683	76693	76695	76696	Miss Teresa	143	" Or does his work keep him in London ? "
76709	76730	76653	76654	Miss Catharine	144	" However , we shall see him when he sees you off . I do so long to see him . "
76731	76739	76741	76742	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" No one will see Lucy off , "
76744	76751	76741	76742	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" She does n't like it . "
76752	76761	76763	76763	Lucy	112	" No , I hate seeings - off , "
76765	76780	76741	76742	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Really ? How funny ! I should have thought that in this case - "
76781	76802	76741	76742	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , you are n't going ? It is such a pleasure to have met you ! "
76812	76825	76807	76807	Lucy	112	" That 's all right . We just got through that time . "
76832	76896	76827	76828	her mother	442	" I should be told , dear , that I am unsympathetic . But I can not see why you did n't tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it . There all the time we had to sit fencing , and almost telling lies , and be seen through , too , I dare say , which is most unpleasant . "
76933	76945	76905	76905	She	112	" But why should n't it be everywhere in no time ? "
76946	76983	77014	77014	she	112	" Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England . I shall tell them then . It 's much pleasanter . How wet it is ! Let 's turn in here . "
76984	76986	76905	76905	She	112	" Here "
77046	77073	77174	77174	Lucy	112	" Oh , well , let it be shop , then . Let 's go to Mudie 's . I 'll buy a guide - book . "
77074	77156	77174	77174	Lucy	112	" You know , Lucy , you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I 'm so stupid , so I suppose I am , but I shall never understand this hole - and - corner work . You 've got rid of Cecil - well and good , and I 'm thankful he 's gone , though I did feel angry for the minute . But why not announce it ? Why this hushing up and tip - toeing ? "
77157	77166	77174	77174	Lucy	112	" It 's only for a few days . "
77167	77173	77174	77174	Lucy	112	" But why at all ? "
77193	77214	77174	77174	Lucy	112	" Because George Emerson has been bothering me , and if he hears I 've given up Cecil may begin again "
77286	77325	77282	77282	She	152	" My daughter wo n't answer me ; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me . Any rag , tag , and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home . "
77342	77350	77337	77337	she	152	" You 're tired of Windy Corner . "
77438	77498	77434	77434	She	112	" I do not love George ; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George ; I must go to Greece because I do not love George ; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother ; every one else is behaving very badly . "
77528	77548	77522	77522	she	112	" Oh , mother , what rubbish you talk ! Of course I 'm not tired of Windy Corner . "
77549	77565	77611	77611	She	112	" Then why not say so at once , instead of considering half an hour ? "
77570	77578	77566	77566	She	112	" Half a minute would be nearer . "
77579	77592	77522	77522	she	112	" Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether ? "
77593	77602	77566	77566	She	112	" Hush , mother ! People will hear you "
77619	77669	77611	77611	She	112	" Of course I want to live at home ; but as we are talking about it , I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been . You see , I come into my money next year . "
77690	77693	77694	77694	Lucy	112	" eccentricity , "
77702	77764	77694	77694	Lucy	112	" I 've seen the world so little - I felt so out of things in Italy . I have seen so little of life ; one ought to come up to London more - not a cheap ticket like to - day , but to stop . I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl . "
77765	77775	77777	77778	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" And mess with typewriters and latch - keys , "
77780	77860	77777	77778	Mrs. Honeychurch	152	" And agitate and scream , and be carried off kicking by the police . And call it a Mission - when no one wants you ! And call it Duty - when it means that you ca n't stand your own home ! And call it Work - when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is ! And then to prepare yourself , find two doddering old ladies , and go abroad with them . "
77861	77867	77869	77869	Lucy	112	" I want more independence , "
77933	77994	77930	77930	her	112	" Very well . Take your independence and be gone . Rush up and down and round the world , and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food . Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted , and our dear view - and then share a flat with another girl . "
78003	78009	77995	77995	Lucy	112	" Perhaps I spoke hastily . "
78010	78015	78016	78017	her mother	442	" Oh , goodness ! "
78020	78030	78016	78017	her mother	442	" How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett ! "
78031	78034	78036	78036	Lucy	112	" Charlotte ! "
78049	78054	77995	77995	Lucy	112	" More every moment . "
78055	78076	78016	78017	her mother	442	" I do n't know what you mean , mother ; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike . "
78077	78114	77995	77995	Lucy	112	" Well , I see the likeness . The same eternal worrying , the same taking back of words . You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters . "
78115	78161	78016	78017	her mother	442	" What rubbish ! And if you dislike Charlotte so , it 's rather a pity you asked her to stop . I warned you about her ; I begged you , implored you not to , but of course it was not listened to . "
78162	78167	77995	77995	Lucy	112	" There you go . "
78168	78174	78016	78017	her mother	442	" I beg your pardon ? "
78175	78190	77995	77995	Lucy	112	" Charlotte again , my dear ; that 's all ; her very words . "
78196	78220	78191	78191	Lucy	112	" My point is that you ought n't to have asked Charlotte to stop . I wish you would keep to the point . "
78330	78341	78342	78342	she	112	" The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable , "
78379	78408	78373	78374	Mr. Beebe	116	" We shall have to sit three a side , because the trees drop , and yet it is n't raining . Oh , for a little air ! "
78418	78429	78410	78410	she	112	" He has not told - he has not told . "
78439	78447	78448	78448	she	112	" CAN'T we have the hood down ? "
78461	78472	78448	78448	she	112	" Very well , old lady , stop the horse . "
78538	78548	78549	78549	she	112	" Is that house to let again , Powell ? "
78552	78557	78558	78558	he	279	" Yes , miss , "
78561	78566	78628	78628	Lucy	112	" Have they gone ? "
78567	78605	78628	78628	Lucy	112	" It is too far out of town for the young gentleman , and his father 's rheumatism has come on , so he ca n't stop on alone , so they are trying to let furnished , "
78610	78617	78628	78628	Lucy	112	" They have gone , then ? "
78618	78627	78628	78628	Lucy	112	" Yes , miss , they have gone . "
78791	78794	78796	78797	the hostess	1950	" Certainly , "
78800	78820	78796	78797	the hostess	1950	" I forgot it was Friday . Let 's all go . Powell can go round to the stables . "
78821	78825	78796	78797	the hostess	1950	" Lucy dearest - "
78826	78835	78796	78797	the hostess	1950	" No church for me , thank you . "
78992	79000	78980	78981	Some one	454	" A lady to wait , sir . "
79019	79030	79031	79031	he	285	" Oh , Miss Honeychurch , that you should come ! "
79075	79132	79054	79054	George	115	" Miss Honeychurch , dear , we are so sorry ! George is so sorry ! He thought he had a right to try . I can not blame my boy , and yet I wish he had told me first . He ought not to have tried . I knew nothing about it at all . "
79148	79156	79142	79142	He	347	" But you must not scold him . "
79172	79177	79178	79178	he	347	" I taught him , "
79181	79233	79178	79178	he	347	" to trust in love . I said : ' When love comes , that is reality . ' I said : ' Passion does not blind . No . Passion is sanity , and the woman you love , she is the only person you will ever really understand . ' "
79237	79288	79290	79290	his	347	" True , everlastingly true , though my day is over , and though there is the result . Poor boy ! He is so sorry ! He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in ; that whatever you felt you did not mean . Yet "
79302	79311	79295	79295	he	347	" Miss Honeychurch , do you remember Italy ? "
79334	79350	79331	79331	she	112	" I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son . "
79351	79358	79331	79331	she	112	" But you do remember it ? "
79359	79368	79331	79331	she	112	" He has misbehaved himself from the first . "
79369	79395	79331	79331	she	112	" I only was told that he loved you last Sunday . I never could judge behaviour . I - I - suppose he has . "
79436	79444	79445	79445	she	112	" Why , he has behaved abominably , "
79448	79463	79445	79445	she	112	" I am glad he is sorry . Do you know what he did ? "
79464	79470	79412	79412	His	1963	" Not ' abominably , ' "
79476	79519	79412	79412	His	1963	" He only tried when he should not have tried . You have all you want , Miss Honeychurch : you are going to marry the man you love . Do not go out of George 's life saying he is abominable . "
79520	79526	79528	79528	Lucy	112	" No , of course , "
79537	79583	79528	79528	Lucy	112	" ' Abominable ' is much too strong . I am sorry I used it about your son . I think I will go to church , after all . My mother and my cousin have gone . I shall not be so very late - "
79584	79592	79593	79593	he	1965	" Especially as he has gone under , "
79597	79602	79528	79528	Lucy	112	" What was that ? "
79603	79608	79609	79609	He	1965	" Gone under naturally . "
79624	79630	79528	79528	Lucy	112	" I do n't understand . "
79631	79637	79528	79528	Lucy	112	" As his mother did . "
79638	79654	79528	79528	Lucy	112	" But , Mr. Emerson - MR . EMERSON - what are you talking about ? "
79655	79664	79666	79666	he	1965	" When I would n't have George baptized , "
79672	79701	79702	79702	He	1965	" And she agreed that baptism was nothing , but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round . She thought it a judgment . "
79705	79803	79702	79702	He	1965	" Oh , horrible , when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents . Oh , horrible - worst of all - worse than death , when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness , planted your little garden , let in your sunlight , and then the weeds creep in again ! A judgment ! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church ! Is it possible , Miss Honeychurch ? Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever ? "
79804	79810	79812	79812	Lucy	112	" I do n't know , "
79814	79832	79812	79812	Lucy	112	" I do n't understand this sort of thing . I was not meant to understand it . "
79833	79887	79702	79702	He	1965	" But Mr. Eager - he came when I was out , and acted according to his principles . I do n't blame him or any one ... but by the time George was well she was ill . He made her think about sin , and she went under thinking about it . "
79904	79910	79912	79912	Lucy	112	" Oh , how terrible ! "
79921	79927	79929	79931	the old man	310	" He was not baptized , "
79933	79939	79929	79931	the old man	310	" I did hold firm . "
79968	79979	79941	79941	he	310	" My boy shall go back to the earth untouched . "
79989	79995	79996	79996	He	310	" Oh - last Sunday . "
80002	80093	79996	79996	He	310	" George last Sunday - no , not ill : just gone under . He is never ill . But he is his mother 's son . Her eyes were his , and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful , and he will not think it worth while to live . It was always touch and go . He will live ; but he will not think it worth while to live . He will never think anything worth while . You remember that church at Florence ? "
80110	80142	80100	80100	she	112	" After you left Florence - horrible . Then we took the house here , and he goes bathing with your brother , and became better . You saw him bathing ? "
80143	80165	80100	80100	she	112	" I am so sorry , but it is no good discussing this affair . I am deeply sorry about it . "
80166	80244	80100	80100	she	112	" Then there came something about a novel . I did n't follow it at all ; I had to hear so much , and he minded telling me ; he finds me too old . Ah , well , one must have failures . George comes down to - morrow , and takes me up to his London rooms . He ca n't bear to be about here , and I must be where he is . "
80245	80249	80251	80252	the girl	333	" Mr. Emerson , "
80254	80279	80251	80252	the girl	333	" do n't leave at least , not on my account . I am going to Greece . Do n't leave your comfortable house . "
80294	80328	80285	80285	her	333	" How good every one is ! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me - came over this morning and heard I was going ! Here I am so comfortable with a fire . "
80329	80345	80285	80285	her	333	" Yes , but you wo n't go back to London . It 's absurd . "
80346	80395	80285	80285	her	333	" I must be with George ; I must make him care to live , and down here he ca n't . He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you - I am not justifying him : I am only saying what has happened . "
80396	80401	80403	80403	she	1971	" Oh , Mr. Emerson "
80410	80464	80403	80403	she	1971	" you must n't . I 've been bother enough to the world by now . I ca n't have you moving out of your house when you like it , and perhaps losing money through it - all on my account . You must stop ! I am just going to Greece . "
80465	80472	80473	80473	Her	1971	" All the way to Greece ? "
80477	80481	80473	80473	Her	1971	" To Greece ? "
80482	80505	80473	80473	Her	1971	" So you must stop . You wo n't talk about this business , I know . I can trust you both . "
80506	80530	80473	80473	Her	1971	" Certainly you can . We either have you in our lives , or leave you to the life that you have chosen . "
80531	80537	80473	80473	Her	1971	" I should n't want - "
80538	80574	80473	80473	Her	1971	" I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George ? No , it was wrong of George to try . We have pushed our beliefs too far . I fancy that we deserve sorrow . "
80683	80699	80677	80677	he	115	" No , please sit still . I think I will sit in the carriage . "
80700	80709	80677	80677	he	115	" Miss Honeychurch , you do sound tired . "
80710	80715	80717	80717	Lucy	112	" Not a bit , "
80723	80747	80677	80677	he	115	" But you are , and there 's a look of George about you . And what were you saying about going abroad ? "
80752	80754	80760	80760	he	115	" Greece "
80767	80782	80760	80760	he	115	" Greece ; but you were to be married this year , I thought . "
80783	80792	80794	80794	Lucy	112	" Not till January , it was n't , "
80813	80839	80760	80760	he	115	" I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you . I hope - it is n't because George spoke that you are both going ? "
80840	80843	80760	80760	he	115	" No . "
80844	80856	80760	80760	he	115	" I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse . "
80857	80861	80760	80760	he	115	" Thank you . "
80879	80885	80886	80886	he	116	" That 's all right , "
80890	80940	80886	80886	he	116	" I counted on you two keeping each other company . It 's pouring again . The entire congregation , which consists of your cousin , your mother , and my mother , stands waiting in the church , till the carriage fetches it . Did Powell go round ? "
80941	80950	80760	80760	he	115	" I think so ; I 'll see . "
80951	80967	80886	80886	he	116	" No - of course , I 'll see . How are the Miss Alans ? "
80968	80975	80760	80760	he	115	" Very well , thank you . "
80976	80985	80886	80886	he	116	" Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece ? "
80986	80992	80760	80760	he	115	" I - I did . "
80993	81037	81039	81039	he	1980	" Do n't you think it very plucky of her , Mr. Emerson , to undertake the two Miss Alans ? Now , Miss Honeychurch , go back - keep warm . I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling . "
81046	81052	81053	81053	she	1982	" He is not going , "
81057	81071	81053	81053	she	1982	" I made a slip . Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England . "
81211	81225	81203	81203	he	1980	" You are leaving him ? You are leaving the man you love ? "
81226	81233	81191	81191	she	1982	" I - I had to . "
81234	81242	81203	81203	he	1980	" Why , Miss Honeychurch , why ? "
81295	81309	81287	81287	her	1982	" My dear , I am worried about you . It seems to me "
81318	81326	81313	81313	she	1982	" that you are in a muddle . "
81332	81487	81488	81488	She	1989	" Take an old man 's word ; there 's nothing worse than a muddle in all the world . It is easy to face Death and Fate , and the things that sound so dreadful . It is on my muddles that I look back with horror - on the things that I might have avoided . We can help one another but little . I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life , but I know better now , and all my teaching of George has come down to this : beware of muddle . Do you remember in that church , when you pretended to be annoyed with me and were n't ? Do you remember before , when you refused the room with the view ? Those were muddles - little , but ominous - and I am fearing that you are in one now . "
81492	81511	81512	81512	She	1989	" Do n't trust me , Miss Honeychurch . Though life is very glorious , it is difficult . "
81517	81577	81512	81512	She	1989	" ' Life ' wrote a friend of mine , ' is a public performance on the violin , in which you must learn the instrument as you go along . ' I think he puts it well . Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along - especially the function of Love . "
81584	81599	81579	81579	he	1989	" That 's it ; that 's what I mean . You love George ! "
81619	81624	81625	81625	he	1989	" But you do , "
81634	81670	81625	81625	he	1989	" You love the boy body and soul , plainly , directly , as he loves you , and no other word expresses it . You wo n't marry the other man for his sake . "
81671	81676	81678	81678	Lucy	112	" How dare you ! "
81689	81713	81678	81678	Lucy	112	" Oh , how like a man ! - I mean , to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man . "
81714	81719	81625	81625	he	1989	" But you are . "
81725	81911	81625	81625	he	1989	" You 're shocked , but I mean to shock you . It 's the only hope at times . I can reach you no other way . You must marry , or your life will be wasted . You have gone too far to retreat . I have no time for the tenderness , and the comradeship , and the poetry , and the things that really matter , and for which you marry . I know that , with George , you will find them , and that you love him . Then be his wife . He is already part of you . Though you fly to Greece , and never see him again , or forget his very name , George will work in your thoughts till you die . It is n't possible to love and to part . You will wish that it was . You can transmute love , ignore it , muddle it , but you can never pull it out of you . I know by experience that the poets are right : love is eternal . "
81931	82054	82056	82056	he	1991	" I only wish poets would say this , too : love is of the body ; not the body , but of the body . Ah ! the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ! Ah ! for a little directness to liberate the soul ! Your soul , dear Lucy ! I hate the word now , because of all the ca nt with which superstition has wrapped it round . But we have souls . I can not say how they came nor whither they go , but we have them , and I see you ruining yours . I can not bear it . It is again the darkness creeping in ; it is hell . "
82060	82122	82056	82056	he	1991	" What nonsense I have talked - how abstract and remote ! And I have made you cry ! Dear girl , forgive my prosiness ; marry my boy . When I think what life is , and how seldom love is answered by love - Marry him ; it is one of the moments for which the world was made . "
82158	82163	82149	82149	she	1992	" Then , Lucy - "
82164	82170	82171	82171	she	1992	" You 've frightened me , "
82174	82187	82171	82171	she	1992	" Cecil - Mr. Beebe - the ticket 's bought - everything . "
82195	82229	82188	82188	She	1992	" I 'm caught in the tangle . I must suffer and grow old away from him . I can not break the whole of life for his sake . They trusted me . "
82240	82255	82257	82257	she	1992	" Give George my love - once only . Tell him ' muddle . ' "
82271	82274	82257	82257	she	1992	" Lucy - "
82275	82296	82257	82257	she	1992	" No - they are in the hall - oh , please not , Mr. Emerson - they trust me - "
82297	82309	82257	82257	she	1992	" But why should they , when you have deceived them ? "
82318	82324	82310	82311	Mr. Beebe	116	" Here 's my mother . "
82325	82334	82257	82257	she	1992	" You 're not worthy of their trust . "
82335	82340	82342	82343	Mr. Beebe	116	" What 's that ? "
82346	82361	82257	82257	she	1992	" I was saying , why should you trust her when she deceived you ? "
82362	82368	82369	82369	He	116	" One minute , mother . "
82377	82396	82257	82257	she	1992	" I do n't follow you , Mr. Emerson . To whom do you refer ? Trust whom ? "
82397	82420	82257	82257	she	1992	" I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George . They have loved one another all along . "
82460	82467	82469	82469	Lucy	112	" I shall never marry him , "
82483	82487	82480	82480	he	116	" Why not ? "
82488	82502	82480	82480	he	116	" Mr. Beebe - I have misled you - I have misled myself - "
82503	82511	82480	82480	he	116	" Oh , rubbish , Miss Honeychurch ! "
82512	82518	82520	82522	the old man	310	" It is not rubbish ! "
82525	82538	82520	82522	the old man	310	" It 's the part of people that you do n't understand . "
82552	82557	82480	82480	he	116	" Lucy ! Lucy ! "
82564	82573	82574	82574	He	116	" Mr. Beebe , could you help me ? "
82590	82609	82574	82574	He	116	" I am more grieved than I can possibly express . It is lamentable , lamentable - incredible . "
82610	82618	82621	82622	the other	2481	" What 's wrong with the boy ? "
82625	82650	82651	82651	He	116	" Nothing , Mr. Emerson , except that he no longer interests me . Marry George , Miss Honeychurch . He will do admirably . "
82668	82671	82672	82673	the voices	2002	" Lucy ! "
82700	82820	82822	82822	his	2004	" Now it is all dark . Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed . I know . But remember the mountains over Florence and the view . Ah , dear , if I were George , and gave you one kiss , it would make you brave . You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth , out into the muddle that you have made yourself ; and your mother and all your friends will despise you , oh , my darling , and rightly , if it is ever right to despise . George still dark , all the tussle and the misery without a word from him . Am I justified ? "
82828	82852	82822	82822	his	2004	" Yes , for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure ; there is Truth . Truth counts , Truth does count . "
82853	82858	82860	82861	the girl	333	" You kiss me , "
82863	82872	82860	82861	the girl	333	" You kiss me . I will try . "
82947	82952	82953	82953	she	333	" never exactly understood , "
82960	82984	82953	82953	she	333	" how he managed to strengthen her . It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once . "
83127	83134	83136	83136	Lucy	112	" No , it is n't , "
83138	83167	83136	83136	Lucy	112	" because it is the room I had , and I had your father 's room . I forget why ; Charlotte made me , for some reason . "
83183	83192	83168	83168	He	115	" George , you baby , get up . "
83193	83202	83204	83204	George	115	" Why should n't I be a baby ? "
83240	83246	83247	83247	she	112	" Oh , bother Charlotte , "
83251	83260	83247	83247	she	112	" What can such people be made of ? "
83261	83270	83212	83212	she	112	" Same stuff as parsons are made of . "
83271	83274	83247	83247	she	112	" Nonsense ! "
83275	83283	83212	83212	she	112	" Quite right . It is nonsense . "
83284	83311	83247	83247	she	112	" Now you get up off the cold floor , or you 'll be starting rheumatism next , and you stop laughing and being so silly . "
83312	83319	83320	83320	he	115	" Why should n't I laugh ? "
83336	83348	83349	83349	He	115	" What 's there to cry at ? Kiss me here . "
83415	83419	83420	83420	he	115	" Any letters ? "
83423	83430	83448	83448	he	115	" Just a line from Freddy . "
83431	83440	83448	83448	he	115	" Now kiss me here ; then here . "
83590	83613	83643	83643	George	115	" Lucy , you come and look at the cypresses ; and the church , whatever its name is , still shows . "
83614	83625	83643	83643	George	115	" San Miniato . I 'll just finish your sock . "
83626	83634	83636	83637	the cabman	2035	" Signorino , domani faremo uno giro , "
83701	83709	83733	83733	they	205	" Anything good in Freddy 's letter ? "
83710	83714	83715	83715	His	115	" Not yet . "
83751	83757	83733	83733	they	205	" What does he say ? "
83758	83821	83733	83733	they	205	" Silly boy ! He thinks he 's being dignified . He knew we should go off in the spring - he has known it for six months - that if mother would n't give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands . They had fair warning , and now he calls it an elopement . Ridiculous boy - "
83822	83830	83733	83733	they	205	" Signorino , domani faremo uno giro - "
83831	83904	83733	83733	they	205	" But it will all come right in the end . He has to build us both up from the beginning again . I wish , though , that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women . He has , for the second time , quite altered . Why will men have theories about women ? I have n't any about men . I wish , too , that Mr. Beebe - "
83905	83912	83733	83733	they	205	" You may well wish that . "
83913	83977	83733	83733	they	205	" He will never forgive us - I mean , he will never be interested in us again . I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner . I wish he had n't - But if we act the truth , the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run . "
83978	83981	83983	83983	he	2039	" Perhaps . "
83988	84015	83983	83983	he	2039	" Well , I acted the truth - the only thing I did do - and you came back to me . So possibly you know . "
84023	84029	84030	84030	He	2039	" Nonsense with that sock . "
84103	84109	84099	84099	They	2042	" Signorino , domani faremo - "
84110	84117	84119	84119	Lucy	112	" Oh , bother that man ! "
84128	84138	84119	84119	Lucy	112	" No , do n't be rude to him . "
84150	84171	84147	84147	she	112	" Mr. Eager and Charlotte , dreadful frozen Charlotte . How cruel she would be to a man like that ! "
84172	84182	84099	84099	They	2042	" Look at the lights going over the bridge . "
84183	84258	84260	84260	she	2045	" But this room reminds me of Charlotte . How horrible to grow old in Charlotte 's way ! To think that evening at the rectory that she should n't have heard your father was in the house . For she would have stopped me going in , and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense . You could n't have made me . When I am very happy "
84264	84303	84260	84260	she	2045	" I remember on how little it all hangs . If Charlotte had only known , she would have stopped me going in , and I should have gone to silly Greece , and become different for ever . "
84304	84310	84312	84312	George	115	" But she did know , "
84327	84327	84323	84323	He	2140	"
84328	84364	84380	84380	her	2047	" Oh , no , she did n't see him . She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe , do n't you remember , and then went straight to the church . She said so . "
84370	84374	84376	84376	he	115	" My father , "
84433	84433	84426	84426	He	2140	"
84497	84527	84488	84488	George	115	" It 's clear that she knew . Then , why did she risk the meeting ? She knew he was there , and yet she went to church . "
84556	84573	84549	84549	She	112	" How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment . "
84606	84613	84603	84603	George	115	" Or did she mean it ? "
84614	84618	84678	84679	The cabman	2035	" Mean what ? "
84619	84627	84603	84603	George	115	" Signorino , domani faremo uno giro - "
84636	84646	84628	84628	Lucy	112	" Lascia , prego , lascia . Siamo sposati . "
84647	84653	84654	84654	he	115	" Scusi tanto , signora , "
84666	84673	84603	84603	George	115	" Buona sera - e grazie . "
84674	84677	84603	84603	George	115	" Niente . "
84684	84690	84603	84603	George	115	" Mean what , George ? "
84694	84911	84691	84691	He	115	" Is it this ? Is this possible ? I 'll put a marvel to you . That your cousin has always hoped . That from the very first moment we met , she hoped , far down in her mind , that we should be like this - of course , very far down . That she fought us on the surface , and yet she hoped . I ca n't explain her any other way . Can you ? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer ; how she gave you no peace ; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable . The sight of us haunted her - or she could n't have described us as she did to her friend . There are details - it burnt . I read the book afterwards . She is not frozen , Lucy , she is not withered up all through . She tore us apart twice , but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy . We can never make friends with her or thank her . But I do believe that , far down in her heart , far below all speech and behaviour , she is glad . "
84912	84917	84919	84919	Lucy	112	" It is impossible , "
84935	84943	84932	84932	she	112	" No - it is just possible . "
