We 're going to have some first - rate sport . Oh , well ! we have n't much show of birds . We shot for pleasure , and returned them to the proprietors . You 're fond of game , parson ! Ripton is a dead shot in what Cousin Austin calls the Kingdom of ' would - have - done ' and ' might - have - been . ' Up went the birds , and cries Rip , ' I 've forgotten to load ! ' Oh , ho ! Rip ! some more claret . Do just leave that nose of yours alone . Your health , Ripton Thompson ! The birds had n't the decency to wait for him , and so , parson , it 's their fault , and not Rip 's , you have n't a dozen brace at your feet . What have you been doing at home , Cousin Rady ? "
10021	10050	10098	10098	Sandoe	132	" Playing Hamlet , in the absence of the Prince of Denmark . The day without you , my dear boy , must be dull , you know . "
10051	10080	10081	10081	Sandoe	132	" ' He speaks : can I trust what he says is sincere ? There 's an edge to his smile that cuts much like a sneer . ' "

10244	10250	10242	10242	Ricky	186	" said Adrian , interrupting . "
10274	10275	10270	10270	I	0	" "
10283	10287	10270	10270	I	0	" returned Adrian . "
10317	10318	10314	10314	you	6104	" "
10326	10330	10331	10331	I	0	" cried Richard . "
10350	10382	10348	10348	we	1042	" A fearful conspiratorial frown , that would not have disgraced Guido Fawkes , was darted back from the plastic features of Master Ripton . Richard gave his lungs loud play . "
10402	10429	10396	10396	you	193	" Another hideous and silencing frown was Ripton 's answer . Adrian matched the innocent youths , and knew that there was talking under the table . "
10432	10436	10437	10438	this boy	878	" thought he , "
10474	10480	10470	10472	My respected chief	1046	" he apostrophized Sir Austin , "
10520	10555	10507	10507	his	878	" a prophecy Adrian kept to himself . Uncle Algernon shambled in to see his nephew before the supper was finished , and his more genial presence brought out a little of the plot . "
10561	10565	10507	10507	his	878	" said Richard . "
10585	10586	10567	10567	you	1049	" "
10598	10603	10589	10589	I	0	" replied his uncle . "
10619	10632	10633	10633	I	0	" The boy looked savage , and his uncle patted him down . "
10644	10653	10639	10639	I	0	" said Richard , shouting for more wine . "
10668	10669	10673	10673	uncle	1049	" "
10675	10705	10673	10673	uncle	1049	" The boy nodded mysteriously . ' Look there ! ' Adrian read on Ripton 's face , he says ' never mind , ' and lets it out ! "
10715	10716	10719	10719	boy	1054	" "
10752	10753	10754	10754	We	1056	" "
10757	10761	10754	10754	We	1056	" cries Richard . "
10775	11123	11124	11125	Good creature	1060	" The bell was rung ; wine ordered . Presently comes in heavy Benson , to say supplies are cut off . One bottle , and no more . The Captain whistled : Adrian shrugged . The bottle , however , was procured by Adrian subsequently . He liked studying intoxicated urchins . One subject was at Richard 's heart , about which he was reserved in the midst of his riot . Too proud to inquire how his father had taken his absence , he burned to hear whether he was in disgrace . He led to it repeatedly , and it was constantly evaded by Algernon and Adrian . At last , when the boy declared a desire to wish his father good - night , Adrian had to tell him that he was to go straight to bed from the supper - table . Young Richard 's face fell at that , and his gaiety forsook him . He marched to his room without another word . Adrian gave Sir Austin an able version of his son 's behaviour and adventures ; dwelling upon this sudden taciturnity when he heard of his father 's resolution not to see him . The wise youth saw that his chief was mollified behind his moveless mask , and went to bed , and Horace , leaving Sir Austin in his study . Long hours the baronet sat alone . The house had not its usual influx of Feverels that day . Austin Wentworth was staying at Poer Hall , and had only come over for an hour . At midnight the house breathed sleep . Sir Austin put on his cloak and cap , and took the lamp to make his rounds . He apprehended nothing special , but with a mind never at rest he constituted himself the sentinel of Raynham . He passed the chamber where the Great - Aunt Grantley lay , who was to swell Richard 's fortune , and so perform her chief business on earth . By her door he murmured , "
11136	11143	11127	11127	you	1060	" and paced on , reflecting , "
11154	11871	11144	11144	She	1060	" and blessed her . He had his thoughts at Hippias 's somnolent door , and to them the world might have subscribed . A monomaniac at large , watching over sane people in slumber ! thinks Adrian Harley , as he hears Sir Austin 's footfall , and truly that was a strange object to see . Where is the fortress that has not one weak gate ? where the man who is sound at each particular angle ? Ay , meditates the recumbent cynic , more or less mad is not every mother 's son ? Favourable circumstances good air , good company , two or three good rules rigidly adhered to keep the world out of Bedlam . But , let the world fly into a passion , and is not Bedlam the safest abode for it ? Sir Austin ascended the stairs , and bent his steps leisurely toward the chamber where his son was lying in the left wing of the Abbey . At the end of the gallery which led to it he discovered a dim light . Doubting it an illusion , Sir Austin accelerated his pace . This wing had aforetime a bad character . Notwithstanding what years had done to polish it into fair repute , the Raynham kitchen stuck to tradition , and preserved certain stories of ghosts seen there , that effectually blackened it in the susceptible minds of new house - maids and under - crooks , whose fears would not allow the sinner to wash his sins . Sir Austin had heard of the tales circulated by his domestics underground . He cherished his own belief , but discouraged theirs , and it was treason at Raynham to be caught traducing the left wing . As the baronet advanced , the fact of a light burning was clear to him . A slight descent brought him into the passage , and he beheld a poor human candle standing outside his son 's chamber . At the same moment a door closed hastily . He entered Richard 's room . The boy was absent . The bed was unpressed : no clothes about : nothing to show that he had been there that night . Sir Austin felt vaguely apprehensive . Has he gone to my room to await me ? thought the father 's heart . Something like a tear quivered in his arid eyes as he meditated and hoped this might be so . His own sleeping - room faced that of his son . He strode to it with a quick heart . It was empty . Alarm dislodged anger from his jealous heart , and dread of evil put a thousand questions to him that were answered in air . After pacing up and down his room he determined to go and ask the boy Thompson , as he called Ripton , what was known to him . The chamber assigned to Master Ripton Thompson was at the northern extremity of the passage , and overlooked Lobourne and the valley to the West . The bed stood between the window and the door . Six Austin found the door ajar , and the interior dark . To his surprise , the boy Thompson 's couch , as revealed by the rays of his lamp , was likewise vacant . He was turning back when he fancied he heard the sibilation of a whispering in the room . Sir Austin cloaked the lamp and trod silently toward the window . The heads of his son Richard and the boy Thompson were seen crouched against the glass , holding excited converse together . Sir Austin listened , but he listened to a language of which he possessed not the key . Their talk was of fire , and of delay : of expected agrarian astonishment : of a farmer 's huge wrath : of violence exercised upon gentlemen , and of vengeance : talk that the boys jerked out by fits , and that came as broken links of a chain impossible to connect . But they awake curiosity . The baronet condescended to play the spy upon his son . Over Lobourne and the valley lay black night and innumerable stars . "
11877	11892	11874	11874	I	0	" exclaimed Ripton , inspired by claret ; and then , after a luxurious pause "
11907	11936	11938	11938	he	1062	" Richard allowed a long minute to pass , during which the baronet waited anxiously for his voice , hardly recognizing it when he heard its altered tones . "
11952	11953	11954	11954	You	0	" "
11957	11962	11954	11954	You	0	" returned Master Ripton . "
12044	12054	12035	12035	you	0	" Master Ripton intoned this abrupt interrogation verb seriously . "
12062	12075	12055	12055	I	0	" said Richard , all his faculties bent on signs from Lobourne . "
12080	12091	12055	12055	I	0	" Ripton persisted , ' suppose we are found out ? "
12092	12103	12104	12105	Sir Austin	186	" If we are , I must pay for it . "
12149	12157	12159	12159	Ripton	158	" What was the fellow 's name ? "
12165	12169	12161	12162	His companion	952	" Tom Bakewell . "
12170	12177	12179	12179	Ripton	158	" I 'll tell you what , "
12181	12218	12179	12179	Ripton	158	" You let it all clean out to your cousin and uncle at supper . How capital claret is with partridge - pie ! What a lot I ate ! Did n't you see me frown ? "
12246	12268	12242	12242	Richard	186	" Yes ; and felt your kick . It does n't matter . Rady 's safe , and uncle never blabs . "
12269	12296	12297	12297	Ripton	158	" Well , my plan is to keep it close . You 're never safe if you do n't . I never drank much claret before , "
12302	12332	12333	12333	he	158	" Wo n't I now , though ! claret 's my wine . You know , it may come out any day , and then we 're done for , "
12356	12370	12338	12338	Richard	186	" You 've got nothing to do with it , if we are . "
12371	12398	12400	12400	Ripton	158	" Have n't I , though ! I did n't stick - in the box but I 'm an accomplice , that 's clear . Besides , "
12402	12433	12400	12400	Ripton	158	" do you think I should leave you to bear it all on your shoulders ? I ai n't that sort of chap , Ricky , I can tell you . "
12812	12818	12820	12820	Richard	186	" He 's done it ! "
12826	12846	12820	12820	Richard	186	" Now you may say old Blaize'll soon be old Blazes , Rip . I hope he 's asleep . "
12847	12875	12876	12876	Ripton	158	" I 'm sure he 's snoring ! Look there ! He 's alight fast enough . He 's dry . He 'll burn . I say , "
12884	12894	12876	12876	Ripton	158	" do you think they 'll ever suspect us ? "
12895	12906	12820	12820	Richard	186	" What if they do ? We must brunt it . "
12907	12960	12820	12820	Richard	186	" Of course we will . But , I say ! I wish you had n't given them the scent , though . I like to look innocent . I ca n't when I know people suspect me . Lord ! look there ! Is n't it just beginning to flare up ! "
12974	12981	12983	12983	Richard	186	" I 'll fetch my telescope , "
13000	13027	12985	12985	Ripton	158	" No ; do n't go and lose the best of it . Here , I 'll throw open the window , and we can see . "
13127	13130	13132	13132	Richard	186	" Oh ! "
13138	13160	13132	13132	Richard	186	" if I had my telescope ! We must have it ! Let me go and fetch it ! I Will ! "
13601	13611	13613	13614	Sir Austin	186	" I trust you feel for this poor man , "
14069	14079	14080	14080	Adrian	346	" You know the grounds , my dear boy , "
14085	14115	14080	14080	Adrian	346	" Tell me ; do you think it easy to get to the rick unperceived ? I hear they suspect one of the farmer 's turned - off hands . "
14116	14127	14128	14128	Richard	186	" I tell you I do n't know the grounds , "
14132	14135	14128	14128	Richard	186	" Not ? "
14141	14153	14136	14136	Adrian	346	" I thought Mr. Thompson said you were over there yesterday ? "
14174	14188	14154	14154	Ripton	158	" Not ? You had good sport , gentlemen , had n't you ? "
14189	14194	14196	14198	the wretched victims	1132	" Oh , yes ! "
14222	14237	14239	14239	Adrian	346	" I suppose you were among the Fire - worshippers last night , too ? "
14241	14299	14239	14239	Adrian	346	" In some countries , I hear , they manage their best sport at night - time , and beat up for game with torches . It must be a fine sight . After all , the country would be dull if we had n't a rip here and there to treat us to a little conflagration . "
14300	14304	14306	14306	Richard	186	" A rip ! "
14319	14330	14306	14306	Richard	186	" You do n't mean this Rip , do you ? "
14331	14387	14388	14388	Adrian	346	" Mr. Thompson fire a rick ? I should as soon suspect you , my dear boy . You are aware , young gentlemen , that it is rather a serious thing eh ? In this country , you know , the landlord has always been the pet of the Laws . By the way , "
14398	14459	14388	14388	Adrian	346	" you met two gentlemen of the road in your explorations yesterday , Magians . Now , if I were a magistrate of the county , like Sir Miles Papworth , my suspicions would light upon those gentlemen . A tinker and a ploughman , I think you said , Mr. Thompson . Not ? Well , say two ploughmen . "
14460	14466	14468	14468	Richard	186	" More likely two tinkers , "
14470	14486	14487	14487	Ripton	158	" Oh ! if you wish to exclude the ploughman was he out of employ ? "
14502	14510	14487	14487	Ripton	158	" The tinker , or the ploughman ? "
14511	14514	14515	14516	Ingenuous Ripton	204	" The ploughm "
14549	14553	14554	14554	Adrian	346	" The ploughman ! "
14560	14639	14554	14554	Adrian	346	" Then we have here a ploughman out of employ . Given a ploughman out of employ , and a rick burnt . The burning of a rick is an act of vengeance , and a ploughman out of employ is a vengeful animal . The rick and the ploughman are advancing to a juxtaposition . Motive being established , we have only to prove their proximity at a certain hour , and our ploughman voyages beyond seas . "
14640	14649	14651	14651	Ripton	158	" Is it transportation for rick - burning ? "
14658	14736	14654	14654	Adrian	346	" They shave your head . You are manacled . Your diet is sour bread and cheese - parings . You work in strings of twenties and thirties . ARSON is branded on your backs in an enormous A. Theological works are the sole literary recreation of the well - conducted and deserving . Consider the fate of this poor fellow , and what an act of vengeance brings him to ! Do you know his name ? "
14737	14745	14747	14747	Richard	186	" How should I know his name ? "
15079	15086	15088	15088	Ripton	158	" Whatever shall we do now ? "
15128	15135	15137	15137	Richard	186	" There 's only one chance , "
15175	15184	15164	15164	Richard	186	" We must rescue that fellow from jail . "
15197	15210	15211	15211	Richard	186	" My dear Ricky ! but how are we to do it ? "
15220	15266	15211	15211	Richard	186	" We must manage to get a file in to him and a rope . It can be done , I tell you . I do n't care what I pay . I do n't care what I do . He must be got out . "
15267	15273	15275	15275	Ripton	158	" Bother that old Blaize ! "
15295	15418	15275	15275	Ripton	158	" Never mind old Blaize now . Talk about letting it out ! Look at you . I 'm ashamed of you . You talk about Robin Hood and King Richard ! Why , you have n't an atom of courage . Why , you let it out every second of the day . Whenever Rady begins speaking you start ; I can see the perspiration rolling down you . Are you afraid ? And then you contradict yourself . You never keep to one story . Now , follow me . We must risk everything to get him out . Mind that ! And keep out of Adrian 's way as much as you can . And keep to one story . "
15580	15602	15604	15605	Mrs. Bakewell	210	" And though it 's a gentleman that 's coming to you , Tom for he never refuses a poor body , "
15607	15651	15604	15605	Mrs. Bakewell	210	" it 's a true Christian , Tom ! and the Lord knows if the sight of him may n't be the saving of you , for he 's light to look on , and a sermon to listen to , he is ! "
15718	15787	15710	15710	Tom	199	" Take and tell young master up at the Abbey that I an't the chap to peach . He 'll know . He 's a young gentleman as'll make any man do as he wants 'em ! He 's a mortal wild young gentleman ! And I 'm a Ass ! That 's where ' tis . But I an't a blackguard . Tell him that , sir ! "
15897	15915	15893	15893	he	150	" Tom Bakewell told me to let you know he does not intend to peach on you , "
15936	15944	15946	15946	Richard	208	" He sha n't suffer for it , "
15958	15965	15967	15967	Ripton	158	" But will your cousin tell ? "
15971	15974	15967	15967	Ripton	158	" He ! "
15981	15998	15999	15999	Ripton	158	" A ploughman refuses to peach , and you ask if one of our family will ? "
16073	16078	16079	16079	Ripton	158	" Try your cousin , "
16098	16103	16104	16104	Ripton	158	" No , no ! "
16109	16112	16104	16104	Ripton	158	" Austin . "
16123	16133	16135	16135	he	208	" Let 's get the rope and file first , "
16351	16356	16358	16358	he	186	" My dear Ricky , "
16360	16404	16358	16358	he	186	" there are two ways of getting out of a scrape : a long way and a short way . When you 've tried the roundabout method , and failed , come to me , and I 'll show you the straight route . "
16777	16783	16785	16785	Adrian	346	" Boys are like monkeys , "
16794	16958	16785	16785	Adrian	346	" the gravest actors of farcical nonsense that the world possesses . May I never be where there are no boys ! A couple of boys left to themselves will furnish richer fun than any troop of trained comedians . No : no Art arrives at the artlessness of nature in matters of comedy . You ca n't simulate the ape . Your antics are dull . They have n't the charming inconsequence of the natural animal . Lack at these two ! Think of the shifts they are put to all day long ! They know I know all about it , and yet their serenity of innocence is all but unruffled in my presence . You 're sorry to think about the end of the business , Austin ? So am I ! I dread the idea of the curtain going down . Besides , it will do Ricky a world of good . A practical lesson is the best lesson . "
16959	16963	16965	16965	Austin	186	" Sinks deepest , "
16967	16983	16984	16984	Adrian	346	" but whether he learns good or evil from it is the question at stake . "
16991	17208	16984	16984	Adrian	346	" This will be his first nibble at experience , old Time 's fruit , hateful to the palate of youth ! for which season only hath it any nourishment ! Experience ! You know Coleridge 's capital simile ? Mournful you call it ? Well ! all wisdom is mournful . ' Tis therefore , coz , that the wise do love the Comic Muse . Their own high food would kill them . You shall find great poets , rare philosophers , night after night on the broad grin before a row of yellow lights and mouthing masks . Why ? Because all 's dark at home . The stage is the pastime of great minds . That 's how it comes that the stage is now down . An age of rampant little minds , my dear Austin ! How I hate that ca nt of yours about an Age of Work you , and your Mortons , and your parsons Brawnley , rank radicals all of you , base materialists ! What does Diaper Sandoe sing of your Age of Work ? Listen ! ' An Age of betty tit for tat , An Age of busy gabble : An Age that 's like a brewer 's vat , Fermenting for the rabble !
17319	17322	17298	17299	early wreck'd	1203	" Murmuring , "
17331	17358	17326	17326	Brawnley	212	" Adrian changed the resting - place of a leg , and smiled . The Age was an old battle - field between him and Austin . "
17372	17376	17359	17361	My parson Brawnley	1207	" said Austin , "
17423	17424	17415	17415	he	1207	" "
17433	17437	17425	17425	You	1205	" Adrian replied . "
17501	17505	17498	17499	the Impalpable	214	" Austin laughed . "
17559	17560	17563	17564	those boys	1215	" "
17566	17572	17563	17564	those boys	1215	" Adrian tossed a hand . "
17698	17735	17736	17736	You	1225	" Adrian always made a point of feeding the fretful beast Impatience with pleasantries a not congenial diet ; and Austin , the most patient of human beings , began to lose his self - control . "
17772	17773	17763	17764	The boy	703	" "
17783	17788	17781	17781	Austin	186	" yawned the epicurean . "
17804	17805	17801	17801	yours	1225	" "
17812	17817	17801	17801	yours	1225	" Adrian interjected languidly . "
17846	17847	17839	17839	I	0	" "
17866	17867	17868	17868	I	0	" "
17939	17940	17942	17942	you	0	" "
17949	17955	17942	17942	you	0	" said Austin , rising . "
17961	17968	17969	17969	I	0	" Adrian gesticulated an acquiesced withdrawal . "
18054	18133	18136	18136	Austin	186	" Austin cast an eye at the complacent languor of the wise youth , his cousin , and the little that he knew of his fellows told him he might talk forever here , and not be comprehended . The wise youth 's two ears were stuffed with his own wisdom . One evil only Adrian dreaded , it was clear the action of the law . As he was moving away , Adrian called out to him , "
18271	18302	18258	18258	I	0	" The wise youth yawned , and stretched out a hand for any book that might be within his reach . Austin left him to look about the grounds for Richard .
18390	18396	18397	18397	Austin	186	" Where 's your friend ? "
18400	18403	18397	18397	Austin	186	" Gone ! "
18633	18640	18642	18642	Austin	186	" So you 're left alone , "
18651	18671	18642	18642	Austin	186	" I 'm glad of it . We never know what 's in us till we stand by ourselves . "
18688	18695	18680	18680	Vanity	221	" He was n't much support . "
18696	18708	18642	18642	Austin	186	" Remember his good points now he 's gone , Ricky . "
18709	18716	18717	18718	the boy	703	" Oh ! he was staunch , "
18721	18748	18717	18718	the boy	703	" And a staunch friend is not always to be found . Now , have you tried your own way of rectifying this business , Ricky ? "
18749	18755	18642	18642	Austin	186	" I have done everything . "
18756	18760	18642	18642	Austin	186	" And failed ! "
18773	18780	18793	18793	his	186	" Tom Bakewell 's a coward ! "
18781	18788	18790	18790	Austin	186	" I suppose , poor fellow , "
18797	18818	18790	18790	Austin	186	" he does n't want to get into a deeper mess . I do n't think he 's a coward . "
18819	18825	18827	18827	Richard	186	" He is a coward , "
18829	18913	18827	18827	Richard	186	" Do you think if I had a file I would stay in prison ? I 'd be out the first night ! And he might have had the rope , too a rope thick enough for a couple of men his size and weight . Ripton and I and Ned Markham swung on it for an hour , and it did n't give way . He 's a coward , and deserves his fate . I 've no compassion for a coward . "
18914	18919	18921	18921	Austin	186	" Nor I much , "
18958	18966	18967	18967	Austin	186	" I never met a coward myself , "
18970	18988	18967	18967	Austin	186	" I have heard of one or two . One let an innocent man die for him . "
18989	18993	18995	18996	the boy	703	" How base ! "
18998	19005	18995	18996	the boy	703	" Yes , it was bad , "
19009	19012	19006	19006	Austin	186	" Bad ! "
19019	19032	19013	19013	Richard	186	" How I would have spurned him ! He was a coward ! "
19033	19105	18967	18967	Austin	186	" I believe he pleaded the feelings of his family in his excuse , and tried every means to get the man off . I have read also in the confessions of a celebrated philosopher , that in his youth he committed some act of pilfering , and accused a young servant - girl of his own theft , who was condemned and dismissed for it , pardoning her guilty accuser . "
19106	19111	19113	19113	Richard	186	" What a coward ! "
19115	19122	19113	19113	Richard	186	" And he confessed it publicly ? "
19123	19130	18967	18967	Austin	186	" You may read it yourself . "
19131	19142	18967	18967	Austin	186	" He actually wrote it down , and printed it ? "
19143	19161	19162	19162	Richard	186	" You have the book in your father 's library . Would you have done so much ? "
19177	19188	19190	19190	Austin	186	" Then who is to call that man a coward ? "
19192	19286	19190	19190	Austin	186	" He expiated his cowardice as all who give way in moments of weakness , and are not cowards , must do . The coward chooses to think ' God does not see . ' I shall escape . ' He who is not a coward , and has succumbed , knows that God has seen all , and it is not so hard a task for him to make his heart bare to the world . Worse , I should fancy it , to know myself an impostor when men praised me . "
19313	19340	19341	19341	Austin	186	" So I think you 're wrong , Ricky , in calling this poor Tom a coward because he refuses to try your means of escape , "
19344	19391	19341	19341	Austin	186	" A coward hardly objects to drag in his accomplice . And , where the person involved belongs to a great family , it seems to me that for a poor plough - lad to volunteer not to do so speaks him anything but a coward . "
19603	19613	19600	19600	he	127	" Tell me what I can do , Austin ? "
19639	19648	19629	19629	Austin	186	" You must go down to Farmer Blaize . "
19649	19652	19654	19654	Richard	186	" Well ! "
19663	19677	19654	19654	Richard	186	" You 'll know what to say to him when you 're there . "
19686	19701	19681	19681	his	703	" Ask a favour of that big brute , Austin ? I ca n't ! "
19702	19736	19654	19654	Richard	186	" Just tell him the whole case , and that you do n't intend to stand by and let the poor fellow suffer without a friend to help him out of his scrape . "
19737	19742	19743	19744	the boy	703	" But , Austin , "
19747	19771	19743	19744	the boy	703	" I shall have to ask him to help off Tom Bakewell ! How can I ask him , when I hate him ? "
19793	19801	19788	19788	Richard	186	" You 've no pride , Austin . "
19802	19806	19743	19744	the boy	703	" Perhaps not . "
19807	19825	19826	19826	Richard	186	" You do n't know what it is to ask a favour of a brute you hate . "
19853	19856	19858	19859	the boy	703	" Why , "
19861	19874	19858	19859	the boy	703	" I shall hardly be able to keep my fists off him ! "
19875	19885	19887	19887	Austin	186	" Surely you 've punished him enough , boy ? "
19889	19894	19887	19887	Austin	186	" He struck me ! "
19900	19956	19887	19887	Austin	186	" He dared not come at me with his hands . He struck me with a whip . He 'll be telling everybody that he horsewhipped me , and that I went down and begged his pardon . Begged his pardon ! A Feverel beg his pardon ! Oh , if I had my will ! "
19957	19983	19887	19887	Austin	186	" The man earns his bread , Ricky . You poached on his grounds . He turned you off , and you fired his rick . "
19984	20002	19887	19887	Austin	186	" And I 'll pay him for his loss . And I wo n't do any more . "
20003	20014	19887	19887	Austin	186	" Because you wo n't ask a favour of him ? "
20015	20027	20028	20028	Austin	186	" No ! I will not ask a favour of him . "
20035	20047	20028	20028	Austin	186	" You prefer to receive a favour from poor Tom Bakewell ? "
20073	20089	20064	20064	Dimly	223	" Favour from Tom Bakewell , the ploughman ? How do you mean , Austin ? "
20090	20117	20059	20059	Richard	186	" To save yourself an unpleasantness you permit a country lad to sacrifice himself for you ? I confess I should not have so much pride . "
20118	20121	20123	20123	Richard	186	" Pride ! "
20510	20515	20498	20498	Richard	186	" Behold your benefactor ! "
20573	20586	20565	20565	he	186	" I 'll go at once to old Blaize and tell him . "
21040	21047	21048	21049	the baronet	609	" I come to you direct , "
21052	21175	21048	21049	the baronet	609	" I tell you candidly what way I discovered my son to be mixed up in this miserable affair . I promise you indemnity for your loss , and an apology that shall , I trust , satisfy your feelings , assuring you that to tamper with witnesses is not the province of a Feverel . All I ask of you in return is , not to press the prosecution . At present it rests with you . I am bound to do all that lies in my power for this imprisoned man . How and wherefore my son was prompted to suggest , or assist in , such an act , I can not explain , for I do not know . "
21176	21179	21181	21182	the farmer	863	" Hum ! "
21184	21190	21181	21182	the farmer	863	" I think I do . "
21191	21197	21048	21049	the baronet	609	" You know the cause ? "
21202	21212	21198	21199	Sir Austin	186	" I beg you to confide it to me . "
21213	21227	21229	21230	the farmer	863	" ' Least , I can pretty nigh neighbour it with a gues , "
21232	21353	21229	21230	the farmer	863	" We an't good friends , Sir Austin , me and your son , just now not to say cordial . I , ye see , Sir Austin , I 'm a man as do n't like young gentlemen a - poachin ' on his grounds without his permission , in special when birds is plentiful on their own . It appear he do like it . Consequently I has to flick this whip as them fellers at the races : All in this ' ere Ring 's mine ! as much as to say ; and who 's been hit , he 's had fair warnin ' . I 'm sorry for't , but that 's just the case . "
21405	21413	21415	21415	he	186	" Money 's safe , I know , "
21417	21424	21415	21415	he	186	" now for the ' pology ! "
21626	21630	21631	21631	he	186	" Her father , "
21634	21678	21631	21631	he	186	" fought and fell for his coontry . A man as fights for 's coontry 's a right to hould up his head ay ! with any in the land . Desb'roughs o ' Dorset ! d'ye know that family , Master Feverel ? "
21704	21712	21713	21714	the farmer	863	" She can make puddens and pies , "
21725	21860	21713	21714	the farmer	863	" She 's a lady , as good as the best of 'em . I do n't care about their being Catholics the Desb'roughs o ' Dorset are gentlemen . And she 's good for the pianer , too ! She strums to me of evenin 's . I 'm for the old tunes : she 's for the new . Gal - like ! While she 's with me she shall be taught things use'l . She can parley - voo a good ' un and foot it , as it goes ; been in France a couple of year . I prefer the singin ' of ' t to the talkin ' of ' t. Come , Luce ! toon up eh ? Ye wun't ? That song abort the Viffendeer a female "
21869	21897	21861	21862	Farmer Blaize	167	" who wears the you guess what ! and marches along with the French sojers : a pretty brazen bit o ' goods , I sh'd fancy . "
21976	21979	21981	21982	the farmer	863	" Aha ! "
21987	22019	21981	21982	the farmer	863	" they soon learn the difference ' twixt the young ' un and the old ' un . Go along , Luce ! and learn yer lessons for to - morrow . "
22066	22140	22060	22061	Farmer Blaize	167	" She an't so fond of her uncle as that , every day ! Not that she an't a good nurse the kindest little soul you 'd meet of a winter 's walk ! She 'll read t ' ye , and make drinks , and sing , too , if ye likes it , and she wo n't be tired . A obstinate good ' un , she be ! Bless her ! "
22377	22402	22370	22370	he	226	" Mr. Blaize ! I have come to tell you that I am the person who set fire to your rick the other night . "
22421	22434	22413	22413	He	226	" Ay ? that 's what ye're come to tell me sir ? "
22435	22438	22440	22440	Richard	226	" Yes ! "
22444	22450	22413	22413	He	226	" And that be all ? "
22451	22454	22455	22455	Richard	226	" Yes ! "
22465	22479	22458	22459	The farmer	863	" Then , my lad , ye've come to tell me a lie ! "
22499	22508	22510	22510	Richard	226	" You dare to call me a liar ! "
22515	22519	22520	22521	the farmer	863	" I say , "
22533	22539	22520	22521	the farmer	863	" that 's a lie ! "
22547	22604	22540	22540	Richard	226	" You have twice insulted me . You have struck me : you have dared to call me a liar . I would have apologized I would have asked your pardon , to have got off that fellow in prison . Yes ! I would have degraded myself that another man should not suffer for my deed "
22605	22609	22611	22612	the farmer	863	" Quite proper ! "
22614	22645	22611	22612	the farmer	863	" And you take this opportunity of insulting me afresh . You 're a coward , sir ! nobody but a coward would have insulted me in his own house . "
22646	22658	22660	22661	the farmer	863	" Sit ye down , sit ye down , young master , "
22674	22792	22793	22793	Richard	226	" Sit ye down . Do n't ye be hasty . If ye had n't been hasty t'other day , we sh'd a been friends yet . Sit ye down , sir . I sh'd be sorry to reckon you out a liar , Mr. Feverel , or anybody o ' your name . I respects yer father though we 're opp'site politics . I 'm willin ' to think well o ' you . What I say is , that as you say an't the trewth . Mind ! I do n't like you none the worse for't . But it an't what is . That 's all ! You knows it as well 's I ! "
22844	22847	22849	22850	the farmer	863	" Come , "
22855	22863	22849	22850	the farmer	863	" what else have you to say ? "
22923	22943	22915	22916	The boy	703	" I came to say that I regretted the revenge I had taken on you for your striking me . "
22948	22957	22944	22945	Farmer Blaize	167	" And now ye've done , young gentleman ? "
22962	22970	22971	22971	Richard	186	" I should be very much obliged , "
23001	23006	23007	23007	he	186	" Very much obliged , "
23010	23021	23007	23007	he	186	" much obliged , if you would be so kind , "
23105	23109	23110	23110	he	186	" So kind , "
23116	23129	23110	23110	he	186	" fancy a Feverel asking this big brute to be so kind ! "
23136	23141	23110	23110	he	186	" me the favour ! "
23145	23152	23110	23110	he	186	" it 's all to please Austin "
23159	23179	23110	23110	he	186	" there 's no saying it ! The cup was full as ever . Richard dashed at it again . "
23199	23211	23110	23110	he	186	" what an infamous shame to have to beg like this ! "
23224	23312	23110	23110	he	186	" It seemed out of all human power to gulp it down . The draught grew more and more abhorrent . To proclaim one 's iniquity , to apologize for one 's wrongdoing ; thus much could be done ; but to beg a favour of the offended party that was beyond the self - abasement any Feverel could consent to . Pride , however , whose inevitable battle is against itself , drew aside the curtains of poor Tom 's prison , crying a second time , "
23317	23333	23110	23110	he	186	" and , with the words burning in his ears , Richard swallowed the dose : "
23363	23396	23351	23351	you	1394	" To do Farmer Blaize justice , he waited very patiently for the boy , though he could not quite see why he did not take the gate at the first offer . "
23399	23413	23351	23351	you	1394	" said he , when he heard and had pondered on the request . "
23440	23441	23434	23434	we	1397	" "
23448	23463	23444	23444	I	0	" Richard declared . The farmer 's half - amused expression sharpened a bit . "
23479	23480	23470	23470	you	6385	" "
23495	23496	23481	23481	I	0	" "
23499	23505	23481	23481	I	0	" said the farmer drily . "
23527	23537	23518	23518	I	0	" Farmer Blaize deflected his head twice in silence . "
23540	23545	23518	23518	I	0	" one motion expressed : "
23548	23552	23518	23518	I	0	" the other . "
23555	23581	23518	23518	I	0	" said he , leaning forward , and fixing his elbows on his knees , while he counted the case at his fingers ' ends , "
23616	23617	23609	23610	Sir Austin	186	" "
23625	23637	23609	23610	Sir Austin	186	" replied Richard . The farmer flung back in his chair . "
23642	23663	23609	23610	Sir Austin	186	" said his shoulders , soured by the British aversion to being plotted at , and not dealt with openly . "
23673	23674	23670	23671	young gentleman	6385	" "
23683	23684	23675	23675	I	0	" "
23691	23692	23686	23686	he	1400	" "
23697	23713	23694	23694	he	1400	" Richard had not the slightest intention of ever letting his father into his counsels . "
23723	23751	23694	23694	he	1400	" the farmer suggested . No consideration of the extent of damages , and the size of the sum , affected young Richard , who said boldly , "
23765	23809	23810	23810	Hum	224	" It was natural Farmer Blaize should be a trifle suspicious that a youth 's guarantee would hardly be given for his father 's readiness to disburse such a thumping bill , unless he had previously received his father 's sanction and authority . "
23812	23816	23810	23810	Hum	224	" said he , "
23825	23856	23857	23857	Hum	224	" The farmer threw an objectionable shrewdness into his query , that caused Richard to compress his mouth and glance high . Farmer Blaize was positive ' twas a lie . "
23868	23872	23863	23863	you	0	" he asked . "
23878	23892	23895	23895	na	1404	" quoth Richard , with the loftiness of a patriot of old Rome . "
23897	23905	23895	23895	na	1404	" the straightforward Briton put him aside . "
23922	23931	23932	23932	I	0	" Thrust in a corner , Richard said , "
23936	23991	23932	23932	I	0	" Farmer Blaize reached his hand to the bell . It was answered in an instant by little Lucy , who received orders to fetch in a dependent at Belthorpe going by the name of the Bantam , and made her exit as she had entered , with her eyes on the young stranger . "
23994	23999	23932	23932	I	0	" said the farmer , "
24179	24203	24133	24133	I	0	" added the farmer , as Miss Lucy ushered in the Bantam , who presented a curious figure for that rare divinity to enliven .
24683	24686	24688	24689	the farmer	863	" Now , "
24707	24724	24688	24689	the farmer	863	" tell this young gentleman what ye saw on the night of the fire , Bantam ! "
24804	24812	24801	24801	he	226	" T'm Baak'll wi 's owen hoies , "
24839	24854	24856	24857	the boy	703	" What do you mean ? Why are you making those faces at me ? "
24883	24892	24894	24896	the sulky elephant	1435	" Bain't makin ' no faces at nobody , "
24908	24914	24898	24899	The farmer	863	" A see T'm Baak'll , "
24951	24963	24964	24965	The Bantam	234	" You never saw Tom Bakewell set fire to that rick ! "
24974	24979	24981	24981	Richard	226	" I tell you , "
24983	24991	24981	24981	Richard	226	" I put the lucifers there myself ! "
25050	25060	25062	25063	the Bantam	234	" A thowt I see ' un , then , "
25081	25109	25075	25076	the farmer	863	" Thought ! Ye thought ! What d'ye mean ? Speak out , and do n't be thinkin ' . Thought ? What the devil 's that ? "
25110	25125	25126	25126	Richard	226	" How could he see who it was on a pitch - dark night ? "
25130	25133	25134	25135	the farmer	863	" Thought ! "
25139	25181	25134	25135	the farmer	863	" Thought Devil take ye , when ye took ye oath on't . Hulloa ! What are ye screwin ' yer eye at Mr. Feverel for ? I say , young gentleman , have you spoke to this chap before now ? "
25182	25185	25187	25187	Richard	226	" I ? "
25189	25197	25198	25199	Farmer Blaize	167	" I have not seen him before . "
25216	25219	25221	25221	he	863	" Come , "
25261	25274	25252	25252	Ye	234	" The farmer pointed at some musk - pots in the window . "
25321	25569	25313	25313	you	234	" Thus adjured , the Bantam hitched his breech . What on earth the young gentleman meant he was at a loss to speculate . He could not believe that the young gentleman wanted to be transported , but if he had been paid to help that , why , he would . And considering that this day 's evidence rather bound him down to the morrow 's , he determined , after much ploughing and harrowing through obstinate shocks of hair , to be not altogether positive as to the person . It is possible that he became thereby more a mansion of truth than he previously had been ; for the night , as he said , was so dark that you could not see your hand before your face ; and though , as he expressed it , you might be mortal sure of a man , you could not identify him upon oath , and the party he had taken for Tom Bakewell , and could have sworn to , might have been the young gentleman present , especially as he was ready to swear it upon oath . So ended the Bantam . No sooner had he ceased , than Farmer Blaize jumped up from his chair , and made a fine effort to lift him out of the room from the point of his toe . He failed , and sank back groaning with the pain of the exertion and disappointment . "
25577	25581	25572	25572	liars	1450	" he cried . "
25593	25603	25604	25604	You	1456	" to the Bantam , who was slinking away . "
25616	25617	25611	25611	You	1456	" "
25621	25628	25629	25629	You	1456	" said the Bantam , doggedly . "
25633	25691	25629	25629	You	1456	" the farmer vociferated afresh . The Bantam played a tune upon the handle of the door , and still affirmed that he did not ; a double contradiction at which the farmer absolutely raged in his chair , and was hoarse , as he called out a third time that the Bantam had sworn to it . "
25694	25703	25629	25629	You	1456	" said the Bantam , ducking his poll . "
25706	25734	25629	25629	You	1456	" he repeated in a lower note ; and then , while a sombre grin betokening idiotic enjoyment of his profound casuistical quibble worked at his jaw : "
25741	25830	25629	25629	You	1456	" he added , with a twitch of the shoulder and an angular jerk of the elbow . Farmer Blaize looked vacantly at Richard , as if to ask him what he thought of England 's peasantry after the sample they had there . Richard would have preferred not to laugh , but his dignity gave way to his sense of the ludicrous , and he let fly a shout . The farmer was in no laughing mood . He turned a wide eye back to the door , "
25834	25864	25629	25629	You	1456	" he exclaimed , seeing the Bantam had vanished , for his fingers itched to break that stubborn head . He grew very puffy , and addressed Richard solemnly : "
25928	25941	25922	25923	The Bantam	6405	" and he shivered his pipe with an energetic thump on the table "
25953	25954	25948	25948	I	0	" "
25958	25967	25948	25948	I	0	" Richard inquired , with a grave face . "
25973	25983	25984	25984	I	0	" said the farmer , not observing the impertinence . "
26138	26145	26127	26127	you	1467	" Richard stood up and replied , "
26152	26153	26149	26150	Mr. Blaize	218	" "
26157	26162	26163	26164	Tom Bakewell	199	" continued the farmer , "
26188	26189	26181	26181	I	0	" "
26207	26214	26200	26200	I	0	" said Richard , head erect . "
26219	26224	26200	26200	I	0	" the farmer responded . "
26281	26282	26266	26266	I	0	" "
26285	26297	26298	26298	you	1467	" cried Richard , with an astonishment hardly to be feigned , "
26304	26330	26298	26298	you	1467	" But Farmer Blaize had now such a scent for lies that he could detect them where they did not exist , and mumbled gruffly , "
26339	26377	26298	26298	you	1467	" The boy 's perplexity saved him from being irritated . Who could have told his father ? An old fear of his father came upon him , and a touch of an old inclination to revolt . "
26384	26403	26378	26379	My father	1400	" said he , very loudly , and staring , as he spoke , right through the farmer . "
26462	26463	26459	26459	him	186	" "
26474	26479	26467	26467	you	0	" said the farmer . "
26488	26511	26467	26467	you	0	" Richard did not see the analogy . He bowed stiffly and bade him good afternoon . Farmer Blaize pulled the bell . "
26520	26531	26518	26518	Lucy	233	" he waved to the little damsel in the doorway . "
26707	26757	26705	26705	sir	6036	" Richard marched hastily out of the room , and through the garden , never so much as deigning a glance at his wistful little guide , who hung at the garden gate to watch him up the lane , wondering a world of fancies about the handsome proud boy .
27049	27064	27065	27065	Underneath	243	" The Dog returneth to his vomit : the Liar must eat his Lie . "
27071	27077	27065	27065	Underneath	243	" The Devil 's mouthful ! "
27802	27811	27780	27780	Adrian	346	" Ripton and Richard were two pretty men , "
28112	28128	28129	28129	Adrian	346	" Expediency is man 's wisdom , Adrian Harley . Doing right is God 's . "
28163	28170	28172	28172	he	346	" I am to understand then , "
28174	28184	28172	28172	he	346	" that Blaize consents not to press the prosecution . "
28185	28192	28193	28193	Algernon	140	" Of course he wo n't , "
28196	28213	28193	28193	Algernon	140	" Confound him ! he 'll have his money , and what does he want besides ? "
28214	28231	28240	28241	the baronet	609	" These agricultural gentlemen are delicate customers to deal with . However , if he really consents "
28232	28238	28240	28241	the baronet	609	" I have his promise , "
28347	28355	28357	28357	Richard	141	" I think I saw him last , "
28372	28387	28366	28366	Adrian	346	" And left him with a distinct and satisfactory assurance of his amicable intentions ? "
28388	28391	28393	28393	Richard	141	" No , "
28395	28398	28393	28393	Richard	141	" Not ? "
28417	28420	28406	28406	Richard	141	" No . "
28421	28426	28428	28428	Adrian	346	" Was he hostile ? "
28437	28440	28441	28442	the boy	703	" Yes , "
28501	28510	28511	28511	he	150	" I thought it his duty to go , "
28514	28518	28520	28521	the baronet	609	" It was ! "
28525	28536	28520	28521	the baronet	609	" And you see what comes of it , sir , "
28541	28591	28537	28537	Adrian	346	" These agricultural gentlemen , I repeat , are delicate customers to deal with . For my part I would prefer being in the hands of a policeman . We are decidedly collared by Blaize . What were his words , Ricky ? Give it in his own Doric . "
28592	28601	28602	28602	Adrian	346	" He said he would transport Tom Bakewell . "

28799	28867	28788	28789	the baronet	609	" I for one am at a loss . I have heard that this man , Bakewell , chooses voluntarily not to inculpate my son . Seldom have I heard anything that so gratified me . It is a view of innate nobleness in the rustic 's character which many a gentleman might take example from . We are bound to do our utmost for the man . "

28978	29018	28975	28975	he	1585	" does one yeoman know another ! To elevate a distinction into a difference is the natural action of their minds . I will point that out to Blaize . He shall see that the idea is native born . "
29035	29044	29046	29046	he	346	" This trotting down to Belthorpe spoils all , "
29048	29073	29046	29046	he	346	" The affair would pass over to - morrow Blaize has no witnesses . The old rascal is only standing out for more money . "

29086	29109	29082	29082	Richard	186	" It 's not that . I 'm sure he believes his witnesses have been tampered with , as he calls it . "
29110	29118	29119	29119	Adrian	346	" What if they have , boy ? "
29124	29134	29119	29119	Adrian	346	" The ground is cut from under his feet . "
29135	29167	29082	29082	Richard	186	" Blaize told me that if my father would give his word there had been nothing of the sort , he would take it . My father will give his word . "
29168	29171	29173	29173	Adrian	346	" Then , "
29175	29185	29173	29173	Adrian	346	" you had better stop him from going down . "
29318	29325	29327	29327	Richard	186	" It 's I , sir , "
29330	29341	29327	29327	Richard	186	" Pardon me . You must n't go in there . "
29342	29346	29348	29349	the baronet	609	" Why not ? "
29357	29361	29363	29364	the boy	703	" Not now , "
29366	29437	29363	29364	the boy	703	" I will tell you all to - night . I must see the farmer myself . It was my fault , sir . I - I lied to him the Liar must eat his Lie . Oh , forgive me for disgracing you , sir . I did it I hope I did it to save Tom Bakewell . Let me go in alone , and speak the truth . "
29438	29449	29451	29452	his father	775	" Go , and I will wait for you here , "
29625	29654	29615	29615	he	775	" There is for the mind but one grasp of happiness : from that uppermost pinnacle of wisdom , whence we see that this world is well designed . "
29808	29817	29818	29818	he	158	" Why , it 's next to murder ! "
30394	31820	30388	30388	she	1636	" Dear Ripton , If Tom had been committed I would have shot old Blaize . Do you know my father was behind us that night when Clare saw the ghost and heard all we said before the fire burst out . It is no use trying to conceal anything from him . Well as you are in an awful state I will tell you all about it . After you left Ripton I had a conversation with Austin and he persuaded me to go down to old Blaize and ask him to help off Tom . I went for I would have done anything for Tom after what he said to Austin and I defied the old churl to do his worst . Then he said if my father paid the money and nobody had tampered with his witnesses he would not mind if Tom did get off and he had his chief witness in called the Bantam very like his master I think and the Bantam began winking at me tremendously as you say , and said he had sworn he saw Tom Bakewell but not upon oath . He meant not on the Bible . He could swear to it but not on the Bible . I burst out laughing and you should have seen the rage old Blaize was in . It was splendid fun . Then we had a consultation at home Austin Rady my father Uncle Algernon who has come down to us again and your friend in prosperity and adversity R.D.F. My father said he would go down to old Blaize and give him the word of a gentleman we had not tampered with his witnesses and when he was gone we were all talking and Rady says he must not see the farmer . I am as certain as I live that it was Rady bribed the Bantam . Well I ran and caught up my father and told him not to go in to old Blaize but I would and eat my words and tell him the truth . He waited for me in the lane . Never mind what passed between me and old Blaize . He made me beg and pray of him not to press it against Tom and then to complete it he brought in a little girl a niece of his and says to me , she 's your best friend after all and told me to thank her . A little girl twelve years of age . What business had she to mix herself up in my matters . Depend upon it Ripton , wherever there is mischief there are girls I think . She had the insolence to notice my face , and ask me not to be unhappy . I was polite of course but I would not look at her . Well the morning came and Tom was had up before Sir Miles Papworth . It was Sir Miles gout gave us the time or Tom would have been had up before we could do anything . Adrian did not want me to go but my father said I should accompany him and held my hand all the time . I shall be careful about getting into these scrapes again . When you have done anything honourable you do not mind but getting among policemen and magistrates makes you ashamed of yourself . Sir Miles was very attentive to my father and me and dead against Tom . We sat beside him and Tom was brought in , Sir Miles told my father that if there was one thing that showed a low villain it was rick - burning . What do you think of that . I looked him straight in the face and he said to me he was doing me a service in getting Tom committed and clearing the country of such fellows and Rady began laughing . I hate Rady . My father said his son was not in haste to inherit and have estates of his own to watch and Sir Miles laughed too . I thought we were discovered at first . Then they began the examination of Tom . The Tinker was the first witness and he proved that Tom had spoken against old Blaize and said something about burning his rick . I wished I had stood in the lane to Bursley with him alone . Our country lawyer we engaged for Tom cross - questioned him and then he said he was not ready to swear to the exact words that had passed between him and Tom . I should think not . Then came another who swore he had seen Tom lurking about the farmer 's grounds that night . Then came the Bantam and I saw him look at Rady . I was tremendously excited and my father kept pressing my hand . Just fancy my being brought to feel that a word from that fellow would make me miserable for life and he must perjure himself to help me . That comes of giving way to passion . My father says when we do that we are calling in the devil as doctor . Well the Bantam was told to state what he had seen and the moment he began Rady who was close by me began to shake and he was laughing I knew though his face was as grave as Sir Miles . You never heard such a rigmarole but I could not laugh . He said he thought he was certain he had seen somebody by the rick and it was Tom Bakewell who was the only man he knew who had a grudge against Farmer Blaize and if the object had been a little bigger he would not mind swearing to Tom and would swear to him for he was dead certain it was Tom only what he saw looked smaller and it was pitch - dark at the time . He was asked what time it was he saw the person steal away from the rick and then he began to scratch his head and said supper - time . Then they asked what time he had supper and he said nine o'clock by the clock and we proved that at nine o'clock Tom was drinking in the ale - house with the Tinker at Bursley and Sir Miles swore and said he was afraid he could not commit Tom and when he heard that Tom looked up at me and I say he is a noble fellow and no one shall sneer at Tom while I live . Mind that . Well Sir Miles asked us to dine with him and Tom was safe and I am to have him and educate him if I like for my servant and I will . And I will give money to his mother and make her rich and he shall never repent he knew me . I say Rip . The Bantam must have seen me . It was when I went to stick in the lucifers . As we were all going home from Sir Miles 's at night he has lots of red - faced daughters but I did not dance with them though they had music and were full of fun and I did not care to I was so delighted and almost let it out . When we left and rode home Rady said to my father the Bantam was not such a fool as he was thought and my father said one must be in a state of great personal exaltation to apply that epithet to any man and Rady shut his mouth and I gave my pony a clap of the heel for joy . I think my father suspects what Rady did and does not approve of it . And he need not have done it after all and might have spoilt it . I have been obliged to order him not to call me Ricky for he stops short at Rick so that everybody knows what he means . My dear Austin is going to South America . My pony is in capital condition . My father is the cleverest and best man in the world . Clare is a little better . I am quite happy . I hope we shall meet soon my dear Old Rip and we will not get into any more tremendous scrapes will we . I remain , "
31825	31830	30388	30388	she	1636	" RICHARD DORIA FEVEREL . "
31831	31872	30388	30388	she	1636	" P.S. I am to have a nice River Yacht . Good - bye , Rip . Mind you learn to box . Mind you are not to show this to any of your friends on pain of my displeasure . "
31919	32000	31916	31917	old Rip	188	" Poor little Letitia , after three perusals of this ingenuous epistle , where the laws of punctuation were so disregarded , resigned it to one of the pockets of her brother Ripton 's best jacket , deeply smitten with the careless composer . And so ended the last act of the Bakewell Comedy , in which the curtain closes with Sir Austin 's pointing out to his friends the beneficial action of the System in it from beginning to end .
32409	32421	32422	32423	Mrs. Doria	138	" Let this be her penance , not inflicted by me ! "
33024	33051	33052	33052	He	186	" Between Simple Boyhood and Adolescence The Blossoming Season on the threshold of Puberty , there is one Unselfish Hour say , Spiritual Seed - time . "
33095	33107	33108	33108	he	186	" I am only striving to make my son a Christian , "
33130	33135	33136	33136	he	186	" First be virtuous , "
33141	33152	33136	33136	he	186	" and then serve your country with heart and soul . "
33345	33352	33353	33353	he	703	" How is it , sir , "
33358	33368	33353	33353	he	703	" I ca n't get Tom Bakewell to pray ? "
33369	33374	33375	33376	Sir Austin	186	" Does he refuse ? "
33379	33387	33388	33388	Richard	186	" He seems to be ashamed to , "
33391	33411	33388	33388	Richard	186	" He wants to know what is the good ? and I do n't know what to tell him . "
33412	33424	33426	33427	Sir Austin	186	" I 'm afraid it has gone too far with him , "
33429	33522	33426	33427	Sir Austin	186	" and until he has had some deep sorrows he will not find the divine want of Prayer . Strive , my son , when you represent the people , to provide for their education . He feels everything now through a dull impenetrable rind . Culture is half - way to heaven . Tell him , my son , should he ever be brought to ask how he may know the efficacy of Prayer , and that his prayer will be answered , tell him he quoted The Pilgrim 's Scrip : "
33538	33539	33540	33540	I	0	" "
33545	33876	33540	33540	I	0	" said Richard , and went to sleep happy . Happy in his father and in himself , the youth now lived . Conscience was beginning to inhabit him , and he carried some of the freightage known to men ; though in so crude a form that it overweighed him , now on this side , now on that . The wise youth Adrian observed these further progressionary developments in his pupil , soberly cynical . He was under Sir Austin 's interdict not to banter him , and eased his acrid humours inspired by the sight of a felonious young rick - burner turning saint , by grave affectations of sympathy and extreme accuracy in marking the not widely - distant dates of his various changes . The Bread - and - water phase lasted a fortnight : the Vegetarian an imitation of his cousin Austin , little better than a month : the religious , somewhat longer : the religious - propagandist when he was for converting the heathen of Lobourne and Burnley , and the domestics of the Abbey , including Tom Bakewell , longer still , and hard to bear ; he tried to convert Adrian ! All the while Tom was being exercised like a raw recruit . Richard had a drill - sergeant from the nearest barracks down for him , to give him a proper pride in himself , and marched him to and fro with immense satisfaction , and nearly broke his heart trying to get the round - shouldered rustic to take in the rudiments of letters : for the boy had unbounded hopes for Tom , as a hero in grain . Richard 's pride also was cast aside . He affected to be , and really thought he was , humble . Whereupon Adrian , as by accident , imparted to him the fact that men were animals , and he an animal with the rest of them . "
33881	34009	33540	33540	I	0	" cries Richard in scorn , and for weeks he was as troubled by this rudiment of self - knowledge as Tom by his letters . Sir Austin had him instructed in the wonders of anatomy , to restore his self - respect . Seed - Time passed thus smoothly , and adolescence came on , and his cousin Clare felt what it was to be of an opposite sex to him . She too was growing , but nobody cared how she grew . Outwardly even her mother seemed absorbed in the sprouting of the green off - shoot of the Feverel tree , and Clare was his handmaiden , little marked by him . Lady Blandish honestly loved the boy . She would tell him : "
34026	34038	34017	34017	I	0	" And he with the frankness of his years would reply : "
34050	34086	34042	34042	you	0	" causing her to laugh and call him a silly boy , for had he not heard her say she would have had him ? Terrible words , he knew not then the meaning of ! "
34096	34170	34087	34087	You	809	" she said . Her own copy was bound in purple velvet , gilt - edged , as decorative ladies like to have holier books , and she carried it about with her , and quoted it , and Adrian remarked to Mrs. Doria hunted a noble quarry , and deliberately aimed at him therewith , which Mrs. Doria chose to believe , and regretted her brother would not be on his guard . "
34174	34217	34087	34087	You	809	" said Lady Blandish , pressing an almondy finger - nail to one of the Aphorisms , which instanced how age and adversity must clay - enclose us ere we can effectually resist the magnetism of any human creature in our path . "
34225	34236	34219	34219	you	809	" Richard informed her that when she read he could . "
34244	34257	34241	34242	my squire	1706	" she touched his cheek and ran her fingers through his hair , "
34290	34291	34283	34285	a wise man	1421	" "
34298	34302	34283	34285	a wise man	1421	" Richard asked . "
34307	34315	34303	34303	I	0	" the lady emphasized her individual judgment . "
34318	34333	34317	34317	you	0	" Richard broke forth , and was stopped by a beating of his heart . "
34338	34343	34344	34344	I	0	" she calmly queried . "
34361	35828	34351	34351	you	1706	" Lady Blandish smiled and slightly coloured . They frequently approached this theme , and always retreated from it ; always with the same beating of heart to Richard , accompanied by the sense of a growing mystery , which , however , did not as yet generally disturb him . Life was made very pleasant to him at Raynham , as it was part of Sir Austin 's principle of education that his boy should be thoroughly joyous and happy ; and whenever Adrian sent in a satisfactory report of his pupil 's advancement , which he did pretty liberally , diversions were planned , just as prizes are given to diligent school - boys , and Richard was supposed to have all his desires gratified while he attended to his studies . The System flourished . Tall , strong , bloomingly healthy , he took the lead of his companions on land and water , and had more than one bondsman in his service besides Ripton Thompson the boy without a Destiny ! Perhaps the boy with a Destiny was growing up a trifle too conscious of it . His generosity to his occasional companions was princely , but was exercised something too much in the manner of a prince ; and , notwithstanding his contempt for baseness , he would overlook that more easily than an offence to his pride , which demanded an utter servility when it had once been rendered susceptible . If Richard had his followers he had also his feuds . The Papworths were as subservient as Ripton , but young Ralph Morton , the nephew of Mr. Morton , and a match for Richard in numerous promising qualities , comprising the noble science of fisticuffs , this youth spoke his mind too openly , and moreover would not be snubbed . There was no middle course for Richard 's comrades between high friendship or absolute slavery . He was deficient in those cosmopolite habits and feelings which enable boys and men to hold together without caring much for each other ; and , like every insulated mortal , he attributed the deficiency , of which he was quite aware , to the fact of his possessing a superior nature . Young Ralph was a lively talker : therefore , argued Richard 's vanity , he had no intellect . He was affable : therefore he was frivolous . The women liked him : therefore he was a butterfly . In fine , young Ralph was popular , and our superb prince , denied the privilege of despising , ended by detesting him . Early in the days of their contention for leadership , Richard saw the absurdity of affecting to scorn his rival . Ralph was an Eton boy , and hence , being robust , a swimmer and a cricketer . A swimmer and a cricketer is nowhere to be scorned in youth 's republic . Finding that manoeuvre would not do , Richard was prompted once or twice to entrench himself behind his greater wealth and his position ; but he soon abandoned that also , partly because his chilliness to ridicule told him he was exposing himself , and chiefly that his heart was too chivalrous . And so he was dragged into the lists by Ralph , and experienced the luck of champions . For cricket , and for diving , Ralph bore away the belt : Richard 's middle - stump tottered before his ball , and he could seldom pick up more than three eggs underwater to Ralph 's half - dozen . He was beaten , too , in jumping and running . Why will silly mortals strive to the painful pinnacles of championship ? Or why , once having reached them , not have the magnanimity and circumspection to retire into private life immediately ? Stung by his defeats , Richard sent one of his dependent Papworths to Poer Hall , with a challenge to Ralph Barthrop Morton ; matching himself to swim across the Thames and back , once , trice , or thrice , within a less time than he , Ralph Barthrop Morton , would require for the undertaking . It was accepted , and a reply returned , equally formal in the trumpeting of Christian names , wherein Ralph Barthrop Morton acknowledged the challenge of Richard Doria Feverel , and was his man . The match came off on a midsummer morning , under the direction of Captain Algernon . Sir Austin was a spectator from the cover of a plantation by the river - side , unknown to his son , and , to the scandal of her sex , Lady Blandish accompanied the baronet . He had invited her attendance , and she , obeying her frank nature , and knowing what The Pilgrim 's Scrip said about prudes , at once agreed to view the match , pleasing him mightily . For was not here a woman worthy the Golden Ages of the world ? one who could look upon man as a creature divinely made , and look with a mind neither tempted , nor taunted , by the Serpent ! Such a woman was rare . Sir Austin did not discompose her by uttering his praises . She was conscious of his approval only in an increased gentleness of manner , and something in his voice and communications , as if he were speaking to a familiar , a very high compliment from him . While the lads were standing ready for the signal to plunge from the steep decline of greensward into the shining waters , Sir Austin called upon her to admire their beauty , and she did , and even advanced her head above his shoulder delicately . In so doing , and just as the start was given , a bonnet became visible to Richard . Young Ralph was heels in air before he moved , and then he dropped like lead . He was beaten by several lengths . The result of the match was unaccountable to all present , and Richard 's friends unanimously pressed him to plead a false start . But though the youth , with full confidence in his better style and equal strength , had backed himself heavily against his rival , and had lost his little river - yacht to Ralph , he would do nothing of the sort . It was the Bonnet had beaten him , not Ralph . The Bonnet , typical of the mystery that caused his heart those violent palpitations , was his dear , detestable enemy . And now , as he progressed from mood to mood , his ambition turned towards a field where Ralph could not rival him , and where the Bonnet was etherealized , and reigned glorious mistress . A cheek to the pride of a boy will frequently divert him to the path where lie his subtlest powers . Richard gave up his companions , servile or antagonistic : he relinquished the material world to young Ralph , and retired into himself , where he was growing to be lord of kingdoms where Beauty was his handmaid , and History his minister and Time his ancient harper , and sweet Romance his bride ; where he walked in a realm vaster and more gorgeous than the great Orient , peopled with the heroes that have been . For there is no princely wealth , and no loftiest heritage , to equal this early one that is made bountifully common to so many , when the ripening blood has put a spark to the imagination , and the earth is seen through rosy mists of a thousand fresh - awakened nameless and aimless desires ; panting for bliss and taking it as it comes ; making of any sight or sound , perforce of the enchantment they carry with them , a key to infinite , because innocent , pleasure . The passions then are gambolling cubs ; not the ravaging gluttons they grow to . They have their teeth and their talons , but they neither tear nor bite . They are in counsel and fellowship with the quickened heart and brain . The whole sweet system moves to music . Something akin to the indications of a change in the spirit of his son , which were now seen , Sir Austin had marked down to be expected , as due to his plan . The blushes of the youth , his long vigils , his clinging to solitude , his abstraction , and downcast but not melancholy air , were matters for rejoicing to the prescient gentleman . "
35833	35858	34351	34351	you	1706	" said he to Dr. Clifford of Lobourne , after consulting him medically on the youth 's behalf and being assured of his soundness , "
36018	36034	36035	36036	my boy	1718	" and the baronet dropped his voice to a key that was touching to hear , "
36082	36203	36204	36204	We	1722	" To talk nonsense , or poetry , or the dash between the two , in a tone of profound sincerity , and to enunciate solemn discordances with received opinion so seriously as to convey the impression of a spiritual insight , is the peculiar gift by which monomaniacs , having first persuaded themselves , contrive to influence their neighbours , and through them to make conquest of a good half of the world , for good or for ill . Sir Austin had this gift . He spoke as if he saw the truth , and , persisting in it so long , he was accredited by those who did not understand him , and silenced them that did . "
36208	36353	36204	36204	We	1722	" was all the argument left to Dr. Clifford , and other unbelievers . So far certainly the experiment had succeeded . A comelier , bracer , better boy was nowhere to be met . His promise was undeniable . The vessel , too , though it lay now in harbour and had not yet been proved by the buffets of the elements on the great ocean , had made a good trial trip , and got well through stormy weather , as the records of the Bakewell Comedy witnessed to at Raynham . No augury could be hopefuller . The Fates must indeed be hard , the Ordeal severe , the Destiny dark , that could destroy so bright a Spring ! But , bright as it was , the baronet relaxed nothing of his vigilant supervision . He said to his intimates : "
36385	36581	36590	36590	you	1723	" And , acting up to his light , Sir Austin did watch . The youth submitted to an examination every night before he sought his bed ; professedly to give an account of his studies , but really to recapitulate his moral experiences of the day . He could do so , for he was pure . Any wildness in him that his father noted , any remoteness or richness of fancy in his expressions , was set down as incidental to the Blossoming Season . There is nothing like a theory for binding the wise . Sir Austin , despite his rigid watch and ward , knew less of his son than the servant of his household . And he was deaf , as well as blind . Adrian thought it his duty to tell him that the youth was consuming paper . Lady Blandish likewise hinted at his mooning propensities . Sir Austin from his lofty watch - tower of the System had foreseen it , he said . But when he came to hear that the youth was writing poetry , his wounded heart had its reasons for being much disturbed . "
36584	36589	36590	36590	you	1723	" said Lady Blandish , "
36595	36596	36592	36592	he	1724	" "
36605	36610	36592	36592	he	1724	" said the baronet . "
36618	36619	36620	36620	I	0	" "
36631	36636	36637	36637	He	1724	" the lady remarked . "
36644	36761	36637	36637	He	1724	" A London phrenologist , and a friendly Oxford Professor of poetry , quieted Sir Austin 's fears . The phrenologist said he was totally deficient in the imitative faculty ; and the Professor , that he was equally so in the rhythmic , and instanced several consoling false quantities in the few effusions submitted to him . Added to this , Sir Austin told Lady Blandish that Richard had , at his best , done what no poet had ever been known to be capable of doing : he had , with his own hands , and in cold blood , committed his virgin manuscript to the flames : which made Lady Blandish sigh forth , "
36765	37046	36762	36763	Poor boy	831	" Killing one 's darling child is a painful imposition . For a youth in his Blossoming Season , who fancies himself a poet , to be requested to destroy his first - born , without a reason though to pretend a reason cogent enough to justify the request were a mockery , is a piece of abhorrent despotism , and Richard 's blossoms withered under it . A strange man had been introduced to him , who traversed and bisected his skull with sagacious stiff fingers , and crushed his soul while , in an infallible voice , declaring him the animal he was making him feel such an animal ! Not only his blossoms withered , his being seemed to draw in its shoots and twigs . And when , coupled thereunto the strange man having departed , his work done , his father , in his tenderest manner , stated that it would give him pleasure to see those same precocious , utterly valueless , scribblings among the cinders , the last remaining mental blossoms spontaneously fell away . Richard 's spirit stood bare . He protested not . Enough that it could be wished ! He would not delay a minute in doing it . Desiring his father to follow him , he went to a drawer in his room , and from a clean - linen recess , never suspected by Sir Austin , the secretive youth drew out bundle after bundle : each neatly tied , named , and numbered : and pitched them into flames . And so Farewell my young Ambition ! and with it farewell all true confidence between Father and Son .

37328	37334	37335	37335	he	186	" I do not object , "
37338	37363	37335	37335	he	186	" I hope I am too just to object to the exercise of their natural inclinations . All I ask from them is discreetness . "
37364	37367	37369	37369	Adrian	260	" Ay , "
37377	37384	37386	37387	the baronet	609	" No gadding about in couples , "
37389	37451	37386	37387	the baronet	609	" no kissing in public . Such occurrences no boy should witness . Whenever people of both sexes are thrown together , they will be silly ; and where they are high - fed , uneducated , and barely occupied , it must be looked for as a matter of course . Let it be known that I only require discreetness . "
37537	37542	37544	37545	Mrs. Doria	138	" Really , Austin ! "
37559	37568	37544	37545	Mrs. Doria	138	" I have never allowed him to hope . "
37569	37577	37579	37580	the baronet	609	" Let him see it , then , "
37582	37588	37579	37580	the baronet	609	" let him see it . "
37589	37595	37597	37598	Mrs. Doria	138	" The man amuses me , "
37600	37660	37597	37598	Mrs. Doria	138	" You know , we have few amusements here , we inferior creatures . I confess I should like a barrel - organ better ; that reminds one of town and the opera ; and besides , it plays more than one tune . However , since you think my society bad for him , let him stop away . "
38046	38049	38051	38052	Sir Austin	186	" That , "
38054	38085	38051	38052	Sir Austin	186	" depends . A year , perhaps . He is entering on it . I shall be most grieved to lose you , Helen . Clare is now how old ? "
38086	38089	38031	38032	Mrs. Doria	138	" Seventeen . "
38090	38095	38051	38052	Sir Austin	186	" She is marriageable . "
38096	38121	38051	38052	Sir Austin	186	" Marriageable , Austin ! at seventeen ! do n't name such a thing . My child shall not be robbed of her youth . "
38122	38130	38031	38032	Mrs. Doria	138	" Our women marry early , Helen . "
38131	38137	38138	38139	The baronet	609	" My child shall not ! "
38153	38163	38165	38165	he	609	" As you are of that opinion , Helen , "
38167	38200	38165	38165	he	609	" perhaps we may still make arrangements to retain you with us . Would you think it advisable to send Clare she should know discipline to some establishment for a few months ? "
38201	38208	38210	38211	Mrs. Doria	138	" To an asylum , Austin ? "
38222	38238	38210	38211	Mrs. Doria	138	" To some select superior seminary , Helen . There are such to be found . "
38239	38242	38243	38244	Mrs. Doria	138	" Austin ! "
38258	38263	38264	38264	she	138	" Unjust ! absurd ! "
38284	38292	38293	38294	Mrs. Doria	138	" I can not leave my child . "
38297	38349	38293	38294	Mrs. Doria	138	" Where she goes , I go . I am aware that she is only one of our sex , and therefore of no value to the world , but she is my child . I will see , poor dear , that you have no cause to complain of her . "
38350	38354	38355	38356	Sir Austin	186	" I thought , "
38359	38372	38355	38356	Sir Austin	186	" that you acquiesced in my views with regard to my son . "
38373	38377	38379	38380	Mrs. Doria	138	" Yes generally , "
38661	38674	38657	38657	Tom	199	" He do ride like fire every day to Pig 's Snout , "
38683	38718	38657	38657	Tom	199	" and stand there and stare , never movin ' , like a mad ' un . And then hoam agin all slack as if he 'd been beaten in a race by somebody . "
38719	38727	38729	38730	the baronet	609	" There is no woman in that ! "
38732	38744	38746	38749	this profound scientific humanist	1793	" He would have ridden back as hard as he went , "
38751	38803	38746	38749	this profound scientific humanist	1793	" had there been a woman in it . He would shun vast expanses , and seek shade , concealment , solitude . The desire for distances betokens emptiness and undirected hunger : when the heart is possessed by an image we fly to wood and forest , like the guilty . "
38817	38820	38822	38823	the baronet	609	" Exactly , "
38825	38959	38822	38823	the baronet	609	" As I foresaw . At this period an insatiate appetite is accompanied by a fastidious palate . Nothing but the quintessences of existence , and those in exhaustless supplies , will satisfy this craving , which is not to be satisfied ! Hence his bitterness . Life can furnish no food fitting for him . The strength and purity of his energies have reached to an almost divine height , and roam through the Inane . Poetry , love , and such - like , are the drugs earth has to offer to high natures , as she offers to low ones debauchery . ' Tis a sign , this sourness , that he is subject to none of the empiricisms that are afloat . Now to keep him clear of them ! "
39032	39035	39037	39038	Lady Blandish	489	" Oh ! "
39043	39072	39037	39038	Lady Blandish	489	" if men could give their hands to women unsoiled how different would many a marriage be ! She will be a happy girl who calls Richard husband . "
39073	39078	39080	39081	the baronet	609	" Happy , indeed ! "
39086	39101	39037	39038	Lady Blandish	489	" But where shall I meet one equal to him , and his match ? "
39102	39112	39114	39115	the lady	990	" I was innocent when I was a girl , "
39124	39132	39117	39118	Sir Austin	186	" Do you think no girls innocent ? "
39141	39151	39153	39154	the lady	990	" No , that you know they are not , "
39158	39171	39153	39154	the lady	990	" But they are more innocent than boys , I am sure . "
39172	39222	39153	39154	the lady	990	" Because of their education , madam . You see now what a youth can be . Perhaps , when my System is published , or rather to speak more humbly when it is practised , the balance may be restored , and we shall have virtuous young men . "
39223	39241	39243	39244	the lady	990	" It 's too late for poor me to hope for a husband from one of them , "
39250	39262	39264	39265	the baronet	609	" It is never too late for beauty to waken love , "
39313	39323	39324	39324	she	990	" I shall believe again in Arthur 's knights , "
39327	39338	39324	39324	she	990	" When I was a girl I dreamed of one . "
39339	39350	39387	39388	the lady	990	" And he was in quest of the San Greal ? "
39351	39356	39297	39298	The baronet	609	" If you like . "
39357	39373	39324	39324	she	990	" And showed his good taste by turning aside for the more tangible San Blandish ? "
39374	39385	39387	39388	the lady	990	" Of course you consider it would have been so , "
39392	39401	39403	39404	Sir Austin	186	" I can only judge by our generation , "
39418	39430	39412	39413	The lady	990	" Either we are very mighty or you are very weak . "
39431	39436	39324	39324	she	990	" Both , madam . "
39437	39497	39412	39413	The lady	990	" But whatever we are , and if we are bad , bad ! we love virtue , and truth , and lofty souls , in men : and , when we meet those qualities in them , we are constant , and would die for them die for them . Ah ! you know men but not women . "
39498	39511	39513	39514	Sir Austin	186	" The knights possessing such distinctions must be young , I presume ? "
39516	39522	39513	39514	Sir Austin	186	" Old , or young ! "
39523	39535	39412	39413	The lady	990	" But if old , they are scarce capable of enterprise ? "
39536	39548	39412	39413	The lady	990	" They are loved for themselves , not for their deeds . "
39549	39552	39513	39514	Sir Austin	186	" Ah ! "
39553	39557	39559	39560	the lady	990	" Yes ah ! "
39562	39599	39559	39560	the lady	990	" Intellect may subdue women make slaves of them ; and they worship beauty perhaps as much as you do . But they only love for ever and are mated when they meet a noble nature . "
39607	39618	39600	39601	Sir Austin	186	" And did you encounter the knight of your dream ? "
39619	39623	39624	39624	She	990	" Not then . "
39634	39643	39624	39624	She	990	" And how did you bear the disappointment ? "
39644	39694	39600	39601	Sir Austin	186	" My dream was in the nursery . The day my frock was lengthened to a gown I stood at the altar . I am not the only girl that has been made a woman in a day , and given to an ogre instead of a true knight . "
39695	39699	39701	39702	Sir Austin	186	" Good God ! "
39704	39711	39701	39702	Sir Austin	186	" women have much to bear . "
39728	39736	39737	39737	she	990	" You know it is our lot , "
39740	39779	39737	39737	she	990	" And we are allowed many amusements . If we fulfil our duty in producing children , that , like our virtue , is its own reward . Then , as a widow , I have wonderful privileges . "
39780	39790	39701	39702	Sir Austin	186	" To preserve which , you remain a widow ? "
39791	39794	39795	39795	she	990	" Certainly , "
39798	39849	39795	39795	she	990	" I have no trouble now in patching and piecing that rag the world calls a character . I can sit at your feet every day unquestioned . To be sure , others do the same , but they are female eccentrics , and have cast off the rag altogether . "
39857	39868	39850	39851	Sir Austin	186	" You would have made an admirable mother , madam . "
39879	39883	39884	39884	he	186	" It is , "
39887	39897	39884	39884	he	186	" ten thousand pities that you are not one . "
39898	39904	39905	39905	She	990	" Do you think so ? "
39910	39914	39915	39915	he	186	" I would , "
39919	39928	39915	39915	he	186	" that heaven had given you a daughter . "
39929	39939	39884	39884	he	186	" Would you have thought her worthy of Richard ? "
39940	39951	39952	39953	The lady	990	" Our blood , madam , should have been one ! "
39961	39968	39969	39969	she	990	" But I am a mother , "
39972	39985	39986	39986	she	990	" Richard is my son . Yes ! Richard is my boy , "
39995	40002	40005	40005	his	186	" Call him ours , madam , "
40047	40085	40043	40044	Sir Austin	186	" As you will not say ' ours , ' let me . And , as you have therefore an equal claim on the boy , I will confide to you a project I have lately conceived . "
40260	40264	40266	40267	Lady Blandish	489	" I fear , "
40277	40295	40266	40267	Lady Blandish	489	" you have laid down for yourself a difficult task . You must not be too exacting . "
40296	40301	40302	40303	The baronet	609	" I know it . "
40312	40417	40302	40303	The baronet	609	" Even in England she will be rare . But I confine myself to no class . If I ask for blood it is for untainted , not what you call high blood . I believe many of the middle classes are frequently more careful more pure - blooded than our aristocracy . Show me among them a God - fearing family who educate their children I should prefer a girl without brothers and sisters as a Christian damsel should be educated say , on the model of my son , and she may be penniless , I will pledge her to Richard Feverel . "
40424	40440	40421	40421	her	489	" And what do you do with Richard while you are absent on this expedition ? "
40441	40444	40446	40447	the baronet	609	" Oh ! "
40449	40455	40446	40447	the baronet	609	" he accompanies his father . "
40456	40527	40421	40421	her	489	" Then give it up . His future bride is now pinafored and bread - and - buttery . She romps , she cries , she dreams of play and pudding . How can he care for her ? He thinks more at his age of old women like me . He will be certain to kick against her , and destroy your plan , believe me , Sir Austin . "
40528	40538	40540	40541	the baronet	609	" Ay ? ay ? do you think that ? "
40552	40557	40558	40558	he	609	" Ay ! true , "
40561	40593	40558	40558	he	609	" Adrian said the same . He must not see her . How could I think of it ! The child is naked woman . He would despise her . Naturally ! "
40594	40597	40599	40600	the lady	990	" Naturally ! "
40602	40607	40609	40610	the baronet	609	" Then , madam , "
40613	40638	40609	40610	the baronet	609	" there is one thing for me to determine upon . I must , for the first time in his life , leave him . "
40639	40645	40647	40648	the lady	990	" Will you , indeed ? "
40650	40727	40647	40648	the lady	990	" It is my duty , having thus brought him up , to see that he is properly mated , not wrecked upon the quicksands of marriage , as a youth so delicately trained might be ; more easily than another ! Betrothed , he will be safe from a thousand snares . I may , I think , leave him for a term . My precautions have saved him from the temptations of his season . "
40728	40738	40739	40740	Lady Blandish	489	" And under whose charge will you leave him ? "
40766	40769	40770	40770	he	186	" Madam ! "
40783	40789	40770	40770	he	186	" under whose but yours ? "
41297	41308	41309	41310	Sir Austin	186	" Have I not sworn I would never write again ? "
41929	41942	41901	41901	Ralph	262	" I say , what woman 's name do you like best ? "
41943	41950	41901	41901	Ralph	262	" I do n't know any , "
41956	41964	41901	41901	Ralph	262	" Why are you out so early ? "
42020	42026	42028	42028	Ralph	262	" Yes , I know , "
42030	42056	42028	42028	Ralph	262	" We have lots of Marys . It 's so common . Oh ! I do n't like Mary best . What do you think ? "
42064	42069	42070	42070	Ralph	262	" Do you know , "
42083	42152	42070	42070	Ralph	262	" I 'd do anything on earth for some names one or two . It 's not Mary , nor Lucy . Clarinda 's pretty , but it 's like a novel . Claribel , I like . Names beginning with ' Cl ' I prefer . The ' Cl 's ' are always gentle and lovely girls you would die for ! Do n't you think so ? "
42349	42361	42363	42363	Ralph	262	" Do n't you really prefer the ' Cl 's ' ? "
42367	42398	42363	42363	Ralph	262	" Not better than the names ending in ' a ' and ' y , ' Richard replied , wishing he could , for Ralph was evidently ahead of him . "
42404	42501	42363	42363	Ralph	262	" said Ralph . And under the trees Ralph unbosomed . His name was down for the army : Eton was quitted for ever . In a few months he would have to join his regiment , and before he left he must say goodbye to his friends .... Would Richard tell him Mrs. Forey 's address ? he had heard she was somewhere by the sea . Richard did not remember the address , but said he would willingly take charge of any letter and forward it . Ralph dived his hand into his pocket . "
42514	42515	42516	42516	My	0	" "
42524	42537	42538	42538	You	0	" said Richard , perusing what was composed of the exterior formula . "
42546	42553	42544	42544	herself	147	" That was plain to see . "
42562	42589	42559	42560	Countess Blandish	284	" Richard continued in a low tone , transferring the names , and playing on the musical strings they were to him . Then he said : "
42600	43412	42595	42595	they	603	" He fixed his eyes on Ralph . If he discovered anything further he said nothing , but bade the good fellow good - bye , jumped into his boat , and pulled down the tide . The moment Ralph was hidden by an abutment of the banks , Richard perused the address . For the first time it struck him that his cousin Clare was a very charming creature : he remembered the look of her eyes , and especially the last reproachful glance she gave him at parting . What business had Ralph to write to her ? Did she not belong to Richard Feverel ? He read the words again and again : Clare Doria Forey . Why , Clare was the name he liked best nay , he loved it . Doria , too she shared his own name with him . Away went his heart , not at a canter now , at a gallop , as one who sights the quarry . He felt too weak to pull . Clare Doria Forey oh , perfect melody ! Sliding with the tide , he heard it fluting in the bosom of the hills . When nature has made us ripe for love , it seldom occurs that the Fates are behindhand in furnishing a temple for the flame . Above green - flashing plunges of a weir , and shaken by the thunder below , lilies , golden and white , were swaying at anchor among the reeds . Meadow - sweet hung from the banks thick with weed and trailing bramble , and there also hung a daughter of earth . Her face was shaded by a broad straw hat with a flexible brim that left her lips and chin in the sun , and , sometimes nodding , sent forth a light of promising eyes . Across her shoulders , and behind , flowed large loose curls , brown in shadow , almost golden where the ray touched them . She was simply dressed , befitting decency and the season . On a closer inspection you might see that her lips were stained . This blooming young person was regaling on dewberries . They grew between the bank and the water . Apparently she found the fruit abundant , for her hand was making pretty progress to her mouth . Fastidious youth , which revolts at woman plumping her exquisite proportions on bread - and - butter , and would we must suppose joyfully have her scraggy to have her poetical , can hardly object to dewberries . Indeed the act of eating them is dainty and induces musing . The dewberry is a sister to the lotus , and an innocent sister . You eat : mouth , eye , and hand are occupied , and the undrugged mind free to roam . And so it was with the damsel who knelt there . The little skylark went up above her , all song , to the smooth southern cloud lying along the blue : from a dewy copse dark over her nodding hat the blackbird fluted , calling to her with thrice mellow note : the kingfisher flashed emerald out of green osiers : a bow - winged heron travelled aloft , seeking solitude a boat slipped toward her , containing a dreamy youth ; and still she plucked the fruit , and ate , and mused , as if no fairy prince were invading her territories , and as if she wished not for one , or knew not her wishes . Surrounded by the green shaven meadows , the pastoral summer buzz , the weir - fall 's thundering white , amid the breath and beauty of wild flowers , she was a bit of lovely human life in a fair setting ; a terrible attraction . The Magnetic Youth leaned round to note his proximity to the weir - piles , and beheld the sweet vision . Stiller and stiller grew nature , as at the meeting of two electric clouds . Her posture was so graceful , that though he was making straight for the weir , he dared not dip a scull . Just then one enticing dewberry caught her eyes . He was floating by unheeded , and saw that her hand stretched low , and could not gather what it sought . A stroke from his right brought him beside her . The damsel glanced up dismayed , and her whole shape trembled over the brink . Richard sprang from his boat into the water . Pressing a hand beneath her foot , which she had thrust against the crumbling wet sides of the bank to save herself , he enabled her to recover her balance , and gain safe earth , whither he followed her .
44157	44161	44142	44142	he	186	" Match him ! "
44188	44192	44194	44195	The Pilgrim	265	" O Women ! "
44206	44254	44194	44195	The Pilgrim	265	" Women , who like , and will have for hero , a rake ! how soon are you not to learn that you have taken bankrupts to your bosoms , and that the putrescent gold that attracted you is the slime of the Lake of Sin ! "
44407	44414	44401	44401	her	293	" My book ! my book ! "
44428	44434	44435	44435	he	287	" What have you lost ? "
44438	44442	44443	44443	she	293	" My book ! "
44462	44476	44477	44477	she	293	" Oh , no , no ! let me entreat you not to , "
44480	44491	44477	44477	she	293	" I do not so very much mind losing it . "
44519	44532	44533	44533	she	293	" Indeed , I do not really care for the silly book , "
44544	44550	44533	44533	she	293	" Pray , do not ! "
44665	44671	44672	44672	he	287	" Let me try again , "

45110	45133	45099	45101	the magnetic muser	1926	" not more than one foot , I hope . I will leave you while you dry your stockings in the sun . "
45144	45174	45178	45178	he	1926	" Not I , but you . You would try to get that silly book for me , and you are dripping wet . Are you not very uncomfortable ? "
45186	45198	45178	45178	he	1926	" And you really do not feel that you are wet ? "
45239	45246	45247	45247	she	6839	" I can not help it , "
45264	45272	45247	45247	she	6839	" Pardon me , wo n't you ? "
45286	45303	45304	45304	she	6839	" Not to feel that you have been in the water , the very moment after ! "

45755	45760	45684	45684	Sweet	296	" Belthorpe ! Belthorpe ! "
45780	45789	45766	45766	he	186	" Do you mean old Blaize 's farm ? "
45790	45799	45800	45800	She	6839	" Then I am old Blaize 's niece . "
45832	45840	45842	45842	his	1926	" Then what what is your name ? "
45850	45863	45846	45846	his	1926	" O wonderful creature ! How came you to enrich the earth ? "
45864	45875	45876	45876	she	6839	" Have you forgot the Desboroughs of Dorset , too ? "
45890	45896	45876	45876	she	6839	" The Desboroughs of Dorset ? "
45904	45919	45920	45920	He	1926	" And have you grown to this ? That little girl I saw there ! "
45969	45973	45974	45974	she	6839	" You see , "
45977	45983	45974	45974	she	6839	" we are old acquaintances . "

46157	46169	46170	46170	She	6839	" Oh no , no ! you would never offend me . "
46178	46187	46170	46170	She	6839	" Then why why do you leave me ? "
46188	46191	46192	46192	she	6839	" Because , "
46195	46200	46192	46192	she	6839	" I must go . "

47978	48016	48018	48019	the baronet	609	" We must take care to have seen where we planted , and that the root was sound , or the mischief will do itself in site of , or under the very spectacles of , supervision , "

48039	48129	48033	48033	his	2013	" It is my plan with Ripton , who has had the honour of an introduction to you , and a very pleasant time he spent with my young friend , whom he does not forget . Ripton follows the Law . He is articled to me , and will , I trust , succeed me worthily in your confidence . I bring him into town in the morning ; I take him back at night . I think I may say that I am quite content with him . "
48130	48135	48137	48138	Sir Austin	186	" Do you think , "
48144	48157	48137	48138	Sir Austin	186	" that you can trace every act of his to its motive ? "
48172	48175	48158	48160	The old lawyer	2011	" Do you "
48183	48234	48176	48177	Sir Austin	186	" do you establish yourself in a radiating centre of intuition : do you base your watchfulness on so thorough an acquaintance with his character , so perfect a knowledge of the instrument , that all its movements even the eccentric ones are anticipated by you , and provided for ? "
48299	48303	48271	48271	he	158	" I find , "
48318	48469	48310	48310	he	186	" there are fathers who are content to be simply obeyed . Now I require not only that my son should obey ; I would have him guiltless of the impulse to gainsay my wishes feeling me in him stronger than his undeveloped nature , up to a certain period , where my responsibility ends and his commences . Man is a self - acting machine . He can not cease to be a machine ; but , though self - acting , he may lose the powers of self - guidance , and in a wrong course his very vitalities hurry him to perdition . Young , he is an organism ripening to the set mechanic diurnal round , and while so he needs all the angels to hold watch over him that he grow straight and healthy , and fit for what machinal duties he may have to perform "
48653	48655	48656	48657	Mr. Thompson	158	" healthy "
48662	48730	48656	48657	Mr. Thompson	158	" I apprehended you ! Oh , I agree with you , Sir Austin ! entirely ! Allow me to ring for my son Ripton . I think , if you condescend to examine him , you will say that regular habits , and a diet of nothing but law - reading for other forms of literature I strictly interdict have made him all that you instance . "
48745	48756	48758	48758	he	158	" Permit me to see the lad at his occupation , "
48953	48960	48962	48963	Mr. Thompson	158	" Comparing notes , I daresay , "
48968	48974	48962	48963	Mr. Thompson	158	" I call that study ! "
48985	48995	48975	48977	The confidential clerk	2027	" Is it like this every day , Beazley ? "
49003	49006	49007	49009	the old clerk	2035	" Ahem ! "
49012	49031	49007	49009	the old clerk	2035	" he is like this every day , sir . I could not ask more of a mouse . "
49151	49217	49136	49136	his	186	" I am glad to find my son 's old comrade thus profitably occupied . I know what study is myself . But beware of prosecuting it too excitedly ! Come ! you must not be offended at our interruption ; you will soon take up the thread again . Besides , you know , you must get accustomed to the visits of your client . "

49382	49385	49387	49388	Mr. Thompson	158	" Ah ! "
49396	49406	49387	49388	Mr. Thompson	158	" Gravelkind , indeed ! Gavelkind ! An old Kentish "
49432	49459	49414	49415	Sir Austin	186	" I should like to look at your son 's notes , or remarks on the judiciousness of that family arrangement , if he had any . "
49460	49475	49477	49478	Mr. Thompson	158	" You were making notes , or referring to them , as we entered , "
49484	49502	49477	49478	Mr. Thompson	158	" a very good plan , which I have always enjoined on you . Were you not ? "
49520	49529	49506	49506	he	158	" What were you doing then , sir ? "

49802	49808	49810	49811	Mr. Thompson	158	" What have we here ? "

49870	49907	49841	49841	his	158	" Mr. Thompson hem'd ! and stopped short , like a man who comes unexpectedly upon a snake in his path . Mr. Beazley 's feet shuffled . Sir Austin changed the position of an arm . "
49918	49933	49841	49841	his	158	" gasped Ripton . Mr. Thompson confidently turned over , and intoned with emphasis . "

50401	50418	50419	50419	your	158	" snapped Mr. Thompson , senior , peering venom at the unfortunate Ripton over his spectacles , "
50436	50471	50434	50434	sir	6036	" With another side - shot at the confidential clerk , who retired immediately behind a strong entrenchment of shrugs , Mr. Thompson was pushed by the devil of his rancour to continue reading : "
50487	50489	50434	50434	sir	6036	" ... "
50501	50506	50492	50492	we	2074	" said Mr. Thompson . "
50602	50624	50577	50577	me	0	" Mr. Thompson wiped his forehead , as Brutes might have done after passing judgment on the scion of his house . "
50628	50644	50577	50577	me	0	" he went on , fluttering Ripton 's precious lucubrations in a waving judicial hand , "
50677	50689	50691	50691	you	158	" he cried , as Ripton was noiselessly shutting his desk , "
50723	50776	50717	50717	you	158	" Ripton was understood to say he devoted that corner to old briefs on important cases . Mr. Thompson thrust his trembling fingers among the old briefs , and turned over the volume Sir Austin had observed , but without much remarking it , for his suspicions had not risen to print . "
50782	50801	50717	50717	you	158	" the baronet politely , and it may be ironically , inquired , before it could well escape . "
50808	50819	50717	50717	you	158	" said Ripton , clutching the book in dreadful torment . "
50833	50843	50825	50825	you	158	" The baronet proffered a hand for the book . "
50850	51005	50825	50825	you	158	" cried Ripton , still clutching it nervously . Mr. Thompson , without any notion of what he was doing , drew the book from Ripton 's hold ; whereupon the two seniors laid their grey heads together over the title - page . It set forth in attractive characters beside a coloured frontispiece , which embodied the promise displayed there , the entrancing adventures of Miss Random , a strange young lady . Had there been a Black Hole within the area of those law regions to consign Ripton to there and then , or an Iron Rod handy to mortify his sinful flesh , Mr. Thompson would have used them . As it was , he contented himself by looking Black Holes and Iron Rods at the detected youth , who sat on his perch insensible to what might happen next , collapsed . Mr. Thompson cast the wicked creature down with a "
51008	51039	50825	50825	you	158	" He , however , took her up again , and strode away with her . Sir Austin gave Ripton a forefinger , and kindly touched his head , saying , "
51060	51070	51050	51050	Richard	186	" Undoubtedly this was a great triumph to the System !
51082	51087	51094	51094	he	158	" Is it possible , "
51104	51121	51094	51094	he	158	" that you will consent , Sir Austin , to see him and receive him again ? "
51122	51125	51126	51127	the baronet	609	" Certainly , "
51130	51180	51126	51127	the baronet	609	" Why not ? This by no means astonishes me . When there is no longer danger to my son he will be welcome as he was before . He is a schoolboy . I knew it . I expected it . The results of your principle , Thompson ! "
51181	51193	51195	51197	the old lawyer	2011	" One of the very worst books of that abominable class ! "
51232	51235	51236	51236	he	2011	" Pah ! "
51256	51338	51339	51341	The old lawyer	2011	" from this day I diet him on bread and water rescind his pocket - money ! How he could have got hold of such a book ! How he ! And what ideas ! Concealing them from me as he has done so cunningly ! He trifles with vice ! His mind is in a putrid state ! I might have believed I did believe I might have gone on believing my son Ripton to be a moral young man ! "
51357	51364	51366	51367	Sir Austin	186	" The lad has come out ! "
51369	51509	51366	51367	Sir Austin	186	" His adoption of the legal form is amusing . He trifles with vice , true : people newly initiated are as hardy as its intimates , and a young sinner 's amusements will resemble those of a confirmed debauchee . The satiated , and the insatiate , appetite alike appeal to extremes . You are astonished at this revelation of your son 's condition . I expected it ; though assuredly , believe me , not this sudden and indisputable proof of it . But I knew that the seed was in him , and therefore I have not latterly invited him to Raynham . School , and the corruption there , will bear its fruits sooner or later . I could advise you , Thompson , what to do with him : it would be my plan . "
51549	51555	51557	51558	the baronet	609	" Let him , then , "
51609	51617	51620	51620	I	0	" Mr. Thompson began to blink again . "
51642	51643	51635	51635	I	0	" "

51718	51724	51683	51683	You	130	" broke forth Mr. Thompson . "
51728	51733	51683	51683	You	130	" said the baronet . "
51739	51743	51683	51683	You	130	" he added , "
51801	51808	51797	51797	I	0	" he exclaimed , becoming excited , "
51891	51897	51887	51887	lawyers	1982	" Mr. Thompson acquiesced significantly . "
51906	51911	51887	51887	lawyers	1982	" Sir Austin continued . "
51979	52390	52400	52400	I	0	" This was indeed a terrible view of existence . Mr. Thompson felt uneasy . There was a dignity in his client , an impressiveness in his speech , that silenced remonstrating reason and the cry of long years of comfortable respectability . Mr. Thompson went to church regularly ; paid his rates and dues without overmuch , or at least more than common , grumbling . On the surface he was a good citizen , fond of his children , faithful to his wife , devoutly marching to a fair seat in heaven on a path paved by something better than a thousand a year . But here was a man sighting him from below the surface , and though it was an unfair , unaccustomed , not to say un - English , method of regarding one 's fellow - man , Mr. Thompson was troubled by it . What though his client exaggerated ? Facts were at the bottom of what he said . And he was acute he had unmasked Ripton ! Since Ripton 's exposure he winced at a personal application in the text his client preached from . Possibly this was the secret source of part of his anger against that peccant youth . Mr. Thompson shook his head , and , with dolefully puckered visage and a pitiable contraction of his shoulders , rose slowly up from his chair . Apparently he was about to speak , but he straightway turned and went meditatively to a side - recess in the room , whereof he opened a door , drew forth a tray and a decanter labelled Port , filled a glass for his client , deferentially invited him to partake of it ; filled another glass for himself , and drank . That was his reply . Sir Austin never took wine before dinner . Thompson had looked as if he meant to speak : he waited for Thompson 's words . Mr. Thompson saw that , as his client did not join him in his glass , the eloquence of that Porty reply was lost on his client . Having slowly ingurgitated and meditated upon this precious draught , and turned its flavour over and over with an aspect of potent Judicial wisdom one might have thought that he was weighing mankind m the balance , the old lawyer heaved , and said , sharpening his lips over the admirable vintage , "
52406	52414	52403	52404	Sir Austin	130	" His client gazed at him queerly . "
52418	52439	52445	52445	you	130	" Mr. Thompson added immediately , ill - concealing by his gaze the glowing intestinal congratulations going on within him , "
52464	52465	52445	52445	you	130	" "
52476	52659	52474	52474	Thompson	158	" Sir Austin murmured , without disturbing his legal adviser 's dimples . The old lawyer sat down to finish his glass , saying , that such a wine was not to be had everywhere . They were then outwardly silent for a apace . Inwardly one of them was full of riot and jubilant uproar : as if the solemn fields of law were suddenly to be invaded and possessed by troops of Bacchanals : and to preserve a decently wretched physiognomy over it , and keep on terms with his companion , he had to grimace like a melancholy clown in a pantomime . Mr. Thompson brushed back his hair . The baronet was still expectant . Mr. Thompson sighed deeply , and emptied his glass . He combated the change that had come over him . He tried not to see Ruby . He tried to feel miserable , and it was not in him . He spoke , drawing what appropriate inspirations he could from his client 's countenance , to show that they had views in common : "
52666	52671	52663	52663	I	0	" The baronet nodded . "
52681	52686	52675	52678	my wine - merchants	2116	" continued Mr. Thompson , "
52695	52700	52675	52678	my wine - merchants	2116	" Sir Austin stared . "
52713	52719	52675	52678	my wine - merchants	2116	" Mr. Thompson went on . "
52804	52819	52820	52820	Nobody	1322	" He fronted his client like a man who accuses an enormous public delinquency . "
52924	52970	52915	52915	Ours	2126	" The scene with Ripton had unnerved him , the wine had renovated , and gratitude to the wine inspired his tongue . He thought that his client , of the whimsical mind , though undoubtedly correct moral views , had need of a glass . "
53133	53171	53128	53128	I	0	" Mr. Thompson meant to say , he thought his client would arrive at something of a similar jocund contemplation of his fellows in their degeneracy that inspirited lawyers after potation , but condensed the sensual promise into "
53175	53242	53128	53128	I	0	" Sir Austin speculated on his legal adviser with a sour mouth comically compressed . It stood clear to him that Thompson before his Port , and Thompson after , were two different men . To indoctrinate him now was too late : it was perhaps the time to make the positive use of him he wanted . He pencilled on a handy slip of paper : "
53269	53274	53128	53128	I	0	" and again the hieroglyph "
53279	53283	53284	53284	I	0	" He said , "
53294	53329	53292	53292	Thompson	158	" words that transfigured the delighted lawyer , and ensigned the skeleton of a great Aphorism to his pocket , there to gather flesh and form , with numberless others in a like condition . "
53337	53343	53344	53344	I	0	" he said to himself . "
53356	53356	53344	53344	I	0	"
53466	53469	53471	53472	the doctor	2151	" and , "
53483	53710	53471	53472	the doctor	2151	" Which was interpreted to mean , that he would be a catch ; the doctor probably intending to allude to certain extraordinary difficulties in the way of a choice . A demand was made on the publisher of The Pilgrim 's Scrip for all his outstanding copies . Conventionalities were defied . A summer - shower of cards fell on the baronet 's table . He had few male friends . He shunned the Clubs as nests of scandal . The cards he contemplated were mostly those of the sex , with the husband , if there was a husband , evidently dragged in for propriety 's sake . He perused the cards and smiled . He knew their purpose . What terrible light Thompson and Bairam had thrown on some of them ! Heavens ! in what a state was the blood of this Empire . Before commencing his campaign he called on two ancient intimates , Lord Heddon , and his distant cousin Darley Absworthy , both Members of Parliament , useful men , though gouty , who had sown in their time a fine crop of wild oats , and advocated the advantage of doing so , seeing that they did not fancy themselves the worse for it . He found one with an imbecile son and the other with consumptive daughters . "
53714	53723	53471	53472	the doctor	2151	" he wrote in the Note - book , "
53730	53743	53471	53472	the doctor	2151	" Darley was proud of his daughters ' white and pink skins . "
53747	53868	53471	53472	the doctor	2151	" he called them . The eldest was in the market , immensely admired . Sir Austin was introduced to her . She talked fluently and sweetly . A youth not on his guard , a simple school - boy youth , or even a man , might have fallen in love with her , she was so affable and fair . There was something poetic about her . And she was quite well , she said , the baronet frequently questioning her on that point . She intimated that she was robust ; but towards the close of their conversation her hand would now and then travel to her side , and she breathed painfully an instant , saying , "
53900	53913	53892	53892	I	0	" Sir Austin nodded and blinked sadly , exclaiming to his soul , "
53920	53939	53892	53892	I	0	" He did not ask permission to see Dora and Adela . Lord Heddon vehemently preached wild oats . "
53947	53951	53945	53945	Feverel	130	" he said , "
54271	54272	54268	54268	your	0	" "
54277	54282	54268	54268	your	0	" replied Sir Austin . "
54286	54287	54284	54284	yours	0	" "
54296	54302	54290	54290	Lipscombe	329	" Lord Heddon sighed peevishly . "
54332	54360	54324	54324	I	0	" Lord Lipscombe entering the room just then , Sir Austin surveyed him , and was not astonished at the refusal of the country to take him . "
54364	54400	54324	54324	I	0	" he thought , as he contemplated the headless , degenerate , weedy issue and result . Both Darley Absworthy and Lord Heddon spoke of the marriage of their offspring as a matter of course . "
54409	54416	54417	54417	I	0	" Sir Austin confessed to himself , "
54459	54554	54562	54562	you	0	" However , they silenced him . He was obliged to spare their feelings on a subject to him so deeply sacred . The healthful image of his noble boy rose before him , a triumphant living rejoinder to any hostile argument . He was content to remark to his doctor , that he thought the third generation of wild oats would be a pretty thin crop ! Families against whom neither Thompson lawyer nor Bairam physician could recollect a progenitorial blot , either on the male or female side , were not numerous . "
54557	54561	54562	54562	you	0	" said the doctors "
54659	54660	54661	54661	Doctor	6522	" "
54663	54668	54661	54661	Doctor	6522	" replied Sir Austin , "
54686	54687	54679	54679	you	6522	" "
54691	54696	54679	54679	you	6522	" said the doctor . "
54717	54722	54703	54703	I	0	" Sir Austin returned . "
54781	54782	54772	54772	I	0	" "
54785	54790	54772	54772	I	0	" said the doctor . "
54828	54829	54824	54824	you	0	" "
54843	54848	54824	54824	you	0	" said the baronet . "
54887	54904	54879	54879	you	0	" Doctor Bairam would hardly be flattered at such a comparison , assuredly , he interjected . "
54907	54912	54913	54914	the French	2194	" added the baronet , "
54966	55004	55009	55009	Systems	330	" Doctor Bairam wished the baronet success , and diligently endeavoured to assist his search for a mate worthy of the pure - blood barb , by putting several mamas , whom he visited , on the alert .
55513	55519	55508	55509	the angels	2228	" Lucy ! my beloved ! "
55520	55524	55538	55541	a sheep - boy	2233	" O Richard ! "
55865	55876	55890	55890	their	2242	" And this divine gift was in store for me ! "
55910	55919	55890	55890	their	2242	" You for me : I for you ! "
55920	55928	55929	55929	They	2242	" We are born for each other ! "
55977	55989	55990	55990	Pipe	332	" Here we two sit who are written above as one ! "
56065	56076	56173	56173	He	2257	" Lucy , did you never dream of meeting me ? "
56077	56088	56173	56173	He	2257	" O Richard ! yes ; for I remembered you . "
56089	56101	56173	56173	He	2257	" Lucy ! and did you pray that we might meet ? "
56102	56106	56173	56173	He	2257	" I did ! "
56155	56172	56173	56173	He	2257	" My own ! my own for ever ! You are pledged to me ? Whisper ! "
56179	56185	56173	56173	He	2257	" And you are mine ? "
56238	56247	56253	56253	his	2257	" Lucy ! my bride ! my life ! "
56921	56929	56930	56930	Adrian	346	" Happy to take wine with you , "
56951	56966	56967	56969	the Eighteenth Century	713	" Drink , nephew Hippy , and think of the doctor to - morrow ! "
56983	56990	56992	56992	Hippias	334	" It 's this literary work ! "
57000	57030	56992	56992	Hippias	334	" I do n't know what else it can be . You have no idea how anxious I feel . I have frightful dreams . I 'm perpetually anxious . "
57031	57035	57037	57037	Adrian	346	" No wonder , "
57058	57143	57144	57144	Hippias	334	" No wonder . Ten years of Fairy Mythology ! Could anyone hope to sleep in peace after that ? As to your digestion , no one has a digestion who is in the doctor 's hands . They prescribe from dogmas , and do n't count on the system . They have cut you down from two bottles to two glasses . It 's absurd . You ca n't sleep , because your system is crying out for what it 's accustomed to . "
57681	57690	57691	57691	Molly	136	" Are you looking for your young gentleman ? "
57718	57733	57695	57695	Adrian	346	" I am , miss . I want you to tell me about him . "
57734	57737	57739	57741	the buxom lass	2306	" Dear ! "
57743	57755	57756	57756	Adrian	346	" was you coming for me to - night to know ? "
57767	57779	57780	57780	Molly	136	" 'Cause I ca n't stop out long to - night , "
57794	57817	57780	57780	Molly	136	" You may go in when you please , miss . Is that any one coming ? Come here in the shade . "
57818	57824	57826	57827	Miss Molly	337	" Now , get along ! "
57834	57842	57843	57843	He	346	" Listen to me , Molly Davenport ! "
57862	57875	57843	57843	He	346	" I want to know whether you have seen him at all ? "
57876	57937	57938	57938	Adrian	346	" Who ? Your young gentleman ? I sh'd think I did . I seen him to - night only . Ai n't he grooved handsome . He 's al'ays about Beltharp now . It ai n't to fire no more ricks . He 's afire ' unself . Ai n't you seen 'em together ? He 's after the missis "
57986	58006	57979	57980	The girl	1636	" As for Miss Lucy , she have n't a bit of art in her , nor have he . "
58007	58016	58018	58018	Adrian	346	" They 're all nature , I suppose , "
58020	58032	58018	58018	Adrian	346	" How is it I do n't see her at church ? "
58033	58042	58044	58044	Molly	136	" She 's Catholic , or some think , "
58046	58082	58044	58044	Molly	136	" Her father was , and a leftenant . She've a Cross in her bedroom . She do n't go to church . I see you there last Sunday a - lookin ' so solemn , "
58315	58324	58325	58325	Molly	339	" She looks like angels in her nightgown ! "
58356	58428	58332	58332	she	339	" Mr. Harley ! you wo n't go for doin' any harm to 'em 'cause of what I said , will you now ? Do say you wo n't now , Mr. Harley ! She is good , though she 's a Catholic . She was kind to me when I was ill , and I would n't have her crossed I 'd rather be showed up myself , I would ! "
58492	58504	58506	58508	the sprightly Silvia	2331	" Moll ! you they re ! It be I Bantam ! "
58543	58549	58550	58550	he	346	" It 's the Inevitable ! "
58860	58872	58853	58853	Tom	199	" Do you know what , sir ? You be watched ! "
58902	58910	58912	58912	Richard	186	" It 's he , is it ? "
58914	58938	58912	58912	Richard	186	" He shall rue it , Tom . If I find him near me when we 're together he shall never forget it . "
58939	58948	58949	58949	Tom	199	" Do n't hit too hard , sir , "
58952	58966	58967	58967	Richard	186	" You hit mortal hard when you 're in earnest , you know . "
59102	59110	59112	59113	Lady Blandish	489	" I have seen the little girl , "
59115	59247	59112	59113	Lady Blandish	489	" She is pretty she would be telling if she were well set up . She speaks well . How absurd it is of that class to educate their women above their station ! The child is really too good for a farmer . I noticed her before I knew of this ; she has enviable hair . I suppose she does n't paint her eyelids . Just the sort of person to take a young man . I thought there was something wrong . I received , the day before yesterday , an impassioned poem evidently not intended for me . My hair was gold . My meeting him was foretold . My eyes were homes of light fringed with night . I sent it back , correcting the colours . "
59248	59256	59258	59258	Adrian	346	" Which was death to the rhymes , "
59260	59307	59258	59258	Adrian	346	" I saw her this morning . The boy has n't bad taste . As you say , she is too good for a farmer . Such a spark would explode any System . She slightly affected mine . The Huron is stark mad about her . "
59308	59319	59321	59322	Lady Blandish	489	" But we must positively write and tell his father , "
59385	59389	59390	59390	she	990	" Poor boy ! "
59393	59419	59390	59390	she	990	" I am really sorry for him . I hope he will not feel it too strongly . They feel strongly , father and son . "
59420	59425	59426	59426	Adrian	346	" And select wisely , "
59429	59435	59437	59438	Lady Blandish	489	" That 's another thing , "
59553	59560	59562	59563	Lady Blandish	489	" Quite a lover 's night , "
59565	59577	59562	59563	Lady Blandish	489	" And I , who have none to love pity me ! "
59585	59591	59593	59594	Lady Blandish	489	" And never will have , "
59598	59604	59593	59594	Lady Blandish	489	" You buy your loves . "
59676	59682	59708	59709	the lady	990	" I know you men , "
60002	60016	59979	59979	she	233	" You should know my cousin Austin , Lucy . Darling ! Beloved ! "
60017	60023	59979	59979	she	233	" My own ! Richard ! "
60024	60091	59979	59979	she	233	" You should know my cousin Austin . You shall know him . He would take to you best of them all , and you to him . He is in the tropics now , looking out a place it 's a secret for poor English working - men to emigrate to and found a colony in that part of the world : my white angel ! "
60092	60096	59979	59979	she	233	" Dear love ! "
60097	60147	59979	59979	she	233	" He is such a noble fellow ! Nobody here understands him but me . Is n't it strange ? Since I met you I love him better ! That 's because I love all that 's good and noble better now Beautiful ! I love I love you ! "
60148	60152	59979	59979	she	233	" My Richard ! "
60153	60234	60235	60235	His	2383	" What do you think I 've determined , Lucy ? If my father but no ! my father does love me . No ! he will not ; and we will be happy together here . And I will win my way with you . And whatever I win will be yours ; for it will be owing to you . I feel as if I had no strength but yours none ! and you make me O Lucy ! "
60242	60248	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" Your father , Richard . "
60249	60255	59979	59979	she	233	" Yes , my father ? "
60256	60267	59979	59979	she	233	" Dearest Richard ! I feel so afraid of him . "
60268	60280	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" He loves me , and will love you , Lucy . "
60281	60292	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" But I am so poor and humble , Richard . "
60293	60306	59979	59979	she	233	" No one I have ever seen is like you , Lucy . "
60307	60314	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" You think so , because you "
60315	60318	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" What ? "
60319	60323	59979	59979	she	233	" Love me , "
60347	60451	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" You are fond of the knights , Lucy . Austin is as brave as any of them . My own bride ! Oh , how I adore you ! When you are gone , I could fall upon the grass you tread upon , and kiss it . My breast feels empty of my heart Lucy ! if we lived in those days , I should have been a knight , and have won honour and glory for you . Oh ! one can do nothing now . My lady - love ! My lady - love ! A tear ? Lucy ? "
60452	60465	60510	60510	Her	2384	" Dearest ! Ah , Richard ! I am not a lady . "
60466	60480	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" Who dares say that ? Not a lady the angel I love ! "
60481	60490	60239	60240	Presently Lucy	342	" Think , Richard , who I am . "
60491	60509	60510	60510	Her	2384	" My beautiful ! I think that God made you , and has given you to me . "
60554	60563	60537	60537	she	2384	" Lucy ! O heavenly spirit ! Lucy ! "
60568	60576	60565	60565	her	2384	" I do not weep for sorrow . "
60711	60719	60705	60705	they	2388	" O happy day when we met ! "
60734	60743	60744	60744	Their	2388	" O glorious heaven looking down on us ! "
60759	60765	60725	60725	one	836	" O eternity of bliss ! "
60778	60895	60725	60725	one	836	" Lucy ! come with me to - night , and look at the place where you are some day to live . Come , and I will row you on the lake . You remember what you said in your letter that you dreamt ? that we were floating over the shadow of the Abbey to the nuns at work by torchlight felling the cypress , and they handed us each a sprig . Why , darling , it was the best omen in the world , their felling the old trees . And you write such lovely letters . So pure and sweet they are . I love the nuns for having taught you . "
60896	60908	60909	60909	she	2392	" Ah , Richard ! See ! we forget ! Ah ! "
60922	60974	60909	60909	she	2392	" even if your father forgives my birth , he will not my religion . And , dearest , though I would die for you I can not change it . It would seem that I was denying God ; and oh ! it would make me ashamed of my love . "
60975	60979	60980	60980	He	2393	" Fear nothing ! "
60988	61166	60980	60980	He	2393	" Come ! He will love us both , and love you the more for being faithful to your father 's creed . You do n't know him , Lucy . He seems harsh and stern he is full of kindness and love . He is n't at all a bigot . And besides , when he hears what the nuns have done for you , wo n't he thank them , as I do ? And oh ! I must speak to him soon , and you must be prepared to see him soon , for I can not bear your remaining at Belthorpe , like a jewel in a sty . Mind ! I 'm not saying a word against your uncle . I declare I love everybody and everything that sees you and touches you . Stay ! it is a wonder how you could have grown there . But you were not born there , and your father had good blood . Desborough ! here was a Colonel Desborough never mind ! Come ! "
61188	61199	61206	61206	Adrian	346	" What think you of that for a pretty pastoral ? "
61330	61338	61340	61340	Benson	187	" Is that you , Mr. Hadrian ? "
61353	61371	61372	61372	Adrian	346	" Is it you , Benson , who have had the audacity to spy upon these Mysteries ? "
61384	61396	61372	61372	Adrian	346	" You look as if you had just been well thrashed . "
61397	61405	61407	61407	Benson	187	" Is n't it dreadful , sir ? "
61409	61419	61407	61407	Benson	187	" And his father in ignorance , Mr. Hadrian ! "
61420	61459	61372	61372	Adrian	346	" He shall know , Benson ! He shall know how , you have endangered your valuable skin in his service . If Mr. Richard had found you there just now I would n't answer for the consequences . "
61460	61463	61464	61464	Benson	187	" Ha ! "
61468	61534	61464	61464	Benson	187	" This wo n't go on ; Mr. Hadrian . It sha n't , sir . It will be put a stop to tomorrow , sir . I call it corruption of a young gentleman like him , and harlotry , sir , I call it . I 'd have every jade flogged that made a young innocent gentleman go on like that , sir . "
61535	61579	61643	61644	the lady	990	" Then , why did n't you stop it yourself , Benson ? Ah , I see ! you waited what ? This is not the first time you have been attendant on Apollo and Miss Dryope ? You have written to headquarters ? "
61580	61589	61590	61592	The wise youth	746	" I did my duty , Mr. Hadrian . "
61612	61623	61624	61624	she	990	" I hope Richard will treat him as he deserves , "
61627	61632	61633	61633	Adrian	346	" Shall we home ? "
61636	61642	61643	61644	the lady	990	" Do me a favour ; "
61647	61662	61643	61644	the lady	990	" Get my carriage sent round to meet me at the park - gates . "
61663	61668	61633	61633	Adrian	346	" Wo n't you ? "
61669	61676	61677	61677	Adrian	346	" I want to be alone . "
61704	61709	61711	61713	the wise youth	746	" An odd creature ! "
61715	61761	61711	61713	the wise youth	746	" She 's as odd as any of them . She ought to be a Feverel . I suppose she 's graduating for it . Hang that confounded old ass of a Benson ! He has had the impudence to steal a march on me ! "
61825	61830	61831	61831	he	186	" Did I live ? "
61960	61971	61972	61972	she	233	" I never was so happy as to - night , "
61975	61999	61954	61954	He	2387	" Look , my Lucy . The lights of the old place are on the lake . Look where you are to live . "
62000	62008	62009	62009	He	2387	" Which is your room , Richard ? "
62016	62044	62009	62009	He	2387	" O Richard ! that I were one of the women who wait on you ! I should ask nothing more . How happy she must be ! "
62045	62070	61954	61954	He	2387	" My darling angel - love . You shall be happy ; but all shall wait on you , and I foremost , Lucy . "
62071	62081	62009	62009	He	2387	" Dearest ! may I hope for a letter ? "
62082	62092	62009	62009	He	2387	" By eleven to - morrow . And I ? "
62093	62103	61954	61954	He	2387	" Oh ! you will have mine , Richard . "
62104	62124	62125	62125	She	2411	" Tom shall wait far it . A long one , mind ! Did you like my last song ? "
62173	62176	62177	62177	she	2411	" See ! "
62187	62190	62193	62193	she	2411	" See ! "
62202	62216	62218	62218	he	2412	" the cypress does point towards us . O Richard ! it does ! "
62235	62262	62218	62218	he	2412	" Why , there 's hardly any shadow at all , Lucy . She must n't dream , my darling ! or dream only of me . "
62263	62270	62218	62218	he	2412	" Dearest ! but I do . "
62271	62295	62218	62218	he	2412	" To - morrow , Lucy ! The letter in the morning , and you at night . O happy to - morrow ! "
62296	62307	62218	62218	he	2412	" You will be sure to be there , Richard ? "
62308	62317	62218	62218	he	2412	" If I am not dead , Lucy . "
62318	62337	62218	62218	he	2412	" O Richard ! pray , pray do not speak of that . I shall not survive you . "
62338	62379	62218	62218	he	2412	" Let us pray , Lucy , to die together , when we are to die . Death or life , with you ! Who is it yonder ? I see some one is it Tom ? It 's Adrian ! "
62380	62386	62387	62389	The fair girl	2416	" Is it Mr. Harley ? "
62392	62399	62401	62401	Richard	186	" How dares he come here ! "
62463	62476	62478	62478	Lucy	233	" Will he have seen me ? Will he have known me ? "
62482	62490	62492	62492	Richard	186	" And if he does , love ? "
62494	62530	62492	62492	Richard	186	" Oh ! if he does , dearest I do n't know , but I feel such a presentiment . You have not spoken of him to - night , Richard . Is he good ? "
62531	62534	62535	62535	Richard	186	" Good ? "
62545	62561	62562	62562	Her	233	" He 's very fond of eating ; that 's all I know of Adrian . "
62572	62577	62535	62535	Richard	186	" Well , Tom ? "
62578	62590	62592	62592	Tom	199	" Mr. Adrian wishes particular to speak to you , sir , "
62594	62605	62592	62592	Tom	199	" Do go to him , dearest ! Do go ! "
62610	62618	62606	62606	Lucy	233	" Oh , how I hate Adrian ! "
62626	62630	62631	62631	Lucy	233	" Do go ! "
62635	62655	62631	62631	Lucy	233	" Tom good Tom will see me home . To - morrow , dear love ! To - morrow ! "
62656	62664	62606	62606	Lucy	233	" You wish to part from me ? "
62665	62692	62631	62631	Lucy	233	" Oh , unkind ! but you must not come with me now . It may be news of importance , dearest . Think , Richard ! "
62693	62699	62606	62606	Lucy	233	" Tom ! go back ! "
62742	62753	62735	62735	Richard	186	" What is it you want with me , Adrian ? "
62754	62766	62768	62768	Adrian	346	" Are we seconds , or principals , O fiery one ? "
62772	62788	62768	62768	Adrian	346	" I want nothing with you , except to know whether you have seen Benson . "
62789	62805	62735	62735	Richard	186	" Where should I see Benson ? What do I know of Benson 's doings ? "
62806	62871	62735	62735	Richard	186	" Of course not such a secret old fist as he is ! I want some one to tell him to order Lady Blandish 's carriage to be sent round to the park - gates . I thought he might be round your way over there I came upon him accidentally just now in Abbey - wood . What 's the matter , boy ? "
62872	62878	62768	62768	Adrian	346	" You saw him there ? "
62879	62897	62899	62899	Adrian	346	" Hunting Diana , I suppose . He thinks she 's not so chaste as they say , "
62901	62911	62899	62899	Adrian	346	" Are you going to knock down that tree ? "
62936	62943	62944	62944	Adrian	346	" You 'll spoil that weeper , "
62947	62968	62944	62944	Adrian	346	" Down she comes ! But good - night , Ricky . If you see Benson mind you tell him . "
63061	63334	63054	63056	the wise youth	746	" ' The Fates are Jews with us when they delay a punishment , ' says The Pilgrim 's Scrip , or words to that effect . The heavens evidently love Benson , seeing that he gets his punishment on the spot . Master Ricky is a peppery young man . He gets it from the apt Gruffudh . I rather believe in race . What a noise that old ruffian makes ! He 'll require poulticing with The Pilgrim 's Scrip . We shall have a message to - morrow , and a hubbub , and perhaps all go to town , which wo n't be bad for one who 's been a prey to all the desires born of dulness . Benson howls : there 's life in the old dog yet ! He bays the moon . Look at her . She does n't care . It 's the same to her whether we coo like turtle - doves or roar like twenty lions . How complacent she looks ! And yet she has dust as much sympathy for Benson as for Cupid . She would smile on if both were being birched . Was that a raven or Benson ? He howls no more . It sounds guttural : frog - like something between the brek - kek - kek and the hoarse raven 's croak . The fellow'll be killing him . It 's time to go to the rescue . A deliverer gets more honour by coming in at the last gasp than if he forestalled catastrophe . Ho , there , what 's the matter ? "
63362	63371	63373	63373	Adrian	346	" Holloa , Ricky ! is it you ? "
63375	63391	63373	63373	Adrian	346	" What 's this ? Whom have we here ? Benson , as I live ! "
63392	63399	63400	63400	Richard	186	" Make this beast get up , "
63414	63443	63400	63400	Richard	186	" He seems incapable , my dear boy . What have you been up to ? Benson ! Benson ! I say , Ricky , this looks bad . "
63444	63449	63450	63450	Richard	186	" He 's shamming ! "
63456	63491	63453	63454	a savage	2431	" Spy upon me , will he ? I tell you , he 's shamming . He has n't had half enough . Nothing 's too bad for a spy . Let him getup ! "
63492	63503	63400	63400	Richard	186	" Insatiate youth ! do throw away that enormous weapon . "
63504	63512	63513	63513	Richard	186	" He has written to my father , "
63516	63526	63513	63513	Richard	186	" The miserable spy ! Let him get up ! "
63527	63534	63537	63537	Benson	187	" Ooogh ? I wo n't ! "
63539	63552	63537	63537	Benson	187	" Mr. Hadrian , you 're a witness he 's my back ! "
63563	63579	63580	63580	Adrian	346	" I daresay you love your back better than any part of your body now , "
63583	63617	63580	63580	Adrian	346	" Come , Benson ! be a man . Mr. Richard has thrown away the stick . Come , and get off home , and let 's see the extent of the damage . "
63618	63636	63638	63638	Benson	187	" Ooogh ! he 's a devil ! Mr. Hadrian , sir , he 's a devil ! "
63754	63802	63739	63739	Benson	187	" I wo n't get up ! I wo n't ! He 's ready to murder me again ! Mr. Hadrian ! if you stand by and see it , you 're liable to the law , sir I wo n't get up while he 's near . "
63823	63846	63818	63818	Adrian	346	" You 've almost killed the poor devil , Ricky . You must be satisfied with that . Look at his face . "
63847	63854	63856	63856	Richard	186	" The coward bobbed while I struck "
63858	63876	63856	63856	Richard	186	" I marked his back . He ducked . I told him he was getting it worse . "
63890	63908	63886	63886	his	346	" Did you really ? I admire that . You told him he was getting it worse ? "
63922	63925	63926	63926	he	346	" Come , "
63929	63980	63926	63926	he	346	" Excalibur has done his word . Pitch him into the lake . And see here comes the Blandish . You ca n't be at it again before a woman . Go and meet her , and tell her the noise was an ox being slaughtered . Or say Argus . "
64054	64064	64066	64066	Adrian	346	" How much did that hat cost , Benson ? "
64076	64089	64066	64066	Adrian	346	" A five - and - twenty shilling beaver , Mr. Hadrian ! "
64095	64108	64110	64110	Adrian	346	" The cheapest policy of insurance I remember to have heard of ! "
64123	64197	64112	64112	Benson	187	" He 's a devil , Mr. Hadrian ! He 's a devil , sir , I do believe , sir . Ooogh ! he 's a devil ! I ca n't move , Mr. Hadrian . I must be fetched . And Dr. Clifford must be sent for , sir . I shall never be fit for work again . I have n't a sound bone in my body , Mr. Hadrian . "
64198	64242	64110	64110	Adrian	346	" You see , Benson , this comes of your declaring war upon Venus . I hope the maids will nurse you properly . Let me see : you are friends with the housekeeper , are n't you ? All depends upon that . "
64243	64254	64255	64257	the miserable butler	2438	" I 'm only a faithful servant , Mr. Hadrian , "
64260	64281	64255	64257	the miserable butler	2438	" Then you 've got no friend but your bed . Get to it as quick as possible , Benson . "
64282	64288	64289	64289	Benson	187	" I ca n't move . "
64295	64301	64302	64302	he	187	" I must be fetched , "
64305	64319	64302	64302	he	187	" It 's a shame to ask me to move , Mr. Hadrian . "
64320	64331	64333	64333	Adrian	346	" You will admit that you are heavy , Benson , "
64357	64379	64347	64348	Mr. Richard	186	" At these words heavy Benson instantly found his legs , and shambled on . Lady Blandish met Richard in dismay . "
64386	64390	64380	64380	I	0	" she said . "
64404	64405	64407	64408	some one	1594	" "
64415	64438	64407	64408	some one	1594	" said Richard , and the lady smiled , and looked on him fondly , and put her hand through his hair . "
64459	64459	64407	64408	some one	1594	"
64693	64701	64703	64703	Adrian	346	" You should come to me first , "
64705	64719	64703	64703	Adrian	346	" I should have imagined you were shrewd enough for that , Berry ? "
64720	64727	64728	64728	Berry	354	" Pardon me , Mr. Adrian , "
64735	64753	64728	64728	Berry	354	" Pardon me , sir . Acting recipient of special injunctions I was not a free agent . "
64754	64817	64728	64728	Berry	354	" Go to Mr. Richard again , Berry . There will be a little confusion if he holds back . Perhaps you had better throw out a hint or so of apoplexy . A slight hint will do . And here Berry ! when you return to town , you had better not mention anything to quote Johnson of Benson 's spiflication . "
64818	64824	64728	64728	Berry	354	" Certainly not , sir . "
65137	65159	65125	65125	Richard	186	" My dear , dear father ! You are safe ! I feared You are better , sir ? Thank God ! "
65167	65170	65171	65171	he	186	" Safe ? "
65174	65180	65171	65171	he	186	" What has alarmed you ? "
65213	65220	65221	65221	Richard	186	" Those doctors are such fools ! "
65225	65273	65221	65221	Richard	186	" I was sure they were wrong . They do n't know headache from apoplexy . It 's worth the ride , sir , to see you . You left Raynham so suddenly . But you are well ! It was not an attack of real apoplexy ? "
65293	65369	65290	65290	Richard	186	" If you were ill , I could n't come too soon , though , if coroners ' inquests sat on horses , those doctors would be found guilty of mare - slaughter . Cassandra'll be knocked up . I was too early for the train at Bellingham , and I would n't wait . She did the distance in four hours and three - quarters . Pretty good , sir , was n't it ? "
65370	65382	65384	65385	the baronet	609	" It has given you appetite for dinner , I hope , "
65410	65415	65417	65417	Richard	186	" I 'm ready , "
65419	65446	65417	65417	Richard	186	" I shall be in time to return by the last train to - night . I will leave Cassandra in your charge for a rest . "
65468	65474	65476	65477	the baronet	609	" All well at Raynham ? "
65479	65484	65476	65477	the baronet	609	" Quite , sir . "
65485	65489	65447	65448	His father	775	" Nothing new ? "
65490	65495	65447	65448	His father	775	" Nothing , sir . "
65496	65504	65476	65477	the baronet	609	" The same as when I left ? "
65505	65510	65447	65448	His father	775	" No change whatever ! "
65511	65524	65526	65527	the baronet	609	" I shall be glad to get back to the old place , "
65529	65574	65526	65527	the baronet	609	" My stay in town has certainly been profitable . I have made some pleasant acquaintances who may probably favour us with a visit there in the late autumn people you may be pleased to know . They are very anxious to see Raynham . "
65575	65582	65584	65584	Richard	186	" I love the old place , "
65586	65594	65584	65584	Richard	186	" I never wish to leave it . "
65595	65611	65526	65527	the baronet	609	" Why , boy , before I left you were constantly begging to see town . "
65612	65638	65526	65527	the baronet	609	" Was I , sir ? How odd ! Well ! I do n't want to remain here . I 've seen enough of it . "
65639	65649	65650	65650	Richard	186	" How did you find your way to me ? "
65675	65683	65684	65685	The baronet	609	" There 's no place like home ! "
65701	65736	65684	65685	The baronet	609	" To anchor the heart by any object ere we have half traversed the world , is youth 's foolishness , my son . Reverence time ! A better maxim that than your Horatian . "
65737	65742	65744	65744	Richard	186	" He knows all ! "
65782	65805	65768	65768	Richard	186	" I shall just be in time , sir , if we walk . Will you come with me to the station ? "
65842	65853	65855	65856	the baronet	609	" I think we will have a little more claret , "
65883	65977	65868	65869	The baronet	609	" I am not aware what you may have thought of me , Richard , during the years we have lived together ; and indeed I have never been in a hurry to be known to you ; and , if I had died before my work was done , I should not have complained at losing half my reward , in hearing you thank me . Perhaps , as it is , I never may . Everything , save selfishness , has its recompense . I shall be content if you prosper . "
65985	65995	65978	65978	He	609	" You had in your infancy a great loss . "
66002	66088	66089	66089	He	609	" To make that good to you I chose to isolate myself from the world , and devote myself entirely to your welfare ; and I think it is not vanity that tells me now that the son I have reared is one of the most hopeful of God 's creatures . But for that very reason you are open to be tempted the most , and to sink the deepest . It was the first of the angels who made the road to hell . "
66099	66233	66234	66234	He	186	" In our House , my son , there is peculiar blood . We go to wreck very easily . It sounds like superstition ; I can not but think we are tried as most men are not . I see it in us all . And you , my son , are compounded of two races . Your passions are violent . You have had a taste of revenge . You have seen , in a small way , that the pound of flesh draws rivers of blood . But there is now in you another power . You are mounting to the table - land of life , where mimic battles are changed to real ones . And you come upon it laden equally with force to create and to destroy . "
66245	66256	66234	66234	He	186	" There are women in the world , my son ! "
66267	66335	66257	66259	The young man	2387	" It is when you encounter them that you are thoroughly on trial . It is when you know them that life is either a mockery to you , or , as some find it , a gift of blessedness . They are our ordeal . Love of any human object is the soul 's ordeal ; and they are ours , loving them , or not . "
66370	66374	66375	66376	the baronet	609	" I believe , "
66386	66391	66375	66376	the baronet	609	" good women exist . "
66399	66402	66404	66404	he	609	" But , "
66410	66520	66404	66404	he	609	" it is given to very few to meet them on the threshold I may say , to none . We find them after hard buffeting , and usually , when we find the one fitted for us , our madness has misshaped our destiny , our lot is cast . For women are not the end , but the means , of life . In youth we think them the former , and thousands , who have not even the excuse of youth , select a mate or worse with that sole view . I believe women punish us for so perverting their uses . They punish Society . "
66598	66618	66594	66595	Cold Blood	359	" It is a passion coming in the order of nature , the ripe fruit of our animal being . "
66623	66639	66619	66620	Hot Blood	360	" It is a divinity ! All that is worth living for in the world . "

66731	66909	66702	66703	Hot Blood	360	" You know my love for you , my son . The extent of it you can not know ; but you must know that it is something very deep , and I do not wish to speak of it but a father must sometimes petition for gratitude , since the only true expression of it is his son 's moral good . If you care for my love , or love me in return , aid me with all your energies to keep you what I have made you , and guard you from the snares besetting you . It was in my hands once . It is ceasing to be so . Remember , my son , what my love is . It is different , I fear , with most fathers : but I am bound up in your welfare : what you do affects me vitally . You will take no step that is not intimate with my happiness , or my misery . And I have had great disappointments , my son . "

67348	67382	67340	67341	his father	775	" You have nothing you could say to me , my son ? Tell me , Richard ! Remember , there is no home for the soul where dwells a shadow of untruth ! "
67383	67390	67391	67393	the young man	2387	" Nothing at all , sir , "
67433	67457	67430	67430	he	186	" Do you intend me to stay here , sir ? Am I not to return to Raynham at all to - night ? "
67465	67480	67430	67430	he	186	" What ? and catch the train after giving it ten minutes ' start ? "
67481	67487	67489	67491	the young man	2387	" Cassandra will take me , "
67494	67526	67489	67491	the young man	2387	" I need n't ride her hard , sir . Or perhaps you would lend me your Winkelried ? I should be down with him in little better than three hours . "
67527	67542	67430	67430	he	186	" Even then , you know , the park - gates would be locked . "
67543	67572	67581	67581	he	186	" Well , I could stable him in the village . Dowling knows the horse , and would treat him properly . May I have him , sir ? "
67843	67864	67865	67865	Richard	186	" You know there would be nobody ready for you at Raynham . It is unfair to disturb the maids . "
67870	67878	67880	67881	the baronet	609	" Well , then , my son , "
67890	67906	67880	67881	the baronet	609	" I must tell you that it is my wish to have you in town . "
67907	67919	67921	67921	Richard	186	" Then you have not been ill at all , sir ! "
67933	67948	67950	67951	his father	775	" I have been as well as you could have desired me to be , "
67953	67961	67962	67964	the young man	2387	" Why did they lie to me ? "
67968	67980	67962	67964	the young man	2387	" I think , Richard , you can best answer that , "
68279	68289	68266	68266	him	186	" Wherefore Wild Oats are only of one gender ? "
68302	68312	68324	68324	he	186	" Whether men might not be attaching too rigid an importance?"
68476	68482	68484	68484	Richard	186	" For Raynham , air ? "

68552	68681	68682	68684	The young person	2569	" Benson is doggedly recovering . He requires great indemnities . Happy when a faithful fool is the main sufferer in a household ! I quite agree with you that our faithful fool is the best servant of great schemes . Benson is now a piece of history . I tell him that this is indemnity enough , and that the sweet Muse usually insists upon gentlemen being half - flayed before she will condescend to notice them ; but Benson , I regret to say , rejects the comfort so fine a reflection should offer , and had rather keep his skin and live opaque . Heroism seems partly a matter of training . Faithful folly is Benson 's nature : the rest has been thrust upon . "
68905	68922	68897	68897	she	268	" The other letter was from Lady Blandish , a lady 's letter , and said : "

69588	69790	69795	69796	Sir Austin	186	" I can not get on with Gibbon , so wait your return to recommence the readings . I dislike the sneering essence of his writings . I keep referring to his face , until the dislike seems to become personal . How different is it with Wordsworth ! And yet I can not escape from the thought that he is always solemnly thinking of himself but I do reverence him . But this is curious ; Byron was a greater egoist , and yet I do not feel the same with him . He reminds me of a beast of the desert , savage and beautiful ; and the former is what one would imagine a superior donkey reclaimed from the heathen to be a very superior donkey , I mean , with great power of speech and great natural complacency , and whose stubbornness you must admire as part of his mission . The worst is that no one will imagine anything sublime in a superior donkey , so my simile is unfair and false . Is it not strange ? I love Wordsworth best , and yet Byron has the greater power over me . How is that ? "
69791	69794	69795	69796	Sir Austin	186	" Because , "
69804	69828	69795	69796	Sir Austin	186	" women are cowards , and succumb to Irony and Passion , rather than yield their hearts to Excellence and Nature 's Inspiration . "
69833	69988	69795	69796	Sir Austin	186	" I have finished Boiardo and have taken up Berni . The latter offends me . I suppose we women do not really care for humour . You are right in saying we have none ourselves , and ' cackle ' instead of laugh . It is true of me , at least that ' Falstaff is only to us an incorrigible fat man . ' I want to know what he illustrates . And Don Quixote what end can be served in making a noble mind ridiculous ? I hear you say practical . So it is . We are very narrow , I know . But we like wit practical again ! Or in your words when I really think they generally come to my aid perhaps it is that it is often all your thought ; we ' prefer the rapier thrust , to the broad embrace , of Intelligence . ' "
70585	70618	70574	70574	he	2614	" Why he was not justified in doing all that lay in his power to prevent his son from casting himself away upon the first creature with a pretty face he encountered ? "
71087	71092	71094	71095	The Pilgrim	265	" Let us remember , "
71099	71188	71094	71095	The Pilgrim	265	" that Nature , though heathenish , reaches at her best to the footstool of the Highest . She is not all dust , but a living portion of the spheres . In aspiration it is our error to despise her , forgetting that through Nature only can we ascend . Cherished , trained , and purified , she is then partly worthy the divine mate who is to make her wholly so . St. Simeon saw the Hog in Nature , and took Nature for the Hog . "

71995	72004	71900	71900	Tom	144	" And so she went out of sight ! "
72005	72015	71900	71900	Tom	144	" Clean gone , that she were , sir . "
72016	72038	71865	71865	her	2670	" Why did they take her away ? what have they done with her ? where have they taken her to ? "
72055	72062	71900	71900	Tom	144	" Why did n't she write ? "
72067	72097	71900	71900	Tom	144	" Why did she leave ? She 's mine . She belongs to me ! Who dared take her away ? Why did she leave without writing ? Tom ! "

72145	72153	71900	71900	Tom	144	" Where have they taken her to ? "
72188	72199	72179	72179	his	2677	" She had been crying you saw that , Tom ? "
72200	72221	71900	71900	Tom	144	" No mistake about that , Mr. Richard . Cryin ' all night and all day , I sh'd say . "
72222	72232	72171	72171	He	2677	" And she was crying when you saw her ? "
72233	72248	72179	72179	his	2677	" She look'd as if she 'd just done for a moment , sir . "
72249	72256	71900	71900	Tom	144	" But her face was white ? "
72257	72263	72264	72264	Richard	186	" White as a sheet . "

74041	74056	74057	74058	The farmer	863	" Why did you send her away to make her unhappy , Mr. Blaize ? "
74072	74114	74063	74063	he	186	" Nobody ca n't accuse me . Tell ye what , sir . I wunt have the busybodies set to work about her , and there 's all the matter . So let you and I come to an understandin ' . "

74192	74338	74189	74190	the farmer	863	" you 're coming to business . Glad to hear ye talk in that sensible way , Mr. Feverel . You may guess I wants her bad enough . The house ai n't itself now she 's away , and I ai n't myself . Well , sir ! This ye can do . If you gives me your promise not to meddle with her at all I ca n't mak ' out how you come to be acquainted ; not to try to get her to be meetin ' you and if you 'd ' a seen her when she left , you would when did ye meet ? last grass , was n't it ? your word as a gentleman not to be writing letters , and spyin ' after her I 'll have her back at once . Back she shall come ! "
74339	74344	74346	74346	Richard	226	" Give her up ! "

74415	74426	74412	74413	the farmer	863	" Do you think I shall harm her , sir ? "
74427	74440	74441	74442	the farmer	863	" People seem to think she 'll harm you , young gentleman , "
74448	74456	74441	74442	the farmer	863	" Harm me she ? What people ? "
74457	74466	74412	74413	the farmer	863	" People pretty intimate with you , sir . "
74467	74476	74477	74477	Richard	226	" What people ? Who spoke of us ? "
74490	74498	74500	74501	the farmer	863	" Well , sir , look here , "
74503	74533	74500	74501	the farmer	863	" It ai n't no secret , and if it be , I do n't see why I 'm to keep it . It appears your education 's peculiar ! "
74551	74792	74542	74542	he	863	" You ai n't to be as other young gentlemen . All the better ! You 're a fine bold young gentleman , and your father 's a right to be proud of ye . Well , sir I 'm sure I thank him for't he comes to hear of you and Luce , and of course he do n't want nothin' o ' that more do I. I meets him there ! What 's more I wo n't have nothin' of it . She be my gal . She were left to my protection . And she 's a lady , sir . Let me tell ye , ye wo n't find many on 'em so well looked to as she be my Luce ! Well , Mr. Fev'rel , it 's you , or it 's her one of ye must be out o ' the way . So we 're told . And Luce I do believe she 's just as anxious about yer education as yer father she says she 'll go , and would n't write , and'd break it off for the sake o ' your education . And she've kep ' her word , have n't she ? She 's a true'n . What she says she 'll do ! True blue she be , my Luce ! So now , sir , you do the same , and I 'll thank ye . "

74855	74886	74852	74852	he	2354	" this is very kind of the people you allude to , but I am of an age now to think and act for myself I love her , sir ! "
74900	74903	74905	74906	the farmer	863	" Well ! "
74910	74925	74905	74906	the farmer	863	" we all do at your age somebody or other . It 's natural ! "

75071	75079	75081	75081	Richard	226	" Then you refuse me , farmer , "
75083	75121	75081	75081	Richard	226	" I must look to you for keeping her away from me , not to to these people . You will not have her back , though I tell you I love her better than my life ? "
75221	75254	75218	75218	he	2761	" Farmer ! if I give you my word of honour , as I hope for heaven , to marry her when I am of age , will you have her back ? "
75303	75316	75317	75318	The farmer	863	" It 's not because you object to me , Mr. Blaize ? "
75325	75335	75336	75336	Richard	226	" It 's because my father is against me , "
75486	75492	75493	75493	he	863	" May smoke heer now , "
75496	75514	75493	75493	he	863	" Not when somebody 's present . Smoke in the kitchen then . Do n't mind smell ? "
75543	75564	75566	75567	the farmer	863	" Who 'd a ' thought , when you sat over there once , of its comin ' to this ? "
75576	75613	75566	75567	the farmer	863	" You did n't think much of her that day , young gentleman ! I introduced ye . Well ! things comes about . Ca n't you wait till she returns in due course , now ? "
75631	75636	75638	75639	the farmer	863	" It 's queer , "
75691	75823	75661	75661	he	226	" Look , young gentleman ! My word 's gone . I 've spoke it . I 've given 'em the ' surance she sha n't be back till the Spring , and then I 'll have her , and then well ! I do hope , for more reasons than one , ye'll both be wiser I 've got my own notions about her . But I an't the man to force a gal to marry ' gainst her inclines . Depend upon it I 'm not your enemy , Mr. Fev'rel . You 're jest the one to mak ' a young gal proud . So wait , and see . That 's my ' dvice . Jest tak ' and wait . I 've no more to say . "

76167	76192	76157	76157	Richard	226	" She 's done up , poor old gal ! Look to her , Tom , and then come to me in my room . "
76454	76480	76445	76445	he	187	" That Good in a strong many - compounded nature is of slower growth than any other mortal thing , and must not be forced . "
76695	76703	76692	76692	Richard	186	" Have whom you will , sir . "
76872	76881	76882	76882	He	609	" Yes , yes ! that will pass . "
77047	77054	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" Well , Benson ? well ? "
77064	77074	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" If you please , Sir Austin Mr. Richard ! "
77075	77078	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" Well ! "
77079	77084	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" He 's out ! "
77085	77088	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" Well ? "
77089	77093	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" With Bakewell ! "
77094	77097	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" Well ? "
77098	77105	77056	77057	the baronet	609	" And a carpet - bag ! "
77278	77289	77262	77262	He	199	" Tom ! Tom ! I shall see her tomorrow ! "
77335	77338	77340	77340	Richard	186	" No ! "
77342	77352	77355	77355	he	186	" there 's not a moment to be lost ! "
77422	77435	77395	77395	Brandy	384	" Tom ! the bell 's ringing : we shall be late , "
77579	77582	77583	77583	he	775	" Mark ! "
77589	77600	77583	77583	he	775	" when he recovers he will not care for her . "
77618	77627	77628	77628	she	990	" What an iron man you can be , "
77668	77675	77676	77676	she	990	" Can you look on him , "
77679	77688	77676	77676	she	990	" can you look on him and persevere ? "
77790	77793	77794	77794	he	2848	" But , "
77815	77868	77870	77871	the doctor	2151	" drugs are not much in cases of this sort . Change ! That 's what 's wanted , and as soon as may be . Distraction ! He ought to see the world , and know what he is made of . It 's no use my talking , I know , "
77873	77878	77880	77881	Sir Austin	186	" On the contrary , "
77883	77899	77880	77881	Sir Austin	186	" I am quite of your persuasion . And the world he shall see now . "
77900	77913	77914	77914	Adrian	346	" We have dipped him in Styx , you know , doctor , "
77917	77922	77924	77925	Lady Blandish	489	" But , doctor , "
77927	77938	77924	77925	Lady Blandish	489	" have you known a case of this sort before . "
77939	77945	77947	77948	the doctor	2151	" Never , my lady , "
77950	77967	77947	77948	the doctor	2151	" they 're not common in these parts . Country people are tolerably healthy - minded . "
77968	77981	77982	77983	The doctor	2151	" But people and country people have died for love , doctor ? "
77991	77997	77999	78000	the baronet	609	" Men , or women ? "
78008	78020	78022	78023	the baronet	609	" Ask the doctor whether they were healthy - minded women , "
78025	78103	78022	78023	the baronet	609	" No ! you are both looking at the wrong end . Between a highly - cultured being , and an emotionless animal , there is all the difference in the world . But of the two , the doctor is nearer the truth . The healthy nature is pretty safe . If he allowed for organization he would be right altogether . To feel , but not to feel to excess , that is the problem . "
78104	78123	78124	78124	Adrian	346	" If I ca n't have the one I chose , To some fresh maid I will propose , "
79017	79049	79012	79013	The Pilgrim	265	" The ways of women , which are Involution , and their practices , which are Opposition , are generally best hit upon by guess work , and a bold word ; "
79302	79312	79313	79313	he	187	" I ca n't think what has come to Benson "
79318	79333	79313	79313	he	187	" He seems to have received a fresh legacy of several pounds of lead , "
79346	79383	79313	79313	he	187	" Change is what he wants ! distraction ! send him to Wales for a month , sir , and let Richard go with him . The two victims of woman may do each other good . "
79384	79393	79395	79396	the baronet	609	" Unfortunately I ca n't do without him , "
79398	79419	79420	79420	Adrian	346	" Then we must continue to have him on our shoulders all day , and on our chests all night ! "
79423	79442	79444	79445	the baronet	609	" I think while he preserves this aspect we wo n't have him at the dinner - table , "
79461	79471	79447	79447	Adrian	346	" You know , sir , what he says ? "
79499	79509	79510	79510	he	346	" You must pardon a faithful fool , sir , "
79522	79541	79510	79510	he	346	" His stupidity is past belief ! I have absolutely to bolt my study - door against him . "
79619	79634	79599	79600	The Pilgrim	265	" Could we see Time 's full face , we were wise of him . "
79844	79873	79874	79874	She	2925	" For this high cause , and for that I know men , and know him to be the flower of men , I give myself to him ! "
80016	80019	80021	80022	The Pilgrim	265	" Sentimentalists , "
80026	80043	80021	80022	The Pilgrim	265	" are they who seek to enjoy without incurring the Immense Debtorship for a thing done . "
80044	80048	80049	80050	the writer	2928	" It is , "
80056	80087	80049	80050	the writer	2928	" a happy pastime and an important science to the timid , the idle , and the heartless ; but a damning one to them who have anything to forfeit . "
80398	80404	80405	80405	he	609	" My wound has healed , "
80408	80411	80412	80412	she	489	" How ? "
80415	80423	80424	80424	he	609	" At the fountain of your eyes , "
80688	80692	80694	80695	The Pilgrim	265	" Which is , "
80699	80716	80694	80695	The Pilgrim	265	" with men to be valued equal to that force which in water makes a stream . "
80799	80809	80786	80787	his brother	695	" Poor Hippias ! All his machinery is bare ! "
80933	80947	80949	80949	Hippias	334	" My mind does n't so much seem to haunt itself , now , "
80971	80981	80949	80949	Hippias	334	" I feel as if I had come aboveground . "
81102	81106	81108	81108	Adrian	346	" I think , "
81119	81145	81108	81108	Adrian	346	" that when our Nemesis takes lodgings in the stomach , it 's best to act the Spartan , smile hard , and be silent . "
81296	81374	81288	81288	He	387	" one of the more constant throes of his malady . His bitter face recurred : he chewed the cud of horrid hallucinations . He told Richard he must give up going about with him : people telling of their ailments made him so uncomfortable the birds were so noisy , pairing the rude bare soil sickened him . Richard treated him with a gravity equal to his father 's . He asked what the doctors said . "
81380	81387	81377	81378	the doctors	6982	" cried Hippias with vehement scepticism . "
81719	81720	81722	81722	you	0	" "
81724	81732	81722	81722	you	0	" said Richard , coolly regarding him . "
81740	81744	81722	81722	you	0	" Hippias sighed . "
81755	81756	81745	81745	You	186	" "
81761	81771	81745	81745	You	186	" quoth Richard . Hippias looked at him anxiously : "
81816	82324	82325	82325	You	2995	" and Hippias rubbed his hands . Richard smiled at the feeble glimmer of enjoyment promised by his uncle 's eyes , and said he thought it better they should stay where they were an answer that might mean anything . Hippias immediately became possessed by the beguiling project . He went to the baronet , and put the matter before him , instancing doctors as the object of his journey , not quacks , of course ; and requesting leave to take Richard . Sir Austin was getting uneasy about his son 's manner . It was not natural . His heart seemed to be frozen : he had no confidences : he appeared to have no ambition to have lost the virtues of youth with the poison that had passed out of him . He was disposed to try what effect a little travelling might have on him , and had himself once or twice hinted to Richard that it would be good for him to move about , the young man quietly replying that he did not wish to quit Raynham at all , which was too strict a fulfilment of his father 's original views in educating him there entirely . On the day that Hippias made his proposal , Adrian , seconded by Lady Blandish , also made one . The sweet Spring season stirred in Adrian as well as in others : not to pastoral measures : to the joys of the operatic world and bravura glories . He also suggested that it would be advisable to carry Richard to town for a term , and let him know his position , and some freedom . Sir Austin weighed the two proposals . He was pretty certain that Richard 's passion was consumed , and that the youth was now only under the burden of its ashes . He had found against his heart , at the Bellingham inn : a great lock of golden hair . He had taken it , and the lover , after feeling about for it with faint hands , never asked for it . This precious lock Miss Davenport had thrust it into his hand at Belthorpe as Lucy 's last gift , what sighs and tears it had weathered ! The baronet laid it in Richard 's sight one day , and beheld him take it up , turn it over , and drop it down again calmly , as if he were handling any common curiosity . It pacified him on that score . The young man 's love was dead . Dr. Clifford said rightly : he wanted distractions . The baronet determined that Richard should go . Hippias and Adrian then pressed their several suits as to which should have him . Hippias , when he could forget himself , did not lack sense . He observed that Adrian was not at present a proper companion for Richard , and would teach him to look on life from the false point . "
82333	82338	82325	82325	You	2995	" said the baronet . "
82347	82372	82343	82345	an old fool	2998	" returned Hippias , not thinking that his growl had begotten a phrase . His brother smiled with gratification , and applauded him loudly : "
82424	82429	82419	82419	I	0	" the baronet added , "
82441	82492	82493	82493	I	0	" And this reflection inclined him not to let his son be alone with Adrian . He gave Richard his choice , who saw which way his father 's wishes tended , and decided so to please him . Naturally it annoyed Adrian extremely . He said to his chief : "
82569	82578	82579	82579	You	3000	" Adrian enumerated some of the most abhorrent . "
82676	82860	82663	82663	I	0	" Sir Austin assured the wise youth that Hippias had arranged to go to Dr. Bairam . He softened Adrian 's chagrin by telling him that in about two weeks they would follow to London : hinting also at a prospective Summer campaign . The day was fixed for Richard to depart , and the day came . Madame the Eighteenth Century called him to her chamber and put into his hand a fifty - pound note , as her contribution toward his pocket - expenses . He did not want it , he said , but she told him he was a young man , and would soon make that fly when he stood on his own feet . The old lady did not at all approve of the System in her heart , and she gave her grandnephew to understand that , should he require more , he knew where to apply , and secrets would be kept . His father presented him with a hundred pounds which also Richard said he did not want he did not care for money . "
82866	83097	82663	82663	I	0	" said the baronet , perfectly secure in him . Hippias had few injunctions to observe . They were to take up quarters at the hotel , Algernon 's general run of company at the house not being altogether wholesome . The baronet particularly forewarned Hippias of the imprudence of attempting to restrict the young man 's movements , and letting him imagine he was under surveillance . Richard having been , as it were , pollarded by despotism , was now to grow up straight , and bloom again , in complete independence , as far as he could feel . So did the sage decree ; and we may pause a moment to reflect how wise were his previsions , and how successful they must have been , had not Fortune , the great foe to human cleverness , turned against him , or he against himself . The departure took place on a fine March morning . The bird of Winter sang from the budding tree ; in the blue sky sang the bird of Summer . Adrian rode between Richard and Hippias to the Bellingham station , and vented his disgust on them after his own humorous fashion , because it did not rain and damp their ardour . In the rear came Lady Blandish and the baronet , conversing on the calm summit of success . "
83107	83127	83098	83098	You	3007	" she said , pointing with her riding - whip to the grave stately figure of the young man . "
83132	83154	83098	83098	You	3007	" he answered , and led to a discussion on Purity and Strength , the lady saying that she preferred Purity . "
83160	83165	83156	83156	you	3007	" said the baronet . "
83298	83374	83288	83288	you	3012	" he added , with unaccustomed slyness . The lady listened , pleased at the sportive malice which showed that the constraint on his mind had left him . It was for women to fight their fight now ; she only took part in it for amusement . This is how the ranks of our enemies are thinned ; no sooner do poor women put up a champion in their midst than she betrays them . "
83378	83383	83375	83375	I	0	" she said archly , "
83411	83422	83406	83406	you	3016	" she cried out at his gestured protestation , laughing . "
83429	83430	83424	83424	I	0	" "
83442	83454	83434	83434	you	3016	" Exquisite Blandish ! He could not choose but love her . "
83462	83466	83434	83434	you	3016	" she asked . "
83472	83476	83468	83469	a woman	1754	" He replied , "
83610	83611	83614	83614	him	3016	" "
83617	83622	83614	83614	him	3016	" said the lady . "
83639	83640	83642	83642	Adrian	346	" "
83646	83777	83642	83642	Adrian	346	" added the baronet . Adrian could be seen to be trying zealously to torment a laugh , or a confession of irritation , out of his hearers , stretching out his chin to one , and to the other , with audible asides . Richard he treated as a new instrument of destruction about to be let loose on the slumbering metropolis ; Hippias as one in an interesting condition ; and he got so much fun out of the notion of these two journeying together , and the mishaps that might occur to them , that he esteemed it almost a personal insult for his hearers not to laugh . The wise youth 's dull life at Raynham had afflicted him with many peculiarities of the professional joker . "
83786	83808	83809	83809	You	3027	" he cried , as in scorn of his sallies they exchanged their unmeaning remarks on the sweet weather across him . "
83835	84240	83830	83830	you	3027	" ' Wind bloweth , Cock croweth , Doodle - doo ; Hippy verteth , Ricky sterteth , Sing Cuckoo ! ' There 's an old native pastoral ! Why do n't you write a Spring sonnet , Ricky ? The asparagus - beds are full of promise , I hear , and eke the strawberry . Berries I fancy your Pegasus has a taste for . What kind of berry was that I saw some verses of yours about once ? amatory verses to some kind of berry yewberry , blueberry , glueberry ! Pretty verses , decidedly warm . Lips , eyes , bosom , legs legs ? I do n't think you gave her any legs . No legs and no nose . That appears to be the poetic taste of the day . It shall be admitted that you create the very beauties for a chaste people . ' O might I lie where leans her lute ! ' and offend no moral community . That 's not a bad image of yours , my dear boy : ' Her shape is like an antelope Upon the Eastern hills . ' But as a candid critic , I would ask you if the likeness can be considered correct when you give her no legs ? You will see at the ballet that you are in error about women at present , Richard . That admirable institution which our venerable elders have imported from Gallia for the instruction of our gaping youth , will edify and astonish you . I assure you I used , from reading The Pilgrim 's Scrip , to imagine all sorts of things about them , till I was taken there , and learnt that they are very like us after all , and then they ceased to trouble me . Mystery is the great danger to youth , my son ! Mystery is woman 's redoubtable weapon , O Richard of the Ordeal ! I 'm aware that you 've had your lessons in anatomy , but nothing will persuade you that an anatomical figure means flesh and blood . You ca n't realize the fact . Do you intend to publish when you 're in town ? It 'll be better not to put your name . Having one 's name to a volume of poems is as bad as to an advertising pill . "
84241	84256	84258	84258	Richard	127	" I will send you an early copy , Adrian , when I publish , "
84260	84269	84258	84258	Richard	127	" Hark at that old blackbird , uncle . "
84270	84273	84274	84274	Hippias	334	" Yes ! "
84296	84301	84274	84274	Hippias	334	" fine old fellow ! "
84302	84374	84258	84258	Richard	127	" What a chuckle he gives out before he flies ! Not unlike July nightingales . You know that bird I told you of the blackbird that had its mate shot , and used to come to sing to old Dame Bakewell 's bird from the tree opposite . A rascal knocked it over the day before yesterday , and the dame says her bird has n't sung a note since . "
84375	84378	84379	84379	Hippias	334	" Extraordinary ! "
84383	84389	84379	84379	Hippias	334	" I remember the verses . "
84390	84397	84401	84401	Adrian	346	" But where 's your moral ? "
84403	84440	84401	84401	Adrian	346	" Where 's constancy rewarded ? ' The ouzel - cock so black of hue , With orange - tawny bill ; The rascal with his aim so true ; The Poet 's little quill ! ' "
84497	84498	84493	84493	Ricky	127	" "
84507	84560	84493	84493	Ricky	127	" says Richard , and points out larch - buds to his uncle , as they ride by the young green wood . The wise youth was driven to extremity . Such a lapse from his pupil 's heroics to this last verge of Arcadian coolness , Adrian could not believe in . "
84567	84584	84493	84493	Ricky	127	" he cried , in his turn , and pretending to interpret his fits of song : "
84631	84644	84680	84680	he	0	" Not a bad verse eh , Ricky ? my Lucius Junius ! "
84645	84652	84654	84654	Richard	127	" You do the blackbird well , "
84669	84679	84680	84680	he	0	" You 're a young man of wonderful powers , "
84767	84781	84761	84761	Adrian	346	" The Beast , sir , appears to be going to fetch Beauty ; "
85368	85387	85365	85365	her	489	" You see it was the very thing he wanted . He has got his natural spirits already . "
85388	85392	85393	85393	Adrian	346	" It was , "
85399	85412	85393	85393	Adrian	346	" the exact thing he wanted . His spirits have returned miraculously . "
85413	85418	85420	85421	the baronet	609	" Something amused him , "
85431	85440	85420	85421	the baronet	609	" Probably something his uncle said or did , "
85544	85551	85540	85540	Adrian	346	" Hippy verteth , Sing cuckoo ! "
85567	85571	85560	85563	a demon of laughter	3071	" Hippy verteth ! "
85598	85615	85617	85617	Hippias	334	" Why , why , why , what are you laughing at , my dear boy , "
85629	85634	85658	85658	Hippias	334	" ha ! ha ! "
85635	85646	85648	85648	Richard	186	" Why , what are you laughing at , uncle ? "
85650	85657	85658	85658	Hippias	334	" I really do n't know , "
85661	85671	85658	85658	Hippias	334	" Nor I , uncle ! Sing , cuckoo ! "
85795	85803	85805	85805	Richard	186	" I tell you what , uncle , "
85807	85816	85805	85805	Richard	186	" I think travelling 's a capital thing . "
85817	85829	85830	85830	Hippias	334	" The best thing in the world , my dear boy , "
85833	85881	85830	85830	Hippias	334	" It makes me wish I had given up that Work of mine , and tried it before , instead of chaining myself to a task . We 're quite different beings in a minute . I am . Hem ! what shall we have for dinner ? "
85882	85923	85924	85924	Hippias	334	" Leave that to me , uncle . I shall order for you . You know , I intend to make you well . How gloriously we go along ! I should like to ride on a railway every day . "
85927	85936	85924	85924	Hippias	334	" They say it rather injures the digestion . "
85937	85953	85830	85830	Hippias	334	" Nonsense ! see how you 'll digest to - night and to - morrow . "
85954	85962	85964	85964	Hippias	334	" Perhaps I shall do something yet , "
85978	85991	85964	85964	Hippias	334	" I hope I shall have a good night to - night . "
85992	86005	85830	85830	Hippias	334	" Of course you will ! What ! after laughing like that ? "
86006	86009	86010	86010	Hippias	334	" Ugh ! "
86013	86028	86010	86010	Hippias	334	" I daresay , Richard , you sleep the moment you get into bed ! "
86029	86050	85830	85830	Hippias	334	" The instant my head 's on my pillow , and up the moment I wake . Health 's everything ! "
86051	86056	86058	86058	Hippias	334	" Health 's everything ! "
86065	86076	86077	86077	Richard	186	" And if you 'll put yourself in my hands , "
86080	86116	86077	86077	Richard	186	" you shall do just as I do . You shall be well and strong , and sing ' Jolly ! ' like Adrian 's blackbird . You shall , upon my honour , uncle ! "
86159	86162	86164	86164	Hippias	334	" Mind , "
86173	86182	86164	86164	Hippias	334	" mind your dishes are not too savoury ! "
86183	86206	86208	86209	young Wisdom	401	" Light food and claret ! Regular meals and amusement ! Lend your heart to all , but give it to none ! "
86215	86220	86212	86212	Hippias	334	" Yes ! yes ! "
86238	86247	86248	86248	he	334	" Love ruins us , my dear boy , "
86264	86279	86259	86259	Richard	186	" The love of Monsieur Francatelli , It was the ruin of et coetera . "
86285	86299	86280	86280	Hippias	334	" Really , my dear boy ! I never saw you so excited . "
86300	86313	86248	86248	he	334	" It 's the railway ! It 's the fun , uncle ! "
86314	86317	86318	86318	Hippias	334	" Ah ! "
86324	86365	86318	86318	Hippias	334	" you 've got the Golden Bride ! Keep her if you can . That 's a pretty fable of your father 's . I gave him the idea , though . Austin filches a great many of my ideas ! "
86366	86408	86409	86409	You	3078	" Here 's the idea in verse , uncle : ' O sunless walkers by the tide ! O have you seen the Golden Bride ! They say that she is fair beyond All women ; faithful , and more fond ! "
86473	86520	86459	86459	she	3082	" Then the doleful party march off in single file solemnly , and the fabulist pursues : ' She hath a palace in the West : Bright Hesper lights her to her rest : And him the Morning Star awakes Whom to her charmed arms she takes .
86538	86639	86661	86661	Hippias	334	" And prodigal of the happiness she lends him , he asks to share it with one of them . There is the Silver Maid , and the Copper , and the Brassy Maid , and others of them . First , you know , he tries Argentine , and finds her only twenty to the pound , and has a worse experience with Copperina , till he descends to the scullery ; and the lower he goes , the less obscure become the features of his Bride of Gold , and all her radiance shines forth , my uncle . "
86640	86659	86661	86661	Hippias	334	" Verse rather blunts the point . Well , keep to her , now you 've got her , "
86663	86735	86661	86661	Hippias	334	" We will , uncle ! Look how the farms fly past ! Look at the cattle in the fields ! And how the lines duck , and swim up ! ' She claims the whole , and not the part The coin of an unused heart ! To gain his Golden Bride again , He hunts with melancholy men , ' and is waked no longer by the Morning Star ! "
86736	86750	86751	86751	Hippias	334	" Not if he does n't sleep till an hour before it rises ! "
86754	86795	86751	86751	Hippias	334	" You do n't rhyme badly . But stick to prose . Poetry 's a Base - metal maid . I 'm not sure that any writing 's good for the digestion . I 'm afraid it has spoilt mine . "
86796	86802	86804	86804	Richard	186	" Fear nothing , uncle ! "
86806	86872	86804	86804	Richard	186	" You shall ride in the park with me every day to get an appetite . You and I and the Golden Bride . You know that little poem of Sandoe 's ? ' She rides in the park on a prancing bay , She and her squires together ; Her dark locks gleam from a bonnet of grey , And toss with the tossing feather .
86950	87015	87016	87016	Hippias	334	" Was n't Sandoe once a friend of my father 's ? I suppose they quarrelled . He understands the heart . What does he make his ' Humble Lover ' say ? ' True , Madam , you may think to part Conditions by a glacier - ridge , But Beauty 's for the largest heart , And all abysses Love can bridge ! "
87031	87032	87016	87016	Hippias	334	" "
87036	87040	87016	87016	Hippias	334	" he sneered . "
87094	87095	87090	87090	he	6302	" "
87102	87106	87096	87096	I	0	" said Richard . "
87111	87120	87121	87121	Beauty	268	" and he murmured to a pleased ear : "
87128	87293	87121	87121	Beauty	268	" The flow of their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of passengers at a station . Richard examined their faces with pleasure . All faces pleased him . Human nature sat tributary at the feet of him and his Golden Bride . As he could not well talk his thoughts before them , he looked out at the windows , and enjoyed the changing landscape , projecting all sorts of delights for his old friend Ripton , and musing hazily on the wondrous things he was to do in the world ; of the great service he was to be to his fellow - creatures . In the midst of his reveries he was landed in London . Tom Bakewell stood at the carriage door . A glance told Richard that his squire had something curious on his mind ; and he gave Tom the word to speak out . Tom edged his master out of hearing , and began sputtering a laugh . "
87303	87307	87308	87310	That young Tom	3095	" he said . "
87376	87391	87373	87373	he	3095	" Young Tom appeared to have the weight of all London on his beaver . "
87398	87402	87373	87373	he	3095	" Richard asked . "
87420	87430	87410	87410	You	6036	" mumbled Tom , bursting to be perfectly intelligible . "
87438	87439	87436	87436	Tom	144	" "
87445	87597	87436	87436	Tom	144	" Richard turned away , and was seized by Hippias , who begged him to get out of the noise and pother , and caught hold of his slack arm to bear him into a conveyance ; but Richard , by wheeling half to the right , or left , always got his face round to the point where young Tom was manoeuvring to appear at his ease . Even when they were seated in the conveyance , Hippias could not persuade him to drive off . He made the excuse that he did not wish to start till there was a clear road . At last young Tom cast anchor by a policeman , and , doubtless at the official 's suggestion , bashfully took seat in a cab , and was shot into the whirlpool of London . Richard then angrily asked his driver what he was waiting for . "
87605	87609	87599	87599	you	3101	" said Hippias . "
87615	87634	87635	87635	I	0	" He laughed oddly , and made a random answer that he hoped the fellow would drive fast . "
87645	87660	87635	87635	I	0	" he said . Hippias assured him there was something the matter with him . "
87667	87960	87663	87663	uncle	1049	" said Richard , looking fiercely candid . They say , that when the skill and care of men rescue a drowned wretch from extinction , and warm the flickering spirit into steady flame , such pain it is , the blood forcing its way along the dry channels , and the heavily - ticking nerves , and the sullen heart the struggle of life and death in him grim death relaxing his gripe ; such pain it is , he cries out no thanks to them that pull him by inches from the depths of the dead river . And he who has thought a love extinct , and is surprised by the old fires , and the old tyranny , he rebels , and strives to fight clear of the cloud of forgotten sensations that settle on him ; such pain it is , the old sweet music reviving through his frame , and the charm of his passion filing him afresh . Still was fair Lucy the one woman to Richard . He had forbidden her name but from an instinct of self - defence . Must the maids of baser metal dominate him anew , it is in Lucy 's shape . Thinking of her now so near him his darling ! all her graces , her sweetness , her truth ; for , despite his bitter blame of her , he knew her true swam in a thousand visions before his eyes ; visions pathetic , and full of glory , that now wrung his heart , and now elated it . As well might a ship attempt to calm the sea , as this young man the violent emotion that began to rage in his breast . "
87967	88031	87663	87663	uncle	1049	" he said to himself exultingly , and at the same instant thought , how black was every corner of the earth but that one spot where Lucy stood ! how utterly cheerless the place he was going to ! Then he determined to bear it ; to live in darkness ; there was a refuge in the idea of a voluntary martyrdom . "
88068	88161	88162	88162	They	3106	" And a great wave swelled through him , and was crushed down only to swell again more stormily . Then Tom Bakewell 's words recurred to him that young Tom Blaize was uncertain where to go for her , and that she might be thrown on this Babylon alone . And flying from point to point , it struck him that they had known at Raynham of her return , and had sent him to town to be out of the way they had been miserably plotting against him once more . "
88178	88293	88294	88294	We	3107	" was the first turn taken by his wrathful feelings , as he resolved to go , and see her safe , and calmly return to his uncle , whom he sincerely believed not to be one of the conspirators . Nevertheless , after forming that resolve , he sat still , as if there were something fatal in the wheels that bore him away from it perhaps because he knew , as some do when passion is lord , that his intelligence juggled with him ; though none the less keenly did he feel his wrongs and suspicions . His Golden Bride was waning fast . But when Hippias ejaculated to cheer him : "
88300	88406	88294	88294	We	3107	" the spell broke . Richard stopped the cab , saying he wanted to speak to Tom , and would ride with him the rest of the journey . He knew well enough which line of railway his Lucy must come by . He had studied every town and station on the line . Before his uncle could express more than a mute remonstrance , he jumped out and hailed Tom Bakewell , who came behind with the boxes and baggage in a companion cab , his head a yard beyond the window to make sure of his ark of safety , the vehicle preceding . "
88416	88420	88408	88412	an extraordinary , impetuous boy	3109	" said Hippias . "
88428	88457	88458	88459	Mr. Richard	186	" Within a minute the stalwart Berry , despatched by the baronet to arrange everything for their comfort , had opened the door , and made his bow . "
88465	88472	88458	88459	Mr. Richard	186	" was Berry 's modulated inquiry . "
88480	88494	88458	88459	Mr. Richard	186	" Hippias growled , as he received Berry 's muscular assistance to alight . "
88499	88500	88458	88459	Mr. Richard	186	" "
88521	88565	88519	88519	Heah	3115	" Berry sang out to the second cab , which , with its pyramid of luggage , remained stationary some thirty paces distant . At his voice the majestic pile deliberately turned its back on them , and went off in a contrary direction .
88840	88868	88821	88821	Ripton	158	" Dear Ripton , You are to get lodgings for a lady immediately . Not a word to a soul . Then come along with Tom . R.D.F. "
88869	88875	88876	88876	Ripton	158	" Lodgings for a lady ! "
88880	88901	88902	88902	he	158	" What sort of lodgings ? Where am I to get lodgings ? Who 's the lady ? I say ! "
88908	88920	88902	88902	he	158	" So you 're Tom Bakewell , are you , Tom ? "
88926	88979	88921	88921	Tom	199	" Do you remember the rick , Tom ? Ha ! ha ! We got out of that neatly . We might all have been transported , though . I could have convicted you , Tom , safe ! It 's no use coming across a practised lawyer . Now tell me . "
88990	88996	88980	88980	Ripton	158	" Who 's this lady ? "
88997	89008	89009	89009	Tom	199	" Better wait till you see Mr. Richard , sir , "
89016	89019	89020	89020	Ripton	158	" Ah ! "
89023	89030	89031	89031	Tom	199	" Is she young , Tom ? "
89038	89043	89031	89031	Tom	199	" Handsome , Tom ? "
89044	89054	89055	89055	Tom	199	" Some might think one thing , some another , "
89058	89067	89069	89069	Ripton	158	" And where does she come from now ? "
89080	89088	89069	89069	Ripton	158	" Comes from the country , sir . "
89089	89102	89103	89103	Ripton	158	" A friend of the family , I suppose ? a relation ? "
89123	89126	89127	89127	Ripton	158	" Ah ! "
89139	89160	89127	89127	Ripton	158	" Why , you 're quite a scholar , Tom ! Mr. Richard is well . All right at home ? "
89161	89172	89174	89174	Tom	199	" Come to town this mornin ' with his uncle , "
89176	89185	89174	89174	Tom	199	" All well , thank ye , sir . "
89186	89189	89191	89191	Ripton	158	" Ha ! "
89198	89255	89191	89191	Ripton	158	" now I see . You all came to town to - day , and these are your boxes outside . So , so ! But Mr. Richard writes for me to get lodgings for a lady . There must be some mistake he wrote in a hurry . He wants lodgings for you all eh ? "
89256	89267	89269	89269	Tom	199	" ' M sure I d'n know what he wants , "
89271	89282	89283	89283	Ripton	158	" You 'd better go by the letter , sir . "
89290	89342	89283	89283	Ripton	158	" ' Lodgings for a lady , and then come along with Tom . Not a word to a soul . ' I say ! that looks like but he never cared for them . You do n't mean to say , Tom , he 's been running away with anybody ? "
89351	89362	89343	89343	Tom	199	" Better wait till ye see Mr. Richard , sir , "
89367	89405	89364	89364	Ripton	158	" Hanged if you ai n't the tightest witness I ever saw ! I should n't like to have you in a box . Some of you country fellows beat any number of cockneys . You do ! "
89934	89940	89943	89943	he	186	" Have you done it ? "
90311	90361	90302	90302	Richard	186	" I want you now to go to my uncle at our hotel . Keep him quiet till I come . Say I had to see you say anything . I shall be there by the dinner hour . Rip ! I must talk to you alone after dinner . "
90827	90907	90909	90909	Hippias	334	" We 're in the very street within a stone's - throw of the house , and he jumps like a harlequin out of my cab into another ; he must be mad that boy 's got madness in him ! and carries off all the boxes my dinner - pills , too ! and keeps away the whole of the day , though he promised to go to the doctor , and had a dozen engagements with me , "
90934	90950	90951	90951	Hippias	334	" Why , you do n't mean to say he 's been to the doctor ? "
90955	90965	90967	90967	Ripton	158	" He has called on him twice , sir , "
90971	90996	90967	90967	Ripton	158	" On leaving me he was going a third time . I should n't wonder that 's what detains him he 's so determined . "
91039	91046	91048	91048	Ripton	158	" He 's alarmed about himself , "
91071	91085	91055	91055	Hippias	334	" He was afraid of making you anxious , I think , sir . "
91136	91143	91144	91144	he	158	" Have you seen the doctor ? "
91169	91181	91162	91162	Algernon	140	" What the deuce do you want with doctor , boy ? "
91194	91202	91203	91203	he	186	" Oh , ay ! the doctor ! "
91212	91237	91238	91238	he	186	" Why , he tells me he 'd back me to do Milo 's trick in a week from the present day . Uncle , "
91244	91371	91238	91238	he	186	" I hope you 'll excuse me for running off as I did . I was in a hurry . I left something at the railway . This stupid Rip thinks I went to the doctor about myself . The fact was , I wanted to fetch the doctor to see you here so that you might have no trouble , you know . You ca n't bear the sight of his instruments and skeletons I 've heard you say so . You said it set all your marrow in revolt ' fried your marrow , ' I think were the words , and made you see twenty thousand different ways of sliding down to the chambers of the Grim King . Do n't you remember ? "
91614	91643	91600	91601	the hero	3139	" We must go out and talk over that law - business , Rip , before you go . Do you think the old lady has any chance ? "
91644	91649	91651	91651	Ripton	158	" Not a bit ! "
91655	91665	91651	91651	Ripton	158	" But it 's worth fighting eh , Rip ? "
91666	91671	91673	91673	Ripton	158	" Oh , certainly ! "
91719	91728	91730	91730	Richard	186	" Yes , yes ! in certain cases , "
91732	91739	91730	91730	Richard	186	" Pretty legal morality , gentlemen ! "
91746	91752	91740	91740	Algernon	140	" And lay , too ! "
91807	91813	91815	91815	Richard	186	" Rip will tell you , "
91822	91840	91815	91815	Richard	186	" I 'm a bad hand at these matters . Tell them how it stands , Rip . "
91878	91918	91920	91920	Ripton	158	" Oh , nothing ! She very curious old character ! She a wears a wig . She a very curious old character indeed ! She a quite the old style . There 's no doing anything with her ! "
91933	91938	91939	91939	Hippias	334	" So it appears , "
91946	91958	91943	91943	Algernon	140	" Well ? and about her wig ? Somebody stole it ? "
92100	92157	92075	92075	He	158	" Oh , nothing ! She Richard knows her better than I do an old lady somewhere down in Suffolk . I think we had better advise her not to proceed . The expenses of litigation are enormous ! She I think we had better advise her to stop short , and not make any scandal . "
92158	92165	92166	92166	Algernon	140	" And not make any scandal ! "
92171	92186	92166	92166	Algernon	140	" Come , come ! there 's something more than a wig , then ? "
92214	92221	92199	92201	The luckless fictionist	3248	" She there 's a daughter . "
92222	92227	92229	92229	Hippias	334	" Born with effort ! "
92231	92434	92435	92435	Richard	186	" Must give her pause after that ! and I 'll take the opportunity to stretch my length on the sofa . Heigho ! that 's true what Austin says : ' The general prayer should be for a full stomach , and the individual for one that works well ; for on that basis only are we a match for temporal matters , and able to contemplate eternal . ' Sententious , but true . I gave him the idea , though ! Take care of your stomachs , boys ! and if ever you hear of a monument proposed to a scientific cook or gastronomic doctor , send in your subscriptions . Or say to him while he lives , Go forth , and be a Knight ! Ha ! They have a good cook at this house . He suits me better than ours at Raynham . I almost wish I had brought my manuscript to town , I feel so much better . Aha ! I did n't expect to digest at all without my regular incentive . I think I shall give it up . What do you say to the theatre to - night , boys ! "
92438	92443	92435	92435	Richard	186	" Bravo , uncle ! "
92444	92451	92453	92453	Algernon	140	" Let Mr. Thompson finish first , "
92455	92498	92453	92453	Algernon	140	" I want to hear the conclusion of the story . The old girl has a wig and a daughter . I 'll swear somebody runs away with one of the two ! Fill your glass , Mr. Thompson , and forward ! "
92499	92504	92505	92505	Ripton	158	" So somebody does , "
92510	92519	92520	92520	he	158	" And they 're found in town together , "
92526	92540	92520	92520	he	158	" She a that is , the old lady found them in company . "
92541	92552	92554	92554	Algernon	140	" She finds him with her wig on in company ! "
92556	92566	92554	92554	Algernon	140	" Capital ! Here 's matter for the lawyers ! "
92567	92582	92583	92583	Hippias	334	" And you advise her not to proceed , under such circumstances of aggravation ? "
92593	92599	92583	92583	Hippias	334	" It 's the daughter , "
92612	92635	92636	92636	he	158	" A runaway match beautiful girl ! the only son of a baronet married by special licence . A the point is , "
92646	92683	92636	92636	he	158	" the point is whether the marriage can be annulled , as she 's of the Catholic persuasion and he 's a Protestant , and they 're both married under age . That 's the point . "
92731	92792	92721	92721	Richard	186	" What a muddle you 're in , Rip ! You 're mixing half - a - dozen stories together . The old lady I told you about was old Dame Bakewell , and the dispute was concerning a neighbour of hers who encroached on her garden , and I said I 'd pay the money to see her righted ! "
92793	92796	92798	92798	Ripton	158	" Ah , "
92802	92818	92798	92798	Ripton	158	" I was thinking of the other . Her garden ! Cabbages do n't interest me "
92819	92825	92826	92826	Richard	186	" Here , come along , "
92832	92843	92844	92844	he	186	" I 'll be back in five minutes , uncle , "
92898	92914	92916	92916	Richard	186	" What on earth induced you to talk about Protestants and Catholics marrying , Rip ? "
92927	92930	92931	92931	Ripton	158	" Why , "
92934	93032	93033	93034	The hero	3139	" I was so hard pushed for it , ' pon my honour , I did n't know what to say . I ai n't an author , you know ; I ca n't make a story . I was trying to invent a point , and I could n't think of any other , and I thought that was just the point likely to make a jolly good dispute . Capital dinners they give at those crack hotels . Why did you throw it all upon me ? I did n't begin on the old lady . "
93037	93140	93033	93034	The hero	3139	" It 's odd ! It 's impossible you could have known ! I 'll tell you why , Rip ! I wanted to try you . You fib well at long range , but you do n't do at close quarters and single combat . You 're good behind walls , but not worth a shot in the open . I just see what you 're fit for . You 're staunch that I am certain of . You always were . Lead the way to one of the parks down in that direction . You know ? where she is ! "
93219	93346	93196	93196	his	3139	" They 've been plotting against me for a year , Rip ! When you see her , you 'll know what it was to have such a creature taken away from you . It nearly killed me . Never mind what she is . She 's the most perfect and noble creature God ever made ! It 's not only her beauty I do n't care so much about that ! but when you 've once seen her , she seems to draw music from all the nerves of your body ; but she 's such an angel . I worship her . And her mind 's like her face . She 's pure gold . There , you 'll see her to - night . "
93349	93361	93196	93196	his	3139	" he pursued , after inflating Ripton with this rapturous prospect , "
93439	93442	93428	93428	she	3266	" he pronounced "
93445	93458	93428	93428	she	3266	" a little modestly as it were a blush in his voice . "
93624	93630	93575	93575	he	1400	" He lifted his face . "
93652	93681	93575	93575	he	1400	" Ripton tipped his comical nose upward , and was in duty bound to say , Yes ! though he observed no connection between them and the narrative . "
93684	93690	93691	93691	I	0	" the hero went on , "
94227	94245	94225	94225	her	3266	" .... Ripton listened for more . Richard had gone off in a muse at the picture . "
94248	94252	94225	94225	her	3266	" said Ripton , "
94261	94284	94256	94259	that young farmer fellow	3299	" The hero 's head was again contemplating the starry branches . His lieutenant 's question came to him after an interval . "
94319	94320	94321	94321	Lord	3305	" "
94323	94327	94321	94321	Lord	3305	" cried Ripton , "
94346	94356	94340	94340	I	0	" His commander quietly passed his likes or dislikes . "
94372	94376	94377	94377	I	0	" Ripton suggested . "
94537	94546	94549	94549	you	3312	" the hero burst out at a recollection . "
94679	94690	94695	94698	The die 's cast	3326	" Ripton emphasized his opinion that it certainly was foolish . "
94700	94704	94705	94705	They	3327	" said Richard . "
94774	94986	94989	94989	you	3330	" and away he went , compelling Ripton to the sort of strides a drummer - boy has to take beside a column of grenadiers . Ripton began to wish himself in love , seeing that it endowed a man with wind so that he could breathe great sighs , while going at a tremendous pace , and experience no sensation of fatigue . The hero was communing with the elements , his familiars , and allowed him to pant as he pleased . Some keen - eyed Kensington urchins , noticing the discrepancy between the pedestrian powers of the two , aimed their wit at Mr. Thompson junior 's expense . The pace , and nothing but the pace , induced Ripton to proclaim that they had gone too far , when they discovered that they had over shot the mark by half a mile . In the street over which stood love 's star , the hero thundered his presence at a door , and evoked a flying housemaid , who knew not Mrs. Berry . The hero attached significance to the fact that his instincts should have betrayed him , for he could have sworn to that house . The door being shut he stood in dead silence . "
94994	95024	94989	94989	you	3330	" Ripton inquired , and heard that it was in the custody of the cabman . Neither of them could positively bring to mind the number of the house . "
95040	95086	95025	95025	You	3330	" Ripton hazarded a pleasantry which met with no response . Betrayed by his instincts , the magic slaves of Love ! The hero heavily descended the steps . Ripton murmured that they were done for . His commander turned on him , and said : "
95105	95203	95100	95100	I	0	" With a wry face Ripton crossed the road , altogether subdued by Richard 's native superiority to adverse circumstances . Then were families aroused . Then did mortals dimly guess that something portentous was abroad . Then were labourers all day in the vineyard , harshly wakened from their evening 's nap . Hope and Fear stalked the street , as again and again the loud companion summonses resounded . Finally Ripton sang out cheerfully . He had Mrs. Berry before him , profuse of mellow curtsies . Richard ran to her and caught her hands : "
95210	95211	95204	95204	She	3334	" "
95230	95263	95204	95204	She	3334	" Mrs. Berry replied to Ripton alone . The lover had flown aloft . The wise woman sagely ushered Ripton into her own private parlour , there to wait till he was wanted .
95266	95286	95025	95025	You	3330	" In all cases where two have joined to commit an offence , punish one of the two lightly , "
95803	95809	95792	95792	He	2645	" Keep your eyes so . "
95814	95822	95792	95792	He	2645	" Do you fear me , Lucy ? "
95829	95837	95838	95838	She	3349	" Do you love me , darling ? "
95845	95854	95838	95838	She	3349	" Then why do you turn from me ? "
95858	95870	95855	95855	She	3349	" O Richard , take me home ! take me home ! "
95871	95878	95879	95879	Her	3349	" Look at me , Lucy ! "
95885	95897	95879	95879	Her	3349	" Keep your eyes on me , darling ! Now speak ! "
95918	95927	95913	95913	he	2354	" You wish me to take you home ? "
95931	95941	95928	95928	She	3349	" O Richard ? it is not too late . "
95942	95952	95913	95913	he	2354	" You regret what you have done for me ? "
95953	95960	95913	95913	he	2354	" Dearest ! it is ruin . "
95961	95972	95928	95928	She	3349	" You weep because you have consented to be mine ? "
95973	95981	95913	95913	he	2354	" Not for me ! O Richard ! "
95982	95995	95913	95913	he	2354	" For me you weep ? Look at me ! For me ? "
95996	96005	95913	95913	he	2354	" How will it end ! O Richard ! "
96006	96012	95928	95928	She	3349	" You weep for me ? "
96013	96022	95913	95913	he	2354	" Dearest ! I would die for you ! "
96023	96158	95913	95913	he	2354	" Would you see me indifferent to everything in the world ? Would you have me lost ? Do you think I will live another day in England without you ? I have staked all I have on you , Lucy . You have nearly killed me once . A second time , and the earth will not be troubled by me . You ask me to wait , when they are plotting against us on all sides ? Darling Lucy ! look on me . Fix your fond eyes on me . You ask me to wait when here you are given to me when you have proved my faith when we know we love as none have loved . Give me your eyes ! Let them tell me I have your heart ! "
96186	96210	96174	96174	She	3353	" Dearest ! your father may be brought to consent by and by , and then oh ! if you take me home now "
96216	96288	96289	96289	He	3355	" He who has been arranging that fine scheme to disgrace and martyrize you ? True , as I live ! that 's the reason of their having you back . Your old servant heard him and your uncle discussing it . He ! Lucy ! he 's a good man , but he must not step in between you and me . I say God has given you to me . "
96400	96407	96391	96391	She	3356	" Oh , my own Richard ! "
96417	96423	96414	96414	He	3355	" Call me that name . "
96428	96434	96435	96435	he	3355	" Call me that name , "
96438	96445	96435	96435	he	3355	" You said it once today . "
96446	96449	96414	96414	He	3355	" Dearest ! "
96450	96454	96414	96414	He	3355	" Not that . "
96455	96459	96435	96435	he	3355	" O darling ! "
96460	96464	96414	96414	He	3355	" Not that . "
96465	96468	96414	96414	He	3355	" Husband ! "
97117	97123	97125	97125	Richard	127	" How happy everybody looks ! "
97133	97137	97139	97139	Ripton	158	" Yes jolly ! "
97141	97166	97168	97169	the hero	3139	" When I 'm when this is over , I 'll see that they are , too as many as I can make happy , "
97174	97191	97168	97169	the hero	3139	" Her blind was down at a quarter to six . I think she slept well ! "
97192	97200	97201	97201	Ripton	158	" You 've been there this morning ? "
97217	97225	97201	97201	Ripton	158	" Will she see me , Ricky ? "
97226	97243	97168	97169	the hero	3139	" Yes . She 'll see you to - day . She was tired last night . "
97244	97247	97248	97248	Richard	127	" Positively ? "
97258	97261	97262	97262	he	158	" Here , "
97273	97296	97262	97262	he	158	" here 's where I talked to you last night . What a time it seems ! How I hate the night ! "
97333	97336	97338	97339	his chief	6120	" Well ! "
97341	97347	97338	97339	his chief	6120	" why not marry her ? "
97356	97359	97350	97350	Ripton	158	" Oh ! "
97558	97567	97568	97568	he	158	" You do n't wonder now , Rip ? "
97571	97576	97568	97568	he	158	" No , Richard ! "
97585	97591	97577	97577	Ripton	158	" indeed I do n't ! "
97893	97902	97870	97870	She	233	" So everybody is , where you are ! "
98216	98231	98208	98208	He	127	" The cockneys nod to each other aside , The coxcombs lift their glasses , "
98380	98394	98375	98375	he	3439	" Confound it , Mr. Thompson ! you might have chosen the other . "
98409	98414	98416	98416	Algernon	140	" Not at all , "
98418	98431	98416	98416	Algernon	140	" Everybody makes up to that fellow . Instinct , I suppose ! "
98448	98461	98462	98462	he	127	" Sorry I could n't wait for you this morning , uncle , "
98471	98480	98462	98462	he	127	" I thought you never walked so far . "
98740	98750	98751	98753	the mellifluous woman	3456	" Just an hour 's sleep , or so , "
98763	98788	98789	98789	she	3456	" A quiet sleep and a cup of warm tea goes for more than twenty doctors , it do when there 's the flutters , "
98792	98812	98813	98813	She	3456	" I know it by myself . And a good cry beforehand 's better than the best of medicine . "
98836	98867	98827	98827	her	3456	" Lord ! Lord ! the three of 'em do n't make fifty ! I 'm as old as two and a half of 'em , to say the least . "
98902	98912	98913	98913	Richard	127	" Did you see the change come over her ? "
98932	98974	98923	98924	The lover	2354	" What could I do ? If I had said nothing , we should have been suspected . I was obliged to speak . And she hates a lie ! See ! it has struck her down . God forgive me ! "
98981	98989	98990	98990	he	158	" It was a fright , Richard , "
98993	99049	98990	98990	he	158	" That 's what Mrs. Berry means by flutters . Those old women talk in that way . You heard what she said . And these old women know . I 'll tell you what it is . It 's this , Richard ! it 's because you 've got a fool for your friend ! "
99050	99055	99057	99058	the lover	2354	" She regrets it , "
99060	99070	99071	99071	He	158	" Good God ! I think she fears me . "
99091	99104	99079	99079	Ripton	158	" It 's because you 've got a fool for your friend ! "
99174	99184	99185	99185	he	127	" Do n't mumble on like that , Rip ! "
99188	99193	99185	99185	he	127	" Nobody blames you . "
99194	99204	99206	99207	the wretch	2352	" Ah ! you 're very kind , Richard , "
99218	99273	99274	99274	Ripton	158	" Listen to me , Rip ! I shall take her home to - night . Yes ! If she 's happier away from me ! do you think me a brute , Ripton ? Rather than have her shed a tear , I 'd ! I 'll take her home to - night ! "
99307	99388	99304	99304	he	158	" If I give him who came for her yesterday the clue ? If no one sees or hears of me , what can they say ? O Rip ! I 'll give her up . I 'm wrecked for ever ! What of that ? Yes let them take her ! The world in arms should never have torn her from me , but when she cries Yes ! all 's over . I 'll find him at once . "
99419	99431	99406	99406	Ripton	158	" Suppose , Richard , she does n't want to go ? "
99541	99546	99547	99547	she	489	" Dear ! dear ! "
99550	99575	99547	99547	she	489	" and neither of you eaten a scrap ! And there 's my dear young lady off into the prettiest sleep you ever see ! "
99576	99579	99581	99582	the lover	2354	" Ha ? "
99586	99592	99581	99582	the lover	2354	" Soft as a baby ! "
99597	99683	99593	99594	Mrs. Berry	489	" I went to look at her this very moment , and there 's not a bit of trouble in her breath . It come and it go like the sweetest regular instrument ever made . The Black Ox have n't trod on her foot yet ! Most like it was the air of London . But only fancy , if you had called in a doctor ! Why , I should n't have let her take any of his quackery . Now , there ! "
99730	99742	99750	99751	the lover	2354	" Keep me , keep me , now you have me ! "
99757	99770	99771	99771	he	6120	" When will she wake , do you think , Mrs. Berry ? "
99774	99785	99787	99790	the guileful good creature	3479	" Oh ! we must n't go for disturbing her , "
99792	99871	99787	99790	the guileful good creature	3479	" Bless ye ! let her sleep it out . And if you young gentlemen was to take my advice , and go and take a walk for to get a appetite everybody should eat ! it 's their sacred duty , no matter what their feelings be ! and I say it who'm no chicken ! I 'll frickashee this which is a chicken against your return . I 'm a cook , I can assure ye ! "
99879	99890	99891	99891	he	2354	" You 're the best old soul in the world ! "
99902	99958	99894	99895	Mrs. Berry	489	" We wo n't disturb her . Let her sleep . Keep her in bed , Mrs. Berry . Will you ? And we 'll call to inquire after her this evening , and come and see her to - morrow . I 'm sure you 'll be kind to her . There ! there ! "
99966	99985	99959	99960	Mrs. Berry	489	" I trust her to you , you see . Good - bye , you dear old soul . "
100092	100095	100097	100097	Richard	127	" Letitia ! "
100099	100119	100097	100097	Richard	127	" I like the name . Both begin with L. There 's something soft womanlike in the L. 's . "
100139	100323	100131	100132	The lover	2354	" Lucy Feverel ! that sounds better ! I wonder where Ralph is . I should like to help him . He 's in love with my cousin Clare . He 'll never do anything till he marries . No man can . I 'm going to do a hundred things when it 's over . We shall travel first . I want to see the Alps . One does n't know what the earth is till one has seen the Alps . What a delight it will be to her ! I fancy I see her eyes gazing up at them . ' And oh , your dear blue eyes , that heavenward glance With kindred beauty , banished humbleness , Past weeping for mortality 's distress Yet from your soul a tear hangs there in trance . And fills , but does not fall ; Softly I hear it call At heaven 's gate , till Sister Seraphs press To look on you their old love from the skies : Those are the eyes of Seraphs bright on your blue eyes ! "
100376	100377	100374	100374	Rip	188	" "
100383	100392	100374	100374	Rip	188	" said Ripton , modestly shutting his mouth . "
100409	100414	100415	100415	She	3496	" the hero continued . "
100510	100520	100485	100485	I	0	" Ripton strove to imagine he could enjoy it . "
100571	100667	100668	100668	Margaret	430	" Sunshine and cloud , cloud and sunshine , passed over the lover . Now life was a narrow ring ; now the distances extended , were winged , flew illimitably . An hour ago and food was hateful . Now he manfully refreshed his nature , and joined in Algernon 's encomiums on Miss Letitia Thompson . Meantime Beauty slept , watched by the veteran volunteer of the hero 's band . Lucy awoke from dreams which seemed reality , to the reality which was a dream . She awoke calling for some friend , "
100670	100676	100668	100668	Margaret	430	" and heard one say , "
100689	100712	100687	100687	Margaret	430	" Then she asked piteously where she was , and where was Margaret , her dear friend , and Mrs. Berry whispered , "
100720	100721	100687	100687	Margaret	430	" "
100724	100760	100687	100687	Margaret	430	" sighed Lucy , sinking on her pillow , overwhelmed by the strangeness of her state . Mrs. Berry closed the frill of her nightgown and adjusted the bedclothes quietly . Her name was breathed . "
100766	100770	100687	100687	Margaret	430	" she said . "
100775	100776	100772	100772	he	3509	" "
100784	100785	100777	100777	He	3509	" "
100792	100801	100687	100687	Margaret	430	" The young girl started up in disorder . "
100817	100822	100813	100815	that young gentleman	1305	" Mrs. Berry chanted : "
100837	100838	100840	100841	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
100850	100987	100845	100845	you	489	" Lucy wept for the famine - struck hero , who was just then feeding mightily . Mrs. Berry explained that to make one eat who thought the darling of his heart like to die , was a sheer impossibility for the cleverest of women ; and on this deep truth Lucy reflected , with her eyes wide at the candle . She wanted one to pour her feelings out to . She slid her hand from under the bedclothes , and took Mrs. Berry 's , and kissed it . The good creature required no further avowal of her secret , but forthwith leaned her consummate bosom to the pillow , and petitioned heaven to bless them both ! Then the little bride was alarmed , and wondered how Mrs. Berry could have guessed it . "
100990	100995	100845	100845	you	489	" said Mrs. Berry , "
101011	101082	100996	100996	your	3513	" And the little bride wondered more . She thought she had been so very cautious not to betray it . The common woman in them made cheer together after their own April fashion . Following which Mrs. Berry probed for the sweet particulars of this beautiful love - match ; but the little bride 's lips were locked . She only said her lover was above her in station . "
101092	101093	101084	101084	you	3513	" "
101099	101100	101096	101097	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
101106	101107	101103	101104	a Protestant	7670	" "
101113	101114	101110	101111	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
101126	101138	101110	101111	Mrs. Berry	489	" she ejaculated , seeing sadness return to the bridal babe . "
101206	101207	101198	101200	my young gentleman	3524	" "
101213	101217	101210	101211	Mrs. Berry	489	" Lucy murmured . "
101229	101230	101235	101236	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
101238	101239	101235	101236	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
101292	101397	101400	101400	you	3513	" She made other and deeper dives into the little heart , but though she drew up pearls , they were not of the kind she searched for . The one fact that hung as a fruit upon her tree of Love , Lucy had given her ; she would not , in fealty to her lover , reveal its growth and history , however sadly she yearned to pour out all to this dear old Mother Confessor . Her conduct drove Mrs. Berry from the rosy to the autumnal view of matrimony , generally heralded by the announcement that it is a lottery . "
101405	101410	101400	101400	you	3513	" said Mrs. Berry , "
101498	101509	101495	101496	My dear	6235	" Mrs. Berry pressed her hands flat on her apron . "
101551	101560	101546	101546	he	6304	" she sighed to Lucy 's large eyes , "
101575	101584	101585	101585	I	0	" the poor creature tapped her sensitive side . "
101684	101697	101698	101698	I	0	" Mrs. Berry thumped her knee , and accentuated up her climax : "
101766	101777	101761	101761	his	6304	" exclaimed Mrs. Berry , reckoning her wrongs over vividly . "
101858	101864	101865	101865	Johnson	355	" she spread out her arms "
101874	101973	101865	101865	Johnson	355	" At this impressive woe Mrs. Berry 's voice quavered into sobs . Lucy spoke gentle words to the poor outcast from Johnson . The sorrows of Autumn have no warning for April . The little bride , for all her tender pity , felt happier when she had heard her landlady 's moving tale of the wickedness of man , which cast in bright relief the glory of that one hero who was hers . Then from a short flight of inconceivable bliss , she fell , shot by one of her hundred Argus - eyed fears . "
101990	102000	101865	101865	Johnson	355	" Mrs. Berry immediately dried her eyes to radiance . "
102093	102094	102095	102095	She	3562	" "
102101	102105	102106	102106	She	3562	" mused Lucy . "
102166	102167	102152	102153	Her father	6343	" "
102175	102181	102189	102189	he	1653	" Lucy preferred to know . "
102192	102203	102189	102189	he	1653	" said Mrs. Berry , coming upon her matrimonial wisdom . "
102314	102326	102327	102327	You	3583	" Perceiving that she grew abstruse , Mrs. Berry added briskly : "
102358	102754	102350	102350	Kissing	433	" Here , with an aphorism worthy a place in The Pilgrim 'S Scrip , she broke off to go posseting for her dear invalid . Lucy was quite well ; very eager to be allowed to rise and be ready when the knock should come . Mrs. Berry , in her loving considerateness for the little bride , positively commanded her to lie down , and be quiet , and submit to be nursed and cherished . For Mrs. Berry well knew that ten minutes alone with the hero could only be had while the little bride was in that unattainable position . Thanks to her strategy , as she thought , her object was gained . The night did not pass before she learnt , from the hero 's own mouth , that Mr. Richards , the father of the hero , and a stern lawyer , was adverse to his union with this young lady he loved , because of a ward of his , heiress to an immense property , whom he desired his son to espouse ; and because his darling Letitia was a Catholic Letitia , the sole daughter of a brave naval officer deceased , and in the hands of a savage uncle , who wanted to sacrifice this beauty to a brute of a son . Mrs. Berry listened credulously to the emphatic narrative , and spoke to the effect that the wickedness of old people formed the excuse for the wildness of young ones . The ceremonious administration of oaths of secrecy and devotion over , she was enrolled in the hero 's band , which now numbered three , and entered upon the duties with feminine energy , for there are no conspirators like women . Ripton 's lieutenancy became a sinecure , his rank merely titular . He had never been married he knew nothing about licences , except that they must be obtained , and were not difficult he had not an idea that so many days ' warning must be given to the clergyman of the parish where one of the parties was resident . How should he ? All his forethought was comprised in the ring , and whenever the discussion of arrangements for the great event grew particularly hot and important , he would say , with a shrewd nod : "
102768	102782	102765	102766	Mrs. Berry	489	" and the new member was only prevented by natural complacence from shouting : "
102793	102873	102785	102785	drat	3589	" Mrs. Berry had acted conspicuously in fifteen marriages , by banns , and by licence , and to have such an obvious requisite dinned in her ears was exasperating . They could not have contracted alliance with an auxiliary more invaluable , an authority so profound ; and they acknowledged it to themselves . The hero marched like an automaton at her bidding ; Lieutenant Thompson was rejoiced to perform services as errand - boy in the enterprise . "
102889	102897	102885	102885	I	0	" said the devout and charitable Berry . "
102926	102975	102916	102916	they	3590	" Her own woeful experiences had been given to the hero in exchange for his story of cruel parents . Richard vowed to her that he would henceforth hold it a duty to hunt out the wanderer from wedded bonds , and bring him back bound and suppliant . "
102982	102991	102978	102978	he	3592	" said Mrs. Berry , pursing prophetic wrinkles : "
103065	103353	103062	103063	Mr. Richards	434	" As when nations are secretly preparing for war , the docks and arsenals hammer night and day , and busy contractors measure time by inches , and the air hums around : for leagues as it were myriads of bees , so the house and neighbourhood of the matrimonial soft one resounded in the heroic style , and knew little of the changes of light decreed by Creation . Mrs. Berry was the general of the hour . Down to Doctors ' Commons she expedited the hero , instructing him how boldly to face the Law , and fib : for that the Law never could mist a fib and a bold face . Down the hero went , and proclaimed his presence . And lo ! the Law danced to him its sedatest lovely bear's - dance . Think ye the Lawless susceptible to him than flesh and blood ? With a beautiful confidence it put the few familiar questions to him , and nodded to his replies : then stamped the bond , and took the fee . It must be an old vagabond at heart that can permit the irrevocable to go so cheap , even to a hero . For only mark him when he is petitioned by heroes and heroines to undo what he does so easily ! That small archway of Doctors ' Commons seems the eye of a needle , through which the lean purse has a way , somehow , of slipping more readily than the portly ; but once through , all are camels alike , the lean purse an especially big camel . Dispensing tremendous marriage as it does , the Law can have no conscience . "
103361	103367	103354	103354	I	0	" said the exulting hero . "
103372	103377	103354	103354	I	0	" returns Mrs. Berry . "
103394	103580	103354	103354	I	0	" Likewise the ambassador of the hero went to claim the promise of the Church to be in attendance on a certain spot , on a certain day , and there hear oath of eternal fealty , and gird him about with all its forces : which the Church , receiving a wink from the Law , obsequiously engaged to do , for less than the price of a plum - cake . Meantime , while craftsmen and skilled women , directed by Mrs. Berry , were toiling to deck the day at hand , Raynham and Belthorpe slept , the former soundly ; and one day was as another to them . Regularly every morning a letter arrived from Richard to his father , containing observations on the phenomena of London ; remarks mainly cynical on the speeches and acts of Parliament ; and reasons for not having yet been able to call on the Grandisons . They were certainly rather monotonous and spiritless . The baronet did not complain . That cold dutiful tone assured him there was no internal trouble or distraction . "
103588	104369	104370	104370	Wife	3539	" he said to Lady Blandish , with sure insight . Complacently he sat and smiled , little witting that his son 's ordeal was imminent , and that his son 's ordeal was to be his own . Hippias wrote that his nephew was killing him by making appointments which he never kept , and altogether neglecting him in the most shameless way , so that his ganglionic centre was in a ten times worse state than when he left Raynham . He wrote very bitterly , but it was hard to feel compassion for his offended stomach . On the other hand , young Tom Blaize was not forthcoming , and had despatched no tidings whatever . Farmer Blaize smoked his pipe evening after evening , vastly disturbed . London was a large place young Tom might be lost in it , he thought ; and young Tom had his weaknesses . A wolf at Belthorpe , he was likely to be a sheep in London , as yokels have proved . But what had become of Lucy ? This consideration almost sent Farmer Blaize off to London direct , and he would have gone had not his pipe enlightened him . A young fellow might play truant and get into a scrape , but a young man and a young woman were sure to be heard of , unless they were acting in complicity . Why , of course , young Tom had behaved like a man , the rascal ! and married her outright there , while he had the chance . It was a long guess . Still it was the only reasonable way of accounting for his extraordinary silence , and therefore the farmer held to it that he had done the deed . He argued as modern men do who think the hero , the upsetter of ordinary calculations , is gone from us . So , after despatching a letter to a friend in town to be on the outlook for son Tom , he continued awhile to smoke his pipe , rather elated than not , and mused on the shrewd manner he should adopt when Master Honeymoon did appear . Toward the middle of the second week of Richard 's absence , Tom Bakewell came to Raynham for Cassandra , and privately handed a letter to the Eighteenth Century , containing a request for money , and a round sum . The Eighteenth Century was as good as her word , and gave Tom a letter in return , enclosing a cheque on her bankers , amply providing to keep the heroic engine in motion at a moderate pace . Tom went back , and Raynham and Lobourne slept and dreamed not of the morrow . The System , wedded to Time , slept , and knew not how he had been outraged anticipated by seven pregnant seasons . For Time had heard the hero swear to that legalizing instrument , and had also registered an oath . Ah me ! venerable Hebrew Time ! he is unforgiving . Half the confusion and fever of the world comes of this vendetta he declares against the hapless innocents who have once done him a wrong . They can not escape him . They will never outlive it . The father of jokes , he is himself no joke ; which it seems the business of men to discover . The days roll round . He is their servant now . Mrs. Berry has a new satin gown , a beautiful bonnet , a gold brooch , and sweet gloves , presented to her by the hero , wherein to stand by his bride at the altar to - morrow ; and , instead of being an old wary hen , she is as much a chicken as any of the party , such has been the magic of these articles . Fathers she sees accepting the facts produced for them by their children ; a world content to be carved out as it pleases the hero . At last Time brings the bridal eve , and is blest as a benefactor . The final arrangements are made ; the bridegroom does depart ; and Mrs. Berry lights the little bride to her bed . Lucy stops on the landing where there is an old clock eccentrically correct that night . ' Tis the palpitating pause before the gates of her transfiguration . Mrs. Berry sees her put her rosy finger on the One about to strike , and touch all the hours successively till she comes to the Twelve that shall sound "
104371	104432	104370	104370	Wife	3539	" in her ears on the morrow , moving her lips the while , and looking round archly solemn when she has done ; and that sight so catches at Mrs. Berry 's heart that , not guessing Time to be the poor child 's enemy , she endangers her candle by folding Lucy warmly in her arms , whimpering ; "
104451	104457	104448	104448	You	3596	" Old Time gazes grimly ahead .
104628	104643	104626	104626	him	3606	" Wilt thou we d this Fate , and give up all behind thee ? "
104645	104649	104626	104626	him	3606	" I will , "
104824	104846	104847	104848	Richard Feverel	226	" The danger of a little knowledge of things is disputable : but beware the little knowledge of one 's self ! "
105568	105573	105575	105577	the maturer lady	3656	" Drink , child ! "
105579	105608	105575	105577	the maturer lady	3656	" That is only your second mug . I insist upon your drinking three full ones every morning we 're in town . Your constitution positively requires iron ! "
105609	105614	105615	105616	the other	933	" But , mama , "
105619	105630	105615	105616	the other	933	" it 's so nasty . I shall be sick . "
105631	105634	105575	105577	the maturer lady	3656	" Drink ! "
105640	105656	105657	105657	She	3656	" Nothing to the German waters , my dear . Here , let me taste . "
105668	105686	105687	105687	she	3656	" I declare I think it almost nice not at all objectionable . Pray , taste it , "
105710	105733	105702	105707	An unmistakable cis - Rubicon voice	3661	" Certainly , if it 's good fellowship ; though I confess I do n't think mutual sickness a very engaging ceremony . "
105802	105814	105816	105817	Mrs. Doria	138	" Now , pray , drink , and do not fuss ! "
105819	105822	105823	105823	Clare	147	" Mama ! "
105848	105857	105841	105842	Mrs. Doria	138	" My own boy ! My dear Richard ! "
105873	105887	105889	105890	Mrs. Doria	138	" Why , we were coming for you to - day , Richard , "
105899	106043	105889	105890	Mrs. Doria	138	" We want another cavalier . This is delightful ! My dear nephew ! You have grown from a boy to a man . And there 's down on his lip ! And what brings you here at such an hour in the morning ? Poetry , I suppose ! Here , take my arm , child . Clare ! finish that mug and thank your cousin for sparing you the third . I always bring her , when we are by a chalybeate , to take the waters before breakfast . We have to get up at unearthly hours . Think , my dear boy ! Mothers are sacrifices ! And so you 've been alone a fortnight with your agreeable uncle ! A charming time of it you must have had ! Poor Hippias ! what may be his last nostrum ? "
106044	106047	106048	106048	Adrian	346	" Nephew ! "
106057	106082	106050	106050	his	346	" Doses of nephew taken morning and night fourteen days ! And he guarantees that it shall destroy an iron constitution in a month . "
106093	106099	106083	106083	Richard	226	" Quite well , Ricky ? "
106100	106106	106107	106107	Richard	226	" Yes : well enough , "
106110	106113	106115	106117	his vigorous aunt	3668	" Well ? "
106130	106252	106253	106253	she	3669	" I really never saw you looking so handsome . There 's something about your face look at me you need n't blush . You 've grown to an Apollo . That blue buttoned - up frock coat becomes you admirably and those gloves , and that easy neck - tie . Your style is irreproachable , quite a style of your own ! And nothing eccentric . You have the instinct of dress . Dress shows blood , my dear boy , as much as anything else . Boy ! you see , I ca n't forget old habits . You were a boy when I left , and now ! Do you see any change in him , Clare ? "
106261	106270	106272	106272	Clare	147	" Richard is looking very well , mama , "
106281	106417	106272	106272	Clare	147	" I wish I could say the same of you , my dear . Take my arm , Richard . Are you afraid of your aunt ? I want to get used to you . Wo n't it be pleasant , our being all in town together in the season ? How fresh the Opera will be to you ! Austin , I hear , takes stalls . You can come to the Forey 's box when you like . We are staying with the Foreys close by here . I think it 's a little too far out , you know ; but they like the neighbourhood . This is what I have always said : Give him more liberty ! Austin has seen it at last . How do you think Clare looking ? "
106436	106439	106425	106425	Richard	186	" Pale ! "
106444	106450	106440	106441	Mrs. Doria	138	" Rather pale , aunt . "
106451	106462	106425	106425	Richard	186	" Grown very much do n't you think , Richard ? "
106463	106471	106425	106425	Richard	186	" Very tall girl indeed , aunt . "
106472	106527	106440	106441	Mrs. Doria	138	" If she had but a little more colour , my dear Richard ! I 'm sure I give her all the iron she can swallow , but that pallor still continues . I think she does not prosper away from her old companion . She was accustomed to look up to you , Richard "
106528	106538	106539	106539	Richard	186	" Did you get Ralph 's letter , aunt ? "
106543	106546	106541	106541	her	3673	" Absurd ! "
106553	106569	106547	106548	Mrs. Doria	138	" The nonsense of a boy ! Why did you undertake to forward such stuff ? "
106570	106578	106580	106580	Richard	186	" I 'm certain he loves her , "
106594	106609	106610	106610	she	138	" Life , my dear Richard , is a game of cross - purposes , "
106639	106645	106646	106646	she	138	" You breakfast with us , "
106651	106679	106680	106680	she	138	" The Foreys wish to see you ; the girls are dying to know you . Do you know , you have a reputation on account of that "
106685	106763	106764	106765	Mrs. Doria	138	" System you were brought up on . You must n't mind it . For my part , I think you look a credit to it . Do n't be bashful with young women , mind ! As much as you please with the old ones . You know how to behave among men . There you have your Drawing - room Guide ! I 'm sure I shall be proud of you . Am I not ? "
106822	106826	106828	106829	Mrs. Doria	138	" Pardon me , "
106831	106858	106828	106829	Mrs. Doria	138	" You want manners , my dear boy . I think it never happened to me before that a man consulted his watch in my presence . "
106880	106883	106884	106886	the vivacious lady	3678	" Fiddlededee ! "
106889	106987	106884	106886	the vivacious lady	3678	" Now I 've got you , I mean to keep you . Oh ! I 've heard all about you . This ridiculous indifference that your father makes so much of ! Why , of course , you wanted to see the world ! A strong healthy young man shut up all his life in a lonely house no friends , no society , no amusements but those of rustics ! Of course you were indifferent ! Your intelligence and superior mind alone saved you from becoming a dissipated country boor . Where are the others ? "
106998	107004	107005	107005	Adrian	346	" My damozel dropped something , "
107015	107020	107022	107022	Clare	147	" Nothing , mama , "
107074	107092	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" I must tell you , child , that I refuse to listen to such rank idiotcy . "
107093	107103	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" It 's nothing of the kind , aunt . "
107104	107111	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" The fancy of a boy . "
107112	107131	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" He 's not a boy . He 's half - a - year older than I am ! "
107132	107150	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" You silly child ! The moment you fall in love , you all think yourselves men . "
107151	107165	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" On my honour , aunt ! I believe he loves her thoroughly . "
107166	107175	107068	107069	Mrs. Doria	138	" Did he tell you so , child ? "
107176	107186	107188	107188	Richard	186	" Men do n't speak openly of those things , "
107190	107194	107196	107197	Mrs. Doria	138	" Boys do , "
107199	107254	107196	107197	Mrs. Doria	138	" But listen to me in earnest , aunt . I want you to be kind to Ralph . Do n't drive him to You maybe sorry for it . Let him do let him write to her , and see her . I believe women are as cruel as men in these things . "
107255	107263	107313	107313	her	138	" I never encourage absurdity , Richard . "
107264	107274	107196	107197	Mrs. Doria	138	" What objection have you to Ralph , aunt ? "
107275	107309	107310	107311	Mrs. Doria	138	" Oh , they 're both good families . It 's not that absurdity , Richard . It will be to his credit to remember that his first fancy was n't a dairymaid . "
107324	107334	107335	107335	He	3683	" Do n't you want Clare ever to marry ? "
107349	107366	107345	107346	Mrs. Doria	138	" I hope so , child . We must find some comfortable old gentleman for her . "
107367	107371	107373	107373	Richard	186	" What infamy ! "
107375	107425	107426	107426	she	138	" And I engage Ralph shall be ready to dance at her wedding , or eat a hearty breakfast We do n't dance at weddings now , and very properly . It 's a horrid sad business , not to be treated with levity . Is that his regiment ? "
107440	107543	107426	107426	she	138	" Tush , tush , child ! Master Ralph will recover , as hem ! others have done . A little headache you call it heartache and up you rise again , looking better than ever . No doubt , to have a grain of sense forced into your brains , you poor dear children ! must be painful .. Girls suffer as much as boys , I assure you . More , for their heads are weaker , and their appetites less constant . Do I talk like your father now ? Whatever makes the boy fidget at his watch so ? "
107552	107557	107558	107558	he	186	" I must go , "
107577	107615	107570	107571	Mrs. Doria	138	" Listen , Clare ! Richard is going . He says he has an engagement . What possible engagement can a young man have at eleven o'clock in the morning ? unless it 's to be married ! "
107626	107634	107636	107636	Adrian	346	" Is the church handy , Ricky ? "
107638	107660	107636	107636	Adrian	346	" You can still give us half - an - hour if it is . The celibate hours strike at Twelve . "
107669	107679	107662	107662	he	346	" Wo n't you stay with us , Richard ? "
107711	107747	107748	107749	Mrs. Doria	138	" Indeed , I would , Clare ; I should like to please you , but I have a most imperative appointment that is , I promised I must go . I shall see you again "
107757	107808	107748	107749	Mrs. Doria	138	" Now , do come , and do n't waste words . I insist upon your having some breakfast first , and then , if you really must go , you shall . Look ! there 's the house . At least you will accompany your aunt to the door . "
107885	107890	107891	107891	he	186	" Good - bye ! "
107945	108040	107926	107927	Mrs. Doria	138	" See what becomes of that nonsensical education ! The boy really does not know how to behave like a common mortal . He has some paltry appointment , or is mad after some ridiculous idea of his own , and everything must be sacrificed to it ! That 's what Austin calls concentration of the faculties . I think it 's more likely to lead to downright insanity than to greatness of any kind . And so I shall tell Austin . It 's time he should be spoken to seriously about him . "
108041	108051	108053	108053	Adrian	346	" He 's an engine , my dear aunt , "
108055	108092	108053	108053	Adrian	346	" He is n't a boy , or a man , but an engine . And he appears to have been at high pressure since he came to town out all day and half the night . "
108093	108098	108099	108100	Mrs. Doria	138	" He 's mad ! "
108103	108148	108099	108100	Mrs. Doria	138	" Not at all . Extremely shrewd is Master Ricky , and carries as open an eye ahead of him as the ships before Troy . He 's more than a match for any of us . He is for me , I confess . "
108149	108152	108154	108155	Mrs. Doria	138	" Then , "
108157	108163	108154	108155	Mrs. Doria	138	" he does astonish me ! "
108279	108293	108294	108294	She	1755	" Take them off here , child , and learn to assist yourself . "
108380	108385	108386	108386	she	138	" Now , really , "
108389	108435	108386	108386	she	138	" you are too helpless , my dear . You can not do a thing without a dozen women at your elbow . What will become of you ? You will have to marry a millionaire . What 's the matter with you , child ? "
108467	108473	108475	108476	Mrs. Doria	138	" A wedding - ring ! "
108517	108534	108512	108512	Clare	147	" In the Gardens , mama . This morning . When I was walking behind Richard . "
108535	108548	108475	108476	Mrs. Doria	138	" Are you sure he did not give it you , Clare ? "
108549	108562	108512	108512	Clare	147	" Oh no , mama ! he did not give it me . "
108563	108641	108475	108476	Mrs. Doria	138	" Of course not ! only he does such absurd things ! I thought , perhaps these boys are so exceedingly ridiculous ! Mrs. Doria had an idea that it might have been concerted between the two young gentlemen , Richard and Ralph , that the former should present this token of hymeneal devotion from the latter to the young lady of his love ; but a moment 's reflection exonerated boys even from such preposterous behaviour . "
108647	108656	108644	108644	I	0	" she speculated on Clare 's cold face , "
108681	108714	108675	108675	you	3699	" Mrs. Doria kissed her . She thought it must be lucky , and the circumstance made her feel tender to her child . Her child did not move to the kiss . "
108722	108756	108675	108675	you	3699	" said Mrs. Doria , almost infantine with surprise and pleasure . Clare suffered her glove to be drawn off . The ring slid down her long thin finger , and settled comfortably . "
108760	108833	108675	108675	you	3699	" Mrs. Doria whispered . To find a wedding ring is open to any woman ; but to find a wedding - ring that fits may well cause a superstitious emotion . Moreover , that it should be found while walking in the neighbourhood of the identical youth whom a mother has destined for her daughter , gives significance to the gentle perturbation of ideas consequent on such a hint from Fortune . "
108838	108842	108675	108675	you	3699	" she pursued . "
108859	108879	108923	108923	Clare	147	" had the ring been a horseshoe Mrs. Doria would have pinked it up and dragged it obediently home , "
108929	108933	108923	108923	Clare	147	" she laughed , "
108952	109275	108923	108923	Clare	147	" The dimple in Clare 's cheek quivered . Mother and daughter had never spoken explicitly of Richard . Mrs. Doria , by exquisite management , had contrived to be sure that on one side there would be no obstacle to her project of general happiness , without , as she thought , compromising her daughter 's feelings unnecessarily . It could do no harm to an obedient young girl to hear that there was no youth in the world like a certain youth . He the prince of his generation , she might softly consent , when requested , to be his princess ; and if never requested for Mrs. Doria envisaged failure , she might easily transfer her softness to squires of lower degree . Clare had always been blindly obedient to her mother Adrian called them Mrs. Doria Battledoria and the fair Shuttlecockiana , and her mother accepted in this blind obedience the text of her entire character . It is difficult for those who think very earnestly for their children to know when their children are thinking on their own account . The exercise of their volition we construe as revolt . Our love does not like to be invalided and deposed from its command , and here I think yonder old thrush on the lawn who has just kicked the last of her lank offspring out of the nest to go shift for itself , much the kinder of the two , though sentimental people do shrug their shoulders at these unsentimental acts of the creatures who never wander from nature . Now , excess of obedience is , to one who manages most exquisitely , as bad as insurrection . Happily Mrs. Doria saw nothing in her daughter 's manner save a want of iron . Her pallor , her lassitude , the tremulous nerves in her face , exhibited an imperious requirement of the mineral . "
109291	109300	108923	108923	Clare	147	" we learn from The Pilgrim 's Scrip , "
109324	110242	109322	109322	theirs	3705	" Mrs. Doria read her daughter from her own book , and she was gay ; she laughed with Adrian at the breakfast - table , and mock - seriously joined in his jocose assertion that Clare was positively and by all hymeneal auspices betrothed to the owner of that ring , be he who he may , and must , whenever he should choose to come and claim her , give her hand to him for everybody agreed the owner must be masculine , as no woman would drop a wedding - ring , and follow him whither he listed all the world over . Amiable giggling Forey girls called Clare , The Betrothed . Dark man , or fair ? was mooted . Adrian threw off the first strophe of Clare 's fortune in burlesque rhymes , with an insinuating gipsy twang . Her aunt Forey warned her to have her dresses in readiness . Her grandpapa Forey pretended to grumble at bridal presents being expected from grandpapas . This one smelt orange - flower , another spoke solemnly of an old shoe . The finding of a wedding - ring was celebrated through all the palpitating accessories and rosy ceremonies involved by that famous instrument . In the midst of the general hilarity , Clare showed her deplorable want of iron by bursting into tears . Did the poor mocked - at heart divine what might be then enacting ? Perhaps , dimly , as we say : that is , without eyes . At an altar stand two fair young creatures , ready with their oaths . They are asked to fix all time to the moment , and they do so . If there is hesitation at the immense undertaking , it is but maidenly . She conceives as little mental doubt of the sanity of the act as he . Over them hangs a cool young curate in his raiment of office . Behind are two apparently lucid people , distinguished from each other by sex and age : the foremost a bunch of simmering black satin ; under her shadow a cock - robin in the dress of a gentleman , big joy swelling out his chest , and pert satisfaction cocking his head . These be they who stand here in place of parents to the young couple . All is well . The service proceeds . Firmly the bridegroom tells forth his words . This hour of the complacent giant at least is his , and that he means to hold him bound through the eternities , men may hear . Clearly , and with brave modesty , speaks she : no less firmly , though her body trembles : her voice just vibrating while the tone travels on , like a smitten vase . Time hears sentence pronounced on him : the frail hands bind his huge limbs and lock the chains . He is used to it : he lets them do as they will . Then comes that period when they are to give their troth to each other . The Man with his right hand takes the Woman by her right hand : the Woman with her right hand takes the Man by his right hand . Devils dare not laugh at whom Angels crowd to contemplate . Their hands are joined ; their blood flows as one stream . Adam and fair Eve front the generations . Are they not lovely ? Purer fountains of life were never in two bosoms . And then they loose their hands , and the cool curate doth bid the Man to put a ring on the Woman 's fourth finger , counting thumb . And the Man thrusts his hand into one pocket , and into another , forward and back many times into all his pockets . He remembers that he felt for it , and felt it in his waistcoat pocket , when in the Gardens . And his hand comes forth empty . And the Man is ghastly to look at ! Yet , though Angels smile , shall not Devils laugh ! The curate deliberates . The black satin bunch ceases to simmer . He in her shadow changes from a beaming cock - robin to an inquisitive sparrow . Eyes multiply questions : lips have no reply . Time ominously shakes his chain , and in the pause a sound of mockery stings their ears . Think ye a hero is one to be defeated in his first battle ? Look at the clock ! there are but seven minutes to the stroke of the celibate hours : the veteran is surely lifting his two hands to deliver fire , and his shot will sunder them in twain so nearly united . All the jewellers of London speeding down with sacks full of the nuptial circlet can not save them ! The battle must be won on the field , and what does the hero now ? It is an inspiration ! For who else would dream of such a reserve in the rear ? None see what he does ; only that the black - satin bunch is remonstratingly agitated , stormily shaken , and subdued : and as though the menacing cloud had opened , and dropped the dear token from the skies at his demand , he produces the symbol of their consent , and the service proceeds : "
110250	110342	110247	110247	thee	3706	" They are prayed over and blest . For good , or for ill , this deed is done . The names are registered ; fees fly right and left : they thank , and salute , the curate , whose official coolness melts into a smile of monastic gallantry : the beadle on the steps waves off a gaping world as they issue forth bridegroom and bridesman recklessly scatter gold on him : carriage doors are banged to : the coachmen drive off , and the scene closes , everybody happy .

111645	111648	111649	111649	she	489	" What ! "
111653	111670	111649	111649	she	489	" one 's own lawful wedding - ring you would n't give back to a body ? "
111671	111710	111711	111712	Mrs. Berry	489	" Because it is mine , Mrs. Berry . It was yours , but it is mine now . You shall have whatever you ask for but that . Pray , forgive me ! It must be so . "
111741	111838	111737	111737	She	489	" Do n't ye know , my dear , it 's the fatalest thing you 're inflictin ' upon me , reelly ! Do n't ye know that bein ' bereft of one 's own lawful wedding - ring 's the fatalest thing in life , and there 's no prosperity after it ! For what stands in place o ' that , when that 's gone , my dear ? And what could ye give me to compensate a body for the loss o ' that ? Do n't ye know Oh , deary me ! "
111855	111860	111862	111862	Lucy	132	" I know it , "

111939	112043	111934	111934	she	489	" you do n't understand . It ai n't as you think . It ai n't a hurt to you now . Not a bit , it ai n't . It makes no difference now ! Any ring does while the wearer 's a maid . And your Mr. Richard will find the very ring he intended for ye . And , of course , that 's the one you 'll wear as his wife . It 's all the same now , my dear . It 's no shame to a maid . Now do now do there 's a darlin ' ! "
112051	112055	112057	112057	Lucy	132	" Mrs. Berry , "
112059	112090	112057	112057	Lucy	132	" you know what my he spoke : ' With this ring I thee we d. ' It was with this ring . Then how could it be with another ? "
112108	112130	112101	112101	She	489	" Wo n't it be unlucky your wearin ' of the ring which served me so ? Think o ' that ! "
112131	112141	112143	112143	Lucy	132	" It may ! it may ! it may ! "
112145	112157	112143	112143	Lucy	132	" And arn't you rushin ' into it , my dear ? "
112158	112162	112163	112163	Lucy	132	" Mrs. Berry , "
112167	112202	112163	112163	Lucy	132	" it was this ring . It can not it never can be another . It was this . What it brings me I must bear . I shall wear it till I die ! "

112257	112274	112254	112255	Quoth Lucy	132	" How can he know it is not the same ; in a plain gold ring ? "
112275	112290	112212	112216	the ill - used woman	3737	" You never see so keen a eyed man in joolry as my Berry ! "
112296	112344	112212	112216	the ill - used woman	3737	" Not know , my dear ? Why , any one would know that 've got eyes in his head . There 's as much difference in wedding - rings as there 's in wedding people ! Now , do pray be reasonable , my own sweet ! "
112345	112353	112355	112355	Lucy	132	" Pray , do not ask me , "
112357	112366	112368	112368	Berry	489	" Pray , do think better of it , "
112370	112378	112380	112380	Lucy	132	" Pray , pray , Mrs. Berry ! "
112382	112398	112380	112380	Lucy	132	" And not leave your old Berry all forlorn just when you 're so happy ! "
112399	112412	112413	112413	Lucy	132	" Indeed I would not , you dear , kind old creature ! "
112423	112441	112442	112442	she	489	" Just when you 're going to be the happiest wife on earth all you want yours ! "

112475	112493	112472	112472	she	132	" I think we must not lose time in getting ready , or he will be impatient . "
112568	112579	112580	112580	she	489	" It 's like a divorce , that it is ! "
112633	112743	112627	112627	she	489	" I suppose it was to be , my dear ! It 's my punishment for meddlin ' wi ' such matters . No , I 'm not sorry . Bless ye both . Who 'd ' a thought you was so wilful ? you that any one might have taken for one of the silly - softs ! You 're a pair , my dear ! indeed you are ! You was made to meet ! But we must n't show him we 've been crying . Men do n't like it when they 're happy . Let 's wash our faces and try to bear our lot . "

Listen to me give him my letter , and do n't speak a word till he speaks . His eyebrows will go up and down , he wo n't say much . I know him . If he asks you about her , do n't be a fool , but say what you think of her sensibly "
113550	113556	113547	113547	He	158	" She 's an angel ! "
113561	113917	113557	113557	Richard	186	" Speak sensibly , I say quietly . You can say how gentle and good she is my fleur - de - luce ! And say , this was not her doing . If any one 's to blame , it 's I. I made her marry me . Then go to Lady Blandish , if you do n't find her at the house . You may say whatever you please to her . Give her my letter , and tell her I want to hear from her immediately . She has seen Lucy , and I know what she thinks of her . You will then go to Farmer Blaize . I told you Lucy happens to be his niece she has not lived long there . She lived with her aunt Desborough in France while she was a child , and can hardly be called a relative to the farmer there 's not a point of likeness between them . Poor darling ! she never knew her mother . Go to Mr. Blaize , and tell him . You will treat him just as you would treat any other gentleman . If you are civil , he is sure to be . And if he abuses me , for my sake and hers you will still treat him with respect . You hear ? And then write me a full account of all that has been said and done . You will have my address the day after to - morrow . By the way , Tom will be here this afternoon . Write out for him where to call on you the day after to - morrow , in case you have heard anything in the morning you think I ought to know at once , as Tom will join me that night . Do n't mention to anybody about my losing the ring , Ripton . I would n't have Adrian get hold of that for a thousand pounds . How on earth I came to lose it ! How well she bore it , Rip ! How beautifully she behaved ! "
113922	113926	113918	113918	Ripton	158	" An angel ! "
113939	113976	113936	113936	he	158	" You may trust your friend , Richard . Aha ! when you pulled at old Mrs. Berry I did n't know what was up . I do wish you 'd let me drink her health ? "
113977	113983	113985	113985	Richard	186	" Here 's to Penelope ! "
114135	114143	114126	114126	Lucy	132	" Good - bye , Mr. Thompson , "
114166	114175	114177	114178	Mrs. Berry	489	" I shall take good care of him , "

114199	114213	114197	114197	Richard	186	" I shall tell the police everywhere to look out for your lord . "
114214	114229	114230	114230	Berry	489	" Oh my dears ! good - bye , and Heaven bless ye both ! "
114423	114449	114450	114450	she	489	" There ! never ye mind looks ! I ai n't got a new one . Read it , and do n't ye forget it ! "
114747	114752	114753	114753	she	489	" It 's done ! "
114821	114826	114828	114829	Mrs. Berry	489	" Dear ! dear ! "
114831	114847	114828	114829	Mrs. Berry	489	" what a heap o ' cake , and no one to send it to ! "
114926	114931	114932	114932	he	158	" Ha ! ha ! "
114965	114974	114975	114975	she	489	" Why do you laugh , young man ? "
115008	115014	115015	115015	he	158	" That 's goo ' ! "
115028	115032	115015	115015	he	158	" No friend ! "
115033	115042	115043	115043	she	489	" I did not say , no friend , "
115046	115066	115043	115043	she	489	" I said , no one ; meanin ' , I know not where for to send it to . "
115074	115087	115067	115067	Ripton	158	" You put a Griffin on that cake . Wheatsheaves each side . "
115088	115092	115093	115094	Mrs. Berry	489	" His crest ? "
115098	115105	115093	115094	Mrs. Berry	489	" Oldest baronetcy ' n England ! "
115109	115112	115093	115094	Mrs. Berry	489	" Yes ? "
115119	115151	115113	115114	Mrs. Berry	489	" You think he 's Richards . We 're oblige ' be very close . And she 's the most lovely ! If I hear man say thing ' gainst her . "
115152	115165	115167	115168	Mrs. Berry	489	" You need n't for to cry over her , young man , "
115170	115203	115167	115168	Mrs. Berry	489	" I wanted for to drink their right healths by their right names , and then go about my day 's work , and I do hope you wo n't keep me . "
115212	115216	115217	115217	he	158	" You do ? "
115589	115596	115598	115598	Adrian	346	" A fine morning , ma'am , "
115600	115605	115598	115598	Adrian	346	" It have been ! "
115631	115637	115639	115639	Adrian	346	" A very fine Spring , "
115652	115654	115646	115647	Mrs. Berry	489	" weather "
115738	115748	115749	115749	he	346	" I presume these are Mr. Thompson 's lodgings ? "
115780	115783	115785	115785	Adrian	346	" No ? "
115796	115805	115785	115785	Adrian	346	" Mr. Feverel is out , I suppose ? "
115828	115834	115836	115836	Adrian	346	" Mr. Feverel 's man , "
115838	115894	115836	115836	Adrian	346	" told me I should be certain to find him here . I thought he would be with his friend , Mr. Thompson . I 'm too late , I perceive . Their entertainment is over . I fancy you have been having a party of them here , ma'am ? a bachelors ' breakfast ! "
115937	115949	115934	115934	she	489	" Sir , may I beg for to know your name ? "
115968	115986	115965	115965	she	489	" And you are Mr. Harley , that was oh ! and you 've come for Mr. ? "
115999	116015	116016	116017	Mrs. Berry	489	" Oh ! and it 's no mistake , and he 's of Raynham Abbey ? "
116036	116043	116052	116052	her	489	" His father 's Sir Austin ? "
116061	116073	116074	116074	she	489	" Oh , then , what have I been and done ! "
116084	116159	116074	116074	she	489	" I been and married my baby ! I been and married the bread out of my own mouth . O Mr. Harley ! Mr. Harley ! I knew you when you was a boy that big , and wore jackets ; and all of you . And it 's my softness that 's my ruin , for I never can resist a man 's asking . Look at that cake , Mr. Harley ! "
116167	116174	116175	116175	he	346	" Wedding - cake , ma'am ! "
116178	116188	116175	116175	he	346	" Bride - cake it is , Mr. Harley ! "
116189	116198	116217	116217	she	489	" Did you make it yourself , ma'am ? "
116234	116245	116246	116246	she	489	" I did not make it myself , Mr. Harley , "
116249	116393	116246	116246	she	489	" It 's a bought cake , and I 'm a lost woman . Little I dreamed when I had him in my arms a baby that I should some day be marrying him out of my own house ! I little dreamed that ! Oh , why did he come to me ! Do n't you remember his old nurse , when he was a baby in arms , that went away so sudden , and no fault of hers , Mr. Harley ! The very mornin ' after the night you got into Mr. Benson 's cellar , and got so tipsy on his Madeary I remember it as clear as yesterday ! and Mr. Benson was that angry he threatened to use the whip to you , and I helped put you to bed . I 'm that very woman . "
116406	116413	116414	116414	he	346	" Well , ma'am ! well ? "
116425	116436	116437	116438	Mrs. Berry	489	" Wo n't you see it all , kind sir ? "
116493	116498	116499	116499	he	346	" Well , ma'am ? "
116509	116540	116504	116505	Mrs. Berry	489	" It were done this mornin ' , Mr. Harley , in the church , at half - past eleven of the clock , or twenty to , by licence . "
116552	116555	116556	116556	he	346	" Oh ! "
116575	116591	116556	116556	he	346	" Somebody was married this morning ; was it Mr. Thompson , or Mr. Feverel ? "
116608	116621	116592	116593	Mrs. Berry	489	" Do he look like a new married bridegroom , Mr. Harley ? "
116631	116641	116642	116642	he	346	" This young gentleman was at church this morning ? "
116645	116654	116642	116642	he	346	" Oh ! quite reasonable and proper then , "
116662	116668	116655	116656	Mrs. Berry	489	" Of course , ma'am . "
116688	116742	116669	116669	Adrian	346	" You were all reasonable and proper , ma'am . The principal male performer , then , is my cousin , Mr. Feverel ? He was married by you , this morning , by licence at your parish church , and came here , and ate a hearty breakfast , and left intoxicated . "
116748	116791	116743	116744	Mrs. Berry	489	" He never drink a drop , sir . A more moderate young gentleman you never see . Oh ! do n't ye think that now , Mr. Harley . He was as upright and master of his mind as you be . "
116792	116795	116796	116798	the wise youth	746	" Ay ! "
116807	116816	116796	116798	the wise youth	746	" I mean the other form of intoxication . "
117046	117050	117052	117054	the sobbing culprit	3837	" One wrench , "
117056	117065	117052	117054	the sobbing culprit	3837	" one , and my ring was off ! "
117095	117108	117110	117110	Adrian	346	" I daresay you were exceedingly sorry for what you had done , "
117112	117117	117119	117119	Berry	489	" Indeed , sir , "
117121	117128	117119	117119	Berry	489	" I were , and am . "
117129	117143	117184	117185	Mrs. Berry	489	" And would do your best to rectify the mischief eh , ma'am ? "
117144	117155	117156	117156	she	489	" Indeed , and indeed , sir , I would , "
117160	117183	117156	117156	she	489	" As , of course , you should knowing the family . Where may these lunatics have gone to spend the Moon ? "
117189	117201	117202	117202	she	489	" To the Isle I do n't quite know , sir ! "
117239	117256	117221	117221	she	489	" To - morrow , if you please , Mr. Harley : not to - day ! "
117257	117262	117263	117263	Adrian	346	" A pleasant spot , "
117337	117343	117344	117344	he	346	" Very well , ma'am , "
117370	117506	117344	117344	he	346	" I will tell him you were only a blind agent in the affair , being naturally soft , and that you trust he will bless the consummation . He will be in town to - morrow morning ; but one of you two must see him to - night . An emetic kindly administered will set our friend here on his legs . A bath and a clean shirt , and he might go . I do n't see why your name should appear at all . Brush him up , and send him to Bellingham by the seven o'clock train . He will find his way to Raynham ; he knows the neighbourhood best in the dark . Let him go and state the case . Remember , one of you must go . "
117538	117542	117535	117535	Adrian	346	" Good morning . "
117549	117563	117543	117544	Mrs. Berry	489	" You wo n't refuse a piece of his cake , Mr. Harley ? "
117564	117573	117574	117574	Adrian	346	" Oh , dear , no , ma'am , "
117582	117647	117574	117574	Adrian	346	" I shall claim a very large piece . Richard has a great many friends who will rejoice to eat his wedding - cake . Cut me a fair quarter , Mrs. Berry . Put it in paper , if you please . I shall be delighted to carry it to them , and apportion it equitably according to their several degrees of relationship . "
117782	117788	117790	117790	Adrian	346	" So dies the System ! "
117797	117827	117828	117828	he	346	" And now let prophets roar ! He dies respectably in a marriage - bed , which is more than I should have foretold of the monster . Meantime , "
117836	117843	117828	117828	he	346	" I 'll go sow nightmares . "
118586	118596	118597	118597	he	334	" Ah ! glad you 've come , Adrian , "
118605	118700	118597	118597	he	334	" I was afraid I should have to ride down . This is kind of you . We 'll walk down together through the park . It 's absolutely dangerous to walk alone in these streets . My opinion is , that orange - peel lasts all through the year now , and will till legislation puts a stop to it . I give you my word I slipped on a piece of orange - peel yesterday afternoon in Piccadilly , and I thought I was down ! I saved myself by a miracle . "
118701	118710	118712	118712	Adrian	346	" You have an appetite , I hope ? "
118714	118729	118731	118731	Hippias	334	" I think I shall get one , after a bit of a walk , "
118733	118743	118731	118731	Hippias	334	" Yes . I think I feel hungry now . "
118744	118750	118752	118752	Adrian	346	" Charmed to hear it , "
118763	118770	118771	118771	he	346	" How should you define Folly ? "
118778	118781	118771	118771	he	346	" Hm ! "
118799	118811	118787	118787	himself	334	" I think I should define it to be a slide . "
118812	118867	118868	118868	Hippias	334	" Very good definition . In other words , a piece of orange - peel ; once on it , your life and limbs are in danger , and you are saved by a miracle . You must present that to the Pilgrim . And the monument of folly , what would that be ? "
118872	118883	118884	118884	He	334	" All the human race on one another 's shoulders . "
118894	118898	118884	118884	He	334	" Very good , "
118902	118930	118931	118931	Adrian	346	" or in default of that , some symbol of the thing , say ; such as this of which I have here brought you a chip . "
118939	118948	118931	118931	Adrian	346	" This is the monument made portable eh ? "
118949	118952	118954	118954	Hippias	334	" Cake ! "
118966	118984	118985	118985	he	334	" You 're right of them that eat it . If I if I do n't mistake , "
118990	119028	118985	118985	he	334	" the noxious composition bedizened in that way is what they call wedding - cake . It 's arrant poison ! Who is it you want to kill ? What are you carrying such stuff about for ? "
119037	119114	119115	119115	he	334	" To present you with your due and proper portion . You will have friends and relatives , and ca n't be saved from them , not even by miracle . It is a habit which exhibits , perhaps , the unconscious inherent cynicism of the human mind , for people who consider that they have reached the acme of mundane felicity , to distribute this token of esteem to their friends , with the object probably "
119131	119247	119248	119248	He	334	" of enabling those friends these edifices require very delicate incision each particular currant and subtle condiment hangs to its neighbour a wedding - cake is evidently the most highly civilized of cakes , and partakes of the evils as well as the advantages of civilization ! I was saying , they send us these love - tokens , no doubt we shall have to weigh out the crumbs , if each is to have his fair share that we may the better estimate their state of bliss by passing some hours in purgatory . This , as far as I can apportion it without weights and scales , is your share , my uncle ! "
119261	119265	119248	119248	He	334	" Get away ! "
119276	119326	119266	119266	Hippias	334	" I 'll have none of it , I tell you ! It 's death ! It 's fifty times worse than that beastly compound Christmas pudding ! What fool has been doing this , then ? Who dares send me cake ? Me ! It 's an insult . "
119327	119338	119340	119340	Adrian	346	" You are not compelled to eat any before dinner , "
119351	119442	119340	119340	Adrian	346	" but your share you must take , and appear to consume . One who has done so much to bring about the marriage can not in conscience refuse his allotment of the fruits . Maidens , I hear , first cook it under their pillows , and extract nuptial dreams therefrom said to be of a lighter class , taken that way . It 's a capital cake , and , upon my honour , you have helped to make it you have indeed ! So here it is . "
119466	119479	119450	119450	He	334	" There ! ... My appetite 's gone for to - day ! "
119480	119497	119499	119499	Adrian	346	" Then shall I tell Richard that you wo n't touch a morsel of his cake ? "
119515	119518	119499	119499	Adrian	346	" Richard ? "
119519	119614	119450	119450	He	334	" Yes , your nephew : my cousin : Richard ! Your companion since you 've been in town . He 's married , you know . Married this morning at Kensington parish church , by licence , at half - past eleven of the clock , or twenty to . Married , and gone to spend his honeymoon in the Isle of Wight , a very delectable place for a month 's residence . I have to announce to you that , thanks to your assistance , the experiment is launched , sir ! "
119615	119619	119499	119499	Adrian	346	" Richard married ! "
119671	119692	119645	119645	His	334	" Surely you knew all about it ? you were so anxious to have him in town under your charge .... "
119693	119696	119697	119697	Hippias	334	" Married ? "
119704	119717	119697	119697	Hippias	334	" Why , he 's under age ! he 's an infant . "
119718	119787	119645	119645	His	334	" So he is . But the infant is not the less married . Fib like a man and pay your fee what does it matter ? Any one who is breeched can obtain a licence in our noble country . And the interests of morality demand that it should not be difficult . Is it true can you persuade anybody that you have known nothing about it ? "
119788	119808	119810	119810	Hippias	334	" Ha ! infamous joke ! I wish , sir , you would play your pranks on somebody else , "
119822	119837	119810	119810	Hippias	334	" You 've done me up for the day , I can assure you . "
119880	119917	119872	119872	Hippias	334	" This accounts for his conduct to me . That boy must have a cunning nothing short of infernal ! I feel ... I feel it just here , he drew a hand along his midriff . "
119928	119938	119872	119872	Hippias	334	" he added faintly , and shut his eyes . "
119957	119974	119872	119872	Hippias	334	" Shortly after , Hippias went to bed , saying to himself , as he undressed , "
119986	119996	119983	119984	Poor Austin	465	" and as the pillow swelled over his ears , "
120012	120080	120081	120081	I	0	" The Dyspepsy had bought his philosophy at a heavy price ; he had a right to use it . Adrian resumed the procession of the cake . He sighted his melancholy uncle Algernon hunting an appetite in the Row , and looking as if the hope ahead of him were also one - legged . The Captain did not pass with out querying the ungainly parcel . "
120089	120093	120083	120083	I	0	" said Adrian . "
120223	120232	120233	120233	Thompson	158	" Algernon let off steam in a whistle . "
120240	120244	120233	120233	Thompson	158	" he said . "
120267	120270	120271	120271	Adrian	346	" No . "
120276	120342	120271	120271	Adrian	346	" ' Tis a Miss Desborough , a Roman Catholic dairymaid . Reminds one of pastoral England in the time of the Plantagenets ! He 's quite equal to introducing her as Thompson 's daughter , and himself as Beelzebub 's son . However , the wild animal is in Hymen 's chains , and the cake is cut . Will you have your morsel ? "
120343	120353	120354	120354	Algernon	140	" Oh , by all means ! not now . "
120362	120367	120354	120354	Algernon	140	" Father know it ? "
120368	120381	120271	120271	Adrian	346	" Not yet . He will to - night by nine o'clock . "
120382	120398	120399	120399	He	140	" Then I must see him by seven . Do n't say you met me . "
120407	120411	120413	120413	Adrian	346	" Wants money ! "
120485	120493	120476	120477	The Pilgrim	265	" She is always at Nature 's breast "
120734	120746	120748	120748	Adrian	346	" Seen him ? no ! Heard of him ? yes ! "
120750	120783	120748	120748	Adrian	346	" I have heard of him . I heard that he was sublimely happy , and had eaten such a breakfast that dinner was impossible ; claret and cold chicken , cake and "
120784	120789	120790	120790	they	3929	" Cake at breakfast ! "
120794	120804	120790	120790	they	3929	" That seems to be his fancy just now . "
120805	120811	120748	120748	Adrian	346	" What an extraordinary taste ! "
120812	120823	120824	120828	One fast young male Forey	3930	" You know , he is educated on a System . "
120893	120915	120888	120889	Mrs. Doria	138	" Oh ! fish - cake , I suppose ! I wish he understood a little better the obligations of relationship . "
120916	120927	120929	120929	Adrian	346	" Whether he understands them , I ca n't say , "
120931	120944	120929	120929	Adrian	346	" but I assure you he is very energetic in extending them . "
120987	120999	121000	121001	Mrs. Doria	138	" Was his appointment at the house of those Grandison people ? "
121019	121029	121011	121011	Adrian	346	" Do they keep a beadle at the door ? "
121048	121054	121055	121055	she	138	" I daresay they do , "
121058	121065	121055	121055	she	138	" And a curate on hand ? "
121066	121075	121076	121078	Old Mr. Forey	468	" Oh , I should think a dozen ! "
121213	121220	121221	121221	he	346	" I want to ask you , "
121224	121235	121221	121221	he	346	" whether an infant in law can legally bind himself . "
121236	121255	121257	121257	Brandon	384	" If he 's old enough to affix his signature to an instrument , I suppose he can , "
121259	121267	121257	121257	Brandon	384	" Is he responsible for his acts ? "
121268	121278	121221	121221	he	346	" I 've no doubt we could hang him . "
121279	121294	121221	121221	he	346	" Then what he could do for himself , you could do for him ? "
121295	121304	121257	121257	Brandon	384	" Not quite so much ; pretty near . "
121305	121313	121221	121221	he	346	" For instance , he can marry ? "
121314	121325	121221	121221	he	346	" That 's not a criminal case , you know . "
121326	121333	121257	121257	Brandon	384	" And the marriage is valid ? "
121334	121340	121221	121221	he	346	" You can dispute it . "
121341	121357	121221	121221	he	346	" Yes , and the Greeks and the Trojans can fight . It holds then ? "
121358	121364	121365	121369	The patriarch of the table	3942	" Both water and fire ! "
121384	121390	121392	121392	Adrian	346	" Dear me , sir ! "
121394	121431	121392	121392	Adrian	346	" I beg pardon . The circumstances must excuse me . The fact is , my cousin Richard got married to a dairymaid this morning , and I wanted to know whether it held in law . "
121454	121459	121221	121221	he	346	" Deuce he has ! "
121462	121466	121221	121221	he	346	" A dairymaid ! "
121467	121480	121481	121481	Adrian	346	" I thought it better to let the ladies dine in peace , "
121484	121494	121481	121481	Adrian	346	" I wanted to be able to console my aunt "
121495	121503	121504	121506	the old gentleman	8160	" Well , but well , but , "
121514	121590	121504	121506	the old gentleman	8160	" eh , Brandon ? He 's a boy , this young ass ! Do you mean to tell me a boy can go and marry when he pleases , and any troll he pleases , and the marriage is good ? If I thought that I 'd turn every woman off my premises . I would ! from the housekeeper to the scullery - maid . I 'd have no woman near him till till "
121591	121601	121603	121603	Brandon	384	" Till the young greenhorn was grey , sir ? "
121605	121617	121618	121620	the old gentleman	8160	" Till he knew what women are made of , sir ! "
121626	121641	121618	121620	the old gentleman	8160	" What , d'ye think , will Feverel say to it , Mr. Adrian ? "
121642	121684	121504	121506	the old gentleman	8160	" He has been trying the very System you have proposed sir one that does not reckon on the powerful action of curiosity on the juvenile intelligence . I 'm afraid it 's the very worst way of solving the problem . "
121685	121691	121693	121693	Clarence	147	" Of course it is , "
121695	121701	121693	121693	Clarence	147	" None but a fool ! "
121702	121707	121708	121708	Adrian	346	" At your age , "
121713	121839	121708	121708	Adrian	346	" it is natural , my dear Clarence , that you should consider the idea of an isolated or imprisoned manhood something monstrous , and we do not expect you to see what amount of wisdom it contains . You follow one extreme , and we the other . I do n't say that a middle course exists . The history of mankind shows our painful efforts to find one , but they have invariably resolved themselves into asceticism , or laxity , acting and reacting . The moral question is , if a naughty little man , by reason of his naughtiness , releases himself from foolishness , does a foolish little man , by reason of his foolishness , save himself from naughtiness ? "
121892	121896	121897	121897	he	346	" Very well , "
121976	121980	121982	121982	Adrian	346	" Dear me ! "
121984	121998	121982	121982	Adrian	346	" does the Law recognize that ? Why , that 's almost human ! "
122017	122024	122025	122025	he	346	" What can be the matter ? "
122133	122138	122139	122140	Mrs. Doria	138	" Here ! Adrian ! "
122143	122214	122139	122140	Mrs. Doria	138	" Where is Adrian ? Pray , come here . Tell me ! Where did this cake come from ? Whose is it ? What does it do here ? You know all about it , for you brought it . Clare saw you bring it into the room . What does it mean ? I insist upon a direct answer . Now do not make me impatient , Adrian . "
122238	122247	122248	122248	Adrian	346	" I was really bound to bring it , "
122251	122255	122248	122248	Adrian	346	" Answer me ! "
122261	122318	122256	122258	The wise youth	746	" Categorically . This cake came from the house of a person , a female , of the name of Berry . It belongs to you partly , partly to me , partly to Clare , and to the rest of our family , on the principle of equal division for which purpose it is present .... "
122319	122324	122248	122248	Adrian	346	" Yes ! Speak ! "
122325	122342	122256	122258	The wise youth	746	" It means , my dear aunt , what that kind of cake usually does mean . "
122343	122362	122363	122364	Mrs. Doria	138	" This , then , is the Breakfast ! And the ring ! Adrian ! where is Richard ? "
122390	122398	122399	122399	she	138	" The wretched boy has ruined himself ! "
122489	122518	122481	122483	the wise youth	746	" He was married this morning at half - past eleven of the clock , or twenty to twelve , by licence , at the Kensington parish church . "
122519	122526	122527	122528	Mrs. Doria	138	" Then that was his appointment ! "
122531	122539	122527	122528	Mrs. Doria	138	" That was the cake for breakfast ! "
122547	122554	122556	122557	a third	3960	" And it was his ring ! "
122585	122595	122575	122575	She	138	" Is it that abominable country person , Adrian ? "
122596	122611	122613	122613	Adrian	346	" The happy damsel is , I regret to say , the Papist dairymaid , "
122636	122639	122632	122633	Mrs. Doria	138	" Brandon ! "
122654	122657	122658	122658	she	138	" Brandon , "
122666	122719	122658	122658	she	138	" can they not be followed , and separated ? I want your advice . Can not we separate them ? A boy ! it is really shameful if he should be allowed to fall into the toils of a designing creature to ruin himself irrevocably . Can we not , Brandon ? "
122734	122750	122729	122729	he	3966	" From what I hear of the young groom I should imagine the office perilous . "
122751	122779	122658	122658	she	138	" I 'm speaking of law , Brandon . Can we not obtain an order from one of your Courts to pursue them and separate them instantly ? "
122780	122784	122729	122729	he	3966	" This evening ? "
122785	122788	122789	122789	Brandon	384	" Yes ! "
122799	122811	122812	122812	Brandon	384	" You might call on one of your Judges , Brandon . "
122834	122920	122921	122921	Brandon	384	" Will you do so to - morrow , the first thing in the morning ? Will you promise me to do so , Brandon ? Or a magistrate ! A magistrate would send a policeman after them . My dear Brandon ! I beg I beg you to assist us in this dreadful extremity . It will be the death of my poor brother . I believe he would forgive anything but this . You have no idea what his notions are of blood . "
122933	122940	122942	122944	the wise youth	746	" What is it , aunt ? "
122946	122958	122942	122944	the wise youth	746	" You want them followed and torn asunder by wild policemen ? "
122959	122964	122965	122965	Brandon	384	" To - morrow ! "
122969	122978	122979	122979	Adrian	346	" Wo n't that be just too late ? "
122993	122997	122999	122999	Adrian	346	" You see , "
123001	123006	122999	122999	Adrian	346	" Yes ! yes ! "
123017	123084	123085	123085	she	138	" Pray be quiet , Adrian , and let me speak . Brandon ! it can not be ! it 's quite impossible ! Can you stand there and tell me that boy is legally married ? I never will believe it ! The law can not be so shamefully bad as to permit a boy a mere child to do such absurd things . Grandpapa ! "
123092	123129	123085	123085	she	138	" Grandpapa ! pray do make Brandon speak . These lawyers never will . He might stop it , if he would . If I were a man , do you think I would stand here ? "
123130	123136	123137	123139	the old gentleman	8160	" Well , my dear , "
123145	123190	123137	123139	the old gentleman	8160	" I 'm quite of your opinion . I believe he knows no more than you or I. My belief is they none of them know anything till they join issue and go into Court . I want to see a few female lawyers . "
123191	123200	123202	123202	Adrian	346	" To encourage the bankrupt perruquier , sir ? "
123204	123218	123202	123202	Adrian	346	" They would have to keep a large supply of wigs on hand . "
123219	123227	123228	123229	his aunt	3682	" And you can jest , Adrian ! "
123233	123336	123228	123229	his aunt	3682	" But I will not be beaten . I know I am firmly convinced that no law would ever allow a boy to disgrace his family and ruin himself like that , and nothing shall persuade me that it is so . Now , tell me , Brandon , and pray do speak in answer to my questions , and please to forget you are dealing with a woman . Can my nephew be rescued from the consequences of his folly ? Is what he has done legitimate ? Is he bound for life by what he has done while a boy ? "
123340	123347	123348	123349	A hm	3974	" Brandon breathed through his teeth . "
123363	123364	123361	123361	Helen	272	" "
123371	123375	123376	123377	A hm	3974	" Adrian remarked . "
123381	123385	123376	123377	A hm	3974	" pursued Brandon . "
123403	123405	123376	123377	A hm	3974	" ... "
123408	123417	123376	123377	A hm	3974	" the eager woman hastened his lagging mouth . "
123446	123448	123435	123435	you	3975	" ... "
123464	123465	123462	123462	Brandon	384	" "
123480	123482	123483	123483	She	3980	" ... "
123488	123494	123483	123483	She	3980	" Mrs. Doria joyfully interjected . "
123529	123531	123532	123532	He	3978	" ... "
123539	123544	123532	123532	He	3978	" cried Mrs. Doria . "
123548	123561	123545	123545	I	0	" she appeared to reflect , and then faltered imploringly to Adrian , "
123568	123590	123545	123545	I	0	" The kind wise youth could not find it in his heart to strike away the phantom straw she caught at . "
123600	123627	123545	123545	I	0	" he muttered ; and found it necessary at the same time to duck and turn his head for concealment . Mrs. Doria surpassed his expectations . "
123634	123669	123670	123670	Richard	186	" Brandon was resuming with a shrug , which was meant to say he still pledged himself to nothing , when Clare 's voice was heard from out the buzzing circle of her cousins : "
123684	123685	123682	123682	mama	7913	" "
123690	123691	123692	123692	He	186	" "
123697	123705	123695	123695	mama	7913	" Clare 's voice was very steadfast . "
123717	123718	123714	123714	you	1705	" "
123732	123752	123730	123730	mama	7913	" Mrs. Doria fought the fact by years and finally by months . Clare was too strong for her . "
123756	123769	123754	123754	child	1705	" she mentally apostrophized the girl who scornfully rejected straws while drowning . "
123777	123839	123840	123840	I	0	" she comforted herself , and sat down to cogitate . The men smiled and looked vacuous . Music was proposed . There are times when soft music hath not charms ; when it is put to as base uses as Imperial Caesar 's dust and is taken to fill horrid pauses . Angelica Forey thumped the piano , and sang : "
123854	124160	124161	124161	Adrian	346	" Matilda Forey and her cousin Mary Branksburne wedded their voices , and songfully incited all young people to Haste to the bower that love has built , and defy the wise ones of the world ; but the wise ones of the world were in a majority there , and very few places of assembly will be found where they are not ; so the glowing appeal of the British ballad - monger passed into the bosom of the emptiness he addressed . Clare was asked to entertain the company . The singular child calmly marched to the instrument , and turned over the appropriate illustrations to the ballad - monger 's repertory . Clare sang a little Irish air . Her duty done , she marched from the piano . Mothers are rarely deceived by their daughters in these matters ; but Clare deceived her mother ; and Mrs. Doria only persisted in feeling an agony of pity for her child , that she might the more warrantably pity herself a not uncommon form of the emotion , for there is no juggler like that heart the ballad - monger puts into our mouths so boldly . Remember that she saw years of self - denial , years of a ripening scheme , rendered fruitless in a minute , and by the System which had almost reduced her to the condition of constitutional hypocrite . She had enough of bitterness to brood over , and some excuse for self - pity . Still , even when she was cooler , Mrs. Doria 's energetic nature prevented her from giving up . Straws were straws , and the frailer they were the harder she clutched them . She rose from her chair , and left the room , calling to Adrian to follow her . "
124163	124174	124175	124175	you	346	" she said , turning upon him in the passage , "
124201	124238	124192	124192	you	346	" The wise youth had not bargained for personal servitude . He had hoped he should be in time for the last act of the opera that night , after enjoying the comedy of real life . "
124241	124249	124192	124192	you	346	aunt" ... he was beginning to insinuate . "
124263	124683	124192	124192	you	346	" said Mrs. Doria . There was nothing for it but to obey . He stamped his assent to the Pilgrim 's dictum , that Women are practical creatures , and now reflected on his own account , that relationship to a young fool may be a vexation and a nuisance . However , Mrs. Doria compensated him . What Mrs. Doria intended to do , the practical creature did not plainly know ; but her energy positively demanded to be used in some way or other , and her instinct directed her to the offender on whom she could use it in wrath . She wanted somebody to be angry with , somebody to abuse . She dared not abuse her brother to his face : him she would have to console . Adrian was a fellow - hypocrite to the System , and would , she was aware , bring her into painfully delicate , albeit highly philosophic , ground by a discussion of the case . So she drove to Bessy Berry simply to inquire whither her nephew had flown . When a soft woman , and that soft woman a sinner , is matched with a woman of energy , she does not show much fight , and she meets no mercy . Bessy Berry 's creditor came to her in female form that night . She then beheld it in all its terrors . Hitherto it had appeared to her as a male , a disembodied spirit of her imagination possessing male attributes , and the peculiar male characteristic of being moved , and ultimately silenced , by tears . As female , her creditor was terrible indeed . Still , had it not been a late hour , Bessy Berry would have died rather than speak openly that her babes had sped to make their nest in the Isle of Wight . They had a long start , they were out of the reach of pursuers , they were safe , and she told what she had to tell . She told more than was wise of her to tell . She made mention of her early service in the family , and of her little pension . Alas ! her little pension ! Her creditor had come expecting no payment come ; as creditors are wo nt in such moods , just to take it out of her to employ the familiar term . At once Mrs. Doria pounced upon the pension . "
124696	124871	124689	124689	you	3992	" she said in the calmest manner , and Berry did not plead for the little bit of bread to her . She only asked a little consideration for her feelings . True admirers of women had better stand aside from the scene . Undoubtedly it was very sad for Adrian to be compelled to witness it . Mrs. Doria was not generous . The Pilgrim may be wrong about the sex not growing ; but its fashion of conducting warfare we must allow to be barbarous , and according to what is deemed the pristine , or wild cat , method . Ruin , nothing short of it , accompanied poor Berry to her bed that night , and her character bled till morning on her pillow . The scene over , Adrian reconducted Mrs. Doria to her home . Mice had been at the cake during her absence apparently . The ladies and gentlemen present put it on the greedy mice , who were accused of having gorged and gone to bed . "
124880	124885	124872	124872	I	0	" said Mrs. Doria . "
124997	125050	125051	125052	Poor Richard	477	" Mrs. Doria 's fine scheme had become so much a part of her life , that she could not give it up . She took Clare to her bed , and caressed and wept over her , as she would not have done had she known the singular child , saying , "
125071	125110	125111	125111	I	0	" Of the two the mother showed the greater want of iron on this occasion . Clare lay in her arms rigid and emotionless , with one of her hands tight - locked . All she said was : "
125120	125231	125111	125111	I	0	" She slept clasping Richard 's nuptial ring . By this time all specially concerned in the System knew it . The honeymoon was shoring placidly above them . Is not happiness like another circulating medium ? When we have a very great deal of it , some poor hearts are aching for what is taken away from them . When we have gone out and seized it on the highways , certain inscrutable laws are sure to be at work to bring us to the criminal bar , sooner or later . Who knows the honeymoon that did not steal somebody 's sweetness ? Richard Turpin went forth , singing "
125235	125248	125378	125378	they	4003	" to the world : Richard Feverel has done the same , substituting "
125250	125252	125378	125378	they	4003	" for "
125255	125347	125378	125378	they	4003	" frequently synonyms . The coin he wanted he would have , and was just as much a highway robber as his fellow Dick , so that those who have failed to recognize him as a hero before , may now regard him in that light . Meanwhile the world he has squeezed looks exceedingly patient and beautiful . His coin chinks delicious music to him . Nature and the order of things on earth have no warmer admirer than a jolly brigand or a young man made happy by the Jews .
125908	125926	125889	125889	he	186	" You see , Emmeline , it is useless to base any system on a human being . "
126026	126030	126031	126031	she	990	" My friend , "
126042	126124	126031	126031	she	990	" I know how deeply you must be grieved . I know what your disappointment must be . I do not beg of you to forgive him now . You can not doubt his love for this young person , and according to his light , has he not behaved honourably , and as you would have wished , rather than bring her to shame ? You will think of that . It has been an accident a misfortune a terrible misfortune "
126126	126141	126142	126143	Sir Austin	186	" The God of this world is in the machine not out of it , "
126204	126210	126211	126211	he	186	" You know , Emmeline , "
126214	126276	126211	126211	he	186	" I believe very little in the fortune , or misfortune , to which men attribute their successes and reverses . They are useful impersonations to novelists ; but my opinion is sufficiently high of flesh and blood to believe that we make our own history without intervention . Accidents ? Terrible misfortunes ? What are they ? Good - night . "
126277	126282	126283	126283	she	990	" Good - night , "
126291	126322	126283	126283	she	990	" When I said , ' misfortune , ' I meant , of course , that he is to blame ; but shall I leave you his letter to me ? "
126323	126333	126334	126334	he	186	" I think I have enough to meditate upon , "
126340	126345	126346	126346	she	990	" God bless you , "
126349	126362	126346	126346	she	990	" And may I say it ? do not shut your heart . "
126688	126745	126682	126683	the devil	6445	" Only be quiet : do nothing : resolutely do nothing : your object now is to keep a brave face to the world , so that all may know you superior to this human nature that has deceived you . For it is the shameless deception , not the marriage , that has wounded you . "
126746	126749	126751	126752	the baronet	609	" Ay ! "
126754	126789	126791	126791	he	609	" the shameless deception , not the marriage : wicked and ruinous as it must be ; a destroyer of my tenderest hopes ! my dearest schemes ! Not the marriage the shameless deception ! "
126832	126875	126829	126829	he	609	" And your System : if you would be brave to the world , have courage to cast the dream of it out of you : relinquish an impossible project ; see it as it is dead : too good for men ! "
126876	126879	126881	126882	the baronet	609	" Ay ! "
126884	126895	126829	126829	he	609	" all who would save them perish on the Cross ! "
126995	127000	127002	127003	his familiar	4053	" Mere outward gilding ! "
127005	127008	127009	127009	he	4053	" Yes , "
127012	127040	127009	127009	he	4053	" I daresay this one never positively plotted to deceive his father : he followed his appetites unchecked , and is internally the sounder of the two . "
127067	127081	127083	127084	the monitor	4054	" Miss Random , I fear very much , is a necessary establishment ! "
127086	127103	127083	127084	the monitor	4054	" Does the evil in us demand its natural food , or it corrupts the whole ? "
127108	127145	127105	127106	Sir Austin	186	" And is no angel of avail till that is drawn off ? And is that our conflict to see whether we can escape the contagion of its embrace , and come uncorrupted out of that ? "
127146	127155	127157	127158	the voice	4055	" The world is wise in its way , "
127160	127170	127171	127171	he	186	" Though it look on itself through Port wine ? "
127179	127189	127191	127192	the voice	4055	" Wise in not seeking to be too wise , "
127194	127204	127191	127192	the voice	4055	" And getting intoxicated on its drug of comfort ! "
127205	127211	127157	127158	the voice	4055	" Human nature is weak . "
127212	127226	127191	127192	the voice	4055	" And Miss Random is an establishment , and Wild Oats an institution ! "
127227	127234	127191	127192	the voice	4055	" It always has been so . "
127235	127241	127157	127158	the voice	4055	" And always will be ? "
127242	127255	127191	127192	the voice	4055	" So I fear ! in spite of your very noble efforts . "
127256	127265	127266	127266	Richard	186	" And leads whither ? And ends where ? "
127726	127730	127734	127734	he	186	" Do nothing , "
127743	127755	127734	127734	he	186	" Take me into you and do n't cast me out . "
127940	127944	127945	127945	she	489	" My friend , "
127954	127974	127945	127945	she	489	" I feared I should find you here . I could not sleep . How is it with you ? "
127975	127982	127983	127983	he	186	" Well ! Emmeline , well ! "
128154	128171	128172	128172	She	990	" Oh , my friend ! may I believe you ? May I speak to you ? "
128178	128263	128172	128172	She	990	" You know my heart . I have no better ambition than to be your friend . Surely I divide your grief , and may I not claim your confidence ? Who has wept more over your great and dreadful sorrows ? I would not have come to you , but I do believe that sorrow shared relieves the burden , and it is now that you may feel a woman 's aid , and something of what a woman could be to you .... "
128264	128268	128269	128269	he	346	" Be assured , "
128273	128284	128269	128269	he	346	" I thank you , Emmeline , for your intentions . "
128285	128362	128172	128172	She	990	" No , no ! not for my intentions ! And do not thank me . Think of him ... think of your dear boy ... Our Richard , as we have called him . Oh ! do not think it a foolish superstition of mine , but I have had a thought this night that has kept me in torment till I rose to speak to you ... Tell me first you have forgiven him . "
128363	128375	128172	128172	She	990	" A father bears no malice to his son , Emmeline . "
128376	128383	128269	128269	he	346	" Your heart has forgiven him ? "
128384	128393	128172	128172	She	990	" My heart has taken what he gave . "
128394	128400	128172	128172	She	990	" And quite forgiven him ? "
128401	128410	128411	128412	The lady	990	" You will hear no complaints of mine . "
128430	128445	128446	128446	He	4085	" Yes ! I know how noble you are , and different from others ! "
128457	128467	128446	128446	He	4085	" You ought to be in bed , Emmeline . "
128468	128474	128172	128172	She	990	" I can not sleep . "
128475	128485	128411	128412	The lady	990	" Go , and talk to me another time . "
128486	128555	128556	128556	He	4085	" No , it must be now . You have helped me when I struggled to rise into a clearer world , and I think , humble as I am , I can help you now . I have had a thought this night that if you do not pray for him and bless him ... it will end miserably . My friend , have you done so ? "
128574	128582	128556	128556	He	4085	" Have you done so , Austin ? "
128583	128602	128411	128412	The lady	990	" This is assuredly a new way of committing fathers to the follies of their sons , Emmeline ! "
128603	128626	128627	128627	He	4085	" No , not that . But will you pray for your boy , and bless him , before the day comes ? "
128636	128690	128629	128629	himself	4085	" And I must do this , or it will end in misery ? How else can it end ? Can I save him from the seed he has sown ? Consider , Emmeline , what you say . He has repeated his cousin 's sin . You see the end of that . "
128691	128770	128411	128412	The lady	990	" Oh , so different ! This young person is not , is not of the class poor Austin Wentworth allied himself to . Indeed it is different . And he be just and admit his nobleness . I fancied you did . This young person has great beauty , she has the elements of good breeding , she indeed I think , had she been in another position , you would not have looked upon her unfavourably . "
128771	128781	128782	128783	The baronet	609	" She may be too good for my son ! "
128789	128803	128782	128783	The baronet	609	" No woman is too good for Richard , and you know it . "
128804	128808	128411	128412	The lady	990	" Pass her . "
128809	128875	128411	128412	The lady	990	" Yes , I will speak only of him . He met her by a fatal accident . We thought his love dead , and so did he till he saw her again . He met her , he thought we were plotting against him , he thought he should lose her for ever , and is the madness of an hour he did this .... "
128876	128885	128782	128783	The baronet	609	" My Emmeline pleads bravely for clandestine matches . "
128886	128918	128411	128412	The lady	990	" Ah ! do not trifle , my friend . Say : would you have had him act as young men in his position generally do to young women beneath them ? "
128933	128937	128938	128938	he	186	" You mean , "
128941	128962	128938	128938	he	186	" that fathers must fold their arms , and either submit to infamous marriages , or have these creatures ruined . "
128963	128970	128972	128973	the lady	990	" I do not mean that , "
128988	129068	129069	129070	Sir Austin	186	" I mean that he loved her . Is it not a madness at his age ? But what I chiefly mean is save him from the consequences . No , you shall not withdraw your hand . Think of his pride , his sensitiveness , his great wild nature wild when he is set wrong : think how intense it is , set upon love ; think , my friend , do not forget his love for you . "
129078	129210	129069	129070	Sir Austin	186	" That I should save him , or any one , from consequences , is asking more than the order of things will allow to you , Emmeline , and is not in the disposition of this world . I can not . Consequences are the natural offspring of acts . My child , you are talking sentiment , which is the distraction of our modern age in everything a phantasmal vapour distorting the image of the life we live . You ask me to give him a golden age in spite of himself . All that could be done , by keeping him in the paths of virtue and truth , I did . He is become a man , and as a man he must reap his own sowing . "
129280	129294	129295	129295	she	4088	" All I ask of you is to open your heart to him , "
129302	129324	129295	129295	she	4088	" Call him a man , he is , and must ever be the child of your education , my friend . "
129325	129357	129359	129359	she	4088	" You would console me , Emmeline , with the prospect that , if he ruins himself , he spares the world of young women . Yes , that is something ! "
129448	129457	129458	129458	she	4088	" Am I pardoned for coming to you ? "
129465	129475	129476	129476	he	4089	" Surely I can read my Emmeline 's intentions , "
129480	129506	129458	129458	she	4088	" Very poor ones . I feel my weakness . I can not utter half I have been thinking . Oh , if I could ! "
129507	129515	129579	129579	she	4096	" You speak very well , Emmeline . "
129516	129524	129579	129579	she	4096	" At least , I am pardoned ! "
129525	129529	129458	129458	she	4088	" Surely so . "
129530	129555	129556	129556	He	4089	" And before I leave you , dear friend , shall I be forgiven ? may I beg it ? will you bless him ? "
129561	129577	129556	129556	He	4089	" Pray for him , Austin ! pray for him ere the night is over . "
129626	129632	129633	129633	he	609	" It 's day already ! "
129816	129845	129786	129786	He	609	" God 's rarest blessing is , after all , a good woman ! My Emmeline bears her sleepless night well . She does not shame the day . "
129856	129864	129865	129865	she	489	" I could bear many , many ! "
129872	129888	129865	129865	she	489	" and you would see me look better and better , if ... if only ... "
130006	130016	130017	130017	Benson	202	" Oh , I 'm sure I beg pardon , "
130036	130052	130054	130055	Lady Blandish	489	" And I think I shall follow him , and try to get forty winks , "
130073	130084	130085	130085	he	609	" Get me my breakfast as soon as you can , "
130101	130113	130114	130114	he	609	" I am going to town early . And , Benson , "
130117	130165	130114	130114	he	609	" you will also go to town this afternoon , or to - morrow , if it suits you , and take your book with you to Mr. Thompson . You will not return here . A provision will be made for you . You can go . "
130689	130699	130682	130682	Richard	186	" No letter to - day , my Lucy ! "
130715	130742	130712	130712	he	186	" Never mind ! he 'll be coming down himself some morning . He has only to know her , and all 's well ! eh ? "
130772	130784	130786	130786	Lucy	132	" But one thing I do want to ask my darling , "
130798	130829	130786	130786	Lucy	132	" Take me on board his yacht with him to - day not leave me with those people ! Will he ? I 'm a good sailor , he knows ! "
130830	130835	130837	130837	Richard	186	" The best afloat ! "
130842	130921	130837	130837	Richard	186	" but , you know , you darling bit of a sailor , they do n't allow more than a certain number on board for the race , and if they hear you 've been with me , there 'll be cries of foul play ! Besides , there 's Lady Judith to talk to you about Austin , and Lord Mountfalcon 's compliments for you to listen to , and Mr. Morton to take care of you . "
130930	130943	130944	130944	she	3539	" I hope I do n't frown and blush as I did ? "
130969	130987	130988	130988	she	3539	" And we shall be separated for how many hours ? one , two , three hours ! "
130994	131009	130988	130988	she	3539	" And then I shall come on board to receive my bride 's congratulations . "
131010	131024	130957	130957	he	4134	" And then my husband will talk all the time to Lady Judith . "
131025	131040	130988	130988	she	3539	" And then I shall see my wife frowning and blushing at Lord Mountfalcon . "
131041	131049	130957	130957	he	4134	" Am I so foolish , Richard ? "
131705	131711	131713	131713	Richard	487	" It 's all right ! "
131747	131757	131728	131728	he	487	" Lucy ! this is Adrian , my cousin . "
131758	131765	131766	131766	his	346	" Is n't he an angel ? "
131778	131783	131773	131773	Lucy	132	" That he is ! "
131807	131815	131816	131816	he	4173	" I think we are not strangers , "
131855	131860	131862	131862	Richard	487	" Dear old Rady , "
131870	131891	131862	131862	Richard	487	" how glad I am you 've come ! I do n't mind telling you we 've been horridly wretched . "
131892	131902	131904	131904	Adrian	346	" Six , seven , eight , nine eggs , "
131916	132019	131904	131904	Adrian	346	" Why would n't he write ? Why did n't he answer one of my letters ? But here you are , so I do n't mind now . He wants to see us , does he ? We 'll go up to - night . I 've a match on at eleven ; my little yacht I 've called her the ' Blandish ' against Fred Cuirie 's ' Begum . ' I shall beat , but whether I do or not , we 'll go up to - night . What 's the news ? What are they all doing ? "
132020	132025	132026	132026	Adrian	346	" My dear boy ! "
132033	132122	132123	132123	Richard	487	" let me put myself a little more on an equal footing with you before I undertake to reply . Half that number of eggs will be sufficient for an unmarried man , and then we 'll talk . They 're all very well , as well as I can recollect after the shaking my total vacuity has had this morning . I came over by the first boat , and the sea , the sea has made me love mother earth , and desire of her fruits . "
132131	132154	132123	132123	Richard	487	" Adrian ! what did he say when he heard of it ? I want to know exactly what words he said . "
132155	132181	132123	132123	Richard	487	" Well says the sage , my son ! ' Speech is the small change of Silence . ' He said less than I do . "
132182	132190	132192	132192	Richard	487	" That 's how he took it ! "
132242	132248	132250	132250	Adrian	346	" Now we 'll commence , "
132303	132315	132316	132316	he	346	" This egg has boiled three minutes and three - quarters , "
132324	132329	132331	132331	Lucy	132	" Dear , dear ! "
132333	132356	132331	132331	Lucy	132	" I boiled them myself exactly that time . Richard likes them so . And you like them hard , Mr. Harley ? "
132357	132399	132296	132296	him	346	" On the contrary , I like them soft . Two minutes and a half , or three - quarters at the outside . An egg should never rashly verge upon hardness never . Three minutes is the excess of temerity . "
132400	132413	132414	132417	the lovely little hostess	4179	" If Richard had told me ! If I had only known ! "
132425	132438	132440	132440	Adrian	346	" We must n't expect him to pay attention to such matters , "
132446	132458	132460	132460	Richard	487	" Hang it ! there are more eggs in the house , "
132475	132500	132469	132469	Lucy	132	" Oh , yes ! I will go and boil some exactly the time you like . Pray let me go , Mr. Harley . "
132512	132515	132516	132516	he	346	" No , "
132519	132536	132516	132516	he	346	" I will be ruled by Richard 's tastes , and heaven grant me his digestion ! "
132645	132655	132657	132659	this brave girl	4181	" He shall not think me timid and stupid , "
132802	132823	132799	132799	Adrian	346	" I think now I 'm in case to answer your questions , my dear boy thanks to Mrs. Richard , "
132842	132845	132847	132847	Richard	489	" Ah ! "
132856	132931	132847	132847	Richard	489	" To begin , the Pilgrim has lost his Note - book , and has been persuaded to offer a reward which shall maintain the happy finder thereof in an asylum for life . Benson superlative Benson has turned his shoulders upon Raynham . None know whither he has departed . It is believed that the sole surviving member of the sect of the Shaddock - Dogmatists is under a total eclipse of Woman . "
132932	132936	132937	132937	Richard	489	" Benson gone ? "
132940	132952	132937	132937	Richard	489	" What a tremendous time it seems since I left Raynham ! "
132953	133163	132847	132847	Richard	489	" So it is , my dear boy . The honeymoon is Mahomet 's minute ; or say , the Persian King 's water - pail that you read of in the story : You dip your head in it , and when you draw it out , you discover that you have lived a life . To resume your uncle Algernon still roams in pursuit of the lost one I should say , hops . Your uncle Hippias has a new and most perplexing symptom ; a determination of bride - cake to the nose . Ever since your generous present to him , though he declares he never consumed a morsel of it , he has been under the distressing illusion that his nose is enormous , and I assure you he exhibits quite a maidenly timidity in following it through a doorway , for instance . He complains of its terrible weight . I have conceived that Benson invisible might be sitting on it . His hand , and the doctor 's , are in hourly consultation with it , but I fear it will not grow smaller . The Pilgrim has begotten upon it a new Aphorism : that Size is a matter of opinion . "
133164	133169	133171	133171	Richard	489	" Poor uncle Hippy ! "
133173	133205	133171	133171	Richard	489	" I wonder he does n't believe in magic . There 's nothing supernatural to rival the wonderful sensations he does believe in . Good God ! fancy coming to that ! "
133206	133215	133216	133216	Lucy	132	" I 'm sure I 'm very sorry , "
133219	133227	133216	133216	Lucy	132	" but I ca n't help laughing . "
133238	133360	133361	133361	Richard	489	" The Pilgrim has your notion , Richard . Whom does he not forestall ? ' Confirmed dyspepsia is the apparatus of illusions , ' and he accuses the Ages that put faith in sorcery , of universal indigestion , which may have been the case , owing to their infamous cookery . He says again , if you remember , that our own Age is travelling back to darkness and ignorance through dyspepsia . He lays the seat of wisdom in the centre of our system , Mrs. Richard : for which reason you will understand how sensible I am of the vast obligation I am under to you at the present moment , for your especial care of mine . "
133464	133475	133477	133477	Richard	489	" So that 's all about the home - people ? "
133479	133482	133484	133484	Adrian	346	" All ! "
133486	133504	133484	133484	Adrian	346	" Or stay : you know Clare 's going to be married ? Not ? Your Aunt Helen "
133505	133532	133457	133457	she	132	" Oh , bother my Aunt Helen ! What do you think she had the impertinence to write but never mind ! Is it to Ralph ? "
133533	133597	133484	133484	Adrian	346	" Your Aunt Helen , I was going to say , my dear boy , is an extraordinary woman . It was from her originally that the Pilgrim first learnt to call the female the practical animal . He studies us all , you know . The Pilgrim 's Scrip is the abstract portraiture of his surrounding relatives . Well , your Aunt Helen "
133598	133603	133605	133605	Richard	489	" Mrs. Doria Battledoria ! "
133607	133640	133605	133605	Richard	489	" being foiled in a little pet scheme of her own call it a System if you like of some ten or fifteen years ' standing , with regard to Miss Clare ! "
133641	133646	133484	133484	Adrian	346	" The fair Shuttlecockiana ! "
133647	133777	133484	133484	Adrian	346	" instead of fretting like a man , and questioning Providence , and turning herself and everybody else inside out , and seeing the world upside down , what does the practical animal do ? She wanted to marry her to somebody she could n't marry her to , so she resolved instantly to marry her to somebody she could marry her to : and as old gentlemen enter into these transactions with the practical animal the most readily , she fixed upon an old gentleman ; an unmarried old gentleman , a rich old gentleman , and now a captive old gentleman . The ceremony takes place in about a week from the present time . No doubt you will receive your invitation in a day or two . "
133778	133795	133797	133797	Richard	489	" And that cold , icy , wretched Clare has consented to marry an old man ! "
133799	133813	133797	133797	Richard	489	" I 'll put a stop to that when I go to town . "
133838	133843	133844	133844	he	4189	" I 'm off , "
133847	133893	133894	133894	he	4189	" Adrian , you 'll take her . She goes in the Empress , Mountfalcon 's vessel . He starts us . A little schooner - yacht such a beauty ! I 'll have one like her some day . Good - bye , darling ! "
133958	133964	133953	133953	He	346	" Go on the water ? "
133965	133980	133953	133953	He	346	" Yes . It 's only to St. Helen 's . Short and sharp . "
133981	133998	133953	133953	He	346	" Do you grudge me the nourishment my poor system has just received , my son ? "
133999	134025	133953	133953	He	346	" Oh , bother your system ! Put on your hat , and come along . I 'll put you on board in my boat . "
134026	134097	133953	133953	He	346	" Richard ! I have already paid the penalty of them who are condemned to come to an island . I will go with you to the edge of the sea , and I will meet you there when you return , and take up the Tale of the Tritons : but , though I forfeit the pleasure of Mrs. Richard 's company , I refuse to quit the land . "
134098	134106	134107	134107	Lucy	132	" Yes , oh , Mr. Harley ! "
134113	134145	134107	134107	Lucy	132	" and I will stay with you , if you please . I do n't want to go among those people , and we can see it all from the shore . "
134178	134279	134171	134171	I	0	" and she lengthened her plea in her attitude and look to melt the discontent she saw gathering . Adrian protested that she had much better go ; that he could amuse himself very well till their return , and so forth ; but she had schemes in her pretty head , and held to it to be allowed to stay in spite of Lord Mountfalcon 's disappointment , cited by Richard , and at the great risk of vexing her darling , as she saw . Richard pished , and glanced contemptuously at Adrian . He gave way ungraciously . "
134303	134348	134298	134298	I	0	" Who could be ? he seemed as he looked up from her modest fondling to ask Adrian , and seized the indemnity of a kiss on her forehead , which , however , did not immediately disperse the shade of annoyance he felt . "
134352	134356	134298	134298	I	0	" he exclaimed . "
134384	134611	134298	134298	I	0	" Adrian 's angelic quality had quite worn off to him . He never thought of devoting himself to make the most of the material there was : but somebody else did , and that fair somebody succeeded wonderfully in a few short hours . She induced Adrian to reflect that the baronet had only to see her , and the family muddle would be smoothed at once . He came to it by degrees ; still the gradations were rapid . Her manner he liked ; she was certainly a nice picture : best of all , she was sensible . He forgot the farmer 's niece in her , she was so very sensible . She appeared really to understand that it was a woman 's duty to know how to cook . But the difficulty was , by what means the baronet could be brought to consent to see her . He had not yet consented to see his son , and Adrian , spurred by Lady Blandish , had ventured something in coming down . He was not inclined to venture more . The small debate in his mind ended by his throwing the burden on time . Time would bring the matter about . Christians as well as Pagans are in the habit of phrasing this excuse for folding their arms ; "
134614	134621	134298	134298	I	0	" says The Pilgrim 's Scrip , "
134633	134731	134623	134626	the devil 's imps	4198	" As she loitered along the shore with her amusing companion , Lucy had many things to think of . There was her darling 's match . The yachts were started by pistol - shot by Lord Mountfalcon on board the Empress , and her little heart beat after Richard 's straining sails . Then there was the strangeness of walking with a relative of Richard 's , one who had lived by his side so long . And the thought that perhaps this night she would have to appear before the dreaded father of her husband . "
134736	134740	134732	134734	O Mr. Harley	149	" she said , "
134753	134757	134759	134759	he	4200	" she faltered , "
134763	134764	134759	134759	he	4200	" "
134778	134782	134770	134770	I	0	" said Adrian . "
134863	134892	134893	134895	O Mr. Harley	149	" ... Lucy threw up her blue eyes . A half - cowardly delight at the chance of a respite from the awful interview made her quickly apprehensive . "
134905	134906	134897	134897	you	0	" "
134945	134946	134926	134926	I	0	" "

134964	134965	134961	134961	you	0	" "
134977	135002	134969	134969	I	0	" murmured Lucy . The wise youth pressed her hand with lymphatic approbation . They walked on till the yachts had rounded the point . "
135012	135030	135009	135010	Mr. Harley	149	" she asked with some trouble in her voice now that her darling was out of sight . "
135048	135053	135040	135040	him	4200	" Adrian replied gallantly . "
135312	135469	135470	135470	Dearest	7058	" Adrian looked in her face , as much as to say : Now are you capable of this piece of heroism ? And it did seem hard to her that she should have to tell Richard she shrank from any trial . But the proposition chimed in with her fears and her wishes : she thought the wise youth very wise : the poor child was not insensible to his flattery , and the subtler flattery of making herself in some measure a sacrifice to the home she had disturbed . She agreed to simulate as Adrian had suggested . Victory is the commonest heritage of the hero , and when Richard came on shore proclaiming that the Blandish had beaten the Begum by seven minutes and three - quarters , he was hastily kissed and congratulated by his bride with her fingers among the leaves of Dr. Kitchener , and anxiously questioned about wine . "
135511	135512	135502	135502	I	0	" "
135522	135526	135502	135502	I	0	" said Richard . "
135546	135547	135542	135542	you	4228	" "
135563	135579	135552	135552	I	0	" And again she threw on him the cold water of that solicitude about wine . "
135629	135630	135622	135622	I	0	" "
135643	135644	135635	135635	you	4228	" "
135650	135651	135646	135646	me	0	" "
135673	135674	135663	135664	Lady Judith	485	" "
135684	135901	135682	135682	you	4228	" Richard put his hand to feel for the little heart : her eyelids softened , and she ran away . It is to say much of the dinner that Adrian found no fault with it , and was in perfect good - humour at the conclusion of the service . He did not abuse the wine they were able to procure for him , which was also much . The coffee , too , had the honour of passing without comment . These were sound first steps toward the conquest of an epicure , and as yet Cupid did not grumble . After coffee they strolled out to see the sun set from Lady Judith 's grounds . The wind had dropped . The clouds had rolled from the zenith , and ranged in amphitheatre with distant flushed bodies over sea and land : Titanic crimson head and chest rising from the wave faced Hyperion falling . There hung Briareus with deep - indented trunk and ravined brows , stretching all his hands up to unattainable blue summits . North - west the range had a rich white glow , as if shining to the moon , and westward , streams of amber , melting into upper rose , shot out from the dipping disk . "
135912	135938	135939	135939	He	4233	" said Richard under his breath to Adrian , who was serenely chanting Greek hexameters , and answered , in the swing of the caesura , "
135947	135990	135939	135939	He	4233	" Lady Judith , with a black lace veil tied over her head , met them in the walk . She was tall and dark ; dark - haired , dark - eyed , sweet and persuasive in her accent and manner . "
135998	136061	135939	135939	He	4233	" thinks Adrian . She welcomed him as one who had claims on her affability . She kissed Lucy protectingly , and remarking on the wonders of the evening , appropriated her husband . Adrian and Lucy found themselves walking behind them . The sun was under . All the spaces of the sky were alight , and Richard 's fancy flamed . "
136074	136079	135939	135939	He	4233	" said Lady Judith . "
136114	136115	136108	136108	you	4233	" "
136147	136148	136139	136139	you	4233	" "
136155	136156	136157	136157	You	4233	" "
136167	136168	136157	136157	You	4233	" "
136177	136178	136175	136175	Austin	485	" "
136187	136188	136182	136182	you	4233	" "
136217	136220	136221	136221	Adrian	346	" Sauces , "
136231	136254	136221	136221	Adrian	346	" Sauces are the top tree of this science . A woman who has mastered sauces sits on the apex of civilization . "
136268	136282	136283	136283	Richard	489	" How can men see such sights as those , and live idle ? "
136286	136305	136283	136283	Richard	489	" I feel ashamed of asking my men to work for me . Or I feel so now . "
136306	136335	136221	136221	Adrian	346	" Not when you 're racing the Begum , I think . There 's no necessity for you to turn democrat like Austin . Do you write now ? "
136336	136376	136283	136283	Richard	489	" No . What is writing like mine ? It does n't deceive me . I know it 's only the excuse I 'm making to myself for remaining idle . I have n't written a line since lately . "
136377	136384	136283	136283	Richard	489	" Because you are so happy . "
136385	136400	136401	136401	He	4235	" No , not because of that . Of course I 'm very happy ... "
136494	136506	136508	136508	Richard	489	" We 'll work together in town , at all events , "
136510	136528	136508	136508	Richard	489	" Why ca n't we go about together at night and find out people who want help ? "
136541	136569	136529	136530	Lady Judith	485	" I think we must n't be too romantic . You will become a knight - errant , I suppose . You have the characteristics of one . "
136570	136575	136576	136576	Adrian	346	" Especially at breakfast , "
136590	136597	136599	136600	Lady Judith	485	" You must be our champion , "
136602	136618	136599	136600	Lady Judith	485	" the rescuer and succourer of distressed dames and damsels . We want one badly . "
136619	136623	136625	136625	Richard	489	" You do , "
136629	136640	136625	136625	Richard	489	" from what I hear : from what I know ! "
136712	136722	136737	136737	he	4235	" My darling ! what have you been doing ? "
136744	136757	136737	136737	he	4235	" We have been engaged in a charming conversation on domestic cookery , "
136761	136770	136759	136759	Adrian	346	" Cookery ! such an evening as this ? "
136785	136795	136796	136796	Lucy	132	" Dearest ! you know it 's very useful , "
136800	136810	136812	136813	Lady Judith	485	" Indeed I quite agree with you , child , "
136815	136835	136812	136813	Lady Judith	485	" and I think you have the laugh of us . I certainly will learn to cook some day . "
136836	136846	136848	136848	Adrian	346	" Woman 's mission , in so many words , "
136850	136859	136848	136848	Adrian	346	" And pray , what is man 's ? "
136860	136869	136812	136813	Lady Judith	485	" To taste thereof , and pronounce thereupon . "
136870	136879	136881	136882	Lady Judith	485	" Let us give it up to them , "
136886	136903	136881	136882	Lady Judith	485	" You and I never will make so delightful and beautifully balanced a world of it . "
136994	137077	137078	137078	Lucy	132	" If we go together and make him see us both : if he sees he has nothing to be ashamed of in you rather everything to be proud of ; if you are only near him , you will not have to speak a word , and I 'm certain as certain as that I live that in a week we shall be settled happily at Raynham . I know my father so well , Lucy . Nobody knows him but I. "
137086	137109	137081	137082	Mr. Harley	149	" Adrian ? Not a bit . Adrian only knows a part of people , Lucy ; and not the best part . "
137124	137136	137110	137110	Lucy	132	" Is it he that has been frightening you , Lucy ? "
137137	137149	137150	137150	she	132	" No , no , Richard ; oh , dear no ! "
137166	137176	137178	137178	Richard	489	" He does n't know my father at all , "
137256	137263	137245	137245	he	746	" Why are you so harsh ? "
137282	137295	137297	137297	Richard	489	" Well , I tell you I wo n't go without you , "
137399	137415	137393	137395	the wise youth	746	" It 's a wholesome interlude to your extremely Cupidinous behaviour , my dear boy . "
137429	137435	137437	137437	Lucy	132	" All manner of things , "
137439	137493	137437	137437	Lucy	132	" not only cookery . He is so amusing , though he does make fun of The Pilgrim 's Scrip , and I think he ought not . And then , do you know , darling you wo n't think me vain ? I think he is beginning to like me a little . "
137504	137527	137494	137494	Richard	489	" Does n't everybody like you , admire you ? Does n't Lord Mountfalcon , and Mr. Morton , and Lady Judith ? "
137528	137539	137437	137437	Lucy	132	" But he is one of your family , Richard . "
137540	137553	137494	137494	Richard	489	" And they all will , if she is n't a coward . "
137554	137559	137560	137560	she	4257	" Ah , no ! "
137626	137642	137622	137623	Lady Judith	485	" I think she 's wrong , but you must learn to humour little women . "
137643	137654	137655	137655	he	1653	" Then would you advise me to go up alone ? "
137663	137691	137655	137655	he	1653	" What else can you do ? Be reconciled yourself as quickly as you can . You ca n't drag her like a captive , you know ? "
137728	137733	137734	137734	he	1653	" What I fear , "
137737	137834	137734	137734	he	1653	" is , that my father will make it smooth with me , and not acknowledge her : so that whenever I go to him , I shall have to leave her , and tit for tat an abominable existence , like a ball on a billiard - table . I wo n't bear that ignominy . And this I know , I know ! she might prevent it at once , if she would only be brave , and face it . You , you , Lady Judith , you would n't be a coward ? "
137835	137848	137849	137850	the lady	990	" Where my old lord tells me to go , I go , "
137854	137878	137849	137850	the lady	990	" There 's not much merit in that . Pray , do n't cite me . Women are born cowards , you know . "
137879	137890	137734	137734	he	1653	" But I love the women who are not cowards . "
137891	137903	137849	137850	the lady	990	" The little thing your wife has not refused to go ? "
137904	137914	137915	137915	Lucy	132	" No but tears ! Who can stand tears ? "
138028	138040	138023	138023	he	746	" A nice little woman ! a very nice little woman ! "
138166	138174	138162	138162	Lucy	132	" That 's worse than Lord Mountfalcon . "
138175	138188	138159	138159	his	346	" Better English than the noble lord deigns to employ allow that ? "
138192	138198	138200	138200	Lucy	132	" He is very kind , "
138202	138212	138214	138214	Adrian	346	" To all , save to our noble vernacular , "
138216	138228	138214	138214	Adrian	346	" He seems to scent a rival to his dignity there . "
138242	138253	138254	138254	he	346	" We are at our ease here in excellent society , "
138260	138421	138257	138258	Lady Blandish	489	" I am bound to confess that the Huron has a happy fortune , or a superlative instinct . Blindfold he has seized upon a suitable mate . She can look at a lord , and cook for an epicure . Besides Dr. Kitchener , she reads and comments on The Pilgrim 's Scrip . The ` Love ' chapter , of course , takes her fancy . That picture of Woman , ` Drawn by Reverence and coloured by Love , ' she thinks beautiful , and repeats it , tossing up pretty eyes . Also the lover 's petition : ' Give me purity to be worthy the good in her , and grant her patience to reach the good in me . ' ' Tis quite taking to hear her lisp it . Be sure that I am repeating the petition ! I make her read me her choice passages . She has not a bad voice . "
138625	138805	138614	138614	Austin	485	" I have for the first time in my career a field of lords to study . I think it is not without meaning that I am introduced to it by a yeoman 's niece . The language of the two social extremes is similar . I find it to consist in an instinctively lavish use of vowels and adjectives . My lord and Farmer Blaize speak the same tongue , only my lord 's has lost its backbone , and is limp , though fluent . Their pursuits are identical ; but that one has money , or , as the Pilgrim terms it , vantage , and the other has not . Their ideas seem to have a special relationship in the peculiarity of stopping where they have begun . Young Tom Blaize with vantage would be Lord Mountfalcon . Even in the character of their parasites I see a resemblance , though I am bound to confess that the Hon . Peter Brayder , who is my lord 's parasite , is by no means noxious . "
139034	139456	139023	139026	the bacon - fed	4299	" Mr. Morton who does me the honour to call me Young Mephisto , and Socrates missed leaves to - morrow to get Master Ralph out of a scrape . Our Richard has just been elected member of a Club for the promotion of nausea . Is he happy ? you ask . As much so as one who has had the misfortune to obtain what he wanted can be . Speed is his passion . He races from point to point . In emulation of Leander and Don Juan , he swam , I hear , to the opposite shores the other day , or some world - shaking feat of the sort : himself the Hero whom he went to meet : or , as they who pun say , his Hero was a Bet . A pretty little domestic episode occurred this morning . He finds her abstracted in the fire of his caresses : she turns shy and seeks solitude : green jealousy takes hold of him : he lies in wait , and discovers her with his new rival a veteran edition of the culinary Doctor ! Blind to the Doctor 's great national services , deaf to her wild music , he grasps the intruder , dismembers him , and performs upon him the treatment he has recommended for dressed cucumber . Tears and shrieks accompany the descent of the gastronome . Down she rushes to secure the cherished fragments : he follows : they find him , true to his character , alighted and straggling over a bed of blooming flowers . Yet ere a fairer flower can gather him , a heel black as Pluto stamps him into earth , flowers and all : happy burial ! Pathetic tribute to his merit is watering his grave , when by saunters my Lord Mountfalcon . ' What 's the mattah ? ' says his lordship , soothing his moustache . They break apart , and ' tis left to me to explain from the window . My lord looks shocked , Richard is angry with her for having to be ashamed of himself , Beauty dries her eyes , and after a pause of general foolishness , the business of life is resumed . I may add that the Doctor has just been dug up , and we are busy , in the enemy 's absence , renewing old Aeson with enchanted threads . By the way , a Papist priest has blest them . "
139514	139566	139509	139510	Lady Blandish	489	" His father thinks he has refused to come to him . By your utter silence on the subject , I fear that it must be so . Make him come . Bring him by force . Insist on his coming . Is he mad ? He must come at once . "
139597	139622	139569	139569	Adrian	346	" The point is that the half man declines to come without the whole man . The terrible question of sex is our obstruction . "
139753	139761	139750	139750	She	990	" Come instantly , and come alone . "
139772	139783	139784	139784	he	186	" My father is not the man I thought him ! "
139797	139811	139784	139784	he	186	" And you , too , are not the woman I thought you . "
140244	140254	140255	140255	she	138	" At least you will do that , Austin , "
140259	140272	140255	140255	she	138	" You will show your sense of that horrid woman 's conduct ? "
140369	140382	140383	140383	she	138	" You are weak , Austin ! weak , I tell you ! "
140477	140495	140497	140498	The Pilgrim	265	" What revolution and hubbub does not that little instrument , the needle , avert from us ! "
140605	140609	140612	140613	Mrs. Doria	138	" Old John ! "
140629	140778	140612	140613	Mrs. Doria	138	" He sat with her alone . He was a man multitudes of women would have married whom will they not ? and who would have married any presentable woman : but women do want asking , and John never had the word . The rape of such men is left to the practical animal . So John sat alone with his old flame . He had become resigned to her perpetual lamentation and living Suttee for his defunct rival . But , ha ! what meant those soft glances now addressed to him ? His tailor and his hairdresser gave youth to John , but they had not the art to bestow upon him distinction , and an undistinguished man what woman looks at ? John was an indistinguishable man . For that reason he was dry wood to a soft glance . And now she said : "
140856	141192	140846	140846	you	4349	" At first John Todhunter thought it would be very much like his marrying a baby . However , he listened to it , and that was enough for Mrs. Doria . She went down to John 's mother , and consulted with her on the propriety of the scheme of wedding her daughter to John in accordance with his proposition . Mrs. Todhunter 's jealousy of any disturbing force in the influence she held over her son Mrs. Doria knew to be one of the causes of John 's remaining constant to the impression she had afore - time produced on him . She spoke so kindly of John , and laid so much stress on the ingrained obedience and passive disposition of her daughter , that Mrs. Todhunter was led to admit she did think it almost time John should be seeking a mate , and that he all things considered would hardly find a fitter one . And this , John Todhunter old John no more heard to his amazement when , a day or two subsequently , he instanced the probable disapproval of his mother . The match was arranged . Mrs. Doria did the wooing . It consisted in telling Clare that she had come to years when marriage was desirable , and that she had fallen into habits of moping which might have the worse effect on her future life , as it had on her present health and appearance , and which a husband would cure . Richard was told by Mrs. Doria that Clare had instantaneously consented to accept Mr. John Todhunter as lord of her days , and with more than obedience with alacrity . At all events , when Richard spoke to Clare , the strange passive creature did not admit constraint on her inclinations . Mrs. Doria allowed Richard to speak to her . She laughed at his futile endeavours to undo her work , and the boyish sentiments he uttered on the subject . "
141199	141203	140846	140846	you	4349	" she said , "
141225	141299	141300	141300	Women	738	" Heroic efforts were not wanting to arrest the union . Richard made repeated journeys to Hounslow , where Ralph was quartered , and if Ralph could have been persuaded to carry off a young lady who did not love him , from the bridegroom her mother averred she did love , Mrs. Doria might have been defeated . But Ralph in his cavalry quarters was cooler than Ralph in the Bursley meadows . "
141306	141321	141304	141304	Dick	4365	" he remarked , running a finger right and left along his upper lip . "
141383	141427	141372	141372	She	4367	" The hero quitted him with some contempt , As Ralph Morton was a young man , and he had determined that John Todhunter was an old man , he sought another private interview with Clare , and getting her alone , said : "
141446	141452	141443	141444	Ralph Morton	262	" To which Clare replied , "
141462	141463	141460	141460	Richard	186	" "
141473	141474	141465	141465	you	186	" "
141482	141483	141465	141465	you	186	" "
141518	141526	141511	141511	you	147	" He flung about in a fury . "
141536	141544	141507	141508	good God	410	" he caught her two hands violently , "
141558	141575	141507	141508	good God	410	" She shrank a little at his vehemence , but neither blushed nor stammered : answering : "
141589	141590	141583	141583	mama	7913	" "
141669	141671	141667	141667	yourself	147	" ... "
141675	141679	141680	141680	you	505	" said Clare , "
141687	141688	141680	141680	you	505	" "
141699	141709	141680	141680	you	505	" he cried , brushing angrily at his face . "
141726	141733	141734	141734	girls	6498	" and he said it scornfully , "
141743	141750	141753	141753	mama	7913	" She grew a trifle paler . "
141765	141766	141755	141755	I	0	" "
141775	141797	141772	141772	your	147	" he exclaimed . She looked at him softly ; a look he interpreted for the meekness he detested in her . "
141806	141810	141800	141800	I	0	" he added . "
141858	141859	141847	141847	they	4381	" "
141868	141895	141861	141861	you	505	" said Clare , following the question with her soft eyes . It was the same voice that had so thrilled him on his marriage morn . "
141902	141916	141861	141861	you	505	" he cried in the kindest way he had ever used to her , "
141925	141941	141918	141918	you	147	" and now as he wept she wept , and came insensibly into his arms . "
141946	141961	141918	141918	you	147	" he repeated . She said nothing , but seemed to shudder , weeping . "
142012	142013	142014	142014	I	0	" "
142020	142038	142014	142014	I	0	" Clare murmured , without looking up from the nest her cheek had made on his bosom . "
142047	142051	142052	142052	I	0	" said Richard . "
142062	142167	142060	142060	Clare	147	" He bent his head to meet her mouth , and she threw her arms wildly round him , and kissed him convulsively , and clung to his lips , shutting her eyes , her face suffused with a burning red . Then he left her , unaware of the meaning of those passionate kisses . Argument with Mrs. Doria was like firing paper - pellets against a stone wall . To her indeed the young married hero spoke almost indecorously , and that which his delicacy withheld him from speaking to Clare . He could provoke nothing more responsive from the practical animal than "
142179	142180	142177	142177	Fiddlededee	444	" "
142183	142191	142177	142177	Fiddlededee	444	" Mrs. Doria said to her intimates , "
142246	142440	142238	142238	Austin	186	" Threats of prayer , however , that harp upon their sincerity , are not very well worth having . Mrs. Doria had embarked in a practical controversy , as it were , with her brother . Doubtless she did trust he would be able to bear his sorrows to come , but one who has uttered prophecy can barely help hoping to see it fulfilled : she had prophecied much grief to the baronet . Poor John Todhunter , who would rather have married the mother , and had none of your heroic notions about the sacred necessity for love in marriage , moved as one guiltless of offence , and deserving his happiness . Mrs. Doria shielded him from the hero . To see him smile at Clare 's obedient figure , and try not to look paternal , was touching . Meantime Clare 's marriage served one purpose . It completely occupied Richard 's mind , and prevented him from chafing at the vexation of not finding his father ready to meet him when he came to town . A letter had awaited Adrian at the hotel , which said , "
142461	142514	142454	142454	you	4387	" No more than that . Adrian had to extemporize , that the baronet had gone down to Wales on pressing business , and would be back in a week or so . For ulterior inventions and devices wherewith to keep the young gentleman in town , he applied to Mrs. Doria . "
142520	142525	142526	142526	I	0	" said Mrs. Doria , "
142531	142536	142526	142526	I	0	" And she did . "
142541	142548	142526	142526	I	0	" asks The Pilgrim 's Scrip , "
142560	142570	142571	142571	I	0	" Mrs. Doria would hear no good of Lucy . "
142574	142588	142571	142571	I	0	" she observed , as Adrian ventured a shrugging protest in her behalf , "
142617	142729	142730	142730	I	0	" By dwelling on the arts of women , she reconciled it to her conscience to do her best to divide the young husband from his wife till it pleased his father they should live their unhallowed union again . Without compunction , or a sense of incongruity , she abused her brother and assisted the fulfilment of his behests . So the puppets were marshalled by Mrs. Doria , happy , or sad , or indifferent . Quite against his set resolve and the tide of his feelings , Richard found himself standing behind Clare in the church the very edifice that had witnessed his own marriage , and heard , "
142740	142961	142737	142738	John Pemberton	508	" clearly pronounced . He stood with black brows dissecting the arts of the tailor and hairdresser on unconscious John . The back , and much of the middle , of Mr. Todhunter 's head was bald ; the back shone like an egg - shell , but across the middle the artist had drawn two long dabs of hair from the sides , and plastered them cunningly , so that all save wilful eyes would have acknowledged the head to be covered . The man 's only pretension was to a respectable juvenility . He had a good chest , stout limbs , a face inclined to be jolly . Mrs. Doria had no cause to be put out of countenance at all by the exterior of her son - in - law : nor was she . Her splendid hair and gratified smile made a light in the church . Playing puppets must be an immense pleasure to the practical animal . The Forey bridesmaids , five in number , and one Miss Doria , their cousin , stood as girls do stand at these sacrifices , whether happy , sad , or indifferent ; a smile on their lips and tears in attendance . Old Mrs. Todhunter , an exceedingly small ancient woman , was also there . "
142975	143096	142962	142962	I	0	" she said , and throughout the ceremony she was muttering audible encomiums on her John 's manly behaviour . The ring was affixed to Clare 's finger ; there was no ring lost in this common - sense marriage . The instant the clergyman bade him employ it , John drew the ring out , and dropped it on the finger of the cold passive hand in a businesslike way , as one who had studied the matter . Mrs. Doria glanced aside at Richard . Richard observed Clare spread out her fingers that the operation might be the more easily effected . He did duty in the vestry a few minutes , and then said to his aunt : "
143102	143103	143098	143098	I	0	" "
143115	143121	143122	143122	I	0	" He cut her short . "
143148	143149	143150	143150	Richard	186	" "
143152	143153	143150	143150	Richard	186	" "
143158	143170	143150	143150	Richard	186	" She had attained her object and she wisely gave way . "
143189	143198	143199	143199	He	186	" She turned to Adrian , and said : "
143233	143256	143224	143225	that woman	3830	" Richard bade Clare farewell . She put up her mouth to him humbly , but he kissed her on the forehead . "
143264	143327	143328	143328	Richard	186	" she said in a quavering whisper in his ear . Mr. Todhunter stood beaming and endangering the art of the hairdresser with his pocket - handkerchief . Now he positively was married , he thought he would rather have the daughter than the mother , which is a reverse of the order of human thankfulness at a gift of the Gods . "
143333	143338	143328	143328	Richard	186	" he said heartily , "
143342	143343	143328	143328	Richard	186	" "
143354	143403	143351	143351	I	0	" sedately replied the hero , to the consternation of those around . Nodding to the bridesmaids and bowing to the old lady , he passed out . Adrian , who had been behind him , deputed to watch for a possible unpleasantness , just hinted to John : "
143420	143421	143410	143410	he	186	" "
143428	143433	143434	143435	poor fellow	6284	" kindly said John , "
143437	143536	143434	143435	poor fellow	6284	" All the puppets then rolled off to the breakfast . Adrian hurried after Richard in an extremely discontented state of mind . Not to be at the breakfast and see the best of the fun , disgusted him . However , he remembered that he was a philosopher , and the strong disgust he felt was only expressed in concentrated cynicism on every earthly matter engendered by the conversation . They walked side by side into Kensington Gardens . The hero was mouthing away to himself , talking by fits . Presently he faced Adrian , crying : "
143594	143595	143585	143585	I	0	" "
143598	143602	143585	143585	I	0	" groaned Adrian . "
143632	143637	143625	143625	you	0	" The hero soliloquized : "
143647	143649	143638	143638	He	186	" ... "
143658	143662	143652	143652	he	186	" said Adrian , "
143696	143697	143677	143677	He	186	" "
143704	143708	143677	143677	He	186	" cried Richard , "
143724	143725	143710	143716	a man you ca n't call bad	4404	" "
143738	143739	143740	143740	He	186	" "
143751	143752	143740	143740	He	186	" "
143870	143960	143864	143865	the eccentric	4411	" The hero was impervious to the wise youth . He stared at him as if he were but a speck in the universe he visioned . It was provoking that Richard should be Adrian 's best subject for cynical pastime , in the extraordinary heterodoxies he started , and his worst in the way he took it ; and the wise youth , against his will , had to feel as conscious of the young man 's imaginative mental armour , as he was of his muscular physical . "
143967	143974	143864	143865	the eccentric	4411	" mused Richard , looking up . "
143997	144001	144028	144028	you	4414	" Adrian yawned . "
144010	144015	144028	144028	you	4414	" Richard continued abstractedly . "
144022	144026	144028	144028	you	4414	" said Adrian . "
144061	144070	144048	144048	she	492	" the hero broke out loudly and rapidly . "
144097	144098	144088	144088	she	492	" "
144103	144107	144088	144088	she	492	" mumbled Adrian . "
144114	144123	144136	144136	she	492	" Richard was earnest to hear her exonerated . "
144147	144148	144136	144136	she	492	" "
144160	144161	144157	144157	you	4414	" "
144182	144183	144184	144184	She	492	" "
144195	144208	144184	144184	She	492	" emphasized Richard . Adrian shook his head with a deplorable smile . "
144223	144227	144215	144215	Ricky	186	" Richard bellowed : "
144235	144236	144237	144237	She	492	" "
144247	144422	144237	144237	She	492	" This happy shaft did stick . With a furious exclamation Richard shot in front , Adrian following him ; and asking him merely to have his assumption verified , whether he did not think she might have shaved her head ? and , presuming her to have done so , whether , in candour , he did not think he would have waited at least till she looked less of a rank lunatic ? After a minute or so , the wise youth was but a fly buzzing about Richard 's head . Three weeks of separation from Lucy , and an excitement deceased , caused him to have soft yearnings for the dear lovely home - face . He told Adrian it was his intention to go down that night . Adrian immediately became serious . He was at a loss what to invent to detain him , beyond the stale fiction that his father was coming to - morrow . He rendered homage to the genius of woman in these straits . "
144426	144430	144237	144237	She	492	" he thought , "
144452	144857	144443	144443	she	1880	" At this juncture the voice of a cavalier in the Row hailed them , proving to be the Honourable Peter Brayder , Lord Mountfalcon 's parasite . He greeted them very cordially ; and Richard , remembering some fun they had in the Island , asked him to dine with them ; postponing his return till the next day . Lucy was his . It was even sweet to dally with the delight of seeing her . The Hon . Peter was one who did honour to the body he belonged to . Though not so tall as a west of London footman , he was as shapely ; and he had a power of making his voice insinuating , or arrogant , as it suited the exigencies of his profession . He had not a rap of money in the world ; yet he rode a horse , lived high , expended largely . The world said that the Hon . Peter was salaried by his Lordship , and that , in common with that of Parasite , he exercised the ancient companion profession . This the world said , and still smiled at the Hon . Peter ; for he was an engaging fellow , and where he went not Lord Mountfalcon would not go . They had a quiet little hotel dinner , ordered by Adrian , and made a square at the table , Ripton Thompson being the fourth . Richard sent down to his office to fetch him , and the two friends shook hands for the first time since the great deed had been executed . Deep was the Old Dog 's delight to hear the praises of his Beauty sounded by such aristocratic lips as the Hon . Peter Brayder 's . All through the dinner he was throwing out hints and small queries to get a fuller account of her ; and when the claret had circulated , he spoke a word or two himself , and heard the Hon . Peter eulogize his taste , and wish him a bride as beautiful ; at which Ripton blushed , and said , he had no hope of that , and the Hon . Peter assured him marriage did not break the mould . After the wine this gentleman took his cigar on the balcony , and found occasion to get some conversation with Adrian alone . "
144870	144875	144443	144443	she	1880	" he asked carelessly . "
144879	144913	144443	144443	she	1880	" said Adrian . But it struck him that Brayder might be of assistance in showing Richard a little of the ` society in every form ' required by his chief 's prescript . "
144917	144921	144443	144443	she	1880	" he continued , "
145029	145030	145021	145021	I	0	" "
145035	145039	145021	145021	I	0	" laughed Brayder . "
145068	145069	145064	145066	the old gentleman	8160	" "
145079	145100	145064	145066	the old gentleman	8160	" said Adrian . Brayder followed the curvings of the whiff of his cigar with his eyes , and ejaculated , "
145104	145105	145064	145066	the old gentleman	8160	" "
145113	145117	145118	145118	Mount	512	" Adrian inquired . "
145165	145166	145155	145155	He	4426	" "
145181	145185	145167	145167	He	4426	" remarked Adrian . "
145198	145202	145203	145203	He	4426	" said Brayder . "
145239	145265	145233	145234	that woman	3830	" The young man joined them , and checked the communication . Brayder winked to Adrian , and pitifully indicated the presence of an innocent . "
145273	145277	145266	145268	A married man	4442	" said Adrian . "
145288	145328	145282	145282	we	4443	" Brayder observed . He appeared to study the young man while they talked . Next morning Richard was surprised by a visit from his aunt . Mrs. Doria took a seat by his side and spoke as follows : "
146020	146303	145971	145971	I	0	" It was Mrs. Doria 's object to produce an impression , and avoid an argument . She therefore left him as soon as she had , as she supposed , made her mark on the young man . Richard was very silent during the speech , and save for an exclamation or so , had listened attentively . He pondered on what his aunt said . He loved Lady Blandish , and yet he did not wish to see her Lady Feverel . Mrs. Doria laid painful stress on the scandal , and though he did not give his mind to this , he thought of it . He thought of his mother . Where was she ? But most his thoughts recurred to his father , and something akin to jealousy slowly awakened his heart to him . He had given him up , and had not latterly felt extremely filial ; but he could not bear the idea of a division in the love of which he had ever been the idol and sole object . And such a man , too ! so good ! so generous ! If it was jealousy that roused the young man 's heart to his father , the better part of love was also revived in it . He thought of old days : of his father 's forbearance , his own wilfulness . He looked on himself , and what he had done , with the eyes of such a man . He determined to do all he could to regain his favour . Mrs. Doria learnt from Adrian in the evening that her nephew intended waiting in town another week . "
146308	146313	145971	145971	I	0	" smiled Mrs. Doria . "
146326	146327	146314	146314	He	4466	" "
146335	146339	146314	146314	He	4466	" said Adrian . "
146381	146383	146378	146378	he	4466	" ... "
146390	146452	146385	146385	you	0	" Mrs. Doria begged . When Richard saw her nest , he was informed that she had received a most satisfactory letter from Mrs. John Todhunter : quite a glowing account of John 's behaviour : but on Richard 's desiring to know the words Clare had written , Mrs. Doria objected to be explicit , and shot into worldly gossip . "
146457	146461	146453	146453	Clare	147	" said Richard . "
146469	146474	146464	146464	I	0	" his aunt remarked . "
146484	146485	146486	146486	I	0	" "
146495	146507	146486	146486	I	0	" said Richard . Mrs. Doria did not propose to show it .
146669	146676	146678	146678	Adrian	346	" I do n't know her , "
146680	146688	146678	146678	Adrian	346	" Probably a superior priestess of Paphos . "
146689	146698	146699	146699	Richard	489	" Now that 's my idea of Bellona , "
146702	146722	146699	146699	Richard	489	" Not the fury they paint , but a spirited , dauntless , eager - looking creature like that . "
146723	146726	146728	146730	the wise youth	746	" Bellona ? "
146732	146844	146728	146730	the wise youth	746	" I do n't think her hair was black . Red , was n't it ? I should n't compare her to Bellona ; though , no doubt , she 's as ready to spill blood . Look at her ! She does seem to scent carnage . I see your idea . No ; I should liken her to Diana emerged from the tutorship of Master Endymion , and at nice play among the gods . Depend upon it they tell us nothing of the matter Olympus shrouds the story but you may be certain that when she left the pretty shepherd she had greater vogue than Venus up aloft . "
146849	146856	146857	146857	he	495	" See Mrs. Mount go by ? "
146860	146868	146870	146870	Adrian	346	" Oh , that 's Mrs. Mount ! "
146872	146878	146870	146870	Adrian	346	" Who 's Mrs. Mount ? "
146882	146893	146879	146879	Richard	489	" A sister to Miss Random , my dear boy . "
146894	146900	146902	146905	the Hon . Peter	495	" Like to know her ? "
146911	146914	146907	146907	Richard	489	" No , "
146938	146951	146952	146952	he	2387	" I have remained here waiting to see you now five weeks , "
146955	147089	146952	146952	he	2387	" I have written to you three letters , and you do not reply to them . Let me tell you again how sincerely I desire and pray that you will come , or permit me to come to you and throw myself at your feet , and beg my forgiveness , and hers . She as earnestly implores it . Indeed , I am very wretched , sir . Believe me , there is nothing I would not do to regain your esteem and the love I fear I have unhappily forfeited . I will remain another week in the hope of hearing from you , or seeing you . I beg of you , sir , not to drive me mad . Whatever you ask of me I will consent to . "
147090	147097	147098	147099	the baronet	609	" Nothing he would not do ! "
147105	147147	147098	147099	the baronet	609	" There is nothing he would not do ! He will remain another week and give me that final chance ! And it is I who drive him mad ! Already he is beginning to cast his retribution on my shoulders . "
147257	147286	147288	147288	he	4481	" Let him learn to deny himself something . Let him live with his equals for a term . If he loves me he will read my wishes . "
147300	147338	147296	147297	The lady	990	" You speak of a term . Till when ? May I name one to him ? It is the dreadful uncertainty that reduces him to despair . That , and nothing else . Pray be explicit . "
147462	147468	147470	147471	Mrs. Doria	138	" For principle he has , "
147473	147547	147470	147471	Mrs. Doria	138	" he never acts without one . But what it is , I can not at present perceive . If he would write , and command the boy to await his return , all would be clear . He allows us to go and fetch him , and then leaves us all in a quandary . It must be some woman 's influence . That is the only way to account for it . "
147548	147551	147553	147553	Adrian	346	" Singular ! "
147555	147707	147553	147553	Adrian	346	" what pride women have in their sex ! Well , I have to tell you , my dear aunt , that the day after to - morrow I hand my charge over to your keeping . I ca n't hold him in an hour longer . I 've had to leash him with lies till my invention 's exhausted . I petition to have them put down to the chief 's account , but when the stream runs dry I can do no more . The last was , that I had heard from him desiring me to have the South - west bedroom ready for him on Tuesday proximate . ' So ! ' says my son , ' I 'll wait till then , ' and from the gigantic effort he exhibited in coming to it , I doubt any human power 's getting him to wait longer . "
147708	147717	147719	147720	Mrs. Doria	138	" We must , we must detain him , "
147722	147783	147719	147720	Mrs. Doria	138	" If we do not , I am convinced Austin will do something rash that he will for ever repent . He will marry that woman , Adrian . Mark my words . Now with any other young man ! ... But Richard 's education ! that ridiculous System ! ... Has he no distraction ? nothing to amuse him ? "
147784	147797	147798	147800	The wise youth	746	" Poor boy ! I suppose he wants his own particular playfellow . "
147808	147821	147798	147800	The wise youth	746	" I tell you , Adrian , he will marry that woman . "
147822	147836	147719	147720	Mrs. Doria	138	" My dear aunt ! Can a chaste man do aught more commendable ? "
147837	147857	147719	147720	Mrs. Doria	138	" Has the boy no object we can induce him to follow ? If he had but a profession ! "
147858	148072	148073	148074	Mrs. Doria	138	" What say you to the regeneration of the streets of London , and the profession of moral - scavenger , aunt ? I assure you I have served a month 's apprenticeship with him . We sally forth on the tenth hour of the night . A female passes . I hear him groan . ' Is she one of them , Adrian ? ' I am compelled to admit she is not the saint he deems it the portion of every creature wearing petticoats to be . Another groan ; an evident internal , ' It can not be and yet!' ... that we hear on the stage . Rollings of eyes : impious questionings of the Creator of the universe ; savage mutterings against brutal males ; and then we meet a second young person , and repeat the performance of which I am rather tired . It would be all very well , but he turns upon me , and lectures me because I do n't hire a house , and furnish it for all the women one meets to live in in purity . Now that 's too much to ask of a quiet man . Master Thompson has latterly relieved me , I 'm happy to say . "
148079	148091	148073	148074	Mrs. Doria	138	" Has Austin written to you since you were in town ? "
148092	148097	148099	148099	Adrian	346	" Not an Aphorism ! "
148101	148111	148112	148113	Mrs. Doria	138	" I must see Richard to - morrow morning , "
148215	148218	148219	148219	he	495	" Gentlemen , "
148231	148299	148219	148219	he	495	" I 've come to propose to you to join us in a little dinner - party at Richmond . Nobody 's in town , you know . London 's as dead as a stock - fish . Nothing but the scrapings to offer you . But the weather 's fine : I flatter myself you 'll find the company agreeable , What says my friend Feverel ? "
148306	148316	148318	148321	the Hon . Peter	495	" No , no : positively you must come , "
148323	148391	148318	148321	the Hon . Peter	495	" I 've had some trouble to get them together to relieve the dulness of your incarceration . Richmond 's within the rules of your prison . You can be back by night . Moonlight on the water lovely woman . We 've engaged a city - barge to pull us back . Eight oars I 'm not sure it is n't sixteen . Come the word ! "
148406	148417	148419	148419	Adrian	346	" You 're in for another rick , you two , "
148421	148447	148419	148419	Adrian	346	" Arrange that we go . You have n't seen the cockney 's Paradise . Abjure Blazes , and taste of peace , my son . "
148472	148489	148490	148490	Adrian	346	" Very well . Just as you like . We 'll take old Rip with us . "
148525	148547	148504	148504	he	495	" If you do n't get a match on to swim there with the tide eh , Feverel , my boy ? "
148902	148907	148878	148878	one	836	" Who 's this ? "
149032	149038	149019	149019	Adrian	346	" Whose dinner is it ? "
149049	149056	149046	149047	a cavalier	4402	" Mount 's , I suppose , "
149061	149072	149046	149047	a cavalier	4402	" Where is he ? Why do n't he come ? "
149073	149080	149041	149043	a mignonne beauty	4525	" An affaire , I fancy . "
149081	149094	149041	149043	a mignonne beauty	4525	" There he is again ! How shamefully he treats Mrs. Mount ! "
149095	149105	149041	149043	a mignonne beauty	4525	" She do n't seem to cry over it . "
149365	149381	149383	149384	Mrs. Mount	512	" Where have you been lately ? I have n't seen you in the park , "
149388	149391	149392	149392	he	186	" No , "
149395	149402	149392	149392	he	186	" I 've not been there . "
149483	149488	149490	149491	Mrs. Mount	512	" Do you bet ? "
149493	149498	149500	149500	Richard	186	" Only on myself , "
149502	149505	149507	149507	his	186	" Bravo ! "
149525	149537	149538	149538	she	512	" I 'm sure you 're a safe one to back , "
149555	149562	149564	149565	the dame	1159	" Do n't you adore champagne ? "
149572	149577	149579	149579	Ripton	158	" Oh , yes ! "
149587	149593	149579	149579	Ripton	158	" I always drink it . "
149594	149599	149601	149603	the enraptured bosom	4544	" Do you indeed ? "
149608	149637	149601	149603	the enraptured bosom	4544	" You would be a friend , now ! I hope you do n't object to a lady joining you now and then . Champagne 's my folly . "
149927	149930	149932	149932	she	514	" Oh ! "
149934	149943	149944	149944	She	514	" that 's your tutor , is it ! "
149965	149970	149972	149973	the bosom	4562	" Look at that , "
149994	150006	150007	150008	the bosom	4562	" Now that 's what I do n't like in company , "
150016	150030	150031	150031	Ripton	158	" She always will allow it with everybody . Give her a nudge . "
150043	150047	150040	150040	she	514	" Then I will "
150091	150101	150085	150085	She	4531	" Are n't you satisfied with the old girl ? "
150102	150105	150107	150108	the bosom	4562	" Impudence ! "
150115	150137	150139	150140	the mignonne	4531	" Do , do fill her glass , and keep her quiet she drinks port when there 's no more champagne , "
150316	150324	150326	150327	the ladies	3205	" Oh , what a lovely night ! "
150332	150335	150337	150338	the gentlemen	3950	" Charming , "
150364	150371	150373	150373	Adrian	346	" We are split into couples , "
150386	150425	150375	150375	Richard	186	" Tis the influence of the moon ! Apparently we are in Cyprus . How has my son enjoyed himself ? How likes he the society of Aspasia ? I feel like a wise Greek to - night . "
150455	150471	150447	150447	He	158	" By Jove , Ricky ! do you know what sort of women these are ? "
150481	150484	150486	150486	Adrian	346	" Puritan ! "
150494	150527	150486	150486	Adrian	346	" Why did n't you get tipsy , sir ? Do n't you ever intoxicate yourself except at lawful marriages ? Reveal to us what you have done with the portly dame ? "
150568	150574	150560	150561	Murmuring couples	4587	" By Jove , Ricky ! "
150584	150591	150575	150575	Ripton	158	" there 's a woman smoking ! "
150592	150600	150602	150602	Adrian	346	" And why not , O Riptonus ? "
150604	150627	150602	150602	Adrian	346	" Art unaware that woman cosmopolitan is woman consummate ? and dost grumble to pay the small price for the splendid gem ? "
150628	150639	150641	150642	plain Ripton	158	" Well , I do n't like women to smoke , "
150644	150654	150655	150656	the hero	3139	" Why may n't they do what men do ? "
150660	150733	150655	150656	the hero	3139	" I hate that contemptible narrow - mindedness . It 's that makes the ruin and horrors I see . Why may n't they do what men do ? I like the women who are brave enough not to be hypocrites . By heaven ! if these women are bad , I like them better than a set of hypocritical creatures who are all show , and deceive you in the end . "
150734	150737	150739	150739	Adrian	346	" Bravo ! "
150741	150747	150739	150739	Adrian	346	" There speaks the regenerator . "
150800	150831	150793	150794	The Pilgrim	6034	" Young men take joy in nothing so much as the thinking women Angels : and nothing sours men of experience more than knowing that all are not quite so . "
150936	150942	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" What does he want ? "
150949	150989	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" It 's another of his villanies , I know . Upon my honour , Brayder , when I think of what I have to reproach him for , I think I must go mad , or kill him . "
150990	150993	150995	150998	the Hon . Peter	495	" Tragic ! "
151000	151045	150995	150998	the Hon . Peter	495	" Have n't you revenged yourself , Bella , pretty often ? Best deal openly . This is a commercial transaction . You ask for money , and you are to have it on the conditions : double the sum , and debts paid . "
151046	151052	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" He applies to me ! "
151053	151103	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" You know , my dear Bella , it has long been all up between you . I think Mount has behaved very well , considering all he knows . He 's not easily hoodwinked , you know . He resigns himself to his fate and follows other game . "
151104	151119	150995	150998	the Hon . Peter	495	" Then the condition is , that I am to seduce this young man ? "
151120	151149	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" My dear Bella ! you strike your bird like a hawk . I did n't say seduce . Hold him in play with him . Amuse him . "
151150	151159	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" I do n't understand half - measures . "
151160	151165	150995	150998	the Hon . Peter	495	" Women seldom do . "
151166	151174	150944	150945	a woman	1754	" How I hate you , Brayder ! "
151175	151181	151182	151183	The two	947	" I thank your ladyship . "
151513	151520	151495	151495	He	186	" Which is the more perilous ? "
151529	151542	151526	151527	the Pilgrim	6034	" To meet the temptings of Eve , or to pique her ? "
151854	151859	151860	151860	she	4629	" Are you cold ? "
151867	151871	151873	151874	the mignonne	4531	" I am , "
151883	151890	151891	151893	the fat one	4631	" You always appear to be , "
151898	151908	151910	151913	the naughty little woman	4632	" Wo n't you warm two , Mrs. Mortimer ? "
151943	151952	151936	151937	The mignonne	4531	" That poor fellow will certainly be stewed . "
152000	152003	151989	151989	She	4629	" Hush ! "
152074	152085	152087	152088	Mrs. Mount	512	" My brougham 's here ; I shall go alone , "
152090	152097	152098	152098	She	512	" Some one arrange my shawl . "
152124	152131	152132	152132	she	512	" Which way are you going ? "
152148	152157	152132	152132	she	512	" Then I can give you a lift , "
152207	152214	152216	152220	the bright - eyed mignonne	4649	" Oh , you happy fellow ! "
152242	152251	152253	152255	the persecuting creature	4651	" Try and let him come in too ? "
152260	152272	152274	152276	the angry bosom	4652	" Take liberties with pour men you sha n't with me , "
152282	152300	152302	152305	the pert little thing	4653	" So she 's been and gone and run away and left him after all his trouble ! "
152313	152341	152342	152342	She	4653	" Now you 'll never be so foolish as to pin your faith to fat women again . There ! he shall be made happy another time . "
152432	152495	152427	152428	the mignonne	524	" Blue eyes just what I like ! And such a little impudent nose , and red lips , pouting the very thing I like ! And her hair ? darkish , I think say brown . And so saucy , and light on her feet . And kind she is , or she would n't have talked to me like that . "
152624	152630	152632	152632	Ripton	158	" But he 's married , "
152634	152648	152632	152632	Ripton	158	" and he must n't go near these people if he 's married . "
152814	152818	152820	152820	Richard	186	" Old Rip ! "
152824	152839	152840	152840	Ripton	158	" What on earth are you doing here at this hour of the morning ? "
152849	152861	152840	152840	Ripton	158	" I wanted to shake your hand before I went home . "
152872	152923	152862	152862	Richard	186	" That all ? You may shake my hand any day , like a true man as you are , old Rip ! I 've been speaking about you . Do you know , that Mrs. Mount never saw you all the time at Richmond , or in the boat ! "
152924	152927	152928	152928	Ripton	158	" Oh ! "
152938	152945	152862	152862	Richard	186	" you saw her safe home ? "
152946	152985	152862	152862	Richard	186	" Yes . I 've been there for the last couple of hours talking . She talks capitally : she 's wonderfully clever . She 's very like a man , only much nicer . I like her . "
152986	153031	153032	153032	Ripton	158	" But , Richard , excuse me I 'm sure I do n't mean to offend you but now you 're married ... perhaps you could n't help seeing her home , but I think you really indeed ought n't to have gone upstairs . "
153041	153047	153049	153049	Richard	186	" What do you mean ? "
153051	153068	153069	153069	He	186	" You do n't suppose I care for any woman but my little darling down there . "
153072	153131	153069	153069	He	186	" No ; of course not . That 's absurd . What I mean is , that people perhaps will you know , they do they say all manner of things , and that makes unhappiness ; and I do wish you were going home to - morrow , Ricky . I mean , to your dear wife . "
153150	153209	153141	153142	The hero	3139	" So you 're anxious about my reputation . I hate that way of looking on women . Because they have been once misled look how much weaker they are ! because the world has given them an ill fame , you would treat them as contagious and keep away from them for the sake of your character ! "
153217	153221	153215	153215	me	0	" quoth Ripton . "
153224	153229	153215	153215	me	0	" asked the hero . "
153237	153248	153249	153249	I	0	" was all the logical explanation Ripton was capable of . "
153258	153262	153249	153249	I	0	" he added . "
153265	153269	153271	153271	I	0	" said Richard , "
153330	153380	153381	153381	We	4680	" Then he read Ripton a lecture on erring women , speaking of them as if he had known them and studied them for years . Clever , beautiful , but betrayed by love , it was the first duty of all true men to cherish and redeem them . "
153393	153414	153387	153387	Rip	188	" And the world suffered for it . That that was the root of all the evil in the world ! "
153481	153855	153876	153877	the Pilgrim	6034	" Forgetting to contest the premiss , that all betrayed women are betrayed by love , Ripton was quite silenced . He , like most young men , had pondered somewhat on this matter , and was inclined to be sentimental when he was not hungry . They walked in the moonlight by the railings of the park . Richard harangued at leisure , while Ripton 's teeth chattered . Chivalry might be dead , but still there was something to do , went the strain . The lady of the day had not been thrown in the hero 's path without an object , he said ; and he was sadly right there . He did not express the thing clearly ; nevertheless Ripton understood him to mean , he intended to rescue that lady from further transgressions , and show a certain scorn of the world . That lady , and then other ladies unknown , were to be rescued . Ripton was to help . He and Ripton were to be the knights of this enterprise . When appealed to , Ripton acquiesced , and shivered . Not only were they to be knights , they would have to be Titans , for the powers of the world , the spurious ruling Social Gods , would have to be defied and overthrown . And Titan number one flung up his handsome bold face as if to challenge base Jove on the spot ; and Titan number two strained the upper button of his coat to meet across his pocket - handkerchief on his chest , and warmed his fingers under his coat - tails . The moon had fallen from her high seat and was in the mists of the West , when he was allowed to seek his blankets , and the cold acting on his friend 's eloquence made Ripton 's flesh very contrite . The poor fellow had thinner blood than the hero ; but his heart was good . By the time he had got a little warmth about him , his heart gratefully strove to encourage him in the conception of becoming a knight and a Titan ; and so striving Ripton fell asleep and dreamed .
153871	153874	153876	153877	the Pilgrim	6034	" Alas ! "
153886	153989	153876	153877	the Pilgrim	6034	" I can not get that legend of the Serpent from me , the more I think . Has he not caught you , and ranked you foremost in his legions ? For see : till you were fashioned , the fruits hung immobile on the boughs . They swayed before us , glistening and cold . The hand must be eager that plucked them . They did not come down to us , and smile , and speak our language , and read our thoughts , and know when to fly , when to follow ! how surely to have us ! "
154198	154267	154268	154268	He	0	" This alliterative production was written without any sense of the peril that makes prophecy . It suited Sir Austin to write thus . It was a channel to his acrimony moderated through his philosophy . The letter was a reply to a vehement entreaty from Lady Blandish for him to come up to Richard and forgive him thoroughly : Richard 's name was not mentioned in it . "
154277	154394	154268	154268	He	0	" thought the lady : and she began insensibly to conceive him less than he was . The baronet was conscious of a certain false gratification in his son 's apparent obedience to his wishes and complete submission ; a gratification he chose to accept as his due , without dissecting or accounting for it . The intelligence reiterating that Richard waited , and still waited ; Richard 's letters , and more his dumb abiding and practical penitence ; vindicated humanity sufficiently to stop the course of virulent aphorisms . He could speak , we have seen , in sorrow for this frail nature of ours , that he had once stood forth to champion . "
154402	154954	154956	154956	he	4701	" he demanded , with the air of Hippias . He did not reflect how long it had lasted . Indeed , his indigestion of wrath had made of him a moral Dyspepsy . It was not mere obedience that held Richard from the aims of his young wife : nor was it this new knightly enterprise he had presumed to undertake . Hero as he was , a youth , open to the insane promptings of hot blood , he was not a fool . There had been talk between him and Mrs. Doria of his mother . Now that he had broken from his father , his heart spoke for her . She lived , he knew : he knew no more . Words painfully hovering along the borders of plain speech had been communicated to him , filling him with moody imaginings . If he thought of her , the red was on his face , though he could not have said why . But now , after canvassing the conduct of his father , and throwing him aside as a terrible riddle , he asked Mrs. Doria to tell him of his other parent . As softly as she could she told the story . To her the shame was past : she could weep for the poor lady . Richard dropped no tears . Disgrace of this kind is always present to a son , and , educated as he had been , these tidings were a vivid fire in his brain . He resolved to hunt her out , and take her from the man . Here was work set to his hand . All her dear husband did was right to Lucy . She encouraged him to stay for that purpose , thinking it also served another . There was Tom Bakewell to watch over Lucy : there was work for him to do . Whether it would please his father he did not stop to consider . As to the justice of the act , let us say nothing . On Ripton devolved the humbler task of grubbing for Sandoe 's place of residence ; and as he was unacquainted with the name by which the poet now went in private , his endeavours were not immediately successful . The friends met in the evening at Lady Blandish 's town - house , or at the Foreys ' , where Mrs. Doria procured the reverer of the Royal Martyr , and staunch conservative , a favourable reception . Pity , deep pity for Richard 's conduct Ripton saw breathing out of Mrs. Doria . Algernon Feverel treated his nephew with a sort of rough commiseration , as a young fellow who had run off the road . Pity was in Lady Blandish 's eyes , though for a different cause . She doubted if she did well in seconding his father 's unwise scheme supposing him to have a scheme . She saw the young husband encompassed by dangers at a critical time . Not a word of Mrs. Mount had been breathed to her , but the lady had some knowledge of life . She touched on delicate verges to the baronet in her letters , and he understood her well enough . "
154995	155099	154974	154974	you	4703	" So he responded , remote among the mountains . She tried very hard to speak plainly . Finally he came to say that he denied himself the pleasure of seeing his son specially , that he for a time might be put to the test the lady seemed to dread . This was almost too much for Lady Blandish . Love 's charity boy so loftily serene now that she saw him half denuded a thing of shanks and wrists was a trial for her true heart . Going home at night Richard would laugh at the faces made about his marriage . "
155125	155158	155114	155114	I	0	" He slightly adverted to a natural want of courage in women , which Ripton took to indicate that his Beauty was deficient in that quality . Up leapt the Old Dog ; "
155215	155220	155206	155206	She	4707	" And Richard rejoined : "
155262	155285	155250	155250	I	0	" Ripton only wondered the husband of such a treasure could remain apart from it . So thought Richard for a space . "
155293	155298	155291	155291	Rip	188	" he said despondently , "
155329	155330	155317	155317	She	1400	" "
155333	155340	155317	155317	She	1400	" Ripton assented , and the words "
155349	155426	155346	155347	Mr. Thompson	158	" fluttered about the Old Dog 's heart . It came to pass that Mrs. Berry , having certain business that led her through Kensington Gardens , spied a figure that she had once dandled in long clothes , and helped make a man of , if ever woman did . He was walking under the trees beside a lady , talking to her , not indifferently . The gentleman was her bridegroom and her babe . "
155432	155636	155427	155427	I	0	" said Mrs. Berry , as if she had branded a mark on it in infancy . But the lady was not her bride . Mrs. Berry diverged from the path , and got before them on the left flank ; she stared , retreated , and came round upon the right . There was that in the lady 's face which Mrs. Berry did not like . Her innermost question was , why he was not walking with his own wife ? She stopped in front of them . They broke , and passed about her . The lady made a laughing remark to him , whereat he turned to look , and Mrs. Berry bobbed . She had to bob a second time , and then he remembered the worthy creature , and hailed her Penelope , shaking her hand so that he put her in countenance again . Mrs. Berry was extremely agitated . He dismissed her , promising to call upon her in the evening . She heard the lady slip out something from a side of her lip , and they both laughed as she toddled off to a sheltering tree to wipe a corner of each eye . "
155647	155656	155644	155645	that woman	3830	" she said , and repeated it resolutely . "
155670	155676	155660	155660	he	4711	" was her neat inquiry . "
155682	155741	155679	155679	his	4711	" succeeded it . After many interrogations of the sort , she arrived at naming the lady a bold - faced thing ; adding subsequently , brazen . The lady had apparently shown Mrs. Berry that she wished to get rid of her , and had checked the outpouring of her emotions on the breast of her babe . "
155751	155756	155742	155742	I	0	" said Mrs. Berry . "
155785	155803	155804	155804	She	673	" Then , if not a lady , what was she ? Mrs. Berry desired to know : "
155815	155819	155820	155820	I	0	" Berry vowed . "
155828	155854	155822	155822	she	673	" Establishing the lady to be a spurious article , however , what was one to think of a married man in company with such ? "
155863	155873	155822	155822	she	673	" Mrs. Berry returned immediately on the charitable tack . "
155906	155929	155904	155904	Berry	489	" the relinquished spouse of Berry ejaculated , in horror at the idea of a second man being so monstrous in wickedness . "
155935	155947	155904	155904	Berry	489	" Mrs. Berry groaned on the suspicious side of the debate . "
155982	156031	155976	155976	men	761	" she whimpered . Women are swift at coming to conclusions in these matters ; soft women exceedingly swift : and soft women who have been betrayed are rapid beyond measure . Mrs. Berry had not cogitated long ere she pronounced distinctly and without a shadow of dubiosity : "
156057	156128	156053	156055	a Bella Donna	521	" as which poisonous plant she forthwith registered the lady in the botanical note - book of her brain . It would have astonished Mrs. Mount to have heard her person so accurately hit off at a glance . In the evening Richard made good his promise , accompanied by Ripton . Mrs. Berry opened the door to them . She could not wait to get him into the parlour . "
156157	156247	156248	156248	I	0	" she cried , falling into his arms , while Richard did his best to support the unexpected burden . Then reproaching him tenderly for his guile at mention of which Ripton chuckled , deeming it his own most honourable portion of the plot Mrs. Berry led them into the parlour , and revealed to Richard who she was , and how she had tossed him , and hugged him , and kissed him all over , when he was only that big showing him her stumpy fat arm . "
156259	156264	156256	156256	I	0	" said Mrs. Berry , "
156290	156352	156287	156288	my dear	6235	" Richard assured her he was not a bit ashamed , but warned her that she must not do it now , Mrs. Berry admitting it was out of the question now , and now that he had a wife , moreover . The young men laughed , and Ripton laughing over - loudly drew on himself Mrs. Berry 's attention : "
156450	156464	156448	156448	Berry	489	" Richard hurriedly explained that Lucy was still in the Isle of Wight . "
156478	156483	156468	156468	you	186	" said Mrs. Berry . "
156497	156501	156487	156487	I	0	" cried Richard . "
156511	156527	156487	156487	I	0	" asked Mrs. Berry , her heart beginning to beat at his manner of speaking . "
156534	156538	156487	156487	I	0	" said Richard . "
156561	156576	156550	156550	you	186	" Mrs. Berry exclaimed . Ripton interposed to tell her such fears were unfounded . "
156586	156597	156550	156550	you	186	" In a guilty voice Ripton stammered ' since September . "
156598	156601	156603	156604	Mrs. Berry	489	" September ! "
156611	156651	156603	156604	Mrs. Berry	489	" September , October , Nov two months and more ! nigh three ! A young married husband away from the wife of his bosom nigh three months ! Oh my ! Oh my ! what do that mean ? "
156652	156665	156667	156667	Richard	489	" My father sent for me I 'm waiting to see him , "
156702	156911	156684	156685	Mrs. Berry	489	" My dear young gentleman ! I 'd like to call ye my darlin ' babe ! I 'm going to speak as a mother to ye , whether ye likes it or no ; and what old Berry says , you wo n't mind , for she 's had ye when there was no conventionals about ye , and she has the feelin 's of a mother to you , though humble her state . If there 's one that know matrimony it 's me , my dear , though Berry did give me no more but nine months of it and I 've known the worst of matrimony , which , if you wants to be woeful wise , there it is for ye . For what have been my gain ? That man gave me nothin' but his name ; and Bessy Andrews was as good as Bessy Berry , though both is ' Bs , ' and says he , you was ' A , ' and now you 's ' B , ' so you 're my A B , he says , write yourself down that , he says , the bad man , with his jokes ! Berry went to service . "
156920	157278	156912	156913	Mrs. Berry	489	" So I tell ye , Berry went to service . He left the wife of his bosom forlorn and he went to service ; because he were allays an ambitious man , and was n't , so to speak , happy out of his uniform which was his livery not even in my arms : and he let me know it . He got among them kitchen sluts , which was my mournin ' ready made , and worse than a widow 's cap to me , which is no shame to wear , and some say becoming . There 's no man as ever lived known better than my Berry how to show his legs to advantage , and gals look at 'em . I do n't wonder now that Berry was prostrated . His temptations was strong , and his flesh was weak . Then what I say is , that for a young married man be he whomsoever he may be to be separated from the wife of his bosom a young sweet thing , and he an innocent young gentleman ! so to sunder , in their state , and be kep ' from each other , I say it 's as bad as bad can be ! For what is matrimony , my dears ? We 're told it 's a holy Ordnance . And why are ye so comfortable in matrimony ? For that ye are not a sinnin ' ! And they that severs ye they tempts ye to stray : and you learn too late the meanin ' o ' them blessin 's of the priest as it was ordained . Separate what comes ? Fust it 's like the circulation of your blood a - stoppin ' all goes wrong . Then there 's misunderstandings ye've both lost the key . Then , behold ye , there 's birds o ' prey hoverin ' over each on ye , and it 's which'll be snapped up fust . Then Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! it be like the devil come into the world again . "
157287	157369	157279	157280	Mrs. Berry	489	" A day I 'll give ye : I 'll go so far as a week : but there 's the outside . Three months dwellin ' apart ! That 's not matrimony , it 's divorcin ' ! what can it be to her but widowhood ? widowhood with no cap to show for it ! And what can it be to you , my dear ? Think ! you been a bachelor three months ! and a bachelor man , "
157378	157438	157373	157373	her	489	" he ai n't widow woman . I do n't go to compare you to Berry , my dear young gentleman . Some men 's hearts is vagabonds born they must go astray it 's their natur ' to . But all men are men , and I know the foundation of 'em , by reason of my woe . "
157514	157523	157509	157510	Mrs. Berry	489	" We all know what checked prespiration is . "
157543	157547	157549	157550	Mrs. Berry	489	" Laugh away , "
157552	157783	157549	157550	Mrs. Berry	489	" I do n't mind ye . I say again , we all do know what checked prespiration is . It fly to the lungs , it gives ye mortal inflammation , and it carries ye off . Then I say checked matrimony is as bad . It fly to the heart , and it carries off the virtue that 's in ye , and you might as well be dead ! Them that is joined it 's their salvation not to separate ! It do n't so much matter before it . That Mr. Thompson there if he go astray , it ai n't from the blessed fold . He hurt himself alone not double , and belike treble , for who can say now what may be ? There 's time for it . I 'm for holding back young people so that they knows their minds , howsomever they rattles about their hearts . I ai n't a speeder of matrimony , and good 's my reason ! but where it 's been done where they 're lawfully joined , and their bodies made one , I do say this , that to put division between 'em then , it 's to make wanderin ' comets of 'em creatures without a objeck , and no soul can say what they 's good for but to rush about ! "
157804	157810	157811	157811	Richard	489	" My dear old girl , "
157824	157861	157811	157811	Richard	489	" you 're a very wise old woman . But you must n't speak to me as if I wanted to stop here . I 'm compelled to . I do it for her good chiefly . "
157862	157875	157549	157550	Mrs. Berry	489	" It 's your father that 's doin' it , my dear ? "
157876	157885	157549	157550	Mrs. Berry	489	" Well , I 'm waiting his pleasure . "
157886	157914	157811	157811	Richard	489	" A pretty pleasure ! puttin ' a snake in the nest of young turtle - doves ! And why do n't she come up to you ? "
157915	157955	157549	157550	Mrs. Berry	489	" Well , that you must ask her . The fact is , she 's a little timid girl she wants me to see him first , and when I 've made all right , then she 'll come . "
157956	157962	157964	157965	Mrs. Berry	489	" A little timid girl ! "
157967	157991	157992	157992	she	489	" Oh , lor ' , how she must ha ' deceived ye to make ye think that ! Look at that ring , "
157998	158117	157992	157992	she	489	" he 's a stranger : he 's not my lawful ! You know what ye did to me , my dear . Could I get my own wedding - ring back from her ? ' No ! ' says she , firm as a rock , ' he said , with this ring I thee we d ' I think I see her now , with her pretty eyes and lovesome locks a darlin ' ! And that ring she 'd keep to , come life , came death . And she must ha ' been a rock for me to give in to her in that . For what 's the consequence ? Here am I , "
158129	158217	158118	158119	Mrs. Berry	489	" here am I in a strange ring , that 's like a strange man holdin ' of me , and me a - wearin ' of it just to seem decent , and feelin ' all over no better than a b a big that nasty came I ca n't abide ! I tell you , my dear , she ai n't soft , no ! except to the man of her heart ; and the best of women 's too soft there mores our sorrow ! "
158218	158223	158225	158225	Richard	489	" Well , well ! "
158232	158241	158225	158225	Richard	489	" I agree with you , Mrs. Berry , "
158246	158265	158242	158242	Ripton	158	" Mrs. Richard would do anything in the world her husband asked her , I 'm quite sure . "
158266	158317	158118	158119	Mrs. Berry	489	" Bless you for your good opinion , Mr. Thompson ! Why , see her ! she ai n't frail on her feet ; she looks ye straight in the eyes ; she ai n't one of your hang - down misses . Look how she behaved at the ceremony ! "
158318	158321	158323	158323	Ripton	158	" Ah ! "
158325	158406	158323	158323	Ripton	158	" And if you 'd ha ' seen her when she spoke to me about my ring ! Depend upon it , my dear Mr. Richard , if she blinded you about the nerve she've got , it was somethin' she thought she ought to do for your sake , and I wish I 'd been by to counsel her , poor blessed babe ! And how much longer , now , can ye stay divided from that darlin ' ? "
158413	158419	158421	158422	Mrs. Berry	489	" A father 's will , "
158424	158448	158421	158422	Mrs. Berry	489	" that 's a son 's law ; but he must n't go again ' the laws of his nature to do it . "
158449	158466	158468	158468	Richard	489	" Just be quiet at present talk of other things , there 's a good woman , "
158477	158496	158497	158497	she	489	" How strange , now , our meetin ' like this ! meetin ' at all , too ! "
158501	158572	158497	158497	she	489	" It 's them advertisements ! They brings people together from the ends of the earth , for good or for bad . I often say , there 's more lucky accidents , or unlucky ones , since advertisements was the rule , than ever there was before . They make a number of romances , depend upon it ! Do you walk much in the Gardens , my dear ? "
158573	158578	158580	158580	Richard	489	" Now and then , "
158582	158598	158600	158601	Mrs. Berry	489	" Very pleasant it is there with the fine folks and flowers and titled people , "
158603	158621	158600	158601	Mrs. Berry	489	" That was a handsome woman you was a - walkin ' beside , this mornin ' . "
158622	158625	158627	158627	Richard	489	" Very , "
158629	158743	158627	158627	Richard	489	" She was a handsome woman ! or I should say , is , for her day ai n't past , and she know it . I thought at first by her back it might ha ' been your aunt , Mrs. Forey ; for she do step out well and hold up her shoulders : straight as a dart she be ! But when I come to see her face Oh , dear me ! says I , this ai n't one of the family . They none of 'em got such bold faces nor no lady as I know have . But she 's a fine woman that nobody can gainsay . "
158811	158817	158818	158818	Richard	489	" Look here , Penelope , "
158824	158852	158818	158818	Richard	489	" Will it make you comfortable if I tell you I 'll obey the laws of my nature and go down at the end of the week ? "
158853	158865	158866	158866	she	489	" I 'll thank the Lord of heaven if you do ! "
158869	158909	158866	158866	she	489	" Very well , then be happy I will . Now listen . I want you to keep your rooms for me those she had . I expect , in a day or two , to bring a lady here "
158910	158914	158916	158917	Mrs. Berry	489	" A lady ? "
158919	158925	158916	158917	Mrs. Berry	489	" Yes . A lady . "
158926	158938	158866	158866	she	489	" May I make so bold as to ask what lady ? "
158939	158953	158954	158955	Mrs. Berry	489	" You may not . Not now . Of course you will know . "
159001	159006	159007	159007	he	4741	" And Mrs. Berry , "
159014	159054	159007	159007	he	4741	" You will treat her as you did my dear girl , for she will require not only shelter but kindness . I would rather leave her with you than with any one . She has been very unfortunate . "
159082	159200	159201	159201	She	4742	" Unfort'nate ! He 's going to bring me an unfort'nate female ! Oh ! not from my babe can I bear that ! Never will I have her here ! I see it . It 's that bold - faced woman he 's got mixed up in , and she've been and made the young man think he 'll go for to reform her . It 's one o ' their arts that is ; and he 's too innocent a young man to mean anythin ' else . But I ai n't a house of Magdalens no ! and sooner than have her here I 'd have the roof fall over me , I would . "
159359	159369	159370	159371	Mrs. Berry	489	" You do n't look near your reform yet , "
159375	159436	159370	159371	Mrs. Berry	489	" You do n't look to me one that 'd come the Fair Penitent till you 've left off bein ' fair if then you do , which some of ye do n't . Laugh away and show yet airs ! Spite o ' your hat and feather , and your ridin ' habit , you 're a Belle Donna . "
159471	159474	159475	159475	she	489	" Never ! "
159483	159506	159475	159475	she	489	" He ai n't rided her out in the mornin ' , and been and made a Magdalen of her afore dark ? "
159576	159601	159572	159572	she	489	" Mr. Richard ! if that woman stay here , I go forth . My house ai n't a penitentiary for unfort'nate females , sir "
159648	159656	159642	159642	She	489	" My God , forgive , me ! "
159659	159666	159642	159642	She	489	" And her virtue was humbled . "
159678	159684	159675	159676	Mr. Richard	186	" And her virtue was humbled .
159919	159927	159928	159928	he	186	" Can sin hunt one like this ? "
160119	160194	160195	160195	Richard	489	" ' Tis a proof to me of your moral rectitude , my son , but the world will not think so . No one character is sufficient to cover two in a Protestant country especially . The divinity that doth hedge a Bishop would have no chance , in contact with your Madam Danae . Drop the woman , my son . Or permit me to speak what you would have her hear . "
160202	160212	160214	160214	Adrian	346	" Well , you 've had my doctorial warning , "
160254	160266	160268	160268	her	489	" Do not , oh , do not offend your father ! "
160364	160736	160360	160361	Mrs. Berry	489	" My lady , if I may speak so bold , I 'd say the sin that 's bein ' done is the sin o ' the lookers - on . And when everybody appear frightened by that young gentleman 's father , I 'll say hopin ' your pardon they no cause be frighted at all . For though it 's nigh twenty year since I knew him , and I knew him then just sixteen months no more I 'll say his heart 's as soft as a woman 's , which I 've cause for to know . And that 's it . That 's where everybody 's deceived by him , and I was . It 's because he keeps his face , and makes ye think you 're dealin ' with a man of iron , and all the while there 's a woman underneath . And a man that 's like a woman he 's the puzzle o ' life ! We can see through ourselves , my lady , and we can see through men , but one o ' that sort he 's like somethin' out of nature . Then I say hopin ' be excused what 's to do is for to treat him like a woman , and not for to let him have his own way which he do n't know himself , and is why nobody else do . Let that sweet young couple come together , and be wholesome in spite of him , I say ; and then give him time to come round , just like a woman ; and round he 'll come , and give 'em his blessin ' , and we shall know we 've made him comfortable . He 's angry because matrimony have come between him and his son , and he , woman - like , he 's wantin ' to treat what is as if it is n't . But matrimony 's a holier than him . It began long long before him , and it 's be hoped will endoor longs the time after , if the world 's not coming to rack wishin ' him no harm . "
160947	160951	160942	160942	she	3725	" You poor marter "
160957	161014	160952	160953	Mrs. Berry	489	" I know what your sufferin 's be . They is the only kind a wife should never hide from her husband . He thinks all sorts of things if she can abide being away . And you trusting to time , why it 's like trusting not to catch cold out of your natural clothes . "
161178	161189	161191	161191	she	512	" Call me Bella : I 'll call you Dick , "
161224	161235	161236	161236	she	512	" I pretend to be no better than I am , "
161239	161257	161236	161236	she	512	" and I know I 'm no worse than many a woman who holds her head high . "
161287	161340	161341	161341	She	512	" What you want , my dear Dick , is something to do . You went and got married like a hum ! friends must be respectful . Go into the Army . Try the turf . I can put you up to a trick or two friends should make themselves useful . "
161350	161392	161393	161393	She	512	" You 're the only man I was ever alone with who do n't talk to me of love and make me feel sick . I hate men who ca n't speak to a woman sensibly . Just wait a minute . "
161401	161413	161393	161393	She	512	" Ah , Dick ! old fellow ! how are you ? "
161445	161473	161436	161436	her	512	" What do you think of me ? Was n't it a shame to make a woman of me when I was born to be a man ? "
161474	161481	161483	161483	Richard	489	" I do n't know that , "
161503	161515	161483	161483	Richard	489	" What ! you think I do n't do it well ? "
161516	161525	161538	161538	she	512	" Charming ! but I ca n't forget ... "
161526	161533	161534	161534	she	512	" Now that is too bad ! "
161582	161655	161578	161580	the supreme dandy	4811	" They take up men , Dick , for going about in women 's clothes , and vice versaw , I suppose . You 'll bail me , old fellaa , if I have to make my bow to the beak , wo n't you ? Say it 's becas I 'm an honest woman and do n't care to hide the a unmentionables when I wear them as the t'others do , "
161675	161696	161698	161698	he	4812	" You 're a wopper , my brave Dick ! wo n't let any peeler take me ? by Jove ! "
161740	161744	161736	161738	a graceful cavalier	4814	" Sir Julius , "
161777	161781	161773	161774	the lady	990	" vice versaw , "
161908	161936	161902	161902	She	2509	" Is this true ? that you have been seen going publicly about with an infamous woman , Richard ? Tell me ! pray , relieve me ! "
161957	161977	161902	161902	She	2509	" Tell me , I say ! Do n't quibble . Do you know any woman of bad character ? "
162024	162033	162001	162002	Mrs. Doria	138	" That ridiculous System ! That disgraceful marriage ! "
162082	162099	162100	162101	Lady Blandish	489	" Instead of her doing me harm , it 's I that will do her good . "
162111	162127	162103	162103	her	489	" This person must be very clever to have given you that delusion , dear . "
162128	162140	162103	162103	her	489	" She is clever . And the world treats her shamefully . "
162141	162150	162103	162103	her	489	" She complains of her position to you ? "
162151	162170	162103	162103	her	489	" Not a word . But I will stand by her . She has no friend but me . "
162171	162183	162103	162103	her	489	" My poor boy ! has she made you think that ? "
162184	162191	162193	162193	Richard	489	" How unjust you all are ! "
162195	162211	162213	162214	Lady Blandish	489	" How mad and wicked is the man who can let him be tempted so ! "
162261	162300	162256	162258	the young man	2387	" My child ! the world may be very bad . I am not going to defend it . But you have some one else to think of . Have you forgotten you have a wife , Richard ? "
162301	162352	162256	162258	the young man	2387	" Ay ! you all speak of her now . There 's my aunt : ' Remember you have a wife ! ' Do you think I love any one but Lucy ? poor little thing ! Because I am married am I to give up the society of women ? "
162353	162357	162384	162384	his	346	" Of women ! "
162358	162365	162256	162258	the young man	2387	" Is n't she a woman ? "
162366	162371	162373	162377	the defender of her sex	4833	" Too much so ! "
162421	162431	162433	162433	Adrian	346	" We wo n't quarrel , my dear boy , "
162435	162511	162433	162433	Adrian	346	" I 'm a man of peace . Besides , we are not fairly proportioned for a combat . Ride your steed to virtue 's goal ! All I say is , that I think he 'll upset you , and it 's better to go at a slow pace and in companionship with the children of the sun . You have a very nice little woman for a wife well , good - bye ! "
162558	162565	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Why , you 're taller , "
162571	162599	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Of course I am . Do n't you remember you said I was such a little thing when I came out of my woman 's shell ? "
162600	162608	162566	162566	Richard	489	" And how have you done it ? "
162609	162615	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Grown to please you . "
162616	162630	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Now , if you can do that , you can do anything . "
162631	162639	162566	162566	Richard	489	" And so I would do anything . "
162640	162644	162566	162566	Richard	489	" You would ? "
162645	162648	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Honour ! "
162649	162650	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Then"
162671	162675	162677	162677	she	4841	" Then what ? "
162679	162687	162677	162677	she	4841	" Then you 're a gallant fellow . "
162688	162692	162566	162566	Richard	489	" That all ? "
162693	162699	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Is n't it enough ? "
162700	162718	162677	162677	she	4841	" Not quite . You were going to say something . I saw it in your eyes . "
162719	162727	162566	162566	Richard	489	" You saw that I admired you . "
162728	162740	162566	162566	Richard	489	" Yes , but a man must n't admire a man . "
162741	162753	162677	162677	she	4841	" I suppose I had an idea you were a woman . "
162754	162770	162566	162566	Richard	489	" What ! when I had the heels of my boots raised half an inch , "
162783	162795	162796	162796	she	4841	" I do n't come much above your shoulder even now , "
162813	162819	162796	162796	she	4841	" You must grow more . "
162820	162835	162845	162845	he	529	" ' Fraid I ca n't , Dick ! Bootmakers ca n't do it . "
162836	162843	162845	162845	he	529	" I 'll show you how , "
162873	162878	162845	162845	he	529	" Will that do ? "
162879	162890	162845	162845	he	529	" Yes ! Oh but I ca n't stay here . "
162891	162897	162845	162845	he	529	" Why ca n't you ? "
162898	162904	162905	162905	He	529	" Why ca n't I ? "
162986	162995	162996	162996	she	4844	" I ought to have been an actress , "
163012	163024	163026	163027	Mrs. Mount	512	" Yes ! Ah ! then ! if I had been ! "
163046	163055	163037	163037	He	529	" You are not happy as you are ? "
163056	163059	163037	163037	He	529	" No . "
163060	163067	163037	163037	He	529	" May I speak to you ? "
163068	163071	163072	163072	Her	512	" Yes . "
163115	163143	163110	163110	she	512	" Old hypocrites talk in that way ; but I never heard of a young man doing it , and not making love at the same time . "
163166	163174	163175	163175	she	512	" Do n't make me thrice ashamed , "
163213	163261	163208	163208	she	512	" Happy ? who dares say I 'm not happy ? D'you think if the world whips me I 'll wince ? D'you think I care for what they say or do ? Let them kill me ! they shall never get one cry out of me ! "
163278	163286	163208	163208	she	512	" There ! now you know me ! "
163309	163316	163318	163319	Lady Blandish	489	" This must not go on , "
163392	163396	163398	163400	the wise youth	746	" Do it , "
163409	163483	163398	163400	the wise youth	746	" do it , if you want him to be a hermit for life . You will bring back nothing but his dead body , ladies a Hellenic , rather than a Roman , triumph . He will listen to you he will accompany you to the station he will hand you into the carriage and when you point to his seat he will bow profoundly , and retire into his congenial mists . "
163495	163504	163506	163507	Mrs. Doria	138	" Speak to him , you , Adrian , "
163509	163533	163506	163507	Mrs. Doria	138	" Speak to the boy solemnly . It would be almost better he should go back to that little thing he has married . "
163534	163537	163538	163539	Lady Blandish	489	" Almost ? "
163544	163557	163538	163539	Lady Blandish	489	" I have been advising it for the last month and more . "
163558	163564	163566	163567	Mrs. Doria	138	" A choice of evils , "
163618	163628	163629	163629	he	346	" Well , I 'll talk to him again , "
163632	163645	163629	163629	he	346	" I 'll try to get the Engine on the conventional line . "
163646	163650	163652	163653	Mrs. Doria	138	" Command him ! "
163655	163669	163671	163672	Lady Blandish	489	" Gentle means are , I think , the only means with Richard , "
163689	163882	163684	163684	Adrian	346	" You want to reform this woman . Her manner is open fair and free the traditional characteristic . We wo n't stop to canvass how that particular honesty of deportment that wins your approbation has been gained . In her college it is not uncommon . Girls , you know , are not like boys . At a certain age they ca n't be quite natural . It 's a bad sign if they do n't blush , and fib , and affect this and that . It wears off when they 're women . But a woman who speaks like a man , and has all those excellent virtues you admire where has she learned the trick ? She tells you . You do n't surely approve of the school ? Well , what is there in it , then ? Reform her , of course . The task is worthy of your energies . But , if you are appointed to do it , do n't do it publicly , and do n't attempt it just now . May I ask you whether your wife participates in this undertaking ? "
163982	163998	163999	163999	she	8173	" Richard I ca n't call you Dick now , I really do n't know why "
164002	164012	163999	163999	she	8173	" I want to beg a favour of you . "
164013	164027	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" Name it . I can still call you Bella , I suppose ? "
164028	164057	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" If you care to . What I want to say is this : when you meet me out to cut it short please not to recognize me . "
164058	164062	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" And why ? "
164063	164072	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" Do you ask to be told that ? "
164073	164078	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" Certainly I do . "
164079	164089	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" Then look : I wo n't compromise you . "
164090	164098	163967	163968	The enchantress	4860	" I see no harm , Bella . "
164099	164102	164103	164103	she	8173	" No , "
164108	164120	164103	164103	she	8173	" and there is none . I know that . But , "
164126	164131	164103	164103	she	8173	" other people do , "
164137	164146	164103	164103	she	8173	" What do we care for other people ? "
164147	164157	164159	164159	her	8173	" Nothing . I do n't . Not that ! "
164162	164170	164159	164159	her	8173	" I care for you , though . "
164178	164185	164103	164103	she	8173	" You 're foolish , Bella . "
164186	164195	164196	164196	He	4862	" Not quite so giddy that 's all . "
164489	164511	164482	164482	she	7589	" Richard ! I am not what I was since I knew you . You will not give me up quite ? "
164512	164517	164554	164554	She	7589	" Never , Bella . "
164518	164529	164554	164554	She	7589	" I am not so bad as I 'm painted ! "
164530	164536	164554	164554	She	7589	" You are only unfortunate . "
164537	164553	164554	164554	She	7589	" Now that I know you I think so , and yet I am happier . "
164593	164600	164601	164601	he	4883	" Did you love the man ? "
164604	164613	164601	164601	he	4883	" You say you love no one now . "
164614	164660	164574	164575	A woman	1754	" Did I love him ? He was a nobleman and I a tradesman 's daughter . No . I did not love him . I have lived to learn it . And now I should hate him , if I did not despise him . "
164661	164669	164671	164671	Richard	489	" Can you be deceived in love ? "
164680	164742	164671	164671	Richard	489	" Yes . When we 're young we can be very easily deceived . If there is such a thing as love , we discover it after we have tossed about and roughed it . Then we find the man , or the woman , that suits us : and then it 's too late ! we ca n't have him . "
164743	164746	164748	164748	Richard	489	" Singular ! "
164759	164764	164751	164751	she	4886	" He spoke aloud : "
164775	164776	164751	164751	she	4886	" "
164792	164793	164787	164788	a girl	809	" "
164806	164813	164801	164801	He	1400	" She chose to admit that . "
164837	164838	164831	164831	he	4890	" "
164848	164849	164831	164831	he	4890	" "
164854	164860	164831	164831	he	4890	" He repelled the insinuation . "
164870	164928	164868	164868	Bella	521	" Nevertheless she had opened a wider view of the world to him , and a colder . He thought poorly of girls . A woman a sensible , brave , beautiful woman seemed , on comparison , infinitely nobler than those weak creatures . She was best in her character of lovely rebel accusing foul injustice . "
165129	165622	165124	165124	I	0	" And so forth : direr things . Imputations upon wives : horrible exultation at the universal peccancy of husbands . This lovely outcast almost made him think she had the right on her side , so keenly her Parthian arrows pierced the holy centres of society , and exposed its rottenness . Mrs. Mount 's house was discreetly conducted : nothing ever occurred to shock him there . The young man would ask himself where the difference was between her and the Women of society ? How base , too , was the army of banded hypocrites ! He was ready to declare war against them on her behalf . His casus beli , accurately worded , would have read curiously . Because the world refused to lure the lady to virtue with the offer of a housemaid 's place , our knight threw down his challenge . But the lady had scornfully rebutted this prospect of a return to chastity . Then the form of the challenge must be : Because the world declined to support the lady in luxury for nothing ! But what did that mean ? In other words : she was to receive the devil 's wages without rendering him her services . Such an arrangement appears hardly fair on the world or on the devil . Heroes will have to conquer both before they will get them to subscribe to it . Heroes , however , are not in the habit of wording their declarations of war at all . Lance in rest they challenge and they charge . Like women they trust to instinct , and graft on it the muscle of men . Wide fly the leisurely - remonstrating hosts : institutions are scattered , they know not wherefore , heads are broken that have not the balm of a reason why . ' Tis instinct strikes ! Surely there is something divine in instinct . Still , war declared , where were these hosts ? The hero could not charge down on the ladies and gentlemen in a ballroom , and spoil the quadrille . He had sufficient reticence to avoid sounding his challenge in the Law Courts ; nor could he well go into the Houses of Parliament with a trumpet , though to come to a tussle with the nation 's direct representatives did seem the likelier method . It was likewise out of the question that he should enter every house and shop , and battle with its master in the cause of Mrs. Mount . Where , then , was his enemy ? Everybody was his enemy , and everybody was nowhere ! Shall he convoke multitudes on Wimbledon Common ? Blue Policemen , and a distant dread of ridicule , bar all his projects . Alas for the hero in our day ! Nothing teaches a strong arm its impotence so much as knocking at empty air . "
165632	165647	165648	165649	O Rip	534	" cried Richard , after fighting his phantom enemy till he was worn out . "
165654	165660	165651	165652	old Rip	534	" he addressed his friend , "
165766	165814	165763	165764	a devil	7146	" It was only friend Ripton 's ear that was required , so his words went for little : but Ripton did say he thought there was small matter to be ashamed of in winning and wearing the Beauty of Earth . Richard added his customary comment of "
165819	165902	165815	165817	Poor little thing	4910	" He fought his duello with empty air till he was exhausted . A last letter written to his father procured him no reply . Then , said he , I have tried my utmost . I have tried to be dutiful my father wo n't listen to me . One thing I can do I can go down to my dear girl , and make her happy , and save her at least from some of the consequences of my rashness . "
165910	165992	165994	165994	I	0	" he groaned . His great ambition must be covered by a house - top : he and the cat must warm themselves on the domestic hearth ! The hero was not aware that his heart moved him to this . His heart was not now in open communion with his mind . Mrs. Mount heard that her friend was going would go . She knew he was going to his wife . Far from discouraging him , she said nobly : "
166095	166125	166088	166088	I	0	" Lady Blandish heard from Adrian that Richard was positively going to his wife . The wise youth modestly veiled his own merit in bringing it about by saying : "
166141	166142	166130	166137	that poor little woman left alone down there	4916	" "
166147	166160	166130	166137	that poor little woman left alone down there	4916	" said Mrs. Doria , to whom the modest speech was repeated , "
166176	166200	166161	166161	I	0	" Richard bade them adieu , and went to spend his last evening with Mrs. Mount . The enchantress received him in state . "
166276	166378	166268	166268	you	831	" She was gay . She revived Sir Julius occasionally . He , dispirited , left the talking all to her . Mrs. Mount kept a footman . At a late hour the man of calves dressed the table for supper . It was a point of honour for Richard to sit down to it and try to eat . Drinking , thanks to the kindly mother nature , who loves to see her children made fools of , is always an easier matter . The footman was diligent ; the champagne corks feebly recalled the file - firing at Richmond . "
166391	166414	166389	166389	Dick	4921	" said the enchantress . Oh , the glorious wreck she looked . His heart choked as he gulped the buzzing wine . "
166422	166426	166427	166427	They	4923	" she cried . "
166671	166672	166666	166666	you	513	" "
166683	166701	166702	166702	You	513	" pleaded John , and the man 's hand was unsteady as he poured out the wine . "
166716	166724	166725	166725	My	0	" John footman went from the room . "
166738	166749	166729	166729	Richard	489	" He showed a deep frown on a colourless face . "
166792	166811	166813	166813	me	0	" She cheered , and laughed . A lurid splendour glanced about her like lights from the pit . "
166887	166888	166882	166882	you	4940	" "
166894	166924	166882	166882	you	4940	" Richard shouted . He drank a couple of glasses in succession , and stared about . Was he in hell , with a lost soul raving to him ? "
166943	166955	166941	166941	companions	4950	" She wished that heaven had made her such a man . "
166968	166980	166960	166960	Dick	4952	" Softly fell her voice . Her eyes threw slanting beams . "
166986	167015	166982	166982	you	4951	" She pointed to a symbolic golden anchor studded with gems and coiled with a rope of hair in her bosom . It was a gift of his . "
167041	167055	167028	167028	you	4951	" She rose from the table , and threw herself on the sofa . "
167075	167097	167064	167064	I	0	" Something of the strength of Samson went out of him as he inspected his hair on the bosom of Delilah . "
167152	167166	167140	167140	Dick	4956	" She curled up her feet to give him place on the sofa . "
167251	167259	167247	167247	you	4951	" Richard pushed a few months forward . "
167284	167299	167300	167300	You	4951	" Richard had given the lady twenty - five years . She laughed violently . "
167381	167382	167377	167377	I	0	" "
167389	167395	167396	167396	I	0	name!" ... he stopped short . "
167486	167521	167522	167522	Bella	521	" Richard seized some dead champagne , emptied the bottle into a tumbler , and drank it off . John footman entered to clear the table , and they were left without further interruption . "
167526	167563	167564	167564	Bella	521	" Richard uttered in a deep sad voice , as he walked the room . She leaned on her arm , her hair crushed against a reddened cheek , her eyes half - shut and dreamy . "
167566	167572	167564	167564	Bella	521	" he dropped beside her . "
167577	167590	167573	167573	You	521	" She blinked and yawned , as one who is awakened suddenly . "
167596	167600	167593	167593	you	4971	" said she . "
167634	167635	167624	167625	So young	4972	" "
167646	167674	167624	167625	So young	4972	" The mighty pity falling from his eyes took in her whole shape . She did not mistake it for tenderness , as another would have done . "
167727	167777	167778	167778	Bella	521	" Her hand was shaken in his by the passion of torment with which his frame quaked . Involuntarily a tear started between her eyelids . She glanced up at him quickly , then looked down , drew her hand from his , and smoothed it , eying it . "
167786	167787	167788	167789	A linendraper	4975	" "
167801	167849	167793	167793	He	4974	" This article of apparel instantaneously changed the tone of the conversation , for he , rising abruptly , nearly squashed the lady 's lap - dog , whose squeaks and howls were piteous , and demanded the most fervent caresses of its mistress . It was : "
167942	167943	167927	167928	his mistress	4978	" "
167946	167960	167961	167961	you	0	" said Richard , savagely , from the other end of the room , "
167970	167971	167961	167961	you	0	" "
167977	168006	167961	167961	you	0	" Mumpsy was simperingly assured in the thick of his silky flanks . Richard looked for his hat . Mumpsy was deposited on the sofa in a twinkling . "
168009	168014	167961	167961	you	0	" said the lady , "
168148	168180	168181	168183	The dear dog	4985	" First a smile changed Richard 's face ; then laughing a melancholy laugh , he surrendered to her humour , and went through the form of begging Mumpsy 's pardon . "
168195	168199	168188	168188	he	541	" said she . "
168208	168209	168205	168206	Noble animal	4987	" "
168269	168491	168260	168261	Sir Julius	529	" She ran out . A white visage reappeared behind a spring of flame . Her black hair was scattered over her shoulders and fell half across her brows . She moved slowly , and came up to him , fastening weird eyes on him , pointing a finger at the region of witches . Sepulchral cadences accompanied the representation . He did not listen , for he was thinking what a deadly charming and exquisitely horrid witch she was . Something in the way her underlids worked seemed to remind him of a forgotten picture ; but a veil hung on the picture . There could be no analogy , for this was beautiful and devilish , and that , if he remembered rightly , had the beauty of seraphs . His reflections and her performance were stayed by a shriek . The spirits of wine had run over the plate she held to the floor . She had the coolness to put the plate down on the table , while he stamped out the flame on the carpet . Again she shrieked : she thought she was on fire . He fell on his knees and clasped her skirts all round , drawing his arms down them several times . Still kneeling , he looked up , and asked , "
168498	168518	168520	168520	you	4991	" She bent her face glaring down till the ends of her hair touched his cheek . Said she , "
168522	168551	168520	168520	you	4991	" Was she a witch verily ? There was sorcery in her breath ; sorcery in her hair : the ends of it stung him like little snakes . "
168560	168567	168558	168558	Dick	4992	" she flung back , laughing . "
168575	168583	168569	168569	you	4990	" he said , and took breath . "
168616	168630	168613	168614	a witch	9392	" She sang , throwing her hair about , and stamping her feet . "
168645	168646	168643	168643	myself	0	" "
168660	168673	168653	168653	I	0	" He gazed at her with a mixture of wonder and admiration . "

168692	168698	168699	168699	you	489	" her tone was serious , "
168710	168711	168699	168699	you	489	" "
168721	168722	168719	168719	Bella	521	" "
168734	168735	168738	168738	you	489	" "
168746	168747	168736	168736	Bella	521	" "
168757	168758	168755	168755	Richard	489	" "
168768	168769	168766	168766	Bella	521	" "
168776	168803	168766	168766	Bella	521	" Her head shook sorrowfully at the glistening fire - irons . He followed the abstracted intentness of her look , and came upon her words . "
168819	168820	168817	168817	him	6302	" "
168841	168842	168822	168822	I	0	" "

168951	168987	168988	168988	We	5007	" and away she burst from him , and up flew her hair , as she danced across the room , and fell at full length on the sofa . He felt giddy : bewitched . "
168997	169006	168995	168995	Dick	5008	" she called to him from the sofa . "
169111	169185	169109	169109	Dick	5012	" He was reflecting on the fact that her eyes were brown . They had a haughty sparkle when she pleased , and when she pleased a soft languor circled them . Excitement had dyed her cheeks deep red . He was a youth , and she an enchantress . He a hero ; she a female will - o'-the - wisp . The eyes were languid now , set in rosy colour . "
169198	169206	169186	169186	You	5012	" He had no thought of departing : "
169255	169263	169266	169266	he	5015	" He grasped her hand at this . "
169283	169284	169277	169277	they	5017	" "
169291	169298	169289	169289	Bella	542	" She drank in his homage . "
169333	169334	169331	169331	Richard	489	" "
169346	169347	169344	169344	Bella	542	" "
169354	169363	169344	169344	Bella	542	" Her voice trolled out some lively roulades . "
169457	169470	169472	169472	My	0	" She went to the piano , struck the notes , and sang "
169484	169592	169472	169472	My	0	" Because I 'm such a rake . I do n't know any other reason . No ; I hate sentimental songs . Wo n't sing that . Ta - tiddy - tiddy - iddy a ... e ! How ridiculous those women were , coming home from Richmond ! ' Once the sweet romance of story Clad thy moving form with grace ; Once the world and all its glory Was but framework to thy face . Ah , too fair ! what I remember Might my soul recall but no ! To the winds this wretched ember Of a fire that falls so low ! ' "
169671	169763	169767	169772	young gentlemen made of made of	5029	" I used to sing that when I was a girl , sweet Richard , and did n't know at all , at all , what it meant . Must n't sing that sort of song in company . We 're oh ! so proper even we ! ' If I had a husband , what think you I 'd do ? I 'd make it my business to keep him a lover ; For when a young gentleman ceases to woo , Some other amusement he 'll quickly discover . ' "
169781	170258	169776	169777	young gentlemen	6206	" After this trifling she sang a Spanish ballad sweetly . He was in the mood when imagination intensely vivifies everything . Mere suggestions of music sufficed . The lady in the ballad had been wronged . Lo ! it was the lady before him ; and soft horns blew ; he smelt the languid night - flowers ; he saw the stars crowd large and close above the arid plain this lady leaning at her window desolate , pouring out her abandoned heart . Heroes know little what they owe to champagne . The lady wandered to Venice . Thither he followed her at a leap . In Venice she was not happy . He was prepared for the misery of any woman anywhere . But , oh ! to be with her ! To glide with phantom - motion through throbbing street ; past houses muffled in shadow and gloomy legends ; under storied bridges ; past palaces charged with full life in dead quietness ; past grand old towers , colossal squares , gleaming quays , and out , and on with her , on into the silver infinity shaking over seas ! Was it the champagne ? the music ? or the poetry ? Something of the two former , perhaps : but most the enchantress playing upon him . How many instruments can not clever women play upon at the same moment ! And this enchantress was not too clever , or he might have felt her touch . She was no longer absolutely bent on winning him , or he might have seen a manoeuvre . She liked him liked none better . She wished him well . Her pique was satisfied . Still he was handsome , and he was going . What she liked him for , she rather very slightly wished to do away with , or see if it could be done away with : just as one wishes to catch a pretty butterfly , without hurting its patterned wings . No harm intended to the innocent insect , only one wants to inspect it thoroughly , and enjoy the marvel of it , in one 's tender possession , and have the felicity of thinking one could crush it , if one would . He knew her what she was , this lady . In Seville , or in Venice , the spot was on her . Sailing the pathways of the moon it was not celestial light that illumined her beauty . Her sin was there : but in dreaming to save , he was soft to her sin drowned it in deep mournfulness . Silence , and the rustle of her dress , awoke him from his musing . She swam wave - like to the sofa . She was at his feet . "
170290	170298	170299	170299	You	489	" Those witch underlids were working brightly . "
170312	170326	170306	170306	I	0	" Her lips twitched . She thought him such a very handsome fellow . "
170350	170403	170404	170404	Bella	542	" Now at those words , as he looked down on her haggard loveliness , not divine sorrow but a devouring jealousy sprang like fire in his breast , and set him rocking with horrid pain . He bent closer to her pale beseeching face . Her eyes still drew him down . "
170416	170417	170420	170420	Richard	489	" "
170430	170434	170435	170435	I	0	" He cried : "
170439	170509	170435	170435	I	0	" and strained her in his arms , and kissed her passionately on the lips . She was not acting now as she sidled and slunk her half - averted head with a kind of maiden shame under his arm , sighing heavily , weeping , clinging to him . It was wicked truth . Not a word of love between them ! Was ever hero in this fashion won ?
170557	170565	170566	170566	they	5038	" Mount 's in for it again , "
170571	170576	170566	170566	they	5038	" Hang the women ! "
171252	171272	171249	171250	a woman	1754	" He , a great nobleman , does not scorn to acknowledge me , and think something of me , "
171403	171411	171412	171412	he	495	" I have n't advanced an inch , "
171415	171529	171412	171412	he	495	" Brayder ! upon my soul , that little woman could do anything with me . By heaven ! I 'd marry her to - morrow . Here I am , seeing her every day in the week out or in , and what do you think she gets me to talk about ? history ! Is n't it enough to make a fellow mad ? and there am I lecturing like a prig , and by heaven ! while I 'm at it I feel a pleasure in it ; and when I leave the house I should feel an immense gratification in shooting somebody . What do they say in town ? "
171530	171534	171536	171536	Brayder	495	" Not much , "
171540	171550	171536	171536	Brayder	495	" When 's that fellow her husband coming down ? "
171551	171564	171565	171565	Nobleman	550	" I rather hope we 've settled him for life , Mount . "
171571	171576	171567	171567	parasite	5074	" How d'ye mean ? "
171588	171603	171577	171577	Brayder	495	" He 's in for Don Juan at a gallop , that 's all . "
171604	171613	171614	171614	Mountfalcon	486	" The deuce ! Has Bella got him ? "
171635	171638	171619	171619	Brayder	495	" Richard , "

171728	171742	171704	171704	You	5078	" Mountfalcon turned over the letter to see if there was any more . "
171748	171763	171704	171704	You	5078	" he remarked , and rising from his chair and striding about , muttered , "
171774	171775	171769	171769	he	5079	" "
171779	171783	171769	171769	he	5079	" said Brayder . "

171852	171853	171855	171855	she	5082	" "
171914	171955	171975	171975	she	5082	" Mountfalcon took counsel of his parasite as to the end the letter could be made to serve . Both conscientiously agreed that Richard 's behaviour to his wife was infamous , and that he at least deserved no mercy . "
171958	171963	171975	171975	she	5082	" said his lordship , "
171997	171998	171994	171995	the sluts	5086	" "
172004	172010	172011	172011	She	5082	" said Brayder , carelessly . "
172054	172055	172056	172056	You	512	" "
172063	172068	172069	172069	You	512	" the nobleman exclaimed . "
172114	172115	172105	172106	Her husband	1653	" "
172125	172126	172117	172117	you	512	" "
172133	172138	172140	172140	you	512	" muttered my lord . "
172164	172165	172166	172166	I	0	" "
172224	172229	172213	172214	a fool	814	" Mountfalcon yawned despondently . "
172236	172240	172233	172233	you	512	" he pursued . "
172253	172270	172233	172233	you	512	She's" ... he mentioned something in an underbreath , and turned red as he said it . "
172273	172290	172233	172233	you	512	" Brayder put up his mouth and rapped the handle of his cane on his chin . "
172317	172318	172320	172320	you	512	" "
172329	172338	172320	172320	you	512	" broke out my lord in a frenzy . "
172370	172371	172342	172342	I	0	" "
172382	172392	172380	172380	Mount	512	" The nobleman appeared silently to accept the imputation . "
172400	172422	172395	172395	they	5098	" he asked again . Brayder said the sole question was , whether it was maid , wife , or widow . "
172431	172447	172423	172423	I	0	" Mountfalcon resumed , after to judge by the cast of his face reflecting deeply . "
172467	172468	172456	172456	She	5091	" "
172480	172481	172474	172474	she	5091	" "
172503	172504	172505	172506	A hm	3974	" "
172508	172514	172505	172506	A hm	3974	" went the Honourable Peter . "
172527	172528	172521	172523	the Green Man	5102	" "
172542	172543	172540	172540	Brayder	495	" "
172587	172588	172571	172571	I	0	" "
172597	172601	172589	172589	I	0	" Mountfalcon repeated . "
172673	172674	172676	172676	you	0	" "
172678	172684	172676	172676	you	0	" inquired the cunning one . "
172698	172787	172685	172685	My	0	" said Mountfalcon , evading his parasite 's eye as he spoke . To the world , Lord Mountfalcon was the thoroughly wicked man ; his parasite simply ingeniously dissipated . Full many a man of God had thought it the easier task to reclaim the Hon . Peter . Lucy received her noble friend by firelight that evening , and sat much in the shade . She offered to have the candles brought in . He begged her to allow the room to remain as it was . "
172796	172804	172788	172788	I	0	" he observed with a certain solemnity . "
172809	172844	172788	172788	I	0	" said Lucy , quickly . Lord Mountfalcon knew he had a great deal to say , but how to say it , and what it exactly was , he did not know . ' "
172850	172854	172788	172788	I	0	" he began , "
172867	172868	172862	172862	I	0	" "
172883	172887	172877	172877	your	0	" said Lucy . "
172893	172905	172877	172877	your	0	" Her face was in shade and could not belie her . "
172925	172926	172922	172923	Mrs. Feverel	551	" "
172934	172938	172922	172923	Mrs. Feverel	551	" Lucy replied . "
172949	172950	172922	172923	Mrs. Feverel	551	" "
172977	172978	172965	172965	you	0	" "
172984	173007	172965	172965	you	0	" said Lucy , not displeased . It is sweet for a woman to believe she has drawn the serpent 's teeth . "
173014	173020	173008	173008	I	0	" Lord Mountfalcon went on . "
173042	173043	173032	173032	you	0	" "
173053	173057	173032	173032	you	0	" interposed Lucy . "
173065	173066	173032	173032	you	0	" "
173079	173080	173081	173081	I	0	" "
173098	173099	173100	173100	Your	0	" "
173106	173107	173100	173100	Your	0	" "
173116	173123	173111	173111	I	0	" His lordship held impressively mute . "
173129	173133	173134	173134	He	486	" thought Lucy . "
173140	173188	173134	173134	He	486	" Tom Bakewell , who had a habit of coming into the room on various pretences during the nobleman 's visits , put a stop to the revelation , if his lordship intended to make any . When they were alone again , Lucy said , smiling : "
173205	173209	173193	173193	I	0	" Mountfalcon stared . "
173219	173226	173193	173193	I	0	" he remembered his evening duties . "
173242	173243	173240	173240	we	5119	" "
173323	173324	173315	173315	I	0	" "
173351	173352	173338	173338	I	0	" "
173359	173360	173354	173354	you	486	" "
173366	173390	173354	173354	you	486	" Lord Mountfalcon had fine full eyes , and by merely dropping the lids he could appear to endow them with mental expression . "
173397	173401	173354	173354	you	486	" said Lucy . "
173410	173583	173407	173407	your	486	" The nobleman went on his honour loudly . Now it was an object of Lucy 's to have him reading ; for his sake , for her sake , and for somebody else 's sake ; which somebody else was probably considered first in the matter . When he was reading to her , he seemed to be legitimizing his presence there ; and though she had no doubts or suspicions whatever , she was easier in her heart while she had him employed in that office . So she rose to fetch the book , laid it open on the table at his lordship 's elbow , and quietly waited to ring for candles when he should be willing to commence . That evening Lord Mountfalcon could not get himself up to the farce , and he felt a pity for the strangely innocent unprotected child with anguish hanging over her , that withheld the words he wanted to speak , or insinuate . He sat silent and did nothing . "
173592	173598	173585	173585	I	0	" said Lucy , meditatively , "
173623	173624	173617	173617	I	0	" "
173636	173641	173642	173644	The Emperor Julian	552	" Lord Mountfalcon asked . "
173646	173647	173642	173644	The Emperor Julian	552	" "
173683	173684	173673	173673	He	5124	" "
173689	173693	173673	173673	He	5124	" cried Lucy . "
173701	173702	173703	173703	I	0	" "
173706	173707	173708	173708	You	0	" "
173713	173714	173708	173708	You	0	" "
173725	173726	173717	173717	I	0	" "
173740	173741	173733	173733	you	0	" "
173748	173765	173733	173733	you	0	" Lucy slightly shuddered . She put her hand upon the bell to ring for lights . "
173775	173780	173772	173773	Mrs. Feverel	551	" said the nobleman . "
173801	173802	173786	173786	I	0	" "
173816	173918	173786	173786	I	0	" Lucy 's hand pressed the bell . She did not like the doubtful light with one who was so unscrupulous . Lord Mountfalcon had never spoken in this way before . He spoke better , too . She missed the aristocratic twang in his voice , and the hesitation for words , and the fluid lordliness with which he rolled over difficulties in speech . Simultaneously with the sounding of the bell the door opened , and presented Tom Bakewell . There was a double knock at the same instant at the street door . Lucy delayed to give orders . "
173930	173937	173925	173925	Tom	199	" she said , changing colour . "
173943	173944	173925	173925	Tom	199	" "
173948	173958	173786	173786	I	0	" Tom remarked , as he obeyed his mistress . "
173970	173975	173967	173968	Mrs. Feverel	551	" Lord Mountfalcon inquired . "
173987	174003	173982	173982	I	0	" said Lucy . Her quick ear caught the tones of a voice she remembered . "
174014	174032	174033	174034	Mrs. Berry	489	" she cried , starting up . Tom ushered a bunch of black satin into the room . "
174036	174048	174033	174034	Mrs. Berry	489	" said Lucy , running up to her and kissing her . "
174055	174070	174033	174034	Mrs. Berry	489	" Mrs. Berry , breathless and rosy with her journey , returned the salute . "
174131	174152	174128	174128	he	6445	" She beheld a male figure in a chair by the half light , and swung around to address him . "
174157	174167	174153	174153	You	6445	" she held aloft one of her fat fingers , "
174199	174208	174193	174193	your	6445	" she melted , as was her custom , "
174226	174252	174210	174210	I	0	" Before Lord Mountfalcon could find time to expostulate the soft woman had him by the neck , and was down among his luxurious whiskers . "
174255	174266	174210	174210	I	0	" She gave a smothered shriek , and fell back . "
174272	174281	174210	174210	I	0	" Tom Bakewell just then illumined the transaction . "
174287	174294	174210	174210	I	0	" Mrs. Berry breathed with horror , "
174303	174325	174210	174210	I	0	" Lucy , half - laughing , but in dreadful concern , begged the noble lord to excuse the woful mistake . "
174336	174348	174332	174332	I	0	" said his lordship , re - arranging his disconcerted moustache ; "
174358	174359	174332	174332	I	0	" "
174369	174381	174366	174367	Mrs. Berry	489	" said Lucy , taking her hand to lend her countenance . "
174388	174464	174385	174386	Mrs. Berry	489	" Mrs. Berry sought grace while she performed a series of apologetic bobs , and wiped the perspiration from her forehead . Lucy put her into a chair : Lord Mountfalcon asked for an account of her passage over to the Island ; receiving distressingly full particulars , by which it was revealed that the softness of her heart was only equalled by the weakness of her stomach . The recital calmed Mrs. Berry down . "
174482	174492	174476	174477	yer husband	5145	" Mrs. Berry turned from her tale to question . "
174501	174510	174494	174494	you	0	" said Lucy , in a broken voice . "
174530	174536	174537	174537	We	5148	" Lucy did not speak . "
174551	174606	174548	174548	I	0	" said Lord Mountfalcon , rising and bowing . Lucy gave him her hand with mute thanks . He touched it distantly , embraced Mrs. Berry in a farewell bow , and was shown out of the house by Tom Bakewell . The moment he was gone , Mrs. Berry threw up her arms . "
174624	174628	174608	174608	ye	5149	" she exclaimed . "
174760	174761	174762	174763	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
174765	174770	174772	174772	you	489	" Lucy checked her , "
174779	174780	174772	174772	you	489	" "
174786	174790	174772	174772	you	489	" retorted Berry . "
174810	174811	174804	174804	you	489	" "
174823	174836	174812	174812	I	0	" said Lucy , and her tears rolled heavily off her cheeks . "
174845	174849	174850	174852	O Mrs. Berry	489	" Berry echoed . "
174981	175046	175047	175047	Fiddle	555	" Mrs. Berry was inclined to be miserable at what she heard from Lucy 's lips , and she was herself full of dire apprehension ; but it was never this excellent creature 's system to be miserable in company . The sight of a sorrow that was not positive , and could not refer to proof , set her resolutely the other way . "
175051	175055	175047	175047	Fiddle	555	" she said . "
175231	175232	175253	175254	his father	775	" "
175235	175239	175253	175254	his father	775	" cried Lucy , "
175256	175269	175249	175249	he	9175	" She burst into fresh tears . Mrs. Berry paused , disturbed . "
175278	175282	175271	175271	he	9175	" she suggested . "
175289	175290	175286	175287	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
175458	175489	175493	175493	he	5156	" Lucy was willing to see comfort . She was weary of her self - inflicted martyrdom , and glad to give herself up to somebody else 's guidance utterly . "
175502	175503	175499	175500	Mrs. Berry	489	" "
175601	175618	175619	175619	I	0	" Here Mrs. Berry poured forth fresh sentences on matrimony , pointed especially at young couples . "
175633	175652	175653	175653	Lucy	132	" she confessed , ' so I 'll thank my Berry if I makes you wise in season . "
175714	175727	175729	175730	Mrs. Berry	489	" Well ! these 's three men in my life I kissed , "
175748	175830	175729	175730	Mrs. Berry	489	" three men , and one a nobleman ! He've got more whisker than my Berry , I wonder what the man thought . Ten to one he 'll think , now , I was glad o ' my chance they 're that vain , whether they 's lords or commons . How was I to know ? I nat'ral thinks none but her husband'd sit in that chair . Ha ! and in the dark ? and alone with ye ? "
175837	175867	175831	175832	Mrs. Berry	489	" and your husband away ? What do this mean ? Tell to me , child , what it mean his bein ' here alone without ere a candle ? "
175868	175879	175881	175881	Lucy	132	" Lord Mountfalcon is the only friend I have here , "
175883	175895	175881	175881	Lucy	132	" He is very kind . He comes almost every evening . "
175896	175903	175904	175905	Mrs. Berry	489	" Lord Montfalcon that his name ! "
175908	175979	175904	175905	Mrs. Berry	489	" I been that flurried by the man , I did n't mind it at first . He come every evenin ' , and your husband out o ' sight ! My goodness me ! it 's gettin ' worse and worse . And what do he come for , now , ma'am ? Now tell me candid what ye do together here in the dark of an evenin ' . "
175985	176003	176005	176005	Lucy	132	" O Mrs. Berry ! please not to speak in that way I do n't like it , "
176009	176019	176005	176005	Lucy	132	" What do he come for , I ask ? "
176020	176052	175904	175905	Mrs. Berry	489	" Because he is kind , Mrs. Berry . He sees me very lonely , and wishes to amuse me . And he tells me of things I know nothing about and "
176053	176069	176070	176071	Mrs. Berry	489	" And wants to be a - teachin ' some of his things , mayhap , "
176078	176091	176093	176093	Lucy	132	" You are a very ungenerous , suspicious , naughty old woman , "
176098	176110	176111	176112	Mrs. Berry	489	" And you 're a silly , unsuspectin ' little bird , "
176124	176144	176116	176116	she	489	" You have n't told me what ye do together , and what 's his excuse for comin ' . "
176145	176189	176070	176071	Mrs. Berry	489	" Well , then , Mrs. Berry , almost every evening that he comes we read History , and he explains the battles , and talks to me about the great men . And he says I 'm not silly , Mrs. Berry . "
176190	176255	176116	176116	she	489	" That 's one bit o ' lime on your wings , my bird . History , indeed ! History to a young married lovely woman alone in the dark ! a pretty History ! Why , I know that man 's name , my dear . He 's a notorious living rake , that Lord Montfalcon . No woman 's safe with him . "
176256	176277	176116	176116	she	489	" Ah , but he has n't deceived me , Mrs. Berry . He has not pretended he was good . "
176278	176284	176070	176071	Mrs. Berry	489	" More 's his art , "
176290	176303	176070	176071	Mrs. Berry	489	" So you read History together in the dark ; my dear ! "
176304	176369	176116	176116	she	489	" I was unwell to - night , Mrs. Berry . I wanted him not to see my face . Look ! there 's the book open ready for him when the candles come in . And now , you dear kind darling old thing , let me kiss you for coming to me . I do love you . Talk of other things . "
176370	176375	176377	176378	Mrs. Berry	489	" So we will , "
176385	176459	176377	176378	Mrs. Berry	489	" So let us . A nobleman , indeed , alone with a young wife in the dark , and she sich a beauty ! I say this shall be put a stop to now and henceforth , on the spot it shall ! He wo n't meneuvele Bessy Berry with his arts . There ! I drop him . I 'm dyin ' for a cup o ' tea , my dear . "
176484	176526	176470	176471	Mrs. Berry	489	" Let him go and boast I kiss him ; he ai n't nothin' to be ' shamed of in a chaste woman 's kiss unawares which men do n't get too often in their lives , I can assure 'em ; "
176557	176563	176564	176564	she	489	" Oh , you blessed ! "
176571	176583	176564	176564	she	489	" you good , lovin' , proper little wife , you ! "
176584	176592	176594	176594	Lucy	132	" What is it , Mrs. Berry ! "
176603	176638	176639	176640	Mrs. Berry	489	" As if I could n't see , you pet ! It was my flurry blinded me , or I 'd ' a marked ye the fast shock . Thinkin ' to deceive me ! "
176668	176675	176677	176679	the soft woman	9473	" You 're a sweet one , "
176689	176717	176718	176718	she	9473	" You 're a rose , you are ! and a bud on your stalk . Have n't told a word to your husband , my dear ? "
176732	176776	176777	176777	Lucy	132	" That 's right . We 'll give him a surprise ; let it come all at once on him , and thinks he losin ' breath ' I 'm a father ! ' Nor a hint even you have n't give him ? "
176789	176798	176800	176801	Bessy Berry	354	" Oh ! you are a sweet one , "
176860	177034	176856	176856	she	489	" Now this right everything a baby in the balance ! Now I say this angel - infant come from on high . It 's God 's messenger , my love ! and it 's not wrong to say so . He thinks you worthy , or you would n't ' a had one not for all the tryin ' in the world , you would n't , and some tries hard enough , poor creatures ! Now let us rejice and make merry ! I 'm for cryin ' and laughin ' , one and the same . This is the blessed seal of matrimony , which Berry never stamp on me . It 's be hoped it 's a boy . Make that man a grandfather , and his grandchild a son , and you got him safe . Oh ! this is what I call happiness , and I 'll have my tea a little stronger in consequence . I declare I could get tipsy to know this joyful news . "
177072	177087	177069	177069	Lucy	132	" Now you know why I read History , and that sort of books . "
177088	177092	177094	177094	Berry	489	" Do I ? "
177096	177172	177094	177094	Berry	489	" Belike I do . Since what you done 's so good , my darlin ' , I 'm agreeable to anything . A fig for all the lords ! They ca n't come anigh a baby . You may read Voyages and Travels , my dear , and Romances , and Tales of Love and War . You cut the riddle in your own dear way , and that 's all I cares for . "
177173	177182	177184	177184	Lucy	132	" No , but you do n't understand , "
177186	177220	177184	177184	Lucy	132	" I only read sensible books , and talk of serious things , because I 'm sure ... because I have heard say ... dear Mrs. Berry ! do n't you understand now ? "
177227	177433	177221	177222	Mrs. Berry	489	" Only to think of her bein ' that thoughtful ! and she a Catholic , too ! Never tell me that people of one religion ai n't as good as another , after that . Why , you want to make him a historian , to be sure ! And that rake of a lord who 've been comin ' here playin ' at wolf , you been and made him unbeknown to himself sort o ' tutor to the unborn blessed ! Ha ! ha ! say that little women ai n't got art ekal to the cunningest of 'em . Oh ! I understand . Why , to be sure , did n't I know a lady , a widow of a clergyman : he was a postermost child , and afore his birth that women read nothin' but Blair 's ' Grave ' over and over again , from the end to the beginnin ' ; that 's a serious book ! very hard readin ' ! and at four years of age that child that come of it reelly was the piousest infant ! he was like a little curate . His eyes was up ; he talked so solemn . "
177447	177457	177434	177435	Mrs. Berry	489	" So she got her wish , for one ! "
177482	177500	177502	177503	Mrs. Berry	489	" If it 's not dreadful to ye , my sweet , sleepin ' beside a woman , "
177505	177563	177502	177503	Mrs. Berry	489	" I know it were to me shortly after my Berry , and I felt it . It do n't somehow seem nat'ral after matrimony a woman in your bed ! I was obliged to have somebody , for the cold sheets do give ye the creeps when you 've been used to that that 's different . "
177614	177624	177625	177625	she	489	" You been guessing a boy woman - like , "
177737	177802	177803	177803	Berry	489	" I never see ye like this , but I 'm half in love with ye myself , you blushin ' beauty ! Sweet 's your eyes , and your hair do take one so lyin ' back . I 'd never forgive my father if he kep me away from ye four - and - twenty hours just . Husband o ' that ! "
177812	177849	177803	177803	Berry	489	" Ye look so ripe with kisses , and there they are a - languishin ' ! ... You never look so but in your bed , ye beauty ! just as it ought to be . "
177987	177993	177985	177985	Lucy	132	" Peepy , dear Berry , "
178787	178791	178793	178794	the lady	990	" At last ! "
178834	178840	178842	178843	the baronet	609	" If he had gone , "
178845	178856	178842	178843	the baronet	609	" he would have anticipated me by a few hours . "
178974	178977	178979	178980	the baronet	609	" If , "
178982	179034	178979	178980	the baronet	609	" this person , his wife , is what you paint her , I do not share your fears for him . I think too well of him . If she is one to inspire the sacredness of that union , I think too well of him . It is impossible . "
179044	179050	179051	179051	she	990	" Call her to you , "
179054	179112	179051	179051	she	990	" Have her with you at Raynham . Recognize her . It is the disunion and doubt that so confuses him and drives him wild . I confess to you I hoped he had gone to her . It seems not . If she is with you his way will be clear . Will you do that ? "
179144	179166	179167	179167	He	130	" We shall see her there in time , Emmeline . At present let it be between me and my son . "
179249	179314	179245	179245	He	130	" During your absence , sir , I have taken the liberty , without consulting you , to do something in which you are more deeply concerned than myself . I have taken upon myself to find out my mother and place her under my care . I trust you will not think I have done wrong . I acted as I thought best . "
179319	179361	179315	179316	Sir Austin	130	" You are of an age , Richard , to judge for yourself in such a case . I would have you simply beware of deceiving yourself in imagining that you considered any one but yourself in acting as you did . "
179362	179371	179373	179373	Richard	489	" I have not deceived myself , sir , "
179459	179467	179469	179476	the very just man of science in life	5249	" This rash marriage has altered him , "
179482	179488	179489	179489	He	2387	" it has debased him . "
179494	179550	179489	179489	He	2387	" I see in him the desperate maturity of a suddenly - ripened nature : and but for my faith that good work is never lost , what should I think of the toil of my years ? Lost , perhaps to me ! lost to him ! It may show itself in his children . "
180099	180112	180096	180097	Mrs. Berry	489	" Twon't hurt her if she go into his arms head foremost . "
180209	180220	180172	180172	she	489	" What you ate makes you cry , Mrs. Berry ? "
180221	180225	180226	180227	Mrs. Berry	489	" It 's all "
180236	180250	180259	180259	she	489	" it 's all stomach , my dear . Do n't ye mind , "
180269	180279	180281	180282	Sir Austin	186	" You have a singular manner with old ladies , "
180306	180314	180297	180297	She	132	" Are you ill , my son ? "
180402	180409	180392	180392	He	346	" Are you ill , Richard ? "
180417	180426	180428	180428	Richard	186	" Come on , sir ! come on ! "
180475	180486	180487	180488	Sir Austin	186	" Richard will go to his wife to - morrow , "
180548	180556	180545	180545	Adrian	346	" That was his wife , sir . "
180658	180664	180644	180644	He	186	" Richard is very gay , "
180672	180683	180684	180684	he	186	" All will be right with him to - morrow , "
180737	180754	180756	180757	Mrs. Doria	138	" I notice he has rather a wild laugh I do n't exactly like his eyes , "
180759	180771	180772	180775	the man of science	5257	" You will see a change in him to - morrow , "
180872	180939	180866	180866	he	5257	" My dear Richard ! it was my intention that we should come to an understanding together this night . But the time is short poor Helen can not spare many minutes . Let me then say that you deceived me , and that I forgive you . We fix our seal on the past . You will bring your wife to me when you return . "
180955	180967	180969	180969	Richard	186	" Will you have her at Raynham at once , sir ? "
180971	180982	180969	180969	Richard	186	" Yes , my son , when you bring her . "
180983	180991	180866	180866	he	5257	" Are you mocking me , sir ? "
180992	181000	180969	180969	Richard	186	" Pray , what do you mean ? "
181001	181011	180969	180969	Richard	186	" I ask you to receive her at once . "
181012	181037	180866	180866	he	5257	" Well ! the delay can not be long . I do not apprehend that you will be kept from your happiness many days . "
181038	181049	181051	181051	Richard	186	" I think it will be some time , sir ! "
181056	181077	181051	181051	Richard	186	" And what mental freak is this that can induce you to postpone it and play with your first duty ? "
181078	181087	180866	180866	he	5257	" What is my first duty , sir ? "
181088	181100	181051	181051	Richard	186	" Since you are married , to be with your wife . "
181101	181113	181115	181115	Richard	489	" I have heard that from an old woman called Berry ! "
181123	181131	181132	181132	he	186	" Will you receive her at once ? "
181211	181222	181208	181208	He	609	" Before you return , I demur to receiving her . "
181223	181229	181238	181238	he	772	" Very well , sir , "
181243	181257	181258	181259	the baronet	609	" Really you tempt me to fancy you already regret your rash proceeding ! "
181307	181311	181288	181288	he	609	" Do you ? "
181312	181318	181297	181297	he	609	" Regret it , sir ? "
181365	181369	181370	181371	his father	775	" Do you ? "
181374	181384	181389	181389	he	775	" You tempt me I almost fear you do . "
181405	181483	181389	181389	he	775	" Ask me what I think of her , sir ! Ask me what she is ! Ask me what it is to have taken one of God 's precious angels and chained her to misery ! Ask me what it is to have plunged a sword into her heart , and to stand over her and see such a creature bleeding ! Do I regret that ? Why , yes , I do ! Would you ? "
181532	181546	181547	181547	he	186	" Tell me why you passed by her as you did this afternoon , "
181559	181570	181547	181547	he	186	" I passed her because I could not do otherwise . "
181571	181577	181547	181547	he	186	" Your wife , Richard ? "
181578	181584	181547	181547	he	186	" Yes ! my wife ! "
181585	181594	181547	181547	he	186	" If she had seen you , Richard ? "
181595	181601	181547	181547	he	186	" God spared her that ! "
181683	181701	181677	181679	the wise youth	746	" Somebody has kissed him , sir , and the chaste boy ca n't get over it . "
181750	181760	181761	181761	he	346	" I may have been wrong in one thing , "
181774	181791	181761	181761	he	346	" I , perhaps , was wrong in allowing him so much liberty during his probation . "
181804	181814	181815	181815	His	5323	" Yes , yes ; that is on me . "
181878	181893	181895	181896	the baronet	609	" That child 's mind has disease in it ... She is not sound , "
181950	181961	181963	181964	the baronet	609	" Well ' ma'am , you have something to say , "
181973	181979	181967	181967	she	489	" Wishin ' I had n't "
182000	182067	181980	181981	Mrs. Berry	489	" I dare say , Sir Austin , you do n't remember me , and I little thought when last we parted our meeting 'd be like this . Twenty year do n't go over one without showin ' it , no more than twenty ox . It 's a might o ' time , twenty year ! Leastways not quite twenty , it ai n't . "
182068	182074	182075	182075	Adrian	346	" Round figures are best , "
182078	182097	182099	182100	Mrs. Berry	489	" In them round figures a be - loved son have growed up , and got himself married ! "
182150	182207	182208	182208	Adrian	346	" He came to my house , Sir Austin , a stranger ! If twenty year alters us as have knowed each other on the earth , how must they alter they that we parted with just come from heaven ! And a heavenly babe he were ! so sweet ! so strong ! so fat ! "
182225	182324	182212	182213	Mrs. Berry	489	" I wished afore I spoke to say how thankful am I bound to be for my pension not cut short , as have offended so , but that I know Sir Austin Feverel , Raynham Abbey , ai n't one o ' them that likes to hear their good deeds pumlished . And a pension to me now , it 's something more than it were . For a pension and pretty rosy cheeks in a maid , which I was that 's a bait many a man'll bite , that wo n't so a forsaken wife ! "
182325	182342	182343	182344	the baronet	609	" If you will speak to the point , ma'am , I will listen to you , "
182348	182516	182343	182344	the baronet	609	" It 's the beginnin ' that 's the worst , and that 's over , thank the Lord ! So I 'll speak , Sir Austin , and say my say : Lord speed me ! Believin ' our idees o ' matrimony to be sim'lar , then , I 'll say , once married married for life ! Yes ! I do n't even like widows . For I ca n't stop at the grave . Not at the tomb I ca n't stop . My husband 's my husband , and if I 'm a body at the Resurrection , I say , speaking humbly , my Berry is the husband o ' my body ; and to think of two claimin ' of me then it makes me hot all over . Such is my notion of that state ' tween man and woman . No givin ' in marriage , o ' course I know ; and if so I 'm single . "
182523	182535	182343	182344	the baronet	609	" Really , my good woman , you wander very much . "
182536	182727	182728	182729	Sir Austin	130	" Beggin ' pardon , Sir Austin ; but I has my point before me all the same , and I 'm comin ' to it . Ac - knowledgin ' our error , it 'd done , and bein ' done , it 's writ aloft . Oh ! if you ony knew what a sweet young creature she be ! Indeed ; ' taint all of humble birth that 's unworthy , Sir Austin . And she got her idees , too : She reads History ! She talk that sensible as would surprise ye . But for all that she 's a prey to the artful o ' men unpertected . And it 's a young marriage but there 's no fear for her , as far as she go . The fear 's t'other way . There 's that in a man at the commencement which make of him Lord knows what if you any way interferes : whereas a woman bides quiet ! It 's consolation catch her , which is what we mean by seduein ' . Whereas a man he 's a savage ! "
182743	182766	182734	182734	Adrian	346	" Well , ma'am , I see you have something in your mind , if you would only come to it quickly . "
182767	183110	183114	183114	her	5337	" Then here 's my point , Sir Austin . I say you bred him so as there ai n't another young gentleman like him in England , and proud he make me . And as for her , I 'll risk sayin ' it 's done , and no harm you might search England through , and nowhere will ye find a maid that 's his match like his own wife . Then there they be . Are they together as should be ? O Lord no ! Months they been divided . Then she all lonely and exposed , I went , and fetched her out of seducers ' ways which they may say what they like , but the inn'cent is most open to when they 're healthy and confidin ' I fetch her , and the liberty boxed her safe in my own house . So much for that sweet ! That you may do with women . But it 's him Mr. Richard I am bold , I know , but there I 'm in for it , and the Lord'll help me ! It 's him , Sir Austin , in this great metropolis , warm from a young marriage . It 's him , and I say nothin' of her , and how sweet she bears it , and it 's eating her at a time when Natur ' should have no other trouble but the one that 's goin' on it 's him , and I ask so bold shall there and a Christian gentlemen his father shall there be a tug ' tween him as a son and him as a husband soon to be somethin' else ? I speak bold out I 'd have sons obey their fathers , but a priest 's words spoke over them , which they 're now in my ears , I say I ai n't a doubt on earth I 'm sure there ai n't one in heaven which dooty 's the holier of the two . "
183190	183202	183204	183205	Mrs. Berry	489	" One gets so addle - gated thinkin ' many things , "
183209	183241	183204	183205	Mrs. Berry	489	" That 's why we see wonder clever people goin' wrong to my mind . I think it 's al'ays the plan in a dielemmer to pray God and walk forward . "
183334	183371	183326	183326	He	609	" My son has gone out of town to see his cousin , who is ill . He will return in two or three days , and then they will both come to me at Raynham . "
183391	183405	183406	183406	she	489	" He pass her like a stranger in the park this evenin ' , "
183409	183412	183414	183415	the baronet	609	" Ah ? "
183417	183433	183414	183415	the baronet	609	" Yes , well ! they will be at Raynham before the week is over . "
183441	183464	183434	183435	Mrs. Berry	489	" Not of his own accord he pass that sweet young wife of his like a stranger this day , Sir Austin ! "
183465	183477	183478	183479	Mrs. Berry	489	" I must beg you not to intrude further , ma'am . "
183491	183499	183500	183500	she	489	" All 's well that ends well , "
183505	183538	183500	183500	she	489	" It 's just bad inquirin ' too close among men . We must take 'em somethin' like Providence as they come . Thank heaven ! I kep ' back the baby . "
183564	183577	183579	183580	the baronet	609	" I think I have not met a better in my life , "
183779	183811	183773	183773	she	5348	" I beg of my husband , and all kind people who may have the care of me between this and the grave , to bury me with my hands untouched . "
183977	183981	183972	183972	she	6590	" Read this , "
184016	184020	184021	184021	she	6590	" Tell me , "
184024	184048	184021	184021	she	6590	" tell me what you think . John must not hear of it . I have nobody to consult but you O Richard ! "
184049	184052	184006	184006	She	6590	" My Diary "
184078	184135	184075	184075	his	5358	" Richard 's fourteenth birthday . I have worked him a purse and put it under his pillow , because he is going to have plenty of money . He does not notice me now because he has a friend now , and he is ugly , but Richard is not , and never will be . "
184192	184251	184173	184173	she	5363	" We went into the fields and gathered cowslips together , and pelted each other , and I told him he used to call them ' coals - sleeps ' when he was a baby , and he was angry at my telling him , for he does not like to be told he was ever a baby . "
184298	184391	184294	184294	He	5358	" Mama says there is no one in the world like Richard , and I am sure there is not , not in the whole world . He says he is going to be a great General and going to the wars . If he does I shall dress myself as a boy and go after him , and he will not know me till I am wounded . Oh I pray he will never , never be wounded . I wonder what I should feel if Richard was ever to die . "
184398	184454	184392	184393	Upstairs Clare	562	" Lady Blandish said there was a likeness between Richard and me . Richard said I hope I do not hang down my head as she does . He is angry with me because I do not look people in the face and speak out , but I know I am not looking after earthworms . "
184481	184486	184489	184489	themselves	5367	" Richard kissed me , "
184524	184550	184509	184509	He	5365	" Thy truth to me is truer Than horse , or dog , or blade ; Thy vows to me are fewer Than ever maiden made .
184574	184581	184584	184584	he	5365	" All the verses were transcribed . "
184591	184598	184600	184601	his lady	5370	" Clare explained at the close , "
184617	184631	184611	184611	her	5372	" It came to that period when Clare left Raynham with her mother . "
184790	184892	184786	184788	Richard Doria Feverel	127	" His breast rose convulsively . Clare Doria Forey ! He knew the music of that name . He had heard it somewhere . It sounded faint and mellow now behind the hills of death . He could not read for tears . It was midnight . The hour seemed to belong to her . The awful stillness and the darkness were Clare 's . Clare 's voice clear and cold from the grave possessed it . Painfully , with blinded eyes , he looked over the breathless pages . She spoke of his marriage , and her finding the ring . "
185029	185056	185027	185027	God	176	" Then she spoke of her own marriage , and that it was her duty to obey her mother . A blank in the Diary ensued . "
185066	185100	185062	185062	Richard	127	" was the next entry . But now as he read his eyes were fixed , and the delicate feminine handwriting like a black thread drew on his soul to one terrible conclusion . "
185155	185158	185159	185159	I	0	" Further : "
185245	185299	185242	185242	I	0	" Richard laid the book open on the table . Phantom surges seemed to be mounting and travelling for his brain . Had Clare taken his wild words in earnest ? Did she lie there dead he shrouded the thought . He wrapped the thoughts in shrouds , but he was again reading . "
185430	185454	185459	185459	Richard	127	" I have written to his father to make him happy . Perhaps when I am dead he will hear what I say . "
185493	185517	185488	185488	I	0	" The words were written larger , and staggered towards the close , as if her hand had lost mastery over the pen . "
185632	185660	185626	185626	God	176	" It is past two o'clock . The sheep are bleating outside . It must be very cold in the ground . Good - bye , Richard . "
185938	185941	185942	185942	she	6590	" Richard , "
185945	185998	185942	185942	she	6590	" the worst is over for me . I have no one to love but you , dear . We have all been fighting against God , and this ... Richard ! you will come with me , and be united to your wife , and spare my brother what I suffer . "
186005	186111	185999	185999	He	5405	" I have killed one . She sees me as I am . I can not go with you to my wife , because I am not worthy to touch her hand , and were I to go , I should do this to silence my self - contempt . Go you to her , and when she asks of me , say I have a death upon my head that No ! say that I am abroad , seeking for that which shall cleanse me . If I find it I shall come to claim her . If not , God help us all ! "
186161	186198	186156	186156	Adrian	346	" Do you want to try my nerves , my dear fellow ? I 'm not a man of fashion , happily , or you would have struck the seat of them . How are you ? "
186235	186333	186334	186334	Austin	150	" The Whigs have given up the ghost , my dear Austin . The free Briton is to receive Liberty 's pearl , the Ballot . The Aristocracy has had a cycle 's notice to quit . The Monarchy and old Madeira are going out ; Demos and Cape wines are coming in . They call it Reform . So , you see , your absence has worked wonders . Depart for another five years , and you will return to ruined stomachs , cracked sconces , general upset , an equality made perfect by universal prostration . "
186341	186354	186334	186334	Austin	150	" I want to hear about ourselves . How is old Ricky ? "
186355	186560	186334	186334	Austin	150	" You know of his what do they call it when greenhorns are licensed to jump into the milkpails of dairymaids ? a very charming little woman she makes , by the way presentable ! quite old Anacreon 's rose in milk . Well ! everybody thought the System must die of it . Not a bit . It continued to flourish in spite . It 's in a consumption now , though emaciated , lean , raw , spectral ! I 've this morning escaped from Raynham to avoid the sight of it . I have brought our genial uncle Hippias to town a delightful companion ! I said to him : ' We 've had a fine Spring . ' ' Ugh ! ' he answers , ' there 's a time when you come to think the Spring old . ' You should have heard how he trained out the ' old . ' I felt something like decay in my sap just to hear him . In the prize - fight of life , my dear Austin , our uncle Hippias has been unfairly hit below the belt . Let 's guard ourselves there , and go and order dinner . "
186561	186574	186576	186576	Austin	150	" But where 's Ricky now , and what is he doing ? "
186578	186595	186576	186576	Austin	150	" Ask what he has done . The miraculous boy has gone and got a baby ! "
186596	186604	186605	186605	Austin	150	" A child ? Richard has one ? "
186613	186720	186605	186605	Austin	150	" I suppose it 's not common among your tropical savages . He has one : one as big as two . That has been the death - blow to the System . It bore the marriage the baby was too much for it . Could it swallow the baby , ' twould live . She , the wonderful woman , has produced a large boy . I assure you it 's quite amusing to see the System opening its mouth every hour of the day , trying to gulp him down , aware that it would be a consummate cure , or a happy release . "
186734	186741	186742	186742	he	150	" How has Ricky turned out ? "
186745	186754	186742	186742	he	150	" What sort of a character has he ? "
186755	187011	186605	186605	Austin	150	" The poor boy is ruined by his excessive anxiety about it . Character ? he has the character of a bullet with a treble charge of powder behind it . Enthusiasm is the powder . That boy could get up an enthusiasm for the maiden days of Ops ! He was going to reform the world , after your fashion , Austin , you have something to answer for . Unfortunately he began with the feminine side of it . Cupid proud of Phoebus newly slain , or Pluto wishing to people his kingdom , if you like , put it into the soft head of one of the guileless grateful creatures to kiss him for his good work . Oh , horror ! he never expected that . Conceive the System in the flesh , and you have our Richard . The consequence is , that this male Peri refuses to enter his Paradise , though the gates are open for him , the trumpets blow , and the fair unspotted one awaits him fruitful within . We heard of him last that he was trying the German waters preparatory to his undertaking the release of Italy from the subjugation of the Teuton . Let 's hope they 'll wash him . He is in the company of Lady Judith Felle your old friend , the ardent female Radical who married the decrepit to carry out her principles . They always marry English lords , or foreign princes : I admire their tactics . "
187012	187034	187036	187036	Austin	485	" Judith is bad for him in such a state . I like her , but she was always too sentimental , "
187038	187107	187036	187036	Austin	485	" Sentiment made her marry the old lord , I suppose ? I like her for her sentiment , Austin . Sentimental people are sure to live long and die fat . Feeling , that 's the slayer , coz . Sentiment ! ' tis the cajolery of existence : the soft bloom which whoso weareth , he or she is enviable . Would that I had more ! "
187108	187117	187036	187036	Austin	485	" You 're not much changed , Adrian . "
187118	187127	187036	187036	Austin	485	" I 'm not a Radical , Austin . "
187187	187194	187196	187198	the wise youth	746	" We 're in a tangle , "
187200	187218	187196	187198	the wise youth	746	" Time will extricate us , I presume , or what is the venerable signor good for ? "
187233	187243	187245	187245	Adrian	346	" We 'll go to her by and by , "
187247	187256	187258	187258	Austin	485	" I shall go and see her now , "
187260	187274	187258	187258	Austin	485	" Well , we 'll go and order the dinner first , coz . "
187275	187281	187196	187198	the wise youth	746	" Give me her address . "
187282	187296	187297	187297	Adrian	346	" Really , Austin , you carry matters with too long a beard , "
187300	187309	187310	187310	he	346	" Do n't you care what you eat ? "
187318	187348	187310	187310	he	346	" I daresay not . A slice out of him that 's handy sauce du ciel ! Go , batten on the baby , cannibal . Dinner at seven . "
187450	187455	187456	187456	she	5420	" There he is ! "
187467	187474	187456	187456	she	5420	" There 's my stranger come ! "
187512	187517	187507	187507	her	573	" Come at last ! "
187545	187606	187534	187534	she	573	" I expected to see her comin ' home , Mr. Wentworth . Every day twice a day she go out to give her blessed angel an airing . No leavin ' the child with nursemaids for her ! She is a mother ! and good milk , too , thank the Lord ! though her heart 's so low . "
187633	187648	187649	187649	she	573	" Although I 'd swear you do n't wear it for ornament , now ! "
187706	187712	187713	187713	he	150	" I am Austin Wentworth , "
187734	187740	187741	187741	She	132	" Your name is Lucy ? "
187746	187756	187741	187741	She	132	" And mine is Austin , as you know . "
187807	187816	187818	187819	Mrs. Berry	489	" Ai n't he a lusty darlin ' ? "
187821	187863	187865	187865	she	489	" Ai n't he like his own father ? There ca n't be no doubt about zoo , zoo pitty pet . Look at his fists . Ai n't he got passion ? Ai n't he a splendid roarer ? Oh ! "
187916	187924	187926	187927	Mrs. Berry	489	" She might a done it here , "
187929	188109	187926	187927	Mrs. Berry	489	" There 's no prettier sight , I say . If her dear husband could but see that ! He 's off in his heroics he want to be doin' all sorts o ' things : I say he 'll never do anything grander than that baby . You should ' a seen her uncle over that baby he came here , for I said , you shall see your own family , my dear , and so she thinks . He come , and he laughed over that baby in the joy of his heart , poor man ! he cried , he did . You should see that Mr. Thompson , Mr. Wentworth a friend o ' Mr. Richard 's , and a very modest - minded young gentleman he worships her in his innocence . It 's a sight to see him with that baby . My belief is he 's unhappy 'cause he ca n't anyways be nurse - maid to him . O Mr. Wentworth ! what do you think of her , sir ? "
188179	188186	188188	188189	Mrs. Berry	489	" He do n't speak much , "
188191	188226	188227	188227	Lucy	132	" but I see by his eye he mean a deal . He ai n't one o ' yer long - word gentry , who 's all gay deceivers , every one of 'em . "
188236	188271	188227	188227	Lucy	132	" I wonder what he thinks of me , Mrs. Berry ? I could not speak to him . I loved him before I saw him . I knew what his face was like . "
188272	188291	188293	188294	Mrs. Berry	489	" He looks proper even with a beard , and that 's a trial for a virtuous man , "
188296	188372	188293	188294	Mrs. Berry	489	" One sees straight through the hair with him . Think ! he 'll think what any man'd think you a - suckin spite o ' all your sorrow , my sweet , and my Berry talkin ' of his Roman matrons ! here 's a English wife'll match 'em all ! that 's what he thinks . And now that leetle dark under yer eye'll clear , my darlin ' , now he've come . "
188475	188483	188470	188471	Mrs. Berry	489	" Three cups I goes no further , "
188516	188529	188530	188530	Lucy	132	" I mean , can you start at a minute 's notice ? "
188537	188540	188530	188530	Lucy	132	" Yes , "
188554	188559	188550	188550	she	132	" luggage - woman . "
188560	188571	188572	188572	Austin	186	" There used to be a train at seven o'clock , "
188585	188600	188601	188601	Austin	186	" Could you get ready to come with me to Raynham in ten minutes ? "
188635	188640	188641	188641	she	132	" Joy and deliverance ! "
188648	188653	188641	188641	she	132	" Will you come ? "
188671	188674	188668	188668	she	132	" Yes . "
188691	188703	188675	188676	Mrs. Berry	489	" She 's thinking what 's to be done with baby . "
188704	188711	188713	188713	Austin	186	" He must learn to travel , "
188715	188718	188720	188721	Mrs. Berry	489	" Oh ! "
188723	188775	188776	188776	She	132	" and I 'll be his nuss , and bear him , a sweet ! Oh ! and think of it ! me nurse - maid once more at Raynham Abbey ! but it 's nurse - woman now , you must say . Let us be goin' on the spot . "
188823	188830	188831	188831	she	132	" I will be dressed instantly , "
188874	188881	188882	188882	she	489	" He 'll sleep it through , "
188885	188909	188882	188882	she	489	" He 's had enough for an alderman , and goes to sleep sound after his dinner , he do , a duck ! "
188929	188936	188921	188921	She	132	" One moment , Mr. Wentworth ? "
188937	188941	188943	188943	Austin	150	" Just two , "
188963	188977	188956	188956	her	132	" She thinks she is never to see him again , Mr. Wentworth . "
188978	188982	188983	188983	Austin	150	" She shall , "
189013	189022	189024	189024	her	132	" I do hope baby will not wake , "
189028	189031	189033	189036	nurse - woman Berry	5452	" He ! "
189042	189092	189033	189036	nurse - woman Berry	5452	" his little tum - tum 's as tight as he can hold , a pet ! a lamb ! a bird ! a beauty ! and ye may take yer oath he never wakes till that 's slack . He've got character of his own , a blessed ! "
189162	189170	189149	189149	he	609	" Glad to see you , Austin . "
189269	189279	189280	189280	he	150	" I have brought Richard 's wife , sir , "
189397	189409	189411	189412	the baronet	609	" What aspect do you like for your bedroom ? East ? "
189420	189426	189411	189412	the baronet	609	" Am I to stay ? "
189427	189440	189441	189441	he	609	" Perhaps you had better take to Richard 's room at once , "
189444	189464	189465	189465	Lucy	132	" You have the Lobourne valley there and a good morning air , and will feel more at home . "
189483	189489	189470	189471	Mrs. Berry	489	" The day is ours ! "
189503	189509	189511	189511	Austin	186	" Lucy is rather tired , "
189538	189545	189546	189546	he	609	" But have you come alone ? "
189595	189606	189607	189607	Austin	186	" By the way , what is he to me ? "
189621	189633	189607	189607	Austin	186	" My relationship is not so defined as yours , sir . "
189664	189673	189674	189674	Austin	186	" I really think he 's like Richard , "
189686	189694	189695	189696	Mrs. Berry	489	" As like as one to one , "
189714	189764	189704	189704	she	489	" And he 's as healthy as his father was , Sir Austin spite o ' the might ' a beens . Reg'lar as the clock ! We never want a clock since he come . We knows the hour o ' the day , and of the night . "
189765	189774	189775	189776	the baronet	609	" You nurse him yourself , of course ? "
189816	189826	189828	189829	Mrs. Berry	489	" ' T'd take a deal to do that , "
189875	189880	189882	189883	the baronet	609	" He looks healthy , "
189885	189895	189882	189883	the baronet	609	" but I am not a judge of babies . "
189946	189954	189942	189943	The baronet	609	" She is extremely well - looking . "
189958	189967	189955	189955	He	609	" A person you take to at once . "
190044	190057	190038	190038	Her	489	" My dear ! tell me candid , how do I look ? "
190058	190080	190038	190038	Her	489	" Very nice indeed , Mrs. Berry ; but could you have believed he would be so kind , so considerate ? "
190081	190090	190092	190093	Mrs. Berry	489	" I am sure I looked a frump , "
190095	190112	190092	190093	Mrs. Berry	489	" Oh dear ! two birds at a shot . What do you think , now ? "
190113	190122	190124	190124	Lucy	132	" I never saw so wonderful a likeness , "
190126	190133	190124	190124	Lucy	132	" Likeness ! look at me . "
190144	190158	190134	190135	Mrs. Berry	489	" You 're very feverish , dear Berry . What can it be ? "
190159	190176	190092	190093	Mrs. Berry	489	" Ai n't it like the love - flutters of a young gal , my dear . "
190177	190186	190188	190188	Lucy	132	" Go to bed , Berry , dear , "
190197	190218	190188	190188	Lucy	132	" I will undress you , and see to you , dear heart ! You 've had so much excitement . "
190219	190224	190225	190225	Berry	489	" Ha ! ha ! "
190274	190279	190284	190285	Mrs. Berry	489	" Lucy was astonished . "

190967	190968	190957	190957	He	5510	" "
190986	191054	190974	190974	I	0	" Mrs. Berry ejaculated . Lucy had left the room . On the landing outside the door Lucy met a lady dressed in black , who stopped her and asked if she was Richard 's wife , and kissed her , passing from her immediately . Lucy despatched a message for Austin , and related the Berry history . Austin sent for the great man and said : "
191063	191125	191126	191126	He	5516	" Before Berry had time to draw himself up to enunciate his longest , he was requested to step upstairs , and as his young mistress at once led the way , Berry could not refuse to put his legs in motion and carry the stately edifice aloft . Of the interview Mrs. Berry gave Lucy a slight sketch that night . "
191291	191318	191283	191283	I	0	" Lucy attributed it to his sense of shame at his conduct , and Mrs. Berry did her best to look on it in that light . "
191330	191340	191325	191325	you	5522	" she asked . Lucy said he had not . "
191350	191357	191347	191347	ye	5522	" was Mrs. Berry 's rejoinder . "
191380	191485	191375	191375	he	5516	" Like many other natural people , Mrs. Berry was only silly where her own soft heart was concerned . As she secretly anticipated , the baronet came into her room when all was quiet . She saw him go and bend over Richard the Second , and remain earnestly watching him . He then went to the half - opened door of the room where Lucy slept , leaned his ear a moment , knocked gently , and entered . Mrs. Berry heard low words interchanging within . She could not catch a syllable , yet she would have sworn to the context . "
191505	191517	191498	191499	a father	2078	" When Sir Austin passed out she was in a deep sleep .
192791	192797	192799	192799	she	485	" The time will come , "
192801	192808	192810	192810	he	186	" And I shall be ready , "
193148	193160	193128	193128	He	186	" Why ca n't you go to your wife , Richard ? "
193161	193175	193176	193176	He	186	" For a reason you would be the first to approve , Austin . "
193443	193448	193449	193449	Richard	186	" What a wopper ! "
193452	193461	193463	193463	Austin	186	" Well , that is a fine fellow , "
193465	193479	193463	193463	Austin	186	" but I do n't think he 's much bigger than your boy . "
193480	193491	193492	193492	Richard	186	" He 'll do for a nineteenth - century Arminius , "
193502	193509	193497	193497	he	186	" What was that you said ? "
193516	193527	193528	193528	Austin	485	" What have I said that deserves to be repeated ? "
193533	193539	193528	193528	Austin	485	" Richard has a son ? "
193540	193547	193557	193558	Lady Judith	485	" You did n't know it ? "
193548	193555	193557	193558	Lady Judith	485	" His modesty goes very far , "
193605	193608	193610	193611	Lady Judith	485	" Well ! "
193627	193635	193620	193620	Richard	186	" Austin ! you were in earnest ? "
193636	193645	193620	193620	Richard	186	" You did n't know it , Richard ? "
193646	193649	193620	193620	Richard	186	" No . "
193650	193676	193620	193620	Richard	186	" Why , they all wrote to you . Lucy wrote to you : your father , your aunt . I believe Adrian wrote too . "
193677	193684	193686	193686	Richard	186	" I tore up their letters , "
193688	193724	193686	193686	Richard	186	" He 's a noble fellow , I can tell you . You 've nothing to be ashamed of . He 'll soon be coming to ask about you . I made sure you knew . "
193725	193732	193733	193733	Richard	186	" No , I never knew . "
193741	193747	193733	193733	Richard	186	" What is he like ? "
193748	193765	193686	193686	Richard	186	" Well , he really is like you , but he has his mother 's eyes . "
193766	193770	193686	193686	Richard	186	" And she 's "
193771	193783	193733	193733	Richard	186	" Yes . I think the child has kept her well . "
193784	193791	193686	193686	Richard	186	" They 're both at Raynham ? "
193792	193795	193686	193686	Richard	186	" Both . "
193913	193917	193918	193918	he	186	" A father ! "
193924	193928	193918	193918	he	186	" a child ! "
195716	195728	195732	195732	his	186	" Woman 's reason is in the milk of her breasts , "
195804	195813	195814	195814	he	186	" Here my plan with Richard was false , "
195817	195836	195814	195814	he	186	" in presuming that anything save blind fortuity would bring him such a mate as he should have . "
195842	195847	195837	195837	He	186	" And has got ! "
195895	195905	195907	195907	Adrian	346	" I told you she could talk , sir , "
195909	195913	195915	195916	the baronet	609	" She thinks ! "
195980	195988	195989	195989	he	167	" It will do us no harm , "
196005	196100	195989	195989	he	167	" And he was content in musing on the parentage of the little cradled boy . A common sight for those who had the entry to the library was the baronet cherishing the hand of his daughter - in - law . So Richard was crossing the sea , and hearts at Raynham were beating quicker measures as the minutes progressed . That night he would be with them . Sir Austin gave Lucy a longer , warmer salute when she came down to breakfast in the morning . Mrs. Berry waxed thrice amorous . "
196113	196117	195989	195989	he	167	" she said . "
196139	196144	196131	196137	a baby over the bed - post	5710	" she appended seriously . "
196147	196183	196131	196137	a baby over the bed - post	5710	" Berry declared it to be , ' strange I feel none o ' this to my Berry now . All my feelin 's o ' love seem t'ave gone into you two sweet chicks . "
196290	196295	196296	196296	she	489	" Then , perhaps , "
196300	196313	196296	196296	she	489	" You see I ai n't so soft as you thought for . "
196314	196325	196327	196327	Lucy	132	" You 're a very unkind , vindictive old woman , "
196329	196334	196327	196327	Lucy	132	" Belike I am , "
196550	196562	196522	196522	Ripton	158	" She did not say a word against me , Rip ? "
196563	196601	196522	196522	Ripton	158	" Against you , Richard ! The moment she knew she was to be a mother , she thought of nothing but her duty to the child . She 's one who ca n't think of herself . "
196602	196612	196522	196522	Ripton	158	" You 've seen her at Raynham , Rip ? "
196613	196655	196522	196522	Ripton	158	" Yes , once . They asked me down . And your father 's so fond of her I 'm sure he thinks no woman like her , and he 's right . She is so lovely , and so good . "
197000	197136	197142	197142	You	5748	" I know you are in a rage with me because I would not consent to ruin you , you foolish fellow . What do you call it ? Going to that unpleasant place together . Thank you , my milliner is not ready yet , and I want to make a good appearance when I do go . I suppose I shall have to some day . Your health , Sir Richard . Now let me speak to you seriously . Go home to your wife at once . But I know the sort of fellow you are , and I must be plain with you . Did I ever say I loved you ? You may hate me as much as you please , but I will save you from being a fool . "
197610	197726	197727	197727	You	5774	" Now after this , I am quite sure you are too much of a man to stop away from her another moment . I have no more to say . I suppose we shall not see each other again , so good - bye , Dick ! I fancy I hear you cursing me . Why ca n't you feel like other men on the subject ? But if you were like the rest of them I should not have cared for you a farthing . I have not worn lilac since I saw you last . I 'll be buried in your colour , Dick . That will not offend you will it ? "
197758	197770	197771	197771	Adieu	585	" The first time you meet Brayder , cane him publicly . "
197822	197849	197850	197850	Richard	186	" May I eat dry bread to the day of my death if I took or ever will touch a scrap of their money . BELLA . "
197857	197863	197864	197864	he	186	" Jump into the cab , "
197869	197876	197864	197864	he	186	" Anything the matter , Richard ? "
197877	197880	197881	197882	The driver	5779	" No . "
197929	197936	197938	197938	Richard	186	" It 'd the right way , "
198020	198026	198028	198028	Richard	186	" Is Mountfalcon in town ? "
198048	198051	198040	198040	His	186	" Mount ? "
198060	198069	198052	198052	Brayder	495	" yes . He 's off this evening . "
198070	198076	198077	198077	Richard	186	" He is in town ? "
198082	198093	198077	198077	Richard	186	" I want to see him . Where is he ? "
198119	198128	198129	198129	he	186	" Want to see him ? What about ? "
198138	198143	198144	198144	he	186	" By the way , "
198148	198159	198160	198160	He	186	" we thought of putting your name down , Feverel . "
198166	198172	198160	198160	He	186	" What do you say ? "
198181	198184	198173	198173	Richard	186	" Hurry . "
198213	198226	198228	198228	Ripton	158	" What do you want to see Lord Mountfalcon for , Richard ? "
198230	198238	198239	198239	Richard	186	" I just want to see him , "
198312	198318	198306	198306	them	5794	" You wo n't do , "
198340	198380	198381	198381	Ripton	158	" Go down to Raynham , Ripton . Say I shall be there tonight certainly . Do n't bother me with questions . Drive off at once . Or wait . Get another cab . I 'll take this . "
198423	198430	198417	198418	some one	1594	" You are Feverel 's friend ? "
198493	198524	198485	198486	Lord Mountfalcon	486	" Feverel has insulted me grossly . I must meet him , of course . It 's a piece of infernal folly ! I suppose he is not quite mad ? "
198536	198540	198541	198541	My	0	" My lord . "
198545	198581	198541	198542	My lord	4284	" I am perfectly guiltless of offending him , as far as I know . In fact , I had a friendship for him . Is he liable to fits of this sort of thing ? "
198592	198598	198589	198589	Ripton	158	" Fits , my lord ? "
198599	198602	198604	198605	the other	933	" Ah ! "
198614	198624	198625	198625	Ripton	158	" You know nothing of this business , perhaps ? "
198631	198639	198627	198627	he	158	" Have you any influence with him ? "
198640	198654	198604	198605	the other	933	" Not much , my lord . Only now and then a little . "
198655	198663	198627	198627	he	158	" You are not in the Army ? "
198684	198691	198692	198692	he	158	" I will not detain you , "
198720	198729	198698	198698	Ripton	158	" It 's a duel , my lord ? "
198730	198754	198765	198765	Ripton	158	" No help for it , if his friends do n't shut him up in Bedlam between this and to - morrow morning . "
198791	198811	198769	198769	He	158	" A duel ! but he wo n't , my lord , he must n't fight , my lord . "
198812	198820	198822	198823	my lord	4284	" He must come on the ground , "
198837	198961	198962	198963	the nobleman	9444	" I went out of my way , sir , in speaking to you . I saw you from the window . Your friend is mad . Deuced methodical , I admit , but mad . I have particular reasons to wish not to injure the young man , and if an apology is to be got out of him when we 're on the ground , I 'll take it , and we 'll stop the damned scandal , if possible . You understand ? I 'm the insulted party , and I shall only require of him to use formal words of excuse to come to an amicable settlement . Let him just say he regrets it . Now , sir , "
199007	199036	198995	198995	you	0	" Mountfalcon rang the bell , and bowed him out . With this on his mind Ripton hurried down to those who were waiting in joyful trust at Raynham .
199199	199211	199212	199212	he	186	" Pray , put up that watch . Impatience serves nothing , "
199233	199241	199225	199225	Hippias	334	" It 's no nightmare , this ! "
199277	199283	199284	199285	the baronet	609	" What are you writing ? "
199313	199321	199323	199323	Adrian	346	" Do I disturb you , sir ? "
199325	199401	199323	199323	Adrian	346	" I am engaged on a portion of a Proposal for uniting the Empires and Kingdoms of Europe under one Paternal Head , on the model of the ever - to - be - admired and lamented Holy Roman . This treats of the management of Youths and Maids , and of certain magisterial functions connected therewith . ' It is decreed that these officers be all and every men of science , ' etc . "
199439	199451	199453	199454	Lady Blandish	489	" I fear we must give him up to - night , "
199456	199468	199469	199470	Sir Austin	186	" If he said he would come , he will come , "
199511	199523	199525	199525	Ripton	158	" He declared to me he would be certain to come , "
199581	199587	199588	199588	he	158	" What is the time ? "
199596	199605	199607	199607	Hippias	334	" Time for me to be in bed , "
199646	199658	199636	199637	Sir Austin	186	" You had better not come down again , my child . "
199666	199675	199676	199676	he	186	" Oblige me by retiring for the night , "
199693	199703	199704	199704	he	186	" This agitation will be bad for the child , "
199716	199732	199712	199713	Lady Blandish	489	" I think she might just as well have returned . She will not sleep . "
199733	199744	199712	199713	Lady Blandish	489	" She will control herself for the child 's sake . "
199745	199753	199712	199713	Lady Blandish	489	" You ask too much of her . "
199754	199760	199761	199761	he	186	" Of her , not , "
199779	199790	199769	199769	Hippies	586	" I 'm convinced my circulation gradually and steadily decreases ! "
199791	199801	199803	199803	Adrian	346	" Going back to the pre - Harvey period ! "
199857	199917	199853	199853	Hippies	586	" It 's a fact . I 've brought you to see that . No one can be more moderate than I am , and yet I get worse . My system is organically sound I believe : I do every possible thing , and yet I get worse . Nature never forgives ! I 'll go to bed . "
199932	199948	199923	199924	Sir Austin	186	" I suppose nothing short of a miracle helps us when we have offended her . "
199949	199958	199960	199960	Adrian	346	" Nothing short of a quack satisfies us , "
200035	200041	200028	200029	Lady Blandish	489	" He is not coming . "
200042	200053	200054	200054	he	609	" To - morrow , then , if not tonight , "
200057	200068	200028	200029	Lady Blandish	489	" But I say he will come to - night . "
200069	200082	200028	200029	Lady Blandish	489	" You do really wish to see him united to his wife ? "
200095	200101	200089	200089	his	609	" Can you ask me ? "
200102	200106	200109	200111	the ungenerous woman	5832	" I mean , "
200113	200126	200109	200111	the ungenerous woman	5832	" your System will require no further sacrifices from either of them ? "
200137	200159	200128	200128	he	609	" I think her altogether a superior person . I confess I should scarcely have hoped to find one like her . "

200171	200182	200184	200185	the baronet	609	" No : it was presumptuous beyond a certain point , "
200196	200200	200201	200201	she	489	" Ah me ! "
200204	200216	200201	200201	she	489	" if we would always be true to our own wisdom ! "
200217	200228	200229	200230	Sir Austin	186	" You are very singular to - night , Emmeline . "
200418	200423	200410	200410	her	489	" Well ! well ! "
200443	200450	200451	200451	she	489	" Ha ! what is this ? "
200454	200461	200462	200462	he	186	" Benson returned it this morning , "
200466	200484	200462	200462	he	186	" The stupid fellow took it away with him by mischance , I am bound to believe . "
200513	200531	200510	200510	She	489	" A maker of Proverbs what is he but a narrow mind with the mouthpiece of narrower ? "
200532	200540	200541	200541	she	489	" I do not agree with that , "
200552	200562	200563	200563	He	186	" Was your humility feigned when you wrote it ? "
200567	200614	200563	200563	He	186	" Consider the sort of minds influenced by set sayings . A proverb is the half - way - house to an Idea , I conceive ; and the majority rest there content : can the keeper of such a house be flattered by his company ? "
200648	200665	200645	200645	she	489	" Which is the coward among us ? He who sneers at the failings of Humanity ! "
200666	200679	200687	200687	she	2927	" Oh ! that is true ! How much I admire that ! "
200701	200727	200645	200645	she	489	" There is no more grievous sight , as there is no greater perversion , than a wise man at the mercy of his feelings . "

I do not wish Lucy to remain in expectation longer , or I should have explained myself to you thoroughly , and I think or at least hope you would have justified me . I had cause to believe that you had not only violated my confidence , but grossly deceived me . It was not so , I now know . I was mistaken . Much of our misunderstanding has resulted from that mistake . But you were married a boy : you knew nothing of the world , little of yourself . To save you in after - life for there is a period when mature men and women who have married young are more impelled to temptation than in youth , though not so exposed to it , to save you , I say , I decreed that you should experience self - denial and learn something of your fellows of both sexes , before settling into a state that must have been otherwise precarious , however excellent the woman who is your mate . My System with you would have been otherwise imperfect , and you would have felt the effects of it . It is over now . You are a man . The dangers to which your nature was open are , I trust , at an end . I wish you to be happy , and I give you both my blessing , and pray God to conduct and strengthen you both . "

203203	203229	203200	203200	Richard	186	" I told you all but the very words when we last parted . What else do you think would have kept me from her ? "

203249	203257	203236	203237	his father	775	" That will be between us two , "

203348	203370	203273	203273	He	186	" So much ? If you ask me whether I had affection for her , I can say I had none . "

204845	204857	204835	204835	she	132	" what have I done to make you angry with me ? "

204899	204954	204890	204890	She	132	" Lucy . I stayed away from you I could not come to you , because ... I dared not come to you , my wife , my beloved ! I could not come because I was a coward : because hear me this was the reason : I have broken my marriage oath . "
204970	204985	204960	204960	She	132	" But you love me ? Richard ! My husband ! you love me ? "
204986	205003	204960	204960	She	132	" Yes . I have never loved , I never shall love , woman but you . "

205060	205069	204960	204960	She	132	" Can you forgive a man so base ? "

205079	205125	205126	205126	Her	132	" Yes : that I can say before God . I love you , and I have betrayed you , and am unworthy of you not worthy to touch your hand , to kneel at your feet , to breathe the same air with you . "
205131	205142	205126	205126	Her	132	" You love me ! you love me , darling ! "
205158	205178	205155	205155	she	132	" My husband ! my darling ! you will never leave me ? We never shall be parted again ? "
205311	205324	205308	205308	Lucy	132	" You must n't disturb him must n't touch him , dear ! "
205397	205410	205394	205394	Lucy	132	" He sleeps like you , Richard one arm under his head . "
205482	205489	205475	205477	The young mother	5953	" He 's dreaming of me , "

205648	205656	205629	205629	he	186	" Will he wake soon , Lucy ? "
205657	205685	205686	205686	Richard	186	" Oh no ! not yet , dear : not for hours . I would have kept him awake for you , but he was so sleepy . "
205978	205981	205982	205982	he	186	" Look ! "
205985	206030	205982	205982	he	186	" do you remember our rowing there one night , and we saw the shadow of the cypress ? I wish I could have come early to - night that we might have had another row , and I have heard you sing there ! "
206031	206034	206036	206036	she	132	" Darling ! "
206038	206054	205982	205982	he	186	" will it make you happier if I go with you now ? I will . "
206055	206066	205982	205982	he	186	" No , Lucy . Lucy , you are brave ! "
206067	206089	205982	205982	he	186	" Oh , no ! that I 'm not . I thought so once . I know I am not now . "
206090	206227	205982	205982	he	186	" Yes ! to have lived the child on your heart and never to have uttered a complaint ! you are brave . O my Lucy ! my wife ! you that have made me man ! I called you a coward . I remember it . I was the coward I the wretched vain fool ! Darling ! I am going to leave you now . You are brave , and you will bear it . Listen : in two days , or three , I may be back back for good , if you will accept me . Promise me to go to bed quietly . Kiss the child for me , and tell him his father has seen him . He will learn to speak soon . Will he soon speak , Lucy ? "
206247	206250	206251	206251	she	5965	" Going ? "
206255	206267	206251	206251	she	5965	" For two or three days . No more I hope . "
206268	206273	205982	205982	he	186	" To - night ? "
206274	206279	206251	206251	she	5965	" Yes . Now . "
206280	206287	205982	205982	he	186	" Going now ? my husband ! "
206293	206302	206288	206288	her	5965	" You will be brave , my Lucy ! "
206303	206320	206251	206251	she	5965	" Richard ! my darling husband ! Going ? What is it takes you from me ? "
206439	206446	206432	206432	She	5965	" I knew you would remain . "
206456	206474	206432	206432	She	5965	" Am I so changed from her he loved ? You will not leave me , dear ? "
206515	206523	206524	206524	she	5965	" Come : lie on my heart , "
206690	206697	206698	206699	Mrs. Berry	489	" Oh my ! oh my ! "
206702	206714	206698	206699	Mrs. Berry	489	" and I just now thinkin ' they was so happy ! "
206740	206746	206748	206749	Mrs. Berry	489	" Go to his father , "
206751	206807	206748	206749	Mrs. Berry	489	" Ta - te - tiddle - te - heighty - O ! Go , my love , and every horse in Raynham shall be out after ' m. This is what men brings us to ! Heighty - oighty - iddlety - Ah ! Or you take blessed baby , and I 'll go . "
206816	206821	206822	206822	he	609	" What is this ? "
206825	206835	206822	206822	he	609	" I heard a noise and a step descend . "
206836	206876	206878	206879	Mrs. Berry	489	" It 's Mr. Richard have gone , Sir Austin ! have gone from his wife and babe ! Rum - te - um - te - iddledy Oh , my goodness ! what sorrow 's come on us ! "
206968	207015	207027	207027	his	5433	" His ordeal is over . I have just come from his room and seen him bear the worst that could be . Return at once he has asked for you . I can hardly write intelligibly , but I will tell you what we know . "
207179	207488	207489	207490	Poor man	9769	" They were at a wretched French cabaret , smelling vilely , where we still remain , and the people try as much as they can do to compensate for our discomforts by their kindness . The French poor people are very considerate where they see suffering . I will say that for them . The doctors had not allowed his poor Lucy to go near him . She sat outside his door , and none of us dared disturb her . That was a sight for Science . His father and myself , and Mrs. Berry , were the only ones permitted to wait on him , and whenever we came out , there she sat , not speaking a word for she had been told it would endanger his life but she looked such awful eagerness . She had the sort of eye I fancy mad persons have . I was sure her reason was going . We did everything we could think of to comfort her . A bed was made up for her and her meals were brought to her there . Of course there was no getting her to eat . What do you suppose his alarm was fixed on ? He absolutely said to me but I have not patience to repeat his words . He thought her to blame for not commanding herself for the sake of her maternal duties . He had absolutely an idea of insisting that she should make an effort to suckle the child . I shall love that Mrs. Berry to the end of my days . I really believe she has twice the sense of any of us Science and all . She asked him plainly if he wished to poison the child , and then he gave way , but with a bad grace . "
207598	207881	207882	207882	He	6000	" We have with us Doctor Bairam , and a French physician from Dieppe , a very skilful man . It was he who told us where the real danger lay . We thought all would be well . A week had passed , and no fever supervened . We told Richard that his wife was coming to him , and he could bear to hear it . I went to her and began to circumlocute , thinking she listened she had the same eager look . When I told her she might go in with me to see her dear husband , her features did not change . M. Despres , who held her pulse at the time , told me , in a whisper , it was cerebral fever brain fever coming on . We have talked of her since . I noticed that though she did not seem to understand me , her bosom heaved , and she appeared to be trying to repress it , and choke something . I am sure now , from what I know of her character , that she even in the approaches of delirium was preventing herself from crying out . Her last hold of reason was a thought for Richard . It was against a creature like this that we plotted ! I have the comfort of knowing that I did my share in helping to destroy her . Had she seen her husband a day or two before but no ! there was a new System to interdict that ! Or had she not so violently controlled her nature as she did , I believe she might have been saved . "
208248	208294	208242	208242	God	176	" She died five days after she had been removed . The shock had utterly deranged her . I was with her . She died very quietly , breathing her last breath without pain asking for no one a death I should like to die . "
208399	208577	208384	208384	I	0	" But the trial for us came when she was gone . How to communicate it to Richard or whether to do so at all ! His father consulted with us . We were quite decided that it would be madness to breathe it while he was in that state . I can admit now as things have turned out we were wrong . His father left us I believe he spent the time in prayer and then leaning on me , he went to Richard , and said in so many words , that his Lucy was no more . I thought it must kill him . He listened , and smiled . I never saw a smile so sweet and so sad . He said he had seen her die , as if he had passed through his suffering a long time ago . He shut his eyes . I could see by the motion of his eyeballs up that he was straining his sight to some inner heaven . I can not go on . "
208642	208785	208639	208639	he	6021	" A letter found on his clothes tells us the origin of the quarrel . I have had an interview with Lord M. this morning . I can not say I think him exactly to blame : Richard forced him to fight . At least I do not select him the foremost for blame . He was deeply and sincerely affected by the calamity he has caused . Alas ! he was only an instrument . Your poor aunt is utterly prostrate and talks strange things of her daughter 's death . She is only happy in drudging . Dr. Bairam says we must under any circumstances keep her employed . Whilst she is doing something , she can chat freely , but the moment her hands are not occupied she gives me an idea that she is going into a fit . "
208821	208869	208870	208870	You	6030	" Come at once . You will not be in time to see her . She will lie at Raynham . If you could you would see an angel . He sits by her side for hours . I can give you no description of her beauty . "
